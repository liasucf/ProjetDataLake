    "text": "Solon Borland (September 21, 1808 \u2013 January 1, 1864) was an American physician who served as a United States Senator from Arkansas from 1848 to 1853. In later life, he served as an officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded a cavalry regiment in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War. ==Early life and career== Solon Borland was born on September 21, 1808, in Nansemond County, Virginia to Dr. Thomas Borland, a native of Scotland, and Harriet Godwin Borland. When he was a youth, his family moved to Murfreesboro, North Carolina, where he attended Hertford Academy. Borland also studied medicine in Philadelphia and Louisville. In 1831, he led forces as a captain that were dispatched to Southampton County, Virginia to fight Nat Turner's slave rebellion. During the Mexican\u2013American War, Borland was commissioned as a major in the Arkansas Mounted Infantry Regiment, serving under Archibald Yell. He served throughout the war, having turned over his newspaper to associates. Borland was taken as a prisoner of war by the Mexican army on January 23, 1847, just south of Saltillo, Coahuila. He escaped, and was discharged when his regiment was disbanded and mustered out in June, but continued in the army as volunteer aide-de-camp to General William J. Worth during the remainder of the campaign, from the Battle of Molino del Rey to the capture of Mexico City on September 14, 1847. After the war, Borland was elected as a United States Senator to fill the unexpired term of Ambrose Hundley Sevier. His views were generally of a disunionist version, and he was not popular with many Senate members. During an 1850 debate over Southern rights, he physically attacked Mississippi Senator Henry Foote. He discovered soon after his return to Little Rock, Arkansas, that his views were not popular at home, either. In 1852 he opposed the decision of sending Commodore Perry to open Japan to international trade on grounds that the leaders of that country did not offend U.S. interests by refusing to open their country to international trade.New York Times, Apr. 9, 1852 Borland resigned from the United States Senate in 1853 and was appointed as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary (Nicaragua). Immediately after his arrival in Managua, Borland called for the U.S. Government to repudiate the Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty, and for the American military to support Honduras in its confrontation with Great Britain. In a public address in Nicaragua, he stated that it was his greatest ambition to see Nicaragua \"forming a bright star in the flag of the United States\". He was reprimanded for this by U.S. Secretary of State William Marcy. While leaving Greytown in May, 1854, Borland interfered with the local arrest of an American citizen. A crowd had gathered, and a bottle was thrown which hit Borland in the face. Enraged, he reported the incident to the President of the United States, who promptly dispatched a gunboat, and demanded an apology. When none was given, Greytown was bombarded and burned. Borland returned to Little Rock in October 1854, and resumed his medical practice and operation of his pharmacy. Borland declined a nomination from President Pierce as governor of the New Mexico Territory. However he remained active in local politics, and very vocal as to his views on state's rights and secession. ==American Civil War== At the start of the American Civil War, Borland was appointed as a commander of Arkansas Militia by Arkansas Governor Henry M. Rector, and ordered to lead the expedition that seized Fort Smith, Arkansas, in the first days of the war, despite the fact that Arkansas had not yet seceded. By the time Borland and his forces arrived in Fort Smith, the Federal troops had already departed, and there were no shots fired. He was replaced as commander at the Arkansas Secession convention less than a month later, but he was able to obtain a position as a commander for Northeast Arkansas. For a time in 1861 he commanded the depot at Pitman's Ferry, near Pocahontas, Arkansas, responsible for troop deployments and supplies. Borland's only son with his third wife, George Godwin Borland, had joined the Confederate States Army despite being only 16 years of age, and would later be killed in action. Borland's first wife, Huldah G. Wright (1809\u20131837), bore him a son Harold who served in the Confederate States Army as a major, assigned to the Eastern Sub-district of Texas, Trans-Mississippi Department.Special Orders #253/14, Adjutant and Inspector General's Office, Confederate States Borland helped recruit troops for the Confederacy during this period, helping to raise the 3d Arkansas Cavalry Regiment on June 10, 1861, becoming its first colonel. The regiment was sent to Corinth, Mississippi, but without Borland. It would eventually serve under Major- General Joseph Wheeler, seeing action in the Second Battle of Corinth and the Battle of Hatchie's Bridge, along with other battles as a part of the Army of Mississippi. However, Borland never left Arkansas. While in command of northern Arkansas, he ordered an embargo of goods to end price speculation, which was rescinded by Governor Rector. Borland protested that a governor could not countermand an order from a Confederate official, but in January 1862 his order was countermanded by the Confederate States Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin. In declining health and resenting that embarrassment, Borland resigned from further service to the Confederacy in June, 1862, moving to Dallas County, Arkansas. He died before the war's end, in Harris County, Texas. His burial place is in the old City Cemetery, Houston, Texas. ==Personal life== Borland married three times, first in 1831 to Huldah Wright, who died in 1837, and with whom he had two sons. He then married Eliza Buck Hart in 1839, but she died in 1842, with no offspring. In 1843 following his second wife's death, Borland moved to Little Rock, where he founded the Arkansas Banner, which became an influential newspaper in statewide Democratic politics. Three years later, Borland challenged the editor of the rival Arkansas Gazette, a Whig newspaper, to a duel due to a slander published against him. In 1845 Borland met Mary Isabel Melbourne, with whom he would marry that same year and later have three children. ==See also== * List of Arkansas adjutants general * List of Freemasons * List of University of Louisville people ==References== ==External links== * Solon Borland at Encyclopedia of Arkansas * * Solon Borland at NCPedia (NCpedia.org) * Solon Borland at The Political Graveyard * * * Category:1808 births Category:1864 deaths Category:People from Nansemond County, Virginia Category:American people of Scottish descent Category:Democratic Party United States senators from Arkansas Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Nicaragua Category:American Fire-Eaters Category:American Freemasons Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:American political journalists Category:Duellists Category:Editors of Arkansas newspapers Category:Editors of Tennessee newspapers Category:Physician-politicians Category:Physicians from Virginia Category:Writers from Virginia Category:University of Louisville School of Medicine alumni Category:19th-century American diplomats Category:19th-century American male writers Category:19th-century American newspaper editors Category:19th-century American non-fiction writers Category:19th-century American physicians Category:American military personnel of the Mexican\u2013American War Category:American militia officers Category:United States Army officers Category:Mexican\u2013American War prisoners of war held by Mexico Category:People of Arkansas in the American Civil War Category:Confederate States Army officers Category:Cavalry commanders Category:Infectious disease deaths in Texas Category:Burials in Texas Category:American white supremacist politicians Category:Confederate States military personnel killed in the American Civil War ",
