The first chairman of the TED was \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc, the second president of Turkey. The emblem of TED got its crescent from the Turkish national flag, its torch, which is the symbol of education, from the goal of association and its stars from the aim of immortalizing the respect and the kindness towards the five administrative committee members. TED Ankara College was founded in 1930 as the first school established by TED, and was the first private Turkish school established after the foundation of Republic of Turkey to instruct in English (The first private Turkish school to instruct in English is FMV I\u015f\u0131k Lisesi, founded in the Ottoman era).
