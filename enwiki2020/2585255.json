Located along Avenida D. Jo\u00e3o II, over Avenida de Berlim and Rua Conselheiro Mariano de Carvalho, the station was planned to occupy the lands once occupied by Apeadeiro dos Olivais, which was demolished in the 1990s in order to make way for the new station. Bids for building the project on lands to be used for the 1998 exposition were solicited internationally.Mauricio Levy (1994), p.27-28 The concept was originally designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava in 1995, and built by Necso.Afonso, p. 224Acciona website The station was inaugurated on 19 May 1998, as part of the celebrations marking the opening of the Expo '98 world's fair.Alvaro Tarifa (1998), p.68-73 At the time of its opening it was considered the largest intermodal station in Portugal.,100 Obras de Arquitectura Civil no S\u00e9culo XX, 2000:114 winning the Brunel Award on 7 October 1998, in the category of large new construction projects.Yolanda del Val (1998), p.16-17 ==Architecture== View across platform from a train window Oriente Station is situated in an urban area of reclaimed industrial and abandoned buildings fronting the northern margin of the Tagus River, situated from the city centre.Lu\u00eds Cerqueira & Miguel Greg\u00f3rio (2004), p.19-20 Ambitious in its conception, the modernist station includes a Lisbon Metro station, a high-speed commuter and regional train hub, a local, national and international bus station, a shopping centre and a police station.Diana Ferreira Peralta (2011), p.39-41 The rail station was conceived with a multi- modal platform intersecting the cardinal axes for the various transport modes. With some influence from Gothic architecture, the station bears considerable resemblance to Santiago Calatrava's earlier Allen Lambert Galleria within Toronto's Brookfield Place. Calatrava's objective was to realize a new space with ample room and functionality providing multiple connections between various zones in the metropolitan area of Lisbon. One important aspect of the station is its link to the urban environment in which it was constructed. The decision to elevate the rail line, for example, eliminated a physical barrier between the city and the Tagus River margin. The station, covered in a lattice structure of glass and metal, is constructed of reinforced concrete and raised over the roadway. By January 2011, there were eight lines that extended across platforms, between in height. In addition to the many galleries that are part of the station, it is connected to the Centro Comercial Vasco da Gama (Vasco da Gama Commercial Centre/Mall) and the Lisbon Metro through a subterranean access, as well as a first floor connection to the train platforms and a pedestrian walkway. ==Services== == References == ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * * * * * * ==External links== * Portal das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Discover the Orient Station Category:Transport in Lisbon Category:Santiago Calatrava structures Gare Oriente Oriente Category:Railway stations in Lisbon Category:Lisbon Metro stations Category:Neo-futurism architecture Category:Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es ",
