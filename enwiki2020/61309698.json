    "text": "John McKenzie (1885 - 1958) was a Scottish trade unionist. McKenzie joined the National Union of Gasworkers and General Labourers, and from 1910 worked full- time for the union as a district organiser. In 1913, the union appointed him as its Scottish district secretary. He opposed the Red Clydeside movement, claiming that it was a conspiracy of craft unions, and that many people wished to work but were prevented from doing so by mass pickets. McKenzie retained the position when the union became part of the new National Union of General and Municipal Workers, finally retiring in 1946. ==References== Category:1885 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Scottish trade unionists ",
