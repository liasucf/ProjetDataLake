It identifies as the world architecture and design award. == History == Since its creation in 2015, the Prix has been presented at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris, acknowledging achievements in various forms of architecture. === Synergies between culture and economics === The Prix initially focused on commercial buildings, with the declared aim of fostering a better mix of the economic and cultural domains. Irina Bokova, Director- General of UNESCO, declared on 19 June 2015, \"The Prix Versailles is one of the ways to shine light on the intersection between creation, art and economics\". === Expanded scope === After beginning with shops and stores, hotels and restaurants, the Prix expanded to include shopping malls in 2017, followed by the categories of university campuses, passenger stations and sports facilities in 2019. Geographically speaking the Prix recognized French projects in 2015 (with four Prix and special prizes awarded) and then went international in 2016 (with nine Prix and special prizes). Continental editions were created in 2017, giving rise in some cases to continental awards ceremonies in 2018. == Purpose and process == === Values === The Prix Versailles aims to underscore \u201cthe role that economic agents of all sectors may play in beautifying and improving our living environment\u201d. It means to promote \u201cthe creation of quality spaces in every inhabited area\u201d. Its ambition is for \u201ceveryday architecture [to] be a tool for a form of sustainable development including its various components: ecology (green economy) and society and culture (purple economy)\u201d. In 2019, the Prix adopted the motto, \u201cInspiration, Progress and Inclusion\u201d. In 2020, the Prix launched the international appeal, \u201cTowards a cultural renaissance of the economy\u201d,Signed by: Ferran Adri\u00e0, Massimiliano Alajmo, Elena Arzak, Rafael Aranda, Shigeru Ban, Massimo Bottura, Mariya Gabriel, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Gouadain, \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, Iris van Herpen, Kengo Kuma, Pascal Lamy, Eric Maskin, Jean Nouvel, Edmund Phelps, Renzo Piano, Anne-Sophie Pic, Carme Pigem, Christopher Pissarides, Zurab Pololikashvili, David Sassoli, Vera Songwe, Jean-No\u00ebl Tronc, Ram\u00f3n Vilalta. which was published simultaneously in El Pa\u00eds, the Corriere della Sera and Le Monde. === Method === Since 2017, the categories of shops & stores, shopping malls, hotels and restaurants have been crowned with continental titles in each of the six Prix regions: Africa and West Asia; Central America, the South and the Caribbean; North America; Central Asia and the Northeast; South Asia and the Pacific; and Europe. The awards rely on far-reaching calls for submissions and systematic media analyses. In 2019, the continental editions were supplemented by world selections for the categories of campuses, passenger stations and sports. Based on continental titles or world selections, an independent judges panel confers the world titles for all the Prix categories. The world results may be announced on different dates by category. The criteria used by the judges include \u201cinnovation, creativity, reflection of local, natural and cultural heritage, and ecological efficiency, as well as the values of social interaction and participation which the United Nations holds in high regard\u201d. {| class=\"wikitable alternance\" style=\"text- align: center; width: 68%;\" |- !
