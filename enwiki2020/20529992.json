The ferry is operated by a private sector operator under contract to New South Wales Roads and Maritime Services and is free of tolls. The crossing is in length and takes approximately 5 minutes. The ferry operates on demand 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but is closed for maintenance on the first Tuesday of each month from 0930 to 1200 The Webbs Creek Ferry is one of two cable ferry crossings at Wisemans Ferry, the other being the eponymous Wisemans Ferry, which crosses the Hawkesbury River to a point downstream of the confluence with the Macdonald River.
