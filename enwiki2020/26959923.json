The musicians accompanying Bonds on the album include many members of the E Street Band and the Asbury Jukes.Bruce Springsteen guest appearances The album includes three songs written by Bruce Springsteen, one written by Steve Van Zandt, and several covers of songs from the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Jackson Browne, and others. It also features a duet between Bonds and Springsteen on the track \"Jole Blon\". Bonds' early 1960s sound had been a major influence on both Springsteen and Van Zandt. The songs written by Springsteen, including the cover of \"Jole Blon\", were originally intended for his 1980 album, The River, but he felt they fit better with Bonds and his versions of them have never been released although he has performed most of them live, often featuring Bonds as a special guest.http://brucebase.wikispaces.com/The+River+-+Studio+Sessions The album produced several singles. The Springsteen-penned \"This Little Girl\" was a major success, peaking at No. 7 in Cash Box and at No. 11 on the Billboard pop chart. It also reached No. 5 on the mainstream rock chart, as well as the Cajun traditional \"Jole Blon\",www.garyusbonds.com[ www.allmusic.com] which garnered some album-oriented rock airplay. The album itself reached No. 27 on the pop album chart and No. 34 on the R&B; album chart. Music writer Dave Marsh called Dedication \"one of the most successful comeback albums in rock & roll history\". The album was re-released in 1994 on the Razor Edge label of Razor & Tie music, and then again in 2009 on BGO Records, paired with On the Line. In a 2016 career retrospective interview with Pods & Sods, Gary revealed that a few additional songs and outtakes recorded during this time may eventually be released.https://podsodcast.com/2016/05/03/em28/ Pods & Sods - A Conversation with Gary US Bonds ==Track listing== # \"Jole Blon\" (Traditional; arranged Michael Hurley and Moon Mullican) \\- 3:25 # \"This Little Girl\" (Bruce Springsteen) \\- 3:42 # \"Your Love\" (Bruce Springsteen) \\- 3:28 # \"Dedication\" (Bruce Springsteen) \\- 3:11 # \"Daddy's Come Home\" (Steven Van Zandt) \\- 6:22 # \"It's Only Love\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) \\- 3:04 # \"The Pretender\" (Jackson Browne) \\- 6:12 # \"Way Back When\" (Gary U.S. Bonds, George Bruno) \\- 3:58 # \"From a Buick 6\" (Bob Dylan) \\- 4:25 # \"Just Like a Child\" (Leroy Anderson, John Clemente, Lou Conte) \\- 3:43 ==Personnel== Musicians:Gary U.S. Bonds - Dedication *Gary U.S. Bonds - lead vocals *Bruce Springsteen - guitars, background vocals (solo \"Jole Blon\") *Steven Van Zandt - bass, fuzz bass, guitar, bongos, background vocals *Roy Bittan - keyboards *Clarence Clemons - saxophone, background vocals *Danny Federici - accordion, keyboards *Garry Tallent - bass *Max Weinberg - drums * Additional musicians: **Chuck Jackson - vocals **Ben E.
