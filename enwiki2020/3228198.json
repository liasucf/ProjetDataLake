Recorded since the 12th century, the church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and rebuilt by the office of Sir Christopher Wren. St Margaret Lothbury still serves as a parish church, as well as being the official church of five Livery Companies, two Ward Clubs and two Professional Institutes. It also has connections with many local finance houses, all of which hold special services each year. ==History== The earliest mention of St Margaret Lothbury is from 1185.\"London:the City Churches\u201d Pevsner,N/Bradley,S New Haven, Yale, 1998 The patronage of the church belonged to the abbess and convent of Barking, Essex until the Dissolution, when it passed to the Crown.
