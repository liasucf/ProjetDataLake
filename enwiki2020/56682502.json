    "text": "Golden Hour is the fourth studio album by American country music singer and songwriter Kacey Musgraves, released on March 30, 2018, through MCA Nashville. Musgraves co-wrote all 13 tracks and co-produced the album with Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk. A country and country pop record, Golden Hour explores elements of disco, electropop, electronica, and yacht rock. Golden Hour debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200. The album received widespread acclaim from critics, winning in all four of its nominated categories at the 61st Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Best Country Album. The album's first two singles, \"Butterflies\" and \"Space Cowboy\", also won awards for Best Country Solo Performance and Best Country Song, respectively. Golden Hour also won Album of the Year at the 52nd Annual Country Music Association Awards. In 2020, Golden Hour was ranked at 270 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. ==Background and recording== Musgraves wrote and recorded most of the songs from the album throughout 2017; about the writing process she said: \"I have a lot more love songs this time around, and I've never been one to write a love song and really feel it.\" She continued: \"That probably sounds like the most depressing thing ever. [But] I'm coming off getting married and being in this golden hour of my personal life, where all these things are finally coming to fruition. I found myself inspired to write about this person and all these things he brought out in me that weren\u2019t there before.\" Some of the album was recorded in a studio above a horse stable owned by musician Sheryl Crow. In a 2019 interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Musgraves discussed being under the influence of LSD when composing the songs Mother and Slow Burn and how it helped her creative process; \"I\u2019m not going to tell anybody to run out and do anything that wouldn\u2019t be suitable for their mind or their lifestyle, but it did have positive effects for me\". ==Promotion and packaging== On March 10, 2018, Musgraves announced the Oh, What a World: Tour in support of the album while performing at the Country to Country music festival in London. The first 12 dates of the tour were announced on March 12, with Musgraves stating on social media that tour dates in other countries would eventually be added. The tour began on October 13 in Oslo, Norway. Musgraves announced a second leg of the tour, titled the Oh, What a World: Tour II, in February 2019. Musgraves' sister Kelly Christine Sutton took the cover photo for Golden Hour over a two-day photo shoot in and around their hometown of Golden, Texas. Sutton, who also is credited with designing the album's packaging, has previously worked with Musgraves for all of her albums' artwork. Of the cover photo, Sutton recalls Kacey \"wanted to use this paper fan, and we are usually on the same page with ideas, but I couldn\u2019t picture it. We went out into this wide open field. We needed one with no trees, so there was sky only. Almost immediately after we reviewed the photos, we just knew we had it.\" ==Critical reception== Golden Hour received widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 89, based on 17 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated the album four and a half out of five stars and called it \"warm and enveloping, pitched halfway between heartbreak and healing\u2014but (it) lingers in the mind because the songs are so sharp, buttressed by long, loping melodies and Musgraves' affectless soul baring.\" Writing for The Independent and rating the album a perfect 5 out of 5, Roisin O'Connor states the album is \"a reminder that sometimes \u2013 often, if you're looking in the right places \u2013 life is beautiful.\" Additionally, it was a Spin \"Essential\" and of the genre-bending songs on the album, reviewer Katherine St. Asaph calls it \"not classicist, but perhaps it might be classic.\" The album was rated number one by the BBC poll of polls, a compilation of best-of- the-year lists across 35 music reviewers, on a list of the best albums of 2018. The album also placed number one in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 2018. ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+Awards ! Association ! Year ! Category !
