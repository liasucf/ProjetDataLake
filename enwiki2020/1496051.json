He separated the province of Ulster from the authority of the High King, and is said to have made war against the Ulaid, who had killed his great grandfather, for a hundred years according to the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn,R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, pp. 241-245, 459-461 150 years according to the Annals of the Four Masters,Annals of the Four Masters M4019-4169 but Geoffrey Keating, citing an ancient poem, gives him only twenty-one years.Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.26 According to one version of the Lebor Gab\u00e1la, the Ulaid united with the Fomorians and gave him battle at M\u00f3in Tr\u00f3gaide in County Meath, but a plague fell on them and the leaders of both sides died. According to another version, agreed by Keating and the Four Masters, S\u00edrna was killed by Rothechtaid Rotha at Alind. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la synchronises the start of his reign with the reign of Deioces of the Medes (694\u2013665 BC), and his death with his successor Phraortes (665\u2013633 BC). The chronology of Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn dates his reign to 814\u2013794 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 1181\u20131031 BC. ==References== Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland ",
