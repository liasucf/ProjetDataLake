    "text": "Signe Helene Kjelstrup (born August 29, 1949) is a Norwegian professor of physical chemistry at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway. She is a principal investigator at PoreLab, a Center of Excellence at NTNU. Her main area of research is non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and in August 2019 PoreLab hosted \u00abThe International Workshop on Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics in Porous Media\u00bb on the occasion of professor Kjelstrup's 70th birthday. == Education and professional career == Kjelstrup was born in Oslo. She has an Msc (sivilingeni\u00f8r) in chemistry from the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH), Trondheim, (1971) and her thesis received the honour \u00abcommended to the King\u00bb (laudabilis cum litteris commendatitiis). This was the first time in the history of the school that a woman received this highest honour. In 1974 she received the degree lic. techn.precursor to the dr.ing. degree with the thesis Complex formations in alkali-aluminium fluoride melts. She later received a Fulbright grant and worked as an assistant professor at the School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester (New York, USA). She has a dr.techn. degree from 1982. Her thesis is titled On the energetics of coupled transport processes : a theoretical and experimental irreversible thermodynamic investigation. In 1985 Kjelstrup was appointed professor at NTH. Together with Professor Tormod F\u00f8rland, she developed the field of irreversible thermodynamics there. Her scientific work has been of great importance in this field. She is particularly interested in improving the second law of thermodynamics and of renewable energy technology. She has been a visiting professor at several foreign universities: Medical College of Ohio (1988/1989); Leiden University (1997/1998); Kyoto University (2000) and University of Barcelona (2004). == Publications (selection) == BIBSYS' unified search service \"ORIA\" gives an overview of the literature held by all Norwegian college and university libraries, other research institutions and the National Library of Norway * (The Norwegian Scientific Index) == Memberships and honours == Kjelstrup is an elected member of Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences and Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters. She has been awarded an honorary doctorate at The Northeastern University of China. She has received the Guldberg and Waage medal from the Norwegian Chemical Society. In 1980 she received \u00abFridtjof Nansens bel\u00f8nning for yngre forskere\u00bb, (the Fridtjof Nansen Reward for young scientists). In 2018 her daughter, the composer Maja Ratkje, wrote the musical work \u00abA Highway in State Space\u00bb, dedicated to Kjelstrup and inspired by her research. The work, which has the same title as one of Kjelstrup's research articles, was part of the project and album Sound of Science, where seven composers were invited by the musician Jeffrey Zeigler to contribute with a new piece of music each. == References == == External links == * Kjelstrup's profile page, NTNU Retrieved 2019-08-29 Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Norwegian physical chemists Category:Norwegian Institute of Technology alumni Category:Norwegian University of Science and Technology faculty Category:Members of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters Category:Members of the Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences Category:Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters ",
