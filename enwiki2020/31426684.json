    "text": "Carl Johan Bonnesen (26 May 1868 \u2013 13 December 1933) was a Danish sculptor. He specialised in depictions of animals and exotic, \"primitive\" subjects as seen in the first sculpture he ever exhibited, A Victorious Group of Huns from 1889. It was soon followed by A Barbarian (1891), The Period of the Huns (1893), A Bedouin\u00ab (1897) and A Mounted Chinese Warrior (1900). Bonnesen soon had many commissions. In 1891, at the age of 22,his first sculpture was acquired by the collector Heinrich Hirschsprung and cast in bronze (it is today exhibited in the garden by the Hirschsprung Collection, Copenhagen). His most important patron was the brewer Carl Jacobsen (Carlsberg) who, among other pieces, ordered Thor Driving Across the Arch of the Sky (in copper, it stands on top of the brewery buildings at Carlsberg). Bonnesen's last great patron was Harald Plum, who had the huge sculpture group Thors Fighting the Giants (1891) placed on his private island, Thor\u00f8. (It now stands by the Haustrup Plast factory on the outskirts of Odense). Other works include The Period of the Huns (1893), A Bedouin\u00ab (1897) and A Mounted Chinese Warrior (1900). ==Early life== Bonnesen was born on 26 May 1868 in Aalborg. He trained to become a carpenter for two years before moving to Copenhagen where he was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1887. There he studied under Theobald Stein and Christian Carl Peters, graduating in 1889. ==Extensive travels== After completing his education, Bonnesen travelled extensively during the 1890s. From 1894 to 1895, he stayed in Paris where he associated with the circle around Stephan Sinding with whom he had more in common than he had with Stein and Peters, his former teachers. In 1898, he went to Egypt and East Asia and his travels also took him to the United States. ==Career== Adam and Eve at the body of Abel, 1900 Bonnesen had a large and diverse production of statues and statuettes. These include Adam and Eve at the body of Abel (1900) and Two Lions in the Danish National Gallery as well as several statuettes in The Hirschsprung Collection. Many of Bonnesen's plaster casts have, since 1969, been exhibited in Thingb\u00e6k Kalkminer near Rebild Bakker. ==List of public statues== * A Barbarian, Garden of the Hirschsprung Collection, Copenhagen (1891) * Thor's battle against the J\u00f6tunns, roof of the Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse, Copenhagen (1901) * Diana (equestrian statue), Trondhjems Plads, Copenhagen (1908) * Christian IX (equestrian statue), John F.
