    "text": "The Anglican Diocese of Bathurst is located in the Province of New South Wales. It includes the cities of Orange, Bathurst and Dubbo. The Bishop is the Right Reverend Mark Calder, installed on 23 November 2019. == Ministry == The diocese has 32 parishes covering about a third of the state of New South Wales. As well as the cities of Orange, Dubbo and Bathurst, major towns in the diocese include Bourke, Cobar, Cowra, Forbes, Mudgee, Parkes and Wellington. == Cathedral == All Saints' Cathedral The cathedral church of the diocese is All Saints' Cathedral, Bathurst in the heart of the city. The cathedral building was originally designed by Edmund Blacket in 1845 as a parish church, but became a cathedral in 1870 with the creation of the Diocese of Bathurst. An organ was installed in 1886 and bells were hung in 1855. In the 1890s, however, the bell tower was found to be unstable, so the bells could not be \"rung full circle\" but only by striking them. Due to structural problems the original cathedral was demolished in 1969\u201370 and replaced in 1971 by a new building constructed in a 20th-century style. In 2009, the bells were rehung in a new bell tower attached to the new cathedral. ==Senior clergy== ===Bishops of Bathurst=== ===Deans of Bathurst=== The following individuals have served as Deans of the All Saints' Cathedral in Bathurst: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

Sunday and weekday services are usually conducted weekly or in certain weeks of the month indicated below in parentheses. In addition to church buildings, many parishes conduct services in nursing homes, hospitals or community halls which are included below. Most parishes employ one priest to oversee ministry of the parish who can be assisted by lay staff, assistant clergy or honorary clergy or lay readers. In the more remote worship centres, the Company of the Good Shepherd ensures that each church is able to run services and be served by a priest for Holy Communion and other purposes. Many of the smaller or rural parishes do not keep or frequently update websites, meaning that the services times and staff listed below may be outdated. The best way to find accurate service times in these locations is to contact or visit the parish directly. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Parishes and Churches in the Anglican Diocese of Bathurst with Service Times !Parish !Staff !Church !Services |- | rowspan=\"4\" |Bathurst Cathedral | rowspan=\"4\" |Very Rev James Hodson Ms Kathy Keech |All Saints' Cathedral, Bathurst |Sat 5:00pm, 6:00pm Sun 8:30am, 10:00am, 4:30pm (1st, 3rd) Mon 8:30am Tue 1:00pm Wed 8:30am Fri 10:00am |- |St Stephen's Fitzgerald's Valley |Sun 2:00pm (4th) |- |St Paul's, Stewart Street |None |- |Holy Spirit, Turondale |Sun 3:00pm (3rd) |- |St Barnabas' South Bathurst (meeting at Perthville Convent) |Sun 8:00am, 9:30am Wed 6:00pm |- |St Paul's, Yetholme |Sun 11:45am (1st, 3rd) |- |St Peter's, Rockley |Sun 11:00am, 11:30am (4th), 3:00pm (2nd) |- |St Martin's, Perthville |Sun 11:30am (2nd) |- |St Catherine's Nursing Home |Wed 9:30am |- | rowspan=\"7\" |Blayney | rowspan=\"7\" |- |Christ Church, Blayney |Sun 8:00am, 9:30am |- |St Mark's, Millthorpe |Sun 9:30am |- |St John's, Lucknow |Sun 11:30am (3rd) |- |St Paul's, Carcoar |Sun 8:00am (1st, 3rd) |- |Holy Spirit, Trunkey Creek |Sun 8:00am (2nd), 9:00am (4th) |- |St James', Barry |Sun 9:00am (3rd) |- | rowspan=\"4\" |Bourke/Brewarrina | rowspan=\"4\" |Rev John & Denise Gaff Rev Canon Grahame Yager |- Company of the Good Sheperd |Bourke |Sat 6:00pm |- |Brewarrina |Sun 9:00am |- |Weilmoringle Tennis Shed |by arrangement |- |Wanaaring Community Hall |by arrangement (monthly) |- | rowspan=\"5\" |Canowindra | rowspan=\"5\" |Rev Joy Harris |All Saints', Canowindra |Sun 9:00am |- |Uniting, Canowindra |Sun 5:00pm (3rd) Thu 10:00am (1st, 2nd) |- |St Matthews', Woodstook |Sun 8:00am (1st, 3rd), evening (5th) |- |Uniting, Cranbury |Sun 11:00am (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th) |- |Uniting, Cudal |Sun evening (2nd) |- |Cobar |Company of the Good Shepherd |St Paul's, Cobar |Sun 9:00am |- | rowspan=\"4\" |Condobolin | rowspan=\"4\" |Company of the Good Shepherd |All Saints', Condobolin |Sun 9:00am Wed 10:30am (4th) |- |The Ret.
