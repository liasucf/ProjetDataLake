    "text": "A conurbation is a region comprising a number of metropolises, cities, large towns, and other urban areas that, through population growth and physical expansion, have merged to form one continuous urban or industrially developed area. In most cases, a conurbation is a polycentric urbanised area, in which transportation has developed to link areas to create a single urban labour market or travel to work area. Patrick Geddes coined the term in his book Cities In Evolution (1915). He drew attention to the ability of the then new technology of electric power and motorised transport to allow cities to spread and agglomerate together, and gave as examples \"Midlandton\" in England, the Ruhr in Germany, Randstad in the Netherlands, and North Jersey in the United States. The term as described is used in Britain, whereas in the United States each polycentric \"metropolitan area\" may have its own common designation, such as San Francisco Bay Area or the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex. Internationally, the term \"urban agglomeration\" is often used to convey a similar meaning to \"conurbation\". A conurbation should also be contrasted with a megalopolis, where the urban areas are close but not physically contiguous, and where the merging of labour markets has not yet developed. ==Africa== ===Mauritius=== The cities and towns of Port Louis, Beau Bassin-Rose Hill, Curepipe, Quatre Bornes, Vacoas-Phoenix and other urbanized villages form a large and central conurbation on the island of Mauritius. A large part of this conurbation is located in the district of Plaines Wilhems. This network of urban areas has a total population of 606,650 (49% of the island's population) as of 2011. ===Morocco=== Rabat-Sal\u00e9 ===Nigeria=== Lagos is a conurbation formed through the merged development of the initial Lagos city area with other cities and towns, such as Ikeja, Ojo, along with various suburban communities like Agege, Alimosho, Ifako-Ijaiye, Kosofe, Mushin, Oshodi and Shomolu. ===South Africa=== Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni (East Rand), and Tshwane (greater Pretoria) are currently merging to form a region that has a population of 14.6 million. ==North America== ===Canada=== ====Golden Horseshoe (Ontario)==== The \"Golden Horseshoe\" is a densely populated and industrialized region centred on the west end of Lake Ontario in Southern Ontario, Canada. The largest cities in the region are Toronto, Mississauga, Oakville, Burlington, St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Brampton, and Hamilton. If metropolitan areas which are somewhat distinct from the core urban area of the Golden Horseshoe by about 30 to 50 km of less developed and semi-rural land are included (similar to Combined Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States as defined by United States Office of Management and Budget), the total population is 8.8 million people, which is slightly over a quarter (25.6%) of the population of Canada, approximately 75% of Ontario's population and one of the largest metropolitan areas in North America. The larger area is named the Greater Golden Horseshoe and includes the metropolitan areas of Kitchener (including adjacent cities it is often referred to as Waterloo Region), Barrie, Guelph, Peterborough, and Brantford. The Greater Golden Horseshoe is also part of the Windsor-Quebec Corridor and its southeastern boundary is across the Niagara River from the Buffalo\u2013Niagara Falls metropolitan area in the United States. ====Greater Montreal (Quebec)==== Greater Montreal is Canada's second-largest conurbation, with Statistics Canada defining the Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) as and a population of 3,824,221 as of 2011, which represents almost half of the population of the province of Quebec. Slightly smaller, there are 82 municipalities grouped under the Montreal Metropolitan Community to coordinate issues such as land planning, transportation, and economic development. ====Lower Mainland (British Columbia)==== British Columbia's Lower Mainland is the most populated area in Western Canada. It consists of many mid-sized contiguous urban areas, including Vancouver, North Vancouver (city and district municipality), West Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Richmond, Surrey, and Coquitlam, among others. The Lower Mainland population is around 2.5 million (as of 2011) and the area has one of the highest growth rates on the continent of up to 9.2 percent from the 2006 census. ====National Capital Region (Ontario and Quebec)==== The National Capital Region (NCR) is made up of the capital, Ottawa, and neighbouring Gatineau which is located across the Ottawa River. As Ottawa is in Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec, this is a unique conurbation. Federal government buildings are located in both cities and many workers live in one city and work in the other. The National Capital Region consists of an area of 5,319 square kilometres that straddles the boundary between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The area of the National Capital Region is very similar to that of the Ottawa-Gatineau Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) although the National Capital Region contains a number of small neighbouring communities that are not contained within the CMA. When all the communities are added, the population is around 1,500,000. Ottawa- Gatineau is the only CMA in the nation to fall within two provinces. ===Mexico=== ====Mexico City (CDMX)==== The \"CDMX\" is the most densely populated center in North America. Greater Mexico City refers to the conurbation around Mexico City, officially called Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area (Zona Metropolitana del Valle de M\u00e9xico),[1] constituted by Mexico City itself composed of 16 Municipalities\u2014and 41 adjacent municipalities of the states of Mexico and Hidalgo. For normative purposes,[further explanation needed] however, Greater Mexico City most commonly refers to the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico (Zona Metropolitana del Valle de M\u00e9xico) an agglomeration that incorporates 18 additional municipalities. As of 2019 an estimated 27,782,000 people lived in Greater Mexico City, making it the largest metropolitan area in North America. It is surrounded by thin strips of highlands which separate it from other adjacent metropolitan areas, of which the biggest are Puebla, Toluca, and Cuernavaca-Cuautla, and together with which it makes up the Mexico City megalopolis. ===United States=== A satellite image of Florida showing South Florida (bottom right), which consists of hundreds of municipalities, as a continuous agglomeration of lights. Also, the Greater Orlando and Tampa Bay areas encroach via the I-4 corridor. ====Puerto Rico==== The Caribbean area, which is generally not considered to be part of a continent geographically speaking, has a conurbation in Puerto Rico consisting of San Juan, Bayam\u00f3n, Guaynabo, Carolina, Can\u00f3vanas, Trujillo Alto, Toa Alta, Toa Baja, Cata\u00f1o, and Caguas. This area is colloquially known as the \"\u00c1rea Metropolitana\", and houses around 1.4 million inhabitants spread over an area of approximately 396.61 square kilometers (153.13 sq mi). Thus, making it the largest city in the Caribbean by area. ====New York Tri-state area==== One example of a conurbation is the expansive concept of the New York metropolitan area (the Tri-state region) centered on New York City, including 30 counties spread among New York State, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, with an estimated population of 21,961,994 in 2007. Approximately one-fifteenth of all U.S. residents live in the Greater New York City area. This conurbation is the result of several central cities whose urban areas have merged. ====Greater Boston Area==== Holding a population of 7,427,336 as of 2005, the Combined Statistical Area including Greater Boston consists of Boston proper and a collection of distinct but intertwined cities including Providence, Rhode Island, Worcester, Massachusetts, and Manchester, New Hampshire. Most importantly, the cities that compose the Greater Boston CSA are interlinked by heavy public transportation infrastructure, maintain continuously urban interstices, and hold mutual commuting patterns. ====San Francisco Bay Area==== Another conurbation is the combination of the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose and several minor urban centers with a combined population of nearly 8 million people, known as the San Francisco Bay Area. ====Greater Los Angeles Area==== The Greater Los Angeles Area consists of the merging of several distinct central cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Orange County, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura. This area is also often referred to simply as Southern California or colloquially as SoCal (a larger region which includes San Diego). In 2016, Southern California had a population of 23,800,500, making it slightly larger than the New York Tri- State Area, and is projected to remain so due to a faster growth rate. But because Southern California is not yet a recognized Combined Statistical Area by the United States Office of Management and Budget, the New York Tri-State Area officially remains the nation's largest as of now. ====Greater Houston area==== An example of a conurbation is seen in Greater Houston. Centered in Houston, the area is now a continuously urbanized from the coastal areas of Galveston extending through the northern side of the metro area, including The Woodlands, Conroe, and Spring, going up to Huntsville. The suburbs of Fort Bend County, Texas extend through the cities of the Galveston Bay Area and beyond to form a population of 7,197,883. ====Baltimore\u2013Washington Area==== The traditionally separate metropolitan areas of Baltimore and Washington, D.C. have shared suburbs and a continuous urbanization between the two central cities (Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area). ====San Diego\u2013Tijuana==== The largest conurbation between the United States and Mexico, San Diego\u2013Tijuana includes the two countries' busiest border crossing and a shared economy. ====Dallas--Fort Worth==== Three large cities \u2014 Dallas, Fort Worth, and Arlington \u2014 make up this area. Each city is linked by bordering city limits or suburbs. The area is also known as the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth \u201cmetroplex\u201d, so called because has more than one principal anchor city of nearly equal size or importance, and is included in the emerging megalopolis known as the Texas Triangle. According to Texas Monthly, the term is a portmanteau of the terms \"metropolitan\" and \"complex\" and was created by local advertising agency TracyLocke. The North Texas Commission trademarked the term \"Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex\" in 1972 as a replacement for the previously ubiquitous term \"North Texas\". Urban areas with smaller secondary anchor cities (such as Mexico City, New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago and Phoenix) are not considered to be conurbations. ====Detroit\u2013Windsor==== The major U.S. city of Detroit, Michigan lies immediately across the Detroit River from Windsor, Ontario in Canada. In many respects\u2014economically, historically, culturally, socially, and, of course, geographically\u2014Windsor is more a part of Metro Detroit than of Ontario. The two cities and their surrounding suburbs are commonly referred to collectively as the Detroit\u2013Windsor area. The Detroit-Windsor border is the largest commercial border crossing in North America and the busiest between the two countries.The Canada-U.S. border: by the numbers \u2013 Canada \u2013 CBC News. Cbc.ca (2011-12-07). Retrieved on 2013-07-16. ====South Florida==== The entire tri-county area also known as the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area is now continuously urbanized along a roughly length of the Florida east coast as well as extending inland and continuing south of Miami as far as Florida City. Although this is generally all referred to as a single metropolitan area, not a conurbation, it is sometimes broken up into the Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach metros. ====Minneapolis - St. Paul==== Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul is the most populous urban area in the state of Minnesota, and is composed of 182 cities and townships built around the Mississippi, Minnesota, and St. Croix rivers. The area is also nicknamed the Twin Cities for its two largest cities, Minneapolis, with the highest population, and Saint Paul, the state capital. ====The Valley of the Sun==== Phoenix, Arizona is the capital and most populous city in Arizona. It is the center of The Valley of the Sun, recognized by the United States Census Bureau as Chandler, Mesa, and Phoenix in the MSA. Other communities in the metropolitan area include Scottsdale, Glendale, Tempe, Gilbert, and Peoria. ====The Front Range Urban Corridor==== Denver, Colorado is the capital and most populous city in Colorado, as well as the most populous municipality in the Front Range Urban Corridor. This conurbation encompasses 18 counties in Colorado and Wyoming and had an estimated population of 4,976,781 in 2018, an increase of 14.84% since the 2010 United States Census. ==South America== ===Argentina=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"| !!Conurbation!!Population!!Year!!Note |- | style=\"text- align:center;\"|150px||Buenos AiresGreater Buenos Aires||13,641,973Greater Buenos Aires \u2013 2010 Census provisional results ||2010||Metro region excluding La Plata and its metro area (an additional 694,253 [ INDEC ]). |} * Greater Buenos Aires (12.046.799) \u2013 Greater La Plata (694.253) \u2013 Z\u00e1rate / Campana ===Brazil=== The entire Rio\u2013S\u00e3o Paulo area is also sometimes considered a conurbation, and plans are in the works to connect the cities with a high- speed rail.

It is responsible for one-third of China's imports and exports. * The Jingjinji, comprising Tianjin, Beijing, Tangshan and Qinhuangdao, houses an estimated 130 million people and is responsible for a GDP of $1.1 trillion. * The Pearl River Delta including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dongguan, Hong Kong and Macau houses 60 million people and is responsible for a GDP of $1,5 trillion, 9% of China's national GDP. ===India=== The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) consists of Mumbai and its satellite towns. Developing over a period of about 20 years, it consists of seven municipal corporations and fifteen smaller municipal councils. The region has an area of 4,355 km\u00b2 and with a population of 20.5 million, and is among the top ten most populated urban agglomerations in the world. It is linked together through the Mumbai Suburban Railway system and a large network of roads. The National Capital Region (NCR) is a name for the coordinated planning region which encompasses the entire National Capital Territory of Delhi as well as several surrounding districts in the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. However, since not all of the aforementioned areas are completely urban, the Delhi conurbation is actually limited to the NCT of Delhi and the neighbouring contiguous urban areas comprising Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida, (Greater Noida) and Ghaziabad lying in \"Central National Capital Region (CNCR)\", a small part of overall NCR. The population of this conurbation was estimated 21.7 million in 2011. It is the world's third most populous urban agglomeration. The APCRDA of Andhra Pradesh is a conurbation of three cities, namely Vijayawada, Eluru and Guntur and 11 other towns which include Mangalagiri, Tadepalle, Tenali, Ponnuru, Chilakaluripeta, Narasaraopeta, Sattenapally, Nandigama, Jaggayyapeta, Nuzividu, Gudivada and Vuyyuru. The new capital city of the state, Amaravati, is being developed between the cities of Vijayawada and Guntur at the center of the conurbation. The region holds a total population of 58 lakhs. ===Bangladesh=== Dhaka has recently been linked with Narayanganj and Gazipur city such that there are no gaps between Dhaka and those two cities. ===Indonesia=== Greater Jakarta or Jabodetabek comprises the largest urban area in Indonesia and the second-largest in the world with a population of around 30 million. The center and national capital, Jakarta, has a population of 10.3 million within its borders. The second-most populated city in Indonesia, Surabaya, also forms a conurbation known as Gerbangkertosusila with a metropolitan population of about 10 million compared to the city proper of 3 million. Conurbations are also present around Bandung and Medan. ===Israel=== * Gush Dan, Metropolitan Area of Tel Aviv, Central District (about 45% of the country's total population) ===Japan=== The Taiheiy\u014d Belt is the largest conurbation in Japan in every sense, extending from Ibaraki Prefecture to Fukuoka Prefecture, running almost 1,200 km, with the total population of 82.9 million. However, it is rarely referred to in Japan itself with each Prefecture maintaining separate identities. The Greater Tokyo Area, also called Shutoken (the National Capital Region), is a metropolitan area in the Kant\u014d region, with the estimated population of 35,676,000 in 2007, often referred to as the most populous and economically largest metropolitan area in the world. ===Malaysia=== The Klang Valley conurbation in the state of Selangor is composed of: * Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia; * Petaling Jaya; * Ampang Jaya; * Pandan Indah; * Subang Jaya; * Shah Alam; * Klang; * Selayang; * Gombak; * Putrajaya; * Cyberjaya; * Sepang; and * Kajang. The second largest conurbation by population in Malaysia is Greater Penang. Centred in George Town, the capital city of the State of Penang, the conurbation also includes the following towns in Penang, and within the neighbouring states of Kedah and Perak. *Butterworth * Bukit Mertajam * Perai *Batu Kawan * Nibong Tebal * Sungai Petani, Kedah * Kulim, Kedah * Bandar Baharu, Kedah * Parit Buntar, Perak *Bagan Serai, Perak The third largest conurbation by population in Malaysia is Iskandar Malaysia.

Within the immediate periphery but not administratively part of the region, are cities and towns belonging to various provinces near the capital region. These include the cities of Antipolo, Bacoor, Meycauayan, San Jose del Monte and San Pedro; and the towns of Angono, Binangonan, Cainta, Cardona, Marilao, Obando, Rodriguez, San Mateo and Taytay. ===Turkey=== Asian part of Istanbul forms a conurbation together with Gebze, Dar\u0131ca and \u00c7ay\u0131rova. Each province has separate governments but they work in close coordination. Transport between Anatolian part of Istanbul and western end of Kocaeli is coordinated by both provinces and there are interprovincial urban buses between Kartal and \u0130zmit, although each metropolitan municipality has a clear boundary of service. ===Thailand=== Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Thailand (14m) === United Arab Emirates === The United Arab Emirates, while comprising seven distinct entities called emirates, each with its own Emirs, contains a significant conurbation formed by the agglomeration of the urban areas of three cities belonging to three separate Emirates. The Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area contains the urban areas of Dubai to the south, Sharjah in the middle and Ajman toward the north eastern end of the conurbation. The total population is about 5.64 million people as of 2015 and as such, contributes to over 70% of the UAE population. Dubai is the major financial hub and Sharjah serves as an industrial, educational, cultural and major residential centre. ===Vietnam=== *Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Region: comprising Ho Chi Minh City (itself comprising the inner districts, Nh\u00e0 B\u00e8, B\u00ecnh Ch\u00e1nh, H\u00f3c M\u00f4n, C\u1ee7 Chi and C\u1ea7n Gi\u1edd); B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng (itself comprising Th\u1ee7 D\u1ea7u M\u1ed9t, B\u1ebfn C\u00e1t, T\u00e2n Uy\u00ean, Thu\u1eadn An, D\u0129 An); \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai (itself comprising Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a and Long Kh\u00e1nh); B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u (itself comprising V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba, and Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9); T\u00e2y Ninh (T\u00e2y Ninh); Long An (itself comprising T\u00e2n An and Ki\u1ebfn T\u01b0\u1eddng); B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc (itself comprising \u0110\u1ed3ng Xo\u00e0i, B\u00ecnh Long and Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Long); Ti\u1ec1n Giang (itself comprising M\u1ef9 Tho, Cai L\u1eady and G\u00f2 C\u00f4ng) *Hanoi Metropolitan Region: comprising H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i and the former province of H\u00e0 T\u00e2y (itself comprising H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i's urban districts, Gia L\u00e2m, \u0110\u00f4ng Anh, M\u00ea Linh, S\u00f3c S\u01a1n, H\u00e0 \u0110\u00f4ng and S\u01a1n T\u00e2y); B\u1eafc Ninh (itself comprising T\u1eeb S\u01a1n and B\u1eafc Ninh); Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean (itself comprising Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean, S\u00f4ng C\u00f4ng and Ph\u1ed5 Y\u00ean); V\u0129nh Ph\u00fac (itself comprising Ph\u00fac Y\u00ean and V\u0129nh Y\u00ean); Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd (itself comprising Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd and Vi\u1ec7t Tr\u00ec); H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh (H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh); H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean (\u00edtelf comprising H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean and M\u1ef9 H\u00e0o); H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng (itself comprising Ch\u00ed Linh and H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng); B\u1eafc Giang (B\u1eafc Giang) and Ph\u1ee7 L\u00fd (H\u00e0 Nam) * Qui Nh\u01a1n-Nha Trang-\u0110\u00e0 L\u1ea1t Conurbation Belt: comprising Qui Nh\u01a1n, An Nh\u01a1n (B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh), S\u00f4ng C\u1ea7u, Tuy H\u00f2a (Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean), Ninh H\u00f2a, Nha Trang, Cam Ranh (Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a), Phan Rang (Ninh Thu\u1eadn) and \u0110\u00e0 L\u1ea1t (L\u00e2m \u0110\u1ed3ng) * Hu\u1ebf-Da Nang-Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Conurbation Belt: comprising Hu\u1ebf, H\u01b0\u01a1ng Tr\u00e0, H\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ee7y (Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean - Hu\u1ebf), \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng, H\u1ed9i An, Tam K\u1ef3, \u0110i\u1ec7n B\u00e0n (Qu\u1ea3ng Nam), and Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i (Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i) ==Europe== ===Belgium=== The Flemish Diamond () is the Flemish reference to a network of four metropolitan areas in Belgium, three of which are in the central provinces of Flanders, together with the Brussels Capital Region. It consists of four agglomerations which form the four corners of a diamond shape: Brussels, Ghent, Antwerp and Leuven. Over five million people live in this conurbation, with a population density of more than 800 per square kilometre. Actually, given the high level of commuting from and to Brussels every day, supported by one of the densest networks of railways and motorways in the world, It could be easily argued that the whole Belgium and Luxembourg area is one conurbation or is becoming one. ===France=== The most notable conurbation is Lille-Roubaix-Tourcoing- Villeneuve-d'Ascq, located in the north of France, with over 1.2 million people living in the area. That conurbation is actually an international one as Belgian cities such as Tournai are increasingly playing the role of commuter town for Lille. ===Germany=== Rhine-Ruhr, the largest conurbation of the European continent Germany has three conurbations along the River Rhine, namely Rhine-Main, Rhine-Neckar and Rhine-Ruhr. The Rhine-Ruhr is the largest conurbation in continental Europe and is a densely populated polycentric metropolitan region in the western part of Germany, comprising the three subregions of Ruhr Metropolitan Region, D\u00fcsseldorf-M\u00f6nchengladbach-Wuppertal Region and Cologne/Bonn Metropolitan Region. These three are all interlinked by a continuous urban settlement, while at the same time having cultural and economic differences. ===Italy=== Naples metropolitan area, that includes the whole metropolitan city of Naples, Caserta, Salerno and several other municipalities. ===Malta=== Valletta Urban Area, the area around the Grand Harbour, is the main conurbation in Malta. It contains 27 of the Malta's 68 local councils including the capital Valletta. According to the Demographia, Valletta Urban Area has a population of 300,000,World Urban Areas \u2013 Demographia, 2014 while the European Spatial Planning Observation Network states that the functional urban area of Valletta has a population of 355,000,Study on Urban Functions \u2013 European Spatial Planning Observation Network, 2007 which represents about 75% of Malta's population. ===Netherlands=== The Randstad is a densely populated area in the Netherlands with over 7 million inhabitants. It consists of a cluster of the four most populous cities of the country (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht) as well as several smaller cities, towns and urbanized villages. ===Poland=== Katowice Urban Area (aglomeracja katowicka', konurbacja g\u00f3rno\u015bl\u0105ska, GOP) is the largest conurbation in Poland, located in Upper Silesia, southern Poland. Around 5,294,000 million people live in the region -- up 5.26% of the population of Poland. ===Spain=== *The conurbation of Barcelona. *The conurbation of Bilbao. ===United Kingdom=== 2011 Rural Urban classification by Local Authority Districts in England 2011 Rural Urban classification by census Output Areas in England Industrial and housing growth in the United Kingdom during the 19th and early 20th centuries produced many conurbations. Greater London is by far the largest urban area and is usually counted as a conurbation in statistical terms, but differs from the others in the degree to which it is focused on a single central area. In the mid-1950s the Green Belt was introduced to stem the further urbanisation of the countryside in South East England. The list below shows the most populous urban areas in the UK as defined by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The Greater London Urban Area contains the whole of what is commonly called London, but ONS definitions divide London into a large number of smaller localities of which the largest is Croydon. *Important Note: This lists UK urban areas only and excludes UK conurbations by definition of the term. As used in the UK, the term \"conurbation\" is closer to the meaning of urban agglomeration. For example, the Liverpool-Manchester or the Manchester-Liverpool conurbation is defined as one conurbation by AESOP in a comparison report published by the University of Manchester in 2005 found here. The Liverpool-Manchester Conurbation has a population of 5.68 million. ==Oceania== ===Australia=== ====Canberra- Queanbeyan==== A cross border built-up area compromising of the nation's capital Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory and the city of Queanbeyan in New South Wales, which is considered by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to have a single labour market. ====NSW, Newcastle (and Hunter and Central Coasts), Sydney, Wollongong==== The Region of New South Wales extends from Newcastle-Maitland and surrounding satellite towns of the Hunter Valley through the Central Coast towns broken only by waterways and national parks through to the greater Sydney Metropolitan area and the Wollongong urban area.
