    "text": "The 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League was the 46th season of Europe's secondary club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the eighth season since it was renamed from the UEFA Cup to the UEFA Europa League. The final was played between Ajax and Manchester United at the Friends Arena in Solna, Sweden. Manchester United beat Ajax 2\u20130 to win their first title. With this victory, they became the fifth club \u2013 after Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea \u2013 to have won all three major European trophies (European Champion Clubs' Cup/UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League, and the now-defunct Cup Winners' Cup). Manchester United qualified for the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League, and also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid, in the 2017 UEFA Super Cup. As the title holders, Sevilla qualified for the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League. Winning the last three tournaments, Sevilla were unable to defend their titles after reaching the competition's knockout stage. ==Association team allocation== A total of 188 teams from 54 of the 55 UEFA member associations were expected to participate in the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League (the exception being Kosovo, whose participation was not accepted in their first attempt as UEFA members). The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: *Associations 1\u201351 (except Liechtenstein) each had three teams qualify. ** As the winners of the 2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League, Sevilla qualified for the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League; the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League berth they would otherwise have earned for finishing 7th in the 2015\u201316 La Liga was vacated and not passed to another Spanish team. *Associations 52\u201353 each had two teams qualify. *Liechtenstein and Gibraltar each had one team qualify (Liechtenstein organises only a domestic cup and no domestic league; Gibraltar as per decision by the UEFA Executive Committee). *Moreover, 33 teams eliminated from the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League were transferred to the Europa League. The UEFA Executive Committee approved in December 2014 changes to the rewards given according to the Respect Fair Play ranking, and starting from the 2016\u201317 season, the three Fair Play berths were no longer allocated to the Europa League. ===Association ranking=== For the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2015 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2010\u201311 to 2014\u201315. Apart from the allocation based on the country coefficients, associations could have additional teams participating in the Europa League, as noted below: * \u2013 Additional teams transferred from Champions League * \u2013 Vacated berth due to Europa League title holders playing in Champions League {| |-valign=top style=\"font-size:90%\" | {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Rank !Association !Coeff. !Teams !Notes |- !1 | Spain |align=right|99.999 |align=center rowspan=19|3 | |- !2 | England |align=right|80.391 | |- !3 | Germany |align=right|79.415 | |- !4 | Italy |align=right|70.510 | |- !5 | Portugal |align=right|61.382 | |- !6 | France |align=right|52.416 | |- !7 | Russia |align=right|50.498 | |- !8 | Ukraine |align=right|45.166 | |- !9 | Netherlands |align=right|40.979 | |- !10 | Belgium |align=right|37.200 | |- !11 | Switzerland |align=right|34.375 | |- !12 | Turkey |align=right|32.600 | |- !13 | Greece |align=right|31.900 | |- !14 | Czech Republic |align=right|29.125 | |- !15 | Romania |align=right|26.299 | |- !16 | Austria |align=right|25.675 | |- !17 | Croatia |align=right|23.500 | |- !18 | Cyprus |align=right|22.300 | |- !19 | Poland |align=right|21.500 | |} | {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Rank !Association !Coeff. !Teams !Notes |- !20 | Israel |align=right|21.000 |align=center rowspan=18|3 | |- !21 | Belarus |align=right|20.750 | |- !22 | Denmark |align=right|19.800 | |- !23 | Scotland |align=right|17.900 | |- !24 | Sweden |align=right|17.725 | |- !25 | Bulgaria |align=right|16.750 | |- !26 | Norway |align=right|14.375 | |- !27 | Serbia |align=right|13.875 | |- !28 | Slovenia |align=right|13.625 | |- !29 | Azerbaijan |align=right|12.500 | |- !30 | Slovakia |align=right|11.250 | |- !31 | Hungary |align=right|11.000 | |- !32 | Kazakhstan |align=right|10.375 | |- !33 | Moldova |align=right|10.000 | |- !34 | Georgia |align=right|9.375 | |- !35 | Finland |align=right|8.200 | |- !36 | Iceland |align=right|8.000 | |- !37 | Bosnia and Herzegovina |align=right|7.500 | |} | {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Rank !Association !Coeff. !Teams !Notes |- !38 | Liechtenstein |align=right|6.000 |align=center|1 | |- !39 | Macedonia |align=right|5.875 |align=center rowspan=13|3 | |- !40 | Republic of Ireland |align=right|5.750 | |- !41 | Montenegro |align=right|5.625 | |- !42 | Albania |align=right|5.375 | |- !43 | Luxembourg |align=right|5.125 | |- !44 | Northern Ireland |align=right|4.875 | |- !45 | Lithuania |align=right|4.500 | |- !46 | Latvia |align=right|4.250 | |- !47 | Malta |align=right|4.208 | |- !48 | Estonia |align=right|3.500 | |- !49 | Faroe Islands |align=right|3.500 | |- !50 | Wales |align=right|2.875 | |- !51 | Armenia |align=right|2.750 | |- !52 | Andorra |align=right|0.833 |align=center rowspan=2|2 | |- !53 | San Marino |align=right|0.499 | |- !54 | Gibraltar |align=right|0.250 |align=center|1 | |- !55 | Kosovo |align=right|0.000 |align=center|0 | |} |} ;Notes ===Distribution=== In the default access list, Sevilla enter the third qualifying round (as the seventh- placed team of the 2015\u201316 La Liga). However, since they qualified for the Champions League as the Europa League title holders, the spot which they qualified for in the Europa League third qualifying round is vacated, and the following changes to the default allocation system are made: *The domestic cup winners of association 18 (Cyprus) are promoted from the second qualifying round to the third qualifying round. *The domestic cup winners of associations 27 and 28 (Serbia and Slovenia) are promoted from the first qualifying round to the second qualifying round. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !Teams entering in this round !Teams advancing from previous round !Teams transferred from Champions League |- !First qualifying round (96 teams) | *26 domestic cup winners from associations 29\u201354 *35 domestic league runners-up from associations 18\u201353 (except Liechtenstein) *35 domestic league third-placed teams from associations 16\u201351 (except Liechtenstein) | | |- !Second qualifying round (66 teams) | *10 domestic cup winners from associations 19\u201328 *2 domestic league runners-up from associations 16\u201317 *6 domestic league fourth-placed teams from associations 10\u201315 | *48 winners from first qualifying round | |- !Third qualifying round (58 teams) | *6 domestic cup winners from associations 13\u201318 *9 domestic league third-placed teams from associations 7\u201315 *5 domestic league fourth- placed teams from associations 5\u20139 *3 domestic league fifth-placed teams from associations 4\u20136 (League Cup winners for France) *3 domestic league sixth- placed teams from associations 1\u20133 (League Cup winners for England) *\u22121 Europa League title holders | *33 winners from second qualifying round | |- !Play-off round (44 teams) | | *29 winners from third qualifying round | *15 losers from Champions League third qualifying round |- !Group stage (48 teams) | *12 domestic cup winners from associations 1\u201312 *1 domestic league fourth-placed team from association 4 *3 domestic league fifth-placed teams from associations 1\u20133 | *22 winners from play-off round | *10 losers from Champions League play-off round |- !Knockout phase (32 teams) | | *12 group winners from group stage *12 group runners-up from group stage | *8 third-placed teams from Champions League group stage |} ====Redistribution rules==== A Europa League place is vacated when a team qualifies for both the Champions League and the Europa League, or qualifies for the Europa League by more than one method. When a place is vacated, it is redistributed within the national association by the following rules (regulations Articles 3.03 and 3.04): *When the domestic cup winners (considered as the \"highest-placed\" qualifier within the national association with the latest starting round) also qualify for the Champions League, their Europa League place is vacated. As a result, the highest-placed team in the league which have not yet qualified for European competitions qualify for the Europa League, with the Europa League qualifiers which finish above them in the league moved up one \"place\". *When the domestic cup winners also qualify for the Europa League through league position, their place through the league position is vacated. As a result, the highest-placed team in the league which have not yet qualified for European competitions qualify for the Europa League, with the Europa League qualifiers which finish above them in the league moved up one \"place\" if possible. *For associations where a Europa League place is reserved for the League Cup winners, they always qualify for the Europa League as the \"lowest-placed\" qualifier. If the League Cup winners have already qualified for European competitions through other methods, this reserved Europa League place is taken by the highest-placed team in the league which have not yet qualified for European competitions. ===Teams=== The labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round: *CW: Cup winners *2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, etc.: League position *LC: League Cup winners *RW: Regular season winners *PW: End-of-season European competition play-offs winners *CL: Transferred from Champions League **GS: Third-placed teams from group stage

the qualifying, play-off, and knockout rounds could also be played on Tuesdays or Wednesdays instead of the regular Thursdays due to scheduling conflicts. ==Qualifying rounds== In the qualifying rounds and the play-off round, teams were divided into seeded and unseeded teams based on their 2016 UEFA club coefficients, and then drawn into two-legged home-and-away ties. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. ===First qualifying round=== The draws for the first and second qualifying round were held on 20 June 2016. The first legs were played on 28 and 30 June, and the second legs were played on 5, 6 and 7 July 2016. ===Second qualifying round=== The first legs were played on 14 July, and the second legs were played on 20 and 21 July 2016. ===Third qualifying round=== The draw for the third qualifying round was held on 15 July 2016. The first legs were played on 28 July, and the second legs were played on 3 and 4 August 2016. ==Play-off round== The draw for the play-off round was held on 5 August 2016. The first legs were played on 17 and 18 August, and the second legs were played on 25 August 2016. ==Group stage== The draw for the group stage was held on 26 August 2016, at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco. The 48 teams were drawn into twelve groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on their 2016 UEFA club coefficients. In each group, teams play against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advance to the round of 32, where they are joined by the eight third-placed teams of the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League group stage. The matchdays are 15 September, 29 September, 20 October, 3 November, 24 November, and 8 December 2016. A total of 21 national associations are represented in the group stage. Astana, Celta Vigo, Dundalk, Hapoel Be'er Sheva, Konyaspor, Mainz 05, Manchester United, Nice, Olympiacos, Osmanl\u0131spor, Sassuolo, Southampton and Zorya Luhansk made their debut appearances in the UEFA Europa League group stage (although Celta Vigo and Olympiacos had appeared in the UEFA Cup group stage and Manchester United and Olympiacos had already competed in the UEFA Europa League knockout phase after a third place in the UEFA Champions League group stage). {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" |- !Tiebreakers |- |The teams are ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied in the order given to determine the rankings (regulations Article 16.01): #higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question; #superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question; #higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question; #higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question; #if, after having applied criteria 1 to 4, teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 4 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 6 to 12 apply; #superior goal difference in all group matches; #higher number of goals scored in all group matches; #higher number of away goals scored in all group matches; #higher number of wins in all group matches; #higher number of away wins in all group matches; #lower disciplinary points total based only on yellow and red cards received in all group matches (red card = 3 points, yellow card = 1 point, expulsion for two yellow cards in one match = 3 points); #higher club coefficient. |} ===Group A=== ===Group B=== ===Group C=== ===Group D=== ===Group E=== ===Group F=== ===Group G=== ===Group H=== ===Group I=== ===Group J=== ===Group K=== ===Group L=== ==Knockout phase== In the knockout phase, teams play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The mechanism of the draws for each round is as follows: *In the draw for the round of 32, the twelve group winners and the four third-placed teams from the Champions League group stage with the better group records are seeded, and the twelve group runners-up and the other four third-placed teams from the Champions League group stage are unseeded. The seeded teams are drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association cannot be drawn against each other. *In the draws for the round of 16 onwards, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association can be drawn against each other. ===Bracket=== ===Round of 32=== The draw for the round of 32 was held on 12 December 2016. The first legs were played on 16 February, and the second legs were played on 22 and 23 February 2017. ===Round of 16=== The draw for the round of 16 was held on 24 February 2017. The first legs were played on 9 March, and the second legs were played on 16 March 2017. ===Quarter-finals=== The draw for the quarter-finals was held on 17 March 2017. The first legs were played on 13 April, and the second legs were played on 20 April 2017. ===Semi- finals=== The draw for the semi-finals was held on 21 April 2017.
