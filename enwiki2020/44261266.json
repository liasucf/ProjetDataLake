A very poor season for the club, which was disrupted by the sacking after only eight rounds of third-year coach Mick Malthouse, Carlton finished last on the ladder with a record of 4\u201318. ==Club summary== The 2015 AFL season was the 119th season of the VFL/AFL competition since its inception in 1897; and, having competed in every season, it was also the 119th season contested by the Carlton Football Club. Carlton's primary home ground for games was the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with the club hosting six matches at the venue and five at Etihad Stadium \u2013 a small change from the previous season, when the club had played six games at Etihad Stadium and five at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Traditional home ground at Princes Park (which was renamed from Visy Park to Ikon Park from the start of the year under a two-year naming rights deal with Ikon Services Australia) continued to serve as the training and administrative base. Carlton continued its alignment with the Northern Blues in the Victorian Football League, allowing Carlton-listed players to play with the Northern Blues when not selected in AFL matches. Following an online vote of members, the club changed the font of the CFC monogram on the front of its playing guernsey. The new monogram, more traditional in style, featured block-style letters and no gaps at the intersections between letters; it matched the design which had been used between 1927 and 1997, and which had thrice been worn as a heritage guernsey during the 2014 season. The club's membership for the 2015 season was 47,305, a 0.4% reduction from the 2014 membership of 47,485; it was Carlton's second consecutive reduction in membership, and the club was one of only three clubs to suffer a drop in membership in the 2015 season. The club made a net operating loss of $2,700,000 for the season. ==Senior Personnel== Mark LoGiudice continued as club president, a role he has held since June 2014. Mick Malthouse began the season as senior coach, with his coaching panel unchanged from 2014; following his Malthouse dismissal on 26 May, backline assistant coach John Barker stepped in as caretaker. Marc Murphy continued into his third season as club captain, as part of a five-man leadership group, a reduction from the seven-man group which led the team in 2014. Bryce Gibbs, Lachlan Henderson and Michael Jamison remained in the group from 2014 \u2013 Gibbs and Jamison were named vice-captains \u2013 and Sam Rowe was elevated to the group. Leaving the group were Andrew Carrazzo and Kade Simpson, who both stepped down from the group after serving in it for many years, and Brock McLean, who was delisted. ==Squad for 2015== Flags represent the state of origin, i.e. the state in which the player played his Under-18s football. {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:90%; border- collapse:collapse; width:100%;\" |-style=\"background:#C1D8FF; text- align:center;\" ! colspan=\"17\"| Senior List |- | rowspan=\"2\"| No. | rowspan=\"2\"| State | rowspan=\"2\"| Player | rowspan=\"2\"| Age | rowspan=\"2\"| AFL Debut | rowspan=\"2\"| Recruited from | colspan=\"2\"| Career (to end 2014) | colspan=\"9\"| 2015 Player Statistics |- !

The club fell to last place after Round 7, won one of its first eight games \u2013 against defending wooden spooner in Round 4 \u2013 and lost four games by more than ten goals. The turndown in form placed significant pressure on Carlton's off-field organisation. The club had engaged in optimistic preseason marketing, which included Mick Malthouse telling the media that \"it\u2019s very, very difficult to see where we\u2019re going to lose a game\"; but after only the second round, a 69-point loss against West Coast, Steven Trigg and Mark LoGiudice publicly declared that the club was in a phase of rebuilding. The following weeks were characterised by poor performances and low crowds, which resulted in speculation about Malthouse's coaching future with the club. Early in the season, LoGiudice guaranteed that Malthouse would retain his job until the end of the season, but on May 25, he announced a revised position that Malthouse's tenure would be reviewed during the Round 11 bye week. The following morning, Malthouse gave an interview on SEN 1116 in which he was openly critical of the club's administration: he blamed the club's poor performances in part on the psychological effect of Trigg's and LoGiudice's talk of rebuilding; he said he believed LoGiudice's administration had never intended to retain him as coach even before the season began; and he made allegations that , during Carlton CEO Steven Trigg's tenure there, had illegally signed a contract with Eddie Betts eighteen months before he became an eligible free agent (Betts had transferred from Carlton to Adelaide at the end of 2013 as a restricted free agent, and the AFL dismissed Malthouse's allegations). Consequently, Malthouse was dismissed that afternoon. Backline assistant coach John Barker was installed as caretaker coach for the remainder of the season. The club's performances improved over the following six weeks, with two wins and two close losses, but the end of the season was little better than the start, and Carlton won only one of its last ten matches, finishing last on percentage. It was Carlton's first last place finish since 2006, and the fourth in the club's VFL/AFL history. Across the season, Carlton had a record of 3\u20133 in six matches against other clubs in the bottom six, all of whom won seven or fewer games for the season. Against all other clubs, Carlton's record was 1\u201315, the sole win coming against 9th-placed . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" |- | rowspan=2| Rd | rowspan=2|Date and local time | rowspan=2| Opponent | colspan=3| Scores (Carlton's scores indicated in bold) | rowspan=2| Venue | rowspan=2| Attendance | rowspan=2| Ladder position |- !
