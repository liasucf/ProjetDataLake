    "text": "\"Yes\" (stylized in all caps) is a song by American rappers Fat Joe and Cardi B and Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA. The song was released on September 6, 2019, as the second single from Fat Joe and Dre's collaborative album, Family Ties (2019). ==Background and composition== About the creation of \"Yes\", Fat Joe said that \"this one is special, you know what I'm sayin? Puff Daddy told me and Cool way back in the day that every hit record has a story, and geeze ... let's just put it this way: This one was months in the making, but it was worth the wait ... I think y'all really gonna fuck with it\". \"Yes\" is a bilingual hip hop song, with Anuel AA's verse being entirely in Spanish. Cardi B rebrands herself as \u201cLa Caldi\u201d on the song. \"Yes\" uses a sample of the 1972 hit song \"Aguanil\u00e9\", by salsa musicians H\u00e9ctor Lavoe and Willie Col\u00f3n, throughout the song. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| Various | September 6, 2019 | | |} ==References== Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Fat Joe songs Category:Cardi B songs Category:Anuel AA songs Category:Song recordings produced by Cool & Dre Category:Empire Distribution singles ",
