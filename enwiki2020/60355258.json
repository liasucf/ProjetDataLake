    "text": "The 2018 Overwatch League playoffs began on July 11, after the 2018 Overwatch League regular season ended, and concluded on July 28 with the 2018 Grand Finals, the first championship match of the Overwatch League (OWL). Six teams competed in the OWL Playoffs. The winner of each round of the Playoffs was determined by a best-of-three match series, with match determined by best-of- five maps. The Quarterfinals had the third-seeded team playing the sixth- seeded team, while the fourth-seeded team played the fifth-seeded team. In the Semifinals, the top-seed team played the lowest remaining seed, while the second-seeded team played the next-lowest. The winners advanced to the Grand Finals, which took place at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York on July 27-28. London Spitfire defeated Philadelphia Fusion in the Grand Finals to become the first Overwatch League Champions. == Map pool and rotation == The postseason map pool consisted of eight maps, with a ninth map as the tie- breaking map (if necessary), and was decided by a lottery system on June 19. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 95%;\" |- ! ! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Map 1 ! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Map 2 ! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Map 3 ! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Map 4 ! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Map 5 |- !

The two division leaders were awarded the top two seeds, and the following top four teams, regardless of division, were awarded seeds three through six. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center; width:500px; \" |- !

Fusion used a tank-heavy roster, including Reinhardt played by Sado, which forced the Uprising to move away from their sniper-based strategy. Fusion's Eqo and Carpe also showed skill across several heroes to help with the victory. {| class=\"wikitable \" style=\"font-size: 95%; width:100%;\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Philadelphia won series 2-1 |} === (4) Los Angeles Gladiators vs. (5) London Spitfire === The Spitfire had been underdogs in their match against the Gladiators, having never won a regular season match against them. The Gladiators took the first match, 3-0, including a trick play that involved Surefour staying in the spawn room as a different hero until well into the match before changing to his regular Widowmaker hero and readily picking off the open Spitfire players. The Spitfire responded in the following matches with adaptive changes in their team composition that prevented the Gladiators from maintaining their defense lines. Notably, the Gladiators chose to bench their primary main tank player Fissure, who came second place for Season MVP, for the playoffs, opting instead to replace him with the team's other main tank player, . The official reason given for this decision was that \"the Gladiators believe that the most effective practice and preparation is necessary in order to perform well in playoffs.\" {| class=\"wikitable \" style=\"font-size: 95%; width:100%;\" | style=\"text- align:center;\" | London won series 2-1 |} == Semifinals == After each quarterfinal series, the sixth-seeded Fusion, being the lowest seed of the two quarterfinals winners, faced the top-seeded Excelsior, whereas the fifth- seeded Spitfire played against the second-seeded Los Angeles Valiant. The semi-final saw upsets in both brackets with the lower-seed Fusion and Spitfire winning over the top seeds Excelsior and Valiant. === (1) New York Excelsior vs. (6) Philadelphia Fusion === Fusion had taken the first series 3\u20130 over Excelsior. While the second set ran for all five maps, Fusion won the series and the spot in the Grand Finals. {| class=\"wikitable \" style=\"font-size: 95%; width:100%;\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Philadelphia won series 2-0 |} === (2) Los Angeles Valiant vs. (5) London Spitfire === The Spitfire had kept their traction from the victory over the Gladiators in the previous round, and took their spot in the finals after two matches, winning each 3\u20131 and 3\u20130. {| class=\"wikitable \" style=\"font-size: 95%; width:100%;\" | style=\"text- align:center;\" | London won series 2-0 |} == Grand Finals == The London Spitfire defeated the Philadelphia Fusion in the Grand Finals series in 2 sets. The Spitfire's Jun-Young \"Profit\" Park was named the Grand Finals Most Valuable Player; Profit was observed to be a key offensive player in the series, in one match using Hanzo's ultimate ability to eliminate five of the six Fusion players. {| class=\"wikitable \" style=\"font-size: 95%; width:100%;\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" | London won series 2-0 |} == Winnings == Teams in the Season Playoffs competed for a total prize pool of , with the payout division detailed below. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font- size: 95%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 20px;\"| ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 190px;\"|Teams ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\"| |- | 1 || London Spitfire || $1,000,000 |- | 2 || Philadelphia Fusion || $400,000 |- | 3 || New York Excelsior || $100,000 |- | 4 || Los Angeles Valiant || $100,000 |- | 5 || Boston Uprising|| $50,000 |- | 6 || Los Angeles Gladiators || $50,000 |} == Broadcast and viewership == On the first day of the season playoffs, Disney and Blizzard announced a multi-year partnership that would bring the league and other professional Overwatch competitive events to ESPN, Disney XD, and ABC, starting with the playoffs and throughout all of the following season.
