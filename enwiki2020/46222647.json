Promotion began around a month before release. In Karnataka, the primary market for Kannada cinema, single-screen cinema owners refused to screen as they found the film not \"commercial enough\". On requests from the makers, distributors refused to take up the film for distribution, not anticipating profits. Subsequently, Naanu Avanalla...Avalu received support from actors Yash, Sudeep, Shiva Rajkumar, Puneeth Rajkumar, Sharan and Ganesh who promoted it on social media platforms. On watching the film and learning of the makers' woes, Yash persuaded distributors Jayanna and Bhogendra to distribute it, who had previously produced and distributed many of his films. Naanu Avanalla...Avalu also received support from and was promoted by directors Ram Gopal Varma and Girish Kasaravalli. With minimal support from single-screen owners, owners of multiplexes in Bangalore finally agreed to screen it. A few members of the Indian branch of Rotary International, the Rotary Club, offered their support by booking the first 10,000 tickets. ==Awards== IFFI (2015) {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Award !scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony !scope=\"col\"| Category !scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s) and nominee(s) !scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | National Film Awards |rowspan=\"2\" |3 May 2015 | Best Actor | Sanchari Vijay | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | Best Make-up Artist | Raju, Nagaraj | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | Karnataka State Film Awards |rowspan=\"2\" |2015 | Best Actor | Sanchari Vijay | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | Best Story | Living Smile Vidya | |- !scope=\"row\"| Bengaluru International Film Festival | February 2016 | Second Best Kannada Film | B.
