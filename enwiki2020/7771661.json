    "text": "The following 33 films, all from different countries, were submitted for the 65th Academy Awards in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film which took place in 1993. The titles in bold were the five nominated films, which came from Belgium, Germany, Russia, Uruguay and the eventual winner, Indochina, from France. The film A Place in the World submitted by Uruguay, was disqualified after the nominations were announced in early 1993, when it was discovered that the film was an overwhelmingly Argentine production with minimal input from Uruguayans. Argentina had selected another film to compete for the award, so director Adolfo Aristarain asked Uruguay (which had never entered the competition before) to submit it instead. The Argentine film did not get nominated. The A Place in the World was removed from the ballot (leaving only four films in contention for the award), leading the director to sue the Academy. For the first time films from the former USSR competed against each other in this category; Estonia, Kazakhstan, Latvia and the Russian Federation submitted their first-ever films. After being disqualified the previous year since the country was not yet internationally recognized, Croatia had a film accepted for the first time. ==Submissions== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\" |- !
