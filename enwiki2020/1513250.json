The French Navy does not use the term \"destroyer\" for its ships; hence some large ships, referred to as \"frigates\", are registered as destroyers. She was designed to protect a fleet against air threats, surface ships, submarines, and, to a lesser extent, provide firepower against land objectives. She is the sister-ship of . She is the eighth French vessel named after the 17th century admiral Abraham Duquesne. Her weapon systems bear names of battles to which Duquesne took part: Messine (turret n\u00b01), Palerme (turret n\u00b02), Alicuri (Malafon launcher), Agosta (Masurca launcher) and Stromboli (MM38 launcher). Duquesne was decommissioned in 2008, but has been retained for use as a training ship. == External links == * Fr\u00e9gate Duquesne on netmarine.net Category:Suffren-class frigates Category:Cold War frigates of France Category:Active frigates of France Category:1966 ships Category:Ships built in France ",
