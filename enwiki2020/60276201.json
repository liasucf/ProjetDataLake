    "text": "Two Nudes in a Forest is an oil painting by Mexican painter Frida Kahlo that was completed in 1939. It is also referred to as The Earth, Two Nudes in the Wood, or My Nanny and I. The painting was given to a close woman companion of Kahlo's, who some believe to be actress Dolores del R\u00edo. The two women in the painting also appear in Kahlo's painting What the Water Gave Me, completed a year earlier in 1938, and her spider monkey, which views the couple from the forest, also appears in Kahlo's 1937 Fulang-Chang and I. == Interpretations == The two naked women in the painting, one dark-skinned and one light-skinned, are viewed as representations of Kahlo's ethnic identity as connected to her indigenous roots, but also her European ancestry, something that is also explored in The Two Fridas.The painting also brings attention to Kahlo's bisexuality, something she expressed openly in her paintings, as in Self- Portrait with Cropped Hair, and in her sexual affairs. ==References== Category:Paintings by Frida Kahlo Category:1939 paintings Category:Monkeys in art ",
