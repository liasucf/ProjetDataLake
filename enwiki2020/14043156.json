    "text": "Phaethon is a steel inverted roller coaster at Gyeongju World in South Korea, which opened in 2007. It is South Korea's first inverted roller coaster. It named after the character in Greek mythology. == Track layout == The coaster starts with a 90 degree turn to the left leading to a 147 ft. lift hill. After coming across the pre-drop, the coaster goes through a drop which spirals 90 degrees to the left, followed by a vertical loop. The next inversion is a zero-g-roll, followed by a cobra roll over the pathway leading to the entrance. After the cobra roll, the riders go through a 360 degree helix over the entrance to the coaster. After the helix comes the first corkscrew followed by another corkscrew, and a 540 degree helix all leading up to the final brakes. The track layout is similar to Raptor at Cedar Point, except no block brake, and two corkscrews. ==References== ==External links== *http://rcdb.com/3935.htm * * Category:Roller coasters in South Korea Category:Roller coasters introduced in 2007 Category:Inverted roller coasters manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard ",
