    "text": "\"I Want You\" is a song by the American rock band Cheap Trick, released in 1982 as the second single from their sixth studio album One on One. The song was written by Rick Nielsen and produced by Roy Thomas Baker. It was released as a single in the Netherlands only, reaching No. 48 there. Despite the title's similarity to Cheap Trick's popular song \"I Want You to Want Me\", the song is not similar in any other way. No music video was created to promote the single. The single's B-side, \"Lookin' Out for Number One\", also appeared on One on One. ==Critical reception== In a review of One on One, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone singled out the song as one of the album's \"depressingly moronic cuts\". He commented: \"Robin Zander sounds as though he's undergoing total body electrolysis. His hollering is abetted by Nielsen's ultravolume ax thrashings and Roy Thomas Baker's acquiescent production. Not even the solid rhythm section of Bun E. Carlos and new bassist Jon Brant stands a chance against that kind of aural firepower.\" ==Track listing== ;7\" Single #\"I Want You\" - 3:30 #\"Lookin' Out for Number One\" - 4:14 ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1982) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Dutch Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|48 |} ==Personnel== ;Cheap Trick * Robin Zander - lead vocals, rhythm guitar * Rick Nielsen - lead guitar, backing vocals * Jon Brant - bass, backing vocals * Bun E.
