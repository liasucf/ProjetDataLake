He attended the Frunze Academy in 1981 and the General Staff Academy in 1992. In 1994, he was chief of staff and first deputy commander of the Separate Combined-Arms Army of Turkmenistan, after Soviet units in Turkmenistan passed under joint control between Russia and Turkmenistan. The Library of Congress Country Studies said that 'the Treaty on Joint Measures signed by Russia and Turkmenistan in July 1992 provided for the Russian Federation to act as guarantor of Turkmenistan's security and made former Soviet army units in the republic the basis of the new national armed forces.' Later he became Russia's first military representative at NATO Headquarters (from November 1997 to November 2001, according to Scott and Scott's Russian Military Directory 2002). He was there in post during the Kosovo War. He may have originated the 'dash to Pristina' idea that saw Russian troops, detached from the SFOR peacekeeping force in Bosnia-Hercegovina, arrive in Pristina before KFOR arrived there.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/nato-in- kosovo-the-fiveminute-hero--how-a-career-setback-sparked--the-generals-charge- to-pristina-1101388.html His final military appointment was First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Staff for Coordinating Military Cooperation of the Commonwealth of Independent States.Defence and Security, 21 June 2002, cited in Scott and Scott, Russian Military Directory 2002, 327.
