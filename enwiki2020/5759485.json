He was previously a White House correspondent. == Early life and education == Wallsten was brought up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1994. == Career == Wallsten started his career writing for the Miami Herald, St. Petersburg Times, Charlotte Observer and the Congressional Quarterly.

Wallsten joined The Wall Street Journal in 2009 as a national political reporter before moving to the Post to become a White House correspondent in 2010. He was appointed a senior politics editor in 2013. == Personal life == Wallsten is partially blind as a result of Stargardt disease, which is a genetically inherited form of macular degeneration. In June 2006, this caused an exchange of words with President George W. Bush at a White House press conference. Unaware of the journalist's medical condition, the president questioned Wallsten's need to wear sunglasses when the sun wasn't visible. Bush later apologized for the incident. ==References== == External links == *Some of Peter Wallsten's reporting * Category:Living people Category:Blind people from the United States Category:Los Angeles Times people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
