    "text": "Landsend Peak is a prominent wedge-shaped mountain located in the West Elk Mountains range northeast of Crawford, Colorado. The summit of Landsend Peak has an elevation of rising dramatically about above the valley below. Together with nearby Mount Lamborn to the northeast (the highest point in Delta County), it delineates the western edge of the West Elk Mountains (and West Elk Wilderness), and the two massifs top out about higher than the adjacent North Fork Gunnison River. Both peaks lie within the Gunnison National Forest near the physiographic boundary of the Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Plateau provinces. Geologically, Landsend Peak and Mount Lamborn are exposed igneous intrusions that geologists call laccoliths. ==References== ==External links== *Topographical map Category:Mountains of Delta County, Colorado Category:West Elk Mountains Category:Gunnison National Forest Category:North American 3000 m summits ",
