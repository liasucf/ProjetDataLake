    "text": "Nils Arne Eggen (born 17 September 1941) is a Norwegian former footballer, manager and teacher from Orkdal. Eggen is closely tied to Rosenborg, the club he managed for 23 years between 1970 and 2010. He is Norway's most successful club manager throughout history, having won the Norwegian top division fifteen times and the Norwegian Football Cup six times as a manager. His football philosophy is for offensive football in 4-3-3 formation inspired by total football. His playing career started with Orkdal; he then played for Rosenborg from 1960 to 1963 and 1966 to 1969, and for V\u00e5lerengen between 1964 and 1966. He was capped 29 times for Norway between 1963 and 1969. He won the Norwegian top division once with V\u00e5lerengen and twice with Rosenborg, and the Norwegian Football Cup once with Rosenborg. In 1971, Eggen became manager of Rosenborg, winning the league in his inaugural season. He left to take over Norway U21 in 1973. He then became national team manager for Norway jointly with Kjell Schou-Andreassen until 1977. He then returned to Rosenborg where he remained until 1982. He then coached Orkdal until 1985. In 1986, he was hired as manager for Moss, where he won the Second Division in the first season and then the top league the following. During this period he was also manager of Norway U23. He started managing Rosenborg in 1988, where he remained until 2002, except for a sabbatical in 1998. This is the team's golden age, resulting in 11 consecutive league titles and the participation in eight consecutive seasons in Champions League. Eggen returned a manager for the single 2010 season, again winning the league.Profile at Soccerway.com == Biography == === Playing career === Eggen began his active football career when he was 15 years old as a defender at Orkdal's senior team. Later on he moved to Trondheim to study, and joined Rosenborg. He played with them in winning the Norwegian Football Cup in 1960. In 1963 he moved to Oslo where he joined V\u00e5lerenga. They won the Norwegian top division in 1965, before he moved back to Trondheim where he played an important role for Rosenborg when they won the league twice \u2013 and he himself won the \"Player of the Year\" in 1968 \u2013 before retiring as a player. ===Coaching career=== Eggen was appointed as Rosenborg's coach, together with Tor R\u00f8ste Fossen, and in his first season (1971) they won \"the double\" for the first time ever in the club's history. In middle of the 1970s he was the coach for the Norwegian U21 national team, and later for the senior national team. In the 1978 World Cup qualifiers, home wins over Sweden and Switzerland put Norway in contention for qualification. A loss in their final game in Switzerland meant they missed out, and it was not until 1994 that they again came close to qualification. In 1978, he returned as coach in Rosenborg \u2013 the team struggling in Norway's second division at that time. Two years later the team once again was among the top teams in the first division. He returned to Rosenborg after being the coach of Moss in 1986\u201387. In his two years at Moss he first achieved promotion to the first division in 1986, and followed up by leading the club to their first and only league championship in 1987. Eggen resigned as manager for Rosenborg in 2002. Two of Eggen's last achievements was winning the Norwegian top division (11th time in a row), and qualifying for the European UEFA Champions League (8th time in a row). During his spell as manager Rosenborg also won the Norwegian football cup a number of times. He was again appointed by the club in November 2004 \u2013 this time as assistant manager/counsellor, a position he later stepped down from in 2005, when he admitted that his role hadn't worked as planned. In May 2010 he again took over as manager of Rosenborg after Erik Hamr\u00e9n took over as manager of Sweden national football team. As a caretaker manager until Jan J\u00f6nsson was available to take over, Eggen led Rosenborg to their 22nd Norwegian top flight victory. On 1 November 2011 he once again returned to coaching, this time for Orkla (former Orkdal) at the fifth level of Norwegian football. In only his first season as a coach, he had Orkla promoted to fourth tier, Third Division. In 2003, he was awarded the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav for his contributions to Norwegian football. == Football philosophy == Eggen has mentioned the inspiration of Dutch total football and Rinus Michels for his own work. A fundamental point was the subordination of individuals (the parts) to the whole, so that the whole could outperform the sum of talents of all its players. Often he has used the metaphor of the Rosenborg rhythm to get his message across. He has had a focus on quick and massive counter-attacks and the building of an offensive attitude in the team. The 4-3-3 system played vital parts in Eggen's philosophy as a coach. == Quotes == * \"It's hope in the hanging snore\" \u2013 having trouble translating a Norwegian proverb on an international press conference. * \"We play with two stoppers and three spisses\" \u2013 speaking about Rosenborg's tactics at a press conference before a Champions League game (stoppers meaning centre backs and spisses means forwards). * \"Congratulations, arse-football!\" \u2013 (Gratulerer, r\u00e6vva- fotball!), coining a new Norwegian term that's been popular ever since.
