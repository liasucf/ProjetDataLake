    "text": "In historical linguistics, a macrofamily, also called a superfamily or phylum, is a proposed genetic relationship grouping together language families (also isolates) in a larger scale classification.Campbell, Lyle and Mixco, Mauricio J. (2007), A Glossary of Historical Linguistics, University of Utah Press/Edinburgh University Press.Matthews, P.H. (2007), Oxford Concise Dictionary of Linguistics, Oxford University Press. However, CampbellCampbell, Lyle (2004), Historical Linguistics: An Introduction, Edinburgh University Press. regards this term as superfluous, preferring \"language family\" for those classifications for which there is consensus and \"distant genetic relationship\" for those for which there is no, or not yet, consensus, whether due to lack of documentation or scholarship of the constituent languages, or to an estimated time depth thought by many linguists to be too great for reconstruction. More rarely, the term has also been applied to an exceptionally old, large and diverse language family, such as Afro- Asiatic.Diakonoff, Igor M. (1996), \"Some reflections on the Afrasian linguistic macrofamily.\" Journal of Near Eastern Studies 55, 293\u2013294. Examples of proposed macro-familiesTrask, R.L. (2000), The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics, Edinburgh University Press. range from relatively recent such as East Asian, Macro-J\u00ea, Macro-Waikur\u00faan, Macro-Mayan, Macro- Siouan, Penutian, Na-Dene and Congo-Saharan (Niger-Saharan) to older ones such as Austric, Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian, Eurasiatic, Nostratic or Ural-Altaic. ==See also== *Father Tongue hypothesis *Classification schemes for Southeast Asian languages *Classification schemes for indigenous languages of the Americas *Borean languages ==References== Category:Historical linguistics Category:Paleolinguistics Category:Proposed language families ",
