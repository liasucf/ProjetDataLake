    "text": "Map with Hakra Ware sites in red Hakra Ware culture is a material culture which is contemporaneous with the early Harappan Ravi phase culture (3300\u20132800 BCE) of the Indus Valley. Hakra Ware culture is characterized by handmade vessels with mud and grit applied to the surface. The Hakra Wares culture also made structures in the form of subterranean dwelling pits, cut into the natural soil. The walls and floor of these pits were plastered with the yellowish alluvium of the Hakra valley. The first example was found near Jalilpur on the Ravi River about southwest of Harrappa in 1972. According to Rao, Hakra Ware has been found at Bhirrana, and is pre-Harappan, dating to the 8th\u20137th millennium BCE. ==See also== * Periodisation of the Indus Valley Civilisation * Rakhigarhi ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * Category:Indus Valley Civilisation ",
