    "text": "The Communist Labour Party of Turkey/Leninist (Turkish: T\u00fcrkiye Kom\u00fcnist Emek Partisi/Leninist) is an illegal communist party in Turkey. TKEP/L was founded on September 1, 1990, following a split in the Communist Labour Party of Turkey (TKEP). Whereas TKEP had started orientating itself towards legal work, TKEP/L wanted to continue armed struggle. It formed an armed wing, the Leninist Guerrilla Units (Leninist Gerila Birli\u011fi). LGB carries out occasional attacks, but does not engage in regular guerrilla warfare. The last major action by LGB was on December 19, 2000, when it attacked a MHP party office in Istanbul. One MHP member was killed and three injured. The attack was vengeance for the killing of two TKEP/L prisoners. TKEP/L has an organization inside the Turkish prisons, and TKEP/L prisoners have taken part in hunger strikes. The youth wing of TKEP/L is the 13 March Young Communist League (13 Mart Gen\u00e7 Kom\u00fcnistler Birli\u011fi). ==See also== * Bangladesh Communist Party (Leninist) * List of illegal political parties in Turkey * Communist Party of Turkey (disambiguation), for other groups using similar names ==References== ==External links== *Programme of TKEP/L Category:1990 establishments in Turkey Category:Anti-ISIL factions in Turkey Category:Banned communist parties Category:Banned political parties in Turkey Category:Communist militant groups Category:Communist parties in Turkey Category:Far-left politics in Turkey Category:International Freedom Battalion Category:Kurdish organisations Category:Left-wing militant groups in Turkey Category:Peoples' United Revolutionary Movement Category:Political parties established in 1990 Category:Political parties in the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria ",
