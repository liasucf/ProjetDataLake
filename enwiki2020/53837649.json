    "text": "The Madras Youth Choir, based in Chennai, India, is a non-profit, voluntary organization, is the brainchild of the late composer and pioneer of Indian Choral Music, Shri. M. B. Sreenivasan. It was founded in 1971 and is one of the oldest choirs of its kind in India. It is presently led by Shri. K.S. Subramanian, retired bureaucrat and translator of Tamil literature. The Secretary and other senior members are dedicated to the cause of spreading the movement of this genre of music. == Overview == The Madras Youth Choir consists of choristers from soprano to bass, practicing a variety of songs based on Indian classical and folk music idioms adapting western harmonic arrangements. The Madras Youth Choir is a recipient of an annual grant from the Sangeet Natak Akademi for its Community Singing Programme. Its significant repertoire consists of themes such as national integration, environment, children, social values and the awakening of youth. The choir sings in as many as ten languages and takes the songs of national poets to schools to train children to perform at special occasions. The Choir has been recognized as a reputed organization and has been called upon to perform in various places all over India, independently and along with regional youth choirs, as well as for Doordharshan and All India Radio. The Choir has also performed at Delhi under the auspices of Sangeet Natak Akademi on many occasions. Many corporate organizations, banks, private and voluntary institutions, continue to invite the Choir to perform for their special functions. == Work == MYC has released a twin album CD \"Pallupaduvomey\" which hopefully would augur well to beckon it toward the limelight. The Choir is taking efforts to convey the greatness of MBS\u2019s music in tangible terms to the public, in the staunch faith that once people are given the chance to appreciate the music in authentic terms, they will flock to it. MYC conducts workshops at regular intervals to create an awareness of this genre of music and also initiate those who may become interested in choral music once they got to know it better. MYC has preserved the verdant choral pieces of Shri. M. B. Sreenivasan long after his passing. This in itself is a testament of his inspiration, the vitality of his compositions and the group\u2019s undying devotion to the man and his music. MYC has now extended its activities to forming a Junior Group as well as a sub- junior group. Efforts are being made to also form a college choir drawing youth from various city colleges, who would be trained in this musical genre. == External links == * MYC website == References == Category:Culture of Chennai Category:Youth choirs Category:Indian choirs ",
