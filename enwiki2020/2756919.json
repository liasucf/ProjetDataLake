    "text": "A geometric modeling kernel is a 3D solid modeling software component used in computer-aided design packages. Available modelling kernels include: *ACIS is developed and licensed by Spatial Corporation of Dassault Syst\u00e8mes. *Romulus is licensed by Siemens and HP and was released in 1982. *SMLib is developed by Solid Modeling Solutions. *Convergence Geometric Modeler is developed by Dassault Syst\u00e8mes. *Parasolid is developed and licensed by Siemens. * ShapeManagerhttps://web.archive.org/web/20120315200548/http://www.autodesk.de/adsk/servlet/item?linkID=411015&id;=3774381&siteID;=403786 is developed by Autodesk and was forked from ACIS in 2001. * Granite is developed by Parametric Technology Corporation. *C3D Modeler is developed by C3D Labs, part of the ASCON Group. *CGAL is an opensource Computational Geometry Algorithms Library which has support for boolean operations on Polyhedra; but no sweep, revolve or NURBS. *Open CASCADE is an opensource modeling kernel. *sgCore is an opensource modeling kernel, with precompiled libraries only, for Windows only. *Open Inventor is both a proprietary and free and opensource modeling kernel. *Coin3D is an opensource modeling kernel library of the Open Inventor API. * K3 kernel is developed by Center GeoS. * SOLIDS++ is developed by IntegrityWare, Inc. * APM Engine is developed by RSDC APM. * Kubotek Kosmos (KCM) is developed by Kubotek3D subsidiary of Kubotek Corporation, released in 2016 and 2018. *SvLis Geometric Kernel became opensource and discontinued, for Windows only. *IRIT modeling environment, for Windows only. *GTS GNU Triangulated Surface Library, for polygon meshes only and not surfaces. *Russian Geometric Kernel. *FeatureScript is an opensource modeling feature kernel for cloud platforms, developed by Onshape. *Geometry Kernel , a multi-platform C++ library with source code accessible for clients, developed and distributed by RDF - Geometry Kernel web site. == Kernel market == The kernel market currently is dominated by Parasolid and ACIS, which were introduced in the late 1980s. The latest kernels to enter the market are C3D, developed in 1996, and Convergence Geometric Modeler, developed in 1998; they were introduced as standalone products in 2013 and 2011 perspectively. ShapeManager has no presence in the kernel licensing market and in 2001 Autodesk clearly stated they were not going into this business. The world's newest geometric modeling kernel is Russian Geometric Kernel owned by the Russian government, and it is not clear if it is going to be commercially available, despite offering unique features over the other kernels on the market. == Kernel developers == In the table below you can see a representative list of developers that belong to companies developing their own kernel or licensing the kernel from third-party . {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 95%; width: auto; table- layout: fixed;\" |- !
