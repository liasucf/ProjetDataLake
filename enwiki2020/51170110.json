What's particularly fascinating is hearing how the band adjusts to Gilberto's distinctive and subtle phrasing, his steady guitar pulse anchoring his delicate, fluid vocal melodies. While cuts like \"Chega de Saudade\" and \"Doralice\" retain all the warmth and beauty of the original 1964 recordings, at the Keystone Getz and his band color them in surprising yet still thoughtful ways. The result is an evening of organic, dreamlike splendor\". Writing in The Observer Dave Gelly said \"The original 1964 Getz/Gilberto album is a masterpiece, and this never reaches those heights, but there\u2019s something spellbinding about Gilberto\u2019s intensity when facing a live audience, close-up\".Gelly, D., Jo\u00e3o Gilberto: Getz/Gilberto '76 review \u2013 live, minimalist and spellbinding, February 14, 2016 ==Track listing== # Spoken Intro by Stan Getz - 1:09 # \"\u00c9 Preciso Perdoar\" (Carlos Coqueijo, Alcivando Luz) - 5:51 # \"Aguas de Mar\u00e7o\" (Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim) - 5:47 # \"Retrato em Branco e Preto\" (Jobim, Chico Buarque) - 4:48 # \"Samba da Minha Terra\" (Dorival Caymmi) - 3:21 # \"Chega de Saudade\" (Jobim, Vin\u00edcius de Moraes) - 3:43 # \"Rosa Morena\" (Caymmi) - 4:26 # \"Eu Vim da Bahia\" (Gilberto Gil) - 4:12 # \"Jo\u00e3o Marcelo\" (Jo\u00e3o Gilberto) - 3:21 # \"Doralice\" (Caymmi, Ant\u00f4nio Almeida) - 3:48 # \"Morena Boca de Ouro\" (Ary Barroso) - 3:34 # \"Um Abra\u00e7o No Bonf\u00e1\" (Gilberto) - 4:39 # \"\u00c9 Preciso Perdoar\" [Encore]\" (Coqueijo, Luz) - 6:28 == Personnel == *Jo\u00e3o Gilberto - guitar, vocals *Stan Getz - tenor saxophone *Joanne Brackeen - piano *Clint Houston - bass *Billy Hart - drums == References == Category:2016 live albums Category:Stan Getz live albums Category:Jo\u00e3o Gilberto live albums Category:Resonance Records live albums ",
