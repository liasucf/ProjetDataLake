    "text": "Wernigerode Hauptbahnhof () is a railway station in the municipality of Wernigerode, located in the Harz district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. leftIt is a through station on the Magdeburg-Goslar line, and is also the terminus of the Harzquerbahn, housing its headquarters and engine sheds. It thus attracts many steam enthusiasts and visitors to the Brocken. A bus station is sited to its south-east on Kleine Dammstra\u00dfe, and a carpark to its north-west, on Feldstra\u00dfe. Just west of the station is a remarkable three-level junction. A crossroads between Ochsenteichstra\u00dfe (B244) and Schlachthofstra\u00dfe is underground, the mainline and narrow-gauge railways are at ground level, and above them crosses a bicycle and footbridge with a spiral at either end. ==References== Category:Railway stations in Saxony-Anhalt Category:Buildings and structures in Harz (district) ",
