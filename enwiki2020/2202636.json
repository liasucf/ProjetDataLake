    "text": "Sir Lloyd George Geering (born 26 February 1918) is a New Zealand theologian who faced charges of heresy in 1967 for his controversial views. He considers Christian and Muslim fundamentalism to be \"social evils\". Geering is Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at Victoria University of Wellington. He turned 100 in February 2018. ==Biography== Geering was born in Rangiora, Canterbury, New Zealand, and \"embraced\" the Christian tradition in 1937.Morris and Grimshaw, 2008. Page 277 He holds a master's degree in mathematics and a Doctor of Divinity from the University of Otago. He was ordained as a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand (PCANZ) in 1943 and practised as a minister in Kurow; Opoho, Dunedin (1945-1950); and St James, Wellington (1950-1956) before turning to theological teaching. He was the Honorary Associate Minister of St John\u2019s Church in Wellington from 1971 to 1983. He was named Honorary Assistant at St Andrew\u2019s in Wellington in 1989. Geering remains on the Register (Fasti) of New Zealand Presbyterian Ministers. Geering has held the positions of Professor of Old Testament Studies Presbyterian Church Hall Brisbane Queensland, Australia (1956-1960, Professor of Old Testament Studies Theological Hall Dunedin (29 February 1960 - December 1963), and Principal of Theological Hall Dunedin (12 December 1963 - 31 May 1971). In 1971, Geering became the Foundation Professor of Religious Studies at Victoria University of Wellington and held this position until his retirement in 1984 when he was appointed Professor Emeritus. In 1983 he became a Lecturer at the St Andrew\u2019s Trust for the Study of Religion and Society. In 1967 Geering gained a high profile when he was charged with \"doctrinal error\" and \"disturbing the peace and unity of the (Presbyterian) church\".Lloyd Geering speaking at Pitt Street Uniting Church, Sydney, in October 2004: \"In 1967, Lloyd Geering's writings on the resurrection of Jesus and the immortality of the soul, resulted in his being charged by the Presbyterian Church with \"doctrinal error\" and \"disturbing the peace of the church\" \u2013 which is more or less the same thing as a heresy charge \u2013 and we'll shortly be hearing about what happened there. Since then, he's gone on to challenge Christian orthodoxy perhaps even more profoundly, by questioning the distinction between the religious and the secular worlds.\" The case was brought before the 1967 General Assembly of the PCANZ, and dismissed without being much discussed.Geering says: \"But before there had been very much time for any adequate discussion of the real issues, a motion was put to the House, and later carried firmly on the voices \u2013 and it said that \u201cthe Assembly judges that no doctrinal error has been established, dismisses the charges and declares the case closed\u201d\". Lloyd Geering speaking at Pitt Street Uniting Church, Sydney, in October 2004 The charges were brought by a group of conservative laymen and a conservative minister. During his church trial, he claimed that the remains of Jesus lay somewhere in Palestine and that the resurrection had been wrongfully interpreted by churches as a resuscitation of the body of Jesus. He also rejects the notion that God is a supernatural being who created and continues to look over the world.The Last Western Heretic, produced in 2007 in New Zealand and Israel, aired on TV ONE, 12 January 2008 (Press release) Geering is a member of the Jesus Seminar and a participant in the Living the Questions program, an alternative to the evangelical Alpha course, which he views as dangerous indoctrination sadly growing among even mainstream churches. He is also a member of the Sea of Faith Network (New Zealand), and St Andrew's On The Terrace as well as Principal Lecturer at St Andrew's Trust for the Study of Religion and Society In the 1988 New Year Honours, Geering was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and in the 2001 New Year Honours he was made a Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to religious studies.
