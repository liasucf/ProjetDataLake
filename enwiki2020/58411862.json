    "text": "The Premio Biblioteca Breve is a literary award given annually by the publisher Seix Barral (now part of Grupo Planeta) to an unpublished novel in the Spanish language. Its prize is \u20ac30,000 and publication of the winning work. It is delivered in February, to a work from the preceding year. ==History== On 14 June 1958, a jury comprising literary critics Josep Maria Castellet and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Valverde, and editors (editorial director), Juan Petit (literary director) and Carlos Barral (director of the collection), gave the inaugural award in Sitges, Barcelona. As stated by members of the jury, it was intended to encourage young writers and the renewal of Spanish literature. Due to the death of Juan Petit in January 1964 (replaced as literary director by Gabriel Ferrater), the exile of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Valverde to Canada in 1967, and the death of V\u00edctor Seix in October of that year, the jury was joined by , Luis Goytisolo, and Juan Garc\u00eda Hortelano for subsequent editions. The bases were also modified: for a few years the award took Petit's name as a tribute. In the same way, the Spanish political situation dictated that, in some editions, eligibility was extended to any Iberian Romance language, although no works in Catalan or Portuguese were awarded. The 1971 edition's jury comprised Luis Goytisolo, Juan Rulfo, , and Pere Gimferrer, with Guillermo Cabrera Infante joining in 1972. However, in 1973 the award ceased to be given due to numerous internal factors (dissensions within the publisher) and external factors (problems with censorship). In 1998, Basilio Baltasar, the new literary director of Seix Barral (by this time part of Grupo Planeta), decided to reconvene the prize, with the aim of recovering the spirit with which it was born, trying to recognize both Spanish and Latin American authors. ==First era winners (1958\u20131972)== * 1958 \u2013 Las afueras by Luis Goytisolo (Spain) * 1959 \u2013 Nuevas amistades by Juan Garc\u00eda Hortelano (Spain) * 1960 \u2013 Declared vacant; finalists were Encerrados con un solo juguete by Juan Mars\u00e9 (Spain), La criba by Daniel Sueiro (Spain), and Los extraordinarios by Ana Mairena (Mexico) * 1961 \u2013 Dos d\u00edas de setiembre by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Caballero (Spain) * 1962 \u2013 The Time of the Hero by Mario Vargas Llosa (Peru) * 1963 \u2013 ' by Vicente Le\u00f1ero (Mexico) * 1964 \u2013 Vista de amanecer en el tr\u00f3pico by Guillermo Cabrera Infante (Cuba) * 1965 \u2013 ' by Juan Mars\u00e9 (Spain) ** Finalist: Betrayed by Rita Hayworth by Manuel Puig (Argentina) * 1966 \u2013 Not given * 1967 \u2013 A Change of Skin by Carlos Fuentes (Mexico) ** Finalist: El mercurio by (Spain) * 1968 \u2013 Pa\u00eds port\u00e1til by Adriano Gonz\u00e1lez Le\u00f3n (Venezuela) * 1969 \u2013 Una meditaci\u00f3n by Juan Benet * 1970 \u2013 Due to internal problems at the publisher, no award was given in this edition.
