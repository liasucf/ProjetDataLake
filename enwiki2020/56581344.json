    "text": "Kevin Adom Lokko (born 3 November 1995) is an English footballer who plays as a defender for League Two club Harrogate Town. Lokko began his career at Norwich City's academy, where he spent two years as an academy scholar and was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side during the 2012\u201313 season. He was released in May 2014 and joined Colchester United four months later, although injury meant he did not make any first-team appearances during his one season with the Essex club. Lokko gained his first experience of regular first-team football when he signed for National League side Welling United ahead of the 2015\u201316 season. He spent one year at Welling before joining another National League club in the form of Maidstone United in June 2016. After one season at Maidstone, Lokko signed for Stevenage in August 2017. He was immediately loaned to Dagenham & Redbridge before returning to Stevenage in February 2018, then joining Dover Athletic on loan later that month. Lokko joined Dover on a permanent basis in June 2018. Lokko became captain at Dover before joining Harrogate Town in 2020. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Lokko joined Norwich City's academy at the age of 15, signing a two-year deal as an academy scholar in the summer of 2012. He spent two years playing regularly for Norwich's U18 side and was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side during the 2012\u201313 season. Lokko was released by the club upon the expiry of his scholarship contract in May 2014. After being released by Norwich, Lokko went on trial at Colchester United in July 2014, playing in several U21 matches as well as in the first-team's final pre-season friendly ahead of the 2014\u201315 season. The trial period proved successful and Lokko signed a one-year deal on 19 August 2014, with the club stating he would join up with the U21 side. Although he began to train with the first-team, and was an unused substitute in two first-team matches in the opening months of the season, Lokko sustained a hip injury that kept him out of action for five months and did not make any first-team appearances during the season. He was released when his contract expired in May 2015. ===Welling United=== Ahead of the 2015\u201316 season, on 20 July 2015, Lokko signed a one-year deal with National League side Welling United. The move came about after Lokko had played in the club's opening two pre-season fixtures and was offered a contract following the trial. He made his debut for Welling in the club's first game of the season on 8 August 2015, playing the whole match in a 1\u20130 victory over Guiseley at Park View Road. Lokko scored his first competitive goal in Welling's 2\u20131 home win over Woking on 28 March 2016, his first-half header proving decisive in helping Welling end their 23-game winless run. He was a mainstay in the centre of defence throughout the campaign, making 42 appearances in all competitions, scoring once, in what would serve as Lokko's breakthrough season of regular first-team football. Lokko left the club when his contract expired in May 2016. ===Maidstone United=== Lokko subsequently signed for National League club Maidstone United on a free transfer on 3 June 2016. He rejected several offers from other National League sides prior to signing for Maidstone, stating he had \"done his research\" and was impressed by Maidstone's three promotions in four years under manager Jay Saunders. Lokko made his Maidstone debut in a 1\u20131 home draw with York City on the opening day of the 2016\u201317 season. He scored his first goal for the club at the end of that month, netting an injury-time winner in a 1\u20130 \"smash and grab\" away victory at Boreham Wood on 29 August 2016. Lokko scored twice in Maidstone's comfortable 4\u20132 win against Chester at the Gallagher Stadium on 18 February 2017, both of Lokko's goals coming in the first half of the match. He also scored in another 4\u20132 home win two weeks later, this time against Southport. Lokko's goal was Maidstone's fourth of the match, he brought the ball down from a high free-kick and then swivelled before \"sending a fine finish into the far side of the net\". He was almost ever-present during his one season at Maidstone, making 46 appearances in all competitions and scoring four times. ===Stevenage=== Four days before the start of the 2017\u201318 season, on 2 August 2017, Lokko signed for League Two side Stevenage for an undisclosed fee, joining the Hertfordshire club on a two-year deal. The move came about when Stevenage triggered a buyout clause in Lokko's contract after several other clubs had also shown interest in the player. Just two days after joining Stevenage, Lokko was loaned out to Dagenham & Redbridge of the National League on a season-long loan deal, in order for him to continue to gain first-team experience. Lokko made his Dagenham debut in the club's 2\u20131 home win against Barrow on 5 August 2017 and was awarded Man of the Match for his performance. He scored in consecutive games at the end of August in home fixtures against Ebbsfleet United and Bromley respectively. He was a regular in the centre of defence during his time at Dagenham, scoring two goals in 28 appearances in all competitions. Lokko was recalled by Stevenage at the start of February 2018, with Stevenage chairman Phil Wallace revealing that several transfer deadline day deals gave the club the opportunity to recall Lokko and ensure he was \"integrated in the squad on a daily basis ready for next season\". He made his debut for the club as an 85th-minute substitute in the club's 3\u20131 away defeat at Forest Green Rovers on 13 February 2018. A week after making his Stevenage debut, Lokko was loaned out to National League side Dover Athletic for the remainder of the 2017\u201318 campaign, Stevenage retaining an option to recall Lokko after 28 days if necessary. He made his debut for Dover in a 3\u20131 away loss at AFC Fylde on 24 February 2018, coming on as a 77th-minute substitute in the match. Lokko went on to make 12 appearances during the loan spell, scoring once, before returning to Stevenage at the end of the season where he was made available for transfer. ===Dover Athletic=== Lokko signed for Dover Athletic on a permanent basis on 27 June 2018, joining the club for an undisclosed fee. He made his second debut at Dover in the club's first match of the 2018\u201319 season, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1\u20130 defeat to Wrexham on 4 August 2018. Lokko scored his first goal of the campaign three days later, briefly giving Dover the lead from close-range in an eventual 2\u20132 draw with Bromley. He went on to play 42 times during his first full season at Dover, scoring six goals from defence, as the club ended the season nine games unbeaten to finish in 14th place in the National League. ===Harrogate Town=== On 14 August 2020, Lokko signed for Harrogate Town on a two-year contract. He scored on his debut for the club in an EFL Trophy tie against Grimsby Town on 8 September 2020. ==International career== Lokko was called up to the England C team, who represent England at non-league level, for their two fixtures in May 2017. He made his England C debut on 28 May 2017, playing the full match in a 2\u20131 win over Panjab FA at Damson Park. Two days later, he once again played the whole 90 minutes in a 1\u20131 draw with Jersey FA. ==Personal life== Born in England, Lokko is of Ghanaian descent. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Colchester United | 2014\u201315 |League One |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |Welling United | 2015\u201316 |National League |38||1||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1Appearance(s) in the FA Trophy||0||42||1 |- |Maidstone United | 2016\u201317 |National League |41||4||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0||46||4 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Stevenage | 2017\u201318 |League Two |2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- |Dagenham & Redbridge (loan) | 2017\u201318 |National League |25||2||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||28||2 |- |Dover Athletic (loan) | 2017\u201318 |National League |12||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||12||1 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Dover Athletic | 2018\u201319 |National League |39||6||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||42||6 |- |2019\u201320 |National League |27||3||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||1||29||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !78!!10!!3!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!2!!1!!83!!11 |- !colspan=3|Career total !184||17||11||0||0||0||6||1||201||18 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:English people of Ghanaian descent Category:Association football defenders Category:Colchester United F.C. players Category:Welling United F.C. players Category:Maidstone United F.C. players Category:Stevenage F.C. players Category:Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. players Category:Dover Athletic F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Footballers from Whitechapel ",
