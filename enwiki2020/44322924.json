PBS shared this sentiment and wrote \"I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s expressed concern about the wisdom of these subjects exposing their lives this much to uninformed viewer voyeurism. While I found much honesty and truth in this story of daily life in a region that has become a national sacrifice area, and am outraged at the way in which casual media stereotyping of the poor seems to justify continued neglect, I don\u2019t know that this film will launch a useful conversation.\" Conversely, Film Pulse was more positive in their review and wrote that it was \"a film that can be sad, frustrating, and uplifting all at once and a great debut from Jon Matthews.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2014 films Category:2014 documentary films Category:Films shot in West Virginia Category:2014 directorial debut films ",
