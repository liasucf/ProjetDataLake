Ortak\u00f6y is away from the district of Uludere and it is located in southeastern Turkey, just on the western border of the Hakkari province. Historically, it was located in the Assyrian region of Hakkari. ==History== The village used to be an ancient Assyrian tribe, part of Assyria, called \u0100rosh Taxtayta (Lower Arosh) within the historical Assyrian district of Tyari and was populated by Assyrian people up until Seyfo in 1914.http://www.aina.org/maps/chevalier/chevalier8.htm The Assyrian village \u0100rosh Alayta (Upper Arosh), now named Yukariarus, in Hakkari, is less than away, closely bordering the province of Sirnak. Halmon is around to the northeast in Anda\u00e7 and G\u00e9r\u0101mon to the northwest, just right next to Halmon. Assyrian inhabitants of these proximate villages have ever since intermixed. ==Population== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=200 ! colspan=2 |Population by years |- | align=\"center\" |2013 | align=\"right\" | 3,000 |- | align=\"center\" | 2007 | align=\"right\" | 1,082 |- | align=\"center\" | 2000 | align=\"right\" | 1,023 |- | align=\"center\" | 1997 | align=\"right\" | 734 |} ==See also== *Anda\u00e7, Uludere, the area that used to be Halmon and Geramon *\u00c7ukurca *Jilu, an Assyrian tribe in Hakkari *Baz, an Assyrian tribe in Hakkari *\u00c7\u0131\u011fl\u0131, \u00c7ukurca *Nochiya tribe ==References== Category:Assyrian communities in Turkey Category:Villages in \u015e\u0131rnak Province ",
