She lived during the 5th Dynasty and was named after Two Ladies, a pair of Egyptian goddesses who protected the pharaoh. == Biography == Meretnebty's parents are not known. She is depicted with her husband in his mortuary temple at Abusir.Tyldesley, Joyce. Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt. Thames & Hudson. 2006. p. 54 In the temple she is shown next to the mother of Sahure, Neferhetepes. Both holding their hands. That is a highly unusual depiction and might indicate a close relationship between both. Perhaps Neferhetepes was her mother.Vivienne Gae Callender: In Hathor's Image, The wives and mothers of Egyptian kings from Dynasties I-VI, Prague 2011, , p. 162-168 In the mortuary temple several sons are mentioned. Their names are Horemsaf, Netjerirenre, Khakare and Nebankhre. It is not clear if these princes are the sons of Meretnebty or possibly of another wife.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan.

However, the name there was partly destroyed and was reconstructed as Neferet-ha-Nebti or Neferetnebti.
