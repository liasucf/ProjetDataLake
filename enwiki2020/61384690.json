Prof. Srinivasan writes (p. 39): \"People use non-standard pronouns, or use pronouns in non-standard ways, for various reasons: to accord with their sense of themselves, to make their passage through the world less painful, to prefigure and hasten the arrival of a world in which divisions of sex no longer matter. So too we can choose to respect people's pronouns for many reasons.\" == References == Category:Yale University alumni Category:Alumni of Corpus Christi College, Oxford Category:American Rhodes Scholars Category:Fellows of All Souls College, Oxford Category:Chichele Professors of Social and Political Theory Category:Living people Category:Feminist philosophers Category:21st-century philosophers Category:Epistemologists Category:Political philosophers Category:1984 births ",
