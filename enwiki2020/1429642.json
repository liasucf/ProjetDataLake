The state's intent was not only to honor such large families but also to increase financial assistance for pregnant women, mothers of large families, and single mothers, and to promote an increased level of health in mother and child. The award was established in 1944 and continued to exist until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. ==Award history== USSR 1945 stamp The honorary title \"Mother Heroine\" was established on July 8, 1944 by Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Its statute, including multiple increases in available state pensions for these families or single mothers, was amended 15 times from its original establishment until the last amendment contained in Decree number 20 of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of May 7, 1986. ==Award statute== The honorary title \"Mother Heroine\" was awarded to mothers bearing and raising 10 or more children. The title was accompanied by the bestowal of the Order \"Mother Heroine\" and a certificate conferred by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

Children who had perished under heroic, military or other respectable circumstances, including occupational diseases, were also counted.
