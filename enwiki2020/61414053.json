He was expelled from his job following the 2016 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, after which a state of emergency (OHAL) was declared. Similarly, the academician Nuriye G\u00fclmen, who was dismissed as a result of the Decree Law, started a protest in front of the Human Rights Monument on Y\u00fcksel Street in Ankara to take her job back and \u00d6zak\u00e7a joined her on 23 November 2016. He later started a hunger strike with G\u00fclmen. During this period, \u00d6zak\u00e7a's weight fell from 86 kilos to 45 kilos and he ended the hunger strike on 26 January 2018 after the OHAL Commission rejected the objection regarding the issuance of the Decree Law. == Judicial process == On 22 June 2017, Semih \u00d6zak\u00e7a and Nuriye G\u00fclmen applied to the Constitutional Court of Turkey with the request for lifting their detention, as they had started to suffer from health issues due to the hunger strike. On 28 June, the Constitutional Court unanimously rejected the application by \u00d6zak\u00e7a and G\u00fclmen. In its response, the Court stated that \"there was no situation requiring an immediate injunction to terminate the applicants' detention as there was not any threat available to pose a danger to their lives, their material or moral integrity\". G\u00fclmen and \u00d6zak\u00e7a's health conditions in prison were monitored by physicians, and attempts to refer to them to a hospital for further control were rejected by G\u00fclmen and \u00d6zak\u00e7a, although measures were taken for emergencies and treatment at the prison's hospital. On 20 October 2017, following a court hearing in Ankara, \u00d6zak\u00e7a was released on condition of wearing electronic handcuffs. At the sixth hearing of the case, Semih \u00d6zak\u00e7a was acquitted of all the charges against which he was tried. ===Appeal to ECHR=== \u00d6zak\u00e7a, together with Nuriye G\u00fclmen, applied to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on 29 June 2017, demanding that they be released due to their health problems as a result of a hunger strike and adding that detention conditions worsened their health. On 2 August 2017, the European Court of Human Rights dismissed the application, which was submitted as a precautionary measure by \u00d6zak\u00e7a and G\u00fclmen's lawyers. The ECHR ruled in its rejection that \"in the light of the medical reports and other information submitted to the court, the fact that \u00d6zak\u00e7a and G\u00fclmen were detained at the Sincan State Hospital did not constitute a real and immediate danger to the applicants' life.\" The court also invited G\u00fclmen and \u00d6zak\u00e7a to end the hunger strike. \u015eebnem Korur Fincanc\u0131, who participated in the examination and medical documentation process as a single physician and presented a 32-page report, reacted by explaining what happened during the examination and certification process on her Twitter account and criticized the lack of reference to this medical document in making the decision: \"All doctors say there is a life- threatening need for care, but they respond they can be kept unattended in the prison hospital. On top of that, lawyers call on people who are mentally competent to end the hunger strike and they say, \"The state takes good care of you\". There is a lot of detail, but even so I think it can clearly show how the whole process is loaded with human rights violations. There is no single reference to a total of 32-page examination, medical documentation, and scientific opinions with many scientifically tortured diagnoses.\"A\u0130HM'nin G\u00fclmen ve \u00d6zak\u00e7a karar\u0131na Fincanc\u0131'dan tepki ==Claims== On 25 May 2017, Interior Minister S\u00fcleyman Soylu claimed that Semih \u00d6zak\u00e7a and Nuriye G\u00fclmen were \"members of the DHKP-C terrorist organization\" and that their actions were supported by this organization and that they had a direct link to DHKP-C. Following Soylu's claim, lawyer Sel\u00e7uk Koza\u011fa\u00e7l\u0131 published Nuriye G\u00fclmen and Semih \u00d6zak\u00e7a's criminal record which showed that they had no connection to any terrorist organizations. On top of that, the Ministry of Interior Research and Studies Center published a 54-page booklet titled \"The Unending Scenario of a Terrorist Organization, Nuriye G\u00fclmen and Semih \u00d6zak\u00e7a Truth\". In the booklet, \u00d6zak\u00e7a is accused of being \"a member of an armed terrorist organization\", \"causing damage to public property\", \"deliberately injuring himself to cause fractures\", and \"spreading the propaganda of a terrorist organization\", and was claimed to have four cases against him in the civil courts at the time. The Cumhuriyet newspaper claimed that the booklet had contained evidence for other cases that had not yet been finalized and were still pending before the Supreme Court. == References == ==External links== * Sezen Aksu\u2019dan Nuriye G\u00fclmen ve Semih \u00d6zak\u00e7a \u0130\u00e7in H\u00fck\u00fcmete \u00c7a\u011fr\u0131: 'L\u00fctfen Seslerine Kulak Verin' * Nuriye G\u00fclmen ve Semih \u00d6zak\u00e7a tutukland\u0131 Category:1989 births Category:Turkish activists Category:Turkish schoolteachers Category:Living people Category:People from Eski\u015fehir ",
