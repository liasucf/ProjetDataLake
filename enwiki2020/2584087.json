    "text": "Taliqu was Khan of the Chagatai Khanate (1308\u20131309). He was the son of Qadaqchi and a princess of Kerman, and a grandson of B\u00fcri. Following the death of K\u00f6nchek, Taliqu seized power and became Khan. As a Muslim, he attempted to convert his subjects; this move was unpopular. This, combined with resentment that he was not a descendant of Duwa, led to a revolt against his rule. His enemies selected Duwa's son Kebek to become Khan, and defeated Taliqu in battle in 1309. His supporters joined the forces of Kebek, and were instrumental in defeating the sons of Kaidu that same year.
