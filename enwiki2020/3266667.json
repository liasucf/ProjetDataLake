It is an amalgamation of the former St Jarlath's College and St. Patrick's College, Tuam both diocesan colleges of the Archdiocese of Tuam. The College was named after Jarlath, or Iarlaith, who founded a monastery in the town when, as legend has it, his chariot wheel broke. St. Patrick\u2019s was named after the patron saint of all of Ireland. ==History== Pre-amalgamation crest of St Jarlath's College, in use until 2009 ===Former St Jarlath's College=== The original St Jarlath's College was founded in 1801 by then-Archbishop of Tuam, Edward Dillon, with the aim of preparing young boys for entry into Maynooth Roman Catholic Seminary. Dr Dillon had to seek permission to establish the college from the Protestant Archbishop of Tuam, Dr Beresford. It began with two thatched cottages at the Mall, Tuam later moving to a new building in Bishop Street, now commonly known as \"the Old College\". Its first president was Rev Oliver Kelly, who later became Archbishop of Tuam. In 1824, the facilities of the College were enlarged by the erection of additional houses in Bishop Street and in 1856 the site of the present college and grounds was bought by Archbishop McHale. This property was known as Keighrey's Park and a portion of it was used as the town's fair green. McHale continued to set it as a fair green to the town commissioners at a yearly rent of 30 until 1875 in which year the college was extensively enlarged by the addition of two wings to the first building which had been erected in 1858. ===Former St Patrick's College=== In 1851, Archbishop John McHale had invited the Christian Brothers to Tuam. This Catholic organisation was to play a large part in the development of an educated Catholic middle class in Ireland. The invitation resulted in the birth of Tuam CBS, and later St Patrick's College, a Catholic day secondary school, which was to play an enormous role in the development of the town of Tuam. ===Amalgamation=== St Jarlath's College (2008) Plans to amalgamate St Patrick's And St Jarlath\u2019s colleges had first been suggested in the late 1990s. At that time, a new school building had been promised by the Government. However, no such building materialised. The phasing out of boarding in St Jarlath's led to a reduced enrolment. In March 2008, Archbishop Michael Neary, as trustee of both schools, announced to staff that the amalgamation would proceed in the absence of a new school building. The amalgamation process commenced in September 2008 with enrollment of all first year students in St Jarlath's. The process was completed in September 2009 when students from both schools amalgamated into the new school, in the old St Jarlath's building. ==Opera== Starting with The Mikado in 1944, the college's Amateur Operatic Society has performed a yearly musical or opera for the local community. The 1969 production, The Quaker Girl was the first to be held in conjunction with Mercy Convent, Tuam. The 2008 Opera was also in conjunction with St Patrick's College, due to the amalgamation process in progress at the time. The tradition of the annual Opera was continued following the amalgamation, the 2009 Opera being the first production of the newly amalgamated school. The Opera has been successful in recent years in the Connacht Tribune organised musical awards, winning a Best Overall and a Best Chorus award in 2008 for Hot Mikado. ==Sport== The St Jarlath's College's senior football team hold the prestigious record of winning the Hogan Cup 12 times, more than any other school, and have also been runners-up on a further 14 occasions. The college also holds the record for winning the most Connacht Colleges Senior Football Championships, with an outstanding 48 wins. Since amalgamation, the school have won two Connacht Senior titles, reaching the Hogan Cup Final in 2011. Under the management of Joe Burke, and captained by Ian Burke from Corofin, the school narrowly lost out to St Colman's College, Newry by just one point . ==Sporting honours== ===Former St Jarlath's College=== *Hogan Cup : 12 (1947, 1958, 1960, 1961, 1964, 1966, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1984, 1994, 2002) *Connacht Colleges Senior Football Championship : 46 (1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1950, 1951, 1953, 1956, 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1979, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2007, 2008) *Paddy Buggy Cup (All-Ireland Colleges Senior 'B' Hurling Championship) : 1 ===New St Jarlath's College=== *Connacht Colleges Senior Football Championship : 2 (2011, 2012) *Hogan Cup Runners-Up : 1 (2011) ==Notable staff== *J.
