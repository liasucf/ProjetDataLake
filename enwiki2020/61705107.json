    "text": "The 1958\u201359 Tennessee A&I; State Tigers basketball team represented Tennessee A&I; State College (now called Tennessee State University) in National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) men's basketball during the 1958\u201359 season. Coached by fifth-year head coach John McLendon, the Tigers finished the season with a school-record 32 wins and were crowned NAIA national champions by winning the 1959 NAIA Tournament. This marked the third of three consecutive national championships, a feat that no other team at any level of college basketball had previously accomplished. In 2019, all three national championship teams were inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. ==Individual honors== * Associated Press Little All- America \u2013 Dick Barnett * NAIA All-America \u2013 Dick Barnett, John Barnhill * NAIA Tournament MVP \u2013 Dick Barnett * NABC College Division I All-District Second Team \u2013 Dick Barnett ==School records== ;Team * Wins (season) \u2013 32 * Points (game) \u2013 150, vs. Knoxville College ;Individual * Points (game) \u2013 48, Dick Barnett * Points (season) \u2013 920, Dick Barnett * Points (career) \u2013 3,209, Dick Barnett (1955\u201359) ==Rankings== ==References== Category:Tennessee State Tigers basketball seasons Tennessee AandI Category:NAIA Men's Basketball Tournament championship seasons Category:Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductees Tennessee AandI State Basketball Team Tennessee AandI State Basketball Team ",
