He was killed by Usta\u0161e of the Nazi Germany-aligned Independent State of Croatia in August 1941. The Serbian Orthodox Church venerates him as a Saint. ==Life== He was born Svetozar Trlaji\u0107 to Stevan and Jelisaveta (n\u00e9e Karaka\u0161evi\u0107) in Mol on 18 July 1884. His education included the primary school in his hometown, a grammar school in Novi Sad, and seminary in Sremski Karlovci. He then went on to graduate from the Faculty of Law at the University of Belgrade and passed the qualifying examination for judges at the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb. In 1909, he was ordained a deacon by the Bishop of Timi\u0219oara and then presbyter ten days later. As a parish priest, he served at parishes in Pe\u0161ka and Ba\u0161aid. Early in 1927, he was appointed to an administrative position, and later principal secretary, of the Holy Synod of Bishops of the Church of Serbia. When his wife died, he took monastic vows on 27 October 1929 in the Kru\u0161edol Monastery, being tonsured with the name Sava. Soon afterward he became rector and archimandrite of the Kru\u0161edol Monastery. On 30 September 1930, Sava was elected Auxiliary Bishop of Sremski Karlovci. He was consecrated in Sremski Karlovci by Patriarch Varnava, Bishop Emilijan of Timok, Bishop Jovan of Ni\u0161, Bishop Tihon of the Eparchy of Zahumlje and Herzegovina, and Bishop Simeon of Zletovo and Strumica. As Patriarchal Vicar Bishop Sava chaired the diocesan council of the Archbishopric of Belgrade and Karlovci. From early 1937, Bishop Sava chaired the ecclesiastical court. He was appointed Bishop of Gornji Karlovac on 22 June 1938, with his residence in Pla\u0161ki. After the death of Bishop Miron of Pakrac in 1941, he was also named administrator of the Eparchy of Slavonia. ==Martyrdom== After the Invasion of Yugoslavia and the formation of the Nazi Germany-aligned Independent State of Croatia, Pla\u0161ki was first occupied by Italian forces and then turned over to the Ustashi Croatians in late 1941. Bishop Sava and nine priests were then taken, hostage. On 23 May 1941, Ustashi occupied the bishop's residence and expelled Bishop Sava. On June 8, the notorious executioner Josip Tomljenovi\u0107 ordered all diocesan money and records to be handed over to the Ustashi. Bp. Sava refused the Ustashi order to leave his diocese and go to Belgrade. Not wanting to abandon his flock, he refused. Bishop Sava was arrested on June 17, 1941, and confined, together with three other Serbian priests and thirteen eminent Serbian laymen, in a stable owned by Josip Tomljenovi\u0107 in Pla\u0161ki. After experiencing intense torture, Bishop Sava and the priests, Bogoljub Gakovi\u0107, \u0110uro Stojanovi\u0107, and Stanislav Nasadilo, were chained and taken to the Gospi\u0107 concentration camp on 19 July 1941. There, they were tortured until mid-August. At that time Bishop Sava was taken together with 2,000 Serbs toward the Velebit Mountains. Somewhere on this mountain, he suffered a martyr\u2019s death together with thousands of other Orthodox Serbs. The site where Bishop Sava died is still unknown. ==Canonization== In 1998, at the regular session of the Holy Assembly of Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Bishop Sava was glorified and entered into the list of names of the saints of the Serbian Orthodox Church as hieromartyr. ==See also== * List of Serbian saints == References == Category:1884 births Category:1941 deaths Category:People from Ada, Serbia Category:Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church Category:Serbian saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church Category:Persecution of Serbs Category:20th-century Eastern Orthodox martyrs Category:20th-century Christian saints Category:New Martyrs Category:Hieromartyrs Category:University of Belgrade Faculty of Law alumni Category:People executed by the Independent State of Croatia Category:Serb people who died in the Holocaust Category:Serbian torture victims Category:Serbian civilians killed in World War II ",
