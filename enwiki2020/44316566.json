    "text": "The Indianapolis mayoral election of 2015 took place on November 3, 2015. Voters elected the Mayor of Indianapolis, members of the Indianapolis City- County Council, as well as several other local officials. Incumbent Republican Greg Ballard did not run for re-election to a third term in office. Primary elections were held on May 5, 2015, with the Democrats nominating former secretary of state of Indiana and United States Attorney Joe Hogsett. Republicans nominated former Marine Chuck Brewer to face Hogsett. The 2015 Indianapolis City-County elections took place alongside the mayoral election. This would be the first election for the council without the four at-large seats, which were eliminated by the Indiana General Assembly. Democrats also won control of the council, with a 13\u201312 majority \u2013 only the second time since the formation of Unigov in 1970 that the Democrats will have complete control of city government. They also swept all elected city and county offices for the first time since the formation of Unigov. This meant that, for the first time since the creation of the Unigov, the Democratic Party would control both the Indianapolis mayoralty and City Council. ==Republican primary== Ahead of the primary, Brewer was seen as having strong odds of winning the Republican nomination. ===Candidates=== ====Declared==== * Jocelyn-Tandy Adande, perennial candidate * Chuck Brewer, businessman * Terry Michael, real estate broker, former trustee of Fall Creek Township and candidate for the state senate in 2008 * Darrell Morris, firefighter and candidate in 2007 * Larry Shouse, janitor and candidate in 2007 ====Withdrew==== * Olgen Williams, deputy mayor of Indianapolis ====Declined==== * Greg Ballard, incumbent mayor * J.
