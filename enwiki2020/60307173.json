    "text": "Robinson Gymnasium was the first true gymnasium for the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas and home to the Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball program from 1907\u20131927. It was designed by James Naismith at a cost of $100,000. The creation of the modern facilities were led by Naismith and KU Chancellor Frank Strong. Naismith wanted the gymnasium not just for basketball but also for his other physical education classes and sports activities. The gymnasium was named after Charles L. Robinson who was the first Governor of Kansas. It was named after Governor Robinson and his wife Sara Tappan Doolittle Robinson, both as thanks for their service and to make amends for what Sara perceived to be excessive pressure on her nephew to sell of land to KU at a below-market price. Construction began in 1905 and was completed in May 1907. The building was a significant improvement over Snow Hall that had 11 feet ceilings and support beams in the middle of the floor. The Gymnasium featured a swimming pool, men's and women's locker rooms, a main-floor gymnasium, 1/16-mile running track, a batting cage, a full range of gymnastics equipment and a 2,500-seat auditorium. The gymnasium served many purposes including dances, enrollments, commencements, concerts, lectures, and even as emergency housing immediately after World War II. The men's basketball team amassed a 148\u201328 record at Robinson before the team moved to the larger Hoch Auditorium in 1927. The gymnasium was demolished in November 1967 and was replaced with Wescoe Hall. == References == Category:Indoor arenas in Kansas Category:Defunct college basketball venues in the United States Category:Kansas Jayhawks basketball Category:Sports venues in Kansas Category:University of Kansas campus ",
