    "text": "Good God's Urge is the second and final studio album by American alternative rock band Porno for Pyros, released on May 28, 1996 on Warner Bros. It was the band's only album to feature bass guitarist Mike Watt, who assisted the band in finishing the album after Martyn LeNoble left before all his bass tracks had been completed. There were three singles released from the album. In addition to Watt, many guest musicians lent their musical talents to various songs. The song \"Porpoise Head\" featured Daniel Ash, David J and Kevin Haskins from Bauhaus, Love and Rockets and the Bubblemen. Good God's Urge also marked a reunion of ex-Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, who played guitar on the album track \"Freeway,\" with his former bandmates. The song also featured Navarro's Red Hot Chili Peppers bandmate, Flea, who would join Farrell, Perkins and Navarro for a Jane's Addiction reunion the following year. Farrell's then-girlfriend, Christine Cagle, appeared on the album cover. Porno for Pyros went on a brief hiatus shortly after this album's release because guitarist Peter DiStefano was diagnosed with cancer. == Track listing == ==Personnel== ===Band=== * Perry Farrell: Vocals, percussion, samples, harp, keyboards * Peter DiStefano: Guitars, samples, backing vocals * Martyn LeNoble: Bass (tracks 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10) * Stephen Perkins: Drums, percussion, samples, backing vocals ===Additional musicians=== * Thomas Johnson: Samples and sounds, keyboards (track 2) * David J: Bass (1) * Mike Watt: Bass (2, 6) * Flea: Bass (9) * Daniel Ash : Guitar (1) * Kevin Haskins: Samples (1) * Dave Navarro: Guitar intro (9) * Matt Hyde: Intro slide guitar (3), samples (8), slide guitar (10) * Lili Haydn: Violin (2) * Ralf Rickert: Trumpet (2) * Leo Chelyapov: Clarinet (7) * John Flannery: Space guitar intro and chorus (9), backing vocals and trash can (6) * Josh \"Bagel\" Klassman: Backing vocals (9) * Christine Cagle: Backing vocals (6, 9) * Shawn London: Backing Vocals (6) * Kimberly Juarez: Backing Vocals (2) ===Production=== * Dave Collins - mastering ==Charts== Album - Billboard (North America) {| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"width:550px;\" |- ! style=\"text- align:left; vertical-align:top;\"|Year ! style=\"text-align:left; vertical- align:top;\"|Chart ! style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"|Position |- style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\" ||1996 ||The Billboard 200 ||20 |} Singles - Billboard (North America) {| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"width:550px;\" |- ! style=\"text-align:left; vertical- align:top;\"|Year ! style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"|Single ! style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"|Chart ! style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"|Position |- style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\" ||1996 ||\"Tahitian Moon\" ||Billboard Hot 100 Airplay ||46 |- style=\"text- align:left; vertical-align:top;\" ||1996 ||\"Tahitian Moon\" ||Modern Rock Tracks ||8 |} ==References== Category:Porno for Pyros albums Category:1996 albums Category:Warner Records albums Category:Albums produced by Matt Hyde Category:Albums recorded at Shangri-La (recording studio) ",
