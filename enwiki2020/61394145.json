    "text": "Mortal Kombat is an upcoming 2021 American martial-arts fantasy action film directed by Simon McQuoid (in his feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by Greg Russo and Dave Callaham and a story by Oren Uziel and Russo. It is based on the video game franchise of the same name created by Ed Boon and John Tobias, and serves as a reboot to the Mortal Kombat film series following the critical and commercial failure of the 1997 film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, where a third film languished in development hell for a period of nearly two decades. The film will feature an ensemble cast including Ludi Lin, Joe Taslim, Tadanobu Asano, Jessica McNamee, Mehcad Brooks, Josh Lawson, Chin Han, and Hiroyuki Sanada. Mortal Kombat will be released in the United States on January 15, 2021, by Warner Bros. Pictures. ==Cast== * Ludi Lin as Liu Kang * Joe Taslim as Bi-Han / Sub-Zero * Tadanobu Asano as Raiden * Jessica McNamee as Sonya Blade * Mehcad Brooks as Jackson \"Jax\" Briggs * Josh Lawson as Kano * Chin Han as Shang Tsung * Hiroyuki Sanada as Hanzo Hasashi / Scorpion * Max Huang as Kung Lao * Sisi Stringer as Mileena * Elissa Cadwell as Nitara Additionally, Lewis Tan and Matilda Kimber will appear in undisclosed roles. ==Production== ===Development=== James Wan (pictured in 2018) serves as producer for the reboot. In 2010, director Kevin Tancharoen released an eight- minute short film titled Mortal Kombat: Rebirth, made as a pitch to Warner Bros. Pictures of a reboot of the Mortal Kombat film franchise. In September 2011, New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. announced that Tancharoen was hired to direct a new feature-length film from a screenplay by Mortal Kombat: Rebirth writer Oren Uziel, with the intention of aiming for an R rating. Shooting was expected to begin in March 2012 with a budget projected at between $40\u201350 million and a release date of 2013. However, the project was ultimately delayed due to budget constraints, and Tancharoen began working on the second season of the web series Mortal Kombat: Legacy until problems with the film had been sorted out, but he quit the film production in October 2013. James Wan signed on as the film's producer in August 2015. Simon McQuoid was hired as director in November 2016, marking his feature directorial debut, with Greg Russo writing the script. Russo tweeted in February 2019 that the film's script was complete. In May 2019, it was announced that the film had entered pre-production and would be shot in South Australia, with a release date of March 5, 2021. Russo tweeted in July 2019 that the film would indeed have an R rating and that the games' Fatalities would \"finally be on the big screen\". ===Casting=== Joe Taslim was the first actor cast for the production in July 2019, as Sub-Zero. In August, Mehcad Brooks, Tadanobu Asano, Sisi Stringer, and Ludi Lin were cast in the roles of Jax, Raiden, Mileena, and Liu Kang respectively. Later that month, Josh Lawson, Jessica McNamee, Chin Han and Hiroyuki Sanada were cast as Kano, Sonya Blade, Shang Tsung and Scorpion respectively, with Lewis Tan in an undisclosed role. On September 16, 2019, it was announced that Max Huang had been cast as Kung Lao. Elissa Cadwell was announced as having been cast as Nitara on November 11, 2019. Matilda Kimber was cast in an undisclosed role on December 4, 2019. ===Filming=== Production took place at Adelaide Studios and other locations in South Australia. Shooting commenced from September 16, 2019 to December 13. ==Music== Benjamin Wallfisch will compose the film's score. ==Release== The film was originally going to be released on March 5, 2021, but was moved up to January 15, 2021. ==References== ==External links== * Mortal Kombat at the Internet Movie Database Category:Upcoming films Category:2021 films Category:2020s action films Category:2020s adventure films Category:2020s fantasy films Category:2020s martial arts films Category:American fantasy adventure films Category:American films Category:American martial arts films Category:English- language films Category:Films produced by James Wan Category:Films scored by Benjamin Wallfisch Category:Films set on islands Category:Films shot in Adelaide Category:Films shot in South Australia Category:Films with screenplays by David Callaham Category:Live-action films based on video games Category:Martial arts fantasy films Category:Martial arts tournament films Category:Martial arts films Category:Mortal Kombat films Category:New Line Cinema films Category:Ninja films Category:Reboot films Category:Warner Bros. films ",
