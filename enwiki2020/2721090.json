It lies on the Thaya 3 km north of the Austrian border close to Hardegg and 22 km from the historical town of Znojmo. ==History== While there exists a written record about Vranov nad Dyj\u00ed Castle dated in 1100, the nearby settlement was first mentioned as a village as late as in 1323. The Lichtenburg noble family took control of the castle and town during the 15th century, followed by the Althann nobles. Between 1790-1882 the town had a manufactory for earthenware; after 1820 the manufactory began producing ceramic based on the methods of Josiah Wedgwood.
