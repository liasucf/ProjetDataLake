    "text": "The Oregon Trail Memorial Association (OTMA) was an American organization founded by pioneer Ezra Meeker in 1922 as the Old Oregon Trail Association to memorialize those who traveled to the U.S. West Coast via the Oregon Trail. The group was incorporated in New York in early 1926 as the Oregon Trail Memorial Association. The organization is best known for promoting the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar. It was succeeded by the American Pioneer Trails Association (APTA) in 1940. Oregon-California Trails Association is considered a successor to OTMA. ==References== Category:Oregon Trail Category:1922 establishments in the United States ",
