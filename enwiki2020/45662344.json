    "text": "Orson Welles Commentaries (1945\u201346) is an ABC radio series produced and directed by Orson Welles. Featuring commentary by Welles, with reminiscences and readings from literature, the 15-minute weekly program aired Sunday afternoons at 1:15 p.m. ET beginning September 16, 1945. Lear Radio sponsored the program through the end of June 1946 when it failed to find a larger audience. The series was continued by ABC as a sustaining show through October 6, 1946. Orson Welles Commentaries was the last of Welles's own radio shows. ==Episodes== Welles's five broadcasts on the beating and blinding of decorated U.S. Army veteran Isaac Woodard in South Carolina (July 28 \u2013 August 25, 1946) brought significant national attention to the case. {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\"|# !align=\"center\"|Date !align=\"center\"|Program !align=\"center\"|Recording !align=\"center\"|References |- |1 |September 16, 1945 |Welles begins his weekly series of social and political commentary and readings, and discusses matador Fernando L\u00f3pez. | | |- |2 |September 23, 1945 |Welles tells The Story of Bonito, the Bull by Robert J.
