    "text": "Mitrella gervillii is a species of sea snail in the family Columbellidae, the dove snails. ==Description== The length of the shell varies between 10 mm and 20 mm. The thick shell is smooth, narrow, elongated, and subturreted. It is formed of eight or nine slightly distinct roundish whorls. It is of a fawn color or more or less deep brownish red. It contains some white spots, forming a sort of zone beneath the sutures. It presents also several varieties of color, and some specimens are found which are covered with small grayish points. The whitish aperture is delicately shaded with a pale violet, rather small, narrow, terminated by a straight siphonal canal, short, and very slightly effuse at its extremity. The outer lip is thin and sharp. Its internal edge isdenticulated. The columella lip is covered in front by a pointed callosity, which partially conceals the striae of the base of the body whorl and exhibits a row of five or six small guttules. Sometimes these do not exist.Kiener (1840).
