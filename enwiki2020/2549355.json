    "text": "Loton Park Hill Climb is a hillclimb held in part of the Loton Park deer park in Shropshire, England. The track was originally constructed by the members of The Severn Valley Motor Club based in Shrewsbury, in the mid-1950s. The first ever winner was Peter Foulkes in a Cooper Climax. The track was threatened with closure in 1969 Motor, May 24, 1969, Page 68. and since then events have been organised by the Hagley & District Light Car Club, who obtained the lease on the land from owner Sir Michael Leighton in 1970, in which year the first National A hillclimb was staged. The course is 1475 yards (1349 metres) in length, making it the third longest course used in the British Hill Climb Championship. It contains an unusual downhill section fairly early in its layout. As of June 2009, the hill record of 44.42 seconds stands to Scott Moran, who set the mark in the second run-off of the 13 April 2009 meeting. Martin Groves had previously beaten his own previous record (44.53s) with 44.46s in the first run-off. ==Loton Park Hill Climb past winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- !
