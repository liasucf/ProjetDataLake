Among his 12 other siblings were Jean-Baptiste Willermoz (1730\u20131824), Pierre Willermoz (1734\u20131793) and Antoine Willermoz (1741\u20131793).Genealogie der Familie In 1761, Willermoz was appointed professor demonstrator of chemistry at the University of Montpellier but he resigned this chair in 1763 and returned to Lyon, where, on the advice of his friends, he opened a course of chemistry which proved very busy. Having been aggregated to the college of physicians of this city, he continued to devote to scientific research the leisure left to him by the exercise of his art. The Acad\u00e9mie des sciences belles-lettres et arts de Lyon, whose records contain three unreleased texts, admitted him in its midst. Bound by a close friendship with the agronomist Fran\u00e7ois Rozier, he was no stranger to the writing of the latter's Dictionnaire universel d\u2019agriculture. He also collaborated with the Encyclop\u00e9die by Diderot and D'Alembert, as well as with the Encyclop\u00e9die ou dictionnaire universel raisonn\u00e9 des connaissances humaines. ==References== == Sources == * Joseph-Marie Qu\u00e9rard, La France litt\u00e9raire, t. 10, Paris, Firmin- Didot, 1839, (p. 518). * Alice Joly; Jean Lacassagne; Jean Rousset; Lucien Michel; Joseph Chinard; Pierre-Alexandre Tardieu: Pierre-Jacques Willermoz: M\u00e9decin lyonnais (1735\u20131799). \u00c9ditions de La Guilloti\u00e8re, 1938 == External links == * Pierre-jacques Willermoz on data.bnf.fr * Frank A.
