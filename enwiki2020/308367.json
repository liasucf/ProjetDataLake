The family then moved to Virginia, spending about four years there, until Gray's parents divorced, after which he returned to San Francisco with his mother. His father, an amateur inventor, patented a design for a ribbon cartridge for typewriters that earned him a substantial royalty stream. After being turned down for the Air Force Academy he entered the University of California, Berkeley as a freshman in 1961. To help pay for college he worked as a co-op for General Dynamics, where he learned to use a Monroe calculator. Discouraged by his chemistry grades, he left Berkeley for six months, returning after an experience in industry he later described as \"dreadful\". Gray earned his B.S. in Engineering Mathematics (Math and Statistics) in 1966. After marrying, Gray moved with his wife Loretta to New Jersey, his wife's home state; she got a job as a teacher and he got one at Bell Labs working on a digital simulation that was to be part of Multics. At Bell, he worked three days a week and spent two days as a Master's student at New York University's Courant Institute. After a year they traveled for several months before settling again in Berkeley, where Gray entered graduate school with Michael A. Harrison as his advisor. In 1969 he received his Ph.D. in programming languages, then did two years of postdoctoral work for IBM. While at Berkeley, Gray and Loretta had a daughter; they were later divorced. His second wife was Donna Carnes. ==Research== Gray pursued his career primarily working as a researcher and software designer at a number of industrial companies, including IBM, Tandem Computers, and DEC. He joined Microsoft in 1995 and was a Technical Fellow for the company until he was lost at sea in 2007. Gray contributed to several major database and transaction processing systems. IBM's System R was the precursor of the SQL relational databases that have become a standard throughout the world. For Microsoft, he worked on TerraServer-USA and Skyserver. His best-known achievements include: * ACID, an acronym describing the requirements for reliable transaction processing and its software implementation *Granular database locking * Two- tier transaction commit semantics * The Five-minute rule for allocating storage * OLAP cube operator for data warehousing He assisted in developing Virtual Earth.Interview on MSDN Channel 9, Behind the Code, March 3, 2006 He was also one of the co-founders of the Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research. ==Disappearance== Jim Gray on his yacht Tenacious in 2006 Gray, an experienced sailor, owned a 40-foot sailboat. On January 28, 2007, he failed to return from a short solo trip to the Farallon Islands near San Francisco to scatter his mother's ashes. The weather was clear, and no distress call was received, nor was any signal detected from the boat's automatic Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon. A four-day Coast Guard search using planes, helicopters, and boats found nothing. On February 1, 2007, the DigitalGlobe satellite did a scan of the area and the thousands of images were posted to Amazon Mechanical Turk. Students, colleagues, and friends of Gray, and computer scientists around the world formed a \"Jim Gray Group\" to study these images for clues. On February 16 this search was suspended, and an underwater search using sophisticated equipment ended May 31.Inside the High-Tech Hunt for a Missing Silicon Valley Legend, Wired Magazine (August 2007)Help Find Jim Information to help locate Jim GrayPrint a MISSING Poster Hang a MISSING Poster in Southern California and Mexico. The University of California, Berkeley and Gray's family hosted a tribute on May 31, 2008. Microsoft's WorldWide Telescope software is dedicated to Gray. In 2008, Microsoft opened a research center in Madison, Wisconsin, named after Jim Gray. On January 28, 2012, Gray was declared legally dead. ==Jim Gray eScience Award== Each year, Microsoft Research presents the Jim Gray eScience Award to a researcher who has made an outstanding contribution to the field of data-intensive computing. Award recipients are selected for their ground-breaking, fundamental contributions to the field of eScience. Previous award winners include Alex Szalay (2007), Carole Goble (2008), Jeff Dozier (2009), Phil Bourne (2010), Mark Abbott (2011), Antony John Williams (2012), and Dr. David Lipman, M.D. (2013). ==See also== *List of people who disappeared mysteriously at sea ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Gray's Microsoft Research home page, last accessed 23 June 2013 *James (\"Jim\") Nicholas Gray, Turing Award citation *Video Behind the Code on Channel 9, interviewed by Barbara Fox, 2005 *Video The Future of Software and Databases, expert panel discussion with Rick Cattell, Don Chamberlin, Daniela Florescu, Jim Gray and Jim Melton, Software Development 2002 conference *Oral History Interview with Jim Gray, Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota.
