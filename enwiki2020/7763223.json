They were given a rigorous program of instruction in the three disciplines of acting, singing and dance, as well as other teaching that supported one or more of the disciplines (for example; clowning and Alexander Technique). At the end of each week they were graded, with the results posted for all twelve to see. After three weeks, the participants with the lowest scores for each gender were eliminated. The fourth week was devoted to workshop performances, in groups, in couples and solo. At its conclusion, four more finalists were eliminated, and two weeks later the remaining six contestants performed in front of a live audience of several hundred people at the Rose Theatre in Brampton, Ontario.
