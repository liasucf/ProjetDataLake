Bordallo (D-GM).Bordallo House Page The Wounded to Work Caucus is the first Congressional Caucus to deal with the needs of active duty military personnel who have been wounded in the service of their nation. The Caucus and its volunteers will be promoting employment, through Congressional internships or shadowing, as appropriate, and the education and training of military personnel. The final goal is to provide support for the creation and development of education and training programs within the private sector in order to expand the employability of participating military personnel. The program was the brain child of Edward Tj Gerety and Gary Goosman. Gerety had a father in the US Marine Corps, and that is where it began. == References == == External links == * Caucus' Congressional Home page * Bio for Congresswoman Bordallo listing Caucus * Congressional Member Lists Category:American veterans' organizations Category:Caucuses of the United States Congress ",
