    "text": "This page is a list of tables of code-driven unit testing frameworks for various programming languages. Some but not all of these are based on xUnit. ==Columns (classification)== * Name: This column contains the name of the framework and will usually link to it. * xUnit: This column indicates whether a framework should be considered of xUnit type. * TAP: This column indicates whether a framework can emit TAP output for TAP-compliant testing harnesses. * SubUnit: This column indicates whether a framework can emit SubUnit output. * Generators: Indicates whether a framework supports data generators. Data generators generate input data for a test and the test is run for each input data that the generator produces. * Fixtures: Indicates whether a framework supports test-local fixtures. Test-local fixtures ensure a specified environment for a single test. * Group fixtures: Indicates whether a framework supports group fixtures. Group fixtures ensure a specified environment for a whole group of Tests * MPI: Indicates whether a framework supports message passing via MPI - commonly used for high-performance scientific computing. * Other columns: These columns indicate whether a specific language / tool feature is available / used by a framework. * Remarks: Any remarks. ==Languages== ===ABAP=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
