    "text": "Hollywood Park Casino is a casino and sports bar in Inglewood, California. Originally part of the Hollywood Park Racetrack, the casino moved to a new building in 2016 after the closure and demolition of the racetrack in 2013. ==History== The original casino owners were the Hollywood Park Operating Co., which also owned the race track. Afterwards the casino went through a series of owners including Churchill Downs. In 1994, a casino called the Hollywood Park Casino, with a poker card room, was added to the Hollywood Park Racetrack complex. The racetrack was sold and shut down in December 2013 though the casino operations continued while the current casino building opened in October 2016. The casino is part of the Hollywood Park development which also features SoFi Stadium, home to the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League and will later include multiple housing, business parks, luxury hotels, a movie theatre, and an open-air shopping center. It was the first building of the complex to be constructed and opened. ===Stockbridge Capital Group=== The current owners are Stockbridge Capital Group, a San Francisco-based land developer which purchased the casino and then the racetrack in 2005 for nearly $260 million. Stockbridge, in addition to owning the casino, is also the land developer for the former racetrack site and a joint partner in the NFL stadium. It is planned that the new casino, entertainment complex and NFL stadium will improve the finances of the casino, which had been on a downturn since the Los Angeles Kings and Los Angeles Lakers left The Forum in May 1999. ==New Casino building== The Hollywood Park Casino contains 125 tables for both Poker and California Games including chandelier lighting and big-screen HD televisions on the walls. There was even a new sports bar called Century Bar & Grill. There are separate rooms for high-stakes players and celebrity poker tournaments. It also features high scale sit-down restaurant and sports bar. Like its predecessor, only card games are allowed in the casino. ==Off-track betting== Located in the casino is the Hollywood Park OTB which continues from the former track. It features races from all over North America and Australia on big screens. ==References== ==External links== *Official site *Hollywood Park OTB Category:Casinos in Los Angeles County, California Category:Hollywood Park Category:Inglewood, California Category:Casinos completed in 2016 Category:2016 establishments in California Category:1994 establishments in California Category:Native American casinos ",
