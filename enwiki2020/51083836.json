    "text": "Pronunciation of the phoneme in the English language has many variations in different dialects. == Variations == Depending on dialect, has at least the following allophones in varieties of English around the world:Wells, John C. (1982). Accents of English. Volume 1: An Introduction, Volume 2: The British Isles, Volume 3: Beyond the British Isles. Cambridge University Press. *\"Standard\" R: postalveolar approximant (a common realization of the phoneme worldwide, Received Pronunciation and General American included) *\"Bunched\" or \"Molar\" R: \"bunched-tongue\" alveolar approximant (occurs in Southern American English and some Midwestern and Western American English most strongly); in fact, there is often a continuum of possible realizations for the postalveolar approximant within any single dialect from a more apical articulation to this more bunched articulation *\"Velar\" R: velarized alveolar approximant (occurs in conservative Irish English)Hickey, Raymond (2007). Irish English: History and present-day forms. Cambridge University Press. pp. 14-15, 320. *\"Retroflex\" R: retroflex approximant (occurs in some American and most Irish English, including Northern Irish English) *\"Flapped\" or \"Tapped\" R: alveolar flap (occurs in Scouse, most Scottish English, some South African, Welsh, Indian, conservative Irish and Northern England English, and early twentieth- century Received Pronunciation; not to be confused with flapping of and ) *\"Trilled\" or \"Rolled\" R: alveolar trill (occurs in Afrikaans English, some Welsh English, some very conservative Scottish English, Indian English and Jersey English) *\"Uvular\" R or \"Northumbrian burr\": voiced uvular fricative (occurs in very conservative varieties of Geordie and Northumbrian dialect, though largely now disappeared, as well as possibly some conservative South- West and East Irish English and some Aberdeen English) *\"Labial\" or \"Rounded\" R: labiodental approximant (occurs in some south-east England and London English as a presumed idiosyncrasy, though this is disputed, as is its overlap with rhotacism; see \u00a7 R-labialization below) In most dialects is labialized in many positions, as in reed and tree ; in the latter case, the may be slightly labialized as well. In General American, it is labialized at the beginning of a word but not at the end. In many dialects, in the cluster , as in dream, is realized as a postalveolar fricative or less commonly alveolar . In , as in tree, it is a voiceless postalveolar fricative or less commonly alveolar . In England, while the approximant has become the most common realization, may still be pronounced as a voiceless tap after (as in thread). Tap realization of after is also reported in some parts of the United States, particularly Utah. There are two primary articulations of the approximant : apical (with the tip of the tongue approaching the alveolar ridge or even curled back slightly) and domal (with a centralized bunching of the tongue known as molar r or sometimes bunched r or braced r ). Peter Ladefoged wrote: \"Many BBC English speakers have the tip of the tongue raised towards the roof of the mouth in the general location of the alveolar ridge, but many American English speakers simply bunch the body of the tongue up so that it is hard to say where the articulation is\". The extension to the IPA recommends the use of the IPA diacritics for \"apical\" and \"centralized\", as in , to distinguish apical and domal articulations in transcription. However, this distinction has little or no perceptual consequence, and may vary idiosyncratically between individuals. ==Rhoticity and non-rhoticity== All English accents around the world are frequently characterized as either rhotic or non-rhotic. The majority of accents in England, Wales, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa speak non-rhotic accents, and in these dialects the historical English phoneme /r/ is not pronounced except when followed by a vowel. However, the historical /r/ is pronounced in all contexts in rhotic accents, which are spoken across the majority in Scotland, Ireland, the United States, Canada, and also in some English accents (for example West Country and some parts of Lancashire and the far north). Thus, a rhotic accent pronounces marker as , while a non-rhotic accent pronounces the same word as . Generally speaking in rhotic accents, when is not followed by a vowel phoneme, it surfaces as r-coloring of the preceding vowel or its coda: nurse , butter . == R-labialization == R-labialization, not to be confused with the rounding of initial described above, is a process occurring in certain dialects of English, particularly some varieties of Cockney, in which the phoneme is realized as a labiodental approximant in contrast to an alveolar approximant . Use of labiodental is commonly stigmatized by prescriptivists. Regardless, it is used in many other languages and its use is growing in many accents of British English.Foulkes, Paul, and Gerard J. Docherty. (eds.) (1999). Urban Voices. Arnold Most speakers who do so are from the southeast of England, particularly London. It has also been reported to be an extremely rare realization of in New Zealand English. The realization may not always be labiodental: bilabial and velarized labiodental realizations have been reported. R-labialization leads to pronunciations such as the following: * red \u2013 * ring \u2013 * rabbit \u2013 * Merry Christmas \u2013 However, replacement of by some kind of labial approximant may also occur due to a type of speech impediment called rhotacism or derhotacization. == See also == *English-language vowel changes before historic /r/ *Rhoticity in English ==References== Category:English phonology Category:Rhotic consonants ",
