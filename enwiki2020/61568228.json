    "text": "Anastasia Synn is sideshow stunt performer and magician, and also a transhumanist and biohacker and cyborg rights activist. She is married to magician and comedian The Amazing Johnathan, whom she also manages. == Transhumanism and bio-hacking == A frequent speaker at magic, Transhumanist and biohacking conferences, she currently has 26 implants, including the largest magnet ever implanted into a person, as well as a sound-transmitting magnet implanted into the tragus of her ear. She had all of these implants surgically installed by a nurse and an underground DIY-surgeon. She has used these implants to perform magic tricks, appearing on national television in the United States, on Penn & Teller: Fool Us. This performance was named by BioHacking News as one of the top biohacking moments of 2018. Her biohacking is part of the DIYbio cyborg subculture called \"grinding,\" which developed out of the magnets being used in the body modification subculture instead being used as a hack to acquire an \"electromagnetic sense.\" Around half of Synn's implants are microchips, which she programs to give herself heightened senses and abilities, such as opening locks, turning on her computer, and the like. Synn has spoken before the Nevada State Senate to oppose a 2019 proposal for a microchip implant ban and her testimony influenced state senator Melanie Scheible to oppose the ban. == The Amazing Johnathan == Synn was married to the magician The Amazing Johnathan at A Special Memory Chapel in Las Vegas in June 2014, in a ceremony attended by fellow magicians David Copperfield, Penn & Teller, and Jeff McBride, as well as the comedian Gallagher. Their wedding reception was at Geisha House, Las Vegas. Together they host annual parties covered by the Las Vegas press. They met while he was doing a six year run at the Harmon Theater. She has frequently performed shows with him, often taking over for him halfway through when he becomes fatigued. == Media appearances and performances == She has been featured widely in the media, including in a 2010 feature in Las Vegas Weekly, and in articles about biohacking, including in a 2018 Gizmodo science feature. She has appeared in The Verge's 2012 web documentary on biohacking, entitled A Journey Into Cyborg America, as well as Zoomin Next's \"Life of Cyborgs Episode Six: The Cybernetic Magician.\" A \"widely regarded stage performer,\" Synn has performed \"shocking\" needle penetrations of her muscles, and has performed on national television in the United States during a 2018 episode Masters of Illusion with The Amazing Johnathan, and in a solo performance during a September 2018 episode of Penn and Teller's Fool Us. In Australia, she appeared on an episode of James Galea's Best Trick Ever on ABC2. She has been featured at numerous live performance venues, including Scot Nery's Boobie Trap and Brookledge Follies.
