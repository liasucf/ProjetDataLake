It is located on the north bank of the Narmada, at an important ford where the Agra- Bombay national highway crosses the river. Hindi and Nimadi and Malvi are the primary languages spoken in the area. == History == In ancient times Khalghat was known as Khaligha\u1e6d\u1e6da and lay on long distance routes connecting Malwa to the Deccan. Here on the banks of the Rev\u0101 i.e. Narmada, Caccha, a feudatory of Param\u0101ra king S\u012byaka II (c. 949-972) gave battle to Kho\u1e6d\u1e6digadeva, the R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drak\u016b\u1e6da king of M\u0101\u1e47yakhe\u1e6da, around 972-973 CE, and died a heroic death. This is recorded in verse 29 of the Panaheda temple inscription of Ma\u1e47\u1e0dal\u012bka, king of a Param\u0101ra branch ruling from V\u0101ga\u1e0da in Banswara district of Rajasthan. Under the Mughal Empire, the main crossing was 1.5km further east on the south bank of the Narmada, known as Akbarpur (22\u00b008'58.6\"N 75\u00b028'13.7\"E). In the 16th and 17th century, this river-crossing lay on a route frequented by several foreign travellers to the Mughal court, from the Catal\u00e1n Jesuit Ant\u00f3nio de Monserrate in 1580 to the merchant William Finch (d. 1613) and captain John Jourdain (d. 1619) of the East India Company: Burhanpur\u2014Asirgarh\u2014Bhikangaon\u2014Akbarpur\u2014Mandu\u2014Depalpur\u2014Ujjain\u2014Barrai\u2014Sironj. This route seems to have suffered under Emperor Shah Jahan, when Handiya became the major conduit for military traffic to Deccan. But with the establishment of Maratha rule, the Khalghat/Akbarpur ford was revived in order to serve the towns of western Malwa, especially the new capital at Indore. The British main road from Bombay to Agra, which developed between 1840 and 1860, crossed Khalghat over a collapsible trestlework bridge, continuing through Indore, Sarangpur and Shivpuri to Gwalior. ==Geography== Dhar is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Khalghat It has an average elevation of 150 metres (495 feet).
