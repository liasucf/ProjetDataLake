It is a tree up to about tall, native to southern China, northeast India, Laos, northern Thailand, northern Myanmar and northern Vietnam. While the species is widespread, its populations are fragmented and it is threatened by cutting for timber as well as for using its bark and leaves for medicinal extracts.
