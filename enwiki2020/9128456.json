She is best known for her roles in Toei's action/erotic \"Pinky Violence\" series, which the company designed to compete with the popular independent genre of movies known as \"pink film.\" == Early life == On September 15, 1948, Oshida was born in Kyoto City, Japan. == Career == Oshida's career started after winning the 1966 International Teen Princess pageant (held in Chicago, Illinois). This led to a role in the Daiei Studios film School for Thieves (Kigeki: d\u00f4rob\u00f4 gakk\u00f4, 1968). She subsequently appeared in all four of Toei Company's Delinquent Girl Boss films. Unusually for a pink film actress, Oshida did not appear nude in any of her films. After the pink film's heyday of the 1970s passed, Oshida continued to appear in other roles. Her most recent appearance was in the 2005 film Satoru: Fourteen (Shonen to hoshi to jitensha). In the 1970s, Oshida was a J-pop singer. ==Selected filmography== *School for Thieves (Kigeki: d\u014drob\u014d gakk\u014d, 1968) *Crimson Bat - Oichi: Wanted, Dead or Alive (Mekurano Oichi inochi moraimasu, 1970) *Delinquent Girl Boss: Blossoming Night Dreams (Yume Wa Yoru Hirakua aka Tokyo Bad Girls / \u305a\u3079\u516c\u756a\u9577 \u5922\u306f\u591c\u3072\u3089\u304f, 1970) *Delinquent Girl Boss: Tokyo Drifters (Zubek\u00f4 banch\u00f4: Tokyo Nagaremono aka Girl Vagrants of Tokyo / \u305a\u3079\u516c\u756a\u9577 \u6771\u4eac\u6d41\u308c\u8005, 1970) *Delinquent Girl Boss: Ballad Of Yokohama Hoods (Zubek\u00f4 banch\u00f4: Hamagure Kazoe Uta / \u305a\u3079\u516c\u756a\u9577 \u306f\u307e\u3050\u308c\u6570\u3048\u5504, 1971) *Delinquent Girl Boss: Worthless to Confess (Zubek\u00f4 banch\u00f4: zange no neuchi mo nai / \u305a\u3079\u516c\u756a\u9577 \u3056\u3093\u3052\u306e\u5024\u6253\u3082\u306a\u3044, 1971) *Jealousy Game (1982) *Nemuri Kyoshirou TV Series (Bad Girl Wanna be - Arai Chapter - Akujo shigan!
