The album's sound is significantly more raw than on subsequent releases. In 2003, a completely re-recorded version of this album was released as Vampyr\u00ecsme.... Drummer Agaharet would leave the band before the album's completion, leaving vocalist Lord Vampyr to finish it alone. The album's title is French for \"Vampirism, necrophilia, necrosadism, scavenging\" \u2013 however, correct spelling in French would be N\u00e9cro- instead of N\u00e8cro- and Vampirisme instead of Vampyr\u00ecsme. Track 1 opens with a passage of Bram Stoker's famous 1897 novel Dracula, while track 8 samples Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Requiem. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Lord Vampyr (Alessandro Nunziati) \u2013 vocals, guitars, keyboards * Agaharet (Enrico De Dominicis) \u2013 drums * Count Morgoth (Roberto Cufaro) \u2013 keyboards * Domenico Mazzieri \u2013 executive production * Italo Angelozzi \u2013 recording Category:Theatres des Vampires albums Category:1996 debut albums ",
