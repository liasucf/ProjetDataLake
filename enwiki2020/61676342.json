    "text": "\"Dog\u016b with palms pressed together\", 2nd millennium BC The so-called is a Japanese dog\u016b or clay figurine of the late J\u014dmon period (c. 2000\u20131000 BC). Excavated from the Kazahari I Site in Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture, it is exhibited at the nearby Korekawa J\u014dmon Kan. Alongside \"Hollow Dog\u016b\" from Hokkaid\u014d, \"J\u014dmon Goddess\" from Yamagata Prefecture, and \"J\u014dmon Venus\" and \"Masked Goddess\" from Nagano Prefecture, it is one of five dog\u016b that have been designated National Treasures. ==Kazahari I Site== The is located some to the south of Hachinohe City Hall, on the right bank of the , with the river to the north and an area of swampy ground to the south. The Korekawa Site is on the opposite bank. The site extends some from east to west and from north to south, covering an area of , at an altitude of . Excavated by the Hachinohe City Board of Education over five seasons from 1988 to 1992, have been investigated to date, revealing a history of settlement over the longue dur\u00e9e, with finds from the early, middle, late, and final J\u014dmon period, Yayoi period, Nara period, and Heian period. In the second half of the late J\u014dmon period (second millennium BC), the settlement took the form of a large circular village, complete with pit dwellings, storage pits, and sunken buildings with earthfast posts, concentrically arranged around two groups of graves. ==Excavation== The dog\u016b with palms pressed together was unearthed during rescue excavation in July 1989. It was found at pit dwelling no. 15 by the inner north wall opposite the entrance, its back to the wall, facing into the house. A missing part of the left leg was found in the floor to the west. Typically recovered from external deposits, it is relatively unusual for a dog\u016b to be excavated in this way from inside a residence. One of seventy dog\u016b from Kazahari I, it is the only one that is complete. ==Description== The dog\u016b with palms pressed together measures in height, in width, and in depth. A female figure with small breasts and exposed genitalia, she sits with her knees raised, her arms resting on her legs, her (six-fingered) hands clasped together, as if in prayer. Her mouth, nose, eyes, and eyebrows \u2013 or those of a mask she may be wearing \u2013 are formed from appliqu\u00e9 strips of clay. She has a double incised necklace and no ears, while the top of her head tapers as if she is wearing a hat or has her hair up, complete with a hole as for a proto- kanzashi. From surviving pigment on the face and body, it is thought the entire figurine was once painted red. Traces of bitumen on the cracked left leg indicate an historic repair, suggesting the object was highly valued by its J\u014dmon-period owner and in use for some time. Many cruciform dog\u016b with outstretched arms have been found in northeast T\u014dhoku, dating from the early- to mid-J\u014dmon period. In the first half of the late J\u014dmon period, faces become more three-dimensional, with greater attention paid to the legs. In the second half, there is greater individualisation and variation of poses, including swollen bellies to indicate pregnancy. Based on such stylistic criteria, as well on that of associated ceramic finds, the dog\u016b has been dated to the second half of the late J\u014dmon period or around 1500 BC. ==Designation and exhibition== In 1996 an assemblage of some 666 late J\u014dmon artefacts excavated from the Kazahari I Site were designated an Important Cultural Property. In 2009, from among these objects, the dog\u016b with palms pressed together was designated a National Treasure. Housed at the Korekawa J\u014dmon Kan, Hachinohe City has licensed the brand of \"clay figurine with clasped hands\" to many local businesses. Exhibitions in which the figurine has featured include The Power of Dogu, at the British Museum in 2009, Dog\u016b, a Cosmos, at the Miho Museum in 2012, and Jomon: 10,000 Years of Prehistoric Art in Japan, at Tokyo National Museum in 2018. ==See also== * List of National Treasures of Japan (archaeological materials) * J\u014dmon Venus * Hollow Dog\u016b * Historic Sites of Aomori Prefecture ==References== Category:2nd-millennium BC works Category:1989 archaeological discoveries Category:J\u014dmon period Category:Prehistoric art Category:Japanese sculpture Category:National Treasures of Japan Category:Sculptures of women in Japan Category:Hachinohe ",
