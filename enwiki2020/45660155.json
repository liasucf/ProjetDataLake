On 30 May 2016 the commission, headed by Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Beno\u00eet, issued a report recommending the election be redone citing findings of significant fraud. While Haiti-based organizations found innumerable counts of fraud and proof of unfair elections on October 25, international observers endorsed the results before the interim government's report had been released. According to the U.S. Deputy Spokesman, for example, \"The United States regrets the decision by the Provisional Electoral Council to restart the presidential elections from the first round. This will increase time and resources needed to complete the 2015 electoral process and further delay installation of a constitutionally elected president.... The United States regrets that the electoral process has extended yet again, with the president-elect unlikely to be installed before February 7th, 2017.\" The National Human Rights Defense Network published one of several reports criticizing the happenings on election day, using Haitian observations to bolster claims apparently unseen by many international players. American officials discouraged rerunning the elections after spending $33 million on funding them. In an April 2016 visit to Haiti, Special Coordinator Kenneth H. Merten said that he hoped the verification process would be \"very, very fast\" and that it would not change the election results. Secretary of State John Kerry also emphasized the need to accept an elected government, citing the lack of international community patience with further delay. The U.S. Government responded to this report by announcing its refusal to provide funding to complete the Haitian elections. This development may prohibit international observers, often funded by the U.S., from observing the next electoral sessions. While the OAS received $1 million in U.S. funding for the October 25 election, the organization plans to continue observation, following a list of demanded changes to the Haitian electoral process. ==References== Category:2015 in Haiti Category:2016 in Haiti Category:Presidential elections in Haiti Category:2015 elections in the Caribbean Category:2016 elections in the Caribbean 2015 Category:October 2015 events in North America Category:Annulled elections ",
