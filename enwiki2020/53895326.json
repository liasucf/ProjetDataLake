    "text": "The eastern dwarf mulga snake (Pseudechis pailsei), also known commonly as the eastern pygmy mulga snake and the false king brown snake, is a species of venomous snake in the family Elapidae. The species, which is native to Australia, was genetically confirmed as a distinct species in 2017. ==Taxonomy== The eastern dwarf mulga snake was originally described in 1998 as Pailsus pailsei by Raymond Hoser. Wolfgang W\u00fcster identified that its specific name should be spelt pailsi under taxonomic rules in 2001. However, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Article 32.5.1) the original spelling should still be used, even though it is an incorrect latinization. ==Etymology== The specific name, pailsi, is in honour of Australian reptile breeder Roy Pails (born 1956).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).
