Iran halted use of the pipeline after Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown in the Iranian Islamic Revolution of 1979. The 254 km, 42\" pipeline's capacity from a special pier in Ashkelon to Eilat's port on the Red Sea is per day, and in the opposite direction. The pipeline is owned and operated by the Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company (EAPC) which also operates several other oil pipelines in Israel. In 2003, Israel and Russia made an agreement to supply Asian markets with Russian oil delivered by tankers from Novorossiysk to Ashkelon and then reloaded onto tankers in Eilat for shipment to Asia.Russian Oil to Transit Israel: The Trans-Israel Pipeline is Reborn The oil would therefore flow in the opposite direction to that intended originally. This route from Europe to Asia is shorter than the traditional one around Africa, and cheaper than the one via the Suez Canal. In December 2014, a breach near the southern end of the pipeline led to a massive oil spill into the Evrona Nature Reserve. Following seizure of the pipeline in 1979, Iran pursued a claim for compensation against Israel. On 27 June 2016, the Swiss Federal Tribunal decided the case in Iran's favour with an award of $1.1 billion plus interest. ==References== ==External links== *Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company Category:Oil pipelines in Israel Category:Iran\u2013Israel relations ",
