The group was founded in 1962 and in 1986 Heineken bought a stake in the company. The first product of the brasseries, and by far now their most sold and widely known, is the blonde lager Bourbon, known popularly as Dodo, named after the now extinct bird of Mauritius. Its logo of a smiling dodo and the creole slogan la dodo l\u00e9 la (the dodo is here) are found painted on the walls of establishments selling the beer. Since 1996, the group also produces some white and reddish beers. In addition, it also imports and bottles a variety of other drinks. ==External links== * Official site Category:Beer in Asia Category:Economy of R\u00e9union Category:Food and drink companies established in 1962 Category:Saint-Denis, R\u00e9union Category:1962 establishments in R\u00e9union ",
