    "text": "The 1967 Bluebonnet Bowl was a college football postseason bowl game between the Colorado Buffaloes and the Miami Hurricanes. ==Background== After winning eight games (including the Liberty Bowl) the previous season, the Hurricanes made consecutive bowl appearances for the first time since 1961-62. The Buffaloes finished 2nd in the Big Eight Conference, but they won eight games in their first bowl game appearance since 1962. ==Game summary== Larry Plantz scored first for the Buffaloes with a seven-yard touchdown run to give them a 7\u20130 lead with 4:16 to go in the 1st. Joe Mira responded for the Hurricanes with 14:12 to go in the 2nd with a touchdown run from two yards out to tie the game. With 5:46 to go, Jimmy Dye intercepted a Dan Kelly pass and returned it for 77 yards for a Miami touchdown. John Farler kicked a field goal with :07 left in the half to make it 14\u201310 Miami. An eighty-yard drive led to a touchdown culminated by QB Bobby Anderson (replacing Kelly due to an ankle problem) running in for a two-yard score to make it 17\u201314 with 11:11 to go in the 3rd. Jerry Daanen scored on a nine-yard touchdown catch from Bill Miller to make it 21\u201317 Miami with 14:55 to go in the 4th quarter. But Colorado took the lead back on an Anderson 38 yard touchdown run with 6:55 remaining. A Miami drive was stopped at their 43 on an Issac Howard interception, returned for 9 yards to the 34. With 1:02 remaining, Wilmer Cooks scored on a two-yard run to make it 31\u201321. Anderson was named MVP, passing for 5-of-10 for 49 yards and rushing for 108 yards on 17 carries, with two touchdowns. He also punted 7 rimes for 34.9 yards per punt. Colorado held onto the ball for 34:39, while Miami held onto it for 25:21. The Buffaloes were 7 of 15 on third downs, while the Hurricanes were 2 of 12. http://cu_ftp.sidearmsports.com/custompages/www.cubuffs.com/pdf1/101475.pdf ==Statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" !

Four years later, Colorado won the Bluebonnet Bowl (by then renamed the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl) once again. In their next two appearances in the bowl, however, they lost both times. ==References== Bluebonnet Bowl Category:Bluebonnet Bowl Category:Colorado Buffaloes football bowl games Category:Miami Hurricanes football bowl games Bluebonnet Bowl Category:December 1967 sports events ",
