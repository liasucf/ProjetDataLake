    "text": "Reuno Wangermez Lofofora is a French metal band from Paris. They write songs of protest and denounce some of the failings of the French society. For example, the problems in the underdeveloped outskirts, the hypocrisy of the politics of the French extreme right leagues. Among their titles are \"Buvez du cul\" and \"No Facho\". The band was created in 1989 and plays concerts in France as well as in Belgium and Canada. Lofofora is considered one of the pioneering acts of the rap metal genre in France. The band's name is taken from the peyote cactus' scientific name, Lophophora williamsii. ==Lineup== ===Current members=== *Reuno Wangermez \u2013 vocals (1989\u2013) *Phil Curty \u2013 bass (1989\u2013) *Daniel Descieux \u2013 guitar (2001\u2013) *Vincent Hernault \u2013 drums (2009\u2013) ===Past members=== *Karl \u2013 guitar (1989) *Erik Rossignol \u2013 drums (1989\u20131992) *Pascal Lalaurie \u2013 guitar (1990\u20131994) *Edgar Mireux \u2013 drums (1992\u20132001) *Farid Tadjene \u2013 guitar (1995\u20132001) *Pierre Belleville \u2013 drums (2001\u20132009) ==Discography== *L'Oeuf (1993) *Lofofora (1994) 5 tracks *Lofofora (1995) *Holiday in France (1995) *Peuh!
