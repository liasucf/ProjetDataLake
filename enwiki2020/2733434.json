Cabana was founded on January 2, 1857, although human habitation there likely predates arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors. The city is divided into four neighborhoods: *Huayumaca *Pacchamaca *San Jer\u00f3nimo *Trujillo ==History== Cabana was founded in 1711 with the name of \"Caguana\" which means \"To repair\" or \"to contemplate\" in the Cully Language (former language of this region)according to an old leyend. When the Spanish conquerors arrived to Caguana, the name was mispronounced and started to say \"Cabana\" instead of Caguana. Cabana was officially created by the Provisional Regulations on February 12, 1821 and then comprised to the vast province of Conchucos. Cabana was elevated to the level of district on December 2, 1856 under the Presidency of Don Don Ram\u00f3n Castilla. Then in 1861 the province of Conchucos was divided into two provinces: Pallasca and Pomabamba, the first with its capital Corongo and the second with its capital Pomabamba. On October 30, 1901, Cabana was elevated by law in the Capital of the province of Pallasca, this Act also gave him the title of \"Villa\" and on November 18, 1914 obtained the rank of City under Law No. 2631, a proposal of Priest Teodoro Gonzales Melendez and identified by Congressman Don Fausto Valdeavellano.

Different activities related to this celebration are performed. ==Dances== They represent past events as a tribute to the beliefs, desires and reflections of a people, we would say that dances update the story of a place and its inhabitants. In the Andean world dances are preserved from centuries old. Cabana pays tribute to the Patron Santiago Apostle with colorful dances, among them are: The Mojiganga, The Blanquillos and The Kiyayas; each of them with varied components between choreography, costumes, songs, music and interpretation. ===The Mojiganga=== Castilian word that means jocoso - funny, this stamp was introduced by the Spaniards, they represent the social situation of the people, shows characters from various social strata. The Mojiganga can be seen in two moments in the patronal festivities, which takes place every year in July, (1) very early in the mornings run on the main streets of the city inviting the general public to the \"paseo de res\" (toretes) that will be delivered in the afternoon to one of the devotees (stewards) of the party And (2) in the afternoon when delivering the Paseo de res (toretes) and dance to the beat of cash or Roncador. The characters that are depicted are: the patron and the patrona who are the people who have money and in place, the shepherd and shepherdess representing mestizos or rural people and the Vilches who is the intermediate character, expresses power domain on the cattle. The dresses of the patron and patrona are very luxurious. The man wears suits, wearing a hat and cane, the lady wears dress, veil, wallet and shoes stick. The shepherds wear an elegant dress, suitable for the party. The lady wears an embroidered skirt, blouse, ojotas and straw hat, and the pastor's cloths are dress trousers, shirt, wool poncho, pannier, straw hat and carries a whip in his hand. The Vilches wears a dress embroidered with fine gold or silver thread, a crown of feathers with colored mirrors and, in the back enjalma carries a reminder that is painted or corduroy cloth embroidered with threads of gold leaf and presents varied reasons, also brings in a neck mo\u00f1era (decorative ribbon) around the waist and a painted or embroidered pechera subsequently placed the res (toretes). All of them wear special masks. ===The Blanquillos=== Groups of warriors who were born in reaction against Spanish domination, like the \"Huanca\" and \"shacshas.\" The Blanquillo, toured many parts of Culture Conchucos, where the Spaniards were in place for killing them. These groups were warriors formed by townpeople Pasha, Spaniards and mestizos. They used to go early in the mornings fighting in main square of the city, that is why this dance shows the power struggle of those years. In those days, the \"Pashas\" spoke the \"Cully\" language and worshipped the god \"Catequilla \". We can see this stamp on July 24 and July 25 of each year. The Blanquillo dance through the main streets of the city to accompany the procession of Santiago Apostle. The group formed by 10 or 12 people, all wear elegant dresses made of corduroy fabric, yarn ornaments with gold leaf (Spanish-style), carry a face mask, a crown of feathers and colorful scarf colors . In his tour, the Blanquillo with a unique style, put his scarf in the shoulder of someone in the audience who can reward him with money, candy or soda. ===The Kiyayas=== Cully word that means \"consecrated women\". These group of ladies were designed to worship the \"God Catequilla\" and other gods (sun, moon, lightning and the rainbow). Always being around priests and the head of the high hierarchy of the Pashas. The Spaniards tried to exterminate this practice with its decrees and laws which were against cults, customs and languages. The KIYAYAS survived these abuses but as a stamp dance. s Like the \"Blanquillo\", the \"kiyayas\" are seen during the festivities in honor of the Santiago Apostle in July each year. Wearing a black skirt, with an opening from the side, decorated with threads of gold leaf and grecas of gold or silver, below the number fustanes wore white skirt decorated with special fabrics and reasons of culture Pasha, a white blouse with wide sleeves and bulky, In the head wearing a crown of showy flowers and tulle is covered with a bank, leather shoes are usually light.
