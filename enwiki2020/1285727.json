    "text": "Buddha in parinirvana, Gandhara art, 2nd or 3rd century Reclining Buddha of Galvihara at Polonnaruwa (Sri Lanka, 12th century) A reclining Buddha is an image that represents Buddha lying down and is a major iconographic theme in Buddhist art. It represents the historical Buddha during his last illness, about to enter the parinirvana. He is lying on his right side, his head resting on a cushion or relying on his right elbow, supporting his head with his hand. After the Buddha's death, his followers decide to build a statue of him lying down. They first built the reclining Buddha inside the Wat Pho Temple then, decades later, they started making the sculpture everywhere in South East Asia. This pattern seems to have emerged at the same time as other representations of the Buddha in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara. == In Thai art == For Thai Buddha attitudes (; parang Phra phut ta roupe), the reclining Buddha (; paang sai yat) can refer to three different episodes, whilst the attribute of each remains unclear. * Nirvana attitude (\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e34\u0e19\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e19; paang pari nipphan) * Teaching the Rahu Asurin attitude (\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e07\u0e42\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e39; paang proad asurin tra rahu) * Sleeping attitude (\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e07\u0e17\u0e23\u0e07\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e19; paang song phra subin) == Notable examples == Zhangye The reclining Buddha of the Hpo win caves Krati\u00e9, Cambodia Butunehanzu (\u4ecf\u6d85\u69c3\u56f3) at Kong\u014dbu-ji (Heian period) Burma: * Winsein Tawya Buddha (Mawlamyaing) - * Thanboddhay Pagoda (Monywa) - * Myathalyaung Buddha (Bago) - * Lawka Tharahpu Buddha (Dawei) - * Chaukhtatgyi Buddha Temple (Yangon) - * Shwethalyaung Buddha (Bago) - * Manuha Temple (Bagan) * Phowintaung, near Monywa Cambodia: * West side of the Baphuon in Angkor * Monolithic Buddha of the Phnom Kulen (lying on his left side) * Golden gilded Buddha on Sambok Mountain in Krati\u00e9 Province (on his right side) China *Dafo Temple, Zhangye Pakistan: * Bhamala Buddha Parinirvana which is 1,800 years old, oldest in the world.
