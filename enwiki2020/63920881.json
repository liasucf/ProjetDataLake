    "text": "Benign Peak is a elevation mountain summit located in the western Chugach Mountains, in Anchorage Municipality in the U.S. state of Alaska. The mountain is situated in Chugach State Park, east of Anchorage, and south of Eklutna Lake. The nearest higher peak is Mount Rumble, to the southwest, and The Mitre is set east-southeast, on the opposite side of the Eklutna Glacier. Although modest in elevation, relief is significant since the eastern aspect of the mountain rises over 5,000 feet above this glacier in approximately one mile. This peak belongs to a group of peaks in the Eklutna River drainage which start with the letter \"B\", such as Bold Peak, Bashful Peak, Baleful Peak, and Mt. Beelzebub. Benign Peak was so named in 1965 by the Mountaineering Club of Alaska because \"nearby Bellicose Peak was a much harder climb, while this one's nature was quite benign since the rock was not too rotten and the weather wasn't too bad.\"Donald J. Orth, Dictionary of Alaska Place Names, 1967, page 124. Benign Peak's name was officially adopted in 1966 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The first ascent of this mountain was made in August 1965 by Art Davidson and John Vincent Hoeman by ascending the East Face, and descending the South Gully.The Western Chugach Range, Alaska, American Alpine Club ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Benign Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Weather systems coming off the Gulf of Alaska are forced upwards by the Chugach Mountains (orographic lift), causing heavy precipitation in the form of rainfall and snowfall. Temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below \u221230 \u00b0C. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Cook Inlet via the Eklutna River and Peters Creek. ==See also== *List of mountain peaks of Alaska *Geology of Alaska ==References== ==External links== * Benign Peak: Weather Forecast Category:Mountains of Alaska Category:Mountains of Anchorage, Alaska ",
