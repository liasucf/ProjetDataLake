The band members are Mark Wystrach (lead vocals, guitar), Jess Carson (guitar, vocals), and Cameron Duddy (bass guitar, vocals). Through Big Machine Records, the band has released a self-titled EP and two studio albums, On the Rocks and Let It Roll, which have accounted for four charted singles on the Billboard country chart: \"Drinkin' Problem\", \"Make a Little\", \"Burn Out\", and \"Mr. Lonely\". Midland's musical styles are defined by neotraditional country and country rock influences. ==History== Mark Wystrach performing at the 2018 99.9 KISS Country Cook Off. Named after the Dwight Yoakam song \"Fair to Midland\", the band was founded in Dripping Springs, Texas. The trio met separately around Los Angeles, where Jess Carson and Cameron Duddy had formed an earlier band. Duddy and Mark Wystrach met and formed a band after Carson left L.A. and moved to Texas. The trio met up in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for Duddy\u2019s wedding in August 2013; both Wystrach and Carson acted as groomsmen. As Duddy recalls the story, Carson and Wystrach arrived in Jackson Hole for the wedding a week early. After playing songs together on the front porch of Carson\u2019s cabin, they decided to form the band. After Duddy's honeymoon, they went to the Sonic Ranch in El Paso, TX; as stated by Wystrach, \"when we went to the Sonic Ranch, we became a band. We walked away believing in what had happened.\" The band re-based in Texas. Mark Wystrach grew up surrounded by music as his parents were both fans of live music. His father was an immigrant living in Los Angeles. His mother grew up on a ranch near Tucson, Arizona. His parents owned a live honky-tonk country music venue. Wystrach is also an actor and model. Jess Carson Jess Carson grew up on a farm in Oregon where the main genre was country music. His sister and father were both musicians, so after some years, he started to play guitar. Carson is also a songwriter. Cameron Duddy Cameron Duddy started playing music after a difficult situation in his family; he found that music helped to lessen the tension, saying, \"Sometimes you don't get to talk about all the things that you maybe want to talk about and the ice breaker started to be music.\" He got his first guitar from his father; it helped him find his identity. Duddy is also a music video director; he won an MTV Video Music Award for the video \"Locked Out of Heaven\" by Bruno Mars. Midland's first song, \"Fourteen Gears\", was around 2015. The song, according to Duddy, was \"another one of the early moments that defined and solidified the band.\" === 2016\u2013present: Midland EP, On the Rocks, and Let It Roll === On March 9, 2016, the trio signed to Big Machine Records and released the Midland EP featuring a debut single, \"Drinkin' Problem\", which charted on Billboard's Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay. The band wrote the song with Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne, the former of whom also produced it. Duddy directed the song's music video. Their debut album On the Rocks was released in September 22, 2017, produced by Dann Huff, Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne. Midland released \"Make a Little\" as the second single. \"Burn Out\" was the third single, it was released in late 2018. Midland was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2018: Grammy Award for Best Country Song and Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance, both for \"Drinkin\u2019 Problem\". Midland released the single \"Mr. Lonely\" in February 2019 as the leadoff single to a second album. Midland released \"Cheatin' Songs\" in February of 2020 as the second single to the album. The album, Let It Roll, was released on August 23, 2019. The band began a tour in June to support the album. == Style and influences == Rolling Stone said that \"the Texas-based band blend their voices to produce country music that recalls a mix of George Strait, Urban Cowboy and Seventies yacht rock.\" Billboard describes the band's sound as \"a definite George Strait '80s New Traditionalist feel to it, combined with the rich California harmonies that made The Eagles legendary.\" Midland also known for its dressing style, similar to the original Nudie Suits. Vogue called Midland heartthrobs and fashion risk takers.\" ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details ! colspan=\"5\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\"| Sales |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US Country ! style=\"width:45px;\"| AUS ! style=\"width:45px;\"| CAN ! style=\"width:45px;\"| UK |- ! scope=\"row\"| On the Rocks | * Release date: September 22, 2017 * Label: Big Machine | 20 | 2 | \u2014 | 45 | \u2014 | *US: 112,500 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Let It Roll | * Release date: August 23, 2019 * Label: Big Machine | 16 | 1 | 72 | 37 | 75 | *US: 41,300 |- | colspan=\"9\" style=\"font-size: 8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart |} ===Live albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details ! style=\"width:9em;\"| Sales |- ! scope=\"row\"| Live from the Palomino | * Release date: February 28, 2020 * Label: Big Machine | *US: 400 |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details !| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\"| Sales |- style=\"font- size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US Heat |- ! scope=\"row\"| Midland | * Release date: October 28, 2016 * Label: Big Machine | 18 | *US: 19,500 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! colspan=\"5\"| Peak positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\"| Sales ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Certifications ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- style=\"font- size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US Country ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US Country Airplay ! style=\"width:45px;\"| CAN ! style=\"width:45px;\"| CAN Country |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2017 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Drinkin' Problem\" | 45 || 4 || 3 || 98 || 1 | *US: 452,000 | *RIAA: 2\u00d7 Platinum | style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"3\"| On the Rocks |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Make a Little\" | \u2014 || 23 || 15 || \u2014 || 12 | | |- |2018 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Burn Out\" | 63 || 11 || 3 || \u2014 || 29 | *US: 82,000 | *RIAA: Gold |- |2019 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Mr. Lonely\" | \u2014 || 31 || 23 || \u2014 || 32 | | | style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Let It Roll |- |2020 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Cheatin' Songs\" | \u2014 || 41 || 26 || \u2014 || 48 | | |} Notes ===Music videos=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
