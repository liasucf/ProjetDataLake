    "text": "This article contains mathematical proofs for some properties of addition of the natural numbers: the additive identity, commutativity, and associativity. These proofs are used in the article Addition of natural numbers. ==Definitions== This article will use the Peano axioms for the definitions of addition of the natural numbers, and the successor function S(a). In particular: {| |- | A1: || a + 0 = a |- | A2: || a + S(b) = S(a + b) |} For the proof of commutativity, it is useful to define another natural number closely related to the successor function, namely \"1\". We define 1 to be the successor of 0, in other words, :1 = S(0). Note that for all natural numbers a, {| |- | || S(a) |- | = || S(a + 0) || [by A1] |- | = || a + S(0) || [by A2] |- | = || a + 1 || [by Def. of 1] |} == Proof of associativity == We prove associativity by first fixing natural numbers a and b and applying induction on the natural number c. For the base case c = 0, : (a+b)+0 = a+b = a+(b+0) Each equation follows by definition [A1]; the first with a + b, the second with b. Now, for the induction. We assume the induction hypothesis, namely we assume that for some natural number c, : (a+b)+c = a+(b+c) Then it follows, {| |- | || (a + b) + S(c) |- |= || S((a + b) + c) || [by A2] |- | = || S(a + (b + c)) || [by the induction hypothesis] |- | = || a + S(b + c) || [by A2] |- | = || a + (b + S(c)) || [by A2] |} In other words, the induction hypothesis holds for S(c). Therefore, the induction on c is complete. == Proof of identity element == Definition [A1] states directly that 0 is a right identity. We prove that 0 is a left identity by induction on the natural number a. For the base case a = 0, 0 + 0 = 0 by definition [A1]. Now we assume the induction hypothesis, that 0 + a = a. Then {| |- | || 0 + S(a) |- | = || S(0 + a) || [by A2] |- | = || S(a) || [by the induction hypothesis] |} This completes the induction on a. == Proof of commutativity == We prove commutativity (a + b = b + a) by applying induction on the natural number b. First we prove the base cases b = 0 and b = S(0) = 1 (i.e. we prove that 0 and 1 commute with everything). The base case b = 0 follows immediately from the identity element property (0 is an additive identity), which has been proved above: a + 0 = a = 0 + a. Next we will prove the base case b = 1, that 1 commutes with everything, i.e. for all natural numbers a, we have a + 1 = 1 + a. We will prove this by induction on a (an induction proof within an induction proof). We have proved that 0 commutes with everything, so in particular, 0 commutes with 1: for a = 0, we have 0 + 1 = 1 + 0. Now, suppose a + 1 = 1 + a. Then {| |- | || S(a) + 1 |- | = || S(a) + S(0) || [by Def. of 1] |- | = || S(S(a) + 0) || [by A2] |- | = || S((a + 1) + 0) || [as shown above] |- | = || S(a + 1) || [by A1] |- | = || S(1 + a) || [by the induction hypothesis] |- | = || 1 + S(a) || [by A2] |} This completes the induction on a, and so we have proved the base case b = 1. Now, suppose that for all natural numbers a, we have a + b = b + a. We must show that for all natural numbers a, we have a + S(b) = S(b) + a. We have {| |- | || a + S(b) |- | = || a + (b + 1) || [as shown above] |- | = || (a + b) + 1 || [by associativity] |- | = || (b + a) + 1 || [by the induction hypothesis] |- | = || b + (a + 1) || [by associativity] |- | = || b + (1 + a) || [by the base case b = 1] |- | = || (b + 1) + a || [by associativity] |- | = || S(b) + a || [as shown above] |} This completes the induction on b. == See also== *Binary operation *Proof *Ring == References == *Edmund Landau, Foundations of Analysis, Chelsea Pub Co. .
