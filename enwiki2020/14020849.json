He was sent forward on reconnaissance and on his > return he reported to his company commander the fact that there was an enemy > machinegun nest and several well-placed snipers directly in the path and > awaiting the company. Sgt. Specker requested and was granted permission to > place 1 of his machineguns in a position near the enemy machinegun. > Voluntarily and alone he made his way up the mountain with a machinegun and > a box of ammunition. He was observed by the enemy as he walked along and was > severely wounded by the deadly fire directed at him. Though so seriously > wounded that he was unable to walk, he continued to drag himself over the > jagged edges of rock and rough terrain until he reached the position at > which he desired to set up his machinegun. He set up the gun so well and > fired so accurately that the enemy machine-gun nest was silenced and the > remainder of the snipers forced to retire, enabling his platoon to obtain > their objective. Sgt. Specker was found dead at his gun. His personal > bravery, self-sacrifice, and determination were an inspiration to his > officers and fellow soldiers. ==See also== *List of Medal of Honor recipients ==References== * * Category:1921 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Odessa, Missouri Category:American army personnel killed in World War II Category:United States Army Medal of Honor recipients Category:United States Army soldiers Category:World War II recipients of the Medal of Honor ",
