    "text": "Topocuvirus is a genus of viruses, in the family Geminiviridae. Dicotyledonous plants serve as natural hosts. There is currently only one species in this genus: the type species Tomato pseudo-curly top virus. Diseases associated with this genus include: vein swelling, curling of the leaves and leaf distortion. ==Taxonomy== Group: ssDNA ==Structure== Viruses in Topocuvirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral geometries, and T=1 symmetry. The diameter is around 22 nm, with a length of 38 nm. Genomes are circular and non-segmented, around 2.86kb in length. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! Genus !!

Entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell. Replication follows the ssDNA rolling circle model. DNA-templated transcription is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by nuclear pore export, and tubule-guided viral movement. Dicotyledonous plants serve as the natural host. The virus is transmitted via a vector (treehopper). Transmission routes are vector. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Genus !! Host details !! Tissue tropism !! Entry details !! Release details !! Replication site !!
