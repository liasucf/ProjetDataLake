He received at baptism the name of Girolamo, which he changed to that of Luigi when he took, in 1612, the garb of the Theatines. After having studied theology and entered the priesthood at Venice, he returned to his native city, where he occupied different positions in his order. He was well skilled in the Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac languages, and enjoyed the esteem of the princes and learned men of his time. He died at Verona in 1656. Of his value as a writer, Nic\u00e9ron says: \"His natural vivacity would not allow him to polish his productions; he placed indiscriminately upon paper all that he found in his collections upon the subject of which he was treating, whether good or bad; the desire of using all he had gathered often caused him to make digressions, which only served to swell his books. He also thought more of making large and numerous works than of composing good ones.\" Most noteworthy of his works are, Electa sacra (Venice, Lyon, and Verona, 1627-1645, 5 vols. fol.); vol. II, which, in a diffuse and mystical style, contains a eulogy of the Virgin, has had three editions: \u2014 Risus sardonicus, hoc est deflecta mundi laetitia (Verona, 1630, 12mo): Schediasmata sacro-prophana (Lyon, 1635, fol.): \u2014 Adagia ex SS. Patrum ecclesiasticorumque scriptorum monumentis prompta (ibid. 1637, 2 vols. fol.); according to Nic\u00e9ron, vol. xl. p. 218 (who gives a list of twenty-seven of Novarini's works), each of the two volumes contains explanations of one thousand adages: \u2014 Matthaeus, Marcus, Lucas, et Joananes expensi (ibid. 1642-1643, 3 vols. fol.); a series of moral commentaries upon the evangelists and the Acts of the Apostles: \u2014 Paulus expensus (Verona, 1644, fol.): \u2014 Omnium scientiarum anima, hoc est axiomata physio-theologica (Lyons, 1644, 3 vols. fol.): \u2014 Moses expensus (Verona, 1646-1648, 2 vols. fol.): \u2014 Encyclopaedia epistolaris (Venice, 1645, fol.): \u2014 Admiranda orbis Christiani (ibid. 1680, 2 vols. fol.); this compilation, in which are found many fabulous things, has been edited by the care of J. B. Bagatta, a Theatine monk. ==References== Attribution: * Category:1594 births Category:1656 deaths Category:17th-century Italian writers Category:17th-century male writers Category:Italian Roman Catholic theologians Category:Theatines ",
