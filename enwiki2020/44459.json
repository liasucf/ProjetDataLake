Close has credited her acting abilities to her early years: \"I have no doubt that the days I spent running free in the evocative Connecticut countryside with an unfettered imagination, playing whatever character our games demanded, is one of the reasons that acting has always seemed so natural to me.\"In a speech at Princeton University on February 19, 2009 Although Close has an affluent background, she has stated that her family chose not to participate in WASP society. She would also avoid mentioning her birthplace whenever asked because she did not want people to think she was a \"dilettante who didn't have to work\".

She once stated that her desire to become an actress allowed her to break away from MRA, adding: \"I have long [ago] forgiven my parents for any of this. They had their reasons for doing what they did, and I understand them. It had terrible effects on their kids, but that's the way it is. We all try to survive, right?

Close, to this day, credits her nomination to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, stating That hat was designed so the sunlight would come through. We waited for a certain time of day, so the sun was shining through the back of the stadium. And he had a lens that muted the people around me. It was an incredibly well thought-out shot.

Close also starred opposite Robert Duvall in the drama The Stone Boy (1984), a film about a family coping after their youngest child accidentally kills his older brother in a hunting accident.

Close was asked about her contributions to independent films, to which she responded \"I love the casts that gather around a good piece of writing certainly not for the money but because it is good and challenging. Sometimes I've taken a role for one scene that I thought was phenomenal. Also my presence can help them get money, so it's I think a way for me to give back.\" ====Return to film and continued acclaim (2011\u2013present)==== Close at the 2017 279x279px In December 2010, Close began filming Albert Nobbs in Dublin.

And I said, 'No I won't.' Some people will change their point of view, and those who are either too old, or too blinkered, to accept the beauty of difference will just have to 'die off'.\" In the film, Close played the title role of Albert Nobbs, a woman living her life as a man in 19th century Ireland after being sexually assaulted as a young girl. Despite the film overall receiving mixed reviews, Close's performance garnered critical acclaim, as it was noted for being the most subtle and introverted of her career to that point and a departure from her other roles. Close was asked about the fact of not having an Oscar during the film's awards campaign, for which she answered: \"And I remember being astounded that I met some people who were really kind of almost hyper- ventilating as to whether they were going to win or not, and I have never understood that. Because if you just do the simple math, the amount of people who are in our two unions, the amount of people who in our profession are out of work at any given time, the amount of movies that are made every year, and then you're one of five. How could you possibly think of yourself as a loser?\" After her television series Damages ended, Close returned to film in 2014, in which she played Nova Prime Rael in the Marvel Studios film Guardians of the Galaxy.

Working with Guskin, Close learned several important lessons, which she said she's applied to her career as well as her life. One such lesson, she claims, was to \"read the lines off the page\" and remembering to breathe.

It's how we're wired, and it's not a bad thing.\" Close says that she went to every rehearsal in order to master her acting skills . On method acting, Close claims that while she found it an interesting technique, it was not her preferred style. Although Close does extensive research and preparation for her roles, she also relies less on the technicality of a performance saying, \"Good acting I think is like being a magician, in that you make people believe; because it's only when they believe that they are moved. And I want people to get emotionally involved. I think technique is important but it isn't everything. You can have a great technical actor who'll leave people cold. That's not my idea of great acting. As audience, I don't want to be aware of acting.\" Longtime collaborator and playwright Christopher Hampton describes Close an actress who can very easily convey \"a sense of strength and intelligence.\" Hampton worked on Sunset Boulevard and the stage production of Dangerous Liaisions, later casting Close in the movie version of the latter production. \"Glenn is often described as having a glacial or distant quality about her, but in person she's the absolute opposite: warm and intimate,\" says the actor Iain Glen, who co- starred with her in the 2002 stage production of A Streetcar Named Desire. \"She was able to bring strength to the role, she was able to completely access that vulnerability. There was a real softness to her.\" However, Close is consistently praised for her roles as the villain or antagonist in her performances. Her character in Fatal Attraction was ranked number 7 on AFI's 100 years...100 heroes and villains list. Regarding her role in the series Damages, The New York Times remarked, \"There is no actor dead or alive as scary as a smiling Glenn Close.\" Journalist Christopher Hooton also praised her, saying, \"Christopher Walken, Glenn Close, Al Pacino, and many others have a surprising danger in them. They're a little scary to be around, because you feel they might jump you or blow up at you at any time. They are ticking time bombs.\" Film historian Cari Beauchamp has stated, \"When you look at the top 10 actresses of the past 80 years, since sound came in, first you have Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn and Meryl Streep \u2013 but I think Glenn Close is definitely in that list, it's a combination of her guts, in the roles she chooses, and her perseverance. Frankly, she's taken roles that are more challenging than a lot of other people.\" On January 12, 2009, Close was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard, in front of the Roosevelt Hotel. , films featuring Close have grossed over $1.3 billion in North America.
