The film is based on her 1983 autobiography Second Serve: The Ren\u00e9e Richards StoryRichards, Ren\u00e9e with John Ames. \"Second Serve: the Ren\u00e9e Richards Story\". New York City, New York, USA: Stein and Day, March 1983, that was written with John Ames. The script is by Stephanie Liss and Gavin Lambert and the film was directed by Anthony Page. Second Serve aired on CBS on May 13, 1986. ==Plot== In 1976, Ren\u00e9e Richards is on the tennis court as a professional tennis player. The film flashes back to 1964, when Ren\u00e9e Richards is an eye surgeon named Richard Radley (both roles played by Redgrave). Radley has a successful career and a fianc\u00e9e, but secretly cross-dresses at night. Unable to speak with his mother Sadie (Louise Fletcher), who is a psychiatrist, Radley consults his own psychiatrist, Dr. Beck (Martin Balsam), who advises him to grow a beard. This strategy works temporarily until Radley is drafted into the Navy, which does not allow beards. Following his discharge and a failed marriage, Radley undergoes gender reassignment surgery and becomes Ren\u00e9e. Ren\u00e9e relocates to California, resumes her career as a surgeon and begins dating. After playing in a local tennis tournament in La Jolla, Ren\u00e9e is outed as transgender by a television reporter. In the ensuing controversy, Ren\u00e9e takes the United States Tennis Association to court, where she secures her right to play professional tournament tennis as a woman without being subjected to chromosome testing. ==Cast== * Vanessa Redgrave as Richard Radley/Renee RichardsRichards' birth name was Richard Raskind but the name was changed to Richard Radley for the film. **Whit Hertford as Young Richard Radley * Martin Balsam as Dr. Beck * William Russ as Josh * Alice Krige as Gwen * Kerrie Keane as Meriam * Richard Venture as Dr. David Radley * Reni Santoni as Dr. Roberto Granato * Louise Fletcher as Dr. Sadie M. Bishop * Jeff Corey as Dr. Harry Benjamin ==Critical reception== Critic John J. O'Connor of The New York Times praised Redgrave's performance. Although noting that from a physical standpoint Redgrave is not very believable, O'Connor calls her performance \"astonishingly convincing\". While finding the script wanting for its tendency to reduce complexities to cliches, O'Connor also found that Second Serve \"does manage, despite oversimplifications and evasions, to stick to the point. But it is the extraordinary Redgrave performance that slams the message home.\" New York magazine concurred in this assessment, with reviewer John Leonard calling the film \"calm and matter-of-fact, and perhaps too tidy\". Leonard lavished Redgrave with praise for her performance, writing: > Redgrave, tall and vulnerable, athletic and bewildered, fearful and loving > competitive and lonely, manages to transsex both ways. She embodies, with > the fine bones of that face and the twitching of her various limbs, every > internal contradiction of the polymorphously perverse.\" Second Serve was not universally praised by critics, receiving negative reviews from such outlets as the Chicago Sun-Times. Redgrave was nominated for an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe for her performance and Second Serve won Emmys for hairstyling and makeup. ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:1986 television films Category:1986 films Category:1980s biographical films Category:1986 LGBT-related films Category:American films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American biographical films Category:Biographical films about sportspeople Category:Films about trans women Category:1983 non-fiction books Category:Transgender literature Category:Tennis films Category:Films set in 1964 Category:Films set in 1976 Category:CBS network films Category:Films directed by Anthony Page Category:Films scored by Brad Fiedel Category:Cultural depictions of tennis players Category:Cultural depictions of transgender and transsexual people Category:Cultural depictions of American women Category:LGBT-related films based on actual events ",
