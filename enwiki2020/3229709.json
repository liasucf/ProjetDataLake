    "text": "Platform view of U4 Berlin Innsbrucker Platz is a railway station in the Sch\u00f6neberg district of Berlin and located on the square of the same name. It is served by the Ringbahn lines , and of the Berlin S-Bahn, as well as by the U-Bahn line . The platform is too short to cope for more than six cars. A buffer marks the end of the short U4 line, with an elongation not in sight.J. Meyer-Kronthaler: Berlins U-Bahnh\u00f6fe. be.bra Verlag (1996) == History == The U-Bahn station opened in 1910 with the original name Hauptstra\u00dfe after the section of the Reichsstra\u00dfe 1 running through the districts of Sch\u00f6neberg and Friedenau. It was renamed Innsbrucker Platz, after the Tyrolean capital Innsbruck, with the inauguration of the S-Bahn station in 1933. After the war the station was reopened in 1945. In the 1970s the entrance was changed a few times due to the construction of a tunnel in the course of the BAB 100 motorway (Stadtring). After the underground station had been badly damaged in the Second World War, but it was back into operation on 16 December 1945, the access to the station was completely rebuilt in 1954. The access on the central island was closed, instead a new entrance was created north of the square in the Innsbrucker Stra\u00dfe in a glazed pavilion in the typical style of the 1950s, which led directly to the platform via a staircase. The construction of the Stadtautobahn 100, built as a city ring, which was led through a tunnel under the Innsbrucker Platz, made a further conversion necessary between 1971 and 1979. Between the road surface and the motorway tunnel, a large distribution floor was created, and the southern tunnel of the existing subway was separated. A further construction of the U4 to the south was thus no longer possible, and also the parking facility south of the Innsbrucker Platz could not be used. Since then, the tracks of the U4 end bluntly on the platform. == Notes == Category:Berlin U-Bahn stations Category:Berlin S-Bahn stations Category:Buildings and structures in Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg Category:Railway stations in Germany opened in 1910 ",
