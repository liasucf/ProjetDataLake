    "text": "The All New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy in 'For Love or Mummy' is a 1999 comedy film directed by John R. Cherry III and Larry Harmon based on the film shorts of Laurel & Hardy. It stars Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain re- creating the eponymous characters played by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. This was the first of only two non-Ernest P. Worrell films that Cherry, primarily an advertising executive, has ever directed, the other being Pirates of the Plain. Harmon earned writing and directing credits through the ownership of the Laurel and Hardy trademarks, which he had purchased in the 1960s. Another Harmon-owned character, Bozo the Clown, is mentioned in the film. ==Premise== Laurel and Hardy are in Florida where they meet archeologist Henry Covington, whose daughter they try to protect from the wrath of a mummy. ==Cast== * Bronson Pinchot: Stan * Gailard Sartain: Ollie * F.
