Owned by Gray Television, it is a sister station to Fargo-licensed NBC affiliate KVLY-TV (channel 11). The two outlets share studios on 21st Avenue South in Fargo, where KXJB-LD's transmitter is also located. Due to KXJB's low-power status, its over-the-air signal does not adequately cover the vast Fargo\u2013Grand Forks market. Therefore, the station's main CBS channel is simulcast in 720p high-definition on KVLY's second digital subchannel to increase its over-the-air broadcasting radius; this signal can be seen on UHF channel 36 (or virtual channel 11 via PSIP) from a transmitter near Blanchard. The KVLY tower also transmits KXJB's much lower powered translator K28MA-D (licensed to Argusville), carrying all of KXJB's subchannels on channel 28. A second translator, K30LR-D in Grand Forks, carries all of the KXJB subchannels on channel 30. KXJB's main CBS channel can be seen on cable channel 9 on Midco and Sparklight, DirecTV channel 30, Dish Network channel 4 (an attribute to the predecessor CBS affiliate's licensed channel), and in full high definition on Midco digital channel 604 and Sparklight digital channel 1009. It is also available on Hulu's Live TV service and YouTube TV. ==History== ===KXJB intellectual unit=== Until December 2014, the KXJB call sign and CBS affiliation were used on the broadcast license presently associated with KRDK-TV. KXJB was co-owned with the KX Television network in western North Dakota from 1959 to 1971. The station never changed its network affiliation until late 2014, when Major Market Broadcasting purchased the station. CBS was also carried with Grand Forks newscasts and commercials on KXJC-LP, channel 35, as a semi-satellite of KXJB, from 2000 until the license for that station was canceled in April 2003, due to KVLY-TV taking over operations of the original KXJB. On November 12, 2014, KVLY added a simulcast of KXJB on its second digital subchannel, displacing MeTV to the third subchannel. KXJB-TV signed off the air at 12 midnight CT on December 1, 2014, CBS programming continued to be available on KVLY-DT2, hence making KVLY-DT2 the sole CBS affiliate in the area. KVLY-DT2 also retained the original \"KX4\" branding of the original CBS affiliate.http://www.valleynewslive.com/home/headlines/284288191.html KXJB was sold to Major Market Broadcasting on December 18 of that year. Channel 4 returned to the air on January 13, 2015 as KRDK-TV, now an affiliate of multiple multi-cast networks, including Cozi TV on its main subchannel, and locally operated BEK Sports, featuring local high school sports coverage in the area, on KRDK-DT2 and in primetime on the main subchannel. Most of KRDK's other eight subchannels provide programming from various classic TV and movie networks. ===Current license=== Gray signed on three low power TV stations on September 2016, with the KXJB call sign and translators replicating coverage in areas with strong coverage of the previous KXJB-TV. KXJB's CBS channel, also broadcast on KVLY 11.2, carries CBS and other programs in KXJB-TV's 1080i HD format, the second subchannel carrying The CW Plus (previously on WDAY-TV 6.2 and WDAZ-TV 8.2), and the third subchannel carrying Heroes & Icons (previously on KRDK-TV). In October 2016, KRDK-TV requested must-carry on channel 4 (the former home of KXJB prior to December 2014). The area's pay TV providers then moved \"KX4\" to channel 9, though this put the channel closer to the other major affiliates on those systems, as WDAY-TV is on cable channel 6, with KVRR on channel 10 and KVLY on channel 11. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The third subchannel carries Heroes & Icons (previously carried in the market on KRDK-TV), which is also available on Midco cable channel 593. ==Programming== Syndicated programming on KXJB-LD includes Jeopardy!, Hot Bench, and Judge Judy among others. Wheel of Fortune, which is usually paired with Jeopardy! in most markets, airs instead on NBC-affiliated sister station KVLY-TV; Fargo is one of the few markets where Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune are carried on separate stations. ==News operation== KXJB produces its own newscasts on weekdays at noon, 5:30 p.m., and 6:30 p.m., with the CBS Evening News being carried at 6:00 p.m. instead of the normal 5:30 p.m. slot on most CBS affiliates in the Central Time Zone. The morning Valley Today, 10:00 p.m., and weekend newscasts are simulcast with KVLY. This combined news operation is known as Valley News Live. On September 12, 2016, KXJB launched a prime time newscast on its CW- affiliated subchannel known as Valley News Live at 9. The half-hour broadcast offers direct competition to Fox affiliate KVRR's long established hour long newscast airing at the same time and WDAY-TV's half-hour WDAY'Z Xtra News at 9 on its second and third subchannels, which was launched just weeks before Fargo CW's 9:00 p.m. newscast. ==See also== * Channel 4 branded TV stations in the United States * Channel 30 digital TV stations in the United States * Channel 30 low-power TV stations in the United States * Channel 30 virtual TV stations in the United States ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:CBS low-power network affiliates Category:The CW subchannel-only affiliates Category:Television channels and stations established in 2016 Category:2016 establishments in North Dakota Category:Television stations in the Fargo\u2013Grand Forks market Category:Gray Television Category:Heroes & Icons affiliates ",
