It was contested from May 22\u201327, 2015 at The Concession Golf Club in Bradenton, Florida. The tournament was hosted by the University of South Florida. Two championships were awarded: team and individual. This was the first time that the men's and women's Division I golf tournaments were played at the same location; the 2015 NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championship will be held in Bradenton from May 29 to June 3. ==Regional qualifying tournaments== *Four regional qualifying tournaments were held across the United States from May 7\u20139, 2015. *The six teams with the lowest team scores qualified from each of the four regional tournaments for both the team and individual national championships. *The three individuals not affiliated with one of the other teams in their regional with the lowest score also qualified for the individual national championship. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Regional name !Location !Qualified teams^ |- | Raleigh Regional | Raleigh, North Carolina | South Carolina, Northwestern, NC State, Alabama, LSU, Campbell |- | South Bend Regional | South Bend, Indiana | Duke, Wake Forest, UC Davis, Arizona, Tulane, Purdue |- | San Antonio Regional | San Antonio, Texas | Baylor, UCLA, Tennessee, Texas A&M;, Washington, Texas Tech |- | St. George Regional | St. George, Utah | Southern California, Stanford, Arkansas, UNLV, Virginia, California |} ^ Teams listed in qualifying order. ==Venue== This is the first NCAA Division I Women's Golf Championship held at The Concession Golf Club in Bradenton, Florida. This is the first time the tournament has been hosted by the University of South Florida. ==Format== For the first time in NCAA women's golf history the National Championship would follow the format used for the men's National Championship adopted in 2009. All teams played 54 holes with the team score consisting of the four best scores of the five-player team for each individual round. The top 15 teams and the top 9 individuals after 54 holes advanced to the fourth round. The top eight teams after 72 holes advanced to the match play competition. The individual award was given at the end of the stroke play part of the competition, recognizing the individual who had the best combined score over the four rounds. In match play, all five players play just as before and each match is worth one point with matches that end all-square are either postponed then continued, continued immediately or called a halve depending on the scores for both teams. For example, if Team A ties with Team B 2.5\u20132.5, the match that was all-square after 18 holes resumes in a sudden-death playoff. ==Team competition== ===Leaderboard=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Place!!Team!!Round 1!!Round 2!!Round 3!!Round 4!!Total!!To par |-style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" | 1 || align=left|Southern California || 297 || 303 || 298 || 294 || 1192 || +40 |-style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" | 2 || align=left|Duke || 293 || 309 || 292 || 303 || 1197 || +45 |-style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" | 3 || align=left|Baylor || 297 || 307 || 306 || 288 || 1198 || +46 |-style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" | 4 || align=left|Stanford || 293 || 323 || 296 || 287 || 1199 || +47 |-style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" | 5 || align=left|Arizona || 300 || 311 || 294 || 300 || 1205 || +53 |-style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" | rowspan=2|T6 || align=left|Tennessee || 301 || 309 || 300 || 302 || rowspan=2|1212 || rowspan=2|+60 |-style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" | align=left|Texas Tech || 319 || 294 || 307 || 292 |-style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" | 8 || align=left|Washington || 301 || 316 || 297 || 300 || 1214 || +62 |- | 9 || align=left|Arkansas || 310 || 306 || 303 || 298 || 1217 || +65 |- | 10 || align=left|Northwestern || 310 || 301 || 305 || 302 || 1218 || +66 |- | 11 || align=left|UC Davis || 305 || 304 || 306 || 305 || 1220 || +68 |- | 12 || align=left|Purdue || 307 || 302 || 302 || 311 || 1222 || +70 |- | 13 || align=left|Wake Forest || 310 || 320 || 297 || 297 || 1224 || +72 |- | 14 || align=left|Alabama || 310 || 307 || 310 || 299 || 1226 || +74 |- | 15 || align=left|UCLA || 319 || 318 || 293 || 303 || 1233 || +81 |} Remaining teams: UNLV (931), South Carolina (932), Texas A&M; (933), Tulane (935), LSU (938), Virginia (938), NC State (942), Campbell (950), California (953).
