    "text": "Michael Francis Flynn (born 1947) is an American science fiction author. Nearly all of Flynn's work falls under the category of hard science fiction, although his treatment of it can be unusual since he has applied the rigor of hard science fiction to \"softer\" sciences such as sociology in works such as In the Country of the Blind. Much of his short fiction has appeared in Analog Science Fiction and Fact. ==Biography== Flynn was born in Easton, Pennsylvania. He earned a B.A. in Mathematics from La Salle University and an M.S. in topology from Marquette University. He has been employed as an industrial quality engineer and statistician. ==Bibliography== ==Awards== Flynn has been nominated for Hugo Awards seven times: * 1987 novella \"Eifelheim\" * 1988 novella \"The Forest of Time\" * 1995 novella \"Melodies of the Heart\" * 2005 novelette \"The Clapping Hands of God\" * 2007 novelette \"Dawn, and Sunset, and the Colours of the Earth\" * 2007 novel Eifelheim (Based on the 1987 novella) * 2015 novelette \"The Journeyman: In the Stone House\" Flynn has twice won the Prometheus Award, first for his novel In the Country of the Blind, and then for the novel Fallen Angels, co-written with Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, which also won the Seiun Award.
