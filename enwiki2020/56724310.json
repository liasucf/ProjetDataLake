There may have been an original ell to the rear; a new ell replaced that around 1900, and an enclosed porch was added c.1920. It was deemed \" significant for its association as an early stage coach stop and post office in ante-bellum Hopkins County. It is the only building from this period associated with early inns along historic road routes in the county. The house is also the only remaining ante-bellum brick building in the rural area of the county.\" With . ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky Category:Houses completed in 1830 Category:Hopkins County, Kentucky Category:Hotels in Kentucky ",
