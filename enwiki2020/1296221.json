The area has been populated since at least the Bronze Age. Beginning in the 3rd century, the Alemanni and, later, the Franks established several villages, including the small settlement Salemanneswilare (later Salmannsweiler). Salem Abbey, founded by the Order of Cistercians, was established here in 1134. It quickly achieved the rank of an imperial abbey. From about 1285 to 1425, the High Gothic Salem M\u00fcnster (Minster) was built, and has been preserved until the current day. In the 17th century, the monastery had to cope with serious setbacks. The Thirty Years' War brought death and destruction to many areas. And, in 1697, a fire destroyed not only most of the buildings, but also numerous art treasures owned by the abbey. Subsequently, under the master builder Franz Beer of Vorarlberg, the Baroque buildings currently standing on the site were built. Among other things, Abbot Anselm II Schwab founded an Orphans' Fund in 1749 that is considered the first savings bank in Germany. Anselm also had the pilgrimage church Birnau built on the shores of Lake Constance. The heyday of the monastery ended with the German mediatization in 1803. It was secularized, and the territory fell to the Margraviate of Baden. == Culture and sights == Abbey Salem The Cistercian monastery of Salem Abbey was founded in 1134 when the knight Guntram von Adelsreute donated land for its establishment. The abbey already had its own scriptorium in the 12th century and formed one of the most important monastery libraries in Europe. Salem Boarding house Currently the grounds are home to the middle school campus of the boarding school Schule Schloss Salem, founded in 1920 by Kurt Hahn and Prince Max of Baden. The abbey complex covers a total of 17 hectares. Other sights are the Gothic style Salem Minster (the former church of the abbey complex) and the Baroque chapel. == Sports == In summer the Schlosssee (castle lake) attracts swimmers from all over the region.
