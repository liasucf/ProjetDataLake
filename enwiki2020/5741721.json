    "text": "\"Don't Ever Cry\" was the Croatian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1993, performed partly in English and partly in Croatian by Put. This was Croatia's debut as an independent nation in the Eurovision Song Contest. The song written by \u0110or\u0111e Novkovi\u0107 was performed twenty-first on the night (following the Netherlands's Ruth Jacott with \"Vrede\" and preceding Spain's Eva Santamar\u00eda with \"Hombres\"). At the close of voting, it had received 31 points, placing 15th in a field of 25. The song is a plea for peace, set against the backdrop of the war of aggression which had recently engulfed Croatia. The song ends with the dramatic line \"Don't ever cry, my Croatian sky\". It was succeeded as Croatian representative at the 1994 Contest by Tony Cetinski with \"Nek' ti bude ljubav sva\".
