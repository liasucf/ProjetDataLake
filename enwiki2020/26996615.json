Released in 1988, it is Russell's most successful album to date and includes her hit single \"Piano in the Dark\" as well as the minor hit title track, \"Get Here,\" which became an international success for Oleta Adams three years later. ==Album history== After the release of her third album, Two Eyes (1983), Russell moved to Stockholm, Sweden and began writing songs for her fourth album in 1984.Interview (24 April 2007). SongFacts.com. Retrieved 18 April 2010. Working with several producers and recorded at ten different studios in Stockholm and Los Angeles, the album was ultimately released in 1988 and saw Russell return to the A&M; Records label that had released her first two solo albums in 1979 and 1981 (her 1983 album had been released via Warner Bros.). The album peaked at #49 on the US Billboard 200 and #20 on the Billboard R&B; chart. The first single from the album was the ballad \"Piano in the Dark\", released in February 1988. The single, which featured vocals by Joe \"Bean\" Esposito, became (and remains) Russell's biggest hit, peaking at #6 on the US Billboard 100 and was also a Top 30 hit in the UK (#23), as well as earning Grammy nominations for \"Song of the Year\" and \"Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals\" (Russell would also garner a nomination for \"Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female\" for Get Here).[ Billboard - Brenda Russell bio.] (Retrieved 18 April 2010) Other singles from the album include \"Le Restaurant\" (featuring David Sanborn on saxophone) and the dance track \"Gravity\".
