Markos Drakos () was a Cypriot guerrilla fighter who was killed in the EOKA struggle (1955\u20131959) against the British. His nom de guerre was Lykourgos.He was born in Nicosia District, on 24 September 1932 and studied accounting. He worked for the Hellenic Mining Company in Cyprus until 1954. When EOKA was formed, Drakos was among the first to join, training others in the use of arms and recruiting members. Drakos was mild-mannered and enthusiastic to learn about military operations, as well as being devoutly religious, and EOKA commander Georgios Grivas \"Dighenis\" quickly took a liking to him. He saw great potential in Drakos as a leader, and he was quickly promoted to a senior position in EOKA. On 1 April 1955, considered to be the first day of the struggle, Drakos and his \"Astrape\" (\"Lightning\") team blew up the radio station at Athalassa, destroying it completely. With his squad, he would go on to co-ordinate several other operations. On 30 June 1955 Drakos was arrested by the British with 14 other EOKA members and imprisoned in Kyrenia Castle but managed to escape 3 months later, by tying blankets together and abseiling out of the windows. A bounty of \u00a35,000 was placed on his head by the authorities. On the night of 18 January 1957 the British forces attacked Drakos and his men at their hideout in the Solea Valley. Drakos was killed and His body recovered and interred by the British in the Imprisoned Graves in the Central Jail of Nicosia.
