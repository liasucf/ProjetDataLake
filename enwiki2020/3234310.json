Q wrote, \"Blige can turn from sassy to agonized to vulnerable in the space of a single phrase [...] The Queen Of Hip Hop Soul remains classy and invincible\". Craig Seymour of Spin praised its classicist influences and called Mary \"emotionally gripping and stylistically diverse\", writing that \"[Blige's] assured blues moans, gospel shouts, and jazzy inflections graph the history of African-American music\". Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot noted \"a more organic feel\" in its production, which he viewed as less \"uninspired\" than on Blige's previous albums. Entertainment Weeklys Anthony DeCurtis complimented Blige's vocal embellishments and the album's \"lush and spare\" arrangements, stating \"Musically, Mary is essentially a long, soulful, ballad-tempo vamp over which Blige alternately \u2014 and sometimes simultaneously \u2014 tells tales of faithless love, preaches the gospel of female strength, and determinedly clings to hope\". The Source complimented Blige's \"pure emotion\" and stated \"she dares to break the hip-hop soul template she helped create, and do something different. Something our loop-weary souls need\". Steve Jones of USA Today commended Blige for \"making you feel rather than merely hear what she's singing about\", adding that she \"continues to separate herself from her peers, conveying a wide range of emotions without becoming whiny, petty or overwrought\". Despite viewing its strength as \"more in how Blige sings the songs than the songs themselves\", Los Angeles Times writer Soren Baker commented that \"the lively, supple instrumentation only adds to the force of her already dominating delivery\" and noted \"a more soul-stirring, straightforward R&B; attitude than the hip- hop/R&B; hybrid of her earlier collections\". Rolling Stone writer Tour\u00e9 said \"Blige seems to have moved away from the Terry McMillan once-again- he's-breaking-my-heart mantra to, perhaps, an Oprah love-your-spirit ethos\". Christopher John Farley of Time wrote that \"Mary is somewhat inconsistent in song quality, but Blige's soul-singed vocals save the weaker material\". Ann Powers of The New York Times viewed that the album exemplifies a \"new conscience\" of feminine themes in contemporary R&B; at the time, adding that \"if Mary gestures toward an older, non-hip-hop audience, it also makes the claim for Ms. Blige's canonization within the rhythm-and-blues hall of fame\". In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau wrote, \"Rather than hating playas, she's bored with them [...] all that she can say is that she's ready to love someone serious and walk away from anyone who isn't\". In a retrospective review for The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Tom Moon deemed Mary an improvement over Blige's previous album, commenting that it \"more fully realizes Blige's vision for Share My World\". AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised its \"sheer classiness\", writing that \"There's still grit in the music, but it's been glossed over with a polished production\". Erlewine described it as \"a rewarding, engaging way to mature\" and wrote that \"Blige's voice is richer and her skills have deepened, and her new songs, while not as streetwise, are worthy of her talents\". === Accolades === Spin ranked the album number 15 in its year-end list of best albums. Blige won and was nominated for many awards for this album. *She was nominated for 2 MTV Europe Music Awards for Best Video and Best Song (\"As\" with George Michael). *In 2000 Blige was nominated for a Brit Award for Best International Female Solo Artist. *3 Grammy Awards nominations for Best R&B; Vocal Performance - Female (\"All That I Can Say\"), Best R&B; Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group (\"Don't Waste Your Time\" with Aretha Franklin), and Best R&B; Album (Mary). *In 2001 Blige was nominated for a Soul Train Music Award for Best Female R&B;/Soul Single for \"Your Child\". *Blige won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B;/Soul Album, Female (Mary) and was also nominated for Best R&B;/Soul or Rap Album. *Blige also won 2 Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Solo R&B;/Soul Album of the Year for Mary and R&B;/Soul or Rap Song of the Year for \"All That I Can Say\".
