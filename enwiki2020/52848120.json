    "text": "In physics and mathematics, the Clebsch representation of an arbitrary three- dimensional vector field \\boldsymbol{v}(\\boldsymbol{x}) is: :\\boldsymbol{v} = \\boldsymbol{ abla} \\varphi + \\psi\\, \\boldsymbol{ abla} \\chi, where the scalar fields \\varphi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\psi(\\boldsymbol{x}) and \\chi(\\boldsymbol{x}) are known as Clebsch potentials or Monge potentials, named after Alfred Clebsch (1833\u20131872) and Gaspard Monge (1746\u20131818), and \\boldsymbol{ abla} is the gradient operator. ==Background== In fluid dynamics and plasma physics, the Clebsch representation provides a means to overcome the difficulties to describe an inviscid flow with non-zero vorticity \u2013 in the Eulerian reference frame \u2013 using Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics. At the critical point of such functionals the result is the Euler equations, a set of equations describing the fluid flow. Note that the mentioned difficulties do not arise when describing the flow through a variational principle in the Lagrangian reference frame. In case of surface gravity waves, the Clebsch representation leads to a rotational-flow form of Luke's variational principle. For the Clebsch representation to be possible, the vector field \\boldsymbol{v} has (locally) to be bounded, continuous and sufficiently smooth. For global applicability \\boldsymbol{v} has to decay fast enough towards infinity. The Clebsch decomposition is not unique, and (two) additional constraints are necessary to uniquely define the Clebsch potentials. Since \\psi\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\chi is in general not solenoidal, the Clebsch representation does not in general satisfy the Helmholtz decomposition. ==Vorticity== The vorticity \\boldsymbol{\\omega}(\\boldsymbol{x}) is equal to : \\boldsymbol{\\omega} = \\boldsymbol{ abla}\\times\\boldsymbol{v} = \\boldsymbol{ abla}\\times\\left( \\boldsymbol{ abla} \\varphi + \\psi\\, \\boldsymbol{ abla} \\chi\\right) = \\boldsymbol{ abla}\\psi \\times \\boldsymbol{ abla}\\chi, with the last step due to the vector calculus identity \\boldsymbol{ abla} \\times (\\psi \\boldsymbol{A})=\\psi(\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\times\\boldsymbol{A})+\\boldsymbol{ abla}\\psi\\times\\boldsymbol{A}. So the vorticity \\boldsymbol{\\omega} is perpendicular to both \\boldsymbol{ abla}\\psi and \\boldsymbol{ abla}\\chi, while further the vorticity does not depend on \\varphi. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Vector calculus Category:Fluid dynamics Category:Plasma physics ",
