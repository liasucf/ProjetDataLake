Late shri Satyadev Katare . ==Legal affairs== Bhopal police booked the former Congress MLA for allegedly abducting, raping a journalism student. After a series of rape allegations against him, the MLA claimed that the complainant was blackmailing him. A classic example of how political power garnered nepotism is misused. He is the son of former leader of opposition Satyadev Katare. Katare who stands accused of targeting and assaulting a Dalit was absconding for a while. He surrendered before the court in April and was granted bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 100,000. ==References== Category:Bhind district Category:1985 births Category:Living people ",
