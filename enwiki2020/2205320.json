Sierre is nicknamed City of the Sun () for its average of 300 days of sunshine a year. It is the last official French speaking city in Valais before the French\u2013German language border of the canton located at the for\u00eat de Finges, few kilometres after the town. A German-speaking minority lives in Sierre, as it counts around 8% of the population.Revue de g\u00e9ographie alpine accessed 10-December-2016 ==History== Panoramic view of Sierre. Sierre is first mentioned about 800 as Sidrium, though a 12th-century document refers to the village being founded in 515. In 1179 it was mentioned as Sirro and in 1393 as Syder. ===Prehistory=== The area around the modern town, especially Gerunden hill, was settled very early. Archeological sites on Gerunden hill have produced neolithic objects and grave goods (including a polished stone ax), Bronze Age weapons and jewelry, Early Iron Age objects and Roman era inscriptions, jars, jewelry and coins. A soapstone pot from the Early Middle Ages and a gold signet ring with the name Graifarius from the 6th century have also been found. Other sites on nearby hills and near the chapel of Saint-Ginier, the Ch\u00e2teau de Villa, the churches of Sainte-Croix, Grands-Pr\u00e9s, Muraz, Glarey and Bernunes have yielded up graves originating from the Bronze Age to the Carolingian era. In Grands-Pr\u00e9s there is a fire pit from the beginning of the Late Iron Age (5th\u20136th century BC). During the Roman era it appears that there was no major population center, but rather several scattered groupings of separate, upper class dwellings. Under the chapel of Saint-Ginier, the remains of a Roman era house or estate have been discovered. Other Roman ruins have been found near the Ch\u00e2teau de Villa, in the church of Sainte-Croix (small terraced bath), in Grands-Pr\u00e9s by Muraz another house and in Gerunden the remains of buttress reinforced masonry indicate that a public or government building once stood there. Five altars were found in Saint-Ginier, along with another two in the scattered settlements, one of which was dedicated to Mercury. During the early imperial period, the duumvir or mayor of the Civitas Vallensium, Caius Cominus Chiu, lived in Sierre. In the late imperial period, the family of the senator of Vinelia Modestina also lived in the area. The chapel of Saint-F\u00e9lix was built in the 5th or the beginning of the 6th century on Gerunden hill. ===Medieval and early modern developments=== In 515 the estate at Sierre was given by the King of Burgundy Sigismund to the Abbey of Saint-Maurice to hold as a fief. By the 11th century, the fief of Sierre was owned by the Bishop of Sion. The aristocratic families and the residents of the fief lived on the Gerunden, Vieux-Sierre and Plantzette hills. On each of these hills there was a castle that served as the residence for the Bishop's representatives and as a refuge for the population. The castles were razed in the mid-14th century when the noble families stood with the Bishop in his war with the Zenden of the Upper Valais and Counts of Savoy. The demolished castles and villages were abandoned and most residents settled farther north, in plan-Sierre. The only castle that survived the wars of the 14th century was Goubing Castle, southeast of Sierre, which belonged to the lords of Granges. The Contr\u00e9e of Sierre was originally a group the managed the commons. As vassals of the Bishop, they had the right to assemble twice a year to regulate the management of the common lands and the affairs of the local police. In the 14th and 15th century this cooperative adopted a larger political role as they started to administer more of the daily affairs in the villages and acquired the right to appoint their own judges. Eventually this grew into the Noble Contr\u00e9e which then formed the core of Sierre Zenden from which the city of Sierre later developed. The town of Plan-Sierre soon took over the leadership role in the Noble Contr\u00e9e. Until 1798, the Noble Contr\u00e9e was appointed by a council of village representatives, under the leadership of the Bishop's representative. In 1559, Plan-Sierre divided into four quarters Villa, Monder\u00e8che, La Salla and Glarey. In 1620, the town hall was built. ===19th century=== Aerial view (1949) As the capital of a Zenden, Sierre fought the French in the 1798\u201399 invasion. In 1799, the city was occupied by French and Vaudois troops. The French set up their headquarters in Sierre. In the conflicts between the conservative Upper Valais and the liberal Lower Valais, Sierre served as the seat of government in 1839\u201340. After 1848, the villages of the Noble Contr\u00e9e became municipalities under the Valais cantonal constitution. The Zenden of Sierre became the District of Sierre with Sierre as the capital. The new city executive council had nine members, while of the General Council (legislature) had 60. Initially, the majority of the power was held by the Conservatives (now the Christian Democrats). In 1913, they were joined by the Liberals, in 1945 the Social Democrats and in 2004 the Greens. ===Modern Sierre=== At the beginning of the 20th century, Sierre became economically important as very early aluminium smelting is enabled by its access to hydroelectricity. Today the aluminium industry Novelis and Alcan employs 1,200 workers in Chippis and Sierre. In 2007, the agglomeration of Sierre/Crans-Montana was formed to address created to common problems, especially in the fields of tourism and transportation. ==Geography== Lac de G\u00e9ronde and Sierre Sierre has an area, , of .
