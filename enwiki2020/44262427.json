    "text": "The Gemmill-Faust House is a historic house at 321 St. Andrew's Terrace in West Helena, Arkansas. It is a two-story wood-frame structure with a brick- face exterior, built c. 1920. The house is an excellent local example of the Prairie School of design, with its broad spreading eaves, hip roof with hipped dormer, light-colored brick, and ribbon windows throughout. A period garage stands west of (behind) the main house. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Phillips County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Prairie School architecture in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1920 Category:Houses in Phillips County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Phillips County, Arkansas ",
