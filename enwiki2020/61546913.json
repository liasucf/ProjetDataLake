    "text": "Sebastian Endr\u00f6dy-Younga (26 June 1934 \u2013 26 February 1999) was a Hungarian- born entomologist who specialized in the beetles particularly of the African region, working for many years in the Transvaal Museum. Endr\u00f6dy-Younga was the son of the Hungarian entomologist Seb\u00f6 Endr\u00f6di. His family name was changed, with a spelling change and the addition of the mother's family name, so that the father and son could be distinguished in the authorship of zoological names. After receiving a Ph.D. from the Roland E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University in 1959 he worked with Zolt\u00e1n Kaszab at the Term\u00e9szettudom\u00e2nyi M\u00fbzeum in Budapest. He collected in Africa as part of a UNESCO expedition and later spent eight years in Ghana working for the UN FAO. He moved to South Africa in 1973 working with Dr. Charles Koch at the Transvaal Museum. He built up a collection of the African beetles. == References == Category:Hungarian entomologists Category:1934 births Category:1999 deaths Category:20th-century zoologists ",
