    "text": "This article discusses some common molecular file formats, including usage and converting between them. ==Distinguishing formats== Chemical information is usually provided as files or streams and many formats have been created, with varying degrees of documentation. The format is indicated in three ways (see chemical MIME section) * file extension (usually 3 letters). This is widely used, but fragile as common suffixes such as \".mol\" and \".dat\" are used by many systems, including non-chemical ones. * self-describing files where the format information is included in the file. Examples are CIF and CML. * chemical/MIME type added by a chemically-aware server. == Chemical Markup Language == Chemical Markup Language (CML) is an open standard for representing molecular and other chemical data. The open source project includes XML Schema, source code for parsing and working with CML data, and an active community. The articles Tools for Working with Chemical Markup Language and XML for Chemistry and Biosciences discusses CML in more detail. CML data files are accepted by many tools, including JChemPaint, Jmol, XDrawChem and MarvinView. == Protein Data Bank Format == The Protein Data Bank Format is commonly used for proteins but it can be used for other types of molecules as well. It was originally designed as, and continues to be, a fixed-column-width format and thus officially has a built-in maximum number of atoms, of residues, and of chains; this resulted in splitting very large structures such as ribosomes into multiple files. However, many tools can read files that exceed those limits. For example, the E. coli 70S ribosome was represented as 4 PDB files in 2009: 3I1M, 3I1N, 3I1O and 3I1P. In 2014 they were consolidated into a single file, 4V6C. Some PDB files contain an optional section describing atom connectivity as well as position. Because these files are sometimes used to describe macromolecular assemblies or molecules represented in explicit solvent, they can grow very large and are often compressed. Some tools, such as Jmol and KiNG, can read PDB files in gzipped format. The wwPDB maintains the specifications of the PDB file format and its XML alternative, PDBML. There was a fairly major change in PDB format specification (to version 3.0) in August 2007, and a remediation of many file problems in the existing database. The typical file extension for a PDB file is .pdb, although some older files use .ent or .brk. Some molecular modeling tools write nonstandard PDB-style files that adapt the basic format to their own needs. == GROMACS format == The GROMACS file format family was created for use with the molecular simulation software package GROMACS. It closely resembles the PDB format but was designed for storing output from molecular dynamics simulations, so it allows for additional numerical precision and optionally retains information about particle velocity as well as position at a given point in the simulation trajectory. It does not allow for the storage of connectivity information, which in GROMACS is obtained from separate molecule and system topology files. The typical file extension for a GROMACS file is .gro. == CHARMM format == The CHARMM molecular dynamics package can read and write a number of standard chemical and biochemical file formats; however, the CARD (coordinate) and PSF (protein structure file) are largely unique to CHARMM. The CARD format is fixed-column-width, resembles the PDB format, and is used exclusively for storing atomic coordinates. The PSF file contains atomic connectivity information (which describes atomic bonds) and is required before beginning a simulation. The typical file extensions used are .crd and .psf respectively. == GSD format == The General Simulation Data (GSD) file format created for efficient reading / writing of generic particle simulations, primarily - but not restricted to - those from HOOMD-blue. The package also contains a python module that reads and writes hoomd schema gsd files with an easy to use syntax. == Ghemical file format == The Ghemical software can use OpenBabel to import and export a number of file formats. However, by default, it uses the GPR format. This file is composed of several parts, separated by a tag (!Header, !Info, !Atoms, !Bonds, !Coord, !PartialCharges and !End). The proposed MIME type for this format is application/x-ghemical. == SYBYL Line Notation == SYBYL Line Notation (SLN) is a chemical line notation. Based on SMILES, it incorporates a complete syntax for specifying relative stereochemistry. SLN has a rich query syntax that allows for the specification of Markush structure queries. The syntax also supports the specification of combinatorial libraries of ChemDraw. Example SLNs {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Description ! SLN String |- | Benzene | C[1]H:CH:CH:CH:CH:CH:@1 |- | Alanine | NH2C[s=n]H(CH3)C(=O)OH |- | Query showing R sidechain | R1[hac>1]C[1]:C:C:C:C:C:@1 |- | Query for amide/sulfamide | NHC=M1{M1:O,S} |} == SMILES == The Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification (SMILES) is a line notation for molecules. SMILES strings include connectivity but do not include 2D or 3D coordinates. Hydrogen atoms are not represented. Other atoms are represented by their element symbols B, C, N, O, F, P, S, Cl, Br, and I. The symbol \"=\" represents double bonds and \"#\" represents triple bonds. Branching is indicated by (). Rings are indicated by pairs of digits. Some examples are {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name ! Formula ! SMILES String |- | Methane | CH4 | C |- | Ethanol | C2H6O | CCO |- | Benzene | C6H6 | C1=CC=CC=C1 or c1ccccc1 |- | Ethylene | C2H4 | C=C |} ==XYZ== The XYZ file format is a simple format that usually gives the number of atoms in the first line, a comment on the second, followed by a number of lines with atomic symbols (or atomic numbers) and cartesian coordinates. ==MDL number== The MDL number contains a unique identification number for each reaction and variation. The format is RXXXnnnnnnnn. R indicates a reaction, XXX indicates which database contains the reaction record. The numeric portion, nnnnnnnn, is an 8-digit number. == Other common formats == One of the most widely used industry standards are chemical table file formats, like the Structure Data Format (SDF) files. They are text files that adhere to a strict format for representing multiple chemical structure records and associated data fields. The format was originally developed and published by Molecular Design Limited (MDL). MOL is another file format from MDL. It is documented in Chapter 4 of CTfile Formats. PubChem also has XML and ASN1 file formats, which are export options from the PubChem online database. They are both text based (ASN1 is most often a binary format). There are a large number of other formats listed in the table below == Converting between formats == OpenBabel and JOELib are freely available open source tools specifically designed for converting between file formats. Their chemical expert systems support a large atom type conversion tables. :`babel -i input_format input_file -o output_format output_file` For example, to convert the file epinephrine.sdf in SDF to CML use the command :`babel -i sdf epinephrine.sdf -o cml epinephrine.cml` The resulting file is epinephrine.cml. A number of tools intended for viewing and editing molecular structures are able to read in files in a number of formats and write them out in other formats. The tools JChemPaint (based on the Chemistry Development Kit), XDrawChem (based on OpenBabel), Chime, Jmol, Mol2molMol2mol homepage and Discovery Studio fit into this category. == The Chemical MIME Project == \"Chemical MIME\" is a de facto approach for adding MIME types to chemical streams. > This project started in January 1994, and was first announced during the > Chemistry workshop at the First WWW International Conference, held at CERN > in May 1994. ... The first version of an Internet draft was published during > May\u2013October 1994, and the second revised version during April\u2013September > 1995. A paper presented to the CPEP (Committee on Printed and Electronic > Publications) at the IUPAC meeting in August 1996 is available for > discussion.The Chemical MIME Home Page (accessed 2013-January-24) In 1998 the work was formally published in the JCIM. {| class=\"wikitable\" !
