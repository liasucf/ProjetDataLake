    "text": "Fero () (English: The Trip) is a Gujarati novel written by Radheshyam Sharma. It was published in 1968 by Rekha Prakashan in Ahmedabad. It is acclaimed in Gujarati literature for its experimental nature and is considered a literary milestone among modern Gujarati authors. It was followed by Sharma's similarly exploratory novel, Swapnatirtha. The name of this novel is referenced in the title of Suman Shah's critical work Chandrakant Bakshi Thi Fero (1973). ==Plot== A couple, who have a mute, only-child, take a long journey to the Sun temple with the hope that the gift of speech is granted to their child. The trip is an attempt to appease their God. The mother is hopeful at the start of the journey, but the child is lost as the train pulls out of the final station before the destination. In an attempt to stop the train, the father raises his hand to pull the chain but hesitates before doing so. The story is written from the father's perspective, and the reader is only privy to his observations and reactions. The novel is narrated in the first person, beginning with the family's departure and ending before the journey's completion. ==Theme== The novel is centred on the theme of human consciousness. It delves into the complexity of thought and awareness as the family struggles to complete their journey. ==Criticism== Chandrakant Sheth, a Gujarati critic, considers the prose of the novel too aristocratic in nature. ==References== Category:1968 novels Category:Gujarati-language novels Category:Fiction set in the 20th century Category:Existentialist novels Category:Modernist novels Category:1968 Indian novels Category:1968 debut novels Category:Novels set on trains ",
