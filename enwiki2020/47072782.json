It traces its origins to the founding of the parish in 1850, when classes began in the church basement. The Sisters of Mercy took responsibility for the school in 1878 and a dedicated building was opened at 218 Nassau Street in 1880. The current structure dates to 1930 and the school is home to around 400 students and 30 faculty. ==Gallery== File:St. Paul's School (Princeton, New Jersey) (1910).JPG|Students and staff of the school in 1910 ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Schools in Princeton, New Jersey Category:Private elementary schools in New Jersey Category:Private middle schools in New Jersey Category:Private schools in Mercer County, New Jersey Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Trenton Category:Catholic elementary schools in New Jersey ",
