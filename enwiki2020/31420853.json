Admiral Steidle also served as Program Manager of the Joint Strike Fighter Program. He is currently serving as a Distinguished Visiting Professor in Aerospace Engineering at the U.S. Naval Academy. During his tenure with the United States Navy, Admiral Steidle became most well known for his prominent role as Program Manager of the Joint Strike Fighter where he managed the \"fly off\" between the X-32 and the X-35 to determine what design would ultimately become the F-35 Lightning II. Admiral Steidle also commanded the Navy\u2019s F/A-18 program, the naval aviation\u2019s largest production research and development program, as well as the largest foreign military sales program. ==Navy career== Admiral Steidle joined the Navy after he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in 1968. In the Navy, he trained to become an attack pilot and flew carrier night combat missions in North Vietnam.

Steidle accepted a position as associate administrator of the Office of Exploration Systems at NASA. The purpose of the Office of Exploration Systems was to design, develop, and produce the new architecture and vehicles to send the United States beyond Earth orbit for the first time since the Apollo moon missions of the 1960s. The Centennial Challenges prize program was also implemented by the Office of Exploration Systems during this time. The office was renamed the Exploration Systems Directorate in an August 2004 restructuring. Admiral Steidle officially resigned from the position of associate administrator for exploration systems in June 2005.

He also attended Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University where he earned a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering. Admiral Steidle was a Distinguished Graduate from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in June 1976. ==Personal== Admiral Steidle resides with his wife of 50 years, Marcia, in Southern Maine. His daughter, Gretchen Steidle Wallace is the President and Founder of Global Grassroots (www.globalgrassroots.org), a nonprofit which assists marginalized women in Rwanda and Uganda and helps them start social entrepreneurships to better their communities.
