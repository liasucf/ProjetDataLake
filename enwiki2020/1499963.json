    "text": "Akropolis () was a Greek newspaper based in Athens. Between 1883 and 1921, it played a major part in the debate concerning the Greek language question, particularly in the events leading up to the Gospel Riots of 1901 in Athens. == History == Akropolis was essentially the creation of one man, Vlasis Gavriilidis, who founded it in 1883 and played a great part in running it until his death in 1920. Eight months later the newspaper ceased publication, although it was relaunched in 1929 and has been published intermittently since then. == References == Category:Greek-language newspapers Category:Defunct newspapers published in Greece Category:Newspapers published in Athens Category:Publications established in 1883 Category:1883 establishments in Greece Category:Daily newspapers published in Greece ",
