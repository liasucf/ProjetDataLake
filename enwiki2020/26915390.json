It is considered a traditional settlement. It is noted for its production of chestnuts, from which it takes its name, and for formerly being a majority Tsakonian-speaking settlement. ==History== Kastanitsa is first mentioned in writing in 1293, but the settlement is thought to be nearly two centuries older, founded by Tsakones fleeing the rule of Slavic tribes that had invaded the Peloponnese. According to Kastaniot tradition, the village was founded by two families called Pentalonas and Bezenikos.\u039b\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, \u03a3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2.
