The financed, cast and made the picture themselves. Reportedly Wisbar raised some finance from his family back in Germany. It was shot at a new studios, the Motion Picture Center, over 12 days at an estimated $10,000 a day. \"This is an interesting, a desperate, attempt to break the deadlock on independent production\", said Wisbar. \"The other boys and I made up our minds to finance, cast and film a picture as well as it could be done, without interference from the \"front office\", distributors, or anyone else. We did this knowing a low budget can be \u2013 and usually is \u2013 the ruin of a good picture. I know. I've made them; bad ones.\" Wisbar said they picked Cooper's novel because it was in the public domain and also \"because it keeps the rootin', tootin', and shootin' to a minimum and stresses the human element, the story of a man who was a law unto himself. We wrote our script straight, cutting out every scene that was not absolutely necessary.\" Wisbar said the film was made in a style that was \"realistic but stylised. Camera treatment is modern in what I would call highly poetic.\" The film marked the acting debut for Robert Mitchum's brother John. ==Reception== The Los Angeles Times said \"I wish I could say the film makes some claim on artistry.\" Associated Producers Inc announced a new version of the book would be filmed on 2 March 1959 but it appears to have not been made. ==References== ==External links== * * *The Prairie at Letterbox DVD Category:1947 films Category:Films based on American novels Category:American films Category:American action adventure films Category:English-language films Category:1947 Western (genre) films Category:Lippert Pictures films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:American black-and-white films ",
