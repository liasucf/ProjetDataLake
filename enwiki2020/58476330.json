Aggregator Album of the Year gave the release a 75 out of 100 based on a critical consensus of 6 reviews. James Christopher Monger from AllMusic explained: \"Magic Ship delivers a listening experience that's akin to eavesdropping. So unadorned are these largely a cappella songs, both on the production and execution side of the sonic equation, that it feels a bit like somebody stuck a microphone through a cracked door and caught Sarle, Sauser-Monnig, and Meath unaware.\" ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+Accolades for Magic Ship |- ! scope=\"col\"| Publication ! scope=\"col\"| Accolade ! scope=\"col\"| Rank |- ! scope=\"row\"| Drift Records | Drift Records Top 100 Albums of 2018 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| PopMatters | PopMatters Top 20 Folk Albums of 2018 | |} ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+Chart performance for Magic Ship |- !
