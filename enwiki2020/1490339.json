    "text": "L'Interdit () was a perfume created in 1957 by Hubert de Givenchy. The word interdit is French for \"forbidden.\" The nose/parfumeur behind this feminine aldehydic-floral fragrance was Francis Fabron (1913 - 2005). It has a delicate, floral, powdery aroma. It contains notes of rose, jasmine, violet and, at the heart, a blend of woods and grasses. Givenchy created the perfume for Audrey Hepburn, who wore it for a year before its release to the public. Hepburn also became the first actress to become the face of a perfume, for L'Interdit. ==References== ==External links== * L'Interdit at Basenotes.net * L'Interdit at Fragrantica.com Category:Perfumes Category:Products introduced in 1957 ",
