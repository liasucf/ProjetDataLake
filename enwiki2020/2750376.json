Rather than a serious bid for the presidency, his candidacy was speculated to instead be an attempt to garner publicity in order to help him fend-off the challenge he was facing in gubernatorial election bid later that year. On February 13 Titov traveled to the Urals for his first campaign trip. Titov failed to win the endorsement of the Union of Right Wing Forces. At a 14 March meeting of the bloc's coordinating council the question of the presidential elections was addressed. At the urging of Anatoly Chubais the bloc voted on whether to support Putin's candidacy.\u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442. \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0438\u043b Out of the seven members of the coordinating council, four had voted in favor of supporting Putin (Chubais, Gaidar, Kiriyenko, Nekrutenko). Himself one of the seven members of the coordinating council, Titov was joined by Boris Nemtsov in voting in opposition. Irina Khakamada abstained from the vote. Titov's largely ran different edits of a single advertisement throughout his campaign. This advertisement touted his gubernatorial experience. Titov urged voters to, \"Vote not with your heart, but with your mind\". Titov's campaign touted endorsements from State Duma deputies Sergei Yushenkov, Nikolay Brusnikin, and Hasan Mirzoev. Other Russian politician's whose endorsements they touted included Marina Salier. The campaign also touted celebrity endorsements from Rimma Kazakova, Nikolay Bederin, and Vyacheslav Dobrynin. Titov ultimately performed well in Samara, where he placed third with 20% of the vote, but failed to perform well elsewhere ==References== Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Moscow Category:Communist Party of the Soviet Union members Category:Democratic Choice of Russia politicians Category:Our Home \u2013 Russia politicians Category:20th-century Russian politicians Category:Union of Right Forces politicians Category:United Russia politicians Category:21st-century Russian politicians Category:Members of the Federation Council (Russia) Category:Governors of Samara Oblast Titov Category:Recipients of the Order of Friendship ",
