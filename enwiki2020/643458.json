    "text": "The North Dakota House of Representatives is the lower house of the North Dakota Legislative Assembly and is larger than the North Dakota Senate. North Dakota is divided into between 40 and 54 legislative districts apportioned by population as determined by the decennial census. The 2000 redistricting plan provided for 47 districts. As each district elects 2 Representatives to the House, there are currently 94 Representatives in the House. Representatives serve 4-year terms. Elections are staggered such that half the districts have elections every 2 years. Originally, the North Dakota Constitution limited members of the North Dakota House of Representatives to two-year terms, with all representatives standing for reelection at the same time. That practice continued until 1996, when the voters approved a constitutional amendment that changed the term for representatives to four-years with staggered terms. The amendment went into effect July 1, 1997, and was first applied in the 1998 elections.House Concurrent Resolution No. 3010 (North Dakota Session Laws 1995, ch. 649) approved November 5, 1996 (ND Session Laws 1997, ch. 570) Every two years half the districts elect both their representatives by block voting. The House Chamber is located in the North Dakota State Capitol in Bismarck, North Dakota. ==Composition of the House== North Dakota House Districts as of 2003. House district boundaries are identical to the North Dakota Senate's districts, with two representatives elected from each district. The North Dakota State House by district (as of 2016). Red is 2 Republicans, blue is 2 Democrats/NPL, and purple is one of each :66th Legislative Assembly (2019\u20132020) {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |- style=\"vertical- align:bottom;\" !rowspan=3|Affiliation !colspan=2|Party (Shading indicates majority caucus) !rowspan=3|Total ! |-style=\"height:5px\" | style=\"background-color:\" | | style=\"background-color:\" | |style=\"background: black\"| |- !Republican !Democratic-NPL !Vacant |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font- size:80%\" | 65th Legislative Assembly | | 81 | 13 ! 94 | 0 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"white-space:nowrap; font-size:80%\" | 66th Legislative Assembly | | 79 | 15 ! 94 | 0 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Latest voting share ! | ! ! colspan=2 | |} ===2019\u20132020 Officers=== {| class=wikitable !
