It is a protected monument. == History == During the late-17th century and early-18th century, the population of Buda was destroyed by plague epidemics. In 1694 P\u00e9ter P\u00e1l Franczin, an Italian-born chimney sweeper, a modest citizen living in the Buda Castle District vowed that if he and his family escaped, he would travel to northern Italy (Valle Vigezzo) to the shrine of Mary, to Re, Piedmont for the Blessed Virgin Mary's image there. He returned from the pilgrimage with a copy of the grace image to Buda and erected a wooden chapel in his Buda vineyard. He placed the grace in what was then called the Blood Chapel. In a 1723 fire the chapel was burnt, but the grace image survived. The stone chapel, now rebuilt, became a place of pilgrimage; at first Jesuits, then Carmelites. In 1751 Queen Maria Theresa also visited the grace. In 1757 the Pope Benedict XIV contributed to the Feast of the Our Lady of the Snows in the Blood Chapel on 5 August. The pastoral duties were performed from 1791 to 1821 by the Franciscans from the Buda Castle Parish. Due to the construction of Krisztinav\u00e1ros, a larger church was needed, the foundation stone of which in 1795. It was laid down on September 13 and built over two years under the control of Franciscans father Groll F\u00e1bi\u00e1n and the plan of Krist\u00f3f Hikisch. Unfortunately, due to Hikisch's plans, the swirling shape of the fa\u00e7ade could not be built without money. Instead, it has a tightly planed, relaxed fa\u00e7ade. He also had a seat in the new church. (there are also two replicas of the grace image, the Church of the Queen of the Angels of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r and the Franciscan Church of Pest). The side altars (St. Anne, Painful Mother, Nepomuki, St. John and Mary Magdalene) were completed between 1811 and 1815. In 1821 the Our Lady of the Snows Parish Church became independent; its first parish priest was Jakab Majsch. During the Siege of the Buda Castle in 1849, the roof of the church was badly damaged. The errors were corrected by J\u00f3zsef Hild. On 4 February 1836 the Count Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi held his wedding with Crescence Seilern in the Our Lady of the Snows Parish Church.Kov\u00e1cs B\u00e1nk website writes: probably in the light of other sources, on February 4, 1830. and gave birth to their first child, Bela Sz\u00e9chenyi, he was baptized here on the first anniversary of their marriage on 3 February 1837.Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi: Diary.

Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s was also baptized here on 5 August 1848, then 10 days of birth, and became the \"prince of physicists\". Also, the wedding of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis and M\u00e1ria Weidenhoffer was held here, on 1 June 1857, by the \"savior of the mothers\" . Between 1877 and 1978, the young J\u00e1nos Csernoch, later cardinal, archbishop of the Kingdom of Hungary, assisted here for a year. On 22 June 1919 J\u00f3zsef Cserny attacked a 50 red soldiers at the feast of Corpus Christi of the church, and fired more shots at them; Dr. Art\u00far D\u00e9nes was killed during the attack. From 1956 Gy\u00f6rgy Czig\u00e1ny regularly performed in the church. In 1993 the parish founded the Szent Gell\u00e9rt Catholic Elementary School, which in 1997 expanded to become a 12 grade school. In the space between the church and the gymnasium there is a copy of the oldest statue of the Immaculate Conception in Budapest (the original was transported to the Metropolitan Museum in 1927). ==Gallery== File:Krisztinav\u00e1ros in 1875.jpg|Krisztinav\u00e1ros in 1875: the Buda Color Circle building in the foreground, this church in the center, Kar\u00e1tsonyi Palace to the right, behind the Budapest-D\u00e9li Railway Terminal File:10243-Budapest-1908-Cristinenst\u00e4tter Kirche-Br\u00fcck & Sohn Kunstverlag.jpg|Photo of the church in 1908 File:KrisztinavarosFotoThalerTamas1.jpg|View of the interior ==References== ==External links== *Official site of Our Lady of the Snows Parish Church (in Hungarian) Category:V\u00e1rker\u00fclet Category:Roman Catholic churches in Budapest Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1815 ",
