The band was formed by lead guitarist and vocalist Faraz Anwar, bassist Khalid Khan and percussionist Akhtar Qayyum in 1996. After the release of the band's first studio album, there had been many changes in the line-up the only consistent member being Faraz himself.Faraz Anwar \u2013 Interview Retrieved on March 16, 2011 Although Mizraab has been prominent in their home country since the release of their debut album Panchi (1999), they did not achieve fame and commercial success until the release of their second studio album Maazi, Haal, Mustaqbil, which was released in 2004. The album sold over 30,000 copies upon it release and is the band's highest selling album. Singles from the album like \"Kitni Sadian\" and \"Insaan\" became an instant hit in Pakistan and did very well at the local music charts. The band produced an overall of five singles along with five music videos for each single from the album, the other singles from the album are \"Panchi\", \"Meri Terhan\" and \"Izhar\". The album is also credited to be the first proper Urdu metal album released in Pakistan. After the release of their second studio album, Mizraab made a comeback into the lime light with the video for \"Ujalon Main\" in December 2006, which showcased the new band members as well as the change in genre and was well received all over the country. Mizraab\u2019s third album was completed in late 2006\u20132007 but due to the dire state of the music industry in Pakistan, no deal could be reached and the album was shelved. ==Albums== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Album information |- |1999 |Panchi *Released: April, 1999 *Recorded: 1998-1999 in Karachi, Pakistan *Label: Sound Master *Producer: Faraz Anwar |- |2004 |Maazi, Haal, Mustaqbil *Released: March 8, 2004 *Singles: \"Insaan\", \"Meri Terhan\", \"Izhar\", \"Kitni Sadian\", \"Panchi\" *Recorded: 2003-2004 at 8-93 in Karachi, Pakistan *Label: Sadaf Stereo *Producer: Faraz Anwar |- |} ===Live albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Album information |- |2009 |Live at FM 101 *Released: June 2, 2009 *Recorded: October 22, 2004 at FM 101 Studios in Karachi, Pakistan *Label: Independent *Producer: Faraz Anwar, Sharaf Qaisar |- |2010 |Mizraab - Live & Rare *Released: January 1, 2010 *Recorded: August 11, 2007 at MTV Studios in Karachi, Pakistan *Label: Independent *Producer: Faraz Anwar |- |2012 |Unplugged *Released: January 21, 2012 *Recorded: April 1, 2011 at V-Sel Outlet for MTV Pakistan in Karachi, Pakistan *Label: Independent *Producer: Faraz Anwar |- |2013 |Aag Alive *Released: February 1, 2013 *Recorded: 2007 at Aag TV Studios in Karachi, Pakistan *Label: Independent *Producer: Faraz Anwar |} ==Singles== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=45% |- !
