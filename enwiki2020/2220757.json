    "text": "The Fusiliers Marins and Commandos Marine units are under command of the Force maritime des fusiliers marins et commandos (FORFUSCO) in Lorient. It is headed by a general officer with the title of Admiral commandant Les fusiliers marins et commandos (ALFUSCO). This force carries out: * Advanced force and reconnaissance operations from the sea * Special operations * Protection of key sites and vessels of the French Navy * Provision of security for elements of the naval forces. A 2,700-man strong force, the FORFUSCO is the fourth organic force of the French Navy. == Naval Fusiliers == Groups and companies of marines are dedicated to the protection of sensitive naval sites (eg military ports, naval aviation bases, communications transmission stations, ammunition depots). The marines are also an integral part of buildings as domestic service - called \"bidellerie\" in navy slang. There are seven companies of marines (CIFUSIL), which provide protection for the following sites: *Military port of Cherbourg *Submarine base in \u00cele Longue and pyrotechnics in Guenv\u00e9nez *Naval aviation base in Lann Bihou\u00e9 *Communications center in Rosnay, Indre *Communications center in Sainte-Assise, Seine-et- Marne *Communications center in Villepinte France and South Saissac, Aude *Naval aviation base in Lanv\u00e9oc-Poulmic (unit created on 1 September 2011 after the closure of the naval aviation base in Nimes-Garons) *Naval Fusilier and Commando training center Lorient These seven companies send detachments who take turns every four to six months to ensure the protection of the communications centers of Fort-de-France, Mahina Mahina Super and around Papeete, of Ouen Toro in Noumea, and Rufisque near Dakar. They also support operations of the Naval Commandos (Commandos Marine), augment boarding and landing parties and provide military training to the French navy. == Naval Commandos== Marine Commandos are trained to targeted actions in places where it is not feasible or appropriate to deploy a larger force. They are primarily used by the French Special Operations Command (COS) since 1992. They are seven in number: Commando Jaubert, Commando Ponchardier, Commando Trepel, Commando de Montfort, Commando de Penfentenyo, Commando Kieffer, and Commando Hubert, each with their own mission specialism. They have evolved to be broadly comparable to the British SBS. == See also == * Fusiliers Marins * Commandos Marine * List of French paratrooper units * Fleet Protection Group, Royal Marines * Special Boat Service == External links == * Marines and navy commandos Site of the Navy *instruction n\u00b0 31/DEF/EMM/PL/ORA June 16, 2005 ron the organization of the FORFUSCO * Les fusiliers marins et les commandos marine - Mus\u00e9e Site of the national Navy * Les fusiliers marins et les commandos marine - Magazine LE LIEN Official Website Magazine * Les fusiliers marins et les commandos marine - \u00c9cole School site marines marine commandos Category:French naval components ",
