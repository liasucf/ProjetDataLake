He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide. Stephenson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1998.http://www.profootballhof.com/players/dwight- stephenson/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/hof/1998-ballot.htm ==Early life and college== Stephenson was born in Murfreesboro, North Carolina. He played college football at the University of Alabama under coach Bear Bryant. Bryant called Stephenson the best center he ever coached, and described him as \"a man among children\". He was the Crimson Tide's starting center from 1977 to 1979, and was a member of Alabama's back-to-back national championship teams of 1978 and 1979. He was a two-time second-team All-American; in 1978 by United Press International (UPI) and 1979 by the Associated Press (AP) and UPI. \"His speed, his foot quickness, was off the chart,\" said Mike Brock, a former Alabama lineman. \"You couldn't compare it to other people who played at that time. There was no way for defenses to deal with him.\" ==Professional career== Stephenson was drafted by Don Shula and the Miami Dolphins in the second round of the 1980 NFL Draft. He was used on special teams only until late in the 1981 season, when starting center Mark Dennard was injured. A few seasons later, Stephenson was \"universally recognized as the premier center in the NFL\". With the exceptionally explosive Stephenson as offensive captain, the Dolphins offensive line gave up the fewest sacks in the NFL for a record six straight seasons, from 1982 to 1987, which doubled the length of the previous record. He retired from pro football in 1987, after sustaining a left knee injury in a play involving New York Jets Marty Lyons and Joe Klecko. Stephenson on the Miami Dolphin Honor Roll at Dolphin Stadium.
