Dorling Kindersley Limited: 2008 The Bombay cat is also called the Black Mamba, and nicknamed the \"mini-panther\". ==Life of Bombay Cat== The breed was developed by Nikki Horner, a breeder from Louisville, Kentucky, who, starting in 1958, attempted to create a breed of cat that resembled a miniature black panther. The first attempt was a failure but the second, in 1965, was successful. The breed was officially recognized and registered by the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1970 and The International Cat Association in 1979. Nikki Horner died in 1995. == Appearance == The Bombay is a short-haired breed of domestic cat, closely related to the Burmese.

Bombay cats are known to be vocal and they cry and meow more than other cats. ==References== ==External links== Category:Cat breeds Category:Cat breeds originating in the United States ",
