The forewings are dark fuscous with the base narrowly ochreous whitish, in females with a broad streak of ochreous-whitish suffusion extended from the base along the submedian fold to the middle, sending a short branch from near the base to the dorsum at one-fourth, the main streak confluent with an irregular, strongly dentate streak of ochreous-whitish suffusion from the costa before the middle to the dorsum at about two-thirds, in males, these markings (except the basal) are not discernible. There is a terminal series of darker markings. The hindwings are dark fuscous, rather lighter anteriorly, with a whitish-ochreous oval blotch in the disc beyond the cell, larger in females. ==References== Category:Moths described in 1934 Category:Immidae Category:Moths of Oceania ",
