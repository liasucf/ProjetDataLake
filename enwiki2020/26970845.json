    "text": "Clionella is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Clavatulidae. ==Description== The shell of the species in this genus is narrowly bucciniform and turriculated. The protoconch is somewhat conical, containing 2 whorls. The whorls are somewhat flattened, longitudinally ribbed with long, flexuous ribs, and have a thick epidermis. The ribs lack subsutural or peripheral processes. The spire of the shell is elevated. The body whorl is truncated. The siphonal canal is scarcely indicated at the broad base of the aperture. The anal sinus is very shallow. The lip has a small infrasutural anal sinus with no distinct parietal tubercle. The operculum has a lateral nucleus. The foot is short, broad, and rounded behind. The eyes are located near the tip of the tentacles. Radula formula (1-1-1),George Washington Tryon, Manual of Conchology vol.
