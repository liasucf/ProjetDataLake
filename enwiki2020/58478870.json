    "text": "Tai-Ping Liu (; born 18 November 1945)National Library of Australia is a Taiwanese mathematician, specializing in partial differential equations. Tai- Ping Liu, Berkeley 1980 Liu received his bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1968 from National Taiwan University, his master's degree in 1970 from Oregon State University, and his PhD in 1973 from University of Michigan with thesis advisor Joel Smoller and thesis Riemann problem for general 2 \u00d7 2 systems of conservation laws. Afterwards Liu was a professor at University of Maryland, from 1988 at New York University and from 1990 at Stanford University, where he is now retired. Since 2000 he is a Distinguished Research Fellow at the Academia Sinica. He was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012. His research deals with nonlinear partial differential equations, hyperbolic conservation laws, shock waves, the Boltzmann equation, and equations of gas dynamics. He is the author or coauthor of over 140 research publications. In 1998 he gave the DiPerna lecture. In 1992 Liu became a member of Academia Sinica. In 2002 he was an Invited Speaker with talk Shock Waves at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing. arXiv preprint ==Selected publications== * Hyperbolic and viscous conservation laws, CBMS Regional Conference, SIAM 2000 * Admissible solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws, Memoirs AMS, No. 240, 1981. * Nonlinear stability of shock waves for viscous conservation laws, Memoirs AMS, No. 328, 1985 * with Y.
