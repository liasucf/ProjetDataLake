Only two machines were built: first one was installed at National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, second (1947) at Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL). ==Construction== Design was started in 1944. The tape-controlled (Harvard architecture) machine had two (design allowed for a total of six) processors (\"computers\") that could operate independently, * * an early form of multiprocessing. Weighed about . == Significance == * Inspired Richard Hamming to investigate the automatic error-correction, which led to invention of Hamming codes * One of the early electromechanical general purpose computers * First American machine and first George Stibitz design to use floating point arithmetic *Had an early form of multiprocessing *Had a very primitive form of an operating system, albeit in hardware. A separate hardware control unit existed to direct the sequence of computer operations. == Model VI == Built and used internally by Bell Telephone Laboratories, operational in 1949. Simplified version of the Model V (only one processor, about half the relays) but with several improvements, including one of the earliest use of the microcode. == Bibliography == * * * * * ==Further reading== * ** ** * * * * == References == == External links == * * Category:Bell Labs Category:1940s computers Category:AT&T; computers Category:Computer-related introductions in 1946 Category:Electro-mechanical computers ",
