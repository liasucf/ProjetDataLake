    "text": "Leonard Joseph Yochim (October 16, 1928 - May 11, 2013) was a professional baseball pitcher. He played in parts of two seasons in Major League Baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1951 and 1954, and later served in the organization for almost four decades. Yochim batted and threw left-handed. Yochim was born and died in New Orleans, Louisiana. Highly touted by the Pittsburgh Pirates during his career, he was a screwball specialist and had a good curve as well, but a sore arm limited him to pitch in only 28.1 innings. He pitched in two games in 1951 and ten in 1954, ending his major league career with a 1-2 record and a 7.62 ERA in 12 games (three as a starter). His professional career highlight came on December 8, 1955, when he became the first pitcher to throw a no-hitter in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League for the Leones del Caracas club. Helped by catcher Earl Battey, Yochim accomplished the feat in the Caracas 3\u20130 victory over the Navegantes del Magallanes. Ram\u00f3n Monzant was credited with the loss. Besides, he also played in the league for Vargas, Gavilanes and Magallanes, compiling a 29-20 record and a 3.57 ERA in 86 games from 1952 through 1956, while pitching for Caracas in the 1953 Caribbean Series.Venezuelan Professional Baseball League batting and pitching statistics Following his playing career, Yochim rejoined the Pittsburgh Pirates organization in 1966 to become a member of their baseball operations department. He served as an area scout, national crosschecker and major-league scout for the Pirates before moving into the front office in 1994. Yochim also worked as a senior adviser for player personnel from 1994 through 2004, when he decided not to return for another season. He was the older brother of former MLB pitcher and minor league manager and coach Ray Yochim ( 1922-2002). ==References== ==External links== *Retrosheet *Venezuelan Professional Baseball League Category:1928 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Albany Senators players Category:Atlanta Crackers players Category:Baseball players from Louisiana Category:Caribbean Series players Category:Charleston Rebels players Category:Gavilanes de Maracaibo players Category:Hollywood Stars players Category:Kansas City Athletics scouts Category:Leones del Caracas players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Navegantes del Magallanes players Category:New Iberia Cardinals players Category:New Orleans Pelicans (baseball) players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates scouts Category:Sabios de Vargas players Category:Sportspeople from New Orleans ",
