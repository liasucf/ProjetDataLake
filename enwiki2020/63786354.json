    "text": "Fragment of an inscription detailing the cursus honorum of Marcus Iallius Bassus. The gens Iallia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are not mentioned in ancient writers, but they rose to prominence during the middle part of the second century, with two of them achieving the consulship under Antoninus Pius. ==Praenomina== All of the Iallii known from inscriptions lived in imperial times, and few are mentioned with praenomina. The main praenomen of this gens seems to have been Marcus, although there is also an instance of Quintus. Both of these were among the most common names throughout Roman history. ==Branches and cognomina== The only regular cognomen of the Iallia gens was Bassus, which belonged to the senatorial family. This was a common surname, originally referring to someone who might be described as \"stout\" or \"sturdy\", and was one of a large class of cognomina derived from a person's physical features.Chase, pp. 109, 110. This family came to Rome from Alba Helviorum, perhaps indicating that they were of Gallic origin. ==Members== * Marcus Iallius, buried at Alba Helviorum in Gallia Narbonensis. His grave site seems to have been cared for by a Lucius Jullius, though perhaps this should be Iallius.. * Quintus Iallius Bassus, consul suffectus in AD 158; he and Marcus Servilius Fabianus Maximus were in office on July 8, although their full term of office is uncertain... * Marcus Iallius M. f.
