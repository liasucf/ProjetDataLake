    "text": "Humane Society of Huron Valley is an independent animal welfare organization located in Ann Arbor, MI. The organization was formed in 1896, and opened a shelter on Cherry Hill Road in 1951. ==About== The Humane Society of Huron Valley (HSHV) works to save the lives and reduce the suffering of homeless, injured and abused animals. In 2018, two kittens with cerebellar hypoplasia adopted from HSHV were featured on the The TODAY Show. The organization opposes the annual killing of deer in Ann Arbor parks. == Services == HSHV offers pet adoption services, a full service affordable veterinary clinic open to the public, 24/7 animal emergency rescue line and ambulance, community cat programs including trap-neuter-and-return, humane wildlife removal, animal cruelty investigation, dog training classes and humane education programs. In 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the shelter provided pet food assistance to local residents. === Animal Shelter === The animal shelter annually provides care to over 12,00 homeless dogs, cats, rabbits and other animals from Washtenaw County. In 2012, the shelter had 3,783 adoptions, a record number of adoptions. In 2017, HSHV took in over 7,000 cats and dogs and achieved a live release rate or \"save rate\" of 96.4%. They save all healthy and treatable animals, which is Maddie's Fund definition of a no-kill shelter, a leader in the no-kill movement. HSHV is considered an \"open admissions shelter\", meaning they do not turn away animals from within their service area. In addition to accepting animals from the public, the Humane Society of Huron Valley also serves as the stray holding facility for Washtenaw County and Plymouth, Michigan. There are prevention measures in place to try to keep pets with their owners, such as a behavior helpline, a Safe Harbor program for pet owners in a temporary housing crisis, and a supplemental pet food program called Bountiful Bowls. === Veterinary Clinic === The veterinary clinic at HSHV is an affordable, full-service clinic open to the public. The clinic is staffed with fully licensed veterinarians, including vets who specialize in wellness, surgery, dentistry, and physical therapy, and houses a full pet pharmacy. They also offer laser therapy for dogs and cats (clinically proven to reduce pain and speed healing). And in 2017, they began making housecalls within the surrounding area, in order to serve those with elderly pets, those who find it difficult to get to the vet, and those who preferred in-home pet euthanasia services. They offer low-cost spay and neuter services and have frequent low-cost vaccination clinics. ==The New Shelter== New HSHV facility HSHV's new building opened at the Cherry Hill Road location on October 28, 2009, after a closure of a few days to facilitate moving the animals from the old shelter to the new one. The fifty-year-old facility was outdated and in poor condition. After a three-year capital campaign, including a construction bond from Washtenaw County, and donations from private individuals, HSHV raised all but $850,000 of the $8.6 million needed to construct the new state- of-the-art facility. Since its opening, adoptions have gone up 29%. == The Cat Cafe == In May 2016, HSHV opened the Tiny Lions lounge and adoption Center] (or \"TLC\"), the first cat cafe in Washtenaw County. Patrons can bring in outside food or get some from the Biggby coffee shop next door, and enjoy the company of up to 20 cats from the Humane Society of Huron Valley who temporarily live at the cafe until they're adopted. TLC is at 5245 Jackson Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48103 and is open 6 days a week. They offer a variety of programs including Yoga with Cats, Family Mew-vie Nights, cat adoption and more\u2014the proceeds of which pay for the cafe cats' room and board while they await adoption. == Compassion Feast == HSHV hosts an annual fundraising event called Compassion Feast with a silent auction followed by a vegetarian meal. In 2019, the event featured Jackson Galaxy, host of Animal Planet\u2019s \u201cMy Cat from Hell.\u201d == References == == External links == * * Tiny Lions Lounge & Adoption Center Category:Non-profit organizations based in Michigan Category:Animal welfare organizations based in the United States Category:Animal shelters Category:Animal shelters in the United States Category:Organizations based in Ann Arbor, Michigan Category:Organizations established in 1896 Category:1896 establishments in Michigan ",
