It was noted for its development of the xylophone, vibraharp, organ chimes, aluminum chimes, aluminum harp, Swiss handbells, the marimba, orchestra bells, and marimbaphone. Church bells were revolutionized by Deagan through his design of tubular bells, and the NBC chimes were his creation. Its former headquarters, the tower of which still bears the company name, is a landmark in the Ravenswood neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. Since 1984, Deagan is a brand owned by Yamaha, which distributes and sells products with the Deagan name.Yamaha DC-9160B Deagan Chimes on Cosmo Music of CanadaYamaha DG1590B Deagan Bell on Yamaha Music London == History == The company was founded by John Calhoun Deagan (1853\u20131934), a professional clarinetist, in 1880. The J.C. Deagan company originally headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, until it moved to Chicago, Illinois, in early 20th century. Deagan was unsatisfied with the intonation of the glockenspiels used in theater orchestras \u2013which he had performed with\u2013 and he went on experimenting with the acoustics and tuning of the instrument. As a result of theses experiments, Deagan developed the first \"scientifically tuned\" glockenspiel. On the Sensations of Tone by German physician and physicist Hermann von Helmholtz served as strong inspiration for Deagan's advances. In 1978 the Deagan company was sold to Slingerland Drum Company, which added the Deagan instruments to its line of products.1979 Slingerland catalog Slingerland then sold the Deagan company to the \"Sanlar Corporation\", a corporation set up by Slingerland accountant Larry Gasp and his wife Sandra, in 1984.Deegan Archive on The Mallet ShopHall of Fame: John Calhoun Deagan by James A.
