This station was originally known as Keadby and Althorpe. When the line was again moved to a new alignment to cross the river by the present \"King George V\" bridge a new station was opened which is still in use. It replaced two earlier stations, Althorpe and Gunness & Burringham, which had been about half a mile apart. The station which now bears the name, became part of the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed to the Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Regional Railways until the Privatisation of British Railways. ==Services== Services call here between approximately 06:00 and 23:15 Monday to Friday, and 06:00 to 22:15 Saturday on an hourly frequency each way.
