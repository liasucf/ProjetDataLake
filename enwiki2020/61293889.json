    "text": "Julius Brennecke (born 1975) is a German molecular biologist and geneticist. He is a Senior Group Leader at the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology. (IMBA) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. == Education and career == Julius Brennecke studied biology at Heidelberg University.. During his diploma thesis (supervised by Dirk Bohmann) he focused on the tandem affinity purification of protein complexes in Drosophila,In his PhD-thesis (with Steve Cohen) he specialized on microRNAs and their regulatory targets in Drosophila. He obtained his PhD degree in 2005 (summa cum laude) from Heidelberg University jointly with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). After a short postdoctoral stay at EMBL, he carried out his postdoctoral training with Gregory Hannon at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York (2006 to 2008). In 2009 he became group leader at the Institute of Molecular Biotechnology, part of the Vienna BioCenter, where he was appointed Senior Group Leader in 2014. Brennecke is a permanent EMBO member and editorial board member of the Journal of Cell Biology == Research == In his research Brennecke focuses on small regulatory RNA pathways (foremost the piRNA/Piwi pathway) and their role in suppressing transposable elements and inducing heterochromatin formation in animals. His research group focuses on the model organism Drosophila melanogaster and applies diverse approaches, such as genetics, genomics, biochemistry, imaging technologies, and computational biology. == Selected publications == Hayashi, R., Schnabl, J., Handler, D., Mohn, F., Ameres, SL., Brennecke, J.: Genetic and mechanistic diversity of piRNA 3\u2018-end formation.
