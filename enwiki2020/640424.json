He was the son of John V, Duke of Brittany and Joan of France, the daughter of King Charles VI of France. ==Family== Francis I was originally engaged to Bonne of Savoy, the daughter of Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy and his wife Mary of Burgundy, Duchess of Savoy. She died just before their marriage in 1430, at the age of 15. Francis I's first marriage was to Yolande of Anjou, daughter of Louis II, Duke of Anjou and Yolande of Aragon; they were married in Nantes in August 1431. Francis and Yolande had a son, Renaud, Count of Montfort. His son Renaud died young and his wife Yolande died in 1440. His second marriage was to Isabel of Scotland (daughter of James I, King of Scots and Joan Beaufort); he married Isabel at the Ch\u00e2teau d'Auray on 30 October 1442. Francis and Isabel had two daughters: * Margaret of Brittany (1443\u20131469, Nantes), married Francis II, Duke of Brittany. * Marie of Brittany (1444\u20131506), married John II, Viscount of Rohan and Count of Porho\u00ebt. ==Succession== Francis I died on 17 July 1450 at the Ch\u00e2teau de l'Hermine, being only 36 years of age. Because he had no surviving male heirs at the time of his death, he was succeeded as Duke of Brittany by his younger brother, Peter II of Brittany. During his time, the residences of the Dukes of Brittany consisted of: the Ch\u00e2teau de l'Hermine; the Ch\u00e2teau de Nantes; the Ch\u00e2teau de Clisson; and the Ch\u00e2teau de Suscinio. ==Ancestry== ==See also== *Dukes of Brittany family tree ==References== Category:Dukes of Brittany Brittany, Francis I, Duke of Brittany, Francis I, Duke of Category:House of Dreux Category:15th-century peers of France Category:Montfort of Brittany Category:15th-century Breton people ",
