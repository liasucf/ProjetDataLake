There were 250,500 people in its service area in 2018, which spans the Tri-Cities metropolitan area except for Richland, which retains a city library: West Richland, Kennewick, and Pasco, and surrounding Benton, Franklin, and parts of Adams Counties are part of Mid-Columbia. It was founded in 1948, originally to serve patrons in unincorporated parts of the counties. , the last city to be annexed was Kennewick, and several cities which were still independent on paper, including Pasco and West Richland, paid Mid-Columbia to gain patronage rights for city residents. The system considered expanding to cover Walla Walla County Rural Library District in 2012. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1948 establishments in Washington (state) Category:County library systems in Washington (state) Category:Tri-Cities, Washington ",
