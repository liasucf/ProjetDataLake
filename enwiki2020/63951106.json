    "text": "The Ivy City-Fort Totten Line, designated Route E2, is a daily bus route operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority between Fort Totten station of the Red, Green, and Yellow Lines of the Washington Metro and Ivy City (Okie & 16th Streets NE). The line runs every 20-30 minutes during weekdays, 48 minutes on Saturdays, and 60 minutes on Sundays. Trips take roughly 20 minutes to complete. ==Background== Route E2 operates daily between Fort Totten station and Ivy City connecting passengers along South Dakota Avenue NE and 18th Street NE. Route E2 operates out of Bladensburg division during weekdays and Western division during weekends. ==History== Route E2, E3, E4, E5, and E8 all operated as part of the Military Road\u2013Crosstown Line through the years starting from Friendship Heights station. Route E4 originally operated up to University City Apartments in Lewisdale, Maryland but was shorten to Riggs Park in the 1970s. Routes E2, E3, and E4 terminated at Friendship Heights while E5 and E8 were shorten to Friendship Heights in 1984. During the years, the E5 and E8 were discontinued and route E6 operated as part of the Chevy Chase Line. Prior to 2015, route E2 would operate between Friendship Heights station and Ivy City (Okie & 16th Streets NE), route E4 would operate between Friendship Heights and Riggs Park (Eastern Ave & Jamaica St NE) on weekdays only, and route E3 would operate on weekends only between Friendship Heights and Ivy City via Riggs Park as a combination to route E2 and E4. During the weekends as well, route E2 would operate between Friendship Heights and Fort Totten station only. ===2012 Proposed Changes=== In 2012, WMATA proposed to eliminate routes E3 and E4 and shorten route E2 between Friendship Heights station and Fort Totten station. Service between Fort Totten and Riggs Park/Ivy City would be replaced by an extended route D4 and F6 reroute. According to WMATA, this was to reduce running time and improve on-time performance, provide a level of service along the different portions of the line east and west of Fort Totten commensurate with the significantly different passenger demand on the two portions, and allow for a more even frequency of service on the western portion of the line where the greatest demand occurs. ===2014 Proposed Changes=== In 2014, WMATA proposed to split the E2 and E4 into two separate routes. Route E2 will operate its current routing between Fort Totten station and Ivy City having the Friendship Heights station and Fort Totten section replaced by route E4 short trips. This will improve reliability of service on route E2 and E4 by operating shorter routes and create a better balance of capacity and demand throughout the line. WMATA will also have timed transfers at Fort Totten to minimize wait time. ===2015 Service Changes=== On June 21, 2015, route E2 and E4 were split into two different bus lines. Route E2 was renamed into the Ivy City\u2013Fort Totten Line and has the same routing between Fort Totten station and Ivy City while route E4 remained as the Military Road\u2013Crosstown Line replacing route E2 between Friendship Heights station and Fort Totten also adding weekend service. These changes also replaced route E3 entirely. Route E2 will have frequencies between Ivy City and Fort Totten every 20-30 minutes during the weekdays, every 48 minutes on Saturdays, and every 60 minutes on Sundays. ===2020 proposed changes=== On September 26, 2020, WMATA proposed to eliminate all route E2 weekend service and reduce the frequency during the weekdays due to low federal funding in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Route E2 has not operated weekend service since March 21, 2020. ==References== Category:2015 establishments in Washington, D.C. E2 ",
