    "text": "Martin John Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow, One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: (born 23 June 1942) is a British cosmologist and astrophysicist. He has been Astronomer Royal since 1995 and was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge from 2004 to 2012 and President of the Royal Society between 2005 and 2010. accessed 31 August 2014 accessed 31 August 2014 accessed 31 August 2014 ==Education and early life== Rees was born on 23 June 1942 in York, England.Anon (2017) GRO Register of Births: SEP 1942 9c 1465 YORK \u2013 Martin J. Rees, mmn=Bett After a peripatetic life during the war his parents, both teachers, settled with Rees, an only child, in a rural part of Shropshire near the border with Wales. There, his parents founded Bedstone College, a boarding school based on progressive educational concepts. He was educated at Bedstone College, then from the age of 13 at Shrewsbury School. He studied for the mathematical tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with first class honours. He then undertook post-graduate research at Cambridge and completed a PhD supervised by Dennis Sciama in 1967. Rees's post-graduate work in astrophysics in the mid-1960s coincided with an explosion of new discoveries, with breakthroughs ranging from confirmation of the big bang, the discovery of neutron stars and black holes, and a host of other revelations. ==Career and research== After holding postdoctoral research positions in the United Kingdom and the United States, he taught at Sussex University and the University of Cambridge, where he was the Plumian Professor until 1991, and the director of the Institute of Astronomy. From 1992 to 2003, he was Royal Society Research Professor, and from 2003 Professor of Cosmology and Astrophysics. He was Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, London, in 1975 and became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1979. He holds visiting professorships at Imperial College London and at the University of Leicester. He is a fellow of Darwin College, Cambridge, and an Honorary Fellow of King's College, Clare Hall, and Jesus College, Cambridge. Rees is the author of more than 500 research papers, and he has made contributions to the origin of cosmic microwave background radiation, as well as to galaxy clustering and formation. His studies of the distribution of quasars led to final disproof of steady state theory. He was one of the first to propose that enormous black holes power quasars, and that superluminal astronomical observations can be explained as an optical illusion caused by an object moving partly in the direction of the observer. Since the 1990s, Rees has worked on gamma-ray bursts, especially in collaboration with Peter M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, and on how the \"cosmic dark ages\" ended when the first stars formed. Since the 1970s he has been interested in anthropic reasoning, and the possibility that our visible universe is part of a vaster \"multiverse\". Rees is an author of books on astronomy and science intended for the lay public and gives many public lectures and broadcasts. In 2010 he was chosen to deliver the Reith Lectures for the BBC,The Reith Lectures 2010: The Scientific Citizen by Martin Rees, bbc.co.uk; accessed 31 August 2014. now published as From Here to Infinity: Scientific Horizons. Rees believes the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is worthwhile.Interview with Paul Broks, Prospectmagazine.co.uk; accessed 31 August 2014. Aside from expanding his scientific interests, Rees has written and spoken extensively about the problems and challenges of the 21st century, and the interfaces between science, ethics, and politics.\"Dark Materials: The legacy of Joseph Rotblat\", guardian.co.uk; accessed 31 August 2014.Podcast of Lecture \"The World in 2050\", given at the James Martin 21st Century School, 21school.ox.ac.uk, February 2009. He is a member of the Board of the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, the Oxford Martin School, and the Gates Cambridge Trust. He co-founded the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk and serves on the Scientific Advisory Board for the Future of Life Institute. He has formerly been a Trustee of the British Museum, the Science Museum and the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). In August 2014, Rees was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue. In 2015, he was co-author of the report that launched the Global Apollo Programme, which calls for developed nations to commit to spending 0.02% of their GDP for 10 years, to fund coordinated research to make carbon-free baseload electricity less costly than electricity from coal by the year 2025. His doctoral students have included Roger Blandford, Craig Hogan, Nick Kaiser Priyamvada Natarajan,, James E. Pringle and Susan Stepney. ===Publications=== *Cosmic Coincidences: Dark Matter, Mankind, and Anthropic Cosmology (co-author John Gribbin), 1989, Bantam; *New Perspectives in Astrophysical Cosmology, 1995; *Gravity's Fatal Attraction: Black Holes in the Universe, 1995; , 2nd edition 2009, *Before the Beginning \u2013 Our Universe and Others, 1997; *Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe, 1999; *Our Cosmic Habitat, 2001; *Our Final Hour: A Scientist's Warning: How Terror, Error, and Environmental Disaster Threaten Humankind's Future In This Century\u2014On Earth and Beyond (UK title: Our Final Century: Will the Human Race Survive the Twenty-first Century?), 2003; *What We Still Don't Know yet to be published. *From Here to Infinity: Scientific Horizons, 2011; *On the Future: Prospects for Humanity, October 2018, Princeton University Press; === Afterword to other books === * Afterword to Shyam Wuppuluri, Dali Wu (Eds.), \"On Art and Science: Tango of an Eternally Inseparable Duo\" Springer, The Frontier Collection 2019. ===Honours and awards=== He has been President of the Royal Astronomical Society (1992\u201394) and the British Association (1995\u201396), and was a Member of Council of the Royal Institution of Great Britain until 2010.
