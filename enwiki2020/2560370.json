    "text": "Enrico Arrigoni (pseudonym: Frank Brand) (February 20, 1894 Pozzuolo Martesana, Province of Milan \u2013 December 7, 1986 New York City) was an Italian American individualist anarchist, a lathe operator, house painter, bricklayer, dramatist and political activist influenced by the work of Max Stirner.Enrico Arrigoni at the Daily Bleed's Anarchist Encyclopedia Paul Avrich. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America == Life and activism == He took the pseudonym \"Brand\" from a fictional character in one of Henrik Ibsen\u00b4s plays. In the 1910s, he became involved in anarchist and anti-war activism around Milan. From the 1910s until the 1920s, he participated in anarchist activities and popular uprisings in various countries including Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Argentina and Cuba. He lived from the 1920s onwards in New York City, and there he edited the individualist anarchist eclectic journal Eresia in 1928. He also wrote for other American anarchist publications such as L' Adunata dei refrattari, Cultura Obrera, Controcorrente and Intessa Libertaria. During the Spanish Civil War, he went to fight with the anarchists but was imprisoned and was helped in his release by Emma Goldman. Afterwards, Arrigoni became a longtime member of the Libertarian Book Club in New York City. He lived in the US as an illegal immigrant. During the 1960s, he helped Cuban anarchists who were suffering the repression of the recently established Fidel Castro\u00b4s Marxist-Leninist regime.\"In the company of his old Italian friend Enrico Arrigoni, and urged on by him, Ferro commenced \u201cto write several articles about the Cuban reality\u201d which, with the help of Arrigoni\u2019s translations, were published in the anarchist press of France, Italy, Mexico, and Argentina. According to Ferro, \u201cIn the majority of our milieus [these articles] were received with displeasure,\u201d owing to the \u201centhusiasm\u201d with which the Cuban Revolution had been received in them. But in other cases anarchists rallied to the Cuban libertarian cause. Reconstruir (\u201cTo Reconstruct\u201d) in Buenos Aires, whose publishing house, Colectivo, fully identified with the Cuban anarchists, published all of Ferro\u2019s works.\"Frank Fern\u00e1ndez. Cuban Anarchism: The History of A Movement Along with the exiled Cuban anarchist Manuel Ferro, they \"began a campaign in Italy itself...They turned to the most important Italian anarchist periodical, Umanita Nova (\u201cNew Humanity\u201d), the official publication of the Federazione Anarchica Italiana, with the idea of counterbalancing the undeniable influence of L\u2019Adunata in the Italian-American anarchist community, and more especially of responding to a series of pro-Cuban Revolution articles published in that weekly by Armando Borghi. Umanita Nova refused to publish Ferro's articles (translated by Arrigoni), saying that they didn't want to create a polemic. At that point, Arrigoni accused them of being in the pay of the Communists, and they eventually published Ferro's responses to Borghi. A few months later, Borghi \u2014 ignoring the points raised by Ferro \u2014 published a new defense of Castroism in L\u2019Adunata, but Umanita Nova refused to publish Ferro's response to it.\"Frank Fern\u00e1ndez. Cuban Anarchism: The History of A Movement Arrigoni also translated articles written by Ferro which were published in the anarchist press of France, Italy, Mexico, and Argentina. According to Ferro, \u201cIn the majority of our milieus [these articles] were received with displeasure,\u201d owing to the \u201centhusiasm\u201d with which the Cuban Revolution had been received in them.

American anarchist writer Hakim Bey in 1991 talked about Arrigoni in this way: \"Like the Italian Stirnerites (who influenced us through our late friend Enrico Arrigoni) we support all anti-authoritarian currents, despite their apparent contradictions.\"Hakim Bey. \"An esoteric interpretation of the I.W.W. preamble\" == Written works == * The totalitarian nightmare (1975) * The lunacy of the Superman (1977) * Adventures in the country of the monoliths (1981) * Freedom: my dream First published by the Libertarian Book Club in 1937, reprinted by Western World Press in 1986, and LBC Books (Little Black Cart), March 2012.http://lbcbooks.com/freedom-my-dream/ == References == Category:1894 births Category:1986 deaths Category:People from the Province of Milan Category:Italian anarchists Category:American writers of Italian descent Category:American anarchists Category:Italian emigrants to the United States Category:Individualist anarchists Category:Egoist anarchists Category:House painters Category:American bricklayers ",
