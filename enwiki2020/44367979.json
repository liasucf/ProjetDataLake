    "text": "The Hamilton Apartments are a historic apartment house at 113 West Danner Street in West Memphis, Arkansas. It is a two-story brick and stucco structure with a gable-on-hip roof. The first floor is finished in brick veneer up to the base of the second floor windows, while the rest of the exterior is finished in cream-colored stucco. The main entrance is centered on front facade, and there is a projecting bay with gable roof above, finished in stucco with applied half-timber detailing. The interior includes well- preserved period woodwork and plasterwork. Built in 1936, this building is one of a modest number of buildings to survive a major flood of the area the following year, owing to its location on some of the highest ground in the area. The building is also an excellent local example of Craftsman-Tudor Revival styling. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Crittenden County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures in West Memphis, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Crittenden County, Arkansas Category:Apartment buildings in Arkansas ",
