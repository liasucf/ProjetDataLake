    "text": "The General Administration Department (, abbreviated GAD) is a civil service body that staffs all regional and state-level governments in Myanmar and provides administration for the country's myriad districts and townships. It also plays a central role in administering the country's administrative capital of Naypyidaw, as the Constitution of Myanmar stipulates that the head of GAD is the secretary of the Naypyidaw Council, and that the GAD offices are to be co-located with the Naypyidaw Council offices. On 28 December 2018, it was reorganized and reinvoked under the Ministry of the Office of the Union Government after being detached from the Ministry of Home Affairs. ==References== ==See also== *Ministry of Home Affairs *Cabinet of Myanmar Category:Government agencies of Myanmar Category:Civil services ",
