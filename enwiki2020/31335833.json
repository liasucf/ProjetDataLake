At 6,000 acres, it is the largest municipal park in the county. The parkway was created in 1976 when the city purchased all assets related to the Kern River from Tenneco West. ==Park description== There are two trails through the park. On the north is an equestrian trail. The trail on the south is known as a jogging trail, but can also be used with non-motorized forms of transportation.Kern River Parkway .
