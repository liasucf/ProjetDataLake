    "text": "The Z User Group exists to promote use and development of the Z notation, a formal specification language for the description of and reasoning about computer-based systems. It was formally constituted on 14 December 1992 during the ZUM'92 Z User Meeting in London, England. ==Meetings and conferences== ZUG has organised a series of Z User Meetings approximately every 18 months initially. From 2000, these became the ZB Conference (jointly with the B-Method, co-organized with APCB), and from 2008 the ABZ Conference (with Abstract State Machines as well). In 2010, the ABZ Conference also includes Alloy, a Z-like specification language with associated tool support.Frappier, M., Gl\u00e4sser, U.; , Khurshid, S., Laleau, R., and Reeves, S.
