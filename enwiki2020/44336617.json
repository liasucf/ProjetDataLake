Sessions was selected All-Southern thrice. Sessions was the first secretary-treasurer of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. Sessions represented Jefferson County, Alabama in the Alabama State House of Representatives from the 1940s to the 1960s. He sponsored a house resolution which called for a renewal of the long- suspended Alabama-Auburn rivalry, but it was voted down by the Alabama State Senate by a 21-9 vote. Despite the setback, the football rivalry was renewed within the next five years. ==References== Category:American football centers Category:1898 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Alabama Crimson Tide football players Category:All-Southern college football players Category:Sportspeople from Birmingham, Alabama Category:Players of American football from Alabama Category:Members of the Alabama House of Representatives ",
