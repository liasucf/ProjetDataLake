The tournament ran from 20 June until 2 July. It was the 91st staging of the Wimbledon Championships, and the third Grand Slam tennis event of 1977. ==Centenary celebrations== On the opening day of the tournament, Monday 20 June, to celebrate the centenary of the first Gentlemen's Singles event, former singles champions were presented with a medal by Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Kent on Centre Court. Those attending were: Kitty Godfree, Jean Borotra, Ren\u00e9 Lacoste, Henri Cochet, Jack Crawford, Sidney Wood, Fred Perry, Dorothy Round, Don Budge, Alice Marble, Yvon Petra, Jack Kramer, Bob Falkenburg, Ted Schroeder, Budge Patty, Dick Savitt, Margaret duPont, Frank Sedgman, Louise Brough, Vic Seixas, Doris Hart, Jaroslav Drobn\u00fd, Tony Trabert, Shirley Irvin, Lew Hoad, Chuck McKinley, Ashley Cooper, Maria Bueno, Alex Olmedo, Neale Fraser, Angela Barrett, Rod Laver, Karen Susman, Roy Emerson, Billie Jean King, Manuel Santana, John Newcombe, Ann Jones, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Stan Smith, Jan Kode\u0161, Arthur Ashe, Chris Evert and Bj\u00f6rn Borg. Jacques Brugnon and Elizabeth Ryan were invited to represent all of the doubles champions. Ryan won a total of 19 doubles titles, a record that remains to date. Jimmy Connors (who was the number one seed for the tournament) did not attend the event, choosing instead to practise with Ilie N\u0103stase at the time of the ceremony. This apparent snub by the American earned him harsh booing from the Centre Court crowd when he appeared to play his first round match the following day. The All England Club responded to media enquiries when Major David Mills, the secretary, issued this terse statement: \"Medals will be sent only to former champions who indicated they could not be here, and not to those who were here and had the extreme discourtesy not to collect it.\". To commemorate the centenary of the event, all former singles champions were offered a place in the main draw by the All England Club. Several former singles champions (some of whom had been retired) competed in the championships as a result. Bj\u00f6rn Borg, Jimmy Connors, Stan Smith, Rod Laver and Jan Kode\u0161 competed in the gentlemen's singles, with John Newcombe and Neale Fraser playing in the doubles. Chris Evert, Maria Bueno, Karen Susman and Billie Jean King played in the ladies singles, with Ann Jones competing in the ladies doubles. ==Prize money== The total prize money for 1977 championships was \u00a3222,540. The winner of the men's title earned \u00a315,000 while the women's singles champion earned \u00a313,500. {|class=wikitable style=font-size:90%;text-align:center |- | style=\"width:130px; background:#efefef;\"|Event | style=\"width:80px; background:lime;\"|W | style=\"width:85px; background:thistle;\"|F | style=\"width:85px; background:#ff0;\"|SF | style=\"width:85px; background:#ffebcd;\"|QF | style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 16 | style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 32 | style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 64 | style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 128 |- | style=\"background:#ededed;\"|Men's Singles |\u00a315,000 |\u00a38,000 |\u00a34,000 |\u00a32,000 |\u00a31,200 |\u00a3600 |\u00a3350 |\u00a3200 |- | style=\"background:#ededed;\"|Women's Singles |\u00a313,500 |\u00a37,000 |\u00a33,500 |\u00a31,600 |\u00a3925 |\u00a3460 |\u00a3270 |\u00a3150 |- | style=\"background:#ededed;\"|Men's Doubles * |\u00a36,000 |\u00a33,000 |\u00a32,000 |\u00a31,000 |\u00a3500 |\u00a3150 |\u00a30 | |- | style=\"background:#ededed;\"|Women's Doubles * |\u00a35,200 |\u00a32,600 |\u00a31,600 |\u00a3800 |\u00a3350 |\u00a3100 |\u00a30 | |- | style=\"background:#ededed;\"|Mixed Doubles * |\u00a33,000 |\u00a31,500 |\u00a3700 |\u00a3400 |\u00a3200 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 | |} * per team ==Champions== ===Seniors=== ====Men's Singles==== Bj\u00f6rn Borg defeated Jimmy Connors, 3\u20136, 6\u20132, 6\u20131, 5\u20137, 6\u20134 *It was Borg's second consecutive Wimbledon title and 4th Grand Slam title overall. ====Women's Singles==== Virginia Wade defeated Betty St\u00f6ve, 4\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20131 *It was Wade's first and only Wimbledon title, third and final Grand Slam title overall.
