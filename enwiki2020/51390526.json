They are driven to a correctional facility or police station, lectured on how to dress and almost always released on the same day after their fathers, husbands or brothers go to the station to get them released. In 2013's Iranian Mother's Day, the patrols rewarded flowers to women for wearing chador (the preferred hijab style). === Controversy === Delica van parked in front of Mellat Park, Tehran A matter of controversy in Iran, some officials and authorities state that based on their interpretation of Iranian police as an Islamic religious police, the Guidance Patrols serve to fulfill the requisites enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong and are demanded by the people. Others oppose their existence on the grounds that the police should respect citizens' freedom and dignity, and enforce the law, not sharia. They have also been criticized for being un-Islamic, most importantly because performing the requisites is haraam (forbidden) when it leads to sedition. It is also argued that the notion is a mutual obligation (including remonstrating officials by the people as well) limited to one side. The guidance patrol has also harassed trans women for lack of gender conformity.https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-transgender/28931543.html When an Iranian trans woman was beaten in April 2018, police refused to help her.https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/05/21/irans-transgender-community-are- being-beaten-and-disowned-in-spite-of-legal-protections/ On 27 December 2017, Brig. Gen. Hossein Rahimi, head of Greater Tehran police, said, \u201cAccording to the commander of the NAJA - Law Enforcement Force of the Islamic Republic of Iran, those who do not observe Islamic values and have negligence in this area will no longer be taken to detention centers, a legal case will not be made for them and we will not send them to court; rather, education classes to reform their behavior will be offered.\u201d == References == Category:Law enforcement in Iran Category:2005 establishments in Iran Category:Organizations that oppose LGBT rights Category:Women in Iran Category:Islamism in Iran Category:Human rights abuses in Iran Category:LGBT in Iran Category:Islamic religious police Category:Clothing controversies Category:Clericalism in Iran ",
