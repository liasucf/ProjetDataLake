    "text": "Punarjani Guha is a 150-metre natural tunnel in a rocky cliff situated in Thiruvilwamala in Thrissur District of Kerala state. ==Ritual== The ritual can be practised only on Ekadasi and that also on the eleventh day of every lunar fortnight. The day is called Guruvayur Ekadasi or Vrischika Ekadasi day, in the Malayalam month of Vrishchikam. First the devotee has to take bath in the Papanasini Theertham, a water source near the cliff. It is believed that performing noozhal or crawling through the tunnel from one end to the other will wash away all the sins and thus allow one to attain Moksha, or freedom from rebirth. ==References== Category:Landforms of Kerala Category:Tunnels in India Category:Natural arches Category:Rock formations of India Category:Prehistoric India Category:History of Kerala Category:History of Thrissur district Category:Caves of Kerala Category:Tourist attractions in Thrissur district ",
