    "text": "The Moore-Jacobs House is a historic house at 500 North Main Street in Clarendon, Arkansas. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a side- gable roof and an projecting entry pavilion with a pedimented gable supported by paired square columns. Built in about 1870, this Greek Revival house is a testament to that style's enduring popularity in Arkansas. It was moved across the street from its original location in 1931. It was also for many years home to Margaret Moore-Jacobs, known for her inspirational writings. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Monroe County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Greek Revival houses in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1870 Category:Houses in Monroe County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Monroe County, Arkansas ",
