    "text": "My Own Pool of Light is the third studio album by indie rock band, Holy Holy. The album was released in August 2019 and debuted and peaked at number 14 on the ARIA Charts. It was the first album self-produced and in an interview with Zo\u00eb Radas, the band explained \"It just gave us so much more freedom. We also both had the same idea that we weren't really concerned about trying to capture these really beautiful mics in a really beautiful room; we were happy with any decent mic into a laptop. I guess we just felt like the ideas and the messages and the melodies were what were most important\". At the ARIA Music Awards of 2019, the album was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Rock Album. At the J Awards of 2019, the album was nominated for Australian Album of the Year. ==Reception== Carley Hall from The Music AU said \"Taking the production reins on their latest My Own Pool of Light has again seen an evolution for the duo, but it's a slow-burner. The appeal doesn't strike as immediately as it did on their debut, but it does seep beneath the surface after a while.\" Hall called the '80s-tinged 'Teach Me About Dying' as the album's highlight. Josh Lesson from the Newcastle Herald said \"For a band who over two albums have become one of Australia's best guitar bands, My Own Pool of Light could be seen as a momentous gamble by Holy Holy. This is no guitar album. Holy Holy's Oscar Dawson and Tim Carroll have thrown their music open to all possibilities; keyboards, vocal chants and electronic beats [and] the result is thrilling.\" Jake Cleland from Stack Magazine said \"Holy Holy's third album never stops surprising, changing shapes between tracks for a diverse rock record bound by a sense of restlessness. My Own Pool of Light tries on slinky funk verses on 'Faces', evokes the 'Thunderstruck' riff on 'Sandra', skirts trip-hop on 'Starting Line' and catches New Wave with 'Frida' on the way out. These two make it look almost too easy. \" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | 2 August 2019 | | Holy Holy / Wonderlick Entertainment / Sony Music Australia | LICK029 / LICK030 |} ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Sony Music Australia albums ",
