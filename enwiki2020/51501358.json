In 1998, he was initially part of the Urbarian Gym (URBARIAN GYM / UBG), a Japanese hip-hop group, which also featured popular Japanese rapper Zeebra beginning in 1997. He would go on to sign with the Pony Canyon label in 2004, releasing his first album, Vivid, in April the following year. He would release one more album under the Pony Canyon label before splitting off to do his own projects. UBG would later disband in 2010. After UBG's disbandment, in 2010, he co-founded the Raider Music Record and helped create the underground hip-hop group THE RAIDERS, becoming the executive producer. The group would release one album, The Raiders, along with several singles. -MARKIT would also collaborate with other artists, though they were under different labels. ==Biography== Daisuke \"KM- MARKIT\" Kawai was born in Tokyo, Japan on December 16, 1976. In 1998, he joined the Urbarian Gym, a hip-hop group who was created by Japanese rapper ZEEBRA in 1997. Daisuke would break away from the group to begin his solo projects under the Pony Canyon label in 2005, with his debut album Vivid (stylized as VIVID). The album would feature Koda Kumi, who was one of Japan's more popular artist at the time (alongside Namie Amuro and Ayumi Hamasaki). This was despite Kumi being under the Avex sub-label Rhythm Zone at the time. He would release his second studio album, Mark Out (stylized as MARK OUT), a year later on May 12, 2006. Unlike Vivid, Mark Out would chart at No. 97 on the Oricon charts. It remained on the charts for two weeks. The album featured famed singer-songwriter Miliyah Kato. Urbarian Gym would disband thirteen years after their debut on March 24, 2010. In 2010, after UBG's disbandment, KM-MARKIT co-founded the label RAIDERMUZIK RECORDS, and would join the underground hip-hop group The Raiders, coming on as the executive producer. Other members included MINESIN, D-ON, HAR-CO, 8, HI-D, YUKALI, MICHO, KOHH, TY-KOH, TAKESHI & SATOSHI and Mr. LOW-D. Their first single, Oh Baby (stylized as OH BABY), would feature KM-MARKIT, YUKALI and 8. They would release their first album, The Raiders, the following year. The Raiders would go on to release a few singles following their debut album: Get It On (stylized as GET IT ON), B.M.N. (Big Monster Nuts) and Shut a Fu%k Up!!!. KM-MARKIT would release a few solo works post The Raiders album under the RAIDERMUZIK RECORDS label. These included Next Episode featuring NaNa in 2010, and Magnetic featuring miray in late 2014. Outside of The Raiders, KM-MARKIT would work behind-the-scenes with various artists as a lyricist and composer. He wrote the lyrics for the Japanese translations of the songs \"Blood Sweat & Tears\", \"DNA\", \"Not Today\" and \"MIC Drop\" from the 2018 BTS album Face Yourself, along with writing the lyrics to the albums' original songs \"Go Go\" and \"Crystal Snow\". He also worked with Japanese hip-hop group Lead for the songs \"Shampoo Bubble\" (2017), of which he wrote the rap portion of the song, and \"Drop in the box\" (2019), in which both he and RYUJA composed the instrumental. ==Uncharted singles== ===Magnetic (along with miray)=== Magnetic (stylized as MAGNETIC) is the third solo single by rapper KM-MARKIT. It featured R&B;/dancehall/reggae artist miray. miray had previously worked with KM-MARKIT on her self-titled album, miray, in mid-2010. The single failed to chart on Oricon and Recochoku. Information Magnetic is the third solo single by KM-MARKIT and features reggae artist miray. The single was digitally released on November 19, 2014. The song was released on iTunes Japan as a digital single. miray was initially under the Avex sub-label Rhythm Zone. On August 4, 2010 (four years prior to the single), she and had featured KM-MARKIT on her album miray in the song \"Box Seat\" (stylized as BOX SEAT). However, upon the release of Magnetic, she was no longer under the Rhythm Zone sub-label and chose to focus on independent work. This independent work led her to the indie record label Raider Music Record, which was co-founded by KM-MARKIT himself. Despite being a single, \"Magnetic\" did not receive a music video and was released solely as audio, not unlike his prior singles, Give a Little... and Next Episode feat. NaNa. The song was classified as electronica/rap due to the synthesizer used predominately throughout the song.
