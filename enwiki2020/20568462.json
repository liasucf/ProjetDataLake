    "text": "Bernard Ouchard (1925 in Mirecourt - 1979 in Vittel) was a French master bow maker and teacher in the School of Violin and Bowmaking of Mirecourt, France. He is considered by some to have been the last historical French master bow maker. Bernard Ouchard was the son of \u00c9mile Auguste Ouchard and the grandson of \u00c9mile Francois Ouchard, both famous bowmakers. He learned his craft from his father and later worked for Vidoudez (a violinmaker of international repute) in Geneva. He was asked to return to France and give a new impetus to the revival of the French tradition(s) of bow making. He became the master bowmaker and teacher in the School of Violin and Bowmaking of Mirecourt, France. \"Bernard, (b. 1925) son of E. A. Ouchard, became his pupil, and worked with Vidoudez in Geneva before being appointed professor of bow making at the Mirecourt school in 1971, giving rise to the New French School which has produced such luminaries as Beno\u00eet Rolland, Jean-Francois Raffin and Stephane Thomachot. Most notable of the younger generation include Edwin Clement, Sylvain Bigot, Gilles Nehr and Yannick LeCanu.\" Gennady Filimonov-Gennady Filimonov ==References== * * * * Dictionnaire Universel del Luthiers - Rene Vannes 1951,1972, 1985 (vol.3) * Universal Dictionary of Violin & Bow Makers - William Henley 1970 ==External links== * List of contemporary bow makers * The Ouchard dynasty Category:1925 births Category:1979 deaths Category:People from Mirecourt Category:Bow makers Category:Luthiers Category:Bowed string instrument makers ",
