    "text": "Arambourgisuchus (\"[Prof. Camille] Arambourg's crocodile\") was a dyrosaurid crocodylomorph from the late Palaeocene of Morocco, found in the region of Sidi Chenane in 2000, following collaboration by French and Moroccan institutions, and described in 2005 by a team led by palaeontologist St\u00e9phane Jouve. Its type and only species is A. khouribgaensis, after the town of Khouribga, near which the holotype was found. ==Material== Holotype skull seen from above and below Four specimens of this taxon have been found: *OCP DEK-GE 300 (holotype): nearly complete and crushed skull, lacking the anterior part of the rostrum *OCP DEK-GE 18: crushed, almost complete skull, including mandible *OCP DEK-GE 269: posterior part of mandibular symphysis with five or six teeth alveoli on each side *OCP DEK-GE 1200: Anteriormost portion of a mandibular symphysis The remains of A. khourgbaensis were found in a phosphate mine in the region of Sidi Chenane, part of the Ouled Abdoun Basin. The age of this animal is therefore Thanetian (late Palaeocene). ==Systematics== Arambourgisuchus khourbgaensis is a member of the Dyrosauridae, based on the presence of the following synapomorphies: *presence of large occipital tuberosities *supratemporal fenestra largely longer than wide According to Jouve et al. (2005), it is probably one of the most derived forms, but the lack of better material makes a correct determination of its affinities difficult. ==Palaeobiology== The skull of A. khourbgaensis was proportionally one of the longest among all of the Dyrosauridae, reaching a length of 1 meter. Its teeth were sharp but strong and large, as well as being less numerous than the ones in Dyrosaurus phosphaticus. Like other dyrosaurids, it was a marine predator. ==References== * Category:Prehistoric reptile genera Category:Prehistoric marine crocodylomorphs Category:Paleocene crocodylomorphs Category:Fossils of Morocco Category:Dyrosaurids ",
