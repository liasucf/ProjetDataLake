    "text": "Warhol superstars were a clique of New York City personalities promoted by the pop artist Andy Warhol during the 1960s and early 1970s.Watson, Steven (2003), \"Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties\" Pantheon Books, pp. 10\u201312 These personalities appeared in Warhol's artworks and accompanied him in his social life, epitomizing his famous dictum, \"In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes\". Warhol would simply film them, and declare them \"superstars\". ==History== Ultra Violet (Isabelle Collin Dufresne) The first recognised superstar was Baby Jane Holzer, whom Warhol featured in many of his early film experiments. The superstars would help Warhol generate publicity while Warhol offered fame and attention in return. Warhol's philosophies of art and celebrity met in a way that imitated the Hollywood studio system at its height in the 1930s and 1940s.Watson, Steven (2003), \"Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties\" Pantheon Books, p. 177 Among the best-known of Warhol's superstars was Edie Sedgwick.Watson, Steven (2003), \"Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties\" Pantheon Books, pp. 210\u2013217 She and Warhol became very close during 1965 but their relationship ended abruptly early in the next year. Warhol would continue to associate himself with people including Viva, Candy Darling, Ultra Violet, Nico and International Velvet. Warhol's studio, The Factory, played host to most of his superstars and as his experiments in film continued he became more interested in the bohemian eccentrics attracted to the studio.Watson, Steven (2003), \"Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties\" Pantheon Books Some of the most important superstars to emerge from the period of the first Factory (known as the 'Silver Factory' because silver foil had been applied to the walls and ceilings) include Paul America, Ondine, Taylor Mead, Rolando Pe\u00f1a, Mary Woronov, Eric Emerson, Gerard Malanga, Billy Name, Brigid Berlin and Sappheo. In the later films, made in collaboration with Paul Morrissey, Warhol brought in new superstars including Joe Dallesandro, Penny Arcade, Andrea Feldman, Jane Forth, Geraldine Smith, Luke Wienecke and Sylvia Miles. During this period Warhol developed an increasing fascination with trans women and drag queens, and promoted Candy Darling, Holly Woodlawn and Jackie Curtis to superstar status. Many of the superstars were celebrated in Lou Reed's song Walk on the Wild Side.https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2015/dec/07/holly-woodlawn- walk-on-the-wild-side-lou-reed-candy-little-joe Warhol significantly reduced his public accessibility after being shot by Valerie Solanas in 1968. The age of the Warhol superstar soon faded. ==Films== Chelsea Girls (a film about life amongst the superstars at Hotel Chelsea) was the only film to achieve success beyond the confines of artistic New York. The later Warhol/Morrissey collaborations Flesh, Trash, Heat and Women in Revolt, into which Warhol had little input, are more frequently seen. ==List of Warhol superstars== Billy Name Mary Woronov *Paul America *Pat Ast *Benedetta Barzini *Richard Bernstein (artist who did the covers of Interview for 15 years) *Susan Bottomly (later known as International Velvet) *Jayne County *Jackie Curtis *Joe Dallesandro *Candy Darling *Isabelle Collin Dufresne (Ultra Violet) *Eric Emerson *Andrea Feldman *Jane Forth *Cyrinda Foxe *Bibbe Hansen (mother of musician Beck) *Fred Herko *Jane Holzer *Ed Hood (actor in Warhol's My Hustler) *Sally Kirkland *Naomi Levine *Elecktrah Lobel (actress who starred in Kitchen and The Life of Juanita Castro) *Gerard Malanga *Taylor Mead *Mario Montez (Batman Dracula; Camp; The Chelsea Girls; Harlot; Hedy, Mario Banana; More Milk, Yvette) *Billy Name *Ivy Nicholson (Batman Dracula, Couch, Four Stars, I, a Man, John and Ivy, ) *Nico *Ondine *Rolando Pe\u00f1a, The Black Prince Rolando Pe\u00f1a (also known as El Principe Negro / The Black Prince) *Brigid Polk *Ruby Lynn Reyner *Edie Sedgwick *Jack Smith *Ingrid Superstar *Cherry Vanilla *Viva *Louis Waldon (The Nude Restaurant, Lonesome Cowboys, San Diego Surf, Flesh, Blue Movie) *Chuck Wein *Holly Woodlawn *Mary Woronov ==References== ==External links== *Warholstars Andy Warhol Films, Art and Superstars Category:American artist groups and collectives ",
