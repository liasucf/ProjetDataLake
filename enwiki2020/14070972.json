It was named after Vice President Schuyler Colfax. ==History== Colfax was founded in 1870 as a communal settlement of 397 German immigrants led by General Carl Wulsten. The colonists had been organized by the German Colonization society of Chicago. It was the first non-indigenous community in what is now Custer County, Colorado. The principal activities were farming and cheesemaking. The communal effort failed after a frost and the settlers left the town. However, many of the settlers remained in the area as ranchers and farmers.Gayle Turk (1975) Wet Mountain Valley, Colorado Springs: Little London Press, p.6. ==See also== * List of ghost towns in Colorado ==References== Category:Ghost towns in Colorado Category:Former populated places in Custer County, Colorado Category:Populated places established in 1870 Category:1970 establishments in Colorado ",
