Champs-sur-Yonne is part of the metropolitan area of Auxerre ==Geography== Champs is in the Valley of the Yonne River, on the east bank of the river. The soil is alluvial, made both from local limestones and erosion products from the source of the Yonne in the Morvan. There is little agriculture in the mostly built up village, but typical crops include wheat, hemp, and sunflowers. ==History== There have been local settlements in the area since at least Roman times, but the growth of Champs as a distinct commune dates from the building of the three water mills on the Yonne in the eighteenth century. ==Population== *1962= 721 *1968= 820 *1975= 1163 *1982= 1489 *1990= 1525 *1999= 1382 *2006= 1712 ==See also== *Communes of the Yonne department ==References== Category:Communes of Yonne ",
