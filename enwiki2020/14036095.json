    "text": "The Idoru is a post-hardcore band from, Budapest, Hungary. The group was formed in 2003 by ex-members of the Hungarian hard-core and metalcore band, Newborn. The original line-up consisted of Tibor Szalkai (guitars), G\u00e1bor Nagy (guitars), M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Moh\u00e1csi (bass), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szab\u00f3 (drums) and Andr\u00e1s B\u00f6decs (vocals). However, three members (B\u00f6decs, Szab\u00f3 and Moh\u00e1csi) of the original line-up left the band in 2009. The band noted for the success of the song Monochrome from their third album entitled Monologue. ==Band history== The band quickly stood up and started to play several gigs in their local area, and soon shows appeared abroad in their schedule. Spending their year to establish a base for the further actions, they realized that it was time for them to create their first record. In the fall of this year they've started the recording, and on a New Year's Eve live appearance of the band the mcd entitled After the Storm (EP) came to life. This three song debut was the product of the collaboration between the guys and a label from Japan called Alliance-Trax. The band HQ was satisfied with the result, and decided a future plan with their Japanese fellows in crime. In the first days of the new year an order arrived from the country of the rising sun: Get in the studio now! After three months of work their debut album titled Brand New Way, Brand New Situation (album) was recorded in late 2004. At the fall of 2004 the band joined the team of the successfully uprising Austrian label Burning Season Records and the full-length album was released in February 2005. In 2005 after recording their 3rd record Hopeless Illusions EP, they decided to leave Burning Season Records and join to Deadbutcher Records what is owned by their good friend Mikita, who helped them in many ways during the past few years. The Idoru combines the forces of metal, hardcore and punkrock genres straight into your face on their latest and fourth studio album called Time, and this \"time\" they complete the album with acoustic songs as well. The material was recorded at SuperSize Recording, which is the most professional studio in Hungary, led by well qualified experts, such as Zoli Varga, who has also been the producer for the band over the past several years. By the way, this quintet won the Fonogram award in the category of best modern rock-metal album in 2012 /for the second time in the band's career/ with their latest record,\"Time\u201d. It is said that this is the most remarkable appreciation by the Hungarian music sphere. The history of the band began in 2003, since then they went through many European underground headliner tours, even in Russia, and played a couple of shows with the California band \"Ignite\" in Japan, joined the Misfits on their European tour, and during the years they survived several member changes. In 2012, the current line-up is stronger than ever, which is proved through their new creation. So check it out, and drop some lines!
