    "text": "L\u00edngua Geral (, General Language) is the name of two distinct lingua francas, spoken in Brazil: the L\u00edngua Geral Paulista (Tupi Austral, or Southern Tupi), which was spoken in the region of S\u00e3o Paulo but is now extinct, and the L\u00edngua Geral Amaz\u00f4nica (Tupinamb\u00e1) of the Amazon whose modern descendant is Nheengatu. Both were simplified versions of the Tupi language, the native language of the Tupi people. Portuguese colonizers arrived in Brazil in the 16th century, and faced with an indigenous population that spoke many languages, they sought a means to establish effective communication among the many groups. The two languages were used in the Jesuit Reductions, the Jesuit missions in Brazil and by early colonists; and came to be used by black slaves and other Indian groups. ==References== *Campbell, Lyle (1997).
