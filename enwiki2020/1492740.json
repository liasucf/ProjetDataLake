    "text": "Jos\u00e9 Cipriano Castro Ruiz (12 October 1858 \u2013 4 December 1924) was a high- ranking member of the Venezuelan military, politician and the President of Venezuela from 1899 to 1908. He was the first man from the Andes to rule the country, and was the first of five military strongmen from the Andean state of T\u00e1chira to rule the country over the next 46 years. ==Early life== Cipriano Castro at the age of 25 Cipriano Castro was the son of Jos\u00e9 Carmen Castro and Pelagia Ruiz. He was born on 12 October 1858 in Capacho, T\u00e1chira. Castro's father was a mid-level farmer and he received an education typical of the tachirense middle-class. His family had significant mercantile and family relations with Colombia, in particular with C\u00facuta and Puerto Santander. After studying in his native town and the city of San Crist\u00f3bal, he continued his studies at a seminary school in Pamplona, Colombia (1872\u20131873). He left those studies to return to San Crist\u00f3bal, where he began work as employee of a company called Van Dissel, Thies and Ci'a. He also worked as a cowboy in the Andean region. ===Military experience and introduction to politics=== In 1876 Castro opposed the candidacy of general Francisco Alvarado for the presidency of the T\u00e1chira state. In 1878 he was working as the manager of the newspaper El \u00c1lbum when he participated along with a group of independence advocates in the seizure of San Crist\u00f3bal when they refused to submit to the authority of the new president of the state. In 1884, he got into a disagreement with a parish priest, Juan Ram\u00f3n C\u00e1rdenas in Capacho, which led to his imprisonment in San Crist\u00f3bal. After six months, he escaped and took refuge in C\u00facuta, where he ran an inn.Unsigned (28 August 1901) \"Man of Mark: Is President Castro Whose Life of War, Adventure and Romance Would Keep a Dozen Novelists Busy\" Moberly Evening Democrat (vol. 31) (Moberly Missouri) p.1, col. 3 There he met his future wife, Rosa Zoila Mart\u00ednez, who would become known as Do\u00f1a Zoila. In June 1886, he returned to the T\u00e1chira as a soldier, accompanying generals Segundo Prato, Macabeo Maldonado and Carlos Rangel Garbiras to again raise the flag of autonomy, much to the dismay of the governor of the T\u00e1chira region, General Esp\u00edritu Santo Morales. Castro defeated government forces in Capacho Viejo and in Rubio. Promoted to general, himself, Castro began to stand out in the internal politics of T\u00e1chira state. It was during the burial of a fellow fighter, Evaristo Jaimes, who had been killed in the earlier fighting that Castro met Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez, his future companion in his rise to power. He entered politics and became the governor of his province of T\u00e1chira but was exiled to Colombia when the government in Caracas was overthrown in 1892. Castro lived in Colombia for seven years, amassing a fortune in illegal cattle trading and recruiting a private army. ==Presidency== Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez and Cipriano Castro Amassing considerable support from disaffected Venezuelans, Castro's once personal army developed into a strong national army, and he used it to march on Caracas in October 1899 in an event called the Revoluci\u00f3n Liberal Restauradora, and seize power, installing himself as the supreme military commander. Once in charge, Castro inaugurated a period of plunder and political disorder having assumed the vacant presidency, after modifying the constitution (1904). He remained president for the period 1899\u20131908, designating Juan Vicente Gomez his \"compadre\" as vice-president. Castro's rule was marked by frequent rebellions, the murder or exile of his opponents, his own extravagant living, and trouble with other nations. Castro was characterized as \"a crazy brute\" by United States secretary of state Elihu Root and as \"probably the worst of Venezuela's many dictators\" by historian Edwin Lieuwen. His nine years of despotic and dissolute rule are best known for having provoked numerous foreign interventions, including blockades and bombardments by Dutch, British, German, and Italian naval units seeking to enforce the claims of their citizens against Castro's government. ===Venezuela Crisis of 1901\u20131903=== In 1901 the banker Manuel Antonio Matos was the leader of the Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora,Amaro Arias, Alberto 2000:Historia de la Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela a major military movement with the intention to overthrow Cipriano Castro's government.Liway Rodriguez, Gilberto 2000: Nueva Historia de Venezuela Severe disagreements between Castro and the foreign economic elite that support the revolution (as New York and Bermudez Company, Orinoco Shipping Company, Krupp, French Cable, and others) evolved into an open war that shook the country and brought the government to the brink of collapse. On 2 April 1902, in response to rising political tension between the Netherlands and Venezuela to evacuate the Jews of Coro to Cura\u00e7ao, the and the arrived in the Venezuelan port of La Guaira. Prior to their arrival, the Venezuelan Navy had repeatedly checked Dutch and Antillean merchant ships and the presence of the Dutch warships acted as a deterrent against further actions. Caricature of Cipriano Castro, by William Allen Rogers, published in the New York Herald, January 1903 In November 1902, the troops at command of Castro himself broke the Siege of La Victoria, weakened the vast network of revolutionaries armies and its extraordinary power. Few weeks after that, Venezuela saw a naval blockade of several months imposed by Britain, Germany and Italy over Castro's refusal to pay foreign debts and damages suffered by European citizens in a recent Venezuelan civil war. Castro assumed that the Monroe Doctrine would see the United States prevent European military intervention, but at the time the government of president Theodore Roosevelt saw the Doctrine\"Gunboats, Corruption, and Claims: Foreign Intervention in Venezuela, 1899-1908\" by Brian Stuart McBeth as concerning European seizure of territory, rather than intervention per se. With prior promises that no such seizure would occur, the US allowed the action to go ahead without objection. The blockade saw Venezuela's small navy quickly disabled, but Castro refused to give in, and instead agreed in principle to submit some of the claims to international arbitration, which he had previously rejected. Germany initially objected to this, particularly as it felt some claims should be accepted by Venezuela without arbitration. Cipriano Castro and his war cabinet in 1902 When the world press reacted negatively to incidents including the sinking of two Venezuelan ships and the bombardment of the coast, the U.S pressured the parties to settle, and drew attention to its nearby naval fleet in Puerto Rico at command of Admiral George Dewey. With Castro failing to back down, Roosevelt pressure and increasingly negative British and American press reaction to the affair, the blockading nations agreed to a compromise, but maintained the blockade during negotiations over the details. This led to the signing in Washington of an agreement on 13 February 1903 which saw the blockade lifted, and Venezuela represented by U.S. ambassador Herbert W. Bowen commit 30% of its customs duties to settling claims. When an arbitral tribunal subsequently awarded preferential treatment to the blockading powers against the claims of other nations, the U.S feared this would encourage future European intervention. The episode contributed to the development of the Roosevelt Corollary to Monroe Doctrine, asserting a right of the United States to intervene to \"stabilize\" the economic affairs of small states in the Caribbean and Central America if they were unable to pay their international debts, in order to preclude European intervention to do so. The revolutionaries, being a wound that could not be recovered, succumbing finally in July 1903 in the Battle of Ciudad Bolivar after the siege of government army conducted by General Gomez, with which Matos decides to leave Venezuela, establishing itself in Paris. ===Dutch\u2013Venezuelan crisis=== Castro at Ellis Island during his exile, 1913 In 1908, a dispute broke out between the Netherlands and president Castro regime on the grounds of the harboring of refugees in Cura\u00e7ao. Venezuela expelled the Dutch ambassador, prompting a Dutch dispatch of three warships \u2013 a coastal battleship, the , and two protected cruisers, the and the . The Dutch warships had orders to intercept every ship that was sailing under the Venezuelan flag. On 12 December 1908, the Gelderland captured the Venezuelan gunboat Alix off Puerto Cabello. She and another ship the 23 de Mayo were interned in the harbor of Willemstad. With their overwhelming naval superiority, the Dutch enforced a blockade on Venezuela's ports. === Castro's overthrow in 1908, exile and death in 1924 === Few days later, Castro, who had been seriously ill for four years due to a kidney problem,William M. Sullivan, \"The Harassed Exile: General Cipriano Castro, 1908\u20131924\", The Americas Vol. 33, No. 2 (Oct. 1976), pp. 282\u2013297 left for Paris to seek medical treatment for syphilis, leaving the government in the hands of vice president Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez, the man who was instrumental in his victories of 1899 and 1903. However, on 19 December 1908, G\u00f3mez with the support of the U.S. Navy seized power himself and effectively ended the war with the Netherlands. A few days later, General Castro left for Berlin, nominally for a surgical operation. After that Castro suffered the harassment of the European powers resentful by the policy that maintained towards them during the 8 years as president of Venezuela. Without resources to carry out an armed invasion, he went to Madrid and then recovered from his operation in Paris and in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. At the end of 1912 Castro intended to spend a season in the United States, but was captured and vexed by the immigration authorities of Ellis Island which forced him to leave in peremptory terms (February, 1913). He finally settled with his wife in Puerto Rico (1916), under close surveillance by spies sent by Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez, who assumed the Venezuelan presidency in the longest dictatorship in the hitherto Latin America history. Castro spent the rest of his life in exile in Puerto Rico, making several plots to return to power \u2014 none of which were successful. Castro died 4 December 1924, in Santurce, Puerto Rico. == Cipriano Castro cabinet (1899\u20131908) == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !bgcolor=\"#dcdcdc\" colspan=3|Ministries\u201cGaceta Oficial de Venezuela\u201d Period 1899\u20131908 |- |align=\"left\"|OFFICE||align=\"left\"|NAME||align=\"left\"|TERM |- !bgcolor=\"black\" colspan=3| |- |align=\"left\"|President||align=\"left\"|Cipriano Castro||align=\"left\"|1899\u20131908 |- |align=\"left\"|Home Affairs||align=\"left\"|Juan Francisco Castillo||align=\"left\"|1899\u20131900 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Rafael Cabrera Malo||align=\"left\"|1900\u20131901 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Jos\u00e9 Antonio Velutini||align=\"left\"|1901\u20131902 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Rafael L\u00f3pez Baralt||align=\"left\"|1902\u20131903 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Leopoldo Baptista||align=\"left\"|1903\u20131907 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Julio Torres C\u00e1rdenas||align=\"left\"|1907 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Rafael L\u00f3pez Baralt||align=\"left\"|1907\u20131908 |- !bgcolor=\"black\" colspan=3| |- |align=\"left\"|Outer Relations||align=\"left\"|Raimundo Andueza Palacio||align=\"left\"|1899\u20131900 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Eduardo Blanco||align=\"left\"|1900\u20131901 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Jacinto Regino Pachano||align=\"left\"|1901\u20131902 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Diego Bautista Ferrer||align=\"left\"|1902\u20131903 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Alejandro Urbaneja||align=\"left\"|1903 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Gustavo Sanabria||align=\"left\"|1903\u20131905 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Alejandro Ibarra||align=\"left\"|1905\u20131906 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas Pa\u00fal||align=\"left\"|1906\u20131908 |- |align=\"left\"|Finance||align=\"left\"|Ram\u00f3n Tello Mendoza||align=\"left\"|1899\u20131903 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Jos\u00e9 Cecilio De Castro||align=\"left\"|1903\u20131906 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Francisco de Sales P\u00e9rez||align=\"left\"|1906 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Gustavo Sanabria||align=\"left\"|1906 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Eduardo Celis||align=\"left\"|1906\u20131907 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Arnaldo Morales||align=\"left\"|1906\u20131907 |- |align=\"left\"|War and Navy||align=\"left\"|Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Pulido||align=\"left\"|1899\u20131902 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Ram\u00f3n Guerra||align=\"left\"|1902\u20131903 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda G\u00f3mez||align=\"left\"|1903 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Manuel Salvador Araujo||align=\"left\"|1903\u20131904 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Joaqu\u00edn Garrido||align=\"left\"|1904\u20131905 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda G\u00f3mez||align=\"left\"|1905\u20131906 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Diego Bautista Ferrer||align=\"left\"|1906 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Manuel Salvador Araujo||align=\"left\"|1906\u20131907 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Diego Bautista Ferrer||align=\"left\"|1907\u20131908 |- |align=\"left\"|Development||align=\"left\"|Jos\u00e9 Manuel Hern\u00e1ndez||align=\"left\"|1899 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Celestino Peraza||align=\"left\"|1899 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Guillermo Tell Villegas Pulido||align=\"left\"|1899\u20131900 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Ram\u00f3n Ayala||align=\"left\"|1900\u20131901 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Felipe Arocha Gallegos||align=\"left\"|1901\u20131902 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Arnaldo Morales||align=\"left\"|1902\u20131903 |- |align=\"left\"| ||align=\"left\"|Jos\u00e9 T.
