Her father was John Lamont, a stationer and printer. She went to London to train as a miniaturist, upon completing this training she returned to Belfast. She established herself as a professional artist by 1837. During her career in Belfast, Lamont lived at a number of addresses and lived alternately with her brothers, John, watchmaker and optician, and Dr Aeneas Lamont, surgeon. She opened a boarding and day school with a Miss Rock in 1851. The prospectus of which outlined that Lamont as an experienced tutor, with experience in England, France, and Germany. However, her involvement with the school had ceased by 1856. Lamont moved to an address on Clare St, Dublin in 1857, living there until 1859.
