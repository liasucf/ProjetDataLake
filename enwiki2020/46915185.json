Along with her colleagues she edited a book entitled \u201cRandomized Clinical Trials of Nonpharmacological Treatments.\u201d She also investigates the distorted dissemination of research finding through publication bias, selective reporting of outcomes and spin defined as a distorted interpretation of research findings. Boutron has demonstrated the high prevalence of such distortion in the published scientific literature and shown how the biased presentation, and interpretation of research results may bias the interpretation of readers, which is a critically important aspect of the knowledge translation process. Boutron has published more than 100 peer- reviewed articles, with 5 highly cited (i.e.top 1%) articles as first or second author.
