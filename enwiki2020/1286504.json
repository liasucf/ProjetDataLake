    "text": "King Edward VI Five Ways (KEFW) is a co-educational state grammar school for ages 11\u201318 in Bartley Green, in Birmingham, England. One of the seven establishments of the Foundation of the Schools of King Edward VI, it is a voluntary aided school, with admission by selective examination. The name was retained when it moved from its previous location at Five Ways, at the western edge of Birmingham city centre, in 1958. ==Background== It was first in the school league tables in 2007. Currently the school has around 1000 pupils in attendance amongst the lower school (years 7-11) and over 100 staff, some of whom are former pupils, as well as around 300 in the school's sixth form. The school is unique amongst the King Edward VI Foundation, being the only fully co-educational one. The school scored \"outstanding\" in every category with Ofsted report in November 2008. The school is Voluntary Aided. Parents are asked to make a voluntary contribution each year of around \u00a330 per pupil to provide extras and benefits for all school pupils throughout the year. The school uses some unusual terminology, matching that of other Foundation schools, such as naming site managers or caretakers \"porters\" and homework \"private study\" or \"HIPPO\", though not all teachers employ these terms. The school is much over-subscribed, the ninth in the country, according to The Times, with 10.6 candidates competing for 1 place. == History == A 19th century photograph of the school when it was at Five Ways island. Established as a boys' school in 1883, part of the King Edward VI Foundation, the school's original building was that of the former Edgbaston Proprietary School, on Hagley Road at its junction with Ladywood Road, at Five Ways, approximately 1 mile south-west of Birmingham city centre. The school, designed by J.A. Chatwin was opened on 16 January 1883 by A. J. Mundella with provision for 350 boys the Headmaster being E.H.F. MacCarthy, formerly a master at the main King Edward's School. He remained in the post until retirement in 1916, and now has a building named after him at the Bartley Green site. Originally the school educated only up to age 16, Fifth Form, and to go to Oxbridge a pupil had to transfer to the main King Edward's School, at the time in New Street. However, MacCarthy's successor, Mr Barker, introduced a Sixth Form. During the Second World War, the Headmaster at the time, Mr Dobinson, decided to evacuate the school to Monmouth, and the boys attended Monmouth School, the two staffs sharing the teaching. This meant that all the staff and pupils were lodged in the town, and could only keep in contact with family via correspondence; Mr Dobinson was able occasionally to visit Birmingham. After the war the school was becoming overcrowded, but due to development around the school there was no opportunity to expand, so a new site was found. On 23 April 1958 the school opened at its current home in Bartley Green, a suburb on the extreme south- west of Birmingham. The new school was built on the site of the Bartley Farm, which had been purchased by the Foundation, next to Bartley Reservoir. The site was elevated, and in the winter a bleak place. The relocation was not universally popular. The school Debating Society passed a motion regretting the move. Staff were concerned about the effect the relocation to such a distant suburb would have on the school's intake, which because of the central position had been drawn from the whole city; many boys who had joined the school at Five Ways, easily reached from all parts of the city, suddenly had considerably longer journeys to its new remote location. This undoubtedly affected admissions in later years. Then the school's corridors were considered too narrow, and whilst the playing fields were extensive the school buildings themselves were small and rather basic, with limited common areas. The time since 1958 has seen the development of much improved facilities, largely due to Arminio, however. Buildings new to the Bartley Green site include the Eyles and Chowen Centres, the former and current home of the school's Sixth Form. A music block and technology block have been added, as well as a Sports Hall and the MacCarthy Block. There has also been the expansion of the Science Wing, and increased seating capacity in the hall with an annex and balcony, as well as the Fitness Suite and extension to the art rooms in the MacCarthy Block. In recent years, a sports pavilion, a new astro turf playing field, a mobile classroom, a languages centre, and an Observatory have been built. The Eyles building has been renovated into the Eyles-Music Block, to replace the old Music block, which had become too small. It itself has also been renovated into a large computer suite and staff offices. Five Ways was one of the first schools in the West Midlands to introduce computer technology in 1978. This was achieved with a communications link to use computing facilities at Aston University. Girls have been admitted to Five Ways since 1988, first in the Sixth Form, then in the main school ten years later. Today Five Ways is the largest co-educational grammar school in the West Midlands, and one of the top five co-ed grammar schools nationally. ===Headteachers=== The school has had 11 Headmasters and 1 Headmistress in its history. #Revd Egerton Francis Mead MacCarthy 1883 - 1916 #Arthur Ernest Barker 1916 - 1933 #Charles Henry Dobinson 1933 - 1945 #Harry Robert Roach 1946 - 1951 #Thomas Charles Burgess 1951 - 1963 (Oversaw move to Bartley Green; died in post) #Roland Mathias 1964 - 1969 #Peter Rodney Watkins 1969 - 1974 #Geoffrey Sanders 1974 - 1991 #Revd John G. Knowles 1991 - 1999 #Peter Limm 1999 - 2002 #David Wheeldon 2002 \u2013 2012 #Yvonne Wilkinson 2012 \u2013 2020 Yvonne Wilkinson was Acting Headmistress from September to December 2002, the first Headmistress in the school's history, although as she served in, an acting capacity, for only one term, it was not properly a Headmistressship. She returned as the first actual headmistress from the start of the 2012\u20132013 school year, after a headship at Gateways School, Leeds. ==Entry== Pupils must pass an 11-plus entrance exam to get into the school. The King Edward Schools are academic powerhouses and therefore fiercely competitive to get admission. The entrance examination is tough and only 1 in 10 is successful. The King Edward VI Foundation holds its exams at the same time, and generally a candidate will sit one exam for multiple schools within the foundation. Formerly 155 were selected from each year, from more than 1,500 candidates; with a few more accepted every year on appeal. From September 2014 the school increased its intake to 180 pupils in Year 7. A pupil has the opportunity to list the Foundation schools that he or she prefers, and depending on the results, may get allocated into one of the schools. Students can also enter the school at sixth form level, though they do not have to take a test for this. Instead, places are awarded based on GCSE grades, requiring at least a 7 in any subject you wish to take, 8 in Maths to take Further Maths, and a 6 in English and Maths if they do not already form part of your offer. Again, at this level places are highly competitive with students applying from all over Birmingham and the surrounding areas. There are approximately 50 external candidates in each year. Pupils studying at the school in the lower years must get an additional four 7s (or five 8s if they wish to take four A-levels). The Sixth Form has approximately 210 students in each L6 and U6. == Academic stature == === Subjects offered === At GCSE, students are obliged to choose at least one humanities subject between History and Geography, at least one foreign language (options include French, German, Latin and Spanish), and other traditional subjects such as Biology, Chemistry and Physics (can be separated into either Combined or Triple/Single Science), Maths, English Language, English Literature and Religious Studies. Other options include: Music, Art, Drama, Food Preparation and Nutrition, Design and Technology, Physical Education, Computer Science and OSLA (Outdoor Skills Leadership and Adventure) which is a school funded option and does not count as a GCSE but does provide awards including the Climbing NICAS Award, the BCU Star Awards, Advanced First Aid Qualifications and the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Award. Previously, four subjects were picked at AS Level. However, from 2017 students are now expected to choose three subjects to complete at A Level and to complete an Extended Project Qualification. Options exclusive to A Level studies are: Economics, Government & Politics, Classical Civilisation, Sport Studies, Psychology and Philosophy as well as courses from down the school. There is also a Further Maths option, which enables a candidate to take two A Levels, one in Mathematics, one in Further Maths, over the two years. From 2013, the school no longer offers IB courses. Candidates taking four A-levels are not allowed to complete an Extended Project Qualification. The International Baccalaureate took its first cohort of students in 2011. For the first 2-year course a variety of SL and HL subjects have been offered along with TOK (Theory of Knowledge). Subjects World Literature and Mathematics are compulsory but are at SL and HL. One subject from Biology, Chemistry or Physics must be chosen at SL or HL. One subject from History, Geography or Economics must be chosen at SL or HL. One subject from French, Spanish, German (and hopefully in the future Mandarin and Latin) at ab initio [from scratch] level, SL or HL. One more option is fulfilled by a science, humanities or foreign language option or the choice of Visual Arts at SL or HL. In March 2013 prospective students were informed that the International Baccalaureate will no longer be offered due to lack of interest and applications from internal Year 11 students who wished to stay on the next year, and timetable and staffing constraints. The school now offers the English Baccalaureate (Ebacc) which is a nationwide GCSE achievement. It is not a certificated award but proves the student is well-educated and provides the student with a basis for A level study and will support an application to university. ==Extra- Curricular Activities== ===In-School Activities=== The school offers a wide variety of extra-curricular activities that include categories like: Sports, Music, Debating, Outdoor Education and many more. The clubs were designed to help pupils make friends and communicate with each other more often. They also serve as a relaxing time for pupils during or after a tiring school day. ===Competitions=== Some of these extra-curricular activities can lead to opportunities to enter competitions. In addition, there are many sporting fixtures that take place against schools in the local area and nationally. These include rugby, cricket, hockey, netball and rounders. ==International links== {| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"380\"|School !width=\"120\"|City |- |Tanzania: Babati Day Secondary School || Babati |- |China: The English School || Guangzhou |- |Japan: Okazaki High School || Okazaki, Aichi |- |India: King Edward Public School (Mahilpur)|King Edward Public School || Mahilpur |- |New Zealand: Christchurch Boys' High School || Christchurch |- |South Africa: Afri-Twin Link || Cape Town |- |France: St Just School || Lyon |- |USA: EDGE partnership link with group of schools in Chicago || Chicago |- |Iceland: Brekkuskoli School || Akureyri |} == Five Ways Old Edwardians == Notable alumni include: * Richard Adams (Traidcraft) - Fair Trade pioneer * Arun Arora - Anglican priest and former Director of Communications of the Church of England * Kate Ashfield - actress * Prof Michael Beesley CBE, Professor of Economics from 1965\u201390 at the London Business School * Peter Bennett, 1st Baron Bennett of Edgbaston OBE, Conservative MP from 1940\u201353 for Birmingham Edgbaston and President from 1955-57 of the British Productivity Council * Jon Burgerman - artist * Prof Sir David Cannadine - historian * Sir Michael Checkland - former Director General from 1987-92 of the BBC, Chairman from 1997-2001 of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) * Tom Butler - Bishop of Southwark * Jodie Cook, entrepreneur * John Copley, opera director * Sir Guy Dain, Chairman from 1942-48 of the British Medical Association (BMA) * Nigel Dakin - CMG, Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands, career Diplomat and soldier. * Oscar Deutsch - founder of Odeon Cinemas * Keith Fielding - international Rugby Union and Rugby League player * Geoffrey Filkin, Baron Filkin CBE, Chief Executive from 1988\u201391 of Reading Borough Council, former husband of Elizabeth Filkin * Daniel Fox (field hockey) - Olympic field hockey player * Anisa Haghdadi - social entrepreneur * Charles Hare - tennis player - represented Great Britain in the 1937 Davis Cup * Geoffrey Jones (academic) - Professor at the Harvard Business School and business historian * John Kenneally V.C.
