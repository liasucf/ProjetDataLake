Warkworth is named after Warkworth, Northumberland. ==Geography== Burnley Creek flows through the town. == Facilities/services == The village features the historic Town Hall, now the Centre for the Arts.

Kelly is located just outside the village centre. A medium-security federal penitentiary, the Warkworth Institution, is located 8 km east of the village but is in Brighton township and is not technically in Warkworth but Brighton township land \"Warkworth village just gets the honor of the name .. The Warkworth prison, opened in 1967, lies just inside the Brighton border and is a major financial contributor to the municipality. The federal prison does not technically pay property taxes, but the government gives the amount in a grant to the municipality. The Warkworth Institution gives Brighton $602,000 each year, which is almost 16 per cent of the municipality's budget. The jail also gives Northumberland County a grant of $168,500. * source https://www.northumberlandnews.com/news-story/3756812-warkworth-prison-could- close/ == Events == Warkworth hosts many events, including the annual Maple Syrup Festival in March, the Perfect Pie Contest in November, Lilac Festival in May, the Percy Agricultural Fall Fair in September, the Donnybrook auction in June, studio, house and garden tours, Junk in the Trunk and Warkworth Music Fest in July, Eat in the Park in August, and Warkworth under the Stars in December.http://www.warkworth.ca/annual-events/longlunch/ The Warkworth hockey team has won 11 provincial titles, most recently in 1993\u20131994. == Notable residents == * Derek Lynch, race car driver * Tom McCamus, actor ==Twin city== *Warkworth, New Zealand == References == == Further reading == * * == External links == * Warkworth.ca Warkworth Business Association * Municipality of Trent Hills Official site * Trent Hills & District Chamber of Commerce Category:Communities in Northumberland County, Ontario Category:1857 establishments in Canada ",
