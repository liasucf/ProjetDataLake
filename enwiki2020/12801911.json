Alcock-White is known for her oil paintings depicting water, myths, philosophy, and the British Columbia Coast. Her work has been described as a \"passionate collection of paintings that explore rebirth, identity, history, and humanity's origins.\" Her work is \"characterized by an elegant balance between mythical and realistic imagery. The tightly woven, reflective waters of her canvases are overlaid with figurative narratives and the result is a body of work that is both beautiful and, at times, haunting.\"Yee, Jeen(2012)Gallery Curator. Water Born Her style has also been described as a, \"combination of representationalism, realism; naturalism, and takes the form of illustrational depictions of happiness using stylized, personal exaggerations and distortions. It is Post-Surrealism! Her technical virtuosity more than adequately presents her perception and cognition of an ideal romantic world in which she is both instigator and willing participant.\"Burton, Dennis (2004).

In a 2016 curatorial essay Laura Schneider wrote, \"Alcock-White\u2019s work uses water almost exclusively as a metaphorical backdrop for human experience. It is a thematic device through which the artist articulates her personal and spiritual journey and explores her relationships with place, family and the environment. Water is the universal bond, connecting us with ourselves, each other and the natural world in the artist\u2019s images of hope for transformation and renewal.\" Alcock-White has appeared on CBC National RadioCBC National Radio (2004).
