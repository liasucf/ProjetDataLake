    "text": "Marion Frank Rudy (24 January 1925 \u2013 13 December 2009) was the aeronautical engineer who patented a cushioning system based on an inert gas encapsulated in polyurethane plastic. It was trademarked by Nike as the \"Air\" sole. He was a member of Case Western Reserve University's class of 1950, and a graduate of Fairview High School, in Fairview Park, Ohio. He was also a member of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. The 19 varsity athletic teams at his alma mater, Case Western Reserve Spartans, wear a special patch on their uniforms commemorating him and his invention. The emblem has Rudy's initials, MFR, with a 3D design of special texture and shine to resemble inflated air sole look, and has orbiting planets pay tribute to his career as an aerospace engineer. Rudy died in his home in California on December 13, 2009. He was 84 years old.oregonlive.com.
