    "text": "The second season of the Tokyo Ghoul anime series, titled Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA, is a direct sequel to the first season of the anime, picking up right where the final episode left off. The series is produced by Pierrot, and directed by Shuhei Morita. The anime aired from January 9, 2015 to March 27, 2015 on Tokyo MX, TVO, TVA, TVQ, MRO, BS Dlife and CS AT-X. The season roughly adapts the second half of the Tokyo Ghoul manga. Unlike the first season, however, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA does not directly adapt everything from the manga. Rather, it mixes in the manga's events and overall plotline with an anime original story written by the manga author Sui Ishida. The anime follows Ken Kaneki after he joins Aogiri Tree, as the group begins their battle against the CCG, who are trying to exterminate the ghoul organization. The score is composed by Yutaka Yamada, who also produced the score for the first season. The opening theme for the anime is by \u00f6sterreich, and the ending theme is by amazarashi. TC Entertainment released the series in Japan onto six volumes from March 27, 2015 to August 28, 2015. A complete set containing all twelve episodes was later released on September 30, 2016.
