    "text": "The Communists Party (, PdelosC) is a communist party in Mexico. Officially created in 2003 when the Mexican Communists' Party () and the Socialist Revolution Party (, PRS) merged. Not to be confused with the historical and now extinct Mexican Communist Party (, PCM) and other present communist organisations. As one of its major characteristics, the party proposes the unification of all the organisations within the \u201cAbajo y a la izquierda\u201d (\u201cDownward Left\u201d) political spectrum. During the second National Congress of 2006, the party's Central Committee agreed to support and endorse the Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle as a formal adherent. It has been a strong ally of the Miners' movement in Pasta de Conchos, different struggles of indigenous peoples across the Mexican republic's territory and anticapitalist environmental efforts. In present, the Communists' Party refuses to register in the National Electoral Institute (), since the party's thesis deny any possibility of a deep anticapitalist transformation through the current official institutions. ==Secretaries General of the Communists' Party== *2003-2006 Sergio Almaguer Cosio *Currently Fernando Acosta Esquivel ==External links== *Official Site Category:Communist parties in Mexico Category:Far-left politics in Mexico Category:Political parties in Mexico Category:Political parties with year of establishment missing ",
