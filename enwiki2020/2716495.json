    "text": "Santiago 'Santi' Ezquerro Mar\u00edn (born 14 December 1976) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a forward. Having made a name for himself at Athletic Bilbao, appearing in nearly 300 official games for the club in seven years, he subsequently earned himself a transfer to Barcelona, but failed to establish himself in three years, being used sparingly. Over 13 seasons in La Liga, Ezquerro amassed totals of 278 matches and 55 goals. ==Club career== ===Osasuna / Atl\u00e9tico=== Born in Calahorra, La Rioja, Ezquerro emerged through the youth ranks of CA Osasuna, playing two second division seasons with the Navarrese before signing with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for the 1996\u201397 campaign. He made his La Liga debut on 21 September 1996 in a 3\u20130 away win against CD Logro\u00f1\u00e9s, but was mainly registered with the club's B-side during his spell. ===Athletic=== Lack of playing opportunities with the Colchoneros prompted a January 1998 move to RCD Mallorca, which Ezquerro helped achieve runner-up accolades in the Copa del Rey in his six-month stint. Subsequently, he joined Athletic Bilbao, with whom he appeared in his first UEFA Champions League games while establishing as one of the most promising forwards in Spain's top flight, notably scoring in a 3\u20130 derby home victory over Real Sociedad on 9 April 2005. His stellar form in 2004\u201305 \u2013 47 official matches, 19 goals, including a hat-trick in a 7\u20131 away rout of Standard Li\u00e8ge for the season's UEFA Cup group stage\u2013 led to Ezquerro signing for FC Barcelona in a period of 3+1 years, on a free transfer. ===Barcelona=== Ezquerro was never able to establish himself in Barcelona's first team, his progress at the club being further hindered after the emergence of youth graduate Lionel Messi. His best league output consisted of 12 games in his first year (two goals, three starts, in 469 minutes of play). In 2007\u201308, Ezquerro was not given the free transfer by the Catalans and, not being signed by any team in the summer on in the January transfer window, was virtually absent for the duration of the campaign, although he did score twice in January against lowly CD Alcoyano for the domestic cup's round of 32, in a 2\u20132 second leg home draw and 5\u20132 on aggregate. ===Osasuna return / Retirement=== In July 2008, Ezquerro was released by Bar\u00e7a and, late in the month, rejoined Osasuna in a 2+1-years deal. During his first season after his return he struggled with injuries and also failed to fit newly appointed coach Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho's plans, failing to make the squad of 18 in any of the team's final matches. Ezquerro was released after just one year \u2013 earning \u20ac1.4 million \u2013 and retired at 33, after not being able to find a new club in the following months. ==International career== During his debut season for Athletic, Ezquerro won his sole cap for Spain, in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifier against Cyprus, which ended with a 2\u20133 away loss and the sacking of coach Javier Clemente, on 5 September 1998. ==Honours== Mallorca *Copa del Rey runner-up: 1997\u201398 Barcelona *La Liga: 2005\u201306 *UEFA Champions League: 2005\u201306 *FIFA Club World Cup runner-up: 2006 *UEFA Super Cup runner-up: 2006 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:People from Calahorra Category:Spanish footballers Category:Riojan footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:CA Osasuna B players Category:CA Osasuna players Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid B players Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid footballers Category:RCD Mallorca players Category:Athletic Bilbao footballers Category:FC Barcelona players Category:UEFA Champions League winning players Category:Spain under-21 international footballers Category:Spain international footballers ",
