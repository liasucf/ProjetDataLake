She noted that Korean beauty culture has influenced many to believe that any woman, regardless of her height, is overweight when she goes over 50 kilograms (110 pounds). Kim also stated her opinion on how social media perpetuates these standards, stating: \u201cI personally feel like it\u2019s from immensely photo- edited images that we see on our social media,\u201d Kim explained. \u201cWe see celebrities showing off their weight, they say \u2018I weigh this much\u2019 and they look very pretty. We subconsciously start to think this is the ideal weight and the ideal body. I see a lot of girls who put a lot of effort into losing weight even though they don\u2019t have to.\u201d \u201cI wish me being on stage and onscreen can make young girls think that they\u2019re not fat at all weighing this weight,\u201d Kim shared. \u201cI wish it could also motivate other young girls to be confident in their bodies and accept the way they look. I want to set that healthy standard on stage for better body confidence.\u201d == Filmography == === Film, television and web series === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year !Film / Show / Web !Role !Notes !Ref. |- |2019 |Happy Together Ep.548 | \ud574\ud53c\ud22c\uac8c\ub354 |Herself |Guest | |} == Social Media == While at college, Kim Soo Min co-ran a foodie blog called FatSoo to introduce diverse food and dishes she found around Carlisle, Pennsylvania.
