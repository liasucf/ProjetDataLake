    "text": "The first lady of the Dominican Republic is the spouse of the president of the Dominican Republic. The position of first lady is not a politically-mandated office, and as such, the first lady of the Dominican Republic plays no official role in the decision making aspect of the government of the Dominican Republic. However, similar to many other spouses of heads of state and heads of government, the first lady of the Dominican Republic is an influential public figure who often contributes to philanthropic causes and acts as an unofficial representative for the head of state. The current first lady of the Dominican Republic is Raquel Arbaje, the wife of President Luis Abinader. == References == Dominican Republic ",
