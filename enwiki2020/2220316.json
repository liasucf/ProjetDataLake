He was a member of Gymnastiki Etaireia Patron, which merged with Panachaikos Gymnastikos Syllogos in 1923 to become Panachaiki Gymnastiki Enosi. One of the greatest swimmers Greece has even known, he won the silver medal in the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens. Before the Olympics, Pepanos was hesitating about taking part because he was already thirty years old and past his prime. Finally, even though he was suffering from a cold on the day of the event, he competed in the 500 metres freestyle. He finished second with a time of 9:57.6. The winner, Austrian Paul Neumann, had finished in 8:12.6. ==References== *The first version of this article has been based on the text of :el:\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 of the Greek Wikipedia published under GFDL. * (Digitally available at ) Category:1866 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Greek male swimmers Category:Olympic silver medalists for Greece Category:Olympic swimmers of Greece Category:Swimmers at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:19th-century sportsmen Category:People from Patras Category:Medalists at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medalists in swimming ",
