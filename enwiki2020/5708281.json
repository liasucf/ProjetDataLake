After being 3-1 down following goals by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala and Giampiero Boniperti, Alf Ramsey scored a last minute penalty to draw the game 4-4. On 25 November 1953, the Marvellous Magyars Hungary national football team, led by prolific forward Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, shocked football by defeating England 6\u20133 at Wembley Stadium. On 25 May 1954, England lost to Hungary again, in Budapest, suffering their heaviest defeat, 7-1. On the domestic scene, Wolverhampton Wanderers, managed by former player Stan Cullis, won the league title for the first time, while their local rivals West Bromwich Albion lifted the FA Cup for the fourth time. Albion had also finished second in the league behind Wolves, while defending champions Arsenal slipped to 12th this season. Liverpool, the first postwar champions of the English league, were relegated to the Second Division in bottom place. Everton were promoted to the First Division after three seasons in the Second Division and have not been relegated since. Twenty-one years after winning the Third Division South, Brentford are relegated to the Third Division South for the first time and do not return to the second tier until 1992. In addition to the success of Midlands teams in the top division, Port Vale won Third Division North by 11 points, going unbeaten at home and conceding a record low of 21 goals. They also became the first Third Division side since the war to reach the semi- final of the FA Cup, losing to West Bromwich Albion. Sam Bartram of Charlton Athletic set a League record on 6 March 1954 becoming the first player with 500 League appearances. ==Honours== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"width:15em\"|Competition!!style=\"width:15em\"|Winner!!style=\"width:15em\"|Runner- up |- |First Division||Wolverhampton Wanderers (1)||West Bromwich Albion |- |Second Division||Leicester City||Everton |- |Third Division North||Port Vale||Barnsley |- |Third Division South||Ipswich Town||Brighton & Hove Albion |- |FA Cup||West Bromwich Albion (4)||Preston North End |- |Charity Shield||Arsenal||Blackpool |- |Home Championship|||| |} Notes = Number in parentheses is the times that club has won that honour. * indicates new record for competition ==FA Cup== West Bromwich Albion defeated Preston North End 3\u20132 in the 1954 FA Cup Final to lift the FA Cup for the fourth time. ==Football League== ===First Division=== ===Second Division=== ===Third Division North=== ===Third Division South=== ===Top goalscorers=== First Division *Jimmy Glazzard (Huddersfield Town) \u2013 29 goals Second Division *John Charles (Leeds United) \u2013 42 goals Third Division North *Alan Ashman (Carlisle United) \u2013 30 goals Third Division South *Jack English (Northampton Town) \u2013 28 goals ==References== eng ",
