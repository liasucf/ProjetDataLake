Woodfill was unseated as chairman in Harris County in 2014 by Paul Simpson.

Candidates who sought the position were Travis County chairman James Dickey, Rick Figueroa of Brenham, and Mark Ramsey, a state committee member from Spring in Harris County. The 62-member State Republican Executive Committee and the vice chair narrowly chose Dickey to succeed Mechler. Dickey polled thirty-two votes to thirty-one for rival Rick Figueroa. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1956 births Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:People from Claude, Texas Category:People from Colfax County, New Mexico Category:People from Pampa, Texas Category:People from San Antonio Category:People from Navarro County, Texas Category:People from Wasilla, Alaska Category:People from Amarillo, Texas Category:Texas Republican state chairmen Category:Texas Republicans Category:American energy industry businesspeople Category:Texas A&M; University alumni Category:Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania alumni ",
