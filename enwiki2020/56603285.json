    "text": "Forest cover in general refers to the relative (in percent) or sure (in square kilometers/square miles) land area that is covered by forests. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, a forest is defined as land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. Global forest cover, however crucial for soil health, the water cycle, climate and air quality it is, is severely threatened by deforestation everywhere, as a direct consequence of agriculture, grazing, and mining. Forest cover can be increased by reforestation and afforestation efforts, but loss of old-growth forests is irreversible in terms of its ecological services. Since the onset of agriculture (about 12,000 years ago), the number of trees worldwide has dropped by 46%, according to one research published in 2018. Global forest cover now has been estimated to be just 30% or in 2006 with 12-yearly losses (2000-2012) amounting to and reforestation gains about . According to FAO's Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020, the world has a total forest area of 4.06 billion hectares (ha), which is 31 percent of the total land area. The world\u2019s total growing stock of trees decreased slightly, from 560 billion m3 in 1990 to 557 billion m3 in 2020, due to a net decrease in forest area. On the other hand, growing stock is increasing per unit area globally and in all regions; it rose from 132 m3 per ha in 1990 to 137 m3 per ha in 2020. Growing stock per unit area is highest in the tropical forests of South and Central America and West and Central Africa.
