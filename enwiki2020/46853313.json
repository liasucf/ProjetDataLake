    "text": "S\u00ed Beag, S\u00ed M\u00f3r, \"Small Fairy Mound, Big Fairy Mound\", is an Irish folk tune. The title uses the word 'S\u00ed', the Irish Gaelic for 'fairy mound'.Dictionary of the Irish Language: s\u00edd, s\u00edth ==Origins== The tune is usually attributed to blind harpist and singer Turlough O'Carolan (16701738) as his first song, written to the tune of \"The Bonnie Cuckoo\" (Roud 24351). One author describes it as a \"beautiful old Irish air, usually played simply and leisurely, and occasionally played as a waltz\". S\u00ed M\u00f3r (Sheemore) and S\u00ed Beag (Sheebeg) are the names given to two small hills, situated close to each other in south County Leitrim, said to be ancient burial sites, and to a site in Carolan's birth county of Meath. ==Recordings== In modern times the tune had been recorded by many artists, first by Planxty on their 1973 debut album Planxty, and then by The Chieftains on their 1975 album The Chieftains 5, as part of \"The Humours of Carolan\" suite. It has been performed live on numerous occasions by Fairport Convention, who also recorded it as the B-side for their 1987 single release of \"Meet on the Ledge\". Fairport Convention's fiddler Dave Swarbrick showcased the tune in his touring partnership with Simon Nicol. It is commonly played on the fiddle and is also a favourite of various fingerstyle guitarists, including Tony McManus and Pierre Bensusan. ==External links== * \"S\u00ed Beag, S\u00ed M\u00f3r\" scores on TheSession.org Retrieved 31 January 2016. * List of \"S\u00ed Bheag, S\u00ed Mh\u00f3r\" recordings on amazon.co.uk Retrieved 2 November 2016. * \"S\u00ed Bheag, S\u00ed Mh\u00f3r\" on irishtune.info Retrieved 2 November 2016. ==References== Category:Irish folk songs Category:Year of song unknown ",
