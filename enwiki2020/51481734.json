    "text": "Several ships have been named Cyrus: *Three ships of the Royal Navy have been named . * , was launched at Salem in 1792 or 1800 (records differ); The British captured her in 1803 and she became a whaler that made 17 whaling voyages between 1804 and 1853. She made one more mercantile voyage in 1854 and then disappears from Lloyd's Register. ** This Cyrus should not be confused with the American whaler, Cyrus, of Nantucket, which sailed during the same era. A bill of sale in the Nantucket Historical Association Research Library shows that a whaling vessel named Cyrus had several owners and was registered in London in 1916. Several sources speak of a Cyrus and an incident at Pitcairn, but some call it a London whaler and others an American whaler. However, testimony from the crew confirms this ship was sailing elsewhere under a different Captain. * On 23 December 1858 the brig Cyrus took shelter from a storm off Cape Flattery, Vancouver Island. She anchored in Port San Juan, but her anchor chain broke and she was driven ashore near the mouth of the Gordon river. * A Cyrus was wrecked at Hartlepool, England. 9 February 1861. ==References== Category:Ship names ",
