She was the daughter of Domhnall \u00d3 Donnchadha and his wife Alice (n\u00e9e Ferriter). She was descended from U\u00ed Dhonnchadha an Ghleanna (O'Donoghue of the Glens). Her branch of the family, who settled in a place called Anees in Glenflesk, used the suffix \"Dubh\". S\u00e9afraidh \u00d3 Donnchadha was her uncle and also a poet, known for hosting poets and scribes at Killaha castle, near Killarney. Around 1718, she married Domhnall M\u00f3r \u00d3 Conaill (died 1770), and she is believed to have overseen the construction of the family home, Derrynane House. The couple had 22 children, with four sons and eight daughters surviving to adulthood. Her son, Maurice O'Connell, inherited Derrynane House. Her most famous daughter is Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill a fellow poet. Oral tradition tells of M\u00e1ire N\u00ed Dhuibh's pride, determination and wittiness, with conjecture that her grandson, Daniel O'Connell, inherited her intellectual and orating abilities. She is believed to have died around 1795. ==References== Category:1700s births Category:1790s deaths Category:People from County Kerry Category:Irish women poets Category:18th-century Irish poets Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Date of death unknown ",
