    "text": "The Indian Coast Guard Academy (ICGA) is a training establishment for Indian Coast Guard (ICG) personnel, which is currently under construction in Mangalore, Karnataka . ==History== Indian Coast Guard personnel were historically trained at the Indian Naval Academy (INA). Following the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Indian government initiated a program to triple the ICG force, assets and infrastructure. Both the Navy and the government recognized that the increased intake of ICG cadets would further tax the already- stretched INA facilities. This provided an added impetus for the Union Council of Ministers to approve the establishment of the ICGA in 2009. The search for a site for the academy started in earnest in 2010. Various sites were considered for the academy, the primary criterion being ample space on the coastal waterfront. The Government of Kerala was keen to host the site in the state. Consequently, the then Minister for Industries and Commerce of Kerala, , prevailed upon the Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (KINFRA) to transfer some of its unutilized land in the coastal town of Azhikkal to the ICG for the academy. The transfer was completed on 24 February 2011. On 27 February, the then Defence Minister of India, A. K. Antony, announced the plans to start construction of the academy.http://www.india- defence.com/reports-5048http://in.news.yahoo.com/countrys-first-coast-guard- academy-come-kerala-20110227-052300-953.htmlThe foundation stone for the academy was laid on 28 May 2011. ICGA was planned to come up on a campus near Valapattanam estuary on the Arabian Sea in Irinavu near Azhikkal in Kannur district of northern Kerala. It is located about south of INA, Ezhimala, and the two maritime academies were expected to share some training infrastructure in the Kerala backwaters. But the project was dropped in 2019 following the denial of environment and CRZ (Coastal Regulation Zone) clearances by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) since the project site at Azhikkal fell within the CRZ-1(A) area where no construction is permissible. The academy was then shifted to Kenjar near Mangalore. 160 acres of land in possession of Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board has been allocated to the Indian Coast Guard to set up the academy. ==Campus== The Indian Coast Guard Academy will come up in 160 acres of land in Kenjar, near Mangalore. ==See also== * Indian National Defence University * Military Academies in India * Sainik school ==References== Category:Indian Coast Guard Category:Military academies of India Category:Coast guard academies ",
