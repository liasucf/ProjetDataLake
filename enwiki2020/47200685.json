The move from the east coast to the west coast would later inspire her second novel (her first under the Matson name), \"Amy and Roger's Epic Detour\". Halfway through Matson's degree in theatre she started working in the children's department of Vroman's Bookstore and decided to add English as a double major. Following college graduation, Matson moved back to New York to attend The New School where she received her M.F.A. in Writing for Children.
