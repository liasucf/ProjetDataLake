Born in 1970, Al-Harbash obtained a PhD in Islam and worked as a professor at Kuwait University teaching Islamic ideology before being elected to the National Assembly in 2006. ==Against Falcon Smuggling== On April 17, 2007, Al-Harbash and other MPs submitted documents to parliament claiming that several falcon shipments for \"influential people\" had been imported recently without proper testing. Kuwat banned bird imports as an avian influenza precaution, but the ban was eased since July 2006. Al-Harbash sees the smuggling as an example of corruption that puts the country at risk for bird flu: \"Lifting the ban on falcons was a catastrophe. Why were they exempted from the ban despite warnings by doctors?\" Al-Harbash says he will ask the parliament's health committee to study the situation and report back. Kuwait reported 20 birds, including 18 falcons, were tested positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of the bird flu on February 25 and so far the bird flu cases have reached to 132. In November 2005, Kuwait detected the first case of a bird infected with the H5N1 strain\u2014a flamingo at a seaside villa. ==Protested Against Israeli Attacks== On December 28, 2008, Kuwaiti lawmakers Mikhled Al-Azmi, Musallam Al-Barrak, Marzouq Al-Ghanim, Jaaman Al-Harbash, Ahmad Al-Mulaifi, Mohammad Hayef Al-Mutairi, Ahmad Al-Saadoun, Nasser Al-Sane, and Waleed Al-Tabtabaie protested in front of the National Assembly building against the attacks by Israel on Gaza. Protesters waved banners reading, \"No to hunger, no to submission\" Israel launched air strikes against Hamas in the Gaza Strip on December 26 after a six-month ceasefire ended on December 18. ==References== Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the National Assembly of Kuwait Category:Kuwait University faculty Category:Kuwait University alumni Category:Hadas politicians Category:Kuwaiti Muslim Brotherhood members ",
