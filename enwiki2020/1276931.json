Located at the wedge-shaped waterfront reclaimed land west of Tsim Sha Tsuithe district will feature a new museum of visual culture, numerous theatres, concert halls and other performance venues under the management of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, which is directly financed by the government with an upfront endowment of HK$21.6 billion for construction and operation.http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr07-08/chinese/fc/pwsc/papers/p08-31c.pdf The West Kowloon Cultural District is the largest arts and cultural project in Hong Kong to date. Comprising 40 hectares, the district will include 17 core arts and cultural venues as well as space for arts education. This includes a flagship museum of contemporary visual culture, M+ Museum, designed by TFP Farrells and Herzog & de Meuron. WKCD will be developed in two phases with construction having already commenced. Although the hardware has yet to be completed, the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority has started its software development. Its first culture event is the West Kowloon Bamboo Theatre at the future site of Xiqu Centre in 2012. \u201cMobile M+: Yau Ma Tei\u201d, a contemporary art exhibition is the second program held by the Authority, which is the first in a series of pre-opening \u201cnomadic\u201d exhibition curated by M+ before the completion of the museum building in 2017.http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr11-12/english/panels/wkcd/reports/wkcdcb2-2605-e.pdf WKCD Typhoon Shelter Entrance (September 2016) The early proposal of the project was overturned in 2006 due to doubts on financing models, criticism of property developer involvement, lack of planning, and criticism of the design by Foster and Partners that included an expensive canopy structure. Despite of pledge by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa to create a \"landmark cultural development project,\" the initial plan was criticized as too costly and lack of vision. The assessment panel, made up of senior civil servants only, was unrepresentative and unresponsive to the public. As the project returned to track in 2006, the Hong Kong government established the Consultative Committees to formulate a Recommendation Report to decide what facilities to offer and how they would be managed in the WKCD. In 2007, a three-month public consultation were being carried out again and the early stages were completed in December 2007 to decide what facilities to offer and how they would be managed.\u897f\u4e5d\u6587\u5316\u5340\u516c\u773e\u53c3\u8207\u6d3b\u52d5 The project was first proposed to attract tourists to Hong Kong, but the focus of discussion thereafter has turned to the benefits for the local residents, both intellectually and economically. In early 2011, it was expected that the first phase of the project will open from 2015, and the second phase from 2026.Sudden exit of arts hub chief may delay project, SCMP, Vivienne Chow, 8 Jan 2011 ==Introduction== The wedge-shaped development site is 40 hectares in area, lies within the Yau Tsim Mong District and is bounded by Canton Road in the east, the Western Harbour Crossing entrance and Austin Road West in the north, and Victoria Harbour in the west and south. == History == ===Origin=== In 1996, the Hong Kong Tourism Board took a survey of tourists visiting Hong Kong. The survey suggested that many of the tourists thought Hong Kong was lacking in cultural opportunities. The Hong Kong Tourism Board made a suggestion to Legco in 1998, proposing that new venues for art exhibitions and other cultural events be established. In the Chief Executive's Policy Address of 1998, Tung Chee Hwa proposed the establishment of the West Kowloon Cultural District, hoping to develop Hong Kong as the hub for Culture and Art of Asia. ===Design competition=== An international design competition was organised in April 2001Invitation For Proposals Development of West Kowloon Cultural District, Hong Kong to design the district and the ten- member judge panel selected the gigantic canopy design scheme submitted by Foster and Partners as the winner under eight aspects,WKR Concept Plan Competition which included \"skillful integration of complexes\", \"singularity of image\" and \"viability\".Leslie E. Robertson Associates were structural engineers for the concept design. However, the design was scrapped in 2005 due to intense public criticism. ===Invitation for proposal=== On 5 September 2003, the government announced an Invitation For Proposals for the Development of the district.Invitation For Proposals Development of West Kowloon Cultural District, Hong Kong While the government required provision of certain specified facilities, proponents were allowed considerable freedom in developing viable proposals \u2014 in the other words, the developers can sell residents and office space located in the lot for profit as long as they fulfil the government's requirements: Three theatres with at least 2,000, 800 and 400 seats respectively; A performance venue with at least 10,000 seats; A cluster of four museums at least 75,000 square metres in size; An art exhibition centre at least 10,000 square metres in size; A water amphitheatre; At least four piazzas; and A canopy covering at least 55% of the development area.Invitation For Proposals Development of West Kowloon Cultural District, Hong Kong Three proposals respectively submitted by Dynamic Star International Limited, Sunny Development Limited and World City Culture Park Limited were then consulted with the public from December 2004 to June 2005 in order to select the final proposal. Here are the shortlisted designs as presented during the six-month public consultation in 2005: Image:HKWKLN1.JPG|Norman Foster's original design Image:HKWKLN3.jpg|Dynamic Star International's design Image:West_Kowloon_Cutural_District_(World_City_Culture_Park_Project).jpg|Henderson Land's design Image:HKWKLN2.JPG|Yell Lin International's design ===First public consultation=== The Executive Summary of the consultation report showed the single-packaged development approach, the canopy, the government supervision and the concept of the project most concerned and discussed in the open questions on the consultation form. The report noted there was strong opposition to the single-packaged development approach and there was a fear that the WKCD project could evolve into an ordinary property development project. Over half of the written submissions were against the canopy. As the government renewed conditions for the development, the shortlisted proponents failed to renew their proposals and Chief Secretary Rafael Hui Si-yan said the much-criticised giant canopy \u2013 centrepiece of the winning design by architect Lord Foster \u2013 would be scrapped with the entire to start all new by a review of the basic facilities to be offered. ===Consultative committees=== The government appointed members to the Consultative Committee on the Core Arts and Cultural Facilities (CACF) of WKCD on 6 April 2006 and the committee was scheduled to last until June 2007. It re-examined and re-confirmed the need for the CACF for the WKCD as defined in the Invitation for Proposals issued in September 2003. ===Stage 1 Public Engagement Exercise=== Stage 1 Public Engagement Exercise was conducted between 8 October 2009 to 7 January 2010, lasting for three months. At this stage, the WKCDA held public forums and focus group meetings in order to understand the views and needs of the stakeholders and the public. Around 66 public engagement events were held.http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr11-12/english/panels/wkcd/papers/wkcd1129cb2-385-4-e.pdf ===Stage 2 Public Engagement Exercise=== Following the Stage 1 of the PE exercise, Stage 2 PE exercise involves gaining feedbacks from the public and various shareholders on the Conceptual Plans prepared by three master planning teams. These planning teams have incorporated public views they learnt in Stage 1 into their conceptual plans. The three conceptual plans were unveiled on 20 August 2010 by the WKCD Authority. *City Park \u2013 prepared by Foster + Partners, led by Lord Norman Foster; *Cultural Connect: Key to Sustained Vitality \u2013 prepared by Rocco Design Architects Limited, led by Mr Rocco Yim; and *Project for a New Dimension \u2013 prepared by Office for Metropolitan Architecture, led by Mr Rem Koolhaas.
