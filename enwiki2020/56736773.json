    "text": "Faygoluvers is a website originally dedicated to horrorcore music, and eventually included underground music as a whole. It was founded in 1999 initially to cover news relating to Insane Clown Posse and other similar artists. Over time, the website evolved to include the underground music community as a whole. They provide news articles, album reviews, music videos, free songs, filmed concerts, new interviews, upcoming events, and more. There is also featured content, such as the annual FLH Music Awards, the Unreleased Underground music archive, an Underground Spotlight section, a weekly podcast, and various other editorials. ==History== Faygoluvers was originally created by Ricky Winowiecki, a fan known as Faygoluver. It was initially created to follow the latest from the horrorcore rap duo Insane Clown Posse, and other associated acts from their record label Psychopathic Records, such as Twiztid, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Myzery, Psychopathic Rydas, and the then-upcoming supergroup Dark Lotus. Although originally containing only news articles, the site evolved to include more content, such as album reviews and free music. Over time, ownership of the website was switched over to another prominent figure known as ScottieD. Also, due to the increasing popularity of horrorcore music as a whole, more artists than just Insane Clown Posse started to be covered. This ranged from Tech N9ne of Strange Music, Kottonmouth Kings of Suburban Noize, and more. Although rap/hip-hop was still the main focus, other genres started to be covered as well, mainly rock/heavy metal. Due to many other websites offering news postings, Faygoluvers eventually started to include original content; thus, an entire archive of interviews, videos, reviews, songs, and more started to compile together. The website also has its hand in other ventures as well. The Faygoluvers Mixtapes was a continuous project released exclusively on the website using its namesake as a record label. The annual DCG Con includes a tsuro tournament hosted by Faygoluvers itself. Faygoluvers also provides hourly coverage at the Gathering of the Juggalos, and have made prominent appearances at other public events. In addition, every year since 2014, there is an awards ceremony highlighting the underground music scene, known as the FLH Music Awards, complete with its own voting system and uploaded ceremony. In popular culture, Faygoluvers is mentioned in the linear notes for Insane Clown Posse's 2002 album The Wraith: Shangri-La. They are also mentioned in the song \"Dot Com\" by Dark Lotus off their 2001 debut album Tales From the Lotus Pod. ==FLH Music Awards== Winners for each category are in italics. ===First Annual=== Album of the Year Dark Lotus - The Mud, Water, Air, and Blood Underground Album of the Year Scum - Grim Zipper EP of the Year Twiztid - Get Twiztid Tour of the Year Twiztid - \"This Way to Hell\" Tour Music Video of the Year Twiztid - Sick Man Mixtape of the Year Twiztid - 4 Tha Fam, Vol. 2 Metal Album of the Year KidKrusher - Metal Murder 3D Horrorcore Album of the Year Twisted Insane - The Last Demon Hip-Hop Album of the Year Rittz - Next to Nothing Collab Project of the Year Drive-By - RunTheseStreets Supergroup Album of the Year Dark Lotus - The Mud, Water, Air, and Blood ===Second Annual=== Album of the Year Twiztid - The Darkness Underground Album of the Year Young Wicked - Slaughter EP of the Year Insane Clown Posse - The Phantom Tour of the Year Twiztid - \"Welcome to the Underground\" Tour Music Video of the Year Twiztid - F.T.S.
