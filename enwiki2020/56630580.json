    "text": "Xocia's Dance is the thirteenth studio album by American hard bop tenor saxophonist Harold Land as band leader. The album was initially released in 1981 via Muse Records label and re-released on CD in 1990. ==Reception== Stephen Cook of Allmusic wrote \"Maybe best known for his 1959 Contemporary album The Fox, tenor saxophonist Harold Land spent the '50s and '60s rebuking the stereotype of the West Coast sound being all wafer-thin with his robust and intense work as both a solo artist and sideman. And while he slowed down a bit in the '70s, Land came roaring back with this exceptional effort from 1981. Both the playing and the songs are all top notch. To help out, Land enlists the fine talents of drummer Billy Higgins, vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, pianist George Cables, trumpeter Oscar Brashear, and bassist John Heard. Highly recommended.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Harold Land \u2013 saxophone *Oscar Brashear \u2013 trumpet *George Cables \u2013 piano *Billy Higgins \u2013 drums *Bobby Hutcherson \u2013 vibes (tracks 2 4 5) *John Heard \u2013 bass *Ray Armando \u2013 percussion ==References== Category:Muse Records albums Category:Harold Land albums Category:1981 albums ",
