    "text": "As one of the United States's more significant seaports, there is a long tradition of fireboats in Baltimore. When Baltimore added the diesel powered fireboat Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., in 1956, she joined a fleet of older steam-powered fireboats, some of which had been launched in the 19th century. She was Baltimore's first new fireboat in 35 years. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Some Baltimore fireboats |- ! image || name || introduced || retired || pumping capacity || notes |- | || Cataract || 1891 || ? ||4400|| The city's first fireboat. |- | 100px || Deluge || 1911 || ? || 12,000 ||Along with the FDNY fireboat New Yorker, which also was rated at 12,000, the Deluge was the most powerful fireboat afloat when it was built. |- | || Torrent || 1921 || ? || || Said to be similar to, but more powerful than the Deluge. |- | 100px || 'Mayor Thomas A'lessandro Jr' || 1957 || ? || 12,000 || The city's first diesel fireboat. |- | || Mayor J.
