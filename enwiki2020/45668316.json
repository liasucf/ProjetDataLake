    "text": "Summit cross The Gimpel is a peak in the Tannheim Mountains, a sub-range of the Allg\u00e4u Alps. It is 2,173 m high. The name is derived from the Gimpelalpe alp in der \"hollow\" (Mulde) (Celtic comba = English \"coombe\"). The Gimpel is made of Wetterstein limestone. == Location == The ar\u00eate of the Judenscharte links the Gimpel with the Rote Fl\u00fch; the Sch\u00e4fer (2,060 m), also called the \"Little Gimpel\" (kleiner Gimpel) with the Kellenspitze. == Alpinism == There are several climbing tours on the Gimpel, ranging from alpine, classic routes like the West Ar\u00eate (first climbed by J. Bachschmid and E. Christa in 1896, UIAA grade III+) to the top-sport climb of Primavera (first ascended by Baldo Pazzaglia in 1992, UIAA grade IX\u2212). Even the normal route up the South Face and the East Ar\u00eate is only possible by negotiating grade II sections.Dieter Seibert: Alpine Club Guide alpin - Allg\u00e4uer Alpen und Ammergauer Alpen. 17th edn., Bergverlag Rother, Munich, 2008, , p. 242. In 1990 Toni Freudig discovered a cave system in the South Face (the Gimpel Labyrinth). In 1999 the Gimpel was one of the first mountains in the Allg\u00e4u, whose most popular routes were fitted with climbing bolts after a three people in a roped team from Oy/Mittelberg were killed on the neighbouring Rote Fl\u00fch when the rope broke causing the team to fall. == Huts == * Tannheimer Hut (DAV) from Nesselw\u00e4ngle * Gimpelhaus (private) from Nesselw\u00e4ngle * Otto Mayr Hut (DAV) or F\u00fcssener Hut (private) from Musau * Schneetalalm (municipality of Wei\u00dfenbach) from H\u00f6fen * Gimpelalm (municipality of Nesselw\u00e4ngle) \u2013 mountain rescue base == References == == Literature == * Toni Freudig: Klettern auf der Tannheimer Sonnenseite.
