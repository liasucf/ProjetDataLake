    "text": "John Wolstenholme (1851 \u2013 1 February 1914) was a cricketer who played first- class cricket for Hawke's Bay from 1887 to 1898. In November 1892, Jack Wolstenholme was described by the Hawke's Bay Herald thus: \"has a good defence and splendid execution, and hits very hard when once set\", and a fast bowler \"with rather a low delivery\" who \"always gets wickets\". His highest first- class score was 103, in an innings victory over Taranaki in 1897-98. In Hawke's Bay's victory over Taranaki in 1891-92 he took 4 for 24 and 4 for 9. After his playing career ended, he umpired several of Hawke's Bay's home matches between 1899 and 1901. Wolstenholme served for many years as headmaster of the school at Port Ahuriri, Napier. After retiring from the position, he was the storekeeper at the small town of Ongaonga, in Central Hawke's Bay. In June 1906 he disappeared for several days before being found in Wellington living under an assumed name. He returned to Napier to live, working as a relieving teacher until his sudden death in February 1914. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1851 births Category:1914 deaths Category:People from Rishton Category:Hawke's Bay cricketers Category:New Zealand cricket umpires Category:English emigrants to New Zealand ",
