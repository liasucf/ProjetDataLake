    "text": "Claus Elsborg Olesen (born 21 August 1974 in Galten, Skandenborg) is a retired Danish sailor, who specialized in two-person keelboat (Star) class. He represented Denmark in the Star class in two editions of the Olympic Games (2004 and 2012), and also shared bronze medals with his partner Michael Hestb\u00e6k at the 2012 Star World Championships in Hy\u00e8res, France. Olesen has also been training throughout most of his sporting career for Kal\u00f8vig B\u00e5delaug Yacht Club in \u00c5rhus. Olesen made his official debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where he paired up with Nicklas Holm in the Star class. On 16 August 2004 Olesen had almost been injured and charged in a road accident, when his partner Holm struck and killed a British pedestrian while speeding in his car on the way to witness the Danish handball team's prelim match. Being overshadowed and cleared by the accident charges, the Danish duo recorded a net score of 83 points to establish a satisfying ninth-place finish in a fleet of seventeen boats, trailing behind Bermuda (led by four-time Olympian Peter Bromby) by a single mark. Eight years after competing in his last Olympics, Olesen qualified as a 38-year-old veteran and a crew member for the Danish squad in the Star class at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London by placing third and receiving a berth from the World Championships in Hy\u00e8res, France. Teaming with his new partner and four-time Olympian Michael Hestb\u00e6k in the opening series, the Danish duo occupied an eleventh spot with a net score of 89, missing out a chance to compete for the medal race by nine points behind French sailors Pierre-Alexis Ponsot and Xavier Rohart. ==References== ==External links== * *NBC Olympics Profile *DIF.dk Profile Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Danish male sailors (sport) Category:Olympic sailors of Denmark Category:Sailors at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Star Category:Sailors at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Star Category:People from Skanderborg Municipality ",
