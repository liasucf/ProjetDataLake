The KOE's ideology is revolutionary Marxism, supporting Marxist ideology with all the historical experience of the communist movement. ==Origins== The KOE has its origins in the Communist Party of Greece ( / Kommounistik\u00f3 K\u00f3mma Ell\u00e1das, KKE). As a result of the KKE's revisionist turn in 1956, Nikos Zachariadis was exiled and many hard-line Stalinists were excluded from the party. A lot of former KKE members founded the Organisation of Marxists-Leninists of Greece (OMLE) in 1964, and published the Anagennissi (Rebirth) monthly review and the weekly La\u00efk\u00f3s Dr\u00f3mos (People's Road). Many people who would eventually found the Communist Organization of Greece joined the OMLE. In 1984, the future founders of the KOE established A/synechia, an effort aimed at rebuilding the communist movement, without revisionist or leftist trends, based on an analysis of the world development and the crisis that was shocking both western and eastern camps. The most prominent member of them was Yannis Hotzeas, who was one of the founders of both the OMLE and the KKE and was also a member of EAM and EPON. ==Ideology== The KOE supports revolutionary Marxism, following the teachings of Marx and Engels as well as the experience of communist movements around the world, including Leninism and Maoism. The KOE was also against Marxist revisionism and against viewing it as merely academic or theoretical instead of practical. ==Paper== The first issue of \"Arister\u00e1!\" in 1996 The party paper was called Arister\u00e1!

The last issue of the paper was published in January 2010.Link to \"Arister\u00e1!\" archive in the KOE's website Since February 2010, the KOE has published the newspaper Dr\u00f3mos tis Arister\u00e1s (, Road of the Left) with another left party also affiliated to the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA), KEDA (, Movement for the United in Action Left).
