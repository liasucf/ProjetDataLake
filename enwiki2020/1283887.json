Chapman University offers 110 areas of study (49 majors and 61 minors), and encompasses ten schools and colleges on campus, including Fowler School of Engineering, Dodge College of Film and Media Arts, Fowler School of Law, and Schmid College of Science and Technology. It is classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities \u2013 High research activity\". ==History== Sculpture of Charles C. Chapman, founder and namesake of Chapman University, created by sculptor Raymond Persinger Wilkinson Hall Schmid Gate, built in 2005 A section of the Berlin Wall is featured in Liberty Plaza. Founded as Hesperian College, in Woodland, California, the school began classes on March 4, 1861. Its opening was timed to coincide with the hour of Abraham Lincoln's first inauguration. Hesperian admitted students regardless of sex or race. In 1920, the assets of Hesperian College were absorbed by California Christian College, which held classes in downtown Los Angeles. In 1934, the school was renamed Chapman College, after the chairman of its board of trustees (and primary benefactor), C. C. Chapman. In 1954, Chapman College moved to its present campus in the city of Orange on the site formerly occupied by Orange High School, which relocated to a nearby campus. Chapman established a Residence Education Center Program to serve military personnel in 1958. This evolved into Brandman University. Chapman College became Chapman University in 1991. In that year, Dr. James L. Doti became president of Chapman University. ==Colleges and programs== Dale E. Fowler School of Law ===Argyros School of Business and Economics=== The George L. Argyros School of Business and Economics is a private research and academic institution at Chapman University located in the Arnold and Mable Beckman Business and Technology Hall. Founded in 1977, the school is named after George L. Argyros, a Chapman alum and former U.S. Ambassador to Spain. Argyros has chaired the board of trustees of Chapman University since 1976, and has donated significant resources towards establishing Chapman as a leading national business school. The business school was renamed in Argyros' honor in 1999. In 2019 the Argyros School celebrated the 20th Anniversary of the naming of the school, capped off with a special fundraiser dinner on October 9, featuring special guest President George W. Bush. The event raised approximately $15 million for the school's endowment, $10 million of which was a surprise announcement by the Argyros family. The $15 million raised is believed to be the largest 1-day fundraising event in Orange County's history. The Argyros School offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in business. The MBA program has three lines, Executive (EMBA), Flexible, and Full-time. In 2018 Chapman's Full-time program was ranked #73 by Bloomberg/Businessweek. Building on its strength in undergraduate accounting, the school also offers a one-year Master of Science in Accounting degree. In 2008, The Princeton Review ranked Chapman Business School's undergraduate and graduate programs among its Top 25 programs in the country. The Argyros School of Business and Economics was officially nationally ranked as the 60th Best Undergraduate Bloomberg BusinessWeek Business School in 2014. In 2016, the Argyros School of Business and Economics rose to 34th in the same Bloomberg rankings. The Argyros School is home to a number of leading research centers and independent research institutes, including the A. Gary Anderson Center for Economic Research, the C. Larry Hoag Center for Real Estate and Finance, the Ralph W.

Attallah Piazza and Leatherby Libraries == Controversy == During the Spring Semester of 2019, student protests over the film school's display of two The Birth of a Nation posters received national attention. The posters were part of a larger donation from Cecilia DeMille Presley, granddaughter of American filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, and had been displayed on the first floor of Marion Knott Studios since they were gifted to the school in 2007. During the 2018\u20132019 school year, Chapman's black student population became more vocal about their discomfort with the display of posters for a film that has been widely criticized for its racist tones, celebration of white supremacy, and use of blackface. The film also is often credited by scholars with reviving the Ku Klux Klan. Though the film is often taught in film school due to its historical importance to the film industry (it is considered to be the first ever blockbuster), the presence of the film's posters made students feel that the film's message was actually being celebrated. After nearly a month of student protests and two years after a student first started an online petition, the Dodge College faculty voted to remove the posters and return them to the donor. ==Notable people== ===Faculty=== * Yakir Aharonov \u2013 Professor, James J.
