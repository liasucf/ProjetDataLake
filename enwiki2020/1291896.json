Francis Bacon's studio was reconstructed in the gallery in 2001 after being dismantled and moved from London starting in 1998.

This process culminated in each artist developing a solo exhibition at the Hugh Lane and a publication. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Art museums and galleries in the Republic of Ireland Category:Arts in Dublin (city) Category:Contemporary art galleries in Ireland Category:Museums in Dublin (city) Category:Art museums established in 1908 Category:1908 establishments in Ireland Category:William Chambers buildings Category:Parnell Square ",
