    "text": "Rehab Reunion is the sixth album (fourth studio album) by Bruce Hornsby with his current touring band, the Noisemakers. Released on June 17, 2016, the album is notable in that Hornsby, widely recognized for his piano capabilities, does not play piano on the album at all. Rather, he plays the dulcimer. The album also marks Hornsby's first release on 429 Records. Like on many of his previous releases, Rehab Reunion features collaborations with guest artists close to Hornsby. Justin Vernon of Bon Iver sings background vocals on \"Over the Rise\" and Mavis Staples duets with Hornsby on \"Celestial Railroad\". Also noteworthy is a folk version of \"The Valley Road\", originally a hit in 1988 with Hornsby's first backing band, the Range. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Bruce Hornsby \u2013 dulcimer, lead vocals * John \"J.
