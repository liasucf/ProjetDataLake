    "text": "Auchenblae (, ) is a village in the Kincardine and Mearns area of Aberdeenshire, formerly in Kincardineshire, Scotland. It is featured in Lewis Grassic Gibbon's novel, Sunset Song, as well as being mentioned in the thrash metal song \"Hotel Blast Terror\" by Thrashist Regime, based on the tragic 2009 incident. The name is a derivation from the Gaelic for \"Field of Flowers\" possibly due to the growing of flax in bygone times. The village was known for its weavers, a whisky distillery and the annual Paldie's Fair horse market. The current parish church, on the opposite side of the Luther Water was built next to an older chapel dedicated to St. Palladius and was formerly known as Fordoun Parish Church. This location, known as at Kirkton of Fordoun was the birthplace of the chronicler John of Fordun (before 1360 \u2013 c. 1384) and has been a religious site since the 7th century. The bones of St Palladius were brought to Auchenblae. There is a Pictish cross slab, the Fordoun Stone, in the kirk's vestibule. In the graveyard is the ancient ruin of St Palladius' Chapel and there is a memorial to Scotland's first Protestant martyr George Wishart, born at Mains of Pittarrow in the old parish of Fordoun and burnt at the stake under the orders of Cardinal Beaton in St Andrews.
