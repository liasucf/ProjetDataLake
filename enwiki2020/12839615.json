She was educated in Europe and traveled extensively. She lived in Florida, New York City, Japan, China, Tahiti and Tunisia, among other places. ==Career== Tietjens was a World War I correspondent for the Chicago Daily News in France, 1917-1918. Her poems had already begun to be published in Poetry: A Magazine of Verse, the noted poetry magazine, around 1913. She later became publisher Harriet Monroe\u2019s associate editor there for more than twenty-five years. Tietjens' was considered a more patient and generous editor, whose style contrasted sharply with that of Monroe, who was not known to treat would-be contributors with \"kid gloves\". One collection of stories, \"Burton Holmes Travel Stories: Japan, Korea and Formosa\" (1924) contains lively descriptions of East Asian countries. By contemporary standards, the stories seem provincial and quaintly Eurocentric. The stories contain descriptions of nationalities and ethnicities that can be understood to be racist. Here's an excerpt: \"...For a great many years this island of Formosa was a terror that haunted all the Western sailors who sailed in those seas. The sea around it is the birthplace of terrible tropical typhoons, which spring up suddenly and sweep helpless ships onto the sharp cliffs, where they are dashed to pieces. And, before Japan tamed her tiger, if a few poor half-drowned sailors managed to land, they were usually captured by the savages who lived there and killed by them. Their heads were preserved as trophies and their bodies eaten, for these savages were cannibals.\" Tietjens was also a Contributing Editor for the Compton\u2019s Encyclopedia. ==Personal life== Her first husband was Paul Tietjens, whom she married in Paris in 1904ART STUDENT WEDS COMPOSER, in the Tacoma Times (via Chronicling America); published May 24, 1904; retrieved July 19, 2016 and by whom she had two daughters, Idea and Janet. They divorced in 1914 in the aftermath of Idea's death, and she remarried in 1920 to Cloyd Head, playwright and theatrical director, by whom she had a son, Marshall Head. She died in 1944 in her hometown of Chicago, aged 60 from cancer.Time Magazine Her papers may be found at: The Newberry Library, Roger and Julie Baskes Department of Special Collections, 60 West Walton Street, Chicago, Illinois 60610-7324. ==Poems== *Old Friendship *The Steam Shovel *Presence of Eternity *The Great Man *The Most Sacred Mountain *The Drug Clerk *The Bacchante to Her Babe ==References== == External links == * * * *Intimate Circles | Eunice Tietjens at highway49.library.yale.edu *Eunice Tietjens at Old Poetry at oldpoetry.com * and Eunice Tietjens Papers and Additions at Newberry Library * Category:1884 births Category:1944 deaths Category:American magazine editors Category:20th-century American novelists Category:American women novelists Category:20th-century American poets Category:American children's writers Category:Newbery Honor winners Category:Writers from Chicago Category:Deaths from cancer in Illinois Category:American women in World War I Category:American women journalists Category:American women poets Category:American women children's writers Category:20th-century American women writers Category:Novelists from Illinois Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:Women magazine editors ",
