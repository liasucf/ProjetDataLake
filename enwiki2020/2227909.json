Two more departments were formed later in that year. At that time, Paysand\u00fa Department included all the territory north of the R\u00edo Negro, which included the current departments of Artigas, Rivera, Tacuaremb\u00f3, Salto, Paysand\u00fa and R\u00edo Negro. On 17 June 1837 a new division of Uruguay was made and this territory was divided in three parts. In the new division, the Tacuaremb\u00f3 Department included also the actual department of Rivera, until it was split from it in 1884. ==Geography== Topographic map of Tacuaremb\u00f3 Department showing main populated places and roads The south borders of the department are delimited by R\u00edo Negro, which, as a result of the dam near Paso de los Toros along its course, forms the Rinc\u00f3n del Bonete Reservoir, also called the Gabriel Terra Reservoir.
