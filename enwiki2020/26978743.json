Fredrik lives a reclusive and somewhat austere lifestyle in a run-down house, enjoying few luxuries. Welin's only companions are his aged cat and dog. The postman, Jansson is the one regular visitor to the island. Despite this Welin has never become particularly sociable with Jensson. In fact he displays little sympathy for the postman\u2019s frequent requests to be treated for his medical concerns and has privately diagnosed Jensson as suffering from mild hypochondria.Henning Mankell novel summaries from Official Henning Mankell website Accessed 18 April 2010 One cold winter's day Welin spies a figure out on the ice, struggling to make its way on foot towards his island. This unanticipated encounter leads to a surprising revelation and a journey not only across Sweden, but also back to his childhood and early adult life.
