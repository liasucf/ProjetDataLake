    "text": "Maria Stenkula Maria Helena Stenkula (22 July 1842-8 February 1932) was a Swedish reform pedagogue and pioneer on women's education. She was regarded as a local pioneer of women's education in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. She was the founder and manager of the Malm\u00f6 High School for Girls (Malm\u00f6 h\u00f6gre l\u00e4roverk f\u00f6r flickor) from 1874 until 1899. ==Biography== Maria Stenkula was the daughter of physician Zacharias Fredrik Agathon Stenkula and Hedvig Margareta Maria Borg. The second eldest of 11 children, she was the sister of professor and educational reformer Anders Oskar Stenkula.(1841-1922). She spent part of her childhood as the foster child of her maternal grandfather, who was a vicar. She never married. As a person, she is described as strict but a skillful pedagogue who devoted her life to her educational ambitions. Stenkula had educational ambitions early on, and wished to become an educated teacher rather than to support herself as a governess without formal education, as was by then most common. She was educated at the Statens normalskola f\u00f6r flickor in 1866-67 and the H\u00f6gre l\u00e4rarinneseminariet in 1867-70, from which she graduated in 1870. ===Malm\u00f6=== In 1874, she and her fellow student Elin Lunnerquist co-founded a girls' school in Malm\u00f6, Maria Stenkulas skola (in 1883 named Fr\u00f6ken Maria Stenkulas h\u00f6gre elementarskola f\u00f6r flickor, and in 1884 Malm\u00f6 h\u00f6gre l\u00e4roverk f\u00f6r flickor). She served as its principal between 1874 and 1899, and was also its teacher in German language and church history. Elin Lunnerquist married and left the school in 1878. Maria Stenkula was inspired by the progressive ideas of the time, in which females should be given a serious education to enable them to be useful to society as professionals, which had been the focus in the Girls' School Committee of 1866 (Flickskolekommitt\u00e9n 1866) . The school of Stenkula has been referred to as the first notable school for girls in Malm\u00f6: while there were several serious secondary education schools for girls in Stockholm and Gothenburg, such opportunities had been closed to females in Malm\u00f6, the third largest city in Sweden. While this is in fact not literary true, as Caroline Kl\u00e9ens skola managed the first girls' school of note in Malm\u00f6 between 1850 and 1870 and Fru Elise Mayers h\u00f6gre l\u00e4roverk f\u00f6r flickor the second in 1857-1888, her school was nevertheless a local pioneer establishment and known and respected for its innovations. It was very successful, arguably the largest school open to females in Malm\u00f6. In 1883, it had 200-300 students with an eight-year elementary and primary school and a three-year secondary education class. She focused in humanistic subjects, offered Swedish, French, German and English, singing education, introduced home economics, daily gymnastics, education in health, school trips and school libraries. ===Later life=== In 1899, Stenkula resigned from her position and left Malm\u00f6 for \u00d6rkelljunga in Sk\u00e5ne, where she founded and managed a small school from 1900 until 1917. It too became a local pioneer institution, and lay the foundation of the local high school and public secondary educational school in \u00d6rkelljunga. In 1932, her former students founded the Maria Stenkula Memorial Fund (Maria Stenkulas minnesfond) . In 1940, Malm\u00f6 h\u00f6gre l\u00e4roverk f\u00f6r flickor as well as the other girls' schools of Malm\u00f6: Tekla \u00c5bergs h\u00f6gre l\u00e4roverk f\u00f6r flickor dating from 1857 and Anna och Eva Bundts skola f\u00f6r flickor which dated from 1887, were all united into Malm\u00f6 kommunala flickskola, the governmental girls' school which was later made co-educational. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==Related reading== *Malm\u00f6 skolors historik 1400 till 1995 Category:1842 births Category:1932 deaths Category:Swedish women's rights activists Category:Swedish feminists Category:19th-century Swedish educators ",
