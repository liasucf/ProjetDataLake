It is located in the 1st and the 11th districts. The hill was named after Saint Gerard who was thrown to death from the hill. The famous Hotel Gell\u00e9rt and the Gell\u00e9rt Baths can be found in Gell\u00e9rt Square at the foot of the hill, next to Liberty Bridge. The Gell\u00e9rt Hill Cave is also located on the hill, facing the hotel and the Danube. At the top of the hill Citadella (English: citadel) can be found with a nice panoramic view of the city == Origin of the name == Citadel The first recorded names of the hill in the Middle Ages were Kelen-hegy, Pesti-hegy (English: Pest Hill) and Blocksberg. From the 15th century it has been called Szent Gell\u00e9rt hegye (lit. the hill of St. Gerard) referring to the legend about the death of St. Gerard. The bishop was assassinated by the pagans during the great pagan rebellion in 1046. He was put in a barrel and rolled down into the deep from the top of the hill. The former name, Pesti-hegy () referred to the large cave (now Gell\u00e9rt Hill Cave) in the hillside. The word is probably of Slavic origin and means oven or cave.A Rend k\u00fclf\u00f6ld\u00f6n The Ottoman Turks called the hill G\u00fcrz Elyas bayiri. G\u00fcrz Elyas was a holy man from the Bektashi order whose shrine and grave on top of the hill was a place of pilgrimage in the 17th century.MN Magyar Nemzet == Geology == The hill belongs to the Buda Hills but in a narrow sense it connects to the southern Buda range consisting also Sashegy. These hills are based on main dolomite from the Late Triassic era although the hills themselves arose later, in the Pleistocene. along a tectonic breakline. This explains also the origin of the hot springs all around the area. The caves are the result of the breaklines and the springs. The most significant among them is the Szent Iv\u00e1n Cave with the Sziklatemplom (English: Cave Church). == History == Naphegy and Tab\u00e1n in Budapest 1905 Meyers Lexikon After the assassination of Gerardus the hill was not populated. The dense forest and rocks gave way to legends of witches holding their ceremonies on the hill. From the 18th century the hillsides were covered with vineyards. The Tab\u00e1n district at the foot of the hill was an important centre of winemaking in Buda. According to the 1789 land register vineyards covered 128 hectares (316 ac) on the hill (only 7.62 hectares or 18.8 ac were used as pastures).Elt\u0171nt budai sz\u0151l\u0151k nyom\u00e1ban, in: Borbar\u00e1t, 2007/3, p. 52 A small calvary was built on the top of the hill which was rebuilt around 1820. On Easter Mondays a procession climbed the steep road leading to the calvary to celebrate the resurrection of Christ. Many tents and vendors were erected on the nearby meadow.

Gell\u00e9rt Hill also saw action in the Second World War and the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, when Soviet tanks fired down into the city from the hill.

Bats and hedgehogs are commonly observed on summer nights. In January 2007, a new cave was discovered under Gell\u00e9rt Hill during private construction. The cave is 60 m long and 18 m deep with three rooms. The interior is covered with dazzling white crystals composed of gypsum, calcite, and aragonite. The cave was created 300,000\u2013500,000 years ago by a now disappeared thermal spring.
