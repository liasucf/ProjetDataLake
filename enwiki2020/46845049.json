He remained unbeaten in the next five LS polls (1977, 1980, 1984, 1989, 1991) despite switching over to the Indian National Congress (Urs) in 1980 and later to Indian Congress (Socialist) in 1984. He had served as the Minister for Telecommunications in the V P Singh Cabinet (1989\u201390). His only defeat in the constituency came in 1996. Unnikrishnan later quit active politics, shifted his base to New Delhi and then to his ancestral house at Panniyankara in Kozhikode, and immersed himself in reading and writing books. Apart from ill-health, Unnikrishnan's decision to keep off politics was aided by group rivalry in the party. ==References== Category:Living people Category:People from Kozhikode district Category:Lok Sabha members from Kerala Category:5th Lok Sabha members Category:6th Lok Sabha members Category:7th Lok Sabha members Category:8th Lok Sabha members Category:9th Lok Sabha members Category:10th Lok Sabha members Category:1936 births Category:People from Coimbatore Category:Indian Congress (Socialist) politicians Category:Indian National Congress (U) politicians ",
