    "text": "The John A. Plummer House is a historic house at 259 Pearl Street in Marianna, Arkansas. It is a two-story wood frame structure, built c. 1900 for John Plummer, owner of a local hardware store who served four terms as county judge, and briefly as mayor of Marianna. The house is an excellent local example of a transitional Queen Anne-Colonial Revival structure, with a gingerbread-decorated wraparound porch, and numerous projections and roof dormers. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Lee County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Queen Anne architecture in Arkansas Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1900 Category:Houses in Lee County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lee County, Arkansas ",
