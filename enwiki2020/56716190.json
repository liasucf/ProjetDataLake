    "text": "Bipolar Explorer is an American dreampop band from New York City. Formed in its present state and genre by band co-founders Summer Serafin (vocals, spoken word) and Michael Serafin-Wells (guitars, bass guitar, percussion, vocals, spoken word), the group has released eight albums and six singles on Slugg Records beginning with 2012's double-album \"Of Love and Loss\". The band became a trio with the addition of French Sylvia Solanas (spoken word) in 2018. ==Formation and Of Love And Loss== After an initial indie rock release \u2013 Go Negative (2005, Slugg Records) featuring former Uncle bandmates Michael Serafin-Wells (songwriter, guitars, bass guitar, vocals) and Yves Gerard (drums, backing vocals) \u2013 still very much in the style of their previous group, Bipolar Explorer changed direction and personnel re-configuring under the influence of co-founder and vocalist Summer Serafin. Debuting the new sound in live performance at New York's Cooper Square Hotel, PopMatters described the band as \"eclectic, powerful and steadfast\" and the group began work on an EP recording for Slugg Records in Brooklyn. Before it could be completed, on March 18, 2011, Ms. Serafin passed away after a tragic accident. She was just 31. Many months later, armed with newly written songs post- tragedy, Serafin-Wells and the band returned to those recordings and in October 2012 released a double-album of, for and about Ms. Serafin. Entitled Of Love and Loss, Ground Control Magazine\u2019s Daryl Darko Barnett pronounced it \"the most significantly stirring and addictive musical accomplishment we\u2019ve come across in some time\", naming it to their Critics Poll of Best Albums of the Year. ==Angels and BPXmas== At the end of 2014, the band released two albums in quick succession, a holiday one BPXmas on December 3, 2014 and Of Love and Loss\u2019s follow-up, Angels on New Year's Day 2015. Both critically acclaimed, NPR\u2019s \"On Being\" noted the band's reworking holiday classics in their signature dream pop style and both albums began rotation on WFMU, notably finding favor with the station's legendary deejay Irene Trudel who called their sound \"great, beautiful drifty-pop\". Ground Control\u2019s Daryl Darko Barnett wrote a feature about the former \"Bipolar Explorer Work a Double-Shift Through the Holidays\" and ended 2015 by naming Angels to his number one spot in the magazine's Best Albums of the Year round up, calling it \"electrifying -what music fueled by raw love and emotions sounds like\". ==Electric Hymnal== In June 2016, the band released their fifth album, a collection of devotional songs and spoken word, both sacred and secular, described as \"a sonic prayer\" for their fallen bandmate, Ms. Serafin. Their first foray into the use of spoken word as a component of their sound, Serafin-Wells would return to its use, composing narrative poetry for a female voice and underscoring it with ambient, post-rock guitars in subsequent releases. Again, Ground Control hailed the work \"...Get ready to be swept up and away by a prayerful reverie of melodies. Listening, I began to feel like I was flying. Don't forget that Bipolar Explorer is a post-rock band. Low growling vocals, gnarly grinding tempos, rhythmic looping strands that escape and rise above the weight of this world, where angels and the living mingle...\" Featuring album art by American artist Michael Creese, Electric Hymnal was released as a limited-edition CD only (no digital) and given away by the band to fans upon request as \"a gift of faith\". ==Dream Together== On New Year's Day 2017, the band released their sixth album, Dream Together. WFMU\u2019s Liz Berg featuring tracks on her show called it \"just a great record\". Again, WFMU\u2019s Irene Trudel, praising it as \"beautiful, full of sadness and wonder\". The album made its way onto the charts of California's free-form KDVS, as well, starting as the station's No. 4 New Add the first week of January and rising to No. 18 overall in the weeks after. Reaching Europe, the album was praised by France's Indiemusic as \"Magical and majestic \u2013 an ultimate tour-de-force\" . On February 20, 2017, the magazine's Associate Editor, Raphael Duprez, followed up with an interview with Michael. In answer to a question about how he and the band continue in light of the tragic events of 2011 he replied, \"All of this is entirely for her. I often say that our music, each album, is of, for and about her. It's my way of telling people about her and talking to her myself. That's the \"for\u2019 and \"about\" parts of the equation. And Summer remains an integral part of the band \u2013 not only as its inspiration but, because I have lots of her isolated vocals from other recording sessions \u2013 as her voice, both spoken and singing, graces each record. I'll write songs and fly in her voice. Summer isn't the main reason BPX goes on, she's the only reason. She is the reason. And I think I can trust that I'm doing things for the right reason if I always know the reason for it is her. Not out of any ambition other than to honor and conjure her. She's my conscience.\" ==Sometimes in Dreams== On New Year's Day 2018, the band released their seventh album, a double-album, called Sometimes in Dreams. Surface Noise's Joe McGasko called it \"Epic and affecting\", the new album again found its way quickly onto playlists at WFMU, notably both Irene Trudel and Gaylord Field's shows, on Tuesday and Sunday nights, respectively. On January 2, France's Indiemusic called the new album \"Unforgettable and essential. Have no doubt, this is a major record.\" By May 2018, Sometimes in Dreams had reached the No. 19 position on WFMU's album charts, leading medium rotation and officially entered the North American College and Community Radio (NACC) charts, tracking college radio airplay in the US and Canada. ==Til Morning Is Nigh== In November 2018, the band's eighth album,Til Morning Is Nigh: A Dream Of Christmas, was released. Featuring new additional instrumentation including synth, organ and melodica, the band also welcomed a new member, Sylvia Solanas, who voices spoken word Les Oreilles Curieuses, Bipolar Explorer \u2013 Sometimes In Dreams / Til Morning Is Nigh: A Dream of Christmas.

As they started working on both an EP for Tremosphere and the Christmas album for Bipolar Explorer, Serafin-Wells got hit by a car in New York City, suffering from several severe injuries followed by a near-fatal pulmonary embolism, thus being hospitalized for several weeks. Both albums were eventually recorded and released, Til Morning Is Nigh: A Dream Of Christmas later than planned, at the end of 2018, and the Tremosphere EP turned into a full album, Interiors, in 2019, with Serafin- Wells still in convalescence.
