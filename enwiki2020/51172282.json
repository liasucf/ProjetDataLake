The Seminoles were led by head coach Leonard Hamilton, in his fifteenth year, and played their home games at the Donald L. Tucker Center on the university's Tallahassee, Florida campus as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. The Seminoles achieved their best start in school history, winning 15 of their first 16 games and six of their first seven conference games, including a stretch that included six straight ranked opponents. Over the course of the season, Dwayne Bacon became the 46th Seminole player, and only the second sophomore, to score a thousand career points. They set their record for most regular season wins, tied their record for most ACC wins in a single season and went undefeated at home for the first time since the 1975\u201376 season. Jonathan Isaac and Dwayne Bacon went on to be selected in the NBA Draft. Florida State finished in a three-way tie for second in the ACC and reached the semifinals of the ACC Tournament. The Seminoles received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament as a three-seed in the west region, their first tournament appearance since 2012, where they reached the second round. ==Previous season== The Seminoles finished the 2015\u201316 season 20\u201314, 8\u201310 in ACC play, to finish in a tie for eleventh place. They defeated Boston College in the first round of the ACC Tournament before losing to Virginia Tech. The Seminoles received an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament where they defeated Davidson before losing to eventual NIT champ, Valparaiso. Guard Malik Beasley was taken in the first round of the NBA Draft by the Denver Nuggets. ==Preseason== Prior to the start of the season, Florida State was picked to finish eighth in the ACC while Dwayne Bacon was named to the preseason All-ACC team. ==Departures== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" !
