By 2 February, she had discharged all cargo and was underway back to the Guadalcanal-Florida Island area. From then until March, she carried cargo and personnel throughout the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomons, the Fijis, and the New Hebrides. In April, she completed a run to Auckland, New Zealand, and in May, she moved supplies to Manus. She then resumed runs in the Solomons-New Hebrides-Fiji area. === Supporting the Allied invasion forces === In August, Rotanin shifted to the Marshalls-Marianas area and at the end of the month she moved further west, to Ulithi. In October, she carried US Army units to the Palaus, embarked Marines there, and transported them to the Russells. In November, she returned to operations in the Marianas, extended them to the Carolines, and in January 1945, returned to Noum\u00e9a. February and March took her back to Micronesia and New Zealand. In April, she was in the Solomons, and, in May, she took on Army supplies and reinforcements for the Okinawa campaign. Arriving off the Hagushi beaches on 21 May, she completed offloading by the end of the month and on 31 May, she steamed east. === End-of-war activity === During June and July, Rotanin again operated in the Marshalls and Marianas. On 28 July, she headed for Hawaii and the west coast. En route when hostilities ceased, she arrived at San Francisco, California, on 17 August. In October, she joined the ships assigned to transpacific operations to ferry occupation troops to Japan and Korea and to return veterans to the United States. == Post-war inactivation and decommissioning == On 2 February 1946, Rotanin arrived at San Francisco and reported to the Commander, 12th Naval District for inactivation.
