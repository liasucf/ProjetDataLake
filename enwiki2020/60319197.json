Howard Crosby Butler, in 1905, at the head of an archaeological expedition from the American University of Princeton, mentioned a large Islamic cemetery located around the ancient church. He also mentioned having found the remains of another church, older and completely destroyed.Howard Crosby Butler: Syria.

Brill, Leiden 1930, , En ligne sur Archive.org The church dedicated to Saint Phocas was probably part of a monastic complex. The same year, Gertrude Bell crossed Basufan and found the village mainly inhabited by Kurds, who rented their houses during the hot summer months to Christians and Jews of Aleppo who had come on vacation.Gertrude Bell, Am Ende des Lavastromes.

According to an inscription on the south wall, the building was dedicated to Saint Phocas and erected in 491-492. The nave was 24 meters long and 15.4 wide. The arches of the nave rested on columns, while the outer walls were reinforced by pilasters. To the east, the chevet was composed of two rectangular apses framing a semicircular central apse. The two rectangular apses connected to the lateral aisles, and the south room was also open to the central apse, serving as a martyrium. The building bore a resemblance to the church of Qal'at Sem'anJean-Pierre Sodini, Jean-Luc Biscop, Qal'at Sem'an et les chevets \u00e0 colonnes de Syrie du Nord, Syria, 1984, Volume 61, pp. 267-330, p.282, JSTOR which could result from an imitation of the architecture of the latter.Michel Kaplan, Le sacr\u00e9 et son inscription dans l'espace \u00e0 Byzance et en Occident, Publications de la Sorbonne, 2001 - 318 pages, p.251 lire en ligne Access to the nave was through a door in the middle of the south facade, and a second access was on the west gable.Howard Crosby Butler: Early Churches in Syria.
