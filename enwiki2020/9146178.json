He then continued his education in Bucharest, Bolhrad and Odessa with the financial support of his wealthy relative Marincho Benli. Six month prior to his graduation from the South Slavic boarding school in Mykolaiv, which he attended between 1869 and 1873, Volov was forced to return to Shumen due to an illness. He was appointed head teacher and director of the local class school. He also organized a night school and took an active part in the activities of the local cultural centre (chitalishte). Volov also conducted revolutionary work in Shumen and the region. In August 1874 Volov participated in the general assembly of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee in Bucharest and was chosen as the chairman of the Shumen local revolutionary committee. Volov was arrested and sent to prison for his participation in the conflict between the local youth and the European engineers working on the Kaspichan\u2013Shumen\u2013Yambol railway. Volov headed the dissatisfied locals who cancelled the wedding of a French engineer with a local girl. Following several months in prison, Volov was released and went to Romania. Panayot Volov took part in the organization of the unsuccessful Stara Zagora Uprising of 1875. He was among the co-founders and most active workers of the Gyurgevo Revolutionary Committee. He was appointed the main \"apostle\" of the 4th revolutionary district in Plovdiv, but after contradictions between him and his assistant Georgi Benkovski Volov gave up the leadership. Volov was one of the initiators of the Oborishte Assembly of the 4th district near Panagyurishte. When the April Uprising broke out, Volov was in Panagyurishte, where he incited the locals to support the rebellion together with other \"apostles\". Following the uprising's utter defeat, he was betrayed to the Ottoman authorities during their attempt to flee to Romania and drowned in the Yantra River near Byala on 26 May 1876. == Honours == Volov Peak on Davis Coast in Antarctica is named after him,SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica Australian Government Department of the Environment/Australian Antarctic Division as well as the football club FC Volov Shumen and its home stadium, Stadion Panayot Volov. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1850 births Category:1876 deaths Category:People from Shumen Category:Bulgarian revolutionaries Category:19th-century Bulgarian people ",
