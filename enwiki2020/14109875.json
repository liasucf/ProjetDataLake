    "text": "Moses Browne (1703 \u2013 13 September 1787), poet and cleric, suffers from uncertainty about the details of his birth. Some records suggest Severn Stoke in Worcestershire, but a London birth is more likely, as he became a pen- cutter in Clerkenwell, London, after the death of his patron, Lord Molesworth, in 1725.English Poetry 1579\u20131830 Retrieved 23 August 2018. He then became a poet, and in middle age a clergyman of the Church of England. ==London life== Browne contributed poems to The Gentleman's Magazine, winning several prizes from its founder. Moses Browne married Ann Wibourne in 1738 in Clerkenwell. Moses and Ann had at least 11 children \u2013 some records indicate up to 13. ==Church appointments== Browne found success as a devotional writer, and on the instigation of the evangelical writer James Hervey, was ordained in 1753. He was then appointed Vicar of Olney, Buckinghamshire in 1753. In 1764, Browne took the additional post of Chaplain at Morden College in Blackheath, London, one reason being that his Olney post could not sustain such a large family. However, he remained a pluralist Vicar of Olney at the same time as Vicar of Sutton (probably Long Sutton, Lincolnshire) until his death in 1787.Alexander Chalmers, in General Biographical Dictionary (1812-17) 7:131-32.
