The family was a line of daimy\u014d (feudal lords) which, along with the Azai clan, opposed Oda Nobunaga in the late 16th century. The Asakura were defeated by Nobunaga at the Battle of Anegawa in 1570; the family's home castle of Ichij\u014ddani was taken in 1573. Asakura Nobumasa (1583\u20131637), nephew of Asakura Yoshikage, was allied with Toyotomi Hideyoshi and with Tokugawa Ieyasu. In 1625, he was granted Kakegawa Domain (25,000 koku) in T\u014dt\u014dmi Province. In 1632, he was implicated in a plot, causing him to be dispossessed and banished to Koriyama, where he died. ==Select list== *Asakura Toshikage (1428\u20131481) *Asakura Sadakage (1473\u20131512) *Asakura Norikage (1474\u20131552) *Asakura Takakage (1493\u20131546) *Asakura Yoshikage (1533\u20131573) *Asakura Kagetake (1536\u20131575) *Asakura Kagetsura (unknown-1570) ==References== ==Further reading== *Turnbull, Stephen (1998).
