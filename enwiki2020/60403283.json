They enter senior, junior and minor teams in various Munster Cricket Union leagues. ==Harlequin Park== The land for Harlequin Park was purchased at Farmers Cross in the early 1960s from Dick Young for \u00a3900. In September 1970 the Lord Mayor of Cork opened the new club pavilion which today houses the club bar. In the 1970s a new playing pitch was developed, which became the first \"grit\" playing surface in the Republic of Ireland. More land was purchased and car parking and the pavilion were extended to include two new dressing rooms, a function hall and a kitchen. The grit pitch was converted into a sand based astroturf surface in 1987, the second of its kind in the Republic. In the 1980s and 1990s more land was purchased from Murphy's Caravan Park and from the Rolf family to increase the size of the facility. A second astroturf pitch was constructed in 1998. The first astroturf pitch fell into disrepair and was used as a car park for a period of time. The club now has two functioning field hockey pitches as well as cricket facilities. ==Notable players== ===Men's field hockey internationals=== ; {| |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" || * Ivan Bateman * Wesley Bateman * Jason Black * Mark Black * David Eakins || * Philip Hardy * Conor Harte * David Harte * Paul Lombard * Brian Long || * Sean Nicholson * Alan O'Driscoll * David O'Driscoll * Ian O'Keefe |} ===Women's field hockey internationals=== ; When Ireland won the silver medal at the 2018 Women's Hockey World Cup, the squad included two Cork Harlequins players, Yvonne O'Byrne and Roisin Upton. {| |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" || * Rebecca Barry * Emma Buckley * Naomi Carroll * Eimear Cregan * Aoife Falvey || * Mary Goode * Sharon Hutchinson * Sarah Kelleher * Rachel Kohler * Sinead McCarthy || * Karen O'Brien * Yvonne O'Byrne * Julia O'Halloran * Cliodhna Sargent * Roisin Upton |} ==Honours== ;Men's field hockey *European Cup Winners Trophy **Winners: 2007: 1 *All-Ireland Club Championship **Winners: 2002: 1 *Irish Senior Cup **Winners: 2006, 2012: 2 **Runners Up: 1938, 1950, 1991, 1995, 2003, 2004: 6 *Irish Junior Cup **Winners: 1999: 1 **Runners Up: 1930, 1979, 1988, 1991, 1997, 2005, 2007: 7 ;Women's field hockey *European Cup Winners Cup B Division **Winners: 2001 *Women's Irish Hockey League **Runners Up: 2009\u201310, 2017\u201318 *EY Champions Trophy **Runners Up: 2018 *Irish Senior Cup **Winners: 2000, 2018-19 **Runners Up: 2003, 2017 *Irish Junior Cup **Winners: 1990, 1992 ==References== ==External links== * Cork Harlequins on Facebook * Cork Harlequins on Twitter Category:Women's Irish Hockey League teams Category:1925 establishments in Ireland Category:Field hockey clubs established in 1925 Harlequins Category:Cricket clubs in Munster Category:Cricket in County Cork ",
