The tournament was played in parallel with the 2019\u201320 CSA 3-Day Provincial Cup, a first-class competition which featured the same teams. On 16 March 2020, Cricket South Africa suspended all cricket in the country for 60 days due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 24 March 2020, Free State and Northern Cape were named as the joint-winners of the tournament, after finishing top of Groups A and B respectively. This was following the recommendations made by Graeme Smith, the acting Director of Cricket. The competition was played between the thirteen South African provincial teams. In previous editions of the competition, Namibia had also competed, but they withdrew ahead of the start of the previous tournament, citing issues around costs and logistics. Easterns were the defending champions. ==Points table== Pool A {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! style=\"width:200px\"|Team !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| |- style=\"background:#cfc\" | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Free State | 9 || 6 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 32 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Gauteng | 9 || 6 || 3 || 0 || 0 || 27 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Easterns | 9 || 5 || 3 || 0 || 1 || 24 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Eastern Province | 10 || 4 || 5 || 0 || 1 || 20 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| KwaZulu-Natal Inland | 10 || 3 || 4 || 1 || 2 || 20 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Boland | 9 || 0 || 6 || 0 || 3 || 6 |} Pool B {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! style=\"width:200px\"|Team !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| !width=\"20\"| |- style=\"background:#cfc\" | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Northern Cape | 9 || 7 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 33 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Northerns | 9 || 6 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 31 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| South Western Districts | 10 || 4 || 5 || 0 || 1 || 21 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Western Province | 9 || 4 || 5 || 0 || 0 || 17 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| KwaZulu-Natal | 9 || 2 || 5 || 1 || 1 || 14 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| North West | 9 || 3 || 6 || 0 || 0 || 13 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Border | 9 || 2 || 6 || 0 || 1 || 10 |} ==Fixtures== ===October 2019=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===November 2019=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===December 2019=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===January 2020=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===February 2020=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===March 2020=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==Final== ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Category:South African domestic cricket competitions CSA Provincial One-Day Challenge Category:2019\u201320 South African cricket season CSA Provincial One-Day Challenge CSA Provincial One-Day Challenge ",
