It received the Australian Independent Record (AIR) Award for 'Best Independent Album' in 2011. ==Background and history== Adalita announced, via Magic Dirt\u2019s websitehttp://www.magicdirt.com that she was playing her first solo shows, taking up a month-long residency at The Retreat Hotel in Melbourne, in April 2009. It was also during this time that she revealed, via the band\u2019s forum, that she was planning to record a solo album later in the year.http://bmdfriendsinforum.runboard.com/t88 Adalita has later stated that it was Dean Turner, her Magic Dirt bandmate, that encouraged her to pursue a solo venture.http://www.thevine.com.au/music/interviews/adalita- interview-20110302-231655 She\u2019d always written songs that weren't always right for Magic Dirt, and Turner suggested she pursue these songs solo. Writing for the solo album began in late 2008.http://thedwarf.com.au/interview/1650/adalita All the songs for the album were, however, written specifically for the album, and were not leftovers from Magic Dirt.http://musicfeeds.com.au/features/adalita-its-more-than-magic-dirt/ Later, in 2009, she toured solo in Victoria and New South Wales,http://bmdfriendsinforum.runboard.com/t94http://www.webcutsmusic.com/interviews/2009/dusting- off-the-magic-dirt-with-adalita/ playing mostly new material with a number of Magic Dirt tracks included in her sets.http://www.webcutsmusic.com/interviews/2009/dusting-off-the-magic-dirt- with-adalita/2/ During this tour, Adalita revealed that she had started recording the album, at Head Gap Studios in Melbourne, with Dean Turner co- producing and J.P. Shilo playing on the recordings. Despite being in the studio when well enough, Turner was largely housebound during the recording, and Adalita would go to his house, near Head Gap, to play him the demos. The track, \u2018The Repairer\u2019, was written about Turner when he became gravely ill. Adalita has said that she wrote song about her fear of losing Turner when she realised he may die.http://www.pagesdigital.com/interview-adalita/ Recording for the album was completed in July 2009.http://www.loudnlocal.com.au/news/album/adalita-brushes-the-dirt-off-and- starts-mixing-her-solo-album/ Turner died on 21 August 2009 of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, a rare form of tissue cancer, and work on the album ceased. Magic Dirt toured in October 2009, and again as part of the Big Day Out tour in January 2010, as a tribute to Turner. Adalita resumed work on the album when mixing began in March 2010. She then resumed touring solo in July, with a short tour of New South Wales and a show in Melbourne.http://bmdfriendsinforum.runboard.com/t158 In November and December 2010, Adalita supported Blondie and The Pretenders nationally, at their A Day On The Green shows and their headlining shows in Sydney and Melbourne. To coincide with the tour, she released the Hot Air EP, the first of the solo material to be released. The EP contained the album's first single, \u2018Hot Air\u2019, along with the three additional tracks that would not appear on the album. Adalita had planned on having the album released by the end of 2010, but was delayed by signing to Liberation Music. The album artwork also contributed to delay. Adalita worked on the artwork for the album herself, and has stated that it was long process. In February 2011, Adalita announced that the album would be released on March 4, 2011, along with a national tour, supporting the album.http://bmdfriendsinforum.runboard.com/t180 During promotional interviews for the album, Adalita often talked about Dean Turner, stating that while most of the songs were written before Turner became chronically ill, \u201c\u2026now that Dean\u2019s gone, it\u2019s definitely taken on a new [light]; it\u2019s got different connotations for me now. There\u2019s a sadness or heartbreak in the record. At the time when I was writing, a lot of the songs were not about Dean or losing Dean. In retrospect, that\u2019s how I look at it now; I filter it through my experiences.\u201d ==Reception== ===Critical response=== Adalita received generally positive reviews from critics upon its release. The album received many comparisons to the work of PJ Harvey, Patti Smith and Cat Power.http://www.webcutsmusic.com/reviews/album-reviews/2011/adalita- adalita/http://soundblab.com/content/content/view/id/4098http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/133247-magic- dirts-frontwoman-adalita-releases-solo-work.html The Age gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, calling it \u201cuncompromising, but vitally accessible\u201d and \u201ca landmark Australian release\u201d. In his review for Faster Louder, Tim Klingbiel called the album a \u201cwork of raw beauty, captivating in its vulnerability and upfront with its emotion\u201d, noting that \u201cthis is a powerful, haunting and direct record, and Srsen lets us into her world without reservation. For that we should feel privileged.\u201dhttp://www.fasterlouder.com.au/reviews/music/27829/Adalita\u2014Adalita Ren\u00e9 Schaefer, reviewing for Mess + Noise, said the album was \u201ca surprisingly varied, but entirely self-consistent solo album, beholden to no one and nothing other than one woman\u2019s passion and imagination.\u201dhttp://messandnoise.com/releases/2000841 Jane Gazzo named Adalita the best Australian album of 2011 on news.com.au.http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/jane-gazzo-picks-the- best-aussie-music-of-2011/story-fn93z1ud-1226229710823 ===Accolades=== Adalita received the Australian Independent Record (AIR) Award for 'Best Independent Album' in 2011.
