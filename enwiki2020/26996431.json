    "text": "Eudicella gralli, sometimes called the flamboyant flower beetle or striped love beetle, is a brightly coloured member of the scarab beetle family, in the subfamily known as flower beetles. Their shells seem to have a prismatic quality, refracting the ambient light to give the green of their carapace a rainbow tint.

The larvae of the flower beetle live in decaying wood, feeding on dead wood and leaf litter. Adults reach lengths of . As in other species of this genus, the males have a \"Y\"-shaped horn, used to fight over females. The females have a shovel-like tusk, used for burrowing in wood. During their gestation period they will dig into the wood and lay eggs.
