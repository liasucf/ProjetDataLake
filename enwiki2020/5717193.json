The Faroe Islands has a small population, and due to the high initial cost of filmmaking, the islands' cinema history is modest. (On the other hand, writing and book publishing is very popular). The first director of the Faroe Islands was Katrin Ottarsd\u00f3ttir. Her first film set in the Faroe Islands was Atlantic Rhapsody in 1989. However, the first feature films in Faroese language with full Faroese castings (\"Rannv\u00e0\" 1975, \"Heystbl\u00f3mur\" 1976 and \"Pall F\u00e1ngi\" 1977) were made in the mid-seventies by Miguel Mar\u00edn Hidalgo, a Spaniard who stayed for several years in the Faroe Islands. In July 2015, the three films were screened again in the Feroe Islands, at the Nordic House in T\u00f3rshavn, with the presence of its author Miguel Mar\u00edn Hidalgo. The Faroese National TV, Kringvarp F\u00f8roya, broadcast \"Rannv\u00e1\" on 25 and 27 December 2016 and \"Heystbl\u00f3mur\" on 1 and 3 January 2017. Recently self-taught Johan Rimestad directed the self-financed feature Karrybollarnir, which takes place in T\u00f3rshavn. In 2012 the first Faroese film prize was established, it is called Geytin. The young Faroese director Sakaris St\u00f3r\u00e1 won the first award for his short film Summarn\u00e1tt (Summer night). In 2013 he directed a new short film Vetrarmorgun (Winther morning), which was awarded at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. In 2014 grants for filmmaking were on the Faroese Government Budget (f\u00edggjarl\u00f3gin) for the first time. 22 applied for a grant, 9 of these received a grant, all together the grants were 485 000 DKK.
