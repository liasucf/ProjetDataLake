He captained the team to second place in the 2017 Ghana Premier League season. Falling six points short of champions Aduana Stars, it proved to be their best ever finish having been promoted back to the league in 2015. In November 2017, WAFA Operations Manager George Ofoshuene admitted it was unlikely Waja would remain with the club next season. New York City FC and Toronto FC were both linked as potentially interested clubs. On February 16, 2018, WAFA revealed that a deal had been agreed between Waja and Toronto FC. === Toronto FC II === On February 20, United Soccer League club Toronto FC II confirmed the signing of Waja on an international spot. == International career == Waja has been capped three times for Ghana Under-17s. On May 25, 2017, Waja made his international debut at senior level in a 1\u20131 draw against Benin.
