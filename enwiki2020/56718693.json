    "text": "Susanna Terracini (born April 29, 1963) is an Italian mathematician known for her research on chaos in Hamiltonian dynamical systems, including the n-body problem, reaction\u2013diffusion systems, and the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Terracini was born in South London. She earned a laurea in 1986 in mathematics at the University of Turin, supervised by Fulvia Skof. She completed her Ph.D. at the International School for Advanced Studies in 1990. Her dissertation, Periodic Solutions to Singular Newtonian Systems, was supervised by Ivar Ekeland and Sergio Solimini. She was a researcher at Paris Dauphine University from 1988 to 1989, and became a faculty member at the Polytechnic University of Milan in 1990. In 2001 she became a full professor at the University of Milano-Bicocca, and in 2012 she returned to Turin as a professor. One of Terracini's papers on the n-body problem was selected for a featured review in Mathematical Reviews. She was the winner of the 2002 Vinti Prize, a prize of the Italian Mathematical Union for young researchers in mathematical analysis. In 2007 she won the Bruno Finzi Prize of the Istituto Lombardo Accademia di Scienze e Lettere. ==References== ==External links== *Home page * Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Italian mathematicians Category:University of Turin alumni Category:Polytechnic University of Milan faculty Category:University of Milano-Bicocca faculty Category:University of Turin faculty Category:21st-century Italian mathematicians Category:20th- century women mathematicians Category:21st-century women mathematicians ",
