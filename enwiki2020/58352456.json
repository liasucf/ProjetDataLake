    "text": "Elizabeth Joy New (born 1984) is an Australian chemist and Associate Professor of the School of Chemistry, University of Sydney. She won the 2018 Australian Museum 3M Eureka Prize. == Early life and education == New was born in Sydney in 1984. She represented Australia at the International Chemistry Olympiad in 2000 and 2001, winning bronze and gold medals respectively,http://www.icho- official.org/results/induvidual_country_results.php?country=Australia and graduated from James Ruse Agricultural High School with a UAI of 100. She earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry at the University of Sydney in 2005, where she completed her master's degree in 2006. During her graduate studies she worked on fluorescent tags to monitor the cellular uptake and metabolism of anti-tumor complexes. New completed her doctoral studies at Durham University working with David Parker, graduating in 2010. Her work looked at the cellular behaviour of lanthanide complexes. == Research and career == She was appointed a Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 Research Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley in 2010. She worked with Christopher Chang on fluorescent sensors for copper. She was made an Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Research Fellow in 2012, working on molecular imaging. New's group developed reversible fluorescent sensors for cellular redox environments. She provided the first examples of reversible ratiometric cytoplasmic sensing and mitochondrial sensing. They develop cobalt complexes for contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. The complexes can be used to monitor oxidative stress. New was made a lecturer in 2015 and a senior lecturer in 2016. In 2017 she received the ChemComm Emerging Investigator. She was appointed Associate Professor in 2018. === Awards === * 2019 Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the Year *2018 Royal Society of New South Wales Edgeworth David Medal * 2018 3M Eureka Prize for Emerging Leader in Science * 2018 Fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales * 2017 Royal Australian Chemical Institute Rennie Memorial Medal * 2017 Royal Australian Chemical Institute Educator of the Year Award * 2016 New South Wales Early Career Researcher of the Year * 2015 Office of Learning and Teaching Teaching Excellence Award * 2015 Young Tall Poppy Science Award * 2015 Selby Research Award * 2015 Vice-Chancellor award for Outstanding Teaching * 2014 Royal Australian Chemical Institute Nyholm Lectureship, 2014-2015 * 2014 Asian Biological Inorganic Chemistry Early Career Research Award * 2011 Royal Society of Chemistry Dalton Young Researchers Award * 2005 University of Sydney The University Medal == References == Category:Australian chemists Category:Inorganic chemists Category:Australian women chemists Category:University of Sydney alumni Category:Alumni of Ustinov College, Durham Category:University of Sydney faculty Category:UC Berkeley College of Chemistry faculty Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:People educated at James Ruse Agricultural High School Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of New South Wales ",
