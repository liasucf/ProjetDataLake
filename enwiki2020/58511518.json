It provides formal and informal educational programmes that aim to enhance young British Jews' sense of Jewish identity and their connection with Israel. Its Chief Executive is Mandie Winston and its chair is Louise Jacobs, the first woman in the role. UJIA's remit includes overseeing and sponsoring Israel group tours that are organised by Jewish religious and ideological organisations for young people in the Jewish community. In 2017 UJIA launched a \u00a3300,000 fund to invest in Israeli start-up businesses that are concerned with improving education, employment and community development. The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, was the guest speaker at a dinner, hosted by UJIA on 17 September 2018, that was held to mark the 70th anniversary of the foundation of Israel. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:1920 establishments in England Category:Charities based in London Category:Galilee Category:Jewish charities based in the United Kingdom Category:Jewish education in the United Kingdom Category:Jews and Judaism in the United Kingdom Category:Zionism in the United Kingdom Category:Zionist youth movements ",
