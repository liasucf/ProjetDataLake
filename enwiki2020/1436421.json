He was one of the Hollywood Ten and later blacklisted by the Hollywood movie studio bosses. ==Life and career== ===Early life=== Scott was born in Arlington, New Jersey, the son of successful Irish Catholic parents \u2014 his father worked in middle management for the New York Telephone Company. Arlington was one of the centers of the American textile industry, a key site in the history of industrial capitalism and a hotbed of radical labor agitation. Arlington is 12 miles south of Paterson, where the 1913 strike of 25,000 silk workers brought together socialists, Wobblies, and Greenwich Village intellectuals. In 1926, when Scott was 15, 20,000 textile workers in nearby Passaic, New Jersey, closed down the mills. Scott's older brother Allan was a playwright (and later screenwriter), whose comedy Goodbye Again ran on Broadway for most of 1933. Adrian's college yearbook in Amherst College described him: \"Hat cocked back at a rakish angle, cigar in the corner of his mouth, his fingers playing nimbly over the typewriter keys, the inimitable R.A.L. Scott.\" Scott graduated from Amherst in 1934. He was a film critic and associate editor of Stage magazine from 1936 through 1938. He moved to Hollywood, California, in 1939. ===Screenwriter=== Scott broke into Hollywood as a screenwriter. He worked on the script for Keeping Company (1940) at MGM, We Go Fast (1941) at 20th Century Fox, and The Parson of Panamint (1941) at Paramount. Scott wrote Mr. Lucky (1943) at RKO, which was a hit. ===Producer=== RKO signed Scott to work as a producer. His first credit in that capacity was My Pal Wolf (1944). He went on to produce Murder, My Sweet (1944), an adaption of Farewell My Lovely by Raymond Chandler by John Paxton that was directed by Edward Dmytryk. It was a critical and commercial success. The cast included Dick Powell, who revitalized his career in the role of Philip Marlowe, and Ann Shirley, whom Scott married. , Scott, Dmytryk, Powell, and Paxton reunited on Cornered (1945). Scott then produced Deadline at Dawn (1946), the only feature film directed by Harold Clurman. Dmytryk, Paxton, and he reunited on So Well Remembered (1947) shot in England. More successful was Crossfire (1947), another collaboration among the three men. Crossfire was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and was a popular success.Richard B. Jewell, Slow Fade to Black: The Decline of RKO Radio Pictures, University of California, 2016 Scott produced The Boy with Green Hair (1948), directed by Joseph Losey, which was a box-office flop.Scott Eyman, Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B. Mayer, Robson, 2005 p 420 He is credited on the script for Miss Susie Slagle's (1946) at Paramount. ===Blacklisting=== Scott joined the Communist Party USA in 1944. In October 1947, Scott was called to testify during the House Committee on Un- American Activities hearings on Hollywood, but as did nine others, refused to testify. RKO fired him on October 29, 1947, for refusing to answer questions. For the first year of the blacklist, he returned to journalism, contributing to the London journal Cine-Technician. He was sentenced to prison along with the other members of the Hollywood Ten. Edward Dmytryk, another of the Hollywood Ten, chose to become a 'friendly' witness and testified before the HUAC in 1951 that Scott pressured him to put communist propaganda in his films. In 1955, Scott published an essay titled \"Blacklist: The Liberal's Straightjacket and Its Effect on Content\" in Hollywood Review. From 1954 to 1961, Scott made a living writing for television.Bernard F. Dick, Radical Innocence: A Critical Study of the Hollywood Ten (Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 1989): 133. These shows included The Adventures of Robin Hood and The Adventures of Sir Lancelot. He provided the story for Conspiracy of Hearts (1960) under a pseudonym. He moved to England in 1961. In 1963, MGM- British hired Scott as a production executive, effectively ending his blacklisting. ===Later career=== Scott attempted to make a return to feature- film production in 1967 by producing a new adaption of Monsieur Lecoq; the film was never finished. Film stills featuring the movie's actress Julie Newmar were featured in the September 1969 edition of Playboy. Shortly before his death, Scott made a television adaption of The Great Man's Whiskers and was credited with his legal name. ==Personal life== Scott was married to actress Anne Shirley, who subsequently married another screenwriter, Charles Lederer, nephew of Marion Davies. He later married Joan Scott (n\u00e9e LaCour), fellow screenwriter and producer. Joan sometimes served as Adrian's front when he was unable to publish under his own name, and later the surname LaCour was used by both when writing in Hollywood. Adrian was the brother of screenwriter Allan Scott, who is the father of actress Pippa Scott. Adrian Scott died from lung cancer in 1972 in Sherman Oaks, California. ==Papers== Joan and Adrian Scott's papers can be found at the American Heritage Center in Laramie, Wyoming. ==References== ==External links== * * the Adrian Scott Archive Category:1911 births Category:1972 deaths Category:American communists Category:American film producers Category:American male screenwriters Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Hollywood blacklist Category:Members of the Communist Party USA Category:People from Kearny, New Jersey Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:20th-century American male writers Category:20th- century American writers ",
