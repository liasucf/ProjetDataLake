The actual period of this Vevu is unknown, however sandstone used in construction is evidence pointing to the pre-Islamic period (500BCE-1153AD). The symmetry of the two wells also suggest it may have been part of a temple. These types of baths are found in other parts of Maldives. Coral stone is also seen in some of the baths and mosques. This supports the theory that the Vevu was built earlier than most coral stone mosques. Vevu are constructed by layering sandstone blocks approximately a meter below the water line till about half a meter above ground. There is an octagonal ledge cantilevered at low tide level for people to access the well. According to recorded history, Maamigili has been uninhabited for at least 200 years and during this time the Vevu has been damaged by natural and human interference, yet still it is considered a fine example of a pre-Islamic coralstone structure. ==Traditional house== An example of traditional Maldivian house at Loama Resort Maldives at Maamigili As part of the museum exhibit, Loama Museum features a traditional Maldivian house on the resort. The house featured follows the traditions of South Asian architectural designs. According to oral history the house has existed in Kandholhudhoo for more than 125 years.

Measuring approximately 20 feet by 12 feet, the house is furnished with functional pieces used for general living. ==Loama Art Gallery== Loama Art Gallery is affiliated with the National Art Gallery, Maldives, and shows contemporary art from the Maldives Loama Art Gallery is affiliated with the National Art Gallery, Maldives, and shows contemporary art from the Maldives.
