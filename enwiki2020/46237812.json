    "text": "The 2016 African Women's Handball Championship was the 22nd edition of the African Women's Handball Championship, held in Luanda, Angola from 28 November to 7 December 2016. It acted as the African qualifying tournament for the 2017 World Women's Handball Championship. This was the first time in the history of the African championships that the male and female editions were organized in two different countries at different times. While men and women competitions were traditionally gathered in the same installations every two years in January, The African Handball Confederation (CAHB) had decided to separate the two competitions after several votes at a meeting on 23 January 2015 at the Abbasside Palace hotel in Algiers. ==Venue== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! style=\"border-left:none; border-right;\" colspan=2|Luanda ||rowspan=6 | |- | style=\"border-left:none; border-right;\" colspan=2|Pavilh\u00e3o Multiusos do Kilamba Capacity: 12,730 |} ==Qualification== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! width=20%|Country !! width=80%|Previous appearances in tournament1 |- | || 15(1976, 1979, 1981,1983, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2002, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014) |- | || 18 (1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014) |- | || 14 (1979, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014) |- | || 20 (1976, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014) |- | || 8 (1992, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014) |- | || 1 (2014) |- | || 19 (1976, 1979, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012) |- | || 7 (1974, 1976, 1991, 1992, 2000, 2012, 2014) |- | || 17 (1974, 1976, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1989, 1992, 1994, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014) |} : 1 Bold indicates champion for that year.
