Organized and presented by the Association of Canadian Television and Radio Artists, which represented performers, writers and broadcast journalists, the Nellie statuettes were presented annually until 1986.\"Canada's new TV award makes debut\". Toronto Star, April 22, 1986. They were the primary national television award in Canada until 1986, when they were taken over by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television to create the new Gemini Awards,\"Last Nellie: Charlie Grant's War; Chaykin and Willoughby top actors in final ACTRAs\". Montreal Gazette, April 3, 1986. although ACTRA continued to present Nellies in radio categories.\"CBC sweeps radio awards: CKO's Peter Varley sole winner in private sector\". Toronto Star, December 3, 1986. The ACTRA Awards were then revived in 2003 as a local film industry award, separately presented by each of ACTRA's regional chapters to honour performances in local film and television production. == History == In 1986, following a threat by CTV to boycott the awards because of a perception that they were biased in favour of CBC Television productions, responsibility for presenting the Canadian television and film awards was transferred to the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television's new Gemini Awards. Awards transferred to the Academy also included the John Drainie Award, a lifetime achievement award for distinguished contributions to Canadian broadcasting, and the Earle Grey Award, which transitioned from ACTRA's award for best performance in a television film into the Academy's lifetime achievement award for acting. ==Revival== On the 60th anniversary of the national union in 2003, now renamed the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists and representing only performers, the ACTRA Awards were resurrected in several of its branches across Canada as a local film and television award, presented by the organization's local chapters in Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador and the Maritimes to honour achievements in film and television within their own regions. However, the revived ACTRA Awards program also includes a national Award of Excellence, presented to an actor to honour their lifetime achievements;\"ACTRA awards make cameo this week\". Calgary Herald, February 25, 2003. the national award of excellence is most commonly presented to an actor who is working in Hollywood, and would thus not be eligible for a regional chapter's local award of excellence. However, the national award of excellence is not necessarily always presented annually. Some awards are handed out for performances, while others are given for union activism and contributions to the industry. ==National Award of Excellence recipients== *2003 \u2014 Leslie Nielsen *2004 \u2014 Lloyd Bochner *2005 \u2014 Tonya Williams *2007 \u2014 Kiefer Sutherland *2009 \u2014 Sandra Oh *2010 \u2014 Eugene Levy *2011 \u2014 Bruce Greenwood *2015 \u2014 Jason Priestley *2016 \u2014 Neve Campbell *2017 \u2014 Kim Coates *2018 \u2014 Molly Parker *2019 \u2014 Jay Baruchel *2020 \u2014 Catherine O'Hara ==Regional awards ceremonies== ===UBCP/ACTRA Awards (Vancouver)=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- !
