It was an important place of worship for the erstwhile Thekkumkur Kingdom. Thekkumkoor kingdom of the 11th century comprised Kottayam, Changanassery and Thiruvalla and High range areas like Mundakkayam and Kanjirapally. After Venimala, Manikandapuram and Changanassery, the capital of thekumkoor become Talikota in the bank of Meenchil River. The temple and the royal house was protected by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and as a result the locality came to be known in the same name as the fort. On a later stage, Tekkumkoor kings shifted their royal house to Nattassery (Near Kumaranalloor) on the outskirts of Kottayam town. After the Changanassery War in 1750, military operations of Marthanda Varma progressed against the Thalikotta fort and palace at Thaliyanthanapuram (Kottayam). Though Thekkumkoor allied with Chempakassery and Vadakkumkoor to protect the kingdom, all of them were finally annexed to Travancore. ==References== Category:108 Shiva Temples Category:Shiva temples in Kerala Category:Hindu temples in Kottayam district Category:Kingdom of Thekkumkur ",
