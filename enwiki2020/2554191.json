In 2012, Roseng\u00e5rd had a population of 23,563 of the municipality's 307,758. Its area was 332 hectares. Roseng\u00e5rd is often incorrectly referred to as a suburb, although the area is located centrally in Malm\u00f6, neighbouring the former city district Centrum. Long a destination for immigrants, 86% of the population had some foreign ancestry in 2008. ==History== Most of Roseng\u00e5rd was built between 1967 and 1972 as a part of the Million Programme although some parts, such as the mansion in Herrg\u00e5rden, and \u00d6stra kyrkog\u00e5rden, are older. Roseng\u00e5rd is to a high degree populated by minorities. In 1972, the percentage of immigrants was around 18%, with the majority of inhabitants being working-class people from rural Sweden. Since 1974, there has been a white flight out of the suburb as more immigrants were assigned there. By 2012, the figure for those of immigrant background was given as 86%. ===Violence=== Roseng\u00e5rd has also been the place for several violent clashes between gangs and between the resident youths and authorities. Fire crews and ambulance personnel have also been threatened and attacked, as well as the police. In June 2011, shots were fired at the lower floor of the police station in Roseng\u00e5rd. Nobody was arrested. In December 2008, riots occurred as youngsters confronted the police in which cars, wagons, kiosks, building sheds, recycling stations, and bicycle sheds were set ablaze. The background to the riots was the eviction of a local mosque. The riot was the most violent yet seen in a suburb in Sweden. The riot finally ended when police forces from Gothenburg and Stockholm were sent in.http://www.smp.se/nyheter/sverige/article1046376.ece In its December 2015 report, the Swedish Police Authority placed the southern half of the district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates. In the summer of 2016, Malm\u00f6 in Sweden suffered a wave of vehicle fires where 70 vehicles were destroyed in a series of attacks. Around half the fires took place in Roseng\u00e5rd. In 2016, after a criminal family had been evicted in an effort by the housing company to reduce crime, the office of the housing company was subjected to three bomb attacks. === 2020 Riots in Malm\u00f6 === In August 2020, the Riots in Malm\u00f6 started in Roseng\u00e5rd. About 300 people rioted in the Roseng\u00e5rd of Malm\u00f6. The unrest broke out at 1900 in the evening after activists from the Danish Hard Line party had burned a Quran during the afternoon and posted a film of their action on social media. Swedish authorities had earlier denied Hard Line party leader Rasmus Paludan a permit to hold a demonstration featuring the burning of the Quran and he was stopped at the border. The rioters set fire to property and attacked police officers and police vehicle with rocks while chanting antisemitic slogans. ===Film=== The 2005 documentary \u201dUtan gr\u00e4nser \u2013 en film om idrott och integration\" (Without Borders - A Film About Sports and Integration) was shot in Roseng\u00e5rd, and is a film described by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet as \"a documentary on how to succeed with integration\" of migrants into Swedish society. Osama Krayem, one of the protagonists, later went on to become one of the 2016 Brussels bombings perpetrators. The Netflix drama web television series based on the writings of Henning Mankell about fictional Inspector Kurt Wallander, Young Wallander features Roseng\u00e5rd heavily in the series as the main focus of the story line. ==Neighbourhoods== Neighbourhoods before July 2013.
