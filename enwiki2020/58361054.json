    "text": "Ren\u00e9e Kahane (n\u00e9e Toole, 9 December 1907 in Argostolion, Greece \u2013 10 December 2002 in Chicago) was a Romance philologist and linguist. == Career == Ren\u00e9e Toole Kahane studied Romance philology at the Universities of Leipzig and Berlin, receiving her PhD in 1931 under the supervision of . In 1931, she married Henry R. Kahane, whom she had met in 1927 when they were fellow PhD students in Berlin. They became lifelong intellectual partners. After obtaining their PhDs, Henry and Ren\u00e9e Kahane moved to Florence where they spent several years collecting a large corpus of Venetian loanwords used in Greek dialects. Following Henry's brief imprisonment in Florence by Mussolini as part of a general round up of immigrant Jews, the Kahanes moved to Cephalonia, Greece, Ren\u00e9e Kahane's birthplace. From there they managed to emigrate to the US in 1939. From 1939-1941 they lived in Los Angeles. In 1941 they moved to the University of Illinois when Henry took up a position, first, in the department of Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese and then in the department of Linguistics (which he founded). They stayed there for the remainder of their careers. A Festschift in honor of Henry and Ren\u00e9e Kahane was published by the University of Illinois Press in 1973. Henry and Ren\u00e9e Kahane are estimated to have had a scholarly output of at least a dozen books and well over one hundred and fifty other publications dealing with various aspects of literary history and linguistics, such as etymology, Romance and Mediterranean lexicography, stylistics, morphology, and dialectology. Beginning in the 1960s their particular focus became the investigation and recovery of the Hellenic heritage to the West, including a sociolinguistic study of the relations between Byzantium and the West told through the reciprocal borrowings of words. == Honors == Henry and Ren\u00e9e Kahane were awarded Bicentennial Gold Medals by the Georgetown University Linguistics Department in 1989 in recognition of their lifetime contributions to the field of Romance linguistics. Henry and Ren\u00e9e Kahane were awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1977 and the Freie Universit\u00e4t-Berlin in 1988. Ren\u00e9e Kahane's doctorate from the University of Berlin was restored to her in 1984. == Selected works == * Kahane, Ren\u00e9e.
