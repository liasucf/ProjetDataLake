    "text": "Gosht or ghosht refers to tender meat, cooked for a long time, and used as an ingredient in a number of Middle Eastern cuisine, Central Asian cuisine and cuisine of the Indian subcontinent. The word stems from the Persian word gosht , meaning \"meat\" or \"flesh\", especially that of goat.UrduWord.com In India, most gosht dishes include goat or mutton. In India, the term \"mutton\" is more likely to refer to the meat of a goat rather than that of an adult sheep, as it does elsewhere in the English-speaking world. When Indian dishes are adapted for Western diners, lamb is the meat most often used in the adaptation. This has led to a common misconception that gosht means \"lamb\".. The popular Indian subcontinental dish of Biryani as well as the Afghan dish of Biryan use Gosht as a primary ingredient. Some dishes include: * Bhuna gosht, a curry with a thick, reduced sauce * Karahi or Kadhai gosht, cooked in a traditional round-sided pot * Raan gosht, roasted leg of mutton * Dal gosht, with lentils or peas * Nihari gosht, a meat stew * Rara gosht, roasted mutton curry * Saag gosht, with cooked spinach leaves or mustard greens * Biryani gosht, especially the non-vegetarian version of it ==References== Category:Bengali curries Category:Indian curries Category:Pakistani curries Category:Pakistani meat dishes Category:Persian words and phrases Category:South Asian curries Category:Urdu words and phrases Category:Bengali words and phrases Category:Bengali cuisine Category:Bangladeshi cuisine ",
