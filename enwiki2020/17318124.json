The mission is said to have received permission from the then king of Kerala to build a church in Kollam.Land, 'Brief History of the Syrians of Malabar'. Anedocta Syriaca, I, pp. 27.Menon, K. P. P. Kerala. I. pp. 273.Joseph, T. K., 'Mar Sapir and Mar Prodh', I. A., 1928, III, p. 311. That the historicity of this mission cannot be verified does not dispute epigraphical evidence that Christians have been on the Malabar Coast in 9th century AD. Kollam Syrian copper plates, an 9th century a royal grant from Kerala, mentions that certain Mar Sapir built a church at Kollam with the blessing of the then king of Kerala. It is likely that Mar Sapir had a companion named Mar Prot.Narayanan, M. G. S. Perum\u0101\u1e37s of Kerala. Thrissur (Kerala): CosmoBooks, 2013. 343-45. A stone cross, one of the five Persian Crosses, with Sassanid Pahlavi inscription recovered also mentions certain \"Afras the Syrian\" as \"the son of Chaharabukht\".C. P . T.

Quilon, Angamaly, Kaduthuruthy and Cranganore (now known as Kodungallur) had the largest population of Saint Thomas Christians in Kerala. Giovanni Empoli, who came to Quilon in 1503, estimated that there were more than three thousand St. Thomas Christians in Quilon alone. After 1561, Thomas Christians were branded heretics by the Goa Inquisition. The infamous Synod of Diamper (1599) anathematized all Christians of India who did not submit to Rome. The synod even branded Mar Sapir and Mar Prot as \"Nestorian heretics\" at the instance of the Portuguese.Narayanan, M. G. S. Perum\u0101\u1e37s of Kerala.
