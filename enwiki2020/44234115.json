It was set up in the final decades of the Edo period in response to Japan's experience of Western military power, and taught Western battlefield tactics such as artillery use alongside traditional Japanese martial arts. The academy was located in Misakich\u014d, Tokyo. It closed in 1866, after only ten years in operation. ==References== Category:Educational organizations based in Japan Category:Defunct Japanese military academies ",
