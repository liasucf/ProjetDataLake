He is known as leader of a political current known as Integrismo (1888-1907) and a chief representative of Catholic fundamentalism when applied to politics. ==Family and youth== Candido Nocedal Ram\u00f3n Ignacio Nocedal Romea was born to a distinguished and well-off Madrid family.

Over time he was assuming more and more conservative positions, in the 1860s forming part of the neocat\u00f3licos.

With all neocat\u00f3licos pundits taking part, it was created as a response to krausism; its principal aim remained confronting heterodoxy in education. Lambasting the leading krausist Sanz del Rio, La Armonia promoted Catholic orthodoxy as a backbone of public education.Urig\u00fcen 1986, pp. 215-6 It was at its sitting that Ram\u00f3n delivered his first public lecture, Rute.Urig\u00fcen 1986, p. 217 In 1867 he set up La Cruzada, \u201csemanal de ciencias, literatura y artes\u201d.La Epoca 11.03.67, available here This short-lived weekly served as a tribune for publishing his highly militant articles, often re-printed in other ultraconservative periodicals;La Esperanza 10.10.67, available here underlining the role of Christianity, they turned against the idea of krausist \u201cexamen libre\u201d.La Esperanza 11.09.67, available here Also in 1867 he became secretary of Academia de Jurisprudencia y Legislaci\u00f3n.presided by his father, see La Correspondencia de Espa\u00f1a 08.04.67, available here In late 1867 neocat\u00f3licos mounted a last-minute attempt to resuscitate the Isabelline monarchy by building a grand counter-revolutionary partyUrig\u00fcen 1986, p.280 and launching a new daily La Constancia as part of the project.owned by Candido Nocedal, see La Espa\u00f1a 21.11.67, available here Ram\u00f3n became member of the editorial boardLa Epoca 21.11.67, available here and contributed with militant articles, which were already becoming his personal trademarkHe wrote: \u201cun peri\u00f3dico no es un tribunal, ni una c\u00e1tedra, ni un libro: es un arma de combate, es un soldado, \u00f3 \u00e1 lo sumo un pelot\u00f3n de soldados\u201d, quoted after Urig\u00fcen 1986, s. 551 and which immediately elicited return fire from the liberal press.\u201cEl art\u00edculo desde la primera l\u00ednea hasta la \u00faltima, es un tegido de apreciaciones equivocadas, seg\u00fan nuestra pobre opinion; pero est\u00e1 escrito con analog\u00eda, sintaxis, prosodia y ortograf\u00eda.

This is probably a reference to violence, which erupted between spectators during the La Carma\u00f1ola performance in 1870; the following day civil governor of Madrid suspended the play. The same work elicited sort of theatrical reply, which took form of La verdadera Carma\u00f1ola, a comedy by a democratic deputy Luis Blanc; the latter approached Nocedal as a Carlist.

As they were adinasticos monarchists,Urig\u00fcen 1986, p. 297 switching from one dynasty to another did not constitute a problem.Candido Nocedal noted in 06.04.71 letter to Isabel II that \u201cla rama de Don Carlos representaba los buenos principios, unicos salvadores del orden social, de la unidad catolica, de la monarquia verdadera\u201d, quoted after Urig\u00fcen 1986, p, 385 In 1870 the neos and the Carlists formed a joint electoral alliance, Asociaci\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lico- Monarquica,Urig\u00fcen 1986, pp. 328, 393 with Ram\u00f3n unsuccessfully running on its ticket in supplementary 1870 elections in Alcala de Henares.La Epoca 10.05.70, available here In 1871 he renewed his bid from the Catholic-monarchist list, though by the press he was already widely reported simply as a Carlist candidate.La Epoca 28.02.71, available here Defeated in Igualada (Barcelona province),La Convicci\u00f3n, 28.02.71, available here, also La Convicci\u00f3n 20.03.71, available here, Urig\u00fcen 1986, p. 437 Ram\u00f3n emerged triumphant in Valderrobres (Teruel province).see the official Cortes service, available here Once in the Cortes, his activity exploded.in an 1871 letter to Ramon Nocedal, the Carlist claimant Carlos VII wrote: \"T\u00fa y tus compa\u00f1eros del Senado y del Congreso sois hoy a representaci\u00f3n de mi Espa\u00f1a; y ese hidalgo pueblo sabe cumplir siempre su deber, como yo s\u00e9 cumplir el m\u00edo\u201d, quoted after Jos\u00e9 Ferm\u00edn Garralda Arizcun, Prmer siglo de carlismo en Espa\u00f1a (1833-1931). Luchas y esperanzas en \u00e9pocas de aparente bonanza pol\u00edtica, Pamplona 2013, p. 60 In May and June 1871 almost every day the Spanish press reported his harangues,see his onslaught on the cortes speaker at La Discussi\u00f3n 24.05.71, available here most of them ultraconservativein 1871 Carlists voted against legality of the International in Spain. Though theoretically registration of various organisations was a mere administrative task, this time the problem arose since the Spanish branch of the International would have been nominally subordinated to a body outside Spain, which was incompatible with the constitution; this constitutional stipulation was originally designed by the Liberals as a measure against Roman Catholic organizations, especially the Jesuit order, Urig\u00fcen 1986, pp. 414-6 and some almost openly disloyal to Amadeo I.when speaking in the Cortes Ram\u00f3n Nocedal made references to \u201cmonarchy of don Amadeo, which unfortunately governs us\u201d, this elicited numerous protests, see La correspondencia de Espa\u00f1a 24.05.71, available here; he advocated the right to insurrection, see El Imparcial 24.05.71, available here. In 1871 Nocedal practiced as abogado and defended in politically sensitive cases, e.g. representing those who faced legal action for denouncing an \u201cinjurioso\u201d Don Amadeo, see La Esperanza 10.07.71, available here In early 1872 Ram\u00f3n edited a manifesto, issued later by Junta Central Cat\u00f3lico- Monarquica, which might have been interpreted as a hardly veiled call for rebellion.the document called not to pay annual financial contributions; according to the constitution they were not obligatory and hence the manifesto remained within the borders of legality. The point was that only payers of the annual fees were entitled to take part in elections, and the call amounted to repudiation of the electoral system, see Urig\u00fcen 1986, p. 512 On the other hand, historians consider the Nocedals the opponents of violent action, as both father and son believed that Traditionalist monarchy might be reinstated by legal means and advised the Carlist claimant Carlos VII accordingly.Urig\u00fcen 1986, pp. 495, 469-470, 512, Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 60 In the spring of 1872 Ram\u00f3n ran on Catholic-monarchist ticket in another electoral campaign,La Esperanza 22.03.72, available here and La Esperanza 26.03.72, available here but failed to prolong his mandate both in Igualada and in Valderrobres.La Epoca 06.04.72, available here; this defeat proved irrelevant as the Carlist claimant ordered those elected to withdraw soon afterwards, Urig\u00fcen 1986,p. 457 Cortes 1872: death to the Carlists! Upon the outbreak of the Third Carlist War in 1872 both Nocedals remained in Madrid, where they were subject to rather minor legal action.Diario official de avisos de Madrid 08.06.72, available here, El Imparcial 11.06.72, available here, La Correspondencia de Espa\u00f1a 28.09.72, available here Their political activity was reduced almost to nil; unable to and indeed uneasy about openly supporting the rebels, they allowed themselves only veiled demonstrations of enmity towards the newly established republican regime.e.g. he sent an open letter supporting canonigo capitular of Santiago de Cuba in his refusal to accept a bishop nominated by the republican authorities, Urig\u00fcen 1986, p. 529 Ram\u00f3n withdrew to privacy: in 1873 he got marriedFern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda 1995, p. 49 and in 1875 he buried his mother.La Correspondencia de Espa\u00f1a 01.06.75, available here He was also busy preparing his plays for stage performance in Madrid theatres,E.g. the play \u201cMarta\u201d in 1874, La Epoca 25.02.74, available here though his whereabouts remain somewhat confused.In June 1874, when Nocedal was supposed to reside in Pozuelo de Alarcon, there was a problem with his correspondence, see Diario official de avisos de Madrid 22.06.74, available here Early 1875, with the war outcome still unclear, the Nocedals launched a new daily, El Siglo Futuro. Formatted as militantly Catholic, it evaded any political declarationsits declared objectives were: \u201cdefender la integridad de los derechos de la Iglesia, propagar las doctrinas cat\u00f3licas y combatir los errores contrarios que en este siglo est\u00e1n en boga y abundan\u201d, El Siglo Futuro 19.03.75, available here though clearly identified itself as ultraconservative.the front-page editorial in the first issue suggested that it was actually the 13th century which constituted a point of reference, see El Siglo Futuro 19.03.75 Later that year the official mistrust towards the Nocedals climaxed in the order of exile;Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 47 they spent the time travelling across Portugal and France until the ban was lifted in late 1876.Urig\u00fcen 1986, p. 529, Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 48 ==Carlist: Restoration== Nocedal in his 30s Following the 1876 military defeat Carlism found itself in disarray. The claimant commenced his bon vivant period leaving political leadership in hands of an inefficient military junta; his followers suffered detentions, expropriations and exile.Jordi Canal i Morell, Banderas blancas, boinas rojas: una historia pol\u00edtica del carlismo, 1876-1939, Madrid 2006, , 9788496467347, p. 64 claims there were 20,000 Carlists exiled; Javier Real Cuesta, El Carlismo Vasco 1876-1900, Madrid 1985, p. 1 gives the number of 12,500 The Nocedals, who emerged as unofficial top Carlist representatives in the Republic-controlled area during the war already, opened their bid to revitalize the movement. Within limitations imposed by the circumstances, they mobilized support by means of a massive 1876 pilgrimage to Rome.known as La Peregrinaci\u00f3n de Santa Teresa Having attracted some 3,000 participants, it was officially intended as demonstration of loyalty to the papal Syllabus banner.Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 51-53; though some authors claim it was an attempt to launch an all-Catholic ultraconservative party, Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 112-12 In the late 1870s two competitive visions emerged within Carlism. The Nocedals promoted the concept of a movement, formatted along ultra- Catholic lines and with guidance provided by massive press machinery;Jordi Canal i Morell, Las \u201cmuertes\u201d y las \u201cresurrecciones\u201d del carlismo. Reflexiones sobre la escisi\u00f3n integrista de 1888, [in:] Ayer 38 (2000), p. 133 its strategy was defined as immovilismo or retraimiento, and consisted of total abstention in official political life. Their opponents, headed by marqu\u00e9s de Cerralbo, opted for a structured political party, with components of traditional Carlist ideario balanced; their strategy, known as aperturismo, envisioned conditional alignment with political rules of the Restauraci\u00f3n. Ram\u00f3n Nocedal, already admitted to meetings of top Carlist leaders with their king,Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 59; Nocedal also opposed to de Cerralbo's entry into the senate (marques was entitled to the senator chair by virtue of his grandeza de Espa\u00f1a), Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 71, Canal i Morell 2000, p. 133 got his way when in 1879 Carlos VII ended the period of indecision. First he appointed a small collegial Junta with Candido Nocedal its member,Real Cuesta 1985, p. 17 and shortly afterwards nominated Ram\u00f3n's father his political representative, Jefe Delegado.Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 59 guerra periodistica With Candido Nocedal political leader and Ram\u00f3n his closest collaborator, Carlism firmly adjusted all its activities to religious goals.Real Cuesta 1985, p. 20 In 1881 they planned another pilgrimage to Rome; Ram\u00f3n became secretario general of junta organizadora,Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 56 though the initiative eventually came to naught.most likely due to lukewarm approach of Leon XIII, unwilling to get trapped in Spanish politics, see Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, pp. 52, 56 When managing and writing to El Siglo Futuro he focused on Catholic and Spanish values, with regionalist and monarchist themes \u2013 let alone dynastical ones \u2013 reduced to secondary role.Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 53 Though relentless towards those seeking rapprochement with the regime,especially the so-called pidalistas, expulsed from Carlism in 1881, see Real Cuesta 1985, p. 29, Garralda Arizcun 2013, p. 74, John N.

Sangarren confessed he bowed to \u201cthe tyranny of Candido Nocedal\u201d only because the latter was appointed by the king grumbled against heavy Nocedals' hand and some conspired against them;Real Cuesta 1985, p. 16 the claimant, though irritated,Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 62 refrained from bold action until Candido Nocedal died in 1885. There were rumors that it would be Ram\u00f3n succeeding his father,Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 79 but as a temporary measure Carlos VII granted partial and conditional interim rights to Francisco Navarro Villoslada.Rom\u00e1n Oyarzun, Historia del Carlismo, Valladolid 2008, p. 393 The aperturistas immediately mounted an offensive, trying to use any formal Carlist initiative as a launchpad for electoral action;like a Junta created to erect a monument to Zumalacarregui, see Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 91 Ram\u00f3n Nocedal counter-attacked, with the claimant opting for a compromise: official party abstention in elections, but with individual candidates permitted here and there.Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 98 As the 1887 rumors nominating general Cavero the next Jefe Delegado proved unfounded,Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 100 with continuous guerra periodistica,Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 102 Nocedal boycotting de Cerralbo's initiativesFern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 101 and both parties complaining about chaos,Real Cuesta 1985, p. 66 Carlism was increasingly stalled in internal strife, decomposition and paralysis.Canal i Morell 2000, p. 118 ==1888 breakup== Carlist standard The conflict, for years localized and contained, entered its second phase in early 1888.Real Cuesta 1985, p. 85 Skirmishes between newspapers suddenly exploded when prestige of the claimant got involved;when anti-nocedalista La Fe referred to the claimant\u2019s Manifesto de Morent\u00edn of 1875 as to the policy that should be followed, El Siglo Futuro responded that the document was inspired by \u201cmestizos\u201d like Valentin Gomez and contained dangerously liberal leaning. Carlos VII responded by publishing a document titled El Pensamiento del Duque de Madrid, pointing that no that no paper can freely read his mind, Canal i Morell 2000, pp. 119-120. Some historians approach Integrist references to the Manifesto (which indeed contained vague phrases about potential need to adjust Carlist politics to circumstances) as a cover story obscuring clearly ambitional Nocedal's motives, some historians to the contrary, highlight the document as a proof of proto-socialist leanings of Carlos VII, which elicited rebellion of reactionary Nocedal as Nocedal refused to budge, in August Carlos VII expulsed him from Carlism. Now both leaders rushed to acknowledge differences, with unusually brutal frankness listed by the claimant\u201cNo te enga\u00f1a la conciencia al sugerirte que debo estar muy enojado contigo. Lo estoy \u00e1 tal punto, que s\u00f3lo por la memoria de tu padre, que fue siempre modelo de disciplina, consiento en escribirte yo mismo, aunque por tu conducta no lo merecerias. Has faltado \u00e1 tu mision de periodista mon\u00e1rquico y \u00e1 tus deberes de s\u00fabdito leal, introduciendo en nuestro campo la discordia, con empe\u00f1o que s\u00f3lo iguala al que pongo yo en extinguirla.No es cierto que entre los tradicionalistas haya dos banderas, seg\u00fan t\u00fa te obstinas en propalar. No hay m\u00e1s que una: la mia, (\u2026) Lejos de eso, tu sa\u00f1a no se detuvo\u201d, quoted after Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 104 and Ram\u00f3n Nocedal.Nocedal referred to a traditional Carlist doctrine when he declared that the claimant possessed \u201clegitimidad de origen pero no de ejercicio\u201d. He went on, commencing with the invocation which was nothing less than an insult when applied to the king: \"Se\u00f1or: en peri\u00f3dicos que se llaman carlistas, y algunos de ellos firmados por personas \u00e1 quien V. honra y distingue, se han proclamado como principios de nuestra pol\u00edtica, como art\u00edculos de nuestro credo, como lemas de nuestra bandera errores tan graves como estos: Que el Rey es la primera palabra de nuestro lema, el primer fundamento de nuestro derecho, el dogma capital de nuestra causa, (\u2026) Que hay que ceder \u00e1 las aspiraciones de la civilizacion moderna, y prescindir de los principios \u00e9 instituciones que no sean compatibles con el liberalismo, y establecer la tolerancia religiosa (\u2026) Que hemos de renunciar \u00e1 defender los principios que puedan espantar \u00f3 retraer \u00e1 nuestros enemigos; \u00e1 los liberales que les espantan y retraen todos nuestros principios fundamentales, desde la soberan\u00eda social de Jesucristo hasta la misma monarqu\u00eda tradicional (\u2026) Que lo que importa es triunfar, aunque sea sin las doctrinas, (\u2026) Que el Papa se atenga \u00e1 lo religioso, y se deje al Rey hacer lo que quiera en lo pol\u00edtico (\u2026) Que se separe de la autoridad real la facultad legislativa, que es establecer la division de poderes en que se apoya el parlamentarismo. Que los intereses materiales tienen m\u00e1s importancia que los morales (\u2026) Que hay que dejarse de integridades \u00e9 intransigencias, y procurar y proclamar la union de la antigua Espa\u00f1a con la moderna\", quoted after Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 107 In historiography the breakup has been extensively discussed, though scholars highlight different points of contention, adversely interpreted dynamics of the conflict and contrasting methodologies. The most traditional judgement underlines the clash of personalities. Ram\u00f3n Nocedal, son of political leader and himself raised to be a leader, considered it natural that he should have succeeded his father. His decisive leadership style and age seniority versus Carlos VII \u2013 a charismatic figure anxious not to be reduced to a decorative role by one of his subjects \u2013 did not help. In Carlism-biased versions of this theory, Nocedal is characterized by overgrown personal ambitions,Oyarzun 2008, pp. 532-533, Jaime del Burgo Torres, Carlos VIl y su tiempo, Pamplona 1994, pp. 328-9, Manuel Ferrer Mu\u00f1oz, Los frustrados intentos de colaborar entre el partido nacionalista vasco y la derecha navarra durante la segunda rep\u00fablica, [in:] Principe de Viana 49 (1988), p. 131 in propaganda mocked as \u201cRam\u00f3n I Pontifice Rey del Universo\u201dCanal i Morell 2000, p. 129 or \u201cRam\u00f3n Romea y Nocedal\u201d.Canal i Morell 2000, p. 130; this was in turn a reference to his uncle and suggestion that Nocedal was good at nothing but acting. In even more extreme variants of the power-greedy-Ram\u00f3n theory, Nocedal and El Siglo Futuro are presented as puppets manipulated by the freemasonry, Canal i Morell 1990, p. 776 Another group of scholars tend to focus on ideological differences. Among this group the prevailing theory places the role of religion in core of the growing conflict within Carlism, pointing that while Nocedal clearly aimed at reducing monarchical, dynastical and fueristathough Nocedal has never ceased to oppose modernising designs of the liberals, who promoted administrative homogenisation; he kept defending traditional local fueros, see Francisco Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez de la Cigo\u00f1a, El pensamiento contrarrevolucionario espa\u00f1ol: Ram\u00f3n Nocedal el parlamentario integrista, [in:] Verbo 193-4 (1981), pp. 617-619; for the Integrist vision of the fueros compared to visions held by other groupings, see Jos\u00e9 Ferm\u00edn Garralda Arizcun, La patria en el pensamiento tradicional espa\u00f1ol (1874-1923) y el \u201cpatriotismo constitucional\u201d, [in:] A\u00f1ales Fundaci\u00f3n El\u00edas de Tejada 9 (2003), pp. 108-109; Olazabal's La Constancia referred to him as \"fervoroso fuerista\", see here threads to secondary roles, Carlos VII intended to keep balance between all components of the Traditionalist ideario.Jaime Lluis y Navas, Las divisiones internas del carlismo a trav\u00e9s de la historia, [in:] Homenaje a Jaime Vicens Vives, vol. 2, Barcelona 1967, pp. 331-334, Jos\u00e9 Andres Gallego, La politica religiosa en Espa\u00f1a, Madrid 1975, pp. 26-34, Jos\u00e9 Barrero Fernandez, EL carlismo gallego, Santiago de Compostela 1976, pp. 280-281; referred after Canal i Morell 2000 Both parties present their variants here:the impact of the breakup on the rank-and-file was not huge; in popular talk the Integrists claimed that \u201cCarlos VII became a Liberal\u201d, while the Carlists claimed that \u201cNocedal betrayed the king\u201d, Real Cuesta 1985, p. 90 according to the Carlists, Nocedal intended to disfigure the party into \u201cacci\u00f3n eminente apostolica\u201d,Barrero Fernandez 1976, pp. 280-1 according to the Integrists, it was the claimant who deviated from principles of Traditionalism.Real Cuesta 1985, p. 88 Carlos VII Within the school concerned with ideological differences, another theory seeks clarification in externalization of the Spanish case; instead of pointing to unique Spanish character of Carlism, it highlights general European patterns of change. With ultramontanism gaining upper hand over more conciliatory political incarnations of Catholicism after the First Vatican Council, and with the new approach made popular in the neighboring France by Louis Veuillot, the 1888 schism was nothing but a local Spanish manifestation of the trend. Defining the nascent Integrism as religious particularism striving for hegemony, this theory enjoys rather limited popularity.Melchor Ferrer, Historia del tradicionalismo espa\u00f1ol, vol. XXVIII-I, Sevilla 1959, pp. 131-132. Jes\u00fas Pabon, La otra legitimidad, Madrid 1969, p. 56, referred after Canal i Morell 2000 Another ideology-focused approach defines both parties not as competing trends within Carlism, but as entirely separate political groupings which between 1870 and 1888 remained in a temporary, shaky alliance. According to this analysis, the religion-focused groupnamed at different stages neocatolicos, tradicionalistas, nocedalistas/nocedalinos or integristas/integros has always been clearly distinct from Carlism.impartial scholarly version of this theory is prestented in Urig\u00fcen 1986; also Antonio Moliner Prada, F\u00e9lix Sard\u00e1 i Salvany y el integrismo en la Restauraci\u00f3n, Barcelona 2000, , 9788449018541, p. 80, mentions \"convergencia t\u00e1ctica entre carlismo e integrismo\" In partisan version, launched in the 1970s for the sake of political struggle, Traditionalists infiltrated into Carlism.compare Josep Carles Clemente, Historia del Carlismo contemporaneo, Barcelona 1977, : \u201cingresaron el el Carlismo grupos de la derecha integrista. Esas minorias, aunque intentaron influir en la ideologia y en la l\u00ednea del partido, nunca arraiganon en \u00e9l\u201d (pp. 13-14), also \u201cintegrismo infiltrado en sus filas\u201d (p. 23), \"la infiltraci\u00f3n se iba desarrollando\", Jos\u00e9 Carlos Clemente, Breve historia de las guerras carlistas, Madrid 2011, , 9788499671697, p. 150 Later this theory was elaborated further on and currently features 3 groupings: Integrists focusing on religious aims, Traditionalists focusing on dynastical aims and (genuine) Carlists focusing on social aims.Josep Carles Clemente, Los d\u00edas fugaces. El Carlismo. De las guerras civiles a la transici\u00f3n democratica, Cuenca 2013, , p. 28 Recently when discussing the 1888 rupture historians tend to combine all factors mentioned, without giving priority to any of them.Canal i Morell 2000, pp. 134-5. The same stand in Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 121: \u201cEn definitiva, fueron tres las causas que pueden explicar esta escisi\u00f3n. Estando en primer lugar Ram\u00f3n Nocedal con su frustraci\u00f3n y despecho por no lograr la delegaci\u00f3n exclusiva del carlismo en Espa\u00f1a que su padre hab\u00eda ostentado entre 1879 y 1885. En segundo lugar se podr\u00eda citar la influencia del auge a nivel europeo del integrismo. Y la tercera y \u00faltima v\u00eda se puede buscar en los motivos religiosos e ideol\u00f3gicos\u201d ==Integrist: early years== El Siglo Futuro, 1892 According to the liberals, the schism left Carlism on its last legs and close to total ruin.Canal i Morell 2000, p. 115 Nocedalistas claimed that their supporters were to be counted by the thousands. What actually constituted their potential was rather a few namesCanal i Morell 2000, p. 122 and especially an impressive array of periodicals, as the breakaways were overrepresented across the Carlist editorial boards.all Carlist periodicals in Vascongadas opted for Integrism, Idoia Estorn\u00e9s Zubizarreta, Aproximaci\u00f3n a un estudio de las elecciones y partidos pol\u00edticos en Euskadi, desde 1808 hasta la Dictadura de Primo de Rivera, [in:] Historia del Pueblo Vasco, San Sebasti\u00e1n 1979, p. 177. Integrist periodicals mushroomed in Catalonia, though they were usually short-lived, see Solange Hibbs- Lissorgues, La prensa cat\u00f3lica catalana de 1868 a 1900 (III), [in:] Anales de Literatura Espa\u00f1ola 10 (1994), pp. 168-170. In the entire Spain there were 24 periodicals switching to Integrism according to Canal i Morell 2000, p. 122, and 25 according to Real Cuesta 1985, p. 87. The Carlists had to make up especially for the loss of El Siglo Futuro, setting up a new nationwide daily of comparable standing. They also launched a periodical designed exclusivey to mock Nocedal, titled Don Ram\u00f3n, Semanario nocedalista-descarado, Canal i Morell 2000, p. 124 Nocedal led the exiled dissidents into a new organization; initially to be named Partido Tradicionalista,Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 118; some authors claim it was launched as Partido Cat\u00f3lico Mon\u00e1rquico, see Jos\u00e9 Carlos Clemente, Seis estudios sobre el carlismo, Madrid 1999, , 9788483741528 p. 20 in early 1889 it materialized as Partido Integrista Espa\u00f1ol.Real Cuesta 1985, p. 108, Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 119 The name was supposed to underline integral unity between Christian and political goals.Nocedal was labelled \u201crepresentative of the Church in the Cortes\u201d, though it is not clear whether the term was auto-applied by himself or by the others, Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 53; another clarification of the name offered is that it referred to integral (i.e. not partial) papal teaching, see Rafael Mar\u00eda Sanz de Diego, Integrismo, [in:] Charles E. O'Neill, Joaqu\u00edn Mar\u00eda Dom\u00ednguez (eds.), Diccionario hist\u00f3rico de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, vol. 3, Madrid 2001, , 9788484680390, p. 2056 Though in August 1889 the party renamed itself to Partido Cat\u00f3lico Nacional,sometimes referred to as Partido Cat\u00f3lico-Nacional, see Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez Sarasola, Los partidos pol\u00edticos en el pensamiento espa\u00f1ol: de la llustraci\u00f3n a nuestros d\u00edas, Madrid 2009, , 9788496467958, p. 153; the official party named has not been changed until Nocedal's death, see El Siglo Futuro 01.03.07, available here the group was usually referred to as Integristas. Structure of the partymirroring the emerging Carlist organization, see Canal i Morell 2000, p. 126, Real Cuesta 1985, p. 110 stabilised in 1893; each Spanish region was led by a junta, with their work co-ordinated by the party jefe.in 1889-1893 the executive role was with a Junta Central, presided by Nocedal; other members of Junta Central were Juan Ort\u00ed y Lara, Liborio Ramery Zuzuarregui, Javier Rodr\u00edguez de la Vera, Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez de Velasco, Ram\u00f3n M. Alvarado and Carlos Gil Delgado, Canal i Morell 2000, p. 127, Canal i Morell 1990, p. 778; in 1893, during national gathering of 88 delegates, representing 17 juntas regionales, the central collegial executive was dissolved The post was assumed by Nocedal, which clearly demonstrated his personal grip on Integrism.Mar\u00eda Obieta Vilallonga, La escisi\u00f3n del \u00abTradicionalista\u00bb de Pamplona del seno del Partido Integrista (1893): la actitud de \u00abEl Fuerista\u00bb de San Sebasti\u00e1n, [in:] Principe de Viana 10 (1988), p. 309, Real Cuesta 1985, pp. 108-9 The program, summarized in Manifestaci\u00f3n de Burgos, focused on building an orthodox Christian state as the ultimate objective and confronting sinister liberalismLiberalism is a sin (1886) by an Integrism-related priest F\u00e9lix Sard\u00e0 y Salvany remained probably the preferred Integrist lecture as the target for today.present-day scholar summarises major points of the document as follows: \u201cabsoluto imperio de la fe cat\u00f3lica \u00ab\u00edntegra\u00bb; condena del liberalismo como \u00abpecado\u00bb; negaci\u00f3n de los \u00abhorrendos delirios que con el nombre de libertad de conciencia, de culto, de pensamiento y de imprenta, abrieron las puertas a todas las herej\u00edas y a todos los absurdos extranjeros\u00bb; descentralizaci\u00f3n regional y un cierto indiferentismo en materia de forma de gobierno\u201d; Pedro Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez Cuevas, Las tradiciones ideologicas de la extrema derecha espa\u00f1ola, [in:] Hispania LXI/I (2001), p. 118 In terms of political regime the Integrists voiced against party politics and parliamentarism,on Nocedal and political parties, see Fern\u00e1ndez de Cigo\u00f1a 1981, pp. 608-617 instead advancing later the theory of organic democracy, i.e. a system based on formal interaction of established, complimentary and co-operative social bodies.Sarasola 2009, pp. 153-154 The party dropped \u201cking\u201d from the Carlist ideario.Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, pp. 102, 119-20 Though Nocedal remained a staunch monarchistGabriel Alf\u00e9rez Callej\u00f3n, Historia Del Carlismo, Madrid 1995, , 978848786339, pp. 184-187, Fern\u00e1ndez de Cigo\u00f1a 1981, pp. 619-622 and though a theoretical sovereign remained an important point of reference in terms of political mobilization, in fact the party was gradually embracing monarchy without a king,Moliner Prada 2000, p. 95; analysis of the Integrist program pp. 94-99 later eventually leaning towards accidentalism.Real Cuesta 1985, p. 110-1 Since the Integrists preached the notion of \u201cSocial Reign of Jesus Christ\u201d, according to sarcastic comments they eschewed consideration of such details as a form of government.see the highly critical British scholar, who writing his work in the 1970s could not resist the temptation to ridicule 19th-century subjects of his dissertation; Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939, Cambridge 2008, , 9780521086349, p. 11 Loyola sanctuary, Azpeitia During last decade of the 19th century dynamics of the nocedalistas was powered mostly by mutual and extremely bitter hostility towards Carlists, who by far outpaced liberals as primary foes;Integrists were prepared to form electoral alliances even with the Liberals if that was to produce a Carlist defeat; Real Cuesta 1985, p. 207; \u201cantes que carlista, cualquier cosa: republicano, fusionista, conservador, cualquier cosa antes que carlista\u201d, quoted after Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Zaratiegui Labiano, Efectos de la aplicaci\u00f3n del sufragio universal en Navarra. Las elecciones generals de 1886 y 1891, [in:] Pr\u00edncipe de Viana 57 (1996), p. 181 occasionally the enmity has even erupted into violence.the most famous act of violence was this of Teatro del Olimpia in Barcelona in November 1888, Canal i Morell 2000, p. 124 In the 1880s adamant not to take part in Restauraci\u00f3n political system, in the 1890s Nocedal intended to turn elections into a battlefield where he could humiliate Carlos VII. The rivalry was made particularly pungent by geographically overlapping Integrist and Carlist zones of influence: though their national electoral strength remained an untested quality, it was clear that both groups enjoyed most support in Vascongadas and Navarre.the most Integrist electoral district in Spain proved to be Azpeitia, and within it the town of Azcoitia, described as \"el pueblo m\u00e1s integrista de toda Espa\u00f1a\", Coro Rubio Pobes, Jos\u00e9 Luis de la Granja, Santiago de Pablo, Breve historia de Euskadi: De los fueros a la autonom\u00eda, Barcelona 2011, 849992039X, 9788499920399, p. 132 During the 1891 campaign the Integrists won 2 Cortes mandates compared to 5 gained by the Carlists; though they had to acknowledge numerical inferiority, Nocedal boasted personal success in the Gipuzkoan district of Azpeitia.see the official Cortes service available here.; this electoral district was picked by Nocedal as the huge and massively popular Jesuit Loyola sanctuary was located in the area; with Compa\u00f1a de Jesus sympathetic towards Integrism, these calculations might not have been unfounded, see Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 244 His victory was indeed made triumphant, as he thrashed the provincial Carlist jefe Tirso de OlazabalFern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 122 and as Carlos VII seemed more interested in defeating Nocedal personally than in result of electoral competition in all other districts. Great speaker,according to an anecdote, Anotnion Canovas when asked about Nocedal in 1891, replied: \"in ten years he will be the greatest orator in the parliament\". Two days later, following Nocedal's onslaught on Silvela, Canovas was asked the same question again. \"Well, two years have passed already\" - replied he, quoted after Fern\u00e1ndez de la Cigo\u00f1a 1981, pp. 604-5 in 1893 the Integrist leader repeated his Azpeitia triumph over the same opponent;some authors claim that following numerous protests and appeals, Nocedal\u2019s mandate was annulled, see Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 248, Canal i Morell 1990, p. 779. This information is not confirmed by the official Cortes service, which lists Nocedal as regularly elected and serving, see here on the national basis the party gained 2 mandates against 7 obtained by the Carlists. In 1896 the Integrists failed to gain a single ticket; also Nocedal was defeated in Azpeitia.though not by Tirso do Olazabal but by Joaqu\u00edn Mar\u00eda de Arana y Belaustegui; his defeat was marginal, see Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 315, also La Iberia 13.04.1896, available here ==Integrist: final years== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:left; font- size:12px; float:left; margin:5px\" |- style=\"font-size: small;\" | colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Integrist mandates, 1891-1905 |- ! year !! mandates |- | 1891 ||Azpeitia (Nocedal), Zumaya (Zuzuarregui) |- | 1893 || Azpeitia (Nocedal), Pamplona (Campion) |- | 1896 || - |- | 1898 || - |- | 1899 || Azpeitia (Olazabal) |- | 1901 || Azpeitia (Aldama), Salamanca (Sanchez Campo), Pamplona (Nocedal) |- | 1903 || Pamplona (Nocedal), Salamanca (Sanchez Campo) |- | 1905 || Azpeitia (Sanchez Marco), Pamplona (Nocedal) |} In mid-1890s Nocedal realized that his bid to launch a nationwide Catholic ultraconservative party had failed; clinging to his intransigence, he nevertheless refused to reconsider the Integrist project and thought it his moral duty to represent orthodox Christian values and confront liberalism against all odds.Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 124 Other members of the party were not so principled and until his death Nocedal had to deal with successive defections, though there was no-one who posed a serious threat to his personal lead.the only Integrist of comparable prestige was F\u00e9lix Sard\u00e0 y Salvany; the two remained loyal collaborators until Nocedal's death. For a sample of his Integrist address, see here As early as 1893 the Integrist pundits, Juan Orti y Lara and marqu\u00e9s de Acillona, advocated reformatting the party as a looser Catholic alliance;Obieta Vilallonga 1988, p. 310 once their proposal was rejected, they left.Canal i Morell 2000, p.127 Soon afterwards Nocedal expulsed the group supporting Arturo Campi\u00f3n,Canal i Morell 2000, p. 127; apart from issues related to Basque identity and provincial rights, the two clashed on Catholic doctrine, role of religion in public life and philosophy of law. Campi\u00f3n, a Christian conservative politician with pre-nationalist Basque leaning, was neither a Carlist nor an Integrist. For his controversies v. Nocedal see Vicente Huici Urmeneta, Ideolog\u00eda y pol\u00edtica en Arturo Campi\u00f3n, [in:] Principe de Viana 163 (1981), p. 651, 671, Emilio Majuelo, La idea de historia en Arturo Campion, Donostia 2011, , pp. 75-80 another strong personality temporarily associated with Integrism; the breakup produced loss of the Navarrese daily El Tradicionalista and some Navarrese leaders.like Francisco de las Rivas or Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, see El Tradicionalista entry at Gran Enciclopedia Navarra online, available here In the late 1890s Integrism suffered in its stronghold, Gipuzkoa.what triggered the conflict remains disputed. One theory highlights the alliance strategy; in 1895 Nocedal changed his recommendations, suggesting coalitions with parties offering the best deal instead of the most approximate ones. Another theory attributes the conflict to nationalist penchant of the dissenters; see Idoia Estorn\u00e9s Zubizarreta, Integrismo entry [in:] Au\u00f1amendi Eusko Entziklopedia online, available here, Carlos Larrinaga Rodr\u00edguez, El surgimiento del pluralismo pol\u00edtico en el Pa\u00eds Vasco (1890-1898).

Denied the exclusive Catholic license, Nocedal more often than not clashed with the bishops on politics-related issues.For a sample see Cristobal Robles Mu\u00f1oz, Cat\u00f3licos y cuesti\u00f3n foral. La crisis de 1893-1894, [in:] Pr\u00edncipe de Viana 10 (1988), p. 400 When in early 20th century Vatican changed its strategy, the new semi-democratic format of policy-making suited Integros even less.for detailed discussion of the process see Guti\u00e9rrez Lloret 2008; the first phase (until 1903) consisted of assembling Congresos Catolicos (pp. 241-245), the second phase (1903-1905) consisted of launching Ligas Cat\u00f3licas (pp. 245-248) Nocedal vehemently opposed the related malmenorismo; the ensuing public debate triggered the 1906 encyclical, Inter Catolicos Hispaniae, while nuncio Rinaldini blamed Nocedal for failure of a grand Catholic coalition.Cristobal Robles Mu\u00f1oz, Cat\u00f3licos y participaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica en Navarra (1902-1905), [in:] Pr\u00edncipe de Viana 10 (1988), p. 413 Though at this point even the Jesuits turned away from Integrism,Guti\u00e9rrez Lloret 2008, p. 249, Robles Mu\u00f1oz 1988, p. 412, Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 419; Alfonso Botti in Nocedal personal entry claims somewhat confusingly that \u201cthe Jesuits campaigned against\u201d Nocedal, see Roy P.

The party leadership was assumed by a triumvirateJos\u00e9 Sanchez Marco, Benito de Guinea and Juan Olaz\u00e1bal according to El Siglo Futuro 11.04.07 available here, or Juan de Olaz\u00e1bal, Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez Marco and Manuel Aznar according to Jose Urbano Asarta Epenza, Juan de Olaz\u00e1bal Ramery entry, [in:] Au\u00f1amendi Eusko Entziklopedia online, available here and shortly afterwards by Juan Olazabal Ramery,Blinkhorn 2008, p. 73 who remained faithful to Nocedal's line. Until the early 1930s the party \u2013 at that time named Comuni\u00f3n Tradicionalista-IntegristaEl Siglo Futuro 11.04.30, available here \u2013 maintained its branches in almost all Spanish provincesexcept Canary Islands, see El Siglo Futuro, here and kept winning some seats in local elections, apart from the Vasco-Navarrese area gaining also few mandates in Catalonia and Andalusia.Blinkhorn 2008, p. 42 In 1932 the Integrists re-united with Carlism and shared its later fate.Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 73 El Siglo Futuro remained in print for 61 years until its premises were ransacked by Republican militia in July 1936.Benito Sacaluga, La prensa madrile\u00f1a en la sublevaci\u00f3n de 1936, [in:] Unidad C\u00edvica por la Rep\u00fablica service, available here Apart from some politics-related debates of the 1970s Nocedal does not figure prominently in contemporary Spanish historiography since he is firmly classified as ultraconservative Catholic politician.one author classified Nocedal as a predecessor of the extreme Spanish Right, see Pedro Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez Cuevas, Las tradiciones ideologicas de la extrema derecha espa\u00f1ola, [in:] Hispania LXI/I (2001), p. 118 This is not the case of Integrism itself, by some scholars viewed as a temporary offshoot branch of Carlism,see e.g. Real Cuesta 1985; in numerous statistical tables (e.g. pp. 193, 273) he presents combined figures for both branches, usually labelled jointly \u201cTradicionalistas\u201d and divided into \u201cIntegrists\u201d and \u201cCarlists\u201d; the book itself, dedicated to Carlism, deals extensively (in separate chapters) with the Integrists and with the followers of Carlos VII and by some as a grouping with clearly separate ideological identity.see e.g. Urig\u00fcen 1986; the author underlines what she believes was a distinct identity of the nocedalistas; though her book in principle does not go beyond 1870, it refers to the 1888 split a few times and suggests a clear continuity between the pre-1870 nocedalista neocat\u00f3licos and the post-1888 nocedalista integros The very term \u201cTraditionalism\u201d is subject to related constant confusion, as it is applied to the nocedalistas,e.g. Urig\u00fcen 1986, p. 533, where she refers to \u201ctradicionalismo donosiano\u201d to another 1919 breakaway Carlist group the mellistas,the name was assumed by the mellista Partido Catolico Tradicionalista, Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012, p. 511 to what is perceived as mainstream Carlism,applied mostly by conservative Carlist orthodoxes to what is perceived as all manifestations of non-mainstream Carlism,applied mostly by socialists from Partido Carlista to non-dynastical Carlism,popular especially in the Francoist Spain to Carlism and Integrism distinguished but combined,e.g. Real Cuesta 1985, Fern\u00e1ndez Escudero 2012 to a broad Catholic conservative movement encompassing Carlismexample in Schumacher 1962, p. 343 to Basque nationalism,Luis Castells Arteche, El desarrollo de la clase obrera en Azcoitia y el sindicalismo cat\u00f3lico (1900\u20131923), [in:] Estudios de historia social 42-43 (1987), p. 1155 to Alfonsist Catholic monarchismJan Kieniewicz, Hiszpania w zwierciadle polskim, Gda\u0144sk 2001, , pp. 208-211; Rafael Calvo Serer is presented as its prominent exponent or is simply used interchangeably with \u201cCarlism\u201d.e.g. Jacek Bartyzel, Bandera carlista, [in:] Umierac ale powoli, Krakow 2006, , pp. 243-331 Following Nocedal's death a multi-volume collection of his works, chiefly a vast selection of his press articles, but also novels and theatrical plays, was published in Madrid between 1907 and 1928;Botti 2006, p. 415 part of it was reprinted in 2012 by an American public-domain publisher, Nabu Press.Obras de D. Ram\u00f3n Nocedal, Charleston 2012, , 9781274787941 In 1952 an anthology of his works was published by Editorial Tradicionalista, which defined him as a Traditionalist Carlist.Antolog\u00eda de Ram\u00f3n Nocedal Romea, preparada por Jaime de Carlos G\u00f3mez-Rodulfo, Editorial Tradicionalista, Madrid 1952. The Carlist publisher's prologue claimed all circumstantial differences with Integrism overcome (pp. 12-13): \"No interesa ahondar en esta cuesti\u00f3n, zanjada ya por el tiempo, con la natural fusi\u00f3n y vuelta del integrismo a la Comuni\u00f3n Tradicionalista. Por encima de hehos lamentables y de contingencias circunstanciales, carlismo e integrismo lucharon por los mismos principios y contribuyeron a salvar las mismas doctrinas y, desaparecidas las causas que determinaron su separaci\u00f3n, se encontraron otra vez juntos en la misma disciplina. Cabe, pues, olvidar esta ri\u00f1a de hermanos, y a la luz de la doctrina, que es lo eterno, por encima de los hechos accidentales, considerar a Ram\u00f3n Nocedal, ahora, en 1951, como un tradicionalista carlista de siempre, y de los que, de forma destacada, han contribuido en grado m\u00e1ximo a la salvaci\u00f3n de la Tradici\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola y a este vigor actual del Carlismo espa\u00f1ol, tan magn\u00edficamente evidenciado en el florecer de boinas rojas de 1936.\" There are few streets in Spain named after Ram\u00f3n Nocedal, e.g. the one in Elda. Perhaps the most lasting of all his initiatives is Colegio El Carmen, an educational institution he decided to set up with his wife in Manises and functional as a Catholic college until today.Nocedal did not endure to see the college set up; the initiative was carried out by his wife and the college opened in 1911, see its official website here ==See also== * Integrism (Spain) * C\u00e1ndido Nocedal * Neocat\u00f3licos * La Constancia * Carlism * Ultramontanism * Partido Cat\u00f3lico Nacional * Electoral Carlism (Restoration) * Navarrese electoral Carlism (Restoration) * El Siglo Futuro * F\u00e9lix Sard\u00e0 y Salvany * Juan Olaz\u00e1bal Ramery * Manuel Senante Martinez ==Footnotes== ==Further reading== * Joan Bonet, Casimir Mart\u00ed, L'integrisme a Catalunya.
