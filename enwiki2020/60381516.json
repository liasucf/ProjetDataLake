Tiny succeeded twice, on 28 March 1848 and 27 March 1849, \"having on both occasions time to spare\". ==Contests== Tiny the Wonder handkerchief, circa 1850 During the 1840s rat-baiting reached its climax in popularity in London. Jemmy Shaw invented the no-touch rule, meaning neither the rat nor the dog could be removed from the pit before completion of the match. ==Breed== Tiny has been described as being an example of a dog close to today's English Toy Terrier. The breed was developed to produce a more evenly matched contest between the dog and the rats. The breed's narrow head and lack of pronounced zygomatic arches allowed it to kill a rat with one bite and not waste any time chewing. The dog's spotting pattern, especially the tan spots on its face brighter than its black eyes, could confuse the rats and also protect the dog's eyes from being bitten. ==Legacy== Tiny's life is one of those being celebrated from 5 April 2019 in an exhibition titled, \"Beasts of London\" at the Museum of London. ==References== Category:Individual dogs Category:Working dogs Category:Dogs in the United Kingdom Category:Rat-baiting Category:Terriers Category:19th century in London ",
