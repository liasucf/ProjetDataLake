Under the recommendation of a teacher, she later applied and was admitted to the Shenzhen Art School at the age of 12. She received her bachelor degree from the Beijing Dance Academy, China's leading dance institution, where she majored in folk dance. Prior to becoming an actress, Li wanted to start a business of tea house into which she could merge elements of dance performance. But after once helping out her friends in film school for a microcinema, she was fascinated and decided to pursue a career in acting. ==Career== In 2016, Li made her acting debut with a leading role in the period fantasy web series Demon Girl by Yu Zheng.

In 2018, Li starred in the wuxia romance web series Bloody Romance, playing an assassin named Wan Mei. She also recorded one of the drama's theme songs. The series was a modest success and received positive reviews. The same year, she made her big-screen debut in the comedy film Keep Calm and Be a Superstar. In 2019, Li starred in the period romance drama Blossom in Heart alongside Deng Lun, historical political drama Royal Nirvana alongside Luo Jin, and wuxia drama Sword Dynasty alongside Li Xian. In 2020, Li starred in fantasy romance film Love You Forever, and modern romance drama Don't Think Twice, Love's All Right alongside Chen Jianbin. ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
