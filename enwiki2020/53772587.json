    "text": "Suman Datta is the Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Stinson Chair Professor of Nanotechnology at the University of Notre Dame since 2016. Prior to that, he was a Full Professor at Penn State University from 2007 to 2016, and Principal Engineer at Intel Corporation from 1999 to 2007. == Education == He received his bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, in 1995. He received his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, in 1999. == Career == From 1999 till 2007, he was with the Components Research division at Intel Corporation in Hillsboro, Oregon. He was a Principal Engineer in the Advanced Transistor and Nanotechnology Group at Intel. He was a member of the Intel transistor R&D; team that pioneered several generations of advanced logic transistor technologies such as high-k/metal gate CMOS, non-planar Tri-gate CMOS, and strained Si/SiGe channel CMOS. He has also led many novel transistor research programs including compound semiconductor based MOSFET and Tunnel FETs. More recently, his research team has investigated phase transition solid-state devices to implement continuous-time dynamical systems and explore their applications in solving hard optimization problems in computer science. He was a Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Penn State University from 2007 to 2015. In 2013, he was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2013 for his contributions to high-performance advanced silicon and compound semiconductor transistor technologies. In 2016, he was named Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors in recognition of his inventions that have made a tangible impact on quality of life, economic development and the welfare of society. As of October 2018, he has nearly 662 publications in different journals, conferences and granted patents and 23,600 citations. == References == Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Intel people ",
