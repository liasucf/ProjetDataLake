The word \"p\u0131\u00e7aq\" in Azerbaijani language means knife and it may refer to the almond used in making this food which has a knife-shaped appearance. Pichagh-gheime is usually made with lamb's meat, sliced onions, almond and egg. One of the most important secrets of making this dish is to fry sliced onion in oil, which turns the color of onions from white to brown. Fried eggs are used in order to design it beautifully. White rice is also eaten beside this food. This food is also cooked by cities and villages near Ardebil, such as Tabriz and Sareyn. The generous use of oil makes the food greasy, but most people visiting Ardabil enjoy eating this traditional food. Other traditional dishes include a soup named \"Ashe-doogh\" and a special Halva named \"Halva-siah\". ==References== Rosa Montazami's cooking book http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7113405.Rosa_Montazami moeen encyclopedia, \u0642\u06cc\u0645\u0647 * * * * Category:Iranian cuisine ",
