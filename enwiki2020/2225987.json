    "text": "Niamh Kavanagh ( ; born 13 February 1968) is an Irish singer who sang the winning entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1993. The 1993 Eurovision Song Contest was held in Millstreet, County Cork, Republic of Ireland. She sang \"In Your Eyes\" to clinch a second consecutive win for Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest. The singer represented Ireland again in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo, with the song \"It's for You\". She performed at the semi- final on 27 May 2010, finishing 9th in a field of 17 contestants, thus qualifying for the Grand Final on 29 May 2010. In the final, she finished 23rd in a field of 25 contestants, having received 25 points. Kavanagh is highly regarded among fans of the Eurovision Song Contest, and the OGAE Ireland (official Eurovision fan club) president, Diarmuid Furlong, said: \"A lot of us would regard Niamh as one of the best vocalists who's ever won the Eurovision Song Contest\". While she has enjoyed success in Europe Kavanagh remains relatively unknown in the United States. However, the singer recorded an album in that country following her initial Eurovision success. ==Early life== Kavanagh was born in Glasnevin, Dublin, Ireland. Her father was a singer and a saxophonist. She often sang songs at family parties as a child. Her influences include Aretha Franklin, Ella Fitzgerald and Blood, Sweat and Tears, all of whom she listened to from a young age, as well as Bonnie Raitt. ==The Commitments== Kavanagh performed as a lead and backing vocalist on the film soundtrack for The Commitments in songs such as \"Destination Anywhere\" and \"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\". In spite of this, Kavanagh was not prepared for the boost in recognition she received for her later entries in the Eurovision Song Contest. ==Eurovision== ===1993=== On 14 March 1993, twenty-five-year-old Kavanagh performed in RT\u00c9's National Song Contest, which selected the Irish entry for the larger Eurovision Song Contest, to be held in Millstreet, County Cork, later that spring. Opening the show at Dublin's Point Theatre, Kavanagh performed \"In Your Eyes\" (lyrics and music by Jimmy Walsh). At the close of voting, Kavanagh handily won the National Song Contest with 118 points from the ten regional juries, a 39-point margin over the runner-up. This win meant Kavanagh and \"In Your Eyes\" would go on to represent Ireland on the Eurovision stage in Millstreet. At the Eurovision on 15 May, Kananagh performed \"In Your Eyes\" near the middle of the show, as the fourteenth act out of twenty-five. This time, the voting was much closer, and Ireland exchanged the leading position with the United Kingdom several times throughout the announcement of the results. With 187 points (a record at the time), Kavanagh went on to win the competition in a nail-biting finish, as the result was decided by the final maximum score awarded by the last country to vote. \"In Your Eyes\" went on to be the best-selling single in Republic of Ireland for 1993, and reached number 24 in the UK Singles Chart. It went on to become a double-platinum success and Kavanagh was recognised by people on the street. She recorded an album in Nashville, Tennessee, United States, and this album was produced by John Jennings. She later left music to spend more time with her children. ===2010=== Kavanagh was again representing Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010, with the song \"It's for You\". The contest was held in Oslo, Norway in May 2010 (semi-final: 27 May 2010; final: 29 May 2010). \"It's for You\" was written by Niall Mooney, Marten Eriksson, Lina Eriksson and Jonas Gladnikoff. Kavanagh performed \"It's for You\" in Oslo alongside her cousin, Niamh Kavanagh, a whistle player, and Nikki Kavanagh, a singer. Kavanagh's possible participation in Eurovision Song Contest 2010 was confirmed on 10 February 2010 when Ireland's public service broadcaster, Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann (RT\u00c9), announced the five finalists for Eurosong 2010, the national final to determine entry. The national final occurred during season 48 of The Late Late Show on 5 March. Kavanagh scored maximum points to beat four other participants.
