It is presented by the actor and artist David Oakes. ==Creation and Reception of Podcast== David, as an environmentalist and an ambassador for the Woodland Trust, started Trees A Crowd as a series of informal conversations with artists, scientists and enthusiasts. Speaking on the Dominic King show on BBC Radio Kent on 19 July 2019, David said in regards to why he started the podcast: Each episode explores how the countryside has inspired different career trajectories. Speaking to Countryman Magazine in June 2019, Oakes said: Jenny Perrone, writing for The Guardian, described the podcast as \u201ca treat for your ears\u201d and the Geographical Magazine praised the podcast: \"In a world of high-energy, jingle-ridden podcasts and antagonistic radio shows Trees a Crowd makes for a pleasantly gentle listen.
