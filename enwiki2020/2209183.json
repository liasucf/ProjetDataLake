He entered the Professional Children's School and the Mannes College of Music, where he studied ear training with Marie Powers, theory with Robert Cuckson, and piano with Edward Aldwell. He has since received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the Mannes College of Music. Currently, he is a C.V. Starr Doctoral Fellow at the Juilliard School, studying with Robert McDonald. Sun was the first prize winner of the 7th National Chopin Piano Competition of the U.S in 2005 and the first International Piano-e-Competition in 2002. Named one of the Musicians of the Year 1996 by the Village Voice at age 15, the now 37-year-old pianist has performed in many of New York's concert halls, including Alice Tully Hall, where his performance of Ravel's Concerto in G was praised by The New York Times as a \"stunningly fluid reading.\" Sun has been featured several times on WQXR Classical Radio as part of the \u201cYoung Artist Showcase\u201d program and on NPR as part of the \u201cPerformance Today\u201d program. He has been heard in recital in much of the United States, Japan, China, France, Spain and Italy. Recent appearances include concert tours of Spain, China, and Japan, and concerto engagements with the Richmond and Winnipeg Symphonies, the National Spanish Orchestra, the Macau Orchestra, and the Hong Kong Sinfonietta. Upcoming engagements include a twenty concert-tour of the United States and abroad sponsored by the Chopin Foundation of the United States. Sun is also highly involved in classical music education and outreach. His latest effort, at whitekeys.com, garnered major media attention shortly after its grand opening, and his website has become a model for other musicians' websites. Sun is a Yamaha Artist. ==External links== *Winner of the first prize in the 7th National Chopin Piano Competition of the U.S *Mei-Ting Sun's website *A classical music outreach program started by Mei-Ting Sun and friends Category:Living people Category:Chinese classical pianists Category:American classical pianists Category:American male pianists Category:American people of Chinese descent Category:Musicians from Shanghai Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
