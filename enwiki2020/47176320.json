Hamed is known for his extensive knowledge of Sharia, as a result, many villagers approach Hamed for guidance for settling disputes. Hamed is praised by Silwadi citizens for his use of Islamic Law when advising on public and private matters. == Issues with the IDF == In mid-2015, 5 IDF soldiers monitored a protest from Silwadi citizens on land owned by Hamed. As the 76-year-old Hamed and his relative approached the soldiers to peacefully protest their presence on his land, he was struck in the abdomen by one of the IDF soldiers. Later, the soldiers left the property. Hamed has since recovered from his injuries. == Notable information == \"Al Hajj\" is title given to any Muslim who has made the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca to perform Hajj. \"Al Hajj\" literally translates into \"The one who completed Hajj\", which is why natives of Silwad officially refer to Essa Hamed \"Al Hajj Essa Hamed.\" ==References== Category:Palestinian politicians ",
