    "text": "The Second Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, officially Second Vice President of the Government of Spain, (Spanish: Vicepresidente Segundo del Gobierno de Espa\u00f1a) is a senior member of the Government of Spain. The office of the Second Deputy Prime Minister is not a permanent position, existing only at the discretion of the Prime Minister. It is a constitutional office because it is foreseen in the Constitution when it provides for the possibility of existing more than one Vice Presidency. The office of second deputy prime minister does not possess special constitutional powers beyond its responsibility as a member of the Council of Ministers. The position is regulated in the Government Act of 1997 and it only specifies that the raison d'\u00eatre of the office is to replace the Prime Minister when the office is vacant, or the premier is absence or ill. Due to its order as second deputy prime minister, he or she would only assume this responsibility if the first deputy could not do it. The current second deputy prime minister is Pablo Iglesias Turri\u00f3n, who is also Minister of Social Rights and 2030 Agenda. == History == The possibility for the creation of this office was established in the Organic Act of the State of 1967. This act established a Council of Ministers composed by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister or more than one Deputy PM and the Ministers. However, the clause was not used until the dictator split the office of head of government and head of state in 1973. In 1974, prime minister Arias Navarro used this possibility to give more relevance to Antonio Barrera Irimo, Minister of Finance. He did the same with its new Finance Minister Rafael Cabello de Alba in October 1974. During his third term, Arias Navarro appointed Manuel Fraga as such, being at the same time Minister of the Interior. Adolfo Su\u00e1rez did the same with his Interior Minister, Alfonso Osorio Garc\u00eda, who was also Minister of the Presidency. From 1977 to 1981, Su\u00e1rez appointed his Finance Ministers as Second Deputies and during his short term, Calvo-Sotelo did the same. Socialist PM Gonz\u00e1lez never used this possibility on his almost 14 years of premiership. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar and Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero did it, following the tradition of appointing as Second Deputy to their Finance Minister. However, a cabinet reshuffle in 2011 granted the position of Second DPM to the Minister of Territorial Policy and Civil Service, Manuel Chaves. The conservative PM Mariano Rajoy never used this position, and prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez did not use it in his first government, but he did it in the second one. ==List of Second Deputy Prime Ministers== ; Parties {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
