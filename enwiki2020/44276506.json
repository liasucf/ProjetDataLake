    "text": "Rosa Mar\u00eda Hinojosa de Ball\u00ed (1752\u20131803) was a rancher known as the first \"cattle queen\" of Texas. She was born in Mexico, in what is now as Tamaulipas. Her parents, Juan Jos\u00e9 de Hinojosa and Mar\u00eda Antonia In\u00e9s Ball\u00ed de Benavides, were Spanish aristocrats who had priority rights to extensive land grants and public offices because they were Primitive Settlers. In 1767 her family moved to Reynosa, where her father had been appointed as alcade. Rosa married Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ball\u00ed, who was a captain of the militia. She inherited 55,000 acres of land from her husband in 1790, although it was in much debt; within thirteen years she doubled the property, as well as making improvements upon it. Rosa endowed churches, including the first chapel in Matamoros. When she died she owned more than one million acres of land in what is now the Rio Grande Valley. Her son Padre Ball\u00ed was an original grantee of Padre Island, which was named after him. Rosa had made a joint application with Padre for eleven leagues of the island, but when reapplication was required in 1800, she withdrew her name in favor of him. ==Further reading== *Minnie Gilbert, \"Texas' First Cattle Queen,\" in Roots by the River (Mission, Texas: Border Kingdom, 1978). ==References== Category:1752 births Category:1803 deaths Category:16th-century Mexican women Category:17th-century Mexican people Category:People in the colonial Southwest of North America Category:Ranchers ",
