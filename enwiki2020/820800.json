    "text": "5-MeO-aMT or 5-methoxy-\u03b1-methyltryptamine, \u03b1,O-Dimethylserotonin (Alpha-O) is a potent psychedelic tryptamine. It is soluble in ethanol. ==Pharmacology== The sympathomimetic effects may in turn be caused by 5-MeO-AMT's structural similarity to the amphetamines. As noted by Alexander Shulgin, the alpha- methylated tryptamines can be looked at as the tryptamine homologues of the amphetamines (alpha-methylated phenethylamines). Mechanisms of action such as inhibition of monoamine reuptake may be involved also. ==Pharmacokinetics== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Binding Sites !

Since the DEA arrests of the makers of a huge percentage of the United States' LSD in 2000, 5-MeO-AMT may have occasionally been sold under the guise of LSD in liquid, sugar cube, or blotter form, though this may be due to DEA reports of finding it on sugar cubes and blotters like LSD.Erowid 5-MeO-AMT Vault : Police Reports of 5-MeO- AMT The most common route of administration for 5-MeO-AMT is orally. Anecdotal reports, however, have described snorting or smoking the substance. Intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) routes are rarely, if ever, used outside research settings due to the high potency, powerful effects and quicker onset. == Effects == Tabs of gelatin containing 5-MeO-AMT. The effects of 5-MeO-AMT occur at 4\u20137 mg orally for most users. Erowid lists the following effects: ===Positive=== * Increased energy * Improved mood heading into euphoria at higher doses * Increased sociability, gregariousness * Increased giggling and laughter * Increased sense of creative thinking * Increased pleasure from sense of touch * Intensification of sex for some users ===Neutral=== * Lightheadedness * Brightening of colors * Visuals including motion, waves, breathing walls, etc. (usually at higher doses, over 4\u20135 mg) * Increased attention to detail * Auditory distortions and/or hallucinations (usually at higher doses) ===Negative=== Expected at any dose: * Headache * Body fatigue * Chills from slightly elevated body temperature (potential dehydration) * Stress and extreme fatigue from long duration of effects. At higher doses or pending potential allergic/histamine reaction: * Nausea, diarrhea * Vomiting at high doses High dose side effects: * Difficulty sleeping or resting for 12\u201324 hours after ingestion. * Paranoia, irritability, anxiety (increasing with dose). * Delusional, aggressive, or dissociated behaviour at very high doses (20+ mg) ==Dangers== If misrepresented as LSD, 5-MeO-AMT can be extremely dangerous; users may take a number of \"hits\" of 5-MeO-AMT, assuming that it is LSD. Unlike LSD, which is very safe in overdose, 5-MeO-AMT can be very harmful or fatal. Particularly sensitive individuals can experience symptoms of overdose at dosages in the normal (for most users) range \u2014 as low as 20 mg. This has led to at least a few hospitalizations and possibly more than one death. It is likely that the overdose potential of the compound is due to its sympathomimetic effects, as the side effects noted in overdose cases include cardiac arrhythmia and seizure. It also seems that oral consumption is safer than insufflation. Gloria Discerni, 18, died after overdosing on a drug initially believed to be LSD. Authorities learned months later that the drug wasn't LSD but a \"designer drug\" identified as 5-MeO- AMT.http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2006/dec/13/charges-dropped-in-drug- death/ ==Legal Status== ===Australia=== 5-MeO-aMT is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015).Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2015L01534 A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities. ===Sweden=== Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkh\u00e4lsoinstitut classified 5-MeO-\u03b1MT as \"health hazard\" under the act Lagen om f\u00f6rbud mot vissa h\u00e4lsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Oct 1, 2004, in their regulation SFS 2004:696 listed as 5-metoxi-alfametyltryptamin (5-MeO-AMT), making it illegal to sell or possess.http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/sfs/20040696.pdf ===UK=== 5-MeO-\u03b1MT was made illegal in the United Kingdom as of 7 January 2015, along with 5-MeO- DALT. This was following the events of 10 June 2014 when the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommended that 5-MeO-\u03b1MT be scheduled as a class A drug by updating the blanket ban clause on tryptamines. ===USA=== 5-MeO-AMT is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States.\u00a71308.11 Schedule I. ====Florida==== 5-MeO-AMT is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess.Florida Statutes - Chapter 893 - DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONTROL ==See also== * 5-MeO-DMT * 5-MeO-DPT * 5-MeO-DiPT * AMT * 5-Chloro-\u03b1MT ==References== ==External links== * DEA forensic journal on 5-MeO-AMT * Erowid 5-MeO-AMT vault * Lycaeum 5-MeO-AMT page * TiHKAL entry * 5-MeO-AMT (\u03b1,O-DMS) entry in TiHKAL \u2022 info Category:Psychedelic tryptamines Category:Monoamine oxidase inhibitors Category:Serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agents Category:Serotonin receptor agonists Category:Mexamines Category:Designer drugs ",
