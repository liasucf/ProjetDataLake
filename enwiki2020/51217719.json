    "text": "Jacaranda copaia is a flowering pioneer tree belonging to the genus Jacaranda. It is native to Central America, and Northern and Western parts of South America. ==Description== The tree is evergreen or semi-deciduous and produces blue flowers from August to November. Young trees have a long trunk with no branches. Large leaves grow directly from the top of the trunk giving them an appearance similar to tree ferns, particularly immature Schizolobium parahyba. When mature, J. copaia grows to and is normally branch free for more than 50% of its height. The top consists of a \"vase-shaped crown\" of branches and leaves. The trunk is approximately in diameter and has rough, dark gray bark. ==Distribution== Jacaranda copaia is native to Central America as well as Northern and Western South America. It is common in the Brazilian Amazon where, as a pioneer species, it colonizes gaps in the forest and areas that have been cleared. ==Uses== During the dry season, the leafy branches are burned as a way to repel biting insects. The bark has been used as a laxative and to treat dysentery and syphilis. The leaves have been used to treat leishmaniasis, fevers, yaws and ringworm. The Guyana Patamona use the juice of young leaves to treat persistent sores. The native people in Kurupukari, Guyana also use parts of the tree for treating ulcers and sores. ==References== copaia Category:Trees of northern South America Category:Trees of western South America Category:Trees of the Amazon Category:Trees of Peru ",
