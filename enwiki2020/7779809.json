    "text": "Aechmea fasciata is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is commonly called the silver vase or urn plant and is native to Brazil. This plant is probably the best known species in this genus, and it is often grown as a houseplant in temperate areas. ==Habit== The plant grows slowly, reaching in height, with a spread of up to . It has elliptic\u2013oval-shaped leaves long and arranged in a basal rosette pattern. ==Growing conditions== Aechmea fasciata requires partial shade and a well-drained, but moisture- retentive soil. It can also be grown epiphytically, as, for example, with moss around its roots and wired to rough bark. Root rot can be a problem if the soil is too moist. Scale insects and mosquitos will sometimes breed in the pools of water that are trapped between the leaves. ==Toxicity== Aechmea fasciata is listed in the FDA Poisonous Plant Database under the section for \"Skin irritating substances in plants\" and is known to cause contact dermititis, phytophoto dermatitis, and contact allergy. ==Cultivars== {| |- valign=top | * Aechmea 'Aton' * Aechmea 'Auslese' * Aechmea 'Chantata' * Aechmea 'Charles Hodgson' * Aechmea 'Checkers' * Aechmea 'Club Maurice' * Aechmea 'Cosmic Starburst' * Aechmea 'DeLeon' * Aechmea 'Dennis B.' * Aechmea 'Donna Marie' * Aechmea 'Fascidata' * Aechmea 'Fascini' * Aechmea 'Friederike' * Aechmea 'Frost' * Aechmea 'Fulgo-Fasciata' * Aechmea 'Henrietta' | * Aechmea 'Ivory' * Aechmea 'Julie Sewell' * Aechmea 'Kiwi' * Aechmea 'Leucadia' * Aechmea 'Margarita L.' * Aechmea 'Mona' * Aechmea 'Morgana' * Aechmea 'Pink Fantasy' * Aechmea 'Pink Rocket' * Aechmea 'Primera' * Aechmea 'Purple Velvet' * Aechmea 'Red Rocket' * Aechmea 'Silver King' * Aechmea 'Silver Queen' * Aechmea 'Silver Sister' * Aechmea 'Smoothie' * Aechmea 'Starbrite' * Aechmea 'White Head' | * xAndrolaechmea 'Crateriformis' * xBillmea 'Rangitoto' * xCanmea 'Wild Tiger' * xNeomea 'Fascidorffii' * xNeomea 'Pink Cascade' * xNidumea 'Angellina' * xNidumea 'Midnight' * xNidumea 'Superstar' * xQuesmea 'Facsimile' * Aechmea 'bifolia' |} ==References== *BROMELIACEAE DA MATA ATL\u00c2NTICA BRASILEIRA retrieved 22 October 2009 *BSI Cultivar Registry Retrieved 11 October 2009 ==External links== * * fasciata Category:Flora of Brazil Category:Epiphytes Category:House plants Category:Taxa named by John Gilbert Baker Category:Taxa named by John Lindley ",
