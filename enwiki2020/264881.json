He also served as Britain's principal delegate to the United Nations immediately after World War II and as Attorney General for England and Wales. == Early life == Hartley William Shawcross was born in Giessen, Germany, to British parents, John and Hilda Constance (Asser) Shawcross, while his father was teaching English at Giessen University. He attended Dulwich College, the London School of Economics and the University of Geneva and read for the Bar at Gray's Inn, where he won first-class honours. ==Career== Shawcross interviewed on CBS-TV's Longines Chronoscope (1954) He joined the Labour Party at a young age and served as Member of Parliament for St Helens, Lancashire from 1945 to 1958, being appointed to be Attorney General in 1945 until 1951. It was in 1946 when debating the repeal of laws against trade unions in the House of Commons that Shawcross allegedly said \"We are the masters now\",This is the wording usually quoted, and is attested by eyewitness Lord Bruce in a New Statesman article, but it is still a matter of dispute. For full details see Wikiquote, Hartley Shawcross, Baron Shawcross. a phrase that came to haunt him. He was knighted in 1945 upon his appointment as Attorney-General and named Chief Prosecutor for the United Kingdom at the Nuremberg Trials. === Nuremberg Trials === Shawcross's advocacy before the Nuremberg Trial was passionate. His most famous line was: \"There comes a point when a man must refuse to answer to his leader if he is also to answer to his own conscience\". He avoided the crusading style of American, Soviet and French prosecutors. Shawcross's opening speech, which lasted two days, the 26 and 27 July 1946, sought to undermine any belief that the Nuremberg Trials were victor's justice (an exacted vengeance against defeated foes). Instead, he focused on the rule of law and demonstrated that the laws that the defendants had broken, expressed in international treaties and agreements, were those to which prewar Germany had been a party. In his closing speech, he ridiculed any notion that any of the defendants could have remained ignorant of the thousands of Germans exterminated because they were old or mentally ill. He used the same argument for the millions of other people \"annihilated in the gas chambers or by shooting\" and maintained that each of the 22 defendants was a party to \"common murder in its most ruthless forms\". ===Attorney-General and UN Factotum=== As Attorney-General, he prosecuted William Joyce (\"Lord Haw- Haw\") and John Amery for treason, Klaus Fuchs and Alan Nunn May for giving atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, and John George Haigh, known as 'the acid bath murderer'. From 1945 to 1949, he was Britain's principal delegate to the United Nations and was involved in the official adoption of the UN flag in 1946, but he was recalled in 1948 to lead for the government's interest at the Lynskey tribunal. In 1951, he briefly served as President of the Board of Trade until the Labour government's defeat in the election of that year. Shawcross left his name to a Parliamentary principle, in a defense of his conduct regarding an illegal strike, that the Attorney-General \"is not to be put, and is not put, under pressure by his colleagues in the matter\" of whether or not to establish criminal proceedings. ===Return to opposition=== Shawcross ended his law career in 1951, the same year as the defeat of the second Attlee ministry. He was expected to become a Tory, earning him the nickname \"Sir Shortly Floorcross\" but instead he remained true to his Labour roots. During the committal hearing for the suspected serial killer doctor John Bodkin Adams in January 1957, he was seen dining with the defendant's suspected lover, Sir Roland Gwynne (Mayor of Eastbourne from 1929\u201331), and Lord Goddard, the Lord Chief Justice, at a hotel in Lewes. The meeting added to concerns that the Adams trial was the subject of concerted judicial and political interference. Shawcross resigned from Parliament in 1958, saying he was tired of party politics. ===Elevation=== Shawcross was made one of Britain's first life peers on 14 February 1959 as Baron Shawcross, of Friston in the County of Sussex, and sat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher. === Defending press freedom === In 1961 he was appointed the chairman of the second Royal Commission on the Press. In 1967 he became one of the directors of The Times responsible for ensuring its editorial independence. He resigned on being appointed chairman of the Press Council in 1974. From 1974 to 1978 he was chairman of the Press Council and is described as \"forthright in his condemnation both of journalists who committed excesses and of proprietors who profited from them\" and as a \"doughty defender of press freedom\". ==Later years== In October 1974 he poured scorn on a Labour Party pamphlet that recommended the application of \"internal democracy\" to editorial policy, saying \"This means that... there would be some sort of committee consisting at the best of a mixture of van drivers, press operators, electricians and the rest, with no doubt a few journalists, but more probably composed of trade union officials, to deal with editorial policy.\" In the 1974 New Year Honours Lord Shawcross was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE). ==Philanthropy and awards== In 1957, he was among a group of eminent British lawyers who founded JUSTICE, the human rights and law reform organisation and he became its first chairman, a position he held until 1972. He was instrumental in the foundation of the University of Sussex and served as chancellor of the university from 1965-85. He was the President of the charity Attend (then National Association of Leagues of Hospital Friends) from 1962\u201372. == Personal life == Lord Shawcross was married three times. His first wife Alberta Rosita Shyvers (m. 24 May 1924) suffered from multiple sclerosis and committed suicide on 30 December 1943. His second wife Joan Winifred Mather (m. 21 September 1944) died in a riding accident on the Sussex Downs on 26 January 1974. His second wife gave birth to two sons, the author and historian William Shawcross and Hume Shawcross, and a daughter, Dr Joanna Shawcross. At the age of 95 he married Susanne Monique (n\u00e9e Jansen), formerly wife of Gerald B. Huiskamp,Burke's Peerage 1999, vol. 2, p. 2594 on 18 April 1997 in Gibraltar. He died at home at Cowbeech, East Sussex, at the age of 101. Lady Shawcross died on 2 March 2013. From 1947 to 1960 he was the owner of Vanity V, a 12-metre class racing yacht designed by William Fife to the Third International Rule, built in 1936, which he kept at his home in Cornwall. A later skipper of the boat, John Crill, recalls being told that Lord Shawcross, \"when the election was due in about 1951, had Vanity V repainted with a vast 'Vote Labour' banner all the way along her topsides\". ==Coat of arms== == References == == Bibliography == * == External links == * * * * Obituary, The Independent, 11 July 2003 by James Morton * * Appearance on Desert Island Discs (7 July 1991) * Category:1902 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Attorneys General for England and Wales Category:British Queen's Counsel Category:British centenarians Category:Crossbench life peers Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Labour Party (UK) life peers Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ministers in the Attlee governments, 1945\u20131951 Category:People associated with the University of Sussex Category:People educated at Dulwich College Category:Presidents of the Board of Trade Category:Prosecutors of the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg Category:Queen's Counsel 1901\u20132000 Hartley Shawcross Category:Social Democratic Party (UK) life peers Category:UK MPs 1945\u20131950 Category:UK MPs 1950\u20131951 Category:UK MPs 1951\u20131955 Category:UK MPs 1955\u20131959 Category:UK MPs who were granted peerages ",
