August Diehl and Raoul Peck at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival ==Plot== While in his 20s, Karl Marx struggles to establish himself as a writer of political and sociological importance. He meets Friedrich Engels, a young man whose wealthy father owns factories. Engels' belief that the workers there and elsewhere, including children, are mistreated and underpaid matures. The men begin to work together to create a new political movement to reform and unite the impoverished workers. Eventually, the two stage a coup during a meeting of the League of the Just and create the Communist League in its place. The film ends with Marx and Engels writing and publishing their objectives as The Communist Manifesto. ==Cast== *August Diehl as Karl Marx *Stefan Konarske as Friedrich Engels *Vicky Krieps as Jenny von Westphalen *Olivier Gourmet as Pierre Proudhon *Hannah Steele as Mary Burns *Alexander Scheer as Wilhelm Weitling *Hans-Uwe Bauer as Arnold Ruge *Michael Brandner as Joseph Moll *Ivan Fran\u011bk as Mikhail Bakunin *Peter Benedict as Friedrich Engels Sr. *Niels-Bruno Schmidt as Karl Gr\u00fcn *Marie Meinzenbach as Lenchen *Eric Godon as The foreman *Stephen Hogan as Thomas Naylor *Rolf Kanies as Moses Hess *Ulrich Brandhoff as Hermann Kriege *Aran Bertetto as Paddy ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 60% based on 47 reviews, and an average rating of 6/10.
