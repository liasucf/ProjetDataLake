Drekavac, literally \"the screamer\",Levi, Pavle (2007) Disintegration in frames: aesthetics and ideology in the Yugoslav and post-Yugoslav cinema Stanford University Press, Stanford, California, page 181, was the name for a mythological creature in Serbian folklore, a bogeyman (registered in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro). According to Rovinski, Drekale is the Albanian-language corruption of Andrej; that being his actual name. == History == Drekale was elected the position of vojvoda (\"duke\") of the Ku\u010di tribe probably in the second half of the 16th century, based on the proposal of Dreca Dedin. According to a story, vojvoda \u017dijo Peralov of Kosor married his daughter Mara to Drekale. Their descendants were to be known as Drekali/Drekalovi\u0107. There are several stories on his origin. *One story has Drekale as the \"son of a Mrnjav\u010di\u0107 and the daughter of Klimenti vojvoda Martin\". This would mean that he was a descendant of the Old Ku\u010di. *According to Edith Durham Drekale descent from Berisha. Legends about the progenitor of the Kastrati say that it was Drekale's brother who had come from Ku\u010di, while \u0110. Slijep\u010devi\u0107 stressed that it was more likely that the progenitor came from Ku\u010di but descended from some other family as Drekale in fact had no brothers. Dreca Dedin in fact passed his own title of Vojvoda to him, impressed by his successful peace negotiations with the Vizier of Skhoder. Marko Miljanov points out that he was the first elected Vojvoda, as well as the first Vojvoda of the overall tribe, since at the time the Ottoman authorities appointed one in every village. Drekale had two sons, Nikola and Lale. According to tradition, Drekale, along with his older son Nikola, was killed in a skirmish by the members of Kelmendi tribe while they were shepherding in the \u017dijevo mountains. His son Lale survived thanks to the fact that, being still young, he switched his clothes in child's play with a certain Muslim boy from Podgorica by the name of Lisi\u010di\u0107. Unfortunate boy, who was occasionally shepherding with them, was killed instead. Some historians place this event around 1550.http://milacic.awardspace.com/Istorija.htm Lale later avenged the death of his father and brother, with the help of Muslims from Podgorica. The vengeance is described in epic folk song Priest Milutin and the Drekalovi\u0107i.http://montenegrina.net/pages/pages1/istorija/plemena/drekalovici_porijeklo_vojvoda_drekale_m_miljanov.html == Legacy == Drekale is commemorated in literature and oral traditional poetry, such as Vojvoda Drekale and Vuk of the Klimente. Marko Miljanov wrote about Drekale and his descendants in his works. Simo Matavulj extensively discussed about Drekale in one of his novels. == References == Category:16th- century Serbian people Category:Montenegrin people of Albanian descent Category:Converts to Eastern Orthodoxy from Roman Catholicism Category:Eastern Orthodox Christians from Montenegro Category:Montenegrin military personnel Category:16th-century births Category:16th-century people of the Ottoman Empire ",
