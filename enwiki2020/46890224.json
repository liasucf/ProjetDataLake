    "text": "The 2010\u201311 National League 1 is the second season of the third division of the English domestic rugby union competitions since the professionalised format of the second division was introduced. Coventry find themselves playing in this league following their relegation from the 2009-10 RFU Championship while teams coming up include Macclesfield (2009\u201310 National League 2 North), Barking and Rosslyn Park (both 2009\u201310 National League 2 South). Despite losing three out of their first four games, London Scottish would go on to win the league title by winning twenty-six games on the trot and finishing ahead of newly promoted Barking. They actually trailed Barking for most of the season, with a rearranged Christmas fixture meaning that they would face the Goresbrook-based side in the final game. London Scottish won this game 17 - 13 to become the champions and seal promotion to the 2011\u201312 RFU Championship. At the other end of the table relegated teams included Launceston (who were unable to overcome a 20-point deduction given at the start of the season due to going into voluntary liquidation), Otley and Redruth. Launceston and Redruth would drop to the 2011\u201312 National League 2 South, with at least the consolation of having the Cornish derby for next season, while Otley dropped to the 2011\u201312 National League 2 North. ==Participating teams and locations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=50% |- !width=29%|Team !width=29%|Stadium !width=12%|Capacity !width=30%|City/Area |- |Barking |Goresbrook |1,000 |Becontree, Dagenham, London |- |Blackheath |Rectory Field |6,000 |Blackheath, London |- |Blaydon |Crow Trees |2,000 (400 seats) |Swalwell, Tyne and Wear |- |Cambridge |Grantchester Road |1,250 (200 seats) |Cambridge, Cambridgeshire |- |Cinderford |Dockham Road |2,500 |Cinderford, Gloucestershire |- |Coventry |Butts Park Arena |4,000 (3,000 seats) |Coventry |- |Launceston |Polson Bridge |3,000 |Launceston, Cornwall |- |London Scottish |Athletic Ground |4,500 (1,000 seats) |Richmond, London |- |Macclesfield |Priory Park |1,250 (250 seats) |Macclesfield, Cheshire |- |Otley |Cross Green |5,000 |Otley, West Yorkshire |- |Redruth |The Recreation Ground |3,500 (580 seats) |Redruth, Cornwall |- |Rosslyn Park |The Rock |2,000 |Roehampton, London |- |Sedgley Park |Park Lane |3,000 |Whitefield, Greater Manchester |- |Stourbridge |Stourton Park |3,500 (499 seats) |Stourbridge, West Midlands |- |Tynedale |Tynedale Park |2,000 (400 seats) |Corbridge, Northumberland |- |Wharfedale |The Avenue |2,000 |Threshfield, Craven, North Yorkshire |- |} ==League table== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- |colspan=\"15\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"|2010\u201311 National League 1 table |- |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"| |style=\"background- color:#efefef;\" width=\"195\"|Club |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Played |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Won |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Drawn |style=\"background- color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Lost |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points For |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points Against |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points Difference |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Try Bonus |style=\"background- color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Losing Bonus |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points |-style=\"background-color:#d8ffeb;text-align:center;\" | 1 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | London Scottish (C) || 30 || 27 || 0 || 3 || 958 || 518 || 440 || 22 || 2 || 132 |- | 2 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Barking || 30 || 27 || 1 || 2 || 818 || 461 || 357 || 15 || 1 || 126 |- | 3 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Cambridge || 29 || 19 || 1 || 9 || 1005 || 706 || 299 || 20 || 5 || 103 |- | 4 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Macclesfield || 30 || 17 || 2 || 11 || 904 || 711 || 193 || 18 || 5 || 95 |- | 5 || style=\"text- align:left;\" | Tynedale || 30 || 17 || 2 || 11 || 904 || 711 || 193 || 18 || 5 || 95 |- | 6 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Blackheath || 30 || 14 || 1 || 15 || 765 || 746 || 19 || 12 || 8 || 78 |- | 7 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Rosslyn Park || 30 ||13 || 0 || 17 || 786 || 847 || -61 || 10 || 9 || 71 |- | 8 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Coventry || 30 || 12 || 1 || 17 || 774 || 828 || -54 || 13 || 6 || 69 |- | 9 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Stourbridge || 30 || 13 || 0 || 17 || 662 || 792 || -130 || 10 || 4 || 66 |- | 10 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Blaydon || 30 || 11 || 0 || 19 || 679 || 792 || -113 || 11 || 11 || 66 |- | 11 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Sedgley Park || 30 || 13 || 1 || 16 || 624 || 878 || -254 || 8 || 3 || 65 |- | 12 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Cinderford || 28 || 12 || 0 || 16 || 614 || 703 || -89 || 8 || 7 || 63 |- | 13 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Wharfedale || 29 || 11 || 1 || 17 || 608 || 752 || -144 || 10 || 7 || 63 |-style=\"background- color:#ffcccc;text-align:center;\" | 14 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Redruth (R) || 30 || 12 || 2 || 16 || 633 || 788 || -155 || 6 || 4 || 62 |-style=\"background-color:#ffcccc;text-align:center;\" | 15 || style=\"text- align:left;\" | Otley (R) || 30 || 6 || 0 || 24 || 601 || 829 || -228 || 10 || 11 || 45 |-style=\"background-color:#ffcccc;text-align:center;\" | 16 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Launceston (R) || 30 || 10 || 1 || 19 || 702 || 742 || -40 || 13 || 9 || 44 |- |colspan=\"15\"| *If teams are level at any stage, tiebreakers are applied in the following order: # Number of matches won # Difference between points for and against # Total number of points for # Aggregate number of points scored in matches between tied teams # Number of matches won excluding the first match, then the second and so on until the tie is settled |- |colspan=\"15\" style=\"border:0px\"| Green background is the promotion place.
