Stanley Schrag of Playtime Books and the Sorren brothers of Merit Books recruited Bonfils to paint covers for their sex-novel paperbacks. When Harold W. McCauley retired from Nightstand Books, William Hamling hired Bonfils to replace McCauley and assigned him with setting up a new publishing operation out of San Diego, which was to become Greenleaf Classics, with Bonfils as its Art Director and Earl Kemp as the Editor-in-Chief. During the heyday of sex publishing, Bonfils was producing some fifty covers every month. He retired from the book cover illustration business in the mid-1970s and continues to paint within the gallery community of San Diego.The Bonfils official website The original art for most Greenleaf covers has been lost, with only a few pieces having survived. ==See also== *Pulp magazine *Lesbian pulp fiction *Erotic art *Clandestine literature *Sexual arousal ==Notes== ==External links== *Official website *Earl Kemp's online memoirs *Greenleaf Books website Category:American illustrators Category:1922 births Category:2018 deaths ",
