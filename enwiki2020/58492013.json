She is best known for showing the adversary effect of Bisphenol A (a common substance in plastics) on the reproductive system of mammalians.Hunt, Patricia A., et al. \"Bisphenol A exposure causes meiotic aneuploidy in the female mouse.\" Current biology 13.7 (2003): 546-553 In 2018, her team discovered that replacement Bisphenols (BPS, BPF,BPAF, Diphenyl sulfone) also affects reproductive health, and this over generations.Horan T., et al. \"Replacement Bisphenols Adversely Affect Mouse Gametogenesis with Consequences for Subsequent Generations.\" Current biology 2018 == Career == Patricia Hunt did her undergraduate studies at Michigan State University. She graduated in 1983 from the University of Hawaii with a thesis on reproductive biology under the supervision of Patricia Jacobs. She completed a two-year Postdoc with Paul Burgoyne at the MRC Mammalian Development Unit and a one- year Postdoc with Eva Eicher at the Jackson Laboratory. She began her tenure track with a faculty position at Emory University from 1988 to 1992, then moved to Case Western Reserve University. In 2005, she moved to Washington State University where she is now a Meyer Distinguished Professor in the School of Molecular Biosciences. Her current work centers on the reproductive effects of exposure to chemicals with estrogenic activity. == References == Category:American women academics Category:American ecologists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Michigan State University alumni Category:University of Hawaii alumni Category:Washington State University faculty ",
