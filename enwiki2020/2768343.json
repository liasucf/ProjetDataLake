It has campuses for undergraduate and postgraduate studies in S\u00e3o Paulo (Campus Higien\u00f3polis), Campinas, Barueri (Campus Alphaville), Brasilia, Recife and Rio de Janeiro Founded in 1870 as the American School, Mackenzie is one of the oldest institutions of higher education in Brazil. The university is regarded nationally and internationally as a center of excellence having graduated numerous important names in Brazilian history. ==History== Part of the S\u00e3o Paulo Campus on Maria Ant\u00f4nia Street In 1870, the American Presbyterian missionary Rev. George Whitehill Chamberlain and his wife Mary Annesley founded a private grammar school inside their home. The classes were held in their living room and, a few years later, the \"American School\" was established as a center of excellence in S\u00e3o Paulo. The Chamberlains' American School was revolutionary for the Brazilian standards at that time: no corporal punishment on students was permitted, and both boys and girls could attend classes. Even though the Chamberlains were openly Presbyterians, students from all ethnic backgrounds, social classes, and religious denominations were welcome. The fame of academic rigor allied to religious tolerance soon reached the United States. In 1896, John Theron Mackenzie, an attorney from Phelps, New York, and his sisters donated US$50,000 \"for the establishment of an engineering school to be built under the auspices of Mr. Chamberlain\". The Mackenzie building was built the next year, and the college was named in their honor. After the establishment of Mackenzie College, the institution saw rapid expansion of its activities with the creation of a School of Architecture, a School of Economics, and a Law School, gaining the status of university in 1952.
