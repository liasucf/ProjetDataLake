An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was conducted in 2003 by the Royal Irrigation Department (RID). It was updated in 2009. Nothing further happened until the National Environmental Board (NEB) approved the EIA on 27 May 2016. In December 2019, the Thai cabinet approved the project. Local residents say that the dam is no longer needed, as newer water management infrastructure such as weirs and small check dams have solved drought problems. The site of the dam is now classified as a 1A watershed forest area and locals do not want to see it inundated. The proposed Wang Heeb Dam will cost 2.3 billion baht and will displace 40 families. The RID insists that it must proceed with the project as it has been approved. The government's goal is clear according to one observer: \"...maintaining a firm grip on central control and suppressing local forest management efforts which will dilute their power.\" ==References== ==External links== *amphoe.com ==See also== *List of districts of Thailand *Provinces of Thailand Category:Amphoe of Nakhon Si Thammarat Province ",
