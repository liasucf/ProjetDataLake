The original stage play opened on Broadway February 7, 1922. ==Plot== Florence Eldridge as Anabelle West, imperiled heroine of The Cat and the Canary (1922) The story concerns the death and inheritance of old Cyrus West, a rich eccentric who felt that his relatives \"have watched my wealth as if they were cats, and I \u2014 a canary\". He decrees that his will be read 20 years after his death, at which point his relatives converge at his old family home, now a spooky old haunted mansion. The will reads that his most distant relative still bearing the name of West be sole heir, provided they are legally sane. The rest of the night spent in the house calls into question the sanity of Annabelle West, a fragile young woman who is legally Cyrus West's heir. ==Production== Produced by Kilbourn Gordon and directed by Ira Hards, The Cat and the Canary premiered February 7, 1922, at the National Theatre. It ran 349 performances, closing December 2, 1922. The three-act mystery made a return engagement of 40 performances (April 23 \u2013 May 26, 1923). ===Cast=== The Cat and the Canary cast from left: Blanche Friderici, Henry Hull, Beth Franklyn, Jane Warrington and Florence Eldridge * Percy Moore as Roger Crosby * Blanche Friderici as \"Mammy\" Pleasant * John Willard as Harry Blythe * Beth Franklyn as Susan Sillsby * Jane Warrington as Cicely Young * Ryder Keane as Charles Wilder * Henry Hull as Paul Jones * Florence Eldridge as Annabelle West * Edmund Elton as Hendricks * Harry D.
