    "text": "Daniel Myrick (born September 3, 1963) is an American film director most famous for horror films, especially for co-directing and writing the 1999 psychological horror The Blair Witch Project with Eduardo S\u00e1nchez, for which they won the Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Award. ==Life and career== Myrick was born in Sarasota, Florida. He graduated from University of Central Florida School of Film in 1994. Along with collaborating with future Blair Witch cohorts Eduardo S\u00e1nchez and Gregg Hale on a trilogy of short films, Myrick supported himself by working as an editor and cinematographer on a number of Florida-based music videos and commercials. After he wrote and directed the promo for the Florida Film Festival in 1997, Myrick's work caught the eye of independent film guru John Pierson, helping to set the stage for the eventual 1999 debut of Myrick and Sanchez's first feature as co-writers and directors. In 2006, he co-founded Raw Feed, a direct to DVD division of Warner Home Video that specializes in horror films, with The X-Files executive producer John Shiban and 24 executive producer Tony Krantz. ==Filmography== Feature films * The Blair Witch Project (1999) * Believers (2007) * Solstice (2008) * The Objective (2008) * The Unearthly (TBA) Television films * Under the Bed (2017) Short films * Curse of the Blair Witch (1999) * Sticks and Stones: Investigating the Blair Witch (1999) Web series * The Strand (2006) Television episodes * Split Screen (1997-2000) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sarasota, Florida Category:Horror film directors Category:Independent Spirit Award winners Category:University of Central Florida alumni Category:Film directors from Florida ",
