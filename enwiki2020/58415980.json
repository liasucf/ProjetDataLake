    "text": "Ahrenberg in the 1960s Theodor \"Teto\" Ahrenberg (2 March 1912 \u2013 21 June 1989) was a Swedish businessman and collector. His extensive collection featured works by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall, Le Corbusier, Olle B\u00e6rtling, Sam Francis, Mark Tobey, Christo, Lucio Fontana, Tadeusz Kantor, Enrico Baj, Jean Tinguely and Niki de Saint Phalle. Key works in the collection included the two versions of Matisse's Apollo (1953), Picasso's Nude in a rocking chair (1956) and Chagall's Les mari\u00e9s sous le baldaquin (1949). == Life == === Early life and career === Theodor Ahrenberg, son of Swedish shipping magnate and owner of Th. Ahrenberg Rederi (Th. Ahrenberg Shipping Co.) Ossian Ahrenberg and his wife Na\u00ebma Ahrenberg (born Wijkander), spent his youth in Gothenburg, centred at the family home at Viktor Rydbergsgatan 14. Following moderate academic performance at school, Ahrenberg was withdrawn from H\u00f6gre Samskola by his father, and began working in shipping in Stettin, Hamburg and Newcastle. Ahrenberg later described this training as important preparation for his career as a collector: \u201cYou had to be far-sighted, careful and daring, all at the same time ... and you simply had to succeed. That was the charm of shipping, and in my case, it could be said that such speculative tendencies and audacity ... left their mark on me, even in the new world into which I would enter, that of art.Theodor Ahrenberg, Jag har ju \u00e4nd\u00e5 en Picasso.Memoarer av Teto Ahrenberg, utmanaren, konstsamlaren, mecenaten, Ulla Ahrenberg and Folke Edwards (eds.), Walhstr\u00f6m & Widstrand,Stockholm, 1993, p. 29 In 1939\u201340 Ahrenberg fought as a volunteer in the Swedish forces against Finland in the Winter War against Russia, and was highly decorated. Returning to Gothenburg in 1941 and following the decline of Th. Ahrenberg Shipping Co., Ahrenberg moved to Stockholm to further his career. He first worked inventorying barrels for Nyn\u00e4s Petroleum, then moved to a more senior position at the Trade and Industry Commission, before finally commencing an executive managerial role at the Gas and Coke Economic Federation (GOKEF). === Collecting beginnings === On business trips throughout Europe for GOKEF beginning in the late 1940s, Ahrenberg discovered his passion for modern art and began collecting, with an initial focus on graphic prints including those of Picasso. In time he amassed one of the most important and qualitative private European collections of twentieth-century Western art. From the early 1950s Agnes Widlund (1910\u20132005), founder and director of Gallery Samlaren at Birger Jarlsgatan 1 in Stockholm, began advising Ahrenberg on his collection. Under Widlund's guidance the collection expanded to include works by Matisse, Chagall, Le Corbusier, Georges Braque and Georges Rouault. Widlund arranged visits by Ahrenberg to artists in their studios including Picasso, Matisse, Chagall and Le Corbusier, beginning Ahrenberg's lifelong passion for meeting the artists whose work he collected and purchasing from them directly. === Relationship with Swedish art establishment === Ahrenberg became a central figure in Swedish and European art circles, and held positions including secretary of the Tessin Society and was a board member of art associations including Friends of Nationalmuseum, Friends of Moderna Museet, and Aspect. He dedicated himself to improving conditions for art students and young artists, culminating in his controversial speech \u201cThe Poverty of Art in the Welfare State\u201d made at Aspect's public meeting at Stockholm's Academy of Fine Arts on 3 September 1959. In it he called for more state support for artists and art institutions, and criticized then director of Stockholm's Nationalmuseum Carl Nordenfalk (1907\u201392) for his apprehensive approach to funding. Ahrenberg thus conflicted with Sweden's conservative art institutions, particularly in areas of finance. === Ahrenberg Museum by Le Corbusier === Such disputes, above all with Nordenfalk who rejected Ahrenberg's proposals of December 1959 that the collection be deposited at Nationalmuseum or another Swedish institution, led Ahrenberg to the decision to build his own exhibition space in Stockholm, known as the Palais Ahrenberg or Ahrenberg Museum. In 1961 Le Corbusier, with whom Ahrenberg was on close terms, agreed to design the museum; the plans were presented publicly in 1962.Fondation Le Corbusier: Pavillon d'exposition, palais Ahrenberg, Stockholm, Sweden, 1962, accessed on 6 September 2018 Le Corbusier took his inspiration from a design which he had made two years previously for a similar project in Tokyo and which was ultimately executed in 1964 for the Heidi Weber Museum in Zurich, also known as the \u201cCentre Le Corbusier\u201d. A model of the Ahrenberg Museum, based on Le Corbusier's original plans, has been housed there since 2005.The model (1.50 x 1.80 m / 1:20) was made at RWTH Aachen University under the supervision of Professor Rudolf Bertig. === Loss of collection and relocation to Switzerland === The Ahrenberg Museum was, however, never built, as the Swedish state prosecuted Ahrenberg, controversially confiscated the collection, and sold it in an enforced series of auctions beginning in 1963. Ahrenberg and his wife Ulla (born Ulla Frisell in 1931) and their four children subsequently settled at the house Le Rocher in Chexbres, Switzerland, above the north bank of Lake Geneva, where he began to rebuild the collection. Specifically he established an atelier at Le Rocher where he invited a series of artists of the post-war European avant-garde to live and work, often for several months at a time. Ahrenberg died on 21 June 1989 at the age of 77 in Vevey. == The first collection == Ahrenberg's first collection was at the time one of the most extensive private collections of twentieth-century Western art, comprising around 1,000 works that presented a cross-section of modernism.Tilo Richter: Dabei sein in der K\u00fcche der Kunst \u2013 Theodor Ahrenberg im Portr\u00e4t in the FAS from 21 April 2011. Ahrenberg acquired works by both famous and relatively renowned artists including Henri Matisse (1869\u20131954), Pablo Picasso (1881\u20131973), Georges Braque (1882\u20131963), Marc Chagall (1887\u20131985), Le Corbusier (1887\u20131965), Fernand L\u00e9ger, (1881\u20131955), Alberto Giacometti, (1901\u201366), Henry Moore (1898\u20131986), Mark Tobey (1890\u20131976), among other, non-established figures. According to Ulla Ahrenberg the collection at its height featured alone hundreds of works by Picasso and nearly all of Matisse's sculptures.Tilo Richter: Dabei sein in der K\u00fcche der Kunst \u2013 Theodor Ahrenberg im Portr\u00e4t in the FAS from 21 April 2011.Wolfgang B\u00fcscher: Dann nahmen sie Teto mit \u2013 Wie Picassos Freund seine weltber\u00fchmte Sammlung verlor in Blau (Kunstmagazin der Welt), pp. 48\u201355, May/June 2015. Ahrenberg also passionately supported his sometimes controversial fellow Swedish artists, including Carl Kylberg, Olle B\u00e6rtling, Einar Hylander, \u00d6yvind Fahlstr\u00f6m, Richard Mortensen, Robert Jacobsen and Carl Fredrik Reutersw\u00e4rd. Another focus was artists from Eastern Europe whose practice was then limited by restrictive state policies behind the Iron Curtain, in particular Tadeusz Kantor (1915\u201390). Ahrenberg's outspoken support for such artists at this time only increased the tension between himself and the conservative art establishment.Carin St\u00e5hlberg: Fel man p\u00e5 fel plats vid fel tid (Wrong Man at the Wrong Place at the Wrong Time ) in Dagens Nyheter, 19 June 1993. The value of the collection today has been estimated at over a billion Euros. == The second collection == Ahrenberg's second collection comprised mainly works by artists who were guests at the Le Rocher atelier. These were primarily friends and included Sam Francis, Christo, Lucio Fontana, Jean Tinguely, Niki de Saint Phalle, Arman, Robert Rauschenberg, Mark Tobey, Enrico Baj, Yaacov Agam and Heinrich Richter. The character of the second collection stands in stark contrast to that of the first, which had provided an overview of modernism through Ahrenberg's choices. In art critic Folke Edward's words the new collection \u201cshowed a playful, experimental and personal character; it is a subjective and spontaneous, not shaped by a desire to present an objective or qualitative overview.\u201d In time Ahrenberg's second collection grew to encompass around 6,000 objects, among them curiosities and experimental works such as the ceramics (including plates, bowls, piggy banks and ashtrays) and wine labels \u2013 all idiosyncratically and often whimsically decorated by artists visiting Le Rocher, including Albert Chubac, Lars Gynning, G\u00e9rard \u201cImof\u201d Imhof, Julio Zapata, Roberto Crippa and Ricci Riggenbach. After Theodor Ahrenberg's death in 1989, Ulla Ahrenberg has continued her role as custodian and archivist of the collection. Their son Staffan Ahrenberg, a successful Hollywood producer and entrepreneur, continues his father's collecting tradition; his own collection includes contemporary American and European art, such as that of Richard Serra, Robert Longo, Wolfgang Tillmans, Cildo Meireles, Jenny Holzer, Martin Kippenberger and Adri\u00e1n Villar Rojas. In October 2012 Staffan Ahrenberg relaunched the renowned French art and literature journal Cahiers d'art. In September 2018 the first comprehensive monograph of Theodor Ahrenberg's life and collections was published in English as Living with Picasso, Matisse and Christo: Theodor Ahrenberg and His Collections by Thames & Hudson, London; and in Swedish as Ett liv med Matisse, Picasso och Christo \u2013 Theodor Ahrenberg och hans samlingar by Arvinius + Orfeus Publishing, Stockholm. == Selected exhibitions == * 1954 Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, \u201cModern Utl\u00e4ndsk Konst ur Svenska Privatsamlingar\u201d (Foreign Modern Art from Swedish Private Collections) * 1957 Nationalmuseum, Stockholm * 1957 Sk\u00e5nska Konstmuseum, Lund * 1957 Konsthallen Helsingfors, Helsinki * 1958 Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Li\u00e8ge * 1959 Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich * 1960 G\u00f6teborgs Konstf\u00f6rening, Konsthallen, Gothenburg * 1961 Frederiksberg Radhus, Copenhagen * 1967 Salle communale de Chexbres, \u201caspects\u201d * 1977 Kunstverein f\u00fcr die Rheinlande und Westfalen, D\u00fcsseldorf \u201cDer Sammler Theodor Ahrenberg und das Atelier in Chexbres. 15 Jahre mit Kunst und K\u00fcnstlern. 1960\u20131975\u201d * 1987 Kunsthalle Schirn Frankfurt/Main, \u201cLe Corbusier secret.
