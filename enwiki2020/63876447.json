There are many symmetric forms, and the ones with highest symmetry have chiral icosahedral symmetry: Four Catalan solids, convex: * Triakis octahedron - isosceles triangles * Tetrakis hexahedron - isosceles triangles * Deltoidal icositetrahedron - kites * Pentagonal icositetrahedron - pentagons 27 uniform star-polyhedral duals: (self-intersecting) * Small rhombihexacron, Great rhombihexacron * Small hexacronic icositetrahedron, Great hexacronic icositetrahedron * Great deltoidal icositetrahedron * Great triakis octahedron == References == * Category:Polyhedra ",
