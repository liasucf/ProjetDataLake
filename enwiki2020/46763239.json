    "text": "The Milli Yakjehti Council (, MYC, also called the National Alliance for Religious Harmony) is a Pakistani non-political alliance of political and non- political religious parties formed in 1995 on the advise of Maulana Naeem Siddiqui(the founder of tehreek e islami) to unite religious parties and reduce sectarian tensions in the nation. In 1996, the MYC adopted a resolution objecting to a planned Pakistan nuclear treaty, and calling for a nuclear device to be tested. In 2012, the party was described as \"recently revived\", and elected former Jamiat-i-Islami chief Qazi Hussain Ahmed as president. ==References== Category:Political parties in Pakistan Category:Political parties established in 1995 Category:1995 establishments in Pakistan ",
