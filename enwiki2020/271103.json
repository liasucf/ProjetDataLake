    "text": "Angrbo\u00f0a (also Angrboda) is a j\u00f6tunn in Norse mythology. She is the mate of Loki and the mother of monsters. Angrbo\u00f0a is only mentioned once in the Poetic Edda (V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 hin skamma) as the mother of Fenrir by Loki. She is also described in the Prose Edda (Gylfaginning) as \"a giantess in J\u00f6tunheimar\" and as the mother of three monsters: the wolf Fenrir, the Midgard serpent J\u00f6rmungand, and the ruler of the dead Hel. ==Name== The Old Norse name Angrbo\u00f0a has been translated as 'the one who brings grief', 'she-who-offers- sorrow', or 'harm-bidder'. ==Attestations== === Angrbo\u00f0a === In V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 hin skamma (Short V\u00f6lusp\u00e1; a poem of Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0), Angrbo\u00f0a is mentioned as the mate of Loki and mother of the wolf (Fenrir). Gylfaginning (Beguiling of Gylfi) mentions the three monstrous children of Angrbo\u00f0a: the wolf Fenrir, the Midgard serpent J\u00f6rmungand, and the ruler of the dead Hel. ===Giantess in Ironwood=== V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 (Prophecy of the V\u00f6lva) also mentions a j\u00f6tunn living in J\u00e1rnvid (Ironwood, the forest where female j\u00f6tnar live), most likely identified with Angrbo\u00f0a. This stanza is paraphrased by Snorri Sturluson in Gylfaginning. In the stanza 42 of V\u00f6lusp\u00e1, Egg\u00fe\u00e9r is portrayed as the herder of the j\u00f6tunn who lives in J\u00e1rnvi\u00f0r (Ironwood), perhaps her wolf-herder. == Theories == According to scholar Andy Orchard, \"[w]hatever the antiquity of the notion that these three monsters were born of Loki and a giantess, the name Angrboda seems to date from no earlier than the twelfth century.\" ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * Category:G\u00fdgjar ",
