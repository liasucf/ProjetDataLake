    "text": "Winifred Doris Blackwell, better known as Doris Blackwell (1 May 1891 \u2013 14 January 1983), was the eldest child and daughter of Thomas Bradshaw, the post master and officer-in-charge of the Alice Springs Telegraph Station from 1899\u20131908, and his wife Atalanta Bradshaw (n\u00e9e Allchurch). In the 1960s Blackwell worked with journalist Douglas Lockwood to write Alice on the Line, which was first published in 1965, about the families life on the old telegraph line. == Life in the Northern Territory == Blackwell was born in 1891 in Adelaide, South Australia and, as an 8-year-old girl, moved to Alice Springs, then known as Stuart, with her family (then with 3 siblings; this would expand to 6 in their 9 years at the telegraph station) where her father was to work at the Alice Springs Telegraph Station; replacing Frank Gillen. The journey to Alice Springs was a long and difficult one with a train ride until Oodnadatta followed by a buggy ride of more than 300 miles and making camp along the way. Blackwell remembers this journey as the 'greatest adventure of her young life' although, equally, she states that the novelty soon wore off. She said: Upon their arrival in Alice Springs Blackwell soon found herself greatly enjoying life there saying that 'Alice's tranquil charm converted all of us to her side' and she would ride out daily on her horse to explore her surroundings. Do to the lack of any established school in the area her mother, Atalanta (known almost universally as Attie) employed a governess and set up a schoolroom next door to the staff dining room which doubled as a courtroom as her father was also the local magistrate. In addition to the governess (of which there were several over their time in Alice Springs; including Mabel Mary Taylor) the family employed a number of Aboriginal people within their household with Blackwell recalling that: One significant figure in this time was Amelia Kunoth, the grandmother of Rosalie Kunoth-Monks, who worked as a companion and nurse for the children as a young girl. She was heartbroken when the family left in 1908 and requested to go with them; the Bradshaw's denied her request, believing that it would be a mistake to take her away from her people and her land. == Later life == Even having left Alice Springs at 18 it is said that Blackwell never lost the 'spell of the inland' and in 1922 she married Alex Blackwell, a World War I veteran who served as a stretcher-bearer in Europe alongside her brother Mort. She died on 14 January 1983 in Adelaide and is buried in Brighton (Saint Jude) cemetery. == Publications == Alice on the Line / Doris Blackwell and Douglas Lockwood == References == Category:1891 births Category:1983 deaths Category:People from Alice Springs ",
