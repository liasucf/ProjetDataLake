He gained a large part of his fortune through his backing of King, the firm behind the mobile game Candy Crush Saga. He was born and raised in the Littleover area of Derby. Out of school, he first worked as a tile and flooring manager at a company he helped to establish in Spain, before venturing into entrepreneurship. After leaving the flooring firm, he returned to the UK to develop a dating website called uDate, which he went on to sell for \u00a3100 million. He used the money secured from the sale to invest in Prevx, an internet security firm, which was later sold to Webroot.

On the Sunday Times Rich List, Morris sits tied for 228th place. He bought out Derby County's previous owner, the United States holding company American Partners, in September 2015. He first bought into the club in May 2014 for a 22% stake, shortly after the club's 2014 Football League Championship play-off Final defeat to the Queens Park Rangers. He has been involved in a league-wide push to increase TV revenue for non-Premier League clubs.
