Ghlam is denying the accusations. == The case == On 19 April 2015, Aur\u00e9lie Ch\u00e2telain, a dance instructor, was found shot dead in her burnt-out car in Villejuif, outside Paris. Sid Ahmed Ghlam, a French-Algerian student, shortly after sought medical help in Paris for gun wounds in one of his arms. His behaviour raised suspicion, leading French authorities to check his car, a Renault M\u00e9gane where they found a Kalashnikov rifle, a revolver and a bullet proof vest. In his apartment they found three more Kalashnikovs and another weapon. He was detained at the hospital. Information found in Ghlam\u2019s home and on his telephone led the police to believe he was planning an immediate attack on a church, being instructed by a French-speaking man in Syria. Allegedly, he had a list of further target churches, including the Sacre Coeur in Paris and, the Daily Express claimed, Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray in Normandy that was attacked in July 26 2016. Ghlam had according to the police been in Turkey in February the same year, and at the time expressed a wish to go to Syria. He had been warned by police when he returned from Turkey, but had not been considered a serious security risk by the authorities.Soren Seelow (3 August 2015) Sid Ahmed Ghlam, entre les mailles du filet Le Monde Some days after the incident, Ghlam was charged with murder, attempted murder, association with criminals with a view to commit crimes against people and other crimes \u201cconnected to a terrorist organisation\u201d.Kim Willsher (24 April 2015) French student charged with murder and links to a terrorist organisation The Guardian Le Monde reported that Ghlam's arrest stopped him from following through on his next targets, which possibly were the two churches of Villejuif and/or the Sacr\u00e9- C\u0153ur Basilica. Ghlam's DNA was found on Ch\u00e2telain and in the car where she died. The authorities have not identified a clear motive for the alleged murder. Initially, they suggested Ghlam might have tried to steal her car. Another possible motive that has been put forward is that Ghlam might have mistaken her for being an official spying on him. The shots were fired at her from outside the car.
