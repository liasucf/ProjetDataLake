    "text": "Matthew Jonathan Darey (born 29 November 1968) is an English trance music producer and a member of Lost Tribe. He is known for his work in the Euphoria trance series and for \"Gamemaster\" (as Lost Tribe) and his remixes of Agnelli & Nelson's \"El Ni\u00f1o\". In 2005, his first major US albums, an EP, Point Zero (featuring the Li Kwan song of the same name), and a double album, Upfront Trance, were released. Darey has sold over two million albums and singles with numerous top 10 and top 20 chart hits. ==Career== He was born in Leicester, England. Darey frequently performs his trance sets at UK clubs such as Gatecrasher and Slinky, and over the internet through a monthly show on Digitally Imported's European Trance station. On 13 August 2005, he debuted a new show on Digitally Imported called Nocturnal, which became a weekly show in April 2006. }} His single \"Beautiful Day\", featuring Antoine & Marcia Juell, became a club hit in the US, reaching the Top 25 on Billboard's Hot Dance Music Club Play and hitting the Top 20 on the Hot Dance Airplay chart. Darey owns a record label, Darey Products, featuring releases from himself and upcoming artists. Darey wrote and produced the raga house track by Orgasmatron entitled \"Rock the Disco\", which was released on Universal Records in 1997. At the end of 2015, he made the decision to change his stage name to Matt Nouveau, due to the deeper style of music he produces now. ==Discography== ===Albums and EPs=== These are the albums that Matt Darey has released under his own name, as opposed to the albums by 'various artists' that he has mixed. * Voice of an Angel EP (2004, Incentive Records) * Point Zero EP (2005, Water Music Records) * Decade (2004; also released a 200-copy limited-edition version) * Urban Astronauts \u2013 EP1 (31 March 2008; Koch Records) The debut EP from Matt Darey's new rocktronica project Urban * Matt Darey pres.
