An engagement of Jungwirth in the Stadttheater Klagenfurt did not come about because he had to do military service. Therefore he had his debut at the Romanian National Opera, Bucharest. Still in 1942 and then again from the end of the war until 1949 he was engaged at the Tyrolean State Theatre, where he also studied musicology and obtained his doctorate in this discipline in 1948.Manfred Jungwirth: Die historische Funktion des Ba\u00df-Buffo in stimmtechnischer Beleuchtung, Innsbruck, phil.

Mozart, Richard Strauss, Otto Nicolai, Gioacchino Rossini and Bed\u0159ich Smetana.
