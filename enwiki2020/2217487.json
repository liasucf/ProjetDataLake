    "text": "GG45 (GigaGate 45) or ARJ45 (Augmented RJ45) are names given to a connector for high-speed Category 7 cable LAN cabling, originally developed by Nexans. GG45 provides backwards compatibility for standard 8P8C connectors (often colloquially called RJ45). It has been standarized by the IEC as IEC 61076-3-110.IEC Webstore: International standard IEC 61076-3-110 Connectors for electronic equipment - Product requirements - Part 3-110: Rectangular connectors \u2014 Detail specification for shielded, free and fixed connectors for data transmissions with frequencies up to 1000MHz, Edition 1.0, December 2007; ( ) The GG45/ARJ45 connector operates in the frequency spectrum between 600 MHz to 5 GHz with shielded twisted pair and twinax cables. To reduce cross talk, two of the four pairs are moved so that each pair occupies one corner. A protrusion on the socket is designed to activate a switch on the jack for the alternative contact positions. Combined with an internal system of Faraday cages, the GG45 interface therefore has plenty of headroom, plus the ability to migrate to higher speed service by upgrading to Category 7A patch cords that activate the switch in the jack., section A step further GG45/ARJ45 typically comes in two flavors: * GG45 or ARJ45 HD is the full connector with 12 contacts, providing a Category 6 cable interface (100/250 MHz) for older devices as well as the new interface. * ARJ45 HS is the version without the Cat 6-compatible contacts, for a total of 8 contacts. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 |\u203e\u203e\u2588\u203e\u2588\u203e\u2588\u203e\u2588\u203e\u2588\u203e\u2588\u203e\u2588\u203e\u2588\u203e\u203e| Pinout of GG45 and ARJ45 HD sockets.
