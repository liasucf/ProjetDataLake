    "text": "The Soviet Athletics Championships () was an annual outdoor track and field competition organised by the Soviet Athletics Federation, which served as the Soviet national championship for the sport. The early history of event traces back to two events organised by a Moscow-based skiing club: this was first held in 1920 for men only. Following the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, the next two editions in 1923 and 1924 increased in size and were held as an All-Union sports festival. A marked increase came in 1928 when 1281 athletes competed, drawing from five Union Republics, 12 regions of the Russian SDSSR and 11 foreign delegations. The event was held consistently every year from 1943 onwards. The athletics competition was incorporated into the quadrennial Spartakiad of Peoples of the USSR during the latter event's lifespan from 1956 to 1991 (with the exception of 1986).Soviet Championships. GBR Athletics. Retrieved 26 August 2016. The event programme typically was close to that featured in the Olympic Games athletics competition, though the marathon, road racewalking, and combined track and field events were usually held at separate championships. It was common for there to be both an individual Soviet Championships and a national athletics championship for clubs.\u0410\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432 \u0410.\u041c., \u041e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0420.\u0412. \u0438 \u0434\u0440. \u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041c.: \u0424\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442, 1971 384 \u0441.\u041b\u0451\u0433\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430. \u0421\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a / \u0421\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0420. \u0412. \u041e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432. \u2013 \u041c.: \"\u0424\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\", 1983. \u2013 392 \u0441.
