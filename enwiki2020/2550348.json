It was founded in 1966 and is named after the 28th Sultan of Brunei, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III. == Location == The school is located on Jalan Muara, close to the Brunei International Airport, commercial areas and two other educational institutions - Berakas Secondary School and the Sultan Saiful Rijal Campus of the Institute of Brunei Technical Education. ==History== Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Science College began as (First Malay Secondary School) in the then Brunei Town in 1966. Upper secondary level (Form 4) was introduced in the school in 1967 while sixth form was introduced two years later. In 1969, the school moved from Brunei Town to an area along Jalan Muara. On 23 September 1971 the school was officially renamed as (Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Malay College). It was inaugurated by the late Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III, the 28th Sultan of Brunei and the father of the current Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. Bilingual education policy was implemented in 1974 and English medium classes were introduced. Two years later science education was started. The school was then again renamed as (Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Malay College/Science School). In 1985, the status of the school was upgraded to a college to acknowledge the inclusion of the sixth form and the school finally adopted the current name. In 1994, the college moved to a new campus in the Rimba area on the outskirts of Bandar Seri Begawan. After renovations of the old Muara campus was completed, the college moved back to it on 2 April 2005. The Rimba campus was turned into the Rimba Secondary School. Starting from 2007, classes for Form 1 (now known as Year 7) students were scheduled in the afternoon due to a shortage of classrooms. In 2008, Year 8 students were also scheduled in the afternoon session. Year 7 students in 2008 were the first batch to try out the scheme of work for SPN21 (Sistem Pendidikan Negara Abad Ke-21). ==Enrolment and structure== Entry to the college requires grade \"A\" in all five subjects (hence more commonly known as \"5 'A's\") of the Primary School Assessment ( or '), the national examination taken at the end of Year 6 in primary school. The school operates in a two sub-school structure. The secondary school caters for students in years 7 to 10, whilst the Sixth Form Centre caters for students in Lower and Upper Six. The school enrolls students only for Year 7 every year, prohibiting entries for other years. Only current enrolled Year 7 students are allowed to proceed to upper levels. The size of classes vary each year, depending on the entrance quotas. ==Uniform== The school uniform for boys consists of purple pants for years 7 to 10 and grey pants for sixth form students, white MIB shirt with embroidered school logo and a black songkok. Girls' uniforms are long white and lavender checkered skirt for years 7 to 10 and long grey skirt for sixth form students, white dress and a school embroidered square tudong. Members of the student councils wear the same uniform with the exception of the colour of their pants and long skirts, which are navy blue. A different uniform applies for physical education classes. ==Extracurricular activities== Aside from academics, the school provides a wide range of extracurricular activities for its students.
