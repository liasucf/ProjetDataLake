    "text": "Moyne is a townland in the praish of Shrule in County Mayo, Ireland. It is bordered by Cloghmoyne and Gortbrack townlands to the west, by Toorard, Barnaboy, and Ross, County Mayo to the east. To the south is county Galway. Moyne townland contains a graveyard, ruined church, and a pair of standing stones inside a stone enclosure. Surface traces of internal divisions were detected in a well known aerial photograph published in 1969. The early Christian Moyne church may have Patrician foundation. In the original Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii, T\u00edrech\u00e1n said Saint Patrick established churches in Conmaicne Cuile Tolad. This church site should not be confused with the famous Moyne Abbey in Tirawley, north Mayo. == References == ==Secondary references== * * Category:Townlands of County Mayo ",
