    "text": "Raw Saucisse de Toulouse Saucisse de Toulouse or \"Toulouse Sausage\" is a fresh sausage originating from Toulouse in the southwest of France. It is made from pork (75% lean, 25% belly), salt and pepper, and usually various additives, has a natural casing of about 3cm in diameter and is usually sold in a coil (like Cumberland Sausage). It is an ingredient of most Cassoulet recipes and is also served grilled or confit. Saucisse de Toulouse does not have a protected status so variations on the original recipe can be sold under the same name. Producer's organisations have proposed a Label Rouge designation for the product. ==See also== * List of sausages * Botifarra ==References== Category:French sausages Category:French cuisine ",
