    "text": "The 1946 World Series was played in October 1946 between the St. Louis Cardinals (representing the National League) and the Boston Red Sox (representing the American League). This was the Red Sox's first appearance in a World Series since their championship of . In the eighth inning of Game 7, with the score 3\u20133, the Cardinals' Enos Slaughter opened the inning with a single but two batters failed to advance him. With two outs, Harry Walker walloped a hit over Johnny Pesky's head into left-center field. As Leon Culberson chased it down, Slaughter started his \"mad dash\". Pesky caught Culberson's throw, turned and\u2014perhaps surprised to see Slaughter headed for the plate\u2014supposedly hesitated just a split second before throwing home. Roy Partee had to take a few steps up the third base line to catch Pesky's toss, but Slaughter was safe without a play at the plate and Walker was credited with an RBI double. The Cardinals won the game and the Series in seven games, giving them their sixth championship. Boston superstar Ted Williams played in the Series injured and was largely ineffective but refused to use his injury as an excuse. He hit only .200 in 25 at-bats with just one RBI in his only World Series appearance in his career. As the first World Series to be played after wartime travel restrictions had been lifted, it returned from the 3-4 format to the 2\u20133\u20132 format for home teams, which has been used since. It also saw the return of many prominent players from military service. ==Summary== Sportsman's Park during the 1946 World Series ==Matchups== ===Game 1=== Rudy York The Red Sox struck first in Game 1 when Pinky Higgins followed a hit-by- pitch and walk in the second with an RBI single off Howie Pollet. The Cardinals tied the game in the sixth when Red Schoendienst singled, moved to second on a ground out, and scored on Stan Musial's double off Tex Hughson. They took the lead in the eighth when Whitey Kurowski singled with two outs and scored on Joe Garagiola's double. Pollet was a strike away from closing the game when Tom McBride tied the game with an RBI single with two on. Rudy York hit a home run into the left field bleachers in the tenth to put the Red Sox up 3\u20132. Earl Johnson pitched two shutout innings to close to give Boston a 1\u20130 series lead. ===Game 2=== Harry Brecheen The Cardinals struck first in Game 2 when Del Rice hit a leadoff double in the third off Mickey Harris and scored on Harry Brecheen's single. They added to their lead in the fifth with two unearned runs on Terry Moore's RBI single with two on followed by Stan Musial's groundout.

They added another run in the eighth off Ted Wilks when Red Schoendienst misplayed Hal Wagner's ground ball with two on. Dave Ferriss pitched a complete game shutout to give the Red Sox a 2\u20131 series lead. ===Game 4=== Whitey Kurowski This is the only game in World Series history that three players on the same team (St. Louis) had four or more hits (Enos Slaughter, Whitey Kurowski and Joe Garagiola had four each). Red Sox outfielder Wally Moses got four hits as well and second baseman Bobby Doerr hit a two-run home run and would hit .409 in the Series. Enos Slaughter's lead-off home run in the second off Tex Hughson put the Cardinals up 1\u20130. Whitey Kurowski doubled and scored on Harry Walker's single. Walker moved to third on an error before scoring on Marty Marion's groundout. Next inning, Stan Musial's two-run double extended the Cardinals' lead to 5\u20130. Jim Bagby relieved Hughson and allowed a two-out RBI single to Garagiola. The Red Sox got on the board in the fourth when Ted Williams singled off Red Munger and scored on Rudy York's double, but the Cardinals got that run back in the fifth on back-to-back doubles by Enos Slaughter and Kurowski. Garagiolas's RBI double in the seventh off Bill Zuber made it 8\u20131 Cardinals. Bobby Doerr hit a two-run home run in the eighth, but the Cardinals put the game out of reach in the ninth. Three straight singles to lead off made it 9\u20133 Cardinals. Mike Ryba relieved Mace Brown and allowed a two-run double to Marty Marion, then an error on Red Schoendienst's ground ball scored the last run of the game. Munger pitched a complete game to tie the series for St. Louis. ===Game 5=== Ted Williams Ted Williams hit a RBI single, his only RBI of the whole Series, in the first off Howie Pollet. After the Cardinals tied the game in the second on Harry Walker's RBI double after an error off Joe Dobson, Don Gutteridge's RBI single off Al Brazle in the bottom of the inning put the Red Sox back up 2\u20131. Leon Culberson's home run in the sixth made it 3\u20131 Red Sox. Next inning, after a double, strikeout and intentional walk, Pinky Higgins's RBI double made it 4\u20131 Red Sox. After another intentional walk loaded the bases, shortstop Marty Marion's errant throw to second on Roy Partee's ground ball allowed two more runs to score. Dobson allowed a two-run single in the ninth to Harry Walker before retiring Marion to end the game and put the Red Sox one win away from the championship. ===Game 6=== Marty Marion St. Louis staved off elimination at home, chasing Boston starter Mickey Harris with a three-run third. With two on and one out, Terry Moore's sacrifice fly scored the game's first run. After a single, back- to-back RBI singles by Whitey Kurowski and Enos Slaughter made it 3\u20130 Cardinals. The Red Sox scored their only run of the game in the seventh when Rudy York hit a leadoff triple and scored on Bobby Doerr's sacrifice fly. Marty Marion added an RBI double in the eighth off Earl Johnson to back Harry Brecheen's second win of the Series. ===Game 7=== Enos Slaughter The Red Sox struck first in Game 7 on Dom DiMaggio's sacrifice fly after two leadoff singles off Murry Dickson. The Cardinals tied the game in the second when Whitey Kurowski hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Harry Walker's sacrifice fly off Dave Ferriss. In the fifth, Walker hit a leadoff single and scored on a double by Dickson, who scored on Red Schoendienst's single. The Cardinals led 3\u20131 in the eighth inning when Dom DiMaggio tied the game with a two-run double but was pulled from the game after pulling a hamstring and Leon Culberson took his position in the center field. In the bottom of the frame, Enos Slaughter scored from first base on a play called the Mad Dash. As the runner started, Walker lined the ball to left-center field, where Culberson fielded the ball. As he threw a relay to shortstop Johnny Pesky, Slaughter rounded third base, ignored third base coach Mike Gonz\u00e1lez's stop sign, and continued for home plate. What exactly happened when Pesky turned around is still a matter of contention. Some claim that Pesky, assuming that Slaughter would not be running home, checked Walker at first base instead of immediately firing home, while others contend that Pesky was so shocked to see Slaughter on his way to score that he had a mental lapse that accounted for the delay. Whatever the reason, the delay and a weak and rushed throw home allowed Slaughter to score just as Red Sox catcher Roy Partee caught it up the line from home plate. The run put the Cardinals ahead 4\u20133 and proved to be the winning run. Harry \"The Cat\" Brecheen had come out of the bullpen during Boston's rally in the eighth when the Red Sox had two men on base, and he gave up the double by DiMaggio that tied the game. Brecheen allowed two singles to start the ninth inning, but then retired the Red Sox without giving up a run, to record his third victory of the Series. ==Composite box== 1946 World Series (4\u20133): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.) over Boston Red Sox (A.L.) ==Highlights== 300px *This was the first World Series appearance for the Red Sox since , and it would be their last appearance until , when they would again lose to the Cardinals in seven games.

It was officially scored a double. *This was the first World Series in which the final out in Game 7 came with the tying run on third base. ==Notes== ==See also== *1946 Negro World Series ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Baseball's 25 Greatest Moments: Enos Slaughter's Mad Dash Category:World Series World Series Category:St. Louis Cardinals postseason Category:Boston Red Sox postseason World Series World Series Category:1940s in Boston Category:1940s in St. Louis Category:October 1946 sports events Category:Sports competitions in Boston Category:Sports competitions in St. Louis ",
