    "text": "Omicron\u00b9 Eridani (\u03bf\u00b9 Eridani, abbreviated Omicron\u00b9 Eri, \u03bf\u00b9 Eri), also named Beid , is a variable star in the constellation of Eridanus. With an average apparent visual magnitude of 4.04, it is visible to the naked eye on a clear, dark night. Based upon parallax measurements, it lies approximately 122 light- years from the Sun. ==Nomenclature== \u03bf\u00b9 Eridani (Latinised to Omicron\u00b9 Eridani) is the star's Bayer designation. The system bears the traditional name Beid derived from the Arabic word \u0628\u064a\u0636 meaning \"eggs\" (cf. neighboring Keid \"(egg)shells\"). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Beid for this star on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. In Chinese, (), meaning Interpreters of Nine Dialects, refers to an asterism consisting of Omicron\u00b9 Eridani, 39 Eridani, Xi Eridani, Nu Eridani, 56 Eridani and 55 Eridani. \u4e2d\u570b\u661f\u5ea7\u795e\u8a71, written by \u9673\u4e45\u91d1.

Accessed on line November 23, 2010. == Properties == Omicron\u00b9 Eridani is an evolved F-type giant star with a stellar classification of F0 III. It is a Delta Scuti variable star that undergoes non-radial pulsations, with a variation of just 0.03 magnitude over a period of 0.0747 days. The star is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 108.1 km/s and a rotation period of less than around 1.9 days. This is creating an equatorial bulge that is 11% wider than the polar radius. Omicron\u00b9 Eridani has nearly double the mass of the Sun, 3.7 times the Sun's radius, and shines with 27 times the solar luminosity from an outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 6,963 K. ==References== ==External links== * Category:F-type giants Category:Delta Scuti variables Category:Eridanus (constellation) Beid Eridani, Omicron1 Eridani, 38 026574 019587 1298 Category:Durchmusterung objects ",
