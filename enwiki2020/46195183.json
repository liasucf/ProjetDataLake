The site was formerly the park of Danesbury House, and it still has some large mature trees which are important to wildlife, especially bats, owls, insects and fungi. The park also has grassland with many varieties of flowering plants, and which is managed by rare-breed cattle, and occasionally by cutting. There is access from a number of roads including Codicote Road. Another Local Nature Reserve, Singlers Marsh is on the other side of Codicote Road. ==References== Category:Local Nature Reserves in Hertfordshire Category:Welwyn Hatfield ",
