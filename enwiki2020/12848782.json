    "text": "Charles Ernest Poynter (8 February 1939 \u2013 20 August 2007) was the mayor of Wanganui from 1986 to 2004. He was prominent in opposing the M\u0101ori occupation of Moutoa Gardens in 1995. ==Biography== Poynter was born in 1939. As a boy, he was \"inquisitive, totally mischievous\" and \"always the leader and organiser\". He was a bookseller\u2014a business he inherited from his father and located in Victoria Avenue, the main shopping area of Wanganui. He was elected to the Wanganui City Council as a councillor in 1977, re-elected in 1980 and stood for the mayoralty in 1983 upon the retirement of Mayor Ron Russell. He polled as runner-up to Doug Turney and was made deputy mayor in 1983 as a consequence. In 1986, he challenged Turney and was successful, winning with a majority of 1529 votes. In 1989 he increased his majority, defeating challenger John Blaikie by almost 6,000 votes. This was the first election under the new local government boundaries with Wanganui City incorporating Wanganui County and some of Waitotara County. Blaikie was the chairman of the Wanganui County Council prior to the reorganisation. The new territorial authority was named 'Wanganui District Council'. In 1992, Poynter was challenged by Wanganui greengrocer Randhir Dahya, a popular Indian businessman. His majority was cut to just 939 votes (Wanganui Chronicle of 20 October 1992). Dahya challenged him twice more, in 1995 and 1998, but Poynter easily resisted these challenges, assisted by his handling of the Moutoa Gardens occupation of 1995 and the unfortunate death of his wife of 40 years, Joy, four months prior to the 1998 election. By 2001, the writing was on the wall and he regained the mayoralty with just 27% of the vote, warding off four councillor challengers. In 2004, he stood again and was defeated, polling third behind media personality Michael Laws and businessman John Martin with just 20% of the vote. Poynter was chairman of Wanganui Gas from its inception in 1992 until his retirement from the role on 14 December 2005. In the 1993 New Year Honours, Poynter was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. He died in 2007 from cancer. He was survived by two daughters and a son. Consultation was carried out in 2009 by Wanganui District Council to rename Wikitoria Road, connecting State Highway 3 and Wanganui Airport, to Chas Poynter Drive. Wikitoria was a daughter of Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui who was named after Queen Victoria, and the Putiki iwi strongly objected to it. The proposal did not go ahead. ==References== Category:1939 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Deaths from lung disease Category:Mayors of Wanganui Category:Deputy mayors of places in New Zealand Category:Companions of the Queen's Service Order Category:20th-century New Zealand politicians Category:New Zealand justices of the peace ",
