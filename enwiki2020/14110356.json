    "text": "The 1871 Boston Red Stockings season was the inaugural season of the franchise. They were formed in 1871 by Boston businessman and Ashburnham native Ivers Whitney Adams. The team was composed of former players of the defunct Cincinnati Red Stockings franchise, who were brought to Boston and kept the name with them. Led and managed by baseball pioneer Harry Wright, the new Boston team would join the newly formed National Association of Professional Base Ball Players for the 1871 season and finish the year in third place with a record of 20\u201310. Pitcher Al Spalding started all 31 of the Red Stockings' games and led the NA with 19 wins. Catcher Cal McVey finished second in the league batting race with a .431 average. From this team, Harry Wright, Al Spalding, and shortstop George Wright have all been elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame. == Regular season == === Season standings === === Record vs. opponents === === Roster === {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font- size: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #0f437c; color: #FFFFFF; text-align: center;\" | 1871 Boston Red Stockings |- | colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color:#af0039; color: white; text-align: center;\" | Roster |- | valign=\"top\" | Pitchers * * | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Catchers * Infielders * * * * * | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Outfielders * * * * | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Manager * |} == Player stats == === Batting === ==== Starters by position ==== Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | Pos ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | AB ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | H ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | Avg. ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | HR ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | RBI |- align=\"center\" | C || || 29 || 153 || 66 || .431 || 0 || 43 |- align=\"center\" | 1B || || 31 || 151 || 43 || .285 || 2 || 32 |- align=\"center\" | 2B || || 31 || 157 || 63 || .401 || 0 || 34 |- align=\"center\" | SS || || 16 || 80 || 33 || .413 || 0 || 11 |- align=\"center\" | 3B || || 31 || 149 || 42 || .282 || 0 || 28 |- align=\"center\" | OF || || 19 || 77 || 20 || .260 || 0 || 16 |- align=\"center\" | OF || || 29 || 152 || 46 || .303 || 0 || 24 |- align=\"center\" | OF || || 31 || 147 || 44 || .299 || 0 || 26 |} ==== Other batters ==== Note: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | AB ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | H ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | Avg. ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | HR ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | RBI |- align=\"center\" | || 18 || 86 || 13 || .151 || 0 || 11 |- align=\"center\" | || 16 || 76 || 17 || .224 || 0 || 11 |} === Pitching === ==== Starting pitchers ==== Note: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | IP ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO |- align=\"center\" | || 31 || 257.1 || 19 || 10 || 3.36 || 23 |} ==== Relief pitchers ==== Note: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | IP ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO |- align=\"center\" | || 9 || 18.2 || 1 || 0 || 6.27 || 0 |} == References == * *1871 Boston Red Stockings season at Baseball Reference Category:Boston Red Stockings seasons Category:1871 in baseball Category:1871 National Association season Boston Red Stockings ",
