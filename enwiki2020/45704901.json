    "text": "The 2016 World Rowing Championships was the 46th edition and held from 21 to 28 August 2016 at the Willem-Alexander Baan in Rotterdam, Netherlands in conjunction with the World Junior Rowing Championships and the World Rowing U23 Championships. The annual week-long rowing regatta is organized by FISA (the International Rowing Federation), and held at the end of the northern hemisphere summer. Because the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics were the major rowing events in 2016, the World Championships programme was limited to non-Olympic events, non-Paralympic events, and the World Rowing Junior Championships were held at the same time, and also the World Rowing U23 Championships. ==Medal summary== ===Medal table=== Willem- Alexander Baan during construction ===Events=== The lightweight men's eight was discontinued after the 2015 World Rowing Championships due to low participation in three consecutive championships. {| |- ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background-color:#CCC;\" | Openweight events |- | | Oliver Cook Callum McBrierty Henry Fieldman || 7:29:69 | Andrew Stewart-Jones Benjamin de Wit Kevin Chung || 7:32:05 | Mario Paonessa Vincenzo Capelli Andrea Riva || 7:32:22 |- | | Fiona Gammond Donna Etiebet Holly Nixon Holly Norton || 7:16:28 | Molly Bruggeman Emily Huelskamp Corinne Schoeller Kristine O'Brien || 7:21:53 | Melanie Hansen Ronja Sch\u00fctte Charlotte Reinhardt Lea-Kathleen K\u00fchne || 7:26:15 |- ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background-color:#CCC;\" | Lightweight events |- | | Paul O'Donovan || 7:32:84 | P\u00e9ter Galambos || 7:36:95 | Luk\u00e1\u0161 Baba\u010d || 7:38:89 |- | | Patrik St\u00f6cker Florian Roller Johannes Ursprung Cedric Kulbach || 6:23:09 | Fran\u00e7ois Teroin Damien Piqueras Maxime Demontfaucon Morgan Maunoir || 6:24:72 | Georgios Konsolas Spyridon Giannaros Panagiotis Magdanis Eleftherios Konsolas || 6:26:58 |- | | Augustin Mouterde Alexis Gu\u00e9rinot || 7:14.18 | Emil Espensen Jens Vilhelmsen || 7:15.30 | Joel Cassells Sam Scrimgeour || 7:16.49 |- | | Zoe McBride || 8:28:45 | Emma Fredh || 8:29:12 | Katherine Sauks || 8:37:96 |- | | Brianna Stubbs Emily Craig Imogen Walsh Eleanor Piggott || 7:10:60 | Judith Anlauf Leonie Pieper Lena Reuss Katrin Thoma || 7:12:45 | Xuan Xulian Zhang Weixiao Zhang Weimiao Yan Xiaohua || 7:21:04 |- ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background-color:#CCC;\" | Para- rowing (adaptive) events |- | | Guylaine Marchand Fabien Saint-Lannes || 8:38.53 | Johanna Beyer Rainer Putz || 9:06.51 | Valentina Zhagot Evgenii Borisov || 9:27.74 |} ===Event codes=== {| class=\"wikitable infobox\" style=\"float:left; text-align:center;\" |- | ! single sculls !! double sculls !! quadruple sculls ! pair (coxless) !! four (coxless) ! coxed pair !! coxed four !! eight (coxed) |- !
