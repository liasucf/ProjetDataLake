    "text": "Alecu Beldiman, common rendition of Alexandru Beldiman (Romanian Cyrillic: A\u043b\u0454\u046fa\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0222 \u0411\u0454\u043b\u0434\u0438\u043ca\u043d), also known as Alecul or Aleco Beldiman (1760\u2013ca. January 1826), was a Moldavian statesman, translator and poet, one of the forerunners of Romanian nationalism. A scion of the boyar elite, he was the eldest son of Vornic Gheorghe Beldiman, and the nephew-in-law of chronicler Enache Kog\u0103lniceanu. Alecu himself held high commission in the Moldavian military forces and bureaucracy, but secretly resented the Phanariote regime which had awarded them. He may have affiliated with a loose group known as the \"National Party\", championing an alliance between Moldavia's independence from the Ottoman Empire and support for the French Republic. Beldiman's earliest contributions to cultural life probably date back to the 1790s, and originally included translations of French prose and verse drama. He may have contributed an original play, while his brother, Dumitrache Beldiman, helped arrange some of the earliest Moldavian stage performances, as puppet shows. By 1820, Alecu had become the most productive translator in Moldavia, directly contributing to Westernization and the spread of Enlightenment ideas, and also completing a Romanian version of the Odyssey. His works in the field were circulated in print form by Zaharia Carcalechi, or otherwise copied by hand. Beldiman's anti-Greek sentiment peaked during the 1821, when an invasion by the Sacred Band chased him and other Romanian boyars out of Moldavia. The invasion and its violent aftermath inspired him to write the epic poem Tragodiea Moldovei (\"Moldavia's Tragedy\"). Although politically significant and comprising picturesque detail, the work was widely dismissed as a sample of exceptionally bad writing. Upon returning home, Beldiman also came into conflict with Prince Ioan Sturdza, who had him imprisoned at Tazl\u0103u Monastery in 1824. Poems he wrote during that interval show him as a conservative critic of republican and nationalist propaganda, and display his pity for the lower classes; he was also becoming more supportive of rule by the Ottoman Empire. Though eventually released, he maintained a low profile for the remainder of his life. His family continued to have a role in Moldavian, and later Romanian politics; his grandson Alexandru Beldiman was a journalist. ==Biography== ===Origins and early life=== According to family tradition, Beldiman's ancestors crossed into Moldavia from the Principality of Transylvania. Lauren\u021biu Ungureanu, \"Boieri mari, episodul 6: Alecu Beldiman, omul care ne-a adus Adev\u0103rul, in Adev\u0103rul, February 18, 2017Bacalov, p. 25; Iacob, p. 293 This would make them distant relatives of the Hungarian Counts of Beldi. The immigrants entered historical record in March 1579, when \"a certain Beldiman\" served as Mayor (\u0218oltuz) of Suceava.Stoicescu, p. 349. See also Iacob, p. 293 In April 1609, Nichifor Beldiman, recorded in some genealogies as a neme\u0219 (untitled landowner), became Vornic. He later served as Hetman and Logothete,Stoicescu, pp. 349\u2013350 and, in late 1615, led the boyars into rebellion against Prince \u0218tefan IX Tom\u0219a. He was captured in neighboring Wallachia and beheaded, his remains being disposed of in the Siret River.Stoicescu, pp. 349\u2013350, 353. See also Bacalov, pp. 88\u201389; C\u0103linescu, p. 55; Iacob, p. 293 His two sons continued to hold major boyar ranks, while his daughter married into the Pr\u0103jescu family.Stoicescu, pp. 350, 428 During the 18th century, the family lost its economic prosperity and political influence, and came to be regarded as emancipated peasants, rather than as boyars. Isolated in the rural areas of F\u0103lciu County, they were often known by the nickname M\u00e2nja.Iacob, pp. 293\u2013295 Alecu Beldiman's grandfather, Grigore M\u00e2nja Beldiman, rectified the situation. From beginnings as a page at the court of Prince Constantin Cantemir, he became fluent in Ottoman Turkish in Istanbul, where he also befriended Beizadea Dimitrie Cantemir.Iacob, p. 294 In 1711, following the Pruth River Campaign, the Cantemirs were chased out of the country; a Beldiman branch also left Moldavia and settled in the Russian Empire.Bezviconi, p. 177 These events led to the emergence of a Phanariote regime in Moldavia and Wallachia: from ca. 1711, both Danubian Principalities had lost much of their autonomy within the Ottoman Empire; the boyar elite, formed mainly by Greek immigrants, controlled the administration. Grigore M\u00e2nja survived this time of troubles, and emerged as a favorite of the early Phanariotes: Nicholas Mavrocordatos and Grigore II Ghica both made used of his services. However, his participation in boyar conspiracies during the third reign of Mihai Racovi\u021b\u0103 endangered his career and his life.Iacob, pp. 294\u2013295 Alecu's father was Gheorghe Beldiman (1724\u20131792). Orphaned of both parents by 1735, he and his four brothers were virtually adopted by the returning Prince Ghica, who groomed them for high office.Iacob, pp. 295\u2013297 Gheorghe amassed a personal fortune while climbing through the ranks, serving as Stolnic in 1763, Ban in 1773, and finally Vornic in 1790.Iacob, pp. 297\u2013298 During the Russo-Turkish War of the 1770s, he declared his personal submission to Catherine the Great.Ion Constantin, Ion Negrei, Gheorghe Negru, Ioan Pelivan: istoric al mi\u0219c\u0103rii na\u021bionale din Basarabia, p. 64. Bucharest: Editura Biblioteca Bucure\u0219tilor, 2012. He remained a noted figure in the Russophile party, and as a result earned a permanent appointment to the Moldavian Divan in 1774.Iacob, p. 298 His son's birth came during the final stages of the Phanariote era. Alecu was born in 1760, either in Ia\u0219i, the Moldavian capital, or in the smaller town of Hu\u0219i.C\u0103linescu, p. 55; Densusianu, p. 27; Marcu, p. 119 His maternal family was Greek. His mother, Maria, was the daughter of \"publican Lefter\" from Istanbul; her sister was married to Enache Kog\u0103lniceanu, the Moldavian chronicler and social reformer.Iacob, p. 298. See also Marcu, p. 119 The couple had an older daughter, Anastasia, and three younger sons: Iancu, Filip, and Dumitrache.Iacob, pp. 291, 298\u2013300 Beldiman coat of arms Early on, Alecu became fluent in Greek and more unusually for his generation, also in French.C\u0103linescu, p. 55; Eliade, p. 335; Marcu, pp. 121, 123 He was educated at home and in private Greek schools\u2014unlike Dumitrache, who was a graduate of the Princely Academy. He climbed steadily through the boyar hierarchy, becoming Ceau\u0219 in the Moldavian military forces in 1785; he was Serdar in 1789. At age 34, Alecu became a Paharnic at the princely court of Michael Drakos Soutzos, before being moved to serve as Ispravnic in Neam\u021b County. In 1800, under Prince Constantine Ypsilantis, Beldiman was appointed P\u00e2rc\u0103lab of Gala\u021bi.Marcu, p. 119 Following his father's death, he became sole owner of several estates. One was Corne\u0219ti, outside Ia\u0219i; two others, Iezereni and Te\u021bcureni, were in Bessarabia.Iacob, pp. 301\u2013304. See also Iorga (1912), p. 110 Beldiman was married three times. His first wife, name unknown, was a member of the Romano clan; the second was Ileana, sister of the Logothete and poet Costache Conachi, making him in-laws with Nicolae Vogoride, future Kaymakam of Moldavia.C\u0103linescu, pp. 55, 85, 980. See also Marcu, p. 119 Beldiman's final, childless, marriage was to Elena Greceanu.C\u0103linescu, pp. 55, 980 Researcher Nicolae N. Condeescu pushes the beginnings of Beldiman's literary activity into the 18th century, citing him as the uncredited translator of Vincent Voiture's novel, Alcidales et Zelide. In or around 1799, he also probably completed a version of Eustathios Makrembolites and Godard de Beauchamps' Story of Hysmine and Hysminias.Marcu, pp. 122\u2013123 In parallel, Beldiman became identified as one of the earliest contributors to the popularization of Western theater. The beginnings of Moldavian own theatrical activity are dated to ca. 1800, when Conachi, Nicolae Dimachi and Dumitrache Beldiman produced a short series of puppet shows, with Romanian-language texts.Tatiana Vi\u0219escu, \"\u00cenceputurile teatrului rom\u00e2nesc cult. Costachi Caragiali \u2013 O repeti\u021bie moldoveneasc\u0103 sau noi \u0219i iar noi\", in Language and Literature \u2013 European Landmarks of Identity, Vol. 1, 2005, p. 129 They also wrote a comedy of their own, making Dumitrache's one of Moldavia's first playwrights. Another play, tentatively dated to 1811, was called Serdarul din Orhei (\"The Serdar of Orhei\"); historian Nicolae Iorga believes that it was penned by Alecu Beldiman. Dumitrache and Alecu remained interested in both literature and politics; Filip withdrew to a monastery in 1792, while Iancu died later that same decade.Iacob, pp. 299\u2013300 According to philologist Gheorghe Bogdan-Duic\u0103, Alecu Beldiman's next translation was from Homer's Odyssey (as Odiseia lui Omir). Andreas Wolf, a Transylvanian Saxon physician, met the Beldimans ca. 1797, praising them as lovers of arts and literature. Bogdan-Duic\u0103 hypothesizes that Beldiman handed his manuscript to Wolf, who took it to Hermannstadt and promised to publish it there.Lascu, pp. 99\u2013101 It shows the author's familiarity with, and reliance on, the French-style Romanization of Greek, but is above all infused with staples of the Moldavian dialect.Lascu, pp. 101\u2013104 Another similar text, tentatively attributed to Beldiman, showed up at Dorohoi, near Moldavia's border with the Duchy of Bukovina.Lascu, p. 99 ===Literary fame=== An unclear tradition claims that one of the Belidimans was involved in a project to unite Wallachia and Moldavia as a single \"republic\", with help from Napoleon Bonaparte.Nicolae Iorga, \"Cuget\u0103tori rom\u00e2ni de acum o sut\u0103 de ani. I. Trei conservatori \u00een epoca de unire \u0219i consolidare\", in Memoriile Sec\u021biunii Istorice, Vol. XXI, 1939, pp. 706\u2013707 Following the Russian invasion of Moldavia in 1806, the youngest Beldiman brother interrupted his literary activities to serve in the occupation government. Alecu's own literary output became more notable following the Russo-Turkish War and the peace of Bucharest. Both Alecu Beldiman and Conachi had been chased out of their Bessarabian estates by the Russian occupation, which ultimately annexed the region as a Bessarabian Governorate; they settled in Ia\u0219i as refugees.Bezviconi, p. 202 In 1815, Prince Scarlat Callimachi appointed Alecu an Aga of his citadel in H\u00e2rl\u0103u. At around that time, he also became involved in the thriving business of inn- keeping, establishing his own taproom in B\u00e2rlad.Marcel Proca, \"Hanuri. Istoria evolu\u021biei de la han la hotel\", in Academia B\u00e2rl\u0103dean\u0103, Vol. XXI, Issue 4 (57), Winter 2014, p. 15 Beldiman was advanced to Postelnic in 1818, and finally became the Ispravnic of Ia\u0219i in 1819, under Prince Michael Soutzos.Marcu, p. 119. See also C\u0103linescu, p. 55; Densusianu, p. 27 An 1819 map by Giuseppe Bayardi shows that he owned a mansion on Ia\u0219i's S\u00e2rbeasc\u0103 Street.Iftimi & V\u0103leanu, p. 45 His estate grew to include parts of Popeni and Vinderei, in Tutova County, as well as several other townhouses in Ia\u0219i. He also owned several hamlets populated by Romanies, which he kept as boyar slaves.Iacob, pp. 303\u2013304 Abel's burial, as illustrated in the 1818 edition of Moartea lui Avel At this new stage, Beldiman blended Romanian nationalism with an interest in modern education, declaring himself a direct contributor to the \"material progress of the Romanian people\".C\u0103linescu, p. 55; Eliade, pp. 336, 348 According to historian Neagu Djuvara, Beldiman closely resembles the Wallachian intellectuals of his era, specifically Naum R\u00e2mniceanu, Dionisie Eclesiarhul, and Zilot Rom\u00e2nul, in being virulently anti-Greek and anti- Phanariote.Djuvara, p. 88 Scholar Pompiliu Eliade sees the Beldimans and the Sturdzas as affiliates of the \"National Party\", which favored independence from the Ottomans and sought direct protection from the French Republic.Eliade, pp. 231\u2013235, 248, 335 However, Iorga also highlights the limits of Beldiman's nationalism: although he opted to stay in \"Turkish Moldavia\", he \"never wrote as much as a verse, as much as a single line of prose\" against Russian occupation in Bessarabia.Iorga (1912), p. 171 Likewise, scholar Ovid Densusianu reads Beldiman as a Moldavian particularist, who was generally indifferent to the tribulations of Romanians in Wallachia and elsewhere.Densusianu, pp. 31\u201332 Philologist Andreea Giorgiana Marcu notes that, as a translator of Western literature, Beldiman was necessarily a participant in the Age of Enlightenment. He resonated most with Neoclassicism, and especially with its \"obviously moralizing\" accounts.Marcu, pp. 119, 121, 123 Likewise, culture critic George Panu proposes that Beldiman and Conachi must have been closely familiarized with, and imitators of, Johan Gabriel Oxenstierna.Panu, p. 165 Over 40 years, Beldiman arguably became the most prolific among Moldavia's contributors to Westernizing translations.Djuvara, pp. 309\u2013310; Marcu, pp. 119, 121 As noted by Densusianu, Beldiman translated plays that were never intended for actual stage production, since there was no Moldavian theater to speak of.Densusianu, pp. 28\u201329 His texts had to introduce theatrical terminology for which there was yet no equivalent: he proposed obraz (\"cheek\" or \"face\") for \"character\", and schini for \"scene\".Marcu, p. 122 However, Eliade proposes that Beldiman was directly inspired to write for the stage by witnessing Moldavia's first first-ever theatrical experiment, produced in December 1816 by Gheorghe Asachi.Eliade, pp. 347\u2013348 By late 1817, Beldiman had completed his own version of Voltaire's Oreste, which was only published in 1820.C\u0103linescu, p. 55; Lascu, pp. 94\u201395; Eliade, p. 348 He soon signed contracts with the Wallachian publisher, Zaharia Carcalechi, who was active in the literary circles of Habsburg Hungary.Densusianu, p. 27; Marcu, p. 119 In 1818, Beldiman also put out \u00cenv\u0103\u021b\u0103tur\u0103 sau pov\u0103\u021buire pentru facerea p\u00e2inii (\"A Guide or Advisor to Bread-making\"), ultimately based on a text by Christian Albert R\u00fcckert, but directly translated from the Greek version penned by Dimitrios Samurkasis (Dimitrie Samurca\u0219).C\u0103linescu, p. 55; Marcu, p. 121 Also that year, Beldiman completed a translation of Salomon Gessner's Der Tod Abels, from the French intermediary. It was published at Buda as Moartea lui Avel.C\u0103linescu, pp. 55, 980; Densusianu, p. 27; Lascu, p. 94; Marcu, p. 121 Beldiman followed up in 1820 with Istoria lui Numa Pompilie. This was a translation of Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian's Numa Pompilius, though Beldiman suppressed any mention of the real author.C\u0103linescu, p. 55. See also Densusianu, p. 27; Eliade, pp. 336, 354\u2013355, 416; Marcu, p. 121 Its preface includes some of the earliest Romanian views on traductology: Beldiman complained about his struggles in adapting early modern Romanian to render complex phrases in French.Eliade, pp. 354\u2013355; Marcu, p. 123 As noted by linguist Gheorghe Iv\u0103nescu, Beldiman followed Iacob Stamati and other Moldavians in adopting a Wallachian spelling for some of his core vocabulary. Istoria consistently used giudecat\u0103 (; \"trial\" or \"judgement\") for the Moldavianized judecat\u0103 ([\u0292udekat\u0259]).Gheorghe Iv\u0103nescu, Probleme capitale ale vechii rom\u00e2ne literare, pp. 62, 122. Ia\u0219i: Editura Universit\u0103\u021bii Alexandru Ioan Cuza, 2012. Beldiman completed numerous other translations, without ever submitting them for print. Various scribes copied them by hand, and they enjoyed popularity in boyar circles. However, Beldiman discovered that the texts were being slowly altered in the process, and decided to create his own authorized copies.Marcu, p. 121 This process involved several younger scribes. One was Ioni\u021b\u0103 Sion, who took dictation from Beldiman in writing \"all sorts of verse and stories\"; he was not paid for the job, but was allowed to make and keep his own copies.Lascu, p. 101 By 1813, Matei Gane of Ciumule\u0219ti had already collected and transcribed by hand Beldiman's various works.Constantin Gane, Pe aripa vremei, p. 72. Bucharest: Tipografia Steaua, 1923 Beldiman penned, but never printed, other renditions of tragedies and stories by Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost (with Manon Lescaut), Madame Cottin, Pietro Metastasio, Ren\u00e9-Charles Guilbert de Pix\u00e9r\u00e9court, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Regnard, Louis d'Ussieux, and various unknown authors.C\u0103linescu, pp. 55, 980; Carda\u0219, p. x; Marcu, pp. 119, 121\u2013122. See also Densusianu, pp. 27\u201328; Djuvara, pp. 309\u2013310; Eliade, pp. 416\u2013417; Lascu, passim Reportedly, he also finished translated the Iliad, but this work, if it ever existed, remains lost.Carda\u0219, p. x; Lascu, pp. 94\u201395 ===Tragodiea Moldovei=== The final stage of Beldiman's literary and political career was marked by the Greek War of Independence, part of which was fought on Moldavian soil. In early 1821, the country was invaded by Alexander Ypsilantis' Greek forces, comprising the Filiki Eteria and the Sacred Band. This occupation forced Beldiman out of Moldavia, and back into Bessarabia.Densusianu, p. 27 The events, which culminated in an Ottoman incursion and a Greek defeat in the Battle of Dragashani, were narrated by Beldiman in his rhyming chronicle. It is most often called Tragodiea Moldovei (\"Moldavia's Tragedy\"), but is also known as Eterie sau jalnicele scene prilejuite \u00een Moldova din resvr\u0103tirile grecilor, prin \u0219eful lor Alexandru Ipsilanti venitu din Rusia la anul 1821 (\"The Eteria or Awful Scenes Occurring in Moldavia Because of the Rebellions by Greeks under Their Leader Alexander Ypsilantis, Who Came in from Russia in 1821\"). According to literary historian George C\u0103linescu, the work was unintentionally \"buffoonish\", reading like a \"humorous rigmarole\".C\u0103linescu, pp. 53\u201355 The overall result ran at 4,260 lines of verse which, C\u0103linescu argues, was of an \"old-fashioned type\" and \"monotonous\", similar to later works by Constantin Negruzzi.C\u0103linescu, pp. 54, 210 Alexander Ypsilantis crossing the Prut River into Moldavia; allegory by Peter von Hess Scholar Gheorghe Carda\u0219 views Beldiman as the final Moldavian representative of a \"prolix, untalented\" school of poets, which began in 1681 with the anonymous Chronological Poem of the Moldavian Rulers.Carda\u0219, pp. ix\u2013x Similarly, Densusianu notes that Beldiman demanded from his readers a patience that he never repaid. He was \"not a poet, but only a versifier, and as such one in a string of mediocre writers.\" Moreover, his genre of choice, the \"rhyming chronicle\", was \"unrewarding\" and \"manically\" over-detailed, though he remained overall superior to Zilot, his Wallachian contemporary.Densusianu, pp. 29\u201330 According to Eliade, Tragodiea is a \"long and tedious newspaper article, prosaic as no prose has ever been, amusing only because the author himself realizes that his work is so very difficult, and his ability so very limited.\"Eliade, pp. 335\u2013336 Eliade also finds that, being no longer disciplined by foreign grammar (as he was in his translations), Beldiman constructs incoherent phrases. His vocabulary is \"flooded\" with Greek, Ottoman, or Slavonic terms.Eliade, p. 355; Marcu, p. 123 According to historian Vlad Georgescu, Beldiman was still notable as the most erudite chronicler of his generation.Georgescu, p. 174 As C\u0103linescu writes, an \"entertaining jolt\" in the epic came wherever Beldiman described his contempt for various of his contemporaries: the \"godless dog\" Vasileios Karavias and the haughty but \"so very cowardly\" Stefan Bogoridi.C\u0103linescu, p. 54 Complex descriptions remain rare, as Beldiman often dismisses the Eterists and his other adversaries with just one epithet, sometimes bordering on the obscene.Densusianu, p. 30 One line refers to a \"Lividi Nicolaki, that base and ugly soul\", who, according to Beldiman, had been appointed commander of Moldavia's Romanies by Ypsilantis' government. Researchers are unsure about whether this is a reference to Niccol\u00f2 Livaditti, a Triestene painter.Sorin Iftimi, Corina Cimpoe\u0219u, Marcelina Br\u00eendu\u0219a Munteanu, Niccolo Livaditi \u0219i epoca sa (1832\u20131858). Art\u0103 \u0219i istorie, p. 21. Ia\u0219i: Palace of Culture, 2012. Other aspects of the narrative were also polemical, reflecting Beldiman's brand of conservatism. In one episode of his epic, Beldiman sides with the local Turks, whom the Eterist invasion had decimated.Xenopol, p. 34 Another one of his stanzas lambasts Tudor Vladimirescu, leader of the parallel uprising in Wallachia. As noted by C\u0103linescu, Beldiman and Vladimirescu were both Romanian nationalists, but of different visions; the Moldavian poet described the Wallachian revolutionist as \"deceitful\", prone to demagoguery.C\u0103linescu, p. 55; Densusianu, p. 32. See also Georgescu, pp. 185\u2013186 Historian A. D. Xenopol also notes that Beldiman was sarcastic in his treatment of the Moldavian republican boyars, whom he called Decemviri.Xenopol, p. 78 The restoration of Ottoman rule was rendered complete by the Eterist defeat at Sculeni in June 1821. Beldiman, having been appointed Vornic,Georgescu, p. 169 made the return trip to Ia\u0219i. In November, he purchased the townhouse owned by a fellow boyar, the Wallachian Iordache Filipescu, in P\u0103curari neighborhood; it was here that he finished writing Tragodiea.Iftimi & V\u0103leanu, p. 26 His poem-chronicle purposefully refrained from documenting the entirety of Ioan Sturdza's reign, which began in 1822.C\u0103linescu, p. 54; Densusianu, p. 33 One stanza circulates the notion that Sturdza was a \"son of Moldavia\", rather than a Phanariote, and expresses his belief that a \"golden century\" would follow.Densusianu, p. 31 The Vornic soon returned to championing his version of boyar nationalism: in Tragodiea, he makes explicit references to the \"national interest\".Georgescu, pp. 169, 182\u2013184, 187, 189\u2013190 From 1823, Beldiman preserved a copy of what he claimed to be Moldavia's Capitulation to the Ottomans, outlining the ancient rights of its inhabitants. The text expanded on earlier forgeries.Georgescu, p. 186; Giurescu, pp. 4, 13\u201314, 19\u201322, 33\u201334 Overall, he was more pro-Ottoman than Zilot and other chroniclers, being above all thankful that the Empire had defeated Ypsilantis.Georgescu, pp. 186\u2013187 ===Death and legacy=== In reality, Beldiman was at odds with the new regime. As one of the more conservative boyars, he clashed with the monarch. In March 1824, with Dimachi and others, he authored a letter of protest against Prince Sturdza, which was addressed to his overlord, Sultan Mahmud II.Pung\u0103, p. 224 During the same year, he was briefly imprisoned for his disobedience.Xenopol, p. 101 Confined inside Tazl\u0103u Monastery, he produced his final set of poems, Stihuri (\"Verse\"). These are patriotic in tone, but noticeably skeptical of nationalism, explaining that, even though the Phanariotes had lost power, bad customs survived through native boyars; unusually in his context, he sided with the lower classes against the aristocrats.Densusianu, pp. 32\u201333 Several lines refer to the harsh conditions faced by travelers, noting that rainstorms had rendered infernal his trip to Tazl\u0103u.Ion Ionescu, \"Podurile \u00een Rom\u00e2nia\", in Natura. Revist\u0103 pentru R\u0103sp\u00e2ndirea \u0218tiin\u021bei, Issue 4/1936, p. 7 Stylistically, the Stihuri resemble both Neoclassicism and early Romantic poetry, introducing elements later found in works by Barbu Paris Mumuleanu.Marcu, p. 120 Beldiman was ultimately released and made a discreet return to politics, living in relative seclusion for the rest of his life. His last published translation came out in 1824. It was a first volume of William Coxe's Travels into Poland, Russia, Sweden and Denmark, taken from a French version by Paul Henri Mallet. He died in January 1826, or at, earliest, December 1825Iacob, p. 299\u2014according to fellow writer Dimitrie Pastiescul, he still held a pen in his hand when this occurred. Buried at his family's favorite church of Talpalari, Beldiman left a large number of manuscripts, which were reportedly sold by the pound to a local collector.C\u0103linescu, p. 55 Both Dumitrache and Filip survived their brother's death, the former dying in 1831. Filip, better known under his monastic name \"Filaret\", was appointed Bishop of Roman and carateker of the Moldavian Metropolis. In 1842, he served as administrator of Moldavia, filling in for Prince Mihail Sturdza.Pung\u0103, p. 246 From his Romano marriage, Alecu had a daughter. Known as either Pulheria or Profira, she married into the Cantacuzino family.C\u0103linescu, pp. 55, 980; Djuvara, p. 355; Iacob, p. 299 She was famous for raising her husband's illegitimate son, the half-Romani Dinc\u0103, who was formally her house slave. Her refusal to manumit him, and his subsequent suicide, resulted in mass support for abolitionism.Djuvara, pp. 276\u2013278 Alecu's son, Vasile Beldiman, married a Mavrocordatos.Narcis Dorin Ion, \"Istorie \u0219i genealogie. Convorbiri cu domnul Mihai Dim. Sturdza\", in Cercet\u0103ri Istorice, Vol. XXXIV, 2015, p. 306C\u0103linescu, p. 980; Iacob, p. 299 His only notable public office was that of Caretaker (Epitrop) of Moldavian schools. His wife Elena sold the Beldiman house in P\u0103curari to boyar Lupu Bal\u0219; it changed hands and served various functions until being demolished in 1966. Vasile died in 1853, and was survived by a son, Alexandru Beldiman, who was the head of Romanian Police and close friend of the Principalities' first Domnitor, Alexandru Ioan Cuza. In this capacity, he failed to prevent Cuza's toppling in 1866, and came to oppose the regime of Carol I, founding the left- wing newspaper Adev\u0103rul. Corne\u0219ti, still owned by this branch of the family, was passed to poet Dimitrie Anghel, and later to the Mavrocordatos.Iacob, p. 303 Iordachi Beldiman, sometimes described as Alecu's son,C\u0103linescu, p. 162 was in fact one of his nephews, born to Dumitrache Beldiman. Iordachi married Catinca Dimachi, daughter of the writer. She was made famous by her affair with poet Alexandru Hrisoverghi; according to one account, Hrisoverghi died after jumping out a window in Iordachi's townhouse.C\u0103linescu, pp. 93, 162\u2013163 Also a Vornic, Iordachi was noted for commissioning a gallery of portraits of Moldavian Princes.Sorin Iftimi, \"Chipurile domnitorului Alexandru Moruzi \u00een portrete din secolul XIX\", in Cercet\u0103ri Istorice, Vol. XXXIV, 2015, p. 179 During the United Principalities era, he became a leading figure in Ia\u0219i's conservative circles, helping Iacob Negruzzi establish the political review Constitu\u021biunea.Iorga (1934), p. 62 Alecu's niece, Maria or Marghioala, was a locally famous philanthropist, married to politician Scarlat Miclescu. Their son, Dimitrie S. Miclescu (1820\u20131896), participated in the 1848 revolutionary movement, as well as being a published poet. He became a noted agitator on the far-left of Romanian liberalism and renounced all claim to boyar privilege, including his family name.\"Dumitru Scarlat Miclescu\", in Gazeta Transilvaniei, Issue 270/1896, p. 5 Beldiman's translations continued to be read by young intellectuals in all Romanian-speaking areas: Constantin N. Br\u0103iloiu, who went abroad to study in 1828, ordered copies of Oreste and Istoria lui Numa Pompilie, \"so as not to forget his language\".Lauren\u021biu Vlad, \"C\u00e2teva date despre educa\u021bia unui t\u00e2n\u0103r boier valah. Studiile lui Constantin N. Br\u0103iloiu la Sibiu, Geneva \u0219i Paris \u00een anii 1822\u20131832\", in \u021aara B\u00e2rsei, Issue 8, 2009, p. 50 Ioni\u021b\u0103 Sion's manuscripts were preserved by his son, the poet-memoirist Gheorghe Sion. For decades, Tragodiea circulated in 23 handwritten copies, two of which were respectively owned by Nicolae B\u0103lcescu and Alexandru Odobescu. In the 1840s, Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu set himself the task of printing Beldiman's writings and documents as part of an anthology.C\u0103linescu, p. 177; Giurescu, pp. 4, 13, 19\u201320 As Eterie sau jalnicele scene, Tragodiea was eventually printed in 1861, at the expense of an Alecu Balica; it was reissued in 1875 as Tragedia Moldovei.C\u0103linescu, p. 980. See also Densusianu, p. 29; Marcu, p. 120 By then, poet Vasile Alecsandri was actively campaigning for Beldiman to be included into the Romanian literary canon,Iorga (1934), pp. 179\u2013180 while philologist Alexandru Lambrior unsuccessfully proposed to set the Romanian literary standard exclusively on words used by Beldiman and Conachi.Panu, pp. 171\u2013173 Beldiman's work was finally rediscovered in the 1890s. One of its promoters was the antiquarian George Ionescu-Gion, who insisted that Beldiman was without philosophical merit, but a genuine patriot.Rodica Florea, \"Reviste \u0219i scriitori \u00een ultimele dou\u0103 decenii ale secolului al XIX-lea\", in \u0218erban Cioculescu, Ovidiu Papadima, Alexandru Piru (eds.), Istoria literaturii rom\u00e2ne. III: Epoca marilor clasici, p. 945. Bucharest: Editura Academiei, 1973 The same belief was expressed in 1910 by Xenopol, according to whom Beldiman was not significant as a poet, but voiced the \"national sentiment in all its freedom\". ==Notes== ==References== Category:1760 births Category:1826 deaths Category:18th-century politicians Category:19th-century Romanian politicians Category:Postelnici of Moldavia Category:19th-century Romanian historians Category:Moldavian and Wallachian chroniclers Category:19th-century Romanian poets Category:Romanian-language poets Category:Neoclassical writers Category:Romantic poets Category:Romanian translators Category:French\u2013Romanian translators Category:Greek\u2013Romanian translators Category:Romanian nationalists Category:Members of the Romanian Orthodox Church Category:Romanian people of Hungarian descent Category:Romanian people of Greek descent Category:Moldavian people of the Greek War of Independence Category:Romanian refugees Category:Romanian prisoners and detainees Category:Forgers Category:Businesspeople in the hospitality industry Category:Romanian businesspeople Category:Moldavian slave owners ",
