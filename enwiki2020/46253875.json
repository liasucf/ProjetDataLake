    "text": "The Engineering and Technology History Wiki (ETHW) is a MediaWiki-based website dedicated to the history of technology. It consists of articles, first-hand accounts, oral histories, landmarks and milestones and started operating in 2015.ETHW: The Engineering and Technology History Wiki. AAPT, Physical Science Resource Center. Retrieved October 10, 2017. it included thousands of wiki entries, and recorded over 800 oral histories. A partnership between the United Engineering Foundation (UEF) and its member engineering organizations ASCE, AIME, AIChE, ASME, IEEE as well as the Society of Woman Engineers is developing the ETHW as a central historical repository for the documentation, analysis and explanation of the history of technology. For this purpose, UEF has made a grant to develop such an engineering intersociety web platform. This work is mainly done at the IEEE History Center,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE History Center annexed to the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ.IEEE History Center, Stevens Institute of Technology, College of Arts and Letters Today, the ETHW is a successor to the former IEEE Global History Network (IEEE GHN), which operated from 2008 to 2014. Therefore, most content is related to electrical, electronics and computer engineering so far. As the fields of civil engineering, mining, metallurgical and petroleum engineering, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering will be covered by members of the respective organizations in the future, ETHW is intended to be a global record for preserving knowledge of the history of technological innovation in a broad sense. It differs from other online sources, as personal accounts of technical innovators as primary sources are made available to the public. After its start as a common platform for several engineering societies in 2015, the Society of Woman Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Engineers have already contributed new content during the first two months of 2015. == Sectors == === Encyclopedia === This sector includes articles about significant technological achievement (the former STARS articles of IEEE GHN), topic articles as an introduction to important technologies and their evolution, biographies and accounts of the history of engineering societies. === Oral histories === Interviews were conducted with important personalities in the fields of interest. Over 800 transcripts of such interviews, dating back as far as the 1960s, are accessible. === First-hand histories === ETHW offers engineers, scientists and inventors the unique opportunity to publish their own professional experiences as first-hand accounts on this website. First-hand histories of teams working together in the same field are also welcomed. A wide range of First-hand histories, many written before ETHW was started, are incorporated in this section of the ETHW and can be accessed. === Landmarks and milestones === The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has established a \"List of Landmarks\" including outstanding monuments and buildings. In 1984 IEEE started recognizing \"IEEE Milestones\" to honor exceptional achievements in the fields of electrical, electronic and computer engineering. Information on how to submit an additional IEEE Milestones can be found on a special website.IEEE Milestones There is also a collection of \"Landmarks\" chosen by ASME as mechanical engineering highlights.Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks === Archives === This archive includes publications, audio and video records as well as document collections bequeathed to this organization. === Education === To help pre-university teachers plan social studies courses in Science, Technology and Society as defined by a Standards Task Force of the NCSS, ETHW provides lesson plans for a series of suitable topics.List of available lesson plans for social studies == Sources == == External links == * Engineering and Technology History Wiki * United Engineering Foundation Category:Engineering societies Category:Engineering organizations Category:American engineering organizations Category:Organizations established in 2015 Category:Wikis ",
