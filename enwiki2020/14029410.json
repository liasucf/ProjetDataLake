Domenech was one of six political appointees of the Trump administration at the Interior Department under investigation for having \"violated federal ethics rules by engaging with their former employers or clients on department-related business.\" In 2017 Trump had signed an executive order requiring appointees to recuse themselves for two years on any matters involving their former employers and clients.
