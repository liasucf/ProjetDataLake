In 1580, after the Livonian War, the area was transferred to Poland, where it was included into Vitebsk Voivodeship. In 1667, according to the Truce of Andrusovo, it was transferred back to Russia. Subsequently Porechye developed as an important trading post since it was located at the intersection of roads connecting Saint Petersburg with Kiev and Moscow with Riga. The Kasplya was navigable until mid-19th century, and Porechye sent ships to Riga. Later, it lost its trade important, since the Kasplya became more shallow, and the railway between Moscow and Riga went via Velikiye Luki, far from Porechye.
