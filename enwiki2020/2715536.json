    "text": "V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s Arribas (; born 14 January 1982) is a Spanish football coach and former professional player. As a player, he played as a goalkeeper. He spent most of his professional career with Barcelona in La Liga, and is regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the club's history, having appeared in 535 official games for the club and won 21 major titles, notably six La Liga titles and three UEFA Champions League championships. Vald\u00e9s also won the Zamora Trophy a record five times. He currently holds the club records as goalkeeper with most appearances in the league and in official competition, breaking Andoni Zubizarreta's records during the 2011\u201312 season. After leaving Barcelona at the end of his contract in July 2014, he joined Manchester United in January 2015. He played rarely at United, and after a brief loan at Standard Li\u00e8ge, he moved on to Middlesbrough. After being released by Middlesbrough at the end of the 2016\u201317 season, Vald\u00e9s retired from professional football. Vald\u00e9s made his full international debut in 2010 and earned 20 international caps. He was part of the Spain squads which won the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012, and also took part at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, where Spain finished in second place. ==Early career== Born in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Catalonia, Vald\u00e9s started his career with FC Barcelona's youth team when he joined from Pe\u00f1a Cinco Copas on 1 July 1992. That September, he moved with his family to Tenerife and had to leave the club, but returned three years later. After returning, he made quick progress through the youth teams. ==Club career== ===Barcelona=== Vald\u00e9s made his first team debut against Legia Warszawa in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League on 14 August 2002. The early part of the 2002\u201303 season saw Vald\u00e9s play deputy to Argentine international Roberto Bonano, but the arrival of Radomir Anti\u0107 as the new manager in January 2003 saw regular first-team opportunities for Vald\u00e9s. In the 2003\u201304 season, he emerged as first-choice goalkeeper, and in the 2004\u201305 season, he played in almost all of Barcelona's matches, helping Barcelona to their first league title in six years. He also won the Zamora Trophy as the best goalkeeper in Spain that season. In the 2005\u201306 season, Vald\u00e9s helped Bar\u00e7a to the European Double. He played a big part in Bar\u00e7a's 2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League title and in the final against Arsenal, he denied Thierry Henry twice from point-blank range. His efforts saw him singled out for praise from Frank Rijkaard. The \"Zamora\" title, however, eluded him, as Vald\u00e9s came third after Santiago Ca\u00f1izares and the winner, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Pinto. Mallorca in 2007 On 17 June 2007, the last round of La Liga, Vald\u00e9s matched a goalkeeping record held by former Barcelona goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta by starting, and never being substituted, in all 38 matches of the La Liga season. Vald\u00e9s set the Barcelona club record for not conceding a goal in European competition with a clean sheet against Rangers on 7 November 2007, which saw him re-write the Bar\u00e7a record books after not conceding a goal for 466 minutes. Vald\u00e9s was beaten twice by Olympique Lyonnais captain Juninho Pernambucano through a 45-yard free kick and a late penalty kick at the Stade de Gerland, ending his streak. In the 2006\u201307 and 2007\u201308 seasons, however, Bar\u00e7a failed to win a major trophy. On 1 April 2008, Vald\u00e9s made his 250th appearance for Barcelona. On 27 May 2009, Barcelona beat Manchester United 2\u20130 in the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final to complete an unprecedented Treble of La Liga, Champions League, and Copa del Rey. In the match, Vald\u00e9s made two saves from attempts by Cristiano Ronaldo in both halves. In the first half, he saved a long-range free kick, and in the second half, he saved the other from Ronaldo, coming from a tight angle following a low cross from Dimitar Berbatov. Vald\u00e9s playing for Barcelona in 2012 On 16 May 2010, Vald\u00e9s won his fourth title as Barcelona clinched a second successive Spanish league title with Pep Guardiola's side, ending the season with 99 points. On 29 August 2011, Vald\u00e9s played his 410th match with Barcelona and equaled Andoni Zubizarreta's record as Barcelona's goalkeeper with the most appearances.\"Victor Valdes 'very proud' to equal Andoni Zubizarreta's record as goalkeeper with most Barcelona appearances\". Goal.com. 30 August 2011. Retrieved 18 March 2012. In 2012, Vald\u00e9s made a goalkeeping error against Real Madrid in the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a that culminated in \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda scoring a decisive goal and narrowing down Barcelona's two-goal advantage. Real Madrid went on to win the Super Cup in the second leg at the Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. On 1 May 2013, in a 3\u20130 Champions League semi-final loss to FC Bayern Munich at Camp Nou, Vald\u00e9s made his 100th appearance in the competition, becoming the 17th player to do so. Later that month, Vald\u00e9s announced that he would not renew his Barcelona contract, which was due to expire at the end of the 2013\u201314 season. He cited the pressure of representing the club and stated that he had declared his wish to leave early enough for the club to find a replacement. On 26 March 2014, in a 3\u20130 victory against Celta de Vigo, Vald\u00e9s tore his anterior cruciate ligament in the 22nd minute of the match and was substituted off, and was ruled out for the rest of the season, ending his Barcelona career and ruling him out of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. ===Manchester United=== In January 2014, prior to the conclusion of his contract with Barcelona, Vald\u00e9s signed a pre-contract agreement to join Ligue 1 side Monaco at the end of the season; however, Vald\u00e9s' injury led to Monaco pulling out of the agreement. On 23 October 2014, Manchester United offered Vald\u00e9s the chance to complete his rehabilitation from a knee injury and to work his way back to fitness with the club. He was offered a contract in January 2015, and on 8 January signed an 18-month deal, with the option of a further year, as backup for compatriot David de Gea. As part of a compensation package for reneging on their deal with Vald\u00e9s, Monaco agreed to pay the difference between the \u00a3150,000 weekly wage he stood to earn with them and the lower salary offered by Manchester United. Vald\u00e9s played his first match since his knee injury on 26 January, featuring for United's Under-21 team in a 2\u20131 home win over Liverpool. Before the game, he gave a team talk based on the teachings of his former manager Guardiola. He made his first-team debut on 17 May against Arsenal at Old Trafford, replacing the injured De Gea for the final 16 minutes and conceding an own goal by Tyler Blackett for a 1\u20131 draw. A week later he made his first start for the team in their last game of the season away to Hull City, keeping a clean sheet in a goalless draw which relegated the opponents. On 15 July 2015, Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal announced that Vald\u00e9s had been placed on the transfer list after it was claimed he had refused to play in a reserve game. The following month, he was not given a squad number for the upcoming season. A transfer to Turkey's Be\u015fikta\u015f fell through as personal terms could not be agreed. Despite subsequently being named in Manchester United's Premier League squad, reports confirmed Vald\u00e9s was only named to conform to Premier League rules and not being offered a way back. ===Standard Li\u00e8ge=== On 23 January 2016, Manchester United announced that Vald\u00e9s would be moving to Belgian club Standard Li\u00e8ge on a six-month loan deal. He made his debut a week later in a 2\u20130 win at OH Leuven in the Belgian Pro League. On 20 March, Vald\u00e9s won the 2016 Belgian Cup Final, beating Club Brugge 2\u20131. His loan spell was cut short on 29 April after the club decided to allow more youth players the opportunity to play in games at the end of the season. ===Middlesbrough=== On 7 July 2016, Vald\u00e9s signed a two-year deal on a free transfer at Premier League newcomers Middlesbrough, managed by compatriot Aitor Karanka. On 13 August 2016, Vald\u00e9s made his debut in a 1\u20131 draw against Stoke City. On 22 October 2016, Vald\u00e9s kept his first clean sheet of the season in a 0\u20130 draw against Arsenal. The club entered the relegation zone in March 2017 after a 2\u20130 loss to Stoke City, with Karanka sacked later that month. Vald\u00e9s, as well as fellow goalkeeper Brad Guzan, left the club on 1 July 2017. Although he had offers from several clubs in Spain to prolong his career, Vald\u00e9s retired from professional football in August 2017; after remaining without a club for the first half of the 2017\u201318 season, he later confirmed his official retirement in January 2018. ==International career== Vald\u00e9s at UEFA Euro 2012 On 16 August 2005, Vald\u00e9s was called up for a friendly game against Uruguay, but did not take the field. After being overlooked by various coaches of the Spanish national side for several years, on 20 May 2010, he was included by Vicente del Bosque in Spain's final 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa as the second-choice goalkeeper behind Iker Casillas wearing the number 12 shirt. On 3 June 2010, Vald\u00e9s earned his first cap, starting in a friendly match between Spain and South Korea at Tivoli-Neu in Innsbruck, Austria. Vald\u00e9s was part of the Spanish squads that won the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012, despite not playing in either tournament. He was also in the Spanish squad which reached the final of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil. His sole appearance in a major tournament came in their last group game, keeping a clean sheet in a 3\u20130 win over Nigeria at the Est\u00e1dio Castel\u00e3o in Fortaleza. ==Style of play== In his prime, Vald\u00e9s was considered to be a successful and generally high quality goalkeeper, albeit somewhat inconsistent, and is regarded as one of Barcelona's best ever goalkeepers. An authoritative presence in the area, with good reflexes, handling, positioning, and shot- stopping abilities, he was known for his agility and composure in goal, as well as his ability to produce decisive saves, in particular after not being tested for long stretches of time; however, he was also prone to errors on occasion, in particular in his early career. In addition to his goalkeeping abilities, he was known in particular for his vision, footwork, distribution, control and skill with the ball at his feet, which enabled him to play the ball out on the ground or launch an attack from the back; throughout his career, he also stood out for his intelligence, ability to read the game, and his speed and bravery when coming off his line to claim the ball on the ground in one on one situations, and also excelled at anticipating opponents outside his area who had beaten the offside trap, and often functioned as a sweeper- keeper. ==Coaching career== On 1 June 2018, Vald\u00e9s returned to football as a manager by acquiring his UEFA Pro Licence alongside compatriots such as Xavi, Ra\u00fal and Xabi Alonso. Vald\u00e9s started coaching amateur side ED Moratalaz's youth ranks, where he achieved two regional titles. On 19 July 2019, Vald\u00e9s returned to Barcelona to coach its Juvenil A side. His return however was short lived, as he was sacked nearly 3 months later, on 7 October. ==Personal life== Vald\u00e9s was born to Jos\u00e9 Manuel Vald\u00e9s and \u00c1gueda Arribas and has two brothers, Ricardo and \u00c1lvaro. He married his long-time partner, Colombian model Yolanda Cardona, in June 2017. The couple have two sons, Dylan and Kai, and a daughter, Vera. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== :Sources:https://www.bdfutbol.com/en/j/j2595.html {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |-
