    "text": "Grand Larousse du XIXe si\u00e8cle. The Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si\u00e8cle (Great Universal Dictionary of the 19th Century), often called the Grand Larousse du dix-neuvi\u00e8me, is a French encyclopedic dictionary. It was planned, directed, published, and to a substantial degree written by Pierre Larousse, though he also relied on anonymous fellow contributors and though he died in 1875, before its completion. The publication of the Grand dictionnaire universel in 15 volumes of 1500 pages extended from 1866 to 1876. Two supplements were published in 1877 and 1890. ==Description== Volumes 1-15, covering A-Z, were issued from 1866 to 1876. A supplement (Volume 16) was published in 1877, and a second supplement (Volume 17), in 1890.See vol. 17, pp. 2023\u20132024. The Larousse firm also published further supplements in the form of a magazine called Revue encyclop\u00e9dique (1891-1900) then Revue universelle (1900-1905). Unlike \u00c9mile Littr\u00e9's contemporary dictionary, the Grand Larousse is primarily an encyclopedia. It is opinionated and has a distinctive and personal style. One such instance of subjectivity appears regarding emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. For Pierre Larousse, what the Republic's general had done until the coup of 18 Brumaire was virtuous and glorious, but the coup and the subsequent rule of the consul and emperor were a tyrant's doings. Hence, the Grand Larousse du dix-neuvi\u00e8me had two entries: one for Bonaparte, Napoleon, who, according to the article, died on the 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799); and one for Napoleon referring to the consul and emperor. Though it is true that Napoleon Bonaparte \"changed\" his name to Napoleon I, he only did so at his crowning as emperor, not after the 18 Brumaire coup. ==Nouveau Larousse illustr\u00e9== The Nouveau Larousse illustr\u00e9 was an illustrated encyclopedia published 1897-1904 by \u00c9ditions Larousse and edited by Claude Aug\u00e9. It was essentially a scaled-down, updated and more neutral version of the Grand Larousse du dix-neuvi\u00e8me. ==See also== * \u00c9ditions Larousse * Grand Larousse encyclop\u00e9dique ==References== ==External links== *Digitized version on Gallica, the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France's digital collection. *A digitization project Includes much background material and bibliography on 19c French dictionaries and encyclopedias.
