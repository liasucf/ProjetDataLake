She is currently a special advisor to Rini Mariani Soemarno, the Indonesian Minister of State Owned Enterprises. Judith Dipodiputro came to public attention in 1988 for her involvement as Executive Director of PPIP, an organization established under the patronage at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Francisco Xavier do Amaral, Lopes da Cruz, E.M. Tomodok and Josef Muskita. PPIP sought public support for the resolution of political differences between the Indonesian and Portuguese governments on Timor Timur, while running welfare-creation initiatives for rural communities in the province.

Dipodiputro started promoting decentralization of authority from central government to regional governments when she was assistant to Ikhyar Musa, Chairman of the then Badan Koordinasi Otomatisasi Aparatur Negara, under the Ministry of State Apparatus. She became involved in the Pro-LH project, where regional governments of Kalimantan Timur, Kalimantan Tengah and Kalimantan Selatan became prototypes for decentralization of authority in environmental management. Base of the result of these prototypes was the promulgation of Keputusan Presiden No. 97/1995. She served as Special Assistant (Staff Khusus) to the Governor of Kalimantan Timur and the Vice Governor of Kalimantan Tengah; and as Special Advisor (Staff Ahli) to Bupati of Kutai Kartanegara.
