The triplets, who had three others siblings, were raised in Ridgewood, New Jersey and graduated from Ridgewood High School in 1986, before moving on to play college tennis together for Duke University, with all three also competing on the WTA Tour.Finn, Robin. \"Tennis: Secret Sharer: O'Reilly Is Dead, but Her Gift Lives On; A Tennis-Playing Triplet Made Sure She Spent Her Life as More Than a Mere Curiosity\", The New York Times, October 15, 1993. Accessed September 6, 2019. \"When Maryann Tierney, coach of Ridgewood High School's girls tennis team, boarded a school bus for the ride to a meet against neighboring Paramus the other day, she was taken aback by the silence that had replaced her players' usual pre-game chatter.... Tierney never coached O'Reilly, who along with sisters Patti and Terri formed Ridgewood's famous triplet trio that dominated national junior competition in the Eastern region before all three were graduated from high school in 1986 and enrolled at Duke.\" While at Duke University she was named four times on the All-ACC team and was the ACC Player of the Year in 1990. A left-handed player, unlike her sisters, O'Reilly was the highest ranked of the trio on the professional tour, peaking at 206 in the world in 1993. She qualified for the Australian Open in both 1992 and 1993. As a doubles player she featured in the main draw of all four grand slam tournaments. ==ITF finals== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; width:15%;\" |- style=\"background:lightblue;\" | $25,000 tournaments |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" | $10,000 tournaments |} ===Singles: 1 (1\u20130)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=font-size:97% |- !
