Due to this struggle, it failed to garner enough hype to the film. ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Award !scope=\"col\"| Category !scope=\"col\"| Recipients !scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"22\" | 8th Gaumee Film Awards | Best Supporting Actor | Ismail Rasheed | |style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | Best Supporting Actress | Niuma Mohamed | |style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | Best Male Debut | Mohamed Jumayyil | |style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | Best Female Playback Singer | Shifa Thaufeeq for \"Hiy Meygaa Mibunanee\" | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Screenplay | Ahmed Nimal | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Background Music | Ayyuman Shareef | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Sound Mixing | Ayyuman Shareef, Ahmed Nimal | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- |} ==References== Category:2014 films Category:Maldivian films Category:2014 drama films Category:Maldivian drama films ",
