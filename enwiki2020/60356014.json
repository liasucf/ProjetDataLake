    "text": "Joiri Minaya (born 1990) is a Dominican-American artist based in New York City. She works with digital media, photography, film, performance, sculpture, textiles and painting. ==Art== Joiri Minaya's artwork is inspired by her life experience growing up in the Dominican Republic as well as living and navigating the United States. She explores ideas of identity, in context of colonialism and stereotypes. Minaya has done a variety of installation based pieces, many of which focus on patterns, textiles and their cultural implications. Containers (2015) is a photography and performance art piece, first performed in Socrates Sculpture Park in 2016. The work included women dressed in spandex body suits with a bright tropical print. #dominicanwomengooglesearch (2016) was a hanging sculptural piece in which Minaya took images from the results of the Google Search \"Dominican women\", and edited them with Photoshop. Each component was enlarged, printed, and hung up along with silhouettes created with tropical patterns. Minaya also works with sculpture: Perteneciente (Belonging) (2013) contains two female busts, which are connected by a thick braid of hair. A more recent work is Tropticon (2018), a greenhouse in Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island, NY. The outer walls of the greenhouse are covered with images of pixelated tropical plants. ==Selected exhibitions== ===Solo exhibitions=== *2015 Dom\u00e9stica For\u00e1nea, Centro de la Imagen, Santo Domingo, R.D. *2016 #dominicanwomengooglesearch, Sunroom Project Space at Wave Hill, Bronx, NY, U.S. *2016 Uncatered (solo show), Guttenberg Arts, NJ, U.S. *2016 Redecode: a tropical theme is a great way to create a fresh, peaceful, relaxing atmosphere, El Museo del Barrio, NY, U.S. ===Group exhibitions=== *2016 Art + Crush: Elliot Jerome Brown Jr., Platform Gallery, Baltimore, MD, U.S. *2016 Pulse / Trigger, Sine Gallery, Newark, NJ, U.S. *2016 20th Anniversary Show, Smack Mellon, Brooklyn, NY, U.S. *2016 Intro, Lucy Garc\u00eda Arte Contempor\u00e1neo, Santo Domingo, D.R. *2016 Living in My Skin, R\u00edo III Gallery, Broadway Housing Communities, NY, U.S. *2016 Sams\u00f8\u00f1 Gallery selection of works for NADA Art Fair, NY, U.S. *2016 Gloria, Casa Quien, Santo Domingo, D.R. *2016 Remix en Cara\u00efbe at Tropiques Atrium, Fort-de-France, Martinique. ==Awards== *2013 Exhibition Prize 2014, Centro de la Imagen, Santo Domingo, R.D. *2013 Great Prize XXVII Bienal de Artes Visuales, Museo de Arte Moderno, Santo Domingo, R.D. *2014 Great Prize XXV Concurso de Arte Eduardo Le\u00f3n Jimenes, Centro Le\u00f3n, Santiago, D.R. *2015 Audience Award, XXV Concurso de Arte Eduardo Le\u00f3n Jimenes, Centro Le\u00f3n, Santiago, D.R. *2015 Joan Mitchell Foundation Emerging Artist Grant *2016 Rema Hort Mann Emerging Artist Grant ==References== Category:American contemporary artists Category:American women artists Category:Dominican Republic emigrants to the United States Category:Living people Category:1990 births ",
