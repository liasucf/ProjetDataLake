This group of islands is home to an important bird reserve, and is the home of various seabirds, including northern gannets, cormorants, and members of the Alcidae family (puffins, common guillemots, razorbills). This is also a reserve for grey seals. == Islands of the Archipelago == Despite its name, the Sept-Iles are only made up of five islands and a handful of rocks. The French name Sept-Iles derived from a misunderstanding of the old Breton name for the islands, the Sentiles. The name stuck, however, and two groups of reefs were designated as islands in order for the name to stay true. The 5 main islands (or Enez in Breton) are as followed: * Enez Bonno in Breton, \u00cele Bono in French: the largest of the islands; * Enez Plat in Breton, \u00cele plate in French; * Enez ar Breur or Jentilez in Breton, \u00cele aux Moines in French: the only island accessible to the public, where you can find a lighthouse and the remains of a fort; * Melbann in Breton, \u00cele de Malban in French; * Riouzig in Breton, \u00cele Rouzic in French: the main spot for birds. In addition to these islands, the two reefs are called ar Zerr in Breton, le Cerf in French (the deer), and Kostann. Other islets include Enez ar Razhed (Rat island) and ar Moudenno\u00f9. The isle of Taveeg (Tom\u00e9) is closer to the coast, and is not considered part of the archipelago. == Gallery == L'\u00cele aux moines - 7 iles.jpg|Enez ar Breur, with the lighthouse and the fort \u00cele plate 1.jpg|Enez plat Malban.jpg|Enez Melbann Colonie de fous de bassan.jpg|Enez Riouzig == See also == * Sept-\u00celes Lighthouse * Battle of Sept-\u00celes ==References== Category:Islands of Brittany ",
