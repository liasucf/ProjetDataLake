    "text": "Cheena Bhavana, (Institute of Chinese Language and Culture) of Visva-Bharati University, founded in 1937, is a centre of Sino-Indian cultural studies located at Santiniketan in West Bengal, India. Its reputation as a center promoting historical study and modern relations between the two countries was built by such figures as Rabindranath Tagore and Tan Yun-Shan. The library is known for a major collection of Chinese books and journals, especially Buddhist scriptures and texts. ==The beginning== Cheena Bhavana was a part of Tagore's grand concept of the world making its home in a single nest, Tan Yun- Shan was the person who built and developed Cheena Bhavana. He was born in Hunan province of China and belonged to a distinguished family of scholars. A calligraphist, poet, essayist, author and writer, Tan was also a linguist trained in Chinese classical literature and philosophy. In his personal life he was a devoted Mahayana Buddhist and a Confucian scholar versed in Confucian classics, Laozi (Lao-Tze)\u2019s philosophy, and Chinese metaphysics. He gained the reputation of being able to satisfy all with his sober approach and his politeness left a mark in the minds of those with whom he came in regular contact. Rabindranath Tagore discovered Tan Yun-Shan in Malaya in 1927, three years after his historic visit to China. Inspired by the poet\u2019s message of peace and understanding, Tan arrived in Santiniketan and immersed himself in cultural dialogue with the intellectual elite of the ashram. At the same time, he engaged himself in Indological studies. India and China had for ages a rich tradition of cultural exchange. The names of Faxian (Fa Hien), Xuangzang (Hiuen Tsang) and Yijing (I-Tsing) were well-known, but there had been a break of a thousand years in such exchanges. The idea struck both the poet and the Chinese scholar that a permanent institute could serve as a nucleus for cultural exchange. Tan Yun-Shan went to China in 1931, to acquaint people there about the ideals of Tagore's Visva Bharati and garner support for cultural cooperation. With a warm response for cultural cooperation, the Sino- Indian Cultural Society was initiated at Nanjing in 1933. He returned to India the next year and a similar society was set up in 1934. The Cheena Bhavana was established in 1937. He spent over 30 years in its service. ==The building== At Santiniketan Tan Yun-Shan realised that his work required a separate hall/ building but Visva Bharati, then a private institution, was short of funds. Tan decided to move around to collect money for the purpose and he took on odd jobs to support himself. He went to Singapore, Rangoon and China for the purpose. Tan came back to Santiniketan in 1936 with adequate funds (Rs. 50,000) for his cherished China Hall and 100,000 books (collected with the support of the Sino-Indian Cultural Society). Tagore was thrilled and allotted land in the heart of Santiniketan for construction of Cheena Bhavana. The hall was designed in collaboration with Surendranath Kar and Tang supervised its construction. The building was completed in record time. Nandalal Bose, Benode Behari Mukherjee and others from Kala Bhavana adorned the hall with beautiful frescoes and relief work. Chinese calligraphy written by Lin Sen, the President of China, was placed in the centre-front on the building with similar calligraphy by Tai Chi-Tao at centre-rear. Tan planted trees all around the building. On 14 April 1937, Cheena Bhavana, the first institute of its kind in India, was formally inaugurated by Indira Gandhi. Tan was appointed its first director. However, in view of Visva Bharati\u2019s grim financial situation Tan refused to take a salary. The Chinese government provided him an honorarium. Mahatma Gandhi, in his message to Tagore said: \u201cMay the Chinese Hall be a symbol of living contact between China and India\u201d. Jugal Kishore Birla donated Rs. 5,000 to start research activities. Fund collection continued. In 1942, Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese nationalist leader and supremo, and Madame Chiang, visited Cheena Bhavana. They were pleased with the progress of the institution that had already received financial support from China and announced a further donation of Rs. 50,000. In 1957, during a trip to India, Zhou Enlai, the Chinese premier, visited Santiniketan. He came to Cheena Bhavana and donated Rs. 60,000 for a memorial to Tagore. ==The institution== Tagore died in 1941. He had planted the seed that had started germinating. It was left to Tan, almost single-handedly, to make it grow, in spite of barriers and vicissitudes. He made it a \u2018monumental edifice\u2019. Even after Visva Bharati became a central university Tan helped to maintain its magnificent stature. Two characteristics that developed in Cheena Bhavana under Tan Yun-Shan are notable. First, it led to the establishment of Chinese studies in other places in India. Second, for a considerable period, teachers for the new institutes were drawn from Cheena Bhavana. It is thought that Cheena Bhavana was more than a mere academic institution and its special achievements are having a permanent value. First, it generated new ideas about Sino-Indian culture that flew out and permeated the environment. Second, it became a sort of a model and functioned as a cradle of Sino-Indian affection. Third, it functioned as a link and bridge between India and China. ==Some linkages with Cheena Bhavana== Some important linkages with Cheena Bhavana are given below: *1939 \u2013 The first Chinese Buddhist Mission to India led by Taixu spent a week at Santiniketan as guests in Cheena Bhavana. *1940 \u2013 Tai Chi-Tao, Buddhist scholar and admirer of Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore visited Santiniketan *1941\u20131945 \u2013 Chin Ke-Mu spent several semesters in Cheena Bhavana and returned to Beijing University as a Professor of Sanskrit. *1941\u20131943 \u2013 Karuna Kusalasaya spent two years as research scholar and assisted the Director.

In an interview published in The Telegraph, in 2012, Amitendranath Tagore provided some interesting insights. First, all five students were provided with a scholarship of Rs. 30, a gift from Madame Chiang Kai-Shek to Prof Tan. Second, Every Wednesday, Prof Tan used to stay mauna (silent). When he spoke in the evening all the students gathered round him, and Mrs. Tan served everybody some Chinese meal, with ingredients from her vegetable garden. ==Courses== Cheena Bhavana is the oldest centre for Chinese studies in this sub-continent, and functions as the department of Chinese language and culture of Visva Bharati University.

The importance and highlights of the library are suitably summarised here: \u201cThe Chinese Library in Cheena-Bhavana owes its existence to professor Tan\u2019s herculean efforts.

D.) and the reproduction of the CH\u2019ing or the so-called Dragon Edition (1936) of the Buddhist Tripitaka along with many separate volumes of important Buddhist works and a large number of selected Chinese works representing the Chinese classics, history, philosophy and literature. Ten sets of the Shanghai edition of the Chinese Buddhist Tripitaka were presented to the library by the Chinese people of which Professor Tan has presented nine sets to the universities in India. This edition of the Tripitaka contains 1916 different books consisting of 8,416 Fascicles of which most were translated from Sanskrit and the originals are now lost in India.
