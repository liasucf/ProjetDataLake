It is widespread across much of the United States and Canada, primarily the Great Lakes region from Ontario south to Texas and Alabama. Additional populations are found in the states of the Atlantic Coast from Maine to Georgia, but these appear to be introduced.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution maps Helianthus mollis grows on prairies and roadsides. It is a perennial herb up to 150 cm (5 feet) tall, spreading by means of underground rhizomes. Leaves are mostly along the stem rather than crowded near the base, each egg-shaped with teeth along the edges. One plant produces 1-15 flower heads containing 17-22 yellow ray florets surrounding 75 or more yellow disc florets.Flora of North America, Helianthus mollis Lam., 1789.
