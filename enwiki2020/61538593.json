    "text": "Crazy Six is a 1998 American-Slovak gangster film starring Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, Ice-T, and Burt Reynolds. It was directed by Albert Pyun. ==Plot== A decade after the fall of communism, a section of Eastern Europe known as \"Crimeland\" becomes a trade route for drugs and weapons. Billie (\"Crazy Six\") and his friends rob a plutonium deal involving Raul in order to obtain money for their drug habits with the aid of Dirty Mao, who cheats them out of the money in the end. Raul is given 48 hours by his boss to recover the goods and begins by hunting them down at a local club, injuring the singer Anna and killing Andrew's girlfriend Viyana. The American detective Dakota interviews Anna, leading him to Billie. Anna is kidnapped by Raul's men and forced to smoke crack. Billie and Andrew rob Dirty Mao's hideout and recover the money. Dakota follows them to the exchange with Raul, but so does Dirty Mao. After a gunfight between Dakota and Raul's men, Dirty Mao kills Raul and attempts to frame Billie for it but is shot and killed by Dakota. In the end, Dakota adopts Dirty Mao's dog, Anna returns to singing, and Billie gets clean. ==Cast== *Rob Lowe as Billie, a.k.a.
