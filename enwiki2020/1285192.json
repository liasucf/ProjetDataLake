The ship then sank in international waters three months later. It was owned by International Shipping Partners and insured for $20M when its value was estimated at $5\u20136M. ==History== SeaBreeze as Federico C in Genova, Italy during sea trials in 1958. Federico CNassau, Bahamas in 1985. The ship was launched on 31 March 1957 and completed in March 1958 by the Ansaldo Sestri Ponente shipyard in Italy as Federico C, the first new ship built for the Costa Line. The ship initially provided a liner service between Genoa, Italy and Buenos Aires, Argentina via Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1966 Federico C was transferred to a service between Genoa and Florida, the Caribbean and Venezuela. The ship had a major refit in 1968, then added Caribbean cruises between trans-Atlantic trips. Federico C operated cruises exclusively from 1972 to 1983, when the ship was sold. In 1983, Premier Cruises obtained the ship and named it Royale; it became StarShip Royale in the same year. In 1988, the ship was renamed SeaBreeze when it was placed in service for Dolphin Cruise Lines. One year later, the ship was refurbished. Premier took possession of the ship when it acquired Dolphin in 1997. When Premier went out of business in September 2000, the ship was ordered to immediately cease operations. SeaBreeze of the coast of Lim\u00f3n, Costa Rica in 1999 At the time, it was docked at a Canadian port, and sailed some days later to be laid up in Freeport, Bahamas. ==Sinking== SeaBreeze sinking near Cape Charles. On December 17, 2000, the ship sank off the coast of North Carolina/Virginia. The boiler allegedly broke off and damaged the ship. The investigation into the sinking of Seabreeze I caused international concern, based upon numerous suspicious incidents, including the fact that the ship was likely to fetch only between $5 and $6 million for scrap, but had a $20 million insurance policy on it. The cruise ship sank in international waters flying the Panamanian flag, making Panama responsible for the investigation of the sinking. The ship's captain told the United States Coast Guard rescuers that his boat was in imminent danger of sinking as a result of its engine room being flooded in high winds and seas. At the time, the Coast Guard rescuers believed that it was highly unlikely for a ship that large to sink that quickly, and were astonished when the Greek captain demanded that all hands be extracted from the ship, instead of requesting salvage tugs and trying to tow it to shore for recovery. Subsequently, all 34 crewmembers were rescued; there were no passengers on board. At the time of the sinking, Steven Cotton of the International Transport Workers' Federation in London stated that he wished that the ship, which went down off the Virginia coast, had gone down closer to the coast because that would have put the case in the hands of American investigators. According to Cotton, \"Panama's track record of carrying out comprehensive investigations into vessel sinkings is not very good.\" The vessel had just been purchased by Cruise Ventures III, a subsidiary of New York-based DLJ Capital Funding and was traveling from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Charleston, South Carolina.Cruise ship sinks day after crew rescued ==References== ==External links== * Review of the Seabreeze Category:1957 ships Category:Costa Cruises Category:Cruise ships Category:Maritime incidents in 2000 Category:Ships built in Genoa Category:Shipwrecks of the Virginia coast Category:Ships built by Gio.
