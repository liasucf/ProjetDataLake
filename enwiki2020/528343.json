    "text": "Akshobhya Akshobhya (, Ak\u1e63obhya, \"Immovable One\"; ) is one of the Five Wisdom Buddhas, a product of the Adibuddha, who represents consciousness as an aspect of reality. By convention he is located in the east of the Diamond Realm and is the lord of the Eastern Pure Land Abhirati ('The Joyous'). His consort is Lochan\u0101 and he is normally accompanied by two elephants. His color is blue- black and his attributes include a bell, three robes, and staff, as well as a jewel, lotus, prayer wheel, and sword. He has several emanations. ==Origin== Akshobhya appears in the Ak\u1e63obhyatath\u0101gatasyavy\u016bha S\u016btra (), which was translated during the second century CE and is among oldest known Mahayana or Pure Land text.Strauch, Ingo (2008). The Bajaur collection: A new collection of Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b manuscripts \u2013 A preliminary catalogue and survey According to the scripture, a monk wished to practice the Dharma in the eastern world of delight and made a vow not to harbor anger or malice towards any being until he achieved enlightenment. He duly proved \"immovable\" and when he succeeded, he became the buddha Akshobhya. Akshobhya is sometimes merged with , whose name also means \"immovable\" in Sanskrit. However, Acala is not a Buddha, but one of the Five Wisdom Kings of the Womb Realm in Vajrayana. Prior to the advent of Bhai\u1e63ajyaguru (Japanese: \u85ac\u5e2b\u5982\u6765 Yakushi Nyorai), Akshobhya was the subject of a minor cult in Japan as a healing Buddha, though both are currently venerated within the Shingon Buddhism. Recently, newly discovered G\u0101ndh\u0101r\u012b texts from Pakistan in the Bajaur Collection have been found to contain fragments of an early Mah\u0101y\u0101na sutra mentioning Akshobhya. Preliminary dating through paleography suggests a late 1st century to early 2nd century CE provenance. More conclusive radiocarbon dating is under way. A preliminary report on these texts has been issued by Ingo Strauch, with a paper on Akshobhya texts published in 2010.Strauch, Ingo (2010). More missing pieces of Early Pure Land Buddhism: New evidence for Ak\u1e63obhya and Abhirati in an early Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btra from Gandh\u0101ra; Eastern Buddhist 41, 23-66. ==Doctrine== ==Iconography== Akshobhya is the embodiment of 'mirror knowledge' (; refer Panchajnana). This may be described as a knowledge of what is real, and what is illusion, or a mere reflection of actual reality. The mirror may be likened to the mind itself. It is clear like the sky and empty, yet luminous. It holds all the images of space and time, yet it is untouched by them. Its brilliance illuminates the darkness of ignorance and its sharpness cuts through confusion. Akshobhya represents this eternal mind, and the Vajra family is similarly associated with it. The Vajra family, is also associated with the element of water, hence the two colours of the Vajra being blue, like the depths of the ocean; or bright white, like sunlight reflecting off water. Even if the surface of the ocean is blown into crashing waves, the depths remain undisturbed, imperturbable. Although water may seem ethereal and weightless, in truth it is extremely heavy. Water flows into the lowest place and settles there. It carves through solid rock, but calmly, without violence. When frozen, it is hard, sharp, and clear like the intellect, but to reach its full potential, it must also be fluid and adaptable like a flowing river. These are all the essential qualities of Akshobhya. Many wrathful, tantric beings are represented as blue in colour because they embody the transmuted energy of hatred and aggression into wisdom and enlightenment. ==References== ==Bibliography== *Jordan, Michael, Encyclopedia of Gods, New York, Facts On File, Inc. 1993, pp. 9\u201310 *Nattier, Jan (2000). \"The Realm of Aksobhya: A Missing Piece in the History of Pure Land Buddhism\".
