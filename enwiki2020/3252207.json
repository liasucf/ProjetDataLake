    "text": "(English translation: Princess Holiday: Rolling Apple Pavilion's One Thousand and One Nights), usually shortened to Princess Holiday, is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by August and released for Windows PCs on September 27, 2002. It was later ported to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 consoles. Princess Holiday's story follows Cliff Cloud, who has to help the princess, Leticia La Mew Symphonia, stay undercover under the name Leticia Apple in his hometown. Princess Holiday enjoyed high sales, charting five times in the national sales ranking of bish\u014djo games. The gameplay follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the player character. Princess Holiday has made transitions into other media, such as a light novel, art book, albums, and a 2-episode original video animation (OVA) series produced by Tadama Film. ==Gameplay== Average dialogue and narrative in Princess Holiday depicting Leticia (left) and Shilphy (right). Princess Holiday is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Cliff Cloud. Much of its gameplay is spent reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Cliff is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. Princess Holiday follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. In the original Windows version, there are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The DC version extend Diana's scenario, allowing players to try and win her over as well. Also, the port increases the number of endings to twelve, two for each heroine. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. Some decisions can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternative ending to the plot. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. In the Windows version, there are scenes depicting Cliff and a given heroine having sex. However, later ports remove the adult content. ==Plot and characters== Princess Holiday takes place in a medieval town near a kingdom.
