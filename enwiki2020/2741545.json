The company was founded in 2001 and is based in San Carlos, California. MarkLogic is a privately held company with over 500 employees and has offices in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The company claims to have over 1,000 customers, including Chevron, JPMorgan Chase, Erie Insurance Group, Johnson & Johnson, and the US Army. In addition, six of the top ten global banks are MarkLogic customers. In 2016 Forrester Research ranked MarkLogic as one of the nine leading NoSQL database vendors in the market, and appeared in several Gartner Magic Quadrant reports for Operational Database Management Systems. In 2017, Gartner ranked MarkLogic as a 'Visionary' in the data warehouse market. ==History== MarkLogic was first named Cerisent and was founded in 2001 by Christopher Lindblad, who was the Chief Architect of the Ultraseek search engine at Infoseek, and Paul Pedersen, a professor of computer science at Cornell University and UCLA, and Frank R. Caufield, Founder of Darwin Ventures, to address shortcomings with existing search and data products. The product first focused on using XML document markup standard and XQuery as the query standard for accessing collections of documents up to hundreds of terabytes in size. In 2009 IDC mentioned MarkLogic in a report as one of the top Innovative Information Access Companies with under $100 million in revenue. In May 2012, Gary Bloom was appointed as Chief Executive Officer. He held senior positions at Symantec Corporation, Veritas Software, and Oracle. === Funding === MarkLogic obtained its first financing of $6 million in 2002 led by Sequoia Capital, followed by a $12 million investment in June 2004, this time led by Lehman Brothers Venture Partners.
