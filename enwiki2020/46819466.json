Oslo: Gyldendal. ==Education and career== Together with his brother Ole, Jens attended the Kristiansand Cathedral School for three years before the family moved to Christiania (now Oslo) in 1833. There they attended the private Headmaster M\u00f8ller Institute (), which Ulrik Wilhelm M\u00f8ller (1791\u20131853) had founded in 1822. Jens studied there until he received his candidatus theologi\u00e6 degree in 1843, and then he became a teacher at the Nissen Latin and Secondary School (), which his brother Ole had also just started teaching at. In 1845 he became a research fellow at the Royal Frederik University (now the University of Oslo), and was its second teacher in oriental studies and oriental languages, especially Arabic. He studied abroad and was hosted, among others, by Heinrich Leberecht Fleischer (1801\u20131888) in Leipzig, the same place where the prominent theologian Carl Paul Caspari (1814\u20131892) stayed from 1834 to 1838 and received his doctorate in 1842. It was the experience of Broch and Caspari in Leipzig that later inspired the theologian Elias Blix (1836\u20131902) to stay in the city from 1871 to 1872.Om at Blix bes\u00f8kte Broch og Caspari on BlixBlog, November 7, 2006 Broch also had a long stay abroad from 1853 to 1855. In 1859 he published the first Arabic text in Norway and he translated many poems from Arabic. He was elected to the newly established Christiania Science Society (now the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters) in 1859, and to the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1877. He became an associate lecturer in 1865 and a full professor in 1876. His main work is a very careful edition of Al-Zamakhshari's grammatical work Al-Mufassal (1879). ==References== ==External links== *BIBSYS: Publications by Jens Peter Broch Category:Linguists from Norway Category:Members of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters Category:People from Kristiansand Category:1819 births Category:1886 deaths Category:Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters ",
