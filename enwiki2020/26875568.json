The yazh was an open-stringed polyphonous instrument, with gut strings (narambu) with a wooden boat-shaped skin-covered resonator and an ebony stem. ==Historical descriptions== The Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar mentions yazh in his work Thirukkural. Many major Tamil classical literary masterpieces written during Sangam period have mentioned the yazh. Silappatikaram, written by a Tamil Chera prince Ilango Adigal, mentions four kinds of yazhs: *Periyazh - 21 strings *Makarayazh - 19 strings *Cakotayazh - 14 strings *Cenkottiyazh - 7 strings Yazh was played in Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple in early centuries it was mentioned in ShaivaThirumurai 11th Pathigam.
