King, a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, became joint holder of the record on October 20, 1956 in Ontario, California, with a time of 10.1 seconds, equal with Willie Williams and Ira Murchison, and repeated the time a week later in Santa Ana, California. (In 1956, times were only recorded to the nearest tenth of a second.) Ray Norton also recorded a time of 10.1 seconds in 1959.
