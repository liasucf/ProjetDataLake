The Working Equitation discipline is intended to promote competition between traditional styles of riding used during fieldwork in various countries, and also to act as a showcase for traditional riding costumes and equipment. Working Equitation became a competitive sport in 1996 along with its first European championship being held in Italy the same year. Working Equitation is recognised as a sport in many countries, mostly in South America and Europe, all countries have their own governing body of the sport. The sport tests the horse and rider's partnership and ability to manoeuvre obstacles. There are four different levels of Working Equitation: Novice, Intermediate, Junior and Advanced. At advanced level, the rider must ride with just one hand, most commonly their left hand, on the reins. Competition events may be individual or for teams, and are in three or four parts, in this order: * Dressage, in which the horse and rider perform obligatory movements in a freestyle dressage test to music within a specified time scale. * Ease of Handling Trial, a gymkhana-type event in which horses must overcome obstacles similar to those likely to appear in the field, such as bridges and gates. The obstacle course is designed to show the partnership between horse and rider. * Speed, where similar obstacles must be overcome, but against time * Cow (only for team competitions), in which the four team members separate a specific numbered cow from a group. The Team event at the 2010 European Working Equitation Championships was won by riders from Portugal. ==World Championships== The first Working Equitation World Championship was held from 11\u201313 October 2002 at Beja, Portugal, with teams from Brazil, France, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.
