    "text": "\"You Are The Only One\" was the Croatian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, performed in English by Ivan Mikuli\u0107. As Croatia had not pre-qualified for the final, the song was performed eighteenth in the semi-final (following Estonia's Neiok\u00f5s\u00f5 with \"Tii\" and preceding Denmark's Thomas Thordarson with \"Shame On You\"). Here, it received 72 points, finishing 9th in the 22-song field and qualifying for the final. In the final, it was performed eleventh (following Ukraine's Ruslana with \"Wild Dances\" and preceding Bosnia and Herzegovina's Deen with \"In The Disco\"). At the close of voting, it had received 50 points, placing 12th in a field of 24 and requiring Croatia to qualify through the semi-final at their next Contest (upon a tie-break which granted Malta automatic qualification for the 2005 final). The song itself is a power ballad, with the singer declaring that his lover is \"a part of me, who lives for me, who would die for me\". Pre-Contest publicity had focused on Mikuli\u0107's vocal range, which was generally agreed to be at least four octaves. The song was performed in a very simple manner, with Mikuli\u0107 largely alone on stage. The decision to perform the song in English was taken by a poll in Croatia, with the English version triumphing over the Croatian version, titled \"Daje\u0161 mi krila\" (You Give Me Wings), by a very narrow margin. There is in fact a second version in English as well, titled \"You Were My Only One\", presenting a negative view at the end of the relationship described in the other lyrics. It was succeeded as Croatian representative at the 2005 Contest by Boris Novkovi\u0107 with \"Vukovi umiru sami\". ==References== Category:Eurovision songs of 2004 Category:Eurovision songs of Croatia Category:English-language Croatian songs Category:2004 songs ",
