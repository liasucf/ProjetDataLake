    "text": "Rubber pollution, similar to plastic pollution, occurs in various environments, and originates from a variety of sources, ranging from the food industry processing chain to tire wear. Synthetic and natural rubber dust and fragments now occur in food, airborne as particulates in air pollution, hidden in the earth as soil pollution, and in waterways, lakes and the sea. ==Sources== Tyre wear is major source of rubber pollution.Tyre and road wear particles (TRWP) - A review of generation, properties, emissions, human health risk, ecotoxicity, and fate in the environmentPollution warning over car tyre and brake dust Emissions Analytics finds pollution from tire wear can be 1,000x worse than exhaust emissions A concern hereby is that vehicle tire wear pollution (which is part of non-exhaust emissionsNon Exhaust Emissions term or NEEs) are completely unregulated, unlike exhaust emissions.Emissions Analytics finds pollution from tire wear can be 1,000x worse than exhaust emissions Some devices are nonetheless being developed in an effort to reduce the amount of particulates coming from the tyre and otherwise ending up in the atmosphere. STUDENT'S INVENTION TO STOP MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION WINS DYSON AWARD Besides rubber from tires however, the sources can be artificial turf and rubber O-rings and seals . Although not immediately visible to the naked eye, tire dust makes up a significant portion of road debris. ==Classification== Very fine rubber dust particles can depending on the classification be counted among microplastic (because rubber is just another polymer) or separately (because its constituent monomers, the required additives, and the type of chemical bond mesh is slightly different). In a similar vein, rubber pollution is often implicitly mentioned when plastic pollution is addressed. ==See also== *Carbonyl sulfide *Hydrofuramide ==References== Category:Rubber industry Category:Pollution ",
