Available: http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=3207. Last accessed 18/03/2015. Most of Tasmania\u2019s rainforests occur in the North-West and throughout the North East highlands.Parks and wildlife service. (2011). Tasmania's Cool Temperate Rainforest. Available: http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=3207. Last accessed 18/03/2015. Cool temperate rainforests typically have a heavy rainfall, cool climate, favor high altitudes and have a limited availability of light.Parks and wildlife service. (2011). Tasmania's Cool Temperate Rainforest. Available: http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=3207. Last accessed 18/03/2015. == Diversity == The diversity of vascular plants in cool temperate rainforests is unquestionably lower than in tropical rainforests as a result of the cooler climates and other various factors that reduce the growth rate of plants, such as the availability of light.Parks and wildlife service. (2011). Tasmania's Cool Temperate Rainforest. Available: http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=3207. Last accessed 18/03/2015. Many of the species that are present in Tasmania\u2019s cool temperate rainforests are endemic; this has been attributed to the isolation of Tasmania from the mainland during interglacial periods, which restricted the dispersal of many species between the two land masses.asmanian government. (2015). Tasmanias native plant species. Available: http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/conservation/flora-of-tasmania/native-plant-species. Last accessed 18/03/15. This high level of endemism results in Tasmania\u2019s cool temperate rainforests being characterized by a community of rainforest species unique to the state. Portions of the species that have managed to dominate these unique forests are ferns. There is a diverse range of ferns present within these forests, which vary in form, size, substrate preference and habit.Tasmanian government. (2015). Tasmanias native plant species. Available: http://dpipwe.tas.gov.au/conservation/flora-of-tasmania/native-plant-species. Last accessed 18/03/15. The following describes some of the major fern species to grow in Tasmania\u2019s cool temperate rainforests. == Species == * Histiopteris incisa Commonly known as Batswing fern, its abundant in areas of high disturbance such as where a tree has fallen or a flood has occurred.P. R. Bell. (1979). Nucleocytoplasmic Interaction During Maturation of the Egg of the Fern Histiopteris incisa (Thunb.) J. Smith. Annals of botany. 45 (4), 4-6. Bats wing fern can form large colonies, growing from their own rhizome in the ground, excluding other species if it favors the environment enough.P. R. Bell. (1979). Nucleocytoplasmic Interaction During Maturation of the Egg of the Fern Histiopteris incisa (Thunb.) J. Smith. Annals of botany. 45 (4), 4-6. The pinnae are pale green with pinnules close to the stalk creating a \u2018batwing\u2019 shape giving the fern its common name. Histiopteris incisa has a worldwide distribution.P. R. Bell. (1979). Nucleocytoplasmic Interaction During Maturation of the Egg of the Fern Histiopteris incisa (Thunb.) J. Smith. Annals of botany. 45 (4), 4-6. * Parablechnum wattsii Also known as hard waterfern, Parablechnum wattsii has thick large fronds growing from its rhizome in the ground.Tasmanian government. (2014). Blechnum wattsii. Flora of Tasmania. 1 (1), 1-3. There are two types of fronds on this species, one being a sterol frond, and the other a fertile frond.Walsh, N.G. & Entwisle, T.J. (1994) Flora of Victoria. Vol. 2. Inkata Press, Melbourne. Parablechnum wattsii prefers very wet areas and cannot tolerate dry soils.Walsh, N.G. & Entwisle, T.J. (1994) Flora of Victoria. Vol. 2. Inkata Press, Melbourne. Hard waterfern prefers to grow as an individual rather than a large colony. This fern is able to tolerate waterlogged sites, sites with poor soil quality, and windy sites.Walsh, N.G. & Entwisle, T.J. (1994) Flora of Victoria. Vol. 2. Inkata Press, Melbourne. * Lomaria nuda Lomaria nuda is also known as fishbone fern as its pinnules are arranged like the bones of a fish. This species grows from its creeping rhizome which can form an erect sturdy trunk as high as one meter.Garrett, M. (1996) The Ferns of Tasmania. Their Ecology and Distribution. Tasmanian Forest Research Council, Hobart. Like Parablechnum wattsii, Lomaria nuda has two types of fronds, one frond is sterol while the other is fertile and also prefers wet habitats.Garrett, M. (1996) The Ferns of Tasmania. Their Ecology and Distribution. Tasmanian Forest Research Council, Hobart. * Asplenium appendiculatum Asplenium appendiculatum is a fern that grows in the understory of wet forests.Brownsey, P.J.. (2014). Asplenium appendiculatum. Available: http://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora_details.aspx?ID=1519. Last accessed 18/03/2015. The fern grows along its rhizome that spreads over the ground, rocks and up the trunks of Dicksonia Antarctica.Brownsey, P.J.. (2014). Asplenium appendiculatum. Available: http://www.nzpcn.org.nz/flora_details.aspx?ID=1519.

(2002). Ecophysiology of the Soft Tree Fern, Dicksonia antarctica Labill. Austral Ecology. 27 (4), 360-368. The tree fern forms outgrowths of fibrous rootlets on its erect rhizome that forming a strong trunk.M. A. Hunt, N. J. Davidson, G. L. Unwin, and D. C. Close. (2002). Ecophysiology of the Soft Tree Fern, Dicksonia antarctica Labill. Austral Ecology. 27 (4), 360-368. This trunk provides a substrate on which other plants can germinate and grow.M. A. Hunt, N. J. Davidson, G. L. Unwin, and D. C. Close. (2002). Ecophysiology of the Soft Tree Fern, Dicksonia antarctica Labill. Austral Ecology. 27 (4), 360-368.

Austral Ecology. 27 (4), 360-368. * Polystichum proliferum Commonly known as mother shield fern Polystichum proliferum,P. G. Ladd. (1979). A short pollen diagram from rainforest in highland eastern Victoria. Australian Journal of Ecology. 4 (2), 229-237. favors moist cool areas with filtered shade, hence why it grows abundantly in cool temperate rainforests.P. G. Ladd. (1979). A short pollen diagram from rainforest in highland eastern Victoria. Australian Journal of Ecology. 4 (2), 229-237. The fern grows terrestrially along its rhizome in the ground and can form a strong trunk up to 10 cm high.P. G. Ladd. (1979). A short pollen diagram from rainforest in highland eastern Victoria. Australian Journal of Ecology. 4 (2), 229-237. * Rumohra adiantiformis Rumohra adiantiformis, also known by the name of leathery shieldfern or iron fern, is a common fern in Tasmania\u2019s cool temperate rainforests. Leatherleaf fern extends along its rhizome in the ground and grows upright as part of a forests groundcover.C.J. Geldenhuys, C.J. Van der Merwe . (1988). Population structure and growth of the fern Rumohra adiantiformis in relation to frond harvesting in the southern Cape forests. South African Journal of Botany. 54 (4), 351-362. Triangle-shaped glossy dark leaflets characterize the fern. This plant is not endemic to Tasmania and has a broad distribution. The fern can be found on mainland Australia, New Zealand and far away places such as South Africa, and the Galapagos Islands.C.J. Geldenhuys, C.J. Van der Merwe . (1988). Population structure and growth of the fern Rumohra adiantiformis in relation to frond harvesting in the southern Cape forests. South African Journal of Botany. 54 (4), 351-362. * Notogrammitis billardierei Also known at finger fern, Notogrammitis billardierei is small epiphytic fern that can be found growing on branches, rocks, and logs within Tasmania\u2019s cool temperate forests.Barbara S. Parris. 1998. \"Grammitidaceae\" pages 450-468. In: Anthony E. Orchard (executive editor) and Patrick M. McCarthy (volume editor). Flora of Australia volume 48, Ferns, Gymnosperms, and Allied Groups. ABRS/CSIRO: Melbourne, Australia. One of the finger ferns most preferred substrates in on the trunks of Dicksonia antarctica. The fern is not only found in Tasmania but also on the Australian mainland and New Zealand.Barbara S. Parris. 1998. \"Grammitidaceae\" pages 450-468. In: Anthony E. Orchard (executive editor) and Patrick M. McCarthy (volume editor). Flora of Australia volume 48, Ferns, Gymnosperms, and Allied Groups. ABRS/CSIRO: Melbourne, Australia. * Microsorum pustulatum Commonly known as kangaroo fern, Microsorum pustulatum has smooth leathery bright green fronds. They spread via the fragmentation of their hairy rhizomes and can live as epiphytic plant growing on the trunks of plants such as Dicksonia antarctica or as a lithophytic plant growing over rocks and logs.Peter G. Wilson. \"Microsorum pustulatum\". PlantNET - New South Wales Flora Online. Royal Botanic Gardens & Domain Trust, Sydney Australia. Retrieved 2009-06-08. The plant is distributed over mainland Australia and TasmaniaPeter G. Wilson. \"Microsorum pustulatum\". PlantNET - New South Wales Flora Online.

Commonly named filmy ferns, there are many species of Hypmenophyllum to be found in Tasmania\u2019s cool temperate rainforests, two species that are most common are Hymenophyllum flabellatum, and Hymenophyllum rarum.H. Murray . (2014). Ebot plant science collection. Available: http://ebot.library.usyd.edu.au/view?docId=ebot/records/1083.xml;query=;brand=default. Last accessed 19/03/2015. Filmy ferns are epiphytic ferns that creep along rhizomes at the base of tree ferns and tree trunks. The fern is very thin with leaves only one cell thick.H. Murray . (2014). Ebot plant science collection. Available: http://ebot.library.usyd.edu.au/view?docId=ebot/records/1083.xml;query=;brand=default. Last accessed 19/03/2015. Given the delicate nature of these ferns they are prone to desiccation. They are therefore their distribution is limited to very humid moist habitats such as cool temperate rainforests.H. Murray . (2014). Ebot plant science collection. Available: http://ebot.library.usyd.edu.au/view?docId=ebot/records/1083.xml;query=;brand=default. Last accessed 19/03/2015. Slight changes in the ecology of Tasmania\u2019s cool temperate rainforests could have a huge negative effect on filmy fern populations.H. Murray . (2014). Ebot plant science collection.

This table shows that areas left un disturbed for longer periods of time are host to more species of ferns. The habitat clearfelled and burnt in 1990 has more species of fern present than areas disturbed by forestry in more recent years. == Conservation == Tasmania\u2019s cool temperate rainforest are currently under threat for a variety of reasons. One of the greatest threats to rainforests is from human induced activities.Parks and wildlife service. (2011). Tasmania's Cool Temperate Rainforest. Available: http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=3207. Last accessed 18/03/2015. Fire is one of the largest problems facing rainforests today, either from direct or accidental origin. Although fire can be of benefit to some habitats, species that have evolved in rainforests have not yet been exposed to fire and haven\u2019t acquired the capacity to survive or regenerate in the event of a fire. Such species can include Hymenophyllum sp. and Grammitis billardierei.Parks and wildlife service. (2011). Tasmania's Cool Temperate Rainforest. Available: http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=3207. Last accessed 18/03/2015. In the past 100 years over 7% of Tasmania\u2019s fires have been burnt as a result of arson or industry. Industry poses a huge threat to Tasmanian rainforests.Reid, J. B., Hill, R. S., Brown, M. J. & Hovenden, M. J. (2005) Vegetation of Tasmania, Australian Biological Resources Stud Often the land that rainforests grow on is wanted to convert into mines, dams or agricultural land. Climate change also can have a large effect on the ecology of cool temperate rainforests.Reid, J. B., Hill, R. S., Brown, M. J. & Hovenden, M. J. (2005) Vegetation of Tasmania, Australian Biological Resources Stud Many species living within these forests can only survive in a narrow range of ecological conditions as they have evolved within areas of such stable climatic conditions.Parks and wildlife service. (2011). Tasmania's Cool Temperate Rainforest. Available: http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=3207. Last accessed 18/03/2015. Small changes in the climate as a result of climate change can have negative effects on the growth and dispersal of sensitive rainforest species such as Hymenophyllum sp. These plants are therefore heavily dependent on the conservation of Tasmania\u2019s cool temperate rainforests. Roughly 41% of Tasmania\u2019s rainforests are protected by wilderness world heritage areas, another 25% are protected via reserves, yet the remaining 34% are left unprotected.Parks and wildlife service. (2011). Tasmania's Cool Temperate Rainforest. Available: http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/?base=3207. Last accessed 18/03/2015. For ecologically sensitive rainforest species to survive and for our cool temperate rainforests to persist further protection programs must be implemented. == The Ferns of Tasmania's Cool Temperate Forests == ==References== Category:Geography of Tasmania ",
