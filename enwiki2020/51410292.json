    "text": "Tob\u00edfera Formation () is a volcano-sedimentary formation of Middle to Late Jurassic age. The formation is crops out in the Magallanes Region in southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego of Chile, the Santa Cruz Province of southern Argentina, and in the subsurface of the Malvinas Basin offshore Argentina and the Falkland Islands. == Description == The bulk of the formation originates from silicic pyroclastic material during a period of bimodal volcanism in Rocas Verdes Basin, a rift basin.Fildani, Andrea, Romans, B.W., Fosdick, J.C., Crane, W.H., and Hubbard, S.M. (2008). Orogenesis of the Patagonian Andes as reflected by basin evolution in southernmost South America, in Spencer, J.E., and Titley, S.R., eds., Ores and orogenesis: Circum-Pacific tectonics, geologic evolution, and ore deposits: Arizona Geological Society Digest 22: 259-268. The Tob\u00edfera Formation is grouped together with other formations of similar age in Patagonia in the Chon Aike Province an extraordinarily large province of silicic volcanism. Except for some western and southern exposures most of the formation is buried and known only from boreholes in the Magallanes and Malvinas Basins. The formation is equivalent to El Quemado and Iba\u00f1ez Formations. Tob\u00edfera Formation has an up to thick Basal Clastic Complex, a sub-unit made up of conglomerate and sandstone. Tob\u00edfera Formation unconformably overlies metamorphic and igneous basement complexes of Cambrian age. == Deformation and metamorphism == Much of the formation is folded and faulted as consequence of the Andean orogeny. At \u00daltima Esperanza Province the formation metamorphosed first under greenschist facies and then under prehnite-pumpellyite facies conditions. Some rhyolites of Tob\u00edfera Formation were incorporated into Cordillera Darwin Metamorphic Complex. The incorporation of part of Tob\u00edfera Formation in the metamorphic complex was accompanied by deformation and metamorphism and occurred in the context of the Andean orogeny in the Cretaceous. == References == Category:Geologic formations of Chile Category:Geologic formations of Argentina Category:Jurassic System of South America Category:Jurassic Argentina Category:Jurassic Chile Category:Jurassic volcanism Category:Tuff formations Formations Category:Geology of Magallanes Region Category:Geology of Santa Cruz Province, Argentina Category:Geology of Patagonia Category:Geology of the Atlantic Ocean ",
