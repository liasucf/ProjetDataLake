    "text": "The Population Genetics Group (or PopGroup, or PGG) is an annual meeting of population geneticists held in the UK since 1968. The meetings have been very influential in promoting population and evolutionary genetics in the UK, Europe, and elsewhere. There have been long-standing connections between the PopGroup meeting and the journal Heredity. In 2017 Heredity published a special issue to mark the 50th meeting of the PopGroup. The two and a half day meetings are held annually just before Christmas or in the new year at UK universities. Attendance is typically in the range of 190-250 participants. The meetings are characterised by a very informal atmosphere alongside scientific rigour. PopGroup is a self-organising meeting, not part of any society or university, and with no formal membership. It is funded principally by participant conference fees, and is not for profit, though it has been additionally supported as a Sectional Interest Group by the Genetics Society. The first meetings were held in January 1968 by a group of established population geneticists as an outgrowth of informal meetings on the evolutionary patterns of the snail Cepaea nemoralis. Programmes of the meetings reflect the changes in population genetics through that time, and are available on the Population Genetics Group website as PDFs. {| class=\"wikitable\" |PopGroup |Date |Location |Organisors |Programme? |- |53 |Jan 2020 |Leicester |Robert Hammond |Yes |- |52 |Jan 2019 |Oxford |Ravinder Kanda |Yes |- |51 |Jan 2018 |Bristol |Jon Bridle |Yes |- |50 |Jan 2017 |Cambridge |Chris Jiggins |Yes |- |49 |Dec 2015 |Edinburgh |Darren Obbard |Yes |- |48 |Jan 2015 |Sheffield |Roger Butlin |Yes |- |47 |Jan 2014 |Bath |Nick Priest |Yes |- |46 |Dec 2012 |Glasgow |Barb Mable |Yes |- |45 |Jan 2012 |Nottingham |Angus Davison et al |Yes |- |44 |Jan 2011 |Hull |Dave Lunt & Lori LHandley |Yes |- |43 |Jan 2010 |Liverpool |Ilik Saccheri |Yes |- |42 |Dec 2008 |Cardiff |Mike Bruford |Yes |- |41 |Dec 2007 |Warwick |Dmitry Filatov |Yes |- |40 |Jan 2007 |Manchester |Cathy Walton |Yes |- |39 |Dec 2005 |Edinburgh |Deborah Charlesworth |Yes |- |38 |Dec 2004 |Reading |Richard Sibley & Mark Beaumont |Yes |- |37 |Dec 2003 |Sussex |Adam Eyre-Walker |Yes |- |36 |Jan 2003 |Leicester |Andre Gilburn |Yes |- |35 |Jan 2002 |Leeds |Roger Butlin |Yes |- |34 |Dec 2001 |Sheffield |Terry Burke |Yes |- |33 |Jan 2000 |Exeter |Mark MacNair |Yes |- |32 |Jan 1999 |Cambridge |Mike & Tamsin Majerus |Yes |- |31 |Dec 1997 |Nottingham |John Brookfield et al |Yes |- |30 |Dec 1996 |Edinburgh |Deborah Charlesworth |Yes |- |29 |Jan 1996 |Bangor |Chris Gliddon |Yes |- |28 |Jan 1995 |Exeter |Mark MacNair |Yes |- |27 |Dec 1993 |Reading |Mark Beaumont |Yes |- |26 |Jan 1993 |Cardiff |Roger Butlin |Yes |- |25 |Dec 1991 |Leiden |Paul Brakefield |Yes |- |24 |Jan 1991 |Manchester |Mani |Yes |- |23 |Dec 1989 |Nottingham |David Parkin & Tom Day |Yes |- |22 |Jan 1989 |Leicester |Gabby Dover |Yes |- |21 |Jan 1988 |UCL |Steve Jones |Yes |- |20 |Dec 1986 |Nottingham |David Parkin & Tom Day |Yes |- |19 |Dec 1985 |Exeter | |Yes |- |18 |Jan 1985 |Manchester | |Yes |- |17 |Jan 1984 |Southampton |John Allen |Yes |- |16 |Jan 1983 |Birmingham |Jeff Gale |Yes |- |15 |Jan 1982 |Cambridge |Nick Barton |Yes |- |14 |Dec 1980 |Edinburgh |Bill Hill |Yes |- |13 |Jan 1980 |Sussex |Brian and Deborah Charlesworth |Yes |- |12 |Dec 1978 |Sheffield |Barry Burnet | |- |11 |Jan 1978 |Leeds |Jackie Stewart? | |- |10 |Dec 1976 |Durham | | |- |09 |Dec 1975 |Manchester | | |- |08 |Dec 1974 |Sussex |John Maynard Smith | |- |07 |Dec 1973 |Swansea |Roger Gilbert | |- |06 |Dec 1972 |Nottingham | | |- |05 |Dec 1971 |Bangor |Richard Arnold? | |- |04 |Dec 1970 |London | |Yes |- |03 |Dec 1969 |Liverpool | | |- |02 |Dec 1968 |Edinburgh | | |- |01 |Jan 1968 |Birmingham | |Yes |- |0 |Jan 1967 |York |Cepea only - PopGroup proposed |Yes |- | -1 |Dec 1962 |Groningen |Beardmore/Cain/Ruiter/Sheppard |Yes |} ==References== ==External links== * Population Genetics Group Category:Genetics in the United Kingdom Category:Population genetics ",
