    "text": "is an archaeological site containing the ruins of an early through mid-J\u014dmon period settlement located in what is now part of the city of Fujinomiya, Shizuoka in the T\u014dkai region of Japan. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1975. ==Overview== The site is located at the southeastern foot of Mount Fuji at an altitude of 398 meters along a ridge extending north-to-south. It was discovered before World War II, but was only excavated from the 1970s. The site was found to contain the foundations of twenty pit dwellings arranged in a ring surrounding a 50-meter diameter central plaza. Each pit dwelling was from three to 7.3 meters in diameter, with some of the foundations overlapping. Numerous J\u014dmon period pottery shards were also recovered from the site. The entire site was covered in a layer of ash from the eruptions of Mount Fuji. Early reports of a large stone circle made from piled river stones were later refuted when the monument was found to be an Edo period structure associated with the Fuji cult. ==See also== *List of Historic Sites of Japan (Shizuoka) ==References== ==External links== *List of Cultural Properties in Fujinomiya City Category:J\u014dmon period Category:History of Shizuoka Prefecture Category:Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Category:Archaeological sites in Japan Category:Historic Sites of Japan ",
