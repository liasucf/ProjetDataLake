She is also the founder and owner of Stratostream Entertainment - World Dance New York, a US entertainment company publishing dance instruction, performance, and fitness home video products for women. As a dance instructor Neon has developed innovative visualisation-based methods for teaching dance and dance fitness in an accelerated-learning format. == Instruction == In the early 2000s, the rising popularity of women's solo dance styles as forms of creative fitness prompted the development of fast-track methods for teaching dance. Among the first dance fitness promoters, Neon based her courses on clear categorization of dance vocabulary, syntax and semantics, and borrowed from the language instruction techniques that stimulate intuitive discovery of patterns in a system of communication (such as in the Rosetta Stone and Berlitz instructional methods). Working with two- and three-dimensional trajectory visualizations and motor imagery she designed sequences of instructional cues and shortcuts that help learners with varying kinesthetic and space visualization abilities find correct movement trajectories without prolonged mechanical repetition. Neon's dance instruction programs and instructional method recommended in Pleasurable Movement Guides section To promote the accelerated-learning dance class format, Neon introduced visualization-based learning tools in her dance instruction video programs, including 3-D graphic overlays on a dance instructor's moving image tracking directions and shapes of movement trajectories. == Publishing work == Neon founded Stratostream Entertainment - World Dance New York in 2003 to produce video dance instruction and fitness products for women with a focus on women's solo dance forms.
