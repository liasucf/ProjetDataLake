This season is also the first to air on FXX since the series was moved from FX. == Production == FX renewed Archer for three more seasons with each season consisting of a total of eight episodes. On January 12, 2017, it was announced that the series would relocate to FX's sister channel FXX, beginning with Season 8 onwards. This season resolves the cliffhanger from last season, which ended with Archer floating lifeless in a swimming pool after being shot several times. It is revealed that Archer survived but has been in a coma for three months, trapped in a 1947 noir-esque Los Angeles setting called Dreamland. It also reveals the fate of Woodhouse (whose original voice actor George Coe died in 2015), the heroin-addicted valet of Archer dying shortly before the season premiere. ==Episodes== ==Critical response== On Rotten Tomatoes the season has an approval rating of 86% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10.
