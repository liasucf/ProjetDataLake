See Guardian obituary. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Born in Gy\u0151r in the west of Hungary, Kennedy spent his early childhood in Debrecen, where his father was manager of the Credit Bank. He attended the Calvinist Gymnasium in Debrecen from September 1941 until the Nazi invasion of Hungary in March 1944.The Debreceni Reform\u00e1tus Koll\u00e9gium. See Chance Survivor, pp. 37\u201347. ===The war years and post-war career=== Following the Nazi invasion, Kennedy was deported not to Auschwitz as intended but to a camp on the outskirts of Vienna, where he was forced to work making anti-aircraft guns for the Third Reich.Kennedy's memoir Chance Survivor gives an account. After the war he returned to his studies, initially at his old school in Debrecen and then briefly in Budapest, attending the Fasori Gimn\u00e1zium.Chance Survivor, pp. 37 and 127. While in Budapest he became an \"avid theatre-goer\", attending as many performances of plays and operas as he could afford, with his passion for the arts soon extending to concert-going and visits to the Museum of Fine Arts.Chance Survivor, pp. 125\u20137. In the autumn of 1947, when still only in his mid-teens, he moved to Ware in Hertfordshire, England, to stay with his uncle. He attended Hertford Grammar School and went on to read English literature and philosophy at the University of Bristol. There he was a regular contributor as theatre and art critic to the university's student newspaper Nonesuch News.Chance Survivor, p. 177. After graduation, he spent a year in the Auvergne teaching English to students at a catering school in Clermont- Ferrand. He came back to England and took up a job in 1956 with the BBC Monitoring Service in London, working on the Hungarian desk. He taught English for at least a school year at Scarborough College in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. At around this time he met Judith Edmundson Hall (1935\u20131992),Norwegian Death Index. whom he wed in 1958. He settled in Cambridge, where he worked as a teacher of English as a second language before taking up an appointment as lecturer in the department of English at Bergen University, Norway in 1966.By publication of his book Six Dramatists in Search of a Language he had become senior lecturer, see title-page. In 1972, he was awarded his doctorate on the languages of drama by the University of Bristol.Chance Survivor, cover blurb. In 1990, he became professor of British literature at Bergen.P\u00e5 H\u00f8yden, University of Bergen's online magazine. He was a Visiting Scholar at the universities of Edinburgh, Washington and Princeton, and in 1979\u201380 a Visiting Fellow at Clare Hall, Cambridge, where he became a Life Member. Kennedy died in Cambridge on 20 December 2016. ==Writings== \"Andrew Kennedy's contribution to the field of literature has been substantial and spans several literary genres to which he has contributed both as a critic and as creative writer.\"Lie & R\u00f8nning, p. 9. Whether writing literary criticism or a short story, Kennedy employed great economy of style, something he admired in Strindberg's Ghost Sonata, for example. The final duologue between the Student and the Young Lady, asserted Kennedy, \"compresses a whole cycle of relationship \u2013 love, marriage and death \u2013 within the cycle of one sustained encounter.\"Kennedy, 1983, p. 211. Both his book Six Dramatists in Search of a Language (in which Kennedy explores the use of language by the playwrights Shaw, Eliot, Beckett, Pinter, Osborne and Arden) and Samuel Beckett were funded by grants from the Norwegian Research Council for Science and the Humanities (Norges Almenvitenskappelige Forskningsr\u00e5d). In a prefatory remark to The Antique Dealer's Women, George Steiner writing about Kennedy's earlier book Double Vision declared that Kennedy's stories \"are vignettes of insightful and humane understanding. They are of a concise maturity all too rare in the current climate of narrative.\"The Antique Dealer's Women, p. iii. Writing about his novella The Antique Dealer's Women, Elaine Feinstein was full of praise: \"The prose is so elegant, so sensuous, so assured. Wonderful writing.\" ==Bibliography== ===Works of criticism=== * Six Dramatists in Search of a Language Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975 (cloth) (paperback) * Dramatic Dialogue: The Duologue of Personal Encounter Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983 * Samuel Beckett Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (British and Irish Authors: Introductory Critical Studies), 1989 (cloth) (paperback) and * Excursions in Fiction: Essays in Honour of Professor Lars Hartveit on his 70th birthday (Andrew Kennedy and Orm \u00d8verland, eds.)
