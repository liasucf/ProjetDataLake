One day, when he is about to paint a fence, the film team of L\u00e5nga n\u00e4san (Long nose), one of Sweden's most popular television programs, including the host Hacke H\u00e4ger (Per Fritzell), suddenly shows up. Egil becomes the victim of a candid-camera prank, which will be aired on television. But, to H\u00e4ger's surprise, Egil does not want to sign the broadcast permit required to broadcast the footage. However, H\u00e4ger, under pressure to make a good television episode, broadcasts the footage anyway, against Egil's wishes. Egil portrays the small crowd of Swedish people who do not want to be on TV and become famous. Sune Fin\u00e5ker (Peter Rangmar), H\u00e4ger's employee, has a near- monopoly on Swedish TV and radio, besides the state-owned channels, owning 12 television channels. Hungry for more power, he plans to buy them soon. All of Sweden has been passivated in the hands of Fin\u00e5ker, with the slogan F\u00f6rstr\u00f6else och l\u00e4tt underh\u00e5llning (Amusement and easy entertainment). He has captivated the Swedish people in front of their TV sets. Through a grand gala evening on his TV channels, he intends to win the election via a majority vote and become prime minister, promising easy entertainment for everybody in the future, then he will finally get their monopoly. Egil, along with Clary Blomstedt (Kerstin Granlund), an intellectual middle-aged teacher, and the incumbent government form a resistance group, trying to get Fin\u00e5ker and his monopoly plans to fail by ending his plans to become prime minister. ==Cast== Galenskaparna och After Shave: * Peter Rangmar - Sune Fin\u00e5ker * Knut Agnred - Egil Ros\u00e9n * Per Fritzell - H\u00e4cke H\u00e4ger * Kerstin Granlund - Clary Blomstedt * Anders Eriksson - Glenn Sivertsson * Jan Rippe - Viggo Florin * Claes Eriksson - Tobakshandlare \u00d6rn / S\u00e5ngare i Arvstwistarna (Tobacco retailer Eagle / Singer in Arvstwistarna) Other actors: * Lisa Alvgrim - Kulturministern (Minister of Culture) * Monica Dominique - Dagmar Fr\u00f6berg * Olof Thunberg - Ernst Fr\u00f6berg * Dan Ekborg - Parkb\u00e4nksmannen (The park bench man) * Mats Bergman - Personalchefen (Chief of Staff) * J\u00f6rgen M\u00f6rnb\u00e4ck - Professor Brio * Jan Nygren - Viking Holm * Olle Sarri - Chefsrekvisit\u00f6ren (Chief Requisitioner) * Stefan Ljungqvist - Gud (God) * Maria Lundqvist - Stj\u00e4rnan (The star) * Christina Stenius - Mamma Palle (Mommy Palle) * Ulf Dohlsten - Pappa Palle (Daddy Palle) * Charlott Strandberg - Programledare f\u00f6r Motsatserna (Program Manager for the Opposites) * Mi Ridell - Bimbonyttuppl\u00e4serskan (Bimbon surface reader) * H\u00e5kan Johannesson - Gordon * Lars \u00c5by Hermansen - Turist (Tourist) (his voice is dubbed by Claes Eriksson) ==External links== * * Kulturtuben - Monopoly Category:Swedish films Category:1996 comedy films Category:Films set in Sweden Category:Films directed by Claes Eriksson Category:Films with screenplays by Claes Eriksson Category:Galenskaparna och After Shave Category:Galenskaparna och After Shave films Category:Swedish comedy films Category:1996 films Category:Swedish- language films ",
