    "text": "Leopoldstadt is a play by Sir Tom Stoppard which had its premiere on 25 January 2020 at Wyndham's Theatre in London. Patrick Marber, who worked with Stoppard on the revival of Travesties in London and New York, is directing and commented that \"It\u2019s a big company play which as a director is incredibly exciting to do. It\u2019s got the lot.\u201d The play is set among the Jewish community of Vienna in the first half of the 20th century and follows the lives of \"a prosperous Jewish family who had fled the pogroms in the East\". According to Stoppard the play \"took a year to write, but the gestation was much longer. Quite a lot of it is personal to me, but I made it about a Viennese family so that it wouldn\u2019t seem to be about me.\u201d Stoppard discovered in the early 1990s that his four grandparents had been Jewish and died in Nazi concentration camps. The second preview performance, on Monday 27 January 2020, was on Holocaust Memorial Day and members of the audience were each given a memorial candle as they left the theatre. The production's set design is by Richard Hudson, costumes by Brigitte Reiffenstuel, lighting by Neil Austin, sound, original music by Adam Cork and movement by EJ Boyle. The 41 actors performing were cast by Amy Ball (adults) and Verity Naughton (children); Leopoldstadt is also the sixth collaboration between Sonia Friedman Productions and Tom Stoppard. The initial cast list was announced on 25 October 2019 and includes Adrian Scarborough, Luke Thallon and Stoppard's son, Ed. During rehearsals Marber \"instituted a fabulous regime of lectures\" given by cast members, allotting each a subject relevant to the play's themes to investigate. ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Leopoldstadt on Twitter Category:Plays by Tom Stoppard Category:Plays set in Vienna Category:2020 plays Category:Plays about The Holocaust Category:Jews and Judaism in fiction ",
