    "text": "First US edition (publ. Pantheon Books, 1979) When Things of the Spirit Come First is Simone de Beauvoir's 'first' work of fiction. After a number of false starts, in 1937 she submitted this collection of interlinked stories to a publisher. But it was turned down by both Gallimard and Grasset. It consists of five short stories which are weaved together in such a way that it to structurally similar to a more traditional novel. The first, \"Marcelle\", tells the story of the oldest of three siblings. She marries an abusive artist. The second, \"Chantal\", tells the story of a lycee philosophy teacher (like de Beauvoir). She idealizes her life and becomes involved in the lives of her students but ultimately refuses to help them. \"Lisa\" is the third and shortest story, about a girl who struggles to live a spiritual life while existing in a physical body. \"Anne\", the fourth story, is the result of many of de Beauvoir's earlier attempts at writing. It parallels the story of her friend Elizabeth Mabille (Zaza) who died soon after her mother refused to allow her to marry Maurice Merleau-Ponty. The final story, \"Marguerite\" expresses the existential views that de Beauvoir herself believed that life itself should be experienced, rather than spirituality.
