It was Michael Ripper's first appearance in a Hammer Film.Jones, D. (2000, Jul 05). Hammer horror film star dies aged 87. Evening Mail Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/323321614 The film was based on the career of criminal Stanley Thurston, who appeared in the cast as a character based on himself. Thurston was famous for his numerous escapes from prison, 5 times in 15 years. He was released from prison in October 1946. The film had trouble with the British censors who thought the film glamorised a real life criminal. Thurston had to be billed as \"Charles Stuart.\"http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/stanley-thurston.htm James Carreras said, \"The picture already has official police approval. I have done everything to show that crime is a mug's game. Thurston is the only non- professional actor in the film. All he asked was \u00a310 a week to cover expenses. At the end of the film he turns to the audience and tells them that a criminal life just isn't worth the candle, especially when guns are brought into crime. He made such a good job of the picture that I had him listed for a racing story on his merits as an actor. That plan will now have to be shelved.\" The film was shot at Marylebone Studios. ==Cast== ==References== ==External links== * *The Dark Road at BFI Category:1948 films Category:British films Category:British drama films Category:English-language films Category:1948 drama films Category:British black-and-white films ",
