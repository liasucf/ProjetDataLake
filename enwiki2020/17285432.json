Following her academic career, Linton published two books, Claiming Disability: Knowledge and Identity [1998] and the memoir My Body Politic, [2006].

The film was based, in part, on Linton\u2019s memoir My Body Politic and her long history of activism. The film premiered at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival in 2014, where it was nominated for a Social Justice Award by the Fund for Santa Barbara. Invitation to Dance has been shown at multiple festivals, and at theaters, colleges and universities around the world. In 2016, Linton and Kevin Gotkin founded Disability/Arts/NYC [DANT], an activist and policy-shaping organization committed to advancing disability artistry across all genres in New York City.

DANT published Disability Equity in NYC\u2019s Arts & Culture Landscape in 2019 to report on the emerging disability arts movement in New York City.
