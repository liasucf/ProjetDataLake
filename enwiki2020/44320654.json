    "text": "The Elite is the second novel in the best-selling Selection series by Kiera Cass. It is narrated by America Singer, a 17-year-old girl who is selected to compete with 34 other girls to become Prince Maxon's wife and become queen. The Elite tells the story at the stage in the competition where there are only six girls left and tensions are high from both the competition and the dangerous rebels. == Plot == The book takes place 300 years in the future in a country called Ill\u00e9a (formerly the United States) that has a strict caste system. The castes range from eight to one, with Eights being the homeless and Ones being the royal family. Prince Maxon has narrowed down his selection candidates to an Elite of six girls: America, Kriss, Celeste, Elise, Natalie, and Marlee. Maxon must find a wife among these girls. In order to do so, Maxon meets their families and throws a Halloween Ball, at America's suggestion. At the ball, Maxon and America dance and he tells her that he will propose to her after the Selection at the right time so that it is easy for her to say yes. America feels sure about marrying Maxon. After the ball, it is discovered that Marlee has been having a secret affair with one of the guards, and as a consequence, is severely caned, a horrible form of whipping. The episode results in her becoming an Eight. Upset and angry that Maxon would let such a thing happen to Marlee, America reconsiders her feelings for Maxon. Then, the girls must plan an event and are split into two teams: America and Kriss, and Natalie, Celeste, and Elise. After much planning, America and Kriss's reception with the Italian Royalty is successful. Celeste shows America an article which shows that she is now the least favorite, and Celeste is the highest. After this, Maxon asks to speak with America. He shows her the Princess's suite as well as her best friend, Marlee. The two girls talk about Marlee's new life, where she cooks in the kitchen and has married Carter Woodwork, the former guard. Maxon and King Clarkson go to New Asia and plan to stay at Elise's parents house. The palace ends up losing connection with the king and Maxon. They return. America is later crushed when she sees Maxon kissing a half-naked Celeste in the hallway. She later angrily confronts him, asking to leave. However, he rejects her request. For their next project, the girls must give a presentation that will be broadcast on The Report. America, after reading secret diaries of Gregory Ill\u00e9a, the first king, presents the idea that the castes should be eliminated. She attempts to answer questions by showing the diary. Immediately, the outraged king shuts down the report, takes the diary from her and demands she returns home. However, Maxon insists she stays, leaving his father infuriated. The Southern Rebels then attack the palace and America runs into Maxon leaving the hospital wing on her way to the gardens. He is acting weird and seems to be in pain. They get locked in a safe room and Maxon is forced to tell America that his father had whipped him after America\u2019s stunt on \u201cThe Report\u201d and she cleans him up. She asks Maxon what the other scars are for and he says they were for things he had said, done, or known. He reveals that it has been happening for a while. They talk about their feelings and Maxon explains his interactions with Celeste and him becoming close to Kriss. They kiss and imply that they love each other. Once America thinks she is going home, she realizes how much Maxon means to her and that she is going to fight for him and his love once he convinces his father to give her one last chance to behave. == Characters == * America Singer - The protagonist and narrator of the novella and a member of the Elite competing for Prince Maxon's hand.
