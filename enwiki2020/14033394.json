    "text": "Endothelin 1 (ET-1), also known as preproendothelin-1 (PPET1), is a potent vasoconstrictor that in humans is encoded by the EDN1 gene and produced by vascular endothelial cells. The protein encoded by this gene is proteolytically processed to release a secreted peptide termed endothelin 1. Endothelin 1 is one of three isoforms of human endothelin. == Source == Preproendothelin is precursor of the peptide ET-1. Endothelial cells convert preproendothelin to proendothelin and subsequently to mature endothelin, which the cells release. == Clinical significance == Long term ET-1 exposure has been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Endothelin-1 receptor antagonists (Bosentan) are used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Inhibition of these receptors prevents pulmonary vasculature constriction and thus decreases pulmonary vascular resistance. == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * == External links == * Category:Endothelin receptor agonists ",
