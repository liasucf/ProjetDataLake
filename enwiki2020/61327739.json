The other side often ends with a fork for poking fruit out of a syrupy dessert. *Bitters: Glycerin or high-proof alcohol mixed with seeds, fruits, leaves, roots, bark and herbs. *Dash: 1/8th teaspoon *Neat: Poured into a glass at room temperature without ice. *Salty rim: A glass with a salty rim is used for cocktails in which it is desired to enhance the drink's taste with saltiness. Examples include the margarita and the salty dog (which without the salty rim is a Greyhound). The rim of the glass is wetted with, e.g., a lime wedge, and then the glass is rubbed against a surface on which salt has been poured, so the salt will stick to it. *Shaken: Aerated and textured. *Straight up: Either neat or up. *Up: Stirred over ice and poured into a martini glass. ==References== Category:Cocktails ",
