Monty has some prior history and friendship with Penelope Garcia, the tech analyst of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit. Much like Garcia, he upholds a positive attitude, though he shows it in a different way. Monty and Garcia are shown to have a joking relationship, when Monty hides Garcia's octopus mug and claims not to have it. In addition to his job as a technical analyst, he liaises with the families of victims on the American homeland while the rest of his group is away.Meet the Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders Team ==References== ==External links== * Russ Montgomery on IMDb Category:Criminal Minds characters Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Fictional Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel Category:Television characters introduced in 2015 Category:Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders Category:American male characters in television ",
