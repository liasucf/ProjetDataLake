The Internationals beat the New York Knights 10-0 in the championship final Saturday evening in Sea Isle City, NJ. The American National Rugby League's showpiece event had a vastly different look about it this year with teams playing abbreviated games as part of a festival-like set up. The New York Knights, Aston Bulls, Philadelphia Fight, Boston 13s and Connecticut Wildcats of the AMNRL were joined by select sides from Washington DC and New England, as well as a Canadian representative team. The DC Internationals were a combination of the Washington DC Slayers and Fairfax Eagles, while the New England Immortals were composed of players from the 13s, Wildcats and New Haven Warriors. The Canadian Mounties represented teams north of the border. Matches in the championship bracket consisted of two 15-minutes halves and games in the elimination bracket were 10-minute halves. In excess of 2000 people were attracted to the event. There were fan activities all day long, plus music, prizes and giveaways to keep spectators entertained. In the championship final, the Internationals scored two tries and kept their own line intact in a decider that was very much a back and forth contest. The Knights opened the match in solid fashion by controlling the ball, but they couldn't crack the opposition's line. After absorbing the early pressure, the Internationals got the opening score when Tom O'Connor (DC Slayers) kicked ahead on the last tackle, regathered the ball and went in for the try. The teams went to the interval with the Internationals leading 4-0. The second frame was much the same with both sides threatening to score, both putting up goal line stands and both being held up over the line. As time was about to expire, Michael Chapman (DC Slayers) sealed the deal with a try for the Internationals. It was converted by Reece Blayney (Fairfax Eagles) and the 'Robert Preston Memorial Rugby League Challenge Cup' was won for the very first time. John Young (Fairfax Eagles) was named War at the Shore MVP. Young scored several tries and had a stellar day. \"It was the Australians who helped us win. They played their brand of rugby from back home,\" Internationals manager Rich Nolte told ARN. \"For the most part, the Americans on the team were in the forwards and they put in some excellent work, especially on defense.\" From New York's standpoint mistakes at inopportune times proved costly. \"All in all it was an exciting game,\" said Knights CEO Rob Ballachandran. \"It was really good for us because we were able to get a lot of our young reserve guys into the mix and with the playoffs starting in a couple of weeks, the team bonding was important.\" In the Rugby League Sevens Exhibition game, the Northern Raiders beat the Chicago Stockyarders select side 18-10. ==Open Round== Week of August 31 * Team Preparations for Playoffs ==Play-Offs== Weeks of August 14, 21, 28 * 8 Teams Seeded according to points earned during regular season.
