She is known for her \"non- conformist approach to producing sounds\" and while her debut album consisted of violin and piano played by Ackroyd, her most recent album, Resolve, incorporated improvisation from Manu Delago, Jo Quail and Mike Lesirge. == Biography == Ackroyd grew up in Bermondsey in London and her father is visual artist Norman Ackroyd. When only seven, she decided that her future career would be as a pianist. Ackroyd was classically trained on violin and piano from an early age. She studied piano and composition at the University of Edinburgh and holds a master's degree in piano performance. She makes music by manipulating and multi-tracking sounds from just these two instruments. Her debut album \u2018Escapement\u2019 was released in December 2012 and a DVD \u2013 \u2018Escapement Visualised\u2019 \u2013 featuring bespoke visuals by Lumen for each track on the album, was released in September 2014.\u2018Feathers\u2019, her second album, followed in November 2014, and builds on the concept behind her debut, with most of the sounds again coming from the violin and the piano, however this time the tracks also feature other keyboard and string instruments. In 2017 she signed to Bjork's label One Little Indian Records and released a mini album \u2018Sketches\u2019 in August. \u2018Sketches\u2019 is an acoustic solo piano album comprising 10 tracks. Six of these are reworkings of tracks from \u2018Escapement\u2019 and \u2018Feathers\u2019, the other four are arrangements of new tracks from latest full album \u2018Resolve\u2019. 'Resolve' features guest instrumentalists for the first time \u2013 Manu Delago on hang, Mike Lesirge on flute and clarinets and Jo Quail on cello.
