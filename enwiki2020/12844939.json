    "text": "The 115th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States of America federal government, composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C. from January 3, 2017, to January 3, 2019, during the final weeks of Barack Obama's presidency and the first two years of Donald Trump's presidency. The seats in the House were apportioned based on the 2010 United States Census. Several political scientists described the legislative accomplishments of this Congress as modest, considering that both Congress and the Presidency were under unified Republican Party control. According to a contemporary study, \"House and Senate GOP majorities struggled to legislate: GOP fissures and an undisciplined, unpopular president frequently undermined the Republican agenda. Most notably, clashes within and between the two parties (for example, on healthcare issues) strained old ways of doing business.\" == Major events == President Donald Trump addressing Congress, with Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan. * January 5, 2017: House of Representatives condemned United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334. * January 6, 2017: Joint session counted and certified the electoral votes of the 2016 presidential election. * January 11\u201312, 2017: Senate, in an all-night session, took first steps to repeal the Affordable Care Act, (ACA). The final vote was 51 to 48 to approve a budget resolution to allow \"broad swaths of the Affordable Care Act to be repealed through a process known as budget reconciliation.\" * January 20, 2017: Inauguration of President Donald Trump. * February 7, 2017: Vice President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaking vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. This was the first time in United States history that a cabinet confirmation was tied in the Senate and required a tie-breaking vote. * February 28, 2017: President's speech to a Joint Session. * April 6, 2017: Senate invoked the \"nuclear option\" to weaken Supreme Court filibusters. Nominee Neil Gorsuch was then confirmed the next day. * June 14, 2017: Majority Whip Steve Scalise and several staffers were shot during the 2017 Congressional baseball shooting. They were practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game. * September 1, 2017: The Parliamentarian of the United States Senate decreed that the Senate had until the end of the month to pass ACA repeal via the reconciliation process, or the option would no longer be viable. * October 24 \u2013 December 14, 2017: 2017 United States political sexual scandals from the \"Me too\" movement: ** Allegations that Democrat Congressman Ruben Kihuen sexually harassed a campaign staffer led some in congressional leadership to call for his resignation. Kihuen later announced he would not seek another term in office. ** Democrat Senator Al Franken announced he would resign \"in the coming weeks\" after photographs were made public suggesting that he sexually assaulted (groped) a Los Angeles-based radio personality during a USO tour in Iraq in 2006. He was also accused by multiple female constituents of groping at various Minnesota fair appearances that he attended. ** Three members of Congress either resigned or announced their impending resignations. (See \"Changes in membership\") ** Allegations that President Donald Trump previously raped and sexually harassed at least nineteen women, one girl, and Miss Teen USA contestants resulted in calls by members of Congress for him to resign. ** Allegations that Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore previously raped and sexually harassed at least eight women and one girl contributed to his defeat by Democrat Doug Jones in a special Senate election to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions. ** Allegations that Republican Representative Blake Farenthold sexually harassed a former staffer resulted in the commencement of an investigation by the House Ethics Committee and his announcement he would not seek re-election in 2018.
