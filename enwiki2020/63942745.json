He was the son of Hiship-rashini. Lu-ishan is known from Elamite sources, such as the Awan Dynasty king list, where he is listed as the 8th king of the Awan Dynasty. Lu-ishan also appears in the inscriptions of Sargon of Akkad, who vanquished him when he conquered Elam and Marashi. Sargon claims in his inscriptions that he is \"Sargon, king of the world, conqueror of Elam and Parahshum\", the two major polities to the east of Sumer. He also names various rulers of the east whom he vanquished, such as \"Luh-uh-ish-an, son of Hishibrasini, king of Elam\", thought to be Lu-sihan, or \" Sidga'u, general of Parahshum\", who later also appears in an inscription by Rimush. ==References== Category:Elamite people Category:Elamite kings Category:23rd- century BC rulers Category:Awan Dynasty ",
