    "text": "Fresnoy Redoubt (), also known as Kalafrana Redoubt (), was a tour-reduit in Bir\u017cebbu\u0121a, Malta. It was built by the Order of Saint John in 1715\u20131716 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. It was demolished in 1897. ==History== Fresnoy Redoubt was built in 1715\u20131716 as part of a chain of fortifications that defended Marsaxlokk Bay, which also included three other redoubts, the large Saint Lucian Tower, two smaller De Redin towers, seven batteries and three entrenchments. The nearest fortifications to Fresnoy Redoubt were Elminiech Battery to the west and Balbani Battery to the east. Fresnoy Redoubt was one of four tour-reduits built in Malta, with the other three being Spinola Redoubt, Vend\u00f4me Tower and Marsalforn Tower. It had a semi-circular front, and a redan on the landward side, all of which were pierced by musketry loopholes. The redoubt was demolished by an order given by the Public Works Department on 22 February 1897. Its site is now occupied by part of the Malta Freeport. Other sources say it is occupied by Villa Pisana.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/54205/1/Batterji%20u%20Ridotti%20%282%29.pdf ==References== Category:Redoubts in Malta Category:Fortified towers in Malta Category:Castles and fortifications of the Knights Hospitaller Category:Military installations established in 1715 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1897 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Malta Category:Bir\u017cebbu\u0121a Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:18th- century fortifications Category:1715 establishments in Malta Category:1897 disestablishments in Malta ",
