    "text": "is a Japanese professional sumo wrestler from Setouchi, Kagoshima. He debuted in sumo wrestling in July 2011 and made his makuuchi debut in July 2018. His highest rank has been maegashira 2. He wrestles for Tatsunami stable. Unusually for a top-class sumo wrestler, he uses his given name as his shikona. ==Background== Meisei was born in Setouchi, a town on Amami \u014cshima, one of the Ryukyu Islands. He began sumo at the age of five and was strongly encouraged by his father and other family members. When his elementary school closed their sumo programme he joined a sumo club in a neighboring town and in sixth grade he won the All-Japan Primary School Sumo Tournament. He moved to the Kamogawa Junior High School and competed in national championships but failed to win any further championships. Although he considered attending High School he took his father's advice and left education at the age of 15 to pursue a career in professional sumo.\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30de\u30ac\u30b8\u30f3\u793e\u520a \u300e\u76f8\u64b2\u300f 2016\u5e748\u6708\u53f7\uff08\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5834\u6240\u7dcf\u6c7a\u7b97\u53f7\uff09 83\u9801\u5e73\u621019\u5e74\u306e\u8a66\u5408\u8a18\u9332\u30fb\u7d50\u679c \u516c\u76ca\u8ca1\u56e3\u6cd5\u4eba \u65e5\u672c\u76f8\u64b2\u9023\u76df\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30de\u30ac\u30b8\u30f3\u793e\u520a \u300e\u76f8\u64b2\u300f 2014\u5e748\u6708\u53f7\uff08\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5834\u6240\u7dcf\u6c7a\u7b97\u53f7\uff09 91\u9801 ==Career== ===Early career=== In 2011 Meisei joined the Tatsunami stable, bringing him under the tutelage of the former komusubi Asahiyutaka. Unlike most new wrestlers who begin their careers under their family names he took his given name as his shikona surname. Shortly before his sixteenth birthday he began his professional career in July 2011 and recorded four wins in seven bouts in the jonokuchi division to secure promotion to jonidan. A 5-2 result in November saw him promoted to the fourth sandanme division but in January 2012 he won only two matches and returned to jonidan after posting his first make-koshi (losing record). He returned to sandanme after a 6-1 record in March 2012 and a run of kachi-koshi (winning records) saw him promoted to makushita (third division) in January 2013. After moving up and down between sandanme and makushita several times he established himself in the higher division and began a steady climb through the ranks. In September 2016 a 4-3 result at the rank of makushita 3 saw him promoted to the second juryo division for the first time. He returned to makushita after recording a 5-10 record in November but was promoted back to juryo after two consecutive kachi- koshi. A series of solid results saw him rise to the top of the second division and in May 2018 a 10-5 record at juryo saw him promoted to the makuuchi division. ===Makuuchi career=== In his first tournament in the top division Meisei was assigned the rank of maegashira 16. His kesho-mawashi, which featured the sun rising from the sea was embroidered by Miyuki Tanaka whose previous clients had included Chiyonofuji. He recorded six wins including victories over Hokutofuji and Chiyomaru but was relegated back to juryo. Nine wins at juryo 2 saw him return to the top division in November 2018 when he posted a 9-6 record including wins over Chiyomaru and Onosho. In January he reached a score of 6-7 after 13 days but reached his kachi-koshi by beating Yoshikaze and Onosho in his last two bouts. Competing a career high of maegashira 11 in March 2019 he won nine of his fourteen bouts highlighted by an uwatedashinage win over the former \u014dzeki Kotoshogiku on day 13. In the following tournament, at another career high rank of maegashira 7 he lost his first three bouts but won ten of his remaining twelve matches including a victory over Tochinoshin. He reached his highest ranking to date of maegashira 2 in November 2019. On December 28 during training at his stable he injured his left upper arm muscle. He still entered the January 2020 tournament but withdrew on Day 8 with only one win. He failed to make kachi-kochi in March 2020 at the rank of maegashira 17, and secured his demotion to Juryo. In July 2020, he won the Juryo Championship following six-man playoff, ensuring his return to Makuuchi. ==Fighting style== Meisei has shown a preference for yotsu techniques which involve grasping his opponent's mawashi or belt and favors the hidari-yotsu, or left-hand inside grip. His most common kimarite or winning move is yorikiri, the force-out. ==Career record== ==See also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of active sumo wrestlers ==References== Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Kagoshima Prefecture ",
