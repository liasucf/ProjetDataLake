    "text": "\"Ne brini\" (\"Don't worry\") was the Bosnian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, performed in Bosnian and English by Mija Martina. The song was performed sixth on the night, following Malta's Lynn with \"To Dream Again\" and preceding Portugal's Rita Guerra with \"Deixa-me sonhar\". At the close of voting, it had received 27 points, placing 16th in a field of 26. Mija managed to earn Turkey's maximum, 12 points accumulated into her final score. The song is sung from the perspective of a woman whose lover has just broken up with her. She reacts to his claims that he never loved her in the first place with derision and tells him not to worry about her. The song was recorded and released on the official 2003 Eurovision Song Contest album as 'Could It Be', sung in English. It was succeeded as Bosnian and Herzegovinian representative at the 2004 contest by Deen with \"In The Disco\".
