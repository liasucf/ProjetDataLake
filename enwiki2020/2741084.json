    "text": "The Hers-Vif (\"Live Hers\", as opposed to the slower flowing Hers-Mort, \"Dead Hers\"), also named Grand Hers or simply Hers, is a long river in southern France, right tributary of the Ari\u00e8ge. The Hers-Vif rises at an elevation of about near the Chioula Pass of the Pyrenees, approximately north of Ax-les- Thermes. It is the major tributary of the Ari\u00e8ge into whose right bank it flows upstream from Cintegabelle in the Haute-Garonne. It flows some through the Pyrenees, descending to the village of Peyrat, where it reaches a piedmont plain. Its valley widens as it traverses the plain, reaching the medieval city of Mirepoix, which marks the start of its lower valley. Several rivers flow into it: *From the Pyrenees: the Lasset; the Fontaine de Fontestorbes; the Touyre *From the piedmont plain and hills: the Blau and the Douctouyre; *From the hills of Lauragais and Raz\u00e8s: the Ambronne and the Vixi\u00e8ge. Departments and towns along its course are: *Ari\u00e8ge: Prades, B\u00e9lesta, La Bastide- sur-l'Hers, Mirepoix, Maz\u00e8res *Aude: Comus, Chalabre *Haute-Garonne: Calmont ==Floods== The Hers is probably known as vif (intense or rapid in this context) because of its sometimes spectacular floods \u2013 that of 16 June 1289 having entirely destroyed Mirepoix. More recently, there have been: * 23 June 1875: estimated flow rate of at Maz\u00e8res; * 6 February 1919: estimated flow rate of at Maz\u00e8res; * 19 May 1977: estimated flow rate of at Maz\u00e8res; * 16 January 1981: estimated flow rate of at Maz\u00e8res; * 11 June 2000: estimated flow rate of at Maz\u00e8res; * 24 January 2004: estimated flow rate of at Maz\u00e8res. ==References== ==External links== *http://www.geoportail.fr Category:Rivers of France Category:Rivers of Ari\u00e8ge (department) Category:Rivers of Aude Category:Rivers of Haute-Garonne Category:Rivers of Occitanie ",
