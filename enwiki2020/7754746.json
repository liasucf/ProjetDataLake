Notable Webb designs include the iconic Windsor Hotel, Royal Arcade, South Melbourne Town Hall and Tasma Terrace, all listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. ==Biography== Charles Webb was born in Sudbury, Suffolk, England on 26 November 1821, as the youngest of nine children. After being apprentice at an architect in London, in 1847 he became the secretary of the London Architectural Students' Society. Following his brother James who earlier migrated to Australia, Charles arrived in Melbourne on 2 June 1849. He set up an architecture and surveyor partnership with his brother at Brighton. Their first important commission was for the St Paul's Church on Swanston Street in 1850. After 1858 Webb practised on his own, until two of his sons joined him in 1888. In this period he designed several public buildings, including the Wesley College (1864), Alfred Hospital (1869), Royal Arcade (1869), South Melbourne Town Hall (1878), Melbourne Orphan Asylum (1878) and the Grand Hotel later renamed Hotel Windsor (1884). In 1856 he was a founding member of the Victorian Institute of Architects, and between 1882-83 the organisation's president.Bridges-Webb, Charles, \"Webb, Charles (1821\u20131898)\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 3 November 2012. ==Significant works== * 1856 - Melbourne Grammar School (main buildings), Melbourne * 1857 - St Andrew's Anglican Church, Brighton, Melbourne * 1863 - Church of Christ, Swanston Street, Melbourne * 1864 - Wesley College, Prahran, Melbourne * 1869 - Royal Arcade, Bourke Street, Melbourne * 1872 - The Beehive Building, Pall Mall, Bendigo, Victoria * 1875 - Congregational Church, Black St., Brighton, Melbourne * 1876 - Mandeville Hall, Toorak, Melbourne * 1876 - John Knox Presbyterian Church, Gardenvale, Melbourne * 1878 - Tasma Terrace, Parliament Place, East Melbourne, Victoria * 1879 - South Melbourne Town Hall, South Melbourne, Victoria * 1880 - Primary School No. 1253, South Melbourne * 1882 - Mosspennoch, East Melbourne * 1883 - Grand Hotel (Windsor), Spring Street, Melbourne * 1884 - Banks & Co Warehouse, 96 Pelham Street, Carlton, Melbourne * 1889 - Charsfield Hotel, St Kilda Road, Melbourne ==Gallery of works== File:MGS Witherby Tower.jpg|Melbourne Grammar School, Witherby Tower, South Facade File:Church of christ swanston street.jpg|Church of Christ, Swanston St, Melbourne File:Bourke street mall facade of royal arcade melbourne.jpg|Royal Arcade File:John Knox Church in Brighton.jpg|John Knox Church (built 1876) on the corner of New Street and North Road, Brighton, Victoria File:Tasma terrace parliament place.jpg|Tasma Terrace File:South Melbourne Townhall.jpg|South Melbourne Town Hall File:Windsor hotel in 2010.jpg|Melbourne Windsor Hotel (Built 1887) File:New and old buildings in Carlton.jpg|Banks & Co Warehouse (right) File:A Boutique Hotel (Charsfield Hotel) in St Kilda Rd.jpg|Charsfield Hotel, St Kilda Road File:Beehive Building on Pall Mall, Bendigo, Victoria, Australia.jpg|Beehive Building, Bendigo, Victoria ==References== ==External links== Category:1821 births Category:1898 deaths Category:People from Sudbury, Suffolk Category:19th- century Australian architects ",
