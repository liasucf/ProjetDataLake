    "text": "The Weldon Gin Company Historic District encompasses a historic cotton gin complex in Weldon, Arkansas. With a history dating to 1833, the Weldon Gin Company was long a staple of the local economy. Located in the center of the town at the junction of Weldon and Washington Streets, the company complex includes a main gin building, built in 1939, and four outbuildings. The present mill was built to replace an earlier steam-powered mill after electricity was introduced to the area in the 1930s. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.
