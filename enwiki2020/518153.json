    "text": "Lalibela () is a town in Lasta Amhara Region, Ethiopia famous for its rock-cut monolithic churches. The whole of Lalibela is a large antiquity of the medieval and post-medieval civilization of Ethiopia. To Christians, Lalibela is one of Ethiopia's holiest cities, second only to Axum, and a center of pilgrimage. Unlike Axum, the population of Lalibela is almost completely Ethiopian Orthodox Christian. Ethiopia was one of the earliest nations to adopt Christianity in the first half of the 4th century, and its historical roots date to the time of the Apostles. The churches themselves date from the 7th to 13th centuries, and are traditionally dated to the reign of the Zagwe king Gebre Mesqel Lalibela (r. ca. 1181\u20131221). The layout and names of the major buildings in Lalibela are widely accepted, especially by local clergy, to be a symbolic representation of Jerusalem. This has led some experts to date the current church forms to the years following the capture of Jerusalem in 1187 by the Muslim leader Saladin. Lalibela is located in the North Wollo Zone of the Amhara Region, at roughly above sea level. It is the main town in Lasta woreda, which was formerly part of Bugna woreda. The Rock-Hewn Churches were declared a World Heritage site in 1978. ==History== During the reign of Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, a member of the Zagwe dynasty who ruled Ethiopia in the late 12th century and early 13th century, the current town of Lalibela was known as Roha. The saint-king was named because a swarm of bees is said to have surrounded him at his birth, which his mother took as a sign of his future reign as emperor of Ethiopia. The names of several places in the modern town and the general layout of the rock-cut churches themselves are said to mimic names and patterns observed by Lalibela during the time he spent as a youth in Jerusalem and the Holy Land. Lalibela, revered as a saint, is said to have seen Jerusalem, and then attempted to build a new Jerusalem as his capital in response to the capture of old Jerusalem by Muslims in 1187. Each church was carved from a single piece of rock to symbolize spirituality and humility. Christian faith inspires many features with Biblical names \u2013 even Lalibela's river is known as the River Jordan. Lalibela remained the capital of Ethiopia from the late 12th into the 13th century. The first European to see these churches was the Portuguese explorer P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3 (1460\u20131526). Portuguese priest Francisco \u00c1lvares (1465\u20131540), accompanied the Portuguese Ambassador on his visit to Dawit II in the 1520s. He describes the unique church structures as follows: \"I weary of writing more about these buildings, because it seems to me that I shall not be believed if I write more... I swear by God, in Whose power I am, that all I have written is the truth[.]\"Francisco Alvarez, The Prester John of the Indies, translated by Charles Fraser Beckingham and George Wynn Brereton Huntingford (Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, 1961), p. 226. Beckingham and Huntingford added an appendix that discusses Alvarez's description of these churches, pp. 526\u201342. Ethiopian Orthodox priests holding a procession in Lalibela Although Ramuso included plans of several of these churches in his 1550 printing of \u00c1lvares' book, who supplied the drawings remains a mystery. The next reported European visitor to Lalibela was Miguel de Castanhoso, who served as a soldier under Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o da Gama and left Ethiopia in 1544.De Castanhoso's account is translated in R.S. Whiteway, The Portuguese Expedition to Ethiopia (London: The Hakluyt Society, 1902), pp. 94\u201398. After de Castanhoso, more than 300 years passed until the next European, Gerhard Rohlfs, visited Lalibela some time between 1865 and 1870. According to the Futuh al-Haba\u0161a of Sihab ad-Din Ahmad, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al- Ghazi burned one of the churches of Lalibela during his invasion of Ethiopia.Sihab ad-Din Ahmad bin 'Abd al-Qader, Futuh al-Habasa: The conquest of Ethiopia, translated by Paul Lester Stenhouse with annotations by Richard Pankhurst (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003), pp. 346f. However, Richard Pankhurst has expressed his skepticism about this event, pointing out that although Sihab ad-Din Ahmad provides a detailed description of a rock-hewn church (\"It was carved out of the mountain. Its pillars were likewise cut from the mountain.\"), only one church is mentioned; Pankhurst adds that \"what is special about Lalibela, (as every tourist knows), is that it is the site of eleven or so rock churches, not just one \u2013 and they are all within more or less a stone's throw of each other!\"Pankhurst, \"Did the Imam Reach Lalibela?\" Addis Tribune, 21 November 2003 Pankhurst also notes that the Royal Chronicles, which mention Ahmad al-Ghazi's laying waste to the district between July and September 1531, are silent about the him ravaging the fabled churches of this city.Sihab ad-Din Ahmad, Futuh al-Haba\u0161a, p. 346n. 785. He concludes by stating that had Ahmad al-Ghazi burned a church at Lalibela, it was most likely Biete Medhane Alem; and if the Muslim army was either mistaken or misled by the locals, then the church he set fire to was Gannata Maryam, \"10 miles [16 km] east of Lalibela which likewise has a colonnade of pillars cut from the mountain.\"Sihab ad-Din Ahmad, Futuh al-Haba\u0161a, p. 346n. 786. ==Churches== Lalibela area map This rural town is known around the world for its churches carved from within the earth from \"living rock,\" which play an important part in the history of rock-cut architecture. Though the dating of the churches is not well established, most are thought to have been built during the reign of Lalibela, namely during the 12th and 13th centuries. Unesco identifies 11 churches, assembled in four groups: The Northern Group: *Biete Medhane Alem (House of the Saviour of the World), home to the Lalibela Cross. (Here is the 3D model of Biete Medhane Alem) *Biete Maryam (House of Miriam/House of Mary), possibly the oldest of the churches, and a replica of the Tombs of Adam and Christ. (Here is the 3D model of Biete Mariam) *Biete Golgotha Mikael (House of Golgotha Mikael), known for its arts and said to contain the tomb of King Lalibela) *Biete Meskel (House of the Cross) *Biete Denagel (House of Virgins) The Western Group: *Church of Saint George, thought to be the most finely executed and best preserved church (Here the 3D Model of Saint George) The Eastern Group: *Biete Amanuel (House of Immanuel), possibly the former royal chapel. (Here the 3D model of Biete Amanuel) *Biete Qeddus Mercoreus (House of Saint Mercurius/House of Mark the Evangelist), which may be a former prison *Biete Abba Libanos (House of Abbot Libanos) (Here the 3D model of Biete Abba Libanos) *Biete Gabriel-Rufael (House of the angels Gabriel, and Raphael) possibly a former royal palace, linked to a holy bakery. *Biete Lehem (\"Bethlehem\", \"House of Bread\"). Farther afield, lie the monastery of Ashetan Maryam and Yemrehana Krestos Church (possibly eleventh century, built in the Aksumite fashion, but within a cave). There is some controversy as to when some of the churches were constructed. David Buxton established the generally accepted chronology, noting that \"two of them follow, with great fidelity of detail, the tradition represented by Debra Damo as modified at Yemrahana Kristos.\"David Buxton, The Abyssinians (New York: Praeger, 1970), p. 110 Since the time spent to carve these structures from the living rock must have taken longer than the few decades of King Lalibela's reign, Buxton assumes that the work extended into the 14th century.Buxton, The Abyssinians, p. 108 However, David Phillipson, professor of African archeology at University of Cambridge, has proposed that the churches of Merkorios, Gabriel-Rufael, and Danagel were initially carved out of the rock half a millennium earlier, as fortifications or other palace structures in the waning days of the Kingdom of Aksum, and that Lalibela's name simply came to be associated with them after his death.\"Medieval Houses of God, or Ancient Fortresses?\" Archaeology (November/December, 2004), p. 10. On the other hand, local historian Getachew Mekonnen credits Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, Lalibela's queen, with having one of the rock-hewn churches, Biete Abba Libanos, built as a memorial for her husband after his death.Getachew Mekonnen Hasen, Wollo, Yager Dibab (Addis Ababa: Nigd Matemiya Bet, 1992), p. 24. Contrary to claims made by pseudoarchaeologist writers like Graham Hancock, Buxton states the great rock-hewn churches of Lalibela were not built with the help of the Knights Templar; asserting abundant evidence exists to show that they were produced solely by medieval Ethiopian civilization. For example, while Buxton notes the existence of a tradition that \"Abyssinians invoked the aid of foreigners\" to construct these monolithic churches, and admits that \"there are clearly signs of Coptic influence in some decorative details\" (hardly surprising given the theological, ecclesiastical, and cultural links between the Orthodox Tewahedo and Coptic Orthodox Churches), he is adamant about the native origins of these creations: \"But the significant fact remains that the rock-churches continue to follow the style of the local built-up prototypes, which themselves retain clear evidence of their basically Axumite origin.\"Buxton, The Abysssinians, pp. 103f The churches are also a significant engineering feat, given that they are all associated with water (which fills the wells next to many of the churches), exploiting an artesian geological system that brings the water up to the top of the mountain ridge on which the city rests. ==Vernacular architecture== In a 1970 report of the historic dwellings of Lalibela, Sandro Angelini evaluated the vernacular earthen architecture on the Lalibela World Heritage Site, including the characteristics of the traditional earth houses and analysis of their state of conservation. His report described two types of vernacular housing found in the area. One type are a group he calls the \"tukuls\", round huts built of stone and usually having two stories. The second are the single-storey \"chika\" buildings which are round and built of earth and wattle, which he feels reflects more \"scarcity\". Angel's report also included an inventory of Lalibela's traditional buildings, placing them in categories rating their state of conservation.
