    "text": "The Lilies of the Valley egg is a jewelled Faberg\u00e9 egg made under the supervision of the Russian jeweller Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9 in 1898 by Faberg\u00e9 ateliers. The supervising goldsmith was Michael Perchin. The egg is one of the two eggs in the Art Nouveau style (the other is the Pansy Egg). It was presented on April 5 to Tsar Nicholas II, who gave it as a gift to his wife, the Tsarina, Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna. The egg is part of the Victor Vekselberg Collection, owned by The Link of Times Foundation and housed in the Faberg\u00e9 Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. ==Description== The egg is covered in pearls and topped with rose pink enamel on a guilloch\u00e9 field. The egg is supported by cabriole legs of green-gold leaves with rose-cut diamond dewdrops. The gold-stemmed lilies have green enameled leaves and flowers made of gold set with rubies, pearls, and diamonds. ==Surprise== This egg's surprise is 'elevated' out of the egg by twisting a gold-mounted pearl button. When fully raised, three portraits are visible under the Imperial crown set with a ruby: Tsar Nicholas II and his two oldest daughters, Grand Duchess Olga and Grand Duchess Tatiana, painted on ivory by Johannes Zehngraf. The portraits are framed in rose diamonds and backed with gold panels engraved with the presentation date of July 31, 1898. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * ==External links== *Faberge - Treasures of Imperial Russia Category:Imperial Faberg\u00e9 eggs Category:Art Nouveau works Category:1898 works Category:Faberg\u00e9 Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia ",
