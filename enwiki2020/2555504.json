    "text": "Eadberht I was king of Kent from 725 to 748. After his father Wihtred of Kent died, he inherited the kingdom of Kent along with his two brothers \u00c6\u00f0elberht II and Alric. \u00c6\u00f0elberht II seems to have been the eldest and dominant brother. Eadberht I died in 748, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. He left a son, Eardwulf, who succeeded as king jointly with his uncle. His one complete surviving charter apparently dates from 14 October 727. Another charter is an altered copy of one issued by \u00c6\u00f0elberht II. Other charters attributed to Eadberht I are copies of charters of Eadberht II with \u201cdeliberate chronological falsification\u201d. ==References== ==See also== *List of monarchs of Kent ==External links== * Category:748 deaths Category:Kentish monarchs Category:8th-century English monarchs Category:Year of birth unknown ",
