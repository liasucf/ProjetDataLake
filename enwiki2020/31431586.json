    "text": "The Lost World of the Crystal Skull is a human interest docudrama by director Gabriel Murray and producer Yvette Hoyle about a crystal skull discovered by F. A. Mitchell-Hedges. The Mitchell Hedges Crystal Skull was discovered by Albert Mitchell Hedges in a lost city in Belize in 1924, it is the artifact which inspired the movie Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The English explorer found the skull while in search of the lost continent of Atlantis. This documentary explores this lost world where the skull was linked to Atlantis, the Mayan Prophecies of 2012 and a lost white tribe of Thule. In recent years new evidence has emerged which may support Mitchell Hedges theory that the edge of Atlantis was indeed off the coast of Cuba and Belize. This is as a result of the uncovering of a vast complex of pyramids found beneath Cuban waters and the discovery of the lost White City in the Jungles of Honduras. Japanese and European space agencies have recently pinpointed their locations, again seeming to support Mitchell Hedges discoveries and theories. The documentary premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France. ==Plot== The Lost World of the Crystal Skull traces the story of the expedition to discover Atlantis and the subsequent accidental discovery of the crystal skull. Told from the explorer's perspective, and supported by dramatic recreations, the film highlights the human drama and cultural diversity encountered on the expedition as the explorers search for the Lost City of Atlantis. The film chronicles the experiences of the explorer and individual expedition members as they plan and execute the expedition. They are united by a zeal for exploration, which builds over a 10-week period. It culminates in an outing where the crystal skull is accidentally discovered by Mitchell- Hedges' adopted daughter Anna. The film celebrates the intricate lives of these explorers and reminds audiences of their own spirit of adventure. Living with the complexities of navigating unknown lands, encountering mysterious legends, ancient cultures and strange artifacts, these explorers take on something unfamiliar and rise to the occasion. Filled with emotion and triumph, this documentary feature captures the essence of exploring undiscovered mysterious locations in the early part of the 20th century. ==Cast== Cast (in alphabetical order) * Coco Hoyle-Ansett ...
