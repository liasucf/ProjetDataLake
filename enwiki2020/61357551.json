    "text": "Daniel Jay Cameron (born November 22, 1985) is an American politician and attorney serving as the 51st Attorney General of Kentucky. Cameron is the first Republican elected to the office since 1944 and the first African- American attorney general of Kentucky. ==Early life and education== Cameron was born and raised in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. His mother was a professor at Elizabethtown Community and Technical College and his father owned a local coffee shop. Cameron attended John Hardin High School in Elizabethtown and won a prize scholarship named in honor of Senator Mitch McConnell to attend the University of Louisville. At Louisville, Cameron played on the Louisville Cardinals football team in 2005 and 2006. A defensive back, Cameron came off the bench for the first two games of the 2006 season, during which Louisville won the 2007 Orange Bowl. He graduated from the University of Louisville with a Bachelor of Science in 2008, and then graduated in 2011 with a Juris Doctor from the university's Brandeis School of Law where he was president of the Student Bar Association. == Career== ===Early career=== Cameron was a law clerk to U.S. District Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky for two years. After the clerkship with Judge Tatenhove, Cameron served as legal counsel to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell from 2015 to 2017. As McConnell's counsel Cameron successfully spearheaded the confirmation processes for conservative federal judges, including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/politics/daniel-cameron-kentucky-attorney- general-breonna-taylor/index.html In 2017, Cameron moved back to Louisville and joined the law firm Frost Brown Todd as a senior associate. ===2019 election as Kentucky Attorney General=== Cameron declared that he was running for Attorney General of Kentucky on January 21, 2019. He defeated State Senator Wil Schroder in the Republican primary by a margin of 132,400 (55.3%) votes to 106,950 (44.7%) votes. After the primary, Cameron was endorsed by President Donald Trump. In the November 2019 general election, Cameron defeated the Democratic nominee, former Attorney General Greg Stumbo, with 57.8% of the vote. He is the first Republican elected to be attorney general of Kentucky since Eldon S. Dummit, who served from 1944 to 1948. He is also the state's first African-American attorney general. Following Republican Lieutenant Governor Jenean Hampton, Cameron became Kentucky's second African- American statewide officer, and the first to be independently elected (given that Hampton had shared the 2015 gubernatorial ticket with Matt Bevin). ===Tenure as Kentucky Attorney General=== Cameron's term as attorney general was scheduled to begin on January 6, 2020, but on December 17, 2019, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed an executive order appointing Cameron to the office, filling the vacancy created when Beshear resigned after winning election to the governorship. Immediately after the order was signed, Cameron was officially sworn in. ==== Proposed abortion halt ==== On March 27, 2020, Cameron called for halting abortions in Kentucky during the coronavirus pandemic, arguing it was an elective medical procedure that should fall under the statewide ban for the duration of the pandemic. During the closing days of the legislative session, the Kentucky legislature gave the attorney general power to regulate abortion clinics, but the legislation was vetoed by Andy Beshear, the state's Democratic governor.Bruce Schreiner, Kentucky's Democratic governor vetoes abortion legislation, Associated Press (April 24, 2020). ====Lawsuit challenging public health measures to combat COVID-19 ==== Cameron initiated legal challenges to executive actions that Governor Beshear took to combat the spread of COVID-19.Bruce Schreiner, Kentucky AG in spotlight over Breonna Taylor probe, Associated Press (August 24, 2020).Bruce Schreiner & Dylan Lovan, Kentucky AG takes more aggressive stand against virus orders, Associated Press (April 28, 2020). In a court filing in July 2020, Cameron asked a state judge to invalidate all of Beshear's COVID-19 orders and to bar the governor from issuing or enforcing any further COVID-19 order.\"Jack Brammer, Attorney General asks state judge to block all of Beshear's COVID-19 orders, Lexington Herald Leader (July 16, 2020).Joe Sonka, 'People would die': Andy Beshear blasts Daniel Cameron's effort to block COVID-19 orders, Louisville Courier Journal (July 16, 2020). Cameron described his request as an attempt \"to protect the rights of Kentuckians\"; Beshear condemned Cameron's motion as \"scary and reckless\" and said it would endanger public health, lead to more deaths, and harm the economy. The governor noted that Cameron's filing called for the invalidation of executive action that required face masks in public places, imposed restrictions on public gatherings, expanded workers' compensation eligibility for workers under quarantine due to exposure to the virus, and the waiver of copays, deductibles, and other costs associated with COVID-19-related healthcare. The litigation is pending in the Kentucky Supreme Court, which heard argument in September 2020.Bruce Schreiner, Kentucky court hears case challenging coronavirus orders, Associated Press (September 17, 2020).

On July 14, 2020, over 100 protestors organized by the social justice organization Until Freedom marched to Cameron's house and occupied his lawn to demand charges be brought to the officers involved in the killing. Police officers arrested 87 protestors and charged them with several crimes including Intimidating a Participant in the Legal Process, a Class D felony. Cameron accused the protestors of trespassing on private property and claimed the protest's purpose was to \"escalate\" tension and division in the community. On September 23, 2020, Cameron announced that the grand jury indicted officer Brett Hankison with three counts of wanton endangerment with regards to the family living next door. Officers Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove were not charged with any crimes and Cameron said that their firing into Taylor's apartment was a justified use of force.Darcy Costello, Key takeaways from AG Daniel Cameron's investigation on the Breonna Taylor case, Louisville Courier Journal (September 23, 2020). Interim Police Chief Robert Schroeder had previously moved to fire Hankinson, stating that he had indiscriminately fired into Taylor's apartment and adjoining units.https://www.courier- journal.com/story/news/local/breonna-taylor/2020/09/23/what-we-know-about- officer-brett-hankison-indicted-in-breonna-taylor-shooting/5490411002/ Former Detective Brett Hankison faces 3 charges after Breonna Taylor shooting - Darcy Costello and Tessa Duvall - Louisville Courier Journal - Sept. 23, 2020 At the news conference in Frankfort, announcing the wanton endangerment charges against Hankison, Cameron choked up and expressed \"My heart breaks for the loss of Miss Taylor.\" Cameron initially said at the news conference that he had walked the grand jury through \"every homicide offense, and also presented all of the information that was available.\"Hannah Knowles & Marisa Iati, Kentucky attorney general says he did not present homicide charges to grand jury in Breonna Taylor case, Washington Post (September 28, 2020). The Louisville Courier Journal raised questions about whether the grand jury was allowed to decide if charges should have been pressed against Mattingly and Cosgrove or if prosecutors decided that the officers acted in self-defense without submitting the issue to the grand jury. Attorneys for Hankison and Walker requested the release of the grand jury transcript and related evidence. On September 28, 2020, a grand juror filed a court motion stating that Cameron had mischaracterized the grand-jury proceedings and was \"using grand jurors as a shield to deflect accountability and responsibility\" for charging decisions. A judge ordered the release of the grand jury proceedings' recording. A day later, Cameron said that he did not recommend murder charges to the grand jury, but maintained that he presented \"a thorough and complete case\" to the grand jurors. African American Prof. Glenn Loury said of Cameron's role in the Breonna Taylor case, \"I think we desperately need better African-American leadership - more courageous leadership, and people who are prepared to, you know, step away from and stand up for... what they know to be right. So, this demonization of the police officers... [the Breonna Taylor case] has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre... The gentleman who is in charge of the Attorney General's office in the State of Kentucky happens to be African- American, and he's been trying to hew a very difficult line, and he's met with much vilification. But we need a hundred of him to foster a different account of what's going on and to represent African-Americans in a different way.\" Minutes 55:00-56:33 ====National politics==== After his election as Kentucky attorney general, Cameron was seen as a rising star in the Republican Party. He spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention on August 24, 2020. In September 2020, Cameron appeared on a shortlist of potential U.S. Supreme Court nominees by President Donald Trump. ==Personal life== Cameron has been married twice. His first marriage, to Elizabeth Cameron, lasted from 2016 to 2017. He married a second time on July 31, 2020 in Louisville to Makenze Evans, a schoolteacher. ==See also== * Donald Trump Supreme Court candidates ==References== ==External links== * Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron official state government site Category:1985 births Category:21st-century American lawyers Category:21st-century American politicians Category:African- American lawyers Category:African-American people in Kentucky politics Category:American football defensive backs Category:Kentucky Attorneys General Category:Kentucky Republicans Category:Lawyers from Louisville, Kentucky Category:Living people Category:Louisville Cardinals football players Category:People from Elizabethtown, Kentucky Category:Politicians from Louisville, Kentucky Category:United States congressional aides Category:University of Louisville School of Law alumni ",
