    "text": "The Mariana Grajales Women's Platoon' (), or ', was an all-female military platoon created by Fidel Castro, Celia S\u00e1nchez, and Hayd\u00e9e Santamar\u00eda during the 26th of July Movement on 4 September 1958, named after the Cuban icon Mariana Grajales who served in the Cuban War of Independence. == History == After a group of women led by Isabel Rielo pleaded with Fidel Castro to create a women's unit, Castro summoned the leaders of the rebel army for a debate on 3 September 1958. After seven hours of discussion, at about 1a.m. Castro authorized the creation of the platoon. Isabel Rielo was selected to lead the platoon as the result of a shooting test. It is estimated by several accounts that women only made up about 5% of the total rebel forces during the Cuban Revolution. So the Mariana Grajales Platoon, which was composed of 13 young women, was a unique component of the revolutionary army. The platoon was essential in the rebels' 28 September 1958 victory over the Batista forces at Cerro Pelado (near modern-day Bartolom\u00e9 Mas\u00f3) after a three-day battle. Members of the platoon used M-1 carbines as their weapon of choice. Following victory in January 1959, the members of the platoon worked to build schools in the mountainous portion of eastern Cuba. On 4 September 1988, the 30th anniversary of the founding of the platoon, a commemorative event was held at the headquarters of the Women's Anti-Air Artillery Regiment. In attendance were Vilma Esp\u00edn, president of the Federation of Cuban Women, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb \u0110\u1ecbnh, then-Vice President of Vietnam and member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, and Corps General Julio Casas Regueiro of the Revolutionary Armed Forces. == Members == * Hayd\u00e9e Santamar\u00eda * Isabel Rielo Rodr\u00edguez (commanding officer) * Tet\u00e9 Puebla (second-in-command) * Olga Guevara P\u00e9rez * Eva Palma Rodr\u00edguez * Lilia Rielo Rodr\u00edguez * Rita Garc\u00eda Reyes * Angelina Antol\u00edn Escalona * Edemis Tamayo N\u00fa\u00f1ez * Norma Ferrer Ben\u00edtez * Flor P\u00e9rez Ch\u00e1vez * Juana Pe\u00f1a Pe\u00f1a * Orosia Soto Sardi\u00f1a * Ada Bella Acosta Pompa == See also == * Dickey Chapelle, an American photojournalist who reported on the Cuban Revolution and observed the platoon from the rebels' side * Federation of Cuban Women == References == == External links == * Las Marianas on EcuRed == Further reading == * Marianas in Combat: Tet\u00e9 Puebla and the Mariana Grajales Women's Platoon in Cuba's Revolutionary War 1956-58 Category:All-female military units and formations Category:History of Cuba Category:Military history of Cuba ",
