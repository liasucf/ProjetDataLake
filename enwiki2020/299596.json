Published by Faber and Faber, 1993 \u2014 #52 \u2014 p14 \u2014 is a knot in which the weight of the load the rope carries depresses the loop sufficiently to keep it in place until the load item is placed in its location. When no longer required the free end may be pulled and draw the loop through and so release the load. Image:Slipstek-3.jpg|Tying onto a ring.
