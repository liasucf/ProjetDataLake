    "text": "Schweriner Fernsehturm TV tower and radio mast The Schweriner Fernsehturm is a 136.5-metre-tall communications tower built of steel-concrete between 1960 and 1964 in Schwerin, Germany. Unlike most other TV towers, the ground plan is a spherical triangle and not a cylindric cross section. Also its tower basket, which also contains a restaurant, has no round form, but looks instead like a triangle with round sides. From 1991 to November 28, 1999, the restaurant was closed. In the neighbourhood of this tower at 53\u00b035'30,98\" N and 11\u00b027'19,8\" E, there is a 273-metre-high, radio mast for FM-radio and TV. == External links == * * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b1708 * * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b46001 Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1964 Category:Communication towers in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Schwerin Category:Restaurant towers ",
