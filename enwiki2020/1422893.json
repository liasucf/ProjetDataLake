It airs programming related to food, cooking, cuisine, and the food industry. The Canadian version of Food Network is a joint venture between Corus Entertainment and the American network's parent company Television Food Network, G.P. (which is majority-owned by Discovery Inc.). ==History== The American Food Network was available in Canada since 1997 and became one of the more popular foreign cable channels available in Canada. This prompted the creation of a Canadian version which would then be able to access ad revenue through commercials under Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations. Corus Entertainment and Alliance Atlantis launched the channel on October 9, 2000. Food Network's logo used from 2000 to 2005. After that it was changed to match the 2003 Food Network USA logo. The licence for Food Network Canada was approved by the CRTC in early 2000. The channel was launched in October of that year; on the day of the launch, the American service was removed from the list of foreign channels eligible to be broadcast in Canada. On January 18, 2008, a joint venture between Canwest and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners known as CW Media bought Alliance Atlantis and gained AAC's interest in Food Network. On October 27, 2010, ownership changed again as Shaw Communications gained control of Food Network as a result of its acquisition of Canwest and Goldman Sachs' interest in CW Media. On March 4, 2013, Corus Entertainment (also controlled by the Shaw family) announced the sale of its 22.58% ownership interest in Food Network to Shaw Media, in exchange for Shaw's 49% stake in ABC Spark.BCE to sell assets to Corus as part of Astral deal, The Globe and Mail (via Reuters and The Canadian Press), March 4, 2013. The sale closed in April 2013. On April 1, 2016, Shaw Media was subsumed into Corus as part of a corporate reorganization, which made it the majority owner once more. ==Food Network HD== Food Network HD logo used before 2014 On October 5, 2011, Shaw Media launched Food Network HD, a 1080i high definition simulcast of the standard definition feed.Food Network Canada looking better than ever Shaw Media press release 2011-10-05 It is available through all major TV providers. ==See also== * Canadian cuisine * Cooking Channel (Canada) * DIY Network * HGTV * Food Network * Food Network (Australia) * List of Food Network Canada personalities * List of programs broadcast by Food Network Canada ==References== ==External links== * * Adams, Liz; Food Network cooks up Canadian menu; Strategy Magazine; 07/17/2000. * Decision CRTC 2000-217; CRTC; 07/04/2000.
