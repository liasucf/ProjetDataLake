He played football for Yorkshire Amateur and as an amateur for South Shields, then turned professional when he moved to Birmingham in 1920. He spent the whole twelve years of his professional playing career at the club, for whom he made 345 appearances as wing half or full back in all competitions, and played in the 1931 FA Cup Final. He was described as a powerful defender who read the game well and was positive on the ball. When manager Leslie Knighton left Birmingham for Chelsea in 1933, Liddell succeeded him. He remained in charge while the club retained their top-flight status, leaving the job at the end of the 1938\u201339 season when the club were relegated. During his six-year tenure he selected 70 different players for first team duty. A trained teacher, Liddell taught at several schools in the Birmingham area, including Handsworth New Road Secondary Modern School where he was head teacher in the early 1950s. ==Honours== Birmingham * FA Cup finalist: 1930\u201331 ==References== General * Specific Category:1895 births Category:Year of death missing Category:People from Murton, County Durham Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Yorkshire Amateur A.F.C. players Category:South Shields F.C.
