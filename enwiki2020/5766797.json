    "text": "The 1995\u201396 season was the 99th season of competitive football in Scotland. ==Scottish Premier Division== ===Summary=== Rangers won the Premier Division with a record 87 points, finishing four ahead of rivals Celtic. Aberdeen were third with 55 points (on goal difference). Falkirk were relegated after finishing bottom. Partick Thistle were relegated via the play-offs, losing 3\u20132 on aggregate to Dundee United, who returned to the Premier Division at the first attempt. This was the only occasion on which this short-lived play-off system relegated a team from the Premier Division. Rangers qualified for the European Cup, with Celtic and Aberdeen making it into the UEFA Cup. All three clubs entered at the qualifying round stage. Celtic's Pierre van Hooijdonk was the top scorer with 26 goals, ahead of the Rangers trio of Gordon Durie (17), Ally McCoist (16) and Paul Gascoigne (14). Rangers recorded the biggest win of the campaign with a 7\u20130 home win over Hibernian, with Gordon Durie scoring four times. Incredibly, Hibs had won 1\u20130 at Ibrox just three months earlier, and Hearts won 3\u20130 there just three weeks after the 7\u20130 match. Celtic went 31 games unbeaten, from 4 October to the end of the season. Motherwell had the best winning run with five consecutive successes, while Falkirk lost eight in a row. Meadowbank Thistle, who had been relegated from the Second Division, were renamed Livingston to reflect their relocation from Edinburgh to Livingston for this season. The renamed club ended the season as Third Division champions. ===Table=== Champions: Rangers Relegated: Partick Thistle, Falkirk ==Scottish League Division One== Promoted: Dunfermline Athletic, Dundee United Relegated: Hamilton Academical, Dumbarton ==Scottish League Division Two== Promoted: Stirling Albion, East Fife Relegated: Forfar Athletic, Montrose ==Scottish League Division Three== Promoted: Livingston, Brechin City ==Other honours== ===Cup honours=== Rangers won the Scottish Cup, beating Hearts 5\u20131 in the final, with Gordon Durie scoring a second half hat-trick. The Coca-Cola Cup went to Aberdeen, who beat Dundee 2\u20130 to win the trophy for the sixth time.The 1945\u201346 competition was not competed for by all clubs, owing to wartime restrictions, and does not usually count towards official records, often being referred to as the 'Southern League Cup'. However, Aberdeen include it on their honour roll. The Challenge Cup was won by Stenhousemuir, who beat Dundee United on penalties after a 0\u20130 draw. United never conceded a goal in the competition. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !width=140|Competition !width=135|Winner !width=80|Score !width=135|Runner-up !Report |- |align=left|Scottish Cup 1995\u201396 |Rangers |5 \u2013 1 |Heart of Midlothian |Wikipedia article |- |align=left|League Cup 1995\u201396 |Aberdeen |2 \u2013 0 |Dundee |Wikipedia article |- |align=left|Challenge Cup 1995\u201396 |Stenhousemuir |0 \u2013 0 (5 \u2013 4 pen.) |Dundee United ||Wikipedia article |- |align=left|Youth Cup |Celtic |4 \u2013 1 |Dundee | |- |align=left|Junior Cup |Tayport |2 \u2013 0 |Camelon | |} ===Individual honours=== ====SPFA awards==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=170|Award ! width=150|Winner ! width=140|Club |- |Players' Player of the Year || Paul Gascoigne || Rangers |- |Young Player of the Year || Jackie McNamara || Celtic |} ====SFWA awards==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=170|Award ! width=150|Winner ! width=140|Club |- | Footballer of the Year || Paul Gascoigne || Rangers |- | Manager of the Year || Walter Smith || Rangers |} ==Scottish clubs in Europe== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Club !Competition(s) !Final round !Coef. |- |Rangers |UEFA Champions League ||Group stage |5.50 |- |Celtic |UEFA Cup Winners' Cup |Second round |4.00 |- |Raith Rovers |UEFA Cup |Second round |3.50 |- |Motherwell |UEFA Cup |Preliminary round |1.00 |} Average coefficient - 3.500 ==Scotland national team== Scotland recorded home wins over Greece, Finland and San Marino between August and November in the European Championship qualifiers to secure qualification, keeping a clean sheet in each match. The final three friendly matches before Euro 96 were lost, including two just two weeks before the first match. In the competition, Scotland battled to a 0\u20130 draw in the opener against the Netherlands at Villa Park. They were then beaten 2\u20130 at Wembley by hosts England in the second group match. During this match Gary McAllister had a penalty kick saved by David Seaman when the score was 1\u20130 to England. Moments later, Paul Gascoigne scored one of the great Wembley goals to make the score 2\u20130 and effectively win the match. Going into the final match at Villa Park, Scotland had to beat Switzerland and hope that England beat the Netherlands, while also needing a five-goal swing in their favour. A goal by Ally McCoist put Scotland on their way to a 1\u20130 victory and with England leading 4\u20130 against the Dutch, Scotland were going through. But Patrick Kluivert scored a 78th-minute goal against England, which was enough to send Craig Brown's squad out of the tournament on goals scored (goal difference was tied). {| class=\"wikitable\" !Date !Venue !Opponents ! !Competition !Scotland scorer(s) |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |16 August 1995 |Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) | Greece |align=center|1\u20130 |ECQG8 |Ally McCoist |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |6 September 1995 |Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) | Finland |align=center|1\u20130 |ECQG8 |Scott Booth |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |11 October 1995 |R\u00e5sunda Stadium, Stockholm (A) | Sweden |align=center|0\u20132 |Friendly | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |15 November 1995 |Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) | San Marino |align=center|5\u20130 |ECQG8 |Eoin Jess, Scott Booth, Ally McCoist, Pat Nevin, own goal |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |27 March 1996 |Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) | Australia |align=center|1\u20130 |Friendly |Ally McCoist |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |24 April 1996 |Parken Stadium, Copenhagen (A) | Denmark |align=center|0\u20132 |Friendly | |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |26 May 1996 |Veteran's Stadium, New Britain, Connecticut (A) | USA |align=center|1\u20132 |Friendly |Gordon Durie |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |29 May 1996 |Orange Bowl, Miami, Florida (A) | Colombia |align=center|0\u20131 |Friendly | |-bgcolor=#ffffdd |10 June 1996 |Villa Park, Birmingham (N) | Netherlands |align=center|0\u20130 |ECGA | |-bgcolor=#ffdddd |15 June 1996 |Wembley Stadium, London (N) | England |align=center|0\u20132 |ECGA | |-bgcolor=#ddffdd |18 June 1996 |Villa Park, Birmingham (N) | Switzerland |align=center|1\u20130 |ECGA |Ally McCoist |} Key: *(H) = Home match *(A) = Away match *ECQ8 = European Championship qualifying - Group 8 *ECGA = European Championship - Group A ==Notes and references== Category:Seasons in Scottish football ",
