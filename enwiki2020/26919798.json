    "text": "Robert Danneberg (23 July 1882, in Vienna - approx 12 December 1942, in Auschwitz) was an Austrian-Jewish politician, a member of the Social Democratic Workers Party of Austria (SDAP\u00d6) and a prominent Austro-Marxist theoretician. Danneberg was one of the architects of Red Vienna and he was killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942. ==Life== Danneburg was born in Vienna on 23 July 1882. He joined SDAP\u00d6 and the Workers Youth Association in 1903. Danneberg was active in the international youth movement, and became the Secretary of the International Union of Socialist Youth Organisations in 1908, however when the war broke out he withdrew from his position because he thought working for the Youth International was pointless during war time so the chairmanship was given to Willi M\u00fcnzenberg. In the same year, he became responsible for the educational and cultural programmes of the party and took on the editorship of the SDAP\u00d6 educational journal Die Bildungsarbeit. In 1909 Danneberg obtained a doctorate in Law.Blau, Eve. The Architecture of Red Vienna, 1919-1934. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1999. p. 135 During the First World War, Danneberg belonged to the 'Anti-War left' inside SDAP\u00d6. Nevertheless, he opposed division of the party and the launching of the Communist Party of Austria. Danneberg married Gertrud Schr\u00f6bler in 1918. They had two children together. Danneberg was a parliamentarian between 1919 and 1934. Moreover, he became the president of the Vienna Provincial Assembly.Blau, Eve. The Architecture of Red Vienna, 1919-1934.
