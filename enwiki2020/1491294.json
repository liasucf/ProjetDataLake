    "text": "Thomaz Soares da Silva, also known as Zizinho (; 14 October 1921 - 8 February 2002), was a Brazilian footballer who played as an attacking midfielder for the Brazil national football team. He is considered as one of the greatest football players of all time. He came to international prominence at the 1950 World Cup, where he scored two goals. He was lauded as a complete player, renowned for his incredible array of offensive skills such as his dribbling, passing, and shooting ability with both feet, as well as his accuracy from dead ball situations and extraordinary vision, and is often considered the best Brazilian footballer of the pre-Pel\u00e9 era. ==Career== Born at Niter\u00f3i, Rio de Janeiro, he played for Flamengo, Bangu, S\u00e3o Paulo FC, Audax Italiano of Chile among others teams. He is considered the first idol of Flamengo, club that he defended - winning the state championships in 1942, 1943 and 1944 - until he was transferred just before the start of 1950 World Cup to Bangu. In S\u00e3o Paulo he won the state championship in 1957 being extremely important and becoming an idol. In the 1950 World Cup he helped Brazil to progress to the final, but their surprise 2\u20131 defeat to Uruguay tarnished his reputation. Zizinho played a total of 53 times for his national team, scoring 30 goals. He turned down last minute invitations by the CBF to join first the 1954 World Cup Squad and then the 1958 squad, citing on both occasions that it would be unfair on the player being dropped at the last minute to make way for him. Pel\u00e9 always said that Zizinho was the best player he ever saw. \"He was a complete player. He played in midfield, in attack, he scored goals, he could mark, head and cross.\" ==Honours== ===Club=== *Campeonato Carioca: 1942, 1943, 1944 *Campeonato Paulista: 1957 ===International=== *FIFA World Cup runner-up: 1950 *South American Championship: 1949 *Ta\u00e7a do Atl\u00e2ntico: 1956 *Roca Cup: 1945 *Copa Rio Branco: 1950 *Ta\u00e7a Oswaldo Cruz: 1955, 1956 ===Individual=== *FIFA World Cup Golden Ball: 1950 *FIFA World Cup All-Star Team: 1950 *IFFHS Brazilian Player of the 20th Century (4th place)IFFHS' Century Elections *IFFHS South American Player of the 20th Century (10th place) *Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame === Records === * South American Championship / Copa Am\u00e9rica all-time top goalscorer: 17 goals (shared with Norberto Doroteo M\u00e9ndez) ==References== ==External links== * * Profile at cbf.com.br * Craque Imortal Category:1922 births Category:2002 deaths Category:People from S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, Rio de Janeiro Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazilian football managers Category:1949 South American Championship players Category:1950 FIFA World Cup players Category:Copa Am\u00e9rica-winning players Category:Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Expatriate footballers in Chile Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A managers Category:Brazil international footballers Category:Clube de Regatas do Flamengo footballers Category:Bangu Atl\u00e9tico Clube players Category:S\u00e3o Paulo FC players Category:Uberaba Sport Club players Category:Audax Italiano footballers Category:Bangu Atl\u00e9tico Clube managers Category:CR Vasco da Gama managers Category:Association football forwards ",
