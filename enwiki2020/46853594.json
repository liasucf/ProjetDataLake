It is one of only two handmade globemaking companies in the world. ==History== Bellerby & Co's 'Churchill' globe being painted After a career in television, Peter Bellerby was running a music venue in London that included a bowling alley, when he started a search for a special globe for his father's 80th birthday. Not finding what he wanted, he set about making a globe himself by hand which led to the founding of the company in 2008. Two globes were commissioned for the 2011 film Hugo. In 2012, the company hosted the first globe exhibition at The Royal Geographical Society, and in the same year, an egg-shaped Bellerby globe was donated to The Faberge Big Egg Hunt charity for auction in London. The auction raised \u00a311,100 for the Elephant Family conservation movement. A second \"egg\" globe was auctioned at Sotheby's in New York in 2014 and raised $25,000, for both Elephant Family and Action for Children. The company has collaborated with British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare, for example on a \"globe head\" for his ballerina statue for the Royal Opera House. In 2017 the company made about 500 globes,https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/316101 including a commissioned globe that illustrates Royal Ascot's 300-year heritage.https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/ascot-racecourse-unveils-globe- mapping-its-horse-racing-history-a3480341.html In 2018 the company received a Queen's Award for Enterprise in the international trade category.http://queensawardsmagazine.com/award_year/2018/ It also took part in the Homo Faber exhibition,https://www.homofaberevent.com/en/experience- singular-talents collaborated with artist George Butler in an exhibition at the Bankside Gallery,https://www.londonlive.co.uk/news/2018-11-20/award- winning-war-illustrator and was commissioned by the family of Reinhold W\u00fcrth to create a Churchill Globe for his 83rd birthday. The globe displays places and events which played an important role in his life.https://www.wuerth.com/web/en/wuerthcom/unternehmen/geschichte/um_die_welt_mit_reinhold_wuerth/globus_reinhold_wuerth.php ==Globemaking== Originally made from hemispheres of plaster of Paris glued together, the company's small globes are now made from resin and the larger from composite materials. The company employs two cartographers and uses a modern map of their own design that customers are invited to customise. The maps are printed onto paper gores and cut by hand. The paper is wet and stretched across the sphere before being hand painted and finished with a matte or gloss finish.https://www.theweek.co.uk/87020/peter-bellerby-bespoke- globes The globes are weighted so they come slowly to rest when spun. The wood and metal bases are made in the company's London studio. Their 80 series is made in connection with heritage technicians from Aston Martin.http://www.handfulofsalt.com/peter-bellerby-x-bellerby-co/ Some bases are mounted on ball bearings, others can be spun within hand-engraved solid brass meridians. The \"Churchill Globe\", at around fifty inches in diameter, is the largest made by the company. Its design is based on a Weber Costello, Chicago-made globe presented to Winston Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt by George Marshall, the US Army's Chief of Staff during World War II. ==References== Category:Manufacturing companies based in London Category:British companies established in 2008 Category:Map companies of the United Kingdom Category:Luxury brands ",
