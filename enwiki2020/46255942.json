An intelligent player who has often been praised for his ability to read the game, Tola has also been deployed as a defensive midfielder by former PKR Svay Rieng FC coach Sam Vandeth and former national team coach Prak Sovannara. But after the arrival of Irish coach Conor Nester at the start of the 2018 MCL season, Tola was converted back to a forward and was given the number 9 shirt. ==External links== * * ==References== Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Association football forwards Category:Association football defenders Category:Cambodian footballers Category:Cambodia international footballers Category:Sportspeople from Phnom Penh Category:Preah Khan Reach Svay Rieng FC players Category:Competitors at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games ",
