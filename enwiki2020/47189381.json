Early on he developed interest in the traditional painting techniques of Nihonga, however on behest of his parents he first studied law and economics at the Aichi University. He began his artistic career after graduating and developed into one of the foremost representatives of Nihonga. In 1967 he married his wife Hiroko, who would encourage him in his pursuit of painting. In 1994 he visited the Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie and Giverny in France. He was inspired by Claude Monet and produced a number of paintings and by\u014dbu screens that re-interpret Monet's Water Lilies, which in turn originally were inspired by Japonisme.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7ypL7-H81E Reiji's Water Lilies were exhibited in 2013 at the Museum of Impressionism in Giverny,http://giverny.org/museums/impressionism/exhibition/hiramatsu/ as well as the Museum of Asian Art in Berlin.http://www.smb.museum/ausstellungen/detail/hiramatsu-reiji- seerosenbilder-hommage-a-monet.html In 2013 he also donated 34 pieces, including \u201cJapanese Apricot Banquet\u201d and \u201cMt.
