He and his wife are buried at the Rhodes family plot in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence.Long Time Gone ==Legacy== Elisha Hunt Rhodes is most remembered for his wartime journal and letters published as All For the Union by a great- grandson, Robert H. Rhodes. This diary reflects Rhodes' ideas about the Civil War, including his unwavering belief that the Union must be preserved, as well as his Christian faith and belief in God. At the end it shows a somewhat conflicted young man who wanted to be home with his family after trials of war but who also found life in the Army very agreeable to him. His writings were made famous by their incorporation into filmmaker Ken Burns' PBS-TV documentary series The Civil War. His large collection of personal relics and mementos is now owned by the Rhode Island Historical Society in Providence. ==References== * The Union Army; A History of Military Affairs in the Loyal States, 1861-65 -- Records of the Regiments in the Union Army -- Cyclopedia of Battles -- Memoirs of Commanders and Soldiers, Federal Publishing Company (Madison, Wisconsin), 1908 (reprinted by Broadfoot Publishing, 1997), Volume 1, pp. 228\u201330. ==External links== *GAR veterans bio of Rhodes Category:1842 births Category:1917 deaths Category:American diarists Category:People of Rhode Island in the American Civil War Category:Union Army generals Category:Burials at Swan Point Cemetery ",
