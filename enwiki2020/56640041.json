He was a seller of fruit and vegetables. He is also rapper. He was not much known before he went through legal proceedings for anti-Spanish state remarks.http://www.leparisien.fr/international/le-rappeur-espagnol-valtonyc- vise-par-un-mandat-d-arret-international-24-05-2018-7733379.php. ==Legal problems== Demonstration against the law called \" gag\" He was arrested on 23 August 2012 when he was 18 . In February 2018, the Spanish Supreme Court confirmed his sentence by the Audiencia Nacional of three and a half years in jail after being convicted of slander, L\u00e8se-majest\u00e9, and glorifying terrorism in his lyrics. Court papers referenced lyrics \"supporting and praising\" ETA, GRAPO, wishing death on politicians and members of the Spanish Royal Family. Valt\u00f2nyc is believed to be the first Spanish musician to be imprisoned for his lyrics since the 1977 restoration of democracy in Spain. On 23 May 2018, the day before he was to enter prison, it was reported that he had fled to Belgium to avoid arrest. On 5 July, he reported to the police in the Belgian city of Ghent, following a European Arrest Warrant issued by the Spanish authorities to have him extradited to Spain. He was heard by an examining judge of the tribunal of first instance of Ghent, who decided there was no reason to assume he would try to flee from Belgium. Valt\u00f2nyc was released under conditions later that day. The spokesperson of the prosecutor's office of Ghent stated additional documents have been requested from the Spanish authorities. When those would be made available, the court's raadkamer (counsel chamber) was to decide whether Valt\u00f2nyc would be extradited. The court of Ghent had previously refused to extradite some Spanish fugitives in its history, such as Mar\u00eda Natividad Jauregui Espina, who was accused by the Spanish authorities of having been involved in ETA terrorist attacks in 1981.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45550944 In order to clear any doubt, the European Court of Justice was appealed and stated that Valtonyc was illegally condemned with a law passed after he wrote his songs https://elpais.com/espana/2020-03-03/la-justicia-europea-da-la-razon-a- valtonyc-y-complica-su-entrega-a-espana.html. ==Discography== * El Reincident (2018) * Neversleep (2016) * La autodestrucci\u00f3n y sus ventajas (auto edited, 2015) * Simbiosi (auto edited, 2015) * Eutan\u00e0sia (auto edited, 2014) * Microglicerina (auto edited, 2013) * Aina i altres ansietats (auto edited, 2013) * Cadenes (auto edited, 2012) * Rap rural (amb Swing) (2012) * Mallorca \u00e9s ca nostra (auto edited, 2012) * Residus d'un poeta (auto edited, 2012) * Jazz amb ll\u00e0grimes de rom (auto edited, 2011) * Misantropia (auto edited, 2010) * Desde el papel (auto edited, 2009) ==References== Category:People from Sa Pobla Category:Spanish male rappers Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish exiles Category:Fugitives wanted by Spain ",
