    "text": "The Tasmagambetov Cabinet was the 5th government of Kazakhstan. Led by Prime Minister Imangali Tasmagambetov, it was formed on 28 January 2002 after his predecessor Kassym-Jomart Tokayev stepped down from his post along with his entire cabinet. President Nursultan Nazarbayev nominated Tasmagmabetov for office to which it was unanimously approved by the Parliament. Prior to that, Tasmagambetov served as the Deputy PM under Tokayev's cabinet. It was believed that the cause of the change in the government was an attempt to strengthen its stability as it faced opposition from political groups. On 11 June 2003, Tasmagambetov resigned after failing to persuade the Parliament to pass a bill in a form desired by President Nazarbayev that would've privatized land in Kazakhstan. He accused of the Parliament for falsifying the vote which took place on 19 May. Nazarbayev appointed Daniyal Akhmetov as the Acting PM who was confirmed by the Parliament on 13 June to form the 6th government. Tasmagambetov that day was appointed as the State Secretary. == Composition == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Functions ! colspan=\"2\" |Holder !Start !End |- |Prime Minister |134x134px |Imangali Tasmagambetov |28 January 2002 |11 June 2003 |- |First Deputy Prime Minister | |Aleksandr Pavlov |28 August 2002 |6 January 2004 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |137x137px |Karim Massimov |27 November 2001 |June 2003 |- |Deputy Prime Minister | |Aleksandr Pavlov |29 January 2002 |28 August 2002 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |129x129px |Bauyrzhan Mukhamedzhanov |29 January 2002 |June 2003 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |142x142px |Akhmetzhan Yessimov |28 May 2002 |19 January 2006 |- |Prime Minister's Office | |Altai Tleuberdin |13 December 2000 |10 January 2007 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Foreign Affairs |112x112px |Erlan Idrissov |12 October 1999 |29 January 2002 |- |130x130px |Kassym-Jomart Tokayev |29 January 2002 |11 January 2007 |- |Ministry of Defense |145x145px |Mukhtar Altynbayev |8 December 2001 |10 January 2007 |- |Ministry of Internal Affairs | |Kairbek Suleimenov |30 January 2002 |12 September 2003 |- |Ministry of Agriculture |146x146px |Akhmetzhan Yessimov |18 May 2001 |14 May 2004 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Justice |139x139px |Georgy Kim |29 January 2002 |25 February 2003 |- | |Onalsyn Zhumabekov |25 February 2003 |April 2005 |- |Ministry of Education and Science | |Shamsha Berkimbaeva |30 January 2002 |14 June 2003 |- |Ministry of Healthcare | |Jaqsylyq Doskaliev |17 October 2001 |4 April 2004 |- |Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population | |Gulzhan Karagusova |22 November 2001 |12 July 2007 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Transport and Communications | |Ablai Myrzahmetov |November 2001 |16 April 2002 |- | |Qajymurat Nagymanov |18 May 2002 |25 May 2005 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Ministry of Industry and Trade | |Majit Esenbaev |28 August 2002 |June 2003 |- |142x142px |Adilbek Zhakysbekov |16 June 2003 |December 2004 |- | |Sauat Mynbayev |14 December 2004 |January 2006 |- |Ministry of Culture, Information and Public Accord | rowspan=\"2\" |131x131px | rowspan=\"2\" |Mukhtar Kul- Mukhammed |4 May 2001 |13 September 2003 |- |Ministry of Culture, Information and Sports |13 September 2003 |29 September 2004 |- |Ministry of Finance | |Aleksandr Pavlov |29 January 2002 |27 August 2002 |- |Ministry of Economy and Trade | |Majit Esenbaev |30 January 2002 |28 August 2002 |- |Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning |110x110px |Kairat Kelimbetov |28 August 2002 |18 April 2006 |- |Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection | |Andar Shoqpytov |22 December 2000 |August 2000 |- |Ministry of Environmental Protection | |Aitkul Samakova |29 August 2002 |1 February 2006 |} == References == Category:Cabinets of Kazakhstan Category:2002 in Kazakhstan Category:Cabinets established in 2002 Category:2002 establishments in Kazakhstan ",
