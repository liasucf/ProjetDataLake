    "text": "Serpianosaurus mirigiolensis is an extinct species of semi-aquatic reptile belonging to the family Pachypleurosauridae. These reptiles lived in the Middle Triassic (Anisian/Ladinian boundary, about 242 million years ago) and its fossil remains were discovered in the oldest strata of Monte San Giorgio, on the border between Italy and Switzerland. Other fossils attributed to this genus have been found in Germany and Italy. ==Description== This species can be distinguished from other closely related pachypleurosaurs on the basis of its proportionally large skull and straight jaw. Males and females are thought to differ in humeral size and shape. Unlike other pachipleurosaurs pachyostosis of the ribs is absent (the thickening of the ribs typical of many aquatic animals) and this is a primitive feature within the group.Palaeos ==Bibliography== *Rieppel, O.
