    "text": "The Teufelsm\u00fchle () is a mountain south of Loffenau in the Northern Black Forest. It lies between the valleys of the Murg in the west and the Alb in the east. The Alb rises near the eastern flank of the mountain (at the Albursprung), before reaching Bad Herrenalb a few kilometres further north. Over the summit plateau of the Teufelsm\u00fchle, which runs in a north-south direction, runs the boundary between the municipalities of Gernsbach in the Murg valley and Loffenau, both of which belong to the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg county of Rastatt. == Infrastructure == View to the Nortwest - sitting on a stone - from Loffenau to Rhine Valley In 1910, the Teufelsm\u00fchle Tower was erected on the summit plateau, which stood 10 metres high.Teufelsm\u00fchle-Turm Loffenau at badische-seiten.de, retrieved 6 January 2015 In 1952 the observation tower was raised to a height of 16.2 metres. In 1958, a building was added that was eventually expanded into a hiker's inn. Not far from the tower stand the Teufelsm\u00fchle mountain inn.Die Teufelsm\u00fchle in Loffenau auf Schwarzwald Informationen, retrieved on 6 January 2015 Together the building and the guest house of Teufelsm\u00fchle form a hamlet in the municipality of Loffenau.Teufelsm\u00fchle (Wohnplatz) at Landesarchiv Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, retrieved 21 July 2013 It is accessible by motor vehicles on a minor road from Ri\u00dfwasen.

The landing zone is 550 metres below at Loffenau. On the Teufelsm\u00fchle Tower is a plaque with a picture of Hubertus Waldteufel, a local poet, whose real name was Emil Dietz and who lived from 1879 to 1957, ending his days in Bad Herrenalb-Zieflensberg. The Waldteufel Way (Waldteufelweg) in Upper Gaistal is named after him.Heinz Volz: Die Spur des Waldteufels, in: Badisches Tagblatt, Lokalausgabe Murgtal dated 7 March 2009 == Name == The Teufelsm\u00fchle does not get its name (which means \"Devil's Mill\") from an actual mill, but a popular interpretation of the glacial stone run found here. In the absence of a nearby rock massif and without knowing about the transportation of large boulders by prehistoric glaciers, the existence of large boulders is difficult to explain. So according to legend the scattered boulders were blocks from a former mill built by the devil. == References == == External links == * * Description of the hiking trail to the Teufelsm\u00fchle on the official website of Bad Herrenalb * Description of the path to the Teufelsm\u00fchle * History and description of the Teufelsm\u00fchle with zoomable panoramic photograph.
