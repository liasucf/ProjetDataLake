Most people are engaged in agriculture, farming and trading. The main cash crops are: rubber, paddy, coconut, areca nut, ginger, turmeric, 'kacholam' and pepper. Koothattukulam which today covers an area of 2318.71 hectares lies 17 km to the south of Muvattupuzha town and 38 km to the north of Kottayam town via the MC Road which passes through this town. ==Four Brahmin families== It is believed that originally this area had been ruled by the four Brahmin families of Athiman Illom, Kottanadu, Kattimuttam and Pariyaram. ==Territories== Today the Koothattukulam consists of the four distinct territories (locally known as \u2018karas\u2019) of Koothattukulam, Vadakara, Paittakulam and Kizhakombu and has a population of about 18,970. ==Etymology from legends== There are interesting folklores connected with the current names of each of the territories. One of them relates to a lady who, while digging in an isolated hillock inadvertently hit the head of a sunken idol with her implement. Immediately, blood began to ooze out of the idol\u2019s head and on seeing this the terrified lady took to her heels. This shock and terror upset her balance of mind, driving her ultimately to madness and she spent the rest of her days wandering aimlessly (\u2019koothady\u2019) from place to place. The place thus came to be called as \u2018Koothattakalam\u2019 which over a period of time became known as Koothattukulam. The spot where the idol\u2019s blood is believed to have spilt was called Chorakuzhy (\u2019pool of blood\u2019). ==Annexation== Prior to the annexation of this area to his kingdom by the Marthandavarma Maharaja of Travancore, the land had been ruled by the kings of Vadakkumkoor. They had a weapons training centre at Oonakkur, and so, this place came to be known as \u2018payattukalam\u2019, which is the present-day Paittakkulam. It is believed that some members of the Keezhekkombil family who were experts in domesticating wild elephants came over from Elanji and settled over here, which is why the place came to be known as Kizhakombu. ==Tenth Century== In the beginning of the tenth century, a group of devotees from Vatakara in Malabar set out for the church at Kuravilangad, carrying with them a picture or a statue (still disputed) of Yohannan Mamdana. On their way to Kuravilangad, these people rested at a place near aittakulam and on account of this, the area was subsequently known as Vadakara. ==Buddhist period== In his famous book \u2018Keralathile Sthalacharithrangal\u2019, the prominent historian and researcher V. V. K. Valath has pointed out that the cultural history of Koothattukulam dates back to the era of Buddhism and Jainism. Koothattukulam, thus, has an illustrious cultural history and the same is reflected in its very name, which suggests that this must have been a land of \u2018kooth\u2019 and \u2018aattam\u2019. Looking at the forays made by the current generation of this place into the arena of art and culture, such a guess is not too far off. ==Administrative System== Even about 100 years back, establishments like a quasi-judicial court, hospital, sub-registrar\u2019s office, police station, post office, rest house (circuit house), tourist bungalow, Devaswam Board office and an excise inspectorate, all of which normally form part of a District HQs set up, had been established here. ==Religions== From time immemorial, Koothattukulam has been a shining example of religious tolerance and comity. Hindus and Christians live here in complete harmony. Christian churches steeped in the cultural traditions of the Buddhist-Jainist era are a characteristic feature of the area. Though Christians form the majority of the population, there are a number of places of worship belonging to both religions. The Mahadeva temple at Koothattukulam, the Onamkunnu Kavu, the Shiva temple at Arjunanmala, the Devi temple at Kizhakombu, The St. John the Baptist Catholic Church and The St. John\u2019s Syrian Jacobite Church at Vadakara etc... are just a few of the places of worship dating back several centuries. The St Jude shrine(Holy Family Church) is one of the Catholic Church in Koothattukulam. Holy Family Church dates back to 10th century, though it became Syro-Malabar Church in 1994 and on 20 October 2000 St.Jude Shrine was blessed and St. Jude Novena started here and within few years period its popularity has spread worldwide as God's grace abundantly showered here and people witnessed many miracles and healings. The church possesses the record of world's biggest oil lamp by Limca Book of Records in 2008. As an extra ordinary act here 1001 oil wicks are lit. And to continue this service uninterrupted and most beautiful and effective way a 1001 wicks Bronze Lamp has been manufactured(6640kg weight, 9 Storey, 24.5 foot height). ==References== Category:History of Ernakulam district ",
