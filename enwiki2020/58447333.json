    "text": "\"Kya\" (Ka+Ya) conjunct consonant in the Brahmi script, consisting in the vertical assembly of consonants \"Ka\" 12px and \"Ya\" 12px. Used in the spelling of the word \"Shakyamuni\" to designate the Buddha, Rummindei pillar of Ashoka (circa 250 BCE). Evolution of the conjunct consonant \"Sya\" (Sa+Ya) in Brahmic scripts. Some major conjunct consonants in the Brahmi script. Conjunct consonants are a type of letters, used for example in Brahmi or Brahmi derived modern scripts such as Balinese, Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, etc to write consonant clusters such as or . Although most of the time, letters are formed by using a simple consonant with the inherent value vowel \"a\" (as with \"k\" 12px, pronounced \"ka\" in Brahmi), or by combining a consonant with an vowel in the form of a diacritic (as with \"ki\" 12px in Brahmi), the usage of conjunct consonant permits the creation of more sophisticated sounds (as with \"kya\" 12px, formed with the consonants k 10px and y 10px assembled vertically). Conjuncts are often used with loan words. Native words typically use the basic consonant and native speakers know to suppress the vowel. In modern Devanagari the components of a conjunct are written left to right when possible (when the first consonant has a vertical stem that can be removed at the right), whereas in Brahmi characters are joined vertically downwards. Some simple examples of conjunct consonants in Devanagari are: \u0924 + \u0935 = \u0924\u094d\u0935 tva, \u0923 + \u0922 = \u0923\u094d\u0922 \u1e47\u1e0dha, \u0938 + \u0925 = \u0938\u094d\u0925 stha, where the vertical stroke of the first letter is simply lost in the combination. Sometimes, conjunct consonants are not clearly derived from the letters making up their components: the conjunct for k\u1e63 is \u0915\u094d\u0937 (\u0915\u094d + \u0937) and for j\u00f1 it is \u091c\u094d\u091e (\u091c\u094d + \u091e). Some examples of conjunct consonants in Gujarati are: \u0aaa + \u0a9d = \u0aaa\u0acd\u0a9d pjha (where the first letter of the stroke is lost in the combination), \u0ab9 + \u0ab3 = \u0ab9\u0acd\u0ab3 h\u1e37a, \u0a9c + \u0aad = \u0a9c\u0acd\u0aad jbha. Sometimes, conjunct consonants are not clearly derived from the letters making up their components: the conjunct for \u015bc is \u0ab6\u0acd\u0a9a (\u0ab6\u0acd + \u0a9a) and for \u00f1j it is \u0a9e\u0acd\u0a9c (\u0a9e\u0acd + \u0a9c). Conjunct consonants are used in many other scripts as well, usually derived from the Brahmi script. In Balinese, conjunct consonants are called Haksara Wrehastra. ==See also== * Devanagari conjuncts ==References== Category:Writing systems ",
