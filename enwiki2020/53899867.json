Mont-Huon Military Cemetery is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery close to Le Tr\u00e9port, north-west of Dieppe on the north-west coast of France. The cemetery holds over 2,300 dead from both World War I and World War II. ==History== Le Tr\u00e9port was the scene of much Allied activity during World War I due to its proximity to the front line, it had ready access to England and was chosen to establish a hospital where the Trianon Grand HotelInformation plaque at entrance. was put into service to provide 500 beds. The local civilian cemetery quickly became over-crowded and the first military cemetery also become over-crowded, requiring the establishment of Mont-Huon in the summer of 1917. The Second World War saw the reopening of the cemetery to cope with the casualties of that war. Seven men are buried in Mont-Huon Military Cemetery from World War II, in two separate sections. The slight discrepancy (by one) in the number of Allied burials (WW1=2,128 & WW2=7; total = 2,135 v 2,134) is because there is one non-combatant buried in Mont-Huon. Mrs Gertrude Chambers, who died 1 December 1918 aged 27 is interred in Mont-Huon. Her headstone reads \"Had he asked us we would say God we love her let her stay\". ==The cemetery== Designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield, Mont-Huon Military Cemetery contains the remains of soldiers from the Allies and Germany. In total, the cemetery contains 2,349 burials of which over 200 are German burials.
