    "text": "Don Andr\u00e9s de Tapia Motelchiuhtzin Huitznahuatlail\u00f3tlac was the ruler of Tenochtitlan (1525\u20131530). After the death of Don Juan Vel\u00e1zquez Tlacotzin in Nochixtlan in 1525, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s chose Don Andr\u00e9s Motelchiuhtzin as the new ruler of Tenochtitlan. Motelchiuhtzin was not of the upper classes; he was born as a \"macehualli\" or working commoner, but he had gained renown as a warrior captain. He was captured together with Cuauht\u00e9moc, and tortured along with him to reveal the location of the Aztecs' gold. Eventually he was freed and he returned to his lands. Because Tenochtitlan was in ruins, he stayed in Nochixtlan. In the three years of Cort\u00e9s expeditions, he had been ruling Tenochtitlan as cuauhtlato. He would not be tlatoani, but he would stayed as cuauhtlato two years more. During his rule, the Aztec titles and decorations were suppressed by the Spanish rulers. In 1530, Motelchiuhtzin went with the Spaniards to an expedition to Teocolhuacan, against the Chichimeca and in Aztatlan was wounded by a Chichimecan arrow while he was bathing, and died of the wound. He left a son called Hernando de Tapia. (Bowditch 1904) identifies this person simply as Motelchiuh, and says he was named for \"his godfather, Don Andr\u00e9s de Tapia Motelchiuh\". This presumably refers to the Spanish conquistador Don Andr\u00e9s de Tapia, and probably should read \"his godfather, Don Andr\u00e9s de Tapia\". ==See also== *List of Tenochtitlan rulers ==References== *Anales de Tlatelolco (1540) ==External links== Category:Tenochca tlatoque Category:16th-century rulers Category:16th-century monarchs in North America Category:16th-century indigenous people of the Americas Category:16th-century Mexican people Category:Year of birth missing Category:1530 deaths ",
