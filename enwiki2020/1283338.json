The Florida Park Service is the division of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection responsible for the operation of Florida State Parks, and won the Gold Medal honoring the best state park system in the country in 1999 and 2005 from the National Recreation and Park Association. They were also finalists in the 1997 and 2011 competitions. The Park Service was awarded the gold medal again in October 2013, making it the only three-time winner.Florida State Parks wins third gold medal in parks and recreation management, WTSP.com, October 10, 2013 In 2019, they received the gold medal award again, resulting in them being the first four-time winner. The parks are open year-round and offer diverse activities beyond fishing, hiking and camping. Many parks offer facilities for birding or horseback riding; there are several battle reenactments; and freshwater springs and beaches are Florida's gems. According to the Florida Park Service website, their goal \"is to help create a sense of place by showing park visitors the best of Florida's diverse natural and cultural sites. Florida's state parks are managed and preserved for enjoyment by this and future generations through providing appropriate resource-based recreational opportunities, interpretation and education that help visitors connect to the Real Florida.\" Several state parks were formerly private tourist attractions purchased by the state of Florida to preserve their natural environment. These parks include the Silver Springs State Park, Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park, Rainbow Springs State Park, and Weeki Wachee Springs. There are state parks in 58 of Florida's 67 counties. Nine of the 175 parks do not have \"State Park\" in their name. Four are \"conservation areas\" (reserve, preserve, or wildlife refuge); three are \"Historical/Archaeological sites\"; one is a fishing pier and one is a recreation area. Seven parks are mostly undeveloped with few or no facilities; 10 parks are accessible only by private boat or ferry; and 13 parks contain National Natural Landmarks. Additionally, there are eleven national parks and service sites in Florida locations under control of the National Park Service. ==Florida state parks and reserves== Note: The table of contents only applies when the list is sorted by park name. *\"Year\" refers to the year the park was opened.
