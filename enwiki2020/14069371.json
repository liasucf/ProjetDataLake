    "text": "Halo are a rock band from Bristol, England, who formed in 1999 and disbanded in 2004. In 2002, they released one album, and had three singles in the UK Singles Chart. They reformed in 2011 and are currently recording their second album. ==History== The band\u2019s journey began in 1999 when brothers Graeme and Iain Moncrieff joined forces with Jim Davey and then Stevie Yeomans. They developed a unique sound consisting of raw energy, soaring guitars, an unswerving rhythm section, epic songs and rich three-part vocal harmony. Halo quickly gained a reputation for their electrifying live shows and soon found themselves on the radar of publishing giants Windswept Pacific, who snapped them up immediately after watching the band perform at The Astoria, London. Shortly afterwards Sony\u2019s S2 label became favourites to sign them and the band promptly put pen to paper with Muff Winwood, head of Sony Europe, to sign a six-album deal. Halo\u2019s first release, the \u2018Still Here\u2019 EP, was recorded in London and given away free to their rapidly expanding fan base with rave reviews. Kerrang urged readers not to \u2018look this gift stallion in the mouth\u2019 and to join Halo\u2019s mailing list pronto. After a string of festivals and a heavy stint on the road touring with Rachel Stamp, The Strokes, Wheatus, The Cooper Temple Clause, Ocean Colour Scene and Pink, Halo teamed up with Stereophonics producer Al Clay at ICP studios in Brussels and recorded their debut album \u2018Lunatic Ride\u2019, released in 2002 The album generated three singles. The first \u2018Cold Light Of Day\u2019 reached 44 in the UK charts, \u2018Never Ending\u2019 went to 56 and \u2018Sanctimonious\u2019 which they re-recorded with legendary producer Gil Norton (Pixies, Foofighters) went to number 41. Mark Radcliffe also made it Radio 1\u2019s record of the week on the Mark and Lard show. After a major shake-up of Sony Music, Halo were released from their contract alongside 40% of the labels roster, including chart giants Reef and Toploader, in 2003. Halo, as a band, ceased soon afterwards. In 2011, the band and their manager met up for a few nostalgic drinks and decided to do a one-off show in their hometown of Bristol. After playing a sell-out show, they decided the band was too good to lay dormant any longer and made the decision to reform. After a number of high-profile gigs, the band have been writing new material and have started recording their long-awaited second album at Distiller Studios, with producer Stew Jackson, due for release in 2014. Halo will be touring and playing festivals in 2014 to promote their second album, due for release in the summer. ==Band members== ===Current line-up=== * Graeme Moncrieff - Vocals, Guitar * Iain Moncrieff - Vocals, Guitar * Stevie Yeomans - Vocals, Bass, Keyboards * Jim Davey - Drums ===Previous members=== * Blake Davies - Drums (2003\u20132004) ==Discography== ===Album=== {| class=wikitable !width=\"150\"| !width=\"230\"| |- || Lunatic Ride (9 September 2002) || #\"Still Here\" #\"Shine\" #\"Cold Light Of Day\" #\"All Or Nothing\" #\"Only For You\" #\"Escape\" #\"Sanctimonious\" #\"Here I Am\" #\"Incinerator\" #\"Feel\" #\"Never Ending\" #\"Vampire Song\" #\"Perfectly Still\" |} ===Singles=== {| class=wikitable !width=\"150\"| !width=\"230\"| !width=\"230\"|UK Singles Chart |- || \"Cold Light of Day\" (4 February 2002) || #\"Cold Light Of Day\" #\"Bedtime\" #\"I Confess\" | #49 |- || \"Sanctimonious\" (20 May 2002) || CD1 #\"Sanctimonious\" #\"Only For You\" #\"Lunatic Ride\" CD2 #\"Sanctimonious\" #\"Angst\" #\"Cracked\" | #44 |- || \"Never Ending\" (26 August 2002) || CD1 #\"Never Ending\" #\"Flatlined\" #The Vampire Song (Acoustic) CD2 #\"Never Ending\" #\"Last Request\" #\"Voice From The Grave\" | #56 |} ===EP=== {| class=wikitable !width=\"150\"| !width=\"230\"| |- || Still Here (2001) || #\"Still Here\" #\"Sanctimonious\" #\"Echoes\" #\"Half Formed Thoughts\" |} ==See also== *List of Peel sessions ==References== Category:Musical groups established in 1999 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2004 Category:English rock music groups Category:English alternative rock groups Category:1999 establishments in England ",
