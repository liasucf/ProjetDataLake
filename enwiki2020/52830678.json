His tenant was Roger Goad.Thorn, Parts 1 & 2, Chapter 48:1 He was also a tenant-in-chief in Warwickshire.Thorn, Part 2, Chapter 48 Nicholas was the king's artilleryman, whose role was \"the captain or officer in charge of the stone and missile discharging engines used in sieges\".Thorn, Part 2, Chapter 48, quoting Ellis, A.S., Biographical Notes on the Yorkshire Tenants Named in Domesday Book, published in Yorkshire Archaeological and Topographical Journal, Vol. IV, 1877, pp.245-6. He was also known as Nicholas de la Pole. At some time between 1095 and 1100 he exchanged his manor of Ailstone in Warwickshire for the manor of Plymtree in Devon, held by St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester. ===Feudal barony of Plympton=== Most of his landholdings later descended to the feudal barony of Plympton. ===Poleyne=== During the reign of King Henry III (1216-1272), Webbery was held by Richard Poleyne. ===de Wibbery=== Pole): Argent, a fess embattled counter-embattled sable between three caterfoils gulesPole, p.508\"Mr Soms. booke\", quoted in Carew's Scroll of Arms, 1588, no.62; \"Hollinshead, 1223\", quoted in Carew's Scroll of Arms, 1588, no.62 Webbery then passed to the de Wibbery family which, as was usual during the reign of King Edward I (1272-1307), adopted its surname from its seat. Simon de Wibbery is recorded as being lord of the manor in 1314.Risdon, p.280, regnal date 8 Edward II It remained the seat of this family for several generations until the male line failed and it passed to the Lippingcott family, by marriage to the heiress Jane Wibbery, daughter of John Wibbery and sister and co-heiress of William Wibbery.Vivian, p.531, pedigree of Lippingcott of Wibbery (also pedigree of 6 generations of Wibbery of Wibbery The arms of Wibbery are uncertain. Pole (d.1635) gives them as: Argent, a fess embattled counter-embattled sable between three caterfoils gules, yet many 19th century sources give them as: A chevron between three mermaids, but without the provision of any evidence to ancient sources, and curiously without mention or discussion of Pole's contradictory blazon. The Wibbery family had become extinct in the male line before the production of the Heraldic Visitations of Devon, and thus the arms are not recorded in that source. The Lippingcott family quartered these mermaid arms,As seen on the Prouse monument in Chagford Church; for discussion of mermaid arms of Gough/Wibbery see: Devon & Cornwall Notes & Queries, Vol.IX, 1916-17, pp.81-97 \"Prowse Shield of Arms in Chagford Church\" See image :File:St Michael's Church, Chagford (6193).jpg which the above sources identify as the arms of Wibbery, yet other sources, including Carew in his Scroll of Arms (1588), state the mermaid arms quartered by Lippingcott to be the arms of Gough of Cornwall (alias Goff, Goffe, etc), an heiress of which family the Lippincotts married and whose arms they were thus entitled to quarter. (Phillip Lippingcott (d.1567) great-grandson of the heiress Jane Wibbery, married Alice Gough, a daughter and co-heiress of Richard Gough of \"Kilkham in Cornwall\" (Vivian, p.531)) (Gough of \"Kilkeham\" (Kilkhampton?) in Cornwall, per Joseph Hollands Collection of Arms, 1579, quoted in Carew's Scroll of Arms, 1588, no.62.Sir George Carew's Scroll of Arms, 1588, With Additions from Joseph Holland's Collection of Arms, 1579, published in Devon Notes and Queries, Vol.I, Part II, January 1900-October 1901 ===Lippingcott=== Luppincott in 2008 Arms of Lippingcott: Per fess embattled gules and sable, three leopards (cats) passant argentVivian, p.531, pedigree of \"Lippingcott of Wibbery\" John Lippingcott of Lippingcott (now \"Luppincott\"), in the parish of Alverdiscott, married Jane Wibbery, the heiress of Webbery, and the Lippingcott family moved its residence to Webbery from Lippingcott.The Lippincotts in England and America, Edited from the Genealogical Papers of the Late James S. Lippincott, Philadelphia, 1909, p.8Lysons & Lysons, Magna Britannia, Vol.6, Devon, London, 1822, p.323, \"Luffincott/Luffingcott\" The Lippingcott family is believed to have originated either at a manor named \"Lovacott\" or \"Luffincott\", of which a range of possible locations exists, and of which their surname is a corruption. A possibility is \"Lovacott\" in the parish of Shebbear in the hundred of Shebbear, listed in the Domesday Book as LOVECOTE, the 17th of the 31 Devonshire manors of Roald Dubbed held in chief from King William the Conqueror.Thorn, Chapter 35:17 An alternative origin of the family is the manor and the present parish of \"Luffincott\",James S. LippincottThorn & Thorn assume today's \"Luffincott\" to have been part of the DB manor of \"Tamerlande\" (Thorn, 35:5). See: Pole, p.351, \"Luffencot\" in the Hundred of Black Torrington. See also: Lysons & Lysons, Magna Britannia, Vol.6, Devon, London, 1822, p.323, Luffincott/Luffingcott not mentioned in the Domesday Book, which has its own church of St James. This is situated in the Hundred of Black Torrington, and is not identical to the DB LOVECOTE in Shebbear. A further estate named \"Lovacott\", is situated in the parish of Alverdiscott only 1 1/2 miles north-east of Webbery. The Lippingcott family still held Webbery in the early 17th century, when Risdon (d.1640) wrote his work the Survey of Devon. A member of the Lippingcott family was an early settler in the American Colonies, and his descendants are fairly frequent visitors to Webbery today.\"Webbery: Upmarket holiday cottage lets in Devon\".
