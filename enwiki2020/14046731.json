    "text": "Christianity has been in Hong Kong since 1841.Hong Kong Year Book (2019): Chapter 21 \u2013 Religion and Custom As of 2019, there were about 1.2 million Christians in Hong Kong (16% of the total population), most of them are Protestant (around 800,000) and Catholic (around 403,000). ==Roman Catholic Church== Trappist Haven Monastery The Roman Catholic Church in Hong Kong was established as a Mission Prefecture in 1841 and as an Apostolic Vicariate in 1874. It became a diocese in 1946. About 403,000 Hongkongers (or Hongkongese) are Catholics.They are served by 285 priests, 68 brothers and 541 sisters. There are 52 parishes, comprising 40 churches, 30 chapels and 27 halls for religious service. Services are conducted in Cantonese, with three-fifths of the parishes providing services in English and in Tagalog in some cases. The diocese has established its own administrative structure while maintaining close links with the Pope and other Catholic communities around the world. It has the same creed, Scripture, liturgy and organisation as the other culture communities worldwide. The assistant secretary-general of the Federation of Asian Bishops' Conference has his office in Hong Kong. Along with its apostolic work, one of the prime concerns of the diocese has been for the well-being of all the Hongkongers. To reach people through the media, the diocese publishes two weekly newspapers, Kung Kao Po and Sunday Examiner. In addition, the Diocesan Audio-Visual Centre produces tapes and films for use in schools and parishes and, overall, the Hong Kong Catholic Social Communications Office acts as an information and public relations channel for the diocese.Hong Kong Year Book (2010): Chapter 18 \u2013 Religion and Custom ==Protestantism== A chapel of the Church of Christ in China in Bonham Road. The Protestant churches in Hong Kong have about 800,000 registered members. The presence of the Protestant community dates back to 1841. \"Great Light Newspaper\" (\u5927\u5149\u5831), a Christian newspaper based in Hong Kong and distributed in Hong Kong and China, was in operation in the early 1900s, with Dr. Man-Kai Wan, \u5c39\u6587\u968e (1869\u20131927) as its chairman of the board and Dr. Sun Yat-sen (a secondary school classmate of Dr. Wan) as its contributor.http://cnac.org/rebeccachan01.htm To Tsai Church (\u9053\u6fdf\u6703\u5802), founded by the London Missionary Society in 1888 and located at 75 Hollywood Road, Mid-levels (\u534a\u5c71\u5340), Hong Kong, was Sun's place of worship while he studied Medicine in the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese (\u9999\u6e2f\u83ef\u4eba\u897f\u91ab\u66f8\u9662). According to Wong Man-kong, To Tsai Church was one of the first independent churches in China. Fung-Chi Au (\u5340\u9cf3\u5880, 1847-1914), who was Sun's teacher of Chinese literature, was an Elder of To Tsai Church. Due to its growth, this church erected a large building in 1926 and was renamed Hop Yat Church (\u5408\u4e00\u5802).Rebecca Chan Chung, Deborah Chung and Cecilia Ng Wong, \"Piloted to Serve\", 2012https://www.facebook.com/PilotedToServe Chinese Methodist Church (\u5faa\u9053\u885b\u7406\u806f\u5408\u6559\u6703) started in 1882 at Wellington Street, Hong Kong. Upon expansion, it moved to Aberdeen Street and then Caine Road. In 1936, it moved to a new building at 36 Hennessy Road, Hong Kong. In 1998, this building was replaced by a 23-story building. In addition, the church has started numerous branch churches and schools all over Hong Kong.http://www.methodist.org.hk/ About 800,000 Protestant Christians live in Hong Kong. The Protestant Church is made up of over 1,300 congregations in more than 50 denominations. Major denominations are Anglicans, Baptists, Lutherans, Adventists, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Church of Christ in China, Methodist, Pentecostal and Salvation Army. With their emphasis on youth work, many congregations have a high proportion of young people. Two weekly newspapers are published, The Christian Weekly and The Christian Times. Two ecumenical bodies facilitate co- operative work among the Protestant churches in Hong Kong. The older one, dating from 1915, is the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union. The second co-operative body is the Hong Kong Christian Council, formed in 1954. Major mainline denominations and ecumenical services constitute the membership core of the council, which is committed to building closer relationships among all churches in Hong Kong as well as with churches overseas, and to stimulating local Christians to play an active part in the development of Hong Kong society. The Chairman of the Council, the Rt Revd Thomas Soo, represents the Protestant community in the six religions' meetings. ===Gallery=== Image:CrownOfThornsChurch_03.jpg|Crown of Thorns' Church Image:HK_SKH_HolyTrinityChurch.JPG|Holy Trinity Cathedral, Kowloon City Image:Lutheran Theological Seminary Interior.jpg| Chinese architecture in the Lutheran Theological Seminary Image:HK_TST_St_Andrew_s_Church_1.jpg|St. Andrew's Church (Kowloon) Image:Hongkongskhsjc.jpg|St. John's Cathedral, Hong Kong ==Orthodox Church== Russian Orthodox Church of Saint Apostles Peter and Paul in Hong Kong In 1933, the head of the Russian Orthodox Mission in China, Bishop Victor (Svyatin) sent Priest Dmitry Uspensky, who served in Beijing, to Hong Kong, where many Eastern Orthodox emigrants from Russia moved since the Revolution in 1917. He organised a parish in Hong Kong and served there until his death in 1969. In 1945, the parish was visited by Russian Orthodox Bishop John (Maximovich) of Shanghai, and in 1968 by Russian Orthodox Bishop (Poyarkov) of Zaraisk. The parish was officially reestablished in 2008.Russian Orthodoxy in Hong Kong In November 1996, Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia () was set up by the decision of the Holy Great Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.Official statement of the Church of Constantinople concerning the establishment of the new \"diocese\" in Asia ==Mormonism (LDS Church)== Hong Kong China Temple The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has more than 23,000 practitioners in Hong Kong divided into 36 congregations, doubling the number of members from 10 years earlier.LDS Newsroom The LDS Church first sent missionaries to Hong Kong in 1853 but did not establish a headquarters until 1949.

For example, hospitals and clinics, creches, homes for the aged and blind girls. Starting from 1960s, the Catholics tried to provide services in more areas such as orphanages, noodle units, bakeries, milk conversion units, women rehabilitation institutes and vocational & trade training courses. In the 1970s, the Catholic Diocesan started to focus on specific areas and terminated some of the factory units. In 2018, the Catholics were still providing services in medical aspect, nurseries & child care centers, elderly & youth services and Caritas social family services center.Hong Kong Catholic Diocesan Archives, Catholic Statistics in Hong Kong In the Catholic community, Caritas is the official social welfare arm of the Church in Hong Kong. These services are open to all people. Indeed, 95 per cent of those who have benefited from the wide range of services provided by the diocese are not Catholics. \"The Catholic French Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres\" was one of the first orphanage and elderly home was established in 1848. In protestant communities, Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui has been responsive to social needs, by providing a wide array of social services, aiming at achieving a fair, just and loving society. At present, many social service organisations and social service models in Hong Kong were those initiated and promoted by the Church. Services provided by the Church are multi-faceted, including services for family and child-care, children and youth, the elderly, rehabilitation service, community development service and other supportive services. There are more than 230 units providing social service run by Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui at present. ===Education=== Prior to 1841, the territory known today as Hong Kong had been an extension of Imperial China for many centuries. The changes would come with the arrival of the British colonialisation in 1841. At first Hong Kong's education came from Protestant and Catholic missionaries who provided social services. Italian missionaries began to provide boy-only education to British and Chinese youth in 1843.Bray, Mark. Koo, Ramsey. [2005] (2005) Education and Society in Hong Kong and Macao: Comparative Perspectives on Continuity and Change. Hong Kong: Springer Press.

The nucleus of the school would later create the foundation for the new and renamed Hong Kong University in 1910.The University of Hong Kong. [2003] (2003). Growing with Hong Kong: The University and its Graduates, the first 90 years. There were three post-secondary institutions (The Chung Chi College of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Baptist University and Lingnan University) ran by the Protestant community in Hong Kong. In addition, they operate 16 theological seminaries and Bible institutes, 16 Christian publishing houses and 57 Christian bookshops. Caritas Francis Hsu College is a self-financing degree-granting institution, which was established by Caritas Hong Kong. ====Kindergarten, primary and secondary schools==== In education, there are 320 Catholic schools and kindergartens which have about 286,000 pupils.

The Protestant churches run 144 secondary schools, 192 primary schools, 273 kindergartens and 116 nurseries in which 33 secondary schools and more than 50 primary schools are established by the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui. It is notable that many schools run by the Church has been getting outstanding results in Public Examinations, such as Diocesan Boys' School, Diocesan Girls' School and St. Paul's Co-educational College. ===Medical services=== The Protestant community in Hong Kong runs seven hospitals.

Some of these hospitals have served Hong Kong for a long period of time. Tsan Yuk Hospital was set up by London Missionary Society in 1922 and become a government hospital in 1934.Tsan Yuk HospitalHong Kong Adventist HospitalHong Kong Adventist Hospital and Tsuen Wan Adventist Hospital are other Christian-based hospitals. Six hospitals are managed by the Catholic community in Hong Kong.

The injuries of the Eastern District shared 40% of the death of the Hong Kong Island's injuries who was reaching the hospitals by ambulance, according to a report by a Christian- based charity organisation. In August 1982, several churches in the District formed an organisation to force the then Colonial Government to establish a hospital, leading to the establishment of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital. The organisation also urged the Government to improve the medical service provided in the District.A Carnival of Gods: Studies of Religions in Hong Kong.(2002).

The two adjoining schools, namely, But San School and Hoh Fuk Tong College, were also proposed to be demolished in the redevelopment scheme.Press Release:AMO obtains support to preserve historical buildings in Hoh Fok Tong Centre To protect the historic building from demolition, Morrison House was declared as proposed Monument on 11 April 2003;Press Release: Morrison Building in Hoh Fuk Tong Centre Declared Proposed Monument it was later declared as monument on 26 March 2004.The Morrison Building in Hoh Fuk Tong Centre ;Kom Tong Hall In 1960, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints purchased the building. The Church used the Hall for worship services and other local Church activities as well as for administration of its Asia-area humanitarian, building and other programs. As a result of Church growth, locally and throughout Asia over the last four decades, the Church's headquarters were moved out of Kom Tong Hall and into a much larger new 14-story building in Wan Chai, Hong Kong. The Church no longer had need for the building and was looking to sell the property. It soon became apparent that a vacant lot would yield a far higher amount than if the property were sold intact, and the Church considered demolishing the building. In October 2002, the Church actually submitted an application for a demolition permit to the Building Authority. However, after hearing concerns raised by friends in the community, and a series of negotiations with the Hong Kong Government, Church officials reached a consensus in selling the property intact and preserving the building. ===School-based management reform=== The Education (Amendment) Bill 2002, which was to introduce the school-based management (SBM) governance framework to all aided schools in the city,LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL BRIEF: Education Ordinance(Chapter 279)- EDUCATION (AMENDMENT) BILL 2002 was introduced in November 2002 and passed in July 2004.Bills Committee on Education (Amendment) Bill 2002 The Hong Kong Catholic Diocese, as one of the major schools sponsoring bodies, worried that the Diocese may not run schools according to its vision and mission as representatives of parents, teachers and principals are allowed to sit in the School Management Committee (SMC), causing the politicised atmosphere in SMC.Bishop Zen: 2003/10/5 \u2013 Can we still run schools according to the vision and mission of Catholic education? Bishop Zen published his articles to express his opinions on the Bill.Bishop Zen's stand on the issue of School-based Management He had previously said that \"we will reconsider our commitment to education\" if the Bill had been passed, leading to the worries of the parents and teachers; later he clarified that it didn't mean that the Hong Kong Catholic Diocese would stop running the Catholic school after the Bill had been passed.Bishop Zen: 2004/4/25 Bishop Zen further clarifies diocese's stand on proposed education bill and convenes forums for discussion ==2014 Hong Kong protests== Many of the participants and leaders of the 2014 Hong Kong protests (i.e. Umbrella movement) are Christians, despite many of the government officials and members of the Pro- Beijing camp which opposed the movement. Joshua Wong, the founder of Scholarism, is an Evangelical Christian who has cited his faith as a motivation for his leadership. Two of the three leaders of Occupy Central, another group supporting the protests, are also Christians. One of their motivations is distrust of the treatment of Christians by the Chinese government. They view democracy as a defence against government control. Different denominations, however, are split in their support or opposition to the protests. The Methodist Church of Hong Kong has been openly supportive of the protesters (while did not take any official stances). The Anglican Church in Hong Kong, on the other hand, has encouraged members to stay out of the protests and church leaders opposed the movement. The protesters themselves made a makeshift Christian chapel in the Mong Kok occupation region. The chapel was destroyed when police cleared the area. Protesters rebuilt it the next day.Shai Oster, \"How Smashed Jesus Shrine Reveals Christian Undercurrent to Hong Kong Protests\" Bloomberg, 28 October 2014 Matthew Bell \"Christian take a prominent role in Hong Kong Protests\", PRI's The World, 6 October 2014Ned Levin, \"Hong Kong Democracy Protests Carry a Christian Mission for Some\", The Wall Street Journal, 3 October 2014 Frank Langfitt, \"A Surprising Tie That Binds Hong Kong's Protest Leaders: Faith\", NPR, 9 October 2014.Political cartoon by Kong Chi Lo showing Jesus and Guan Yu holding yellow umbrellas and walking among protesters, China Digital Times, 14 October 2014 ==Christianity among Hong Kong Universities students== According to the Hong Kong University Grant Committee statistics, as of school year 2011/2012, about one quarter (24.6%) of university students were Christian (21.1% Protestant Christian and 3.5% are Catholic) .
