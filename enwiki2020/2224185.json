    "text": "The Balete people, traditionally called the Bamalete, or baMalete, are a Southern African ethnic group. In Botswana they have occupied a permanent territory since around 1780, officially recognized as a tribal reserve in 1909. They are the only one of eight major tribes that do not belong to the related Tswana people. They still have a traditional Paramount Chief, or Kg\u00f4sikgolo. Balete are settled in Southern Botswana villages that include Ramotswa, Gabane, Otse, Metsimotlhabe and Mogobane. ==List of chiefs== Phatl\u00ea (Wa ko Tlh\u00f4g\u00f4 ya Tlou)Ditirafalo tsa merafe ya Batswana Malete Maphalaol\u00ea Mongatane Maio Kgomo Mokgw\u00ea Marum\u00f4 P\u00f4w\u00ea I a Marumo 1805 Mokg\u00f4jwe a P\u00f4w\u00ea (acting) 1805\u20131830 P\u00f4w\u00ea II a Mokg\u00f4jwe (died c. 1830) 1830\u20131886 Mokg\u00f4si I a P\u00f4w\u00ea 1886\u20131896 Ikaneng a Mokg\u00f4si 1896\u20131906 Mokg\u00f4si II 1906\u20131917 Baitlotle (acting) 1917\u20131937 Seboko I a Mokg\u00f4si 1937\u20131945 Ketswerebothata a Mokg\u00f4si (acting) 1945\u20131966 Mokg\u00f4si III a Seboko 1966\u20131996 Kelemogile a Seboko (Kelemogile Mokgosi) acting 1996\u20132001 Seboko II a Mokg\u00f4si 2001\u20132002 Tumelo a Seboko (acting) 2002 - present Mosadi Seboko ==Leboko la Balete (The Balete Poem)== September 1, 2012 saw the beginning of a new era for the Balete tribe, as it revived its dormant tradition of male initiation, Bogwera, under the guidance of its first ever female Paramount Chief Mosadi Seboko. Among initiates were five councilors from the South East District Council \u2013 two from the Botswana Congress Party, another two from the ruling Botswana Democratic party and one from the Botswana Movement for Democracy. The naming of the new regiment \u2018Matsosa ngwao\u2019 (Cultural revivers) by Kgosi Seboko coincided with the annual national cultural day celebrations. The event attracted members of the diplomatic corps from Mozambique, Nigeria, the United States of America, the UK and, perhaps more important in an African than other context, the Chinese Women's Association. ==Sources and references== World Statesmen website on political and administrative entities ==References== Category:Sotho-Tswana peoples in South Africa ",
