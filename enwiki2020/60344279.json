Igharas uses Potlatch methodology in making art, to assert the relationships between bodies and the world, and to challenge colonial systems of value and measurement of land and resources. == Early life and education == Igharas was raised in Smithers, BC, on T\u0101\u0142t\u0101n territory. Igharas earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Emily Carr University of Art and Design in 2011, and went on to receive an Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s in Art, Media, and Design from OCAD University in 2016, receiving the OCADU President\u2019s Scholarship. For her graduate thesis, Igharas presented LAND | MINE, a materials library which linked bodies and mining sites to the land. In 2005 to 2006, Igharas also attended the Kitinmaax School for Northwest Coast Indian Art at \u2018Ksan in Hazelton, BC, which influenced her current Potlatch methodology. == Art == Igharas\u2019 practice can be understood through the methodology of Potlatch, a ceremony rooted in reciprocity and nation building. For Igharas, artmaking becomes a \u201cceremony that affirms and solidifies relationships to every thing and body\u201d. Her conceptual artwork primarily tackles colonial systems of valuing land and resources, and Western measurements of wealth, and examines the way these systems historically and continue to impact Indigenous lands and cultural practices. Igharas' practice is influenced by Indigenous resistance strategies, familial and embodied knowledge, and acts of decolonization, in order to understand the Canadian imaginary and the impacts of its industrialization; Igharas also aligns with Indigenous Futurisms as a way of understanding our relationship with time and the land. In the exhibition future generations at Artspace, Toronto, Igharas examined Indigenous futurity as a means of survival and survivance. Through working with her understandings of T\u0101\u0142t\u0101n traditions, and objects and materials rooted in Western settler culture, Igharas presented strategies and gestures of resistance against neo- colonization, and imagined futures of Indigenous peoples. The series and workshop Riot Rock Rattles at the Gardiner Museum, Toronto, continues Igharas\u2019 examination of the material relationships between the body and the land. In the workshop, participants build and engage with Igharas\u2019 \u201criot rocks\u201d - rocks imbued with materials of cultural, industrial, and resistive significance - in order to communally practice Indigenous methodologies and gain an awareness of the connections between body and land. == Selected exhibitions == Igharas has exhibited across Canada and internationally, in places such as Chiapas, Mexico; Asheville, USA; and Santiago, Chile. Notable exhibitions include Interweavings, which featured emerging First Nations artists who had won the YVR Art Foundation scholarship; the Contemporary Native Art Biennial: Culture Shift in Montreal; and the Luminato Festival in Toronto. Igharas is also a member and representative of ReMatriate Collective. === Solo exhibitions === * 2008 Originated, Aboriginal Student Exhibit, Concourse Gallery, Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Vancouver BC * 2009 Internal | External, Aboriginal Student Exhibition, Concourse Gallery, Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Vancouver BC * 2010 Bloodlines, Aboriginal Student Exhibition, Curator, Concourse Gallery, Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Vancouver, BC * 2010 In order to contemplate the making for the live biennale, Performance, White Chapel Gallery, Vancouver BC * 2011 Grand Entry, Aboriginal Student Exhibition, Concourse Gallery, Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Vancouver BC * 2011 Please Do Not Touch, Ceramic Exhibition, Concourse Gallery, Emily Carr University of Art and Design, Vancouver, BC * 2011 Petroglyphs, Performance, Satellite Gallery, Vancouver BC * 2015 Where are you (really) from?, Nuit Blanche, Toronto ON * 2016 Post-Performance / Discussion- Action by Maria Hupfield, \u201cTypist\u201d (Performance Assistant), MONOMYTHS Progress Festival and FADO * 2016 Hearings.
