Paggett's underwaters was intended to be \"immersive\" and involved Paggett interacting with the space as four different characters during a period of five days. Each of Paggett's characters had demographic differences; the details of these differences were not shared with viewers. Paggett transitioned into the characters in front of viewers and let each persona speak for themselves, with Paggett remaining silent. Ultimately, Paggett aimed to create a space that was not confined by space and time and could engage both with viewers present and with \"spirits and other nonpresent entities\" Paggett has performed in multiple companies and group projects. As a dancer, Paggett has worked with David Rouss\u00e8ve/Reality, Meg Wolfe, Stanley Love Performance Group, Fiona Dolenga-Marcotty, Vic Marks, Cid Pearlman, Cheng-Chieh Yu, Baker-Tarpaga Projects, Rebecca Alson-Milkman, Kelly Nipper, and Ultra-red.
