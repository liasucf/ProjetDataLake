    "text": "XHCD-FM is a community radio station in Hermosillo, broadcasting on 95.5 FM. The permit for the station is held by Comunicadores del Desierto, A.C., and the station is known as Zoom 95. XHCD is a member of AMARC M\u00e9xico. ==History== \"Radio Bemba\" took to the air on November 11, 2000, as a non-permitted station on 107.5 MHz, from facilities near the Universidad de Sonora where the station's founders were students. A year later, in 2001, a permit 107.5 FM was awarded to the university. While it was thought that this might help to regularize Radio Bemba's transmissions, the university launched XHUSH-FM, its own station, on the frequency instead. Radio Bemba moved to 103.3 MHz. In September 2004, the Radio Bemba team began negotiating to obtain a permit for its radio station. On May 31, 2005, Comunicadores del Desierto, A.C., received the permit for XHCD-FM on 95.5 MHz. The station changed its name to Zoom 95 sometime in the early 2010s. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Sonora Category:Community radio stations in Mexico ",
