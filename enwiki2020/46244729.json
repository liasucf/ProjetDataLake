Neither, for that matter, is the picture. Come right down to it, it's quite unsatisfactory.\" Later critics also had reservations about the film, as being a lesser version of the prize-winning book: \"Unfortunately, the film producers, modeling the Eberhart mystery film versions on others of the day, sought to extend humorous quips between characters and eliminate significant elements of the plot that involved clues, no doubt in hopes of attracting a broader audience.\"Rick Cypert, James G.
