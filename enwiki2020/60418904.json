The first king of the kingdom was Achaemenes, who was the forefather of the Achamenids, and also gave his name to the dynasty. The Achaemenid kingdom was the ruling kingdom of Persia (a region in south-western Iran) and Anshan (also in south-western Iran). According to the Achaemenid tradition, Achaemenes was succeeded by Teispes, who divided his kingdom between his sons, Ariaramnes and Cyrus I. == History == It is not known if the first member of the dynasty, Achaemenes, was a mythical figure or an actual king. But historical or mythical, he was known to the later Achaemenids as the father of Teispes. Apparently, the Achaemenid kingdom was divided by Teispes between his sons, Ariaramnes and Cyrus I. From then on, the dynasty had two branches, while the Ariaramnids were kings of Pars (Persis or Persia, a province in south of Iran), the Cyrusids were kings of Anshan. Cambyses I, son of Cyrus I and father of Cyrus II, reigned under the overlordship of Astyages, King of Media and married Mandane, daughter of the Great King. But soon Cambyses rebelled against Astyages. While Cambyses was killed in the rebellion, his son, Cyrus the Great, successfully conquered the realm of his grandfather and started the Achaemenid Empire. == Rulers == In his cylinder, Cyrus the Great introduced himself as a descendant of Teispes. However, there is no mention of Achaemenes: In the Behistun Inscription, Darius the Great said Achaemenes was the father of Teispes: According to Darius, there were eight Achaemenid kings before him: The genealogy of the Achaemenids is also reported by Herodotus. According to him, Darius, Hystaspes, Arsames, Ariaramnes and Teispes were the Achaemenid kings of Darius's branch, while Cyrus [II], Cambyses [I], Teispes and Achaemenes were kings of the other branch. Plato also describes Achaemenes as son of the Greek god, Perseus, son of Zeus. === Achaemenid kings of Anshan === {| class=\"wikitable\" ! width=\"80pt\" |Portrait ! width=\"100pt\" |Name ! width=\"200pt\" |Family relations ! width=\"65pt\" |Reign ! width=\"250pt\" |Notes |- ! colspan=\"5\" |Achaemenid dynasty (~705\u2013559 BC) |- | |Achaemenes | |~705 BC |First ruler of the Achaemenid kingdom |- title=\" == References == Category:Achaemenid Empire Category:Ancient Persia Category:Iranian empires Category:Monarchy in Persia and Iran Category:History of Iran Category:Iranian kingdoms ",
