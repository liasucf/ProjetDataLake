The mountains contain the Phoenix Mountain Preserve which includes the Dreamy Draw Recreation Area, Lookout Mountain Preserve, North Mountain Preserve and Piestewa Mountain Park. The Dreamy Draw Recreation Area is located in the pass between the Stoney/Echo mountain ridge and Piestewa Peak known as Dreamy Draw. The name originated from the neurological effects suffered by miners who worked the area's cinnabar (mercury sulfide) mine.Richard Nilsen, \"Lore of Dreamy Draw: Mad Men, Green Men and Lots of Great Hikes\", Arizona Republic, December 19, 2008 There is a flood prevention dam in the Dreamy Draw area. ==Trails== ===Charles M.
