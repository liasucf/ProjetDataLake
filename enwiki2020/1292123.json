Retrieved on December 22, 2009. ==Other music== ===Indigenous music=== ===Portuguese music=== Due to the large population of Portuguese immigrants in Southern New England, Portuguese traditional music is played in small communities. Usually Roman Catholic churches are the center of the communities activities, where music is played. Fado is a form of music characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor, and infused with a characteristic sentiment of resignation, fatefulness and melancholia (loosely captured by the word saudade, or \"longing\"). Fado performers play at local venues throughout Rhode Island and Southern Massachusetts. The Azores is the major heritage of many Portuguese-Americans. In Rhode Island, most Portuguese traditional music is played by Azorean people. Azoreans maintain some distinct musical traditions, such as the traditionally fiddle-driven chamarrita dance. This dance and music is played mainly at weddings and Church festivals. Azorean-Portuguese sensation Jorge Ferreira is a popular musician throughout New England, singing at many festivals and events. ===Cape Verdean music=== Of special importance is the music of the large Cape Verdean population. Though Cape Verdean music is largely unknown outside of the expatriate community, Rhode Island is the acknowledged center for Cape Verdean morna and other styles in the United States.M\u00e1ximo and Peterson, pgs. 448-457 ==Music festivals== ===Newport Jazz Festival=== The Newport Jazz Festival began in 1954 by George Wein and has been documented on recordings by Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington, Muddy Waters, Nina Simone, Ray Charles, John Coltrane and Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday.
