Typically, this information consists of births, deaths, baptisms, confirmations and marriages. Other items, such as letters, newspaper cuttings and photographs, might also be placed inside a Family Bible. In the United Kingdom, they were common in the Victorian period, and are also found in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. They are often used as sources for genealogical research. ==Gallery== File:The Wilson Family Bible (4379704462).jpg|Family bible of Woodrow Wilson File:Family-bible.jpg|A family Bible File:Bird family birth registry.jpg|Birth record File:Oscar Arthur Moritz Lindauer (1815-1866) death recorded in the Lindauer - Ensko family bible.jpg|Death record File:Bible-open.jpg|Family Bible open to the book of Psalms ==References== * George G.
