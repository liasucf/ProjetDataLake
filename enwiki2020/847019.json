Cova got his first fame at the 1982 European Championships in Athens, where he surprisingly outsprinted the main favourite Werner Schildhauer from East Germany, to win his first international championship title. In the next year, Cova wasn't the main favourite at the first World Championships held in Helsinki, being considered only as a possible medal winner. The 10,000 m final at Helsinki was run in slow pace, with thirteen runners still in a leading pack at the bell. With only 30 metres to go, Cova was only in fifth place, but then sprinted forward to win. Schildhauer finished in second place. The top four runners sprinted to the finish line in 0.33 seconds (see Yleisurheilun MM-kisat Helsingiss\u00e4 / Athletics World Championships in Helsinki, edited by the Juoksija/Runner magazine, Helsinki: 1983). The 10,000 m final at the Los Angeles Olympics began at an even slower pace than at Helsinki. At the 6 km mark, Martti Vainio from Finland, picked up the speed. Cova managed to follow him, and Vainio couldn't sustain his own pace, so Cova swept past him after the bell and sprinted to the line to win his last international title (see, for example, Tapio Pekola et al., eds., Suuri Suomalainen Olympiakirja/The Great Finnish Olympic Book, Helsinki: Juoksija-lehti (Runner magazine)/Laaseri, 1984). At the 1986 European Championships in Stuttgart, Cova was beaten at his own game, when he was outsprinted by fellow countryman Stefano Mei on the last lap of the 10,000 m final. Cova never won a major race after that, and came tenth in his heat (thereby failing to qualify for the final) at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. This was his last international competition. In the 1983 World Athletics Championships 10,000-metre final, there actually were seven men in the lead group at the bell (see the related video clip \"Finns Near the Top\" / Suomalaisia l\u00e4hell\u00e4 huippua in the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation YLE's Living Archives / El\u00e4v\u00e4 arkisto, with the following links: Sports / Urheilu, Athletics / Yleisurheilu, World Championships / MM-kisat, 1983 World Championships / MM-kisat 1983; the website is www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/). In the 1984 Olympics 10,000-metre final, Finland's Martti Vainio picked up the speed shortly before the 6 kilometre mark (see, for instance, The Great Olympic Book / Suuri Olympiateos, volume 4, published in Finland in 1984). ==Achievements== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=60% style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\" |- !Year !!Competition !!Venue !!Position !!Event !!Time !!Notes |- |1981 |align=left|European Cup (Super League) |align=left| Zagreb |6th |5000 m |13:45.48 | |- |rowspan=3|1982 |align=left|European Indoor Championships |align=left| Milan |bgcolor=silver|2nd |3000 m |7:54.12 | |- |align=left rowspan=2|European Championships |align=left rowspan=2| Athens | |5000 m |No time | |- |bgcolor=gold|1st |10,000 m |27:41.03 | |- |rowspan=3|1983 |align=left|World Championships |align=left| Helsinki |bgcolor=gold|1st |10,000 m |28:01.04 | |- |align=left rowspan=2|European Cup (Super League) |align=left rowspan=2| London |bgcolor=cc9966|3rd |5000 m |13:55.59 | |- |bgcolor=silver|2nd |10,000 m |28:02.13 | |- |1984 |align=left|Olympic Games |align=left| Los Angeles |bgcolor=gold|1st |10,000 m |27:47.54 | |- |rowspan=2|1985 |align=left rowspan=2|European Cup (Super League) |align=left rowspan=2| Moscow |bgcolor=gold|1st |5000 m |14:05.45 | |- |bgcolor=gold|1st |10,000 m |28:51.46 | |- |rowspan=2|1986 |align=left rowspan=2|European Championships |align=left rowspan=2| Stuttgart |8th |5000 m |13:35,86 | |- |bgcolor=silver|2nd |10,000 m |27:57.93 | |- |1988 |align=left|Olympic Games |align=left| Seoul | |10,000 m |28:43.84 | |} ==National titles== He won fourteen national championships at senior level. *Italian Athletics Championships **5000 m: 1980, 1982, 1983, 1985 (4) **10,000 m: 1981, 1982 (2) *Italian Athletics Indoor Championships **3000 m: 1982, 1983, 1984 (3) *Italian Cross Country Championships **Long race: 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986 (5) ==See also== * FIDAL Hall of Fame * Italy national athletics team - Multiple medalist * Italian all-time lists - 5000 metres * Italian all-time lists - 10000 metres ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * Alberto Cova at FIDAL * * * Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:People from the Province of Como Category:Olympic athletes of Italy Category:Olympic gold medalists for Italy Category:Italian male cross country runners Category:Italian male long- distance runners Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for Italy Category:World Athletics Championships medalists Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:European athletics champions for Italy Category:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Mediterranean Games gold medalists for Italy Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1983 Mediterranean Games Category:Mediterranean Games medalists in athletics Category:World Athletics Championships winners ",
