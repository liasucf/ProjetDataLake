Karger and Californians Against Hate have waged four boycotts of companies whose families gave large contributions to qualify and pass Proposition 8: *Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel: San Diego developer Doug Manchester donated $125,000 to Proposition 8. Manchester owns the Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel, Southern California's largest hotel. Karger initiated a boycott of the Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel in July 2008, garnering the support of local gay organizations and UNITE HERE Local 30, the hotel workers. Hotel Marketing Director Kelly Commerford confirmed that cancellations resulting directly from the boycott had cost the hotel $7 million just in the first 8 months. Californians Against Hate estimates that the boycott continues to cost the hotel $1 million a month. *A-1 Self Storage: Terry Caster owns A-1 Self Storage; he and his family donated a total of $693,000 to Proposition 8. Caster also claims that gay marriage would create a \"sick society.\" Californians Against Hate called a boycott of A-1 Self Storage effective November 20, 2008. *Bolthouse Farms: William Bolthouse gave $100,000 to Proposition 8, so Karger and Californians Against Hate began the boycott of the company he founded, Bolthouse Farms.

He has picketed LDS stores and bookstores. Previously, Karger also filed a formal complaint with the California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) against the LDS Church, accusing the church of hiding the extent of its financial involvement supporting Proposition 8. Karger noticed discrepancies between the $2,078 worth of non-monetary contributions that the LDS Church had reported and all the activities that the church had undertaken to pass Proposition 8. Roman Porter, the executive director of the FPPC, announced a full investigation later that month. The investigation examined the church's involvement in providing phone banks, a website and commercials for Proposition 8, ultimately finding the church guilty of 13 violations, which the LDS Church settled by paying a fine. In early 2017 he spearheaded the organization Mormon Tips for evidence against the LDS Church in order to file a complaint with the IRS which could revoke their tax-exempt status.Thank God I'm Atheist, episode #267 | Tax Exempt | released 01/09/2017 ==== Complaint against National Organization for Marriage ==== In October 2009, Karger and Californians Against Hate filed a formal ethics complaint with the state of Maine against the National Organization for Marriage (NOM), regarding political donor reporting.

Maine law requires a disclosure report from any organizations that raises more than $5,000 for a ballot question campaign. NOM had contributed $1.6 million to Stand For Marriage Maine, as of October 23, 2009, without revealing its donors' names. Karger has repeatedly called for a Congressional Investigation of the National Organization for Marriage due to its late and non-reporting of its federal 990 income tax returns. === Tobacco advocacy === In the 1990s Karger worked for the tobacco industry to prevent smoking bans in California. === Orange juice boycott === Karger encouraged Republicans to boycott Florida orange juice in protest of the Florida Republican Party's decision to reschedule its primary to January, which upsets the normal primary calendar. ==See also== *LGBT rights in the United States *List of LGBT rights organizations ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:American political consultants Category:California Republicans Category:Critics of Mormonism Category:Gay politicians Category:LGBT businesspeople from the United States Category:LGBT Jews Category:LGBT politicians from the United States Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:American nonprofit executives Category:Candidates in the 2012 United States presidential election Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Jewish American candidates for President of the United States Category:People from Glencoe, Illinois Category:LGBT people from California Category:LGBT people from Illinois Category:University of Denver alumni ",
