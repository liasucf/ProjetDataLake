They were open to amateur men only from across the world, with two styles of kickboxing - Full-Contact and Semi-Contact - on offer. This was the championships where the (now) world famous martial artist turned actor Jean- Claude Van Damme was supposed to have competed \u2013 although reports on the event and from participating fighters give no confirmation of Van Damme ever participating. By the end of the championships West Germany was the strongest nation, Italy were second, Great Britain third. The event was held at the Hillsborough Community College in Tampa, Florida, USA between November 3 and 4 in 1979. ==Men's Full-Contact Kickboxing== The Full-Contact category at Tampa had seven weight divisions, ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 84 kg/+184.8 lbs, with all bouts fought under Full-Contact rules. More detail on Full- Contact's rules-set can be found at the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules have changed since 1979. The medal winners of each division are shown below with notable winners being Tony Palmore who won his second gold medal at a W.A.K.O. world championships and reigning W.A.K.O. European champion and future K-1 world champion Branko Cikati\u0107 picking up a bronze medal. By the end of the event, West Germany were the strongest nation in Full-Contact, winning two golds and two silvers. ===Men's Full-Contact Kickboxing Medals Table=== {| |- | -57 kg |Howard Brown |Michael Kuhr |Jesus Duran Max Mankowitz |- | -63 kg |Ali Pehlivan |Godfrey Butler |Jonny Mirer Jimmy Barletta |- | -69 kg |Ferdinand Mack |Javier Reyes |Sandry Ravessoud Walter Parlovic |- | -74 kg |Franz Haller |Harold Roth |Alfred Tommey Branko Cikati\u0107 |- | -79 kg |Jean-Marc Tonus |Dieter Herdel |Benny Hedlund F.
