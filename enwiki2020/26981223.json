    "text": "Peronia is a genus of air-breathing sea slugs, a shell-less marine pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Onchidiidae. Even if the name Onchis as proposed by F\u00e9russac, 1822 [April] F\u00e9russac 1822: p. xxxj, date was 13 April 1822 is older than Peronia Fleming, 1822 [June], there is no need to replace Peronia (adopted by Labb\u00e9 and others) by Onchis (a name that was almost completely forgotten). The systematics of the family Onchidiidae is already quite confusing and there is no need to disrupt it further. Therefore Onchis is accepted as a synonym of Peronia.Dayrat, B.

Zootaxa 2068: 1-26WoRMS : Onchis; accessed : 14 January 2011 Onchis was proposed by F\u00e9russac in 1822 without description or indication, so it was a nomen nudum and not made available at that occasion. ==Species== According to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), the following species with valid names are included within the genus Peronia:WoRMS : Peronia; accessed : 30 September 2010 * Peronia anomala Labb\u00e9, 1934 * Peronia branchifera (Plate, 1893) * Peronia ferruginea (Lesson, 1831) * Peronia gaimardi Labb\u00e9, 1934 * Peronia gondwanae (Labb\u00e9, 1934) * Peronia indica (Labb\u00e9, 1934) * Peronia lata (Labb\u00e9, 1934) * Peronia peronii (Cuvier, 1804) * Peronia verruculata (Cuvier, 1830) ;Synonymized species : * Peronia acinosa Gould, 1852: synonym of Onchidina australis J.E.
