The album was re-issued in October 1998 under the title Sumo II. It won at the 1998 ARIA Music Awards for Best Rock Album, it was also nominated for Best Group & Breakthrough Artist - Album. To celebrate 20 years since its release, the album was re- released in August 2018, with bonus tracks and on Vinyl for the first time. The Superjesus toured the album across the second half of 2018. ==Reception== Jonathan Lewis from AllMusic said \"Sumo was full of guitar-driven alternative radio-friendly songs.\" adding \"Opening with the Helmet-style riffing of the excellent \"Down Again\", the Superjesus show that guitar rock with McLeod's vocals soaring over the top is definitely their strength. Unfortunately, it is also their weakness, with Sumo containing too little variation in style.\" Lewis said \"While the first half of Sumo shows plenty of promise, the second half loses its intensity.\" ==Track listing== 2018 20th Anniversary Edition ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !
