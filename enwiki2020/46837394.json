The forewings of the males are wood brown with a postbasal transverse row of three black spots ringed with grey and an antemedian serpentine shadow line, as well as a double line from the costa subapically to the inner margin. The outer portion is slightly darker than the rest of the wing, while the inner portion is dark brown. The costal two-thirds of the hindwings is salmon red, the rest of the wing has two dark lines (the outer one shadowy) from the abdominal margin for three-fourths of the way across the disc. There is a black spot on the abdominal margin at one-third from the base. The forewings of the females are cinnamon brown, with the basal one- third and an oblique median patch darker, as well as with a subbasal black spot on the costa and three yellow ones in the basal one-third of the wing. There are two curved postmedian transverse lines, the inner one deep brown, the outer one double, greenish yellow and black within. The two-thirds of the hindwings is orange salmon, while the rest of the wing is cinnamon brown, with three transverse bands from the abdominal margin across the disc of the wing, the middle one most distinct on the basal half, the outer one with the basal two-fifths strongly marked with olive yellow.Rothschild, W.
