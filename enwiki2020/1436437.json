    "text": "\"The Song Remains the Same\" is a song by the English rock group Led Zeppelin. It is the opening track from their 1973 album, Houses of the Holy. ==Composition== The song was originally an instrumental with the working title \"The Overture\".Dave Schulps, Interview with Jimmy Page, Trouser Press, October 1977. After singer Robert Plant added lyrics, it was temporarily known as \"The Campaign\" before becoming \"The Song Remains the Same\".Dave Lewis (1994), The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin, Omnibus Press, . In an interview he gave to Guitar World magazine in 1993, guitarist Jimmy Page discussed the song's construction: Plant's vocal track was slightly speeded up for the album release. Page played overdubs with a Telecaster on this recording, and also a Fender 12-string guitar. ==Performance and releases== The band first performed this song live on their 1972 Japanese Tour. Bootlegs from this tour reveal that the song was still without a settled title, with Plant introducing it as \"Zep\" from the stage at Tokyo. At Led Zeppelin concerts from late 1972 through 1975, \"The Song Remains the Same\" was followed (just as on the original album) by direct segue into \"The Rain Song\". For this live arrangement, Page employed his trademark Gibson EDS-1275 double-necked guitar.Interview with Jimmy Page, Guitar World magazine, 1993 \"The Song Remains the Same\" was the opening song for the 1977 US tour and 1979 concerts, before being dropped from the set list for the 1980 European tour. The song was also performed at Led Zeppelin's reunion show at the O2 Arena, London on 10 December 2007. \"The Song Remains the Same\" was featured on Led Zeppelin's 1976 concert film (and accompanying soundtrack), as part of Plant's fantasy sequence. The title of the song was used as the title of both the film and the album. \"The Song Remains The Same (Guitar Overdub Reference Mix)\", an instrumental version of the song, appears on the second disc of the remastered 2-CD deluxe edition of Houses of the Holy. It was recorded on 18 May 1972, at the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio at Stargroves, with engineer Eddie Kramer and mix engineer George Chkiantz. It runs 5:30, while the original runs 5:24. ==Reception== In a contemporary review of Houses of the Holy, Gordon Fletcher of Rolling Stone gave \"The Song Remains the Same\" a mixed review, writing that the track is \"the only other tune [on the album, except for \"The Ocean\"] approaching the Zep's past triumphs\" and \"works solely as a vehicle for Page's guitar antics\". In a retrospective review of Houses of the Holy (Deluxe Edition), Kristofer Lenz of Consequence of Sound gave \"The Song Remains the Same\" a more positive review, praising every band member and writing that \"as the band moves through the many changes of \u201cThe Song Remains the Same\u201d, they are tight yet nimble, proficient yet unpretentious.\" ==See also== *List of cover versions of Led Zeppelin songs ==References== ==External links== * Category:1973 songs Category:Led Zeppelin songs Category:Songs written by Jimmy Page Category:Songs written by Robert Plant Category:Song recordings produced by Jimmy Page Category:Songs about music Category:Metasongs ",
