    "text": "\"Racist Word Association Interview\", also called \"Racist Word Association\" and \"Dead Honky\", is a Saturday Night Live skit first aired on December 13, 1975, featuring Richard Pryor and Chevy Chase. ==Synopsis== At a job interview, the interviewer (Chase) asks the applicant (Pryor) to take a word association test. Partway through the test, the interviewer begins using anti-black racial slurs, to which the applicant reacts with anti-white slurs (including \"honky\"). Finally, the interviewer says \"nigger\", to which the applicant replies \"Dead honky\". ==Origin== Authorship of the skit is disputed, with claims being made both by Chase and by Paul Mooney.\"Saturday Night Live's\" edgiest night: The inside story of Richard Pryor's brilliant evening, at Salon.com; excerpted from Becoming Richard Pryor, by Scott Saul, published 2014 According to Mooney, when Pryor agreed to perform on Saturday Night Live, one of his conditions was that Mooney be hired as a scriptwriter. Mooney's interactions with Lorne Michaels and NBC executives were not positive, and he wrote the skit as a direct response. He also noted that Pryor \"despise(d)\" Chase.\"Saturday Night Live\" and Richard Pryor: The untold story behind \"SNL's\" edgiest sketch ever, at Salon.com; excerpted from Furious Cool: Richard Pryor and the World That Made Him, by David Henry and Joe Henry; published 2013 Chase, conversely, has described it as the result of a peaceful collaboration with Pryor, in which the paucity of anti-white slurs, relative to anti-black slurs, was \"reflective of the lack of bigotry in [Pryor].\" ==Reception== In 2014, Rolling Stone ranked the skit #10 in their list of the 50 \"greatest Saturday Night Live sketches of all time\", 50 Greatest \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 Sketches of All Time, at Rolling Stone; published February 23, 2014; retrieved July 16, 2019 while in 2011, Paste ranked it #5 in their list of the 10 \"most shocking moments\"The 10 Most Shocking Moments on Saturday Night Live, by Ross Bonaime; published October 27, 2011; retrieved July 16, 2019 \u2014 an opinion shared by VH1.The 15 Most Shocking Things to Happen on \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019, by Tara Aquino, published February 3, 2015; retrieved July 16, 2019 Don Cheadle declared it one of his favorite sketches,'SNL': Don Cheadle Reveals His Favorite Sketches Ahead of Hosting Gig, by Michael Hein, at PopCulture.com; published February 16, 2019; retrieved November 13, 2019 as did Keegan-Michael KeyKey & Peele's Comedy Syllabus, in Entertainment Weekly; published September 26, 2014; retrieved July 16, 2019 and Albert Brooks.
