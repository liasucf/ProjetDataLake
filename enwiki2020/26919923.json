    "text": "The Regina Victorias (often shortened to Vics) were two ice hockey teams, one at the senior level (1914\u20131938) and one at the junior level (1917\u20131921), based in Regina, Saskatchewan. The senior Vics played in the Allan Cup finals three times, winning the Allan Cup in their first (1914) appearance. The senior Victorias were six-time winners of the Saskatchewan Senior Championship, while the junior Victorias were two-time winners of the Saskatchewan Junior championship. ==Senior Team== The Victorias competed in the Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League (SSHL). They were SSHL champions in their first season, 1913\u201314, going on to win that year's Allan Cup as national champions. The Vics won their second SSHL championship two season later, but lost the challenge for the 1915\u201316 Allan Cup. The Victorias took a break in 1917\u201318 because of World War I. After the war they won the SSHL Championship in 1918\u201319, 1920\u201321, 1921\u201322, 1924\u201325, 1925\u201326, and 1928\u201329. They only managed to make the Allan Cup final once \u2013 in 1921\u201322. Their fortunes went steadily downhill. The Victorias faced on-ice and box office competition in their own city from the Regina Aces. Eventually the Aces won out and the Victorias folded in 1938. A combined team (Regina Vic-Aces) played in the 1940\u201341 season. ===Saskatchewan Senior Hockey League (1914\u201338) results=== Season Games Won Lost Tied Points GoalsFor GoalsAgainst Standing Playoffs 1913\u201314 16 12 4 0 24 \u2013 - 1st South Won Group, Won Sask, Won Allan Cup 1914\u201315 12 8 4 0 16 \u2013 - 2nd South out of playoffs 1915\u201316 16 11 4 1 23 \u2013 - 1st South Won Sask, Lost Allan Cup 1916\u201317 10 8 2 0 16 62 16 2nd out of playoffs 1918\u201319 8 5 3 0 10 \u2013 - 1st South Won Sask, No Allan Cup Challenge 1919\u201320 12 9 3 0 18 74 31 Tied 1st Lost Final 1920\u201321 16 10 6 0 20 \u2013 - Tied 1st Won Sask, No Allan Cup Challenge 1921\u201322 5 3 2 0 6 25 13 1st Won West, Lost Allan Cup 1922\u201323 11 7 4 0 14 48 44 2nd out of playoffs 1923\u201324 6 5 0 1 11 27 8 1st South Lost Sask 1924\u201325 9 8 1 0 16 \u2013 - 1st South Won Sask, Lost West Semi Final 1925\u201326 18 14 4 0 28 94 57 1st South Won Sask, Lost West Final 1926\u201327 7 4 3 0 8 39 27 2nd South Won Final, Lost Sask 1927\u201328 10 2 8 0 4 24 38 4th out of playoffs 1928\u201329 20 12 8 0 24 58 57 3rd South Won Final, Won Sask, Lost West Semi Final 1929\u201330 20 3 17 0 6 24 64 6th South out of playoffs 1930\u201331 20 11 5 4 26 43 32 2nd South Won Final, Lost Sask 1931\u201332 18 6 11 1 13 25 30 3rd South out of playoffs 1932\u201333 18 7 9 2 16 28 29 3rd South out of playoffs 1933\u201334 20 7 12 1 15 44 43 3rd South out of playoffs 1934\u201335 19 12 4 3 27 58 42 3rd South Lost Final 1935\u201336 20 3 17 0 6 38 37 6th South out of playoffs 1936\u201337 24 2 21 1 5 45 122 5th South out of playoffs 1937\u201338 24 7 13 4 18 76 99 tied 4th South Lost Quarter Final ==Junior Team== The Victorias had a junior team for only four seasons.
