He is the first openly gay prince in the world. He runs a charity, the Lakshya Trust, which works with the LGBT community. == Biography == He was born in Ajmer, the only son of Maharana Shri Raghubir Singhji Rajendrasinghji Sahib, Maharana of Rajpipla, and his wife Maharani Rukmini Devi. He has one sister, Minaxi Kumari, who is married into the princely family of Chenani in Jammu and Kashmir. In 1971, the government of India \"de-recognized\" the Indian princes, and Manvendra's father consequently lost the official title of Maharaja and the privy purse (an annual pension) that came with it. The princes adjusted to the new socialist regime; the Rajpipla royals converted their family seat, the Rajvant Palace in Rajpipla, into a tourist resort and location for film- shooting. They also set up a second residence in Mumbai. He was educated at Bombay Scottish School and at the Amrutben Jivanlal College of Commerce and Economics (one of the institutions in the Mithibai College campus in Vile Parle, Mumbai. His parents arranged marriage, and in January 1991, he married Chandrika Kumari, a princess of Jhabua State in Madhya Pradesh. Manvendra says about his marriage: ::\"I thought that after marriage everything will be all right, that with a wife, I will have children and become \"normal\" and then I will be at peace. I was struggling and striving to be \"normal.\" I never knew and nobody told me that I was gay and [that] this itself is normal and it will not change. That this is what is called homosexuality and it is not a disease. I tremendously regret for ruining (Chandrika's) life. I feel guilty, but I simply did not know better.\"India's gay prince appears on Oprah show. Rediff.com (31 December 2004). Retrieved on 20 August 2012. The marriage remained unconsummated. He says, \"It was a total disaster. A total failure. The marriage never got consummated. I realized I had done something very wrong. Now two people were suffering instead of one.
