    "text": "The Imperial Yeomanry Long Service Medal was a long service medal awarded by the United Kingdom. It is no longer awarded. ==Eligibility== Authorised by King Edward VII under Army Order No. 211 of 1904, the medal was awarded to troopers and non-commissioned officers in the Imperial Yeomanry for 10 years service and attending 10 annual camps. Any previous full time service in the Regular Army did not count towards this medal, although service in other volunteer and auxiliary forces could be counted, provided that five years immediately preceding the award were served in the Yeomanry. In 1908, the Imperial Yeomanry along with the Volunteer Force were transferred to the newly created Territorial Force. The medal was then superseded by the Territorial Force Efficiency Medal. Awards were published in Army Orders, with a total of 1,674 medals awarded, to men in over fifty different Yeomanry regiments, including 951 awards when the medal was first established.The 951 names appear in Army Order 27, February 1905.
