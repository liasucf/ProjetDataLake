    "text": "Yannick Salem is a French-born Congolese former international footballer. ==Career== The first three clubs that Salem played for were Grenoble, Cr\u00e9teil and Ch\u00e2teauroux. In 2005, he moved to the Dutch team De Graafschap. After impressing at De Graafschap, Salem went on a trial with Nottingham Forest in August 2007. After a successful trial spell at Forest, a deal could not be put in place so Yannick moved to AGOVV Apeldoorn, his second Dutch team. AGOVV Apeldoorn had a lot of financial problems which meant many of the first team players could not feature. After two frustrating seasons with the Dutch club, Salem moved to Belgian club K.S.K. Beveren and then the following season to the rich SV Eintracht Trier 05. The German club spent a lot of money on salaries in order to recruit the best possible players and move up the German divisions, however this did not lead to success on the pitch which led to a number of players, including Yannick, to break their contracts. On 30 October 2010 Salem signed a short-term deal at Stockport County in England. ==International career== Salem has been called up to the national team for Congo on a number of occasions. He made his debut in an African Cup Of Nations qualifier against Zambia in 2007, and has at least a further two caps from friendlies in 2009 against North Koreahttp://www.footballdatabase.eu/football.coupe.congo.coree-du- nord.101198.en.html and Angola.http://www.brazzaville- adiac.com/index.php?action=depeche&dep;_id=34498&cat;_id=6&oldaction;=home&regpay;_id=0 He was also called up for a game against Morocco, but had to withdraw from the squad. ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Amiens Category:French footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:French people of Republic of the Congo descent Category:US Cr\u00e9teil-Lusitanos players Category:SV Eintracht Trier 05 players Category:De Graafschap players Category:AGOVV Apeldoorn players Category:Eerste Divisie players Category:K.S.K.
