Jan Frederik Helmers (March 7, 1767 \u2013 February 26, 1813), was a Dutch poet born in Amsterdam. ==Works== His early poems, Night (1788) and Socrates (1790), were tame and sentimental, but after 1805 he determined, in company with his brother-in-law, Cornelis Loots (1765\u20131834), to rouse national feeling by a burst of patriotic poetry. His Poems (2 vols, 1809\u20131810), but especially his great work The Dutch Nation, a poem in six cantos (1812), created great enthusiasm and enjoyed immense success. Even the published censored version was contentious enough that only his premature death prevented an arrest by the French occupation.G.J. van Bork en P.J. Verkruijsse Helmers, Jan Frederik, in De Nederlandse en Vlaamse auteurs van middeleeuwen tot heden met inbegrip van de Friese auteurs., De Haan, Weesp, 1985 He owed his success mainly to the integrity of his patriotism and the opportune moment at which he sounded his counter-blast to the French oppression. His posthumous poems were collected in 1815. A neighbourhood in Amsterdam is named Helmersbuurt in his honour, built 1891-1902, with not less than three streets called after Helmers: the Eerste, Tweede and Derde Helmersstraat (which would be First, Second and Third Helmers Street in English). ==References== * ==External links== *Jan Frederik Helmers at the Digitale Bibliotheek voor de Nederlandse Letteren website Category:1767 births Category:1813 deaths Category:Dutch male poets Category:Writers from Amsterdam ",
