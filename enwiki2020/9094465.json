Jump-off Joe was a 100-foot-tall sea stack geological formation composed of middle Miocene concretionary sandstoneUSGS Erosion of a Sea Stack Over 100 Years at Nye Beach in Newport, Oregon, United States. It was a well-known tourist attraction before World War I.Historic Photo Archive - Jump Off Joe, Nye Beach, Newport, Oregon, ca. 1903 It formed sometime before the 1880s when it was connected to the mainland, and was a major impediment walking the beach. Early travelers would have to jump off the side to get over it, hence the name. Early writers claimed the site was connected with Native American mythology. Natural forces separated it from the mainland in the 1890s, and its large arch collapsed in 1916. Between 1920 and 1970, the majority of the sea stack collapsed, and by 1990 it had been swept away, and little trace remains today. In 1970 and 1990, members of the United States Geological Survey photographed the remains of the sea-stack. ==References== ==External links== *Historic images of Jump Off Joe from Salem Public Library Category:Natural arches of Oregon Category:Newport, Oregon Category:Destroyed landmarks in Oregon Category:Landforms of Lincoln County, Oregon Category:Stacks of the United States Category:Rock formations of Oregon Category:West Coast of the United States ",
