The Society is an avowedly Zionist Order, and every member on admission has to declare his willingness to be a Zionist, to pay the shekel and to assist generally through the Order in the work of resettling the Jews in Palestine. Membership consists primarily of people in the professions, with aims to provide \"social intercourse and co- operation among its members with a view to the promotion of the interests of Jews, including the support of any professional or learned bodies and charities.\" All persons \"of the Jewish faith who declare themselves adherents to the Zionist Movement\" can become members; membership also includes similarly minded, non-Jewish 'honorary' members. ==Past presidents== * 1891\u20131903 Raphael Meldola (in whose honour the society awards the Meldola medal for Chemistry) * 1903\u201304 Albert Goldsmid * 1904\u201327 Solomon Joseph Solomon * 1927\u201332 Herbert Bentwich * 1932\u201354 Selig Brodetsky * 1982\u201390 Sir Alan Marre * 1990\u20132000 Sir John Balcombe * 2000\u2013present Sir Ian Gainsford Other notable members have included: * Louis Barnett Abrahams * Chief Rabbi Hermann Adler * Norman Bentwich * Sir Ernst Boris Chain * Marcus Hartog * Rev.
