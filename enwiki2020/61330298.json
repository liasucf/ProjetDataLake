Bridget Annesley was a daughter of Robert Annesley of Rathverd or Rathuard and Newport Pagnell, an undertaker of the plantations in Munster, and Beatrix Cornwall, a daughter of John Cornwall of Moor Park, Hertfordshire. The surname \"Annesley\" was sometimes written \"Anslow\".See for example, John Maclean, Letters from George Lord Carew to Sir Thomas Roe (Camden Society, London, 1860), p. 69. Bridget Annesley became one of the servants of Anne of Denmark called maids of honour or \"chamberers\", a lady of the bedchamber. She may have got this appointment through her mother's parents, who lived near the Earl of Bedford and the Countess of Bedford's house at The More. The Countess of Bedford was influential with the queen. Another link was that the manor of Newport Pagnell belonged to the queen. Anne of Denmark gave clothes to Bridget Annesley, on 6 January 1610 she received a night gown of carnation and white taffeta, and on 8 December 1610 a dove-coloured taffeta gown with stripes of black and white made for the queen two years previously.Jemma Field, 'The Wardrobe Goods of Anna of Denmark', Costume, 51:1 (March 2017), pp. 20-1, & Supplement p. 32 no. 298, 39 no. 351. In 1614 she was a bought a bay ambling gelding horse for \u00a318 to replace her lame grey gelding.Frederick Madden, Issues of the Exchequer: James I (London, 1836), p. 345. She was known as \"the queen's servant Mrs Anslow\" in 1616, when her brother Francis Annesley (d. 1660) was promoted to be a joint-secretary of Ireland.John Maclean, Letters from George Lord Carew to Sir Thomas Roe (Camden Society, London, 1860), p. 69. Bridget Annesley may have helped her brother gain the favour of the king's new favourite George Villiers who could assist his friends in careers and appointments.Lloyd Bowen & Simon Healy, 'ANNESLEY, Sir Francis (by 1584-1660)', The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1604-1629, ed. Andrew Thrush and John P. Ferris, 2010. When the queen died in 1619 the other chamberers were; Elizabeth Murray (probably the Countess of Annandale), Marie Mayerne sister of Th\u00e9odore de Mayerne who married Gian Francesco Biondi in 1622;Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 479, Chamberlain describes Marie Mayerne as \"a very lumpe or great peece of flesh.\" Elizabeth Devick, a former attendant of Lady Edmondes; and Mary Gargrave as Maid of Honour, the daughter of Sir Cotton Gargrave and Anne Waterton, and Elizabeth Foukes who was probably a neice of John Finet.Frederick Devon, Pell Records: Issues of the Exchequer (London, 1836), p. 251: Joseph Jackson Howard, Miscellanea Genealogica Et Heraldica, vol. 1 (London, 1868), p. 226: See also a household list of 1619 written in French, BNF MS Fran\u00e7ais 15990See Helen Margaret Payne, 'Aristocratic Women and the Jacobean Court, 1603-1625 ', Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, PhD (2001), p. 280 for a list of the queen's women.

In 1627 Bridget Annesley petitioned for payment of back wages amounting to \u00a3866.CSP. Domestic: Charles I, 1627-1628 (London, 1858), p. 268. Connections made in the queen's household were strengthened in 1637 when her niece Beatrice Annesley, Francis Annesley's daughter, married James Zouch the son of Dorothea Silking, her Danish colleague in the queen's bedchamber, and Sir Edward Zouch of Woking.Brayley & Britton, A Topographical History of Surrey, vol. 2 part 1 (Dorking & London, 1842), p. 9: Francis Annesley & Patrick Little, 'Providence and Posterity: A Letter from Lord Mountnorris to His Daughter, 1642', Irish Historical Studies, 32:128 (November 2001), pp. 556-7.
