    "text": "New Beginning is the fourth album by singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman, released in 1995 (see 1995 in music). According to Nielsen Soundscan, it is her biggest-selling recording since 1991, with 3.8 million copies sold, and according to the RIAA, it has shipped five million copies in the United States. The album's sound consists of Chapman's trademark acoustic folk-rock sound and is mainly made up of slow low-key tunes and a few upbeat tracks. One notable exception is the hit \"Give Me One Reason\", which is a blues piece. Most tracks on the album have backup singers, which was very rare in Chapman's earlier works. The song \"Unsung Psalm\" was originally written and recorded for this album, but was cut. It was later included on her 2000 album Telling Stories. According to Billboard Magazine, the \"New Beginning\" single was the first disc to have a sticker printed on the back of the packaging detailing system requirements to play the multi-media footage. The use of a didgeridoo in the \"New Beginning\" track was a source of controversy. Chapman was taught to play at the Didgeridoo University in Alice Springs however the use of a didgeridoo by women is taboo in many aboriginal nations. ==Track listing== All songs written by Tracy Chapman. #\"Heaven's Here on Earth\" \u2013 5:23 #\"New Beginning\" \u2013 5:33 #\"Smoke and Ashes\" \u2013 6:39 #\"Cold Feet\" \u2013 5:40 #\"At This Point in My Life\" \u2013 5:09 #\"The Promise\" \u2013 5:28 #\"The Rape of the World\" \u2013 7:07 #\"Tell It Like It Is\" \u2013 6:08 #\"Give Me One Reason\" \u2013 4:31 #\"Remember the Tinman\" \u2013 5:45 #\"I'm Ready\" \u2013 4:56 #\"Save a Place for Me\" (hidden track) ==Personnel== *Tracy Chapman \u2013 organ, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, lead vocals, background vocals *Rock Deadrick \u2013 percussion, drums, background vocals *Lili Haydn \u2013 violin *Steve Ferrone \u2013 drums *Adam Levy \u2013 electric guitar, background vocals *Eric Rigler \u2013 tin whistle, Uilleann pipes *Scott Roewe \u2013 didgeridoo *Glenys Rogers \u2013 percussion, background vocals *John Philip Shenale \u2013 keyboards *Andy Stoller \u2013 bass guitar, background vocals, tamboura *Cameron Stone \u2013 cello *John Thomas \u2013 piano ==Production== *Producers: Tracy Chapman, Don Gehman *Engineer: Don Gehman *Assistant engineers: John Ewing, Jr., Kevin Scott, Doug Trantow *Mixing: Don Gehman *Mastering: Eddy Schreyer *Production coordination: Diane Medak *Art direction: Lee Cantelon *Design: Lee Cantelon *Graphic layout: Lavonne Murlowski *Photography: Christine Alicino ==Certifications== ==Awards== Grammy Awards {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Winner !Category |- |1996 |\"Give Me One Reason\" |Best Rock Song |} ==References== Category:Tracy Chapman albums Category:1995 albums Category:Albums produced by Don Gehman Category:Elektra Records albums Category:Blues albums by American artists ",
