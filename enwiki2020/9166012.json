    "text": "The Mistress is a British sitcom that aired on BBC2 from 1985 to 1987. Starring Felicity Kendal and Jane Asher, it was written by Carla Lane. The Mistress features Kendal playing Maxine, a young florist who is having an affair with a married man, whose wife was played by Jane Asher. It was disliked by some viewers, who were unhappy at seeing Felicity Kendal, who was best known as the innocent Barbara Good, playing a woman sleeping with someone else's husband. ==Production== Similar to Carla Lane's other sitcoms, including Butterflies and Solo (which also starred Felicity Kendal), The Mistress has a serious theme \u2013 that of an affair. The series was produced and directed by Gareth Gwenlan. The Mistress was filmed in Bath, Somerset, the florist shop being in Abbey Green, Bath and Maxine's house location at 26 St Mark's Road, Bath. After the lukewarm response to Series 1 over the subject matter, Series 2 was attempted to be rounded out slightly, still retaining the thread of having an affair, but serving as a more general comedy. These attempted improvements proved to be in vain however, and the series was axed after Series 2, never to be repeated. ==Cast== *Felicity Kendal \u2013 Maxine Mansel (Maxine \u2013 series 2) *Jack Galloway \u2013 Luke Carpenter (series 1) (called Luke Mansel in Series 2) *Peter McEnery \u2013 Luke (series 2) (Luke Mansel in Series 2) *Jane Asher \u2013 Helen Carpenter (called Helen Mansel in Series 2) *Tony Aitken \u2013 Simon *Jenny McCracken \u2013 Jenny (series 1) *Paul Copley \u2013 Jamie (series 2) *Peggy Sirr \u2013 Jo ==Plot== Maxine is the manager of a florist shop and is having an affair with married man Luke Carpenter.
