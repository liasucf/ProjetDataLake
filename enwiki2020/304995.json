Elected Patriarch of Moscow eighteen months prior to the fall of the Soviet Union, he became the first Russian Patriarch of the post-Soviet period. ==Family history== Alexey Mikhailovich Ridiger's father Mikhail Aleksandrovich Ridiger (1900\u20131960), born in Saint Petersburg, was a descendant of a Baltic German noble family. His ancestor Captain Heinrich Nikolaus (Nils) R\u00fcdinger, the commander of a Swedish fortification in D\u00fcnam\u00fcnde, Swedish Livonia, was knighted by Charles XI of Sweden in 1695. After Swedish Estonia and Swedish Livonia became part of the Russian Empire in the aftermath of the Great Northern War in the beginning of the 18th century, another forefather of Alexy II, Friedrich Wilhelm von R\u00fcdiger (1780\u20131840), adopted Orthodox Christianity during the reign of Catherine II of Russia.

After the Russian October Revolution in 1917, Alexey Ridiger's father Mikhail became a refugee and the family settled in Estonia, first in Haapsalu where a shelter was provided by priest Ralph von zur M\u00fchlen. Later Mikhail moved to Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, where he met and married in 1928 to Yelena Iosifovna Pisareva (1902\u20131955), who was born and later died there. Alexey Ridiger's father graduated from the theological seminary in Tallinn in 1940 and was ordained a deacon and later a priest and served as the rector of the Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God in Tallinn. Later, he was a member and the chairman of the Diocesan Council in Estonia.

He was baptised to Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church. From his early childhood Alexey Ridiger served in the Orthodox Church under the guidance of his spiritual father: Archpriest Ioann Bogoyavlensky. Alexey Ridiger attended Tallinn's Russian Gymnasium. After the Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940 Alexey Ridiger's family was listed for arrest in order to be deported from Estonia according to the Serov Instructions but were not found by the NKVD because instead of staying in their home they were hiding in a nearby hovel. During Occupation of Estonia by Nazi Germany (1941\u20131944) Alexey Ridiger attended with his father Mikhail, who had become an Orthodox priest on 20 December 1942, the German prison camps in Estonia offering salvation to the Russian prisoners of war. Such activities were tolerated by the German occupation authorities because it was seen as an effective anti Soviet propaganda. After Soviet forces returned to Estonia in the autumn of 1944, unlike the most of the people with Baltic German roots, the Ridiger family chose to stay in Estonia and didn't evacuate to the west. During the war Joseph Stalin had revived the Russian Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union. Having been closed during the war time, after the Soviet annexation of Estonia the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Tallinn was reopened in 1945. Alexey Ridiger who had become a Soviet citizen served as an altar boy in the cathedral from May to October 1946. He was made a psalm-reader in St. Simeon's Church later that year; in 1947, he officiated in the same office in the Church of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God in Tallinn. ==Career== Kremlin Cathedral of the Annunciation, presents Vladimir Putin with an icon of Saint Alexander Nevsky at the latter's presidential inauguration on 7 May 2000.

On 15 July 1957, Fr. Alexiy was appointed Rector of the Cathedral of the Dormition in Tallinn and Dean of the Tartu district. He was elevated to the rank of Archpriest on 17 August 1958, and on 30 March 1959 he was appointed Dean of the united Tartu-Viljandi deanery of the Tallinn diocese. On 3 March 1961 he was tonsured a monk in the Trinity Cathedral of the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius. His name (secular \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439, clerical \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0439) was not changed when he became a monk, but his patron saint changed from Alexius of Rome to Alexius, Metropolitan of Moscow whose relics repose in the Theophany Cathedral in Moscow. On 14 August 1961, he was chosen to be the Orthodox Church Bishop of Tallinn and Estonia. On 23 June 1964, he was elevated to the rank of archbishop; and, on 25 February 1968, when he just turned 40 years old, he was elevated to metropolitan. In 1986 he was released from the post of the Chancellor, which he had held since 1961 and which allowed him to be based in the Moscow Patriarchy's headquarters, and transferred to Leningrad; the decision was effectively made by the Council for Religious Affairs and was later presented by Alexy as punishment for his letter in December 1985 to Mikhail Gorbachev with proposals of reforms to church-state relations. Shortly after Alexy's death, the then Chairman of the Council Kharchev strongly denied that and said the decision was aimed at \"defusing the tense emotional atmosphere within Patriarch Pimen's inner circle\".\u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b Nezavisimaya gazeta 17 December 2008.

Patriarch Alexy II was \"the first patriarch in Soviet history to be chosen without government pressure; candidates were nominated from the floor, and the election was conducted by secret ballot.\" Upon taking on the role of Patriarch, Patriarch Alexy became a vocal advocate of the rights of the church, calling for the Soviet government to allow religious education in the state schools and for a \"freedom of conscience\" law. During the attempted coup in August 1991, he denounced the arrest of Mikhail Gorbachev, and anathematized the plotters. He publicly questioned the junta's legitimacy, called for restraint by the military, and demanded that Gorbachev be allowed to address the people.Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, 2nd Edition.(Oxford: Westview Press, 2003), p 96.

Laurus (left) in the residence of Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia in Peredelkino. Patriarch Alexy II repeatedly affirmed the traditional stand of the Orthodox Church and opposed the display of homosexuality in Russia, and in particular, opposed gay parades in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The Church, according to the Patriarch, \"has invariably supported the institution of the family and condemns untraditional relations, seeing them as a vicious deviation from God-given human nature\". He also said, \"I am convinced that gays' desire to organize a parade in Moscow will not help strengthen the family as the foundation of a strong state\". He also said that homosexuality is an illness, and a distortion of the human personality like kleptomania. Patriarch Alexy has also issued statements condemning anti-Semitism.

Despite his age, he appeared healthy, and had been leading an active pastoral life. He was frequently seen on Russian TV, conducting Church services, and meeting with various government officials. In February 2007 a controversy erupted when Diomid, Bishop of Chukotka, condemned the ROC's hierarchy and personally Patrirch Alexy II for ecumenism, supporting democracy and misguided loyalty to the Russian secular authorities. Bishop Diomid also took the position that taxpayer IDs, cell phones, passports, vaccination and globalisation were tools of the antichrist, and that the leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church have \"departed from the purity of the Orthodoxal dogma\" in its support of the Russian government and of democracy, as well as its ecumenism with other confessions. After a decision of the All- Russian Council, and Bishop Diomid's refusal to appear, he was defrocked in July 2008, ==Personal life== Danilov Monastery, the residence of the Patriarch and the Holy Synod He married Vera Alekseeva,\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430 in \"\u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f \u0417\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438\" the daughter of a priest from Tallinn Georgi Alekseev, later Bishop of Tallinn and Archbishop of Gorki, on 11 April 1950,Wife of the Patriarch , by Evgeniy Sidorenko, Moscow News, \u2116 21 (22 May 2001)\u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e. \u0417\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u041f\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043c Same article, but with the original photographs of the printed article.\u041f\u0443\u0442\u044c \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430 Nezavisimaya gazeta 17 December 2008. on the Tuesday of Bright Week when marriages are normally prohibited according to Church tradition; however, permission was granted by Metropolitan Gregory of Leningrad, at the request of Bishop Roman of Tallinn and the fathers of both the bride and groom (both of whom were priests, and who concelebrated the marriage together). Moskovskie Novosti has alleged that according to a denunciation written by a priest-inspector Pariysky to the Leningrad Council of Religious Affairs, the marriage had been expedited in order for Ridiger to become a deacon and avoid being drafted into the Soviet Military (marriage is impossible after ordination in Orthodoxy). Up until 1950, seminarians were given a deferment from the draft, but in 1950 this was changed, and only clergy were exempt. For reasons which have remained private, they divorced less than a year later.

The apology resulted in accusations by Russian Communists and the Russian National Bolshevik Party of insulting the Russian nation and treason. ===Opposition in the Russian Orthodox Church=== Some activities, views and policies of Alexy II such as engaging in ecumenical dialogue (when Metropolitan, Alexy had been one of the presidents of the Conference of European Churches since 1964; in March 1987 he was elected President of the CEC Presidium and Advisory Committee, in which post he remained until November 1990)\u0416\u041c\u041f (Russian edition of The Journal of the Moscow Patriarchate), 1991, # 2, p. 61. with representatives of other religious groups and publicly condemning antisemitism were met with opposition by some in the Russian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Alexy II responded by saying that such people do not represent the opinions of the church but expressed their own private views as free citizens instead.Pospielovsky, pp.396\u2013397 ===Work for the KGB=== Modern fresco of the Donskoi Monastery, representing Alexy II bringing the relics of Patriarch Tikhon into the monastery.

The report detailing his recruitment makes clear that the KGB viewed Alexy, then still a priest, as a high-flier. It had already earmarked him as a future Bishop of the Russian Orthodox diocese of Tallinn and Estonia. He was appointed to this post less than three years later.The Drozdov Files: Patriarch Alexy II and the KGB https://www.academia.edu/37137680/The_Drozdov_Files_Patriarch_Aleksi_II_and_the_KGB Among his KGB assignments was one in 1983, when he was sent to the Pskov-Caves Monastery to \"pacify\" rebellious monks.Cold War Lingers At Russian Church In New Jersey By Suzanne Sataline, Wall Street Journal 18 July 2007. In February 1988, exactly 30 years after his recruitment, the KGB chairman awarded him the Certificate of Honour. Alexander Grigoryev, a KGB officer in Leningrad under cover as Orthodox priest Fr Alexander was his case officer for a while. According to Oleg Gordievsky, Alexy worked for the KGB for forty years, and his case officer was Nikolai Patrushev. The Moscow Patriarchate has, however, consistently denied that Patriarch Alexy was a KGB agent.\"Official spokesman for the Moscow Patriarchy Father Vsevolod Chaplin labeled such reports as \"absolutely unsubstantiated\" in a Wednesday interview with Interfax. \"There is no data indicating that Patriarch Alexy II was an associate of the special services, and no classified documents bear his signature,\" he said. \"I do not think that direct dialogue between the current patriarch and KGB took place,\" Father Vsevolod continued. However, \"all bishops communicated with representatives of the council for religious matters in the Soviet government, which was inevitable, since any issue, even the most insignificant one, had to be resolved through this body. It is quite another matter that the council forwarded all its materials to the KGB,\" he said.\" Moscow Patriarchate Rejects Times Report of Alexy II'S Collaboration with KGB, Sept 20, 2000 (Interfax) \"Chaplin, the church spokesman, said in March, \"Nobody has ever seen a single real document that would confirm the patriarch used his contacts with Soviet authorities to make harm to the church or to any people in the church.\" Russia's Well-Connected Patriarch, Washington Post Foreign Service, 23 May 2002; \"Father Chaplin said: 'In recent times many anonymous photocopies of all sorts of pieces of paper have been circulated. In none of them is there the slightest evidence that the individuals we are talking about knew that these documents were being drawn up, or gave their consent. So I don't think any reasonably authoritative clerical or secular commission could see these papers as proof of anything.'\", Russian Patriarch 'was KGB spy', The Guardian (London), 12 February 1999 Konstantin Kharchev, former chairman of the Soviet Council for Religious Affairs, explained: \"Not a single candidate for the office of bishop or any other high-ranking office, much less a member of Holy Synod, went through without confirmation by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the KGB\". Professor Nathaniel Davis points out: \"If the bishops wished to defend their people and survive in office, they had to collaborate to some degree with the KGB, with the commissioners of the Council for Religious Affairs, and with other party and governmental authorities.\"Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, (Oxford: Westview Press, 1995), p .96 Davis quotes one bishop as saying: \"Yes, we \u2013 I, at least, and I say this first about myself \u2013 I worked together with the KGB. I cooperated, I made signed statements, I had regular meetings, I made reports. I was given a pseudonym \u2013 a code name as they say there... I knowingly cooperated with them \u2013 but in such a way that I undeviatingly tried to maintain the position of my Church, and, yes, also to act as a patriot, insofar as I understood, in collaboration with these organs. I was never a stool pigeon, nor an informer.\" Patriarch Alexy acknowledged that compromises were made with the Soviet government by bishops of the Moscow Patriarchate, himself included, and publicly repented of these compromises: \"Defending one thing, it was necessary to give somewhere else. Were there any other organizations, or any other people among those who had to carry responsibility not only for themselves but for thousands of other fates, who in those years in the Soviet Union were not compelled to act likewise? Before those people, however, to whom the compromises, silence, forced passivity or expressions of loyalty permitted by the leaders of the church in those years caused pain, before these people, and not only before God, I ask forgiveness, understanding and prayers.\"From an interview of Patriarch Alexy II, given to \"Izvestia\" No 137, 10 June 1991, entitled \"Patriarch Alexy II: \u2013 I Take upon Myself Responsibility for All that Happened\", English translation from Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, (Oxford: Westview Press, 1995), p 89. See also History of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, by St. John (Maximovich) of Shanghai and San Francisco, 31 December 2007 According to Nathaniel Davis, when asked by the Russian press about claims that he was a \"compliant\" bishop, \"Aleksi defended his record, noting that while he was bishop of Tallinn in 1961, he resisted the communist authorities' efforts to make the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in the city a planetarium (which, in truth, they did do elsewhere in the Baltic states) and to convert the P\u00fchtitsa Dormition nunnery to a rest home for miners.\"Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, (Oxford: Westview Press, 1995), p. 89f Official records show that the Tallinn diocese had a lower number of forced Church closings than was typical in the rest of the USSR during Patriarch Alexy's tenure as bishop there.Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, (Oxford: Westview Press, 1995), fn. 115, p. 272 Timothy Ware notes, \"Opinions differ over the past collaboration or otherwise between the Communist authorities, but on the whole he is thought to have shown firmness and independence in his dealings as a diocesan bishop with the Soviet State.\"Timothy Ware, The Orthodox Church, New Edition, (London: Penguin Books, 1997), p. 164 ==Death and burial== Cathedral of Christ the Saviour on 9 December 2008.

Prime Minister Putin at the coffin of Patriarch Alexy. * On the day of Alexy II death the BBC said: \"Patriarch Alexiy II had an extraordinary career, in which he switched from suppressing the Russian Orthodox Church to being its champion. A favourite of the KGB, he was promoted rapidly through the Church hierarchy, doing the Kremlin's bidding at a time when dissident priests were thrown into jail. As the Church's effective foreign minister, he helped cover up the repression of Russian Christians, defending the Soviet system to the outside world. He rose quickly through the ranks, being elected head of the Russian Orthodox Church at a crucial time, in 1990, with the Soviet Union on the path to collapse. Surprisingly, perhaps, he seized the moment, and went on to oversee the revival and flowering of the Church.\" * Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a leader in the American Jewish community, was asked by church officials to attend the Patriarch's funeral. In a statement, he stated that Alexy II \"served as the ethical pulse of the religious community in the former Soviet Union under a regime that neither welcomed nor tolerated people of faith and the leaders of organized religion.\" * Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of Estonia: \"I will always remember Alexius II as an especially wise man who was respected by people from the religious and secular worlds alike.\" ==References== ==External links== * Patriarch Alexey, petersburgcity.com * *A 2008 Eulogy.
