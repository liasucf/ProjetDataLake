    "text": "Bermuda Hill, also known as the Liver House, is a historic plantation house in Hale County, Alabama near Prairieville, Alabama. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 7, 1994 as a part of the Plantation Houses of the Alabama Canebrake and Their Associated Outbuildings Multiple Property Submission. NRIS Database, National Register of Historic Places. Retrieved 2 December 2008. The vernacular Greek Revival structure that exists today is an example of the I-house form, with an earlier two-story log dogtrot house incorporated within its weather-boarded exterior. The Manning family first owned the property. The Mannings were early settlers and planters in Prairieville and owned large land tracts in the original French grants of the Vine and Olive Colony. In 1845, William W. Manning sold the land to William Weeden of Madison County. It is unclear whether Manning or Weeden built the house. It had been acquired by Dr. James Daniel Browder, owner of nearby Hawthorne by the time of the Confederate-era Assessment of Taxes on Real Estate in Marengo County for 1863. Bermuda Hill has had some alterations over time, one of which was the removal of the second floor balcony under the portico. It was placed on Alabama's Places in Peril in 2011, but new owners purchased the home and completed a full restoration in 2013. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hale County, Alabama Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama Category:Greek Revival houses in Alabama Category:I-houses in Alabama Category:Houses completed in 1845 Category:Plantation houses in Alabama Category:Houses in Hale County, Alabama ",
