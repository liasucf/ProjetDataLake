The band consists of five members: Phil Kosch (guitar), Dan Wade (guitar/vocals), Alex Maier (bass/vocals), Chris Insidioso (drums) and Mike Chorvat (vocals, guitar, tambourine). == History == Treaty of Paris formed in January 2005 when Michael Chorvat, Dan Wade, Scott Hoeft and Brandon Capetillo of the local Chicago band Empyrean recruited Phil Kosch from the local Chicago band Saraphine. The name Treaty of Paris was originally a fake name the band used at their first show with Kosch in order to downplay the fact that he was leaving his current band, but they decided to keep it because it was easy to remember. Hoeft would later leave the group and was replaced by Chris Insidioso from Chicago hardcore group Rollo Tomasi.[ Treaty of Paris] at Allmusic Their first release was the EP Behind Our Calm Demeanors, released in September 2005.Album Review, Absolute Punk, December 23, 2005.
