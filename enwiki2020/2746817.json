    "text": "\"Red Sector A\" is a song by Rush that provides a first-person account of a nameless protagonist living in an unspecified prison camp setting. \"Red Sector A\" first appeared on the band's 1984 album Grace Under Pressure. Lyricist Neil Peart has stated that the detailed imagery in the song intentionally evokes concentration camps of the Holocaust, although he left the lyrics ambiguous enough that they could deal with any similar prison camp scenario. The song was inspired in part by Geddy Lee's mother's accounts of the Holocaust. ==Background== Geddy Lee explained the genesis of the song in an interview: In a 1984 interview Neil Peart describes writing Red Sector A: ==Song title== The song's title 'Red Sector A' comes from the name of a NASA launch area at Kennedy Space Center, where the band watched the first launch of Space Shuttle Columbia on April 12, 1981. This trip also inspired the song \"Countdown\", from their previous album Signals. ==Track listing== ==See also== *List of anti-war songs *List of songs recorded by Rush ==References== *Rock 'N' Roll Never Forgets Holocaust's Horror, Palm Beach Post, May 6, 2005 ==External links== * Official Rush website * Red Sector A video on Youtube Category:1984 singles Category:Rush (band) songs Category:Songs about the Holocaust Category:1984 songs Category:Songs based on actual events Category:Songs written by Geddy Lee Category:Songs written by Alex Lifeson Category:Songs written by Neil Peart ",
