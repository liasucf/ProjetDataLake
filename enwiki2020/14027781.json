According to T.J.

LL gives the names Euguen, Iguein, Yuein, Ouein. The corresponding form in Irish is Eoghan.\u201d Morgan notes that there are less likely alternative explanations and agrees with Dr. Rachel Bromwich that Welsh Owein \u201cis normally latinized as Eugenius,\" and both the Welsh and Irish forms are Latin derivatives. Additionally, another latinized variations of the name Owen is Audoenus in certain parish registersSurnames of the United Kingdom, reprinted for Clearfield Company, INC by Genealogical Publishing Co. INC, Baltimore 1995, 1996. Entry notes that the most likely and widely accepted origin of Owen (Old Welsh Owain, Irish Gaelic Eoghan, and Scottish Gaelic Eoghann,) is from Latin Eugenius. \u201cCormic gives this origin for Eogan (one MS, Eogen); and Zimmer considers Owen to be borrowed from Latin Eugens, as noted by MacBain, p. 400. The mediaeval Latinization of Owen as Oenus led to a belief that the etymology was the Welsh and Breton oen \u2018lamb\u2019.
