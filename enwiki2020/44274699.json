    "text": "Jungle Cat is a 1960 American documentary film written and directed by James Algar. The documentary chronicles the life of a female spotted jaguar in the South American jungle. The film was released on August 10, 1960, by Buena Vista Distribution and was the last of the True-Life Adventures feature films. ==Plot== An amazing adventure to Brazil to discover the supreme ruler of the Amazon jungle: the jaguar. The film offers an intimate glimpse into the lives of a jaguar family in life-and-death struggles with a caiman, a peccary, a pirarucu, and an anaconda. ==Reception== Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote, \"As written and directed by James Algar, this is one of Mr. Disney's best\u2014intimate, tasteful, strong and matter-of-fact.\"Thompson, Howard (August 18, 1960). \"Disney Double Bill\". The New York Times. 19. Variety stated, \"Somewhat less astonishing, considerably less amusing, but equally as meticulous and painstakingly filmed as Walt Disney's previous true-life adventure pieces, 'Jungle Cat' pokes around in the lush rain forests of Brazil and comes up with some splendidly photographed shots of wildlife in its best survival-of-the-fittest form.\"\"Film Reviews: Jungle Cat\". Variety. August 10, 1960. 6. Frank Mulcahy of the Los Angeles Times called the film \"a fascinating study of 'the greatest hunter of all cats,' the jaguar ... Like all films in this particular Disney series, it is beautifully photographed in Technicolor and shows every evidence of the painstaking work required to produce such remarkable footage.\"Mulcahy, Frank (August 13, 1960). \"'Jungle Cat' Proves Fascinating Study\". Los Angeles Times. Part I, p. 12. The Monthly Film Bulletin said, \"The detail of the film's reportage, and its photographic magnificence, are the more remarkable considering the conditions under which it must have been made ... The whimsy makes the film doubly suitable for children. But one still deplores the over-joviality of a commentary which noisily relishes the prospect of animals killing and eating one another\u2014as when a jaguar, disappointed in some victim, casts around for another just as a wild pig trots into sight. 'Never mind,' says the commentator, 'here comes a nice pork chop on the hoof!'\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1960 films Category:Disney documentary films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Walt Disney Pictures films Category:American documentary films Category:1960 documentary films Category:Films directed by James Algar Category:Films about animals Category:Films produced by Ben Sharpsteen Category:Films scored by Oliver Wallace Category:Films about cats ",
