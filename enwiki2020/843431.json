    "text": "Hyacinthe Klos\u00e9 Hyacinthe El\u00e9onore Klos\u00e9 (11 October 1808 \u2013 29 August 1880) was a French clarinet player, professor at the Conservatoire de Paris, and composer. ==Life and music== Klos\u00e9 was born in Corfu (Greece). He was second clarinet at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Italien to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Berr beginning in 1836, then to Iwan M\u00fcller following Berr's death in 1838, finally becoming solo clarinettist when M\u00fcller left in 1841. In the Paris Conservatory, Klos\u00e9 had many notable pupils including:Pamela Weston: Clarinet Virtuosi of the Past (London: Robert Hale, 1971); reprint: Emerson Edition, 2004. * K.I. Boutruy, who received First Prize in 1852. * A. Grisez, who received First Prize in 1857. * Augusta Holm\u00e8s. * Adolphe Marthe Leroy, who succeeded Klos\u00e9 in his Paris professorship in 1868. * Louis A. Mayeur, to whom he also taught the saxophone in the early 1850s. * I.G. Paulus, who received the \"L\u00e9gion d'Honneur\" in the same year as Klos\u00e9. * Cyrille Rose, who received First Prize in 1847. * Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Selmer, who was so accomplished that a special \"Prize of Honour\" was created for him in his final year, 1852. * Charles Paul Turban, who received Second Prize in 1864 and First Prize in 1865. Klos\u00e9 was also noted for his design improvements to the clarinet using the principles laid down by Theobald Boehm in his innovative work on the flute keywork. From 1839 to 1843, he enlisted the help of Louis-August Buffet of Buffet-Crampon fame, an instrument-making technician, to construct what is known today as the Boehm system clarinet. He died in Paris. ==References== * Paul, Jean-Marie: \"Hyacinthe Klos\u00e9 (1808\u20131880): His Works for Clarinet\", in: The Clarinet, vol. 33 (2006) no. 3, pp.66\u201371. ==External links== * Category:1808 births Category:1880 deaths Category:19th-century classical composers Category:19th-century French composers Category:19th-century male musicians Category:Academics of the Conservatoire de Paris Category:Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur Category:French classical clarinetists Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:French Romantic composers Category:People from Corfu ",
