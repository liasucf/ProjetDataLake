A two-storied building with a long, rectangular shape is similar to palace buildings, while the interior decorative elements are more in the style of the interior of Sheki houses. Each floor consists of three rooms and two small corridors. The rooms on the first floor have winter halls, where \"bukharis\" (fireplaces) are placed. The second floor, similar to the first floor, is designed for guests. Plan of Shekikhanov's Palace In the second floor interior, the main flooring is a decorative vine. Rectangular boards cover the walls. Wall painting subjects include Azerbaijani poet Nizami's heroes, \"Seven Beauties\", \"Leyli and Majnun\" poems and covered with a very unusual stalactite.
