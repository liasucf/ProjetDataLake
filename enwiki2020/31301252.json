    "text": "L'Amadigi is an epic poem written in Italian by Bernardo Tasso and first published in 1560. It was inspired by the Amad\u00eds de Gaula of Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo. This poem has inspired Floridante (sometimes misspelt as Florindante), that remained incomplete because of the death of the author. The son of Bernardo, Torquato, completed it and published it in 1587. ==References== ==External links== * L'Amadigi Category:1560 books Category:Renaissance literature Category:Epic poems in Italian Category:Italian poems ",
