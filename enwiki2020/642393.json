    "text": "In archaeology and anthropology a mortuary house is any purpose-built structure, often resembling a normal dwelling in many ways, in which a dead body is buried. Proper treatment and placing of the dead has always been of great concern to people around the world. While choice of burial location and treatment of the corpse usually depend on beliefs and ritual standards within a specific cultural context, they are as well of a strategic nature. Burial decisions are affected by cultural norms regarding the deceased\u2019s age, gender, vertical or horizontal status and by the relationship of people to places and other people. Ideas concerning proper burial also apply to those who have been defunct for quite some time. Dead bodies have been exhumed, reburied and desecrated in order to redefine \u2013 elevate or degrade \u2013 the status of their owners, construct new affiliations, rewrite history and to retrieve or construct social memory.Weiss-Krejci, E. (2004). Mortuary representations of the noble house - a cross-cultural comparison between collective tombs of the ancient maya and dynastic europe. Journal of Social Archaeology, 4(3), 368-404. Following the laying to rest of the deceased, who is often surrounded with grave goods, an earthwork called a kurgan in Russian or barrow in English is raised over the house and the structure left sealed. The term has parallels with Christian sepulchres which contain only one burial. Mortuary houses differ from mortuary enclosures in size, design and in the latter's capacity for multiple burials. ==Origin== According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word mortuary derived in the early 14th century, from the word mortuarie, an Anglo-French word meaning \"gift to a parish priest from a deceased parishioner\"; from a Medieval Latin word mortuarium, a noun use of neuterof Late Latin adjective mortuarius \"pertaining to the dead\", from Latin mortuus, past participle of mori \"to die\".
