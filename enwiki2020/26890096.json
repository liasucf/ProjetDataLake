The film, which went on nationwide general release across Turkey on , was one of the highest-grossing Turkish films of 2010. ==Plot== Nine separate stories intertwine into one comedy on people\u2019s expectations and perceptions of a beautiful summer vacation: the stories of those who are only after love; of those who have to stay at home and fight mosquitoes on summer nights; of those who only go to the sea; of those who cannot appreciate the value of a bicycle - the most beautiful summer gift ever; and of those who are still away at their holiday spot even after they have returned home. == Cast == * Y\u0131lmaz Erdo\u011fan - M\u00fcd\u00fcr * Eser Yenenler * * \u015eahin Irmak - Kaz\u0131m * B\u00fc\u015fra Pekin - Hatice * ==Release== The film opened in 476 screens across Turkey on at number one in the Turkish box office chart with an opening weekend gross of $1,544,435. ==Reception== ===Box office=== The movie was number one at the Turkish box office for three weeks and made a total gross of $6,322,637 in Turkey. ===Reviews=== Emine Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, writing in Today's Zaman, states,\"The point of this film is obviously to take the TV show and the theater performance beyond its boundaries and supplement it with a couple of cinematic tricks and conventions\", and \"It\u2019s all good and dandy, with an assured technical polish and upbeat direction\", and also the acting is great and the sketches are wittily written by the BKM collective, which has an exceptionally perceptive taste on contemporary Turkish society with its cultural authenticities, yet one wonders if the film brings anything new to cinema except for increasing its regular viewer base. Despite all its vivacity, he concludes, \"[the film] comes out early in the season since its light 'summer' sensibilities don\u2019t exactly mix well with the dreary spring showers\", and \"It\u2019s exactly the type of film that one would want to throw oneself at while enjoying the luxury of air-conditioned theaters while stuffing one\u2019s face with popcorn. Still, it\u2019s worth a watch to lighten up those spirits if you don\u2019t own a TV at home.\" == See also == * Turkish films of 2010 * 2010 in film ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010 films Category:Turkish films Category:Turkish-language films Category:2010s musical comedy films Category:Films set in Turkey Category:Turkish musical comedy films Category:2010 comedy films ",
