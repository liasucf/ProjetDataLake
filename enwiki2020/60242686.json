The comic centered on the titular Mort who dies while street racing and returns as an undead being who is tormented by both the living and the dead. Despite its offbeat humor and bizarre scenario, it has been designated as officially being part of the Marvel Universe.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #5 ==Publication history== The comic ran for four issues from December 1993 to March 1994. The comic written by Larry Hama while all the art was handled Gary Hallgren. ==Plot== Mort Graves is a loser teenager from Mistake Beach, Long Island, New York. He tries to impress his crush Kimberly Dimenmein by racing against her boyfriend Lance Boyle in a broken down Studebaker. While doing so, he gets struck and beheaded by an oncoming train and ends up in the afterlife where he meets Teen Death, the son of the actual Death. Hell is already full and Heaven is closed for repairs. With no other choice, Mort is sent back to the living where he is now an undead being and discovers that his family is in \"mourning\" for him (actually more concerned with other things relating to his death). To Mort's pleasure, Kimberly seems genuinely saddened at Mort's death while Maureen, a tough motorcycle riding teen, accuses her of not caring about him prior. Mort fails to realize that Maureen clearly had feelings for him though his friends, Slick and Weirdo think it is obvious. After another argument with his family, Mort attends Slick and Weirdo's band tryouts and are quickly joined by Kimberly and Maureen. Jealous of the chemistry between them, Mort attempts to sabotage their equipment, but Weirdo's dad loves their new sound and makes himself their manager, much to Mort's chagrin.Mort the Dead Teenager #1-2 The band, Positive Feedback, go to a major club to perform with Mort following along. While in the bathroom, Mort once again gets dragged back by Teen Death who tells him that he needs to start haunting people again or he will be left in purgatory. The group get on stage to perform with Mort creating a wide variety of effects, only to realize they were playing to an empty house. After coming home, Mort confronts Teen Death who tells him different outcomes if he had not died. One has him getting a menial job at a car wash and getting killed in an upcoming war with Canada. Another has him marry an overweight Kimberly while still working the car wash while all of his friends become successful. The last one has him quitting his car wash job to travel the world where he gets a bag of gold and buys a race car, only for aliens to attack. He returns to the present where his family still act like jerks, Weirdo has become homeless, Slick gets into science fan fiction, Maureen changes her style and starts dating Lance and Kimberly runs away to become a beat poet. Mort awakens to realize the whole ordeal was a dream and is alive again. However, Mort seems destined for failure as he leaves to relive the incident that started it all.Mort the Dead Teenager #3-4 ==Characters== *Mort Graves \u2013 An inept and loser teenager who gets beheaded by a train in a racing accident.
