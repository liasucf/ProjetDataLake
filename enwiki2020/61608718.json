The people of Zelovo though, suspected Kaoudis of being assosicated with IMRO or something related and demanded him and his group to leave the village, even after Pavlos Kyrou ensured them that Kaoudis is not what they believe. The misunderstandment had to be solved by Liantzakis, who as the representor of the village went to Monastir to get insurance from the Greek consul that Kaoudis was acting under the general orders of the Greek state which he was.Gistor, \u03a4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03b4\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03ac (\u0391\u03cd\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 1904) [The groups of Kaoudis and Melas (August 1904)] In the same year Liantzakis set up an armed group and acted in the regions of Prespa and Korestia against Bulgarian Komitadjis until the end of the Macedonian Struggle in 1908. == References == Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Year of death unknown Category:Greek people of the Macedonian Struggle Category:Greek Macedonians Category:Macedonian revolutionaries (Greek) Category:People from Prespes ",
