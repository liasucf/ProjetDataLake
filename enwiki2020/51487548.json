She opposed a proposal for an \"immediate and substantial reduction in armaments\" arguing that this would have a drastic effect on employment. She preferred a gradual reduction in arms.Proceedings in Connection with the Annual Meeting of the National Liberal Federation - 1928 Nine months after being chosen as Northampton's Liberal candidate, voters went to the polls in the 1929 General Election. Although Northampton had last returned a Liberal as recently as 1922, in a by-election early in 1928, the Liberal candidate had finished third in a contest closely fought between Unionist and Labour. That made Argenti's campaign a tough one, despite the fact that the vote was being given to women under 30 for the first time. She came third, polling just over a fifth of the vote. She did not stand for parliament again.British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1992, FWS Craig However, now married, Helen Argenti remained active within the Liberal Party, most notably in the Women's Liberal Federation. In 1939 she supported the peace efforts of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain out of a sense of national unity. This encouraged her to write to Liberal Party leader Sir Archibald Sinclair, whom she criticised for giving vocal support to Chamberlain's critic Sir Anthony Eden.Liberal Crusader: The Life of Sir Archibald Sinclair - Page 133 She was buried on 28 March 1988, at the Greek Orthodox Cemetery, in West Norwood.http://www.christopherlong.co.uk ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Liberal Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:British people of Greek descent Category:Eastern Orthodox Christians from the United Kingdom Helen ",
