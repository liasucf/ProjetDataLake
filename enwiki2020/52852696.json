She had long been active in local initiatives. Lanese is married to former Ohio State football player Mike Lanese. She is a mother of three. ==Ohio House of Representatives== In 2016, Representative Cheryl Grossman was term-limited, and while competitive on paper, Republicans were favored to hold the seat. Initially Mike Lanese opted to run, and won the Republican nomination for the seat. However, he eventually stepped down, and Franklin County Republicans were able to replace him on the ballot with Laura Lanese. While Democrats put considerable resources behind Democrat Lee Schreiner, Lanese won the seat handily by a nearly 58% to 42% margin. She was sworn in for her first term on January 3, 2017. == References == ==External links== *Ohio State Representative Laura Lanese official site *campaign site Category:Living people Category:Miami University alumni Category:Ohio State University alumni Category:Members of the Ohio House of Representatives Category:Ohio Republicans Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Women state legislators in Ohio Category:21st-century American women politicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:People from Grove City, Ohio Category:Georgetown University Law Center alumni ",
