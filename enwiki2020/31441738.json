Most often he has painted mariners and coastal landscapes. ==Biography== Carl Wallin was born in Svanshall, a little fishing village in the western Sk\u00e4lderviken in Malm\u00f6hus County in northwest of Sk\u00e5ne County, about 25 kilometers north of Helsingborg, the nearest village to the south is Jonstorp. He grew up in an old seamen\u2019s family, his father was the sea captain J\u00f6ns Andersson and his mother was Annette Wallin. His father was captain in the barque Netten, which disappeared in the North Atlantic with men and everything in 1893, the same year he was born. In 1904, when he was 11 years old, his mother died too. He grew up with his grandmother. In 1925 he married Anna Greta Ingeborg J\u00f6nsson. As soon as he had left school he went to sea. Wallin took his master mariner degree in 1914 and then he served shipping company Transmarin AB as an officer and commander. He got an interest to start painting in 1935. He was inspired by a steward on board the boat, which he commanded, and who painted landscapes as a hobby. He bought a box of colors and a piece of canvas by the meter and started painting. In 1940 he left sea in order to devote his time to marine painting. Now he was marin painter full time. As a painter he was self-taught. His ambition was to render any ship technically correct and its movements in the sea and the rhythm of the waves. On the stretched canvas he sketched the ship and the rhythm of the waves with charcoal and chalk. Then he made a painting in brown and ochre. ==Artistry== A bottle of Cutty Sark Scotch Whisky and its box with the drawing by Carl Wallin on the label.

Shipping Company Nordstjernan AB:sv:Nordstjernan AB Nordstjernan AB (Swedish) ordered some 30 paintings by Wallin. Carl Wallin painted some 700 ship paintings, most of them named with the names of the ships, usually full-rigged ship,A full-rigged ship or fully rigged ship is a sailing vessel with three or more masts, all of them square rigged. A full- rigged ship is said to have a ship rig. Sometimes such a vessel will merely be called a \"ship\", particularly in 18th- to early-19th-century and earlier usage, to distinguish it from other vessels such as schooners, barques, barquentines, brigs, et cetera. Alternately, a full-rigged ship may be referred to by its function instead, as in collier or frigate, rather than being called a ship. In many languages the word frigate or frigate rig refers to a full-rigged ship. but he has also painted marine compositions and coastal landscapes. Many of the great shipping companies of that time commissioned paintings of their ships by Carl Wallin.

The figurehead of the tea clipper Cutty Sark is named after the character. The earliest recorded literary usage of the term cutty sark (as opposed to older usage of the two separate words) is by Dougal Graham in c. 1779 (the year of his death): \"A cutty sark of guide harn sheet, My mitter he pe spin, mattam.\" Etymology: Cutty or cuttie (the diminutive form of cuttit, from Early Middle English cutte, kutte, cute \"ugly\") is \"short\" or \"stumpy\". Sark or serk (from Old English serc; Old Norse serk) is a \"shift\", \"chemise\", or \"shirt\".The Cutty Sark is a clipper ship. Built in 1869, she served as a merchant vessel (the last clipper to be built for that purpose), and then as a training ship until being put on public display in 1954. She is preserved in dry dock in Greenwich, London.
