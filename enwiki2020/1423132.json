The channel is owned by Corus Entertainment. ==History== On May 11, 1999, Alliance Atlantis Communications (AAC) and Premier Choix Networks (a division of Astral Media) were granted approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a French-language subscription network called Canal Fiction, described as a \"service devoted to drama.\"Decision CRTC 99-109 The channel was launched on January 31, 2000 as S\u00e9ries+ at 6pm EST.LES CHAINES TELE ASTRAL AND ALLIANCE ATLANTIS PRESENT A NEW FRENCH LANGUAGE SPECIALTY CHANNEL Alliance Atlantis press release 2000-01-19 On October 30, 2006, S\u00e9ries+ launched a high definition simulcast.La haute d\u00e9finition en fran\u00e7ais Infopresse 2006-10-30 On January 18, 2008, a joint venture between Canwest and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners known as CW Media purchased AAC and gained AAC's interest in S\u00e9ries+.

The purchase was tied to Bell Media's pending takeover of Astral Media; an earlier proposal had been rejected by the CRTC in October 2012 due to concerns surrounding its total market share following the merger, but was restructured under the condition that the companies divest certain media properties. In a separate deal, Corus also acquired Shaw's interests in S\u00e9ries+ and Historia, giving it full ownership. The deals were approved by the CRTC on 20 December 2013 and Corus officially become the full owner of the channel on 1 January 2014. On October 17, 2017, Bell Media announced its intent to acquire S\u00e9ries+ and Historia from Corus for $200 million, pending regulatory approval. Corus cited the two channels as not being part of the company's \"strategic priorities\" at this time; the deal came shortly after an announcement that Corus no longer planned to commission original programs for the two channels. On 28 May 2018, both transactions were blocked by the Competition Bureau, as it violated a condition of the Astral Media purchase which bars Bell from re-acquiring any of the properties it divested for 10 years. As a result, Bell and Corus mutually agreed to shelve the sale. On January 6, 2020, the channel was rebranded as S\u00e9riesPlus, to coincide with the channel's 20th anniversary on January 31. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Analog cable television networks in Canada Category:Corus Entertainment Category:Television channels and stations established in 2000 Category:French-language television networks in Canada ",
