    "text": "Sportin\u2019 Life is the sixth and final studio album by the rock band Mink DeVille, released in 1985. Since the band\u2019s third album, 1981\u2019s Le Chat Bleu, when the original members of the band departed, lead singer and composer Willy DeVille had been assembling musicians to record and tour under the name Mink DeVille. After Sportin\u2019 Life, Willy DeVille began recording and touring under his own name. The album was recorded for Polydor at the Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. As he had done on Le Chat Bleu, DeVille wrote some songs with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Doc Pomus. Members of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section -- Roger Hawkins (drums), David Hood (bass), and Jimmy Johnson (guitar) -- played on the album. Except for saxophonist Louis Cortelezzi, none of the musicians had played with Willy DeVille before. The song \u201cItalian Shoes\u201d was a hit in Europe.Eagle Rock Entertainment (2007) \"DeVille, Willy.\" Web site of Eagle Rock Entertainment. (Retrieved 3-8-08.) ==Reviews== Trouser Press said about the album, \u201cSportin' Life maintains (high) standards with a set of brand-new oldies that effortlessly evoke the bygone era of sweet soul music. 'Something Beautiful Dying' (note The Righteous Brothers reference) is tenderly melancholic; 'Little by Little' tries barrelhouse rockabilly; 'Italian Shoes' is classic bad dude strutting. Apt self-production and a sharp backing band make this first-rate.\u201dEditors (2006) \u201cMink Deville/Willy Deville.\u201d Trouser Press. (Retrieved 3-16-08.) Allmusic thought that the album suffered from overproduction and a lack of verve: \"Sportin' Life is for the hardcore fan only, one who can appreciate DeVille\u2019s canny and soulful songwriting that almost gets through this abortion of a production job.\u201dJurek, Thom (2007) [ \u201cReview: Sportin\u2019 Life.\u201d] AllMusic (Retrieved 3-16-08.). However, David Wild of Rolling Stone praised Sportin' Life, calling it \"the most modern, polished sound of (Willy DeVille's) career.\" He added, \"Pushed to center stage, DeVille delivers, singing with more passion and more personality than ever before... The songwriting is uniformly solid. 'In the Heart of the City' takes DeVille down a side street of Springsteen's musical neighborhood, and the album- closing 'Something Beautiful Is Dying' is a wonderfully overwrought ballad of heartbreaking elegance.\"Wild, David (March 27, 1986) \"Sportin' Life: Mink DeVille.\" Rolling Stone, p. 114-115. ==Collaboration with Doc Pomus== In Lonely Avenue, a biography of Doc Pomus, Alex Halberstadt wrote about the DeVille-Pomus composition \"Something Beautiful Dying\": ==Track listing== Unless otherwise noted, all songs by Willy DeVille. # \u201cIn the Heart of the City\u201c - 3:19 # \u201cI Must Be Dreaming\u201c - 4:21 # \u201cItalian Shoes\u201c - 4:23 # \u201cSlip Away\u201c - 4:06 # \u201cWhen You Walk My Way\u201c - (Willy DeVille, Doc Pomus) - 3:24 # \u201cA Woman's Touch\u201c - 3:18 # \u201cEasy Street\u201c - 3:30 # \u201cLittle By Little\u201c - 2:28 # \u201cThere's No Living (Without Your Loving)\u201c - (Jerry Harris, Paul Kaufman) - 3:21 # \u201cSomething Beautiful Dying\u201c \u2013 (Willy DeVille, Doc Pomus) - 3:39 ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1985) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|72 |} ==Personnel== *Ava Aldridge - background vocals *Albert Boekholt - emulator *Mickey Buckins - percussion *Duncan Cameron - guitar, cuatro, background vocals *Louis Cortelezzi - saxophone *Willy DeVille - vocals, background vocals *Roger Hawkins - drums *David Hood - bass *Jim Horn - saxophone *Wayne Jackson - trumpet *Jimmy Johnson - guitar *Boris Kinberg - percussion *Micro Mini - background vocals *Steve Nathan - keyboards *Cindy Richardson - background vocals *Charles Rose - trombone *Harvey Thompson - saxophone *Mink DeVille Band (Kenny Margolis, Ricky Borgia, Louis Cortelezzi, Boris Kinberg, Shawn Murray, Bob Curiano) *Joe Elliott, Steve Clark, & Phil Collen of Def Leppard provided backing vocals for \"Italian Shoes\". ===Production=== * Michael Barnett - executive producer * Duncan Cameron - co-producer * Willy DeVille - producer * Ronald Prent - recording engineer * Charles Rose - arranger * Greg Smith - arranger ==References== Category:1985 albums Category:Mink DeVille albums Category:Polydor Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio ",
