    "text": "Ezekiel's \"chariot vision\", by Matthaeus Merian (1593-1650). Ezekiel's Wheel Ezekiel's encounter with the Merkabah and the Living Creatures The living creatures, living beings, or hayyoth (Hebrew \u05d7\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea chayot) are a class of heavenly beings in Jewish mythology. They are described in the prophet Ezekiel's vision of the heavenly chariot in the first and tenth chapters of the Book of Ezekiel. References to the creatures recur in texts of Second Temple Judaism, in rabbinical merkabah (\"chariot\") literature, in the Book of Revelation in the New Testament, and in the Zohar. According to Jewish and Christian traditions, there are four living creatures, although their description varies by source. The symbolic depiction of the four living creatures in religious art, especially Christian art, is called a tetramorph. ==Ezekiel's four living creatures== Ezekiel's vision of the four living creatures in are identified as cherubim in who are God's throne bearers. Cherubim as minor guardian deities of temple or palace thresholds are known all over the Ancient East. Each of Ezekiel's cherubim have four faces, that of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. However, their human shape appearances set them apart from the griffin-like cherubs and lamassu of Babylonia and Assyria. In their ability to move, Ezekiel's cherubim do not need to turn, since they face all compass points simultaneously. This description of movement differs from the seraphim in Isaiah's vision () who have an extra set of wings for their ability to fly. ==Revelation's four living beings== In , four living beings (Greek: \u03b6\u1ff7\u03bf\u03bd, z\u014dion) are seen in John's vision. These appear as a lion, an ox, a man, and an eagle, much as in Ezekiel but in a different order. They have six wings, whereas Ezekiel's four living creatures are described as only having four. In verse 6, they are said to have \"eyes all over, front and back\", suggesting that they are alert and knowledgeable, that nothing escapes their notice. The description parallels the wheels that are beside the living creatures in Ezekiel 1.18; 10.12, which are said to be \"full of eyes all around\". The Hebrew word for \"wheel\" (\u00f4pann\u00eem) was also used in later Jewish literature to indicate a member of the angelic orders (1 Enoch 71.7; 3 Enoch 1.8; 7.1; 25.5-6, etc.). In this passage in Revelation, the four beasts surround \"the one\" on the red throne (which is of ruby and sardius), which is contrasted with the white throne in and . Comparing the living creatures in Ezekiel with Revelation's is a prominent apocalyptic study in Western Christianity. An example is the 18th Century works of Jonathan Edwards' recorded interpretation of 1722/23. The four living creatures that John of Patmos sees in the Book of Revelation, is the author's reworking of the living creatures in the visions of Ezekiel () and Isaiah (). William D. Mounce noted a belief that the living creatures may have been associated with the four principal (or fixed) signs of the zodiac (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius), but other scholars have doubted this interpretation. In a critical analysis of John's vision, April De Conick's 2006 essay outlines that the hayyot in Ezekiel are perhaps not original with the author of Revelation. De Conick suggests that John may have drawn from other merkabah-related texts and by subtly working with images already known to his audience, he reshaped them for his own purposes. With John blending and transforming the images of his sources, it has given way to different interpretations. ==Religious views== In Judaism, the living beings are considered angels of fire, who hold up the throne of God. According to the Zohar, they hold up the firmament itself.Noach 261\u2013265, Zohar. They are ranked first in Maimonides' Jewish angelic hierarchy. In Christianity, the four living creatures are Cherubim. A prominent early interpretation, variously modified by different interpreters, has been to equate the four creatures with the Four Evangelists. Throughout church history, the most common interpretation (first laid out by Victorinus), but not the original or the only, is that the lion represents Mark, the calf Luke, the man Matthew, and the eagle John. Irenaeus was the first to make the association with the evangelists, but the interpretation laid out by Victorinus and adopted by Jerome, Gregory the Great, and the Book of Kells became dominant. Its influence has been on art and sculpture and is still prevalent in Catholicism and Anglicanism. A view held by many modern commentators is that the four living creatures of Revelation are agents of God and heavenly representatives of the created order, who call every living thing to worship the Creator. The four living creatures are identified by some scholars as hybrids (see human-animal hybrids).James L. Resseguie, \"A Glossary of New Testament Narrative Criticism with Illustrations,\" in Religions, 10 (3) 217), 5-6. On this interpretation, the creatures merge traits of the world above (six wings; eyes in front and behind and around and inside) with character traits from this world (lion, ox, human, eagle). They represent the world above and this world in complete harmony with its Creator. By contrast, the locusts from the abyss (cf. Rev. 9:3-11) combine traits of the world below with this world and represent the creation in rebellion from its Creator. ==See also== * Anemoi * Related Bible parts: Isaiah 6, Ezekiel 1, Ezekiel 10, Daniel 7, Revelation 4, Revelation 20 * Eye of Horus * Four Dwarves (Norse Mythology) * Four Heavenly Kings * Four sons of Horus * Four Stags (Norse Mythology) * Great Year * Guardians of the directions * Lokapala * Titan (mythology) ==References== ==External links== * Jewish Encyclopedia: Angelology Category:Angels in Christianity Category:Angels in Judaism Category:Book of Ezekiel Category:Classes of angel ",
