Tryvannst\u00e5rnet was built in 1962 and has an observation deck at a height of 60 metres (197 feet), from which, weather conditions permitting, the view extends to the border with Sweden and Gaustatoppen mountain. The observation deck was closed in 2005 because of new fire safety regulations which would have required expensive modifications which coincided with rapidly declining visitor numbers. In the 1980s and 1990s annual visitor numbers averaged 100,000, but in the last year it was open to the public, only 25,000. There is a large underground shelter beneath Tryvannst\u00e5rnet. ==References== * ==External links== * Web camera in the tower rotates slowly to give 360\u00b0 view Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1962 Category:Towers in Norway Category:Buildings and structures in Oslo Category:1962 establishments in Norway Category:Norkring Category:Transmitter sites in Norway ",
