    "text": "The Ellis Unit housed the State of Texas death row for men until mid-1999. Allan B. Polunsky Unit houses the State of Texas death row for men. Kenneth Eugene Foster Jr. (born October 22, 1976) is a prisoner formerly on death row in Texas, convicted under the Texas law of parties. At 19 years old, he was convicted of murdering Michael LaHood Jr. on August 15, 1996 at 2:46 AM, despite not firing a shot. He was driving with three friends (Julius Steen, Mauriceo Brown, and Dwayne Dillard) committing some robberies, when Mauriceo Brown allegedly exited the car, and shot and killed Michael LaHood Jr. Foster's conviction and execution were contested because he was convicted under the law of parties, not for physically committing the crime. Foster, Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) death row #999232, was received on death row on July 1, 1997. He was initially located in the Ellis Unit, but was transferred to the Allan B. Polunsky Unit (formerly the Terrell Unit) in 1999. Texas Governor Rick Perry commuted the death sentence to 40 years to life imprisonment only six hours before the execution was scheduled to take place on August 30, 2007. Foster will be eligible for parole in 2036. He is currently incarcerated at the Stiles Facility of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and is assigned to the facility's administrative segregation. Mauriceo Brown, the man who pulled the trigger on Michael LaHood Jr., was executed on July 19, 2006. ==References== ==External links== * \"Free Kenneth Foster\" website * Kenneth Foster Interview, July 25, 2007 (Archive.org) * \"Lone Star Statement - poem performed by Kenneth Foster on Death Row\" (Video) * \"I Am a Killer\" - Season 1, Episode 2 (Kenneth Foster) on Netflix Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:American prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Texas Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:American people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by Texas Category:Recipients of American gubernatorial clemency ",
