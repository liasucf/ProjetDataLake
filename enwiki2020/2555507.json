    "text": "Double drumming (sometimes referred to as double drums) is a musical technique, used mostly in rock music, where two drummers each play a drum kit at the same time. One may play the rhythm while the other may play another style, or both may play the same rhythm. It is more common to have a main drummer with an auxiliary percussionist who plays Latin American percussion, toms, or mallet percussion, but this is not considered \"double drumming\". Featuring two drummers has been common in jazz music, in particular in free jazz. ==List of bands including double drumming/additional percussionists == ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead performing in 2005 The Doobie Brothers in concert on August 31, 2006 Genesis performing in 2007 The Grateful Dead in 1980 * * 38 Special (two drummers:1974-87) * ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead * ABBA (two drummers during their 1977 Australian Tour) * Adam and the Ants 1980\u20131982.
