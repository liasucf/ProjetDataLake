It was officially opened on 26 October 1913 in the Luang Building on Bamrung Muang Road as the Pastura Institute after Louis Pasteur, who discovered the first vaccine against rabies.

The new buildings were officially opened on 7 December 1922, now named for the king's mother, Queen Saovabha Phongsri. At the same time, the institute's first director, Dr. Leopold Robert, requested contributions from foreigners living in Thailand for the establishment of a snake farm, which would enable the institute to manufacture antivenom for snake bites. Reportedly the second snake farm in the world after the one in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, it was opened on 22 November 1923 by Queen Savang Vadhana, then President of the Thai Red Cross, on the institute's premises.http://saovabha.redcross.or.th/download/2558/R2558_062558_P6.PDF Research into snake venom is highly important, since many people fall victim to venomous snake bites. Normally only an antidote that is based from the same snake's venom can save the individual's life. The snake farm houses thousands of some of the most venomous snakes in the world, such as the king cobra and all sorts of vipers. Visitors can see handlers interact with pythons, and venom extractions can be seen. There is also a museum, and lectures are given. The QSMI and the snake farm are near Chulalongkorn Hospital, on the corner of Henri Dunant Road and Rama IV Road. ==References== ==External links== * FactZoo.com | Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute's Visitors Brochure * Thai Red Cross | Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute * Bangkok Metropolitan Administration | Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute * Out About Bangkok | Queen Saovapha Memorial Institute (includes details of institute's work) * Blurrytravel.com | Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (includes photos) * Thailandguidebook.com | Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (includes photos) * Virtualtourist.com | Bangkok Travel Guide (includes reviews and photos) Category:Snakes Category:Tourist attractions in Bangkok Category:Research institutes in Thailand Category:Biological research institutes Category:Pathum Wan District Category:Museums in Bangkok Category:ASA Architectural Conservation Award recipients Category:Unregistered ancient monuments in Bangkok ",
