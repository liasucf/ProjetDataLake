In 1935 its assets were sold following the financial collapse of S T D Motors in 1934. The coachbuilding business was bought by the Rootes brothers and lost its separate identity. ==Purpose== In 1916 the board of A Darracq and Company (1905) Limited (later S T D Motors) elected to rearrange ownership of its Suresnes, Paris plant and the Darracq distribution system in London.

After incorporation Darracq Motor Engineering Company added to its British assets ownership of the Darracq land in France on which their Suresnes plant was situated. Darracq Motor Engineering then leased it to a new French company, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Darracq, incorporated to hold all the other French assets formerly held directly by A Darracq and Company (1905) Limited. A Darracq and Company (1905) (soon to be renamed S T D Motors) was then reduced to a non-trading company holding ownership of the various French and British businesses. ==Activities== Talbot AX65, body by Darracq After the 1918 Armistice the Fulham Works once again made motor car bodies for Darracqs and continued to assemble French-sourced components. After 1920 offices and showrooms in The Vale, Acton at the intersection with Warple Way were shared with W & G Du Cros another group member.

Rebadging of SA Talbot cars sent from Suresnes to Britain continued after the dissolution of Darracq Motor Engineering because Cl\u00e9ment-Talbot's British business remained active. In 1938 Cl\u00e9ment-Talbot's name was changed to Sunbeam-Talbot. After twenty years its products dropped Talbot from their badges in 1954. === Cars manufactured in Suresnes, Paris (1919\u20131938) === ;at first badged Talbot Darracq and later Darracq for sale in Britain 1920 Talbot-Darracq 4.6-litre 20hp V8 drophead coup\u00e9 built in France and branded Talbot-Darracq for distribution from London as well as retailing by Darracq Motor Engineering Company :Information assembled from The Autocar Buyer's Guide and published in Appendix V, Ian Nickols and Kent Karslake, Motoring Entente, Cassell, London 1956 1924 Darracq 12/32 Sport Cloverleaf in Sweden 1936 Talbot Darracq T150C {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 75%; text-align: center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | years ! scope=\"col\" | name (French) ! scope=\"col\" | disp ! scope=\"col\" | cyl's ! scope=\"col\" | bore / stroke ! scope=\"col\" | RAC tax hp ! scope=\"col\" | bhp ! scope=\"col\" | gear box ! scope=\"col\" | wheelbase ! scope=\"col\" | track |- | 1920-1921 ! scope=\"row\" | 20 (A) | 4594 | V8 | 75 x 130 | 27.9 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1920, 1922 ! scope=\"row\" | 16 (V14) | 2938 | 4 | 85 x 130 | 17.9 | \u2014 |4 | | |- | 1921 ! scope=\"row\" | 14 | 2297 | 4 | 75 x 130 | 14 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1922 ! scope=\"row\" | 8 | 970 | 4 | 57 x 95 | 8 | \u2014 | 3 | | |- | 1922 ! scope=\"row\" | 12 | 1460 | 4 | 65 x 110 | 10.5 | \u2014 | 3 | | |- | 1922 ! scope=\"row\" | 27.9 (A) | 4594 | V8 | 75 x 130 | 27.9 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1923 ! scope=\"row\" | 8/18 | 970 | 4 | 57 x 95 | 8 | \u2014 | 3 | | |- | 1923 ! scope=\"row\" | 12/32 (DC) | 1598 | 4 | 68 x 110 | 11.5 | \u2014 | 3 | | |- | 1923 ! scope=\"row\" | 18/36 | 2938 | 4 | 85 x 130 | 17.9 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1923 ! scope=\"row\" | 20/40 | 3230 | 4 | 89 x 130 | 19.6 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1923 ! scope=\"row\" | 28/70 | 4594 | V8 | 75 x 130 | 27.9 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1924 ! scope=\"row\" | 15/40 (DS) | 2121 | 4 | 75 x 120 | 14 | \u2014 | 3 | | |- | 1924-1926 ! scope=\"row\" | 12/32 (DC) | 1598 | 4 | 68 x 110 | 11.5 | \u2014 | 3 | | |- | 1926-1927 ! scope=\"row\" | 15/40 | 2294 | 4 | 78 x 120 | 15.9 | \u2014 | 3 | | |- | 1926-1927 ! scope=\"row\" | 17/75 | 2540 | 6 | 70 x110 | 18.2 | \u2014 | 3 / 4 | | |- | 1927\u20131928 ! scope=\"row\" | 12/40 | 1669 | 4 | 69.5 x 110 | 12 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1927\u20131928 ! scope=\"row\" | 20/98 | 2916 | 6 | 75 x 110 | 20.9 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1928 ! scope=\"row\" | 16 (M67) | 1999 | 4 | 67 x 94.5 | 16.7 | \u2014 |4 | | |- | 1929-1930 ! scope=\"row\" | 16 (M67) | 1999 | 4 | 67 x 94.5 | 16.7 | \u2014 |4 | | |- | 1929-1930 ! scope=\"row\" | 20 (K74) | 2440 | 6 | 74 x 94.5 | 20.4 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1929-1930 ! scope=\"row\" | 20 (T) | 2916 | 6 | 75 x 110 | 20.9 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1930 ! scope=\"row\" | 30 | 3823 | St8 | 78 x 100 | 30.2 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1931 ! scope=\"row\" | 20.9 | 2504 | 6 | 75 x 94.5 | 20.9 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1931 ! scope=\"row\" | 22.6 | 2866 | 6 | 78 x 100 | 22.6 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1931\u20131933 ! scope=\"row\" | 30.1 | 3823 | St8 | 78 x 100 | 30.2 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1932 ! scope=\"row\" | 16 (M67) | 1999 | 4 | 67 x 94.5 | 16.7 | \u2014 |4 | | |- | 1932 ! scope=\"row\" | 20 | 2504 | 6 | 75 x 94.5 | 20.9 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1932 ! scope=\"row\" | 22 | 2866 | 6 | 78 x 100 | 22.6 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1932-1933 ! scope=\"row\" | 30 | 3823 | St8 | 78 x 100 | 30.2 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1933 ! scope=\"row\" | 16 (M67) | 1999 | 4 | 67 x 94.5 | 16.7 | \u2014 |4 | | |- | 1933-1934 ! scope=\"row\" | 20 | 2504 | 6 | 75 x 94.5 | 20.9 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- | 1934 ! scope=\"row\" | 16 (L67) | 1999 | 4 | 67 x 94.5 | 16.7 | \u2014 |4 | | |- | 1934 ! scope=\"row\" | 28 | 3563 | 8 | 75 x 100 | 27.9 | \u2014 | 4 | / | |- | 1936\u20131936 ! scope=\"row\" | 16.7 | 1999 | 6 | 67 x 94.5 | 16.7 | \u2014 | 4 | | |- |} ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Talbot-Darracq 1921 models (from) Darracq Motor Engineering * 1938 Darracq and Lago brochure issued by D.A.R.A.
