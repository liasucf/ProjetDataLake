    "text": "Haider Ali (born 12 November 1979) is a Pakistani retired professional boxer who fought in the featherweight division. He is a Commonwealth Games gold medalist and an Olympian. == Early Life & Amateur Career == Haider started boxing at an early age, having decided to become a boxer after watching fellow countryman Hussain Shah win a bronze medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Haider became the National Champion in 1998 whist winning gold medals in the Green Hill International Boxing Tournament held at Karachi in 1998 and the Imam Khomeini International Boxing Tournament held in Iran in 1999. Additionally, Haider won a bronze medal in the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, losing in the semi-finals to Indonesia's Hermensen Ballo. Representing Pakistan, Haider won a gold medal in the featherweight division in 1999 South Asian Games. Haider Ali qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney but was defeated 5-4 by 1992 Summer Olympics bronze-medallist Ramazan Palyani in the Round of 32. Haider won a bronze medal at the 24th Kings Cup boxing tournament in Bangkok being defeated by Thailand's Suttisak Samaksaman 7-3 in the semi-finals. In 2002, Haider Ali defeated Thailand's Suttisak Samaksaman in the finals to win the gold medal in the Asian Championships which were held in Malaysia. He received the award of 'The Best Boxer of the Tournament' for the Asian Championships. Haider won Pakistan's first gold medal in the any Commonwealth Games by defeating India's Som Bahadur Pun by a margin of 28-10 in a four-round final in the featherweight division of 2002 Commonwealth Games which was held in Manchester. Following his victory in the 2002 Commonwealth Games, Haider received the Order of Merit from the government of Pakistan along with gifts such as a Jeep, house as well as a golden Kalashnikov rifle. == Pro Career == In 2003, Haider moved to Leyton in East London and signed Frank Warren as his manager and embarked upon a professional boxing career. During his medical, he was found to have two perforated eardrums. The fact that he was able to box at the level he had without it affecting his performance was notable. After undergoing surgery, Haider made his professional debut defeating Buster Dennis via points at York Hall on the undercard of Merdud Takaloo's WBU light-middleweight title defence against Jose Rosa Gomez. Haider went on to beat both Jason Nesbitt and Jus Wallie via points in his debut year as a professional boxer. However, he was not able to keep his early success going and lost his fourth fight against Stevie Bell via points. In 2005, Haider knocked undefeated prospect and 2002 Commonweight Games lightweight gold medallist Jamie Arthur out via a clash of heads. Haider then lost his sixth fight to future three-division world champion Ricky Burns and subsequently was dropped by Frank Warren\u2019s Sports Network. Haider then moved to Walsall and attempted to restart his boxing career, but following a further loss to journeyman Daniel Thorpe and a points victory against Kristian Laight, Haider's boxing career ended with a points draw against journeyman Carl Allen. == Post-fight Career == Following his retirement, Haider coached boxing within the UK for over 10 years and is currently the head boxing coach at Kings Boxing Gym in Perth, Australia. == Professional boxing record == {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |9 | Draw |5\u20133-1 |align=\"left\" | Carl Allen |PTS |4 |25 Mar 2006 |align=\"left\" | | |- |8 | Win |5\u20133 | align=\"left\" | Kristian Laight |PTS |4 |16 Feb 2006 |align=\"left\" | | |- |7 | Loss |4\u20133 |align=\"left\" | Daniel Thorpe | |4 (6), |25 Nov 2005 |align=\"left\" | | |- |6 | Loss |4\u20132 |align=\"left\" | Ricky Burns |PTS |8 |17 Jun 2005 |align=\"left\" | | |- |5 | Win |4\u20131 |align=\"left\" | Jamie Arthur | |3 (6), |21 Jan 2005 |align=\"left\" | | |- |4 | Loss |3\u20131 |align=\"left\" | Stevie Bell |PTS |6 |22 May 2004 |align=\"left\" | | |- |3 | Win |3\u20130 |align=\"left\" | Jus Wallie |PTS |4 |29 Nov 2003 |align=\"left\" | | |- |2 | Win |2\u20130 | align=\"left\" | Jason Nesbitt |PTS |4 |17 Jul 2003 |align=\"left\" | | |- |1 | Win |1\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Buster Dennis | |4 |24 May 2003 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |} ==References== == External links == * Pro record * * Fiery Ali ready to deliver * Determined Ali makes untimely comeback bid * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Pakistani male boxers Category:Olympic boxers of Pakistan Category:Boxers at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Commonwealth Games gold medallists for Pakistan Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in boxing Category:Boxers at the 2002 Commonwealth Games Category:Asian Games medalists in boxing Category:Asian Games bronze medalists for Pakistan Category:Boxers at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1998 Asian Games Category:Hazara people Category:Hazara sportspeople Category:Sportspeople from Quetta Category:Recipients of the Pride of Performance Category:South Asian Games gold medalists for Pakistan Category:Featherweight boxers Category:South Asian Games medalists in boxing ",
