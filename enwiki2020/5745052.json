    "text": "\"A Rose and a Baby Ruth\" is a song written by John D. Loudermilk under his \"Johnny Dee\" pseudonym. The song was published in 1956. The best-known version was recorded by George Hamilton IV. The song reached number 6 on the Billboard magazine pop chart and spent 20 weeks on the chart. \"A Rose and a Baby Ruth\" showed regional appeal in country music, foreshadowing Hamilton's highly successful career, in the 1960s. == Chart performance == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Billboard predicted it would be a close race between the two recordings, but the Decca release did not make even the lower part of Billboard\u00b4s Top 100. Johnny Maestro & The Crests did a version in 1960 for their first album, \"The Crests Sing All Biggies\" - (Coed LP 901). Al Kooper covered it on his 1970 Columbia release \"Easy Does It\". The song was covered by Marilyn Manson as a bonus studio track on the limited edition version of The Last Tour On Earth live album in 1999. == Singles == === By George Hamilton IV === *(1956) A Rose and a Baby Ruth/If You Don't Know-ABC Paramount Records *(1956) A Rose and a Baby Ruth/If You Don't Know-Colonial Records With the Country Gentlemen, Featuring Joe Tanner on guitar == References == ==External links== * * Category:Songs written by John D.
