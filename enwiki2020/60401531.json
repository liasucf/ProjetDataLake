    "text": "Convent of the Sacred Heart High School is a private, independent high school in the city of San Francisco, rooted in the Catholic tradition. It is located at 2222 Broadway. The school offers its students the rigorous International Baccalaureate program (IB) as well as an array of Advanced Placement courses (AP). As of 2019, the annual tuition for grades 9\u201312 is $45,900. Admission is selective and approximately 30% of the student body receives some form of financial aid. The school was originally founded by Mother Mary Keating on August 16, 1887 as the first Schools of the Sacred Heart Academy west of the Rockies. The first year enrolled 30 young women operating in two rented Victorians at the corner of Bush and Octavia. The founding organization is known as the Schools of the Sacred Heart, San Francisco. In 1888, they purchased a larger building at Franklin and Ellis for $10 in gold coin. They stayed there until the 1906 Earthquake when the building was heavily damaged. Renting another Victorian at the corner of Washington and Octavia, they were one of the first institutions to reopen after the earthquake. In 1909, the school purchased the Van Arsdale house on Jackson Street where the school remained until 1939. In June 1939, Maud Lee Flood donated the home she had shared with her deceased husband at 2222 Broadway. During WWII, boys were allowed to join the lower school. By 1948 they needed more room to expand, they courted a deal to purchase the Grant house for $150,000, well below market value. The lower school, grades 1-8 split to the new location, while the upper school remained at the Flood Mansion. But what to do with the boys? In 1956, they purchased the Hammond House for $165,000 to open Stuart Hall for Boys.https://www.sacredsf.org/about/history-network-of-sacred-heart-schools The school now operates in partnership with the all boy's Stuart Hall High School located at 1715 Octavia Street. Typically the first two years, freshmen and sophomore year, are spent single sex but then become co-ed by junior year and higher level courses. The unique partnership allows both schools to operate both single-sex and coeducational classes. Coed classes are held on both campuses and student shuttle buses operate between the two. The partnership is referred to as Convent & Stuart Hall.https://issuu.com/productioncsf/docs/csf-9-10-04 ==References== Category:Girls' schools in California Category:Catholic secondary schools in California Category:Educational institutions established in 1887 Category:High schools in San Francisco Category:Sacred Heart schools in the United States Category:Private K-12 schools in California ",
