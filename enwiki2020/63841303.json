Dover and other officers, particularly non-Chinese, were criticised for their handling of the protests while also targeted with harassment and doxing.

The property is built on government land, on conditions where residents are prohibited from selling, trading, or leasing out their houses. On 4 May, the Lands Department sent ten officials to inspect Dover's home to investigate. On 26 May, the Land Department substantiated the allegations of illicit expansion works at Dover's residence, giving the licence holder one month to rectify the situation with respect to the illegal structures. Police Commissioner Chris Tang has accused Apple Daily's investigations on senior officers as being retaliation for the 18 April arrest of the paper's founder Jimmy Lai. == Personal life == Rupert Dover is married to Cheung Ngar-sze (; also known as Sze Dover), a sergeant in the Hong Kong Police Force. ==See also== == References == Category:Living people Category:1967 births Category:Hong Kong police officers Category:People from Hertford Category:English emigrants to Hong Kong Category:British colonial police officers ",
