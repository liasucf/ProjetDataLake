Hazcams (short for hazard avoidance cameras) are photographic cameras mounted on the front and rear of NASA's Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity rover missions to Mars and on the lower front portion of Chinese Yutu rover mission to the Moon. ==Overview== The Curiosity rover's hazcams are sensitive to visible light and return black and white images of resolution 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels.\"Hazard Avoidance Camera (Hazcam)\". PDS Geosciences Node. Retrieved September 4, 2019. These images are used by the rovers' internal computer to autonomously navigate around hazards. Due to their positioning on both sides of the rovers, simultaneous images taken by either both front or both rear cameras can be used to produce a 3D map of the immediate surroundings. As the cameras are fixed (i.e. can not move independently of the rover), they have a wide field of view (approximately 120\u00b0 both horizontally and vertically) to allow a large amount of terrain to be visible. They are considered engineering cameras since they were not designed to be used for scientific experiments. The other set of engineering cameras on the rovers are the navcams. The safe landing of the Mars Science Laboratory was initially confirmed using the vehicle's hazcams. ==See also== *Astrionics *List of NASA cameras on spacecraft *Mars rover *Navigation Camera (Navcam) *Panoramic Camera (Pancam) ==References== ==External links== *NASA page detailing the rovers' \"senses\" *Mars Exploration Rover Technical Data Category:Mars Science Laboratory instruments Category:Mars Exploration Rover mission Category:Spacecraft instruments Category:Mars imagers ",
