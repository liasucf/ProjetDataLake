    "text": "In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), Brown-Rho (BR) scaling is an approximate scaling law for hadrons in an ultra-hot, ultra-dense medium, such as hadrons in the quark epoch during the first microsecond of the Big Bang or within neutron stars. arXiv preprint According to Gerald E. Brown and Mannque Rho in their 1991 publication in Physical Review Letters: In the preceding equation, refers to the pole mass of the \u03c1 meson, whereas refers to the in-medium mass arXiv preprint (or running mass in the medium) of the \u03c1 meson according to QCD sum rules. arXiv preprint The omega meson, sigma meson, and neutron are denoted by \u03c9, \u03c3, and N, respectively. The symbol denotes the free-space pion decay constant. (Decay constants have a \"running time\" and a \"pole time\" similar to the \"running mass\" and \"pole mass\" concepts, according to special relativity.) The symbol is also used to denote the pion decay constant. arXiv preprint The hypothesis of Brown-Rho scaling is supported by experimental evidence on beta decay of 14C to the 14N ground state. ==See also== *Quantum chromodynamics *QCD matter ==References== Category:Quantum chromodynamics ",
