    "text": "Pharmacy is the debut studio album by Swedish electronic music duo Galantis, released on 8 June 2015. The album features six singles (\"Runaway (U & I)\", \"You\", \"Peanut Butter Jelly\", \"Gold Dust\", \"In My Head\" and \"Louder, Harder, Better\"). ==Artwork== Overall, four \"Seafoxes\" are included in the album artwork. The cover features a unique Seafox, only seen on the album artwork. The booklet features a Seafox also used for the \"You\" single artwork, and also appears on the cover of the Galantis EP. The inside panel of the digipak features a Seafox used for the \"Peanut Butter Jelly\" single artwork, and also the YouTube audio for \"Louder, Harder, Better\". Behind the CD tray is a Seafox also used to front the \"Gold Dust\" single artwork, and also appears on the cover of the Galantis EP. The booklet included also includes a picture of Galantis themselves (Christian \"Bloodshy\" Karlsson, Linus \"Style of Eye\" Ekl\u00f6w), standing back to back. ==Singles== The first single \"You\" was originally on their self-titled EP and currently has over eight million plays on Spotify. However, it was not intended to promote Pharmacy, making \"Runaway (U & I)\" the album's first official single. Galantis released the single \"Gold Dust\" on 19 February 2015 as the album second official single. It reached number one on Hype Machine's Popular Chart. \"Peanut Butter Jelly\" was later released as the third official single on the pre-release of the album on 20 April 2015. \"In My Head\" was released as the album's fourth official single on 30 October 2015 and \"Louder, Harder, Better\" was released as the album's fifth official single on 12 February 2016. ==Critical reception== John Cameron from We Got This Covered gave Pharmacy 3.5/5 stars stating, \"Galantis may have set our expectations a little too high with their 2014 releases\" (referencing \"Runaway (U & I)\", 'You\" and \"Smile\"), and added that although the album's production values were good, \"most of the songs seem to lack originality\". Cameron also mentioned that the tracks on Pharmacy are \"not poorly done by any means \u2013 it's just that very few of the new ones are all that memorable.\"http://wegotthiscovered.com/music/galantis-pharmacy-review/. Retrieved July 6, 2015. A more positive review came from Lucas Sachs from Your EDM, as he gave the album a \"respectable 8.5/10\" pointing out tracks \"Louder, Harder, Better\" and \"Firebird\" as his \"two new songs from this album that stick out to me due to their excellence in production and writing.\" He wrote that \"Louder, Harder, Better\" encompasses all that Galantis stands for, and that \"Firebird\" was his favorite track on the album due to the nostalgic feeling in the lyrics and the added reverb on the word \"bird\".http://www.youredm.com/2015/06/09/kaskade-who-the-new-kings-of- progressive-house-have-arrived-album-review/.
