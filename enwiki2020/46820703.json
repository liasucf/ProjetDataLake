Danny McMartin, rating the album an eight out of ten for Cross Rhythms, writes, \"'Rhythms Of Grace' keeps the standards high.\" Giving the album four stars from New Release Tuesday, Marcus Hathcock describes, \"If you're looking for the passionate marriage of hymnlike choruses and artful arrangements, this is your band.\" Derek Walker, indicating in a 3.5 out of five review by The Phantom Tollbooth, says, \"If the band works on its lyrics, while retaining its emotional clout and irresistible melodies, The Remission Flow could connect with a lot of people.\" Josh Hamm, rating the album three stars for Indie Vision Music, writes, \"The Remission Flow leaves me conflicted: Rhythm Of Grace still has vestiges of the clich\u00e9 riddled CCM that drove me away from most mainstream worship acts, but they have a spark of creativity and a refreshing purpose behind their music that sets them far from the madding crowd.\" Awarding the album five stars at Louder Than the Music, Jono Davies states, \"it's a top quality album from a top quality outfit.\" Jim Wilkerson, giving the album a 4.5 out of five from The Christian Music Review Blog, says, \"All in all this is a really good album and it was refreshing to hear something unique.\" Signaling in a 9.5 star review by Jesus Wired, Iain Moss describes, \"Rhythms Of Grace is astonishingly good, and a marked improved from The Light That Floods, but, as is the case with almost every album, there\u2019s always room for improvement.\" ==Track listing== ==References== Category:2014 albums ",
