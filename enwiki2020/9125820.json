    "text": "Chicken fricass\u00e9e Fricassee or fricass\u00e9e is a method of cooking meat in which it is cut up and braised, and served with its sauce. Fricassee of chicken is commonly found, both in modern recipes and antique ones, but virtually all kinds of meat, poultry, seafood, and even vegetables alone, can be fricasseed. ==Etymology & history== Fricassee is first attested in England in the mid-16th century. It is a French word, but the exact etymology is uncertain. It is theorized to be a compound of the French frire (to fry) and casser or quasser (to break in pieces). ==History== A meatball and mushroom fricassee served with rice By the general description of frying and then braising in liquid, there are recipes for fricassee as far back as the earliest version of the medieval French cookbook Le Viandier, circa 1300. In 1490, it is first referred to specifically as \"friquassee\" in the print edition of Le Viandier. The 16th-century cookery book The Good Huswifes Jewell contains \"For fricasies of a lambes head and purtenance\" The perfect English cooke contains instructions to prepare a \"Fregacy of Lamb or Veal\". Jean-Baptiste Tavernier describes \"a lusty Fricassie\" in his late 17th-century Travels through Turkey to Persia. English fricassees were usually thickened with egg yolks, while Italian fricassea used a mixture of lemon and egg yolks. By the 18th century the egg yolks had started to be replaced by flour in English and American cuisines. In Martha Washington's recipe for chicken fricassee, the chicken was stewed in gravy, then a sauce was made with cream and egg yolks. The early 19th-century cookery book A New System of Domestic Cookery by Maria Rundell says white sauce can be used for fricassee of \"Fowls, Rabbits, White Meat Fish, of Vegetables\". Broth made with chicken necks or feet, or used to boil meats, or similar is simmered with herbs and lemon peel, then thickened with cream (or egg yolk), flour and butter to make into a sauce. ==Technique== Julia Child in Mastering the Art of French Cooking describes it as \"halfway between a saut\u00e9 and a stew\" in that a saute has no liquid added, while a stew includes liquid from the beginning. In a fricassee, cut-up meat is first sauteed (but not browned), then liquid is added and it is simmered to finish cooking. Cookbook author James Peterson notes that some modernized versions of the recipe call for the meat to be thoroughly browned before braising, but the classical version requires that both meat and vegetables remain with no caramelization.Peterson, James (2008). Sauces: Classical and Contemporary Sauce Making (3 ed.). Wiley. , p. 275. ==Types== ===Beef=== In the early 19th- century cookery book A New System of Domestic Cookery by Maria Rundell, a fricassee of cold roast beef is made with very thinly sliced beef cooked in butter and broth with parsley and an onion, the sauce thickened with egg yolks, wine and vinegar. Fricasse of cold roast beef was among the recipes published in the popular women's magazine Godey's Lady Book during the American Civil War. ===Chicken and other poultry=== Chicken fricassee has been described as \"a standard old-fashioned American dish\". It was one of Abraham Lincoln's favorite dishes. A 1734 American recipe by Mrs. John Burroughs calls for birds seasoned with nutmeg, parsley, onion and mace, dredged in flour and browned in butter, then stewed in the pan with gravy, egg yolks, wine and nutmeg to make a sauce with the consistency of thickened cream.\"A 'frikasie'\", attributed to Mrs. John Burroughs, 1734, in Lucile Stimson Harvey, Food Facts for the Home-maker, 1920, p. 63 A 19th century recipe from California for Fricasa de pollos a la espa\u00f1ola (Spanish-style chicken fricasse) was prepared by frying chickens in lard with chopped onion, shallots, garlic and mushrooms. Tomato juice is added with olives, fresh herbs, and olive oil to make a thick stew.El cocinero espa\u00f1ol by Encarnaci\u00f3n Pinedo, 1898 In the Spanish Caribbean, one of the more popular dishes is fricas\u00e9 de pollo (chicken fricassee). It was brought to the islands by settlers from the south of France and Spain. Unlike French style fricassee, it has a tomato-based sauce usually with red wine. ===Offal=== A traditional 17th-century Jewish fricassee is made with chicken feet and other parts that were historically more economical like wings and necks, and sometimes meatballs. ===Rabbit=== Hannah Glasse's rabbit fricasee is made with small pieces of breaded rabbit fried in butter and served with red wine gravy. == See also == *Fricasse * List of meat dishes ==References== ==External links== Category:Meat dishes Category:Culinary terminology Category:Vegetable dishes Category:French stews Category:Italian stews Category:British stews Category:American stews Category:Jewish cuisine Category:Historical foods in American cuisine ",
