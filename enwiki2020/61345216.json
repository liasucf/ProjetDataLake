Missions in the program are aimed at exploration of the Moon, including crewed and robotic exploration of the lunar surface. Three flights of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle are currently planned for launch in the Artemis program in the early 2020s, beginning with Artemis 1. Before Artemis was named, the flights were referred to as \"Orion missions\". Numerous supporting scientific and technology demonstration missions are planned for launch under the program's Commercial Lunar Payload Services, in addition to planned and proposed uncrewed logistical missions to construct and resupply the Lunar Gateway and its expendable and reusable lunar landers in lunar orbit. ==Main missions== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Mission ! scope=\"col\" | Launch date ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Crew ! scope=\"col\" | Launch vehicle !Launch pad ! scope=\"col\" | Duration |- | Artemis I 45px | | | SLS Block 1 Crew |Kennedy LC-39B | data-sort-value=\"2160000\" | ~25d |- class=\"expand-child\" | colspan=\"7\" | Maiden flight of the SLS, carrying an uncrewed Orion capsule and thirteen CubeSats selected through several programs.
