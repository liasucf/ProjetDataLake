Dvorna in Dr\u017eavna Tiskarna, pp. 108\u2013109.) is a settlement in Upper I\u0161ka Valley in the Municipality of Ig in central Slovenia. The entire municipality is part of the traditional region of Inner Carniola and is now included in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region.Ig municipal site The settlement includes the hamlet of Mala Vas (, ), where the road to Gornji Ig branches off.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr\u017eavna zalo\u017eba Slovenije, pp. 413\u2013414. ==Geography== I\u0161ka is a row village along a road surrounded by hills in the valley of the I\u0161ka River. The main hills surrounding the settlement are Travnik Hill (728 m) to the west and Stra\u017ear Hill (794 m) to the east. There are a few fields and several meadows along the road, as well as a number of vacation houses. The Laz Woods lies to the west, and the Zavod and Rebrica woods to the east. The wooded countryside is a habitat for roe deer, chamois, and bears. Benko Cave is in the hills west of the main population center. The territory of the settlement extends south to the I\u0161ka Gorge, where there is a path to Vrbica Hill (422 m) and the confluence of the I\u0161ka and Zala rivers. From here, trails continue to Rakitna, Krvava Pe\u010d, and the Bloke Plateau. There are also several springs in the surrounding hills. ==History== Before the Second World War, there were many flour mills and sawmills along the I\u0161ka River. Most of these have been abandoned. During the Second World War, all of the vacation houses in the gorge were burned, and have been replaced by newer construction. The I\u0161ka Gorge Lodge () was built in 1948, offering accommodation and fishing permits. ===Mass graves=== I\u0161ka is the site of two known mass graves from during and after the Second World War. Both are located south of the settlement, in the I\u0161ka Gorge. The Romani Mass Grave () is located in the Benko Meadow and is marked by a wooden cross below a cliff, south of the house at I\u0161ka no. 45. It contains the remains of 43 Romani killed by the Partisans in May 1942. The Wounded Mass Grave () is located near the vacation house at I\u0161ka no. 21. A cross stands north of the grave, below a slope, and is visible from the road. The grave contains the remains of wounded Home Guard members murdered here after the war. Both of the wooden crosses at the sites bear the carved inscriptions Bog bo obrisal vse solze iz na\u0161ih o\u010di \u2013 tudi ne bo ve\u010d \u017ealovanja, ne vpitja, ne bole\u010din, zakaj kar je bilo prej je minilo. Postoj ob meni brat, da skupaj bova na\u0161la pot. (And God shall wipe away all tears from our eyes\u2014there shall be no more sorrow, nor crying, nor pain: for the former things are passed away. ... Rest in peace. Remain by my side, brother, and together we shall find the way.) The first cross also reads Tukaj \u010daka na vstajenje 43 Romov od maja 1942 (Here 43 Roma from May 1942 await the resurrection) and the second reads Tukaj \u010daka na vstajenje 52 slovenskih domobranskih ranjencev od binko\u0161tne sobote 1945 (Here 52 Slovene Home Guard wounded from Pentecost Saturday [May 19] 1945 await the resurrection). ==Church== Saint Gertrude's Church The local church, built on the right bank of the river in the main part of the settlement, is dedicated to Saint Gertrude () and belongs to the Parish of Ig. It dates to the 18th century. It is a Baroque structure with a square nave and a polygonal chancel walled on three sides.
