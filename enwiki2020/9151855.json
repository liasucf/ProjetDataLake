    "text": "thumb Evgenii Dainov (), born 11 May 1958 in Plovdiv, is a Bulgarian academic, author and political commentator. ==Education== Dainov graduated with a double First in modern history and Russian from Oxford University, where he is a member of the Ancient House of Congregation of Doctors and the Regent Masters. It was at the university that he became lead guitarist in a blues-rock band, which he continues in other bands in Sofia today. ==Career and Political Views== Has published three major monographs, one collection of short stories and participated in 28 collections of papers concentrating on issues relating to civil society, community development, politics, public administration, reform and minority integration. His authored works relate his belief that thinking is only the prelude to doing. This belief, combined with his passionate advocacy of freedom and self-government has naturally led to his conviction that civil society is something good and also simple to explain: i.e. the way to have a decent country is to ensure that it functions bottom- up, and that everyone gets involved and represented in the decisions about the common future. Officially a resident of the village of Mindya, in the Balkan mountain range, he established the CSP-NBU in 1994 and has led it ever since. He teaches political philosophy and social practices at the New Bulgarian University. He also regularly testifies in parliamentary hearings. He is member of a number of professional and civic bodies and associations, including the Bulgarian Sociological Association, the Bulgarian Political Science Association, Global Water Partnership, Varbitsa River Council and Global Development Network. == External links == * http://www2.fmg.uva.nl/acre/whoiswho/EvgeniiDainov.html Category:1958 births Dainov Dainov Category:Bulgarian political scientists Category:People from Plovdiv ",
