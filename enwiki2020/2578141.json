    "text": "Dinkelsb\u00fchl is a historic town in Central Franconia, a region of Germany that is now part of the state of Bavaria, in southern Germany. Dinkelsb\u00fchl is a former free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. In local government terms, Dinkelsb\u00fchl lies near the western edge of the Landkreis (or local government district) of district of Ansbach, north of Aalen. Dinkelsb\u00fchl lies on the northern part of the Romantic Road, and is one of three particularly striking historic towns on the northern part of the route, the others being Rothenburg ob der Tauber and N\u00f6rdlingen. The town lies on the southern edge of the Franconian Heights and on the River W\u00f6rnitz, which rises in the town of Schillingsf\u00fcrst. The population in 2013 was 11,315 ==History== Fortified by Emperor Henry V, in 1305 Dinkelsb\u00fchl received the same municipal rights as Ulm, and in 1351 was raised to the position of a Free Imperial City. Its municipal code, the Dinkelsb\u00fchler Recht, published in 1536, and revised in 1738, contained a very extensive collection of public and private laws. ===Reformation=== During the Protestant Reformation, Dinkelsb\u00fchl was notable for being \u2013 eventually along only with Ravensburg, Augsburg and Biberach an der Ri\u00df \u2014 a Bi-confessional (i.e. roughly equal numbers of Roman Catholics and Protestant citizens, with equal rights) Imperial City () where the Peace of Westphalia caused the establishment of a joint Catholic\u2013Protestant government and administrative system, with equality offices () and a precise and equal distribution between Catholic and Protestant civic officials. This status ended in 1802, when these cities were annexed by the Kingdom of Bavaria. Around 1534 the majority of the population of Dinkelsb\u00fchl became Protestant.http://www.dinkelsbuehl.de/ISY/mlib/media/DIN_Streuprospekt_GB.pdf?mediatrace=.383. ===Thirty Years War=== Every summer Dinkelsb\u00fchl celebrates the city's surrender to Swedish troops in 1632 during the Thirty Years' War. This reenactment is played out by many of the town's residents. It features an array of Swedish soldiers attacking the city gate and children dressed in traditional garb coming to witness the event. Paper cones full of chocolate and candy are given as gifts to children. This historical event is called the \"Kinderzeche\" and can in some aspects be compared with the \"Meistertrunk\" in Rothenburg. The name is derived from the two German words for \"child\" and \"the bill for food and drink in an inn\", and is called such because of the legend that a child saved the town from massacre by the Swedes during the surrender. The legend tells that when the Swedish army besieged the town, a teenage girl took the children to the Swedish general to beg for mercy. The Swedish general had recently lost his young son to illness, and a boy who approached him so closely resembled his own son that he decided to spare the town. ===Present day=== The film The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1962) was filmed on location in Dinkelsb\u00fchl. The Werner Herzog film The Enigma of Kasper Hauser (German: Jeder f\u00fcr sich und Gott gegen alle; trans. Every Man for Himself and God Against All) premiered on 1 November 1974 in Dinkelsb\u00fchl, where it was originally filmed. ==Main sights== Dinkelsb\u00fchl is still surrounded by the old medieval walls and towers.
