    "text": "Bihor County () is a county (jude\u021b) of Romania, in Cri\u0219ana. Its capital city is Oradea. ==Toponymy== The origin of the name Bihor is uncertain, except that it likely takes its name from an ancient fortress in the current commune of Biharia. It possibly came from vihor, the Serbian and Ukrainian word for \"whirlwind\" (\u0432\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0440), or Slavic biela hora, meaning \"white mountain.\" Another theory is that Biharea is of Daco-Thracian etymology (bi meaning \"two\" and harati \"take\" or \"lead\"), possibly meaning two possessions of land in the Duchy of Menumorut. Another theory is that the name comes from bour, the Romanian term for aurochs (from the Latin word bubalus). The animal once inhabited the lands of northwestern Romania. Under this controversial theory, the name changed from buar to buhar and to Bihar and Bihor. ==Demographics== In 2002, Bihor had a population of 600,246 and the population density was 79.56/km2. 48.6% of its population lives in urban areas, lower than the Romanian average.Romanian 2002 CensusNational Institute of Statistics, \"Popula\u0163ia dup\u0103 etnie\" *Romanians - 67.38% *Hungarians - 25.96% *Roma - 5.01% *Slovaks - 1.22% *Germans (Sathmar Swabians) - 0.19% On 31 October 2011, Bihor had a population of 575,398 and the population density was .Recensamantul Populatiei si Locuintelor 2011: Popula\u021bia stabil\u0103 dup\u0103 etnie \u2013 jude\u021be, municipii, ora\u0219e, comune *Romanians \u2013 66.96% *Hungarians \u2013 25.27% *Roma \u2013 6.33% *Slovaks \u2013 1.1% *Germans (Sathmar Swabians) \u2013 0.13% === By religion === 99.4% of the county's population are ChristianRomania and Bihor County Census, 2002, and of these: *Romanian Orthodox \u2013 59.7% *Reformed \u2013 18.1%; *Catholic \u2013 11.5% (Roman Catholic \u2013 9.2%; Greek Catholic \u2013 2.3%) *Pentecostal \u2013 5.7%; *Baptists \u2013 3.7%; *Adventist \u2013 0.3%; {| class=\"wikitable\" !

The territory of Bihor County was transferred to Romania from Hungary as successor state to Austria-Hungary in 1920 under the Treaty of Trianon. After the administrative unification law in 1925, the name of the county remained as it was, but the territory was reorganized. In 1938, King Carol II promulgated a new Constitution, and subsequently he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. 10 \u021binuturi (approximate translation: \"lands\") were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by reziden\u021bi regali (approximate translation: \"Royal Residents\") - appointed directly by the King - instead of the prefects. Bihor County became part of \u021ainutul Cri\u0219uri. In 1940, part of the county was transferred back to Hungary with the rest of Northern Transylvania under the Second Vienna Award. Beginning in 1944, Romanian forces with Soviet assistance recaptured the ceded territory and reintegrated it into Romania. Romanian jurisdiction over the entire county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. The county was disestablished by the communist government of Romania in 1950, and re- established in 1968 when Romania restored the county administrative system. ==Economy== Bihor is one of the wealthiest counties in Romania, with a GDP per capita well above the national average.

It was subject to redesign in 2013 after it was discovered by a local teacher that the text on the scroll was erroneously written in Greek, rather than Cyrillic (the original alphabet used to write the poem's text) or the Latin alphabet. The county has no significant history with Greece. ==Politics== The Bihor County Council, elected at the 2016 local government elections, is made up of 35 counselors, with the following party composition: {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:#ccc\" | ! style=\"background:#ccc\" | Party ! style=\"background:#ccc\" | Seats ! style=\"background:#ccc\" colspan=\"17\" | Current County Council |- | | | National Liberal Party | style=\"text- align: right\" | 17 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- | | | Social Democratic Party | style=\"text-align: right\" | 9 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- | | | Democratic Alliance of Hungarians | style=\"text-align: right\" | 7 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- | | | Alliance of Liberals and Democrats | style=\"text-align: right\" | 2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |} ==Administrative divisions== Oradea Marghita Salonta Beiu\u0219 Bihor County has four municipalities, six towns, and 91 communes.
