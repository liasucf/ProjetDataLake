Souza gained fame playing the role of \"Mulher Samambaia\" (Fern Woman) in the pilot show of P\u00e2nico na TV, a satire consisting of beautiful women who stand on stage just to grace the scenery. After making regular appearances on the show, she gained attention in the modelling world. Souza was on the cover of the magazine Sexy in December 2004 and August 2007. Shortly after her departure from P\u00e2nico na TV in 2009, Souza was a favorite contestant in the first season of the reality show A Fazenda. Taking advantage of this, the magazine Sexy published a special edition of its photo essay of August 2007, but with previously unpublished photos and without Souza's permission. She owns the brand Zami Concept and maintains several company stores. ==Personal life== Souza dated model Gustavo Mendon\u00e7a from 2006 to May 2009.
