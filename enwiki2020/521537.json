    "text": "Objet d'art (; plural objets d'art) literally means \"art object\" (or work of art) in French, but in practice, the term has long been reserved in English to describe works of art that are not paintings, large or medium-sized sculptures, prints, or drawings. It therefore covers a wide range of works, usually small and three-dimensional, of high quality and finish in areas of the decorative arts, such as metalwork items, with or without enamel, small carvings, statuettes and plaquettes in any material, including engraved gems, hardstone carvings, ivory carvings and similar items, non-utilitarian porcelain and glass, and a vast range of objects that would also be classed as antiques (or indeed antiquities), such as small clocks, watches, gold boxes, and sometimes textiles, especially tapestries. Books with fine bookbindings might be included. The term is somewhat flexible, and is often used as a broad term for \"everything else\" after major categories have been dealt with. Thus the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London describes its collection as follows: \"The National Maritime Museum's collection of objet d\u2019art comprises over 800 objects. These are mostly small decorative art items that fall outside the scope of the Museum\u2019s ceramic, plate, textiles and glass collections.\" The items illustrated on their website (all with maritime associations) include metal curtain ties, a \"lacquered papier-mach\u00e9 tray\", tapestries, small boxes for tobacco, snuff, cosmetics, and other purposes, cut-paper pictures (d\u00e9coupage), small silver items, miniature paintings, a \"Gilt-brass clock finial\", ceramic plaques, statuettes, cigarette boxes, plaquettes, a painted tray, a horse brass, a metal \"pipe tamper\", a small glass painting, a fan, a handle plate from furniture, and various other items.objets d'art , National Maritime Museum ivory netsuke, 18th or 19th century, with black ink; a type of object that is often classified among objets d'art The term is used with the same meaning in French, but in that language, it may sometimes be a synonym for \"work of art\" and has retained more respectability in the worlds of art history and museums than in English, where in recent decades, it is often avoided (even more in archaeology), but remains in use in the world of collecting and the art and antique markets. In English, it may be italicised as a foreign word, or not; either may be considered correct. Incorrect forms such as \"objet-d'art\" and \"object(s) d'art\" are sometimes seen,Indeed, 19th century wills and inventories of the Rothschild family include many \"Objects d'art\" and \"objects of virtue\". and the term should not be capitalized in running prose. ==Objet de vertu== An arguably more precious variant is objet de vertu (usually italicised), in which vertu is intended to suggest rich materials and a higher standard of refined facture and finish, and would typically exclude objects with a practical function, being restricted to \"collector's pieces\" that are purely decorative. Objets de vertu reflect the rarified aesthetic and conspicuous consumption characteristic of court art, whether of the late-medieval Burgundian dukes, the Mughal emperors, or Ming and later imperial China. Examples could be adduced from Antiquity as well,The Lycurgus Cup, a Roman glass cage cup now in the British Museum, the Byzantine agate \"Rubens vase\", among many objets d'art in the Walters Art Gallery, the Roman glass \"Portland Vase\" and many ancient onyx or sard cameos, for instances. whilst the pre- World War I production of Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9, epitomized by the famous Faberg\u00e9 eggs, made in the style of genuine Easter eggs, but using precious metals and gemstones rather than more mundane materials, are late examples of objets de vertu. A comparable term that appears in 18th- and 19th-century French sale catalogs,Such as the Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 des diff\u00e9rens objets de curiosit\u00e9 dans les sciences et arts, qui composoient le cabinet de feu Mr.. Paris, 1775; in 1916 A. Tuete edited the Inventaire des laques anciennes et des objets de curiosit\u00e9 de Marie-Antoinette: confi\u00e9s \u00e0 Daguerre et Lignereux, marchands bijoutiers, le 10 octobre 1789. though now less used, is objets de curiosit\u00e9, \"objects of curiosity\",Maurice Rheims' La vie \u00e9trange des objets (1959) is subtitled histoire de la curiosit\u00e9. now devolved into the less-valued curio. Elaborate late Renaissance display pieces in silver that incorporate organic elements such as ostrich eggs, nuts of the coco de mer and sea-shells are grouped in a volume, published in 1991, as \"The Curiousities\" in the catalogues of the Waddesdon Bequest at the British Museum.Tait, Hugh, A Catalogue of the Waddesdon Bequest in the British Museum, several volumes, British Museum.
