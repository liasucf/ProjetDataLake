    "text": "Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Trust was one of the community health trusts created in 2012. It was authorised as a foundation trust in October 2014. The trust has established a Responsive Workforce Model using HealthRoster Software and SafeCare, which they say has reduced agency spend, ensured quality and freed up nurses for hands-on care. It was named by the Health Service Journal as the second-best community trust to work for in 2015. At that time it had 3227 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 4.13%. 78% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 65% recommended it as a place to work. The trust announced plans to merge with Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust in November 2016, but planned merger did not occur and the two trusts continue in existence. ==See also== * List of NHS trusts ==References== ==External links== * Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Trust Category:NHS foundation trusts Category:Health in Derbyshire Category:Community health NHS trusts ",
