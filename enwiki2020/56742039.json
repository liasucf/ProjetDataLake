Out of the 75 districts of Nepal, 14 were severely affected by the earthquakes with an estimated 8600 deaths, 22,000 injuries and 505,000 homes completely destroyed. Post-disaster, health care facilities faced shortages in space and resources. Furthermore, patients facing discharge after acute care faced challenges of accessibility living in remote locations with limited health care services especially those requiring ongoing rehabilitation. With natural elements such as monsoon season, floods and landslides made access more difficult post-earthquake. Injuries included traumatic cases due to falling debris and houses collapsing due to poor building construction and high population density in larger cities. 70% of injuries were fractures with a large number of patients suffering from spinal cord injuries (200-300), amputations (40-60) as well as traumatic brain injuries, crush injuries and neuropraxia. During the time of the earthquake, 393 physiotherapists were registered with the majority of therapists located in Kathmandu. The role of physical therapist in disaster response was poorly defined with the profession being relatively new. Many physical therapists at the time worked in facilities treating patients with musculoskeletal conditions followed by neurology and rehabilitation with a small number in intensive care-unit, obstetrics and pediatrics. In response to the earthquake, physical therapists worked alongside doctors, nurses and other heath providers with triage, screening and acute care management of patients. This would includes services such as brace fitting, applying plaster cases, temporary backslabs, skin traction for femoral fractures and hip dislocations, dressing wounds, fitting assistive devices. Physiotherapists also mobilized patients, prescribed exercises, re-positioned patients to prevent secondary complications such as bed sores and chest complications post-surgery or prolonged bed rest. ==References== Category:Physical therapy Category:Health in Nepal ",
