    "text": "Blair Tindall (born February 2, 1960) is an American oboist, performer, producer, speaker, and journalist. ==Early life and education== Tindall was born in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to historian George Brown Tindall and Blossom Tindall. She started playing the piano at an early age and switched to oboe when joining the junior high school band; because of her surname's place in alphabetical order, she was the last person able to choose an instrument, and the only other one available was the oboe. She attended high school at the North Carolina School of the Arts, received bachelor's and master's degrees from the Manhattan School of Music, and a masters in communication from Stanford University, which she attended on a full tuition fellowship. She also attended Columbia University. ==Career== Tindall spent 23 years as a professional musician in New York City, playing with such groups as the New York Philharmonic, Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, and the Orchestra of St. Luke's, presenting a critically acclaimed solo debut at Carnegie Recital Hall, and earning a jazz Grammy nomination. She has also performed on many film soundtracks, including those of the movies Malcolm X, for which she was lauded in CD Review Magazine, Crooklyn, and Twilight. She has also performed with Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts at the Blue Note jazz club.Peter Haffner: Tindall: Mozart in the Jungle \u2013 Sex, Drugs and Classical Music. Wiener Zeitung, 2005-9-16 Tindall taught journalism at Stanford and music at the University of California, Berkeley and Mills College. She has also received residencies at the MacDowell Colony, Kimmel Harding Nelson Center for the Arts, and the Ucross Foundation. While studying at Stanford, Tindall supported herself by performing with the San Francisco Symphony and as a soloist with the San Francisco Contemporary Music Players. During this time, she was also a staff business reporter at the Examiner (Hearst) and critic-at-large for the Contra Costa Times in Walnut Creek. She went on to write for The New York Times, Agence France-Presse, the Los Angeles Times, Sierra, The Sydney Morning Herald, and the International Herald Tribune. In 2005, she published Mozart in the Jungle: Sex, Drugs, and Classical Music (Atlantic Monthly Press), a memoir of her experiences in the classical music world, which National Public Radio named one of the top five arts stories of the year. Her book was also lauded by musicologist Richard Taruskin in The New Republic as \"the smartest take on [the classical music] situation\". In 2014, the book was adapted for an Amazon Studios web video series of the same name. The pilot was written by Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman, and Alex Timbers, and directed by Paul Weitz. The series stars Lola Kirke, Malcolm McDowell, Saffron Burrows, Bernadette Peters, and Gael Garcia Bernal. ==Personal life== Tindall married Bill Nye on February 3, 2006. The ceremony was performed by Rick Warren at The Entertainment Gathering at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles. Yo-Yo Ma provided the music. Nye left the relationship, having the marriage annulled, seven weeks later when the marriage license was declared invalid; he later filed for a restraining order. In 2007, Nye obtained a restraining order against Tindall after she broke into his house, stole several items including his laptop, which she used to send defamatory emails impersonating him, and damaged his garden with herbicide. Tindall acknowledged killing his plants but denied being a threat to him.https://www.tmz.com/2007/11/19/the-science-guy-wants-to- send-wife-to-the-moon/ After violating the order in 2009, Tindall was ordered to pay $57,000 of Nye's legal expenses. In 2012, Nye sued Tindall for unpaid attorney's fees after she failed to repay the $57,000. == References == ==External links== * Blair Tindall official website Category:1960 births Category:American classical oboists Category:American women journalists Category:American memoirists Category:American music journalists Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Journalists from New York City Category:Living people Category:Manhattan School of Music alumni Category:Mills College faculty Category:People from Chapel Hill, North Carolina Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Stanford University faculty Category:University of North Carolina School of the Arts alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty Category:American women memoirists Category:Women writers about music ",
