    "text": "Gas House Gang was a barbershop quartet that won the 1993 SPEBSQSA international competition. They started singing as a group in 1987. The quartet won the International Quartet Championship of the Barbershop Harmony Society in 1993. The Gas House Gang toured the United States extensively and performed around the world, singing with many musical groups, including The Chordettes, the King's Singers, and Chanticleer. ==Members== Rob Henry, the quartet's baritone, was diagnosed with esophageal cancer on May 30, 2003, and died shortly thereafter on September 4, 2003. Several prominent barbershop singers helped fill in after Rob's death, including Mike Slamka (Power Play and Crossroads), Tony DeRosa (Keepsake, Platinum, Max Q, and Main Street), Brandon Guyton (Four Voices and Crossroads), and D.J. Hiner (The Ritz), but on June 3, 2004, the quartet announced their retirement at the end of 2005. Jim Henry, Rob's younger brother, went on to direct the Ambassadors of Harmony to international championship victories in 2004, 2009, 2012 and 2016. Jim's new quartet, Crossroads, also won top honors in 2009, making Jim the only man in society history to direct the winning chorus and win with his quartet in the same year. Kipp Buckner started singing barbershop when he was 14 and has won the International Champion Quartet Medal three times: with the GHG, previously in 1987 when he sang with the Interstate Rivals, and most recently in 2011 with his newest quartet, Old School. Rich Knight has sung with the Ambassadors of Harmony since the 1970s. His lead voice creates the defining sound of the GHG. ==Discography== * Our Rough & Tumble Best (CD; 1989) * A Little Night Music (CD; 1992) * Face The Music (CD; 1996) * Some Children See Him...
