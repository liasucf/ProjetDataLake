The author of some 70 books in all (excluding ghostwritten books), he has published several original novels as well as one novel in the Judge Dredd series and, with Joe Dever, 11 novels and a novella collection in the Legends of Lone Wolf series; edited several anthologies, beginning with Aries 1 (1979) and most recently New Writings in the Fantastic (2007); and has written dozens of nonfiction works, including several relating to fantasy and science fiction. His collaborators have included David Langford and, as illustrator, Bob Eggleton. With John Clute, he co-edited The Encyclopedia of Fantasy (1997) for which he also wrote all the cinema entries. He has written numerous short stories, articles and columns. Barnett lived in New Jersey with his wife, Pamela Scoville, a noted animation art expert and co-founder with her late husband Michael of the Animation Art Guild.
