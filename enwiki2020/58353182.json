    "text": "Giuseppe Di Giovanni (born May 24, 1968) is a Professor of Human Physiology and Neuroscience at the University of Malta. == Early life == Di Giovanni received his PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Chieti, Italy and was a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University, CT, USA. == Career == He served as a Senior Lecturer of Human Physiology at the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, University of Palermo. Later he became Professor of Human Physiology and Neuroscience at the University of Malta, as well as an Honorary Professor at the Neuroscience Division of the School Biosciences at Cardiff University, UK. His main research interests are in experimental neurology and biological psychiatry. Specifically, he is interested in the pathophysiological role of serotonin, and especially of the 5-HT2C receptors, in brain disorders, such as epilepsy, depression, drugs of abuse and Parkinson's disease. He has published more than 130 articles in top biomedical journals including Nature Medicine and Nature Neuroscience, 9 books and several journal special issues.
