It was formerly known as Alais. ==Geography== Al\u00e8s lies north-northwest of N\u00eemes, on the left bank of the Gardon River, which half surrounds it. It is located at the foot of the C\u00e9vennes, near the C\u00e9vennes National Park. ==History== Al\u00e8s may be the modern successor of Arisitum, where, in about 570, Sigebert, King of Austrasia, created a bishopric. In his campaign against the Visigoths, the Merovingian king Theudebert I (533\u2013548) conquered part of the territory of the Diocese of N\u00eemes. His later successor Sigebert set up the new diocese, comprising fifteen parishes in the area controlled by the Franks, which included a number of towns to the north of the Cevenne: Al\u00e8s, Le Vigan, Arre, Arrigas, Meyrueis, Saint-Jean-du-Gard, Anduze, and Vissec. The diocese disappeared in the 8th century with the conquest of the whole of Septimania by the Franks. No longer a residential bishopric, Arisitum is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 839 After the Edict of Nantes, Al\u00e8s was one of the places de s\u00fbret\u00e9 given to the Huguenots. Louis XIII took back the town in 1629, and the Peace of Al\u00e8s, signed on 29 June of that year, suppressed the political privileges of the Protestants, while continuing to guarantee toleration. At the request of Louis XIV, a see was again created at Alais by Pope Innocent XII, in 1694. The future Cardinal de Bausset, Bossuet's biographer, was Bishop of Alais from 1784 to 1790. It was suppressed after the French Revolution, and its territory was divided between the diocese of Avignon and the diocese of Mende. ==Population== ==Economy== Al\u00e8s is the center of a mining district and hosts the \u00c9cole des Mines d'Al\u00e8s. Historically, according to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911): :\"The town is one of the most important markets for raw silk and cocoons in the south of France, and the Gardon supplies power to numerous silk-mills. It is also the centre of a mineral field, which yields large quantities of coal, iron, zinc and lead; its blast- furnaces, foundries, glass-works and engineering works afford employment to many workmen.\" ==Personalities== Pasteur Pasteur did his research on the silkworm disease (p\u00e9brine and flacherie) at Al\u00e8s, and the town dedicated a bust to his memory. There is also a statue of the chemist J.B. Dumas. Alphonse Daudet wrote his semi-autobiographical novel \"Le Petit Chose\" while teaching at the Coll\u00e8ge of Al\u00e8s. ==Sports== The town has one association football team called Olympique Al\u00e8s who currently play in the Championnat National. Former France and Paris Saint-Germain manager Laurent Blanc was also born in Al\u00e8s. Morocco and Legan\u00e9s voetballer Nabil El Zhar was also born in Al\u00e8s. ==Sights== Historically, according to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition: :\"The streets are wide and its promenades and fine plane-trees make the town attractive; but the public buildings, the chief of which are the Saint-Jean- Baptiste cathedral, a heavy building of the 18th century, and the citadel, which serves as barracks and prison, are of small interest.\" * Parc botanique de la Tour Vieille Al\u00e8s was the birthplace of: * Rigord (), chronicler (probable birthplace) * Jean-Pierre des Ours de Mandajors (1679\u20131747), 18th- century French historian and playwright. * Jean-Baptiste Dumas (1800\u20131884), chemist * Gabriel Montoya (1868\u20131914), Parisian chansonnier * Edgard de Larminat (1895\u20131962), French general * Charles Dugas (1885\u20131957), Archaeologist and Hellenist * Guillaume de Ramel (born 1974), American philanthropist and sometime political candidate * Louis Leprince-Ringuet (1901\u20132000), physicist * Maurice Andr\u00e9 (1933\u20132012), trumpeter, active in the classical music field * Laurent Blanc (born 1965), football defender * Nabil El Zhar (born 1986), football striker * St\u00e9phane Sarrazin (born 1975), sportscar racing driver, rally driver * Romain Dumas (born 1977), sportscar racing driver ==International relations== ===Twin towns \u2014 sister cities=== Al\u00e8s is twinned with: * East Ayrshire, Scotland ==See also== * Communes of the Gard department ==References== * INSEE ==External links== * * City council website (in French) * The Regordane Way or St Gilles Trail, which starts in Al\u00e8s Category:Communes of Gard Category:Subprefectures in France Category:Mining communities in France Category:Languedoc ",
