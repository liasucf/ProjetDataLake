After graduation, she worked as a costume designer before moving to the U.S. in 1946, where she moved into textile design. She was living with the Breuers when Hans Knoll saw her portfolio, he hired her as a textiles designer at his company, Knoll, where she began working under Marianne Strengell. In 1949, Haraszty was appointed director of KnollTextiles (the Knoll textiles department), a position she held until 1955. Knoll's look in the 1950s and 60s can be attributed to Haraszty who reissued older prints in bolder colorwaves, including its ubiquitous red-orange color, revolutionizing commercial upholstery fabrics and textures. Her designs were often floral and is best known for her Iceland poppy motif. Under Haraszty, KnollTextiles explored then-novel fabrics, such as nylon, mixing them with other materials. In 1958, she opened her own studio in New York and consulted at Victor Gruen Associates and IBM, as well as designing a line of women's clothing for B.H. Wragge. She also designed restaurant interiors at Expo 58 in Brussels and a children's playground for American President Lines. As a lecturer at UCLA, Haraszty taught a course called \"Design From Nature.\" Over the course of her career, Haraszty was awarded five gold medals from the Association of Interior Designers for her textile designs, as well as an award from the Pasadena Art Museum. Many of her prints and textile samples are now part of museum collections, including the Museum of Modern Art; Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum; the Victoria and Albert Museum; and the Ch\u00e2teau Dufresne. Haraszty later moved to California where her work incorporated embroidery and crewel to create what she called \"needlepainting.\" She wrote books on the subject and created needlepainting kits for production. ==Personal life== Haraszty quit Knoll to move to Coldwater Canyon, where she and her husband renovated a house in her signature bright colors and florals. Haraszty died in 24 November 1994 of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. == Books == * Needlepainting : a garden of stitches, Eszter Haraszty, Bruce David Colen. 1974 * The Embroiderer's Portfolio of Flower Designs, Eszter Haraszty. 1981 ==References== ==External links== * Textile samples designed by Haraszty at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum * Textile samples designed by Haraszty at the Museum of Modern Art * Our Tools, Our Time: Women at MoMA from Kroll Category:1920 births Category:1994 deaths Category:American graphic designers Category:Women graphic designers Category:American textile designers Category:Hungarian designers ",
