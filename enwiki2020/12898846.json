    "text": "\"Unravel\" is the third song on the album Homogenic by Bj\u00f6rk, which was released in 1997. The song features a prominent example of Bj\u00f6rk's use of a half-singing, half-speaking technique which, according to folklore specialist Njall Sigurason, is comparable to that of Old Icelandic choirmen.Music and Technoculture, ed. R. Lysloff and L. Gay Structurally, the song is made up of a slowly sweeping melody, saxophones, a church organ, and distant-sounding electronic beats. Thematically, the song describes two faraway lovers. One of the lovers realizes that the love between the two of them is unraveling because of factors out of their control. The lover, Bj\u00f6rk, seeks to reunite with her lover to rebuild the love lost. ==Music video== Even though \"Unravel\" was not released as a single, a music video was made by Lynn Fox to promote Bj\u00f6rk's Greatest Hits Tour. The video won a silver prize at the 2004 D&AD; Awards, an event recognizing annual achievements in design and advertising. The video itself depicts Bj\u00f6rk in a deep sea-like environment, wearing a billowing dress as a large and furry unidentified sea creature grows out of her back in a strings-like manner. ==Other artists== In a 2006 interview with Spin magazine, Radiohead singer Thom Yorke named \"Unravel\" as his favourite song ever, and said, \"I'm trying to get Radiohead to do a cover because I think it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.\"\"Thom Yorke reveals favourite song ever\", NME.com On November 8, 2007, Yorke performed a cover of the song as part of Radiohead's \"Thumbs Down\" webcast.
