    "text": "WPXB-LD, virtual and UHF digital channel 50, is a low-powered Daystar owned- and-operated station licensed to Daytona Beach, Florida, United States. The station is owned by Word of God Fellowship, parent company of the Daystar Television Network. WPXB-LD's transmitter is located near Indian Lake within the Tiger Bay State Forest. ==History== The station signed on in December 4, 1998, as W42AM, later W57CV. It changed call letters to WPXB-LP in 2002. On July 8, 2009, WPXB flash-cut its signal to digital as WPXB-LD. Sometime until 2014, WPXB-LD served as a translator of Orlando-based Pax TV (now Ion Television) owned-and-operated station WOPX-TV (channel 56) that relayed WOPX's programming to areas of east-central Florida that received a marginal to non-existent signal from WOPX, although there were significant overlap between the two stations' contours otherwise. WPXB-LD was a straight simulcast of WOPX-TV; on-air references to WPXB-LD were limited to Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-mandated hourly station identifications during programming. Aside from the transmitter, WPXB-LD did not maintain any physical presence locally in Daytona Beach. On December 15 of that year, West Palm Beach-based Ion Media Networks, owner or WOPX-TV, reached a deal to donate WPXB-LD to Word of God Fellowship, parent company of the Daystar television network ==Digital channel== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
