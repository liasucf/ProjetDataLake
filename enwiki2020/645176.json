    "text": "Kingdom Hospital (sometimes known as Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital) is a thirteen-episode television series based on Lars von Trier's The Kingdom (Danish title: Riget), developed by horror writer Stephen King in 2004 for American television. While initially conceived as a miniseries, it was later changed into a regular television series (albeit one that lasted one season). It was first aired on ABC on March 3 and concluded on July 15, 2004 after being put on hold during NBA playoffs. Kingdom Hospital has been compared to the paranormal hospital drama series All Souls, another production which had been inspired by Von Trier's The Kingdom. ==Plot== The story tells of the fictional Kingdom Hospital located in Lewiston, Maine, built on the site of a mill that manufactured military uniforms during the American Civil War. Previously, a hospital known as the \"Old Kingdom\" had been built on the site, but it burned down. The current hospital is known as the \"New Kingdom\". The hospital's \"turbulent\" nature seems to reflect its ominous logo, a crimson stylized dagger, predicting what will come. A psychic named Mrs. Druse has checked into the hospital numerous times and is taken by the staff to be a hypochondriac. She asks for the assistance of the cynical yet compassionate Dr. Hook to uncover the truth about the hospital and the mysterious spirits who haunt it \u2013 including a young girl, killed after the original fire, a sinister teenage boy, and a strange animal that follows and protects the young girl, who calls it Antubis (it is similar to a giant anteater, but whose long snout opens up to a set of jagged teeth). Elsewhere, Peter Rickman, a painter who is admitted to the hospital following a road accident (with severe injuries to his skull and spine) begins to discover the ghastly goings-on while he lies comatose in room 426. Other subplots included the initiation of arrogant chief of surgery Dr. Stegman into the secret society known as the 'Keepers', and the challenged-at-every-turn flirtation between young Dr. Elmer Traff and sleep doctor Dr Lona Massingale. ==Cast== ===The hospital staff=== * Andrew McCarthy as Dr. Hook, the handsome surgeon who has made it his life's work to destroy incompetence among doctors. * Bruce Davison as Dr. Stegman, the arrogant, egotistical neurosurgeon who is on the verge of being initiated into the secret society of Kingdom Hospital, despite his numerous malpractice suits. He is given to repetitive bragging of his \"great career\" in Boston, Massachusetts. * Meagen Fay as Dr. Brenda Abelson, Steg's only true friend in the hospital, an ambitious woman who would stop at nothing for what she wants. * Ed Begley Jr. as Dr. Jesse James, Kingdom Hospital's Chief of Staff and member of the 'Keepers' \u2013 the Secret Society, who spends his time initiating \"Operation: Morning Air\". * Jamie Harrold as Dr. Elmer Traff, a young surgeon whose father is an important man in the hospital. He is smitten with Dr. Massingale and pursues her romantically. * Sherry Miller as Dr. Lona Massingale, the enigmatic sleep doctor, and love interest of Elmer, despite her determination not to get involved with \"a child\". * Allison Hossack as Dr. Christine Draper, Kingdom Hospital's friendliest doctor, who has a romantic interest in Dr. Hook. * William Wise as Dr. Louis Traff, the leader of the Keepers, and also an important doctor at Kingdom Hospital; its longest serving member. * Lena Georgas as Nurse Carrie von Trier, Peter's nurse, who is afraid of blood. * Brandon Bauer as Abel Lyon, an orderly with Down syndrome, who sneaks around Kingdom Hospital with his friend Christa, being a trickster. Both he and Christa have an uncanny knack of knowing all the hospital's goings-on, including those of the otherworld. * Jennifer Cunningham as Christa Mendelson, Abel's partner-in-crime, who also has Down syndrome. Abel and Christa show a strange affinity for the hospital's mechanical workings. * Julian Richings as Otto, the all-purpose man of Kingdom, who regularly watches the security feeds. Otto is accompanied by Blondi, an intelligent German Shepherd Dog. Blondi has on several occasions shown self-consciousness and actual thought capabilities; as an in-joke, he thinks in a German accent. Blondi's name is a reference to Adolf Hitler's favorite German Shepherd Dog, also named Blondi. * Del Pentecost as Bobby Druse, Mrs. Druse's son, and an orderly at the hospital. ===Patients, past and present=== * Diane Ladd as Sally Druse, a professed psychic, who regularly checks into Kingdom Hospital for all sorts of complaints, and who is determined to discover the truth lurking in the hospital's depths. * Jack Coleman as Peter Rickman, a comatose painter who is discovering the past and future of Kingdom Hospital.

They tried to buy the rights to the Danish original, only to learn that Columbia Pictures had acquired them and intended to make a theatrical movie. After five years, Columbia concluded the work could not be adapted in two-hour form and sold the rights in exchange for the rights to King's novella from the 1990 book Four Past Midnight called Secret Window, Secret Garden. This was the first time he had adapted someone else's work rather than his own from scratch. King kept most of the characters and dark humor in place, but added a new central character named Peter Rickman who was based on his own personal experience after being hit by a minivan. King described the finished product as \"the thing I like best out of all the things I've done.\" The series is known for its tangential plots and characters who recur throughout, as King called it a \"novelization for television\". King committed to write the story line for the following year, should ABC decide to continue the series. While written as a miniseries, many fans wanted it to be renewed for a second season, and Stephen King had a storyboard written out for one. After incredibly successful ratings for the first episode, the highest rating drama debut of the year on ABC, ratings plummeted thereafter. Despite being cancelled, the series did receive Emmy Award nominations for Special Visual Effects for a Series and Main Title Design. ==Episodes== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\" |- !style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" width=\"20\" | Series # !style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" | Title !style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" | Writer !style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" | Director !style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" width=\"120\" | Original airdate !style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" width=\"120\" | Setting date |} ==Reception== The show received mixed reviews from critics. The New York Times review argued that the \"plot unfolds disjointedly and without enough suspense.\" CNN felt the premiere was promising and the \"jittery pacing and oddball sensibility\" were reminiscent of Twin Peaks. The USA Today review stated that the show \"does have a few frightening moments, but they don't compensate for the lackluster performances, the absence of character development, humor or pacing, or the wild fluctuations in tone.\" ==Songs played during the series== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\" |- !style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" | Song title !style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" | Performed by !style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" | Episode !style=\"color:#000000; background-color: #A4937B\" | Extra info |- | \"Worry About You\" | Ivy | All episodes | Theme song for the series, and heard throughout episodes. |- | \"Red Dragon Tattoo\" | Fountains of Wayne | \"Thy Kingdom Come\" (and others) | First heard while Peter is jogging. |- | \"I'll Be Seeing You\" | Frank Sinatra | \"Thy Kingdom Come\" | Heard when the wife receives the news of the accident. |- | \"Wee Wee Hours\" | Chuck Berry | \"The West Side of Midnight\" | Heard at the start of the episode. |- | \"Where's Your Head At\" | Basement Jaxx | \"The Young and the Headless\" | Played while the headless body searches for his head. |- | \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" | Unknown Artist ** | \"Butterfingers\" | Sung by many characters, including Paul. ** The song was written by Jack Norworth in 1908. |- | \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\" | Steam | \"Goodbye Kiss\" | Sung while operating on a suicidal prisoner. |- | \"Gin and Juice\" | The Gourds | \"Thy Kingdom Come\" | Heard while Dr. Stegman is driving to the hospital and the people outside of the mission are taunting him while he parks. |- | \"Time Has Come Today\" | The Chambers Brothers | \"Finale\" | Sung during the beginning of the finale. |- | \"I Don't Know Why I Love You\" | Ivy | \"Hook's Kingdom\" | Played while Dr. Hook and Dr. Draper are talking in Hook's bedroom. |} ==Distribution== ===Broadcasters=== * Australia: Seven Network / Prime Television / Sci Fi Channel (Australia) * Argentina: SyFy Channel / Space * Belgium: VT4 * Brazil: AXN * Canada: ABC * Chile: RED TV * Denmark: TV3 * Finland: Nelonen * France: M6 * Germany: Kabel 1 * Greece : Mega Channel * Hong Kong: TVB Pearl * Hungary: AXN Sci Fi / RTL Klub * Honduras: SyFy Channel/AXN * Italy: Italia 1 * Poland: TVP2 / AXN ===Home video=== The entire series was released on DVD.
