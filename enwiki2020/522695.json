    "text": "The Alaouite dynasty, or Alawite dynasty (, Sul\u0101lat al-\u02bfAlawiyy\u012bn al- F\u012bl\u0101l\u012byn), is the current Moroccan royal family. Sharif ibn Ali became Prince of Tafilalt in 1631. His son Mulay Al-Rashid (1664\u20131672) was able to unite and pacify the country. The Alaouites claim descent from a relative of prophet Muhammad and are the Arab ruling family of Morocco. The name Alaouites stems from Ali son of Abu Taalib ==Centralised state== The organisation of the sultanate developed under Ismail Ibn Sharif (1672\u20131727), who, against the opposition of local tribes, began to create a unified state. Because the Alaouites had difficult relations with many of the country's Berber and Bedouin-Arab tribes, Isma'\u012bl formed a new army of black slaves, the Black Guard. However, the unity of Morocco did not survive his death\u2014in the ensuing power struggles the tribes became a political and military force once again. During Muhammad III's reign (1757\u20131790) the kingdom was once again united and the administration reorganised. A renewed attempt at centralisation was abandoned, and the tribes were allowed to preserve their autonomy. Under Abderrahmane (1822\u20131859) Morocco fell under the influence of the European powers. After Morocco supported the Algerian independence movement of Emir Abd al-Qadir, it was attacked and defeated by the French in 1844 at the Battle of Isly and made to abandon its support. ==European contact and the French protectorate== During the reigns of Muhammad IV (1859\u20131873) and Hassan I (1873\u20131894), the Alaouites tried to foster trading links, above all with European countries and the United States. The army and administration were also modernised to improve control over the Berber and Bedouin tribes. With the war against Spain (1859\u20131860) came direct involvement in European affairs. Although the independence of Morocco was guaranteed at the Treaty of Madrid (1880), the French gained ever greater influence. German attempts to counter this growing influence led to the First Moroccan Crisis of 1905\u20131906 and the Second Moroccan Crisis of 1911. Eventually the Moroccans were forced to recognise the French protectorate through the Treaty of Fez, signed on December 3, 1912. At the same time the Rif area of northern Morocco was raised under Spanish control. ==List of Alaouite rulers== From 1631 to 1666 the Alaouite dynasty ruled as princes of Tafilalt: *Moulay Ali Cherif (1631\u20131635) *Muhammad ibn Sharif (1635\u20131664) *Al-Rashid (1664\u20131666) In 1666 Mulay Al- Rashid was proclaimed Sultan of Morocco at Fez: *Al-Rashid (1666\u20131672) *Mawlay Ismail Ibn Sharif (1672\u20131727) *Abu'l Abbas Ahmad II (1727\u20131728) (first time) *Abdalmalik (1728) *Abu'l Abbas Ahmad II (1728\u20131729) (second time) *Abdallah (1729\u20131734) (first time) *Ali (1734\u20131736) *Abdallah (1736) (second time) *Mohammed II (1736\u20131738) *Al-Mostadi (1738\u20131740) (first time) *Abdallah (1740\u20131741) (third time) *Zin al-Abidin (1741) *Abdallah (1741\u20131742) (fourth time) *Al-Mostadi (1742\u20131743) (second time) *Abdallah (1743\u20131747) (fifth time) *Al-Mostadi (1747\u20131748) (third time) *Abdallah (1748\u20131757) (sixth time) *Mohammed III (1757\u20131790) *Yazid (1790\u20131792)Abdication of Abdelhafid in 1912 *Mulay Suleiman (1792\u20131822) *Abderrahmane (1822\u20131859) *Mohammed IV (1859\u20131873) *Hassan I (1873\u20131894) *Abdelaziz (1894\u20131908) *Abdelhafid (1908\u20131912) Under the French protectorate (1912\u20131956): *Yusef (1912\u20131927) *King Mohammed V (1927\u20131961), changed title of ruler from Sultan to King in 1957.
