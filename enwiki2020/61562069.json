Spain baptized the archipelago with the name of the Caroline Islands - in honor of the Spanish king Carlos II - until the Germans arrived in 1885 and tried to impose a protectorate. The Spanish government protested and appealed to Holy See. The Treaty of Paris, in December 1898, ended the war between Spain and United States, in which Spain lost Guam , Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. For 25 million pesetas, Madrid sold the Carolinas archipelago to Germany after signing the German-Spanish Treaty (1899).http://www.casaasia.es/pdf/micronesia.pdf II.
