    "text": "Joseph Charles Trapani (born July 1, 1988) is an American-Italian basketball player. He played college basketball for Vermont and Boston College. ==College career== Trapani played at Daniel Hand High School in Madison, Connecticut and initially chose to play college basketball at the University of Vermont after bigger-named schools such as Virginia and Boston College wanted him to spend a year in prep school. He averaged 11.4 points and 4.4 rebounds per game and was named to the America East Conference All-Rookie team in 2007. In the offseason, Trapani decided that he wanted to play at a higher level of competition and transferred to Boston College of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Trapani was a three-year starter for the Eagles, earning third- team All-ACC honors as a junior in 2009\u201310 and as a senior in 2010\u201311. ==Professional career== Following the close of his college career, Trapani was not drafted in the 2011 NBA draft and the 2011 lockout prevented him attending an NBA training camp. He signed with A.S. Junior Casale of Italy's Lega Basket Serie A, but left the club early in the season due to contract issues, moving to Fulgor Libertas Forl\u00ec and then closing the 2011\u201312 season with the Maine Red Claws of the NBA Development League. After stints with Medi Bayreuth in Germany and Spirou Charleroi in Belgium, Trapani signed with SPO Rouen Basket of France's top division for the 2014\u201315 season. He averaged 10.2 points and 7.5 rebounds for the club before being lost for the season with a shoulder injury in March 2015.
