She moved to England as a young girl, residing in Kensington in 1891 with her mother and elder half-siblings Lili and John Pemberton. The head of the household was Alfred du Cros, managing director of a mining corporation who was born in Ireland. The four servants living in the house indicate a comfortable middle-class existence.1891 Census Her father died in Louisiana in 1901,New Orleans, Louisiana, Death Records Index, 1804-1949 after which her mother remarried to Alfred du Cros.England & Wales, Civil Registration Marriage Index, 1837-1915 On occasion, Marcelle used this surname. She became a naturalised British subject in 1916 and in 1934 was married in Fulham to Ellert Webster Forbes.Register of Births Marriages and Deaths, Fulham, Oct-Dec 1934. She died at a comparatively early age only four years later in 1938 at \"Sorrento\", Lyme Regis, the \"beloved wife of Major Ellert Forbes\".The Times (London, England), Thursday, Apr 28, 1938; pg. 1; Issue 47980. She is buried in the Church of St Candida and Holy Cross in Whitchurch Canonicorum, for, in 1939, Ellert Forbes, in a letter to The Times appealing for funds for the restoration of that church, mentions that his wife is buried there not far from the tomb of Saint Candida. He thinks this might be of note to those interested in \u201cinternational gastronomy\u201d, and that \u201cIt was not her only aim to teach the appreciation of good food, but she hoped that by telling us how other nations fared, we might learn to understand each other better and to live more peaceably.\u201dThe Times (London, England), Wednesday, Apr 19, 1939; pg. 10; Issue 48283 There is a story behind her adoption of the name Countess Morphy. In the eighteenth century, an Irish aristocrat, Michael Morphy, took his family to Spain. A son, Don Diego Morphy, settled in Louisiana. He was in San Domingo when the French Revolution began and fled aboard an English ship to Charleston, South Carolina. By a second marriage he had a daughter, Emma, who married David Hincks. Marcelle was a descendant of this union, giving her some connection with the surname Morphy.Fred Kelso, For The Love of Fungus, etc, 2009, drawing on: Mrs Regina Morphy-Voitier,The life of Paul Morphy in Vieux Carre of New-Orleans and Abroad,1926. ==Writing career== Countess Morphy is nowadays mainly connected with cookery and food writing but she began her career in print as a dance critic. She wrote on ancient Greek dance for the Nineteenth Century'The Dance in Ancient Greece', Nineteenth Century, March 1906 and the Revue arch\u00e9ologique,'Representations of dancing on early Greek vases', Revue arch\u00e9ologique ser. 4, vol. 14 (1909), pp. 351-369. and began contributing to The New Age in 1910.'The Russian Dancers : M. Mordkin', The New Age, Vol. 7, No. 12 (1910), pp. 278-279; 'Personality in Dancing : Anna Pavlova', The New Age, Vol. 7, No. 13 (1910), pp. 303-304; 'The Dance Critic', The New Age, Vol. 7, No. 14 (1910), pp. 328-329;'Dancing and Anthropology', The New Age Vol. 7, No. 17 (1910), pp. 400-401; 'A Letter From Spain: A Spanish Dancer ', The New Age, Vol. 7, No. 21 (1910), pp. 492-493; 'Some Observations on Primitive Dancing', The New Age, Vol. 11. No. 18 (1912), pp. 427-428; 'Some Observations of Primitive Dancing', Vol. 11, No. 19 (1912), pp. 450-451. In that year she produced her first book, a slim volume entitled The Japanese Dance. As a critic, she also wrote about the great modern dancers of her day, such as Pavlova and Isadora Duncan. Her early cookery books were, to judge by the titles, and the speed of publication, fairly lightweight: Lightning Cookery (1931), The Kiddies Cookery Cards (1932), 100 ways of Cooking Eggs (1932), The Memorandum Cookbook (1932) and Picnic Snacks, (1933). All published by Michael Joseph in conjunction with Selfridges, they were probably associated with her employment by the department store as a cookery demonstrator. Elizabeth David recalled attending her cookery classes at Selfridges as a young girl and being impressed with her expertise. The book on which her writing reputation rests, Recipes of All Nations, was published by Selfridges in 1935. A massive book of 800 pages, each of 18 chapters covers a country. There are two other chapters; on \u2018The Creole Cookery of New Orleans\u2019 (with an introduction outlining the history of this her homeland) and a final one on \u2018Cookery of Many Lands\u2019. Despite her husband\u2019s opinion that she wrote to promote peace, she is pessimistic about the role of cookery in international affairs in her preface: Morphy goes on to say her motive in writing the book \u2018is to help the modern housewife who takes an intelligent interest in cooking to have excellent, varied and inexpensive food in her own home.\u2019 She does not flatter her readers, asserting that \u2018English food is apt to be monotonous, and the average woman is frightened of foreign cookery.\u2019 She concludes by hoping to dispel the myths about foreign cookery and introduce English housewives to the ordinary cooking of foreign lands. As well as her own expertise, she called on that of various chefs who cooked in \u2018ethnic\u2019 restaurants to be found in London in her day: Mr S.K. Cheng of the Shanghai Emporium and Restaurant in Greek Street advised on Chinese food and Madam N. Wolkoff, proprietor of the Russian Tea Room in London helped with the Russian chapter. (So, if housewives did not cook foreign food, middle-class ones in London could experience it in restaurants.)Morphy, Recipes of all Nations, pp. 711, 422. Although some critics picked on the inevitable mistakes which occurred in this giant and wide-ranging book, and some ridiculed the recipe for fricass\u00e9e of iguana from Guinea, on the whole the work was greeted with enthusiasm and was in print for a long period. A review in the Times noted that she wrote for those needing to cook a good meal for a hungry family and thus cited bourgeois and peasant recipes, which were also economical. The reviewer questioned the absence of chapters on British cookery- did she hold it in too low esteem? The Times (London, England), Friday, Feb 01, 1935; pg. 9; Issue 46977. Nowadays, books on foreign cuisines, many of them associated with television series, are common. Recipes of All Nations is the ancestor of these and it is still a good read, and useful in the kitchen, today. ==Works== ===As Marcelle Azra Hincks=== * The Japanese Dance, 1910 ===As Countess Morphy=== *The memorandum cookery book, 1932 * 100 ways of cooking eggs, 1932 * The Kiddies Cookery Cards, 1932 *Picnic Snacks, 1933 *Recipes of all Nations, 1935 *The Kitchen Library vols 1 to 6, 1935-6 * The Polyglot Cookery Series vols 1-3., 1935-6 *Mushroom Recipes, 1936 *English recipes, including the traditional dishes of Scotland, Ireland & Wales, 1936 *Good Food from Italy: A Receipt Book, 1937 *The Kitchen Library, 1937 ===Posthumous=== *The Kitchen Encyclopaedia, 1946 *1948 British Receipts, 1946 ==References== Category:1883 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Writers from New Orleans Category:American emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:English food writers Category:Women cookbook writers Category:Women food writers Category:20th-century American women writers Category:20th-century British women writers Category:People from Kensington ",
