It was formed in the 1970s by centrist Christian Democrats who had left the Social Christian Party and the left wing of the Conservative Party who were oriented towards Liberation theology. It officially registered as a political party in 1979. It was originally considered a centre-left party. Later in the 1990s, it shifted to the centre-right. It reached its first great success in 1978 when party member Osvaldo Hurtado became the running mate on the successful presidential ticket of Jaime Rold\u00f3s of the Concentration of People's Forces. Hurtado served as President of Ecuador from 1981 to 1984 due to Rold\u00f3s's death in office. It was Ecuador's largest political party, having won 35% of the seats in the 1998 elections to the Congreso Nacional. In the 1998 presidential elections, party member Jamil Mahuad was elected president, and after a coup d'\u00e9tat and brief military rule, he was succeeded in 2000 by the vice-president, Gustavo Noboa, who was also in the party.
