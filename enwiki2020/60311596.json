    "text": "The Turkana Geothermal Power Station, is a geothermal power station under development in Kenya. ==Location== The power station would be located in the Suguta Valley, Turkana County, in the arid north-western Kenya, immediately south of Lake Turkana. This location is near the settlement of Katilia, approximately , by road, south-east of Lodwar, where the county headquarters are located. This location is approximately , by road, north-northwest of Nairobi, Kenya's capital and largest city. ==Overview== Reconnaissance surveys by a team from the British Geological Survey indicated the occurrence of a hydro-thermal system in the project area. In 2011, further surface studies revealed a high-temperature resource area covering , with sub-surface temperatures of about and an estimated potential to generate up to 750 megawatts of electricity. Olsuswa Energy Limited, a locally registered company plans to develop this power station, starting with a 70 megawatt power station, which is expected to expand to 140 megawatts, over a five to eight year period. The electricity generated is expected to be interrelated into the national electricity grid. In April 2018, Olsuswa Energy Limited signed a memorandum of understanding with the Turkana County government in the presence of the elected leaders of the community and the public. The development is expected to bring jobs and improved living standards of the residents. ==Ownership== The owners of the project are Olsuswa Energy Limited, co-owned by Manga Mugwe, a Kenyan investor and politician. The project area covers an estimated . ==Funding== The entire project is expected to cost US$420, spread out over a 5-8 year period. The owner/developers expect to raise the funds though equity and institutional loans. In November 2017, the African Union Commission granted US$980,000 towards the development of this power station. ==See also== *List of power stations in Kenya *Energy in Kenya ==References== ==External links== * Website of Olsuswa Energy Limited * The Rise of East Africa As An Alternative Energy Mecca * BVC Geothermal Project \u2013 Kenya Category:Geothermal power stations in Kenya Category:Power stations in Kenya ",
