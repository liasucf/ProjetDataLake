General Alumni Society, p. 175 From offices in Asbury Park, New Jersey, Frank L. Bodine designed a number of passenger depots for the Central Railroad of New Jersey, including Somerville, White House and Westfield. The Somerville depot is especially notable. The 1890 structure is perhaps the most distinctive station in the Raritan Valley, with its large stone arches, variety of dormers and corner turret with bell-shaped roof. In addition to the many early New Jersey railroad stations, Bodine designed multiple civic, commercial and major residential commissions in New Jersey, New York, and Florida from the 1890s to the 1930s. One of the most notable structures he designed is the office building that housed the offices of Woodrow Wilson at the time of his election to presidency and the site of his acceptance.

Tilton also designed a rectangular Annex at the rear of the building in 1914. Architect Charles Shilowitz designed two wings that form a courtyard at the front of the building in a major addition between 1929 and 1933.
