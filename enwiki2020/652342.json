Young Tom Arnold attended the Bedales School, the Institut Le Rosey, and Pembroke College, Oxford. == Political career == After unsuccessfully contesting the safe Labour seat of Manchester Cheetham in 1970, Arnold was elected to the British House of Commons for Hazel Grove in October 1974, defeating the Liberal incumbent Michael Winstanley; he had fought the same seat unsuccessfully in the previous General Election that same year. He served as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Hazel Grove until his retirement in 1997. From 1979 to 1982, Arnold was the Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Northern Ireland Office and later in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In 1983, Arnold was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party under Chairmen Cecil Parkinson and John Gummer. When Arnold began office, in 1974, he was one of the youngest members of Parliament, along with Anthony Nelson and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, later joined in 1977 by both Andrew MacKay and Tim Smith. Together, during the 1970s, the five were referred to as \"The Tories' Young Men\", with Arnold being the only backbencher in the group. Arnold was an ardent supporter of the European Economic Community during his time in Parliament. == References == == External links == * Category:1947 births Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Living people Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979 Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983 Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992 Category:UK MPs 1992\u20131997 Category:People educated at Bedales School Category:Alumni of Institut Le Rosey Category:Knights Bachelor Category:People from Petersfield Category:Politicians awarded knighthoods Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Hazel Grove ",
