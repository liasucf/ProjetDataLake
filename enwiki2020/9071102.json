The name Protestant Action Force (PAF) was used by loyalists, especially members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), to claim responsibility for a number of paramilitary attacks during the Troubles.CAIN Web Service Abstracts on Organisations It was first used in this context in 1974, and has since been used to claim the killings of at least 41 Catholic civilians.Sutton Index of Deaths: Crosstabulations (choose \"organisation\" and \"status\") It has been suggested that PAF was a covername used by a semi-independent group (or groups) within the UVF who were carrying out attacks on their own initiative or without the sanction of the UVF leadership. Almost all of the attacks claimed by the PAF took place in North Belfast/Newtownabbey and the area of County Armagh/Tyrone known as the \"murder triangle\". The name was first used during 1974\u20131976. All of the attacks in Armagh/Tyrone during this period have been linked to the Glenanne gang. This was a group comprising members of the Mid Ulster UVF, British soldiers from the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), and police officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The name was revived in 1982. In the 1980s, the PAF claimed about 15 attacks in the Belfast area and two in Armagh. UDR soldiers were convicted of the two Armagh attacks. The PAF claimed its last attacks in the early 1990s. All were in north Armagh and there have been allegations of security force involvement in them. On 24 November 1974, shortly after the name first appeared, an interview with three unidentified men was published in the Sunday World. They claimed to represent a loyalist group that had existed since 1971, was made up of former British soldiers and had killed 28 people in the past two months. When asked if they belonged to the PAF they replied \"no comment\". Later in the interview they stated: \"You can say we are members of the Mid-Ulster unit of the Protestant Task Force\".First Barron Report (2003), pp.45-47 Former British Intelligence officer Colin Wallace claimed that the three men were known to British Intelligence and were involved in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings,First Barron Report (2003), p.174 which has been linked to the Glenanne gang. In a September 1975 letter, Wallace states that most of the loyalist killings in Armagh/Tyrone in 1975, including the Miami Showband killings, were carried out by the Protestant Task Force or PTF. He states there are rumours the group is linked to the Special Duties Team based at British Army HQ in Lisburn. This was a team of British soldiers involved in undercover operations.Transcripts of a 27 September 2006 public hearing on the Fourth Barron Report.
