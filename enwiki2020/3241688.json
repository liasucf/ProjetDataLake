    "text": "\"Don't Know What to Tell Ya\" is a song by American singer Aaliyah. It was initially written by Static Major and Timbaland for the singer's third studio album Aaliyah (2001). While it failed to make the final cut, it was eventually included on the singer's first posthumous compilation album, I Care 4 U (2002). Released in mid-2003, the song was the second and final single from I Care 4 U in the European and Asian markets. In North America and Asia, the final single off the album was \"Come Over\". ==Composition== \"Don't Know What to Tell Ya\" has a \"noir-funk feel that evokes Blade Runner\" and the song contains a sample from the song \"Batwannis Beek\" performed by Algerian singer Warda Al-Jazairia. On the song Aaliyah is telling a story about a failing relationship. ==Critical reception== Arion Berger from Rolling Stone praised Aaliyah's vocals on the song saying, \"Her sweet, strong voice whips around the ambivalence in Don't Know What to Tell Ya and melts the ends off the lines in the title song.\" ==Track listing== ;UK CD single # \"Don't Know What to Tell Ya\" (edit version) \u2013 3:03 # \"Don't Know What to Tell Ya\" (Handcuff Remix) \u2013 5:18 # \"Miss You\" (music video) ;European CD single # \"Don't Know What to Tell Ya\" (radio edit) \u2013 3:35 # \"Don't Know What to Tell Ya\" (Thomas Eriksen Mix) \u2013 5:18 # \"Don't Know What to Tell Ya\" (Intenso Project Remix) \u2013 6:58 # \"Don't Know What to Tell Ya\" (album version) \u2013 5:02 *Note: The \"Handcuff Remix\" on the UK CD single and the \"Thomas Eriksen Mix\" on the European CD single are the same remix. ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (2003) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |- |align=\"left\"|Europe (European Hot 100 Singles) |align=\"center\"|75 |- |- |- |- |- |Netherlands (Tipparade) |align=\"center\"|7 |- |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2002 singles Category:2003 singles Category:Aaliyah songs Category:Funk songs Category:Song recordings produced by Timbaland Category:Songs written by Timbaland Category:Songs written by Static Major ",
