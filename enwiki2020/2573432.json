    "text": "The Luise\u00f1o or Pay\u00f3mkawichum are an indigenous people of California who, at the time of the first contacts with the Spanish in the 16th century, inhabited the coastal area of southern California, ranging from the present-day southern part of Los Angeles County to the northern part of San Diego County, and inland . In the Luise\u00f1o language, the people call themselves Pay\u00f3mkawichum (also spelled Pay\u00f3mkowishum), meaning \"People of the West.\" After the establishment of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia (The Mission of Saint Louis King of France), \"the Pay\u00f3mkawichum began to be called San Luise\u00f1os, and later, just Luise\u00f1os by Spanish missionaries due to their proximity to this San Luis Rey mission. Today there are six federally recognized tribes of Luise\u00f1o bands based in southern California, all with reservations. Another organized band has not received federal recognition. == History == === Pre- colonization === The Pay\u00f3mkawichum were successful in utilizing a number of natural resources to provide food and clothing. They had a close relationship with their natural environment. They used many of the native plants, harvesting many kinds of seeds, berries, nuts, fruits, and vegetables for a varied and nutritious diet. The land also was inhabited by many different species of animals which the men hunted for game and skins. Hunters took antelopes, bobcats, deer, elk, foxes, mice, mountain lions, rabbits, wood rats, river otters, ground squirrels, and a wide variety of insects.J.S. Williams, 2003 The Luise\u00f1o used toxins leached from the California buckeye to stupefy fish in order to harvest them in mountain creeks.C.M. Hogan, 2008 Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. In the 1920s, A. L. Kroeber put the 1770 population of the Luise\u00f1o (including the Juane\u00f1o) at 4,000\u20135,000; he estimated the population in 1910 as 500. The historian Raymond C. White proposed a historic population of 10,000 in his work of the 1960s. Pablo Tac, born in 1820, recorded, \"perhaps from oral history and official records\" that approximately five thousand people were living in Pay\u00f3mkawichum territory prior to the arrival of the Spanish. === Mission period === Luise\u00f1o home in 1900 in the Temescal valley Luise\u00f1o basket maker outside of her home Pala The first Spanish missions were established in California in 1769. For nearly 30 years, Pay\u00f3mkawichum \"who lived in the autonomous territories on the mesas and coastal valleys\" in the western region of their traditional territory, \"witnessed the constant incursion of caravans that moved north and south through their land on El Camino Real.\" Spanish missionaries established Mission San Luis Rey de Francia entirely within the borders of Pay\u00f3mkawichum territory in 1798. Known as the \"King of the Missions,\" it was founded on June 13, 1798 by Father Ferm\u00edn Francisco de Lasu\u00e9n, located in what is now Oceanside, California, in northern San Diego County. It was the Spanish First Military District. == Language == The Luise\u00f1o language belongs to the Cupan group of Takic languages, within the major Uto-Aztecan family of languages. About 30 to 40 people speak the language. In some of the independent bands, individuals are studying the language, language preservation materials are being compiled, and singers sing traditional songs in the language. Pablo Tac, born at San Luis Rey in 1822, devised a written form of Luise\u00f1o language through \"his study of Latin grammar and Spanish\" while working \"among international scholars in Rome.\" Although Tac had to conform to \"Latin grammatical constructions, his word choice and his narrative form, along with his continual translation between Luise\u00f1o and Spanish, establish an Indigenous framework for understanding Luise\u00f1o.\" == Villages == * 'ah\u00fauya, near the upper course of San Luis Rey River * 'ak\u00edipa, near Kahpa * '\u00e1alapi, San Pascual south of the middle course of the San Luis Rey River * '\u00e1away, on a head branch of Santa Margarita River * Hur\u00fampa, west of Riverside * H\u00fayyulkum, on the upper course of San Luis Rey River * 'ik\u00e1ymay, near San Luis Rey Mission * Q\u00e1xpa, on the middle course of San Luis Rey River * Kat\u00faktu, between Santa Margarita and San Luis Rey Rivers, north of San Luis Rey * Q\u00e9e'ish, Q\u00e9ch, south of San Luis Rey Mission * Qew\u00e9w, on the upper course of San Luis Rey River * K\u00f3olu, near the upper course of San Luis Rey River * K\u00fauki, on the upper course of San Luis Rey River * Kw\u00e1a'alam, on the lower course of San Luis Rey River * Mal\u00e1amay, northeast of Pala * M\u00e9exa, on Santa Margarita River northwest of Temecula * Mix\u00e9elum pomp\u00e1wvo, near Escondido * Ng\u00f3oriva * Pa'\u00e1a'aw, near T\u00e1i Palomar mountain * P\u00e1ayaxchi, on Elsinore Lake * P\u00e1ala, at Pala * P\u00e1alimay, on the coast between Buena Vista and Agua Hedionda Creeks * Panakare, north of Escondido * P\u00e1a\u0219uku, near the headwaters of San Luis Rey River * P\u00e1awma, east of Pala Pauma * Poch\u00f3orivo, on the upper course of San Luis Rey River * S\u00f3owmay, south of the middle course of San Luis Rey River * \u0218ak\u00edshmay (Luise\u00f1o or Diegue\u00f1o), on the boundary line between the two peoples * \u0218\u00edikapa, Palomar * \u0218uv\u00f3owu \u0218uv\u00f3ova, east of San Jacinto Soboba * T\u00e1axanashpa, La Jolla * T\u00e1a'akwi, at the head of Santa Margarita River * T\u00e1akwish po\u0219\u00e1ppila, east of Palomar Mountain * T\u00e1'i, close to Palomar Mountain * Tap\u00e1'may, north of Kat\u00faktu * Tem\u00e9eku, east of Temecula * T\u00f3mqav, west of Pala * '\u00fashmay, at Las Flores * Wax\u00e1wmay, Guajome on San Luis Rey River above San Luis Rey * Wiy\u00f3oya, at the mouth of San Luis Rey River * Wi'\u00e1asamay, east of San Luis Rey * W\u00e1\u0219xa,Rincon near the upper course of San Luis Rey River * Yam\u00ed', near H\u00fayyulkum == Tribes == Soboba Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians La Jolla Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians Today Luise\u00f1o people are enrolled in the following federally recognized tribes: * La Jolla Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians * Pala Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians * Pauma Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians * Pechanga Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians * Rincon Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians * Soboba Band of Luise\u00f1o Indians Additionally, the San Luis Rey Band of Luise\u00f1os is organized and active in northern San Diego County, but is not currently recognized by the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs. ==Notable Luise\u00f1os== * Pete Calac (1892\u20131968), football player * Freddy Herrera, musician * James Luna (1950\u20132018), performance artist * Jamie Okuma (b. 1977), beadwork artist, fashion designer * Fritz Scholder (1937\u20132005), painter and sculptor * Ruth-Ann Thorn (b. 1965), art dealer, documentary film maker * Pablo Tac (1822\u20131841), scholar == See also == * Luise\u00f1o language * Luise\u00f1o traditional narratives * Mission Indians * Pauma Massacre * Temecula Massacre * USS Luiseno (ATF-156) * Kumeyaay people == References == ;Citations ;Works cited * * * * * == Further reading == * Bean, Lowell John and Shipek, Florence C.
