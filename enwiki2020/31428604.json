Later linked to the regular Cheshire Regiment as its 4th (Militia) Battalion, the unit served in the Second Anglo- Boer War before disbandment in 1908. ==History== The regiment was originally raised in Macclesfield on 25 July 1853 to provide additional Army strength during the Crimean War. On 1 July 1881 it was renamed 4th (Militia) Battalion, Cheshire Regiment, as part of the reorganisation of the militia made during the Childers reforms. The battalion was embodied on 22 January 1900 for service during the Second Boer War in South Africa. 650 officers and men left Queenstown in the SS Orotava the following month for Cape Town. Subsequently, awarded battle honour South Africa 1900\u2013'02. Most of the battalion, 15 officers and 420 men, left Cape Town in April 1902 and arrived at Southampton the following month. As part of the Haldane Reforms in 1908, the battalion was disbanded on 31 July in that year. ==Commanding officers== The first commanding officer was Lieutenant-Colonel William Davenport Davenport, appointed 5 April 1853. Following Davenport's death, he was succeeded by George Cornwall Legh MP on 20 March 1869. On Legh's resignation Henry Brougham Loch was appointed lieutenant-colonel on 16 July 1873. In June 1884 Loch, by now knighted and governor of Victoria, Australia, retired and was made honorary colonel of the battalion.
