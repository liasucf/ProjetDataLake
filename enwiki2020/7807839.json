    "text": "The Tabriz\u2013Ankara pipeline is a long natural gas pipeline, which runs from Tabriz in North-West Iran to Ankara in Turkey. ==History== The construction of pipeline started in 1996 after signing a gas deal between Turkish and Iranian governments. The gas deal was signed on 30 August 1996. The pipeline was commissioned on 26 July 2001. The Iran-Turkey pipeline has allegedly been blown up several times by PKK fighters. On 1 January 2008, Iran reduced gas supplies to Turkey, and on 7 January 2008 gas supplies were stopped because of cut-off gas supplies from Turkmenistan. The supplies were restored on 27 January 2008. The supply was cut off again in February 2008 because of bad weather conditions. ==Technical features== The Turkish section, operated by BOTA\u015e, cost US$600 million. The Turkish annual import consists normally 11 billion cubic meters of natural gas. In Erzurum, the South Caucasus Pipeline is linked to the Iran-Turkey pipeline. ==See also== *Iran-Turkey relations ==References== Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2001 Category:Iran\u2013Turkey relations Category:Natural gas pipelines in Iran Category:Natural gas pipelines in Turkey ",
