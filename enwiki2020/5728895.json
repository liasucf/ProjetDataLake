    "text": "AMES, short Air Ministry Experimental Station, was the name given to the British Air Ministry's radar development team at Bawdsey Manor in the immediate pre-World War II era. The team was forced to move on three occasions, changing names as part of these moves, so the AMES name applies only to the period between 1936 and 1939. Although used as a name by the team itself only briefly, the AMES acronym became the basis for naming Royal Air Force radar systems through the war. The same numbering sequence was used after the war as well, but often dropped the AMES from the name. A good example is the Type 80, which was officially AMES Type 80, but often appears without that marque. Many post-war systems were also assigned a rainbow code and are better known by that name. The AMES numbering scheme was often ad hoc, with some entries simply being other sets operating together. For instance, the Type 21 was simply a Type 13 and Type 14 in a single vehicle convoy. In other cases Types differ only in minor details, like the Type 31 through 34, which are the same radars mounted in various ways. They are also often out-of- order; the Type 8 was the prototype for the Type 7. ==Equipment== * AMES Type 1, Chain Home (CH) \u2013 Early Warning * AMES Type 2, Chain Home Low (CHL) \u2013 Early Warning, low altitude * AMES Type 3, Type 1 and Type 2 operating in close proximity * AMES Type 4, Chain Overseas (CO), also known as Intermediate (ICH) * AMES Type 5, Chain Overseas Low (COL) * AMES Type 6, Light Warning Set * AMES Type 7, Final static Ground-controlled interception (GCI) station (Happidrome) * AMES Type 8, Various marks of GCI radars, mobile and semi- static * AMES Type 9, Mobile Chain Home * AMES Type 10, Mobile Air Transportable System * AMES Type 11, Type 8 adapted to work at 600 MHz in case 1.5 m CHL/GCI was jammed * AMES Type 12, Low Frequency transportable Chain Home Low. * AMES Type 13, 10 cm \"Nodding\" Height Finder.

Two such collections put together. * AMES Type 100, 20\u201380 MHz Transponder-based navigation system \u2013 GEE-H * AMES Type 700, 1.7\u20132.0 MHz Hyperbolic navigation system \u2013 LORAN * AMES Type 7000, 30\u201360 MHz Hyperbolic navigation system \u2013 GEE ground station * AMES Type 9000, 200 MHz transponder-based navigation system \u2013 Oboe Mk I ground station \u2013 Oboe Mk III, S band ==Mobile units== Mobile radar units, usually consisting of COL, GCI, or similar equipment, mounted in vehicles, was used extensively overseas, and these units received numerical designations preceded by 'AMES', e.g., AMES 1505 \u2013 one of the units providing GCI coverage of the Naples sector during the Allied invasion of Italy. ==Fighter Direction Tenders== Three Landing Ship, Tank (LST) were converted into \"Fighter Direction Tenders\" (FDT), swapping their landing craft for Motor Launches and outfitted with AMES Type 11 and Type 15 fighter control radar to provide GCI coverage for air defence of the D-Day landing areas. Of these ships, FDT 216 was stationed off Omaha and Utah beaches, FDT 217 was allocated Sword, Juno, and Gold beaches. FDT 13 was used for coverage of the overall main shipping channel. In the period 6 to 26 June Allied fighters controlled by the FDTs resulted in the destruction of 52 enemy aircraft by day, and 24 enemy aircraft by night. ==Post-War== Post World War II in addition to the AMES Type XX designation new equipment was also allocated a Rainbow Code name during development, e.g., AMES Type 86 was allocated the code name Blue Anchor.
