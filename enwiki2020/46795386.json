Eaton's consecration was held on May 9, 2015, the Feast of St. Gregory the Theologian, at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, Miami, Florida. The Chief Consecrator was Katharine Jefferts Schori, Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, and the principal co-consecrators were Leopold Frade, the outgoing bishop of the diocese, and Robert J. O'Neill, Bishop of Colorado.

Schaefer of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and Bishop Graham H. Rights of the Moravian Church in North America. This was an historic liturgy, being the first time that bishops of these four churches have joined Episcopal bishops in the ordination of an Episcopal bishop. This ordination also united the ancient historic successions of the Old Catholic Church, the Mar Thoma Syrian Church and the Anglican Communion. Bishops from the Church of England, Spain, the Province of the West Indies, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico (both Provisional Bishop Wilfrido Ramos-Orench as well as retired Bishop David A. Alvarez-Vel\u00e1zquez), jurisdictions with large populations in Southeast Florida, were present and served as co-consecrators. Eaton succeeded Frade as IV Diocesan Bishop on January 9, 2016.

Bishop Eaton invited all the priests of the diocese to concelebrate The Eucharist. Eaton was escorted in and out of the service by the youth from throughout the diocese. The service ended with a Blessing of the City and a full peal of the change ringing bells; which took three hours to complete.
