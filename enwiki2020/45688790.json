    "text": "The Mississippi Center for Public Policy (MCPP) is a conservative think tank located in Jackson, Mississippi. The organization's stated mission is \"To advance the constitutional ideals of liberty and justice for all Mississippians by employing an evidenced-based approach to public policy whereby we advocate for and advance real conservative ideas with policy makers, members of the media, business leaders, the academic community, and private citizens.\" MCPP opposes the Affordable Care Act and Common Core. The organization advocates for education reform through increased school choice and charter schools. ==Mississippi Justice Institute== The institute has a legal arm called the Mississippi Justice Institute. In 2016, when the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Mississippi's public charter schools, the Mississippi Justice Institute intervened on behalf of parents whose children attend these charter schools. The Mississippi Justice Institute has also filed suit on behalf of a taxicab driver and an Uber driver in Jackson, Mississippi, arguing that the city's restrictive regulations on the taxi industry violate the civil rights of the drivers, who wish to start their own companies. In 2018, Aaron Rice became Director of the Mississippi Justice Institute. Former Directors include Shad White, who went on to become State Auditor of Mississippi, and D. Michael Hurst Jr., who became United States Attorney for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Non-profit organizations based in Mississippi Category:Political and economic think tanks in the United States Category:Conservative organizations in the United States ",
