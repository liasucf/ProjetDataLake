The Vert & Or first began to play in 1971 in the Quebec Universities Athletic Association, but only played for three seasons. The program was dropped after the 1973 season due to a shift in philosophy as many francophone universities placed an emphasis on community involvement and intramural athletic activities as opposed to intercollegiate athletics. That philosophy has shifted back to intercollegiate sports as Universit\u00e9 Laval, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and Sherbrooke each began programs in 1996, 2002 and 2003, respectively. ==See also== * U Sports ==References== ==External links== * Vert Category:U Sports teams in Quebec ",
