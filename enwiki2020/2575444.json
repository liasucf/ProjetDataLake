    "text": "Erastus Fairbanks (October 28, 1792November 20, 1864) was an American manufacturer, Whig politician, a founder of the Republican Party, and the 21st and 26th Governor of Vermont. ==Biography== Fairbanks was born in Brimfield, Massachusetts to Phebe (Paddock) Fairbanks (1760-1853) and Joseph Fairbanks (1763-1846). Ephraim Paddock, the brother of Phebe Paddock, was his uncle. He studied law but abandoned it for mercantile pursuits, and operated a store in Wheelock, Vermont. He married Lois Crossman (1792-1866) on May 30, 1815. The couple had nine children. ==Career== Marble bust of Fairbanks on display at the Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium, St. Johnsbury, Vermont. Finally settling in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, in 1824, Fairbanks formed a partnership, E. & T. Fairbanks & Co., with his brother Thaddeus for the manufacture of scales, stoves and plows. Thaddeus Fairbanks later invented the first platform scale, which made it possible to calculate the weight of farm products and other goods shipped by wagon and railroad car; the device proved so successful that the renamed Fairbanks Scales company became the largest employer in the state. The Fairbanks family was involved in numerous charitable and civic endeavors throughout St. Johnsbury and the surrounding towns, including the 1842 founding of St. Johnsbury Academy. Fairbanks was a member of the Vermont House of Representatives from 1836 to 1838. He was a Whig Presidential Elector for Vermont in 1844 and 1848. He was President of the Passumpsic Railroad, which completed a line from White River to St. Johnsbury in 1850. Though he would ultimately withdraw from the venture due to disputes about labor and planning with the Boston Associates, Fairbanks and his company would be the first to fund the Hadley Falls Dam project in 1846. The project, conceived by one of his salesmen and personal associates, George C. Ewing, ultimately created Holyoke, Massachusetts. Fairbanks was elected the 21st Governor of Vermont in 1852 and served until 1853. During this term, a law was passed forbidding the sale or traffic of intoxicating beverages. The law was not repealed until 1902. Fairbanks was one of the founders of the Republican Party, and a delegate from Vermont to the first Republican National Convention in 1856. He was 26th Governor of Vermont from 1860 to 1861. During his second term he rendered valuable aid in the equipment and dispatch of troops in the early days of the American Civil War. ==Family life== With his brothers Thaddeus and Joseph P., he founded St. Johnsbury Academy. He was the father of Horace Fairbanks and Franklin Fairbanks. ==Death== Fairbanks was a Congregationalist. He died in St. Johnsbury, Caledonia County, Vermont, on November 20, 1864 (age 72 years, 23 days). He is interred at Mt. Pleasant Cemetery, St. Johnsbury, Vermont. ==References== * *Fairbanks family papers at vermonthistory.org. ==Further reading== *Fairbanks, Lorenzo Sayles, Genealogy of the Fairbanks Family in America 1633\u20131897, Boston, 1897. * Inventory of the Erastus Fairbanks Papers, Special Collections, University of Vermont Library ==External links== *Ancestry.com *Fairbanks Museum in St. Johnsbury, Vermont *The Political Graveyard *National Governors Association * * Category:1792 births Category:1864 deaths Category:People from Brimfield, Massachusetts Category:People from St. Johnsbury, Vermont Category:American businesspeople Category:Governors of Vermont Category:Members of the Vermont House of Representatives Category:People of Vermont in the American Civil War Category:Vermont Whigs Category:Vermont Republicans Category:Union state governors Category:Whig Party state governors of the United States Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Republican Party state governors of the United States ",
