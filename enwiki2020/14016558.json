    "text": "\"Janine\" is the final single of rapper Bushido's album Von der Skyline zum Bordstein zur\u00fcck. The song contains a sample of \"Les M\u00e9moires Bless\u00e9es\" by French band Dark Sanctuary, used without permission. The band sued the rapper for using illegal sampling of eight of their songs, on his album.http://www.jurablogs.com/de/bushido-wegen-urheberrechtsverletzung- verklagt A remix produced by Screwaholic was released on the song's single and the best of complication Das Beste (2007).http://www.lastfm.de/music/Sonny+Black/_/Nie+Ein+Rapper+%28Screwaholic+Remix%29 The remix is also used for the video on Bushido's official YouTube channel. ==Contents== In the song itself, Bushido sings about a fourteen-year-old girl who was raped by her stepfather repeatedly, and eventually became impregnated by him. Forced to not only give birth to the baby in her own mother's basement, but also give it up almost immediately after; Janine, wrought with guilt, ends her own life by jumping from a bridge. ==Music video== In the video, however, the plot revolves around an older Janine looking back on when she was raped as a teenager, impregnated and abandoning her infant at the base of a church. Plagued by these painful memories as she goes about her daily routines, Janine drowns herself in alcohol and drugs at a rave-type-setting; but in the end, only becomes so immersed in her shame that she has an emotional breakdown right in the middle of the dance floor. At the end of the video, Janine is seen contemplating suicide on a bridge lingering over a highway, but then she leaves. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2007 singles Category:Bushido (rapper) songs Category:Sampling controversies Category:German-language songs Category:Songs about suicide Category:Songs about loneliness Category:Songs about parenthood Category:Songs about sexual assault Category:2007 songs Category:Rape in fiction ",
