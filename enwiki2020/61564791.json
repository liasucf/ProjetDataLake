The tournament is played at the Port Royal Golf Course, designed by Robert Trent Jones, in Southampton Parish, Bermuda. It is designated as an alternate event, opposite the WGC-HSBC Champions. The prize fund in 2019 was US$3,000,000. Following the cancellation of the 2020 WGC-HSBC Champions, the 2020 tournament was elevated to full FedEx Cup point event status, with the winner earning a 2021 Masters Tournament invitation. ==Winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" !Year!!Player!!Score!!To par!!Margin of victory!!Runner-up!!Winner's share ($)!!Purse ($) |- | align=center|2019 || Brendon Todd || align=center|260 || align=center|\u201324 || 4 strokes || Harry Higgs || align=right|540,000 || align=right|3,000,000 |} ==References== ==External links== * *Coverage on PGA Tour's official site Category:PGA Tour events Category:Golf in Bermuda Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2019 ",
