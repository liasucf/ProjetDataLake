    "text": "The Duck Lake Station Site is a former way station on the Overland Trail in Carbon County, Wyoming. Built in 1862, the site is located between the Dug Springs Station to the west and the Washakie Station to the east. Stations on the trail were typically about apart with the largest, most elaborate stations at intervals. The Duck Lake station was a more basic one-room building. All that remains of the station are its foundations. The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 6, 1978. ==References== ==External links== * Duck Lake Station Site at the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office Category:National Register of Historic Places in Carbon County, Wyoming Category:Overland Trail Category:Stagecoach stations on the National Register of Historic Places in Wyoming ",
