    "text": "The L\u00fcdenscheider Nachrichten is a local daily newspaper for L\u00fcdenscheid and the surrounding area in the southern part of the M\u00e4rkischer Kreis, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is the largest newspaper in L\u00fcdenscheid. It is published every day except Sunday, sometimes even on public holidays. It celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2004. The L\u00fcdenscheider Nachrichten is published by M\u00e4rkischer Zeitungsverlag, which also publishes the Meinerzhagener Zeitung, the Altenaer Kreisblatt, the Allgemeine Anzeiger (Halver) and the S\u00fcderl\u00e4nder Volksfreund (Werdohl). The L\u00fcdenscheider Nachrichten cooperates editorially and technically with the S\u00fcderl\u00e4nder Tageblatt (Plettenberg) and the Mendener Zeitung. The total circulation of all the above, printed in Meinerzhagen, is approximately 48,000 copies. The L\u00fcdenscheider Nachrichten is a local newspaper that takes all its regional news from the Westf\u00e4lische Anzeiger, which is published in Hamm and also supplies the regional news for a number of other newspapers. The L\u00fcdenscheider Nachrichten belongs to Dirk Ippen's media group, which also includes the M\u00fcnchner Merkur, the tabloid newspaper tz (Munich), the Kreiszeitung in Syke, the Oranienburger Generalanzeiger, the Altmark-Zeitung, the Fehmarnsche Tageblatt, the Offenbach-Post in Offenbach am Main, and the Hessische/Nieders\u00e4chsische Allgemeine in Kassel. The chief editor of the L\u00fcdenscheider Nachrichten is Hans Willems. ==Restructuring== As with many other newspapers, restructuring measures have also cost the L\u00fcdenscheider Nachrichten jobs in recent years. In 2004, the online edition and accounting were taken over by the editorial staff of the Westf\u00e4lischer Anzeiger in Hamm, resulting in the loss of jobs in L\u00fcdenscheid. In 2006, the L\u00fcdenscheider Nachrichten dismissed its photo editors, the work being taken over by the editors of the respective departments or freelancers. The companies left the Publishers' Association, and new employees are no longer paid according to collective bargaining agreements. A large part of the reporting now comes from freelancers. ==People at LN== * Dirk Ippen, owner * Volker Griese, journalist ==External links== * Website of the L\u00fcdenscheider Nachrichten * Main page: Westf\u00e4lischer Anzeiger ==See also== * List of newspapers in Germany Category:Daily newspapers published in Germany Category:Mass media in L\u00fcdenscheid ",
