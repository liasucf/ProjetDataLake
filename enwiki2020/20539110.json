    "text": "George Rolland House II (November 20, 1929 \u2013 July 14, 2016) was a Republican Assemblymember from California's 25th State Assembly district from 1994 until he was term limited in 2000. ==Pre Assembly Career== Prior to serving in the Assembly, House was an almond farmer from Hughson, CA. He served two years with the Modesto, CA police department before becoming a CHP officer and commander for thirty years. He was also a Stanislaus County Juvenile Traffic Court hearing officer. He also served on the Hughson school board and was an active Rotarian. ==1992 election== House ran for the newly created 25th Assembly district in 1992; however, he lost the primary to Barbara Keating-Edh who ended up losing to Margaret Snyder. He came in 4th place with just eleven percent of the vote.https://articles.latimes.com/1992-06-04/news/mn-1373_1_vote/6 ==1994 election== House ran for Assembly again in 1994. Although initially considered a weak candidate, he defeated Democratic incumbent Margaret Snyder in a heavily Republican year that saw the GOP take control of the California State Assembly for the first time since 1970. ==The 25th District== When House represented the seat from 1994 until 2000, it included half of Stanislaus County, all of Mariposa County and Tuolumne County. It also included most of Madera County and a small part of Fresno County. ==Proposition 34== House was a major opponent of Proposition 34 in 2000 which stated that 34% of the total annual state lottery revenues shall be allocated to benefit public education. However, it passed with 53% of the vote. ==2002 Congressional Election== House put a bid in for California's 18th Congressional District in 2002 in order to face troubled incumbent Gary Condit; however, he withdrew from the race prior to the election and still received 12.8% of the vote in the primary against then State Senator Dick Monteith who now serves as a Stanislaus County supervisor. ==Electoral history== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\" |+ Member, California State Assembly: 1995-2001 !|Year !|Office ! !|Democrat !|Votes !|Pct ! !|Republican !|Votes !|Pct ! |- |1992 |California State Assembly District 25 | | |Mike Kirros 16% Patrick O'Rourke 13% Margaret Snyder 59% | align=\"right\" |78,251 | |51.5% | | |George House 11% Barbara Keating-Edh 43% Bill Mattos 23% Norman Tergeson 16% | align=\"right\" |73,805 | |48.5% | |- |1994 |California State Assembly District 25 | | |Margaret Snyder | align=\"right\" |52,962 | |43% | | |George House | align=\"right\" |66,910 | |54.3% | |- |1996 |California State Assembly District 37 | | |Ed Elliott | align=\"right\" |54,033 | |38.3% | | |George House | align=\"right\" |82,558 | |58.5% | |- |1998 |California State Assembly District 37 | | |Wesley Firch | align=\"right\" |42,935 | |35.1% | | | George House | align=\"right\" |75,775 | |61.9% | |- |2002 |U.S. House of Representatives District 18 | | |Dennis Cardoza 53.1% Gary Condit* 38.7% | align=\"right\" |53,621 | |51% | | |George House 12.8% Dick Monteith 48.9% | align=\"right\" |45,960 | |43.7% | |} ==References== 2\\.
