The organ of the group was Rato Jhanda (\u0930\u093e\u0924\u094b \u091d\u0923\u094d\u0921\u093e, Red Flag).Rawal, Bhim Bahadur. Nepalma samyabadi andolan: udbhab ra vikas. Kathmandu: Pairavi Prakashan. p. 163. The group was sometimes known as the Rato Jhanda group. The group had its origins in the faction led by Bharat Mohan Adhikari in the early 1970s, which was formed by a section of the Eastern Koshi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of Nepal (which had practically separated itself from the mother party and functioned in an autonomous manner) and a small splinter section of the Gandaki-based Marxist-Leninist Revolutionary Communist Party. However, this tendency had been deserted by Bharat Mohan, when he joined the Central Nucleus. Before constituting itself as the Revolutionary Communist Organising Committee, the group was called the Red Flag District Committee (Rato Jhanda Zilla Samiti). On September 11, 1978, the group merged into the All Nepal Communist Revolutionary Coordination Committee (Marxist- Leninist).Rawal, Bhim Bahadur. Nepalma samyabadi andolan: udbhab ra vikas.
