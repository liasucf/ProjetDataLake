James Hubbard, Jr. Accessed 2019-08-22. He was one of only a handful of African Americans serving in the U.S. Merchant Marine fleet, and at 19, he became one of the youngest servicemen licensed by the U.S. Coast Guard as a marine engineer. Hubbard graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with his B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering in 1977 and 1979, respectively.MIT Black History. Faculty Notes: Teaching While Black at MIT. Accessed 2019-08-22. For his doctorate, Hubbard researched helicopter aeroacoustics, and in 1982, he became MIT\u2019s first black Ph.D. in mechanical engineering. Hubbard served on the faculty at MIT researching active vibration control of structures.University of Maryland A. James Clark School of Engineering (2013) \u201cHubbard Chosen for HistoryMakers Oral History Collection.\u201d Hubbard\u2019s research in the early 1980s led to what many consider the first example of an adaptive structure,Clark, Robert, William Saunders, Gary Gibbs (1998) Adaptive Structures: Dynamics and Control. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.: New York, NY one that can change its structural characteristics in response to external stimuli. Mechanical vibrations can cause systems \u2014 particularly large spacecraft structures such as telescopes and satellites \u2014 to fail or affect their precision. In 1985, Hubbard and coauthor Thomas Bailey published a seminal paper describing how a thin, continuous piezoelectric film could both sense vibration and apply its own electric force to dampen the vibrations of a steel beam.T. Bailey and J.E. Hubbard (1985) \u201cDistributed Piezoelectric-Polymer Active Vibration Control.\u201d J. Guidance. 8(5): 605\u2013611. doi.org/10.2514/3.20029 Hubbard was granted two patents for this research.Method and Apparatus Using a Piezoelectric Film for Active Control of Vibrations: U.S. Patent Number 4,565,940. January 21, 1986.Method and Apparatus for Active Control of Vibrations: U.S. Patent Number 4,626,730. December 2, 1986. Today, he is considered the founding father of the field of adaptive structures, which has numerous applications ranging from damping vibrations to morphing aircraft to deployable space structures. As an assistant professor at MIT, Hubbard received one of five nationwide IBM Young Faculty Development Awards.National Institute of Aerospace (2016) \u201cNIA Samuel P.
