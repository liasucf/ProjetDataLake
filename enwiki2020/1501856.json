    "text": "Obliterator is a side-scrolling arcade adventure computer game published by Psygnosis in 1988. It was released for Amiga, Atari ST, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and MS-DOS. The game was programmed by David H. Lawson and its graphics were made by Garvan Corbett and Jim Ray Bowers. The soundtrack was composed by David Whittaker and the cover art is by the artist Roger Dean. ==Summary== The control method is identical to that of Barbarian which was published the previous year. The game begins when the main character Drak is teleported into the alien spaceship that is approaching the earth. The objective of the game is to destroy the spaceship by finding certain objects from the ship. When the self-destruction is active, Drak has to find an escape shuttle before the spaceship blows up in order to survive. ==Reception== Obliterator was reviewed in Computer Gaming World as a fun, well-executed action game, albeit not a challenging one. The game was praised for using score not just as an arbitrary value, but also to determine the time left for the hero to escape. C-lehti (3/1988) gave five stars for Amiga version and also full ten points for its music, graphics, interest-factor and \"atmosphere\". The review says that the game shows that the Amiga computer is capable of delivering what users have been awaiting, using computer's capabilities in a way that makes gaming experience a visual enjoyment. The review notes that the game is relatively easy to finish but still leaves a feeling that the game was worthy of its price. A possibility to save a game state on a disk is seen as an improvement to the previous game, Barbarian, from the authors. ==References== ==External links== *Obliterator at Atari Mania *Obliterator at Lemon Amiga * Category:1988 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Amiga games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Atari ST games Category:DOS games Category:Psygnosis games Category:Run and gun games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games scored by David Whittaker Category:ZX Spectrum games ",
