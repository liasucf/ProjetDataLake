    "text": "Camill Hoffmann was a Jewish Czechoslovak diplomat and writer born in 1878. An ardent Czechoslovak nationalist, Hoffmann was appointed to the diplomatic corps as a cultural attache in Berlin. As the rising Nazi Party became increasingly belligerent, Hoffmann began using his political clout and connections to help German Jews, including Leon Trotsky's son, who he aided in escaping Berlin.Marritz, Ilya. , \u201cRadio Praha\u201d, Prague, 1 November 2006. retrieved on 10 April 2010 During 1939 he was mobilized on behalf of Max Brod, Franz Kafka's friend and literary executor. Hoffmann was asked to try to rescue Kafka's writings and personal correspondence confiscated by the Gestapo from Kafka's mistress, Dora Diamant. He was unsuccessful, however, and the materials remain lost, pursued still by the Kafka Project at San Diego State University.Diamant, Kathi (2003). Kafka's Last Love, p. 183. Basic Books, New York. His diary from his time as a diplomat, \"Politicky Denik\", translated as \"The Political Diaries of Camill Hoffmann from 1932 to 1939,\" was recently published in Czech. Hoffmann died in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944.\"German Literature.\" https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07199.html ==References== ==External links== *Kafka Project Category:Czechoslovak diplomats Category:1878 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Czech people who died in Auschwitz concentration camp Category:Czech male writers Category:Jewish writers Category:Politicians who died in Nazi concentration camps Category:Czechoslovak civilians killed in World War II Category:People from Kol\u00edn Category:Czech Jews who died in the Holocaust ",
