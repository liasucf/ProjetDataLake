Villagers are suspicious that the government will collect their information and monitor them, so they show no interest in the new ID card despite the benefits that accrue to ID cardholders. Pharsua volunteers and he becomes the first person in the village to receive the new aadhaar card and is a star. But one day, the village priest predicts that the serial number on his ID card will soon cause the death of his wife, and Pharsua starts on a journey to save his wife. Now getting his ID number changed is of utmost importance to him, but it becomes an inviolable and unchangeable absolute number since it has been entered into the system. Pharsua wails about the unfairness of his ID number, but no one outside of his village listens to his pleas. ==Cast== *Vineet Kumar Singh as Pharsua *Sanjay Mishra as Shastri *Saurabh Shukla as Parmanand Singh *Raghubir Yadav as Ghisu *Alka Amin as Rani's Mother *Ekavali Khanna as Mrs.Dahiya *Vishwanath Chatterjee as Minister *Prithvi Hatte as Rani ==Production== Ghosh, a director who has made films in Bengali cinema, said that he had several stories that will have \"no takers in Bangla cinema.\" In 2011, he read an article about the Aadhaar Card on The New York Times, which triggered the idea of the film and he wrote a synopsis. Ghosh sent the synopsis of Aadhaar to the co-production market of the Busan International Film Festival which was eventually selected in 2016. The film was shot in Jharkhand in December 2018 to January. The shooting wrapped in February 2019. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2010s Hindi-language films Category:2019 films Category:Indian comedy-drama films Category:2019 comedy-drama films Category:Indian films ",
