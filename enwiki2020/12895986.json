    "text": "The Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship (, alternatively translated as \"(Federal) Foundation for the Study of Communist Dictatorship in East Germany\") is a government-funded organisation established in 1998 by the German parliament. Its mandate is to assess the history (1949-1990) of the socialist regime of the German Democratic Republic (GDR, commonly known as East Germany), and its impact on the now reunified Germany. As its logo, the foundation uses the former East German flag minus its coat of arms. In the final months of the GDR, many East German citizens cut out the flag's emblem in this manner. The foundation also initiated a project \"Aufbruch 1989\"\"Stipendienprogramm Aufbruch 1989\" in which 17 organisations cooperated, including the Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung which is affiliated with the SED successor party, Die Linke. This was rejected by Hubertus Knabe, and after it was made public,\"Zwist unter Aufarbeitern\", Die Welt, 30 June 2007 by a public letter\"Der Verherrlichung der SED-Diktatur entgegentreten!\" (Open letter to the foundation) signed by B\u00e4rbel Bohley, Werner Schulz, Lutz Rathenow, , Ralph Giordano, Erich Loest and others, with support by Lea Rosh and Michael Wolffsohn.\"Streit unter SED-Opfern\", Focus PR-inside: SED-Opfer kritisieren Zusammenarbeit mit Luxemburg-Stiftung M\u00e4rkische Allgemeine of 6 July 2007 == References == == External links == * Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur * * \"Zwist unter den Stasi-Aufkl\u00e4rern\", Berliner Morgenpost Category:History of East Germany Category:Foundations based in Germany Category:Organisations based in Berlin Category:1998 establishments in Germany ",
