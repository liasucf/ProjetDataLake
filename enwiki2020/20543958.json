After progressing through the ranks at the youth system and reserves, B\u00fcttner made his professional debut for Vitesse on 15 March 2008 against Twente after coming on as a substitute for Haim Megrelashvili in the 6th minutes following his poor performance. However, after coming on as a substitute for Megrelashvili, he played until he received a straight red card after a second bookable offence, in a 4\u20133 loss. This turns out to be his only appearance in the 2007\u201308 season. In the 2008\u201309 season, B\u00fcttner then made his first start for the club, where he played the whole game, in a 1\u20131 draw against Sparta Rotterdam on 20 September 2008. Having established himself in the starting eleven, B\u00fcttner then scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20131 home win over Volendam on 20 December 2008. Although he appeared on the substitute bench as the season progressed, B\u00fcttner regained his first team place and went on to score two goals in two matches between 18 April 2009 and 26 April 2009 against AZ and Utrecht. At the end of the season, B\u00fcttner went on to make twenty-three appearances and scoring three times in all competitions. In the 2009\u201310 season, B\u00fcttner signed his contract and continued to be involved in the first team, competing with Jeroen Drost and Gino Felixdaal over the left-back position, although he spent time the first half of the season, coming on as a substitute.

His performance soon attracted interests clubs around Europe from Polish clubs Legia Warsaw and Lech Pozna\u0144, but the transfer move never happened and because of this, he appeared on the substitute bench since the end of January, as well as, his own injury concerns. He managed to regain his first team place after the failed transfer move and went on to make twenty-five appearances in all competitions. With his contract expiring at the end of the season, the club opened negotiations with B\u00fcttner over a new contract. Eventually, B\u00fcttner signed a contract extension, keeping him until 2011. In the 2011\u201312 season, B\u00fcttner started the season well when he set up two goals, in a 2\u20131 win over Utrecht on 20 August 2011, followed up by scoring his first goal of the season, in a 4\u20131 loss against Ajax. Three weeks later, on 17 September 2011, B\u00fcttner scored his second goal of the season, in a 5\u20130 win over Roda JC. Throughout the season, he continued to be in a regular first team, playing either left-back and left-midfielder.

Although he suffered a toe injury in the next game, B\u00fcttner returned to the next game from injury on the last game of the season, in a 3\u20131 loss against Ajax. At the end of the season, B\u00fcttner went on to make thirty- nine appearances and scoring five times in all competitions.
