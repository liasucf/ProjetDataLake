His association with DJ Quik helped him secure a record deal with Select Records, who he signed to in 1991. That same year, he released his debut album, Bitch Betta Have My Money, which featured the singles \"Jiggable Pie\", \"Bitch Betta Have my Money\", \"Vertical Joyride\" and \"I Wanna Be Yo Ho\". AMG produced almost the entire album by himself, with DJ Quik serving as an additional producer on one song. The album was a moderate success commercially, reaching No. 63 on the US Billboard 200. AMG is known for his sexually explicit lyrics, and most notably for songs like \"Bitch Betta Have My Money\" and \"Jiggable Pie\". The British electronica group Hardknox later sampled \"Bitch Betta Have My Money\" on their single, \"Who's Money?\", which was originally sampled by AMG from Big Daddy Kane's song \"Pimpin' Ain't Easy\". Ludacris also borrowed three lines of lyrics for his song \"Area Codes\". AMG appeared on porn star-turn-singer Midori's album Miss Judged in 2001. In 2007, AMG began recording an album with DJ Quik under the name \"The Fixxers\". They released a single through Interscope Records titled \"Can U Werk Wit Dat\".HHNLive.com - News - DJ Quik and AMG AKA The Fixxers Sign With Interscope The album, Midnight Life, was scheduled to be released in mid-to-late 2007 but was shelved due to material being leaked prior to its release. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\"| Release ! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=font-size:90%;\"| US |- ! scope=\"row\"| Give a Dog a Bone | rowspan=\"2\" | 1991 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Bitch Betta Have My Money | 63 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ballin' Outta Control | 1995 | 100 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Bitch Betta Have My Money 2001 | 2000 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Rum & Coke | 2008 | \u2014 |- |} ===Compilation albums=== * Greatest Humps Volume One (2002) ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:0.5em;\"| Release ! colspan=\"1\" scope=\"col\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.9em;font- size:90%;\"| US Rap |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Bitch Betta Have My Money\" | rowspan=\"2\" width=\"70px\" | 1991 | 5 | rowspan=\"4\" | Bitch Betta Have My Money |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Jiggable Pie\" | 11 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Vertical Joyride\" | rowspan=\"3\" width=\"70px\" | 1992 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"I Wanna Be a Yo Ho\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Don't Be a 304\" | \u2014 | Trespass (soundtrack) |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Butt Booty Naked\" | width=\"70px\" | 1993 | \u2014 | House Party 3 (soundtrack) |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Around the World\" | rowspan=\"2\" width=\"70px\" | 1995 | \u2014 | rowspan=\"2\" | Ballin' Outta Control |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Pimp of the Century\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Pimp's Anthem\" | width=\"70px\" | 1997 | \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Perfection\" | width=\"70px\" | 2000 | \u2014 | Bitch Betta Have My Money 2001 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"No\" | width=\"70px\" | 2003 | \u2014 | Greatest Humps Volume 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Somethin' Nasty\" | width=\"70px\" | 2004 | \u2014 | |- |} ==References== ==External links== *The Fixxers sign with Interscope Category:African-American male rappers Category:Living people Category:1970 births Category:Rappers from Los Angeles Category:Select Records artists Category:West Coast hip hop musicians Category:20th-century American rappers Category:21st-century American rappers Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American male musicians ",
