    "text": "The Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guides the Best Pop Solo Performance Award as being designed for a solo performance pop recording (vocal and instrumental) and is limited to singles or tracks only. The category was introduced in 2012 and combined the previous categories for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance and Best Pop Instrumental Performance. The restructuring of these categories was a result of the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards and to eliminate the distinctions between male and female (and in some cases, solo instrumental) performances. The award goes to the performing artist. The producer, engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners Certificatie. Adele, with three wins, is the artist with the most awards in the category. Kelly Clarkson is the artist with the most nominations at four, followed by Adele, Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift with three. ==Recipients== Adele was the first recipient of this award, and has received it three times. 2014 winner Lorde. 2020 winner Lizzo. ===2010s=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=75% |- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\" ! width=\"10%\" | Year ! width=\"45%\" | Artist ! width=\"45%\" | Work |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2012 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Adele | \"Someone Like You\" |- | Lady Gaga | \"Yo\u00fc and I\" |- | Bruno Mars | \"Grenade\" |- | Katy Perry | \"Firework\" |- | Pink | \"Fuckin' Perfect\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2013 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Adele | \"Set Fire to the Rain (Live)\" |- | Kelly Clarkson | \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" |- | Carly Rae Jepsen | \"Call Me Maybe\" |- | Katy Perry | \"Wide Awake\" |- | Rihanna | \"Where Have You Been\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2014 2015 Nominees |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Lorde | \"Royals\" |- | Sara Bareilles | \"Brave\" |- | Bruno Mars | \"When I Was Your Man\" |- | Katy Perry | \"Roar\" |- | Justin Timberlake | \"Mirrors\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2015 2014 Nominees |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Pharrell Williams | \"Happy (Live)\" |- | John Legend | \"All of Me (Live)\" |- | Sia | \"Chandelier\" |- | Sam Smith | \"Stay with Me (Darkchild Version)\" |- | Taylor Swift | \"Shake It Off\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2016 2014 Nominees |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Ed Sheeran | \"Thinking Out Loud\" |- | Kelly Clarkson | \"Heartbeat Song\" |- | Ellie Goulding | \"Love Me Like You Do\" |- | Taylor Swift | \"Blank Space\" |- | The Weeknd | \"Can't Feel My Face\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2017 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Adele | \"Hello\" |- | Beyonc\u00e9 | \"Hold Up\" |- | Justin Bieber | \"Love Yourself\" |- | Kelly Clarkson | \"Piece by Piece\" |- | Ariana Grande | \"Dangerous Woman\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2018 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Ed Sheeran | \"Shape of You\" |- | Kelly Clarkson | \"Love So Soft\" |- | Kesha | \"Praying\" |- | Lady Gaga | \"Million Reasons\" |- | Pink | \"What About Us\" |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2019 Grammy.com, 7 December 2018 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Lady Gaga | \"Joanne (Where Do You Think You're Goin'?)\" |- | Beck | \"Colors\" |- | Camila Cabello | \"Havana (Live)\" |- | Ariana Grande | \"God Is a Woman\" |- | Post Malone | \"Better Now\" |- |} ===2020s=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=75% |- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\" ! width=\"10%\" | Year ! width=\"45%\" | Artist ! width=\"45%\" | Work |- | rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text\"=align:center; | 2020 |- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Lizzo | \"Truth Hurts\" |- | Beyonc\u00e9 | \"Spirit\" |- | Billie Eilish | \"Bad Guy\" |- | Ariana Grande | \"7 Rings\" |- | Taylor Swift | \"You Need to Calm Down\" |- |} ==Artists with multiple awards== ;3 wins *Adele ;2 wins *Ed Sheeran ==Artists with multiple nominations== ;4 nominations * Kelly Clarkson ;3 nominations * Adele * Ariana Grande * Lady Gaga * Katy Perry * Taylor Swift ;2 nominations * Beyonc\u00e9 * Bruno Mars * P!nk * Ed Sheeran == See also == *Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance *Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance *Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance == References == == External links == *Official Site of the Grammy Awards Category:Awards established in 2012 Pop Solo Performance Solo Performance ",
