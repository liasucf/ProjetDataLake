    "text": "Chili John's is a restaurant located in Green Bay, Wisconsin, that opened in 1913. A second restaurant was opened in Burbank, California, in 1946; both continue to operate. Lithuanian immigrant John Isaac began serving Southwestern chili at his Green Bay bar in 1900. Thirteen years later, the chili grew so popular that he renamed the establishment Chili John's. The chili is most commonly served over spaghetti with oyster crackers and/or shredded cheese, though it can be ordered in a number of other ways as well. Son Ernie moved to Los Angeles and launched Chili John's of California in 1946, installing the U-shaped counter and, since he was an avid fisherman, painted the mountain lake mural. For the past 20 years, the Loguercio family has owned Chili John's. Owner Gene died in April 2009, and his wife Debbie has carried on with sons Anthony and Alec. Location was used in TV series I Am the Night (TV series) Episode 3, The Rookie Season 1 - Episode 3 and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. ==References== ==See also== * Cincinnati chili, similar to this restaurant's signature dish, but developed independently ==External links== *Official website - Green Bay location *Official website - Burbank location Category:Companies based in Green Bay, Wisconsin Category:Restaurants established in 1913 Category:Restaurants in Los Angeles Category:Burbank, California Category:Restaurants established in 1946 Category:1946 establishments in California Category:Streamline Moderne architecture in California Category:1913 establishments in Wisconsin ",
