    "text": "Lee\u2013Jackson\u2013King Day was a holiday celebrated in the Commonwealth of Virginia from 1984 to 2000 as a combination of Lee\u2013Jackson Day and Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Beginning in 2000 the state observed them as two distinct holidays. Robert E. Lee's birthday (January 19, 1807) has been celebrated as a Virginia holiday since 1889. In 1904, the legislature added the birthday of Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson (January 21, 1824) to the holiday, and Lee\u2013Jackson Day was born. In 1983, the United States Congress declared January 15 to be a national holiday in honor of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.. Since 1978, Virginia had celebrated King's birthday in conjunction with New Year's Day. To align with the federal holiday, the Virginia legislature combined King's celebration with the existing Lee\u2013Jackson holiday, in tribute to \"defenders of causes.\" In 2000, Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore proposed splitting Lee\u2013Jackson\u2013King Day into two separate holidays after debate arose over whether the nature of the holiday which simultaneously celebrated the lives of two Confederate generals who fought to defend slavery and a civil rights icon was incongruous. The measure was approved and Lee\u2013Jackson Day and Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrated separately, with Martin Luther King Jr. Day on the third Monday in January and Lee\u2013Jackson Day three days earlier on the preceding Friday. The Lee\u2013Jackson holiday was itself eliminated in 2020. ==See also== *Monument Avenue, a Richmond avenue with monuments to Confederate leaders and Arthur Ashe ==References== Category:January observances Category:Memorials to Martin Luther King Jr. Category:Monuments and memorials to Robert E.
