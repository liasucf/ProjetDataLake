Written by Jeunet with Guillaume Laurant, the film is a whimsical depiction of contemporary Parisian life, set in Montmartre.

The film also features an ensemble of supporting roles, including Mathieu Kassovitz, Rufus, Lorella Cravotta, Serge Merlin, Jamel Debbouze, Claire Maurier, Clotilde Mollet, Isabelle Nanty, Dominique Pinon, Artus de Penguern, Yolande Moreau, Urbain Cancelier, and Maurice B\u00e9nichou. The film was theatrically released in France on 25 April 2001 by UGC-Fox Distribution and in Germany on 16 August 2001 by Prokino Filmverleih. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for Tautou's performance, the cinematography, production design, and writing. Am\u00e9lie won Best Film at the European Film Awards; it also won four C\u00e9sar Awards, including Best Film and Best Director). It won two British Academy Film Awards, including Best Original Screenplay, and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film and Best Original Screenplay. The film was a commercial success, grossing $174.2 million worldwide against a budget of $10 million. Taking in over $33 million in a limited theatrical release, it is to date the highest-grossing French-language film released in the United States, and one of the biggest international successes for a French film. ==Plot== Am\u00e9lie works at the Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins in Montmartre. Am\u00e9lie Poulain is born in June 1974 and brought up by eccentric parents who \u2013 incorrectly believing that she has a heart defect \u2013 decide to home-school her. To cope with her loneliness, Am\u00e9lie develops an active imagination and a mischievous personality. When Am\u00e9lie is six, her mother, Amandine, is killed when a suicidal Canadian tourist jumps from the roof of Notre-Dame de Paris and lands on her. As a result, her father Rapha\u00ebl withdraws more and more from society. Am\u00e9lie leaves home at the age of 18 and becomes a waitress at the Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins in Montmartre, which is staffed and frequented by a collection of eccentrics. She is single and lets her imagination roam freely, finding contentment in simple pleasures like dipping her hand into grain sacks and cracking cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with a spoon. On 31 August 1997, startled by the news of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, Am\u00e9lie drops a plastic perfume-stopper, which dislodges a wall tile and accidentally reveals an old metal box of childhood memorabilia hidden by a boy who lived in her apartment decades earlier. Am\u00e9lie resolves to track down the boy and return the box to him. She promises herself that if it makes him happy, she will devote her life to bringing happiness to others. After asking the apartment's concierge and several old tenants about the boy's identity, Am\u00e9lie meets her reclusive neighbour, Raymond Dufayel, an artist with brittle bone disease who repaints Renoir's Luncheon of the Boating Party every year. He recalls the boy's name as \"Bretodeau\". Am\u00e9lie quickly finds the man, Dominique Bretodeau, and surreptitiously gives him the box. Moved to tears by the discovery and the memories it holds, Bretodeau resolves to reconcile with his estranged daughter and the grandson he has never met. Am\u00e9lie happily embarks on her new mission. Am\u00e9lie secretly executes complex schemes that affect the lives of those around her. She escorts a blind man to the M\u00e9tro station, giving him a rich description of the street scenes he passes. She persuades her father to follow his dream of touring the world by stealing his garden gnome and having a flight attendant friend airmail pictures of it posing with landmarks from all over the world. She starts a romance between her hypochondriacal co-worker Georgette and Joseph, one of the customers in the bar. She convinces Madeleine Wallace, the concierge of her block of flats, that the husband who abandoned her had sent her a final conciliatory love letter just before his accidental death years before. She gaslights Collignon, the nasty greengrocer. Mentally exhausted, Collignon no longer abuses his meek but good-natured assistant Lucien. A delighted Lucien takes charge at the grocery stand. Mr. Dufayel, having observed Am\u00e9lie, begins a conversation with her about his painting. Although he has copied the same painting 20 times, he has never quite captured the look of the girl drinking a glass of water. They discuss the meaning of this character, and over several conversations, Am\u00e9lie begins projecting her loneliness onto the image. Dufayel recognizes this and uses the girl in the painting to push Am\u00e9lie to examine her attraction to a quirky young man, Nino Quincampoix, who collects the discarded photographs of strangers from passport photo booths. When Am\u00e9lie bumps into Nino a second time, she realizes she is falling in love with him. He accidentally drops a photo album in the street. Am\u00e9lie retrieves it. Am\u00e9lie plays a cat-and-mouse game with Nino around Paris before returning his treasured album anonymously. After arranging a meeting at the 2 Moulins, Am\u00e9lie panics and tries to deny her identity. Her co-worker, Gina, concerned for Am\u00e9lie's well-being, screens Nino for her; Joseph's comment about this misleads Am\u00e9lie to believe she has lost Nino to Gina. It takes Dufayel's insight to give her the courage to pursue Nino, resulting in a romantic night together and the beginning of a relationship. Am\u00e9lie finally finds happiness for herself. ==Cast== * Audrey Tautou as Am\u00e9lie Poulain ** Flora Guiet as young Am\u00e9lie * Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix ** Amaury Babault as young Nino * Rufus as Rapha\u00ebl Poulain, Am\u00e9lie's father * Serge Merlin as Raymond Dufayel, \"The Glass Man\" * Lorella Cravotta as Amandine Poulain, Am\u00e9lie's mother * Clotilde Mollet as Gina, a fellow waitress * Claire Maurier as Suzanne, the owner of Caf\u00e9 des Deux Moulins * Isabelle Nanty as Georgette, the resident hypochondriac * Dominique Pinon as Joseph * Artus de Penguern as Hipolito, the writer * Yolande Moreau as Madeleine Wallace (Wells, in English subtitled version) * Urbain Cancelier as Collignon, the grocer * Jamel Debbouze as Lucien, the grocer's assistant * Maurice B\u00e9nichou as Dominique Bretodeau ** Kevin Fernandes as young Dominique * Michel Robin as Mr. Collignon * Andr\u00e9e Damant as Mrs. Collignon * Claude Perron as Eva, Nino's colleague * Armelle as Philom\u00e8ne, air hostess * Ticky Holgado as Man in a photo * Fabienne Chaudat as The woman in a coma ==Production== Au March\u00e9 de la Butte, Rue des Trois Fr\u00e8res, Paris, used as the location of Monsieur Collignon's shop In his DVD commentary, Jeunet explains that he originally wrote the role of Am\u00e9lie for the English actress Emily Watson. In that first draft, Am\u00e9lie's father was an Englishman living in London. However, Watson's French was not strong, and when she became unavailable to shoot the film, owing to a conflict with the filming of Gosford Park, Jeunet rewrote the screenplay for a French actress. Audrey Tautou was the first actress he auditioned having seen her on the poster for the 1999 film Venus Beauty Institute. The movie was filmed mainly in Paris. The Caf\u00e9 des 2 Moulins (15 Rue Lepic, Montmartre, Paris) where Am\u00e9lie works is a real place. The filmmakers made use of computer-generated imagery (including computer animation), and a digital intermediate. The studio scenes were filmed in the Coloneum Studio in Cologne (Germany). The film shares many of the themes in its plot with the second half of the 1994 film Chungking Express. ==Release== The film was released in France, Belgium, and French-speaking western Switzerland in April 2001, with subsequent screenings at various film festivals followed by releases around the world. It received limited releases in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australasia later in 2001. Cannes Film Festival selector Gilles Jacob described Am\u00e9lie as \"uninteresting\", and therefore it was not screened at the festival, although the version he viewed was an early cut without music. The absence of Am\u00e9lie at the festival caused something of a controversy because of the warm welcome by the French media and audience in contrast with the reaction of the selector. David Martin-Jones, in an article in Senses of Cinema, stated that the film \"[wears] its national [French] identity on its sleeve\" and that this attracted both audiences of mainstream movies and those of arthouse ones. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 88% approval rating based on 182 reviews, with an average rating of 8.07/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The feel-good Am\u00e9lie is a lively, fanciful charmer, showcasing Audrey Tautou as its delightful heroine.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 69 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Alan Morrison from Empire Online gave Am\u00e9lie five stars and called it \"one of the year's best, with crossover potential along the lines of Cyrano De Bergerac and Il Postino. Given its quirky heart, it might well surpass them all\". Paul Tatara of CNN praised Am\u00e9lies playful nature. In his review, he wrote, \"Its whimsical, free-ranging nature is often enchanting; the first hour, in particular, is brimming with amiable, sardonic laughs\". The film was attacked by critic Serge Kaganski of Les Inrockuptibles for an unrealistic and picturesque vision of a bygone French society with few ethnic minorities. Jeunet dismissed the criticism by pointing out that the photo collection contains pictures of people from numerous ethnic backgrounds, and that Jamel Debbouze, who plays Lucien, is of Moroccan descent. ===Awards and nominations=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Recipient ! scope=\"col\"| Result |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\"| Academy Awards | Best Foreign Language Film | Jean-Pierre Jeunet | |- | Best Original Screenplay | Guillaume Laurant and Jean-Pierre Jeunet | |- | Best Cinematography | Bruno Delbonnel | |- | Best Art Direction | Aline Bonetto and Marie-Laure Valla | |- | Best Sound | Vincent Arnardi, Guillaume Leriche, Jean Umansky | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"9\"| British Academy Film Awards | Best Film | | |- | Best Direction | Jean-Pierre Jeunet | |- | Best Actress in a Leading Role | Audrey Tautou | |- | Best Original Screenplay | Guillaume Laurant and Jean-Pierre Jeunet | |- | Best Cinematography | Bruno Delbonnel | |- | Best Production Design | Aline Bonetto | |- | Best Editing | Herv\u00e9 Schneid | |- | Best Film Music | Yann Tiersen | |- | Best Film Not in the English Language | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"12\"| C\u00e9sar Awards | Best Film | | |- | Best Director | Jean-Pierre Jeunet | |- | Best Actress | Audrey Tautou | |- |rowspan=2| Best Supporting Actor | Jamel Debbouze | |- | Rufus | |- | Best Supporting Actress | Isabelle Nanty | |- | Best Writing | Guillaume Laurant and Jean-Pierre Jeunet | |- | Best Cinematography | Bruno Delbonnel | |- | Best Production Design | Aline Bonetto | |- | Best Costume Design | Madeline Fontaine | |- | Best Editing | Herv\u00e9 Schneid | |- | Best Music | Yann Tiersen | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\"| European Film Awards | Best Film |rowspan=2| Jean- Pierre Jeunet | |- | Best Director | |- | Best Actress | Audrey Tautou | |- | Best Cinematography | Bruno Delbonnel | |- ! scope=\"row\"| French Syndicate of Cinema Critics | Best French Film | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Golden Globe Awards | Best Foreign Language Film |rowspan=2| Jean-Pierre Jeunet | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Karlovy Vary International Film Festival | Crystal Globe | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Toronto International Film Festival | People's Choice Award | | |- |} The film was selected by The New York Times as one of \"The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\". The film placed No. 2 in Empire magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\". Paste magazine ranked it second on its list of the 50 Best Movies of the Decade (2000\u20132009). In August of that same year, BBC Magazine conducted a poll on the 21st century's 100 greatest films so far, with Am\u00e9lie ranking at number 87. Entertainment Weekly named the film poster one of the best on its list of the top 25 film posters in the past 25 years. It also named Am\u00e9lie setting up a wild goose chase for her beloved Nino all through Paris as No. 9 on its list of top 25 Romantic Gestures. In 2010, an online public poll by the American Cinematographer \u2013 the house journal of the American Society of Cinematographers \u2013 named Am\u00e9lie the best shot film of the decade. Amelie is rated 37 among the 50 Greatest Romantic Comedies of All Time by RollingStone Magazine ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack to Am\u00e9lie was composed by Yann Tiersen. ==Musical adaptation== On 23 August 2013, composer Dan Messe, one of the founders and members of the band Hem, confirmed speculation that he would be writing the score for a musical adaptation of Am\u00e9lie, collaborating with Craig Lucas and Nathan Tysen. Messe also confirmed he would be composing all original music for the show and not using the Yann Tiersen score. The musical adaptation premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theater in August 2015. It opened on Broadway in March 2017 and closed in May 2017. The production started its pre-Broadway engagement at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles in December 2016, with Phillipa Soo in the title role. Jeunet distanced himself from the musical, saying he only sold the rights to raise funds for children's charity \"M\u00e9c\u00e9nat Chirurgie Cardiaque\". ==Home media== The film has no overall worldwide distributor, but Blu-ray Discs have been released in Canada and Australia. The first release occurred in Canada in September 2008 by TVA Films. This version did not contain any English subtitles and received criticisms regarding picture quality. In November 2009, an Australian release occurred. This time the version contained English subtitles and features no region coding. Momentum Pictures released a Blu-ray in the UK on 17 October 2011. The film is also available in HD on iTunes and other digital download services. ==Legacy== For the 2007 television show Pushing Daisies, a \"quirky fairy tale\", American Broadcasting Company (ABC) sought an Am\u00e9lie feel, with the same chords of \"whimsy and spirit and magic\". Pushing Daisies creator Bryan Fuller said Am\u00e9lie is his favorite film. \"All the things I love are represented in that movie\", he said. \"It's a movie that will make me cry based on kindness as opposed to sadness\". The New York Times review of Pushing Daisies reported \"the Am\u00e9lie influence on Pushing Daisies is everywhere\". A species of frog was named Cochranella amelie. The scientist who named it said: \"[T]his new species of glass frog is for Am\u00e9lie, protagonist of the extraordinary movie Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain; a film where little details play an important role in the achievement of joie de vivre; like the important role that glass frogs and all amphibians and reptiles play in the health of our planet\". The species was described in the scientific journal Zootaxa in an article entitled \"An enigmatic new species of Glassfrog (Amphibia: Anura: Centrolenidae) from the Amazonian Andean slopes of Ecuador\". ==See also== * Cinema of France * List of French language films ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:2001 films Category:French films Category:German films Category:French-language films Category:2001 romantic comedy films Category:French romantic comedy films Category:German romantic comedy films Category:BAFTA winners (films) Category:Best Film C\u00e9sar Award winners Category:Best Film Lumi\u00e8res Award winners Category:European Film Awards winners (films) Category:Crystal Globe winners Category:Films directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet Category:Films whose director won the Best Director C\u00e9sar Award Category:Films featuring a Best Actress Lumi\u00e8res Award-winning performance Category:Films scored by Yann Tiersen Category:Films set in 1973 Category:Films set in 1997 Category:Films set in France Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films shot in Paris Category:Films whose writer won the Best Original Screenplay BAFTA Award Category:Films with live action and animation Category:Independent Spirit Award for Best Foreign Film winners Category:Best Foreign Film Guldbagge Award winners Category:Magic realism films Category:Montmartre Category:Czech Lion Awards winners (films) ",
