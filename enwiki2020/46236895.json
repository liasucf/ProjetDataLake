    "text": "photo: Nathan Rocky Kristin Diable is an American musician, songwriter, and singer from New Orleans, Louisiana. ==Musical career== Diable began her musical career as a young teenager in south Louisiana playing underground clubs. She moved to New York City at the age of 18, expanding her musical palette and garnering mainstream music industry attention for the first time. Despite numerous well-received concerts and collaborations with local artists, she followed her muse back to her native Louisiana in the late-2000s. She released her first solo album titled \"Extended Play\" in 2009 via Speakeasy Records. Three years later she released an EP titled \"Kristin Diable and the City\" via Speakeasy Records, garnering critical regional acclaim. Songs from the album were featured on HBO's \"True Blood\" and \"Treme\" television series. She released her second full-length album and first national album in 2015 titled \"Create Your Own Mythology\" via Speakeasy Records/Thirty Tigers. The album was produced by Dave Cobb (Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell) and received a 4 out of 5 star review from American Songwriter Magazine. \"It\u2019s still early in 2015, but with a release this powerful, look for Kristin Diable to be one of the year\u2019s breakout artists.\" - American Songwriter. NPR premiered the album on its First Listen series. \"In the rhythm behind her and the twang of her long vowels, she's got the easy, yeah-you-right swagger of her Louisiana roots....Diable has the same grit lining her throat that Amy Winehouse had, but sings from a place of levity that Winehouse never found.\" - NPR \"Create Your Own Mythology\" garnered a loyal cult fan base and was named one of American Songwriter Magazine's top 50 Records of 2015 stating \"the organic approach is largely responsible for Diable finding her sultry voice. It helps to have written some terrific swampy yet floating melodies too. When your album kicks off with the bluesy, instantly memorable swagger of \u201cI\u2019ll Make Time For You\u201d and closes on the dark, churchy bittersweet tang of \u201cHoney, Leave The Light On,\u201d you have tapped into a muse that is diverse, distinctive and delightfully edgy.\" Tracks from the record were also included in NPR's Best Songs of 2015. Honey Leave Your Light On was featured in the episode Ke Ku 'Ana in Season 7 of Hawaii Five-0. ==Personal life== Diable lives in New Orleans, LA. When not touring with the band, she cites regular travel around the world for inspiration. ==Discography== Studio albums *Kristin Diable & The City (2013, Speakeasy Records) *Create Your Own Mythology (2016, Speakeasy/Thirty Tigers) Singles *Magnolia (2017, Speakeasy Records) *The Christmas Song (2019, Speakeasy Records) *Joy to the World (2019, Speakeasy Records) EPs *Extended Play (2009, Speakeasy Records) ==References== Category:Musicians from New Orleans Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Musicians from Baton Rouge, Louisiana ",
