    "text": "Samir Nabi (born 16 December 1996) is a footballer who plays as a Midfielder for Hereford. Born in England, he represents Pakistan internationally. == Club career == An attacking central midfielder, Nabi was the top scorer for West Bromwich Albion's under-21 side in the 2015\u201316 season, scoring 6 goals in 18 appearances. In September 2016 he joined Indian Super League club Delhi Dynamos after an 11-year stint at various junior sides of the Hawthorns; his elder brother Adil made the same move a year earlier. He learned from teammate and former France international Florent Malouda during his time in the Indian capital. Having played no part in Delhi's season, Nabi returned to England on 24 March 2017, signing with Carlisle United for the rest of the EFL League Two season. His move was delayed due to international clearance requirements. He made his professional debut in his only league appearance for the Cumbrians, a 15-minute substitute appearance in place of John O'Sullivan on 1 April in a 2\u20130 win at Yeovil Town. Manager Keith Curle rewarded him with a new one-year contract, while saying that despite Nabi's technical ability he had to improve his game when Carlisle were without the ball. The following season, after only two EFL Trophy appearances to add to his account, he was one of eight players released by Carlisle, who missed out on the play-offs. On 30 June 2018, he signed for National League South side Torquay United. He made his debut for the Gulls on 7 August as a half-time substitute for Chris Regis in a 1\u20130 home win over Bath City. On 30 October, as a late substitute, he was sent off for handball in a 2\u20132 draw at Weston-Super-Mare. Having struggled for playing time, on 22 February 2019 he was loaned to Halesowen Town of the Southern Football League for the rest of the season. On 16 January 2020 Nabi joined Kidderminster Harriers on a deal until the end of the National League North season. He knew their interim manager Jimmy Shan from the West Brom academy. On 3rd October 2020 he joined Hereford on non contract basis. . ==International career== In May 2019, Nabi and younger brother Rahis were called up for Pakistan's 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Cambodia the following month. He made his debut on 6 June in that game, as a starter in a 2\u20130 loss. == Personal life == Samir Nabi is the middle child of three British Pakistani brothers who came through the West Bromwich Albion academy, with elder brother Adil and younger brother Rahis. == Career statistics == {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Carlisle United |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"2\"|League Two |1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2017\u201318 |0||0||0||0||0||0||2Appearance in the Football League Trophy||0||2||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0!!3!!0 |} == References == ==External links== * Category:1996 births Category:English footballers Category:Pakistani footballers Category:Pakistan international footballers Category:Footballers from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Living people Category:Carlisle United F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:English people of Pakistani descent Category:Association football midfielders Category:Torquay United F.C. players Category:British sportspeople of Pakistani descent Category:National League (English football) players Category:Halesowen Town F.C. players Category:Kidderminster Harriers F.C. players ",
