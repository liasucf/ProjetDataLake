The village of Westy is a suburban area, itself unofficially a suburb of Latchford. The area features mainly inter-war council housing, however some of these homes are now privately owned. There is an apparent strong community spirit with its hub at the community centre and also a thriving community hall based within St Margaret's Community Centre on Lindley Avenue, hosting activities for all age groups. ==References== Category:Geography of Warrington ",
