    "text": "Javanais () is a type of French slang where the extra syllable is infixed inside a word after every consonant that is followed by a vowel, in order to render it incomprehensible. Some common examples are gros (, \"fat\") which becomes gravos (); bonjour (, \"hello\"'), which becomes bavonjavour (); and p\u00e9nible (, \"annoying\"), becomes pav\u00e9naviblave (). Paris () becomes Pavaravis (). Javanais is determined by the production rule: CV \u2192 CavV. There are also many variations that can be made upon the same pattern such as: CabV, CalV, CanV, etc. In French the word Javanais is also used to refer to the Javanese language. Around 1957, Boris Vian wrote a song La Java Javanaise. The lyrics are a didactical method to learn the javanais. Each verse is firstly articulated in regular French, then translated in slang. As the title suggests, the song is a Java, a Parisian dance craze. In 1962, Serge Gainsbourg wrote and sang a song called La Javanaise, a pun playing on Javanese dancing and the javanais style of speaking. The song heavily employs unaltered French words that naturally have an sequence; thus the lyrics resemble the word game of javanais. ==See also== *Louchebem \u2013 a form of French slang similar to Pig Latin, originally called Largonji *Verlan \u2013 the inversion of syllables in a French word ==References== Category:Cant languages Category:French slang Category:Language games ",
