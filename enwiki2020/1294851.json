    "text": "A millimetre of mercury is a manometric unit of pressure, formerly defined as the extra pressure generated by a column of mercury one millimetre high, and currently defined as exactly pascals. It is denoted mmHg or mm Hg. Although not an SI unit, the millimetre of mercury is still routinely used in medicine, meteorology, aviation, and many other scientific fields. One millimetre of mercury is approximately 1 Torr, which is of standard atmospheric pressure ( \u2248 ). Although the two units are not equal, the relative difference (less than ) is negligible for most practical uses. ==History and definition== Mercury manometers were the first accurate pressure gauges; they are less used today due to mercury's toxicity, the mercury column's sensitivity to temperature and local gravity, and the greater convenience of other instrumentation. They displayed the pressure difference between two fluids as a vertical difference between the mercury levels in two connected reservoirs. An actual mercury column reading may be converted to more fundamental units of pressure by multiplying the difference in height between two mercury levels by the density of mercury and the local gravitational acceleration. Because the specific weight of mercury depends on temperature and surface gravity, both of which vary with local conditions, specific standard values for these two parameters were adopted. This resulted in defining a \"millimetre of mercury\" as the pressure exerted at the base of a column of mercury 1 millimetre high with a precise density of when the acceleration due to gravity is exactly . The density chosen for this definition is the approximate density of mercury at , and is standard gravity. The use of an actual column of mercury to measure pressure normally requires correction for the density of mercury at the actual temperature and the sometimes marked variation of gravity with location, and may be further corrected to take account of the density of the measured air, water or other fluid. Each millimetre of mercury can be divided into 1000 micrometres of mercury, denoted \u03bcmHg or simply microns. ==Relation to the torr== The precision of modern transducers is often insufficient to show the difference between the torr and the millimetre of mercury. The difference between these two units is about one part in seven million or . By the same factor, a millitorr is slightly less than a micrometre of mercury. ==Use in medicine and physiology== In medicine, pressure is still generally measured in millimetres of mercury. These measurements are in general given relative to the current atmospheric pressure: for example, a blood pressure of 120 mmHg, when the current atmospheric pressure is 760 mmHg, means 880 mmHg relative to perfect vacuum. Routine pressure measurements in medicine include: * Blood pressure, measured with a sphygmomanometer * Intraocular pressure, with a tonometer * Cerebrospinal fluid pressure * Intracranial pressure * Intramuscular pressure (compartment syndrome) * Central venous pressure * Pulmonary artery catheterization * Mechanical ventilation In physiology manometric units are used to measure Starling forces. ==See also== * Bar (unit) * Inch of mercury * Inch of water * Pound per square inch * Torr ==References== Category:Units of pressure Category:Mercury (element) ",
