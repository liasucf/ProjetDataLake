    "text": "A landspout near North Platte, Nebraska on May 22, 2004. Note the characteristic smooth, tubular shape, similar to that of a waterspout. Landspout is a term created by atmospheric scientist Howard B. Bluestein in 1985 for a kind of tornado not associated with a mesocyclone. The Glossary of Meteorology defines a landspout as : \"Colloquial expression describing tornadoes occurring with a parent cloud in its growth stage and with its vorticity originating in the boundary layer. : The parent cloud does not contain a preexisting mid-level mesocyclone. The landspout was so named because it looks like \"a weak Florida Keys waterspout over land.\" ==Characteristics== Landspouts are a type of tornado that forms during the growth stage of a cumulus congestus cloud by stretching boundary layer vorticity upward and into the cumulus congestus's updraft. These generally are smaller and weaker than supercell tornadoes and do not form from a mesocyclone or pre-existing rotation in the cloud. Because of this, landspouts are rarely detected by Doppler weather radar. Landspouts share a strong resemblance and development process to that of waterspouts, usually taking the form of a translucent and highly laminar helical tube. Landspouts are considered tornadoes since a rapidly rotating column of air is in contact with both the surface and a cumuliform cloud. Not all landspouts are visible, and many are first sighted as debris swirling at the surface before eventually filling in with condensation and dust. == Life cycle == Forming in relation to miscyclones and under updrafts, a landspout generally lasts for less than 15 minutes; however, they can persist substantially longer, and produce heavy damage. They progress through recognizable stages of formation, maturation and dissipation, and tend to decay when a downdraft or significant precipitation occur nearby. They may form in lines or groups of multiple landspouts. == Damage == Landspouts are commonly weak; however, in rare occasions, a landspout can be as strong as an EF3 tornado. ==See also== * Dust devil * Fire whirl * Funnel cloud * Tornadogenesis * Vortex * Vortex engine * Waterspout * Whirlwind == References == == External links == * Advanced Spotters' Field Guide * Online Tornado FAQ Category:Severe weather and convection Category:Tornado Category:Vortices fr:Tornade#Trombes terrestres ",
