    "text": "La Union () is a province in the Philippines located in the Ilocos Region in the island of Luzon. Its capital is the city of San Fernando, which also serves as the regional center of the whole Ilocos Region. The province is bordered by Ilocos Sur to the north, Benguet to the east, Pangasinan to the south and to the west by the shores of the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea). ==History== === Formation === La Uni\u00f3n, \"The Union\" in English, was formed in 1850 when the Spanish colonial government of Governor-General Antonio Maria Blanco merged the three southern towns of Ilocos Sur province, the nine northern towns of Pangasinan, and the western towns of Benguet to the east (Eastern Pais del Igorotes in the Cordilleras). Pangasinans were the majority in the new province because most towns had been in the province of Pangasinan. On October 29, 1849, Governor General Claveria issued a promovido to fuse the Pangasinan-Ilocos-Cordillera areas into La Union. On March 2, 1850, Governor General Antonio Maria Blanco signed the Superior Decreto of La Union (34th province from Cebu-1565), with Captain Toribio Ruiz de la Escalera as the first Gobernador Military y Politico. Isabella II of Spain decreed the province's creation on April 18, 1854. In 1661, Andres Malong (Pangasinan) failed to recover La Union from the Spaniards after the Battle of Agoo. === 1896 Philippine revolution === In 1896, the people of La Union began a revolt against the Spaniards, who had called La Union \"Una Provincia Modelo\" (\"A Model Province\"), led by Manuel Tinio Y Bondoc under Emilio Aguinaldo. The Americans collaborated with the Filipinos to end the Spanish. === American colonial era === Dr. Lucino Almeida became the Presidente Provincial of the American regime, followed by the appointment of La Union's first civil governor in 1901, Don Joaquin Joaquino Ortega.La Union Profile: Gallery of Governors - Province of La Union :: Official Website === World War II === La Union had great strategic significance both for allied and Japanese forces. On December 22, 1941, the Japanese 4th Tank Regiment and the 47th Infantry Regiment under the command of Col Isamu Yanagi supported by a massive flotilla of navy ships tried to land in Agoo to make it one of three major beachheads for the Japanese Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, although weather dispersed their forces and made them deploy on a wide stretch of beach that ranged from Agoo to as far south as Damortis. These forces later met the commonwealth defence forces - consisting of the 26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine Scouts), the Philippine 21st Division, the Philippine 11th Division, and the newly formed Philippine 71st Division - in what would later be called the Battle of Rosario. On January 4, 1945, La Union was liberated by the Battle of San Fernando and Bacsil Ridge. === Martial Law === Although economically affected by the rapid peso devaluation brought about by unbridled election spending heading into the 1969 presidential elections, political life in La Union was not significantly impacted by Ferdinand Marcos\u2019 declaration of Martial Law in 1972.Turner, Mark M. (1989) Elites and Power in a Philippine Town. Under Martial Law, 1972-76. Philippine Studies 37: 283-300. The powerful family factions which had dominated La Union politics since before the American colonial era largely remained in place, although the family of Congressman Jose D. Aspiras became much more prominent after he became Marcos\u2019 Tourism Minister. The main political change was the increased power of regional and provincial offices of national agencies, whose directors were answerable directly to Marcos. This technique used by Marcos to consolidate political power did not get much resistance in the Ilocos Region, including La Union, which had strong ethnic associations with the Marcos family.Cortes, Rosario Mendoza. (1990) Pangasinan, 1901-1986: A Political, Socioeconomic and Cultural History. New Day Publishers. The Marcos administration\u2019s use of violent methods for stifling dissent thus mostly took place in other, non-Ilocano provinces, such as nearby Abra, Kalinga, and Mountain Province. But there were still La Union natives who were willing to object to the authoritarian practices and abuses of the Marcos administration, despite personal risk.Manila Today. Mula Sigwa hanggang Commune hanggang EDSA: mga kabataangmartir at bayani ng UP.2016-01-27 https://manilatoday.net/fqs- martyrs/ This included San-Fernando-raised student activists Romulo and Armando Palabay, UP Students and La Union National High School alumni who were imprisoned for their protest activities, tortured at Camp Olivas in Pampanga, and later separately killed before the end of Martial Law. The martyrdom of Romulo (age 22) and Armando (age 21) was later honored when their names were etched on the Wall of Remembrance at the Philippines\u2019 Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the heroes and martyrs who fought the authoritarian regime.Burgonio, TJ Museum puts a face on little-known martial law martyrs Philippine Daily Inquirer 2008-09-21 https://barangayrp.wordpress.com/2008/09/21/museum-puts-a-face-on-little- known-martial-law-martyrs/ Agoo, La Union native Antonio L. Mabutas had become Archbishop of Davao by the time of Martial Law, and spoke actively against the Human rights abuses of that time, particulaly the torture and killings of church workers. The pastoral letter he wrote against Martial law, \u201cReign of Terror in the Countryside,\u201d is notable for having been the first pastoral to be written against Marcos' martial law administration. === 2010s Tourism boom === From the mid-2000s to the early 2010s, an influx of entrepreneurs began putting up establishments such as boho-chic-style art hostels and third-wave coffeeshops in San Juan and Agoo. They were initially attracted to the already-established surfing scene of Barangay Urbiztondo in San Juan, but eventually envisioned business in the province as an alternative to the stresses of city-based employment. This coincided with the phase-by-phase opening of the Tarlac\u2013Pangasinan\u2013La Union Expressway (TPLEX), which made La Union more accessible to tourists from Metro Manila. Alongside the rising influence of social media outlets Twitter and Instagram, these factors led to a drastic tourism boom which made San Juan - previously been seen as just one of the Philippines' many surfing venues - a major backpacker\u2019s destination whose attractions centered on surfing and art. San Juan began to be featured prominently in independent films such as Jay Abello\u2019s 2015 film Flotsam and JP Habac\u2019s 2017 film \u201cI\u2019m Drunk, I Love You\u201d, and the province began to be referred to by the colloquial initialism \u201cElYu.\u201d ==Geography== La Union covers a total area of occupying the centralsouthern section of the Ilocos Region in Luzon. The province is bordered by Ilocos Sur to the north, Benguet to the east, Pangasinan to the south, and to the west by the South China Sea. La Union is north of Metro Manila and northwest of Baguio. The land area of the province is . Like most of the Ilocos Region, the province is squeezed in by the Cordillera mountain range to the east and the South China Sea to the west. Yet, unlike other portions of Luzon and the Philippines' two other island groupings, the Visayas and Mindanao, La Union experiences a rather arid and prolonged dry season with little precipitation to be expected between the months of November and May. ===Administrative divisions=== La Union comprises 19 municipalities and 1 component city, all of which are organized into two legislative districts. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table- layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border- collapse:collapse;\" |- !
