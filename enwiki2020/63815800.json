She grew up in Vietnam, and at the age of 10, she moved to France where she changed schools five times. Affected by this uprooting, she suffered from anorexia. After undertaking a kh\u00e2gne course at the Lyc\u00e9e F\u00e9nelon in Paris, she sat an exam for the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure. She then continued her studies in cinema and history of art at the Sorbonne, before passing the exam for entry to the film school La F\u00e9mis. At 16 years of age, she showed her work to professionals for the first time: the publishing house of Christian Bourgois. She was given good advice and set about doing more work, and at the age of 20, presented a more accomplished text to the Stock publishing house. === Literature === Her first novel, L'\u00c9veil, was published in August 2016 by Stock.

Hailed by the press and booksellers, it was nominated for the Readers' Prize of Le Livre de Poche. == Personal life == She is in a relationship with singer Marc Lavoine. == Literary works == === Novels === * L'\u00c9veil, Stock, 2016, \u2013 Prix de la Vocation * Toni, Stock, 2018, * Les Os des filles, Stock, 2019, == References == ==External links== * Category:1995 births Category:French novelists Category:Living people ",
