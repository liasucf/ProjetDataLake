    "text": "Wrapped Around Chicago - New Year's Eve at the Riviera is the second DVD release from progressive rock band Umphrey's McGee. It features excerpts from the group's New Year's Eve 2004 two-night stand at the Riviera Theater in their homebase of Chicago, Illinois. Most of the material comes from the December 31 show, some of which features a horn section on several tracks. The initial print run was recalled when Jake Cinninger discovered sound issues with the disc, and a second print run was unveiled in late 2005. The DVD includes extensive bonus features. ==Track listing== ===Disc One=== #Divisions #Great American #Sociable Jimmy #Prowler #Jimmy Stewart #Anchor Drops #2nd Self #The Crooked One #Nopener #Robot World #Partyin\u2019 Peeps ===Disc Two=== #Ophelia #Mail Package #Nopener (lounge version) #Miss Tinkles Overture #Mulche's Odyssey #Sledgehammer #Women, Wine and Song #Slacker #Bright Lights, Big City #Auld Lang Syne #Plunger #Push the Pig #Ringo #In the Kitchen ===Bonus Features=== #Bad is Bad (w/ Huey Lewis) #Nemo #Padgett\u2019s Profile #Wife Soup #Kabump ==Personnel== *Brendan Bayliss: guitar, vocals *Jake Cinninger: guitar, vocals *Joel Cummins: keyboards *Ryan Stasik: bass *Kris Myers: drums *Andy Farag: percussion Category:2005 video albums Category:2005 live albums Category:Umphrey's McGee video albums Category:Live video albums ",
