Its similarity to the flag of Romania has caused international discussion. In 2004, Chad asked the United Nations to examine the issue, however the Romanian President Ion Iliescu announced no change would occur to the flag.\"'Identical flag' causes flap in Romania\" ==Description== The flag of Chad is a vertical tricolour consisting (left to right) of a blue, a gold and a red column. These were intended to be a combination of the colours of blue, white and red as seen on the Flag of France with the Pan-African colours of green, yellow and red. Furthermore, the blue represents the sky and hope; the gold is the sun and desert, and the red signifies the bloodshed over independence. The flag was adopted by law no. 59/13 for the autonomous republic and retained on independence in 1960, and in the constitution of 1962. Despite many political upheavals within Chad since independence, the flag has not been changed. This may be because the flag is not associated with any of the main power rivals within Chad, which had no sense of national identity before independence, and little after independence.

Romania has used the flag since 1866, which appeared for the first time in its current form in Wallachia. It was officially in use from 1848 until 1948, when it was superseded by the flag of the Socialist Republic of Romania. Chad began to use its present flag in 1960, after it achieved independence from France. When Chad adopted its flag, Romania's flag was different: it used to feature an insignia in the middle of the flag on top of the tricolour; this was added after World War II during the Communist era of the second half of the 20th century. But in 1989 Romania's Communist government was overthrown and the insignia was removed, reverting Romania's flag to the prewar version which matched the one which had been adopted by Chad in the meantime. The issue of Romania and Chad sharing similar flags has concerned the Chadian government on occasion; they requested in 2004 that the United Nations should consider it an issue. In response, Romanian President Ion Iliescu said to the media, \"The tricolour belongs to us. We will not give up the tricolour.\" == Historic flags == File:Kanem flag from dulcerta 1339-pt.svg|Flag of Kanem according to Angelino Dulcert (1339) File:Bornu flag.tif|Flag of Bornu (Kanem's successor) according to Gabriel de Vallseca (1439) File:Flag of France (1794\u20131815, 1830\u20131958).svg|Flag of France and French Equatorial Africa (1900\u20131959) File:Standard of the Free French Government of Chad, 1940\u20131942.svg|Flag of the Free French government of Chad under Pierre-Olivier Lapie (1940\u20131942) File:Flag of Pierre-Olivier Lapie as Governor of Chad.svg|Lapie's personal flag (1940\u20131942) File:Standard of the French Community.svg|Standard of the French Community ==See also== * Coat of arms of Chad * Flag of Romania ==References== ==External links== * Category:Flags introduced in 1959 Flag Category:Flags of Africa Chad ",
