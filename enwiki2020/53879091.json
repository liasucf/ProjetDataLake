    "text": "Ti Amo is the sixth studio album by French band Phoenix. It was released on 9 June 2017 by Loyaut\u00e9 and Glassnote Records. Recording began in 2014 at La Ga\u00eet\u00e9 Lyrique in Paris, an arts centre that was built at the site of a theatre. The band promoted the album by releasing two singles and embarking on a world tour. \"J-Boy\" was the first single, released on 27 April 2017, and \"Ti Amo\" was the second, released on 18 May. The album received generally positive reviews from critics. It was a modest commercial success, peaking at number 17 in France and within the top 40 in Australia, Belgium, and Switzerland. ==Composition== Ti Amo has been described as featuring synth-pop and Italo disco throughout. Phoenix said in a press release that the album is about \"our European, Latin roots, a fantasized version of Italy\", and that the songs focus on \"simple, pure emotions: love, desire, lust, and innocence\". Guitarist Laurent Brancowitz commented that the album recalls \"summer and Italian discos\". Daniel Glass, head of Glassnote Records, stated: \"I think the record came out of darkness, out of concern. But what's resulted is this incredibly colorful record.\" ==Promotion== The first single, \"J-Boy\", was released on 27 April 2017, and debuted on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show. The New York Times noted the song's \"midtempo disco pulse\", and it was named \"Best New Track\" by Pitchfork. It was performed live on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on 2 May. The title track was released as the second single on 18 May 2017. It was premiered at a concert in Antwerp in April 2017, along with \"J-Boy\", \"Lovelife\" and \"Role Model\". \"Goodbye Soleil\" was released for streaming on 2 June. Phoenix toured North America from 12 May to 15 June 2017, concluding at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. They then toured Europe and Asia in support of the album until September. ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on 23 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". ===Accolades=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !
