    "text": "\"Operation Blade (Bass in the Place)\" (also titled \"Operation Blade (Bass in the Place London)\") is a happy hardcore song by Scottish electronic group Public Domain, written and produced by the group's three members: Mark Sherry, Alistair MacIsaac, and James Allan. It samples a remix of New Order's song \"Confusion\", which was featured in the 1998 superhero horror film Blade, the source of the track's title. \"Operation Blade\" is also based on the theme to the 1982 science-fiction film Blade Runner. The song was released on 20 November 2000 as Public Domain's debut single. On 26 November, it debuted at number five on the UK Singles Chart and stayed at that position for another week. Throughout December 2000 and early 2001, the track charted in at least 10 other countries, peaking within the top 10 in Australia, Austria, Germany, and Norway. It was also critically successful, with British publication NME calling it \"hardcore brilliance\". In April 2001, it was included on Public Domain's only studio album, Hard Hop Superstars. ==Critical reception== British music journalism website NME called \"Operation Blade\" a \"gleefully manic song\" and described it as \"no-frills hardcore brilliance\". Matthias V\u00f6llm of Swiss CHR radio station Radio 105 called the song \"good\" but doubted its airplay potential. ==Track listings== 12-inch maxi-CD promo (released 20 November 2000) # \"Operation Blade (Bass in the Place)\" (original mix) \u2013 8:22 # \"Operation Blade (Bass in the Place)\" (B'n'G Mix) \u2013 5:44 Maxi-CD (released 9 January 2001) # \"Operation Blade (Bass in the Place)\" (7-inch radio edit) \u2013 3:07 # \"Operation Blade (Bass in the Place)\" (original mix) \u2013 8:21 # \"Operation Blade (Bass in the Place)\" (B'n'G vs. Musico Remix) \u2013 5:43 2006 12-inch maxi-CD (released December 2005) # \"Operation Blade (Bass in the Place)\" (2006 Remix) \u2013 8:15 # \"Operation Blade (Bass in the Place)\" (2006 XXX Remix) \u2013 7:54 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (2000\u20132001) !Peak position |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia Club Chart (ARIA) |1 |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia Dance (ARIA) |1 |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |22 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (2000) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |43 |} {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (2001) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |25 |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia Club Chart (ARIA) |12 |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia Dance (ARIA) |2 |- !scope=\"row\"|Austria (\u00d63 Austria Top 40) |44 |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |82 |- !scope=\"row\"|Germany (Official German Charts) |60 |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * The story behind \"Public Domain \u2013 Operation Blade\" with Mark Sherry Muzikxpress 064 Category:2000 debut singles Category:2000 songs Category:2001 singles Category:Acid house songs Category:Happy hardcore songs Category:Trance songs Category:UK Dance Singles Chart number-one singles ",
