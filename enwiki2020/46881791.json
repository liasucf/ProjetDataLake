    "text": "The Tianzhou () is a Chinese automated cargo spacecraft developed from China's first prototype space station Tiangong-1 to resupply its future modular space station. It was first launched (Tianzhou 1) on the Long March 7 rocket from Wenchang on April 20, 2017 and demonstrated autonomous propellant transfer (space refueling). The first version of Tianzhou has a mass of 12,910 kg and can carry 6,500 kg of cargo. ==Function== Based on the Tiangong-1 space station, it is planned that the Tianzhou will function as the main automated cargo spacecraft for the Chinese space station. It will have pressurized, semi-pressurized and unpressurized cargo capabilities, and will be able to transport airtight cargo, large extravehicular payloads and experiment platforms. It was first launched on the new Long March 7 rocket from Wenchang on April 20, 2017. ==Name== The China Manned Space Engineering Office opened a consultation for the naming of the prospective cargo ship on April 25, 2011. By May 20, it had received more than 50,000 suggestions. On July 8 Yang Liwei, China's first astronaut and deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences revealed that they had a short list of ten names. On October 31, 2013, it was revealed that they spacecraft had been named Tianzhou (), a combining the Chinese names of the Tiangong () space stations and the Shenzhou () spacecraft. They also stated that they would use the two letter identification TZ. ==Missions== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |No. !rowspan=2| Spacecraft !rowspan=2| S/N !rowspan=2| Launch (UTC) !rowspan=2| Carrier Rocket !rowspan=2| Launch Pad !colspan=3| Docking !rowspan=2| Deorbit !rowspan=2| Remarks |- !Station/ Port !Docking !Undocking |- |1 |Tianzhou 1 |Unknown |20 April 2017 11:41 | nowrap | Long March 7 | nowrap| Wenchang LC-2 | Tiangong-2 Fore | April 21, 2017 | 22nd September 2017 08:15 UTC | 22nd September 2017 (deorbit burn at 10:00 UTC) |Maiden flight of the Tianzhou spacecraft.
