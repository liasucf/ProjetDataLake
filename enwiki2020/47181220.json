On the UK Singles Chart, the band has had hits such as, Luv Da Sunshine, Your Music featuring Laura Jaye, and Get It On featuring Lisa Scott-Lee, each reaching the #22, #32, and #23 spots, respectively. ==Background== The band formed after Ben Ofoedu left Phats & SmallM2 Music: Ben Has Hottest Hits This summer., 2002, Birmingham Evening Mail, Retrieved 25 August 2015 and formed a band with DJ Rods (aka Rodney Williams), who he had known since school, and Leigh Guest, a member of Double Trouble. Their first single was \"Luv Da Sunshine\", which contains interpolations of 10cc's \"Dreadlock Holiday\". It charted at #22 on the UK Singles Chart, spending just two weeks there. It charted at #32 on the UK Singles Chart, spending two weeks there. Their third single, \"Get It On\", featured Lisa Scott-Lee and was promoted with a music video that was self- funded by Intenso and Scott-Lee, and charted at #23 on the UK Singles Chart, spending three weeks on the chart, despite being B-listed at Capital. The relative failure of this record (Scott-Lee had been dropped after producing a record that had charted at #11 on the UK Singles Chart) resulted in her taking a break from music, and the record not being featured on her solo album, Never or Now. It was also performed on Top of the Pops. In addition, Intenso Project have provided a remix for Aaliyah's \"Don't Know What to Tell Ya\". ==References== Category:English house music groups ",
