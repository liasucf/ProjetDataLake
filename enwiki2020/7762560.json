    "text": "Signal edges shown in rectangular pulse amplitude modulation with polar non- return-to-zero, inverted coding waveform In electronics, a signal edge is a transition of a digital signal from low to high or from high to low: * A rising edge (or positive edge) is the low-to-high transition. * A falling edge (or negative edge) is the high-to-low transition. In the case of a pulse, which consists of two edges: * The leading edge (or front edge) is the first edge of the pulse. * The trailing edge (or back edge) is the second edge of the pulse. ==See also== *Flip-flop (electronics), an edge-triggered circuit *Rise time, for a signal transition ==References== Category:Digital electronics ",
