    "text": "Falls Music & Arts Festival (commonly known as Falls) is a multi-day music festival held annually in Lorne (Victoria), Marion Bay (Tasmania), Byron Bay (New South Wales) and Fremantle (Western Australia), Australia over the New Year's Eve and January period. The festival hosts contemporary music performances, dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other art forms. Camping is available and all locations have nearby beaches which are either walking distance or a short bus ride away. Artists playing at the festival include rock, hip hop, indie music, electronic music, blues and roots. ==History== The festival started in 1993, with a small one-day concert, held in Lorne, Victoria, Australia, and was named Rock Above The Falls. The initial event attracted nearly 11,000 people, exceeding the organisers' expectations, and the organisers negotiated the use of neighbouring land to accommodate the crowd. In 1995, the event adopted a two-day format, and in 1996 the name was changed to The Falls Music & Arts Festival. The 1999 festival was the first to be held off the Lorne site, moved temporarily to the Torquay site of the Offshore Festival due to poor weather. In 2003, two events were held simultaneously for the first time; one in Lorne, and an additional event at Marion Bay, Tasmania. The same acts played at both events; the 30 December acts who played at Lorne, play 31 December at Marion Bay, and vice versa. Both the Lorne and Marion Bay festivals have continued to run simultaneously and artists continue to be exchanged between the two locations over the course of the festival. Subsequent festivals retained this two-location format. In 2013 the Byron edition of the event was introduced, increasing the reach of the festival across the country. In 2019, the festival at the Lorne site was cancelled due to extreme bushfire risk during the 2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season. The headline acts typically perform in the evening on 30 December and 31 December. No festival is planned in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Awards== In 2008, the Falls Festival won the FasterLouder Festival Award for 'Best Lineup' and the following year the Marion Bay site received the 'Favourite Venue and Location' award.FasterLouder Festival Awards 2009 . The festival has a strong focus on sustainability, taking home the following awards over the past few years: *Winner \u2013 Excellence in Sustainability Victorian Tourism Awards 2012 *Winner \u2013 Excellence in Sustainability Victorian Tourism Awards 2013 *Winner \u2013 Excellence in Sustainability Victorian Tourism Awards 2014 (inducted into the Hall of Fame) *Outstanding in the Greener Festival Awards 2012 *Outstanding in the Greener Festival Awards 2013 *Outstanding in the Greener Festival Awards 2014 *Winner \u2013 Major Festivals & Events Tasmanian Tourism Awards 2013 *Winner \u2013 Major Festivals & Events Tasmanian Tourism Awards 2014 *Winner \u2013 Major Festival Australian Event Awards 2014 ==Awards and nominations== ===National Live Music Awards=== The National Live Music Awards (NLMAs) are a broad recognition of Australia's diverse live industry, celebrating the success of the Australian live scene.

Like many Australian festivals, the event also promotes local bands, with Victorian and Tasmanian artists also performing at their respective state's festival. Solo female performer Missy Higgins promoted the release of her album and several singles, for which she was later recognised by receiving multiple awards at the ARIA Awards in 2005. ===2004=== The 2004/05 festival was again held at both venues. Both sites sold out early \u2013 the only Falls Festival to sell as fast was the 1999 event. Artists performing at the event included: {|width=90%| |width=33%| *The Black Keys *De La Soul *Billy Bragg *The Living End *The John Butler Trio *Missy Higgins *The Thrills *Veruca Salt *Spiderbait *The Cat Empire *Xavier Rudd *Donavon Frankenreiter *You Am I |width=33%| *The Beautiful Girls *Vusi Mahlasela *Hilltop Hoods *Rocket Science *Dakota Star *Bob Brozman *Downsyde *TZU *The New Pollutants *Butterfingers *The Panics *Hayden *Sarah Blasko |width=33%| *Even *The Cops *Betchadupa *The Spazzys *The Vasco Era *Carus and The True Believers *Epicure *Mia Dyson *Ash Grunwald *The Hot Lies *Clare Bowditch and the Feeding Set *The Roys |} ===2005=== Artists who performed at the 2005 event included: {|width=90%| |width=33%| *The Dandy Warhols *Ozomatli *The Shins *Ian Brown *Wolfmother *Pete Murray *The Beautiful Girls *The Vasco Era *Faker *TZU *The Grates *Hoodoo Gurus *The Zutons |width=33%| *Sarah Blasko *End of Fashion *The White Buffalo *The Mess Hall *Evermore *Dallas Crane *Lior *Matt Walker and Ashley Davies *67 Special *Ugly Duckling *The Cat Empire *Rolling Blackouts *The Presets |width=33%| *Eric Bibb *Kelly Stoltz *Little Birdy *Ash Grunwald *Dappled Cities Fly *True Live *Offcutts *Katalyst and RuCL *Rob Sawyer *Mia Dyson *Youth Group *Dan Sultan & Scott Wilson *The Embers |} In 2005 tickets for the Marion Bay festival sold out two and a half days after going on sale on 15 August, and Lorne tickets selling out one week after coming onsale. Further allocations of tickets for both festivals were released during December and sold out within hours of coming on sale. An unlimited number of Falls Festival patrons were able to attend the 'Falls Cinema' on Thursday 29 December (one day earlier than the official kick-off) in an effort to minimize traffic congestion. In Tasmania, the number of tickets available were capped at 9000. ===2006=== In early July, a new website for the 2006 event was launched. People were able to subscribe to the official mailing list and be entered into the draw to be offered tickets ahead of the official release date of 16 August. Subscribers that were selected were notified by 30 July. Tickets for the 2006 festival were put on sale as of 9 am, 16 August. All tickets to the Lorne event were gone in about 2 hours. The Marion Bay event followed suit, with all tickets sold out within 3.5 hours. The announced performers as of 28 December, include: {|width=90%| |width=33%| *Modest Mouse *Michael Franti and Spearhead *Wolfmother *Basement Jaxx *The Bees *John Butler Trio *Saul Williams *The Black Seeds *Matt Costa *The Vasco Era *Dan Kelly and The Alpha Males *The Fumes *Dallas Frasca & Her Gentlemen |width=33%| *You Am I *The Audreys *Youth Group *Josh Pyke *Blue King Brown *Jamie Lidell *Hilltop Hoods *Eskimo Joe *Unleash the Nugget *Wolf & Cub *Dexter *Timmy Curran *Labjacd |width=33%| *Scribe *The Sleepy Jackson *The Mountain Goats *Little Birdy *The Exploders *Jen Cloher and The Endless Sea *Dan Sultan *Cansei de Ser Sexy *Ground Components *FourPlay String Quartet *Custom Kings *Muph & Plutonic *The Embers |} Restrictions on ticket sales were made in 2006 (in the form of a ballot) in an attempt to curb the increasing practice of ticket resale, commonly known as 'scalping', as well as to make the access to tickets more equitable. The changes reflected similar alterations made to ticket sale procedures of other major Australian music festivals such as Splendour in the Grass and The Big Day Out. Previously, tickets had been released for sale in bulk and with no limit on the number of tickets able to be purchased by an individual, resulting in a high incidence of individuals purchasing multiple tickets, and a subsequent sell-out of tickets within 12 \u2013 24 hours. The restrictions included a purchasing limit of four tickets per any individual, as well as the initiation of an online ticket lottery, which randomly allocated the sale of approximately 50% of all tickets to a list of people who had registered their interest on the Festival's website. Tickets were also released on multiple dates rather than in bulk, to make sales more manageable and to increase consumer accessibility to the sale of tickets. ===2007=== The artists at the festival of 2007/08 included:Falls Festival 2007-2008 Forum {|width=90%| |width=33%| *Kings of Leon *Groove Armada *Paul Kelly *Midnight Juggernauts *Black Rebel Motorcycle Club *The Waifs *Gotye *Built to Spill *Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez *The Go!

Changes included: *the extension of the ticket lottery from 50% to 80% of all tickets \u2013 intended to increase the equity of ticket sale *the centralisation of all ticket sales to the Falls Festival Website \u2013 intended to eliminate the need to line up outside stores overnight in order to purchase a ticket, as well as prevent criminal problems associated with it such as littering and drinking in public *the inclusion of a name and date of birth printed on the Festival ticket \u2013 intended to further restrict scalping practices Tickets went on sale to the general public on Monday 10 September at 9 am AEST, with the 14,500 tickets to the Lorne event selling out on the day they were released. ===2008=== {|width=90%| |width=30%| *Franz Ferdinand *The Hives *Santigold *The Kooks *Gomez *Tegan and Sara *Fleet Foxes *Donavon Frankenreiter *SoKo *Jamie Lidell *Cut Off Your Hands *Mystery Jets *Atmosphere feat.

On 6 August 2009 some of the bands scheduled to play at the 2009 Falls Festival were leaked online due to a directory being left open on the official falls festival website. The organisers subsequently decided to officially release the entire first line-up announcement ahead of the scheduled 13 August release date. On 7 October 2009 the Falls Festival announced that they would be putting on a pre-festival party, and extending the Falls Funk\u2019n\u2019Soul Revue to Lorne on 28 December. The extension of the revue made the Lorne festival a four-day event from 28 December to 1 January. The Funk\u2019n\u2019Soul Revue occurred over two days across the respective states, on the 28th in Lorne and on the 29th in Marion Bay with slightly differing lineups across the two locations. ===2010=== *Interpol *Public Enemy (Performing their album Fear of a Black Planet in full) *Joan Jett and the Black Hearts *The Jezabels *The National *The Living End *Dan Kelly (musician) *Klaxons *Angus & Julia Stone *Tame Impala *The Rapture *Ladyhawke *Cold War Kids *Sleigh Bells *Chris Baio (Vampire Weekend) *Hot Hot Heat *Paul Kelly *Boy & Bear *Children Collide *The Beautiful Girls *The John Butler Trio *The Soft Pack *Last Dinosaurs *Dan Sultan* *Sally Seltmann* *The Cool Kids *Junip *Kitty, Daisy & Lewis *Marina & The Diamonds* *The Middle East *Cloud Control *Yacht Club DJs *Washington *The Public Opinion Afro Orchestra *The Morning Benders *The Bamboos *Tijuana Cartel *A-Trak *Edan The Dee-Jay* *Ash Grunwald *Beardyman* *The Cuban Brothers* *World's End Press *Casiokids *Peaches *Daara J Family *Jamaica *Charlie Parr *Jonathan Boulet *Big Scary *Sampology *Eagle and the Worm *Jinja Safari *Tim & Jean ===2011=== *Aloe Blacc *Alpine *An Horse *Arctic Monkeys *Arj Barker *Babylon Circus *Beirut *CANT *Crystal Castles *CSS *Dan Deacon *DJ Yoda *Easy Star All-Stars *Emma Louise *Fleet Foxes *Grouplove *J Mascis *John Butler Trio *Josh Pyke *Josh Thomas *Kimbra *Lanie Lane *Metronomy *Missy Higgins *Nouvelle Vague *Papa vs Pretty *PNAU *Regurgitator (Playing Unit in full) *The Scientists of Modern Music *Scratch Perverts *The Grates *The Head and the Heart *The Jezabels *The Jim Jones Revue *The Kooks *The Naked & Famous *Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs (cancelled) *Unknown Mortal Orchestra *Young MC Marion Bay Only *The Dirty Love Lorne Only *360 *Bass Kleph *Dr Don Don *Hook N Sling *Lotek *Mic Newman & Tornado Wallace *Nina Las Vegas *Oscar & Martin *Strange Talk *The Death Set *Bleeding Knees Club *The Bombay Royale *Miles Kane *Puta Madre Brothers *Clairy Browne & The Bangin' Rackettes *Boy in a Box *Dub FX *Guineafowl *Gyuto Monks of Tibet *Kim Churchill *Lewis Floyd Henry ===2012=== *Angus Stone *Ash Grunwald *Ball Park Music *Beach House *Best Coast *Bombay Bicycle Club *Boy & Bear *Coolio *Cosmo Jarvis *Django Django *First Aid Kit *Hilltop Hoods *Hot Chip *Jinja Safari *Lisa Mitchell *Lyke Giants *Matt Corby *Max\u00efmo Park *Millions *Sampology Presents a Falls Anniversary Live AV Show *SBTRKT *Sharon Van Etten *The Flaming Lips *The Hives *The Vaccines *Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs *Two Door Cinema Club *Willis Earl Beal Lorne Only *Airwolf *Ajax *Alison Wonderland *Bleeding Knees Club *Cactus Channel *Cassian *Cub Scouts (Cub Sport) *Daniel Champagne *DZ Deathrays *Elizabeth Rose *Flume *Fraser A.
