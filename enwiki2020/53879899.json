    "text": "Behnam Malakooti , is Professor of Systems Engineering of Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), OH, USA. He has been affiliated with CWRU since 1982. He is a pioneer researcher in risk, Operations Management, Manufacturing Systems, multiple criteria optimization. He developed artificial neural networks for predicting decision-making behavior for out-of-sample data. He also pioneered the theory of multiple-objective optimization for solving decision making, operations and manufacturing systems, machinability of materials, Artificial Neural Networks, facility layout, and group technology and clustering. ==Education== Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering (1982), Purdue University MS in Industrial Engineering (1979), Purdue University MS in Economics (1978), Purdue University == Honor and awards == Malakooti has received several awards including * Fellow, Institute of Industrial & Systems Engineers (IISE); one of twelve recipients, 1997. * Fellow, Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME), one of ten international recipients, 1996 * Fellow, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), since 1998 . * Divisional Professional Leadership Award, one of three national recipients, IEEE, 2000-2001 . * Exceptional Research Achievement, Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Case Western Reserve University, 2004 . ==Selected publications== * Malakooti, B, \"Operations and production systems with multiple objectives\" John Wiley & Sons, 2013 * Malakooti, B. \"Decision Making Process: Typology, Intelligence, and Optimization\" Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing , DOI: 10.1007/s10845-010-0424-1, Volume 23, Issue 3 (2012), Page 733-746. * Brian J.
