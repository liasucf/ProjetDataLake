    "text": "The American Conservation Coalition (ACC) is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit environmental advocacy organization focusing on limited-government, conservative approaches to environmental issues. The group was founded in Appleton, Wisconsin, in 2017. == History == ACC was founded by Benji Backer in 2017 with the original goal to add conservative voices to environmental conversations. However, since its founding, ACC has evolved to advocate for legislation at the federal level and educate students on environmental issues. == Mission == ACC's stated mission is: \"The American Conservation Coalition is changing the narrative on environmental discussions through promoting a mix of free-market, pro-business, and limited-government environmentalism in legislatures, college campuses, the political arena, and beyond.\" The organization focuses on five environmental pillars: conservation, competition, clean energy, property rights, and climate change science. ACC has used several slogans including \"Changing the Narrative,\" \"Green GOP,\" \"Right on Climate,\" and \"The Right Way Forward\" throughout its operations. == Issue advocacy == ACC activates on a variety of environmental issues areas including land and wildlife conservation, developments in clean energy and emission- reducing technology like carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), and other free-market environmental policies. ACC supports the development and deployment of nuclear energy as well as renewable sources. In 2019, the ACC signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the US Environmental Protection Agency to educate and \"prepare students for careers and opportunities within today's various environmental fields.\" ACC advocates on behalf of the National Parks Service (NPS) and aims to empower local conservation leaders, rather than pushing large-scale federal action. ACC was involved in the formation of the Roosevelt Conservation Caucus, a bicameral caucus that focuses on bringing conservatives into environmental policy-making. Recently, ACC has focused on climate change. In April 2020, ACC released the American Climate Contract, a conservative response to climate change that promotes energy innovation, 21st Century infrastructure, natural solutions, and a global approach. Prominent conservative organizations, like the Young Republicans National Federation, endorsed the plan. == Political activity == In 2018, ACC endorsed a slate of Republican congressional candidates including Representatives Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Brian Mast (R-FL), and Senators Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Mitt Romney (R-UT). ACC also endorsed three gubernatorial candidates: Charlie Baker (MA), Chris Sununu (NH), and Larry Hogan (MD). In 2019, ACC and ConservAmerica worked to help form the bicameral Roosevelt Conservation Caucus. == The Conservation Coalition == Founded in 2018 as ACC Campus, The Conservation Coalition is ACC's 501(c)(3) educational program. Activists on more than 200 campuses host educational events on their respective campuses and support ACC's projects. == References == == External links == Category:Non-profit organizations based in the United States Category:Nature conservation organizations based in the United States Category:Environmental organizations established in 2017 Category:Environmental organizations based in the United States Category:Appleton, Wisconsin ",
