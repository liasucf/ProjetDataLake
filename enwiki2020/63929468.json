    "text": "Empowering Women in Organic Chemistry (EWOC) hosts an annual meeting of women (students, post-docs, faculty and professionals) who work or plan to work in the field of Organic Chemistry broadly defined, from all types of institutions (academic, industry, biotech, non-profit and government). EWOC seeks to empower all marginalized individuals by promoting equity, justice, diversity, and inclusion across all chemistry fields. The first meeting was held on June 28, 2019 at the University of Pennsylvania. The meeting consists of both science and career topics to provide support and guidance for the next generation of women chemists, as well as provide opportunities for professionals to learn up-to-date science, network and share experiences. The 2020 meeting was held virtually on Thursday, August 13 and Friday, August 14. The meeting goals are to *Establish a peer group network for collaborating and recruiting diverse talent * Afford a novel mechanism to provide advice and counsel for women organic chemists * Share stories from different perspectives about career development and challenges faced \u2013 and overcome \u2013 along the way * Establish an inclusive community, with an emphasis on Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, to engage, network and support each other in the field of Organic Chemistry * Provide support and guidance to graduate students and post-docs making career decisions * Provide community support to enhance retention of women in chemistry. == History == The number of female scientists in the organic chemistry community, industry and academics, remains low (<20%). Advancement of women in the chemical sciences is a challenge due to the so- called \u201cleaky pipeline,\u201d wherein growing numbers of women enter academics and industry to study science opt out to pursue alternative careers, some of which are congruent with science while others are outside the discipline altogether. Inspired by the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing series of Conferences to encourage women to participate in computer science, gender diversity should be a goal across our community and we should actively be looking for opportunities to recognize, identify and retain women in the field of organic chemistry regardless of gender or any other protected characteristic. To accomplish this goal a group of scientists (Lara Kallander, Donna Huryn, Ellie Cantor, Rebecca Ruck, Margaret Faul and Mary Watson) founded the Empowering Women in Organic Chemistry (EWOC) Conferences in 2019. The EWOC conference allows women leaders to present their scientific research and also allows the participants to hear career stories of how eminent women in the field of organic chemistry have developed their careers and the challenges they have faced \u2013 and overcome \u2013 along the way. The conference also includes a career panel and series of excellent workshops to provide participants the tools to navigate their careers. The conference provides a unique opportunity for networking and is committed to improving upon the overall diversity within the organic chemistry community and attempts to provide a supportive environment across many elements of diversity. === 2019 Meeting Speakers === {| class=\"wikitable\" |Name |Affiliation |Presentation Title |- |Madeleine Joulli\u00e9, PhD |Univ Pennsylvania |Women in Organic Chemistry; Past, Present and Future |- |Malika Jeffries-EL, PhD |Boston Univ |Design and Synthesis of Organic Electronic Materials |- |Geraldine Richmond, PhD |Univ Oregon |COAChing to be Leaders in Science and Innovation |- |Catherine Grimes, PhD |Univ Delaware |Breaking Down Walls to Treat Inflammation |- |Lisa Jarvis, BA |C&E; News |How to be Heard: Why Diversity in Science Journalism Matters & Practical Advice on Telling your Science Stories |- |Emma Parmee, PhD |Merck & Co. |New Directions in Chemistry at Merck: Expanding Exploration of Chemical Space |} 2019 Workshops included Cultivate Belonging in the Workplace for Yourself and Others; How to Create, Build and Leverage Networks for Sustained Leadership and Career Success and Cultural Change to Enable Diversity & Inclusion, amongst others. === 2020 Meeting Speakers === {| class=\"wikitable\" |Name |Affiliation |Presentation Title |- |Vy M.
