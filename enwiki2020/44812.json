Located in the central part of the country, it has a population of 679,941 (2019). It is the capital of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship, and is located approximately south-west of Warsaw. The city's coat of arms is an example of canting, as it depicts a boat ( in Polish), which alludes to the city's name. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was once a small settlement that first appeared in 14th- century records. Despite being granted town rights in 1423, it remained the private property of the Kuyavian bishops and clergy until the late 18th century. The Second Industrial Revolution brought rapid growth in textile manufacturing and in population due to the inflow of migrants, notably Germans and Jews. Ever since the industrialization of the area, the city has struggled with multinationalism and social inequalities, which were documented in the novel The Promised Land by Nobel Prize-winning author W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont. The contrasts greatly reflected on the architecture of the city, where luxurious mansions coexisted with redbrick factories and dilapidated tenement houses. The industrial development and demographic surge made \u0141\u00f3d\u017a one of the largest cities in Poland. Under the German occupation during World War II, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was briefly renamed to Litzmannstadt in honour of Karl Litzmann. The city's large Jewish population was forced into a walled zone known as the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto, from which they were sent to German concentration and extermination camps. The city itself sustained insignificant damage during the war and became Poland's temporary seat of power in 1945. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a experienced a sharp demographic and economic decline after 1989. It was only in the 2010s that the city began to experience revitalization of its neglected downtown area. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is ranked by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network on the \u201cSufficiency\u201d level of global influence and is internationally known for its National Film School, a cradle for the most renowned Polish actors and directors, including Andrzej Wajda and Roman Polanski. In 2017, the city was inducted into the UNESCO Creative Cities Network and named UNESCO City of Film.\"Poland\u2019s \u0141\u00f3d\u017a named UNESCO City of Film.\" Radio Poland. Retrieved 3 November 2017. ==History== Sigillum oppidi Lodzia - seal dating back to 1577 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a first appears in the written record in a 1332 document giving the village of \u0141odzia to the bishops of W\u0142oc\u0142awek. In 1423 King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o officially granted city rights to the village of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. From then until the 18th century the town remained a small settlement on a trade route between the provinces of Masovia and Silesia. In the 16th century the town had fewer than 800 inhabitants, mostly working on the surrounding grain farms. With the second partition of Poland in 1793, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a became part of the Kingdom of Prussia's province of South Prussia, and was known in German as Lodsch. In 1798 the Prussians nationalised the town, and it lost its status as a town of the bishops of Kuyavia. In 1806 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a joined the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw and in 1810 it had approximately 190 inhabitants. After the 1815 Congress of Vienna treaty it became part of the Congress Kingdom of Poland, a client state of the Russian Empire. ===Century of partitions: 1815 Congress of Vienna=== In the 1815 treaty, it was planned to renew the dilapidated town and with the 1816 decree by the Czar a number of German immigrants received territory deeds for them to clear the land and to build factories and housing. Their incentives for settlement included \"exemption from tax obligations for a period of six years, free materials to build houses, perpetual lease of land for construction, exemption from military service or duty-free transport of the immigrants\u2019 livestock.\" In 1820 Stanis\u0142aw Staszic aided in changing the small town into a modern industrial centre. The immigrants came to the Promised Land (Ziemia obiecana, the city's nickname) from all over Europe. Mostly they arrived from Saxony, Silesia and Bohemia, but also from countries as far away as Portugal, England, France and Ireland. The first cotton mill opened in 1825, and 14 years later the very first steam-powered factory in both Poland and the Russian Empire commenced operations. In 1839, over 78% of the population was German,Wies\u0142aw Pu\u015b, Stefan Pytlas. \"Industry and Trade in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and the Eastern Markets in Partitioned Poland\". In: Uwe M\u00fcller, Helga Schultz. National borders and economic disintegration in modern East Central Europe. Berlin Verlag A. Spitz. 2002. p. 69. and German schools and churches were established. A constant influx of workers, businessmen and craftsmen from all over Europe transformed \u0141\u00f3d\u017a into the main textile production centre of the mighty Russian Empire spanning from East-Central Europe all the way to Alaska. As long as the town was small, the majority of the town's population was German speaking. Three groups then dominated the city's population and contributed the most to the city's development: Germans, Poles, and Jews, who started to arrive from 1848. Many of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a craftspeople were weavers from Upper and Lower Silesia. In 1850, Russia abolished the customs barrier between Congress Poland and Russia proper and therefore industry in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a could now develop freely with a huge Russian market not far away. Eventually the city became the second-largest city of Congress Poland. In 1865 the first railroad line opened (to Koluszki, branch line of the Warsaw\u2013Vienna railway), and soon the city had rail links with Warsaw and Bia\u0142ystok. One of the most important industrialists of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was Karl Wilhelm Scheibler. In 1852 he came to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and with Julius Schwarz together started buying property and building several factories. Scheibler later bought out Schwarz's share and thus became sole owner of a large business. After he died in 1881 his widow and other members of the family decided to pay homage to his memory by erecting a chapel, intended as a mausoleum with family crypt, in the Lutheran part of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a cemetery on ulica Ogrodowa (later known as The Old Cemetery). Between 1823 and 1873, the city's population doubled every ten years. The years 1870\u20131890 marked the period of most intense industrial development in the city's modern history. Many of the industrialists were of Jewish ethnicity. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a also soon became a major centre of the socialist movement. In 1892 a huge strike paralyzed most of the factories and manufacturing plants. According to the Russian census of 1897, in which \u0141\u00f3d\u017a figured as the fifth-largest city of the Russian Empire, out of the total population of 315,000, Jews constituted 99,000 (around 31% percent).Joshua D. Zimmerman, Poles, Jews, and the Politics of Nationality, Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2004, , Google Print, p.16 During the 1905 Revolution, in what became known as the June Days or \u0141\u00f3d\u017a insurrection, Tsarist police killed hundreds of workers.Robert Bubczyk. A History of Poland in Outline. Maria Curie-Sk\u0142odowska University Press. 2002. p. 68. By 1913, the Poles constituted almost half of the population (49.7%), the German minority had fallen to 14.8%, and the Jews made up 34%, out of some 506,000 inhabitants. Despite the air of impending crisis preceding World War I, the city grew constantly until 1914. By that year it had become one of the most densely populated as well as one of the most polluted industrial cities in the world\u2014. A major battle was fought near the city in late 1914, and as a result the city came under German occupation after 6 DecemberGeoffrey Jukes, Peter Simkins, Michael Hickey, The First World War: The Eastern Front, 1914\u20131918, 2002, p. 28Alan D. Axelrod, The Complete Idiot's Guide to World War I, 2001, p. 108 but with Polish independence restored in November 1918 the local population liberated the city and disarmed the German troops. In the aftermath of World War I, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a lost approximately 40% of its inhabitants, mostly owing to draft, diseases, pollution and primarily because of the mass expulsion of the city's German population back to Germany. ===Restored Poland after the First World War=== In 1922, following the establishment of the Second Polish Republic, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a became the capital of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship, but the period of rapid growth had ceased. The Great Depression of the 1930s and the Customs war with Germany closed western markets to Polish textiles while the Bolshevik Revolution (1917) and the Civil War in Russia (1918\u20131922) put an end to the most profitable trade with the East. The city became a scene of a series of huge workers' protests and riots in the interbellum. On 13 September 1925 a new airport, Lublinek Airport, began operations on the outskirts of the city. In the interwar years \u0141\u00f3d\u017a continued to be a diverse and multicultural city, with the 1931 Polish census showing that the total population of roughly 604,000 included 375,000 (59%) Poles, 192,000 (32%) Jews and 54,000 (9%) Germans (determined from the main language used). By 1939, the Jewish minority had grown to well over 200,000.Gordon J Horwitz. Ghettostadt: \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and the Making of a Nazi City. Harvard University Press. 2009. p. 3. ===Occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany=== Holocaust victims at Radegast railway station During the invasion of Poland, the Polish forces of General Juliusz R\u00f3mmel's \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Army defended the city against initial German attacks. The Wehrmacht nevertheless captured the city on 8 September. Despite plans for the city to become a Polish enclave attached to the General Government, the Nazi hierarchy respected the wishes of many ethnically German residents and of the Reichsgau Wartheland governor Arthur Greiser by annexing the city to the Reich in November 1939. Many Germans in the city, however, refused to sign the Volksliste and become Volksdeutsche; they were deported by the General Government. The city was given the new name of \"Litzmannstadt\" after Karl Litzmann, the German general who had captured it during World War I. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto, Ghetto Litzmannstadt, was the second-largest ghetto in all of German- occupied Europe The Nazi authorities soon established the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto (Ghetto Litzmannstadt) in the city and populated it with more than 200,000 Jews from the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a area.Biuletyn Informacyjny Obchod\u00f3w 60.

Accessed 25 March 2015. As Jews were deported from Litzmannstadt for extermination, others were brought in. Several concentration camps and death camps arose in the city's vicinity for the non-Jewish inhabitants of the regions, among them the infamous Radogoszcz prison and several minor camps for the Romani people and for Polish children. Due to the value of the goods that the ghetto population produced for the German military and various civilian contractors, it was the last major ghetto to be liquidated, in August 1944. While occupied, thousands of new ethnic German Volksdeutsche came to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a from all across Europe, many of whom were repatriated from Russia during the time of Hitler's alliance with the Soviet Union before Operation Barbarossa. In January 1945, most of the German population fled the city for fear of the Soviet Red Army. The city also suffered tremendous losses due to the German policy of requisition of all factories and machines and transporting them to Germany. Thus, despite relatively small losses due to fighting and aerial bombardment, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was deprived of most of its industrial infrastructure. Prior to World War II, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a's Jewish community numbered around 233,000 and accounted for one-third of the city's total population. The community was almost entirely wiped out in the Holocaust. By the end of the war, the city and its environs had lost approximately 420,000 of its pre-war inhabitants, including approximately 300,000 Polish Jews.Weiner, Rebecca.

Izrael Pozna\u0144ski's tomb at the New Jewish Cemetery in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is one of the largest of its kind in the world On 1 August 1944 the Warsaw Uprising erupted, and the fate of the remaining inhabitants of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto was sealed. During the last phase of its existence, some 25,000 inmates were murdered at Che\u0142mno; their bodies burned immediately after death. As the front approached, German officials decided to deport the remaining Jews to Auschwitz-Birkenau aboard Holocaust trains. A handful of people were left alive in the ghetto to clean it up. Others remained in hiding with the Polish rescuers. When the Red Army entered \u0141\u00f3d\u017a on 19 January 1945, only 877 Jews were still alive, 12 of whom were children. Of the 223,000 Jews in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a before the invasion, only 10,000 survived the Holocaust in other places. The Soviet Red Army entered the city on 18 January 1945. According to Marshal Katukov, whose forces participated in the operation, the Germans retreated so suddenly that they had no time to evacuate or destroy any of the factories, as they had in other cities.Blobaum, Robert. \"On Strike on \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. \"Rewolucja: Russian Poland, 1904\u20131907\".

However the number began to grow as refugees from Warsaw and territories annexed by the Soviet Union migrated. Until 1948 the city served as a de facto capital of Poland, since events during and after the Warsaw Uprising had thoroughly destroyed Warsaw, and most of the government and country administration resided in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Some planned moving the capital there permanently; however, this idea did not gain popular support and in 1948 the reconstruction of Warsaw began. Under the Polish Communist regime many of the rich industrialist and business magnate families lost their wealth when the authorities nationalised private companies. Once again the city became a major centre of industry. A number of extensive panel block housing estates (including Retkinia, Teofil\u00f3w, Widzew, Radogoszcz and Chojny) were constructed between 1960 and 1990, covering an area of almost and accommodating a large part of the city's population. (p. 175) In mid-1981 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a became famous for its massive hunger demonstration of local mothers and their children.\"Polish Minister and Union Reach Compromise on Meat Ration Cut\", By James M. Markham, special to The New York Times: \"Three more days of limited protests are planned in Lodz, which appears to have suffered especially from meat shortages.\" In 1988 the population of the city peaked to 854,261, gradually dropping ever since. After the period of economic transition during the 1990s, most enterprises were again privatised. == Geography == === Climate === \u0141\u00f3d\u017a has a humid continental climate (Dfb in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). ===Districts=== \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was previously subdivided into five boroughs (dzielnica): Ba\u0142uty, Widzew, \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie, Polesie, G\u00f3rna.

This is because alongside the entire region of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship, (p. 7). the city is experiencing substantial population decline. (p. 21). Since the population peak of 1988, when the number of inhabitants reached 854,261, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a has lost almost 180,000 residents. Such a dramatic change results mainly from low fertility rates and low life expectancy on the one hand, and a negative migration balance on the other. A major factor behind the shrinkage of the city was the transition from socialist to market-based economy after 1989 and the resulting economic crisis, (p.14). but the economic growth following Poland's accession to the European Union in 2004 has not reversed the trend. (pp. 169\u2013170). The process of suburbanization also contributes to it, with a number of non-urban areas in counties surrounding \u0141\u00f3d\u017a steadily increasing in population. While the 'fringe area' around \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is expected to register an insignificant growth of less than 2,000 people until 2050, the population of the city proper by the middle of the 21st century is estimated to drop below the level of 500,000. The ongoing ageing and depopulation of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is a major challenge for the future development of the city, putting strain on social infrastructure and medical services. (pp. 11\u201312). \u0141\u00f3d\u017a has one of the highest feminization rates among Poland's major cities, a legacy of the city's industrial past, when the textile factories attracted large numbers of female employees. The rising age of the population, coupled with a longer life expectancy among women, further exacerbates the disproportion. == Places of interest == Sculpture of Artur Rubinstein on Piotrkowska Street in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, where Rubinstein was born and raised The most notable and recognizable landmark of the city is Piotrkowska Street, which remains the high-street and main tourist attraction in the city, runs north to south for a little over .

The best example of urban regeneration in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is the Manufaktura complex, occupying a large area of a former cotton factory dating back to the nineteenth century. (p. 103). The site, which was the heart of Izrael Pozna\u0144ski's industrial empire, now hosts a shopping mall, numerous restaurants, 4-star hotel, multiplex cinema, factory museum, bowling and fitness facilities and a science exhibition centre.

Herbst Palace, designed by Hilary Majewski, an art gallery within a historical mansion, which holds paintings from all over Europe The Jewish Cemetery at Bracka Street, one of the largest of its kind in Europe, was established in 1892. After the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in 1939, this cemetery became a part of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a's eastern territory known as the enclosed \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ghetto (Ghetto Field). Between 1940 and 1944, approximately 43,000 burials took place within the grounds of this rounded-up cemetery. In 1956, a monument by Muszko in memory of the victims of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto was erected at the cemetery. It features a smooth obelisk, a menorah, and a broken oak tree with leaves stemming from the tree (symbolizing death, especially death at a young age). the cemetery has an area of 39.6 hectare. It contains approximately 180,000 graves, approximately 65,000 labelled tombstones, ohels and mausoleums. Many of these monuments have significant architectural value; 100 of these have been declared historical monuments and have been in various stages of restoration. The mausoleum of Izrael and Eleanora Poznanski is perhaps the largest Jewish tombstone in the world and the only one decorated with mosaics. ==Economy and infrastructure== High-rise buildings in central \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Before 1990, the economy of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was heavily reliant on the textile industry, which had developed in the city in the nineteenth century owing to the abundance of rivers used to power the industry's fulling mills, bleaching plants and other machinery. (p. 10). Because of the growth in this industry, the city has sometimes been called the \"Polish Manchester\" (p. 82). and the \"lingerie capital of Poland\". As a result, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a grew from a population of 13,000 in 1840 to over 500,000 in 1913. By the time right before World War I \u0141\u00f3d\u017a had become one of the most densely populated industrial cities in the world, with 13,280 inhabitants per km2, and also one of the most polluted. The textile industry declined dramatically in 1990 and 1991, and no major textile company survives in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a today. However, countless small companies still provide a significant output of textiles, mostly for export to Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is no longer a significant industrial centre, but it has become a major hub for the business services sector in Poland owing to the availability of highly-skilled workers and active cooperation between local universities and the business sector. Izrael Pozna\u0144ski Palace The city benefits from its central location in Poland. A number of firms have located their logistics centres in the vicinity. Two motorways, A1 spanning from the north to the south of Poland, and A2 going from the east to the west, intersect northeast of the city. , the A2 is complete to Warsaw and the northern section of A1 is largely completed. With these connections, the advantages of the city's central location should increase even further. Work has also begun on upgrading the railway connection with Warsaw, which reduced the 2-hour travel time to make the journey 1.5 hours in 2009. As of 2018, travel time from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to Warsaw is around 1.2 hours with the modern Pesa SA Dart trains. Recent years have seen many foreign companies opening and establishing their offices in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. The Indian IT company Infosys has one of its centres in the city. In January 2009 Dell announced that it will shift production from its plant in Limerick, Ireland to its plant in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, largely because the labour costs in Poland are a fraction of those in Ireland. The city's investor friendly policies have attracted 980 foreign investors by January 2009. Foreign investment was one of the factors which decreased the unemployment rate in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to 6.5 percent in December 2008, from 20 percent four years earlier. ===Transport=== Major road network in the city \u0141\u00f3d\u017a tram network \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is situated near the geographical centre of Poland, only a short distance away from the motorway junction in Stryk\u00f3w where the two main north- south (A1) and east-west (A2) Polish transport corridors meet, which positions the city on two of the ten major trans-European routes: from Gda\u0144sk to \u017dilina and Brno and from Berlin to Moscow via Warsaw. p. 66. It is also part of the New Silk Road, a regular cargo rail connection with the Chinese city of Chengdu operating since 2013. (p. 142). \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is served by the national motorway network, an international airport, and long-distance and regional railways. It is at the centre of a regional and commuter rail network operating from the city's various train stations. Bus and tram services are operated by a municipal public transport company. There are of bicycle routes throughout the city.Sourced from the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a article on the Polish language Wikipedia page on 19 July 2015 Major roads include: * A1: Gda\u0144sk \u2013 Toru\u0144 \u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 Cz\u0119stochowa \u2013 Cieszyn (national border) * A2: \u015awiecko (national border) \u2013 Pozna\u0144 \u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 Warszawa * S8: Wroc\u0142aw \u2013 Sieradz \u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski \u2013 Warszawa \u2013 Bia\u0142ystok * S14: Pabianice \u2013 Konstantyn\u00f3w \u0141\u00f3dzki \u2013 Aleksandr\u00f3w \u0141\u00f3dzki \u2013 Zgierz * DK14: \u0141owicz \u2013 Stryk\u00f3w \u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 Zdu\u0144ska Wola \u2013 Sieradz \u2013 Z\u0142oczew \u2013 Walichnowy * DK72: Konin \u2013 Turek \u2013 Podd\u0119bice \u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 Brzeziny \u2013 Rawa Mazowiecka * DK91: Gda\u0144sk \u2013 Tczew \u2013 Toru\u0144 \u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski \u2013 Radomsko \u2013 Cz\u0119stochowa ====Airport==== The city has an international airport: \u0141\u00f3d\u017a W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont Airport located from the city centre. Flights connect the city with destinations in Europe including Turkey. In 2014 the airport handled 253,772 passengers.Wi\u015bniewski, p. 79. It is the 8th largest airport in Poland.Statistic taken from the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont Airport Wikipedia article on 19 July 2015. ====Public Transport==== Piotrkowska Centrum tram station, also known as \"The Unicorn Stable\" The Municipal Transport Company \u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Miejskie Przedsi\u0119biorstwo Komunikacyjne \u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a), owned by the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a City Government, is responsible for operating 58 bus routes and 19 tram lines.Sourced from the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a article on the Polish Wikipedia site on 19 July 2015 ====Rail==== \u0141\u00f3d\u017a has a number of long distance and local railway stations. There are two main stations in the city, but with no direct rail connection between them\u2014a legacy of 19th-century railway network planning. Originally constructed in 1866, the centrally-located \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna was a terminus station for a branch line of the Warsaw-Vienna railway,Grzegorczyk, p. 144. whereas \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Kaliska was built more than thirty years later on the central section of the Warsaw-Kalisz railway. For this reason most intercity train traffic goes to this day through \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Kaliska station, despite its relative distance from the city centre, and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna serves mainly as a terminal station for trains to Warsaw. The situation will be remedied in 2021 after the construction of a tunnel connecting the two, which is likely to make \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Poland's main railway hub. The tunnel will additionally serve \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Commuter Railway, providing a rapid transit system for the city, dubbed the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Metro by the media and local authorities. Two new stations are to be constructed on the underground line, one serving the needs of the Manufaktura complex and the other located in the area of Piotrkowska Street. In December 2016, a few years after the demolition of the old building of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna station, a new underground station was opened. It is considered to be the largest and most modern of all train stations in Poland and is designed to handle increased traffic after the construction of the tunnel. It also serves as a multimodal transport hub, featuring an underground intercity bus station, and is integrated with a new transport interchange serving taxis and local trams and buses. (p. 308) The construction of the new \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna station was part of a broader project of urban renewal known as Nowe Centrum \u0141odzi (New Centre of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a). The third- largest train station in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Widzew. There are also many other stations and train stops in the city, many of which were upgraded as part of the \u0141\u00f3dzka Kolej Aglomeracyjna commuter rail project. The rail service, founded as part of a major regional rail upgrade and owned by \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship, operates on routes to Kutno, Sieradz, Skierniewice, \u0141owicz, and on selected days to Warsaw, with plans for further expansion after the construction of the tunnel. ==Education== \u0141\u00f3d\u017a University of Technology rector's office (formerly Reinhold Richter Villa, 1904) \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is a thriving center of academic life. Currently \u0141\u00f3d\u017a hosts three major state-owned universities, six higher education establishments operating for more than a half of the century, and a number of smaller schools of higher education. The tertiary institutions with the most students in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a include: *University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (U\u0141 - Uniwersytet \u0141\u00f3dzki) *Lodz University of Technology (P\u0141 - Politechnika \u0141\u00f3dzka) *Medical University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Uniwersytet Medyczny w \u0141odzi) *National Film School in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Pa\u0144stwowa Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Filmowa, Telewizyjna i Teatralna w \u0141odzi) *Academy of Music in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Akademia Muzyczna im.

Strzemi\u0144skiego w \u0141odzi) In the 2018 general ranking of state-owned tertiary education institutions in Poland, the University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a came 20th (6th place among universities) and Lodz University of Technology 12th (6th place among technical universities). The Medical University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was ranked 5th among Polish medical universities. Leading courses taught in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a include administration (U\u0141 - 3rd place), law (U\u0141 - 4th place) and biology (U\u0141 - 4th place).Perspektywy University Ranking 2018. Retrieved 7 July 2018. There is also a number of private-owned institutions of higher learning in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. The largest of these are the University of Social Sciences (Spo\u0142eczna Akademia Nauk) and the University of Humanities and Economics in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Akademia Humanistyczno-Ekonomiczna w \u0141odzi). In the 2018 ranking of private universities in Poland the former was ranked 9th, and the latter 23rd. ===National Film School in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a=== National Film School at Oskar Kon Palace Leon Schiller National Higher School of Film, Television and Theatre in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (Pa\u0144stwowa Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Filmowa, Telewizyjna i Teatralna im. Leona Schillera w \u0141odzi) is the most notable academy for future actors, directors, photographers, camera operators and TV staff in Poland. It was founded on 8 March 1948 and was initially planned to be moved to Warsaw as soon as the city was rebuilt following the Warsaw Uprising. However, in the end the school remained in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and today is one of the best-known institutions of higher education in the city. At the end of the Second World War \u0141\u00f3d\u017a remained the only large Polish city besides Krak\u00f3w which war had not destroyed. The creation of the National Film School gave \u0141\u00f3d\u017a a role of greater importance from a cultural viewpoint, which before the war had belonged exclusively to Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w. Early students of the School include the directors Andrzej Munk, Andrzej Wajda, Kazimierz Karabasz (one of the founders of the so-called Black Series of Polish Documentary) and Janusz Morgenstern, who at the end of the 1950s became famous as one of the founders of the Polish Film School of Cinematography. == Culture == Museum of Art in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, the city's primary cultural institution ===Museums in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a=== * Archaeological and Ethnographical Museum * Book Art Museum * Central Museum of Textiles * City of Lodz History Museum * Film Museum * Herbst Palace Museum * Muzeum Sztuki (Museum of Art) * Natural History Museum, University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a * Muzeum Tradycji Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bciowych (Independence Traditions Museum) with three parts: ** Radegast train station ** Mausoleum and museum in Radogoszcz \u2013 Radogoszcz prison ** exhibition Ku\u017ania Rom\u00f3w (Roma forge) in former \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto * Se-ma-for museum of stop-motion film animation * The Centre for Science and Technology EC1 in former \u0141\u00f3d\u017a power plant ===\u0141\u00f3d\u017a in literature and cinema=== The contrast between the living conditions in industrial \u0141\u00f3d\u017a were often mentioned in arts and literature. A notable example is The Promised Land, a novel by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont Three major novels depict the development of industrial \u0141\u00f3d\u017a: W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont's The Promised Land (1898), Joseph Roth's Hotel Savoy (1924) and Israel Joshua Singer's The Brothers Ashkenazi (1937). Roth's novel depicts the city on the eve of a workers' riot in 1919. Reymont's novel was made into a film by Andrzej Wajda in 1975. In the 1990 film Europa Europa, Solomon Perel's family flees pre-World War II Berlin and settles in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Scenes of David Lynch's 2006 film Inland Empire were shot in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski's film Ida was partially shot in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Sections of Harry Turtledove's Worldwar alternate history series take place in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, and, in John Birmingham's Axis of Time alternate history trilogy, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a gains the unfortunate historical notoriety of becoming the first city to be destroyed by an Atomic Bomb when the USSR destroys the city on 5 June 1944. === Sport === Atlas Arena in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a The city has experience as a host for international sporting events such as the 2009 EuroBasket,2009 EuroBasket, ARCHIVE.FIBA.com, Retrieved 5 June 2016. and it will be one of the six host cities of the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup, with the opening and final to take place at Stadion Widzewa. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a will also host the sixth edition of the European Universities Games in 2022. Under communism it was common for clubs to participate in many different sports for all ages and sexes. Many of these traditional clubs still survive today. Originally they were owned directly by a public body, but now they are independently operated by clubs or private companies. However they get public support through the cheap rent of land and other subsidies from the city. Some of their sections have gone professional and separated from the clubs as private companies. For example, Budowlani S.A is a private company that owns the only professional rugby team in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, while Klub Sportowy Budowlani remains a community amateur club. * Budowlani \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 rugby (six times Polish champions), hockey, wrestling, volleyball * \u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 association football (two times Polish champions), basketball (Polish champions 1953), volleyball (two times Polish champions), handball, boxing * SMS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 association football, volleyball, basketball * KS Spo\u0142em \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 road and track cycling * SKS Start \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 football, swimming * Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013 association football (four time Polish champions, semi-finalists of the 1982\u201383 European Cup) In Ekstraklasa of Polish beach soccer \u0141\u00f3d\u017a have three professional clubs: Grembach, KP and . ===Horticultural Expo 2024=== \u0141\u00f3d\u017a will host the Horticultural Expo in 2024. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a bid for the Specialized Expo 2022/2023 but lost out to Buenos Aires, Argentina. ==International relations== \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is home to nine foreign consulates, all of which are Honorary.
