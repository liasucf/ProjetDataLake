Bullock's sister, Mia Henderson, was murdered in Baltimore for being transgender on July 16, 2014. A suspect was arrested in August 2015. In August 2016, Bullock said of his sister, \"She lived as herself, she taught me how to be (myself). She taught me how to take care of the family... She was happy with being who she was. She wasn't worried about how others felt about her. A person that can isolate the whole world out and not care about other people's feelings is a strong person, to me. That was one of the biggest things that I got from her.\" Bullock remains engaged in LGBT rights, volunteering to train gay and transgender youth alongside Jason Collins, a basketball player who came out as gay in a 2013 edition of Sports Illustrated. Bullock has also taken part with his young son Treyson in the New York City LGBT Pride March as part of the LGBT NBA float. He was honored during the GLAAD Media Awards, and is active in the charity \"NBA Voices for LGBT Youth and Allies\". He also appears in documentary from Vice Sports where he talks about his sister and his engagement towards the gay community in her memory. He is also involved in anti-bullying campaigns. On October 29, 2019, Keiosha Moore, Bullock's other sister, was murdered in Baltimore. ==References== ==External links== * North Carolina Tar Heels bio Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:African-American basketball players Category:American men's basketball players Category:Bakersfield Jam players Category:Basketball players from North Carolina Category:Detroit Pistons players Category:Grand Rapids Drive players Category:Los Angeles Clippers draft picks Category:Los Angeles Clippers players Category:Los Angeles Lakers players Category:McDonald's High School All-Americans Category:New York Knicks players Category:North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball players Category:Parade High School All-Americans (boys' basketball) Category:People from Kinston, North Carolina Category:Phoenix Suns players Category:Small forwards Category:Sportspeople from Baltimore ",
