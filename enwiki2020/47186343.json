WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. ISSN 1368-485X ==Design and development== The AE50R is based on the MidWest AE50. Diamond Aircraft Industries purchased the design from Mid-West Engines Limited on 10 March 2003 and took over as the type certificate holder. Diamond formed its subsidiary, Austro Engine, to produce the engine. The engine is a single rotor four- stroke, air and liquid-cooled, gasoline Wankel engine design, with a mechanical gearbox reduction drive employing a helical gear set with a reduction ratio of 3.225:1. Cooling is predominantly liquid, with forced air cooling for the rotor core. A starter and generator are standard equipment. It employs dual capacitor discharge ignition with variable ignition timing and produces at 7750 rpm. The engine was originally type certified by Mid-West on 18 Dec 1992 to JAR-22 H, Change 4, dated 13 September 1982, incl. Orange Paper 22/90/1. It was transferred to an EASA Type Certificate under EASA Part 22 Subpart H on 4 April 2011. ==Variants== ;AE50R :Base version, certified 18 December 1992 ;AE50RA :Version equipped with a conventional dual ignition system and a carburettor, with differing engine attachment point geometry, certified 26 September 2001 ;AE50RAB :Version equipped with a conventional dual ignition system and a carburettor, with differing engine attachment point geometry, certified 26 September 2001 ;IAE50R-AA :Version equipped with electronic dual ignition system and fuel injection system, with differing engine attachment point geometry, with a narrower width of , certified 26 September 2001 ==Applications== *Schiebel Camcopter S-100 *Schleicher ASG 32 *Schleicher ASH 30 *Schleicher ASH 31 ==Specifications (AE50R) == ==See also== ==References== ==External links== * Category:Austro Engine aircraft engines Category:Aircraft Wankel engines ",
