    "text": "The Pacific Trade and Development Conference (PAFTAD) is an informal private academic conference series that, since its origins in 1968, has developed into a driving force behind the development of thought on Pacific trade and development issues and important economic policy questions facing the region. The ideas and discussions generated by PAFTAD have helped drive and shape other Pacific economic cooperation organisations, including Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC). Each PAFTAD conference is organised around a particular theme, and research papers addressing the topic are presented and discussed. The results are published in the PAFTAD volume series. ==History== Since its inception in 1968 the PAFTAD conference series has established itself as one of the leading sources of ideas and discussion on issues affecting economic development in the Asia Pacific. A private organisation with no formal government ties, PAFTAD has been, and continues to be a driving force for ideas about policy innovation and development at both the national and regional levels. The essence of PAFTAD\u2019s contribution is both intellectual and practical: it generates ideas about regional economic exchange and integration, provides empirical evidence to support or reject policy proposals and facilitates ongoing debate among policy influential experts. The ideas and evidence generated by PAFTAD have entered the public policy dialogue of most Asia Pacific economies, due in no small part to the intellectual and policy leadership shown by PAFTAD participants at both a national and regional level. ==34th PAFTAD Conference - Beijing 2009== Theme: \u201cChina\u2019s Role in the World Economy\u201d Host: China Centre for Economic Research (CCER), Peking University ==Fellowship for Young Scholars== Young Fellows at PAFTAD 32 in Vietnam. The PAFTAD Fellowship for Young Scholars is available to graduate students and faculty members aged 35 years and below, and is considered one of the most distinguished fellowships available to young scholars in the region. The PAFTAD International Steering Committee selects 8 aspiring researchers as PAFTAD Fellows to present papers on themes related to Asia Pacific trade and economic development for each conference. Selection is based on the quality of a written submission as judged by the Selection Panel from PAFTAD\u2019s distinguished International Steering Committee. This year the Fellowships will take young scholars to Beijing where they will present their papers the day prior to PAFTAD's 34th Conference on December 6 and participate in the PAFTAD Conference itself on 7\u20139 December. ==International Steering Committee Members== Wendy Dobson (University of Toronto), Chair Narongchai Akrasanee (Saranee Holdings), Member Wook Chae (KIEP), Member Edward Chen (University of Hong Kong), Member Pang Eng Fong (Singapore Management University), Member Ross Garnaut (The Australian National University), Member David Hong (TIER), Member Akira Kohsaka (Osaka University), Member Justin Lin (World Bank), Member Mahani Zainal Abidin (ISIS), Member Juan J.

The extent of PAFTAD\u2019s contribution to regional development was apparent in the formation of APEC. Two of PAFTAD\u2019s earliest leaders, Professor Sir John Crawford and Dr Saburo Okita, were instrumental in leading their countries to establish the tripartite Pacific Economic Cooperation Committee (PECC). In turn PECC, which shares many members in common with PAFTAD, developed recognition among nations of the region of the need for a framework to support and enhance the rapid growth in regional trade, investment and technology transfer: APEC.
