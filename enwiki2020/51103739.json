    "text": "Progress MS-06 (), identified by NASA as Progress 67P, was a Progress spacecraft used by Roscosmos to resupply the International Space Station (ISS). As of 2014, the launch of Progress MS-06 was planned for 22 February 2017. == History == The Progress-MS is a uncrewed freighter based on the Progress-M featuring improved avionics. This improved variant first launched on 21 December 2015. It had the following improvements: * New external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites. Each compartment can hold up to four launch containers. First time installed on Progress MS-03. * Enhanced redundancy thanks to the addition of a backup system of electrical motors for the docking and sealing mechanism. * Improved Micrometeoroid (MMOD) protection with additional panels in the cargo compartment. * Luch Russian relay satellites link capabilities enable telemetry and control even when not in direct view of ground radio stations. * GNSS autonomous navigation enables real time determination of the status vector and orbital parameters dispensing with the need of ground station orbit determination. * Real time relative navigation thanks to direct radio data exchange capabilities with the space station. * New digital radio that enables enhanced TV camera view for the docking operations. * The Ukrainian Chezara Kvant-V on board radio system and antenna/feeder system has been replaced with a Unified Command Telemetry System (UCTS). * Replacement of the Kurs A with Kurs NA digital system. ==Launch== Progress MS-06 launched on 14 June 2017 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, at 09:20:13 UTC. It used a Soyuz-2.1a rocket to get to orbit, replacing the former Soyuz-U launch system. ==Docking== Progress MS-06 docked with the Zvezda. It was planned to dock with the Pirs module which it would remove from the space station, in preparation for the arrival of the Nauka module. However, due to the repetitive delays with the Nauka module the plan was postponed to Progress MS-09. After a two-day rendezvous, Progress MS-06 docked to the station on 16 June 2017 at 11:37 UTC. == Cargo == The Progress MS-06 spacecraft delivered 2,398 kg of cargo and supplies to the International Space Station for the six-person crew. The following is a breakdown of cargo bound for the ISS: * Fuel: 620 kg * Oxygen and Air: 47 kg * Water: 420 kg ==Orbit== On 27 August 2017, Progress MS-06's engines were used for a 177-second burn to raise the ISS by around 0.97 km (average orbital altitude). ==Undocking and decay== Progress MS-06 undocked on 28 December 2017 and re-entered the atmosphere at 04:43 UTC. Its debris entered the Pacific Ocean at 04:51:34 UTC. == Launch fire == The strap-on boosters ignited dry grass on impact 600 kilometers downrange from the Baikonur Cosmodrome causing a fire 15km across. NPO Mashinostroyeniya employed workers to clear debris. One worker was killed and another hospitalized by the fires. ==References== Category:Progress (spacecraft) missions Category:Spacecraft launched in 2017 Category:2017 in Russia Category:Supply vehicles for the International Space Station Category:Spacecraft launched by Soyuz-2 rockets Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2017 ",
