    "text": "The nine bestowments () were awards given by Chinese emperors to officials, ostensibly to reward them for their accomplishments. While the nature of the bestowments was probably established during the Zhou Dynasty, there was no record of anyone receiving them until Wang Mang. Thereafter, the nine bestowments became typically a sign of a powerful official showing off his complete control of the emperor and establishing his intent to usurp the throne. For the rest of Chinese history, it became rare for an usurpation to happen without the nine bestowments having been given sometime before, and just as rare for the nine bestowments to be given without an usurpation happening, however, an example of the latter was Cao Pi giving Sun Quan the nine bestowments in 221 when Sun was briefly a Cao Wei vassal. Conversely, officials who made important contributions and were offered the nine bestowments would decline them to show their loyalty and lack of intent to usurp the throne. ==The nine bestowments== The nine bestowments according to the Classic of Rites, and their meanings, explained in the Han dynasty commentary Bai Hu Tong:\u300a\u767d\u864e\u901a\u5fb7\u8ad6 \u00b7 \u5377\u4e94 \u00b7 \u8003\u9edc\u300b\uff1a\u201c\u79ae\u8a18\u4e5d\u932b\uff1a\u8eca\u99ac\u3001\u8863\u670d\u3001\u6a02\u3001\u6731\u6236\u3001\u7d0d\u965b\u3001\u864e\u8cc1\u3001\u9207\u925e\u3001\u5f13\u77e2\u3001\u79ec\u9b2f\uff0c\u7686\u96a8\u5176\u5fb7\u53ef\u884c\u800c\u8cdc\u8eca\u99ac\uff0c\u80fd\u5b89\u6c11\u8005\u8cdc\u8863\u670d\uff0c\u80fd\u4f7f\u6c11\u548c\u6a02\u8005\u8cdc\u4ee5\u6a02\uff0c\u6c11\u773e\u591a\u8005\u8cdc\u4ee5\u6731\u6236\uff0c\u80fd\u9032\u5584\u8005\u8cdc\u4ee5\u7d0d\u965b\uff0c\u80fd\u9000\u60e1\u8005\u8cdc\u864e\u8cc1\uff0c\u80fd\u8a85\u6709\u7f6a\u8005\u8cdc\u4ee5\u9207\u925e\uff0c\u80fd\u5f81\u4e0d\u7fa9\u8005\u8cdc\u4ee5\u5f13\u77e2\uff0c\u5b5d\u9053\u5099\u8005\u8cdc\u4ee5\u79ec\u9b2f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5148\u5f8c\u8207\u65bd\u884c\u4e4b\u6b21\uff0c\u81ea\u4e0d\u76f8\u903e\uff0c\u76f8\u70ba\u672c\u672b\u3002\u7136\u5b89\u6c11\u7136\u5f8c\u5bcc\u8cb4\u800c\u5f8c\u6a02\uff0c\u6a02\u800c\u5f8c\u773e\u4e43\u591a\u8ce2\uff0c\u8ce2\u4e43\u80fd\u9032\u5584\uff0c\u9032\u5584\u4e43\u80fd\u9000\u60e1\uff0c\u9000\u60e1\u4e43\u80fd\u65b7\u5211\u3002\u5167\u80fd\u6b63\u5df2\uff0c\u5916\u80fd\u6b63\u4eba\uff0c\u5167\u5916\u884c\u5099\uff0c\u5b5d\u9053\u4e43\u751f\u3002\u201d # Gift of a wagon and horses: when the official is appropriate in his modesty and walking in an appropriate manner, so that he does not need to walk any more. # Gift of clothes: when the official writes well and appropriately, to show his good deeds. # Gift of armed guards: when the official is brave and willing to speak the truth, so that he can be protected. # Gift of written music: when the official has love in his heart, so that he can teach the music to his people. # Gift of a ramp: when the official is appropriate in his acts, so that he can walk on the ramp and maintain his strength. # Gift of a red door: when the official maintains his household well, so that his household can be shown to be different. # Gift of arms, bow, and arrows: when the official has good conscience and follows what is right, so that he can represent the central government to stamp out treason. # Gift of an axe: when the official is strong, wise, and loyal to the imperial household, so that he can execute the wicked. # Gift of wine: when the official is filially pious, so that he can sacrifice the wine to his ancestors. ==Pronunciation == The reason why the character \u932b (usually pronounced x\u012b in modern Mandarin and meaning \"tin\") is used, rather than the expected \u8cdc (c\u00ec, meaning \"bestowment\"), is that \u932b was used as a jiajie (\u5047\u501f, 'rebus') character for \"bestowment\", interchangeably with \u8cdc during the times when the ceremonies were first established in the Classic of Rites. Thus, the semantically correct modern reading should be ji\u01d4 c\u00ec and not ji\u01d4 x\u012b.For several examples of the usage of \u932b to mean \"bestowment\" in the received classics, see the Shujing, \"Hong Fan\" chapter (dating from the late Spring and Autumn or early Warring States period): e.g., \u4e43\u932b\u79b9\u6d2a\u7bc4\u4e5d\u7587 and \u6c5d\u5247\u932b\u4e4b\u798f. For this particular meaning, the authoritative Wang Li Character Dictionary of Ancient Chinese (p. 1533) and Dictionary of Commonly Used Characters in Ancient Chinese (p. 369) both give the modern reading c\u00ec, with the former giving the fanqie reading \u65af\u7fa9\u5207 (quoting the Jiyun), indicating that an alternative reading for \u932b already existed by the Song dynasty. However, dictionaries of modern Chinese like the Xinhua Dictionary (p. 530, \u9521/\u932b) only give the definition \"tin\" and the reading x\u012b and do not give this alternative reading or the definition of \"bestowment\". == List of recipients of the Nine Bestowments == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
