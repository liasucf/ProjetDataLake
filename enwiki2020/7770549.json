    "text": "\"Ms Grace\" was a popular single by The Tymes. Written by John Hall and Johanna Hall and produced by Billy Jackson and Mike Chapman, \"Ms Grace\" was their sole number one in the UK Singles Chart, spending a single week at the top of the chart in January 1975. It fared less well in the US where it peaked at No. 91 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and No. 75 on the Hot Soul Singles chart. In spite of its low US peak, it was a local hit within Carolina Beach Music, where it became a standard. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1974/75) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) |align=\"center\"|59 |- |United Kingdom (Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|1 |- |United States (Billboard Hot 100) |align=\"center\"|91 |} ==References== Category:1974 singles Category:The Tymes songs Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles Category:1974 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Mike Chapman ",
