    "text": "Gregor Dorfmeister (March 7, 1929 \u2013 February 4, 2018) was a German journalist and writer. Under the pseudonym Manfred Gregor, Dorfmeister published three novels. His debut novel, Die Br\u00fccke (\"The Bridge\"), was turned into a Golden Globe Award-winning film of the same name. The second, Das Urteil (The Verdict), is best known in the United States where it was made into the movie Town Without Pity starring Kirk Douglas and featuring an Academy Award- nominated song of the same name performed by Gene Pitney. ==Life== Born in Tailfingen, today part of Albstadt, Gregor Dorfmeister grew up in Bad T\u00f6lz, where he attended high school. In the spring of 1945 at age 16, he was a member of the People's Army in his home region and participated in defending two bridges against advancing American tanks. Seeing one of the tank-crew members wounded was \"terrible. ... That's when I became a pacifist\". Seven of eight of his young fellow German fighters were also killed in the day's battles before the town fell.Selby, Scott Andrew, The Axmann Conspiracy: The Nazi Plan for a Fourth Reich and How the U.S. Army Defeated It, Berkley (Penguin), Sept. 2012, ; via Google Books.

From 1948 he studied drama, journalism and philosophy at the University of Munich. During this period he completed an internship at a Munich newspaper.

Dorfmeister released three novels under the name Manfred Gregor: *In his highly autobiographical first novel Die Br\u00fccke (1958), The Bridge, he describes the senseless Volkssturm use of a group of seven sixteen- year-olds at the end of the Second World War against the advancing Americans to defend a bridge. Six of the boys in the novel are killed, only one survives. The book was domestically in Germany, and internationally, a great success and the film of the same name by Bernhard Wicki (1959) is a classic anti-war film, Die Br\u00fccke.Kelley, Bill III, \"Discover \u201cThe Bridge\u201d \u2013 one of Germany\u2019s finest post-WWII antiwar films\", hamptonroads.com, June 2015. Review of The Bridge: The Criterion Collection; \"Best extra: 20 minute interview with author Gregor Dorfmeister\". In 2007 ProSieben produced a television adaptation directed by Wolfgang Panzer with Franka Potente in the role of the teacher Elfie Bauer. *Dorfmeister's second novel, Das Urteil (1960), The verdict, is about a rape case against a soldier of the American occupation troops in a southern German town. The book was made into a film by Gottfried Reinhardt called Town Without Pity. The movie included an Academy Award-nominated song of the same name with music by Dimitri Tiomkin, lyrics by Ned Washington and performed by Gene Pitney. The Pitney version was also featured in the 1988 John Waters movie Hairspray. *In his third novel, Die Stra\u00dfe (1961), The Road or The Street, Dorfmeister describes a group of young people whose inner emptiness and aimlessness can lead to a slide into crime. ==Works== * Die Br\u00fccke.
