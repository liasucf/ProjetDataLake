    "text": "St. Therese Church, west of Beattyville, Kentucky, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. It is a wood frame church on a concrete block foundation. It was built in 1948 from materials of the Contrary Creek Settlement School Church, a previous church located about a mile away, which had been built in the 1920s. The new church was built to a different design. Kitchen and living quarters for Catholic nuns and for the circuit-riding priest were added. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1948 Category:Roman Catholic churches in Kentucky Category:Lee County, Kentucky ",
