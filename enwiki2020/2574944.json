    "text": "The Swallow Doretti is a two-seater British sports car built on Swallow's own design of box-section tube chassis using Triumph TR2 mechanicals, made between 1954 and 1955. It was intended for the U.S. market and to be a more refined two-seater than available there at that time. ==Swallow== The car was built by the Tube Investments Group subsidiary, Swallow Coachbuilding Company (1935) Ltd, bought for its 1935 to 1946 association with Jaguar's prewar motorcycle sidecars. Sometimes known for its similarity to the Ferrari 166MM 'Barchetta' and Austin-Healey 100. ===Doretti=== The Doretti name was derived from Dorothy Deen, who managed the Western US distributorship Cal Sales. The Trade Mark logo and Doretti name is in the ownership of Canadian Peter Sch\u00f6mer. He is building a new limited edition sports car called the Doretti TR250 'Corsa Veloce' using the Ferrari TR 250 chassis and engine from 1957. https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003020634 ===Design=== Based on the Triumph TR2 it had much improved stability, its track was wider and its wheelbase longer. The Doretti had a tubular Reynolds 531 manganese\u2013molybdenum, medium-carbon steel chassis. Reynolds was another member of the T I Group. The double-skinned body had an inner structural skin made of steel and an aluminium outer skin. Most cars were supplied with Laycock-de Normanville electric epicyclic overdrive and they were capable of 100 mph. 276 Mk I cars were made, including a single fixed head coupe version.Mike Lawrence, A to Z of Sports Cars, 1945-1990 Bay View Books, Bideford, Devon : 1996 The car was designed by in-house engineer Frank Rainbow, and produced in the TI factory at The Airport, Walsall, Staffordshire, England. Three prototype Mk II cars, the Sabre were produced. These had a stiffer chassis and better weight distribution. The only car that the TI Group ever built under the Swallow name its production stopped in 1955 when the parent company TI Group changed policy. Allegedly, pressure from the British motor industry, most notably Jaguar, led to the cessation of production of the Doretti. It is thought that the directors of TI were pressured in that the production of the Doretti sports car placed TI at an advantage over their customers buying raw materials, creating a conflict of interest. ===Performance=== A car with overdrive tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1954 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 12.3 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost \u00a31,158 including taxes. The standard version without overdrive cost \u00a31,102. At the time a Triumph TR2 cost \u00a3887. {| |Doretti badge |Interior |} ==See also== * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom ==References== ==External links== * doretti.com * Swallow Doretti pages * Swallow Doretti info Category:Sports cars Category:Cars introduced in 1954 Category:Convertibles Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles ",
