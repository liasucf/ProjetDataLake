    "text": "Black Bob was the name of a fictional Border Collie from Selkirk in the Scottish Borders; his 'owner' was Andrew Glenn, a bearded shepherd. Black Bob originally appeared as a text story in The Dandy in issue 280, dated 25 November 1944; in that story, Black Bob follows his owner's nephew who is playing truant and tries to bring him back to school. The characters were created by John Hunter (1903-1984), originally from Hawick, who worked as a journalist in Dundee, and then came to stay in Selkirk, living in a house in Elm Row, and owning a china and gift shop in Market Place. He wrote the original stories, which were then illustrated by DC Thomson's staff artist, Jack Prout. Amongst other things, John was an Elder in the Church of Scotland, and a member of Selkirk Camera Club. As drawn by Jack Prout, further Black Bob stories appeared as a picture strip in The Weekly News in 1946, continuing until 1967, and regularly in The Dandy from his 1944 debut until issue 2122, dated 24 July 1982. Eight Black Bob books were published at infrequent intervals in 1950, 1951, 1953, 1955, 1957, 1959, 1961 and 1965. The books\u2019 stories are in two formats: (1) Sizeable bodies of text, dispersed throughout with large illustrations and (2) Illustrated panels, each with a paragraph of text below them . A typical large single Jack Prout drawing, as used to illustrate a text-based story.frameless The educational and highly descriptive stories were written for the mid-twentieth-century child, but are sophisticated enough to engage an adult reader. They convey a clear separation of \u2018right\u2019 from \u2018wrong\u2019, instilling in the young reader, the values of honesty and benevolence. Bob can't understand words but can understand \u2018tone of voice\u2019 and he is not infallible, occasionally but understandably, acting on wrong information. Most stories take place in the valley and hills around Selkirk with others set further afield in Britain and some abroad, accentuating the concept of \u2018Home\u2019, and it is safely back home where most stories end - often by a cosy fireside. Recurring elements: circuses, children's parties, cliffs and crags, blindness, shady rogues, loss and reunion. Selfless devotion and heroism, usually not witnessed but always eventually recognised. _Books\u2019 Contents_ _1950_ The bravery of Bob. The mad bad dog of Tinker's Hill.

A 'The Very Best of Black Bob' was published in 2010, and he re- appeared in the 2013 Dandy Annual drawn by Steve Bright in Prout's style. Jack Prout was born on 14 December 1900 and joined the Scottish publishing firm of D. C. Thomson as a staff artist on 21 June 1937. He retired on 30 June 1968 although his strips were reprinted in the Dandy until 1982. Shortly before his retirement, Prout acquired a black and white Border Collie. Staff at D. C. Thomson's presented the artist with a spoof \"dog licence\", allowing the animal to keep the artist as a pet. The document was \"signed\" with Black Bob's pawprint. Jack Prout died on 27 September 1978. Black Bob was parodied in a strip in Viz comic entitled \"Black Bag, the Faithful Border Bin Liner\". ==Sources== Information provided by the publisher of The Dandy and the Black Bob books, namely D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd as relayed by Jason Swemmer, Pretoria, South Africa. Further biographical information provided by the Juvenile Publications department of D C Thomson in a letter to Bob Richardson, Northolt, London, England. The information about John Hunter, as the creator and original writer of the Black Bob stories, is provided by 'The Friends of John Hunter & Black Bob', a group of people centred on Selkirk, Scottish Borders. It was common knowledge in Selkirk at the time that John Hunter was the creator and original writer of the stories; the 'Friends' have interviewed people still living who knew him, and/or the family of those who have since died, to record their memories. Some of those still living who knew John Hunter include a former employee of the local newspaper, who knew that then editor Walter Thomson, and John Hunter, contributed freelance copy to DC Thomson; a man whose great aunt worked in John Hunter's shop, and reported complaints that John spent 'far too much time' in the back room, writing the stories, rather than helping out in the shop; and an employee of the bank branch where John Hunter regularly paid in cheques received for his work for DC Thomson. ==External links== *Friends of John Hunter & Black Bob *Family history for Jack Prout Category:1946 establishments in Scotland Category:Comics about dogs Category:Comics characters introduced in 1946 Category:Dandy strips Category:Fictional dogs Category:1946 comics debuts Category:1982 comics endings Category:Scottish comics characters Category:Comics set in Scotland Category:Male characters in comics ",
