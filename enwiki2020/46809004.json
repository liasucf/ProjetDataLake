    "text": "St Hild's Church of England School (formerly Henry Smith School) is a mixed secondary school located in the West View area of Hartlepool, County Durham, England. The school is named after Saint Hild of Whitby, the founding abbess of the monastery at Whitby. St Hild's Church of England School was established in September 2001 replacing Henry Smith School on the same site with the same pupils. The school relocated to a new building on the same road a few years later. Today it is a voluntary aided school administered by Hartlepool Borough Council and the Church of England Diocese of Durham. St Hild's Church of England School mainly admits pupils from Barnard Grove Primary School, Clavering Primary School, St Helen's Primary School, Throston Primary School and West View Primary School. The school offers GCSEs as programmes of study for pupils, and also has a specialism in engineering. ==References== ==External links== *St Hild's Church of England School official website Category:Secondary schools in the Borough of Hartlepool Category:Voluntary aided schools in England Category:Church of England secondary schools in the Diocese of Durham ",
