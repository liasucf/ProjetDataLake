    "text": "Ahi Pepe MothNet (styled Ahi Pepe | MothNet) is a citizen science initiative based in Otago, New Zealand that aims to raise the awareness of moths among teachers and students. == Name == Ahi Pepe (M\u0101ori for moth fire) refers a traditional proverb (whakatauk\u012b) of Te Whiti o Rongomai about firelight attracting moths (pepe) instead of muttonbirds (t\u012bt\u012b). == Activities == Ahi Pepe began in 2015 as a project with four Otago schools, and continued with funding from Participatory Science Platform, Unlocking Curious Minds, and the Biological Heritage National Science Challenge. Collaborators include Otago Museum, Orokonui Ecosanctuary, the University of Otago, Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu, Landcare Research and schools across the South Island. In October 2016, Ahi Pepe worked with Orokonui Ecosanctuary to install moth traps inside and outside the predator-proof fence, and school children worked alongside entomologists to identify the moths caught. The project has produced educational resources for schools in both English and Te Reo M\u0101ori. The South Island guide is the first educational resource to be written in the K\u0101i Tahu dialect. In 2017, public donations enabled a delegation of Otago schoolchildren to give a presentation on Ahi Pepe at the World Indigenous Peoples Conference on Education in Toronto. == Publications == 2015 \u2013 Beginner\u2019s Guide to the Otago Macro Moths 2016 \u2013 Puka Whakam\u0101rama o Te Pepe Nui - Beginners' Guide to the Macro Moths (South Island): eight booklets each covering a bioregion either in K\u0101i Tahu or English. 2017 \u2013 Puka Whakam\u0101rama o Te Pepe Nui - Beginners' Guide to the Macro Moths (North Island): eight booklets each covering a bioregion either in standard Te Reo M\u0101ori or English. All publications are produced in English and Te Reo M\u0101ori editions. == External links == * Ahi Pepe | Mothnet website * Ahi Pepe Facebook page == References == Category:Citizen science Category:Otago ",
