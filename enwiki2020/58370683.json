He was suffect consul in the year 115, replacing the consul Marcus Pedo Vergilianus killed by an earthquake in Antioch.Alison E. Cooley, The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 468 Hadrianus was descended from a wealthy Syrian family; G\u00e9za Alf\u00f6ldy has identified two of his relatives active in that province, one the patron of Heliopolis (modern Baalbek), the other a prominent citizen of Beirut.Alf\u00f6ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 319 He is known to have had at least one son, Titus Statilius Maximus, consul in 144.Alf\u00f6ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 323 Only a few steps in his cursus honorum are known. Ronald Syme states that he is \"probably\" the Statilius Severus, a military tribune assigned to an unknown legion, to whom Trajan addressed a rescript concerning a soldier's testament.Syme, \"Governors of Pannonia Inferior\", Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Alte Geschichte, 14 (1965), p. 348 The other appointment Hadrianus is known to have received was governor of Thracia; he is mentioned as the governor succeeding Publius Juventius Celsus on a military diploma dated 19 July 114.Evgeni I.
