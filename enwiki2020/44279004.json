Penguin Modern Classics, Penguin Books, 2013, p. xi ==Plot== The novel is divided into five parts. It chronicles the experiences of a Chinese widower, Ma Zeren (simplified Chinese: \u9a6c\u5219\u4ec1; traditional Chinese\uff1a\u99ac\u5247\u4ec1), usually referred to in the text as Mr Ma, and his son Ma Wei (simplified Chinese: \u9a6c\u5a01; traditional Chinese: \u99ac\u5a01), as they journey to London to take over an antique shop left by Mr Ma's deceased brother, located near St Paul's Cathedral. They are recommended as lodgers to an English landlady, Mrs Wedderburn, by Mr Ma's English clergyman, Reverend Ely. In the course of the novel, Mr Ma and his son face anti-Chinese racism of all kinds, while Mr Ma falls in love with Mrs Wedderburn and Ma Wei falls for Mrs Wedderburn's daughter, Mary. The novel is an acerbic satire revealing both the West's prejudice against the Chinese and China's \"failure to stand up for itself in the world\", according to academic Julia Lovell.Lao She, Mr Ma and Son. translated by William Dolby and introduced by Julia Lovell.
