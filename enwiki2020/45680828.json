There is a blotch of silvery scales at the base of the cell, with a line of the same colour along the middle of cell, through, the cell-spot, and broadening beyond it. There is also a silvery submarginal line, incurved at the middle, then parallel to the hindmargin. The marginal line is silvery and the fringe and costal edge before the apex are fulvous. The submarginal line is edged internally with olive fulvous. The hindwings have a short silvery line from the inner margin at two- thirds and the marginal line is silvery below the middle.
