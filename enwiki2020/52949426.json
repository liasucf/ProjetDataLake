    "text": "A leadership election for Christian and Democratic Union \u2013 Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-\u010cSL) was held on 20 November 2010. Pavel B\u011blobr\u00e1dek was elected leader of the party. ==Background== The election was held as a result of party's defeat in the 2010 legislative elections, in which the KDU-\u010cSL received less than 5% of the vote and failed to pass the electoral threshold. Then-leader Cyril Svoboda resigned and the party was temporarily headed by Michaela \u0160ojdrov\u00e1 until the leadership election was held. \u0160ojdrov\u00e1 originally did not plan to participate in the election, but later changed her mind and announced her candidature on 10 November 2010. Pavel B\u011blobr\u00e1dek became his main rival. Other candidates were Jaroslav Orel and Ji\u0159ina \u0160toura\u010dov\u00e1; Ji\u0159\u00ed Carbol also ran, but withdrew before voting began. A total of 459 delegates were allowed to vote. ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right ! Candidate !!
