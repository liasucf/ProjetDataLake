    "text": "Amnesia is a 2014 novel by Australian author Peter Carey. ==Plot summary== The novel follows the story of journalist Felix Moore who is writing an investigative piece about Gaby Baillieux, a young Australian computer hacker. Baillieux has written a computer virus which is originally intended to open the doors of Australian prison cells, but which also finds its way to the US. The novel makes connections between various incidents in Australia's past (the 1942 Battle of Brisbane and the 1975 sacking of the Whitlam government) to build a picture of conspiracy and political interference. ==Reviews== * Andrew Motion in The Guardian\"Amnesia by Peter Carey review \u2013 turbo-charged, hyperenergetic\" by Andrew Motion, The Guardian, 30 October 2014 * Ron Charles in The Washington Post\"Book review: \u2018Amnesia,\u2019 Peter Carey\u2019s novel about cybercrime\" by Ron Charles, The Washington Post ==Awards== * 2015 shortlisted for the Indie Awards - Fiction * 2013 longlisted for the ALS Gold Medal * 2014 shortlisted for the Australian Book Industry Awards (ABIA) \u2014 Australian Literary Fiction Book of the Year ==References== Category:2014 Australian novels Category:Novels by Peter Carey ",
