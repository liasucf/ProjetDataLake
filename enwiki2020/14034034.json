It was founded in 1996 by the Italian journalist and politician Giuliano Ferrara after he left as editor of the magazine Panorama. Since 2015, it has been directed by Claudio Cerasa. == History and profile == Il Foglio was founded in 1996 by the Italian journalist and politician Giuliano Ferrara after he left as editor of the magazine Panorama. The paper is headquartered in Rome. The main editorial policy of Il Foglio (meaning in Italian \"The Sheet\", i.e. formed from a single sheet of paper as used in 19th-century newspapers) is a summary of the most important news of the day with comment and analysis on them. Recently, the size of the paper has increased, with insert and extra pages incorporated especially on Saturday. == Politics == Anglo-American conservatism can roughly be considered its closest political position. It features editorials inspired by American newspapers, especially The Wall Street Journal. Il Foglio can also be considered pro-free market in economics. Despite its conservative leaning, a significant part of its journalists are members or were members of the Radical Party. This newspaper also hosts several articles from left-leaning and independent columnists. == Ownership == Since 2016, the paper has been owned by Sorgente Group, a group operating in the field of real estate investments and finance and chaired by Valter Mainetti. In April 2016 it announced that it had bought 97,48% of the ownership.http://www.ilfoglio.it/articoli/2016/04/26/il-gruppo-sorgente-sale- al-97-per-cento-del-foglio-esce-la-sator___1-v-141209-rubriche_c253.htm In December 2016, Sorgente group bought 100% of the ownership and is thus the only owner of the newspaper.
