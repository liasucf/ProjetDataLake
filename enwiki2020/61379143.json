Kirkus Reviews called it \"strong on seedy backgrounds, credible legwork, and terse violence.\" The New Yorker wrote that \"the pace . . . approaches the speed of light, and Mr. Petievich's way with the slimiest of slimy people in the seediest of seedy settings is fully up to standard.\" ==Influence== The Routledge Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English co-credited The Quality of the Informant with helping to popularize the phrase hang paper, which describes the passing of counterfeit money. == References == Category:1985 American novels Category:American crime novels Category:English-language novels ",
