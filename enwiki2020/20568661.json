Teams that competed in the 2009 Claxton Shield were the New South Wales Patriots, Queensland Rams, Perth Heat, Victoria Aces and the South Australia.

Although the average maximum temperature is 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F), most games were above this, with Game 8 of the showcase round between South Australia and Victoria Aces hitting 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) during the match. On 7 December, the temperature dropped to a maximum of 22 \u00b0C with a strong breeze over Blacktown as well as clouds, however, no rain fell and the games finished as scheduled. A large low-pressure system and long periods of rain forced the postponement of both games on 12 December in Altona, Victoria and Canberra. Games the next day were rescheduled to allow for 7-inning double headers. Game 1 between Queensland Rams and Victoria Aces was relocated to Mildura, Victoria where Game 2 and 3 were also being played. On 3 January, the New South Wales Patriots vs Queensland Rams second game at Baxter Field, Lismore was delayed during the 6th inning due to a small stint of heavy rain. Drizzle was present throughout the game, but was only delayed for approximately ten minutes.Queensland vs New South Wales 3 January 2008 ==Fielders Choice Player of the Series== This is awarded recognition of outstanding individual performances each round of the 2009 Claxton Shield by the Australian Baseball Federation.FIELDERS CHOICE Player of the Round *Round 1 - Nick Kimpton *Round 2 - Daniel Berg *Round 3 - Tim Kennelly *Round 4 - Luke Hughes *Round 5 - Wayne Lundgren *Round 6 - Justin Huber ==Statistics leaders== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+ Defensive Stats* |- !
