Android, the flagship software of the alliance (first developed by Google in 2007), is based on an open-source license and has competed against mobile platforms from Apple (iOS), Microsoft (Windows Phone), Nokia (Symbian), HP (formerly Palm), Samsung Electronics / Intel (Tizen, bada), and BlackBerry (BlackBerry OS). As part of its efforts to promote a unified Android platform, OHA members are contractually forbidden from producing devices that are based on competing forks of Android. ==Products== Android Operating System At the same time as the announcement of the formation of the Open Handset Alliance on November 5, 2007, the OHA also unveiled Android, an open-source mobile phone platform based on the Linux kernel.
