    "text": "Gregory Owen Zaun (; born April 14, 1971) is an American baseball analyst, public speaker and a retired professional baseball catcher. He played for nine teams over sixteen seasons in Major League Baseball from 1995 until 2010, winning a World Series Championship in 1997. From 2006 to 2017, he served as an on-air personality with Sportsnet in Canada. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Zaun, the nephew of former MLB catcher Rick Dempsey, was a high school teammate of Mark Loretta. Zaun and Loretta attended Saint Francis High School in La Ca\u00f1ada, California and graduated in 1989. Zaun was recruited to play college baseball at USC, UCLA, Loyola Marymount and Oklahoma, but signed a letter of intent to play for Texas. However, he chose not to play for Texas upon learning that they had signed a junior college All-American catcher. Zaun also played for the United States national baseball team at the 1989 World Junior Baseball Championship in Canada. ===Professional career=== Drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 17th round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft, Zaun reached the majors with the Orioles in June 1995. Used primarily as a back-up early in his career, he was traded to the Florida Marlins in 1996. After winning a World Series with the Marlins in 1997, he moved to the Texas Rangers prior to the 1999 season. He has also played with the Kansas City Royals, Houston Astros, and Colorado Rockies. He signed as a free agent with the Blue Jays prior to the 2004 season. In 2004, the Blue Jays were the first team to make Zaun, at 33, a starting catcher. Valuable in the line-up as a switch-hitter, he set a career high in 2005 with 133 games. ====2006\u20132011==== Prior to the 2006 season, the Blue Jays signed Bengie Molina as the everyday catcher, making Zaun the backup. Zaun started 2006 on the disabled list, with Jason Phillips serving as Molina's backup during the first week of the year. Zaun hit a game-winning two-run homer off the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' Jason Childers in his return on April 8. Molina's struggles against right-handed pitchers caused John Gibbons to platoon the two, with Molina generally starting against left-handed pitchers and Zaun playing against righties. On September 13, 2006, he hit home runs from both sides of the plate in the same game. He was only the 4th Blue Jay in history to do this. Because the Toronto Blue Jays actively pursued Rod Barajas of the Texas Rangers as the club's new starting catcher during the 2006 offseason, it was assumed that Zaun would be exploring free agency as signing Barajas would mean Zaun would be maintained as a backup. Meanwhile, negotiations between Zaun and the club deteriorated, as Zaun claimed that the Jays offered \"slightly better than back-up money for playing every day\".TheStar.com \u2013 Page Not Found Negotiations with Barajas went as far as an offer conditional on a routine physical, but eventually fell apart for undisclosed reasons. After turning down a reported $6.5 million two-year offer from the Blue Jays a week earlier,TheStar.com \u2013 Page Not Found Zaun officially accepted a two-year, $7.25 million contract offer to return to the Toronto Blue Jays as their starting catcher on November 28, 2006. The new contract deal also included a third-year option, guaranteed based on appearances.TheStar.com \u2013 Page Not Found The signing came after Zaun was rumored to have been courted by the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees, both in backup roles. Arguably his most famous play with the Jays was hitting a game-winning grand slam in the bottom of the 13th inning off of Tampa Bay Rays closer Troy Percival, on September 6, 2008 with two outs in the inning, wiping out the Rays, 7\u20134. Zaun hit only the second game-winning grand slam in Jays history but it was the first that occurred in extra innings, and even more spectacular was that his team was losing at the time, due to an RBI single by Dioner Navarro to put the Rays up, 4\u20133, before the slam at the top of the 13th. On January 22, 2009, Zaun signed a one-year deal with the Baltimore Orioles.Orioles sign Gregg Zaun Zaun was claimed off waivers by the Tampa Bay Rays GM Andrew Friedman in exchange for Rhyne Hughes on August 7, 2009. On August 16, Zaun hit a pinch hit grand slam home run against his old team the Blue Jays in the 8th inning off Brandon League on a 3\u20132 fastball. On November 12, 2009, Zaun was granted Free Agency. On December 4, 2009, Zaun signed a one-year contract with the Milwaukee Brewers for $1.9 million. After suffering a severe injury, Zaun's 2010 season\u2014and, as it turned out, his MLB career, ended on May 20. After the season, Milwaukee declined his contract option, and he became a free agent on November 2. In January, Zaun signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres, with an invitation to spring training.http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/jan/18/padres-agree-terms- five-arbitration-eligible-playe/ However, noting that he still had not recovered from his previous injury enough to play regularly, he chose to retire on March 7, 2011.Veteran catcher Zaun opts for retirement ===Mitchell Report=== In 2007, Zaun was included in the Mitchell Report following a 20-month investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs by former Senator George Mitchell. In the report, Kirk Radomski claimed he sold Deca- Durabolin and Winstrol to Zaun in 2001, after a referral from Jason Grimsley. Radomski produced a cheque from Zaun for $500. Mitchell also explained that former Montreal Expos bullpen catcher Luis Perez claimed to have supplied Zaun with steroids in 2002. Zaun declined to be interviewed for the report.Mitchell, pp. 179\u201381 On February 15, 2008, Zaun responded in detail to the allegations made in the report after issuing a denial as soon as it came out. Zaun vehemently denied taking performance-enhancing drugs, stating that he owed Grimsley $500 and that Grimsley re-wrote the cheque to purchase drugs for himself. Zaun explained, \"I can say, with 100% certainty, that the cheque was not to buy performance enhancing drugs. It's obvious to me what parts of the cheque are my writing\". ===Broadcasting career=== Zaun (right) with fellow announcer Jamie Campbell in 2011. Zaun started his broadcasting career after the Blue Jays closed out their 2006 season. Throughout the playoffs, Zaun would offer his thoughts on how the teams and players were doing, and how he thought they could improve. After his retirement, on March 14, 2011, Zaun signed a two-year contract with Rogers Sportsnet to become their studio MLB analyst.Zaun Catches On With Sportsnet He also served as a part-time analyst on Sportsnet Radio Fan 590 and the Blue Jays Radio Network. As part of his duties he blogged on his website 'zauntourage.com' (now defunct). On May 10\u201311, 2011 Zaun filled in as the color commentator on the NESN broadcast of a Red Sox series against the Blue Jays when the normal broadcaster, Jerry Remy was ill. On November 30, 2017, Rogers Communications announced Zaun's employment had been terminated after an investigation into complaints of improper conduct from several female employees. Zaun issued an apology in response to the allegations on December 4. ==Post-baseball activities== Since getting fired from Sportsnet, Zaun still resides in the Toronto area with his family. He keeps a low profile, doing podcasts and blogs and conducting youth- baseball clinics in the area. He is training as a boxer and has participated in one charity boxing match. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball players named in the Mitchell Report ==References== ==External links== *Official Gregg Zaun Site *Gregg Zaun's blog page on Sportsnet.ca Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Baltimore Orioles players Category:Baseball players from California Category:Bluefield Orioles players Category:Bowie Baysox players Category:Colorado Rockies players Category:Dunedin Blue Jays players Category:Florida Marlins players Category:Frederick Keys players Category:Gulf Coast Royals players Category:Houston Astros players Category:Kane County Cougars players Category:Kansas City Royals players Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:New Hampshire Fisher Cats players Category:Omaha Golden Spikes players Category:Rochester Red Wings players Category:Sportspeople from Baltimore Category:Sportspeople from Glendale, California Category:Syracuse Chiefs players Category:Syracuse SkyChiefs players Category:Tampa Bay Rays players Category:Texas Rangers players Category:Toronto Blue Jays broadcasters Category:Toronto Blue Jays players Category:Wausau Timbers players ",
