He then went on to study at Victoria University of Wellington. ==Television== Montgomery's first appearance in TV was on the TVNZ U channel that launched in 2013. He there hosted the show U LATE, where he first met his podcast partner Tim Batt. From U LATE, Montgomery moved into writing for several different comedy shows in New Zealand, such as Jono and Ben at 10. Montgomery's television work includes being a writer and presenter of his magnum opus, Fail Army. ==Podcasts== The Worst Idea Of All Time podcast was started in 2015 by Montgomery and Tim Batt. The podcast follows them as they report upon the viewing experience of the same movie each week for a year. The first season was focused on the Adam Sandler movie Grown Ups 2; the second on Sex and the City 2; and the third season focused on We Are Your Friends. Montgomery and Batt are also the co-hosts of a once-yearly, eternal Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 review podcasts that will air every American Thanksgiving until all five original hosts die, \"Till Death Do Us Blart.\" On the 2018 episode of \u201cTil Death Do Us Blart,\" Guy and Tim announced the fourth season of \u201cThe Worst Idea of All Time\u201d, which focused on the first \u201cSex and the City\u201d film, and was released through 2019. After the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the duo did an \"emergency fifth season,\" in which they watched the film Home Alone 3 every three days until their local New Zealand lockdown orders were lifted. As of the end of September, 2020, Montgomery and Batt have undertaken the sixth season, and instead of rewatching the same movie every week they are watching a different movie from the same film series. The series they are picking are from for the sixth season is the French/American Emmanuelle series of softcore pornography. Montgomery also created a short podcasts series, Hosting, with fellow comedian Carlo Ritchie exploring the cultural differences of Australians and New Zealanders as Ritchie spends a week in the \"land of the long white cloud\" with Montgomery. ==References== Category:Living people Category:New Zealand comedians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
