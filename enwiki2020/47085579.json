    "text": "Qalet Marku Redoubt () was a redoubt in the limits of Naxxar, Malta. It was built in 1715\u20131716 by the Order of Saint John as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. It was demolished to make way for the coast road, but its remains are possibly still buried under the road. ==History== Qalet Marku Redoubt was built in 1715\u20131716 as part of the first building programme of redoubts in Malta. The nearest fortifications to the redoubt were G\u0127allis Battery to the northwest and Qalet Marku Battery to the east. Both of these batteries are now largely destroyed, but some remains still survive. The redoubt originally consisted of a pentagonal platform with a low parapet. A rectangular blockhouse was located at the centre of its gorge. The redoubt was demolished to make way for the Ba\u0127ar i\u010b-\u010aag\u0127aq\u2013Salina coast road. Its remains are probably still buried under the surface of the road. Part of the structure can still be seen protruding from beneath the road, although it is encased in concrete. ==References== ==External links== * *National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:Redoubts in Malta Category:Castles and fortifications of the Knights Hospitaller Category:Military installations established in 1715 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in the 20th century Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Malta Category:Naxxar Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:18th-century fortifications Category:1715 establishments in Malta ",
