In fact, during World War II, much of the area was used as a cemetery. The Chinese name was considered inappropriate for a residential area and so it was changed to the current one, meaning \"nice and prosperous\". ==Features== Sau Mau Ping was part of the early Kwun Tong satellite city in Hong Kong. Sau Mau Ping Estate, Hiu Lai Court and Po Tat Estate are major public housing estates in the area. There is a shopping mall below Po Tat Estate. The United Christian Hospital, serving all of eastern Kowloon, is located in Sau Mau Ping. The hospital was founded in 1973 and is currently undergoing a major expansion scheduled for completion in 2023. ==Transportation== ;Roads * On Sau Road runs through Sau Mau Ping * Sau Mau Ping Road * Hiu Kwong Street * Tseung Kwan O Tunnel links Sau Mau Ping to Tseung Kwan O ;Buses Buses serving Sau Mau Ping ;Kowloon Motor Bus *1A- Sau Mau Ping (Central) \u2194 Star Ferry *11C- Sau Mau Ping (Upper) \u2194 Chuk Yuen Estate *11X- Sau Mau Ping (Upper) \u2194 Hung Hom Station *13D- Po Tat \u2194 Tai Kok Tsui (Island Harbourview) *13M- Kwun Tong (Elegance Road) \u21ba Po Tat *13P- Po Tat \u2192 Lai Kok Estate *13S- Po Tat \u2194 Lam Tin Station *13X- Po Tat \u2194 Tsim Sha Tsui East *14D- Choi Hung \u2194 Yau Tong *88- Tai Wai Station \u2194 Sau Mau Ping (Central) *93A- Po Lam \u2194 Kwun Tong Ferry *93K- Po Lam \u2194 Mong Kok East Station *93M- Po Lam \u21ba Lam Tin Station *95- Tsui Lam \u2194 Jordan (West Kowloon Station) *95M- Tsui Lam \u2194 Kwun Tong (Elegance Road) *98A- Hang Hau (North) \u21ba Ngau Tau Kok Station *98C- Hang Hau (North) \u2194 Mei Foo *98P- Hang Hau (North)/Hong Sing Garden \u2194 Tsim Sha Tsui East *213D- Sau Mau Ping (Central) \u21ba Mong Kok *213M- On Tai \u21ba Lam Tin Station *213X- On Tai \u21ba Tsim Sha Tsui *214- Yau Tong \u2194 Cheung Sha Wan (Kom Tsun Street) *290- Choi Ming \u2194 Tsuen Wan West Station *290A- Choi Ming \u2194 Tsuen Wan West Station *290X- LOHAS Park Station \u2194 Tsuen Wan West Station *N216- Yau Tong \u2194 Hung Hom Station *N293- Mong Kok East Station \u2194 Sheung Tak ;Citybus *A26- Airport \u2194 Yau Tong *A29P- Airport \u2194 Tseung Kwan O Station *E22P- AsiaWorld-Expo \u2194 Yau Tong *N26- Tung Chung Station \u2194 Yau Tong ;Cross Harbour Tunnel Bus *601- Po Tat \u2194 Admiralty Station (East) *601P- Po Tat \u2194 Sheung Wan (Wing Kut Street) *613- On Tai \u2194 Shau Kei Wan *619X- Central (Macau Ferry Terminal) \u2194 Shun Lee *N691- Tiu Keng Leng \u2194 Central (Macau Ferry Terminal) ;Minibus *12- Po Lam \u2194 Sai Kung *13- Tseung Kwan O (Hong Shing Garden) \u2194 Kwun Tong Yue Man Square *17- Tsui Lam \u2194 Lam Tin Station *34M- Hiu Lai Court \u21ba Kwun Tong Yue Man Square *34S- Sau Mau Ping (Upper) \u21ba Kwun Tong Yue Man Square *50- United Christian Hospital \u21ba Kwun Tong Yue Man Square *60- Lam Tin (Kai Tin Estate) \u21ba Shun Lee Estate *71A- Po Tat Estate \u21ba Lam Tin Station *71B- Sau Mau Ping Estate Sau Chi House \u2194 Lam Tin Station *76A- Lam Tin (Kwong Tin Estate) \u21ba United Christian Hospital *76B- United Christian Hospital \u21ba Yau Tong *89A- On Tat \u21ba Ngau Tau Kok *89B- On Tat \u21ba Kowloon Bay *106- Po Lam \u2194 Kowloon Bay *111- Po Lam \u2194 San Po Kong ;MTR Current nearest station is Kwun Tong Station, which can take minibus or bus to travel.
