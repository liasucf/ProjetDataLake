    "text": "In number theory, Euclid's lemma is a lemma that captures a fundamental property of prime numbers, namely: For example, if , , , then , and since this is divisible by 19, the lemma implies that one or both of 133 or 143 must be as well. In fact, . Inherently, if the premise of the lemma does not hold, i.e., is a composite number, its consequent may be either true or false. For example, in the case of , , , composite number 10 divides , but 10 divides neither 4 nor 15. This property is the key in the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. It is used to define prime elements, a generalization of prime numbers to arbitrary commutative rings. Euclid's Lemma shows that in the integers irreducible elements are also prime elements. The proof uses induction so it does not apply to all integral domains. ==Formulations== Let p be a prime number, and assume p divides the product of two integers a and b. (In symbols this is written p \\mid ab. Its negation, p does not divide ab is written p mid ab.) Then p \\mid a or p \\mid b (or both). Equivalent statements are: * If p mid a and p mid b, then p mid ab. * If p mid a and p \\mid ab, then p \\mid b. Euclid's lemma can be generalized from prime numbers to any integers: This is a generalization because if n is prime, either * n \\mid a or * n is relatively prime to a. In this second possibility, n mid a so n \\mid b. ==History== The lemma first appears as proposition 30 in Book VII of Euclid's Elements. It is included in practically every book that covers elementary number theory. The generalization of the lemma to integers appeared in Jean Prestet's textbook Nouveaux El\u00e9mens de Math\u00e9matiques in 1681. In Carl Friedrich Gauss's treatise Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, the statement of the lemma is Euclid's Proposition 14 (Section 2), which he uses to prove the uniqueness of the decomposition product of prime factors of an integer (Theorem 16), admitting the existence as \"obvious.\" From this existence and uniqueness he then deduces the generalization of prime numbers to integers. For this reason, the generalization of Euclid's lemma is sometimes referred to as Gauss's lemma, but some believe this usage is incorrect due to confusion with Gauss's lemma on quadratic residues. ==Proof== ===Proof using B\u00e9zout's lemma=== The usual proof involves another lemma called B\u00e9zout's identity. This states that if and are relatively prime integers (i.e. they share no common divisors other than 1 and -1) there exist integers and such that : rx+sy = 1. Let and be relatively prime, and assume that . By B\u00e9zout's identity, there are and making : rn+sa = 1. Multiply both sides by : : rnb+sab = b. The first term on the left is divisible by , and the second term is divisible by , which by hypothesis is divisible by . Therefore their sum, , is also divisible by . This is the generalization of Euclid's lemma mentioned above. === Proof of Elements === Euclid's lemma is proved at the Proposition 30 in Book VII of Euclid's Elements. The original proof is difficult to understand as is, so we quote the commentary from . ;Proposition 19 :If four numbers be proportional, the number produced from the first and fourth is equal to the number produced from the second and third; and, if the number produced from the first and fourth be equal to that produced from the second and third, the four numbers are proportional. ;Proposition 20 :The least numbers of those that have the same ratio with them measures those that have the same ratio the same number of times\u2014the greater the greater and the less the less. ;Proposition 21 :Numbers prime to one another are the least of those that have the same ratio with them. ;Proposition 29 :Any prime number is prime to any number it does not measure. ;Proposition 30 :If two numbers, by multiplying one another, make the same number, and any prime number measures the product, it also measures one of the original numbers. ;Proof of 30 :If c, a prime number, measure ab, c measures either a or b. Suppose c does not measure a. Therefore c, a are prime to one another. \uff3bVII. 29\uff3d Suppose ab\uff1dmc. Therefore c : a \uff1d b : m. \uff3bVII. 19\uff3d Hence \uff3bVII. 20, 21\uff3d b\uff1dnc, where n is some integer. Therefore c measures b. Similarly, if c does not measure b, c measures a. Therefore c measures one or other of the two numbers a, b.
