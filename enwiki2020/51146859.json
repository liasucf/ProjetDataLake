    "text": "Rastroj\u00f3n is a Maya archaeological site in western Honduras. It appears to be associated with the major Classical period city of Cop\u00e1n\u2015the capital of a Maya kingdom that existed from 5th to 9th centuries CE\u2015situated just two kilometres away. Rastroj\u00f3n was abandoned following the collapse of the Cop\u00e1n kingdom in 822; the site was constructed on top of a geological fault that made building difficult, so it may be that the inhabitants judged the location not worth the effort after the fall of the nearby royal centre. Rastroj\u00f3n was discovered in 1979, during a survey of the area around Cop\u00e1n. From 2007 to 2013, the Rastroj\u00f3n Archaeological Project (, PARACOPAN), sponsored by Harvard University and the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History undertook a programme of rescue archaeology and conservation at the site. The project was led by archaeologists William Fash and Jorge Ramos, and conservator Antonia Mart\u00ednez, and resulted in the site being turned into a protected archaeological park. == See also == * El Puente == References == Category:Archaeological sites in Honduras Category:Maya sites in Honduras ",
