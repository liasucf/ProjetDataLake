    "text": "Lady handing a coin to a Servant-Girl (c. 1668\u201372) is an oil on canvas painting by the Dutch painter Pieter de Hooch. It is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is now in a private collection. This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1908, who wrote; \"51. Woman giving Money to a Servant-Girl. In a well-furnished room sits a lady with an embroidery-pillow on her lap; she gives money from her purse to a servant-girl, who carries a market-pail. A little child pulls the girl by her apron. At the side by an open window is a table with a cloth, upon which are a water-bottle and a glass. It is a fine and carefully executed picture. Canvas, 27 1/2 inches by 24 1/2 inches. Sales. Jan Danser Nijman, in Amsterdam, August 16, 1797, No. 114 (400 florins, Roos). B. Ocke, in Leyden, April 21, 1817, No. 54 (370 florins, Van den Berg). [Compare the description of the picture in the Amsterdam sale of March 29, 1826; see 30.]\"entry 51 for Woman giving Money to a Servant-Girl in Hofstede de Groot, 1908 According to Peter C. Sutton, this work is not just similar, but is the same as no. 30 documented by Hofstede de Groot : \"30. LADY WITH A SERVANT-GIRL. Sm. n. To the right in a room, paved with white and brown tiles, sits a lady. She wears a red jacket trimmed with fur and a skirt of the same colour ; on her lap lies an embroidery-cushion. She is giving money from her pocket to a servant-girl who has a market-pail in her right hand. A child is pulling the girl to the left by her apron. By the open window to the right is a table with a cloth, upon which are placed a mug and a glass on a silver tray. On the wall above the fireplace hang a landscape with Venus and Cupid, and a mirror in which the picture is reflected. A vine- tendril creeps in at the window. It is a fine picture ; the figures are very good, and the execution is broad and delicate.
