His research in collaborative health is highly recognized and implemented; specially in the Swedish welfare sector. == Career == H\u00e5kan Sandberg has undergraduate University studies in literature, Nordic language, psychology, philosophy and education from the Swedish universities in Uppsala, Link\u00f6ping, \u00d6rebro and Malm\u00f6. He completed his PhD in education at Uppsala University 1995. Following his first focus of research, teamwork in Child and youth psychiatry, he moved on to make team research and educational research as a senior fellow at M\u00e4lardalen University where he became an Associate Professor in Education in 2004. He is also a well known author of textbooks in the area of teamwork as well as pedagogics. H\u00e5kan Sandberg has been speaker at national and international conferences and have been guest researcher at Stirling university. === Collaborative Health === The concept of collaborative health was developed in connection with team research by the H\u00e5kan Sandberg, for the first time in a research report in Swedish 2004. Working life research had at the end of the 20th century made clear that working life conditions in the welfare sector affect peoples\u2019 health (cf. concepts like psycho \u2013 social conditions, mobbing, burnout, fatigue etc.). Following his PhD thesis regarding teamwork in childcare and youth psychiatry, Sandberg expanded his team research to the entire welfare sector. In this work, finding that teamwork consequences are not only about productivity and efficiency, but also about the wellbeing of the team members, Sandberg combines collaboration and wellbeing in teamwork in terms of collaborative health thereby focusing the \u201cteamwork trend\u201d with its emphasis on intensive collaboration. Curious about the concept\u2019s position in an international context, Sandberg decided to publish articles about collaborative health in English, which in this context also was found to be an innovation (2010, 2013). In his overview of his own research and how the concept of collaborative health was found to be a relevant description of the individual\u2019s wellbeing and health in the intensive collaboration of teamwork, Sandberg defines collaborative health as : The physical, psychological and social health resources the individual uses in teamwork and, at the same time, health resources which are influenced by teamwork. Sandberg also concludes that collaborative health has a role to play in highlighting the new collaborative demands in the service sector and creates space for a new perspective in research based on this knowledge. Sandberg has also published works in education, communication, health and social services. He recently also made a transition from being a university professors to dedicating more time in private research and consultations and publishing more of his ideas in both Swedish and English. Collaborative health has recently (2017) began to be spread as a tool in developmental projects concerning collaboration between authorities in the welfare sector in Sweden. == References == == External links == * www.studentlitteratur.se, Studentlitteratur * www.samarbetshalsan.s * www.mdh.se * http://www.ingenjoren.se/2011/10/14320/ * https://www.regionorebrolan.se/amm/teamarbete?email=bwfpbhrvomfubmlrys5nzwxpbkbvcmvicm9sbc5zzt9yzwnlaxzlcm5hbwu9qw5uawthiedlbglu Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Swedish scholars and academics Category:Uppsala University alumni ",
