The mental state of a common man who resembles the reigning Super Star in Cinema is anybody's guess. Everyone will identify him and even chase him. When they understand their folly, worship would turn into teasing and he will become the butt of ridicule before everyone. It was a story taken from real life. I had seen girls rushing towards a poor man only because he had a face that almost looked like that of Mohanlal. This incident provided me with much fodder for an experiment. That's how Superstar was born\".http://www.sify.com/movies/malayalam/interview.php?id=6005432&cid;=2406 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990 films Category:Indian films Category:1990s Malayalam-language films Category:Films directed by Vinayan ",
