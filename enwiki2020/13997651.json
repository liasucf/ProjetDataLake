    "text": "The 86 class is a class of electric locomotives built by Comeng, Granville for the State Rail Authority of New South Wales. ==History== The 86 class initially hauled passenger and freight services to Lithgow on the Main Western line and Wyong on the Main Northern line. Their sphere of operation extended to Newcastle on the latter line in June 1984 and to Port Kembla in January 1986 when the Illawarra line was electrified. With a one-hour rating of 4,400 horsepower (hp), the 86 class was the most powerful locomotive in Australia at the time. Although no longer in regular use, the class remains among the most powerful in the country. Despite their higher power rating, they were generally regarded as inferior to the Metropolitan-Vickers built 46 class, which dated from the late 1950s. The last, 8650 was delivered as a Bo-Bo-Bo trial unit.\"8650\" Railway Digest November 1985 page 320 It spent long periods out of traffic undergoing repair. In 1994/95 all were repainted by A Goninan & Co, Taree into FreightCorp blue.\"86 Class Repaints\" Railway Digest April 1995 page 35 By October 1997 18 had been withdrawn from service with cracked frames.\"Out of Service\" Railway Digest October 1997 page 31 By this stage the amount of work requiring electrics was reducing. National Rail decided it would through haul its services and from March 1998 FreightCorp ceased operating them on Main Northern line services.\"Electric Locos\" Railway Digest June 1998 page 35 The need for electrics continued to decline with their remaining duties mainly being hauling coal trains from Lithgow to Port Kembla. The last examples were withdrawn in June 2002. In 2002, most were sold to Silverton Rail and taken to Broken Hill then sold again in February 2006 to Allco Finance Group with some on sold, but most scrapped.86 Class Railpage86 Class Vicsig Four were leased back to RailCorp in 2004 (8601, 8609, 8622 and 8644) for use on infrastructure trains during construction of the Bondi Junction turnback. ==Survivors== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Preserved 86 class locomotives !Number !Owner !Location !Status !References/Notes |- |8601 |Dorrigo Steam Railway & Museum |West Tamworth |Stored | |- |8606 |Sydney Electric Train Society |Lithgow |Operational | |- |8607 |Private owner |Canberra |Stored | |- |8644 |Private owner (member of SETS) |Chullora |Stored | |- |8646 |Transport Heritage NSW |Thirlmere |Static display | |- |8649 |Sydney Electric Train Society |Cardiff |Under overhaul | |- |8650 |Dorrigo Steam Railway & Museum |West Tamworth |Stored |Bo-Bo-Bo |} ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== Category:Bo-Bo-Bo locomotives Category:Co-Co locomotives Category:Commonwealth Engineering locomotives Category:Electric locomotives of New South Wales Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1983 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Australia Category:1500 V DC locomotives ",
