Pp. 538\u2013541. . The Inferior Oolite Group as more recently defined is a Jurassic lithostratigraphic group (a sequence of rock strata) in southern and eastern England . It has been variously known in the past as the Under Oolite (or Oolyte), the Inferior Oolite, the Inferior Oolite Series and the Redbourne Group.Waters, C.N. et al. 2007 Stratigraphical Chart of the United Kingdom: Southern Britain British Geological Survey (poster) ==Outcrops== The rocks are exposed from Dorset and Somerset eastwards and northwards through the English Midlands to Yorkshire.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale geological map (England & Wales) sheets It is present at depth in the Wessex-Weald Basin, where it reaches its greatest thickness of 120 m. ==Lithology and stratigraphy== Inferior Oolite (Doulting Stone) at Doulting Stone Quarry, England. The group consists of up to 120 m thickness of oolitic limestones and subordinate sandstones and mudstones laid down during the Jurassic Period. In the East Midlands it consists of (in descending order i.e. oldest last) the Lincolnshire Limestone, Grantham and Northampton Sand formations whereas in the Cotswold Hills it consists of the Salperton Limestone, Aston Limestone and Birdlip Limestone formations.http://www.bgs.ac.uk/Lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=INO (BGS on-line lexicon of rock units)Waters, C.N. et al 2007 Stratigraphical Chart of the United Kingdom:Southern Britain British Geological Survey (poster) The limestones are rich in organic material. The ammonite Parkinsonia parkinsoni, an index fossil for the Bathonian,Wynn Jones, R: Applied Paleontology. page 146, Cambridge University Press is native to the Inferior Oolite of Burton Bradstock. Within Dorset, the Oolite is not subdivided into separately named formations, but is simply considered the Inferior Oolite Formation, sometimes subdivided into the Lower and Upper Inferior Oolite Formations. Within the vicinity of Yeovil it is divided into members which are in ascending order the Corton Denham Member, which predominantly consists of blue siltstone is about 2.5 m thick with the transitional top consisting of green Marl, the Oborne Ironshot Member, the term \"ironshot\" refers to ferruginised Oolite. The upper portion of which contains intensely bioturbated limestone. Moving Into the Upper Inferior Oolite the Sherborne Limestone Member, which consists of exposed yellow brown fresh grey bioclastic limestone, while the overlying Combe Limestone Member, consists of rubbly limestone and marl, a full stratigraphy of the locality is given below {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ ! colspan=\"6\" |Stratigraphy of the Inferior Oolite at Frogden Quarry, Dorset |- !Formation !Member !Bed !Lithology !Thickness !Ammonite Zone |- | rowspan=\"4\" |Upper Inferior Oolite Formation | colspan=\"2\" |Combe Limestone Member |Broken limestone and marl |Over 5.6 metres |Garantiana Zone-Parkinsoni Zone |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Sherborne Limestone Member |Redhole Lane Beds |Blocky Limestone |2 metres |Garantiana Zone, Dichotoma Subzone |- |Sherborne Building Stone Beds |Mottled, blocky limestone |~1.5 metres | |- |Acanthothyris Beds |\"Brown sandy biomicrites interbedded with brown marls\" |Up to 1.5 metres | |- | rowspan=\"5\" |Lower Inferior Oolite Formation | rowspan=\"2\" |Oborne Ironshot Member |Oborne Road Stone Bed |Bioturbated and intensely burrowed limestone |~0.8 metres |Niortense Zone |- |Frogden Ironshot Bed |Ferruginous oolite |~1.2 metres |Sauzei to Humphriesianum Zones |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Corton Denham Member |Green Grained White Marl |Marl |0.01-0.15 metres |Laeviuscula Zone |- |Blue Bed |Very hard blue intensely burrowed siltstone |0.85-1 metre |Laeviuscula Zone, Trigonalis Subzone |- |Corton Denham Beds |Lenticular hard blue-grey siltstone, in channels. separated by nodular siltstone |Seen to 2 metres |Concavum-Ovale Zones |} ==Vertebrate fauna== Ornithopod tracks geographically located in North Yorkshire, England.
