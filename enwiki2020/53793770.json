    "text": "Looking Into My Dreams, Awilda, or simply Awilda, is a sculpture by Jaume Plensa. The 39-foot tall sculpture originally stood in the surf of Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro, before being moved to Chicago's Millennium Park. It stood in Millennium Park from June 2014 until January 2016. As of March 2017, Awilda stands at the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami. It is composed of resin and marble dust, with a metal support structure and an internal frame of fiberglass. Awilda is based on a real person, a Dominican girl who came to Spain with her mother, who Plensa knew in Barcelona. Plensa took her portrait with a laser scanner, capturing 3D information to manipulate and scale into larger models. ==See also== * List of public art in Chicago == External links == * Jaume Plensa, LOOKING INTO MY DREAMS, AWILDA, 2016 * Jaume Plensa - Looking into my Dreams (Awilda) OIR 2012 English Subtitles ==References== Category:Millennium Park Category:Outdoor sculptures in Chicago Category:Resin sculptures ",
