    "text": "Ellen Crosby Roosevelt (August 20, 1868 in Rosedale, New York \u2013 September 26, 1954 in Hyde Park, New York) was an American tennis player. She was the daughter of John Aspinwall Roosevelt, an estate proprietor, and Ellen Murray Crosby. She started playing tennis with her sister Grace in 1879 when her father installed a tennis court at their mansion 'Rosedale'. She won the women's singles title at the 1890 U.S. Championships defeating the 1888 and 1889 champion Bertha Townsend in the final in two straight sets. That year she also won the doubles title with her sister. They were the first pair of sisters to win the U.S. Championships and remained the only pair to do so until the Williams sisters equalled their achievement in 1999. At the 1893 U.S. Championships she won the mixed doubles title partnering Oliver Campbell. A first cousin of Franklin D. Roosevelt, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1975. ==Grand Slam finals== ===Singles (1 title)=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:70px\"|Result !style=\"width:50px\"|Year !style=\"width:200px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:180px\"|Opponent !style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Winner || 1890 || U.S. Championships || Grass || Bertha Townsend || 6\u20132, 6\u20132 |} ===Doubles (1 title)=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:70px\"|Result !style=\"width:50px\"|Year !style=\"width:200px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:180px\"|Partner !style=\"width:180px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Winner || 1890 |U.S. National Championships |Grass | Grace Roosevelt | Margarette Ballard Bertha Townsend | 6\u20131, 6\u20132 |} ===Mixed doubles (1 title)=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:70px\"|Result !style=\"width:50px\"|Year !style=\"width:200px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:180px\"|Partner !style=\"width:180px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Winner || 1893 |U.S. National Championships |Grass | Clarence Hobart | Ethel Bankston Robert Willson | 6\u20134, 4\u20136, 10\u20136 |} ==References== == External links == * Category:1868 births Category:1954 deaths Category:19th-century American people Category:19th-century female tennis players Category:American female tennis players Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:People from Hyde Park, New York Ellen Category:International Tennis Hall of Fame inductees Category:Tennis people from New York (state) Category:United States National champions (tennis) Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in women's singles Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in women's doubles Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in mixed doubles ",
