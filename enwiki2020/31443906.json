    "text": "Vida Arena (branded as VIDA Arena) is a multi-purpose indoor arena located in V\u00e4xj\u00f6, Sweden. The arena opened in September 2011 and is best known as the home arena for the ice hockey team V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Lakers. It seats 5,750 spectators. ==Construction== The construction of Vida Arena began in September 2010 and was finished in summer 2011, in time for the V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Lakers' debut season in the Elitserien (now named the SHL), the top-tier ice hockey league in Sweden. Although mainly intended to be used for ice hockey, Vida Arena is also used for other events such as concerts and news conferences. The arena is named after the Vida Group, the company that acquired the naming rights for Vida Arena in September 2010, for the upcoming 14 seasons (expiring after the 2023\u201324 season). ==Spectator capacity== As of the 2019\u201320 season, Vida Arena is the SHL's newest arena and has a spectator capacity of 5,750, making it the SHL's capacity-wise fourth-smallest arena. For the entire 2011\u201312 season, the arena had a capacity of 5,329 spectators. Plans were announced to extend the capacity to at least 6,000. Prior to the beginning of the 2012\u201313 season, the capacity was increased to 5,800 spectators. In October 2012, however, the capacity was slightly reduced to 5,700 due to concerns from spectators. Level 4 was mainly affected. ==Inauguration== The arena was officially inaugurated on 17 September 2011, in an ice hockey game between V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Lakers and Link\u00f6pings HC. The arena tickets for the game were outsold within just one hour, with the Lakers' marketing manager speculating that they could've sold out two arenas. Former V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Lakers crowd favorite Shjon Podein watched the game live in the arena. Link\u00f6ping won the game 4\u20132 in front of 5,502 spectators. However, the Lakers' premier game on 13 September, on away ice against Fr\u00f6lunda HC, was shown on the Vida Arena's Jumbotron in front of 2,400 spectators, with free entrance, as a preview of the Vida Arena experience and a test of the arena's technical features. Fr\u00f6lunda won the game 2\u20130. ==Arenastaden== Vida Arena is part of the sports complex \"Arenastaden\" (Arena town), which also includes a new football stadium, a floorball arena, and an arena for athletics. Vida Arena is connected with V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Ishall, an old arena inaugurated in 1970 which, since a renovation which took place in 2006, has a capacity of 4,000 spectators. ==Other events== Vida Arena hosted the first semifinal of Melodifestivalen 2012 on 4 February 2012. This was the third time that V\u00e4xj\u00f6 hosted a Melodifestivalen stage, after 2002 and 2005 (both times in Tipshallen). ==Sans Cash== Vida Arena is the first cashless arena in Sweden. ==Gallery== Vida Arena skymning 6497.jpg | Vida Arena's west part of the front exterior.
