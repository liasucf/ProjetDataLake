    "text": "Rappahannock Academy was a military academy founded in 1813 in Virginia. Located on a hill near the Rappahannock River, the site was deemed well situated and brick buildings were constructed. The school's name was changed to Rappahannock Academy and Military Institute (RA&MI;) in 1847. William Mahone taught at RA&MI; from January 1848 until July 1849. It was as large as Virginia Military Institute by 1860. Subjects taught at the school included military science and uniform requirements. The American Civil War (1861 - 1865) disrupted the school's program and drew most of its students into service. The historic Mount Church (built circa 1750) was given by the state of Virginia to the school.https://books.google.com/books?id=xxVhymOH3usC&pg;=PA58&dq;=Rappahannock+Academy&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwi68prG9dDZAhVDOKwKHWhXB50Q6AEILDAB#v=onepage&q;=Rappahannock%20Academy&f;=false pages 293 and 347 Charles A.
