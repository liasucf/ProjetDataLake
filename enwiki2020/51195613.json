According to author Michael Pollock it was \"home to mellow jazz musicians and tired prostitutes\". \"Guitarist Pat Martino notes that Jimmy Smith and Kenny Burrell would frequently play at the club. It was at the Jockey Club that he had first seen Jimmy Smith with Charles Earland. The Jockey Club was destroyed by a fire in September 1982; the club had been closed for years and was reopened in May 1982. ==References== Category:Jazz clubs in Atlantic City, New Jersey Category:Nightclubs in Atlantic City, New Jersey ",
