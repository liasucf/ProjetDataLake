    "text": "Pentax *ist D is a digital SLR camera produced by Pentax, released in 2003. The *ist D produces a 6.1 megapixel resolution image, using same sensor as Nikon D100. It was the smallest and lightest dSLR at the time, but still well equipped. For example, it had a large and bright pentaprism viewfinder, compared to pentamirror in other similarly priced competition. == External links == * Pentax official site * DPReview of Pentax *ist D == Images == Image:Pentax istD w FA20-35 K7NS1900.jpg|Pentax *istD w FA20-35 Image:Pentax istD K7NS1880.jpg|Pentax *istD DSLR photo camera body Image:Pentax istD w FA20-35 K7NS1887.jpg|Pentax *istD DSLR photo camera body with FA 20-35/4 lens ist D Category:Pentax K-mount cameras ",
