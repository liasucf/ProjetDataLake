Co.Li\u00f1\u00e1n, A., Mart\u00ednez-Ruiz, D., Vera, M., & S\u00e1nchez, A. L. (2017). The large-activation-energy analysis of extinction of counterflow diffusion flames with non-unity Lewis numbers of the fuel. Combustion and Flame, 175, 91-106. Li\u00f1\u00e1n used counterflowing jets of fuel and oxidizer to study the diffusion flame structure, analyzing for the entire range of Damk\u00f6hler number. His theory predicted four different type of flame structure as follows, * Nearly- frozen ignition regime, where deviations from the frozen flow conditions are small (no reaction sheet exist in this regime), * Partial burning regime, where both fuel and oxidizer cross the reaction zone and enter into the frozen flow on other side, * Premixed flame regime, where only one of the reactants cross the reaction zone, in which case, reaction zone separates a frozen flow region from a near-equilibrium region, * Near-equilibrium diffusion-controlled regime, is a thin reaction zone, separating two near-equilibrium region. ==Mathematical description== The theory is well explained in the simplest possible model. Thus, assuming a one-step irreversible Arrhenius law for the combustion chemistry with constant density and transport properties and with unity Lewis number reactants, the governing equation for the non-dimensional temperature field T(y) in the stagnation point flow reduces to :\\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2} + y\\frac{dT}{dy} = -\\mathrm{Da}\\ y_F y_O e^{-T_a/T}, \\quad Z= \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{erfc}\\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt 2}\\right) where Z is the mixture fraction, \\mathrm{Da} is the Damk\u00f6hler number, T_a = E/R is the activation temperature and the fuel mass fraction and oxidizer mass fraction are scaled with their respective feed stream values, given by :\\begin{align} y_F &= Z + T_o - T \\\\\\ y_O &= (1-Z)/S + T_o - T \\end{align} with boundary conditions T(-\\infty)=T(\\infty)=T_o. Here, T_o is the unburnt temperature profile (frozen solution) and S is the stoichiometric parameter (mass of oxidizer stream required to burn unit mass of fuel stream). The four regime are analyzed by trying to solve above equations using activation energy asymptotics and Damk\u00f6hler number asymptotics. The solution to above problem is multi-valued. Treating mixture fraction Z as independent variable reduces the equation to :\\frac{d^2 T}{dZ^2} = - 2\\pi e^{y^2} \\mathrm{Da}\\ y_F y_O e^{-T_a/T} with boundary conditions T(0)=T(1)=T_o and y = \\sqrt{2} \\mathrm{erfc}^{-1}(2Z). ==Extinction Damk\u00f6hler number== The reduced Damk\u00f6hler number is defined as follows :\\delta = 8\\pi Z_s^2 e^{y_s^2} \\left(\\frac{T_s^2}{T_a}\\right)^3 \\mathrm{Da}\\ e^{-T_a/T} where y_s =\\sqrt{2} \\mathrm{erfc}^{-1}(2Z_s),\\ Z_s = 1/(S+1) and T_s = T_o + Z_s. The theory predicted an expression for the reduced Damk\u00f6hler number at which the flame will extinguish, given by :\\delta_E = e\\left[(1-\\gamma)-(1-\\gamma)^2+0.26(1-\\gamma)^3 +0.055(1-\\gamma)^4\\right] where \\gamma=1-2(1-\\alpha)(1-Z_s). ==See also== *Li\u00f1\u00e1n's equation *Emmons problem *Clarke\u2013Riley diffusion flame *Burke\u2013Schumann flame ==References== Category:Fluid dynamics Category:Combustion ",
