In a 2013 interview, Pearson explained why his relationship with Saosin fell through. \"They flew me out to California and I did a bunch of practices and recorded five demos. A few months later I came back and did some writing sessions. Time just stretched and stretched after that. It was a complete maybe for almost two years. They would send me demos every few months. During this span I also toured with Emarosa and did a couple months of writing and recording demos with them. It wasn\u2019t until I was doing the music video for \u201cUp In the Air\u201d from my solo project when Saosin told me they were probably going to do something instrumental.\" ===2011\u201312: Emarosa=== In April 2011, American rock band Emarosa announced the departure of their lead vocalist Jonny Craig.
