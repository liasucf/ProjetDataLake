She has taken the clothes from a bed enclosed in a wooden partition, and has laid them over a chair. She stands in profile to the left, and smiles at her little girl, who stands in the open doorway to the left with an apple in her left hand. The child's figure is illumined from a high window on the left and from a door in the background. This door leads from a little ante-room into the open air, where walls and garden hedges are visible. In the left foreground is a table with a jug ; behind it is a chair.
