    "text": "Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the FLT1 gene. == Function == Oncogene FLT belongs to the src gene family and is related to oncogene ROS (MIM 165020). Like other members of this family, it shows tyrosine protein kinase activity that is important for the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. The sequence structure of the FLT gene resembles that of the FMS gene (MIM 164770); hence, Yoshida et al. (1987) proposed the name FLT as an acronym for FMS-like tyrosine kinase. The ablation of VEGFR1 by chemical and genetic means has also recently been found to augment the conversion of white adipose tissue to brown adipose tissue as well as increase brown adipose angiogenesis in mice. Functional genetic variation in FLT1 (rs9582036) has been found to affect non-small cell lung cancer survival. == Interactions == FLT1 has been shown to interact with PLCG1 and vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B). == See also == * VEGF receptors == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Tyrosine kinase receptors ",
