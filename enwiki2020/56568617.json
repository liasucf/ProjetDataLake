They were running side by side when Harvick appeared to move down the track and into the side of Larson\u2019s car. The impact sent Harvick\u2019s car into the outside wall, causing heavy damage. The race restarted on lap 43. Martin Truex Jr., master of stage wins last season, scored his first of the new year, leading Kyle Busch by 3.5 seconds. Also in the top 10 were Joey Logano, Brad Keselowski, Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Larson, Kurt Busch, Erik Jones, Clint Bowyer and Denny Hamlin. The second caution of the race flew on lap 62 for the conclusion of the first stage. === Stage 2 === The race restarted on lap 67. Trevor Bayne slapped the outside wall after slight contact with Ryan Newman. The incident produced the race\u2019s third caution of the race, which was on lap 109. Bayne called his meeting with the wall one of the hardest of his career. The race restarted on lap 114. Truex scored again at the end of stage two, leading Brad Keselowski by 1.8 seconds. Following were Kyle Busch, Denny Hamlin, Erik Jones, Joey Logano, Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Larson, Clint Bowyer and William Byron. The fourth caution of the race flew on lap 122 for conclusion of stage 2. === Final stage === Martin Truex Jr. swept all three stages and won the race from the pole position. The race restarted on lap 127. The fifth caution of the race flew on lap 130 when David Ragan spun out in turn 2, so Ty Dillon won the free pass under caution. The race restarted on lap 132. The closing portion of the race featured a battle for the lead matching Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Busch and Kyle Larson. With 18 laps to go, Truex had a five-second lead over Busch and Larson, who were fighting for second. Martin Truex Jr., last year\u2019s Cup champion, returned to victory lane \u2014 a place he visited eight times in 2017 \u2014 and, at the same time, dropped Kevin Harvick\u2019s name from NASCAR\u2019s marquee. At least temporarily. ==== Post race ==== \u201cThis is a reassurance that what we\u2019re doing is working,\u201d Truex said. \u201cIt just feels good to win. I don\u2019t really worry about who\u2019s winning or who else is fast. Obviously, the 4 (Harvick) has been quick and they have a great team. But, as we\u2019ve seen today, we can put together a run like that, as well. \u201cIt feels good to be able to find that speed.\u201d ===Stage Results=== Stage 1 Laps: 60 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:98% |- !
