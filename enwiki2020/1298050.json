    "text": "Conrail Shared Assets Operations or CSAO is the commonly used name for modern- day Conrail (reporting mark CRCX). Conrail is an American railroad company. It operates three networks\u2014the North Jersey, South Jersey/Philadelphia, and Detroit Shared Assets Areas,https://www.conrail.com/system-map/ where it serves as a contract local carrier and switching company for its owners, CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway. When most of the former Conrail's track was split between these two railroads, the three shared assets areas (a total of about 1,200 miles of track) were kept separate to avoid giving one railroad an advantage in those areas. The company operates using its own employees and infrastructure, but owns no equipment outside MOW equipment. ==North Jersey Shared Assets Area== The North Jersey Shared Assets Area stretches from the North Bergen Yard in North Bergen, New Jersey south into Jersey City and Newark, and beyond to Manville (Port Reading Junction) and Trenton, much of which is operated over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and New Jersey Transit lines through trackage rights. Primary connections are to CSX's River Subdivision north to Albany, New York at North Bergen, NS's Southern Tier Line northwest to Buffalo, New York at Croxton Yard in Jersey City, NS's Lehigh Line west to Allentown, Pennsylvania and CSX's Trenton Subdivision southwest to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at Manville, and the Conrail South Jersey/Philadelphia Shared Assets Area at Trenton. Oak Island Yard is the principal yard for the region with smaller ones at Bayonne, Greenville (Jersey City), Linden, Manville, Metuchen, Newark, Old Bridge and Port Reading (Woodbridge).http://www.choosenj.com/getattachment/Quality-of- Life/Healthcare-(1)/New-Jersey-Transportation.pdf.aspx *Center Street Branch, Kearny Meadows, \"P&HL;\" - Centre Street Bridge (demolished) Passaic and Harsimus Line \"P&HL;\" - formerly Northeast Corridor at Waverly, New Jersey, now Oak Island Yard to Jersey City **Northern Running Track \"NRTB\" - from 'CP Hack' and interchange with Passaic and Harsimus Line with connections to Marion Junction, New Jersey, Croxton Yard, interchange with New York Susquehanna & Western at 'CP West Croxton' and ending at 'CP-1' of CSX North Bergen Yard *National Docks Branch \"NATB\" - Northern Running Track at Bergen Junction, New Jersey to Upper Bay Bridge to Oak Island Yard *Garden State Secondary formerly Chemical Coast Line \"COAS\" - Oak Island Yard to North Jersey Coast Line at Perth Amboy *Lehigh Line \"LEHL\" - National Docks Branch, Bayonne to CSX Trenton Subdivision and NS Lehigh Line at Manville *Perth Amboy Running Track *Amboy Secondary \"AMBS\" - from William to Midway (Amtrak) *Freehold Industrial Track - a line which diverges from the Amboy Secondary at Monmouth Junction, NJ and heads southeastward through Freehold, with an inactive portion which continues to a junction with the Southern Secondary in Farmingdale, NJ *Sayreville Running Track and Gillespie Branch and Phoenix Branch *Southern Secondary \"SOUS\" - trackage rights over NJ Transit's North Jersey Coast Line from South Amboy to Red Bank, NJ, then over the former Central Railroad of New Jersey's Southern Division from Red Bank to Lakehurst, NJ, and a mostly inactive spur to Toms River, NJ.
