Sue Album Discography, accessed April 25, 2017Ray Bryant catalog, accessed April 25, 2017Enciclopedia del Jazz Ray Bryant discography, accessed April 26, 2017 == Reception == The Allmusic review stated \"Ray Bryant is a master of soul-jazz but these 1964 studio recordings are a bit of a disappointment. ... Bryant leans a bit too heavily toward rhythm & blues, while his music might have been more interesting heard as piano solos. A piano of questionable tuning and muddy sound hardly helps matters. ... Most fans of Ray Bryant can safely bypass this release\". == Track listing == All compositions by Ray Bryant except where noted # \"I Miss You So\" (Bertha Scott, Jimmie Henderson, Sid Robin) \u2013 3:24 # \"I Almost Lost My Mind \" (Ivory Joe Hunter) \u2013 4:17 # \"Since I Fell For You\" (Buddy Johnson) \u2013 2:55 # \"They All Say I'm The Biggest Fool\" (Johnson) \u2013 2:37 # \"Gospel Bird\" \u2013 4:25 # \"Little Suzie '65\" \u2013 2:29 # \"Lonely Avenue\" (Doc Pomus, Ray Charles) \u2013 3:30 # \"Please Send Me Someone to Love\" (Percy Mayfield) \u2013 3:40 # \"Stick With It\" \u2013 4:03 # \"I Don't Care Who Knows\" (Johnson) \u2013 3:49 # \"Goldfinger\" (John Barry, Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley) \u2013 2:40 # \"Adalia\" \u2013 2:48 == Personnel == *Ray Bryant \u2013 piano *Wally Richardson \u2013 guitar (tracks 3, 5, 7 & 9) *Tommy Bryant \u2013 bass *Sonny Brown (tracks 6, 11 & 12), Walter Perkins (tracks 1\u20135 & 7\u201310) \u2013 drums == References == Category:1965 albums Category:Ray Bryant albums Category:Sue Records albums ",
