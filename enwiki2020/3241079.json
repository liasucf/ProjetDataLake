    "text": "Mellowdrone is a rock band from Los Angeles, California formed in 1999. ==Biography== Mellowdrone originated as Jonathan Bates' solo project, but expanded to a full band with Tony DeMatteo (guitar and keyboards), Scott Ellis (drums) and Greg Griffith (bass). Griffith and Ellis were later replaced by Camila Gutierrez and Brian Borg respectively. The band's music encompasses a range of styles from lo-fi, indie rock and experimental. Their debut album, Box, was released in 2006 on Columbia Records. Shortly after, Gutierrez formed Uh Huh Her and left Mellowdrone. The band continued as a three-piece, with Bates taking over as bassist. Their follow-up album, Angry Bear, was released in 2009 on Coming Home Records. Mellowdrone's music has appeared on several television shows, including Project Runway, Six Feet Under, and Cane.http://www.what-song.com/Artist/4225/Mellowdrone \"C'Mon Try A Little Bit\" was featured in the opening scene of Driv3r. Their song \"Oh My\" was featured on the FIFA 07 soundtrack and the horror movie Prom Night. \"Fashionably Uninvited\" was included in the soundtrack for the 2007 film The Invisible.IMDb The Invisible - Soundtrack Listing Accessed January 14, 2008 \"Orange Marmalade\" was featured in the 2008 film Never Back Down and in the film Fling. \"Beautiful Day\" was featured on Project Gotham Racing 2. After becoming frustrated with the logistics of a full band, Jonathan Bates began a solo project in 2010, dubbed Big Black Delta. He has also played as a touring musician for M83. In 2017, members of The Neighbourhood who were fans of Mellowdrone contacted Jonathan and Tony for a collaboration. Both members accepted, leading to them meeting for the first time in eight years. The two were inspired to start writing songs together again, and Mellowdrone was eventually revived as a band, producing an EP in 2018. == Discography == ===...Boredom Never Sounded So Sweet=== *EP (1999) #[48-17-6] #Ride (Finish Me Off) #Bitelip #My First Love Song #Monsters #Justine #Spoiled Boy #Happy Together ===Glassblower=== *EP (2001) # Fall On Your Knees # You And I # Glassblower # It All Makes Sense Now # #3 ===A Demonstration of Intellectual Property=== *EP (2003) # Tinylittle # Fashionably Uninvited # And Repeat # No More Options # Ridealong # Beautiful Day # Bitelip ===Go Get 'em Tiger=== *EP (2004) # Bonemarrow # Worst Song Ever # Motivation # I'm Too Young # Pretty Boy # Anglophile ===Box=== *(2006) # C'Mon Try A Little Bit # Oh My # Four Leaf Clover # Fashionably Uninvited # Beautiful Day # Fuck It Man # Whatever The Deal # Madison # And Repeat # Orange Marmalade # Amazing # Bone Marrow # Limb To Limb ===Maquina 7\"=== *(2008) # Maquina # Machine (En Espanol) # Settle the Hum (B-Side) # Wouldn't Mind (B-Side) ===Angry Bear=== *(2009) # Wherever You May Go # Elephant # Alone=In Your Face # Esmeralda # Big Winner # Sugar # Drinking Song # Lady in Her Underwear # Logged Hours # Button # Jumping Off the Pier # DMT ===2018=== *EP (2018) # I Don't Believe It # Way Out ===3=== *EP (2018) # Let It Out # Pascal's Wager # I Forgive You ==References== ==External links== * Mellowdrone website Category:Rock music groups from California Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:Electronic music groups from California Category:Lo-fi music groups ",
