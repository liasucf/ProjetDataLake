It is situated in the civil parish of Waters Upton, a village to the north, and is 7 miles north-west of Telford. Nearby is the confluence of the rivers Tern and Strine; the village lies at an elevation of . ==History== Crudgington is mentioned in the Domesday Book, where it is called Crugetone. Its lord was Robert Butler, under Earl Roger, who had 1\u00bd hides of land under cultivation, one plough and three serfs. Also living there were nine villagers, two smallholders and a freeman with three ploughs. There were four fisheries here and it provided a payment of \u00a34 and 1000 eels. By 1269, the village had passed into the hands of Shrewsbury Abbey. In 1285, it is recorded as part of the manor of Slepe. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the village became part of the Lilleshall estate and their landlords, who later became the Dukes of Sutherland were responsible for building several of the houses in the village, including Leasowes Farm (dated 1817) and Tern Farm. ==Transport== On 16 October 1867, the Wellington and Market Drayton Railway line from Wellington to Market Drayton was opened, which included a station at Crudgington. However, lack of use forced the line to close to passenger traffic on 9 September 1963, and to freight four years later. The A442 road from Telford to Whitchurch and B5062 road from Newport to Shrewsbury cross at Crudgington. As well as private and commercial traffic, they are used by local bus services 341, 342, 519, 820, WR2 and WR3. ==Landmarks== The Dairy Crest Creamery at Crudgington, closed 2014 There was a large dairy factory and creamery in Crudgington. It was originally formed as a co-operative in the 1920s, then taken over in 1935 by the Milk Marketing Board and eventually operated under the Dairy Crest name, producing butter and Clover, Argento and Willow spreads, as well as Country Life Butter.Report by Emma Walker. The factory employed about 300 people in 2005. The plant was closed late in 2014, when production of the spreads was concentrated in Kirkby near Liverpool.
