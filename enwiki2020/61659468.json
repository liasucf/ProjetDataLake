The group have also performed \"I Don't Know What's Cool Anymore,\" on both the Danish and British versions of dance competition series Dancing with the Stars. In the week leading up to the album's release, Bramsen and SG, alongside guitarist Anders B\u00f8nlokke, appeared on both BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Radio 2, the latter of which saw them performing acoustic versions of both \"Shadows\" and \"Fascination.\" The trio also appeared on album review podcast Track By Track, discussing each song from the release with hosts Dan Bull and Will Warren.

Throughout February 2020, the group were due to play a series of headline shows in their native country, with a tour of the United Kingdom following in April 2020. In June 2020, the group were also due to play Fredagsrock, the Friday-night concert event at Copenhagen amusement park Tivoli, and the London music festival Mighty Hoopla. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, several of the band's 2020 dates have since been cancelled or rescheduled. In place of these cancelations, the group perfomed \"the only Alphabeat gig this Summer,\" a live-streamed concert atop the Radisson Collection Hotel, Royal Copenhagen on June 26. ==Critical reception== Initial reception to the album has been mostly positive, with celebrity culture website CelebMix calling the record \"a non- stop, popular musical masterpiece packed full of intelligent, well-crafted and well-produced perfect pop hits.\" Music and entertainment website Essentially Pop too praised the record, naming it \"a welcome breath of positivity in a worried world,\" whilst citing opening track \"Shadows\" as \"high energy, fun, and effusive.\" OK! gave the album 4/5 stars, claiming the listener \"won't be able to help hitting the dancefloor and throwing some old school shapes,\" whilst New! gave a similarly positive review, claiming the album was \"all killer, no filler.\" Review website Stereoboard too praised the record, noting that the album \"heralds a return to the more organic aesthetic of... \u2018This Is Alphabeat,\u2019\" and calling it a \"nine track gem;\" the website gave the release a 4/5 star rating. Music magazine Classic Pop was more critical, however, rating the album 4 stars. The publication praised the band's \"timeless radio-friendly euphoria\" but panned the short length of the album and the track \"Sing a Song.\" Nordic music fansite Scandipop praised \"Sing a Song,\" however, calling it \"brutally honest but tongue-in-cheek,\" whilst commending the record as a whole for being \"wall-to-wall, heart-on-its-sleeve, brilliant, unabashed pop.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Discogs listings of Don't Know What's Cool Anymore, unless otherwise cited.
