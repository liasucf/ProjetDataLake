    "text": "Langs de Vecht en d'oude Rijnstroom is the provincial anthem of Utrecht, Netherlands. Its text was written in 1952 by the provincial employee J. K\u00fcppers, on the melody of \"Angels from the Realms of Glory\" of the British 19th-century composer Henry Smart. ==Lyrics== ==English translation== Along the old Rhine stream Extends the Sticht land wide. Willibrord lit thy torch, Which quenchless burns further; Where the country's union was born, Utrecht, heart of Netherland! Utrecht, pearl of regions, I cherish thy forest and leisure ground, An own mark carries thy landscape: Puddle, river, or heath and sand, Meadow and orchard, bright varied, Utrecht, heart of Netherland! Utrecht, noble, diligent Utrecht, Midpoint to each side, To thy own style and beauty I keep pledged my word. Remaining in good and bad times: Utrecht, heart of Netherland!
