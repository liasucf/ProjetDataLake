    "text": "The Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches is an evangelical denomination in Australia. It consists of 38 congregations in every state except South Australia. Most of the churches were formed as church plants by clergy trained at Moore Theological College, but operating outside the Diocese of Sydney. Many of them do not have their own church buildings, and meet at local schools. The FIEC started in 2002, and has experienced significant growth. ==References== Category:Christian denominations in Australia Category:Religious organizations established in 2002 Category:2002 establishments in Australia Category:Evangelical denominations established in the 21st century ",
