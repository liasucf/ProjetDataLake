    "text": "Truppf\u00fchrer (, \"troop leader\") was a Nazi Party paramilitary rank that was first created in 1930 as a rank of the Sturmabteilung (SA). Translated as \"Troop Leader\", the rank of Truppf\u00fchrer evolved from early Freikorps titles which traced their origins to World War I. As an SA rank, Truppf\u00fchrer was considered the equivalent of a senior sergeant, or sergeant first class. The rank of SA-Truppf\u00fchrer was at first considered senior to that of SA- Scharf\u00fchrer, but after 1932 was ranked above the new rank of SA- Oberscharf\u00fchrer. The insignia for a basic Truppf\u00fchrer consisted of two button pips on a collar patch. A Truppf\u00fchrer normally served as the SA-non- commissioned officer of platoon sized SA-Truppen, formed into company sized SA-Sturm. The responsibilities of a Truppf\u00fchrer typically increased upon promotion to Obertruppf\u00fchrer and Haupttruppf\u00fchrer, as did the number of troops under the Truppf\u00fchrer\u2019s command. Between 1930 and 1934, Truppf\u00fchrer was also used as an SS rank but was abolished after the Night of the Long Knives when the rank of SS-Truppf\u00fchrer was renamed SS-Oberscharf\u00fchrer. {| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border- collapse: collapse; margin: 0.5em auto; clear: both;\" |- |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\"|Junior Rank Oberscharf\u00fchrer |width=\"40%\" align=\"center\"|SA rank Truppf\u00fchrer |width=\"30%\" align=\"center\"|Senior Rank Obertruppf\u00fchrer |} ==Insignia== File:NSFK-Truppf\u00fchrer.svg|NSFK File:NSKK- Truppf\u00fchrer.svg|NSKK File:OT-Truppf\u00fchrer.svg|OT File:RAD-Truppf\u00fchrer.svg|RAD File:SA-Truppf\u00fchrer.svg|SA == Notes == == Bibliography == * * Category:Nazi paramilitary ranks ",
