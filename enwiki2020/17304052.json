He studied medicine in Brno. Having been arrested by the Gestapo in November 1939, he was briefly imprisoned at Brno's \u0160pilberk Castle and subsequently deported to the Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg Nazi concentration camp. As a doctor he was active at the ear, nose and throat (otolaryngology) clinics in Brno, Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, and the Central Military Hospital in Prague. He was named associate professor (1951) and full professor (1965) of Charles University in Prague. Erv\u00edn \u010cern\u00fd lived in Prague but visited Podom\u00ed several times every year. He died on July 30, 2001 after a traffic accident. ==Medicine== Erv\u00edn \u010cern\u00fd devoted himself mainly to the surgical treatment of ear, nose and throat health conditions. He delivered hundreds of lectures in and outside his homeland, and published 194 scientific papers, including an Atlas of Ear Surgery and Atlas of Throat Surgery, with his own illustrations. He was the honorary member of many Czechoslovak and international scientific organizations and his many international awards included the Czech Medical Society's Jan Evangelista Purkyn\u011b Prize, on the occasion of his 85th birthday. ==Historical geography== Erv\u00edn \u010cern\u00fd was also a prominent scientist in the field of historical geography. Over 40 years of scientific endeavour in this field he explored a territory of over 600 square kilometres of his native Drahany Upland (Drahansk\u00e1 vrchovina) to discover 62 decayed medieval settlements including their forest areas.\u010cern\u00fd, Erv\u00edn. V\u00fdsledky v\u00fdzkumu zanikl\u00fdch st\u0159edov\u011bk\u00fdch osad a jejich plu\u017ein: historicko- geografick\u00e1 studie v regionu Drahansk\u00e9 vrchoviny. 1st edition. Brno: Muzejn\u00ed a vlastiv\u011bdn\u00e1 spole\u010dnost, 1992, 143 p. Vlastiv\u011bdn\u00e1 knihovna moravsk\u00e1, vol. 74. . He published more than 70 scientific papers in this field, and six of them were released in book form. He dedicated his book of epical poems, Zelen\u00fd barv\u00ednek, to his native region. He spent many years painstakingly collecting information about the history of his native village. In 1999 he presented Podom\u00ed with his detailed Chronicle to mark 650 years of the municipality. ==Barv\u00ednek== In 1997, \u010cern\u00fd greeted an initiative of several citizens of the microregion (comprising the communities of Podom\u00ed, Kr\u00e1sensko, Ruprechtov and Senet\u00e1\u0159ov) and helped to establish a civic association for the advancement of extracurricular education of children and young people. He was delighted by the proposal to call the new association \u201cBarv\u00ednek\u201d as a token of appreciation by his fellow citizens. \u201cBarv\u00ednek\u201d stood in good stead to \u010cern\u00fd in the reclamation of a local well, and worked to edit the Podom\u00ed Chronicles and to organize an exhibition on his life and scientific as well as artistic endeavours. Together, they published the book \"The Drahany Upland\" and staked out an educational hiking trail of the same name (with five information desks). Barv\u00ednek activists helped \u010cern\u00fd in his late years with the archeological research of decayed settlements and organized his lectures and public meetings. ==References== Category:1913 births Category:2001 deaths Category:People from Vy\u0161kov District Category:Czech scientists Category:Czech otolaryngologists Category:Czech archaeologists Category:20th-century archaeologists Category:20th-century surgeons ",
