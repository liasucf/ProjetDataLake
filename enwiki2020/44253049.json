    "text": "Bobby & Co. was a provincial department store group based mainly in seaside towns on the south coast of England. The business operated from 1887 until 1972. ==Early history== In 1887, Frederick James Bobby (1860-1941) bought an established drapery store in Margate, Kent, located on the corner of High Street and Queen Street. The business grew to incorporate several neighbouring premises. In 1900, the business was incorporated and an expansion programme was begun, opening stores in specially selected towns, mostly seaside resorts. Stores were opened in Leamington Spa (1890), Folkestone (formerly C J Saunders; purchased 1906), Eastbourne (formerly Strange & Atkinson; new extension 1911), Torquay (formerly Robert Thomas Knight; expanded 1921 with the purchase of Iredales), Cliftonville, Bournemouth (1915), Exeter (formerly Green & Son, acquired 1922) and Southport. In the 1920s the business employed the artist F Gregory Brown to design a number of advertisement posters, which were printed by Bobby's own print shop and displayed in railway stations. Brown was also employed, at the same time, by Kensington department store Derry & Toms. ==1927-1972== Frederick Bobby retired from the business in 1927, selling his shares to a recently formed retail conglomerate, the Drapery Trust. The Bobby & Co. group was run as a separate entity within the trust, chaired by Frederick Bobby's son. The company was funded to further expand, incorporating the Bristol department store of John Cordeux & Son (renamed Bobby & Co.) in 1928. The Margate store was refurbished in 1937. The Debenhams group had emerged from the Drapery Trust by the 1950s. By this time the Bobby & Co. subsidiary had expanded to include Dusts of Tunbridge Wells, Handleys of Southsea, Haymans of Totnes, Hills of Hove, Hubbards of Worthing, Simes of Worcester, Taylors of Bristol and Wellsteeds of Reading. In the early 1970s the decision was taken by the Debenhams board to rationalise the entire group and bring the majority of their department stores under the Debenhams brand. The stores in Margate and Cliftonville were closed in 1972, while all other stores trading under the Bobby's name were rebranded as Debenhams. As of 2019, the stores still trading are Bournemouth, Torquay, Eastbourne (Closing 2020), Folkestone (Closing 2020), Southsea (Closing 2020), Worthing and Worcester. ==References== Category:Retail companies established in 1887 Category:Debenhams Category:Defunct department stores of the United Kingdom Category:Defunct retail companies of the United Kingdom Category:Margate Category:1887 establishments in England Category:Retail companies disestablished in 1972 Category:1972 disestablishments in England ",
