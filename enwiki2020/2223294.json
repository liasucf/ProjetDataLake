    "text": "Goodnight Vienna is the fourth studio album by Ringo Starr. It was recorded in the summer of 1974 in Los Angeles, and released later that year. Goodnight Vienna followed the commercially successful predecessor Ringo, and Starr used many of the same players, including Billy Preston, Klaus Voormann, Robbie Robertson, Harry Nilsson, and producer Richard Perry. The title is a Liverpool slang phrase meaning \"it's all over\". ==Background and recording== While all three other former Beatles had contributed to Ringo (1973), only John Lennon contributed to Goodnight Vienna. On 17 June 1974, Starr called Lennon, who was about to record his Walls and Bridges album, and asked him to write a song he could include on his next album. Lennon wrote what became the title track, \"Goodnight Vienna\". A demo of \"(It's All Down to) Goodnight Vienna\" was recorded by Lennon on 28 June, with the session musicians from Walls & Bridges and sent to Starr in advance of the sessions. Besides writing and playing piano on the title track, Lennon suggested Starr cover The Platters' hit \"Only You (And You Alone)\" playing acoustic guitar and providing a guide vocal for Starr to follow. Starr's versions of both \"Only You (And You Alone)\" and \"(It's All Down to) Goodnight Vienna\" were recorded at a session produced by Lennon. Elton John also contributed a track, \"Snookeroo\", co-written with Bernie Taupin. Harry Nilsson gave Starr the track \"Easy for Me\", which he later recorded his own version of for his Duit on Mon Dei album. ==Release== \"Only You (And You Alone)\", backed with \"Call Me\", was issued as an advance single from the album in the US on 11 November 1974, before the album was released. In the US the song reached number 8 on the US charts. Goodnight Vienna was released on the same day as the \"Only You (And You Alone)\" single in the UK on 15 November. The album reached only number 30 in the UK, and would be Starr's last chart album in his homeland until 1998. The album was released in the US on 18 November, and peaked at number 8, ultimately going gold, and its reviews were generally favourable. It was also originally released in quadrophonic. A promo film for \"Only You (And You Alone)\" was aired on Top of the Pops on 19 December. On 27 January 1975, \"No No Song\", backed with \"Snookeroo\", was released in the US, reaching number 3. Nearly a month later, on 21 February, \"Snookeroo\" was released as a single in the UK, backed with \"Oo-Wee\". On 2 June, a special edit of \"(It's All Down to) Goodnight Vienna\" and \"Goodnight Vienna (Reprise)\" was released as a single, backed with an edit of \"Oo-Wee\", in the US. The cover artwork for Goodnight Vienna was based on a still from the classic science fiction film The Day the Earth Stood Still, with Starr's head replacing that of actor Michael Rennie. Rennie's character was the alien Klaatu. A television commercial, which featured a voiceover from Lennon, depicted the cover's flying saucer (with Starr) over Los Angeles\u2014landing on the roof of the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. The commercial was produced by Vidtronics Company Inc. Starr returned the favour and did the voiceover for the commercial for Lennon's Walls and Bridges album. Immediately after filming the commercial, on 14 November 1974, the promo film for \"Only You (And You Alone)\" was filmed. During the video Starr and Nilsson mimed to the song, on top of the Capitol Records building. The video aired on BBC TV's Top of the Pops show, on 19 December. Goodnight Vienna was reissued in the US, this time by Capitol in February 1981. The album was remastered and reissued on CD on 30 November 1992 in the UK, and on 23 March 1993 in the US, with three bonus tracks: 1972 hit single \"Back Off Boogaloo\", its B-Side \"Blindman\" and an extended version of the McCartney-penned \"Six O'Clock\", a shorter version of which had earlier appeared on the LP version of Ringo. ==Track listing== * Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1\u201311 on CD reissues. ==Personnel== * Ringo Starr \u2013 lead vocals, drums, percussion * Jim Keltner \u2013 drums * John Lennon \u2013 piano, acoustic guitar, backing vocals * Richard Bennett \u2013 electric guitar * Dennis Coffey \u2013 guitars * Steve Cropper \u2013 electric guitar * Jesse Ed Davis \u2013 electric guitar * Vini Poncia \u2013 acoustic guitar, backing vocals * Robbie Robertson \u2013 guitars * Alvin Robinson \u2013 guitars * Lon Van Eaton \u2013 guitars * Dr. John \u2013 piano, backing vocals * Elton John \u2013 piano * David Foster \u2013 piano * Tom Hensley \u2013 keyboards * Nicky Hopkins \u2013 piano * Lincoln Mayorga \u2013 piano * Billy Preston \u2013 piano, clavinet * James Newton Howard \u2013 synthesizer * Gary Wright \u2013 keyboards * Klaus Voormann \u2013 bass guitar * Richard Perry \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals * Chuck Findley \u2013 horns * Bobby Keys \u2013 horns * Trevor Lawrence \u2013 horns * Steve Madaio \u2013 horns * Lew McCreary \u2013 horns * Madeline Bell \u2013 backing vocals * Lesley Duncan \u2013 backing vocals * Bill Wyman \u2013 backing vocals * Jimmy Gilstrap \u2013 backing vocals * Joe Greene \u2013 backing vocals * Ira Hawkins \u2013 backing vocals * Clydie King \u2013 backing vocals * Linda Lawrence \u2013 backing vocals * Harry Nilsson \u2013 backing vocals * May Pang \u2013 backing vocals * Masst Alberts \u2013 backing vocals * Derrek Van Eaton \u2013 backing vocals * Cynthia Webb \u2013 backing vocals ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Chart (1974\u201375) !Position |- |align=\"left\"|Australian Kent Music Report |11 |- |align=\"left\"|Austrian Albums Chart |8 |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Albums ChartLibrary and Archives Canada.
