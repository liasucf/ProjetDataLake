    "text": "Yvan Delporte (24 June 1928 \u2013 5 March 2007) was a Belgian comics writer, and was editor-in-chief of Spirou magazine between 1955 and 1968 during a period considered by many the golden age of Franco-Belgian comics. He is credited with several creative contributions, among these his collaborations with Peyo on The Smurfs, with Ren\u00e9 Follet on Steve Severin (1/2) and Andr\u00e9 Franquin with the creation of Gaston Lagaffe and the co-authorship of Id\u00e9es noires. ==Biography== Delporte started at Spirou at the age of 17. Where his first job was to retouch the cleavage in American comics which at the time were considered excessively lewd. He handled other odd jobs, and over time touched upon a great deal of different occupations within the comics industry. In 1955, upon becoming editor-in-chief of Spirou in place of Charles Dupuis, a long-lasting collaboration with Franquin began, which would spawn many creations. ==References== * Delporte publications dans Le journal de Spirou BDoubli\u00e9es * Delporte albums Bedetheque ;Footnotes ==Further reading== *Yvan Delporte, R\u00e9acteur en chef, by Christelle & Bertrand Pissavy-Yvernault, Dupuis, September 2009 ==External links== *Yvan Delporte biography on Lambiek Comiclopedia *Yvan Delporte biography on Dupuis Category:1928 births Category:2007 deaths Category:People from Brussels Category:Belgian comics writers Category:Belgian editors Category:Belgian humorists Category:Comic book editors ",
