    "text": "The Land District of Queanbeyan was one of the around 100 land districts of New South Wales which were introduced with the Crown Lands Act of 1884. It was based around the town of Queanbeyan, and included the area from near Lake George in the north, to Colinton in the south, and west to the Goodradigbee River and beyond it. In 1909, a large part of the district was transferred to the Commonwealth government to become the Australian Capital Territory. The district was located in the Eastern Division, and included land in the counties of Murray and Cowley, and a small part of Buccleuch. In 1890 the district was part of the Cooma Land Board.Map of New South Wales shewing all divisions for the purposes of the Crown Lands Acts, 1890.
