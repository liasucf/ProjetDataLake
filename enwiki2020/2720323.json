Despite the talent on the team, the Iran U-23 team did not qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics. Around the same time he was called up to the Team Melli, where he scored some crucial goals, such as the tying goal versus Qatar in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match. He was not a regular starter for the team, but he was among Iran's final squad for 2006 FIFA World Cup. In November 2006, he once again joined Iran U-23 team to participate at the 2006 Asian Games. In the quarter-final match against China, Borhani held the ball short of the goal line and invited his teammates to approach after masterfully dribbling around the Chinese goalkeeper. He held that position for a few seconds before moving the ball over the line and then started running with joy towards the bench and celebrating with others. Later on he apologized for dishonoring the China U-23 team. He was called up to the national squad by Iranian coach Ali Daei to play in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 AFC Third Round. He also played in 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification for Team Melli. ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Iran's goal tally first. {| class=wikitable !#!!Date!!Venue!!Opponent!!Score!!Result!!Competition |- |1||21 June 2004||Azadi Stadium, Tehran||||3\u20130||7\u20131||2004 WAFF |- | 2||21 June 2004||Azadi Stadium, Tehran||||4\u20130||7\u20131||2004 WAFF |- |3||23 June 2004||Azadi Stadium, Tehran||||2\u20131||2\u20131||2004 WAFF |- |4||25 June 2004||Azadi Stadium, Tehran||||3\u20131||4\u20131||2004 WAFF |- |5||9 October 2004||Khalifa International Stadium, Doha||||2\u20132||3\u20132||2006 WCQ |- |6||17 November 2004||Azadi Stadium, Tehran||||6\u20130||7\u20130||2006 WCQ |- |7||2 February 2005||Azadi Stadium, Tehran||||2\u20131||2\u20131||Friendly |- |8||28 May 2006||Gradski Vrt Stadium, Osijek||||2\u20131||2\u20132||Friendly |- |9||2 January 2009||Azadi Stadium, Tehran||||1\u20130||3\u20131||Friendly |- |10||12 August 2009||Asim Ferhatovi\u0107 Hase Stadium, Sarajevo||||2\u20132||3\u20132||Friendly |- |} ==Honours== Borhani after winning the 2012\u201313 season with Esteghlal ===Club=== ;Pas Tehran *Iran Pro League (1): 2003\u201304 ;Esteghlal *Iran Pro League (2): 2008\u201309, 2012\u201313 *Hazfi Cup (2): 2007\u201308, 2011\u201312 ===Country=== *WAFF Championship (1): 2004 ===Individual=== *Iran Pro League top goalscorer (1): 2008\u201309 ==References== ==External links== *Arash Borhani at PersianLeague.com *Arash Borhani at TeamMelli.com * *Borhani's goal in the 2006 Asian Games quarterfinals \u2013 from YouTube Category:Iranian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Pas players Category:2004 AFC Asian Cup players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:Esteghlal F.C. players Category:Iranian expatriate footballers Category:People from Kerman Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Iran international footballers Category:Al-Nasr SC (Dubai) players Category:Asian Games bronze medalists for Iran Category:Asian Games medalists in football Category:Footballers at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 2006 Asian Games Category:UAE Pro League players Category:Persian Gulf Pro League players Category:People from Kerman Province ",
