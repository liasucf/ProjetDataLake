The lane running into the village from Wistanstow is a Roman road, which ran between the Roman settlements and forts at Leintwardine and Wroxeter. The present day lane turns a sharp corner (to the east and the A49) off this ancient route and this is known as The Corner. Category:Hamlets in Shropshire ",
