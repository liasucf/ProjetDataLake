    "text": "Walk the Line is a 1992 album released by former Supremes member Mary Wilson on the independent CEO Records label. The album was Wilson's first solo album to be released since her debut album, Mary Wilson, in 1979 on Motown Records. Wilson had begun work on a second solo album in 1980, working with English record producer, Gus Dudgeon. Dudgeon had produced 4 tracks for the album but Motown dropped Wilson from the label before the album was completed. After leaving Motown, Wilson almost signed with Atlantic Records in 1987 but the label cancelled on the deal. In 1990, Wilson signed with Nightmare Records (which later turned into Motorcity Records). Wilson recorded and released her cover version of the Five Stairsteps's classic hit \"Ooh Child\" on the Motorcity label but never recorded a full album for the label. A year later, Wilson signed with CEO Records and released Walk the Line in 1992. A day after Walk the Line was released, CEO went into bankruptcy. Wilson later claimed that she had no knowledge of the label's financial troubles and stated that she was coerced into signing with them for the release. Because of the bankruptcy issue with the label, Walk the Line fell out of place on the Billboard charts despite Wilson's promotion efforts. It features covers of \"Ooh Child\" and Jennifer Holliday's song \"I Am Changing\" from the original Dreamgirls broadway play. During the recording sessions, Wilson recorded an updated version of The Supremes' #1 single \"Love Child\", complete with vocal rap (the background track was the same one as used by Sweet Sensation on their 1990 cover of the song). This track was however replaced in favor of another Supremes #1 hit, \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\". On September 11, 2013, the album's title track, \"Walk the Line\", was released to Wilson's iTunes page. ==Track listing== # \"Walk the Line\" (4:00) # \"The Stare\" (3:08) # \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" (3:48) # \"One Night With You\" (3:44) # \"All Over Now\" (3:44) # \"Ooh Child\" (4:35) # \"Under Any Moon\" (4:12) # \"Shelter Me\" (3:17) # \"Bodyguard\" (3:27) # \"I Am Changing\" (3:45) ==References== Category:1992 albums Category:Mary Wilson (singer) albums ",
