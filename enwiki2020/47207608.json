They have been signed to Victory Records since 2012, and have toured with acts including The Ghost Inside, Emmure, Comeback Kid, Defeater and All Shall Perish. ==History== Formed in 2010, Continents made a name for themselves within the UK music scene. After signing to Victory Records in June 2012 the band departed on a five-country tour in support of their debut album Idle Hands, being released on 23 January 2013, was met with extremely positive reviews. Helen Catchpowle from Rock Sound gave the album 8/10, exclaiming: 'Launching into the fray with its tinnitus-inducing title track, Continents' first album sees the Welsh five- piece easily living up to high expectations set by their riotous set at last year\u2019s Ghostfest. Fast cementing their place as serious contenders on the UK hardcore scene, the band\u2019s apparently limitless energy translates effortlessly into a record that\u2019s as raw as it is powerful, with ferocious vocals from frontman Phil Cross leading the relentless onslaught. With lead single powerhouse \u2018Trails\u2019 already attracting an impressive following, Continents\u2019 reputation looks set to rocket on the merit of this solid debut effort. While Rhian Westbury from Bring The Noise UK gave the album a 9/10, stating: 'Pegasus, Pegasus is where the band come into their own, from the opening massive riffs to the closing screams you won\u2019t be able to sit still. You might even find yourself jumping up and down and fist pumping in your living room. It\u2019s okay, no one\u2019s watching!' In early 2015, the band announced that they had entered the studio to begin recording their next album, Reprisal and the album was released on Halloween in the same year. In February 2019, the band announced they would be disbanding, with their final show taking place on 10 April. ==Members== Final lineup * Phil Cross \u2013 Vocals (2010\u20132019) * Darryl Sweet \u2013 Guitar (2010\u20132019) * Rhys Griffiths \u2013 Guitar, vocals (2010\u20132019) * Timothy Vincent \u2013 Bass (2017\u20132019) * Scott Waters \u2013 Drums (2017\u20132019) Former members * Tom Weaver \u2013 Guitar (2010\u20132013) * Matt Reece \u2013 Drums (2010\u20132011) * Dom Turner \u2013 Bass (2010\u20132017) * Duncan \"Ken\" Hamill \u2013 Drums (2011\u20132017) ==Discography== === Studio albums === * Idle Hands (2013) * Reprisal (2015) === Singles === * \"Trials\" (2011) ==References== ==External links== *Continents at Victory Records Category:British hardcore punk groups Category:Welsh heavy metal musical groups Category:Victory Records artists ",
