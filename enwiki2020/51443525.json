He received Ph.D. in 1998 under the supervision of Alexei Bondal. Kuznetsov is known for his research in algebraic geometry, mostly concerning derived categories of coherent sheaves and their semiorthogonal decompositions. Kuznetsov received an August M\u00f6bius fellowship in 1997. He was awarded a European Mathematical Society prize in 2008. He was an invited speaker at the International Mathematical Congress in Seoul (2014). Kuznetsov is a Professor of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), corresponding member of the RAS (elected in 2016). ==Selected publications== * Homological projective duality, Publications Mathematiques de L\u2019IHES, 105, n. 1 (2007), 157-220. * Base change for semiorthogonal decompositions, Compositio Mathematica, V. 147 (2011) N. 3, 852\u2013876. * Derived categories of Fano threefolds, Proc.
