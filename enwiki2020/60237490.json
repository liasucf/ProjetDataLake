Progreso. ==Club career== Mieres' career began in his homeland with Defensor Sporting of the Primera Divisi\u00f3n. He made his bow on 25 April against Montevideo Wanderers, which turned out to be his sole match for the club. Mieres spend the 2010\u201311 season out on loan with Rentistas, featuring twelve times. Brazil's Toledo completed the loan signing of Mieres on 9 January 2013. He scored on his starting debut in the Campeonato Paranaense, netting the winner in a 2\u20131 victory over Arapongas in March. A total of eight appearances arrived with Toledo. He returned to Uruguay later that year, subsequently joining top-flight Sud Am\u00e9rica. Having scored one goal in thirteen fixtures for Sud Am\u00e9rica in the 2013\u201314 season, Mieres was loaned to Ecuadorian Serie A team Deportivo Cuenca in January 2014. Twelve months later, Primera B Nacional's Atl\u00e9tico Tucum\u00e1n of Argentina done likewise. He played full seasons for both sides, scoring against Liga de Loja and Sportivo Belgrano respectively, as he notably won the league title, and subsequent promotion, with Atl\u00e9tico Tucum\u00e1n. Mieres went back to Uruguay in early 2016 with Sud Am\u00e9rica, but soon sealed a return to Argentina after agreeing a move to Central C\u00f3rdoba in July. Central C\u00f3rdoba suffered relegation from the 2016\u201317 Primera B Nacional, though Mieres stayed in the second tier after being signed by Quilmes - a team just relegated from the Primera Divisi\u00f3n. A sixty-two minute appearance against Juventud Unida was the defender's only feature in the 2017\u201318 campaign, after suffering a knee ligament injury in the match. ==International career== Mieres was selected by Uruguay for the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Egypt, though didn't make an appearance as they were eliminated in the round of sixteen by Brazil. A year previous, Mieres was selected for the L'Alc\u00fadia International Tournament. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Defensor Sporting |2009\u201310 |rowspan=\"3\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |2010\u201311 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2011\u201312 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Rentistas (loan) |2010\u201311 |rowspan=\"1\"|Segunda Divisi\u00f3n |12||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||12||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Central Espa\u00f1ol |2012\u201313 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |10||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||10||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Toledo (loan) |2013 |rowspan=\"1\"|Campeonato Paranaense |colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||8||1||8||1 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Sud Am\u00e9rica |2013\u201314 |rowspan=\"3\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |13||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||13||1 |- |2014\u201315 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2015\u201316 |3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||3||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !16!!1!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!16!!1 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Deportivo Cuenca (loan) |2014 |rowspan=\"1\"|Serie A |34||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||34||1 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Atl\u00e9tico Tucum\u00e1n (loan) |2015 |rowspan=\"4\"|Primera B Nacional |16||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||17||1 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Central C\u00f3rdoba |2016\u201317 |39||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||40||2 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Quilmes |2017\u201318 |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |2018\u201319 |7||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||7||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !8!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!8!!0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !136!!5!!2!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!138!!5 |} ==Honours== ;Rentistas *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n: 2010\u201311 ;Atl\u00e9tico Tucum\u00e1n *Primera B Nacional: 2015 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Paysand\u00fa Category:Uruguayan footballers Category:Uruguay youth international footballers Category:Uruguay under-20 international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Uruguayan expatriate footballers Category:Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Uruguayan Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Ecuadorian Serie A players Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Defensor Sporting players Category:C.A.
