    "text": "The beach soccer tournaments at the 2019 World Beach Games, the inaugural edition of the Games, were held from 11 to 16 October 2019 in Doha, Qatar and organised by the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC). The matches were hosted on Katara Beach at two venues which comprised the Beach Soccer Arena. Two events took place: the men's tournament and the women's tournament. A total of 24 teams participated (16 in the men's competition and eight in the women's). The men's squads could consist of up to 12 players and the women's squads, 10 players, meaning a total of 272 athletes were expected to take part. Brazil claimed the men's title whilst Spain were the winners of the women's category. ==Competition schedule== The tournament began one day before the opening ceremony with medal-deciding matches taking place exclusively on 16 October. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:90%; line-height:1.25em; text-align:center\" |- |bgcolor=\"#FFBBBB\"|G||Group stage |bgcolor=\"#BBF3BB\"|SF||Semi-finals |bgcolor=\"#FEDCBA\"|B||Bronze medal match |bgcolor=\"#FFFFBB\"|F||Final / Gold medal match |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:90%; line-height:1.25em; text-align:center\" ! || Fri 11 || Sat 12 || Sun 13 || Mon 14 || Tue 15 || colspan=2|Wed 16 |- | align=\"left\"| Men || bgcolor=\"#FFBBBB\"|G || ||bgcolor=\"#FFBBBB\"|G || bgcolor=\"#FFBBBB\"|G || bgcolor=\"#BBF3BB\"|SF || bgcolor=\"#FEDCBA\"|B || bgcolor=\"#FFFFBB\"|F |- | align=\"left\"| Women || bgcolor=\"#FFBBBB\"|G || ||bgcolor=\"#FFBBBB\"|G || bgcolor=\"#FFBBBB\"|G || bgcolor=\"#BBF3BB\"|SF || bgcolor=\"#FEDCBA\"|B || bgcolor=\"#FFFFBB\"|F |} ==Qualification== Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) was allowed to enter one men's team and one women's team into the competition. In order to play at the Games, these teams needed to qualify. The six continental confederations of FIFA were each allocated a certain amount of berths at the Games; qualification events were organised for teams to compete against other members of their own confederation to try and earn one of their continent's spots at the Games. ANOC delegated the responsibility of organising qualification to Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW). Originally, qualification tournaments were planned for all confederations, however, for some, these qualification events were ultimately not realised \u2013 instead, their teams which occupied the highest positions in the BSWW World Ranking were granted qualification. The host country qualifies automatically. When San Diego relinquished the hosting rights to Doha, the United States was stripped of its entitlement to automatic qualification for its men's and women's teams. New hosts, Qatar, declined to enter any teams, leaving the berths reserved for the host nations unfilled; consequently, these vacant berths were redistributed accordingly. ===Men's qualification=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=1050 |- !width=40%|Means of qualification !Ref. !width=20%|Dates !width=20%|Venue !Berths !width=20%|Qualified |- |2019 UEFA Qualifying Tournament | |9\u201312 May 2019 | Salou |align=center|5 | |- |2019 African Beach Games | |19\u201323 June 2019 | Sal |align=center|2 | |- |BSWW World Ranking (Top ranked AFC teams) | |10 July 2019 |\u2013 |align=center|3 | |- |BSWW World Ranking (Top ranked OFC team) | |10 July 2019 |\u2013 |align=center|1 |[a] |- |2019 CONCACAF Qualifying Tournament | |3\u20135 August 2019 | San Salvador |align=center|2 | |- |BSWW World Ranking (Top ranked CONMEBOL teams) | |23 August 2019 |\u2013 |align=center|3 | |- !Total ! !colspan=2| !16 ! |} : a. Tahiti are the highest ranked team from the OFC. However, they are ineligible to enter since French Polynesia is not a member of ANOC.

With the exception of UEFA, all confederations were originally allocated one berth each. However, neither the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) nor Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) ultimately entered any teams (China were due to enter a team as the AFC representative but withdrew). Therefore, these two vacant berths were redistributed, with CONMEBOL and CONCACAF each receiving one extra berth. : c. Competed in qualification as England. England does not have an independent NOC and is instead represented by Great Britain at Olympic events. ==Participating NOCs== A total of 19 National Olympic Committees (NOCs), as per the outcome of qualification events, participated (the number of participating athletes of each NOC are shown in parentheses). * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==Men's competition== ==Women's competition== ==Medal summary== ===Medal table=== ===Medalists=== {| |- |Men's tournament | M\u00e3o Rafinha Ant\u00f4nio Catarino Filipe Silva Luc\u00e3o Bokinha Rodrigo Souto Rodrigo Dati\u00f1ha Mauricinho Rafael Padilha | Ivan Ostrovskii Andrey Novikov Aleksey Makarov Yuri Krasheninnikov Dmitry Shishin Anton Shkarin Aleksei Pavlenko Artur Paporotnyi Kirill Romanov Pavel Bazhenov Boris Nikonorov Fedor Zemskov | Peyman Hosseini Amir Akbari Hassan Abdollahi Mostafa Kiani Mehdi Shirmohammadi Ali Mirshekari Mohammad Mokhtari Mohammad Ahmadzadeh Hamid Behzadpour Saeid Piramoun Hadi Farahmand Mohammad Masoumizadeh |- | | Laura Gallego Andrea Mir\u00f3n Carmen Fresneda Lorena Asensio Alba Mellado Sara Goz\u00e1lez Carolina Goz\u00e1lez Jessica Higueras Carla Morera Laia Garc\u00eda | Hannah Haughton Katie James Nadine Bazan Hannah Short Wendy Martin Sarah Kempson Rebecca Barron Gemma Hillier Molly Clark Charlotte Haynes | Natalie Wippel Adriele Rocha Jasna Nagel Nayara Couto B\u00e1rbara Colodetti Noele Bastos Lorena Medeiros Let\u00edcia Villar Dani Barboza Let\u00edcia Lopes |} ==See also== *2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup *Beach soccer at the 2019 European Games ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Beach Soccer, at ANOC World Beach Games Qatar (official website) *World Beach Games 2019, at Beach Soccer Worldwide *World Beach Games 2019, at Beach Soccer Russia (in Russian) *Results book World Beach Games Beach soccer 2019 2019 ",
