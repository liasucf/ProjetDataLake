Cf. p.127. \"Under the 'stop-and- examine' rule, he applied the brake and the train halted perhaps half a mile further on\". was a United Kingdom Rulebook rule on the former British Railways. It required train crews to stop a train and investigate the cause if they became aware of any unusual conditions that might endanger the train . The Stop and Examine rule was made defunct after railway privatisation, when the modular format rulebook was introduced. Rules are no longer given names, but instead are referred to by their location in the rulebook. In this instance it is Module TW1 (Preparation and movement of trains)\u2014which states: ==Accidents== In the Norton Fitzwarren rail crash (1940), the stop and examine rule was applied, but no problem found. ==See also== * Stop and Examine is a column by Pip Dunn in the monthly magazine \"Railways Illustrated\" and also the back-page column in the fortnightly magazine \"RAIL\", usually written by the editor. * Glossary of United Kingdom railway terminology == References == == Further reading == * The Pacific Reporter, Volume 146, West Publishing Company, 1915.
