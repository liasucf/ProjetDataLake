    "text": "The following is an incomplete list of paintings by Pieter de Hooch that are generally accepted as autograph by Peter C. Sutton and other sources. The list is more or less in order of creation, starting from around 1648 when Pieter de Hooch began painting on his own in Delft. Later he moved to Amsterdam and his interiors seem somewhat grander in style. Most of his works are genre scenes involving daily life, but he also made at least one religious allegory. {| class='wikitable sortable' style='width:100%' !Image !Title !Year !Size !Inventory nr. !Gallery !Location |- | 128px | Self-portrait | 1648 | 32.5 \u00d7 34 cm | SK-A-181 | Rijksmuseum | Amsterdam |- | 128px | The Merry Drinker | 1650 | 50 \u00d7 42 cm | B33 | Gem\u00e4ldegalerie | Berlin |- | 128px | Two Soldiers and a Serving Woman with a Trumpeter | 1650\u20131655 | 76 \u00d7 66 cm | | Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich | Zurich |- | 128px | Soldier Offering a Woman a Glass of Wine | \u0441. 1653 | 71 \u00d7 69 cm | \u0413\u042d-6316 | Hermitage Museum | St. Petersburg |- | 128px | Two soldiers drinking with a serving woman | 1650\u20131655 | 52 \u00d7 46 cm | | private collection | unknown |- | 128px | Liberation of St. Peter from prison | 1650\u20131655 | 30.5 cm \u00d7 37.5 cm | | private collection | unknown |- | 128px | A soldier smoking a pipe | 1650 | 34.7 \u00d7 27 cm | 499 | Philadelphia Museum of Art | Philadelphia |- | 128px | Woman with basket of beans in the kitchen garden | 1651 | 69.5 \u00d7 59 cm | | Kunstmuseum Basel | Basel |- | 128px | Tric- Trac players | 1652\u20131655 | 45 \u00d7 33.5 cm | NGI.322 | National Gallery of Ireland | Dublin |- | 128px | Tavern interior with a seated soldier, seen from behind, with a serving woman, figures playing cards in the background | 1652\u20131655 | 42.7 \u00d7 33.5 cm | | private collection | unknown |- | 128px | Soldiers with a Serving Maid in a Barn | 1650s | 54.8 \u00d7 69.1 cm | 498 | Philadelphia Museum of Art | Philadelphia |- | 128px | The empty glass | 1652 | 44 \u00d7 35 cm | 2499 (OK) | Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen | Rotterdam |- | 128px | Soldiers with a serving woman and a flute player | 1650\u20131655 | 60 \u00d7 73 cm | 269 | Galleria Borghese | Rome |- | 128px | Two soldiers with a serving woman and a boy in a tavern | 1650\u20131655 | 49 \u00d7 50 cm | | private collection | unknown |- | 128px | Bringer of Bad News | 1655 | 68 \u00d7 56 cm | 065005-000 | Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya | Barcelona |- | 128px | Soldier with maid and cardplayers in a tavern | 1655 | 58 \u00d7 71 cm | WRM 2841 | Wallraf-Richartz Museum | Cologne |- | 128px | The Morning of a Young Man | 1655\u20131657 | 40 \u00d7 53 cm | \u0416-2621 | Pushkin Museum | Moscow |- | 128px | A Man with Dead Birds, and Other Figures, in a Stable | 1655 | 53.5 \u00d7 49.7 cm | NG3881 | National Gallery | London |- | 128px | Interior with a woman and a child;
