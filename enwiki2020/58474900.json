From June 1944 to April 1945, she was the head doctor of the M\u00fchldorf subcamp. Flocken banned medical means to prisoners, limiting also the number of prisoners in camp hospitals. She also disregarded the poor sanitary conditions in M\u00fchldorf. Flocken participated in the selection of prisoners who were later transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau for gassing. Flocken was tried in the M\u00fchldorf trial by the American Military Tribunal in Dachau. She was sentenced to death by hanging for war crimes and crimes against humanity. However, the verdict was later changed to a life sentence. She was released from prison in Landsberg on April 29, 1957.Review and Recommendations \u2013 United States of America v.
