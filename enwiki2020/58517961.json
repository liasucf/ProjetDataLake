Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the Games have been postponed to 23 July to 8 August 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be the nation's twenty-second appearance at the Summer Olympics, having attended in every edition, either in its own right or as part of a Great Britain and Ireland team before 1924, with the exception of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany. ==Boxing== Ireland entered one male boxer into the Olympic tournament.

A team of jumping riders was added to the Irish equestrian squad by winning the gold medal at the FEI Nations Cup Final in Barcelona, Spain.

On 11 June 2020, the Irish Sailing Association decided to forego the domestic selection trials for the women's Laser Radial class because of the worldwide pandemic. Instead, Rio 2016 silver medalist Annalise Murphy was officially nominated to the Irish roster for her third straight Games, after finishing twelfth, as the country's top-ranked sailor, at the class-associated Worlds in Melbourne, Australia four months earlier. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=11|Race !rowspan=2|Net points !rowspan=2|Final rank |- style=\"font- size:95%\" !1 !2 !3 !4 !5 !6 !7 !8 !9 !10 !M* |- align=center |align=left|Annalise Murphy |align=left|Women's Laser Radial | | | | | | | | | | | | | |} M = Medal race; EL = Eliminated \u2013 did not advance into the medal race ==Swimming == Irish swimmers further achieved qualifying standards in the following events, up to a maximum of 2 swimmers in each event at the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT), and potentially 1 at the Olympic Selection Time (OST): {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Darragh Greene |align=left|Men's 100 m breaststroke | | | | | | |-align=center |align=left|Men's 200 m breaststroke | | | | | | |-align=center |align=left|Shane Ryan |align=left|Men's 100 m backstroke | | | | | | |} ==Taekwondo== Ireland enter one athlete into the taekwondo competition for the first time at the Games. With the Grand Slam winner already qualified through the WT Olympic Rankings, the automatic spot associated with the winner defaulted to the Olympic rankings list, from which the first five taekwondo practitioners had already won quota places. As the next highest-ranked eligible taekwondo practitioner, 2019 European silver medalist Jack Woolley thereby secured Ireland's first ever Olympic quota place, in the men's flyweight category (58 kg). {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !Round of 16 !Quarterfinals !Semifinals !Repechage !colspan=2|Final / |-style=\"font- size:95%\" !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Jack Woolley |align=left|Men's \u221258 kg | | | | | | |} ==References== Category:Nations at the 2020 Summer Olympics 2020 Category:2020 in Irish sport ",
