After some time, he attended the University of Pittsburgh for a post-graduate degree, obtaining his PhD. Prior to taking up his position at UC Davis, he also taught for many years at UC Irvine, and held appointments at Pittsburgh, Yale, Stanford, Michigan State, and elsewhere. He passed away on October 11, 2015. ==Research== An expert in pure and applied logic, his research largely focused on issues in defeasible reasoning and non-monotonic logic. His more recent work in philosophy of logic was concerned with applications of generalized quantifier theory and abstraction principles to the foundations of arithmetic in the more general context of Fregean foundations, as well as making contributions to Frege scholarship. ==References== Category:1962 births Category:2015 deaths Category:American philosophers ",
