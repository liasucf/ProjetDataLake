    "text": "The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo is an American action/adventure sitcom television series that ran on NBC from September 18, 1979, to May 5, 1981. For its second season the show was renamed Lobo. The program aired Tuesday nights, at 8 p.m. Eastern time. The lead character, Sheriff Elroy P. Lobo, played by Claude Akins, was a spin-off character from B. J. and the Bear, which also aired on NBC from 1979-1981. ==Synopsis== In fictitious Orly County, Georgia, Sheriff Lobo is the lead enforcer of the law -- as well as one of its leading offenders. The corrupt (but now somewhat reformed) sheriff is assisted in his schemes by Deputy Perkins (Mills Watson) whose buffoonery often upsets and exacerbates the situation. An honest but naive new deputy, Birdwell \"Birdie\" Hawkins (Brian Kerwin), who is unaware of Lobo's schemes has joined the force and has become one of Lobo's deputies. He often refers to Lobo as his \"Hero\" and compares him to Wyatt Earp, \"a little rough around the edges, but a good lawman.\" At first this baffles Lobo to think that someone actually thinks highly of him in any way, but it begins to make Lobo feel proud and boosts his self-esteem. This always annoys and infuriates Perkins who usually sneers at Birdie and mutters, \"I'm gonna have to get that boy!\" Other characters in the show were Perkins' wife (and Lobo's sister) Rose Lobo Perkins (Cydney Crampton), waitress Margaret Ellen (Janet Lynn Curtis), resort owner Sarah Cumberland (Leann Hunley), bank president and Lobo's former \"partner in crime\" Harry Cunningham (Dennis Burkley) and district attorney Alexander Waverly (Ben Cooper). The show was an obvious clone of CBS' hit comedy/drama The Dukes of Hazzard, right down to the rural Georgia setting and the shiftiness of its lead character. Lobo (seemingly a cross between Hazzard County's Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane) was a small-time wheeler-dealer, always looking to make a quick buck. But when serious crime threatened Orly County and its people, Lobo would do his job capably and uphold the law; unlike Hogg or Coltrane, Lobo was portrayed as an intelligent man and an able police officer. The series premise was overhauled completely as the second season began in 1980. The governor of Georgia, impressed by Orly County's low crime rate (because Lobo forgot to send the data to the state capitol), reassigns Lobo and Deputies Perkins and Birdie to his crime-fighting task force, Special Crimes Action Team (SCAT) in Atlanta, reporting to Chief J.C. Carson (Nicolas Coster). Lobo is forced to contend with his new co-workers, Detectives Peaches (Amy Botwinick) and Brandy (Tara Buckman). The new format also included Nell Carter (billed as Nell Ruth Carter) as Sgt. Hildy Jones. In a July 1980 interview with The New York Times, NBC president Fred Silverman said research showed the show performing well in rural areas, but not as well in urban areas; Silverman had a history of preference for urban viewers over rural ones that dated all the way back to 1970 (see the rural purge for an example). For that reason, it was decided to move the show from rural Orly County to urban Atlanta. But the series was less successful with the new format, and it was cancelled after the end of its second season. The theme song for the show's first season was sung by Frankie Laine and was written in a western ballad style that depicted Lobo as more of a hero than an offender. During the second season, the theme song was a version of \"Georgia on My Mind\". The pilot of The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo aired as an episode of BJ and the Bear titled \"Lobo\", which set the premise for the show and introduced the main cast of characters that would be involved in the show. ==Cast== * Claude Akins as Sheriff Elroy P.

For syndication, Universal offered the show in two versions, one was the original 60 minute format and the other had episodes cut to fit a half-hour time slot from their original hour versions. What differentiated the half hour episodes from the hour long ones was the inclusion of a laugh track. == External links == * * * == References == Category:1979 American television series debuts Category:1981 American television series endings Category:1970s American sitcoms Category:1980s American sitcoms Category:English-language television shows Category:NBC original programming Category:Television series by Universal Television Category:Television shows set in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:American television spin-offs Category:Television series created by Glen A.
