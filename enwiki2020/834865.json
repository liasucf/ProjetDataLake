    "text": "The Mazda2 is a subcompact/supermini/B-segment small car manufactured and marketed globally by Mazda since 1996, currently in its fourth generation. The Mazda2 was previously marketed as the Mazda Demio (a name it kept in some markets until 2019) and as the Mazda 121 and Mazda Metro. The Mazda2 is based on the Mazda D-platform and was preceded by two other small cars based on the platform: the Ford Festiva (designed and built by Mazda for Ford and also sold as the Mazda 121) that was introduced in 1986 on the DA platform and the Revue (sold by Mazda's Autozam marquee) introduced in 1990 on the DB platform. The Mazda Demio added the DW platform in 1996. The name \"Demio\" is derived from Latin meus to show possession, which in many Romance languages has become \"mio.\" The third generation Demio earned the 2008 World Car of the Year title, while the fourth generation was awarded the 2014\u20132015 \"Japanese Car of the Year\". Several generations of the Mazda2 have been rebadged and sold by other manufacturers. The first generation was sold as the Ford Festiva Mini Wagon in some markets and the fourth generation was sold in North America as the Scion iA, Toyota Yaris iA, and Toyota Yaris. == First generation (DW; 1996) == When it came to redesigning the Revue, Mazda came up with a tall hatchback, minivan-esque package (the Revue was already over tall). Introduced in a time full of negative press coverage, the Demio became a surprise hit for Mazda in Japan, and also foreshadowed the current crop of B-segment minivans such as the Opel Meriva, Fiat Idea and the Renault Modus. A concept model previewing the DW series, called the Mazda BU-X was shown in 1995. At its introduction in 1997, it won the Automotive Researchers' and Journalists' Conference Car of the Year award in Japan. Production of the new Demio started in July 1996 (sold as the 121 outside Japan and Europe) used the DW platform. Ford retailed a version in Japan as the Ford Festiva Mini Wagon. In 1998, the Mazda logo was changed to the current logo. The Demio was updated in 1999 with a revised exterior, cabin air filtration, retuned automatic transmission, and available DSC due to a 2002 redesign. === Engines === * 1.3 L B3-ME I4 (1996\u20131998) * 1.5 L B5-ME I4 (1996\u20131998) * 1.3 L B3E I4, / (1999\u20132001) * 1.5 L B5E I4, / (2000\u20132001) === Production === The original DW model was produced in Mazda's Colombia plant as \"Mazda Demio\" until the end of 2007 when the DE model replaced it. === Gallery === 1st generation Mazda Demio.jpg|1996-1999 Mazda Demio (Japan; pre-facelift) 1996-1997 Mazda 121 (DW) Metro hatchback 01.jpg|1997 Mazda 121 Metro (Australia; pre-facelift) 1999-2001 Mazda Demio rear.jpg|1999\u20132002 Mazda Demio (Japan; facelift) 1996 Ford Festiva Miniwagon.JPG|1996 Ford Festiva Mini Wagon == Second generation (DY; 2002) == The Demio was redesigned in 2002 on the DY platform. The Demio name continued in Japan, while the rest of the world dropped 121 and other names in favor of Mazda2. Since its debut, the 2 has been well received by the market pushing its Japanese domestic sale to as high as seventh place. 2002\u20132004 Mazda2 (Germany) Interior (Europe) The badge-engineered Ford version, the Ford Fusion, is no longer made, as Ford began importing the Ford Fiesta on the global Ford B3 platform which is based on Mazda's DY platform. Production of the car for European market started at Almussafes Ford plant in Valencia, Spain on 20 January 2003. All Demios come with ABS and EBD, and stability control is optional. An innovative feature offered in Japan is e-4WD, a hybrid car-type system which uses an electric motor to power the rear wheels of this front wheel drive vehicle when needed. In the Demio, this system is used only as a traction aid, not for increased fuel economy as in most other vehicles. There is also a big difference in floor pan and pedal box. The European- exclusive version of Mazda2 (DY) uses a pedal box directly sourced from Ford Fiesta rather than their own 4x108 bolt pattern instead of 4x100. Three trim levels were available in Japan, Cozy, Sport, and Casual. In Europe, trim levels were S, TS and TS2. The TS and TS2 were renamed Antares and Capella in 2004. The Japanese 1.3 and 1.5 gasoline engines are not available, but Ford's 1.25-liter 16-valve Sigma engine is used, and Mazda's 1.4 and 1.6 gasoline, plus Fords 1.4 TDCi diesel are offered but called 1.4 CDTi by Mazda. (Virtually all the engine parts are interchangeable with the 1.4 diesel version of the Ford Fiesta and Ford Fusion of the same period). The Mazda2 is sold with a variety of Z-family engines: Mazda Demio: * 1.3 L ZJ-VE I4 at 6000 rpm, at 3500 rpm * 1.5 L ZY-VE I4 at 6000 rpm, at 4000 rpm Mazda2: * 1.25 L MZI C2 at 5700 rpm, at 3500 rpm * 1.4 L MZI C4 at 5700 rpm, at 3500 rpm * 1.6 L MZI C6 at 6000 rpm, at 4000 rpm * 1.4 L MZ-CDTi Diesel at 4000 rpm, at 2000 rpm In 2004 Mazda introduced the Verisa in Japan. The Verisa is based on the Demio but targeted further upmarket. === Safety === === Gallery === 2nd generation Mazda Demio.jpg|2005-2007 Mazda Demio hatchback (Japan) 2005-2007 Mazda 2 (DY Series 2) Genki hatchback 01.jpg|2005\u20132007 Mazda2 (DY Series 2) Genki hatchback (Australia) 2005-2007 Mazda 2 (DY Series 2) Genki hatchback 02.jpg|2005\u20132007 Mazda2 (DY Series 2) Genki hatchback (Australia) == Third generation (DE; 2007) == The third generation Demio is built on the new DE platform, which Ford also used for the 2008 Ford Fiesta. It employs lightweight materials and reduces the overall dimensions of the car. This generation dropped the mini MPV high-roof styling adopted by its predecessor, instead opting for a more conventional hatchback look. The lead designer for the third generation was Ikuo Maeda, who was later promoted to Head of Design at Mazda in 2009. The Mazda2 launched at the 2007 Geneva Motor Show, and later at the 2007 Shanghai International Motor Show. For the Japanese domestic market, sales of the production vehicles began on 5 July 2007 at Mazda, Mazda \u025b\u0303fini and Autozam dealers. A three-door variant was released for the European market in 2008. Engine choices include the MZR 1.3-liter and 1.5-liter gasoline, MZ-CD 1.4-liter common-rail turbo diesel. In some EU Member States like the Netherlands, there is the option to buy the gasoline car in bi-fuel LPG version from the factory. This model was unveiled at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show. The North American version of the Mazda2 debuted at the 2009 LA Auto Show, and later at the 2010 Canadian International AutoShow. The Mazda2 became available in July, 2010 with the 1.5-liter, 100 hp four-cylinder and 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. Mazda discontinued the Mazda2 in the United States after the 2014 model year. The Chinese model of the Mazda2 in five-door hatchback body style launched at the 2007 Guangzhou Motor Show. A Chinese four-door sedan model of the Mazda2 was unveiled at the same event, with sales beginning in January, 2008. The sedan body style was manufactured in Thailand and China and marketed only in Southeast Asia, Oceania, South America and the Caribbean. In Australia, the sedan was introduced along with the facelifted hatchback in May 2010, with the sedan version being offered in a single 'Maxx' grade. In February 2011, Mazda Australia had reverted to Japanese sourced production, which led to the discontinuation of the sedan being offered after just 9 months on-sale. === Gallery === 2008 Mazda2 (DE) Neo 3-door hatchback (2015-07-15) 02.jpg|Mazda2 3-door (pre-facelift) 2009 Mazda2 TS2 1.3 Rear.jpg|Mazda2 5-door (pre-facelift) 2011 Mazda2 Touring -- 11-30-2010 2.jpg|Mazda2 5-door (facelift) 2011 Mazda2 (DE Series 2 MY11) Neo 5-door hatchback (2015-07-24) 02.jpg|Mazda2 5-door (facelift) 2010 Mazda2 (DE Series 2) Maxx sedan (2015-11-11) 02.jpg|Mazda2 sedan Demio3rdinterior.jpg|Interior === Engines === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Model!!Years!!Engine type!!Power, torque@rpm |- !colspan=4|Gasoline engines |- |1.3L (Miller Cycle)||2007\u2013|| I4 (ZJ-VEM)||@6000, @4000 |- |1.3L MZR (Low Power)||2007\u2013|| I4 (ZJ-VE MZR)||@6000, @3500 |- |1.3L MZR (ZJ-VE)||2007\u2013|| I4 (ZJ-VE)||@6000, @3500 |- |1.3L MZR||2007\u2013|| I4 (ZJ-VE MZR)||@6000, @3500 |- |1.5L MZR (ZY-VE)||2007\u2013|| I4 (ZY-VE)||@6000, @4000 |- |1.5L MZR||2007\u2013|| I4 (ZY-VE MZR)||@6000, @4500 |- !colspan=4|Diesel engines |- |1.4L MZ-CD||2007\u2013|| I4 turbo (Y4)||@4000, @2000 |- |1.6L MZ-CD||2009\u2013|| I4 turbo (Y6)||@4000, @1750 |} === Transmissions === Transmission choices include a five speed manual, a four speed automatic, a CVT (only available in Japan and Hong Kong) or a CVT with a sport mode featuring seven simulated ratios and paddle shifters (only available in Japan). === Equipment === A digital fuel gauge is a standard feature and stability control is available, except in Australia, where it is standard.

A fuel tank that can be filled with gasoline, butane, or propane was claimed to almost double the EV range to . == Fourth generation (DJ; 2014) == Reports of a new generation of the Mazda Demio emerged in 2013 for a 2014 launch, with some manufacturing at the new Mazda plant in Mexico. The Mazda Hazumi Concept model (designed to preview the future Mazda2 models) was unveiled at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show and in April 2014 the development mule of the new generation Demio was undergoing testing in Germany, covered in camouflage. In July 2014, Mazda presented photos of the fourth generation Demio hatchback, and production began at Mazda's H\u014dfu plant. Sales in Japan began in September 2014. The sedan version debuted at the Thailand International Motor Expo in November 2014. The fourth generation is based on a variation of Mazda's CX-5 platform, rather than the DE platform used on the Ford Fiesta and features greater length, wider front and rear tracks, decreased interior room for rear-seat occupants and less front head and legroom. In 2014, the Mazda de M\u00e9xico Vehicle Operation (MMVO) factory in Salamanca, Guanajuato began production of the Mazda2 for various North and South American markets. In October 2014, the Demio was awarded the 2014\u20132015 \"Car of the Year\" by the Japan Car of the Year Committee. Despite the Mazda2 being produced in North America, at the new Mexico plant, Mazda announced that it would not sell the vehicle in Canada or the United States (except in Puerto Rico). Instead, the Mazda2 would be sold by Toyota Motor North America in those markets between 2016 and 2020 (see section below). The Demio nameplate was discontinued in all remaining markets in September 2019, and replaced by the Mazda2 moniker worldwide. The fourth-generation received a facelift for the 2020 model year with various exterior changes, interior trim changes, revised suspension tuning to improve ride quality, improvements to the engine deceleration energy recovery system, adaptive headlights, and standard G-Vectoring Control Plus. With Toyota discontinuing its marketing of the Mazda2, the vehicle finally went on sale in Mexico, where it is produced. The facelift model went on sale in Mexico in October 2019 for the 2020 model year. It comes in three versions: i, i Touring, and i Grand Touring with automatic transmission. === Engines and transmission === The Mazda2 uses Mazda's SkyActiv-Drive six-speed automatic and SkyActiv-MT five- and six-speed manual gearboxes as well as stop-start technology (\"i-STOP\" turns the engine off when the car is stationary) and a brake energy regeneration system (\"i-ELOOP\" uses braking to charge a capacitor for all car electronics, in place of an alternator charging a battery). The Mazda2 is initially offered with a 1.5-liter gasoline engine and a 1.5-liter diesel engine\u2014the SkyActiv-D, 1.5-liter diesel engine debuted at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show. The gasoline engine will be available with 74 bhp, 89 bhp or 113 bhp, while the diesel will produce 104 bhp. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Model!!Years!!Engine type!!Power, torque@rpm |- ! colspan=\"4\" |Gasoline engines |- |1.3L Skyactiv-G||2014\u2013|| I4 (P3-VPS)||@5800, @4000 |- |1.5L Skyactiv-G||2014\u2013|| I4 (P5-VPS)||@6000, @4000 |- ! colspan=\"4\" |Diesel engines |- |1.5L Skyactiv-D||2014\u2013|| I4 turbo (S5-DPTS)||@4000, @1500\u20132000 |- ! colspan=\"4\" |Hybrid engines |- |1.5L Skyactiv-G||2014\u2013|| I4 Hybrid (Hybrid F-P5)||@6000, @4000 |} === Scion iA and Toyota Yaris (North America) === While the Mazda2 is produced in North America at Mazda's plant in Mexico, the company did not sell the vehicle in Canada or the United States (except in Puerto Rico). Instead, the Mazda2 would be sold by Toyota Motor North America in those markets between 2016 and 2020. In Canada, the vehicle was sold as the Toyota Yaris Sedan across all model years. Mazda initially announced at the 2015 Montreal International Auto Show that it would offer the Mazda2 in the market, but canceled the rollout on 16 November 2015, and shifted the rollout to Toyota. In Mexico, the vehicle was sold as the Toyota Yaris R, alongside the more austere and lower-priced Yaris Sed\u00e1n (a variant of the Toyota Vios and later the Toyota Yaris ATIV). The Yaris R sold in three versions. In the United States, the sedan was sold under several names. In the initial 2016 model year, it was marketed under Toyota's youth- oriented Scion brand as the Scion iA, where it was the only 4-door sedan and only model not to be built in Japan to be marketed under the brand. After discontinuing the Scion brand, the car was rebranded as the Toyota Yaris iA for the 2017 and 2018 model years. For the 2019 and 2020 model years the sedan was re-branded again as the Toyota Yaris Sedan. When first introduced, like all Scion vehicle, the iA only had one trim level (monospec) and only offered buyers a choice of exterior color and a choice between 6-speed manual and 6-speed automatic transmissions. For the 2019 and 2020 model years (as it was re-branded as the Toyota Yaris Sedan in the US) the sedan received a minor facelift and introduced L, LE and XLE trim levels with a variety of interior and exterior options. The hatchback variant of the Mazda2 was not initially sold by Toyota, which instead offered a Yaris Liftback based on the Toyota Vitz (XP130). When the Vitz was discontinued, Toyota announced at the 2019 New York International Auto Show that a new Yaris Hatchback, based on the Mazda2, would go on sale in 2019 for the 2020 model year. Both the Toyota Yaris Sedan and Hatchback exports to the United States stopped in June 2020 due to new regulations and slow sales. === Safety === ===Sales=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\" |- !
