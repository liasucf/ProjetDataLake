    "text": "Angke Station () is a railway station located in Tambora, West Jakarta, Indonesia. It is served by the Loop line of the KRL Commuter Line. This station has three tracks with tracks 2 and 3 as the through tracks. In early 2008, the station was cleared from hundreds of illegal huts on the land near the station. Before February 2017, this station was used for the beginning and end of local train trips serving Banten, such as Langsam, Banten Express, and Patas Merak, while the KRL Commuter Line ran without stopping at this station. For Kalimaya and Rangkas Jaya trains, the beginning and end of the trip remained from Tanah Abang Station. Since February 2017 the station has been reactivated for KRL with Angke-Bogor, Angke-Depok, and Angke-Nambo routes. All local trains that previously serve this station were combined as Lokal Merak train and the relation was changed to Rangkasbitung-Merak. == Services == === KRL Commuter Line === * KA Commuter Line Jatinegara\u2013Bogor == Intermodal support == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Public transport type !Line !Destination |- |MetroMini |B80 |Kalideres Terminal - Jembatan Lima |- |Kopaja |B86 |Jakarta Kota Station - Lebak Bulus Terminal |- |Mikrolet |M43 |Grogol Terminal - Angke Station |- |KWK |B02 |Cengkareng Timur-Jakarta Kota Station |} == References == Category:West Jakarta Category:Railway stations in Jakarta Category:Railway stations opened in 1899 ",
