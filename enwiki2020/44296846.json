He is also the Founder and Non-Executive Director of Prime Focus Limited, world's largest independent integrated media services company. == Early life == Malhotra is the eldest son of Bollywood film producer Naresh Malhotra and grandson of cinematographer M.N. Malhotra. He grew up in Mumbai, India and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Commerce from H.R. College of Commerce and Economics, Mumbai. == Career == In 1995, Malhotra enrolled in a computer graphics school, where he saw how whole movies could be created on computers. He later recruited three of his teachers at the school as co-founders and started Video Workshop, an editing studio in his father's garage. Over the next two years, Video Workshop completed work on many television shows and serials (like Boogie Woogie for Sony, Colgate Top 10 for Zee Entertainment, Gaatha for Star India), advertisement films/TVC's (for producers like Sunil Manchanda of MAD Entertainment) and music videos (for producers like Sanjay Gupta, Kunal Kohli and Anubhav Sinha). It also ran the post-production facility for Channel V. In 1997, Malhotra merged Video Workshop's business with Naresh Malhotra's Video Works, a film production equipment rental business to create Prime Focus. Prime Focus provided technological creative services such as visual effects, sound and Digital Intermediate (DI) for television and movies. It was one of the earliest companies to set up a scanning and recording system (2001) and DI system (2003) in India. It was also the first visual effects company in India to operate a Motion Controlled Rig (2004). In 2006, Malhotra listed Prime Focus on the Indian stock exchange and he became the first Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the newly-listed company. Prime Focus expanded globally with the launch of Prime Focus World (PFW), which acquired visual effects (VFX), broadcast and post-production facilities in London, New York, Los Angeles and Vancouver. In 2009, using Prime Focus World's proprietary View-D technology, the company converted Clash of the Titans into 3D. The work on this movie led to Prime Focus delivering stereo conversions for a number of other movie blockbusters, including: Star Wars: Episode I, Star Wars: Episode II, and Star Wars: Episode III; Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2; The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; Wrath of the Titans; Transformers: Dark of the Moon; and Shrek 2. In October 2011, Malhotra relinquished his role as Managing Director of Prime Focus Limited to Ramki Sankaranarayanan. In 2012, he secured Standard Chartered Private Equity to invest in Prime Focus and diluted his stake in Prime Focus World to bring onboard Aid Capital Partners and Macquarie Capital Group in 2013. == References == Category:1976 births Category:Indian chief executives Category:Living people ",
