    "text": "Hedgehog caught in a Timms trap A Timms trap is a device used to capture and kill common brushtail possums. Their use is commonplace in New Zealand, where the possum is an introduced pest. In Australia, where the possum is a protected native species,Possum FAQ, Australian Government Web Site. The trap uses a spring-loaded metal mouth to break the neck of the animal, resulting in a rapid and humane death. It requires baiting with fresh fruit in order to attract a pest, which inserts its head through the hole at the front, springing the trap. A Timms trap, as a form of kill trap, is inexpensive, and simple to use, and provides an effective means of pest control for gardens and similar-sized areas. The use of fruit as bait reduces the likelihood that a pet, such as a cat, will be caught. == References == == External links == * Timms traps for possum control, Auckland Regional Council (PDF) * Possums, New Zealand Government Web Site Category:Mammal pest control Category:Pest trapping ",
