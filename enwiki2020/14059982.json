In the , Dalbeg had a population of 76 people. ==Geography== Dalbeg farming community located inland from the townships of Ayr and Home Hill. Situated on the banks of the Burdekin River, it is a fertile area famous for growing sugar cane and vegetables. On many maps there appears to be a road crossing the Burdekin River at Dalbeg. In fact this was once a fording point. The earliest explorers coming from the Gulf region (The Plains of Promise) used Expedition Pass through the mountains to arrive at the banks of the Burdekin River at this fording point where they then crossed into Strathalbyn Station. The river can no longer be forded at this point. ==History== The area was originally known as Akala until the Queensland Surveyor General changed the name to Dalbeg, the name of a pastoral run taken up by pastoralist James Hall Scott on 28 May 1863. Dalbeg Post Office opened on 1 December 1956 and closed in 1971. Dalbeg State School opened on 4 July 1955; it closed on 1999. Dalbeg was once home to the North Queensland Soaring Centre (then the Burdekin Soaring Club). ==References== == External links == *Burdekin OnLine Web Site Category:Towns in Queensland Category:Shire of Burdekin Category:Localities in Queensland ",
