He served since 1508 Duke Ulrich von W\u00fcrttemberg and helped him crush the Poor Conrad rebellion. In 1516 he fought for Bavaria alongside Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor in Italy against France and their allies. In the next years he was in the service of the Swabian League and chased his former employer, Ulrich von W\u00fcrttemberg out of W\u00fcrttemberg. In 1525 he succeeded his cousin Wilhelm as governor of W\u00fcrttemberg. Both received the hereditary title \"Reichserbtruchsess\" from the hands of Emperor Charles V on 27 July 1526 in Toledo. == Bauernj\u00f6rg == Georg became famous as Bauernj\u00f6rg (peasant torturer) for his harsh and pitiless actions against the rebellious peasants in the German Peasants' War. When the German peasants revolted in 1525, most Imperial troops were fighting in Italy. Georg von Waldburg could only recruit 4,000 unreliable Landsknechts and could do nothing more than to negotiate with the peasants. But after the victory against France in the Battle of Pavia, many war veterans returned to Southern Germany and were enlisted by Waldburg. Under his command, army after army of peasants was defeated and pursued into their villages to be tortured and executed. Sources speak of between 70,000 and 130,000 peasants killed. After the rebellion was crushed, Georg Truchsess von Waldburg-Zeil ruled large parts of the territories he had conquered, and collected ransoms from the remaining population.Peter Blickle: Der Bauernj\u00f6rg.
