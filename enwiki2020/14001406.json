He is originally from Walsham-le-Willows, near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, but grew up near Wimbledon, London. He founded his company marcus evans in 1983. The group organises live business, sports and entertainment events around the world. Its global regional head offices are: Europe \u2013 Dublin, US \u2013 Chicago and APAC \u2013 Kuala Lumpur. Marcus Evans the individual maintains a low profile, with limited photos and interviews of him available online. ==Career== He graduated from Cambridge University. According to Companies House, Evans started his first firm, Associated Promotions, in 1983 when corporate hospitality was a relatively new market. By 1992 he had renamed his company The Hospitality Group (THG Sports Tours) and he bought into a clothing and gifts company, Castle Mills International, but within a year sold out to investor Brian Rousell. THG Sports Tours is now part of the wider Marcus Evans Group. In 1994, he paid \u00a3325,000 for a stake of just under 5 per cent in the consumer electronics group Ross, but in 1999, having spent 5 years reorganising the companies with the companies bankers eventually Evans fully arranged a rights issue with other investors who took over the company. In 2004 Evans made an unsuccessful \u00a3700+ million offer for the Daily Mirror, followed by another rejected offer of \u00a3550+ million in 2006. ===2007 Rugby World Cup=== In June 2007, the organisers of the Rugby World Cup failed to secure exclusive control over corporate hospitality at the event. In a ruling, the Paris Commercial Court awarded marcus evans the right to run hospitality packages without the approval of the organising committee. Marcus Evans won its case after telling the court that its packages included receptions before and after the matches, but not tickets to see them. This claim was contested by the organising committee. However despite taking Marcus Evans' THG Group to the highest appeal courts in France in 2008, THG Group won its case in the courts. ===2012 Olympic Games (London)=== In 2007, The Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) officially appointed the THG Sports Tours, another company owned by Marcus Evans and part of the Marcus Evans Group as its official ticketing agency for the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Subsequently, both the Greek Olympic organisation and the Maltese Olympic organisation have appointed THG Sports Tours as their agents. ==Ipswich Town== In 2007 Ipswich Town Football Club announced that Marcus Evans would be buying a controlling stake in the club subject to contracts, due diligence and shareholder approval. The deal saw Evans purchase Ipswich Town's \u00a332 million debts with Aviva (Norwich Union) and Barclays Bank. The official announcement did not state the terms of this deal: various unsourced media reports speculated that he paid anything between 20 pence and 100 pence in the pound, without giving sources.Norwich Union severs Ipswich Town links, eveningnews24.co.uk, 1 November 2007. He injected \u00a312 million into the club in exchange for an issue of new shares, which gave him an 87.5% stake, and reduced the existing shareholders stake to 12.5%. The deal was finalised following an EGM on 17 December 2007, at which the proposal was backed by shareholders speaking for 98.9% of the stock. When owner Marcus Evans took over the club in 2007, the club were \u00a332m in debt \u2013under Evan\u2019s ownership, this figure has more than doubled (and looks set to increase further in the next accounts). Ipswich Town pays Marcus Evans around 5.4% interest on the debt. Club accounts in 2012 showed that \u00a367m debt is owed to Evans and he has not converted any of it to equity. After 11 years of Marcus Evans ownership the club finished bottom of the Championship in 2019 and were relegated to League One, the third tier of English football for the first time since 1957. Following relegation the club's debt, which is owed exclusively to Evans, rose from \u00a395.5m to \u00a396.3m. https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47835896 https://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/itfc-reveal-2018-19-accounts-1-6428196 ==Marcus Evans Group== Marcus Evans Group was founded in 1983, employs over 3000 staff and has around 56 offices globally.
