    "text": "The United States National Biosurveillance Strategy is the plan to implement a biosurveillance system that will monitor and interpret data that might relate to disease activity and threats to human or animal health \u2013 whether infectious, toxic, metabolic, and regardless of intentional or natural origin \u2013 in order to achieve early warning of health threats, early detection of health events and overall situational awareness of disease activity.Bush, George W. \"Homeland Security Presidential Directive.\" National Security Presidential Directives (2001). ==Types of data collection== It is debated whether is it better to engage in a \u201cmore data, faster is better\u201d approach or whether it would be more effective to pursue fewer but more meaningful data streams.Nuzzo, Jennifer B. \"Developing a national biosurveillance program.\" Biosecurity and Bioterrorism 7.1 (2009): 37-38. Some of the things that will be monitored are counts of clinical diagnoses, sales of over-the-counter remedies, and school absentees among select age groups.Burkom, Howard S., et al. \"Role of data aggregation in biosurveillance detection strategies with applications from ESSENCE.\" Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2004): 67-73. ==Proposed plan== The Department of Homeland Security laid out the plan for the national biosurveillance system. They stated that an effect surveillance system relies on five key principles that are generally applied to public health and medical preparedness. The first is being prepared for all potential catastrophic health events; the second is having vertical and horizontal coordination among all levels of government; the third is having a regional approach to health preparedness; the fourth is the engagement of the private sector, academia, and other nongovernmental entities; the fifth is the important roles of individuals, families, and communities.Diamond, Carol C., Farzad Mostashari, and Clay Shirky. \"Collecting and sharing data for population health: a new paradigm.\" Health affairs 28.2 (2009): 454-466. The biosurveillance program must be nationwide, robust, and integrated with international disease systems in order to provide early warning and ongoing characterization of disease outbreaks in real-time.Bush, George W. The national security strategy of the United States of America. Wordclay, 2009. The system must be sufficiently able to identify a specific disease and its prevalence in varying populations and environments and must be able to tailor the analysis to new diseases. The system should create a networked system to allow for two-way information flow between and among Federal, State, and local government public health authorities and clinical health care providers. The system shall build upon existing Federal, State, and local surveillance systems where they exists and should enable and provide incentive for public health agencies to implement surveillance systems where they do not exist. ==See also== * Disease surveillance * Public health surveillance ==References== Category:Surveillance Category:Medical monitoring Category:Disaster preparedness ",
