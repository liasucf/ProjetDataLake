    "text": "Trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (TOR or TMAO reductase, EC 1.7.2.3) is a microbial enzyme that can reduce trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) into trimethylamine (TMA), as part of the electron transport chain. The enzyme has been purified from E. coli and the photosynthetic bacteria Roseobacter denitrificans.. In general, it catalyzes the chemical reaction :NADH + H+ \\+ trimethylamine N-oxide \\rightleftharpoons NAD+ \\+ trimethylamine + H2O The 3 substrates of this enzyme are NADH, H+, and trimethylamine N-oxide, whereas its 3 products are NAD+, trimethylamine, and H2O. However, both the R. denitrificans and E. coli enzymes can accept electrons from cytochromes.: :trimethylamine + 2 (ferricytochrome c)-subunit + H2O \u2192 trimethylamine N-oxide + 2 (ferrocytochrome c)-subunit + 2 H+ Trimethylamine oxide is found at high concentrations in the tissues of fish, and the bacterial reduction of this compound to foul-smelling trimethylamine is a major process in the spoilage of fish. ==See also== *Oxidative phosphorylation *Microbial metabolism ==References== == Further reading == * ==External links== *ENZYME entry for EC 1.7.2.3 *BRENDA entry for EC 1.7.2.3 Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes Category:NADH-dependent enzymes Category:Cellular respiration Category:Metabolism Category:EC 1.7.2 ",
