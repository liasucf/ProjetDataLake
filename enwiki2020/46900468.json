    "text": "Jakub Kagan (7 February 1896 \u2013 1942) was a popular Polish-Jewish composer, pianist, jazz musician and arranger. In the early 1920s, he formed the Kagan's Jazz Band in Warsaw, performing in operettas, cabarets, and hotels. Since 1922 Kagan was a feature artist at the Kabaret Mirage and at the Teatr Nowo\u015bci. In 1926 he signed a contract with the luxury Hotel Bristol in Warsaw. His band performed world-renowned standards as well as his own compositions widely popular across the country. He died in Warsaw during the Holocaust in occupied Poland. ==Life== Kagan was one of four sons of Morduch (Mordechai) and Sara n\u00e9e Kantor. He was born in Nowogr\u00f3dek in the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Navahrudak in Belarus). His eldest brother Mieczys\u0142aw (born in 1887) changed his name to Kochanowski and became composer of dance music before the First World War. Jakub followed in his brother's footsteps. He graduated from the Warsaw Institute of Music before 1918 and became member of the Polish Composers Union. In 1920 he fought in the Polish\u2013Soviet War defending Warsaw during the Battle of Radzymin. He began composing at that particular time. His first widely popular tango was \"Z\u0142ota pantera\" (The Gold Panther) to words by Andrzej W\u0142ast (1895\u20131942), premiered in 1929 in \u017begiest\u00f3w. The song opened all the doors for his subsequent Warsaw career, followed by international tours and concerts in Germany, Austria, and Hungary. His greatest hits were performed by such headliners as Hanka Ordon\u00f3wna, Adam Aston, and Stanis\u0142aw Grzesiuk. After the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany he was deported to the Warsaw Ghetto where he played piano at the Splendid Caf\u00e9 and the Melody Palace Theatre to survive. He was killed in 1942 possibly during the murderous Grossaktion Warsaw. His other brother, Feliks, who had changed his name to Kocha\u0144ski, also perished during the war.Naliwajek-Mazurek 2010 (ibidem), Note: see Tomasz Lerski, Syrena Record.

Only the youngest of the Kagan brothers, Alexander (born in 1906), survived the Holocaust as a soldier of the Polish Army in France (1939\u201340), interned in Switzerland. ==Popular songs== {| width=\"95%\" |- | * \"Musia\u0142em ci\u0119 zostawi\u0107\" (1937), words by Zenon Friedwald * \"Z\u0142ota pantera\" (1929), words by Andrzej W\u0142ast * \"Mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 stara jak \u015bwiat\" (1933), words by Jerzy Ryba * \"Zakochany ksi\u0119\u017cyc\" (1938), words by Zenon Friedwald * \"Na G\u00f3rny \u015al\u0105sk\" (march) * \"Skarga mi\u0142o\u015bci\" (waltz) * \"Wspomnienie Bobrujska\" (march) * \"Mary\" (foxtrot) * \"Cowboy\" (foxtrot) * \"Afra\" (foxtrot) * \"Luna\" (foxtrot) * \"Fata Morgana\" (1929), words by Andrzej W\u0142ast * \"Syn ulicy\" (1929), words by Andrzej W\u0142ast | * \"Koralowe usta\" (1930), words by Andrzej W\u0142ast * \"Nie trzeba s\u0142\u00f3w\" (1930), words by Wiktor Friedwald * \"Daisy\" (foxtrot) * \"Lady Harrison\" (foxtrot) * \"Derwisz\" (foxtrot) * \"Tow-To\" (foxtrot * \"Wspomnienie\" (boston) * \"Patrz z u\u015bmiechem na \u015bwiat\" (foxtrot) * \"Ty\u015b mych uczu\u0107 nie warta\" (1933), words by Jerzy Ryba * \"To mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 ko\u0144czy si\u0119 dzi\u015b\" (1933), words by Ludwik Starski * \"Jesienna piosenka\" (1934), words by Micha\u0142 Tyszkiewicz * \"Kocham twoje usta\" (1936), words by Zbigniew Maciejowski * \"Lubi\u0119 (1937)\", words by Zenon Friedwald |} ==References== * Jakub Kagan, Biblioteka Piosenki, Nota biograficzna ==Bibliography== * Stanis\u0142aw \u0141oza (ed.), \"Czy wiesz kto to jest?\", Wydawnictwo G\u0142\u00f3wnej Ksi\u0119garni Wojskowej Warszawa 1938, p. 312\\.
