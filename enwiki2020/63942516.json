    "text": "Morfonica is a Japanese all-female rock band that is part of Bushiroad's media franchise BanG Dream!. Formed in 2020, the group's members portray fictional characters in the project's anime series and mobile game BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! in addition to performing their characters' respective instruments in live concerts. The band consists of Amane Shind\u014d (vocals), Hina Sugata (guitar), Y\u016bka Nishio (bass), Mika (drums), and Ayasa (violin). In the game, Morfonica is represented by five first-year students at the prestigious Tsukinomori Girls' Academy: Mashiro Kurata (Shind\u014d), T\u014dko Kirigaya (Sugata), Nanami Hiromachi (Nishio), Tsukushi Futaba (mika), and Rui Yashio (Ayasa). Of the seven bands in BanG Dream!, Morfonica is one of four whose members perform their own music. ==History== Morfonica's formation was announced on 1 March 2020 during the franchise's live stream BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! @HHW CiRCLE Live Broadcasting Pre-3rd Anniversary Special. The band is the seventh in the franchise and the fourth that performs in live concerts after Poppin'Party, Roselia, and Raise A Suilen. Morfonica is the only group in the project with a violinist, which was conceived by BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! developer Craft Egg to differentiate them from the others. During the stream, a music video for their song \"Daylight\" was broadcast; the video was animated by the BanG Dream! anime's studio Sanzigen. A live-action music video and an introduction clip starring the voice actresses were released four days later. The Morfonica-centric weekly YouTube show Morfonical, hosted by the band's members, began airing on 24 March. On 13 May, Morfonica was named Tower Records' recommended artist of May 2020. \"Daylight\" was released as their debut single two weeks later on 27 May. The single sold over 15,000 copies in its first week, and peaked at second on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart. In June, the BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! Cover Collection Vol. 4, a series of cover songs by Morfonica and other bands in the franchise, topped Oricon's Weekly Albums Chart with 2,231 sales in the opening week. The band's first concert, Special Live ~Summerly Tone\u266a~ at the BanG Dream! 8th\u2606Live Summer Outdoors 3DAYS alongside Poppin'Party and Pastel\uff0aPalettes' Ami Maeshima with Raise A Suilen, took place on 23 August at Fuji-Q Highland Conifer Forest. Morfonica was the first of the three acts to perform, playing five songs. Cantabile, Morfonica's maiden standalone performance, was held on 7 October at Tokyo Garden Theater. The live featured 12 songs, including the two from the \"Daylight\" single and four cover versions of popular anime theme music. Morfonica's second single \"Bloom Bloom\", which was revealed during Cantabile, is set for a 13 January 2021 release. The group will host a joint concert with Poppin'Party, known as Friendship LIVE \"Astral Harmony\", on 23 February at Yokohama Arena. ==Members== * Amane Shind\u014d (Mashiro Kurata, vocals) \u2013 The youngest voice actress in BanG Dream!, Shind\u014d was 15 when she joined the franchise. Like Mashiro, Shind\u014d was a first-year high school student at the time of Morfonica's creation, which franchise creator Takaaki Kidani felt emphasized the connection between Shind\u014d and her fictional persona. She was a fan of Girls Band Party! prior to Morfonica, while her voice acting roles included the anime Bermuda Triangle: Colorful Pastrale. In a 2020 interview with Famitsu, she noted that since she has a low voice in contrast to Mashiro's intended pitch, she performs Morfonica songs in a higher tone. * Hina Suguta (T\u014dko Kirigaya, guitar) \u2013 Before joining BanG Dream!, Sugata was a voice actress in Afterlost. She is a host of the Morfonica-based YouTube series Monica Radio. * Y\u016bka Nishio (Nanami Hiromachi, bass) \u2013 Nishio's previous voice acting experience included portraying Yuu Higashiyama in ReBirth for You. Along with Sugata, Nishio co-hosts Monica Radio. * Mika (Tsukushi Futaba, drums) \u2013 Mika was the instructor for Poppin'Party and Roselia's drummers Ayaka \u014chashi and Megu Sakuragawa prior to Morfonica, and she also provided support drums for Poppin'Party at the BanG Dream! 7th\u2606Live. Tsukushi is her debut role as a voice actress. * Ayasa (Rui Yashio, violin) \u2013 Rui is Ayasa's first voice acting role. Outside of the franchise, she is a YouTube personality who performs violin covers of popular anime songs. She has also worked as a session musician for various artists. ==In-universe band== In the anime and game, Morfonica is a band of first-year high school students at the prestigious Tsukinomori Girls' Academy. The band makes its anime debut in the 2020 spin-off series BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! \u2606 Pico ~Ohmori~.
