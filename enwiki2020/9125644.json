    "text": "The Center for Army Lessons Learned (CALL) continuously leads the Army Lessons Learned Program and identifies, collects, analyzes, disseminates, and archives lessons and best practices while maintaining global situational awareness in order to share knowledge and facilitate the Army's and Unified Action Partners' adaptation to win wars. CALL is a multi-media based operation that disseminates these lessons and other related materials through a variety of print and electronic media, including their web site. After the Army\u2019s experience in Operation Urgent Fury, the Chief of Staff of the Army, General John Wickham, tasked the Army Studies Group to conduct an analysis of the Army\u2019s ability to adapt forces to local conditions in combat. On June 15, 1984 the Army Studies Group, headed by Colonel Wesley Clark, proposed a system for capturing lessons learned and adapting units for combat. The Chief of Staff of the Army quickly approved the recommended approach. CALL was officially stood up on August 1, 1985 as a directorate of the Combined Arms Training Activity (CATA) located at Fort Leavenworth, KS. CALL is currently a subordinate organization to the Mission Command Center of Excellence. == Sources == * *#333: The Center for Lessons Learned, a May 2007 story about U.S. Army Center for Army Lessons Learned from This American Life *\"Army Lessons Learned\", Federal Computer Week, July 15, 2006. * Category:Fort Leavenworth Category:Military in Kansas ",
