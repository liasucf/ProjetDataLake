    "text": "Andrija Novakovich (born September 21, 1996) is an American professional soccer player who plays as a forward in Italy for Frosinone. ==Career== ===Club=== Despite signing a letter of intent to play college soccer at Marquette University, Novakovich agreed to join English Championship side Reading in April 2014, signing for the club in June of the same year, the move being made easier due to Novakovich holding a British passport through his mother who was born in England of Serbian descent. On November 26, 2015, Novakovich joined National League side Cheltenham Town on loan until January 2, 2016. Novakovich returned to Reading on January 4, 2016 after Cheltenham Town didn't extend his loan deal. On July 2, 2017, Reading announced that Novakovich had signed a new two-year contract with the club, and that he would join Eerste Divisie side SC Telstar for the 2017\u201318 season. A year later, June 20, 2018, Novakovich signed a new two-year contract with Reading and moved to Fortuna Sittard on a season-long loan deal. On 2 September 2019, it was announced that Novakovich would leave Reading, with Frosinone paying an undisclosed fee for the player. Novakovich signed a contract with Frosinone lasting until 30 June 2022. ===International=== In March 2018, Novakovich was called up to the USMNT for the first time for their international friendly against Paraguay on March 27, 2018. In the 77' minute, he earned his first cap replacing Bobby Wood, the goalscorer, in Cary, North Carolina at WakeMed Soccer Park. Novakovich holds both British and American passports and remains eligible to represent England or the United States in a competitive match, as well as Serbia, his father's birthplace. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|National Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=5|Reading |2014\u201315 |rowspan=4|Championship |2||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |2||0 |- |2015\u201316 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |0||0 |- |2016\u201317 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |0||0 |- |2019\u201320 |1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |1||0 |- ! colspan=2|Total !3||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 !3||0 |- | Cheltenham Town (loan) | 2015\u201316 | National League | 4||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 | 5||0 |- | Telstar (loan) | 2017\u201318 | Eerste Divisie |35||19||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||2||2 |38||22 |- | Fortuna Sittard (loan) | 2018\u201319 | Eredivisie |29||9||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||1||1||32||11 |- | rowspan=2|Frosinone | 2019\u201320 | Serie B | 33||4||0||0||0||0||3||1 | 36||5 |- ! colspan=2|Total !33||4||0||0||0||0||3||1 !36||5 |- !colspan=3|Career total !104!!32!!3!!2!!0!!0!!7!!4!!113!!38 |} ==References== ==External links== *US Soccer Profile *Reading Profile * * * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:People from Muskego, Wisconsin Category:American soccer players Category:American expatriate soccer players Category:American people of Serbian descent Category:English people of Serbian descent Category:English people of American descent Category:Soccer players from Wisconsin Category:Association football forwards Category:Reading F.C. players Category:Cheltenham Town F.C. players Category:SC Telstar players Category:Fortuna Sittard players Category:Frosinone Calcio players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Eerste Divisie players Category:United States men's youth international soccer players Category:United States men's under-20 international soccer players Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in the Netherlands Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:United States men's international soccer players ",
