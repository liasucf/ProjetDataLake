    "text": "\"Analysis Situs\" is a seminal mathematics paper that Henri Poincar\u00e9 published in 1895.Poincar\u00e9 1895. Poincar\u00e9 published five supplements to the paper between 1899 and 1904.Poincar\u00e9 1899; Poincar\u00e9 1900; Poincar\u00e9 1902a; Poincar\u00e9 1902b; Poincar\u00e9 1904. These papers provided the first systematic treatment of topology and revolutionized the subject by using algebraic structures to distinguish between non-homeomorphic topological spaces, founding the field of algebraic topology.Dieudonn\u00e9 1989: 15\u201335. Poincar\u00e9's papers introduced the concepts of the fundamental group and simplicial homology, provided an early formulation of the Poincar\u00e9 duality theorem, introduced the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 characteristic for chain complexes, and raised several important conjectures, including the celebrated Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, which was later proven as a theorem. The 1895 paper coined the mathematical term \"homeomorphism\". == Footnotes == == References == * * * * * * * * Category:Mathematics papers ",
