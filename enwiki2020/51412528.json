It is a part of the Centre de services scolaire de Montr\u00e9al (CSSDM). ==About the school== Most people use the acronym \u00c9IM (EIM) or \u00c9IMS (EIMS) when referring to the school. Its principal was Julie Duchesne until 2020 when it became Luc Claude. The vice principal is Chantal Laurin and is in charge of specifically the Secondary school. The school is situated near the Westmount Public Library. The school was opened in 1988 and is an International Baccalaureate (IB) school.http://ecole-internationale.csdm.ca/ecole/ The school uniform consists of a choice between red, white or grey polos and between a marine-black vest or jacket. Students were free to wear anything non offensive and not too short on the bottom, but since fall 2016, students are imposed to wear marine or black unicolored clothing on the bottom. Even though the high school is public, it has an admission exam that sixth graders do in October each year. Usually, the school admits 120 students per year (4 classes of 30), but those who studied in \u00c9cole internationale de Montr\u00e9al (Primaire) have priority to be admitted to EIMS without any admission exams. The number of students from \u00c9cole internationale de Montr\u00e9al (Primaire) who choose the school varies from 40-60 per year, thus leaving only 60-80 places for students from other schools. The number of students taking the admission tests varies from 600-1000, making the acceptance rate vary from 6%-13%.http://ecole- internationale.csdm.ca/ecole/ In 2015, the school ranked 7th within all of Quebec's high schools, making it the 2nd best public high school in Quebec and 1st in Montreal.http://quebec.compareschoolrankings.org/secondary/%C3%89cole_internationale_de_Montr%C3%A9al/Westmount/Report_Card.aspx In 2016, the school ranked 3rd within all of Quebec's high schools, making it the best public high school in Quebec and Montreal.http://quebec.compareschoolrankings.org/secondary/%C3%89cole_internationale_de_Montr%C3%A9al/Westmount/Report_Card.aspx http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2016/le-palmares-des-ecoles-du-journal ==School life of a student== ===Usual schedule=== The school usually opens its doors at 7:55, classes begin at 8:15 and end at 15:10.
