    "text": "Matthew Barth is Yeager Family Chair Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California, Riverside, and director of Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT), the largest research center at University of California, Riverside. He was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2014 for pioneering research in intelligent transportation systems. == Career == Barth received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering/Computer Science from the University of Colorado in 1984, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1985 and 1990, respectively. From 1985 to 1986, he was a member of the technical staff in the Advanced Technologies Division of General Research Corporation, Santa Barbara. From 1986 to 1987 Barth conducted research at the University of Tokyo as a visiting research student. Upon completion of his Ph.D., Barth was a visiting researcher at Osaka University, Japan, conducting research in systems engineering from 1989 to 1991. He joined the University of California, Riverside in 1991, conducting research in Electrical Engineering and at the Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT), where he is currently Director and the Yeager Families Chair. == Research interests == Barth's research focuses on applying engineering system concepts and automation technology to Transportation Systems, and in particular how it relates to energy and air quality issues. He is also interested in intelligent transportation systems, vehicle activity analysis, transportation/emissions modeling, electric vehicle technology, and advanced sensing and control. == Society activities == Barth is active in the U.S. Transportation Research Board (TRB), currently serving on the Transportation and Air Quality Committee and the Intelligent Transportation Systems Committee. In 2007, he was awarded the TRB Pyke Johnson Award for TRB outstanding paper. He was one of the winners of the Connected Vehicle Technology Challenge sponsored by U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) in 2011. Barth has also served on a number of National Research Council (NRC) committees. Barth has been active within IEEE Intelligent Transportation System Society (ITSS) for many years, participating in their conferences as a presenter, invited session organizer, session moderator, program chair, associate editor of the Transactions of ITS, and member of the IEEE ITSS Board of Governors. He was the IEEE ITSS Vice President for Conferences from 2011 to 2012, and President from 2014 to 2015. He received the IEEE ITSS Outstanding Research Award in 2016. Barth is Senior Editor for both IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, and IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles. == References == == External links == * Barth's research lab * Barth's Google Scholar * CE-CERT website * Barth's personal page Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
