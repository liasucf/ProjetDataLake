    "text": "1991 is a Canadian comedy-drama film, directed by Ricardo Trogi and released in 2018. The third film in his semi-autobiographical series after 1981 and 1987, the film centres on Ricardo's (Jean-Carl Boucher) 1991 trip to Italy to pursue a relationship with Marie-\u00c8ve (Juliette Gosselin). The film finished 2018 as the year's top-grossing Canadian film, and was named the winner of the Golden Screen Award at the 7th Canadian Screen Awards. It received 16 Prix Iris nominations at the 21st Quebec Cinema Awards, including Best Film. == Plot == In 1991, when Ricardo is 21 and at university in Montr\u00e9al, his friends are leaving for Western Canada or the United States. His destination, though, is Italy, not because he has heard the call of the great cultural capitals of Europe, but in order to pursue \u201cthe woman of his life.\u201d In the movie 1981, the woman had been Anne Tremblay; in the movie 1987, it was Marie-Jos\u00e9e Lebel. Now in 1991, Ricardo Trogi determines to at last win the heart of the woman he considers his true soulmate, Marie-\u00c8ve Bernard. When she suggests they could meet in Perugia to study Italian, he promptly leaves to join her, and complications quickly ensue. Having lost his passport, most of his money and his letter of acceptance to the University of Perugia, he reports his loss to very solicitous Canadian Embassy staff in Rome and becomes appreciative that a referendum proposing Quebec's secession from Canada had failed to win a majority vote. He meets a rather engaging musician, the multilingual Arturo, who misjudges the nature of their friendship. The beautiful and insightful Georgia, whom he erroneously calls Yorda, falls in love with Ricardo and sometimes speaks to him in Greek, which he fails to understand; Ricardo, however, remains fixated on Marie-\u00c8ve, who clearly prefers the company of a Spanish layabout. ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=4| Canadian Screen Awards | rowspan=\"4\" | 31 March 2019 | Best Visual Effects | Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Talbot, Jean-Pierre Boies | | rowspan=\"4\" | |- | Best Sound | Michel Lecoufle, Sylvain Brassard | |- | Best Hair | Daniel Jacob | |- | Golden Screen Award ! | |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=16| Prix Iris | rowspan=\"16\" | 2 June 2019 | Best Film | Nicole Robert | | rowspan=\"16\" | |- | Best Director | rowspan=\"2\" | Ricardo Trogi | |- | Best Screenplay | |- | Best Actor | Jean-Carl Boucher | |- | Best Supporting Actress | Sandrine Bisson | |- | Best Supporting Actor | Alexandre Nachi | |- | Best Art Direction | Christian Legar\u00e9 | |- | Best Cinematography | Steve Asselin | |- | Best Sound | Sylvain Brassard, Michel Lecoufle | |- | Best Editing | Yvann Thibaudeau | |- | Best Original Music | Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric B\u00e9gin | |- | Best Visual Effects | Jean-Pierre Boies, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Talbot: | |- | Best Costume Design | Anne-Karine Gauthier | |- | Best Makeup | Virginie Boudreau | |- | Best Hair | Daniel Jacob | |- | Public Prize ! | |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 films Category:2018 comedy- drama films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian comedy-drama films Category:French-language films Category:Films directed by Ricardo Trogi Category:Films set in 1991 Category:Films set in Italy Category:Works about Italian-Canadian culture ",
