Since departing the group in 2001, her solo career has included numerous vocal appearances on dance tracks such as the Disco Montego Top 10 single \"Beautiful\", and dance act T-Funk single \"Be Together\". == Biography == Born in Adelaide, South Australia, Underwood sang in a girls choir, and later studied Maths and Computer Science at University of Adelaide. After three years at university she dropped out and moved to Melbourne. In June 2007, The Sydney Morning Herald printed an interview with Underwood about her bisexuality.Katie casually comes out \u2013 The Sydney Morning Herald, 4 June 2007 She currently lives in Melbourne and is a meditation teacher and remedial massage therapist. In July 2011, she gave birth to her twin daughters. == Music career == In February 1999 in London, Underwood recorded a dance track with UK trance act Terra Ferma, releasing her first single \"Don't Be Afraid\" through Platipus Records in the UK. She also recorded three more tracks which were included on the Terra Ferma album, released in early 2000. After returning from the UK to Melbourne, Underwood began working with singer/songwriter Charlie Rooke (formerly of The Sharp) and they formed a jazz-swing band called Corduroy Lounge. In October 1999, she auditioned for the TV show Popstars, making it through to the final five. As a result, she was selected to join the girl group Bardot. The group achieved instant success with the No. 1 hit \"Poison\" and its No. 1 debut album, headlined its own national tour and performed at the 2000 ARIA Awards in which it was nominated for three awards. Underwood travelled to New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan and the UK, promoting with Bardot. In early 2001 she decided to leave the group in pursuit of a role in the Harry M. Miller's production of Hair. Unfortunately for Underwood, the production fell through due to financial problems. Underwood later spoke of the deep depression she fell into as a result of what most people thought was a foolish career decision, despite the fact that Bardot's commercial success after her departure was muted. She subsequently turned the tables and made a successful comeback, earning respect from entertainment critics for her resilience. Focusing on her passion for the clubbing scene and dance music, Underwood returned to the spotlight in May 2002, collaborating with Australian dance duo Disco Montego, resulting in the Top 10 ARIA hit \"Beautiful\" and its follow-up \"Magic\". At this time, she also appeared on the series Undercover Angels, a reality TV show which aimed to give a helping hand to people in need. She released her first solo single \"Danger\" in September 2003 which peaked at No. 33 on the singles chart and took a two-year break in which no music was released. In June 2006, Underwood re-emerged with dance act T-Funk on the track \"Be Together\", topping the ARIA Club charts for five consecutive weeks. It peaked at No. 31 on the mainstream singles chart. The music video of this track directed by Bangladeshi born Australian director Zayed Rizwan AKA Silk was nominated in the best music video category in Aria Awards 2007. In November 2009, Underwood self-released her debut studio album called Ain\u2019t Nobody\u2019s Baby According to Sunshine Coast Daily, she makes rare musical appearances in Melbourne. ==Acting career== In 2007 Underwood confirmed her plans to star in a new musical called Dark Angels, based on the story of a bisexual burlesque star, and a lesbian film called Submerge. She said she would have no problem with the leading roles because of her own lesbian experimentation. Dark Angels played in Melbourne during 2007. Submerge, directed by Sophie O'Connor, was due to be shot in January 2009. In 2009 Underwood toured in a new musical, David Tydd's Valentino (about Rudolph Valentino), with fellow Bardot member Tiffani Wood, and Normie Rowe.5 January 2009 Bardot's Tiffani and Katie unite The Daily Telegraph ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Ain't Nobody's Baby (November 2009) ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"text-align:center; width:auto;\"|Year ! style=\"text-align:left;\"|Single ! style=\"text- align:center; width:80px;\"|AUS peak position ! style=\"text- align:left;\"|Certification ! style=\"text-align:left;\"|Album |- !colspan=5|Solo |- | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\"|2003 | style=\"text- align:left; vertical-align:top;\"|\"Danger\" | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"|33 | | style=\"text-align:center; vertical- align:top;\"|Single-only |- !colspan=5|Featured vocalist |- | style=\"text- align:center; vertical-align:middle;\"|1999 | style=\"text-align:left; vertical- align:top;\"|\"Don't Be Afraid\" with Terra Ferma | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"|\u2013 | | style=\"text-align:center;\"|The Adventures of... |- | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\" rowspan=\"3\"|2002 | style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"|\"Beautiful\" with Disco Montego | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"|9 |ARIA: Gold | style=\"text- align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Disco Montego |- | style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"|\"Magic\" with Disco Montego | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"|22 |- | style=\"text-align:left; vertical- align:top;\"|\"Good Times\" with Disco Montego, Selwyn, Peta Morris and Jeremy Gregory | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"|52 | | style=\"text- align:center; vertical-align:top;\"|Single-only |- | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\"|2006 | style=\"text-align:left; vertical- align:top;\"|\"Be Together\" with T-Funk | style=\"text-align:center; vertical- align:top;\"|31 | | style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"|Single-only |- !colspan=5|Group collaborations |- | style=\"text-align:center; vertical- align:middle;\" rowspan=\"3\"|2000 | style=\"text-align:left; vertical- align:top;\"|\"Poison\" with Bardot | style=\"text-align:center; vertical- align:top;\"|1 |ARIA: 2\u00d7 platinum | style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"|Bardot |- | style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"|\"I Should've Never Let You Go\" with Bardot | style=\"text-align:center; vertical- align:top;\"|14 |ARIA: Gold |- | style=\"text-align:left; vertical- align:top;\"|\"These Days with Bardot | style=\"text-align:center; vertical- align:top;\"|19 |ARIA: Gold |- | style=\"text-align:center; vertical- align:middle;\"|2004 | style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"|\"Twelve Days of Christmas\" with Dreamtime Christmas All-Stars | style=\"text- align:center; vertical-align:top;\"|26 | | style=\"text-align:center; vertical- align:top;\"|Single-only |} == References == == External links == * Official Site * * Empire Records * Studio 52 Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:APRA Award winners Category:Australian dance musicians Category:Australian female singer-songwriters Category:Bardot (Australian band) members Category:Bisexual musicians Category:Bisexual women Category:LGBT musicians from Australia Category:Musicians from Adelaide Category:Singers from Melbourne Category:21st-century Australian singers Category:21st-century Australian women singers ",
