When the dust settled, they saw they had opened up a small room, approximately 4 ft tall, 4 ft wide, and about 15 ft deep. This is where they said that they first saw the mummy of a tiny person. This first mummy was examined using X-rays which determined that it was the body of an anencephalic infant \"whose cranial deformity gave it the appearance of a miniature adult.\" A second mummy examined by University of Wyoming anthropologist George Gill and the Denver Children's Hospital in the 1990s was also shown to be an anencephalic infant. DNA testing showed it to be Native American and radiocarbon dating dated it to about 1700. According to a July 7, 1979, article in the Casper Star-Tribune the first mummy started debates over whether it was a hoax, a baby, or one of the legendary \"little people\". The mummy ended up in Meeteetse, Wyoming at a local drug store where it was shown as an attraction for several years before it was bought by Ivan T. Goodman, a Casper, Wyoming businessman. The mummy was then passed on to Leonard Wadler, a New York businessman, and its present location is unknown. Seeking to prove evolution wrong, an offer of a $10,000 reward was made for the person who finds the missing mummy according to the Casper Star-Tribune. ==See also== * Shoshone * Nimerigar ==References== * Photo of mummy ==External links== * * Category:Mummies Category:Shoshone Category:Archaeology of the United States Category:Pseudoarchaeology Category:Out-of-place artifacts Category:Forteana Category:History of Wyoming ",
