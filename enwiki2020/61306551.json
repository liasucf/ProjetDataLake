However, after they learned that ZAIA had been using them, the cyber-terrorists aimed to fight them as well while keep Hiden Manufacturing from interfering. After the Ark\u2019s manifestation as Kamen Rider Ark-Zero, MetsubouJinrai.net initially adjusted their plans towards enslaving humanity until Aruto helped them achieve a unique form of singularity, leading to the cyber-terrorists defecting from the Ark.
