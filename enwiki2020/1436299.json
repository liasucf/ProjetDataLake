Hart biography at Arlington Cemetery website He attended the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, graduating 13th in a class of 47 in 1897.

During the Spanish\u2013American War, Massachusetts became part of the American fleet blockading the Spanish squadron at Santiago de Cuba. Hart received a letter of commendation for his command of a steam cutter dispatched to reconnoiter Cabanas Bay for possible landing sites. Under a withering fusillade of fire from Spanish shore batteries, Hart completed the mission and returned his craft to the ship without any casualties although the skiff was struck several times. Because of his ship handling skills, Hart was sent to augment the crew of a converted yacht, Thomas C. Hart biography at Naval History and Heritage Command under Lt. Alexander Sharp Jr. and executive officer Ensign Arthur MacArthur III, older brother of Douglas MacArthur. The three quickly became lifelong friends. Following the Spanish\u2013American War, Hart spent two years on the sloop-of-war USS Hartford, after which he was posted to the Naval Academy, where he taught ordnance and gunnery for two years. While at Annapolis, he courted Miss Caroline Brownson, daughter of Rear Admiral and Mrs. Willard H.
