In Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, edited by H. C. G. Matthew and Brian Harrison. Oxford: OUP, 2004. Online ed., edited by David Cannadine, 2004. http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13874 ==Early life== Houston was born in 1802 in what is now Northern Ireland. He was the eldest son of a Presbyterian minister but was adopted by his maternal uncle, Joseph Taylor, who was an army doctor. Taylor offered to fund Houston's education and on 13 January 1819 Houston moved to Dublin as apprentice to John Shekleton, a surgeon and curator at the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI). Houston completed his apprenticeship in 1824, passing his final examinations and receiving his letters testimonial. On 19 June 1826, he was elected a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland days after the sudden death of his mentor Shekleton. Houston graduated from Edinburgh with a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1826. ==Career== Houston succeeded Shekleton as conservator (curator) at the RCSI museum. In 1830, Houston discovered the transverse folds of the rectum, eponymously known as Houston's valves. In 1834, he published a catalogue of the Museum's normal specimens, followed by a catalogue of pathology specimens in 1840. In 1843, he published a catalogue of the museum specimens at the Park Street School of Medicine. In 1844, Houston published an illustrated scientific paper in the Dublin Medical Press entitled \"On the Microscopic Pathology of Cancer (with a Woodcut)\" and is credited with introducing the microscope to Irish medicine. RCSI paid him \u00a3150 for his preparation of anatomical specimens. During his 17-year tenure as curator, Houston expanded and catalogued the RCSI museum's extensive specimen collection, described as \"one of the most valuable in Europe\" by renowned anatomists Friedrich Tiedemann and Jules Germain Cloquet.http://rcsiheritage.blogspot.ie/2014/05/skeletons-specimens-and- shekleton.htmlhttps://archive.org/stream/b21443348/b21443348_djvu.txt Houston had a keen interest in teaching, working as an anatomy demonstrator at RCSI in 1824 and in 1837 taking a position as lecturer in surgery at the Park Street School of Medicine.The Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science August 1846, Volume 2, Issue 1, p 294.
