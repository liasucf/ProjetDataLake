In retribution, Vittal Rao (Prakash Raj), a drug smuggler who had masterminded the scam, kidnaps Diwakar's son Vasu (Aman Abdullah). He is willing to release Vasu if Diwakar can return to him a bag of cocaine that he seized while thwarting the scam. Without any options, Diwakar agrees and proceeds to Vittal's nightclub, where Vasu is held hostage with the bag of cocaine, hiding it in the men's toilet. However, this is noticed by his colleague Mallika (Trisha), who becomes suspicious. Thinking that Diwakar is involved in drug smuggling, she informs her superior Dhiraviyam (Kishore). Both begin to pursue Diwakar, taking away the bag of cocaine from the toilet in the process. When Diwakar realizes that the bag of cocaine has gone missing, he decides to return to Vittal a bag containing packets of maida instead, thinking that he and his cronies, including a gangster named Pedha Babu (Sampath Raj), will not realize the difference. Unfortunately, Vittal and Pedha soon find out that Diwakar had cheated them and decide to kill him. Caught between Vittal's gang on one side and Mallika and Dhiraviyam on the other side, Diwakar confronts Mallika and tells her that contrary to her suspicions, he is working undercover and had planned the entire operation to expose police officers such as Dhiraviyam and even Mani, who are involved in drug smuggling. Then, Diwakar rescues Vasu without Vittal's knowledge, and Vittal is also arrested by Mallika and Dhiraviyam. While taking Vittal to prison, Mallika finds out that she has Mani's mobile phone, and on reading the messages in it, she finds out that Diwakar had been speaking the truth all along, realizing that Dhiraviyam and Mani are involved in drug smuggling and had tried to frame Diwakar. Though Dhiraviyam tries to resist arrest, killing Vittal in the process, he is eventually brought to justice. Three months later, Mallika is now Diwakar's deputy. The movie ends with both of them thwarting the attempted murder of a police officer. ==Cast== * Kamal Haasan as CK Diwakar IRS * Prakash Raj as Vittal Rao * Trisha as Mallika * Kishore as Dhiraviyam * Sampath Raj as Pedha Babu * Yugi Sethu as Mani * Asha Sharath as Dr. Sujatha, Ck Diwakar's wife * Aman Abdullah as Vasu Diwakar * Madhu Shalini as Esther (nurse) * Jagan as Jagan * Uma Riyaz Khan as Maheswari * Guru Somasundaram as Duraipandian * Santhana Bharathi as Thandapani (Tamil version) * * Chaams as Chef * Suka as Mandhiramoorthy * Rajesh Selva as Head Chef ==Production== ===Pre- production=== Kamal Haasan announced that his next project, a bilingual thriller titled Thoongaa Vanam in Tamil, and it would be directed by his former assistant Rajesh Selva and produced by himself.

Saraswathi of Rediff appreciated the performances of the lead cast as well as the film's technical aspects but criticised the lack of pace in the film's screenplay before concluding \"the intriguing plot, good performances, Ghibran's innovative background score and camera angles of Sanu Varghese make director Rajesh M. Selva's worth a watch.\" M. Suganth of The Times of India also rated the film 3/5 and wrote, \"even though the film cleverly spreads the action across various areas in the club [...] it isn't enough to shake off the feeling of claustrophobia. By the time the film gets over, we feel exhausted.\" Entertainment website Behindwoods rated it 2.75/5 mentioning it as \"There are thrills and surprises worth experiencing in this Thoongavanam\", but also wrote \"If one has to complain, it must be about the slight slow pace of the movie\", a contradictory statement when compared with general opinion.

Rating it 3/5 stars, Pravallika Anjuri of filmibeat stated that, even though the film is not up to the standard of an edgy or racy thriller, the performance of artistes, ideal run time and presentation makes it a must watch. 123 Telugu gave the film a rating of 3.25/5 stars, calling it as a slick action thriller with interesting moments going its way with a racy first half, concluding as the film is a must watch for those who like action thrillers and for the rest, the film is a decent watch.
