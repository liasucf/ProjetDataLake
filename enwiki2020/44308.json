Called Olbia in the Roman age, Civita in the Middle Ages (Judicates period) and Terranova Pausania before the 1940s, Olbia was again the official name of the city during the fascist period. == Geography == It is the economic centre of this part of the island (commercial centres, food industry) and is very close to the Costa Smeralda tourist area. It was one of the administrative capitals of the province of Olbia-Tempio, operative since 2005 and canceled after a referendum seven years later. Olbia is a tourist destination thanks to its sea and beaches and also for the large number of places of cultural interest to visit. == History == Although the name is of Greek origin, due to the Greek presence during the 7th century B.C., the city of Olbia was first settled by Phoenicians, according to the archaeological findings. It contains ruins from the Nuragic era to the Roman era, when it was an important port, and the Middle Ages, when it was the capital of the Giudicato of Gallura, one of the four independent states of Sardinia. During the First Punic War, the Romans fought against the Carthaginians and the Sardinians near Olbia, where the general Hanno died in battle. From 1113 it was the episcopal see of the Diocese of Civit\u00e0 (succeeding to the Diocese of Gallura, the 1070 restoration of the Diocese of Fausania, 500\u2013750), which was renamed in 1839 as Diocese of Civita\u2013Tempio until its formal suppression in favor of (in fact merger into) the Diocese of Tempio\u2013Ampurias (also integrating the Diocese of Ampurias, which was in personal union with the see of Civita from 1506) == Main sights == * Romanesque former cathedral of San Simplicio (11th\u201312th century). * Church of St. Paul Apostle (medieval) * National Archaeology Museum * Pedres Castle *Several dolmens and a menhir *Several nuraghes *Remains of the Roman forum and aqueduct *Remains of Carthaginian walls *Fausto Noce park, the largest in Sardinia *River park of Padrongianus ==Sport== Olbia Calcio 1905 represents Olbia in Serie C, the third division of Italian football. == Transport == Olbia Airport departures area Olbia is the main connection between Sardinia and the Italian peninsula, with an airport (Olbia \u2013 Costa Smeralda), a passenger port (Olbia-Isola Bianca), and a railway from Olbia railway station to Porto Torres, Golfo Aranci and Cagliari.
