    "text": "Whalleyana is an enigmatic genus of moths in the lepidopteran group Obtectomera,Obtectomera endemic to Madagascar. The genus contains two species, whose biology and closest relatives are unknown. The genus had been placed in the picture-winged leaf moths, (Thyrididae), but then was placed in its own family (Minet, 1991), and later elevated to its own superfamily (Dugdale et al., 1999: 229-230); see also F\u00e4nger (2004). The genus was named after Paul E. S. Whalley, a British entomologist. ==References== *Dugdale, J.S., Kristensen, N.P., Robinson, G.S. and Scoble, M.J. (1999). The non-Glossatan Moths.
