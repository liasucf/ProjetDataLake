On July 3, 2006, the day after winning the fight against Larios, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo personally bestowed the Order of Lakandula with the rank of \"Champion for Life\" (Kampeon Habambuhay) and the plaque of appreciation to Pacquiao in a simple ceremony at the Presidential Study of Malaca\u00f1ang Palace. ==Reception== Many people criticized the bout for its expensive tickets. A few days before the fight, more than half of the seats were not sold. Because of this, ABS-CBN gave away millions worth of tickets for free and offered the remaining tickets directly to Filipino celebrities, politicians, and businessmen. In the end, the tickets were sold out with an earning of 96.2 million pesos. The fight sold 120,000 pay per view (PPV) in the United States generating a total of US$4.79 million. The bout is currently the 17th most watched television broadcasts in the Philippines with a rating of 54.4% based on the data of AGB Nielsen Philippines. ==References== Larios Category:2006 in boxing Category:Boxing in the Philippines Category:Boxing in Asia Category:July 2006 sports events in Asia ",
