    "text": "Solid Action is an album by American jazz reedist Ken Vandermark, which was recorded in 1994 and released on Platypus. It was the second record by the Vandermark Quartet, which includes bassist Kent Kessler, drummer Michael Zerang and multi-instrumentalist Daniel Scanlan replacing former guitarist Todd Colburn.Original Liner Notes by John Corbett ==Reception== In his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek states \"Listening to this music now is breathtaking; it feels shamanic and brave and it engages the listener immediately with the force of both conviction and humor.\" The Penguin Guide to Jazz claims \"Solid Action is Vandermark's first shot at greatness, with Scanlan a tremendously exciting figure on all of three of his instruments.\" The Down Beat review by Bill Shoemaker says \"This band's second outing is a persuasive statement of Vandermark's ability to harness rock's gut-rending intensity to post-Coleman jazz's quest for liberating new structures.\"Shoemaker, Bill.
