Since Doxan grew up in a Kurdish musician family and was raised with traditional Kurdish music, he also decided to become a musician. At the beginning of the 1990s he started his career with percussion instruments. After learning keyboard and Saz, he started singing. In early 1995, he participated in a music festival for young musicians from Syria and won the first prize. In 2004 he released his first album entitled \"Rebene\". He then gave several concerts and worked on his second album, which he released in 2008 under the title \"Dildaro\". In March 2009 he fled to Germany for political reasons. Doxan returned to the studio in 2013 and released the album \"Hest\u00ean d\u00fbr\u00eey\u00ea\" after one year of work in 2014. After producing three albums, Doxan worked with various composers such as Ron\u00ee Doxan and Elend\u00ea \u00dbsiv, who had composed one of his most famous songs \"Bo \u00e7i\" for him, and published them on the market. Doxan currently lives in Hanover and performs at concerts all over Europe and is one of the most famous Kurdish singers from Syria. == References == Category:Syrian singers Category:Syrian refugees Category:Kurdish-language singers Category:Kurdish musicians Category:Kurdish people Category:1984 births Category:Living people ",
