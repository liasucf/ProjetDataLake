    "text": "Amy Reed McCune is an American ecologist and evolutionary biologist. She is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Cornell University. McCune specializes in the history of life through the study of fishes. Her lab focuses on evolution with methodologies including paleobiology, phylogentics, genetics and morphology. McCune was appointed Senior Associate Dean of the Cornell College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in 2017. McCune is also a Faculty Curator of Ichthyology at the Cornell Museum of Vertebrates. == Education == McCune received a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) in biology from Brown University in 1976. McCune received a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in biology from Yale University in 1982. McCune was a Miller Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley (1982\u20131983). == Career == McCune became an assistant professor at Cornell University in 1983. McCune served as the chair of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from 2011 to 2017. McCune is also a faculty curator of fishes at the Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates. == Selected publications == * Lencer, E. S., M. Riccio and A. R. McCune. 2016.
