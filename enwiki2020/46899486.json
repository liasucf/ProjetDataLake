    "text": "Trans Day of Action (TDOA) began in 2005 and is an annual rally and march held in late June in New York City. It is organized by the Audre Lorde Project's Trans Justice group. It aims \"to call attention to the continued violence, discrimination and institutionalization of our people [Trans and Gender Non- Conforming people], while simultaneously lifting up and celebrating our legacy of resilience, organizing, and community building.\" While addressing issues that disproportionately impact trans and gender non-conforming people, TDOA is also meant to honor and contribute to the broader \"struggle for justice, liberation, and recognition for all oppressed people worldwide.\" In its first year, TDOA drew over 1,000 participants. The 2016 event gathered 2,000 attendees in Washington Square, and included speakers such as Olympia Perez of the Audre Lorde Project, Jennifer Louise Lopez of Everything Transgender in NYC, and Jennicet Guti\u00e9rrez of Familia Trans Queer Liberation Movement. TDOA is supported by a range of organizations, including SALGA (South Asian Lesbian and Gay Association) and GLAAD (formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation). The event is highly inter-sectional, as \"TGNC communities include communities of color, immigrants, youth, elders, rural communities, and differently abled communities... as TGNC communities of color, we view our struggles as one and the same as broader struggles for social justice domestically and directly connected\u2014if not the same as\u2014struggles for social justice globally.\" == References == == See also == *International Transgender Day of Visibility Category:LGBT pride Category:Transgender history in the United States Category:Awareness days ",
