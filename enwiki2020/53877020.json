    "text": "The Wych Elm cultivar Ulmus glabra 'Concavaefolia' (Fontaine, 1968), a form with up-curling leaves, was listed in Beissner's Handbuch der Laubholz- Benennung (1903) as Ulmus montana cucullata Hort. [:'hooded', the leaf],Beissner, Ludwig, Handbuch der Laubholz-Benennung (Berlin 1903), p.86 a synonym of the Ulmus scabra Mill. [:glabra Huds.] var. concavaefolia of herbarium specimens.naturalis.nl, specimen WAG.1853027 An Ulmus campestris cucullata, of uncertain species, had appeared in Loddiges' 1823 list, but Loudon's brief description (1838) of concave- and hooded-leaved elmsArboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum, 3: 1378, 1838 was insufficient for later botanists to distinguish them. The earliest unambiguous description appears to be that of Petzold and Kirchner in Arboretum Muscaviense (1864).Petzold and Kirchner in Arboretum Muscaviense (Gotha, 1864), p.557 Not to be confused with the field elm cultivar 'Webbiana', which also has longitudinally-folded, up- curling leaves (though smaller, shallower-toothed, and with longer petiole), or with concave-leaved field elms with down-curling leaves (see U. minor 'Concavaefolia' and U. minor 'Cucullata'). ==Description== Petzold and Kirchner in Arboretum Muscaviense (1864) described the leaves of their Ulmus campestris cucullata as rough, up-curving, and bicorne-shaped, being longer and more \"closed\" than those of their Ulmus campestris concavaefolia (the description of which matches 'Webbiana'). The twigs had scattered hairs. The Kissena nurseries (Parsons & Sons) of New York (1903) described the leaves of their Ulmus campestris cucullata as \"deeply curled like a hood, and sharply notched along the edges\". Both descriptions match the U. glabra Huds. 'Concavaefolia' of Fontaine (1968), with its leaf folded lengthwise along the midrib, making it more or less tubular. Herbarium specimens (see 'External links') show an up-curling wych leaf with a shorter petiole, more deeply toothed margin, and more acuminate apex than 'Webbiana'. The samara was confirmed by the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 2017 as U. glabra Huds..Correspondence with RBGE, 2017 File:Ulmus.

The stock, now 3 m in girth (2016), flushes before the scion on a few ascending branches and bole shoots. It produces no suckers. File:Foliage of Ulmus.
