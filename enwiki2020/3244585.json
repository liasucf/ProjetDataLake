Population: ==History== Until the 1890s, Kolyvan was the commercial center of the surrounding area. During the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway in the 1890s, there were plans to route the railroad through Kolyvan and Tomsk. However, Konstantin Garin-Mikhaylovsky, the engineer responsible for routing the railroad in the area, decided that a site at the village of Krivoshchyokovo, some upstream from Kolyvan, would be much more suitable for bridge construction: that was the only spot within the area where both the river banks and river bed were of solid rock; besides, the Ob floodplain is the narrowest there as way. Despite the protests of Kolyvan and Tomsk merchants, Garin-Mikhailovsky's southern route was approved by Alexander III in 1892. The bridge was built at Krivoshchekovo; the new city of Novo-Nikolayevsk (later renamed Novosibirsk) arose around the bridge, and eventually became Siberia's largest city, meanwhile Kolyvan stagnated. ==Culture== The majority of the log houses in Kolyvan are over two hundred years old, making the settlement a historical monument in itself. Works by Kolyvan craftsmen are exhibited in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. Local attractions include a museum of local history and a Russian Orthodox convent. ==Architecture== File:\u0414\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0446\u0430 \u0424.\u041a. \u041a\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0446\u043e\u0432\u0430.jpg|Krivtsov House File:\u041f\u0420\u0415\u0414\u041f\u041e\u041b\u041e\u0416\u0418\u0422\u0415\u041b\u042c\u041d\u041e \u041d\u0410\u0427\u0410\u041b\u041e \u0445\u0445 \u0412\u0415\u041a\u0410.jpg File:\u0414\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0446\u0430 \u041e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430.jpg|Orlov House File:\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044c, \u0443\u043b.\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f, 41.jpg|Krotkov House File:\u0414\u0415\u0420\u0415\u0412\u042f\u041d\u041d\u041e\u0415 \u0417\u041e\u0414\u0427\u0415\u0421\u0422\u0412\u041e \u041d\u0410\u0427\u0410\u041b\u041e \u0425\u0425 \u0412\u0415\u041a\u0410. \u041f.\u041a\u041e\u041b\u042b\u0412\u0410\u041d\u042c \u041d\u041e\u0412\u041e\u0421\u0418\u0411\u0418\u0420\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u041e\u0411\u041b\u0410\u0421\u0422\u0418.jpg File:\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 XX \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430. \u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b.jpg File:\u0414\u043e\u043c \u041f\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0413\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430.jpg \u041a\u043e\u043b\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044c \u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430.jpg ==Notable residents== * Vladimir Zhernakov was a Russian merchant, public figure and politician, serving as the first city head of Novonikolyevsk, from 1909 to 1914. ==References== ==External links== *Petr Marsakov, \"From the Early History of Novo-Nikolayevsk - Novosibirsk Gornitsa (magazine), Novosibirsk, 1995, No. 3, p. 54-56.
