    "text": "Eupolemus (in Greek E\u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bco\u03c2; lived 4th century BC) was one of the generals of Cassander; he was sent by him in 314 BC to invade Caria, but was surprised and taken prisoner by Ptolemy, a general who commanded that province for Antigonus. He must have been liberated again directly, as the next year (313 BC) we find him commanding the forces left by Cassander in Greece, when he moved northward against Antigonus. ==References== *Smith, William (editor); Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \"Eupolemus (1)\", Boston, (1867) ==Notes== \\---- Category:4th-century BC Macedonians Category:Antipatrid generals Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ",
