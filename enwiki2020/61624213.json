    "text": "Cybernetics\u2014in the Service of Communism was the title of a symposium and accompanying publication sponsored by Aksel Berg, a prominent promoter of cybernetics in the Soviet Union. He provided an eponymous introduction noted for its length and programmatic nature. The symposium was held in 1961, prior to the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, where cybernetics was declared the one of the \"major tools of the creation of a communist society\". ==The response from the USA== An American organizational theorist, Donald G. Malcolm, remarked: \u201cIf any country were to achieve a completely integrated and controlled economy in which \u2018cybernetic\u2019 principles were applied to achieve various goals, the Soviet Union would be ahead of the United States in reaching such a state\u201d.Malcolm, D. G. Operations Research 11, no. 6 (1963): 1007-012. http://www.jstor.org/stable/167842. He also suggested that cybernetics \u201cmay be one of the weapons Khrushchev had in mind when he threatened to \u2018bury\u2019 the West\u201d. As a result of such concerns the Central Intelligence Agency established a special unit to study the Soviet cybernetics. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:Cybernetics Category:Science and technology in the Soviet Union Category:1961 in the Soviet Union ",
