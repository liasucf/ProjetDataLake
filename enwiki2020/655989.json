    "text": "Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ Clifford James Geertz (; August 23, 1926 \u2013 October 30, 2006) was an American anthropologist who is remembered mostly for his strong support for and influence on the practice of symbolic anthropology, and who was considered \"for three decades...the single most influential cultural anthropologist in the United States.\"Shweder, Richard A., and Byron Good, eds. 2005. Clifford Geertz by His Colleagues. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. He served until his death as professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. ==Life and career== Geertz was born in San Francisco on August 23, 1926. After service in the US Navy in World War II (1943\u201345), Geertz received his B.A. in philosophy from Antioch College in 1950. He would then attend Harvard University, graduating in 1956 as a student in the Department of Social Relations, an interdisciplinary program led by Talcott Parsons. As such, Geertz would work with Parsons, as well as Clyde Kluckhohn, training as an anthropologist. Geertz would conduct his first long-term fieldwork together with his wife, Hildred, in Java, Indonesia, a project funded by the Ford Foundation and MIT. He would also study the religious life of a small, upcountry town for two-and-a-half years, living with a railroad laborer's family.Geertz, Clifford. 2001. Available Light: Anthropological Reflections on Philosophical Topics. Princeton: Princeton University Press. After finishing his thesis, Geertz returned to Indonesia, in Bali and Sumatra, after which he would receive his Ph.D. in 1956 with a dissertation entitled Religion in Modjokuto: A Study of Ritual Belief In A Complex Society. Throughout his life, Geertz received honorary doctorate degrees from around fifteen colleges and universities, including Harvard, Cambridge, and the University of Chicago; as well as awards such as the Association for Asian Studies' (AAS) 1987 Award for Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies.Association for Asian Studies (AAS), 1987 Award for Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies; retrieved 2011-05-31 Following his divorce from anthropologist Hildred Geertz, his first wife, he would marry Karen Blu, another anthropologist. === Teaching === He taught or held fellowships at a number of schools before joining the faculty of the anthropology department at the University of Chicago in 1960. In this period Geertz expanded his focus on Indonesia to include both Java and Bali and produced three books, including Religion of Java (1960), Agricultural Involution (1963), and Peddlers and Princes (also 1963). In the mid-1960s, he shifted course and began a new research project in Morocco that resulted in several publications, including Islam Observed (1968), which compared Indonesia and Morocco. In 1970, Geertz left Chicago to become professor of social science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey from 1970 to 2000, then as emeritus professor. In 1973, he published The Interpretation of Cultures, which collected essays Geertz had published throughout the 1960s. That became Geertz's best-known book and established him not just as an Indonesianist but also as an anthropological theorist. In 1974, he edited the anthology Myth, Symbol, Culture that contained papers by many important anthropologists on symbolic anthropology. Geertz produced ethnographic pieces in this period, such as Kinship in Bali (1975), Meaning and Order in Moroccan Society (1978; written collaboratively with Hildred Geertz and Lawrence Rosen) and Negara (1981). ===Later life=== From the 1980s to his death, Geertz wrote more theoretical and essayistic pieces, including book reviews for the New York Review of Books. As a result, most of his books of the period are collections of essays\u2014books including Local Knowledge (1983), Available Light (2000), and Life Among The Anthros (2010), which was published posthumously. He would also produced a series of short essays on the stylistics of ethnography in Works and Lives (1988), while other works include the autobiographical After The Fact (1995). Geertz conducted extensive ethnographic research in Southeast Asia and North Africa. This fieldwork was the basis of Geertz's famous analysis of the Balinese cockfight among others. While holding a position in Chicago in the 1960s, he would be director of a multidisciplinary project titled Committee for the Comparative Studies of New Nations. As part of the project, Geertz conducted fieldwork in Morocco on \"bazaars, mosques, olive growing and oral poetry,\" collecting ethnographic data that would be used for his famous essay on thick description.Geertz, Clifford. 1973. \"Thick Description: Towards an Interpretive Theory of Culture.\" Pp. 3\u201330 in The Interpretation of Cultures. New York: Basic Books. Geertz contributed to social and cultural theory and is still influential in turning anthropology toward a concern with the frames of meaning within which various peoples live their lives. He reflected on the basic core notions of anthropology, such as culture and ethnography. He would eventually die of complications following heart surgery on October 30, 2006. At the time of his death, Geertz was working on the general question of ethnic diversity and its implications in the modern world. == Main ideas, contributions, and influences == Geertz's often-cited essay \"Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight\" is a classic example of thick description, a concept adopted from the British philosopher Gilbert Ryle which comes from ordinary language philosophy. Thick description is an anthropological method of explaining with as much detail as possible the reason behind human actions.Ryle, Gilbert. 1996 [1968]. \"The Thinking of Thoughts: What is 'Le Penseur' Doing?.\" Studies in Anthropology 11. UK: Centre for Social Anthropology and Computing, University of Kent. Archived from the original on 2014-12-21. . Many human actions can mean many different things, and Geertz insisted that the anthropologist needs to be aware of this. The work proved influential amongst historians, many of whom tried to use these ideas about the 'meaning' of cultural practice in the study of customs and traditions of the past. Another of Geertz's philosophical influences is that of Ludwig Wittgenstein's post-analytic philosophy, from which Geertz incorporates the concept of family resemblances into anthropology. Geertz would also introduce anthropology to the \"umwelt-mitwelt- vorwelt-folgewelt\" formulation of Alfred Sch\u00fctz's phenomenology,Geertz, Clifford. 1993 [1973]. The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays. London: Fontana Press. stressing that the links between the \"consociate,\" \"contemporary,\" \"predecessor,\" and \"successor\" that are commonplace in anthropology derive from this very formulation. At the University of Chicago, Geertz became a champion of symbolic anthropology, a framework which gives prime attention to the role of symbols in constructing public meaning. In his seminal work The Interpretation of Cultures (1973), Geertz outlined culture as \"a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life.\" He was one of the earliest scholars to see that the insights provided by common language, philosophy and literary analysis could have major explanatory force in the social sciences. Geertz aimed to provide the social sciences with an understanding and appreciation of \u201cthick description.\u201d Geertz applied thick description to anthropological studies, particularly to his own 'interpretive anthropology', urging anthropologists to consider the limitations placed upon them by their own cultural cosmologies when attempting to offer insight into the cultures of other people. He produced theory that had implications for other social sciences; for example, Geertz asserted that culture was essentially semiotic in nature, and this theory has implications for comparative political sciences. Max Weber and his interpretative social science are strongly present in Geertz\u2019s work. Drawing from Weber, Geertz himself argues for a \u201csemiotic\u201d concept of culture:Geertz, Clifford. 1973. The Interpretation of Cultures. New York: Basic Books. > Believing\u2026that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself > has spun\u2026I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be > therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretative > one in search of meaning. It is explication I am after, construing social > expression on their surface enigmatical. (p.5) Geertz argues that to interpret a culture\u2019s web of symbols, scholars must first isolate its elements, specifying the internal relationships among those elements and characterize the whole system in some general way according to the core symbols around which it is organized, the underlying structures of which it is a surface expression, or the ideological principles upon which it is based. It was his view that culture is public, because \u201cmeaning is,\u201d and systems of meanings are what produce culture, because they are the collective property of a particular people. We cannot discover the culture\u2019s import or understand its systems of meaning, when, as Wittgenstein noted, \u201cwe cannot find our feet with them.\u201d Geertz wants society to appreciate that social actions are larger than themselves: > It is not against a body of uninterrupted data, radically thinned > descriptions, that we must measure the cogency of our explications, but > against the power of the scientific imagination to bring us into touch with > the lives of strangers.\u201d In seeking to converse with subjects in foreign cultures and gain access to their conceptual world, this is the goal of the semiotic approach to culture. Cultural theory is not its own master; at the end of the day we must appreciate, that the generality \u201cthick description\u201d contrives to achieve, grows out of the delicacy of its distinctions, not the sweep of its abstraction. The essential task of theory-building here is not to codify abstract regularities, but to make thick description possible; not to generalize across cases, but to generalize within them. Cockfight in Bali During Geertz's long career he worked through a variety of theoretical phases and schools of thought. He would reflect an early leaning toward functionalism in his essay \"Ethos, Worldview and the Analysis of Sacred Symbols\", writing that \"the drive to make sense out of experience, to give it form and order, is evidently as real and pressing as the more familiar biological needs.\" ==Legacy== Geertz's research and ideas have had a strong influence on 20th- century academia, including modern anthropology and communication studies, as well as for geographers, ecologists, political scientists, scholars of religion, historians, and other humanists. University of Miami Professor Daniel Pals (1996) wrote of Geertz that \"his critics are few; his admirers legion.\" Talal Asad attacked the dualism in Geertzian theory: the theory does not provide a bridge between external symbols and internal dispositions. Asad also pointed out the need for a more nuanced approach toward the historical background of certain concepts.Asad, Talal (1983). Anthropological Concepts of Religion: Reflections on Geertz. Man (N.S.) 18:237-59. Criticizing Geertz's theory of religion in general, Asad pointed out a gap between 'cultural system' and 'social reality' when attempting to define the concept of religion in universal terms. He would also criticize Geertz for ascribing an authorizing discourse around conversations of comparative religion that, Asad argues, doesn\u2019t really exist. Furthermore, Asad criticized Geertz for operating according to a eurocentric view of religion that places import on signs and symbols that may or may not carry through in other non Judeo- Christian religious cultures.
