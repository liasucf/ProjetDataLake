    "text": "Copper(II) glycinate (IUPAC suggested name: bis(glycinato)copper(II)) refers to the coordination complex of copper(II) with two equivalents of glycinate, with the formula [Cu(glycinate)2(H2O)x] where x = 1 (monohydrate) or 0 (anhydrous form). The complex was first reported in 1841, and its chemistry has been revisited many times, particularly in relation to the isomerisation reaction between the cis and trans forms which was first reported in 1890. All forms are blue solids, with varying degrees of water solubility. A practical application of the compound is as a source of dietary copper in animal feeds. == Structure == Like most amino acid complexes, the glycinate forms a 5-membered chelate ring, with the glycinato ligand serving as a bidentate (\u03ba2\u039f,\u039d) species. The chelating ligands assume a square planar configuration around the copper atom as is common for tetracoordinate d9 complexes, calculated to be much lower in energy than the alternative tetrahedral arrangement. === Cis and trans isomerism === The unsymmetric nature of the ligand and square planar coordination thereof gives rise to two possible geometric isomers: a cis and a trans form. Multiple ways of differentiating the geometric isomers exist, an easily accesible one being IR spectroscopy with the characteristic number of C\u2013N, C\u2013O, and CuII\u2013N identifying the ligand configuration. Crystal appearance may also be of some value for isomer indication, though the ultimate diagnostic technique is X-ray crystallography. All forms of the complex have been characterized crystallographically, the most commonly isolated one being the cis monohydrate (x = 1). == Synthesis == A typical preparation of bis(glycinato)copper(II) (proceeding through a non- redox dissociative substitution mechanism) involves the heating of a copper(II) acetate solution in 1:1 aqueous ethanol, followed by the addition of aqueous glycine solution. The precipitate collected upon cooling is identified as the cis isomer when prepared in this manner; isomerisation to the trans form occurs at higher temperatures via a ring-twisting mechanism. ==References== Category:Coordination chemistry Category:Copper complexes Category:Glycinates ",
