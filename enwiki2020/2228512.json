It is the longest runic inscription in Uppland and the second longest one in Sweden after the R\u00f6k runestone. ==Description== The inscription on the Hillersj\u00f6 stone, which is 2.8 by 1.0 meters, consists of runic text in the younger futhark that is carved on an intertwined serpent. The main text is written on the serpent with extraneous information, such as the fact that \"\u00deorbj\u00f4rn Skald carved the runes,\" carved outside of the serpent. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The runic text indicates that Gerl\u00f6g married with Germund when she was very young, and they had a son who is not named. Germund drowned and the son died. Then Gerl\u00f6g remarried with Gudrik and they had several children, but only one survived, who was named Inga. Inga married Ragnfast of Snottsta and they had a son who is not named. Both Ragnfast and the son died and so Inga inherited the estate Snottsta. Inga then married Eric, but both soon died without leaving any children. This meant that Gerl\u00f6g inherited her daughter's property. It has been noted that the chain of inheritance documented on the Hillersj\u00f6 stone, including how property passed to women through their children, is consistent with the inheritance rules later codified in the 1296 Uppland Law. This text is completed with information from runestone U 20/U 21, where it is said that both Gudrik (Gerl\u00f6g's second husband and Inga's father) and Eric (Inga's second husband) had died. The estate Snottsta (also spelled Sn\u00e5ttsta) still exists. At Snottsta and the neighboring Vreta there are several other runestones that complete the saga of Inga that are called the Snottsta and Vreta stones. The runic text begins with the imperitive Ra\u00f0 \u00feu! which is translated as \"Interpret!\" Other runestones with similar imperitive exclamations in their runic texts include U 328 in Stora Lundby and S\u00f6 158 in \u00d6sterberga. p. 197. On the Hillersj\u00f6 stone, Ra\u00f0 \u00feu! is carved on the eye of the serpent, perhaps indicating that the stone as a record of inheritance was intended for the public. The inscription is signed by the runemaster \u00deorbj\u00f4rn Skald, who also signed the runestone U 532 at Roslags-Bro. Other inscriptions have been attributed to him, including several stones signed only with \"\u00deorbj\u00f4rn.\" He was likely selected as the runemaster for his composition of the Hillersj\u00f6 stone's text in alliterative verse known as h\u00f6jningar, a traditional style which uses half-lines characterized by two stressed and accented or rising syllables. pp. 30-31. The Stockholm County Museum presents the story of Gerl\u00f6g and Inga as a dramatic real life family saga which was documented for posterity on this runestone sometime between 1060 and 1100.Estrid - Stockholm L\u00e4ns Museum presentation. Local theater associations nearby have conducted plays which recreate the rather dramatic tale of Gerl\u00f6g. ==Transliteration into Latin letters== :ra\u00fe| |\u00feu kai\u0280muntr -ik * kai\u0280[l]a[uk *] (m)aytumi| |i \u00fea * finku * \u00feau sun * a\u00fe han * trukna\u00fei * in sun to : si\u00fean : \u00fea + fi(k) (h)(u)- --\u00ferik * ha- ...
