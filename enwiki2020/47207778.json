    "text": "Miramar National Cemetery is a federal military cemetery in the city of San Diego, California. It is located in the north west corner of the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar on the grounds of old Camp Kearney (1917) and Camp Elliott (1942). Miramar National Cemetery is considered an auxiliary of the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery and is administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. The cemetery is located about north of Downtown San Diego on Nobel Drive between Miramar Road and Interstate 805. ==History== On 30 January 2010, the Department of Veterans Affairs dedicated a new National Cemetery at the northwest corner of MCAS Miramar.; The cemetery is an extension of Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery and when complete will accommodate the remains of approximately 235,000 veterans and spouses. Nearby Fort Rosecrans Cemetery closed to most casket burials in 1966, and prior to Miramar's opening, the only option for casket burials of San Diego region veterans was Riverside National Cemetery. The cemetery design is sensitive to environmental considerations, preserving habitat for endangered California gnatcatchers and fairy shrimp. The first interment occurred in November 2010; the first casket burial occurred in April 2011. The cemetery contains 313 acres dedicated for full casket burials and cremated remains. It has 16 designated areas (not all currently being used) for full casket burials and two Columbarium areas for urn interments. It also has two, \"Committal Service Shelters\" or open sided covered shelters. North of the central \"Avenue of Flags\" is a \"Memorial Walk\" with dedications and benches for reflections. A planned Ossuary is located at the end of the \"Memorial Walk\" and designated as the \"Memorial Plaza.\" The Administration Office has an interior service room and a unique funeral possession lane behind it. Near the entrance is a \"P.O.W. Plaza\" where the bronze memorial to prisoners of war called \"Liberation\" is located. Statue of Coleman at Petco Park. ==Notable burials== Grave marker of Charles Schroeter \u2013 Medal of Honor \u2013 Section 3-1052 \u2013 Miramar National Cemetery ===Medal of Honor recipients=== * Charles Schroeter, Medal of Honor recipient ===Other burials=== * Jerry Coleman, a baseball broadcaster, a former manager of the San Diego Padres, a World Series winning Major League Baseball second baseman for the New York Yankees and a Marine Corps pilot during World War II and the Korean War.High Iron Illustrations, * Rudy Bukich, an American football player, a quarterback in the National Football League who played for fourteen seasons (1953 and 1956 to 1968).

For veterans, benefits may also include a burial flag (with case for active duty), and military funeral honors. Family members and other loved ones of deceased veterans may request Presidential Memorial Certificates. Veterans discharged from active duty under conditions other than dishonorable and servicemembers who die while on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training, as well as spouses and dependent children of veterans and active duty servicemembers, may be eligible for VA burial and memorial benefits including burial in a national cemetery. The veteran does not have to die before a spouse or dependent child can be eligible. Reservists and National Guard members, as well as their spouses and dependent children, are eligible if they were entitled to retired pay at the time of death, or would have been upon reaching requisite age. Burial of dependent children is limited to unmarried children under 21 years of age, or under 23 years of age if a full-time student at an approved educational institution. Unmarried adult children who become physically or mentally disabled and incapable of self- support before age 21, or age 23 if a full-time student, also are eligible for burial. A Federal law passed in 2010 (Public Law 111-275) extends burial benefits to certain parents of servicemembers who die as a result of hostile activity or from combat training-related injuries who are buried in a national cemetery in a gravesite with available space. The biological or adopted parents of a servicemember who dies in combat or while performing training in preparation for a combat mission, leaving no surviving spouse or dependent child, may be buried with the deceased servicemember if the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines that there is available space. The law applies to servicemembers who died on or after Oct. 7, 2001 and to parents who died on or after Oct. 13, 2010.

It was dedicated on Saturday 28 January 2012 with North San Diego County Supervisor Bill Horn, Officers of the United States Armed Forces, representatives of the Department of Veterans Affairs and numerous San Diego and Orange County veterans groups. It was hosted by the Fort Rosecrans and Miramar National Cemetery Support Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, with assistance from a US Marine Corps color guard and band from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. The Support Foundation takes care of flag replacement and repair. It was instrumental in the equipment, purchase and volunteer installation of the flagpoles with proper lighting. Volunteers provide about 1,000 hours of labor by digging trenches, assembling and landscaping. Noteworthy volunteers come from the Boy Scouts of America and Young Marines. They were joined by volunteers from the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and many civilians. ==Gallery== File:MiramarNationalCemetery001.jpg|Liberation statue with POW flag File:MiramarNationalCemetery002.jpg|Liberation plaque \u2013 base of memorial File:MiramarNationalCemetery004.jpg|Columbarium Plaza \u2013 north wall showing Sections H & I File:MiramarNationalCemetery005.jpg|Columbarium urn crypt with American Flag File:MiramarNationalCemetery006.jpg|Avenue of Flags File:MiramarNationalCemetery008.jpg|Jewish War Veterans plaque on the Memorial Walk File:MiramarNationalCemetery009.jpg|US Navy Seabees Memorial on the Memorial Walk File:MiramarNationalCemetery010.jpg|US Navy Nurse Corps plaque on the Memorial Walk File:MiramarNationalCemetery011.jpg|US Navy Nurse Corps memorial image on the Memorial Walk File:MiramarNationalCemetery012.jpg|Blue Star Memorial \u2013 California Garden Club Palomar District \u2013 on the Memorial Walk File:MiramarNationalCemetery013.jpg|Korean War Memorial \u2013 Chosin Reservoir by the San Diego Chapter of the Chosin Few \u2013 on the Memorial Walk File:MiramarNationalCemetery014.jpg|US Army Special Forces Memorial \u2013 on the Memorial Walk File:MiramarNationalCemetery015.jpg|US Army Special Forces Memorial backside showing green Beret \u2013 on the Memorial Walk File:MiramarNationalCemetery018.jpg|Environmental sign \u2013 near the Memorial Walk File:MiramarNationalCemetery019.jpg|Headstones in Area 8 File:MiramarNationalCemetery020.jpg|Headstones in Area 7 File:MiramarNationalCemetery022.jpg|Avenue of Flags near the Flag Assembly area File:MiramarNationalCemetery023.jpg|Committal Service Shelter ==First interments: November 22, 2010== File:USMC-101122-M-2306T-096.jpg|A joint- force color guard stands before the grave sites.
