He is also an attending in neurology at the Geneva University Hospital. L\u00fcscher is known for his contributions in the field addiction, particularly for establishing links of causality between the drug-evoked synaptic plasticity and adaptive behavior in mice. == Early life == L\u00fcscher was born in Bern, Switzerland and grew up there in the lake of Constance area. == Education == L\u00fcscher studied medicine in Lausanne and Berne and obtained his federal diploma in 1990. In his MD degree, he studied the effects of axon morphology on action potential propagation. After clinical residencies at the Inselspital in Bern and the University Hopital in Geneva, he left for a postdoctoral fellowship at UCSF (Advisor Roger Nicoll). He returned to University of Geneva with a career development award of the Swiss National Science Foundation, where he first became associated (2003) and then full professor (2009) == Research == L\u00fcscher studies how addictive drugs alter synaptic transmission in the reward system of the mouse brain. He has proposed a mechanisitic classification of addictive drugs and developed optogenetic stimulation protocols that when applied in a mouse model of addiction can erase adaptive behavior. In his most recent work he explores the molecular basis of individual vulnerability to addiction and launched several translational projects. He has initiated the OptoDBS conference series, seeking to emulate optogenetic innervations with deep brain stimulation. He has been two times awarded with an ERC Advanced Grant (2013 and 2020). == Awards and honors == *2020 Otto Naegeli Prize{{cite web|url=http://www.otto- naegeli-preis.ch/accueil.html|title= 2020 Otto Naegeli Prize} *2019 Schaefer Research Scholar, Columbia University{{cite web|url=https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/2019-schaefer-scholars- announced|title= 2019 Schaefer Research Scholar} *2017 Th\u00e9odore Ott Prize of Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences *2016 Betty and David Koetser Award for Brain Research *2015- Member American College of Neuropsychopharmacology *2015- Member Senate of Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences *2010 Clo\u00ebtta Prize == Key papers == Creed, M, Pascoli V, L\u00fcscher C.
