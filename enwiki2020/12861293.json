    "text": "E-Commerce Place () (CCE) is an office complex of two towers located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is located on Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque Boulevard West between Mountain Street and Lucien L'Allier Street in Downtown Montreal. It derives its name from the fact that its construction was part of a program grant from the Government of Quebec to promote the development of employment in the field of information technology. The complex provided incentives to firms specializing in electronic commerce. ==History== The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government launched the Cit\u00e9 du Multim\u00e9dia in June 1998, which was seen as a relative success of job creation despite the progressive scaling down of the program. In its wake, the government launched the E-Commerce in May 2000. These projects upset members of Montreal's real-estate community and some high-tech entrepreneurs because it forced companies to relocate to E-Commerce Place and Cit\u00e9 Multim\u00e9dia in order to receive tax assistance. Both programs have also been criticized for promoting the construction of buildings rather than the subsidization of employment and, as a result, moving around existing jobs instead of creating new ones. The grant program was cancelled in 2003 following the election of the Quebec Liberal Party. This led to the cancellation of three other planned phases of the E-Commerce Place complex. ==Architecture== The first tower, located at 1350 Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque Boulevard West (corner Mountain Street), has 27 floors and was completed in early 2003. Its primary tenant is CGI Group, an Information technology consulting firm. The second phase tower located at 1360 Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque (corner Lucien L'Allier Street), has 17 floors and was completed in spring 2004. Tenants in the second tower include Laurentian Bank of Canada. Between the two towers is a glass- enclosed common area with a convenience store and various fast food restaurants. The building's architects were B\u00e9\u00efque Legault Thuot. ==Gallery== Image:CCE Phase I.jpg|E-Commerce Place, Phase I.
