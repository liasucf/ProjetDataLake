    "text": "Later Balhae (927 - (1030-1064)?) was a controversial state in Manchuria. It emerged after Balhae was destroyed by the Liao Empire. Later Balhae was the first of several successor states to Balhae after its fall to the Khitan in 926. ==History== After Bohai, part of the land was annexed, part was incorporated into the vassal duchy of Dundan, and the rest was inhabited by the Koguryo people who retained independence. The conquered people of Balhae immediately began rebelling against the Khitan. Starting in 927, the Khitan had begun to hunt down and execute all members of the royal family in order to destroy any chance of a new ruler to take the throne. However, several members of the royal family survived. Among them were Crown Prince Dae Gwang-hyeon. The Crown Prince took Balhae refugees, mostly former Goguryeo people, and escaped down to their southern neighbor, Goryeo, where the newly-risen King Taejo of Goryeo accepted them with generosity. The Dae clan then united the western Amnok River resistance groups and established \"Later Balhae\" at Holohan Fortress, in 927. However, general Yeol Manhwa took control in a coup and established Jeong-an kingdom in 935. ==See also== *Balhae *Jeong-an kingdom *Heung-yo kingdom *Daewon Kingdom ==References== == External links == * Category:Balhae Category:History of Korea Category:History of Manchuria Category:Former countries in Korean history Category:Former countries in Chinese history ",
