    "text": "Samuel Sharp (1896 \u2013 1936) was a footballer who played as a wing half in the 1920s and 1930s, most notably with Manchester City. Born in Ardwick, Manchester, Sharp first played for Manchester City in wartime competition in 1918,Manchester City player stats at mcfcstats.com before a short spell with Bolton Wanderers, although he did not play a Football League game for them. Sharp returned to Manchester City in 1920 and went on to make 176 Football League appearances for them, plus six more in the FA Cup, in which competition he scored his only City goal. He was in the City side on 13 January 1923 when they were surprisingly beaten by Football League Third Division South side Charlton Athletic. He made his Football League debut for City on 18 February 1920 against Middlesbrough, but he did not become a City regular until the 1922\u201323 season, during which he missed only one game. He remained a regular in the team until the 1925\u201326 season, when he lost his place to Baggy Coupland. It was during this period in the team that he scored his only goal, in an FA Cup tie against Brighton & Hove Albion on 23 February 1924. After losing his regular place in the side he continued to make sporadic appearances over the next few seasons, with his final City game coming on 25 April 1928 against Leeds United, in a 1\u20130 win which clinched the Football League Second Division title for City. After leaving City he played for Crewe Alexandra and Wigan Borough. == References == Category:1896 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Manchester Category:Association football wing halves Category:English Football League players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Crewe Alexandra F.C. players Category:Wigan Borough F.C. players Category:English footballers ",
