Her research is focused on the prediction of protein structures, particularly antibodies. Her research group, Oxford Protein Informatics Group (OPIG), created a database of antibody structures called SABDab and a server for prediction of antibody structures called SAbPred. In addition, Deane's research is focused on immuninformatics, biological networks and small molecules. == Honours and awards == In 2007 and 2008, Deane was awarded an Oxford Teaching Award. In 2002 she was elected as fellow of Kellogg College and University Lecturer. In 2010 she was elected as Professor of Structural Bioinformatics and in October 2015 she was appointed Head of the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford. She is the first female Head of Department since the department was created in 1988. In 2014, Deane became Associate Head of the Mathematical Physical and Life Sciences (MPLS) division and the Deputy Head of the Division in 2018. Deane became a fellow of St Anne's College in 2015. In September 2019, Deane was appointed Deputy Executive Chair of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). == References == ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:British statisticians Category:Women statisticians Category:Biostatisticians Category:Alumni of University College, Oxford Category:1975 births Category:Academics of the University of Oxford ",
