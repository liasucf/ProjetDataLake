In a positive review, Newsdays Verne Gay gave the film four out of four stars and said, \"Diaries is for Shandling fans, certainly, but it\u2019s especially for any kid who might want to become a comic, or write for TV or get into this industry. Zen Diaries is a nearly five-hour-long master\u2019s degree in \u201cthe business,\u201d and also a sober, clear-eyed view of the risks as much as the rewards.\" His ultimate summation of his opinion of the film reads, \"Brilliant portrait of an iconic comic, but an especially moving and human one, too.\" Offering similar praise, Steve Greene of IndieWire gave the film a grade of \"A-\" and said, \"As a tribute, a eulogy, and an appreciation, The Zen Diaries is a even-handed look at someone who sought to bring meaningful change into other people\u2019s lives as he searched for that same sense of fulfillment himself. Even if the film didn\u2019t actually include footage from a ceremony remembering and celebrating Shandling\u2019s life, you\u2019d feel like you were already part of one.\" In another enthusiastic critique, The Hollywood Reporters Daniel Fienberg said, \"Presented over two nights, but easy to digest in a single sitting, Zen Diaries is a worthwhile account of Shandling's career and evolving philosophy, an insightful exploration of stand-up comedy and the comedic voice, and a sad contemplation and reckoning from those Shandling left behind and those grappling with his legacy.\" In a one sentence \"bottom line\" abridgment of his review he writes that the film is, \"Essential for Shandling fans, a superb introduction for neophytes.\" ===Ratings=== Upon their premiere, part one of the documentary was viewed by 268,000 people and part two was viewed by 286,000 people. ===Awards and nominations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Nominee(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|Primetime Emmy Awards | Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special | The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling | | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"| |- | | Judd Apatow | |- | Outstanding Picture Editing for a Nonfiction Program | Joe Beshenkovsky | |- | align=\"center\"| | Best Edited Documentary (Non-Theatrical) | Joe Beshenkovsky | | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"| MPSE Golden Reel Awards | Non- Theatrical Documentary | | | align=\"center\"| |- |} ==See also== *List of HBO Films films ==References== ==External links== *The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling on HBO * Category:2018 television films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:HBO documentary films Category:Documentary films about comedy and comedians Category:2018 documentary films Category:2018 films ",
