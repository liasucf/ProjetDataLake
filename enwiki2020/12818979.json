    "text": "The Berivotra Formation is a Maastrichtian sedimentary formation of the Mahajanga Basin in Boeny, Madagascar. The claystones of the formation were deposited in a shallow marine environment. The Berivotra Formation overlies the fossil-rich Maevarano Formation, in which more fossils of Beelzebufo, also recovered from the Berivotra Formation, have been found. Many shark and ray teeth were collected by surface prospecting on outcrops of the Berivotra Formation, which is readily distinguished by its yellowish grey to pale olive colour, as opposed to the white and green fluvial sandstones that form the upper of the underlying Maevarano Formation. == Fossil content == The following fossils have been reported from the formation:Berivotra at Fossilworks.org * Beelzebufo ampinga * Cretolamna appendiculata, C. maroccana * Serratolamna serrata * Squalicorax kaupi, S. pristodontus * Carcharias sp. * Parapalaeobates sp. * Pristiophorus sp. * cf.
