    "text": "Carlisle is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Its local government area is the town of Victoria Park. == History == The suburb known as Carlisle today was originally settled as part of a land allocation to early Western Australian settlers after 1829. Swan Location 35 was granted to Henry Camfield and Canning Location 2 was granted to James Macdermott, and these land allocations made up the suburb as well as many of the surrounding suburbs.Gallop, Dr G. \"Know your Suburb: Carlisle and Lathlain\" (PDF). Retrieved 10 December 2010. Despite several changes of land ownership in the area little development was made until after the 1890s. The neighbouring suburb of Victoria Park experienced rapid growth around this time that was mostly focused around Albany Road (later to become Albany Highway). This growth eventually spread East as part of the Bickford development. Bickford was a name chosen by real estate company Peet and Co (now Peet Limited) for the sale of residential land in the area. On 23 May 1919, a meeting of ratepayers in the area elected to change the name of the suburb to Carlisle. Bickford State School (renamed Carlisle Primary School in 1922) was opened in 1919, and this was followed by a Methodist church in 1927 and then a Catholic church in 1937. Other infrastructure soon followed. == Geography == Carlisle is bordered by Orrong Road to the north, Briggs/Planet/Kew streets to the east, Rutland Avenue and the Armadale railway line to the south, and Roberts Road to the west. Most of the streets in Carlisle are tree-lined and form the traditional grid formation of the early planning style of Perth. The suburb is mainly flat with the eastern boundary offering views of the city. The Weston Street/Archer Street intersection is the highest point in the west end of the suburb. == Facilities == The Perth\u2013Armadale rail line runs through this area and the suburb is serviced by the Carlisle train station and the Oats Street train station. There are four parks: Fletcher Park, Carlisle Reserve, Parnham Park, and Tom Wright Park. The Carlisle Hotel and TAB are opposite Carlisle train station. Other facilities include the Carlisle Lathlain Bowling Club, Holy Name Primary School, Lathlain Nursing Home, Windsor Park Nursing Home, Harold Hawthorne Seniors Centre, Town of Victoria Park Council Depot, and the Belmont City Works Depot. == Senior and tertiary education == Carlisle contains one technical and further education college, South Metropolitan TAFE \u2013 Carlisle Campus. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Perth, Western Australia Category:Suburbs in the Town of Victoria Park ",
