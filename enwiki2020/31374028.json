In his spare time Anderson plays rhythm guitar and sings in a local band called Splashpool. ==Political career== In a first initiative for the Nationals, Anderson was endorsed following a plebiscite where 4,293 local people voted from a pre- selected field of four candidates. The vote was open to members of the Nationals and the general community, voting at eight polling stations in the electorate, open to anyone on the NSW electoral roll. Anderson defeated James Treloar, the local mayor, on preferences. At the March 2011 elections, Anderson was elected Member for Tamworth and received a swing of 14.7 points, defeating the sitting independent Peter Draper, winning 57.8 per cent of the vote on a two-party-preferred basis.
