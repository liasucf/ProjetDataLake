The outcome was virtually civil war in the region, with assassinations and mob violence. In the superheated atmosphere, following circulated reports of miraculous tears on the Madonna of the Cordeliers, a papiste mob lynched a patriot municipal administrator, Nicolas Jean-Baptiste Lescuyer, who was falsely suspected of planning to seize church property. Jean Duprat, a silk merchant elected mayor of Avignon the previous June, was suspected of having participated. Some sixty persons were summarily executed in a tower of the Palais des Papes, following the lynching. Amnesty for the executioners, as patriots, was debated in Paris, as justice in revolutionary France became more and more politicised. Mathieu Jouve Jourdan (fr), nicknamed \"Jourdan Coupe-T\u00eate\", was implicated in the atrocities, eventually traduced to the revolutionary tribunal, condemned to death and guillotined on 8 prairial II (27 May 1794). The savage massacres of La Glaci\u00e8re, dramatised in popular engravings, were traumatic in the region and appalled the reading public of the Age of Enlightenment; they reverberated for a generation. Jules Michelet devoted two chapters of his massive history of the Revolution to the massacres. ==Sources== *Martin, Jean-Cl\u00e9ment, Violence et R\u00e9volution: Essai sur la naissance d\u2019un mythe national.
