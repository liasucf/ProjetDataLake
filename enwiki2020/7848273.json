In a subsequent reorganization, the county absorbed the southern portion of Tongch'\u014fn county. ==Physical features== K\u016dmgangsan beach. Kos\u014fng is largely mountainous, but there is flat land along the coast of the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea) to the county's east. The mountains here are part of the Taebaek range. A portion of K\u016dmgangsan mountain is included in the county. ==Administrative divisions== Kos\u014fng county is divided into 1 \u016dp (town) and 23 ri (villages): {| |- | valign=\"top\" | * Kos\u014fng-\u016dp * Changp'o-ri * Chonggong-ri * Chudung-ri * Ch'ogu-ri * Haebang-ri * Haeg\u016dmgang-ri * Kobong-ri * K\u016dmch'\u014fl- li * Ku\u016dp-ri * Nam'ae-ri * Okch'\u014fl-li | valign=\"top\" | * Poksong-ri * Pongha- ri * R\u016dngdong-ri * Ry\u014fms\u014fng-ri * Samilp'o-ri * Sinbong-ri * S\u014fngbung-ri * Sunhang-ri * Tup'o-ri * Ungong-ri * Unj\u014fl-li * W\u014flbisal-li |} ==Economy== The local economy is dominated by agriculture, although fishing also plays a role, together with the harvesting of brown seaweed and clams.
