    "text": "\"Still Rolling Stones\" is a song performed by American contemporary Christian singer and songwriter Lauren Daigle. The song was written by Daigle, Paul Mabury, Jason Ingram, and Paul Duncan. \"Still Rolling Stones\" is the fourth single from her third studio album Look Up Child. ==Background== Daigle initially released \"Still Rolling Stones\" as the first promotional single on August 10, 2018. It is also the first track on the album. Lauren describes the track,\"\"Still Rolling Stones\" will be the first track on the new album, because it makes a statement. \"Out of the shadows...\" will be the first line you hear when you start to play Look Up Child. It's all about the things we think are dead, and a reminder that all losses can be revived. They can all come back. The track is at times wild, vibrant, and loud. Then it sounds rich & soulful - giving you a glimpse into what is to be expected on the album.\" \"Still Rolling Stones\" impacted Christian radio on April 10, 2020, as the fourth single from Look Up Child. ==Composition== \"Still Rolling Stones\" is originally in the key of E minor, with a tempo of 99 beats per minute. Written in common time, Daigle's vocal range spans from D4 to C5 during the song. ==Critical reception== Brandon J. from Indie Vision Music wrote \"This song truly captures her talent and showcases an artist on the rise. Her voice captures the heart of the song and proves that \u201cworship\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be a mundane, stale, and overrated \u201cChristian\u201d term.\" ==Commercial performance== It debuted at No. 17 on the Billboard Christian Songs chart on the issue week of August 25, 2018. After the release of Look Up Child, it jumped to No. 16. After being premiered on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, it reached No. 11 on its twelfth week on the chart.

The video for \u201cStill Rolling Stones\u201d features never-before-seen footage taken from Daigle\u2019s first arena tour, the Lauren Daigle World Tour, which was cut short, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to CCM Magazine \"It captures Daigle\u2019s infectious personality and clearly shows the passion and love that she has for performing in front of a live audience\". Diagle reflected on the music video saying \"I miss performing live. The arena tour was something that we worked so hard to put together and couldn\u2019t have been happier about it\u2014especially seeing how everyone was responding. So, we thought it\u2019d be really great to put this out, not only to show how much fun we have when we\u2019re playing live, but to be able to give fans something a little different. Just know that we\u2019re looking forward to being back on the road!\" ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Weekly chart performance for \"Still Rolling Stones\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018-20) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Cross Rhythms Weekly Chart | 1 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Christian AC (Billboard) | 4 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+2018 year-end chart performance for \"Still Rolling Stones\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Cross Rhythms Annual Chart | 3 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Christian Songs (Billboard) | 47 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+2019 year-end chart performance for \"Still Rolling Stones\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Christian Songs (Billboard) | 79 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| United States | April 10, 2020 | Christian radio | Centricity | |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2020 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Lauren Daigle songs Category:Songs written by Jason Ingram Category:Gospel songs Category:American pop songs Category:Contemporary Christian songs ",
