    "text": "The 1st Commonwealth Division was the name given, after July 1951, to Commonwealth land forces in the Korean War.Grey 1988, p. 88. The division was a multinational unit that was part of British Commonwealth Forces Korea, and whilst British and Canadian Army units formed the bulk of the division, Australian infantry, New Zealand artillery and an Indian medical unit were also a part of the division. As with the US \"KATUSA\" programme, numerous South Korean troops were seconded to the Commonwealth division to make up numbers under a programme known as \"KATCOM\". The unit was preceded by the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, which was the initial parent formation of Commonwealth army units in Korea, and which arrived in Korea in August 1950. Its two British Infantry battalions were joined by the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) in September, and by the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI), in February 1951. The brigade was subsequently re-constituted as 28th Commonwealth Brigade in April 1951. In November 1950 the brigade was joined by 29th Independent Infantry Brigade, and in May 1951 by 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade.Grey 1988, pp. 68\u201387. In July 1951 these units were combined to form 1st Commonwealth Division. The Division was made up of 58% British forces, 22% Canadian forces, 14% Australian forces, 5% New Zealander forces, and 1% Indian forces. The 1st Commonwealth Division was part of the US I Corps, which also included the US 1st Cavalry Division, the US 3rd and 25th Infantry Divisions, and the ROK 1st Division. The division occupied the strategically important sector of front on the Jamestown Line, stretching from the Kimpo peninsula on the Yellow Sea coast to a point east of Kumhwa about , and just from the South Korean capital, Seoul.Grey 1988, p. 135. It was deactivated in 1954 as part of the demobilisation of forces in Korea in the aftermath of the war, being reduced to a Commonwealth Brigade Group, and from May 1956 until its final withdrawal in August 1957 to a Commonwealth Contingent of battalion strength.Grey 1988, p. 183. ==1st Commonwealth Division Headquarters Staff== *Commanding officers ** Major General James Cassels, 28 July 1951 \u2013 7 September 1952 ** Major General Michael West, 7 September 1952 \u2013 1953 ** Major General Horatius Murray, 1953 \u2013 1954 *Divisional Commander Royal Artillery (CRA) ** Brigadier William Pike, July 1951 \u2013 1952 ** Brigadier Guy Gregson, 1952 *Divisional Commander Royal Engineers (CRE) ** Colonel ECW Myers, RE *Divisional Commander Royal Signals (CRSigs) ** Lt Col AC Atkinson, Royal Sigs *Divisional Commander Royal Army Service Corps (CRASC) ** Lt Col MGM Crosby, RASC *Assistant Director Medical Services (ADMS) ** Col G Anderton, RAMC *Divisional Commander Royal Army Ordnance Corps (CRAOC) ** Lt Col MR Maclean, RAOC ** Lt Col GJH Atkinson, RNZAOC *Divisional Commander Royal Army Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (CREME) ** Lt Col HG Good, REME ==Order of battle== Soldiers of Duke of Wellington's Regiment the Battle of the Hook, 1953 * Headquarters and Headquarters Company 1st Commonwealth Division **Divisional troops ***Signals ****1st Commonwealth Division Signals, July 1951 \u2013 July 1953 ***Artillery ****45th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, July\u2013November 1951, 25 pdr ****11th (Sphinx) Battery, Royal Artillery, July\u2013November 1951, 4.2 inch mortars ****170th Light Battery, Royal Artillery, July\u2013November 1951, 4.2 inch mortars ****14th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, November 1951 \u2013 December 1952, 25 pdr ****120th Light AA Battery, Royal Artillery, October 1951 \u2013 December 1952, 4.2 inch mortars ****42nd Light AA Battery, Royal Artillery, November 1951 \u2013 February 1952, 4.2 inch mortars ****61st Light Field Regiment, January 1952 \u2013 July 1953, 4.2 inch mortars ****20th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, December 1952 \u2013 July 1953, 25 pdr ****16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery, July 1951 \u2013 July 1953, 25 pdr ****42nd Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, December 1953\u2013 , 25 pdr ****2nd Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, July 1951 \u2013 May 1952, 25 pdr ****1st Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, May 1952 \u2013 April 1953, 25 pdr ****81st Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery, April 1953 \u2013 July 1953, 25 pdr **** 74th (Battleax Company) Medium Battery, Royal Artillery, March\u2013November 1953, 5.5 inch medium guns ****1903 Independent Air Observation Post Flight, Royal Artillery, July 1951 \u2013 July 1953 ***Engineers ****28th Field Engineer Regiment, Royal Engineers, July 1951 \u2013 July 1953 ****64th Field Park Squadron, Royal Engineers, July 1951 \u2013 July 1953 ***Armour ****8th King's Royal Irish Hussars, July 1951 \u2013 December 1951, Centurion tank, Cromwell tank ****C Squadron, 7th Royal Tank Regiment, July 1951 \u2013 October 1951, Churchill tank ****5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards, December 1951 \u2013 December 1952, Centurion tank ****1st Royal Tank Regiment, December 1952 \u2013 December 1953, Centurion tank ****5th Royal Tank Regiment, December 1953 \u2013 December 1954, Centurion tank ****C Squadron, Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) (2nd Armoured Regiment), May 1951 \u2013 June 1952, M4 Sherman tank ****B Squadron, Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) (2nd Armoured Regiment), June 1952 \u2013 May 1953, M4 Sherman tank ****A Squadron, Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) (2nd Armoured Regiment), December 1953\u2013 , M4 Sherman tank ***Medical ****60th (Para) Indian Field Ambulance, November 1950 \u2013 August 1953 ****26th Field Ambulance, RAMC, December 1950\u2013 ****No 25 Field Ambulance, RCAMC, May 1951 \u2013 April 1952 ****No 25 Canadian Field Dressing Station, July 1951\u2013 ****No 37 Field Ambulance, RCAMC, April 1952 \u2013 May 1953 ****No 38 Field Ambulance, RCAMC, May 1953\u2013 ***Logistics ****Ordnance *****No 25 Canadian Infantry Brigade Group Ordnance Company, May 1951 -
