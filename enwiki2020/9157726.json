This in-fill station opened on December 5, 2011. ==History== ===Funding=== From 1999 to 2009, Fairfield First Selectman Kenneth Flatto proposed Fairfield's third train station and negotiated efforts to secure the site from private owners. A three party agreement was approved in 2001 between the Town of Fairfield, the State of CT and developer Blackrock Realty securing state, local and private funding to build the train station and adjoining open space and clean up work. In late December 2009, State Senator John P. McKinney and Governor Jodi Rell announced a bond authorization for $20 million wherein the state would assume the developer's obligation for infrastructure work and continue the project. In late April 2010, the developer's obligation for infrastructure improvements was reduced to $5.2 million with the balance being financed through the aforementioned state bonds. Responsibility for construction of the 1,500-car parking lot and access road at the town's third train station on lower Black Rock Turnpike was transferred to the town as the developer's financial obligation was reduced. In July 2011 an audit of the contract and the cost overruns was approved by the Fairfield Board of Finance and members of the Representative Town Meeting. ===Naming=== Fairfield Metro station platforms in May 2012 As the station neared completion, a debate emerged within the surrounding community concerning the name of the station. The station was named \"Fairfield Metro\" as indicated by signs on the station platforms. This was the name preferred by the developer of the surrounding site, Blackrock Realty, and was the one being used by the state. Fairfield residents, however, called the name bland. First Selectman Kenneth Flatto noted that the Town would prefer something different, and an online survey was posted asking residents of the town and surrounding areas to voice their opinions. Popular suggestions included: Black Rock, Black Rock Turnpike, Ash Creek, and Grasmere, among others. The state had the final word in naming the station and could choose to follow or disregard the town's recommendations. To meet the opening deadline of November 2011, a name had to be chosen by February 2010. The final name of Fairfield Metro was announced on March 18, 2011. ===Opening=== The station opened on December 5, 2011, with the first New York bound train arriving at 4:37 am. The project includes creation of a open space and public park along Ash Creek between Kings Highway in Fairfield and the Black Rock neighborhood of Bridgeport. The project is being monitored by local and state agencies and by environmental experts. National retailers have responded to the new development and have moved into the neighborhood. The new Kings Crossing Shopping Center opened just down the street from the Station in late 2011. New retailers in the development include: Whole Foods Market, Chipotle Mexican Grill, CVS Pharmacy, and Five Guys, among others. Because the new station provides a 75-minute train ride to Grand Central, local landlords have reported new renters commuting from Fairfield/Blackrock to Grand Central. ==Station layout== This local station has two side platforms, which can both accommodate 12-car trains. The station is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, providing access for the mobility-impaired. The station and 1,500-space surface parking lot are owned by the state. The building complex will have its own parking to accommodate the expected automobile commuters. As the project is completed, it will increase the commercial space inventory in the town of Fairfield by 30 percent. The project includes a railroad station to be located between Fairfield station and Bridgeport station. The complex is accessible by exit 24 of I-95, through the traffic circle at Kings Highway, and a two-lane road. As a special permit approved for the Metro Center owners, the town created a special five story zoning district just for this project. The special district will allow the planned buildings to become an office park with vibrant supporting retail and one hotel. The project has been designated as a \"major traffic generator\" by the Connecticut State Traffic Commission with the proponents of the project representing that it will improve traffic conditions in the area. {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;|M |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;|Mezzanine |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;|Crossover between platforms |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 rowspan=6 valign=top|P Platform level |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\" colspan=2|Side platform, doors will open on the right |- |Track 3 |\u2190 toward () \u2190 services do not stop here \u2190 express trains do not stop here |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 1 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 services do not stop here \u2190 express trains do not stop here |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 2 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"| services do not stop here \u2192 express trains do not stop here \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 4 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"| services do not stop here \u2192 express trains do not stop here \u2192 toward or () \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text- align:center;\" colspan=2|Side platform, doors will open on the right |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" valign=top width=50|G |style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" valign=top width=100|Street level |style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" valign=top width=525|Exit/entrance and parking |} ==See also== * Fairfield (Metro-North station), another Fairfield train station. * Southport (Metro-North station), another Fairfield train station. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Metro-North Railroad stations in Connecticut Category:Stations on the Northeast Corridor Category:Buildings and structures in Fairfield, Connecticut Category:Railroad stations in Fairfield County, Connecticut Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 2011 Category:2011 establishments in Connecticut ",
