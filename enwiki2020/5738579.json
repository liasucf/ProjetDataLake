Set in space, the player flies a spaceship shooting enemies and collecting power-ups to reach the mother ship of an invasion force. Reception was mixed, with critics criticising the generic nature and lack of variety, and others praising the graphics. The game was re-released on the Hang-On / Astro Warrior compilation in North America, and the Astro Warrior / Pit Pot compilation in Europe. In 1996, Tec Toy re-released the game in Brazil as Sapo Xul\u00e9: SOS Lagoa Polu\u00edda, and based it on a Brazilian 1980s toy. This version was also released in Portugal. ==Plot== The Devil Star Imperial Forces have established a base on and invaded the Alpha Kentowry system. The Solar System Allied Forces have entrusted their Warrior, aboard The Astoro Raider, to attack the invasion force and destroy their mother ship.Manual, p.16 ==Gameplay== A typical game in progress. The game is a top down shooter, taking place through three levels with a boss at the end of each. Astro Warrior's three levels have many different kinds of enemies that attack in various patterns. The stages have no obstacles. Power-ups can be collected by shooting targets on the ground. These include ship speed increase, a stronger laser weapon, and two Gradius-style options. Capturing Weapons Supply Ships increases the Astro Raider's speed and firing ability. The player starts with three lives, and if all are lost, the game is over.Manual, pp. 16,20,22 If the player dies, all power-ups are lost. ==History== Astro Warrior was re-released as Sapo Xul\u00e9: SOS Lagoa Polu\u00edda by Tec Toy in Brazil in 1996. The game was also released in Portugal. Sapo Xul\u00e9: SOS Lagoa Polu\u00edda is based on a popular Brazilian 1980s toy, and set underwater, with the Astoro Raider replaced with a submarine. ==Reception== GameFreaks 365 heavily criticised the game, citing the background, \"worthless\" bosses, and the game being too generic, but complimented the \"nicely done\" colourful presentation. IMPLANTgames criticised the lack of variety, the mediocre enemies, but complimented the music. German magazine Happy Computer praised the graphics, calling them truly remarkable, and saying the system's colourful sprite varieties are exploited. ==References== ==Sources== * ==External links== * * * Category:1986 video games Category:Master System games Category:Master System-only games Category:Sega video games Category:Shoot 'em ups Category:Vertically scrolling shooters Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in outer space ",
