Twenty-one United States Nobel Laureates issued a public statement condemning it as a \"massive violation of human rights.\" It is believed that item 3 of the Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment addressed the issue. ==Abolishment== Under the international pressure, the Soviet government abolished the tax. The declassified KGB archives tell the story how it happened. Leonid Brezhnev ordered the KGB to study the Jewish emigration in order to make a decision on the issue of the diploma tax. The report was presented to Politburo on March 20, 1973, just before the introduction of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in Congress. The findings were surprising: the vast majority of the Jews applying to visas were not educated professionals, but salesmen and people of minor trades. In 1972, of about 29,000 emigrants only 13.5% had university diploma; and only 30 persons had kandidat nauk or doktor nauk (equivalents of Ph.D. or higher) degree. Brezhnev, demonstrating knowledge of the internal works of the American politics, mentioned Jackson-Vanik when arguing the repeal of the tax, apparently trying to prevent the amendment. Yuri Andropov was against the repeal of the tax, arguing it would look as sign of weakness. Eventually, the same day it was announced that the diploma tax would remain \"in the books\" but not be enforced. ==See also== *Departure tax *Expatriation tax ==References== Category:Education in the Soviet Union Category:Politics of the Soviet Union Category:Jews and Judaism in the Soviet Union ",
