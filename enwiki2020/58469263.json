    "text": "The Switzer Covered Bridge, located off Rocky Branch Rd., over North Elkhorn Creek, in or near Switzer, Kentucky, was built around 1855. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It is long and wide. It was built by George Hockensmith. The bridge was threatened with destruction in 1953, but was saved. In March 1997, it was knocked from its foundation by high water and was later rebuilt again that year Instead of destroying and replacing this bridge. With The correct length of the Switzer Bridge is 120' not 60' It is a single span Howe truss. The statement that it was saved from destruction is correct, but it should be stated that it was through the efforts of local magistrate Harrold Cunningham (Harrold is the correct spelling of his name). Cunningham correctly ascertained that the bridge belonged to the county not the state and that they had no authority to demolish it. Construction was completed in late summer, 1953 and the bridge was closed to traffic at that time, not 1954. The concrete bridge built to replace it was named for Cunningham. Robert W. M.
