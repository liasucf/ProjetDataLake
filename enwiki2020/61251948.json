The club would relocate to Nanchang, Jiangxi and rename themselves Nanchang Hengyuan as well as going on to win the division title at the end of the 2005 league season. Initially starting as a midfielder, Ji would be moved as a forward and go on to score six goals within the 2009 China League One season as the team came runners-up within the division and gain promotion to the top tier for the first time in their history. Within the top tier of Chinese football, Ji would struggle to gain much game time and actively paid for his own flight to pursue a move to Indonesia before joining Meizhou Hakka in the third tier. The move would see a revival in his career and he would win the 2015 China League Two division title with them and promotion to the second tier. Ji decided to rejoin his previous club at the start of the 2016 league season, Nanchang Hengyuan who had returned to Shanghai and renamed themselves Shanghai Shenxin F.C. several seasons earlier. On 14 February 2018, Ji joined third tier club Nantong Zhiyun. ==Career statistics== ===Club statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |rowspan=9|Nanchang Hengyuan |2005 |China League Two | || ||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-|| || |- |2006 |rowspan=\"4\"|China League One |18||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||18||0 |- |2007 |7||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||7||0 |- |2008 |21||3||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||21||3 |- |2009 |14||6||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||14||6 |- |2010 |rowspan=\"3\"|Chinese Super League |9||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||9||0 |- |2011 |3||0||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||4||1 |- |2012 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !72!!9!!1!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!73!!10 |- |rowspan=4|Meizhou Hakka |2013 |rowspan=\"3\"|China League Two | ||4||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-|| ||4 |- |2014 |9||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||9||1 |- |2015 |14||9||3Appearances in the Chinese FA Cup||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||17||9 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !23!!14!!3!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!26!!14 |- |rowspan=3|Shanghai Shenxin |2016 |rowspan=\"2\"|China League One |23||2||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||25||2 |- |2017 |22||4||6||2||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||28||6 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !45!!6!!8!!2!!0!!0!!0!!0!!53!!8 |- |rowspan=3|Nantong Zhiyun |2018 |China League Two |28||5||4||4||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||32||9 |- |2019 |China League One |21||5||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|-||colspan=\"2\"|-||22||5 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !49!!10!!5!!4!!0!!0!!0!!0!!54!!14 |- ! colspan=3 | Career total !189!!39!!17!!7!!0!!0!!0!!0!!206!!46 |} ;Notes ==Honours== ===Club=== Nanchang Hengyuan * China League Two: 2005 Meizhou Hakka * China League Two: 2015 ==References== Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Chinese Super League players Category:China League One players Category:China League Two players Category:Shanghai Shenxin F.C. players Category:Meizhou Hakka F.C. players Category:Nantong Zhiyun F.C. players ",
