    "text": "Urban East Norwegian (UEN), Standard East Norwegian (, ), in Norway commonly referred to as East Norwegian or the Oslo dialect (or as a sociolect thereof) is an alleged de facto spoken standard of Bokm\u00e5l/Riksm\u00e5l in much of Eastern Norway. Standard East Norwegian is primarily spoken in Central Eastern Norway, including the capital Oslo and its surrounding areas. Standard East Norwegian is a dialect of Modern Norwegian regarded by some as an Eastern Norwegian standard language with roots in Eastern Norwegian elites' pronunciation of Danish. It is markedly different from the traditional Norwegian dialects in Eastern Norway, with which it has co-existed for centuries. The labels \"Standard East Norwegian\" or \"Urban East Norwegian\" are not in common use in Norway - rather, this variation of Norwegian is usually classified as a sociolect of the Oslo dialect. Standard East Norwegian together with the other Norwegian dialects comprise Modern Norwegian. Standard East Norwegian is not used outside Eastern Norway. ==History== Standard East Norwegian is the Eastern Norwegian regional continuation of the Eastern Norwegian variety of Norwegian Received Pronunciation (; lit. \"educated/cultivated speech\"), which originated as Eastern Norwegian elites' pronunciation of Danish (or a Norwegian variation of Danish, see Dano-Norwegian) from the 17th century during the countries' union. As such it is genetically a form of Danish, but has been more recently been considered a variation of the Norwegian language, although not without controversy (ref. the Norwegian language conflict). It is different from Danish as spoken in Denmark, and is considered native to Norway, and it largely shares its phonology with native Eastern Norwegian dialects, with some exceptions. Urban East Norwegian is the modern language that is closest to 16th century Danish, even closer than contemporary Danish. It is far more similar to written Danish than contemporary Danish is; written Danish was and is conservative in that it largely reflects the Danish sound system of the 16th century, while modern spoken Danish has evolved significantly. When Norwegian elites started to speak a Norwegian variety of Danish, it was heavily influenced by written Danish. By the time of the Dano- Norwegian union's dissolution in 1814, around one percent of Norway's population spoke Received Pronunciation natively, exclusively members of the upper class such as civil servants and burghers, and their families. By 1900 the percentage had increased to 5%, and from the 20th century Received Pronunciation massively influenced the spoken language of most people in central Eastern Norway, while traditional working class dialects in the Oslo area went nearly extinct due to their strong association with the working class and the resulting prejudices against them among the middle and upper classes. However, modern Standard East Norwegian is a continuum where it is possible to speak both pure Received Pronunciation and to incorporate elements/remnants of local dialects; a person's speech may vary depending on the audience and context. In the most central part of Eastern Norway Standard East Norwegian is the native language of most people; in less central areas, such as Gj\u00f8vik, people may still speak a dialect at home, but often adopt Standard East Norwegian when they move to Oslo or another larger city. For the subset of East Norwegians who conformed their speech to the Bokm\u00e5l norm and its predecessors, The Eastern Norwegian variation of Norwegian Received Pronunciation traditionally dominated on the stage, in broadcasting, in all educational contexts and in all professions that required an education. In the modern era the tolerance for the use of dialects in Eastern Norway as a whole is higher than previously, and the use of dialects from other parts of the country is fairly common; however some of the native dialects of Eastern Norway traditionally face more prejudices than other dialects. Linguist Arne Torp claims that there is no doubt that there is a hierarchy of dialects in Norway, where dialects from \u00d8stfold, Toten and Hedmark have comparatively low prestige, while for instance the dialect of Vinje enjoys high prestige.\u2013 \u00d8stfold er bunnen og Vinje er toppen As of the year 2000, Standard East Norwegian was the variety of Norwegian that was most commonly taught to foreign students. ==Phonology== ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:Norwegian dialects Category:Norwegian language ",
