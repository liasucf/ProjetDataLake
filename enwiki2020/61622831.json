    "text": "Fanwell Khumalo is a former South African celebrity chef who was convicted of multiple rapes of children in South Africa. From 1999 to 2001, Khumalo attacked numerous girls between ages of seven and 13 in the Johannesburg area. By pretending to be a policeman, or approaching girls and asking for directions, he took girls from busy spots to deserted areas such as parks, open fields, and empty houses, where he raped them in daylight. Some of the girls knew so little about sex that they did not understand what was happening to them. Khumalo claimed that it was a case of mistaken identity, and that police conspired to frame him and that they should look for the real rapist. Khumalo was convicted on 103 counts. On August 6, 2004, he was given 42 life sentences. ==References== Category:Living people Category:South African rapists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:South African chefs ",
