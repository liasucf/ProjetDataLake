He invented the word robot, which was introduced into literature by his brother, Karel \u010capek. ==Life== \u010capek was born in Hronov, Bohemia (Austria- Hungary, later Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic) in 1887. First a painter of the Cubist school, he later developed his own playful, minimalist style. He collaborated with his brother Karel on a number of plays and short stories; on his own, he wrote the utopian play Land of Many Names and several novels, as well as critical essays in which he argued for the art of the unconscious, of children, and of 'savages'. He was named by his brother as the true inventor of the term robot.Karel Capek \u2013 Who did actually invent the word \"robot\" and what does it mean? at capek.misto.cz (dead link) | archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20120204135259/http://capek.misto.cz/english/robot.htmlRobotics and automation handbook As a cartoonist, he worked for Lidov\u00e9 Noviny, a newspaper based in Prague. Due to his critical attitude towards national socialism and Adolf Hitler, he was arrested after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939. He wrote Poems from a Concentration Camp in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where he died in 1945. In June 1945 Rudolf Margolius, accompanied by \u010capek's wife Jarmila \u010capkov\u00e1, went to Bergen-Belsen to search for him.Jarmila \u010capkov\u00e1, Vzpom\u00ednky, Torst, Praha 1998, s. 331. His remains were never found. In 1948 the court officially set the date of his death as 30 April 1947, the day which he did not survive being 30.http://kultura.zpravy.idnes.cz/autorska-prava-josefa-capka- dpc-/literatura.aspx?c=A160108_130210_literatura_ob His illustrated stories Pov\u00edd\u00e1n\u00ed o Pejskovi a Ko\u010di\u010dce (English translation as The Adventures of Puss and Pup) are considered classics of Czech children's literature. == Selected literary works == *Lelio, 1917 *Ze \u017eivota hmyzu (Pictures from the Insects' Life), 1921 \u2013 with Karel Capek *Pov\u00edd\u00e1n\u00ed o pejskovi a ko\u010di\u010dce (The Adventures of Puss and Pup), 1929 *St\u00edn kapradiny, 1930, novel *Kulhav\u00fd poutn\u00edk, essays, 1936 *Land of Many Names *B\u00e1sn\u011b z koncentra\u010dn\u00edho tabora (Poems from Concentration Camp), published posthumously 1946 *Adam Stvo\u0159itel (Adam the Creator) \u2013 with Karel \u010capek *D\u00e1\u0161e\u0148ka, \u010dili \u017eivot \u0161t\u011bn\u011bte (Dashenka, consequently the life of a Puppy) \u2013 with Karel \u010capek, illustrated by Josef == Gallery == Image:Josef \u010capek Letadlo.jpg|Letadlo (Aeroplane) Image:Josef \u010capek, Zp\u00edvaj\u00edc\u00ed d\u011bv\u010data.jpg|Zp\u00edvaj\u00edc\u00ed d\u011bv\u010data (Singing girls) Image:Josef \u010capek - Harmonik\u00e1\u0159 (1913).jpg|Harmonik\u00e1\u0159 (Harmonist) Image:Josef \u010capek - Krajina v de\u0161ti (1928).jpg|Krajina v de\u0161ti (Landscape in the rain) Image:Josef \u010capek - Kluci s kozou (1936).jpg|Kluci s kozou (Guys with a goat) Image:Josef \u010capek - Pij\u00e1k (1913).jpg|Pij\u00e1k (Blotter) Image:Josef \u010capek - Matka s d\u011btmi.JPG|Matka s d\u011btmi (Mother with children) Image:Josef \u010capek, Hra.jpg|Hra (Game) Image:AfricanKingCapek.jpg|African King Image:Josef \u010capek Selfportrait.jpg|Autoportr\u00e9t (Self-portrait) ==See also== * Brothers \u010capek * Karel \u010capek ==Literature== * Ivan Margolius, 'The Robot of Prague', Newsletter, The Friends of Czech Heritage no. 17, Autumn 2017, pp. 3 - 6. https://czechfriends.net/images/RobotsMargoliusJul2017.pdf * Marie \u0160ulcov\u00e1. \u010capci, Lad\u011bn\u00ed pro dv\u011b struny, Polo\u010das nad\u011bj\u00ed, Br\u00e1na v\u011b\u010dnosti, Praha: Melantrich 1993-98 * Marie \u0160ulcov\u00e1.
