The Molly Pitcher Inn is located on the secluded Navesink River where its restaurant and bar overlook the scenic waterfront. The name is inspired by Molly Pitcher, an American Revolutionary War figure connected to the Battle of Monmouth. In 1992, James Barry and Kevork Hovnanian acquired ownership; the property regained a second life. James Barry, son-in- law to Kevork Hovnanian was positioned as President of The Molly Pitcher after the purchase and oversaw the complete building's sixteen month renovation. After, the renovation the Inn's business increased dramatically. In fact, the property was so successful that, in 1997, Barry and Hovnanian acquired a sister hotel right in the neighborhood, The Oyster Point Hotel. The historic Molly Pitcher Inn is a staple to the city of Red Bank. == Molly Pitcher == The Molly Pitcher Inn being renovated. The opposite side of the hotel overlooks the Navesink River facing Middletown, New Jersey Molly Pitcher was a heroic woman during the American Revolution. Molly Pitcher played a key role in the Battle of Monmouth which took place in Freehold, New Jersey which is just minutes from Red Bank, New Jersey where The Molly Pitcher Inn stands today. She is best known for carrying pitchers of water to the soldiers during The Battle of Monmouth. Molly Pitchers birth name was Mary Ludwig but the soldiers on the battlefield referred to her by the nickname they had given her. Like many women did during those days Molly Pitcher followed her husband from Carlisle Pennsylvania back to New Jersey. She not only carried water to the thirsty soldiers, she also tended to wounds, cleaned clothes, and many other important tasks. There is even a story saying that her husband had fainted during battle and Pitcher took over his cannon during the battle. Molly Pitcher was a very popular woman due to her heroic work during the Revolutionary War. The location of the hotel compared to where the war actually took place makes using the iconic name Molly Pitcher a perfect name for a hotel. == Dining == The Molly Pitcher is widely known for their upscale brunch on Sunday's 11:30 am to 1:30 pm that is served buffet style.
