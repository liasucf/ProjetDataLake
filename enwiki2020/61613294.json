In October 2017, Jorjani published an essay which claimed that members of the \"Deep State\" would arrange for the funding to create a corporation combining Spencer's National Policy Institute and Friberg's Arktos Media, as well as Henrik Palmgren's Red Ice Radio and Television network of Sweden.Johnson, Greg (October 2017) \"The Altright Corporation & the American Deep State\" Counter-CurrentsJorjani, Jason October 1, 2017) \"The Coming Persian War\" Majorityrights com Once the AltRightCorporation was founded, after spending months making speeches on behalf of the alt-right and public appearances with Richard Spencer, Jorjani said that influencing the movement was more difficult then he had thought it would be.
