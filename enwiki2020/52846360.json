There are many ways that nations have accomplished regime change abroad, and electoral intervention is only one of those methods. Theoretical and empirical research on the effect of foreign electoral intervention had been characterized as weak overall as late as 2011; however, since then a number of such studies have been conducted. One study indicated that the country intervening in most foreign elections is the United States with 81 interventions, followed by Russia (including the former Soviet Union) with 36 interventions from 1946 to 2000\u2014an average of once in every nine competitive elections.

(7 September 2016). \"Sure, the U.S. and Russia often meddle in foreign elections. Does it matter?\". The Washington Post. Retrieved 21 May 2019. ==Academic studies== ===Measurement of interventions=== A 2019 study by L\u00fchrmann et al. at the Varieties of Democracy Institute in Sweden summarized reports from each country to say that in 2018 the most intense interventions, by means of false information on key political issues, were by China in Taiwan and by Russia in Latvia; the next highest levels were in Bahrain, Qatar and Hungary; the lowest levels were in Trinidad and Tobago, Switzerland and Uruguay. A 2016 study by Dov H. Levin found that, among 938 global elections examined, the United States and Russia (including its predecessor, the Soviet Union) combined had involved themselves in about one out of nine (117), with the majority of those (68%) being through covert, rather than overt, actions. The same study found that \"on average, an electoral intervention in favor of one side contesting the election will increase its vote share by about 3 percent,\" an effect large enough to have potentially changed the results in seven out of 14 U.S. presidential elections occurring after 1960. According to the study, the U.S. intervened in 81 foreign elections between 1946 and 2000, while the Soviet Union or Russia intervened in 36. A 2018 study by Levin found that the electoral interventions determined in \"many cases\" the identity of the winner. The study also found suggestive evidence that the interventions increased the risk of democratic breakdown in the targeted states. ===Typologies of interventions=== In a 2012 study, Corstange and Marinov theorized that there are two types of foreign intervention: partisan intervention, where the foreign power takes a stance on its support for one side, and process intervention, where the foreign power seeks \"to support the rules of democratic contestation, irrespective of who wins\". Their results from 1,703 participants found that partisan interventions had a polarizing effect on political and foreign relations views, with the side favored by the external power more likely to favor improvements in relations between the two, and having the converse effect for those opposed by the power. In 2018, Jonathan Godinez further elaborated on Corstange and Marinov's theory by proposing that interventions can be specified as globally- motivated intervention, where \"a country intervenes in the election of another country for the interests, betterment, or well-being of the international audience,\" and self-motivated intervention, where \"a country intervenes in the election of another country to further the interests, betterment, or well- being of themselves.\" Godinez further theorized that the vested interest of an intervening country can be identified by examining a \"threefold methodology\": the tactics of intervention, stated motivation, and the magnitude of the intervention. Also in 2012, Shulman and Bloom theorized a number of distinct factors affecting the results of foreign interference: * Agents of interference: each with a descending effect on resentment caused by their intervention, these being nations, international organizations, non- governmental organizations, and finally individuals. * Partisanship of interference: whether foreign actors intervene to affect institutions and process broadly, or intervene primarily to favor one side in a contest * Salience of interference: consisting of two elements. First, \"how obvious and well-known is the interference\", and second, \"how clear and understandable is the intervention?\" Additionally, they theorized that national similarities between the foreign and domestic powers would decrease resentment, and may even render the interference welcome. In cases where national autonomy are of primary concern to the electorate, they predicted a diminished effect of the similarity or dissimilarity of the two powers on resentment. Conversely, they predicted that in cases where national identity was a primary concern, the importance of similarity or dissimilarity would have a greater impact. === Impact of interventions === According to a 2020 study, Americans \"are more likely to condemn foreign involvement, lose faith in democracy, and seek retaliation when a foreign power sides with the opposition, than when a foreign power aids their own party. At the same time, Americans reject military responses to electoral attacks on the United States, even when their own political party is targeted.\" ==Bolivian election (by United States, 2002)== In the Bolivian elections of 2002, the U.S., which had been financing the eradication of coca farms, instructed Ambassador Manuel Rocha to warn Bolivians against voting for socialist candidate Evo Morales, stating that doing so could \"jeopardize American assistance and investment.\" USAID also create the \"political party reform project\" in Bolivia in 2002, whose aim was to \"help build moderate, pro-democracy political parties that can serve as a counterweight to the radical MAS or its successors\". The move largely backfired, increasing support for Morales, who finished second in the election. ==Chilean elections== Chilean workers marching in support of Allende in 1964. ===1970 election (by United States)=== According to information released as part of the findings of the Church Committee, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency supported the kidnapping of the Chilean Army Commander-in- Chief General Ren\u00e9 Schneider in an attempt to prevent the congressional confirmation of Salvador Allende. The attempt failed and Schneider was shot in the process. He died three days later from his wounds. Thereafter, the U.S. continued a vigorous overt and covert campaign to undermine Allende's Presidency, which may have created the conditions for Allende's overthrow in a violent coup, although the U.S. was not directly implicated in the coup. American official Henry Kissinger was quoted by Newsweek in 1974 saying this about Chile: \"I don't see why we have to let a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people\".Nutter, John (2000). The CIA's Black Ops: Covert Action, Foreign Policy, and Democracy. Prometheus Books. p. 107. . ===1964 election (by United States and Soviet Union)=== Between 1960 and 1969, the Soviet government funded the Communist Party of Chile at a rate of between $50,000 and $400,000 annually. In the 1964 Chilean elections the U.S. government supplied $2.6 million in funding for candidate Eduardo Frei Montalva, whose opponent, Salvador Allende was a prominent Marxist, as well as additional funding with the intention of harming Allende's reputation. As Kristian Gustafson phrased the situation: > It was clear the Soviet Union was operating in Chile to ensure Marxist > success, and from the contemporary American point of view, the United States > was required to thwart this enemy influence: Soviet money and influence were > clearly going into Chile to undermine its democracy, so U.S. funding would > have to go into Chile to frustrate that pernicious influence. The U.S. involvement was later revealed by the Church Committee in 1975. == French election == === 2007 election (by Libya) === According to French newspaper Mediapart, Nicolas Sarkozy's presidential campaign received 50 million Euros in donations from the Libyan leader, colonel Muammar Gaddafi, which is over twice the French limit for individual campaign donations of 22 million Euros. After Sarkozy's victory, Gaddafi went on a 5-day state visit to France, during which the Libyan government purchased military equipment, including 14 Rafale fighter jets. Ziad Takieddine, a French-Lebanese businessman with close ties to Libya, admitted to Mediapart that he had made three trips from Tripoli to France to deliver suitcases filled with 200 and 500 euro notes to Sarkozy. After the election, Gaddafi was invited. In March 2018, Sarkozy was held in custody over these allegations. He was interrogated for 25 hours by the police, during which he denied any wrongdoing, before being released under special judicial supervision. ===2017 election (by Russia)=== The 2017 Macron e-mail leaks were leaks of more than 20,000 e-mails related to the campaign of Emmanuel Macron during the 2017 French presidential elections, two days before the final vote. The leaks garnered an abundance of media attention due to how quickly news of the leak spread throughout the Internet, aided in large part by bots and spammers and drew accusations that the government of Russia under Vladimir Putin was responsible. The e-mails were shared by WikiLeaks and several American alt-right activists through social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, and 4chan. == German election (by Turkey, 2017) == In August 2017, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan called for all his \"countrymen\" in Germany to vote against the CDU/CSU, the SPD and the Green Party in the upcoming German federal election. Erdo\u011fan called these parties, as well as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, \"enemies of Turkey\". Merkel condemned these statements, and responded that all Germans had to right to vote freely without foreign meddling in the electoral process. German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel affirmed Erdo\u011fan's segments were an \"unprecedented act of interference in the sovereignty of our country.\" There are at least 4 million people of Turkish origin in Germany, most of whom customarily align with the SPD or the Green Party politically. == Guinean election (by France, 2010) == Vincent Bollor\u00e9, a French billionaire close to then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy, allegedly gave financial support to presidential candidate Alpha Cond\u00e9 in the 2010 Guinean presidential election. He is suspected of having offered Cond\u00e9 discount on advertisements from his ad agency, which he didn't equally offer to his opponent Cellou Dalein Diallo. Cond\u00e9 went on to become Guinean president and gave Bollor\u00e9's company port concessions. Bollor\u00e9 formally denies any wrongdoing. ==Iranian election (by United States, 1952)== Historian Ervand Abrahamian, in an interview with Democracy Now!, said U.S. State Department documents declassified in 2017 reveal that the U.S. strategy was to undermine Mohammad Mosaddegh through parliament and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) spent lot of money to get their 18 favorable candidates elected. ==Israeli elections== ===2016 election (by United States)=== During the administration of President Barack Obama, the U.S. State Department sent nearly $350,000 to an Israeli non-profit organization, OneVoice. Allegations arose claiming the funds were intended to try to oust Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin NetanyahuDinan, Stephan (12 July 2016). \"Obama admin. sent taxpayer money to campaign to oust Netanyahu\". The Washington Times. Retrieved 21 May 2019. in favor of Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni. The State Department did give a grant to OneVoice. $233,500 went to OneVoice Israel, and $115,776 went to OneVoice Palestine. The goal of this non-profit organization is to encourage a two state solution, and the grant money was intended to fund local activists promoting such a solution in both Israel itself, and in Palestine. Palestinians cannot vote in Israeli elections, therefore at best $233,550 could have been spent on Israeli election interference. The grant money was spent by November 2014, before Netanyahu announced new elections, however. In addition, at the time Netanyahu had been in support of a two state solution. The Obama administration did view a two state solution as a priority in Israel Greenberg, Jon (25 March 2015).

Retrieved 1 December 2019 In early 2015, OneVoice partnered with a new organization, V15, which had the stated aim of \"disrupting the status quo\" and putting a center left government in power. Netanyahu was not the specific target, but the effect was the same. V15 wanted a new government to negotiate a two state solution, and mobilized voters in an effort to bring that about. V15 was advised by a former Obama campaign strategist, however it is unclear that the Obama administration had any direct or indirect role in affecting the outcome of the 2015 Israeli election. Netanyahu was reelected. Greenberg, Jon (25 March 2015).

At the advice of Walter Dowling, the U.S. also invited Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi on an official visit and made a number of related economic concessions. Conversely, the Soviet Union funneled as much as $10 million monthly to the communists and leveraged its influence on Italian companies via contracts to support them. However, many of their efforts were ad hoc in comparison, and the Christian Democrats eventually won in a landslide. ==Japanese elections (by United States, 1950s\u201360s)== The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan received secret American funds during the 1950s and 1960s. This was justified by U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II when he said, \"the Socialists in Japan had their own secret funds from Moscow\", and funding the LDP helped to \"project American power\".Weiner, Tim (9 October 1994). \"C.I.A.

Retrieved 21 May 2019. ==Korean election (by United Nations, Soviet Union, 1948)== The 1948 Korean elections were overseen primarily by the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea, or UNTCOK. The United States planned to hold separate elections in the south of the peninsula, a plan which was opposed by Australia, Canada and Syria as members of the commission. According to Gordenker, the commission acted: > in such a way as to affect the controlling political decisions regarding > elections in Korea. Moreover, UNTCOK deliberately and directly took a hand > in the conduct of the 1948 election. Conversely the Soviet Union forbade such elections in the north of the peninsula all together. Faced with this, UNTCOK eventually recommended the election take place only in the south, but that the results would be binding on all of Korea. ==Palestinian election (by United States, Israel, 2006)== During the 2006 Palestinian elections, Israel hoped that Fatah would prevail over Hamas, the latter being a Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist organization. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon wanted to halt the elections if Hamas ran candidates. However, U.S. President George W. Bush objected to such election interference, and Hamas won, despite millions of clandestine dollars flowing from the Bush administration to Fatah during the closing weeks of the campaign.Swansbrough, Robert (2008). Test by Fire: The War Presidency of George W. Bush. Springer. p. 187. .

CIA agent Edward Lansdale purportedly ran the successful 1953 presidential campaign of Ramon Magsaysay. == Russian election (by United States, 1996) == The first Russian president Boris Yeltsin won his second term in the 1996 presidential elections A team of private US citizens, campaign experts organized by Felix Braynin, provided assistance to the Yeltsin campaign. The team consisted of Steven Moore, Joe Shumate, George Gorton and Richard Dresner, who worked in Russia four months and received $250,000, plus payment of all costs and unlimited budget to conduct surveys and other activities. Simultaneously the US administration ensured a US$10.2 billion IMF loan to Russia to keep the national economy and pro-Western liberal government afloat. The loan funds were fraudulently misused by Yeltsin's inner circle, and the IMF knowingly turned a blind eye to these facts. Although the aggressive pro-Yeltsin campaign boosted his approval rate from an initial 6% to the 35% that he got during the first round of elections, and later made him win the second round against the Communist competitor, Gennady Zyuganov, with 54% to 41%, there were wide speculations that the official results were rigged. == Sri Lankan election (by India, 2015) == It was alleged that the Indian foreign intelligence agency had played a role in uniting the Sri Lankan opposition, to bring about the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa. There had been growing concern in the Indian government, on the increasing influence of economic and military rival China in Sri Lankan affairs. Rajapaksa further upped the ante by allowing 2 Chinese submarines to dock in 2014, without informing India, in spite of a stand still agreement to this effect between India and Sri Lanka. The growing Chinese tilt of Rajapaksa was viewed by India with unease. Further, it was alleged, that a RAW agent, helped coordination of talks within the opposition, and convincing former PM Ranil Wickremasinghe not to stand against Rajapaksa, but to choose a common opposition candidate, who had better chances of winning. The agent is also alleged to have been in touch with Chandrika Kumaratunga, who played a key role in convincing Maithripala Sirisena to be the common candidate. == Taiwanese election (by China, 2018) == Taiwan's leaders, including President Tsai Ing-wen and Premier William Lai, have repeatedly accused China of spreading fake news via social media to influence voters and support candidates more sympathetic to Beijing ahead of the 2018 Taiwanese local elections. == Togolese election (by France, 2010) == Vincent Bollor\u00e9, a French billionaire close to then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy, allegedly gave financial support to presidential candidate Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 in the 2010 Togolese presidential election.

The Russian government publicly attempted to influence the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election. Russian President Vladimir Putin gave public support for candidate Viktor Yanukovych and made public visits to Ukraine on his behalf. According to Kempe and Solonenko, \"The overall interest of the Russian elite was to keep Ukraine as a reliable neighbor and partner.\" This was accomplished by channeling Russian funding and expertise directly into the campaign of Yanukovych or the government of Ukraine, in an effort described as \"nakedly partisan\". Meanwhile, the U.S., Canada, Poland and Slovakia gave money to build political parties in Ukraine. ===2014 election (by Russia)=== Pro-Russian hackers launched a series of cyberattacks over several days to disrupt the May 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, releasing hacked emails, attempting to alter vote tallies, and delaying the final result with distributed denial-of-service attacks. Malware that would have displayed a graphic declaring far-right candidate Dmytro Yarosh the electoral winner was removed from Ukraine's Central Election Commission less than an hour before polls closed.

Although it was recognized that negotiations were nearing a successful conclusion, the government of Iran delayed their release until after the election, potentially in retaliation for the decision of Carter to admit the deposed Iranian leader Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to the United States for cancer treatment. Opinions differ as to the intentional nature of the delay with regard to the outcome of the election.
