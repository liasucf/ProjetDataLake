Kwang-za represented her nation at the World Allround Speed Skating Championships for Women in 1967 in Deventer, the Netherlands.Inschrijving van wereldkampioenschap schaatsen dames, de Stem, 15 February 1967, p.13 After the first day with the 500m and 1500m, she didn't start the 1000m on the second day. So she didn't get an overall classification. She also competed at another international competition, including in Jekaterinburg (Russia) and Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia) in 1969 and in Paberezjnye Tsjelnye (Russia). Almost nothing is known about her early career, where she trained and her national competitions, as there isn\u2019t access to North Korean sources. A few of her North Korean results are known, where she rode a personal record. In December 1969 she set her 500 meter personal best in Pujon. With this time of 45,3 seconds she was fourth in the 500m season world ranking list at that moment, but dropped during the season.Sesongstatistikk, de 30 beste p\u00e5 hver distanse ortygia.no She rode her last personal best in February 1970 in Pyongyang in the 1500 meter. == Records== === Personal records === == References == == External links == * Category:1942 births Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:North Korean female speed skaters Category:Living people ",
