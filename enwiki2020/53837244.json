Muse Records Listing, accessed April 21, 2017 == Reception == The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow stated \"Cohn and Sims still had very complementary sounds and personalities, so their collaboration on Body and Soul (Muse) holds its own against their earlier dates. ... This is pleasing and frequently lyrical music\". On All About Jazz Joel Roberts called it \"a thoroughly enjoyable, low-key blowing session featuring the two tenor titans backed by an excellent veteran rhythm section\" and noted \"Cohn and Sims display that rare musical affinity that only years of playing together can breed\".Roberts, J.
