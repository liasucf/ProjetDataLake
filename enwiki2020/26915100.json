He is best remembered for his service as the Commandant of the Officer Training Unit Scheyville. ==Early years== Jack Studdert was born in Bungonia, New South Wales in December 1923, the oldest son of Charles Handcock Studdert and Bertha Geraldine Cripps-Clark. His father was born at Danganelly House in County Clare, Ireland, emigrated to Australia in 1912, and was the manager of the Spring Ponds property at Bungonia. Before his father's death in 1936, John (known as Pat to his family) moved with his parents, sister Vivien and brother Charles (known as Mick), to their own property (which Charles senior named Danganelly after his birthplace), on the banks of the Wollondilly River at Towrang, about 15 km north of Goulburn. John was educated at Goulburn High School. The property remains in the family, run since the mid-1950s by John's brother Mick.COL (retd) Martin Studdert AM (2003) Obituary \u2013 Brigadier John Handcock Studdert, AO, OBE, The Scheyvillian, O.T.U.
