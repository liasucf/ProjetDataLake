    "text": "Bo McMillin of Centre running on Harvard. The 1921 College Football All- Southern Team consists of American football players selected to the College Football All-Southern Teams selected by various organizations for the 1921 Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association football season. This was the last year before many schools left the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) for the Southern Conference (SoCon). Centre posted the SIAA's best record and upset Harvard 6-0\\. Georgia Tech was also undefeated in conference play, as were Georgia and Vanderbilt, the latter two posting one tie against the other. Vanderbilt was the only one to remain undefeated overall, and were selected as a national champion retroactively by selector Clyde Berryman. ==Composite eleven== Judy Harlan of Georgia Tech blocking for Red Barron. The composite All-Southern eleven awarded gold badges and formed by 30 sports writers culled by the Atlanta Constitution and Atlanta Journal included: *Red Barron, halfback for Georgia Tech, also an All-Southern baseball player who played pro ball with the Boston Braves. He later coached high school football. Sam Murray, who played later for Georgia Tech as a substitute fullback, was asked about a certain strong runner in the 1930s, \"He's good. But if I were playing again, I would have one wish - never to see bearing down upon me a more fearsome picture of power than Judy Harlan blocking for Red Barron.\" *Noah Caton, center for Auburn, died just a year later due to complications from an appendicitis operation. *Bum Day, center for Georgia. Not a single point was scored all year through Georgia's line, and over two years (1920 and 1921) Georgia did not lose to a single southern opponent. In 1918, as a player for Georgia Tech, Day was the first Southern player selected first-team All-American by Walter Camp. *Goat Hale, quarterback for Mississippi College, inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1963. Got the nickname \"Goat\" in high school when he battered through the line, scoring a touchdown, and ran past the end zone until his head hit a wooden building, loosening several planks. *Judy Harlan, fullback for Georgia Tech, a senior captain and third-team All-American. *Bo McMillin, quarterback for Centre College, unanimous selection, inaugural inductee into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951. He led Centre over defending national champion Harvard 6-0 in what is widely considered one of the greatest upsets in college football history. In 1919, he was the second southern player selected first-team All-American by Walter Camp. *Owen Reynolds, end for Georgia, played for the New York Giants in their inaugural season of 1925. *Artie Pew, tackle for Georgia. He was also the team's kicker as well as a basketball player. *Red Roberts, end for Centre, this year the fifth southern player selected first-team All-American by Walter Camp. Roberts was a unanimous selection for the Associated Press Southeast Area All-Time football team 1869\u20131919 era. Later coached the Waynesburg Yellow Jackets. *Albert Staton, tackle for Georgia Tech, the starting end on the all-time Heisman era team. *Puss Whelchel, guard for Georgia, captain-elect and third-team All- American. ==Composite overview== Bo McMillin was the only unanimous choice for the composite selection. Caton and Staton were picked out of the ties due to having the most votes at multiple positions. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"27%\" | Name ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"13%\" | Position ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"14%\" | School ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"10%\" | First-team selections |- align=\"left\" | Bo McMillin ||Quarterback || Centre || 30 |- align=\"left\" | Red Barron ||Halfback || Georgia Tech || 28 |- align=\"left\" | Owen Reynolds ||End || Georgia || 26 |- align=\"left\" | Red Roberts ||End || Centre || 26 |- align=\"left\" | Puss Whelchel ||Guard || Georgia|| 25 |- align=\"left\" | Bum Day ||Center || Georgia || 21 |- align=\"left\" | Judy Harlan || Fullback || Georgia Tech || 21 |- align=\"left\" | Goat Hale || Halfback|| Mississippi College || 20 |- align=\"left\" | Artie Pew || Tackle || Georgia || 19 |- align=\"left\" | Noah Caton|| Guard || Auburn || 9 |- align=\"left\" | Oscar Davis|| Guard||Georgia Tech||9 |- align=\"left\" | Albert Staton || Tackle || Georgia Tech|| 6 |- align=\"left\" | Joe Bennett || Tackle||Georgia ||6 |- align=\"left\" | Fletcher Skidmore||Tackle||Sewanee||6 |- align=\"left\" | Tootie Perry||Guard||Florida||1 |- align=\"left\" |} ==All-Southerns of 1921== ===Ends=== Red Roberts of Centre. *Owen Reynolds, Georgia (C, D, BD, JLR, MM, BCL, CEB, SM, MB, ED, GAB, MCK, EH, S, KS, CM, JS, FW, DH, TU) *Red Roberts, Centre (C, D, BD [as t], JLR, MM, BCL, CEB, SM, MB, ED, GAB, MCK.
