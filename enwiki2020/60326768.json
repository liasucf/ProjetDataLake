    "text": "Ann J. Cahill is an American philosopher and professor of philosophy at Elon University. Her research focuses on feminist philosophy, phenomenology and philosophy of the body. Her work has developed the concept of \u201cunjust sex,\" referring not only to sexual assault but also to situations where women are uncomfortably pressured to have sex, or to have sex without contraception. She has also argued that sexual assault survivors should be allowed the right to \"the freedom of silence,\" as talking about one's experiences of assault can aggravate their pain. Cahill holds a PhD in Philosophy from the State University of New York at Stony Brook. ==Bibliography== * Rethinking Rape (2001, Cornell University Press)https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801487187/rethinking-rape/ * Overcoming Objectification: A Carnal Ethics (2011, Routledge)https://www.routledge.com/Overcoming-Objectification-A-Carnal- Ethics-1st- Edition/Cahill/p/book/9780415882880https://blog.apaonline.org/2019/01/25/apa- member-interview-ann-cahill ==References== == External Links == * Elon University Profile Category:American non-fiction writers Category:Living people Category:Elon University faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Feminist philosophers Category:American philosophers Category:American feminist writers ",
