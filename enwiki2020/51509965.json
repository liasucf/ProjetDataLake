    "text": "Quentin Lepoutre (born March 30, 1987), professionally known as Myd , is a French musician, producer and sound engineer. Alongside his solo career as a house music artist on labels Marble, Bromance and then Ed Banger Records, he is a member of the electronic band Club Cheval and he produced tracks for artists like Brodinski and also French rap hits for SCH, Lacrim, Georgio and Alonzo. ==Career== Myd studied sound engineering from 2008 to 2011 in Paris at the prestigious cinema school La F\u00e9mis when he met Panteros666, Sam Tiba and Canblaster. They decided to make music together and they became Club Cheval. Alongside the band, in 2011, Myd released his first solo EP on Marble Records (Para One, Surkin and Bobmo label) and started to tour as a DJ internationally. At that time he did remixes for big names like Yelle or Two Door Cinema Club. In 2014, he co-composed entirely with Brodinski and Kore, Brodinski's first album Brava including featurings with Slim Thug, ILOVEMAKONNEN and Young Scooter. The same year, he moved to Kore's studios in Paris from who he became closer. In 2015, he co-composed French rap hits with Kore for SCH, Lacrim or Alonzo. He received in 2016 his first platinum disc. At that time he released his house influenced EP, N\u00famero Uno on Brodinski's label: Bromance Records. In 2016, Club Cheval released their debut album titled Discipline. In 2017, he composed the soundtrack for the French drama film Bloody Milk (French title: Petit paysan), directed by Hubert Charuel. For this film, Myd was nominated for the 43rd C\u00e9sar Awards in the \"Best Original Music\" category and he received the \"Valois de la musique\" at the 10th Angoul\u00eame Film Festival. The same year, after the defunct of Bromance Records, he became a member of Ed Banger Records. His first release on Ed Banger is an EP, consisting of 3 tracks, called All Inclusive. The release of the EP is accompanied by a video for \"All Inclusive\", directed by Alice Moiti\u00e9, as well as a photo album produced by the latter. We see Myd on a cruise ship, in all its forms, which suggests that the clip is a hidden camera. In 2018, he released the single \"Muchas\" featuring Cola Boyy. The clip, directed by Alice Moiti\u00e9, features around thirty false look-alikes of him. The same year, he produced more than half of the songs on the album XX5, by French rapper Georgio. In 2019, he released an EP, consisting of 3 tracks, titled Superdiscoteca. The same year, he produced the album Flavourite C\u00c2L\u00c2, by S\u00f4nge. In 2020, he released \"Together We Stand\", which to be expected the lead single for his upcoming debut album. The same year, he remixed songs for groups like Metronomy or Major Lazer among others. ==Discography== ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:250px;\" | Title !
