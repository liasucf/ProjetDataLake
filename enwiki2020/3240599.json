    "text": "Two clear view screens on the navigation bridge of a tugboat A clear view screen or clearview screen is a glass disk mounted in a window that rotates to disperse rain, spray, and snow. A clear view screen is typically driven by an electric motor at the center of the disk, and is often heated to prevent condensation or icing. Many fishermen call them a \"clear sight\". Clear view screens were originally developed in the mid-1930s for automobiles as a better option than standard windscreen wipers but were soon found more suitable for small boats and larger ships. On ships, a clear view screen is usually on the bridge and rotates at high speed (~1500 rpm). Clear view screens are also used in locomotives and rail transport. A clear view screen was utilised in filming the storm sequence of the movie Ryan's Daughter.Shooting the storm sequence through a clear view screen File:Rotating windshield wiper.jpg|Detail image from inside of a clear view screen on R/V Knorr File:JNR DD51 111.JPG|A clear view screen of the Type DD51 diesel locomotive in Hokkaid\u014d, Japan File:Sapporo Tram Type Yuki 10 001.JPG|Sasara Trams of Sapporo Streetcar are equipped with clear view screens ==See also== * Edgar de Normanville (1882-1968), developed the idea of a rotating disc to clear drops of water from a windscreen == References == Category:Watercraft components Category:Windows ",
