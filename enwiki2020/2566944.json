    "text": "Donkey's Tail (, Romanized: Osliniy khvost) was a Russian artistic group created from the most radical members of the Jack of Diamonds group. The group included such painters as: Mikhail Larionov (inventor of the name), Natalia Goncharova, Kazimir Malevich, Marc Chagall, and Aleksandr Shevchenko. The group, according to Gino Severini in his autobiography, was Futurist; it is known that, even if they were not, they were certainly influenced by the Cubo- Futurism movement. The only exhibition of the group took place in Moscow in 1912 (notable for being the start of Malevich's entry into his Cubo-Futurist phase), and in 1913, the group fell apart. == Gallery == File:Cyclist (Goncharova, 1913).jpg|Natalia Goncharova, Cyclist, 1913 File:Chagall IandTheVillage.jpg|Marc Chagall, I and the Village, 1911 == References == ==Bibliography== * Voloshin \u041b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 (Faces of creativity) - Leningrad: Nauka, 1988. - pp. 287\u2013289. * Pospelov, G. \u0411\u0443\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0442 (Jack of Diamonds) - Moscow: Soviet artist, 1990. - .
