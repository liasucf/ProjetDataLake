    "text": "Bianca Andreescu won her first Grand Slam title, defeating Serena Williams in the final, 6\u20133, 7\u20135 to win the Women's Singles tennis title at the 2019 US Open. Andreescu became the first Canadian player, as well as the first player born in the 2000s, to win a Grand Slam singles title. In addition, Andreescu was the youngest person since Svetlana Kuznetsova in the 2004 US Open to win a Grand Slam title, the first teenager to win a Grand Slam singles title since Maria Sharapova at the 2006 US Open and the first woman to win the US Open on her main draw debut. With the victory, Andreescu entered the top 5 of the rankings for the first time in her career. Naomi Osaka was the defending champion, but lost to Belinda Bencic in the fourth round. By making the final, Williams set a new record for the longest gap between a player's first and most recent major final appearances, her first being at the 1999 US Open. She also equalled the record for most match wins at the US Open (101) held by Chris Evert. For the fourth time in her career, Williams was attempting to equal Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles and she was also attempting to win an Open Era record seventh US Open title. Despite losing in the fourth round, Ashleigh Barty regained the WTA No. 1 singles ranking at the end of the tournament. Besides Barty and Osaka, Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 and Simona Halep were also in contention for the top ranking at the start of the tournament. ==Seeds== ==Qualifying== ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ===Bottom half=== ====Section 5==== ====Section 6==== ====Section 7==== ====Section 8==== ==Championship match ratings== 3.219 million watched on ESPN in the US.
