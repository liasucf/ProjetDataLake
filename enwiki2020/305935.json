    "text": "Phelsuma astriata astriata is a subspecies of Seychelles small day gecko. It is a small, slender lizard with bright green colour that feeds primarily on insects. It is found on several islands of the Seychelles. == Description == Its body is lime green with coloured dots and bars on the back. Those reddish dots sometimes form a mid-dorsal stripe, which can be very faint. Males often have a bluish or turquoise-coloured tail and lower back. On both sides of the snout, a reddish-brown stripe extends from the nostrils to the eyes. The undersurface of the body is off-white. These lizards reach a total length of about 14 cm. == Distribution == This gecko is found on the Seychelles islands of Astove, Mah\u00e9, Praslin, Curieuse, La Digue, and Fr\u00e9gate. == Habitat == This species is typically found on coconut palms and banana trees. It often lives near human settlements. == Reproduction == Phelsuma astriata astriata normally lays two 10 mm eggs. Seychelles small day geckos are not gluers; they do not stick their eggs to the sides/underside of items, but instead place them in safe, well-hidden areas. Incubation is generally 65 \u2013 70 days at 82 degrees Fahrenheit.Day Geckos in Captivity, Leann and Greg Christenson, Page 113 (2002) == Bibliography == *Henkel, F. W. and Schmidt, W.
