Currently the encrypted signal is beamed via AsiaSat 3S across China and South Korea (Via SBS). In the beginning, it was broadcast via cable in Hong Kong, and via satellite to Taiwan, and other regions worldwide besides the mainland. Due to stiff competition from other Chinese movie channels, the channel was withdrawn from those regions. The movies are aired in their original language and occasionally comes with Chinese Subtitles (China) and Korean Subtitles (South Korea). Phoenix Movies Channel showcases Hollywood blockbusters, Chinese top hits as well as international award- winning titles. Over 280 movie titles are shown each month, of which 80% are Asian productions from libraries including Golden Harvest, Golden Princess and Media Asia featuring renowned directors like Wong Kar-wai, Tsui Hark, as well as top artists such as Jackie Chan, Chow Yun-fat, Tony Leung, Maggie Chow, Andy Lau, Stephen Chow, and Leon Lai. The remaining 20% of the programming comprises Hollywood and international blockbusters. To preserve the originality of the movies, all films are shown in original soundtracks with Chinese subtitles. == Related Channels == *Phoenix Chinese Channel *Phoenix InfoNews Channel *Phoenix Chinese News and Entertainment Channel *Phoenix Hong Kong Channel == External links == * Phoenix Movies Site in Chinese Category:Television networks in China Category:Cable television in Hong Kong Category:Television channels and stations established in 1998 ",
