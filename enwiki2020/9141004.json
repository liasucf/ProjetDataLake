In the west Sapekhati, in south Arunachal Pradesh, in north are parts of Dibrugarh district including Namrup, Assam. There is a small railway station named Borhat (BFD) which is in the central place of the region. During Ahom rule, Borhat was known as a place for finding mineral salt. The name Borhat is originated from Bor '\u09ac\u09f0' (meaning big '\u09a1\u09be\u0999\u09f0' ) and hat '\u09b9\u09be\u099f' (market '\u09ac\u099c\u09be\u09f0'). There was a market place where salt was available. Salt was considered to be very precious during Ahom rule as Assam is far from the seas and people had to use only mineral salts. Modern day Borhat has a number of tea gardens, some of them founded by the British and many families have small tea plantations in their orchard. Its main educational institutes include Borhat Higher Secondary School, Borhat New High school, Borhat Jatiya Vidyalaya, Sankardev Shisu Niketon, Borhat Mojolia Vidyalaya (Sokolia), and Borhat B.P.B.M college. There is a branch of State Bank of India (SBI) situated in middle of its region. It also has an Assam Gramin Vikash Bank (AGVB) branch. There is also a post office and a primary health centre serving the area. Category:Cities and towns in Sivasagar district Category:Sivasagar ",
