    "text": "Kapamilya Channel (, stylized as Kapamilya channel) is a Philippine pay television network owned and operated by ABS-CBN Corporation, a company under the Lopez Group. The network is headquartered at the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center in Quezon City where it started broadcasting on June 13, 2020 at 5:30 a.m. with Kapamilya Daily Mass as its first program. The network serves as the replacement of ABS-CBN's main terrestrial network after ceasing its free-to- air broadcast operations as ordered by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) on May 5, 2020 due to the expiration of its legislative franchise. It carries most of programs that ABS-CBN aired prior to the shutdown. ==Overview== The channel is available through most of the cable providers who are members of the Philippine Cable and Telecommunications Association (PCTA) (including ABS-CBN's Sky Cable) and through direct broadcast satellite television service Sky Direct (until June 30, 2020). This allowed ABS-CBN Corporation to continue producing and distributing content while the outcome of their congressional franchise application was still pending at that time since the NTC's cease and desist order for ABS-CBN only covers Channel 2 and all of its free-to-air television and radio stations. The network's franchise renewal has since rejected by the House of Representatives on July 10, 2020, voted 70\u201311 to deny. The network also streams live and makes most of its shows available on the streaming service iWantTFC. On August 1, 2020, the network officially launched the Kapamilya Online Live, which livestreams some of contents from Kapamilya Channel and Jeepney TV on the online video-sharing platforms Facebook and YouTube. Although the network itself is available only in the Philippines, most of its local programs are available on ABS-CBN's international subscription service The Filipino Channel via cable, online and IPTV. Kapamilya Channel broadcast 24 hours daily, with O Shopping and Movie Central Presents serve as their overnight programming. ==Programming== Kapamilya Channel features shows that have aired or were slated to air on ABS-CBN whose productions were suspended due to the Luzon enhanced community quarantine in March 2020 as well as the ensuing uncertainty following the NTC's cease and desist order. These include the variety shows It's Showtime (with three new segments) and ASAP Natin 'To; the second season of singing competition The Voice Teens; teleseryes Ang Probinsyano, A Soldier's Heart, and Love Thy Woman; and morning talk show Magandang Buhay. Two new locally-produced programs, Paano Kita Mapasasalamatan? hosted by Judy Ann Santos, and Iba 'Yan hosted by Angel Locsin, also made their debut on Kapamilya Channel. Contrary to earlier news reports, ABS-CBN's primary news program, TV Patrol, as well as several news and current affairs programs, was not initially aired on the Kapamilya Channel (as it did through the free-to- air channel) until after July 24; the program did air exclusively on TeleRadyo, ANC, and Cine Mo! and streamed through the ABS-CBN News' Facebook page and YouTube channel until the said date. The delayed telecast of ANC's The World Tonight also began to air at 10:00 pm on the following Monday, July 27, making the two longest-running Filipino and English language evening newscasts in the country airing on the same channel once again since 1999. The morning simulcast of TeleRadyo's programming (which was also aired on ABS-CBN as a provisionary morning program prior to the shutdown) on the schedule remained the same. An evening 30-minute News Patrol program was aired on the Kapamilya Channel until July 24. New offerings also include The World of a Married Couple, 2gether: The Series, and Still 2gether. Other upcoming shows such as the Thai dramas Come To Me and I'm Tee, Me Too are also expected to air as part of the acquired foreign programs. On September 12, 2020, the network launched the Just Love Kids, a children's programming block focusing on educational programs and animated series that have previously aired on ABS- CBN, Knowledge Channel, and the now-defunct Yey! channel. The children's show Team Yey! premiered its new fifth season for the first time on Kapamilya Channel. On October 10, 2020, selected programs from Kapamilya Channel will be also aired on A2Z Channel 11, a free-to-air television channel joint-venture between ABS-CBN and ZOE Broadcasting Network through a blocktime agreement. Online streaming on their channel's official website and Kapamilya Online Live (with the exception of iWantTFC) does not include contents such as acquired programming, movie blocks and overnight programming, as the live streaming itself only airs original programming due to the copyright restrictions. ==References== ==External links== * Category:ABS-CBN Category:ABS-CBN Corporation Category:Assets owned by ABS-CBN Corporation Category:Filipino- language television stations Category:Television networks in the Philippines Category:Television channels and stations established in 2020 Category:2020 establishments in the Philippines ",
