The Osseointegration Group of Australia Team is made up of specialists from various fields including prosthetics, physio, rehabilitation, anesthesia and psychology. Osseointegration surgery involves the insertion of a titanium implant into the femur or tibia of an amputee. The implant than connects with an external prosthetic component which eliminates the need for traditional rigid socket prosthetics. The surgery and the follow up from the team aims to provide patients with a greater quality of life through increased mobility and reduced discomfort. The group offers support before and after the surgery providing rehabilitation, physiotherapy and pain management. == Notable surgeries == The Osseointegration Group of Australia clinics at Norwest Private Hospital in Sydney are known worldwide as centres of excellence, according to NEWS.
