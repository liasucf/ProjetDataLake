    "text": "Cover of the first edition of the publication Everyman His Own Football (German: Jedermann sein eigner Fussball) Jedermann sein eigner Fussball (\"Everyman His Own Football\") was a single-issue illustrated magazine published by Malik Verlag (Wieland Herzfelde's publishing house). The satirical tabloid was published on 15 February 1919; police arrested staff and confiscated copies immediately on publication. It included two photomontages by John Heartfield on the front cover and six line drawings by George Grosz. Texts by Herzfelde, Walter Mehring, Mynona; other contributors jointly credited include Richard Huelsenbeck, Erwin Piscator, Karl Nierendorf, and J.H. Kuhlemann. The cover's typeface and layout satirise contemporary trends in conservative German newspaper design. The issue contains photomontages such as Heartfield\u2019s \"Wer ist der Sch\u00f6nste? (who is the most beautiful?),\" a proposed beauty contest of political, government, and military leaders whose faces are playfully spread across an open fan. In spite of its absurdist amusements, this singular issue was a work of impassioned radical opinion, published only a few weeks after the communist revolt in Berlin had been quashed by Gustav Noske's Free Corps, and Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg executed. \"Jedermann sein eigner Fussball\" is an example of Berlin Dada in its most aggravated political phase. ==Sources== *hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk *arslibri.com related: *Germany 1916-33: A Selective Chronology Category:1919 establishments in Germany Category:1919 disestablishments in Germany Category:Artists' books Category:Dada Category:Defunct magazines published in Germany Category:Visual arts magazines published in Germany Category:German- language magazines Category:Magazines established in 1919 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1919 Category:Magazines published in Berlin Category:Bi- monthly magazines published in Germany ",
