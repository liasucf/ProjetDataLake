    "text": "Andrew Mark Brough (7 May 1963 \u2013 2 February 2020) was a singer, songwriter and guitarist from Dunedin, New Zealand. Best known for his work with the Straitjacket Fits, he later led the band Bike. In 1996 he was shortlisted for the APRA Silver Scroll and in 2008 he was inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame. == Early life == Brough was born in Wellington in 1963, the eldest of four children of former missionary Gordon Brough and his wife Catherine. The family moved to Dargaville in the Northland Region when Andrew was about three, and later to Christchurch. Andrew's parents separated in the early 1970s, with Gordon moving south to Dunedin. Andrew joined him around 1974, with his siblings (two boys and a girl) staying in Christchurch, and would attend Logan Park High School. == The Blue Meanies and The Orange == Brough, who had always been a keen singer, began his rock music career as the singer for university student band The Blue Meanies, alongside Martin Kean on bass, Max Satchell on guitar and Richard Allen on drums. They were regular performers at venues like Dunedin's Empire Tavern, but didn't leave behind any studio recordings. At the time, Brough was influenced by 1960s pop. \"I spent three or four years listening to that music after I left school. [...] In the sixties they had a strong sense of melody, which influenced me a lot.\" Following the demise of The Blue Meanies, Brough formed the Dunedin sound three-piece The Orange with Jonathan Moore (bass, formerly of Bored Games) and Peter Bragan (drums) in 1984. He had \"hated just being a frontman\", so played guitar as well as singing with The Orange. They played gigs in Dunedin at venues including the Oriental Tavern, where a live recording of the song 'Number One' was made in 1985. It was included in a local compilation tape, Whistle Up A Wind, the next year. Their only studio recording, a five-track EP entitled Fruit Salad Lives, was released by Flying Nun Records shortly before the band broke up in 1986. Writing under the pseudonym 'Buffy O'Reilly', Shayne Carter said that \"Brough's airy vocals and melodic, unabrasive guitar lends the five track EP a floating, almost Chilly quality.\" Later that year, The Orange disbanded when Brough and Carter became bandmates. == Straitjacket Fits (1986\u20131991)== Brough became better known as guitarist and vocalist alongside Shayne Carter in Straitjacket Fits, a role he held from 1986 (prior to that band's first release) until 1991, when he left the group following the tour to support their second album, Melt. In his book, Dead People I Have Known, Carter writes that Straitjacket Fits began as a three-piece, with a mutual friend recommending Brough as a fourth member. \u2033Andrew seemed a good fit for our band, because I really wanted to have harmonies and another singer, like in The Beatles. The first time Andrew stepped on the mic and played his round, Revolver guitar, we knew we'd hit on a sound.\" Shayne Carter and Andrew Brough were often likened to Lennon and McCartney \u2013 a pair of songwriting, guitar-playing bandmates with different styles (one tending towards pop and the other more aggressive), which made for a successful musical collaboration but a difficult personal dynamic. Brough was a regular backing vocalist, his voice providing a contrasting counterpoint to Carter's. In his five years with the band he wrote and sang seven songs. ===Life in One Chord EP (1987)=== 'Sparkle That Shines' was on the band's debut release, the Life in One Chord EP (1987), and also the UK/US version of Hail (1988). Looking back on the song, Brough said \"I don\u2019t like the singing so much [...] because it\u2019s quite pompous and young. [...] I remember in the studio when it was coming together, you could tell that it was going to work.\" But he liked the band's first recording: \"The first EP, I was really proud of. I was thinking, 'Shit, I\u2019m on that! I was part of that', it was good.\" ===Hail and touring (1988\u20131989)=== 'Take From the Years' and 'Fabulous Things' are found on all versions of Hail (the New Zealand version didn't include 'Sparkle That Shines', but the US/UK one did). Brough said that the album \"didn\u2019t come to fruition musically. It wasn\u2019t something I was proud of. [...] I did two songs on that Hail record, and I didn\u2019t like either of them very much.\" In 1989 Straitjacket Fits toured overseas for the first time, visiting the USA and Europe. \"For me it was just a big holiday, to see the world. I was so into American movies and American culture [...] It didn\u2019t bother me if we didn\u2019t have a good gig or not, we were there, doing it!\" ===Melt (1990)=== Melt (1990) included 'Down in Splendour', 'Such a Daze', and 'Hand in Mine'. Another Brough song, 'In Spite of it All', was recorded during sessions for Melt and included on the Missing From Melt EP (it was also the b-side of the 'Bad Note For a Heart' single). 'Down in Splendour' was released as a single (Audioculture calls it \"the most radio and record company friendly track on the album\") and became Brough's most successful Straitjacket Fits song. In 2001, it was voted 32nd in the APRA Top 100 New Zealand Songs of All Time. ===Departure (1991) and recognition (2008)=== Brough's time with Straitjacket Fits ended after the band toured North America in 1991, when he \"thought that musically I wasn't achieving what I wanted to achieve\". Their American label, Arista, wanted more Brough songs from the band and Brough himself also wanted to write more. The other three members of the band preferred Carter's heavier numbers. There had been \"a good tension\" between the two songwriters, but \"the last few weeks of that American tour were quite argumentative.\" Carter believed that Brough had stopped committing to the band: \"Andrew went off on a really weird trip, and completely dark-manned out. He wasn\u2019t trying at gigs, he would actually give up on stage, we\u2019d be playing a show, and look across at this dude who was sitting there. It just became impossible to work together, and it was no fun either.\" In a 2008 interview, bassist David Wood said that Shayne Carter and Andrew Brough had \"no relationship\" and \"the two did not work closely together\". Brough left Auckland and moved to Dunedin. Mark Peterson replaced him and was a member of Straitjacket Fits until their split in 1994. While a lot of focus was given to the tension between them, Shayne Carter has written that they also had a lot of common ground. He praised the melody and extra dimension Brough brought to the band, and wrote that Straitjacket Fits \"never worked as well\" and \"became a plainer band\" without Brough. Brough was invited but did not take part in a Straitjacket Fits reunion in 2005. In September 2008 all five band members, including Brough, received the Legacy Award at the New Zealand Music Awards, and were inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame at the APRA Silver Scroll Awards. == Bike (1992\u20131998)== After leaving Straitjacket Fits Brough moved to Dunedin, then Auckland. In Dunedin he spent 6 months writing songs, then re-emerged fronting a group known as Tumble before switching the name to Bike (inspired by the 1967 Pink Floyd song of the same name). Brough's new band played their first show in Dunedin in October 1992, supporting The Verlaines. In Auckland he put together Bike's first acknowledged line-up, finding drummer Karl Buckley through an advertisement, then recruiting bassist Tristan Mason through a family connection of Buckley's. (Buckley was later replaced by Wayne Bell, then Bevan Sweeney). Bike was deliberately designed as a vehicle for Brough's songs. After being a minority contributor to Straitjacket Fits he wanted to \"be in charge of a band where I have to write music\". Brough described Bike's sound as \"powerful pop songs\", while others used descriptions like \"soothing, cheerful and sunny\". Dave Eggleton, in Ready To Fly, said \"Bike's sound was a homage to 1960's psychedalia\". Bike first toured New Zealand in 1994, having already been offered an album deal by Flying Nun but not yet released any music. Their first song to be released was \"My Love, My Life\", on 1995 Abba tribute album Abbasalutely. Brough described the song as, \"drippy - yes but with a worthy enough hook to throw some guitars at.\"Liner notes, Abbasalutely, Flying Nun Records FNCD315 D31437, 1995 Bike released a self-titled EP in 1996: the song 'Save My Life', was a songwriting finalist at the 1996 APRA Silver Scrolls, and Bike was nominated as 'most promising new band' at the New Zealand Music Awards. ===Take in the Sun === 'Save My Life' was followed up with the single 'Circus Kids' in 1997, and a debut record, Take in the Sun, later that year. Through the previous years of writing, rehearsing and touring, Brough had a clear template for the album before recording began. \"The fact that most of the songs were demoed to death in the proceeding couple of years, meant that going into the studio, I had it fairly well worked out what it was going to sound like in the end, just through a lot of four-track demoing.\" While the album was funded by Mushroom Records, like all of Bike's material it was released by Flying Nun Records. The American version of the album, part of the March Records catalogue, had a slightly altered cover with different typography. Take in the Sun made the New Zealand album charts, at number 47, in October 1997. The band toured New Zealand and overseas to support the release, while Brough was featured on the covers of magazines including Pavement and Real Groove. Increased media attention, including a large photo in a Sunday newspaper, led Brough to worry about being \"recognised in the street\". The video for Welcome to My World featured Shayne Carter, Brough's old Straitjacket Fits bandmate, as a policeman. Along with the Circus Kids video, it was directed by Jonathan King. The Save My Life video was directed by Mark Tierney. Bike's music was sometimes heard in the background of television soaps including Australia's Home and Away. This was believed to be main source of Brough's music-related income. As long-time broadcaster Jonathan Alley of RRR recounts, \"After a Bike song was licensed for use on television, it created [for] Andrew a bit of windfall and with that money he brought a house.\" ==Andy Dandy (2000)== The last Andrew Brough song to be released was a version of James K. Baxter's poem Andy Dandy. It was made especially for the 2000 album Baxter. Brough's was one of 12 contributions to the project, which was conceived and managed by musician Charlotte Yates. He was initially reluctant to accept her invitation to be a part of Baxter, and chose not to appear at the accompanying concert. Music critic Graham Reid said that \"Andrew Brough has taken one of Baxter's children's poems and turned it into an archetypical dreamscape of layered guitars.\" ==Death== Brough died in Dunedin on 2 February 2020. Public reports of his death were first made two days later, on 4 February. He was 56 years old. ==References== ==External links== * Bike, Straitjacket Fits, and The Orange profiles on Audioculture * * * Bike \u2013 1997 Single 'Welcome to my world' * * * Category:1963 births Category:2020 deaths Category:APRA Award winners Category:Musicians from Dunedin Category:Flying Nun Records artists Category:Musicians from Wellington Category:People educated at Logan Park High School Category:Dunedin Sound musicians Category:Straitjacket Fits members ",
