    "text": "Avicularioidea is a clade of mygalomorph spiders, one of the two main clades into which mygalomorphs are divided (the other being Atypoidea). It has been treated at the rank of superfamily. ==Taxonomy== The division of Mygalomorphae into two clades, Atypoidea and Avicularioidea, has been established in many studies. Avicularioidea has been treated as a superfamily (at one time including all mygalomorph spiders), although other authors have placed superfamilies, such as Theraphosoidea, within Avicularioidea. The name is based on the family name \"Aviculariidae\", a junior synonym of Theraphosidae, ultimately deriving from the genus Avicularia. The Atypoidea retain some vestiges of abdominal segmentation in the form of dorsal tergites; the Avicularioidea lack these. Relationships within the Avicularioidea are not settled . Some established families have been shown not to be monophyletic. In 2018, the family Hexathelidae was split up, and three new families created within the Avicularioidea: Atracidae, Macrothelidae and Porrhothelidae. Further changes are possible in future. ===Families=== The families included in the Avicularoidea are: * Actinopodidae * Atracidae \u2013 Australian funnel-web spiders * Barychelidae \u2013 brushed trapdoor spiders * Ctenizidae * Cyrtaucheniidae \u2013 wafer trapdoor spiders * Dipluridae \u2013 curtain-web spiders * Euctenizidae * Halonoproctidae * Hexathelidae * Idiopidae \u2013 armoured trapdoor spiders * Macrothelidae * Microstigmatidae * Migidae \u2013 tree trapdoor spiders * Nemesiidae * Paratropididae \u2013 baldlegged spiders * Porrhothelidae * Theraphosidae \u2013 tarantulas Plus the extinct family Fossilcalcaridae and the incertae sedis genera Cretamygale and Rosamygale. ==References== Category:Mygalomorphae ",
