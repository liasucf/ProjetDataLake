He works in the field of public art, creating large-scale, concept-driven works installed in urban environments including in parks, railway stations, art galleries, meditation chambers, at intersections, under freeways, and on sidewalks. His approach is a mixture of sculpture, installation, theatrical design, architecture, and landscape design. Media include metal, glass, concrete, fiberglass, gravel, LEDs, lasers, neon, solar panels, radar detectors, photo-voltaic cells, infra-red cameras, motors, searchlights, and occasionally elements such as fire, water, and smoke. His work frequently incorporates cutting-edge technology in lighting, sound, and other electronic media.City of Santa Monica Cultural Affairs - Digital Divide by Dan Corson, Digital Divide ==Career== Corson served as the first Artist-in- Residence for the City of Seattle's \"% for Arts program\" in 2001. His work is often interactive and incorporates elements such as photoelectric switches which the spectator can trigger and cause the artwork to respond. Typical is Emerald Aura a temporary laser sculpture in Memphis Tennessee that used Infrared cameras and surveillance software to track pedestrians and project the processed computer generated images back onto the people in real time. This installation is typical of Corson\u2019s work in the way that it combine artistic expression with an implied statement about our culture.UrbanArt Commission Looks to Color Downtown, by Andy Meek Memphis Daily News Some of Corson's works interact not with people, but with the environment. Examples include Nepenthes, whimsical fiberglass sculptures on sidewalks in Portland that are covered with photo-voltaic cells that glow at night, and Sonic Bloom at Seattle's Pacific Science Center which features solar panels and gigantic metal flowers that light up at night. The flowers also hum when people approach them.Smithsonian Magazine: Sonic Bloom!
