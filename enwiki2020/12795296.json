    "text": "The Rerun Show is an American sketch comedy television series that aired on NBC from August 1, 2002 until August 20, 2002. VH1 also aired the show on Fridays at 11:30 P.M. The series was created by John Davies and David Salzman. ==Synopsis== The show spoofed many popular classics including The Jeffersons, The Facts of Life, Married... with Children, What's Happening!!, Saved by the Bell, Diff'rent Strokes, Bewitched, The Partridge Family, and One Day at a Time. Each episode consisted of two sitcom parodies poking fun at the actors who originally played the roles while twisting the original episodes' subtext. On some episodes, the original actors would make appearances (i.e. Gary Coleman in a Diff'rent Strokes parody). The series started with strong ratings, debuting in the Top 10. However, ratings soon dropped off and NBC canceled the series after seven episodes. Cast members Paul Vogt and Daniele Gaither would later join the cast of MADtv during seventh through eleventh seasons. ==Cast== * Paul Vogt * Brian Beacock * Ashley Eckstein * Candy Ford * Daniele Gaither * Danielle Hoover - Shirley Partridge * Donald Gene Reed * Mitch Silpa ===Guest stars=== * Aries Spears * Marla Gibbs * Gary Coleman * David Faustino * Erik Estrada * Dennis Haskins * Todd Bridges * Dustin Diamond * Fred 'Rerun' Berry * Alfonso Ribeiro * Danny Bonaduce * Alex Michel ==Episodes== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#EFFFEA\" |- style=\"color:#EFFFEA\" ! style=\"background:#000000\"| N\u00ba ! style=\"background:#000000\"| Title ! style=\"background:#000000\"| Air date |- ! 1 | Diff'rent Strokes: \"The Rivals\" / The Partridge Family: \"Keith and Lauriebelle\" | |- bgcolor=\"EFFFDA\" ! 2 | The Facts of Life: \"Shoplifting\" / The Jeffersons: \"A Bedtime Story\" | |- ! 3 | What's Happening!!: \"Rerun Gets Married\" / Bewitched: \"Divided He Falls\" | |- bgcolor=\"EFFFDA\" ! 4 | Saved by the Bell: \"Jessie's Song\" / The Jeffersons: \"Florence in Love\" | |- ! 5 | One Day at a Time: \"Pressure\" / Saved by the Bell: \"Miss Bayside\" | |- bgcolor=\"EFFFDA\" ! 6 | The Partridge Family: \"My Son, the Feminist\" / Married... with Children: \"The Dance Show\" | |- ! 7 | \" Bewitched: \"A Bunny for Tabitha\" | |} ==Ratings== *Episode 1 (2002-08-01) - 9.4 million viewers *Episode 2 (2002-08-06) - 5.8 million *Episode 3 (2002-08-08) - 6.6 million *Episode 4 (2002-08-13) - 5.0 million *Episode 5 (2002-08-15) - 5.9 million *Episode 6 (2002-08-20) - 4.7 million *Episode 7 (2002-08-20) - 4.5 million ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2002 American television series debuts Category:2002 American television series endings Category:2000s American parody television series Category:2000s American sketch comedy television series Category:NBC original programming Category:Television series about television Category:Television series by Sony Pictures Television Category:Television series by Universal Television ",
