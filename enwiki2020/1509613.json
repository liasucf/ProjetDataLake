    "text": "The Porcupine River (Ch\u2019\u00f4onjik in Gwich\u2019in) is a tributary of the Yukon River in Canada and the United States. It begins in the Ogilvie Mountains north of Dawson City, Yukon, Canada. From there it flows north through the community of Old Crow, veers southwest into the U.S. state of Alaska, and enters the larger river at Fort Yukon. It derives its name from the Gwich'in word for the river, Ch'oonjik, or \"Porcupine Quill River\". The Porcupine caribou herd, in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) Alaska, gets its name from the river. The oldest (but disputed) possible evidence of human habitation in North America was found in a cave along one of its tributaries, the Bluefish River. Many apparently human-modified animal bones have been discovered in the Bluefish Caves. They have been dated to 25,000 to 40,000 years old by radiocarbon dating--several thousand years earlier than generally accepted human habitation of North America. ==Boating== The Porcupine River offers the possibility of \"an excellent novice river trip for those experienced in remote wilderness travel,\" according to author Karen Jettmar. Boaters can travel by canoe, kayak, or raft, though rafters may have difficulty with upriver winds. A float trip beginning at Summit Lake in the Yukon Territory, descending the Bell River to its confluence with the Porcupine, and continuing to Fort Yukon is all rated Class I (easy) on the international scale of river difficulty. However, in high water the difficulty may rise to Class II in Upper and Lower Rampart canyons, downstream of the international border, where the current is swift. ==See also== *Old Crow River *List of longest rivers of Canada *List of rivers of Alaska *List of rivers of Yukon ==References== ==Works cited== * Benke, Arthur C., ed., and Cushing, Colbert E., ed.; Bailey, Robert C.
