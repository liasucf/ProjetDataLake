    "text": "The Rossendale Weavers', Winders' and Beamers' Association was a trade union representing cotton industry workers in the Rossendale area of Lancashire in England. The union was founded in 1873, and affiliated to the North East Lancashire Amalgamated Weavers' Association in 1877. However, it left this \"First Amalgamation\" in 1880, and remained unaffiliated until 1892, when it belatedly joined the Amalgamated Weavers' Association By the 1890s, the union had more than 1,500 members, and this continued to grow, reaching 2,800 in 1907, then falling back a little to 2,000 by 1920. Thereafter, it declined in line with employment in the Lancashire textile trade, falling to only 1,020 in 1960. That year, the Haslingden Weavers' Association merged in, the union relocating its office to Haslingden, and renaming itself as the Rossendale Valley Textile Workers' Association, membership recovering to 2,555. In 1977, the union merged into the Burnley, Nelson and District Textile Workers' Union, which accordingly renamed itself as the Burnley, Nelson, Rossendale and District Textile Workers' Union. ==General Secretaries== :J.
