She was shortly afterwards deported to Germany and murdered by the Nazis in Bernburg Euthanasia Centre Olga was born in Munich as Olga Gutmann Ben\u00e1rio, to a Jewish family. Her father, Leo Ben\u00e1rio, was a Social Democrat lawyer, and her mother, Eugenie (Gutmann), was a member of Bavarian high-society. In 1923, aged fifteen, she joined the Communist Youth International and in 1928 helped organize her lover and comrade Otto Braun's escape from Moabit prison.Teresa A. Meade, A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present, Malden: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, , page 186 She went to Czechoslovakia and from there, reunited with Braun, to Moscow, where Ben\u00e1rio attended the Lenin-School of the Comintern and then worked as an instructor of the Communist Youth International, in the Soviet Union and in France and Great Britain, where she participated in coordinating so-called \u201canti-fascist activities\u201d (Soviet covert action, as France and Great Britain were parliamentary democracies). She parted from Otto Braun in 1931. After her stay in Britain, where she was briefly arrested,Nigel West, MASK: MI5's penetration of the Communist Party of Great Britain. New York: Routledge, 2005, ,page 23 Olga attended a course in the Zhukovsky Military Academy, leading some historians to view her as an agent of Soviet military intelligence.See the anticommunist history of the 1935 uprising in Brazil by TV Globo journalist William Waack, Camaradas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Cia. das Letras, 1993, , page 94 (a version which is repeated by Shawn C. Smallman, Fear & memory in the Brazilian army and society, 1889-1954, University of North Carolina Press, 2002 page 51); Waack admits, however, that according to existing archival evidence Olga's actual affiliation to Soviet intelligence is only a possibility, albeit a strong one: Camaradas, page 100 Due to her military training, in 1934 she was given the task of helping the return to Brazil of Lu\u00eds Carlos Prestes, to whom she was assigned as a bodyguard.Katherine Morris, ed., Odyssey of exile: Jewish women flee the Nazis for Brazil. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1996, , page 126 In order to accomplish this mission, false papers were created stating that they were a Portuguese married couple. By the time they arrived at Rio de Janeiro in 1935, this cover had become a reality, as the couple had fallen in love. After a failed insurrection in November 1935, Ben\u00e1rio and her husband went into hiding, and after barely escaping a police raid at Ipanema,Having as an unwitting witness the writer Pedro Nava, who wrote about the episode in his memoir Galo-das-trevas: as doze velas imperfeitas. S\u00e3o Paulo: Ateli\u00ea Editorial, 2003, , 451 they were both eventually arrested in January 1936, during the harsh anti-communist campaign declared after Get\u00falio Vargas had proclaimed martial law and was already plotting the 1937 coup that eventually led to the institution of the fascist-like Estado Novo r\u00e9gime. Olga Ben\u00e1rio Prestes Pregnant and separated from Prestes, Ben\u00e1rio clung to her alias, only to have her real identity disclosed by Brazilian diplomats, working hand-in- hand with the Gestapo.Jo\u00e3o Henrique Botteri Negr\u00e3o, Selvagens e Incendi\u00e1rios: O Discurso Anticomunista do Governo Vargas. S\u00e3o Paulo: Humanitas/FAPESP, 2005, ,page 163 Her lawyers attempted to avoid extradition by means of a habeas corpus at the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court based on her pregnancy, because extradition would have left a newborn Brazilian national in the power of a foreign government. As Brazilian law forbids the extradition of nationals,Carmen Tiburcio, The human rights of aliens under international and comparative law. The Hague: Kluwer Law International, ,pages 132/133 Olga's lawyers expected to win time until Olga gave birth on Brazilian soil to an ipso facto Brazilian citizen - irrespective of the child's paternity, which remained legally doubtful in the absence of evidence for Olga's and Prestes' marriageVargas' propagandists at the time sustained that Prestes' mariage was a sham, a cover for the fact that Olga had been posted besides him as a liaison for the Soviet political police: Robert M. Levine, Father of the poor?: Vargas and his era. Cambridge University Press, 1998, , page 43 \\- something that would have rendered extradition quite unlikely.Stanley E. Hilton, Brazil and the Soviet Challenge 1917-1947. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1991, , pages 81/86. The plea, however, was speedily quashed, the rapporteur-justice alleging that habeas corpus was superseded by martial lawPaulo Fernando Silveira, O morro das sete voltas: guerrilha na serra da Saudade. Curitiba: Juru\u00e1, 2008, ,page 100 and that Olga's deportation was justified as \"an alien noxious to public order\".Em\u00edlia Viotti da Costa, O Supremo Tribunal Federal e a constru\u00e7\u00e3o da cidadania.S\u00e3o Paulo: UNESP, 2006, page 90 After the Brazilian supreme court's decision, and despite an international campaign, Olga was forcibly returned to Germany in September 1936. The captain of the German liner that took her cancelled scheduled stops in non-German European ports, foiling communist attempts at rescuing her.Nigel West, MASK, page 24. On arrival, she was put in prison in Berlin, where on November 27 she gave birth to a daughter, Anita Leoc\u00e1dia. At the age of fourteen months, the child was released into the care of her paternal grandmother, Leoc\u00e1dia Prestes. After the birth of her child, Olga was sent to Lichtenburg concentration camp in 1938, transferred to Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp in 1939, and finally to Bernburg Euthanasia Centre in 1942, where she was gassed alongside hundreds of other female political prisoners. ==Aftermath== As Vargas joined the United Nations and Brazil entered World War II against the Axis, Lu\u00eds Carlos Prestes, the father of Anita Leoc\u00e1dia and former partner of Olga Ben\u00e1rio, eventually struck a political partnership with him in order to avoid Vargas' immediate ousting in 1945, which was demanded both by his more rightist domestic opponents and by Adolf Berle as US ambassador.David Rock, ed., Latin America in the 1940s: War and Postwar Transitions. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994, , pages 152 and 157 This move was in line with Popular Front Communist policies of the time:According to the explanation offered by Prestes in a later broadcast interview: Paulo Markun, O melhor do Roda viva: Poder. S\u00e3o Paulo: Conex, 2005, ,pages 52/53 Prestes argued that, by declaring himself against Vargas' immediate resignation, he wanted to avoid a \"redemptory coup\" as well as to take a stand against \"the decrepit remains of reaction\".David Rock,Latin America in the 1940s\" ,152 ==Legacy== Olga Ben\u00e1rio Prestes Jorge Amado, in his 1942 biographical novel \"Vida de Luis Carlos Prestes\", compared Olga Benario with Ana Ribeiro da Silva, the Brazilian wife of Garibaldi - and remarked that \"in the person of Olga, Europe repaid the debt to Latin America\" (i.e., in her case it was a European woman revolutionary who married a Latin American revolutionary leader). In the postwar German Democratic Republic, Olga was presented as the model of the female revolutionary, and the writer Anna Seghers wrote a biographical sketch about her for International Women's Day in 1951.Wiebke von Bernstorff, Fluchtorte: die mexikanischen und karibischen Erz\u00e4hlungen von Anna Seghers. G\u00f6ttingen, Wallsten Verlag, 2006, page 55. However, for Seghers Olga was also a character that joined \"ideal German qualities with the exotic Latin American aura - a dreamy synthesis between two worlds that charmed Seghers\" (Friedrich Albrecht, Bem\u00fchungen: Arbeiten zum Werk von Anna Seghers 1965-2004. Bern: Peter Lang, 2005, , page 430 Olga Ben\u00e1rio was the subject of an opera Entre la Piel y el Alma by G. P. Cribari, which premiered in Glasgow at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama on May 22, 1992. In the GDR Ruth Werner published a successful biographical novel for young readers about Olga Benario in 1961.Ruth Werner. Olga Benario. Die Geschichte eines tapferen Lebens. Berlin: Verlag neues Leben. 1961 In 2004, a popular Brazilian film based on Ben\u00e1rio's life, Olga, directed by telenovela director Jayme Monjardim, which offered a thoroughly depoliticized account of Olga's life, centered on her love affair with Prestes, was released, to the disappointment of German critics, who called it \"kitsch advertising\". Also in 2004 she was the subject of a German documentary (with reconstructed scenes) directed by the former assistant to Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Galip Iyitanir, Olga Ben\u00e1rio - Ein Leben f\u00fcr die Revolution. In 2006, the opera Olga, by Jorge Antunes, premiered on October 14 at the Theatro Municipal in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. In 2009 Olga Benario was one of three female protagonists in Swiss writer Robert Cohen's vast novel about the anti-fascist exile Exil der frechen Frauen.Robert Cohen. Exil der frechen Frauen. Berlin: Rotbuch Verlag. 2009 In January 2013, the English translation of the play Olga's Room by German playwright Dea Loher, was presented by the Speaking in Tongues Theatre Company at the Arcola Theatre in London.
