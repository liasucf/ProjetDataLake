    "text": "\"Do Your Thing\" is a song by English electronic music duo Basement Jaxx. It originally appeared on their second studio album Rooty (2001) and was released in August 2002 as a 12\" Limited Edition, vinyl single in UK and as a CD single in Australia. It was released again, as a 12\" vinyl single, in November 2005 by record label XL, when it reached number 32 in the UK Singles Chart. The lead vocals are sung by Elliot May. ==Composition and video== The song sampled the track \"Fungii Mama\" from Kenny Barron's album Lemuria-Seascape (1991). The song's music video was directed by Kim Gehrig, as her directorial debut, and features people in a park wearing t-shirts which mirror the song lyrics. ==Critical response== The song is featured on the 2011 experimental live album Basement Jaxx vs. Metropole Orkest. Reviewing the album for The Independent, Andy Gill said: \"'Do Your Thing' is very New York in flavour, a big-band jazz groove led by piano, the audience clapping along with the rattling percussion as brash trombones and sinuous saxophone take brief solos before the strings whip the piece to its conclusion.\" == References == Category:Basement Jaxx songs Category:2001 songs Category:XL Recordings singles Category:Songs written by Felix Buxton Category:Songs written by Simon Ratcliffe (musician) ",
