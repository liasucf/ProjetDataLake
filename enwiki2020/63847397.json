    "text": "The Hunziker Winery Site is the site of a former winery in Cedar Glen State Natural Area near Warsaw, Illinois. The winery was established in the 1860s by vintner and Swiss immigrant Gottlieb Hunziker and his business partner William Hoffman. At the time, Hancock County was becoming a major winemaking region, and the Warsaw area was second only to Nauvoo as a wine center within the county. Hunziker's wine was well-regarded among his contemporaries, as he won multiple awards at the 1870 Iowa State Fair, held across the Mississippi River in Keokuk. Hunziker continued to produce wine until his death in 1893. The remains of the winery include the walls of its wine house, in which grapes were processed and fermented, and an underground wine cellar. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 18, 2019. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hancock County, Illinois Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Wineries in Illinois ",
