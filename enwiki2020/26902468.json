His first VFL game was against Melbourne and he kicked 3 goals. Vin won the Best & Fairest for St Kilda Reserves in 1954. \u2018The Argus\u2019 newspaper described Vin as a \u2018nuggety rover\u2019 and in another match report referred to his \u2018hard work\u2019 around the packs. Vin played a total of 6 VFL matches and kicked 9 goals. Returning for the 1955 VFL season he played only one match, ending his VFL career at the age of 20. His last match for St Kilda was against South Melbourne in 1955 In June 1955 Vin crossed to Camberwell in the Victorian Football Association (VFA). ==Professional Running Career== While Vin made his mark in VFL and VFA football, he was also regarded as an outstanding professional runner and, in later years, a running coach. Sabbatucci took to professional running in 1950's in an effort to increase his speed for football. Sabbatucci first \u2018made the news\u2019 in pro-running in December 1956 when he won the Talbot Gift (off 8 yards) in 12.3 seconds. He also won the Talbot Sprint (75 yards) on that day.
