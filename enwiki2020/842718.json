    "text": "The term normal closure is used in two senses in mathematics: * In group theory, the normal closure of a subset of a group is the smallest normal subgroup that contains the subset; see conjugate closure. * In field theory, the normal closure of an algebraic extension F/K is an extension field L of F such that L/K is normal and L is minimal with this property. See normal extension. ",
