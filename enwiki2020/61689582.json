The album features the return of Dingir and Lugal Ki En guitarist Joel Omans According to figures provided by MetalInsider, the album sold 4,850 units in its first week. Artwork for the album was provided by Mark Cooper, who had worked with the band on their prior three albums. ==Background and promotion== On May 29, 2018, Rings Of Saturn announced the departure of guitarist Miles Dimitri Baker and drummer Aaron Stechauner, who both joined in 2014 prior to the release of Ultu Ulla. They announced the return of guitarist Joel Omans, who had played guitar for the band on Dingir and Lugal Ki En, along with Yo Onityan, formerly of DeGrace. The band also announced that Mike Caputo of Desecrate the Faith would be joining the band to play drums for their upcoming dates on Ragefest. They went on to state that their upcoming release would get back to the band's roots, and that the album would feature guest segments and instrumentals by Charles Caswell of Berried Alive, Yo Onityan, Marco Pitruzzella, and vocalist Dan Watson, of Enterprise Earth and Infant Annihilator. Baker and Stechauner would post statements of their own, citing lack of credit in song writing for Ultu Ulla as their primary reason for departing the band. Nuclear Blast announced the album on August 30, 2019, alongside the album's first promotional single \"The Husk\", for which a music video was directed by Scott Hansen of Digital Thunderdome. Five days later, 'We Are the End', a band Mann and Baker had previously worked with, accused Mann of stealing their guitarist's riffs for the song. A second promotional single, \"Mental Prolapse\", was released on September 20 of the same year. To promote the album, the band embarked on The Gidim Release Tour 2019 with support from Enterprise Earth, Angelmaker, and Brand of Sacrifice on October 16. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Rings of Saturn * Ian Bearer \u2013 vocals, lyrics * Lucas Mann \u2013 guitars, bass, synth, primary composition, arrangement * Joel Omans \u2013 composition and guitars * Marco Pitruzella (Lord Marco) \u2013 drums Guest musicians * Dan Watson \u2013 additional vocals (track 3) * Charles Caswell \u2013 guitar solo (track 1) * Yo Onityan \u2013 guitar solo (track 5) Production * Mark Lewis of Audiohammer Studios: Mixing, mastering, and Vocal Tracking * Lucas Mann of Mann Studios: Guitar, Bass, and Synth Tracking * Marco Pitruzzella (Lord Marco): Drum tracking Album Art and Layout * Mark Cooper ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Nuclear Blast albums Category:Rings of Saturn (band) albums ",
