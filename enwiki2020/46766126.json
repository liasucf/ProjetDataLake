    "text": "\"'\" (; ) is a French expression attributed to King Louis XV of France, or in the form \"'\" (; ) to Madame de Pompadour, his favourite.; . It is generally regarded as a nihilistic expression of indifference to whatever happens after one is gone,; though it may also express a more literal forecasting of ruination. Its meaning is transcribed by Brewer in the forms \"When I am dead the deluge may come for aught I care\", and \"Ruin, if you like, when we are dead and gone.\" The saying is believed to date from after the Battle of Rossbach in 1757, which was disastrous for the French. == Usage == Karl Marx wrote in Das Kapital (Vol. 1, Part III, Chapter Ten, Section 5) \"Apr\u00e8s moi, le d\u00e9luge! is the watchword of every capitalist and of every capitalist nation. Hence Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the labourer, unless under compulsion from society.\"Das Kapital, Chapter 10 During the trial of Dimitri Fyodorovich Karamazov in The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoyevsky, the prosecution uses the phrase to describe the defendant\u2019s reprobate father and to lament the deterioration of Russian values more generally. In his writings of the 1920s, D. H. Lawrence uses the expression a number of times, calling it \"the tacit utterance of every man\", in his \"crisis\" of unbearable \"loneliness ... surrounded by nullity\".\"The Crown\", IV (1925) in Reflections on the Death of a Porcupine and Other Essays (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), p280. But \"you mustn't expect it to wait for your convenience,\" he warns the dissolute \"younger generation\";\"Latter-Day sinners\" from Pansies (1928) in Poems, Volume 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), p461. \"the real deluge lies just ahead of us\".\"The Memoires of Duc de Lauzun\", Version 1 (1926) in Introductions and Reviews (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), p91. Lawrence also uses the phrase in \"Whitman\" (1923), calling it \"the soul's last shout and shriek, on the confines of death\", Studies in Classic American Literature (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), p155. \"Apr\u00e8s moi le d\u00e9luge\" was adopted as the motto of the Royal Air Force 617 Squadron, which carried out the \"Dambuster\" raids on German dams in the Ruhr region on the night of 16\u201317 May 1943. == See also == * Flood myth * Let them eat cake == References == == Sources == * * * * * Category:18th century in France Category:Catchphrases Category:French words and phrases Category:Nihilism Category:Words and phrases introduced in the 18th century ",
