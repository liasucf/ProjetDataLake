A call to action was published simultaneously by the WHO on 24 April. On September 10, the UN and European Union co-hosted the Inaugural Meeting of the Facilitation Council of the ACT-Accelerator, which so far has received $2.7 billion of the $35 billion necessary to secure the 2 billion vaccine doses, 245 million treatments and 500 million tests that the initiative deems is necessary to shorten the pandemic and speed economic global recovery. The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) is one of the three pillars (diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines) of the ACT-Accelerator. Sir Andrew Witty and Dr Ngozi Okonjo- Iweala have accepted to act as Special Envoys to the ACT Accelerator from the WHO. ==References== Category:COVID-19 Category:Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:World Health Organization Category:G20 ",
