    "text": ", often shortened to simply Budokan, is an indoor arena located in Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. Budokan was originally built for the judo competition in the 1964 Summer Olympics, hence its name, which translates in English as Martial Arts Hall. Its primary purpose is to host martial arts contests and for a time was a popular venue for Japanese professional wrestling. It has hosted numerous other sporting events such as the 1967 Women's Volleyball World Championship and other events such as musical concerts. A number of famous rock music acts have played at Budokan. The Beatles were the first rock group to play there, in a series of concerts held between June 30 and July 2, 1966. Another big act to enter the stage at Budokan were ABBA. They ended their last tour there, ABBA: The Tour. Their final show, on March 27, 1980, also came to be the last live concert they did together. Several live albums were recorded at Budokan, including releases by Bryan Adams, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Cheap Trick, Dream Theater, John Hiatt, Kiss, Mr. Big, Ozzy Osbourne, Judas Priest, Journey and Deep Purple. ==Location== The Nippon Budokan is located in Kitanomaru Park in the center of Tokyo, two minutes' walking distance from Kudanshita Subway Station, and near the Imperial Palace and Yasukuni Shrine. The 42 m (140 ft) high octagonal structure holds 14,471 people (arena seats: 2,946, 1st floor seats: 3,199, 2nd floor seats: 7,846, standee: 480). The building is modeled after Yumedono (Hall of Dreams) in H\u014dry\u016b-ji in Nara. ==Venue history== ===Martial arts=== The 57th Japan National Kendo Championship (November 3, 2009) All-Japan Tournament Karate The Nippon Budokan during the cherry blossom season Although it also functions as a venue for big musical events, its primary purpose is for Japanese martial arts. The national championships of the different branches of the martial arts (judo, kendo, karate, aikido, etc.) are held annually at the Budokan. The Budokan has also been associated with professional wrestling's big shows, typically from All Japan Pro Wrestling and Pro Wrestling Noah. However, due to declining business following the death of Mitsuharu Misawa and the retirement of Kenta Kobashi, professional wrestling has ceased running regular shows in the Budokan. During Wrestle Kingdom 12, New Japan Pro Wrestling announced that its yearly G1 Climax tournament's finals would be held at the Budokan. The Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki hybrid rules fight held at the Budokan in 1976 is seen as a forerunner to mixed martial arts. K-1, Shooto and Pride Fighting Championships have all held events at the arena. ===Music=== A concert stage at Budokan The Beatles were the first rock group to perform at Budokan in a series of five shows held between June 30 and July 2, 1966. Their appearances were met with opposition from those who felt the appearance of a western pop group would defile the martial arts arena. In July 1973 Japanese television recorded the Santana performance at Budokan. The Budokan gained worldwide fame when American artists Cheap Trick and Bob Dylan used the arena to record their performances, Cheap Trick at Budokan (1978) and Bob Dylan at Budokan (1979). The venue is popular for recording live albums because it has good acoustics, is relatively large and Japanese audiences are known for being highly appreciative when appropriate but quiet during performanceshttps://www.ajournalofmusicalthings.com/history-question-why-were- so-many-live-albums-recorded-at-japans-budokan-theatre/. Eric Clapton described the Tokyo audience as \"almost overappreciative\" in interviews promoting Just One Night (1980), his own live album recorded at the Budokan.
