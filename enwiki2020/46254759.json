The film released in India on 26 June 2015. The film also faced criticisms of plagiarism for its noticeable similarities with the 2013 Iranian short film Zan Va Shohar Karegar (The adventures of Married Couple) by Keywan Karimi. The story as well many shots have striking resemblance to Zan Va Shohar Karegar.Sengupta, however, claimed that in a private communication between Sengupta and Karimi, director of the short film, Karimi has said both are different films. ==Plot== The woman (Basabdatta Chatterjee) works in a handbag factory while the man (Ritwick Chakraborty) works the night shift at a printing press. The film follows that young married couple as they go about their day, how they stay apart all day long except one brief moment when they get to be with each other. The entire movie has no dialogues. It has background music and some classic old songs thrown in for a soothing effect. ==Cast== * Ritwick Chakraborty as the Man * Basabdatta Chatterjee as the Woman ==Awards== 62nd National Film Awards (India)Chatterjee, Suprateek. \"'Queen', 'Haider', And 'Court' Amongst Winners At 62nd National Film Awards\" Published 24 March 2015.
