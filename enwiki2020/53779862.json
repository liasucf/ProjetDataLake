    "text": "The First Baptist Church is a Baptist church and a historic landmark. The First Baptist Church is located on South Perry Street, in downtown Montgomery, Alabama. Founded in 1829, it had a mixed congregation (consisting of enslaved and free blacks as well as whites) until 1867 when most African-American members (themselves often the slaves of the white congregationists) branched off to found their own church, initially called \"First Baptist Church, colored\" a few blocks away on Ripley Street. ==History== The church was founded in 1829 by Lee Compere, who had been sent out to do missionary work among the Creek Indians in Tallassee, east of Montgomery. The current building was constructed between 1905 and 1923 and is based on the Florence Cathedral. In April 1965- by now an all-white church, in light of the ongoing struggle for civil rights, the pastor, J.R. White, and the church's deacons proposed an 'open door policy' to the First Baptist Church congregation. Although originally rejected, the proposal was subsequently accepted, and has been described as one of the first 'cracks in the segregated church.'. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Baptist churches in Alabama Category:Churches in Montgomery, Alabama Category:1829 establishments in Alabama Category:Southern Baptist Convention churches ",
