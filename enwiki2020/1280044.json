    "text": "Seismograph recording of harmonic tremor. Four major types of seismograms, or seismic signatures. A harmonic tremor is a sustained release of seismic and infrasonic energy typically associated with the underground movement of magma, the venting of volcanic gases from magma, or both. It is a long-duration release of seismic energy, with distinct spectral lines, that often precedes or accompanies a volcanic eruption. More generally, a volcanic tremor is a sustained signal that may or may not possess these harmonic spectral features. Being a long-duration continuous signal from a temporally extended source, a volcanic tremor contrasts distinctly with transient sources of seismic radiation, such as tremors that are typically associated with earthquakes and explosions. The relation between long-period events and an imminent eruption was first observed by Bernard Chouet, a volcanologist who was working at the United States Geological Survey.Interview with Bernard Chouet regarding his research into long-period events and volcanic eruptions: http://www.esi- topics.com/volcanoes/interviews/BernardChouet.html .U.S. TV program on use of long-period events to predict volcanic eruptions: \"Nova: Volcano's Deadly Warning\": https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/volcano/ .
