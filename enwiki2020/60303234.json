The 2018 Volkswagen Jetta debuted at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, on 14 January 2018, after Volkswagen released an exterior design sketch in December 2017. The Jetta is based on Volkswagen's MQB platform, which underpins other Volkswagen vehicles including the Volkswagen Golf and the Volkswagen Atlas. == Overview == === North America === Volkswagen Jetta A7 (United States)The Mk7 is larger than its predecessor, offers more interior room and has the latest generation of Volkswagen's infotainment systems, including integration of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Its ten- color customizable ambient interior lighting includes lighting across the dashboard and instrument panel, front and rear doors, foot wells, and the gauge \"rings\" of a newly available fully digital instrument cluster display, marketed as the \"Digital Cockpit\". Reflector LED headlamps and LED rear tail lamps are standard equipment, and a panoramic sunroof is also available. Heated and ventilated front seats are available as well, as leather-trimmed seating surfaces become available for the first time since the Mk. V Jetta. In addition, Volkswagen is the second automaker in the U.S. to offer a premium Beats Audio audio system. The Jetta's 1.8 L turbocharged TSI inline four- cylinder (I4) gasoline engine has been discontinued, as the outgoing 1.4 L turbocharged TSI inline four-cylinder (I4) is the only engine option on the Jetta. Only the base S trim is offered with a six-speed manual transmission or an eight-speed automatic transmission, while all other trims offer only an eight-speed automatic transmission. On higher trim levels, the Jetta also offers seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, and Volkswagen Driving Mode Selection. There is also Cross Differential System (XDS), but it is only available on the Jetta R Line. Safety features on the Jetta include an Intelligent Crash Response System (ICRS), and a standard safety cage. An automatic post-collision braking system, a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), as well as seven safety and stability-enhancing systems all come as standard equipment. Trim levels of the all-new Jetta in the U.S. are S, SE, R-Line, SEL, and SEL Premium. Trim levels in Canada are Comfortline, Highline and Execline. All trim levels lost the multi-link rear independent suspension for a less expensive torsion-beam rear suspension. As with its predecessors, production of the all-new 2019 Jetta will continue at Volkswagen's Puebla assembly plant in Mexico. The all-new Jetta reached Volkswagen dealerships in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2018. This new seventh generation Jetta will not be sold in the European market. ==== Powertrain ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:90%;\" !Model !Displacement !Series !Power !Torque !Transmission !Note |- | colspan=\"7\" |Petrol engines |- |1.4 TSI |1,395 cc I4 |EA211 | | |6-speed manual or 8-speed automatic | |- |1.6 MSI |1,598 cc I4 | | | |6-speed automatic |Only available in Mexico |- |2.0 TSI (GLI) |1,984 cc I4 |EA888 | | |6-speed manual or 7-speed DSG | |} === Volkswagen Sagitar (China) === The Chinese-spec Volkswagen Sagitar long wheelbase was launched on 19 January 2019 both in Beijing and Shanghai. it is about 50 mm longer than the U.S.-spec model, and is equipped with independent suspension.
