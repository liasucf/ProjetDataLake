    "text": "Jonathan Charles Billing Pockerage Seaver (born 7 June 1855, date of death unknown) was an Irish-born Australian politician. He was born at Kingstown near Dublin, and arrived in Victoria around 1857. At sixteen he became a tutor and after an abortive attempt at a church career worked as an engineer and surveyor. He travelled widely, spending some time in Adelaide before settling in Gloucester. In 1887 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Free Trade member for Gloucester. He held the seat until 1891, when he was defeated running for St Leonards. Little is known about his subsequent life, but he is believed to have died in Mexico. ==References== Category:1855 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Free Trade Party politicians ",
