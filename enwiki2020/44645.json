    "text": "Michif (also Mitchif, Mechif, Michif-Cree, M\u00e9tif, M\u00e9tchif, French Cree) is the language of the M\u00e9tis people of Canada and the United States, who are the descendants of First Nations women (mainly Cree, Nakota and Ojibwe) and fur trade workers of European ancestry (mainly French and Scottish Canadians). Michif emerged in the early 19th century as a mixed language (not to be confused with a creole) and adopted a consistent character between about 1820 and 1840. The number of speakers is estimated at fewer than 1,000; it was probably double or triple this number at the close of the 19th century, but never much higher. Currently, Michif is spoken in scattered M\u00e9tis communities in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba in Canada and in North Dakota in the U.S., with about 50 speakers in Alberta, all over age 60. There are some 230 speakers of Michif in the United States (down from 390 at the 1990 census),Michif | Ethnologue most of whom live in North Dakota, particularly in the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. There are around 300 Michif speakers in the Northwest Territories, northern Canada.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/michif-metis-nwt-official- language-1.3475320 Michif combines Cree and M\u00e9tis French (Rhodes 1977, Bakker 1997:85), a variety of Canadian French, with some additional borrowing from English and indigenous languages of the Americas such as Ojibwe and Assiniboine. In general, Michif noun phrase phonology, lexicon, morphology and syntax are derived from M\u00e9tis French, while verb phrase phonology, lexicon, morphology and syntax are from a southern variety of Plains Cree. (Plains Cree is a western dialect of Cree.) Articles and adjectives are also of M\u00e9tis French origin but demonstratives are from Plains Cree. The Michif language is unusual (and possibly even unique) among mixed languages, in that rather than forming a simplified grammar, it developed by incorporating complex elements of the chief languages from which it was born. French-origin noun phrases retain lexical gender and adjective agreement; Cree-origin verbs retain much of their polysynthetic structure. This suggests that instead of haltingly using words from another's tongue, the people who gradually came to speak Michif were fully fluent in both French and Cree. The Michif language was first brought to scholarly attention in 1976 by John Crawford at the University of North Dakota.Michif: A new language. North Dakota English 4.1:3-10. Much of the subsequent research on Michif was also related to UND, including four more pieces by Crawford, plus work by Evans, Rhodes and Weaver. Michif is also used by some M\u00e9tis as their nationality, preferring this to being called M\u00e9tis. ==Phonology== Michif as recorded starting in the 1970s combined two separate phonological systems: one for French origin elements, and one for Cree origin elements (Rhodes 1977, 1986). For instance, /y/, /l/, /r/ and /f/ exist only in French words, whereas preaspirated stops such as and exist only in Cree words. In this variety of Michif, the French elements were pronounced in ways that have distinctively Canadian French values for the vowels, while the Cree elements have distinctively Cree values for vowels. Nonetheless, there is some Cree influence on French words in the stress system (Rosen 2006). But by the year 2000 there were Michif speakers who had collapsed the two systems into a single system (Rosen 2007). ===Consonants=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Consonants in Manitoba MichifRosen 2007:109 ! !!

Examples of this process are listed in the table below. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |- |+/e/-deletion in MichifBarkwell & Fleury 2004:11 |-align=center !French !! Michif !! English |- | chemin || shmen || 'path' |- | cheveux || zhveu || 'hair' |- | petit || pchi || 'small' |- | cheval || zhwal || 'horse' |} Elision in Michf Rosen (2007) states that since all French-derived vowel-initial nouns in Michif have been lexicalized as consonant-initial, the French rule of elision, which deletes certain vowels (particularly schwa) before vowel-initial words, for ex., le copain \u2018the friend\u2019 but l\u2019ami \u2018the friend\u2019), cannot apply in Michif. Curiously, she admits that Elision is potentially still active since vowel- initial English loanwords allow elision, as in un bol d\u2019oatmeal \u2018a bowl of oatmeal\u2019. Papen (2014) has countered that elision is, in fact, just as active in French-derived words as is liaison. For example, he examines Noun + di + Noun constructions ( as in mwaa di zhanvjii vs mwaa d\u2019oktob \u2018month of January vs month of October) and finds that 100% of /i/ (from French schwa) are deleted before French-derived vowel-initial nouns. However, elision does not occur before Cree vowel-initial nouns. This strongly suggests that French phonolgical rules, such as liaison and elision still function in Michif, but that they apply only to French-derived words and not to Cree-derived ones, implying that Michif phonology is at least partially stratified, contrary to what Rosen (2007) proposes. ===Liaison consonants=== In French, a liaison is used to bridge the gap between word-final and word-initial vowel sounds. Whether liaison still exists in Michif is a much discussed theoretical issue. Scholars such as Bakker (1997)Bakker, P. 1997. A Language of our own. The genesis of Michif, the mixed Cree-French language of the Canadian M\u00e9tis. Oxford, Oxford University Press. , Rhodes (1986) Rhodes, R. 1986. M\u00e9tchif: A second look. In Actes du Dix-septi\u00e8me Congr\u00e8s des Algonquinistes, ed. W. Cowan, Ottawa, Carleton University Press, p. 287-296., and Rosen (2007)Rosen, N. 2007. Domains in Michif phonology. PhD thesis, University of Toronto. have suggested that liaison no longer exists in Michif and that all words that etymologically began with a vowel in French now begin with a consonant, the latter resulting from a variety of sources, including a liaison consonant. Their arguments are based on the fact that the expected liaison consonant (for example, /n/) will not show up and instead, the consonant will be /z/, as in in zur 'a bear' The above authors cite over a dozen words with an unexpected initial consonant. Papen (2003, 2014)Papen, R. 2003. 'Michif: One phonology or two?', in Y. Chung, C. Gillon, and Wodjak (eds) Proceedings of the Eight Workshop on the Structure and Constituency in Languages of the Amnericas, University of British Columbia Working Papers in Linguistics 12, p.47-58; Papen, R. 2014. 'La liaison en mitchif : un cas d\u2019acquisition incompl\u00e8te fossilis\u00e9e?' in C. Soum-Favaro, A. Coquillon and J.-P. Chevrot (eds.), Liaison : Approches contemporaines. Berlin, Peter Lang, p. 213-238. has countered this argument by showing that, statistically, the vast majority of so-called initial consonants in Michif reflect the expected liaison consonant and that only about 13% of so-called initial consonants are unexpected. Moreover, Papen points out that one of the so-called initial consonant is /l/, which in nearly all cases, represents the elided definite article l (from li), in which case it cannot be a liaison consonant, since liaison consonants may not have grammatical or semantic meaning. Thus in a sequence such as larb the meaning is not simply 'tree' but 'the tree', where initial l has the meaning of 'the', and /l/ is initial only in a phonetic sense, but not in a phonological one, since it represents a distinct morpheme from 'arb', and thus arb must be considered as phonologically vowel-initial. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |- |+Liaison consonants in Michif |-align=center !French !!

Prenominal adjectives agree in gender (like French), however, postnominal adjectives do not agree in gender (unlike French). ===Verb phrase=== The verb phrase is that of Plains Cree- origin with little reduction (there are no dubitative or preterit verb forms). ===Word order=== Michif word order is basically that of Cree (relatively free). However, the more French-origin elements are used, the closer the syntax seems to conform to norms of spoken French. ==Lexicon== Nouns: 83-94% French-origin; others are mostly Cree-origin, Ojibwe-origin, or English-origin Verbs: 88-99% Cree-origin Question words: Cree-origin Personal pronouns: Cree Postpositions: Cree-origin Prepositions: French-origin Conjunctions: 55% Cree-origin; 40% French-origin Numerals: French-origin Demonstratives: Cree-origin The Lord's Prayer in English, French, and Michif: {| class=\"wikitable\" !

A Language of Our Own: The Genesis of Michif, the Mixed Cree-French Language of the Canadian Metis, Oxford University Press, 1997. The reasons are as follows: children tend to know their mother\u2019s language better; in the case of the M\u00e9tis, the men were often immigrants, whereas the women were native to the region. If the bilingual children need to use either of their parents\u2019 languages to converse with outsiders, it is most likely to be the language of their mothers. Thus, the model of language-mixing predicts that Michif should have a Cree grammatical system and French lexicon. Michif, however, has Cree verb phrases and French noun phrases. The explanation for this unusual distribution of Cree and French elements in Michif lies in the polysynthetic nature of Cree morphology. In Cree, verbs can be very complex with up to twenty morphemes, incorporated nouns and unclear boundaries between morphemes. In other words, in Cree verbs it is very difficult to separate grammar from lexicon. As a result, in Michif the grammatical and bound elements are almost all Cree, and the lexical and free elements are almost all French; verbs are almost totally Cree, because the verb consists of grammatical and bound elements. Seen in this way, it can be argued that Michif is fundamentally Cree, but with heavy French borrowing (somewhat like Maltese, a mixed Arabic-Italian language classified as fundamentally Arabic). == Language revitalization == M\u00e9tis cultural centres such as the Michif Cultural and M\u00e9tis Resource Institute in St. Albert, Alberta, the M\u00e9tis Culture and Heritage Resource Centre in Winnipeg,MCHRC Profile and the Gabriel Dumont Institute of Native Studies and Applied Research are attempting to revive the language through public outreach. As of 2013, the Northern Journal reports that \"Aboriginal language and culture is becoming increasingly visible\" in Alberta, as Alberta's Northland School Division, \"serving mostly First Nations and M\u00e9tis students in the northern part of the province\" has expanded its community partnerships and culture camps. ==See also== *Bungi Creole *Chinook Jargon *Journal of Indigenous Studies *Lists of extinct languages *Lists of endangered languages *Lists of languages ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * Barkwell, Lawrence J., Leah Dorion, and Audreen Hourie.
