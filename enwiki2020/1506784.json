He is the only player to have won the Canadian Men's Curling Championship (known as the Brier) at three different positions: skip (1998), third (2012), and second (1993). He will be inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in 2020.https://www.curling.ca/blog/2020/02/10/into-the-hall/ ==Career== Middaugh is a three-time world champion, once as second for Russ Howard in 1993, as a skip in 1998, and as third for Glenn Howard in 2012. He has competed in nine Briers \u2014 in 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994 as Russ Howard's second, in 1998, 2001 and 2005 as a skip and in 2012 and 2013 as third on the Glenn Howard rink \u2014 winning the title in 1993, 1998 and 2012. On top of this, Middaugh has won seven TSN Skins Games, was the World Curling Tour Money leader for three seasons and has won four World Curling Tour Players Championships. In March 2007, Jon Mead was announced as the Middaugh team's replacement for Wayne's cousin Peter Corner at the third position. He left the team in April 2010 to rejoin with his former skip Jeff Stoughton. Following the retirement of Richard Hart from the Glenn Howard rink, Howard announced that Middaugh would replace Hart as his third. Middaugh would have immediate success with his new team, qualifying for the 2012 Tim Hortons Brier where the rink lost only one game during the event, and defeated Alberta's Kevin Koe in the final. Middaugh became the first curler to win the Brier at three different positions. In addition to the 2012 title, Middaugh was the winner of the annual Ford Hot Shots skills and shot-making competition that precedes the start of round- robin play. Middaugh left the Howard rink in 2014, and announced his retirement from competitive curling. However he returned in time to play in the Challenge Round to qualify for the 2015 Ontario Tankard, being added as skip to Peter Corner's rink. ==Personal life== He is a Project Manager for Urbacon Construction and also the Coach of Team Hasselborg and PGA of Canada golf pro. He is married to former Ontario women's champion Sherry Middaugh, and has two children.http://cloudfront7.curling.ca/2013roaroftherings- en/files/2013/12/2013ROTR_MorningRoar_Day6.pdf ==Career statistics== ===Grand Slam record=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
