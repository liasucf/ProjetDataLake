His advice: \"There are 20,000 guitar players in Downey alone. What makes you special from the guy next to you? Passion, determination is what sets you aside. Set goals, never go backwards. When you do, stop yourself and reevaluate. I frustrated the hell out of every band I was in. I wasn\u2019t going to flounder. Becoming content is the enemy of musicians. You\u2019ll never find your true voice if you don\u2019t challenge yourself.\" In 2009, the wedding of George Pajon and Naomi Medina took place in Mexico's Xcaret and was televised on WE Tv's Platinum Weddings.

It's really inspiring to me. We've been involved with the bus guys since 1999, and they've been really inspiring to us over the years,\" Pajon said. \"This was a welcome break for me. I could use a dose of inspiration, and it's been absolutely great to see young creative minds at work here.\" ==Discography== ===Solo releases=== In January 2004, Pajon released his first solo effort entitled Fried Plantains on Kulafa Recordings. \"The new debut release by guitarist George Pajon Jr., \u201cFried Plaintains,\u201d deserves a key spot among the great grooves on the funk-jazz shelf.\" \"George\u2019s musical dexterity comes through more than ever in his current solo project, Fried Plantains, which fuses the worlds of jazz, hip-hop, blues and rock.\" In 2007 Pajon released the album entitled The Band Behind The Front with Bucky Jonson on the BBE label.
