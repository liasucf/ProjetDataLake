    "text": "Peter H. Fisher (b. 1959) is an American experimental particle physicist, and the head of the Department of Physics of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. == Early life and education == Peter Fisher was born in 1959 in San Francisco, California. He earned a B.S. in engineering physics at the University of California, Berlkeley, in 1983, and a Ph.D. in nuclear physics at the California Institute of Technology in 1988. His dissertation, A search for double beta decay in 76Ge, was supervised by Felix H. Boehm. == Career == From 1989-1994, Fisher was on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University. He joined the M.I.T. faculty in 1989, and became a full professor in 2009. Fisher's research has included twelve years at CERN working on the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer for the International Space Station. His research interests also include the detection of dark matter, development of new particle detectors, compact energy supplies, and wireless energy transmission. He became chair of the M.I.T. Department of Physics in 2014. == Awards == Fisher became a Fellow of the American Physical Society, nominated by the Division of Particles and Fields in 2006, and cited for \"Intiating Tau Polarization Asymmetry Measurements and W-Boson self couplings, leading to a top mass prediction (found later at FNAL). First proof of single W-production in e+ e- annihilation. Determination of sin20w with proposal to expand to highest accuracy of 10-5 at LHC.\" == References == == External links == * Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:American physicists Category:California Institute of Technology alumni Category:Educators from California Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:Johns Hopkins University faculty Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni ",
