    "text": "The International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) consists of a joint effort to collect and disseminate databases containing DNA and RNA sequences. It involves the following computerized databases: DNA Data Bank of Japan (Japan), GenBank (USA) and the European Nucleotide Archive (UK). New and updated data on nucleotide sequences contributed by research teams to each of the three databases are synchronized on a daily basis through continuous interaction between the staff at each the collaborating organizations. The DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank synchronization is maintained according to a number of guidelines which are produced and published by an International Advisory Board. The guidelines consist of a common definition of the feature tables for the databases, which regulate the content and syntax of the database entries, in the form of a common DTD (Document Type Definition). The syntax is called INSDSeq and its core consists of the letter sequence of the gene expression (amino acid sequence) and the letter sequence for nucleotide bases in the gene or decoded segment. In a DBFetch operation shows a typical INSD entry at the EBI database; the same entry at NCBI. ==See also== * Bioinformatics * Biological database * DNA Data Bank of Japan * European Bioinformatics Institute * List of biological databases * National Center for Biotechnology Information * Sequence database ==External links== * Official site ==References== ==External links== * * EMBL INSDC site * EMBL Nucleotide Database * DNA Data Bank of Japan * GenBank Nucleotide Search Category:Bioinformatics organizations Category:Databases in the United Kingdom Category:Genetics in the United Kingdom Category:Molecular biology Category:Nucleic acids Category:South Cambridgeshire District ",
