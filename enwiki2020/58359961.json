    "text": "Ensio Kalevi Koivunen (June 23, 1930 \u2013 May 27, 2003) was a Finnish serial killerAlibi 6/1980, s. 10Rikostarinoita Suomesta \u2013 Liftarimurhat who poisoned three female hitchhikers using carbon monoxide in the summer of 1971, and thereby got the nickname H\u00e4k\u00e4-Enska (\"Carbon monoxide-Enska\").Markkula, Hannes, 1991: Suomalainen murha 1953\u20131990 () == The missing girls == On July 11, 1971, 23-year-old Salme Helena Mets\u00e4nikula (born January 28, 1948) disembarked a bus in Anjala en route from Helsinki to Turku. She was last seen in Koria before she vanished. A friend began worrying about Mets\u00e4nikula when she failed to return to university. Her father traveled to Turku to look for her, but when no trace of her was found, she was declared missing. On August 17, 17-year-old Ritva Anneli Raijas (born November 27, 1953) and 16-year-old Pirjo Marjatta Laiho (born July 20, 1954) left Pit\u00e4j\u00e4nm\u00e4ki to visit an aunt in Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4. When they did not arrive a few days later, they were also declared as missing. Their last known location was at the H\u00e4meenlinna bridge near Keimola on August 14. A 28-year-old Helsinki auto mechanic was seen taking the girls from the bridge. His actions were reported during the 1971 European Athletics Championships in Helsinki, as having picked up the girls near an Esso station on the crossroad between Kaarela and Nurmij\u00e4rvi. The man reportedly had met the girls at 21:51 and had been seen with them at the Esso station until 22:00, when he left without them. Other motorists had seen the girls later on between Helsinki and H\u00e4meenlinna. According to these accounts, they had been seen in a red Citro\u00ebn 2CV.. == Discovery of the bodies == On August 18, a Helsinki family picking mushrooms in forest in Ing\u00e5 stumbled upon a body wrapped up in plastic wrap and covered with moss and lark. Next to it were neatly fitted eyeglasses and patent leather shoes. The police later notified the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), which started exploring the forest and the surrounding environment. It was determined that the cause of death was unnatural. Later, the victim's identity was confirmed as Mets\u00e4nikula. Her camera, three rings and belt were missing. Mets\u00e4nikula's body was found near a labor camp in Ing\u00e5, where criminals were placed to work for the last stages of their sentences before release. The police screened the prisoners' fingerprints in case the killer was there. On August 20, police were called in to inspect lost goods at Seutula's old airport. They found a young woman's personal belongings, including a Kela card and an audio recorder. The goods were found to belong to Raijas and Laiho. The following day, a group of young men found the bodies of the remaining two girls covered with plastic wrap in Ridasj\u00e4rvi village. == Investigation and capture == The plastic was important evidence since it had a serial number that was assumed to belong to the Citro\u00ebn the girls were last seen riding in. Since the plastic was made in Sweden, five Swedish companies were contacted about the matter. However, it was eventually determined that the plastic had probably come through Finland with some electrical equipment and was not linked to any Swedish-registered automobile. The victims' shoes were tied neatly in lines, and at the time of the autopsy were in a smiling position. Ethanol was later found in their blood, and both had been sexually assaulted. The cause of death was determined as carbon monoxide poisoning. The NBI combined the investigation of the cases, as the girls' killings were very similar and close in proximity. All the victims had been abducted and their goods found in the Southern Finland Province. The NBI, for the first time in its history, received pictures of the victims, which were distributed from all around Southern Finland to filling stations and dance venues. On one of the photographs, there were fingerprints of a man who had been to the Ing\u00e5 labor camp. His car, a 1967 Dodge Dart, registration number BNL-99, was searched. According to anonymous tips, the Dodge had been seen several times at the locations of the abductions. On September 26, the police found and arrested the Dodge's owner, 41-year-old Ensio Kalevi Koivunen, in the town of Hanko. His car and his home were searched. Two illegal pistols, a woman's belt and a camera were found. == Interrogations == Koivunen repeatedly changed his story under questioning. He denied killing the girls or even meeting them. However, he had transported four women in the summer, denying they were the same girls. In one of the interviews, Koivunen admitted to having met Mets\u00e4nikula at the shore of Myllylampi, and that they talked about her studies and personal life over coffee. He also noted that Mets\u00e4nikula used a lot of medication. As they continued their journey, the girl suffered a respiratory attack, causing Koivunen to stop and flee from the car. After returning, he found Mets\u00e4nikula was lying dead in the car's back seat. He later hid the girl's body in the Ing\u00e5 forest. Similarly, Koivunen denied knowing anything about Laiho and Raijas, but changed his story and claimed to have met Laiho earlier and began a relationship with her. According to him, Laiho proposed a meeting and brought along Raijas, whereupon the three headed for Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4. While they drank at a nightclub, an unnamed younger man joined them and Raijas began vomiting. Koivunen claimed that the girls were murdered outside of his presence and that the unnamed man had admitted to battering them to death. Koivunen's wife was also interviewed, and told police that Koivunen came home on the night of August 15 and told her that he had shown two girls and a boy around the city. When he and his wife read the magazine about the disappearance of Laiho and Raijas, Koivunen noted that they looked the same as the girls he had been with. Koivunen's story soon changed again, removing the unnamed young man from his story. This time he claimed that the girls had fallen asleep on the back seat while he was driving. Upon awakening, Koivunen noticed that the engine was running, and tried to wake the girls, unsuccessfully. Shuddering, Koivunen wandered around hoping the girls would wake up, but they were dead. In fear, he remembered what had happened to Mets\u00e4nikula one month earlier. Koivunen feared to get sent back to jail and decided to get rid of the bodies. When the police asked how they had died, Koivunen told them that while they slept, someone had dug up the hose from the car's back and connected it through the exhaust pipe to the back of the car. However, the question arose of how Koivunen survived that. Koivunen never acknowledged his guilt and changed the details of the story many times, remaining consistent about a few details. According to his wife, they girls were scared, and had vomited and choked while in the car. When they heard that the police had found tire marks on the fringes, Koivunen's wife remembered her husband's strange and nervous behaviour on that night. During the investigation, a hair of Koivunen was found on Laiho and Raijas' bodies. The camera found at home was also identified as his, as well as fingerprints from a photo found in a back alley near his home. There were plenty of anonymous tips, some of which were significant. During a preliminary investigation, a girl told the police that she had hitchhiked from Helsinki to Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4. The driver was a 41-year-old male. At first everything seemed innocent until the man had decided to introduce the girl to the city. He had taken her, among other places, to the Taabor mountain, speaking about himself and his life on the way. When they got there, he did not let the girl out and threatened her, but she jumped out of the car and fled. After the incident, she had seen that same man near her house several times. When she was shown a picture of Koivunen, she immediately recognized him. == Trial == Koivunen was arrested for the murder of Mets\u00e4nikula, Raijas and Laiho. He was jailed in the Helsinki Prison before the trial in the Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 District Court, which got a lot of publicity. Koivunen was initially dissatisfied with his lawyer, and changed him before the trial. He tried to change his story and bring his own witnesses to the court, but nothing helped. The trial lasted six hours each day. Koivunen's criminal record was very long. He had been convicted of several property crimes, and from 1953 to 1968 he had been free only for a short time, and been incarcerated in a prison hospital eight times. He served a six year sentence in jail when he was involved in a car crash. All the crimes he had committed were done in Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 and Ing\u00e5, because they were located near the prison camp. Koivunen was ordered for a mental health examination. Koivunen was found to be sane, but in the process was identified as a habitual liar. The Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 District Court ruled that Koivunen was guilty on all three charges of assault, false imprisonment and negligent homicide, and sentenced him to 25 years in prison. The release date is unknown. Koivunen died on May 27, 2003. == References == == External links == * Ilta-Sanomat article about Koivunen * Murha info about the murders * Live archive about the murders * Sculpture of Salme Mets\u00e4nikula Category:Finnish serial killers Category:1930 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Male serial killers ",
