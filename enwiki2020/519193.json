    "text": "Sri Lanka is a tropical island situated close to the southern tip of India. The bird life of Sri Lanka is very rich for its size and 505 species have been recorded. In addition to the many resident birds, a considerable number of migratory species winter in the country to escape their northern breeding grounds. 26 species are confirmed as endemic. The other resident species are also found in the nearby Indian mainland, but over 80 have developed distinct Sri Lankan races. Some of these races are very different in their plumage characteristics from the related forms in India. 26 species are globally threatened. Bird distribution in Sri Lanka is largely determined by its climatic zones. The dry zone is largest of the three, covering more than half of the island, with a prolonged dry and hot period and only one monsoon (the north east monsoon from October to January). The wet zone, with two monsoons, is in the south western quarter of the island, where the few remaining rain forests are found and humidity is high. The central hill zone rises to over 2450 m (8-10,000 ft) and has a cool temperate climate. Most of the 26 endemic species are confined to the wet and the hill zones, with only a few extending into the dry zone as well. Recent updates and sighting information can be obtained through the Field Ornithology Group of Sri Lanka website. The following list is prepared according to An Illustrated Guide to the Birds of Sri Lanka on 2010 by Sarath Kotagama and Gamini Ratnavira. Supplemental updates follow The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 2019 edition. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Sri Lanka * (E) Endemic - a species native or restricted to Sri Lanka * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Sri Lanka as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions ==Ducks, geese, and waterfowl== Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating. {| width=60% class=\"wikitable\" !width=20% | Name !width=30% | Binomial !width=40% | Subspecies !width=30% | Status !width=30% | IUCN |- |Fulvous whistling-duck 200px |Dendrocygna bicolor | | |Least concern (A) |- |Lesser whistling-duck 200px |Dendrocygna javanica | |Resident |Least concern |- |Graylag goose 200px |Anser anser |Anser anser rubrirostris | |Least concern (A) |- |Knob-billed duck 200px |Sarkidiornis melanotos | | |Least concern (A) |- |Ruddy shelduck 200px |Tadorna ferruginea | | |Least concern (A) |- |Cotton pygmy-goose 200px |Nettapus coromandelianus | |Resident |Least concern |- |Garganey 200px |Spatula querquedula | | |Least concern |- |Northern shoveler 200px |Spatula clypeata | | |Least concern |- |Gadwall male male |Mareca strepera |Mareca strepera strepera | |Least concern (A) |- |Eurasian wigeon 200px |Mareca penelope | | |Least concern |- |Indian spot-billed duck 200px |Anas poecilorhyncha |Anas poecilorhyncha poecilorhyncha | |Least concern |- |Mallard 200px |Anas platyrhynchos | Anas platyrhynchos platyrhynchos | |Least concern (A) |- |Northern pintail 200px |Anas acuta | | |Least concern |- |Green-winged teal 200px |Anas crecca | | |Least concern |- |Marbled teal 200px |Marmaronetta angustirostris | | |Vulnerable (A) |- |Red-crested pochard male female |Netta rufina | | |Least concern (A) |- |Common pochard male male |Aythya ferina | | |Vulnerable (A) |- |Tufted duck 200px |Aythya fuligula | | |Least concern (A) |} ==Pheasants, grouse, and allies== Order: GalliformesFamily: Phasianidae The Phasianidae are a family of terrestrial birds.
