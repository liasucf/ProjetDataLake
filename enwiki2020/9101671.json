The first group to be officially listed as a terrorist organization under the law is the Abu Sayyaf on September 10, 2015 by the Basilan provincial court. ==List of terrorist incidents in the Philippines== Since January 2000 radical Islamist groups and Islamist separatist forces in the Philippines have carried out over 40 major bombings against civilians and civilian property, mostly in the southern regions of the country around Mindanao, Basilan, Jolo and other nearby islands.Human Rights Watch Lives Destroyed: Attacks on Civilians in the Philippines. July 2007 Numerous bombings have also been carried out in and around Metro Manila, though several hundred kilometres from the conflict in the southern regions, due to its political importance. In the period from 2000 to 2007 attacks killed nearly 400 Filipino civilians and injured well over 1500 more, more casualties than caused by bombings and other attacks in Indonesia, Morocco, Spain, Turkey, or Britain during the same period. Public transport and other gathering places, such as street markets, have been the favoured bombing targets, however large-scale abductions and shootings have also been carried out by the groups, predominantly by Abu Sayyaf and the Rajah Solaiman Movement, two groups that had claimed responsibility for most of the attacks.Carlos H.
