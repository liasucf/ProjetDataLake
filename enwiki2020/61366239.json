The adopted brother of H\u014dj\u014d Ujiyasu, H\u014dj\u014d Tsunashige was command of the castle. ==History== Tamanawa Castle was built in 1512 by H\u014dj\u014d S\u014dun and was controlled by the Later H\u014dj\u014d clan. The castle was responsible for the northern approaches to guard the clan\u2019s primary castle, Odawara Castle but well fortified so Uesugi Kenshin's army didn`t even attack the castle when Siege of Odawara (1561) happened. During the siege of Odawara in 1590, H\u014dj\u014d Ujikatsu surrendered without resistance. After the Siege of Odawara, Tamanawa castle was given to Tokugawa Ieyasu`s one of the most trusted vassals Honda Masanobu. There are little remains of the castle on the present day site, just some moats and earthworks. Excavated artefacts from the castle are exhibited at Ry\u016bh\u014d-ji Temple near the castle. ==Access== The castle remains are located on the outskirts of Kamakura, close to \u014cfuna Station(About 15 minutes walk from \u014cfuna Station). ==Gallery== File:\u8acf\u8a2a\u58c7\u4e0b \u571f\u5841\uff1f\uff1f2 2014.jpg|Eathen wall of Tamanawa Castle(under the Suwadan compound) File:Moat of Tamanawa Castle.jpg|Horikiri style moat of Tamanawa Castle File:Horikiri of Tamanawa Castle.jpg|Horikiri style Moat of Tamanawa Castle File:408 \u592a\u9f13\u90ed.jpg|Taikokuruwa compound ==References== Category:Castles in Kanagawa Prefecture Category:Former castles in Japan Category:Ruined castles in Japan Category:Go-H\u014dj\u014d clan Category:Castles in Japan Category:1510s establishments in Japan ",
