(1960\u201363), Paris (1963\u201366), Kuala Lumpur (1966\u201368) and London (1972\u201377), where he studied at the Royal College of Defence Studies and was deputy high commissioner. He was Secretary of Defence from 1979 to 1988 and ambassador to the United States from 1991 to 1994. After his retirement from government service in 1995, he served as the Joan and James Warburg Chair of International Relations at Simmons College in Boston. His distinguished career as a public servant, writer, historian and commentator on international relations also led him to be a Visiting Fellow at the Strategic & Defense Studies Centre, the Australian National University in Canberra, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and the U.S. Institute of Peace. He also served for several years on the New Zealand Press Council. He wrote three books: The Long Pathway, Te Araroa (1986), about walking the East Coast of the North Island with his family; The Prickly Pair (2003), on Australian-NZ relations; and Howard Kippenberger: Dauntless Spirit (2008), a biography of military commander Sir Howard Kippenberger. The common theme underlying the apparent diversity of McLean's writing was a fascination with New Zealand's evolving national identity.

McLean died on 30 March 2011 at his home in Wellington. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:2011 deaths Category:New Zealand Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Ambassadors of New Zealand to the United States Category:New Zealand public servants Category:People educated at Nelson College Category:Victoria University of Wellington alumni Category:Alumni of University College, Oxford Category:New Zealand academics Category:Simmons College (Massachusetts) faculty Category:New Zealand Rhodes Scholars Category:People from Napier, New Zealand Category:People from Wellington City ",
