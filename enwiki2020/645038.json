    "text": "Bothrochilus is a genus of nonvenomous pythonid snakes, which currently comprises seven species. ==Species== The genus Bothrochilus contains the following seven species which are recognized as being valid.\"Bothrochilus \". The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. *Bothrochilus albertisii \u2013 D\u2019Albertis python, northern white-lipped python *Bothrochilus biakensis \u2013 Biak whitelip python *Bothrochilus boa \u2013 Bismarck ringed python *Bothrochilus fredparkeri \u2013 Karimui Basin whitelip python *Bothrochilus huonensis \u2013 Huon Peninsula whitelip python *Bothrochilus meridionalis \u2013 southern whitelip python *Bothrochilus montanus \u2013 Wau whitelip python Nota bene: A binomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species was originally described in a genus other than Bothrochilus. ==Description== Female adults of the northern white-lipped python (Bothrochilus albertisii) grow to an average of about 213 cm in length (6\u20137 ft), whereas the southern whitelip python can reach up to in length. They are patternless, except the northern white-lipped python has some light markings on its postoculars,Mehrtens JM. 1987. Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . which are absent in the southern whitelip python. The snout is triangular and the head is distinct from the neck. The dorsum of the head is shiny black, the upper and lower labial scales are white with black markings on the anterior edge of the scales. Body color is either brownish-violet fading to yellowish ventrally (B. albertisii) or blackish-blue fading to gray. These pythons occasionally regurgitate fur balls, or castings, a few days after feeding on a furred prey item. ==Behavior== Although mostly terrestrial, these snakes can and are known to occasionally climb. White-lipped pythons are reportedly aggressive, though this is reduced in those born and raised in captivity. These snakes have also been observed to regularly regurgitate fur balls from their prey. ==Geographic range== These snakes are found in most of New Guinea (below 1200 m), including the islands of Salawati and Biak, Normanby, Mussau and Emirau, as well as a few islands in the Torres Strait. The type locality given is \"Kapaor in Nova Guinea boreali occidentali ... et prope Andai \". The authors also stated localities for two additional specimens: \"... un esemplare a Kapaor fra i Papua Onin...\" and \"... un secondo esemplare ad Andai presso Dorei...\" (Kapoar, Onin Peninsula and Andai, near Dorei, Irian Jaya, Indonesia).McDiarmid RW, Campbell JA, Tour\u00e9 T. 1999.

Some doubt can be cast on its occurrence on Normanby, as McDowell (1975)McDowell SB. 1975. \"A catalogue of the snakes of New Guinea and the Solomon\u2019s, with special Reference to Those in the Bernice P. Bishop Museum. Part II\". (24.02.1975).

Loria in British New Guinea\". Annali del Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova, Series 2, 18: 694-710. and Koopman (1982).Koopman KF. 1982. \"Results of the Archibold Expedition No. 109. Bats from Eastern Papua and the East Papua Islands\". American Museum Novitates (2747): 1-34. ==Habitat== Associated with rain forests, cutover clearings and swamps, they are usually found near water, into which they may quickly retreat if disturbed. They often hide under dead leaves on forest floor. ==Feeding== The diet includes a range of small- to medium-sized birds and mammals. Neonates and juveniles often feed on lizards. Heat sensitive pits in the upper and lower jaws are used to help locate prey during nocturnal hunting. ==Reproduction== The oviparous females lay about a dozen eggs. The eggs stick together in a compact pile, and the females coils around them. The hatchlings emerge after about two months of incubation and are about in length. ==Taxonomy== A new species B. hoserae, and two new subspecies B. albertisii barkeri and B. a. bennetti, were described in Hoser (2000),Hoser R. 2000. A Revision of the Australasian pythons. HTML at C-View Media. Accessed 10 September 2007.Hoser R. 2000. A Revision of the Australasian pythons. HTML at Smuggled.com. Accessed 10 September 2007. but these descriptions are considered vague and questionable.W\u00fcster W, Bush B, Keogh JS, O'Shea M, Shine R. 2001. \"Taxonomic contributions in the \"amateur\" literature: comments on recent descriptions of new genera and species by Raymond Hoser\". Litteratura Serpentium 21: 67-91. PDF at Wolfgang W\u00fcster . Accessed 10 September 2007. In 2008, Schleip redescribed and provided proper descriptions and diagnoses for two of Hoser's (2000) taxa, Bothrochilus hoserae, from the southern lowlands of Papua New Guinea and neighbouring Indonesia, and B. benettorum, from the highlands of Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. A third, Bothrochilus albertisii barkeri was considered a nomen nudum due to Hoser not having provided a description that includes characters to differentiate this taxon from others. Three new species were also described: B. biakensis from the island of Biak (part of the Indonesian Province of Papua), B. fredparkeri from the Karimui Basin, Simbu Province, Papua New Guinea, and B. huonensis from the Huon Peninsula, Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. The taxonomy of the family Pythonidae is fluid; however, an arrangementR. Graham Reynolds, Matthew L. Niemiller, Liam J. Revell, 2014, Toward a Tree-of-Life for the boas and pythons: Multilocus species-level phylogeny with unprecedented taxon sampling of the genus may be summarised as: (* The specific name, bennettorum, is genitive plural because it is in honor of two unrelated zoologists named Bennett: Clive Bennett, and Daniel Bennett.)Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M. 2011.
