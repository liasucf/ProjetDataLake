    "text": "Bnei Akiva (, \"Children of Akiva\") is the largest religious Zionist youth movement in the world, with over 125,000 members in 42 countries. It was established in 1929 in Mandatory Palestine. ==History== Bnei Akiva was established in 1929 as the youth wing of the Mizrachi movement. Concurrent with the establishment of the movement in pre-independence Israel, organizations of religious youth operated in the Diaspora. Some of them adopted the name Bnei Akiva and others had appellations such as HaShomer HaDati. Twenty-five years later (1958), the Israeli and Diaspora groups merged and the Mazkirut Olamit (World Secretariat) of Bnei Akiva was formed. ==Ideology== Bnei Akiva's objectives are to educate Jewish youth with values of Torah and work, to provide stimulating experiential and informal opportunities for encountering Judaism, and to encourage Jewish continuity and leadership. Bnei Akiva's twin ideals of Torah and Avodah translate to religious commitment and work on the land of Israel. Bnei Akiva believes in emigration to the land of Israel (Aliya) as a central commandment of Judaism, and maintains that the future of the Jewish people is tied to the state of Israel. In the organization's early years, Avodah was understood as meaning agricultural work, as reflected in the symbolism of the movement's emblem. In more recent years, there has driven a shift in ideology towards a broader definition of working for the development of the country. Members are encouraged to spend a year in Israel on organized learning and touring programs to broaden their knowledge of Israel and developing their leadership skills. Similarly, the original socialist aims of Bnei Akiva are less actively pursued. Until the 1980s many Bnei Akiva members joined religious Kibbutzim in groups based on mutual army service or Aliya. Since the 1990s, Bnei Akiva members now typically settle in development towns and settlements. ==Organizational framework== In Israel, Bnei Akiva is affiliated with the Religious Kibbutz Movement and the party \"The Jewish Home\". It is run by a National Secretariat (Hanhala Artzit). Outside Israel, local branches of Bnei Akiva are under the Bnei Akiva Olami (Worldwide) organization. In every country, Bnei Akiva operates a network of Shabbat groups, summer camps, leadership seminars, Shabbatonim, and other activities. ==Symbols of Bnei Akiva== ===Emblem=== Bnei Akiva emblem The \"Semel\", Bnei Akiva's emblem, shows farming utensils and wheat sheaves symbolizing the agricultural perspective of the ideology, and two tablets of stone in the center symbolizing the Torah. The two perspectives of Torah and Avoda are united together by the ribbon which says Bnei Akiva on it - symbolizing that the two aspects can only and must work hand in hand. The letters on the two tablets are the Hebrew letters 'Tav' and 'Ayin' standing for Torah veAvoda (\"Torah and work\"). ===Anthem=== The Bnei Akiva's anthem, entitled Yad Achim, was composed by Moshe-Zvi Neria (originally known as Chaver Minkin). He composed the anthem during the Chol HaMoed period of the holiday of Sukkot, 1932, at a gathering of youth leaders in Kfar Saba. Although the words and the melody have been changed to some extent, the anthem is sung on many Bnei Akiva occasions. It is sung in Hebrew. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Original Text !Translation to English |- | \u05d9\u05d3 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05db\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05d4, \u05d4\u05e0\u05d5\u05e2\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d1\u05d9\u05d1 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d3\u05d2\u05dc\u05e0\u05d5 \u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05db\u05dd, \u05d7\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05e1\u05d1\u05d9\u05d1 \u05d9\u05d6\u05d4\u05d9\u05e8 \u05dc\u05db\u05dd \u05db\u05d5\u05db\u05d1 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05db\u05db\u05dd \u05e1\u05d5\u05d2\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d1 \u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e5 \u05d5\u05d1\u05e2\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u00b4, \u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e0\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4! \u05e7\u05d3\u05d9\u05de\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9-\u05e2\u05e7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0, \u05d4\u05d9\u05d3\u05d3 \u05d1\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4! \u05de\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05ea \u05d6\u05d5, \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d0\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea, \u05d0\u05e8\u05e6\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d3\u05d5\u05e9\u05d4 \u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8-\u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1 \u05dc\u05e0\u05d5 \u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05e9\u05d4 \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e2\u05de\u05e7\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05db\u05e4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d2\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d1 \u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e5 \u05d5\u05d1\u05e2\u05d6\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u00b4, \u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e0\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4! \u05e7\u05d3\u05d9\u05de\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9-\u05e2\u05e7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d0, \u05d4\u05d9\u05d3\u05d3 \u05d1\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4! || A brotherly hand is stretched out to you, O beloved youth: Gather yourselves around our flag.

The mifkad is the assembly where announcements are made, members are counted and the ideology is reaffirmed. With slight variations, the text of mifkad is the same all over the world, following a basic structure. ==Lexicon== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Hebrew ! Transliteration ! Literal translation !

The Melbourne snif is the largest in Bnei Akiva Olami. Tochniot are held on Saturday afternoons, and bi-annual camps are run for each state. Other initiatives include weekly learning, group volunteer days, and regular minyanim. Bnei Akiva Melbourne runs an annual \"Amazing Race\" styled event. Bnei Akiva Sydney celebrated its 50th anniversary on November 7, 1999, at the Hakoah Club. The event was well-received by madrichim, chanichim, and bogrim. Bnei Akiva Perth is a flourishing snif that is a driving force in the Perth Jewish Community. It coordinates a number of events during the year including a themed Kabbalat Shabbat, providing gift baskets for Purim, an Israeli history movie night, and Shabbat dinners throughout the year. There is a federal summer camp held in December attended by senior chanichim from all snifim in Australia and New Zealand. Bnei Akiva Australia is a member of the Australasian Zionist Youth Council (AZYC). ===Brazil=== There are two snifim in Rio de Janeiro. One in Copacabana (named Snif Metzadah) and another one in Tijuca (named Snif Beit Yafah). Bnei Akiva's presence in S\u00e3o Paulo started in the early 50s. It now has two snifim, one in Higien\u00f3polis and one in Jardins. Bnei Akiva also has a snif in Bel\u00e9m. Today, Bnei Akiva has more participants than any other Zionist Youth Movement in Rio de Janeiro, making up to 180 chanichim and 70 madrichim. Bnei Akiva's activities include Shabbatonim, field trips, and camp; each year, in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, there are two camps, one in the winter and one in the summer, while Bel\u00e9m only has a summer camp. There are commemorations of the Jewish holidays in the local Bnei Akiva synagogues in Rio de Janeiro and Bel\u00e9m, and S\u00e3o Paulo, where there are two synagogues. ===Europe=== ====Netherlands==== In the Netherlands, Bne Akiwa (the way it is transcribed in Dutch) started after the Holocaust period. During the latter half of the 20th century its main yearly activities were weekly pe'ulot on Shabbath in Amsterdam and on Sunday in other cities, summer and winter camps in the country, different European camps in the summer (Sayarim and Seminar Torani), Avoda summercamp in Israel, and participation in Hachshara year in Israel programs; Shabbath Ha'irgun weekend; publication of the magazine Zeraim. Different from other countries the movement is led by a Board which consists of members aged 16\u201322 years, placing a rather big responsibility on young shoulders, while the shaliach is the chairman. Many members have made aliya, while those who stay(ed) play(ed) significant roles in Jewish communal and non-Jewish life. ====France==== There are snifim in the most important cities such as Paris, Lyon, Marseille and Strasbourg. Paris hosts several snifim. Each year several mahanot are organized for the winter and summer holidays. A Shabbat is organized each year for all the madrichim around the country. In France, the director of a snif is called a merakez. ====Belgium==== There are two snifim in Belgium: one in Antwerp and one in Brussels. The larger snif in Antwerp has 120 members, while Brussels has 40. ====Switzerland==== Bnei Akiva Switzerland was founded in 1936. Numerous former Bnei Akiva Switzerland chaverim have made aliya as a result of being in the youth movement. Today, Bnei Akiva Switzerland has more than 120 members in the two chapters (snifim), in Basel and Zurich. Geneva used to have its own chapter, but was closed by the parent organization in Israel because of a lack of interested members. Bnei Akiva is the biggest Jewish youth organization in Switzerland. Due to the lack of a Jewish high school in Switzerland, Bnei Akiva fulfills an important role as a regular meeting place. It is a vital entity that allows high-school students, who do not see each other on a daily basis, to stay in contact with their Jewish friends. Every year there are two camps, one in summer and one in winter. Additionally, the two oldest shvatim (\"tribes\") join the Sayarim summer camp (a camp in which usually the oldest shevet of chapters all over Europe take part) on a biannual basis, followed by a four-week Israel trip the following year. A number of Shabbatonim take place throughout the year, such as the Yom Yerushalayim weekend. This snif is known as one of the worst snifim in Europe. ===United Kingdom=== Bnei Akiva in the UK was founded in 1939. Its beginnings were closely associated with Bachad and the Torah V'Avodah movement, which both encouraged aliya. Arieh Handler was the main figure in the early growth of Bnei Akiva, as he brought over children from Nazi Europe on the Kindertransport and placed them in Bachad Hachshara (preparation) centres. These aimed to prepare the youth to work the Land of Israel on kibbutzim by learning agricultural techniques. The first of these was at Gwrych Castle, which held the first-ever gathering of Bnei Akiva UK in December 1940. After the local Marquis shut down the centre and expelled the Jewish immigrants, other hachshara centres were set up in Bromsgrove, Buckinghamshire and the most famous, Thaxted, Essex. Many Kibbutzim, including Lavi and Beit Rimon, were founded by members of BAUK. In modern times, hachshara takes place in Israel and involves two schemes: Torani (the yeshiva and seminary track) and Kivun (giving participants a range of experiences in Israel). Bnei Akiva is the leading provider of gap years to Israel for 18-year-olds in the UK. Nowadays, Bnei Akiva is the largest Jewish youth movement in the country, with more than 1,000 members paying Mas Chaver (membership) each year. It is run by five full-time sabbatical workers who work in the London Bayit, the offices of Bnei Akiva UK. Bnei Akiva also brings over families of shlichim (emissaries) from Israel, one serving as the Bnei Akiva rabbinical couple and one serving the northern communities. The mazkirut and shlichim together with the nivcharim [elected representatives], who are elected by the movement's members each year, form the Hanhalla [governing body]. Bnei Akiva runs 21 svivot (branches) around the UK. They run activities on Shabbat afternoons as well as running Succah Crawls, Family Friday Nights and Shabbatot Ha'Irgun. This year, there are active Bnei Akiva groups in, Barnet, Borehamwood & Elstree, Brondesbury Park, Bushey, Cheadle, Chigwell, Edgware, Finchley, Golders Green, Hale, Hampstead Garden Suburb, Hendon, Leeds, Mill Hill, Muswell Hill, Oxford, Pinner, Radlett, Salford, South Hampstead, South Woodford, Stanmore, Whitefield and Woodside Park. Areas which have previously hosted Svivot include, Accrington, Belmont, Birmingham, Bowdon, Edinburgh, Kenton, Kingsbury, Maida Vale, Newcastle, Redbridge, Sheffield, Southgate, Stamford Hill and Sunderland. The svivot mostly operate in local synagogues, however Bnei Akiva has two purpose-built buildings to house activities in Temple Fortune in London and Salford. Bnei Akiva runs summer and winter camps (machanot) from school years 3\u201312. The winter camps include Aleph (Years Six & Seven), Ma'apilim (Year Eight), Haroeh (Year Nine), Gimmel (Year Ten) and Hadracha Course (Year Twelve). H-Course is a long- running leadership training camp which gives participants the skills to become the future leaders of the movement. Summer camps include Ari (Years 3-6), Aleph (Year Six), Aleph Chalutzi (Year Seven), Bet Base (Year Eight), Bet Chalutzi (Year Nine) and Gimmel (Year Ten). For Year 11, there is Israel Machane, a three-week-long tour visiting sites in Israel. In 2011, Machane Cadur Regel (Football Camp) ran for years 3\u20135 in partnership with Arsenal Football Club. Bnei Akiva also used to run the widely acclaimed Yachad programme, which caters for children with disabilities who want to be involved in camps. In addition, there is a Beit Midrash Programme (BMP) which runs in conjunction with the other camps every summer. In recent years, Bnei Akiva has teamed up with Kaytana to run camps for Ethiopian children in Israel and also with Camp Simcha UK to run Keshet camp in London for children with serious illnesses. More than 1,000 people are involved in Bnei Akiva camps each year, making it the biggest provider of Jewish youth group camps in the UK. Bnei Akiva UK actively supports projects in memory of Yoni Jesner who was heavily involved with the Glasgow branch of Bnei Akiva. He died from a critical head injury following a suicide bus bombing in Tel-Aviv, Israel. ===Mexico=== Bnei Akiva in Mexico was founded in 1948. It is located in Mexico City, with three chapters and one main house, which is the center of activities. There are more than 100 active members in the movement and a large population of non-active members, those who have grown too old for the youth groups, or those who have \"made Aliya\" (moved to Israel). Bnei Akiva members are involved in community service such as participating in its institutions, studying in Jewish day schools, Hebrew schools and Yeshivot, and participating in Chessed activities (community service). ===New Zealand=== Bnei Akiva is one of the main Jewish youth movements in New Zealand, with weekly meetings and activities in Auckland and Wellington and national bi-annual camps. Bnei Akiva NZ's goal is to educate Jewish youth with the values of Torah ve'Avodah, combining a deeply rooted association with Israel together with day-to-day life in accordance with traditional Jewish values, and to provide stimulating experiential and informal opportunities for encountering Judaism. Bnei Akiva NZ ensures Jewish continuity and the future of the New Zealand Jewish community. Bnei Akiva New Zealand is a member of the Australasian Zionist Youth Council (AZYC).Website of Bnei Akiva New Zealand. ===United States and Canada=== Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada (known before 1993 as Bnei Akiva of North America) was formed with the 1950 merger between HaShomer HaDati and Bnei Akiva. It has several tiers of organization. At its most basic level, Bnei Akiva operates on a local level with Glilim (cities), which often contain one or more snifim (branches) where youth groups are run on Shabbat. Most Glilim are run by shlichim, (emissaries) from Israel, usually young couples. The first Bnei Akiva galil in America, technically belonging to HaShomer HaDati, was organized in Brooklyn by Meir Golombek in 1934, with additional Glilim forming around young leaders throughout the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s at a time when very little Zionist education was available in the United States. The level of activity in any given galil has fluctuated over the years depending on the level of leadership present. In 2000, in an attempt to help Glilim that were without their own shlichim, Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada formally added an additional regional infrastructure, with shlichim appointed to serve in a regional role and coordinate activities in several Glilim. The first such regional shaliach, for the Midwest, was Ilan Frydman. In additional to the galil-based organization of Bnei Akiva, a second focus of activities in Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada are the summer camps, known as Camp Moshava. The first Moshava, in Hightstown, New Jersey, was established in 1936, with a second one opening in Rolling Prairie, Indiana in 1938 and a third in Bronte, Ontario in 1946. In 1947, a fourth Moshava began operating in Saugus, California. Camp Stone, the fifth Moshava, began operating as a Bnei Akiva camp in conjunction with Young Israel in 1972. (Stone operated for three years without direct involvement from Bnei Akiva, from 1969-1972). The largest camp is the New York metropolitan area branch, located in Indian Orchard, Pennsylvania, with 1,500 campers and 400 counselors.Sones, Mordechai (May 7, 2018) \"15,000 Children to Attend Bnei Akiva Summer Camp in 16 Countries\", Israel National News. Retrieved May 24, 2020. The Midwest Moshava moved to Wild Rose, Wisconsin, and the Canadian Moshava relocated to Ennismore, Ontario. The California Moshava currently operates out of Running Springs after a long hiatus following the 1985 sale of their Big Bear campus. The current Moshava overnight camp directors are Alan Silverman - Moshava IO, Yakov & Estee Fleischman- Camp Stone, Avi Mantanky - Moshava California, Vicky Shizgal - Moshava Canada Ennismore and Dikla Weitzner - Moshava in Wildrose. Bnei Akiva also operates local day camps during the summer in New Jersey, directed by Shlomo Stern (who is additional the Associate Director of Moshava IO) and Rabbi Ben Fried and Toronto directed by Samara Yunger, the newest addition is Greater Philadelphia located in Lower Merion directed by James Williams. This follows the first attempt at such a program in Atlanta in the early 1990s. Attendance at Bnei Akiva summer programs is typically larger than participation in Glilim, though many chanichim and madrichim are active in both frameworks. Additionally, there are several national programs that are run by Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada, most notably Mach Hach Baaretz directed by Rabbi Daniel Katz, a six-week tour of Israel following 10th grade which attracts many participants who are not otherwise involved with Bnei Akiva. This program was started in 1972 by members in Los Angeles, and has grown to be one of the most successful and popular programs offered by Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada. Another program, Machal, which is for graduates of 9th grade, was originally a national program, but is now run out of each camp separately. Various national shabbatonim are run by the national office, including Kenes Manhigei Chevraya Bet (KMCB) which brings together some of the most promising young high school leaders for extra training. Rabbi Shaul Feldman the Executive Director for over 20 years overseas a strong leadership team including Bini Dachs - Assistant Executive Director, Natalie Vinegar - Director of Marketing, Shula Bashkin - Office Manager & Programs Registrar, Robyn Adams - Director of New York-New Jersey region, James Williams - Director of Operations, Director of Florida & Southern Regional Director, Rafi Engelheart -Director of Education. Zehava Seidman currently serves as Mazkira Artzi (National Directors of Programming) of Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada. ====Boston==== Bnei Akiva Boston has two active Snifim: Sharon Bnei Akiva in Young Israel of Sharon, and Newton Bnei Akiva (NBA) as a joint program between Congregations Beth El- Atereth Israel and Shaarei Tefillah. Bnei Akiva Boston recommenced activity in September 2007 after a decade-long hiatus. As of 2017, Sharon Bnei Akiva operates its weekly activities on Shabbat afternoons for 2-8th grade children while NBA operates on Shabbat afternoons in the Fall/Spring and Motzei Shabbat in the winter. ====Chicago==== Bnei Akiva of Chicago was established in 1935 is one of the largest Glilim in the country. Chicago hosts several local and regional shabbatonim each year. Galil Chicago has four snifim named Saad, Tirat Tzvi, Lakeview and Kfar Tzion. Chaverim from Chicago traditionally attend Camp Moshava, Wild Rose, WI, in the summers, and that Moshava is most associated with Galil Chicago. It is part of the Midwest Region. ====Cleveland==== Bnei Akiva Cleveland currently has more than 100 members, counting chanichim and madrichim. The city hosts a number of annual activities, including a Purim Carnival and Sukkot Festival, as well as a number of community programs such as Musicians Towers (prayers led by Bnei Akiva in a nursing home for the major Jewish holidays). The current shlichim in Cleveland are Eitan and Tayla Weiss, with two additional Bnot Sherut. Members of Bnei Akiva Cleveland typically attend Camp Stone in the summer, and that camp's headquarters is located in Cleveland. Galil Cleveland is part of the Midwest Region. ====Detroit==== Bnei Akiva has been operating in Detroit since 1950. Bnei Akiva has three snifim that meet every Shabbat: at the Young Israel of Oak Park, at the Young Israel of Southfield and at Ohel Moed of Shomrey Emunah in West Bloomfield. Many members of Bnei Akiva of Detroit have moved to Israel, and one former shaliach, Otniel Schneller, previously served in the Knesset. The current shaliach is Liat and David HaLevi, who lives in Oak Park, MI. Galil Detroit is in the Midwest Region, and campers primarily attend Camp Stone. ====Hamilton==== Bnei Akiva of Hamilton is currently run by Mazkir Galil Ethan Terazadeh. Contrary to popular belief, Bnei Akiva of Hamilton is not the actual name for this Snif, rather called Bnei Akiva of Narnia. ====Los Angeles==== Bnei Akiva Los Angeles (BALA), founded in 1946, is one of the oldest and most active Glilim in North America. BALA has four snifim spread throughout Los Angeles, each named after a prominent religious kibbutz: Snif Lavi (Tarzana), Snif Tirat Tzvi (North Hollywood), Snif Sa'ad (Hancock Park), and Snif Shluchot (Beverly Hills). Each snif holds weekly programming on Shabbatot for chanichim ranging from 2nd through 5th grade. In addition to its four snifim, BALA holds frequent events and programming for Vazach (sixth through eighth grade) and Chevraya Bet (high school). BALA also runs a Manhigut (leadership) program for ninth graders, in which budding Bnei Akiva leaders learn valuable leadership skills in preparation for joining the hadracha staff the following year. After a period of stagnation and low participation in the 2000s, BALA has undergone a significant revival in recent years, thanks in large part to the efforts of beloved former shlichim Eyal Friedman and Toby Tabak, who began their tenure in 2013 and were replaced in 2017 by Hagai and Adina Keisar. ====Montreal==== Bnei Akiva of Montreal is based in Hebrew Academy, where they have their one branch (snif-\u05e1\u05e0\u05d9\u05e3).

In 1954, Rabbi Meir Kahane, became the mazkir (director) of Greater New York's sixteen chapters.Magid, Shaul (March 14, 2019) \"Kahane Won\", Tablet. Retrieved July 6, 2020. BANYNJABOS has branches in New Jersey (in Teaneck) and New York (on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Riverdale in the Bronx, Scarsdale and New Rochelle in Westchester, and West Hempstead and North Woodmere in Long Island), and in Newton. BANYNJABOS also runs Shabbatonim and special events throughout the year for youth who are connected to Camp Moshava in Indian Orchard, Pennsylvania. Additional programs are run for college students, and largely focus on a commitment to live in the Land of Israel. ====Philadelphia==== Bnei Akiva of Philadelphia maintains three snifim: Northeast Philadelphia, Lower Merion and Cherry Hill, NJ. Galil Philadelphia prides itself on its dedicated and spirited core of madrichim. It is part of the Mid-Atlantic Region, and hosts a range of exciting activities and Shabbatonim each year while receiving guidance from college-aged bogrim. While the Northeast branch has been in existence for decades, Snif Lower Merion began weekly Shabbat programming in September 2003 under the leadership of Chava Forman. In September 2012, Galil Philadelphia added a third snif in Cherry Hill, NJ. Eliya and Oded Pe'er are the regional shlichim this past summer they open Moshava Ba'Ir with Rosh Moshava Sari Gindoff-Linder. ====Pittsburgh==== An active galil existed in Pittsburgh through the 1960s, when it became dormant.

Toronto houses the only Bnei Akiva yeshiva outside Israel, Yeshivat Ohr Chaim with Ulpanat Orot, forms Bnei Akiva Schools of Toronto. Currently, Eliav Saban and Yakira Gasner are the Mazkirim of Bnei Akiva of Toronto. Bnei Akiva Toronto is a member of the Midwest Region. ====Other Glilim==== Additional cities with active Bnei Akiva chapters include Atlanta, Baltimore, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Hollywood, FL, Houston, Minneapolis, Potomac, Silver Spring, and Washington. In the past, there have been several other chapters, including Boca Raton, Memphis, Miami, Phoenix, San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle. ====Gap Year Programming==== Historically, Bnei Akiva operated several Gap Year programs. Until the 1980s, members of Bnei Akiva of the US and Canada (BAUS&C;) participated in Hachshara. Since 1982, Bnei Akiva has offered a program called Tochnit Nissan for members studying in Israel during the month of Nissan. Traditionally, this program took place on a kibbutz, though other options are now offered. In the early 1990s, a program called Midrash Uma'aseh existed and drew many of the most involved members of Bnei Akiva. For the 2014-2015 year, BAUS&C; launched a seminary and a yeshiva program in the Katamon neighborhood of Jerusalem called Midreshet Torah V'Avodah and Yeshivat Torah V'Avodah.http://www.tvaisrael.org/ It offers several months of focused in- depth Torah study in an Israeli yeshiva or midrasha setting, along with targeted internships, intense volunteering and service learning, some of it living and working on a Kibbutz. Gap year students affiliated with Bnei Akiva may also attend a range of other yeshivot and seminaries affiliated with Bnei Akiva ideology.See Ne'emanei Torah Va'Avodah information on Gap Year programs https://toravoda.org.il/choosing a yeshiva ====Aliya==== Bnei Akiva of the United States and Canada actively promotes aliya, but the way in which this occurs has changed over the years. Until the 1990s, chanichim were encouraged to make aliya in garinim, or small groups intended to bolster existing communities. These were almost always directed to a Kibbutz Hadati, and fierce debates took place as to whether any other form of aliya was a valid expression of the movement's ideals. Today the push for aliya is more general, with no specific communities or framework in mind. The focus is more on coming to Israel and contributing positively to society in any way. ===Bnei Akiva South Africa=== Bnei Akiva's presence in South Africa dates back to the 1920s. Today, it is one of the largest active Jewish youth movements in the country. It runs many Shabbatonim as well as weekly activities at its various centres on the country. Bnei Akiva runs a month-long annual summer camp in the Western Cape, which is attended by more than 1,000 chanichim (campers) and madrichim (counselors). There is also a winter camp held in different locations each year, and is attended by youth from all over South Africa. The movement also runs many Israel programs throughout the year including MTA, Tafnit, Hadracha Tzeira, Kfar Haroeh and Bema'aleh. ==See also== *Mizrachi (Religious Zionism) *Orthodox Judaism *Religious Kibbutz Movement *Religious Zionism ==References== * * - Yeshivot Bnei Akiva - In Israel (Hebrew) * - American Friends of Yeshivot Bnei Akiva *- Bnei Akiva UK (Bnei Akiva of Great Britain and Ireland) ==External links== *Bnei Akiva of the US and Canada *World Bnei Akiva Category:Youth organizations based in Israel Category:Zionist youth movements Category:Orthodox Judaism Category:Jewish clubs and societies Category:Religious Zionist organizations Category:Jewish organizations established in 1929 ",
