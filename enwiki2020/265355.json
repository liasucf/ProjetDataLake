    "text": "The Carter Center is a nongovernmental, not-for-profit organization founded in 1982 by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. He and his wife Rosalynn Carter partnered with Emory University just after his defeat in the 1980 U.S. Presidential elections. The center is located in a shared building adjacent to the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum on of parkland, on the site of the razed neighborhood of Copenhill, two miles (3 km) from downtown Atlanta, Georgia. The library and museum are owned and operated by the United States National Archives and Records Administration, while the Center is governed by a Board of Trustees, consisting of business leaders, educators, former government officials, and philanthropists. The Carter Center's goal is to advance human rights and alleviate human suffering, including helping improve the quality of life for people in more than 80 countries. The center has many projects including election monitoring, supporting locally led state-building and democratic institution-building in various countries, mediating conflicts between warring states, and intervening with heads of states on behalf of victims of human rights abuses. It also leads disease eradication efforts, spearheading the campaign to eradicate Guinea worm disease, as well as controlling and treating onchocerciasis, trachoma, lymphatic filariasis, and malaria through awareness campaigns. In 2002, President Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work \u201cto find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development\u201d through the Carter Center.Norwegian Nobel Committee, 2002 Nobel Peace Prize announcement, , October 11, 2002, accessed December 19, 2008. In 2007, he wrote an autobiography entitled Beyond the White House: Waging Peace, Fighting Disease, Building Hope, which chronicles the first 25 years of The Carter Center. ==History== The Center was founded in 1982 and dedicated in 1986 with William Foege as its executive director. In 1993, John Hardman was appointed executive director, and during the 1990s the Center received several multimillion-dollar donations to fight Guinea worm disease and to prevent blindness. In 1994, the center launched an initiative called \"Not Even One\" to fight child death by firearm. On October 2, 1995, The Rosalynn Carter Georgia Mental Health Forum was held at The Carter Center. ==Governance== The Center is governed by a board of trustees, which oversees the organization\u2019s assets and property and promotes its objectives and goals. A community advisory group \u2013 the Board of Councilors \u2013 includes public and private-sector leaders who support The Carter Center and its activities in their communities and organizations. Members attend quarterly presentations on the Center\u2019s work. CEO (Ret.) Ambassador Mary Ann Peters oversees the Center\u2019s day-to-day operations and staff of 175. Center-based councils of eminent persons who offer guidance to or participate in Center activities include: the Council of Presidents and Prime Ministers of the Americas, the International Task Force for Disease Eradication, and the Mental Health Task Force. The Carter Center also collaborates with other public and private organizations. ==Peace programs== ===Observing elections=== The Carter Center performs election observation, sending teams of observers to determine the legitimacy of 101 elections in 39 countries since 1989.The Carter Center, The Carter Center: Waging Peace Through Elections, accessed September 19, 2010. Carter Center observers analyze election laws, assess voter education and registration processes, and evaluate fairness in campaigns. The presence of impartial election observers deters interference or fraud in the voting process, and reassures voters that they can safely and secretly cast their ballots and that vote tabulation will be conducted without tampering. Teams typically include 30-100 highly qualified impartial observers \u2013 regional leaders, political scientists, regional specialists, and election observation professionals. The Carter Center sends observers only when invited by a country\u2019s electoral authorities and welcomed by the major political parties. Observers do not interfere in the electoral process and do not represent the U.S. government.The Carter Center, \"How does The Carter Center choose which elections to monitor?\" , accessed on December 19, 2008. The Center played a key role \u2013 with the U.N. Electoral Assistance Division and the National Democratic Institute \u2013 in building consensus on a common set of international principles for election observation.United Nations, \"Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation and Code of Conduct for International Election Observers\" , October 27, 2005, accessed on December 19, 2008. It is also leading the effort to develop effective methodologies for observing elections that employ new electronic voting technologies.Carter Center, \"Developing a Methodology for Observing Electronic Voting\", October 2007, accessed December 19, 2008. ===Strengthening democracy beyond elections=== The Carter Center supports the growth of democratic institutions to ensure that there is a respect for rule of law and human rights, that government decisions are open and transparent, and that everyone can have adequate resources to compete fairly for public office. For example, the Center is supporting the efforts of civic leaders in Ethiopia to convene discussions about the most pressing and contentious political and social issues facing the country, and in the Palestinian Territories, it maintains a small presence in Ramallah focused on the ongoing monitoring and analysis of critical issues of democratic development.Deborah Hakes, \"Carter Center Field Office in Ramallah\", May 4, 2007, accessed on December 19, 2008. Democratic initiatives in Latin America include support for regional access-to-information programs, creation of an inter-American support network, and reform of political campaign financing. The Center-based Council of Presidents and Prime Ministers of the Americas plays an important role in accomplishing these objectives.Members of the Council of Presidents and Prime Ministers of the Americas, The Carter Center also promotes the dissemination to emerging democracies and regional organizations of models, lessons, and best practices for democratic governance. The goal is to empower those in transitioning countries who are trying to build stronger democratic institutions and practices. ===Advancing human rights=== The Carter Center believes all people are entitled to basic human rights. These rights include political rights, such as peace, freedom, and self-governance, as well as the social rights of health care, food, shelter, and economic opportunity. The Center actively supports human rights defenders around the world. In partnership with Human Rights First and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Center holds an annual human rights defenders policy forum hosted by President Carter in Atlanta.Carter Center Human Rights Defenders Initiative, , accessed December 19, 2008. President and Mrs. Carter have intervened with heads of state on behalf of human rights defenders and victims for more than 20 years. They often take their human rights concerns to heads of state in personal meetings and through letters. The Center and President Carter are strong supporters of the U.N. Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court. Both oppose the death penalty and urge its abolition in the U.S. ===Mediating conflict=== Recalling President Carter\u2019s success in the White House negotiating the long-lasting peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, groups in conflict turn to The Carter Center to help them prevent and resolve conflict. Lacking any official authority, the Center has become a trusted broker for peace, serving as a channel for dialogue and negotiation. Recent examples include: * President Carter\u2019s mission to North Korea in 1994, which paved the way for a U.S.-North Korea pact on nuclear issues.Jimmy Carter, \"Solving the Korean Stalemate, One Step at a Time\", New York Times, October 11, 2006, accessed December 19, 2008. * Assisting unofficial Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in designing a model agreement for peace \u2013 called the Geneva Accord \u2013 in 2002-03.BBC News, \"Moderates Launch Middle East Plan\", December 1, 2003, accessed December 19, 2008. * Negotiation of the Nairobi Agreement in 1999 between Sudan and UgandaCarter Center Press Release, \"Agreement Between Governments of Sudan and Uganda, Nairobi Agreement\" , December 8, 1999, accessed on December 19, 2008. * President Carter\u2019s mission to Haiti in 1994 with Senator Sam Nunn and the then former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell to avert a U.S.-led multinational invasion and restore to power Haiti\u2019s democratically elected president.Larry Rohter, \"SHOWDOWN WITH HAITI: DIPLOMACY; Carter, in Haiti, Pursues Peaceful Shift\", New York Times, September 18, 1994, accessed on December 19, 2008. * President Carter\u2019s historic trip to Cuba in 2002 to seek improved U.S.-Cuban relationsBBC News, \"Lift Cuba embargo, Carter tells U.S.\", May 15, 2002, accessed on December 19, 2008. * Negotiation of a cease-fire in 1995 in Sudan to allow humanitarian groups treat Guinea worm disease and river blindness and immunize children. * Holding summits in Egypt and Tunisia in 1995-96 to address violence in the Great Lakes region of AfricaCarter Center Press Release, \"African Leaders Gather to Address Great Lakes Crisis\" , May 2, 1996, accessed on December 19, 2008. * An agreement on the restoration of low-level diplomatic relations between Colombia and Ecuador under a deal brokered by the former president, as announced by the Carter Center on June 8, 2008. ===Assisting China village elections=== Since 1988, the Chinese government has authorized direct village elections to help maintain social and political order in the context of rapid economic reforms. At the invitation of China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Carter Center initiated a joint project in 1998 to standardize Chinese village election procedures and assist in training of election officials and elected National People\u2019s Congress deputies. In 2011, the Carter Center decided to focus on advancing the US- China relationship, and since 2015 has been promoting greater Africa-U.S.-China cooperation. ==Health programs== The Center has prevented the suffering of millions of people around the world from illnesses often ignored by others. Health programs seek to provide people with the information and access to services they need to treat their illnesses and take steps to prevent future spread of disease. An emphasis is placed on building partnerships for change among international agencies, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and corporations and on working with ministries of health to strengthen or establish permanent health care delivery systems in the poorest nations. During his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, Carter commented on what he felt is the greatest challenge the world faces: \u201cAmong all the possible choices, I decided that the most serious and universal problem is the growing chasm between the richest and poorest people on earth. Citizens of the ten wealthiest countries are now 75 times richer than those who live in the ten poorest ones, and the separation is increasing every year, not only between nations but also within them. The results of this disparity are root causes of most of the world\u2019s unresolved problems, including starvation, illiteracy, environmental degradation, violent conflict and unnecessary illnesses that range from Guinea worm to HIV/AIDS. Tragically, in the industrialized world there is a terrible absence of understanding or concern about those who are enduring lives of despair and hopelessness. We have not yet made the commitment to share with others an appreciable part of our excessive wealth. This is a necessary and potentially rewarding burden that we should all be willing to assume.\" ===Disease eradication efforts=== The Carter Center began spearheading the campaign to eradicate Guinea worm disease worldwide in 1986. At the time, there were about 3.5 million annual cases of the disease in 20 countries in Africa and Asia. In 2016 there were 25 reported cases in three countries: South Sudan, Chad and Ethiopia. Guinea worm disease is poised to be the first parasitic disease to be eradicated and the only disease to be eradicated without the use of vaccines or drugs. Within affected countries, the Center reinforces existing disease eradication programs by providing technical and financial assistance, as well as logistics and tools, such as donated filter cloth material, larvicide, and medical kits.Donald G. McNeil, Jr., \"Dose of Tenacity Wears Down a Horrific Disease\", New York Times, March 26, 2006, accessed February 2, 2014. The International Task Force for Disease Eradication has been based at The Carter Center since its formation in 1988. The group has reviewed more than 100 infectious diseases and identified six as potentially eradicable \u2013 dracunculiasis, poliomyelitis, mumps, rubella, lymphatic filariasis, and cysticercosis. ===Implementing disease control and treatment measures=== Since 1996, the Center has been a leader in the fight against onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness \u2013 a parasitic disease transmitted by the bites of black flies. The Center has worked to stop the spread of the disease in 11 countries across Africa and the Americas by helping residents and local health workers institute and sustain drug treatment programs and health education activities. The international river blindness campaign seeks to eliminate the disease from the Western Hemisphere by 2015.\"Pan American Health Organization Passes Resolution to Interrupt Transmission of River Blindness in Latin America by 2012\", , accessed on November 4, 2009. The Center has distributed more than 125 million doses of Mectizan (ivermectin) \u2013 a drug donated by Merck & Co., Inc., that treats and prevents river blindness. Center health workers also prevent transmission of trachoma \u2013 a bacterial infection that is the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Trachoma is prevalent in places that lack the tools for basic hygiene, clean water, and adequate sanitation. The Center follows the World Health Organization\u2019s four-pronged approach \u2013 called the SAFE strategy \u2013 to fight trachoma in six African countries.Paul M. Emerson, Matthew Burton, Anthony W. Solomon, Robin Bailey, & David Mabey, \"The SAFE strategy for trachoma control: using operational research for policy, planning and implementation\", WHO, August 2006, accessed December 19, 2008. The Trachoma Control Program is working to improve sanitation in those communities by building latrines, providing corrective surgery, distributing antibiotics, and educating communities on basic hygiene. , The Carter Center has helped to build more than one million latrines in its effort to fight trachoma. The latrines contain human waste, preventing it from serving as a breeding ground for the disease-carrying flies, thereby reducing one way the disease is spread.Mark Bixler, \"Latrine program a hit: project deals with health, gender\", Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 5, 2005, accessed December 19, 2008. Lymphatic filariasis and malaria are mosquito-borne diseases also targeted by The Carter Center. The Center has distributed four million long-lasting insecticidal bed nets. It has also established drug distribution systems in Nigeria to treat and stem the spread of lymphatic filariasis and schistosomiasis.Carter Center, \"New Malaria Program Blankets Areas of Ethiopia with Bed Nets\", Carter Center News, June 12, 2007, accessed December 19, 2008. ===Training public health workers=== The Carter Center believes in building networks of village-based health care workers to treat people for various diseases at the same time. Emphasis is on helping national and local governments establish programs that they can sustain into the future. Since 1997, the Center established with the Ethiopian ministries of health and education the Ethiopia Public Health Training Initiative to improve academic training for health care personnel in Ethiopia and increase access to health care in rural communities throughout the country. ===Strengthening agricultural production=== In partnership with the Sasakawa Africa Association, the Center has worked since 1986 in 15 sub-Saharan African countries to teach 8-10 million small-scale farmers improved techniques that double or triple their crop yields.Sasakawa Africa Association, , accessed on December 19, 2008. The program promotes use of fertilizers and crop protection chemicals, soil fertility, and environmentally friendly agronomic methods of crop production. It also supports efforts to construct quality grain storage to sustain market prices for the farmer and ensure greater food security, establish farmers' associations, and use quality food crops such as high- protein maize. ===Reducing stigma of mental illness=== Rosalynn Carter leads the Center\u2019s efforts to fight stigma associated with mental illness. The Center works to improve U.S. public policies that can help prevent mental illnesses and increase equity in mental health care, holding an annual symposium with national leaders in mental health and other fields. The Center also seeks to raise public awareness of mental health issues globally through the Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism, which enable journalists to explore mental health issues. To date, more than 100 journalists have participated in the program.\"The Carter Center Awards 2009-2010 Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism\", , accessed on November 4, 2009. ==Accolades== Mr. Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work through The Carter Center. The Carter Center received the inaugural Delta Prize for Global Understanding in 1999 \u2013 an award administered by the University of Georgia.\"1999 Delta Prize Announcement: The Carter Center\" , April 27, 1999, accessed December 19, 2008. In 2006, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation presented The Carter Center with the Gates Award for Global Health.\"2006 Gates Award for Global Health: The Carter Center\" , 2006, accessed December 19, 2008. The center was awarded Hamdan Award for Volunteers in Humanitarian Medical Services for 2013-14. ===Annual auction=== The center holds an annual auction, which raised $1.6 million in 2013. == Controversy == === Alleged funding-based bias === Alan Dershowitz asserts that the Center's focus \"is away from significant Arab abuses and on Israel's far less serious ones\" and that this is influenced by the Center's receipt of donations from Arab sources.Alan M. Dershowitz, Ex-President for Sale, StandWithUs. One of the initial contributors to the Center was Bank of Commerce and Credit International founder Agha Hasan Abedi, who donated $500,000. Abedi and BCCI also donated $8 million to Carter's Global 2000 project. According to the Center, 3 percent of the total amount of contributions it has received since its founding in 1982 have been from donors in Mideast Arab nations.Background on the Carter Center's Middle East Funding, last accessed November 4, 2009 Of the donations from the Middle East, the Center states: \"Seventy-eight percent of those funds have helped to support health programs in Africa, 14 percent have gone to the institution's endowment, 4 percent were for original construction of buildings at headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, and 4 percent for projects to directly promote peace, such as specific election observations. === Venezuelan election === Some individuals have disputed the Center\u2019s endorsement of the electoral process in the Venezuelan recall referendum of 2004.J. Michael Waller, Occasional Papers 6 Center for Security Policy May 2005, accessed December 19, 2008. Fox News' Doug Schoen told Michael Barone of U.S. News and World Report, \"Our internal sourcing tells us that there was fraud in the Venezuelan central commission. There are widespread reports of irregularities and evidence of fraud, many of them ably recorded by Mary Anastasia O'Grady in The Wall Street Journal last week. Carter is untroubled by any of this, and declares that Chavez won 'fair and square.'\"The National Interest: Exit polls in Venezuela, U.S. News and World Report (8/20/04) The Carter Center looked into the allegations and released a paper and statistical analysis reaffirming their original conclusions.Carter Center, 17 September 2004, Report on an Analysis of the Representativeness of the Second Audit Sample, and the Correlation between Petition Signers and the Yes Vote in the Aug. 15, 2004 Presidential Recall Referendum in Venezuela, accessed 20 February 2010 ==See also== * List of non-governmental organizations in the People's Republic of China * Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid ==Notes== ==External links== * The Carter Center's website * The Jimmy Carter Library and Museum's website Category:Buildings and monuments honoring American Presidents in the United States Category:Development charities based in the United States Category:International medical and health organizations Category:International human rights organizations Category:Jimmy Carter Category:Charities based in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Public health organizations Category:Rosalynn Carter ",
