    "text": "The BHP Nevada Railroad was a shortline railroad that operated in Nevada from 1996 to 1999. BHP acquired the line from the Northern Nevada Railway. The railroad hauled copper ore concentrate from BHP's concentrator at Riepetown to Shafter, Nevada. At Shafter the railroad interchanged with the Union Pacific and the ore continued to BHP's smelter at San Manuel, Arizona. BHP is an Australian-based company that took over Magma Copper, the owner of the Robinson Mine at Ruth, Nevada, in January 1996. The line ran south from a connection with the Union Pacific at Shafter to Ely. ==Locomotives== The BHP Nevada Railroad used five former Southern Pacific Railroad EMD SD9 locomotives built between 1954 and 1956 to operate over the line. They were numbered #201 \u2013 205. For switching and local operations the railroad used two GE 70-ton switchers from the Santa Maria Valley Railroad. BHP also had one ALCO RS-3. The switchers were also built in the 1950s and numbered #12 and #13. ==Nevada Northern Railway Museum== Passenger train at the East Ely depot (September 29, 2007). BHP ended up turning over its locomotives and rolling stock to the Nevada Northern Railway Museum as part of a settlement over their track lease agreement. A small portion of the BHP Nevada Railroad was operated over the Nevada Northern Railway Museum tracks with trackage rights between East Ely and Ruth. The line was abandoned in 1999 when copper mining was discontinued, however in 2004 the mines were reopened, and the copper concentrate was hauled by road. The disused line between Ely and Cobre was acquired by the city of Ely in 2006. ==Route== Stations, listed from north to south: *Shafter, Nevada (connection with the Union Pacific Railroad, former Western Pacific) *Decoy *Dolly Varden *Mizpah *Currie *Goshute *Greens *Cherry Creek *Schellbourne (Ray) *Requa (Raiff) *Warm Springs *Steptoe *Glenn *McGill Junction *J&M; Spur *Hiline Junction (Hi Line Junction) *Mosier *East Ely *Ore Yard *Calumet *Tunnel 1 *Lane *Keystone *Lone Tree Road *Ruth *Sunshine *Tripp Pit *Riepetown ==See also== *List of defunct Nevada railroads ==References== ==Other sources== * * * * Category:Defunct Nevada railroads Category:Mining in Nevada Category:Mining railways in the United States Category:1996 establishments in Nevada Category:1999 disestablishments in Nevada Category:Railway companies established in 1996 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1999 ",
