    "text": "{| |} Landing Craft Gun (LCG) was a landing craft used extensively in World War II, present for both the Normandy landings (Operation Neptune), on D Day and also the invasion of Allied invasion of Sicily-Salerno- Anzio. Its primary purpose was to provide direct fire against beach positions and surface attack for first-echelon landing waves. The LCG was then typically beached to become a stationary gun platform. The craft was developed from the Landing Craft Tank (LCT) vessel, derived from a prototype designed by John Thornycroft Ltd. of Woolston, Hampshire, in the UK. In addition to the 20mm Oerlikon armament of a normal LCT, each LCG (Medium) had two British Army 25-pounder gun-howitzers in armoured mountings, while both LCG(L) 3 and LCG(L) had two BL 4.7-inch (120 mm) naval guns The operation of the craft was the responsibility of RN crew and the guns were manned by Royal Marines. During the war it was manufactured throughout the United Kingdom in places as various as small boatyards and furniture manufacturers. LCGs played a very important part in the Walcheren operations in October 1944. ==Variants== *LCG (Medium) - 270 tons light, 2x 25-pdr or 17 pdr guns *LCG(L) Mark 3 - 500 tons loaded, 2x 4.7 inch guns *LCG(L) Mark 4 - 500 tons loaded, 2x 4.7 inch guns ==References== * Category:Landing craft Category:Ships of the Royal Navy ",
