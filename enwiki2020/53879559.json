    "text": "The RDS-2 (Russian: \u0420\u0414\u0421-2) was the second atomic bomb developed by the Soviet Union as an improved version of the RDS-1. It included new explosive lenses along with a new core design to decrease the probability of pre-detonation or 'fizzle'. The RDS-2 weighed approximately 3200 kg and had a diameter of 1.25 m. The RDS-2 was tested on September 24, 1951 and produced a 38.3 kiloton yield. It was detonated from the top of a tower thirty meters high. The detonation was controlled by a bomber flying over the testing site instead of the detonation being controlled by a ground control center. ==See also== *Soviet atomic bomb project *RDS-1 *RDS-3 == Notes == == References == === Citations === === Bibliography === * * * * * Category:Nuclear weapons of the Soviet Union Category:Soviet nuclear weapons testing Category:Nuclear bombs of the Soviet Union Category:1951 in the Soviet Union Category:Nuclear weapons policy Category:Nuclear proliferation Category:1951 in military history ",
