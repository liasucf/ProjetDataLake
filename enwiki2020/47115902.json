    "text": "Bostrychus microphthalmus is a species of fish from the family Butidae. It is endemic to Maros karst in the South Sulawesi region of Sulawesi, Indonesia. It was the first documented cave-dwelling fish in Sulawesi, but since then the brotula Diancistrus typhlops has been described from nearby Muna Island, and an additional apparently undescribed eleotrid is known from Sulawesi's Maros karst. The specific name of B. microphthalmus refers to the small eyes of this fish. ==Description== Bostrychus microphthalmus grow to SL. The head is flat on top and the trunk region is elongate. It differs from other Bostrychus species by having reduced eyes covered with skin and reduced head canal development, body pigment, and head squamation. ==Habitat== The species is a cave dweller that is usually found in backwaters, lying on clay bottom. ==References== Category:Butidae Category:Cave fish Category:Endemic fauna of Indonesia Category:Freshwater fish of Indonesia Category:Fauna of Sulawesi ",
