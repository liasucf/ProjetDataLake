The municipality covered an area of 216 km\u00b2, and had a total population of 5,786 (2005). Its last mayor was Ejner Fr\u00f8kj\u00e6r, a member of the Social Democrats (Socialdemokraterne) political party. The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Hanstholm. Hanstholm municipality ceased to exist as the result of Kommunalreformen (\"The Municipality Reform\" of 2007), being merged with Thisted and Sydthy municipalities to form the new Thisted municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 1,072 km\u00b2 and a total population of 46,158 (2005). The new municipality belongs to Region Nordjylland (\"North Jutland Region\"). == References == ==External links== * Thisted municipality's official website * National bicycle route Hanstholm-Copenhagen Category:Former municipalities of Denmark ",
