The collection includes five Namco arcade games from the 1980s, alongside an exclusive Xevious sequel, Xevious Resurrection. Player progress is rewarded with stamps, which could be redeemed for virtual items in the now-defunct PlayStation Home service. Stamps also award points when collected, used to unlock extra features such as wallpapers. The \".comm\" in the game's Japanese title is thought to stand for \"community\", based on the game's online functionality. To help promote the game, Namco Bandai set up a custom PlayStation Home hub space featuring a demo of the game. Upon release, Namco Museum Essentials was met with a mixed to positive reception from critics; although it was criticized for its small game library and lack of multiplayer in most of the games, reviewers praised the emulation quality, unlockable extras and presentation. It was removed from the PlayStation Store on March 15, 2018. ==Games== PlayStation 3 version screenshot. Namco Museum Essentials consists of six games - five of these are Namco arcade games from the 1980s, while the sixth, Xevious Resurrection, is exclusive to this collection. The arcade games allow the player to start on any stage the player had previously been to, as well as featuring a score attack mode where the player is to gain as many points possible before dying. In-game options allow the player to change the number of lives and border artwork. Multiplayer is excluded from each game, with the exception of Xevious Resurrection. By completing certain objectives in each of the games, players are rewarded with stamps that were redeemable for items in the now-defunct PlayStation Home service, such as shirts, hats and arcade cabinets; the game includes over 50 unlockable items. Stamps also award points when unlocked, which can increase a player's account level; reaching new levels can also unlock items such as wallpapers. Online leaderboards are also present, allowing players to view scores from other users around the world as well as from friends. Players also have access to a sound test and the ability to record a friend's progress. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ |+Games included in Namco Museum Essentials |- !Title !Genre !Original release |- |Pac-Man |Maze |1980 |- |Galaga |Fixed shooter |1981 |- |Dig Dug |Maze |1982 |- |Xevious |Vertical-scrolling shooter |1983 |- |Dragon Spirit |Vertical-scrolling shooter |1987 |- |Xevious Resurrection |Vertical-scrolling shooter |2009 |} ==Development== Namco Museum Essentials was published by Namco Bandai Games for the PlayStation 3.
