    "text": "The Saint Dominic Cathedral, commonly referred to as the Bayombong Cathedral, is an 18th-century, Baroque church located at Brgy. Salvacion, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines. The cathedral, which is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bayombong, is under the patronage of Saint Dominic. Saint Dominic Cathedral of Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines was founded in 1739 by the Augustinian Friars of Spain. ==Church history== It was April 12, 1739 when the first Eucharistic Celebration was held there with Fray Pedro Freire presiding. During these days in the 18th century, this cathedral was still called The Church of St. Augustine. It won\u2019t be until a few months later, on September 8, that it will be dedicated to St. Dominic De Guzman. The mission in present-day Bayombong had its roots in the mid-18th century when it was formally accepted by the Dominicans as mission center in a region previously referred to as Paniqui. Soon after founding the mission, the erection of the church structure took place in 1780 under the supervision of Father Juan Crespo, OP. According to records, the church, and other nearby structures, was gutted by fire in 1892. Father Cerefino Martinez, O.P. initiated the reconstruction of the church. It was completed three years after, in 1895, with the installation of galvanized iron roofing, new altarpieces and a new pulpit. ==Architecture== The church fa\u00e7ade is described as a close copy of that of the Dupax del Sur Church and the Santa Catalina de Siena Church (Bambang) in Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya, with its doors, windows and oculus, not to mention the pediment shape that\u2019s also similar to that of the older Tuguegarao Cathedral in Cagayan province. A difference, however between this church and the two above-mentioned churches is the lack of columns framing the windows. The slightly-detached, octagonal campanile is also distinct to the church of Bayombong. The fa\u00e7ade, with its squat appearance, is divided into four sections by cornices. The fa\u00e7ade is ornamented with two windows on the second level (flanking a saint\u2019s niche) and an oculus on the third level. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Roman Catholic churches in Nueva Vizcaya Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in the Philippines Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1780 Category:18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Spanish Colonial architecture in the Philippines Category:Baroque architecture in the Philippines ",
