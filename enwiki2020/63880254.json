    "text": "Otterington Hall, behind the trees, 2008 Otterington Hall is a Grade II listed mansion in South Otterington, near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, England. Otterington Hall lies in South Otterington, three miles south of Northallerton, on the A167. It was home to the Furness family for many years, and they were responsible for planting much of its topiary gardens from the 1920s onwards, \"one of the best topiary gardens in England and certainly the best in Yorkshire\". It has been home to Andy Preston, the Mayor of Middlesbrough and a former hedge fund manager, and his wife since at least 2007. In 2015, Preston was criticised for using his parents' Middlesbrough address on his nomination papers, rather than that of his actual home, but he denied breaking election rules. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in North Yorkshire Category:Country houses in North Yorkshire Category:Grade II listed houses ",
