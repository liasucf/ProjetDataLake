Two sisters adopted her, and she had regular contact with her mother and grandmother but was not permitted to recognize them in those roles. She first learned her father's name during an audition when, after hearing her mother's and grandmother's names, the director said, \"Oh, you're Martin Walker's child.\" Phipps graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. ==Career== While in England, Phipps appeared in plays in London's West End. In the early 1960s she moved to Canada, where she worked for most of the rest of her career.
