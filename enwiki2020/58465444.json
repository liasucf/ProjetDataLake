Albert Skira wanted his firm to publish books in which \"the greatest of artists illustrate the best in literature\". For that reason Skira's first publications were a number of large scale artist's book editions. Skira: The Story, skira.net.

At that time Paris was an artistic centre and many of the great modern movements, such as Surrealism, were active there. To cater for this audience, Skira, in collaboration with the art critic, editor and publisher T\u00e9riade,T\u00e9riade, teriade8.wixsite.com.

Other major books published by Skira in the 1940s included Rabelais's Pantagruel (1943) (with \"vibrantly-coloured woodcuts\" by Andr\u00e9 Derain) and Malraux's Les Conqu\u00e9rants (1949) (with etchings by Andr\u00e9 Masson).

Skira published individual books on many areas of art, including histories, contemporary art, and decorative arts, from around the world, as well as large series of art books that were sold throughout Europe and North America.

Zwemmer Ltd., which had previously distributed Minotaure in the 1930s. The books were distributed in the USA and Canada by The World Publishing Company, Cleveland, Ohio, although for a brief time Editions d'Art Albert Skira had a subsidiary in New York City, Skira International Corporation, led by Henry Field, and Crown Publishers, Inc, New York handled them briefly in the early 1970s. === Editions d'Art Albert Skira Book Series of the 1950s and 1960s === With the success of the \"Les Tr\u00e9sors de la Peinture Fran\u00e7aise\" (1934-1952) and other series in France, Albert Skira planned and directed the publication of several ambitious series of books for an international market.

Time Magazine characterized Skira as a \"perfectionist\" for his opulent publications made for a high-end market. Many of the leading art historians, archaeologists, and intellectuals of the time were commissioned to write the books, providing authoritative text. Unlike the majority of art history books up to that time, which if illustrated at all, were illustrated in black and white, Editions d'Art Albert Skira books were profusely illustrated with high quality color reproductions \"tipped\" into each volume. At that time, one of the Skira series \"Painting, Color, History\",Painting, Colour, History (Skira) - Book Series List, publishinghistory.com.

They were sold in protective, plain cardboard slipcases with glossy illustrated dust jackets. The books were well constructed with embossed lettering on cloth or buckram covers, sturdy archival papers, and great attention to details. Most volumes in each collection were translated into multiple languages and available in French, English, and Italian editions, and often in German and Spanish \"according to the market and the demand of the distributors\". Skira was praised as a \"distinguished\" publisher with \"long lists of reputable, scholarly publications\" to its credit.John Nash, \"The line from Lascaux\", in: The Times Literary Supplement, 21 March 1980, Issue 4017, p.332. Albert Skira \"brought his high standards to a mass audience\" and along with the publications of just a few contemporaries (e.g. Cailler and Editions Tisn\u00e9; \u00c9ditions Mazenod; Harry N. Abrams, Inc) ) his books played a role in the development of the coffee table book as known today. In her study on \"the impact of Albert Skira in the post-war years on the art book\" Corisande stated \"It is because he was the creator that Albert Skira marked the history of the art book between 1950 and 1970, and established itself as a vital mediator between art and the public.\" Swiss literary critic Jean Starobinski said \"this man, who had the absolute eye, helped to make history.\" Starobinski, Jean (1968) Albert Skira, 40 ans d\u2019\u00e9dition, in Salut \u00e0 Albert Skira, Gen\u00e8ve, Revue de Belles-Lettres, 26 p.
