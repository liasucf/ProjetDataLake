    "text": "Thomas M Chambers was a Canadian international lawn bowls player who competed in the 1930 British Empire Games for Scotland. ==Bowls career== At the 1930 British Empire Games he won the bronze medal in the rinks (fours) event with David Fraser, John Orr and William Campbell. Bizarrely, he won the medal for Scotland despite being Canadian because John Kennedy, a member of the Scottish rinks team, had died in the United States en route to Canada. The other teams agreed that Chambers could be a substitute even though he was not Scottish. ==References== Category:Canadian male bowls players Category:Scottish male bowls players Category:Bowls players at the 1930 British Empire Games Category:Commonwealth Games bronze medallists for Scotland Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in lawn bowls ",
