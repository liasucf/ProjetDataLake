Smotrich is a co-sponsor of proposed legislation change stating that sources of Jewish religious tradition such as the Torah have to be considered when dealing with legal matters that cannot be decided by legislation or court rulings. Other sponsors of this legislation are Miki Zohar from Likud, Yoav Ben-Tzur from Shas, and Nissan Slomiansky from The Jewish Home.What Islamic State and One Member of Knesset Share Haaretz, 6 September 2015 In June 2019, Smotrich campaigned for the Ministry of Justice, saying that he sought the portfolio to \"restore the Torah justice system\". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu distanced himself from the comments and appointed openly gay MK Amir Ohana to the post. According to Channel 13, Smotrich subsequently requested the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, but was not granted the position due to fears that he would strain ties between Israel and the Jewish diaspora. ====Legislation==== Smotrich initiated the following legislation which passed in the Knesset: * In addition to government ministers and Knesset members; judges, senior military personnel, and police officers would also have to declare their capital every six years. ==Controversy== ===Proposal for separation of Jews and Arabs=== In July 2015, Smotrich caused controversy by declaring in a Knesset Interior meeting that developers in Israel should not have to sell homes to Arabs. The meeting took place following accusations that Galil Homes refused to sell homes to Arabs in Ma'alot, a northern Israeli town. Smotrich defended the developer, saying that, \"Anyone who wants to protect the Jewish People and opposes mixed marriages is not a racist. Whoever wants to let Jews live a Jewish life without non-Jews is not a racist.\" He added that Jews are the ones deprived in Israel because \"they don't get free land in the Negev\", a reference to Bedouin. \"I believe in God's words. I prefer that Jews make a living and wouldn't sell a house to Arabs.\"Bayit Yehudi MK: God commanded Jews not to sell homes to Arabs Jerusalem Post, 16 July 2015 ===Anti-homosexual position=== Smotrich opposes gay marriage, and says that he wants to \u201cpromote the traditional family.\u201d In 2006, Smotrich helped organize a \"beast parade\" in opposition to the Jerusalem gay pride parade. In 2015, he referred to homosexual people as \"abnormal\", stating: \"At home, everyone can be abnormal, and people can form whatever family unit they want. But they can't make demands from me, as the state.\" In the same discussion, he told the audience: \"I am a proud homophobe.\" He later apologized, and retracted his statement, saying: \"Someone shouted from the crowd, and I responded inattentively.\" In July 2015, after a fatal stabbing attack on the Jerusalem gay pride parade, he referred to the march as an \"abomination\" and a \"beast parade\". The following month, Smotrich accused LGBT organizations of controlling the media and silencing those who share his conservative views. An Israeli NGO, \"Ometz\", filed a complaint to the Knesset Ethics Committee to intervene and investigate Smotrich's comments. ===Hospital room segregation between Jews and Arabs=== In April 2016, Bezalel Smotrich tweeted that he supports segregation of Arab and Jewish women in hospital's maternity wards: \"It is natural that my wife would not want to lay down next to someone who just gave birth to a baby that might want to murder her baby in another 20 years.\"Jonathan Lis,'Israeli Lawmaker: My Wife Wouldn't Want to Give Birth Next to an Arab Woman,' Haaretz 5 April 2016 The tweets were condemned by several Israeli politicians, including opposition leader Isaac Herzog and Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennett. ===Calling Reform Judaism a \u2018fake religion\u2019=== In July 2016, Smotrich stated he was \u201cnot willing to recognize Reform conversions and their fake religion.\u201d The comment came following the passing of a Knesset bill permitting local religious authorities to bar non-Orthodox from using public mikvahs for conversion ceremonies, which countered a Supreme Court ruling to the contrary. ===Stone-throwing and terrorism=== Smotrich has advocated a shoot-to-kill policy for the military when they deal with Palestinians throwing stones. Asked what he would do were another intifada to arise, and a Palestinian child were to throw stones, he replied: \"Either I will shoot him, or I will jail him, or I will expel him.\"Ravit Hecht, He wants the Israeli military to be able to shoot to kill when children throw stones Haaretz 3 December 2016Emma Graham-Harrison, 'Bezalel Smotrich: Israel\u2019s far-right demagogue, drawing fringe beliefs to the centre,' The Guardian 12 March 2017. Smotrich has argued that price tag assaults on Palestinian people or property, while criminal in nature, are not to be classified as examples of terrorism, which he defined as \"only violence carried out by an enemy within the framework of war against us\". Commenting on a specific case, the Duma arson attack, in which a Palestinian family of 3 were killed, and for which a Jewish settler has been indicted, Smotrich stated that to brand such deeds as terrorism causes \"mortal and unjustified harm to human and civil rights\".'Habayit Hayehudi MK: The Duma Murders Are Not Terrorism,' Haaretz 10 December 2015. In April 2018, Smotrich tweeted that Ahed Tamimi, a 17-year-old Palestinian serving an eight-month jail sentence for assaulting a soldier, incitement, and interfering with a soldier in the line of duty, \"should have gotten a bullet, at least in the kneekap\". Twitter responded by suspending his account for 12 hours and asking him to delete the tweet, saying that the tweet was \"abusive\" and could incite harassment. Smotrich refused to delete the tweet, saying that for Twitter, \"freedom of speech is reserved for just for one side of the political map\", and that he stood by his tweet. ===Turning Israel into a theocratic Halachic state=== In June 2019, while pushing to be appointed Justice minister (just after the previous Justice minister had been fired) Justice Smotrich stated \"We want the justice portfolio because we want to restore the Torah justice system,\" and that the country should aspire to run itself as \u201cin the days of King David.\" In August 2019, Smotrich stated, \u201cWe [Orthodox Jews] all would want the State of Israel to be run according to the Torah and Jewish law, it\u2019s just that we can\u2019t because there are people who think differently from us and we have to get along with them.\u201d The United Right (a political alliance of right-wing parties including The Jewish Home and Smotrich's Tkuma) referred to the negative reaction \"media lynching\", arguing that Smotrich \"emphasized that he cannot and isn\u2019t interested in forcing it on others.\" However, Smotrich had said \"The government makes decisions that affect us and impedes our liberties every day so it is simply about what decisions are in the public interest enough to justify coercion... We too can force our needs on others, provided we are convinced ourselves of the validity of our demands.\" ==Personal life== Smotrich is an Orthodox Jew and is married to Revital, with whom he has six children.
