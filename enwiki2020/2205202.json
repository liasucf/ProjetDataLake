    "text": "Derren Nesbitt (born Derren Michael Horwitz; 19 June 1935) is a British actor. Nesbitt's film career began in the late 1950s and he also appeared in numerous TV series in the late 1960s into the 1970s. He is well-remembered for his role as Major von Hapen in the 1968 film Where Eagles Dare. ==Acting career== Nesbitt's many television credits date back to the 1950s, including roles in The Adventures of Sir Lancelot, The Invisible Man, Man of the World, Danger Man, The Prisoner, Doctor Who, UFO, The Saint and Special Branch. He has also appeared in memorable roles in a number of movies, such as a predatory blackmailer of gay men in Victim (1961), a murderous pimp in The Informers (1963), a slimy assassin in Nobody Runs Forever, and the suspicious Gestapo officer in Where Eagles Dare (1968). Nesbitt was keen to be as authentic as possible with his character in Where Eagles Dare. Whilst on location, he requested to meet a former member of the Gestapo to better understand how to play the character and to get the military regalia correct. He was injured on set whilst filming the scene in which his character is killed. The blood squib attached to Nesbitt exploded with such force that he was temporarily blinded, though he made a quick recovery.A Conversation with Derren Nesbitt. \"Major von Hapen\" in \"Where Eagles Dare\".
