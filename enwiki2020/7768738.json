Jarka was the Chief Security's Officer of Barclay's Bank in Freetown before the 1999 invasion of Freetown by the Revolutionary United Front rebel group during the recent civil war. During the war, his arms were forcibly amputated after he refused to give his daughter to the troops. After the war ended in 2002, Jarka set up the AWWA principally among the injured that live in a camp in the Murray Town section of Freetown but also as a nationwide organization. ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Sierra Leonean activists Category:Sierra_Leonean _amputees Category:Disability rights activists ",
