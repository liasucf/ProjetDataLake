Jane Digby was his sister. He was commissioned a captain in the Dorsetshire Yeomanry on 12 November 1848. On 12 May 1856 he succeeded as ninth Baron Digby (in the Peerage of Ireland) and third Baron Digby (in the Peerage of Great Britain) on the death of his first cousin once removed, Edward Digby, 2nd Earl Digby (on whose death the earldom became extinct), and was able to take a seat in the House of Lords. On 26 July 1856, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the Yeomanry, and on 19 July 1866, succeeded Lord Rivers as lieutenant-colonel commandant of the regiment. He resigned the command in 1870. Lord Digby married his third cousin Lady Theresa Anna Maria Fox-Strangways, daughter of Henry Fox-Strangways, 3rd Earl of Ilchester, in 1837. He died in October 1889, aged 80, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son Edward Henry Trafalgar Digby. Lord Digby's great- granddaughter was the Hon.
