The son of a district court councillor, he first went to Bromberg (modern Bydgoszcz) in 1834, and from 1846 to 1850 studied Philology and History in Heidelberg, Berlin, and Halle. After tours in Switzerland and Italy, he moved to in Berlin in 1852. He became a teacher in Dresden in 1853. He returned to Berlin in 1857 and in 1862 became a professor of literary history at the War Academy until he changed to the Vocational Academy (now the Berlin Institute of Technology) in 1867. In 1868 he joined the Vandalia-Teutonia Berlin. From 1869 he taught at the Polytechnic in Darmstadt (now TU Darmstadt). In 1893 he was named to the Geheimrat. Roquette befriended the German author Paul Heyse and, like Heyse, was a member of the literary group \"R\u00fctli\". Roquette's pseudo-romantic and epigonic lyric poetry and his fairy tale-laden epic verse is representative of Butzenscheibenlyric. From 1850 on, his works were extremely popular and especially beloved in conservative circles. His fashionable post-revolution poetry was a deliberate departure from the politically tinged verse of the pre-March era. His celebrated verse-epic on themes of love, wine, and youth, Waldmeisters Brautfahrt, first appeared in 1851 and enjoyed sensational success for a book at that time \u2013 appearing in more than 50 editions over thirty years. Roquette's work was popular with some Lieder composers. His 1851 poem Noch ist die bl\u00fchende, goldene Zeit was fit to a well-known folk tune in 1863 by musician Wilhelm Baumgartner. Roquette was also a novelist, playwright, literary historian and autobiographer. Roquette died in Darmstadt. Later generations found Roquette's work to be predominantly shallow and of little artistic value, and it is virtually forgotten today. == Works == * 1850: Walpurgis * 1851: Orion * 1851: Waldmeisters Brautfahrt (Verse-Epic) * 1852: Liederbuch (under the title \"Poems\" 1859) * 1852: Der Tag von St. Jakob * 1853: Das Reich der Tr\u00e4ume * 1854: Herr Heinrich * 1855: Haus Haidekuckuck (Verse-Epic) * 1855: Das H\u00fcnengrab * 1858: Heinrich Falk (Novel) * 1959: Erz\u00e4hlungen * 1860: Leben und Dichten Johann Christian G\u00fcnther's (Scholarly work, biography) * 1862: Neue Erz\u00e4hlungen * 1864: Susanne * 1866: Die Legende von der heiligen Elisabeth (Libretto to an Oratorio by Franz Liszt) * 1867: Luginsland * 1867: Pierrot * 1867\u201376: Dramatische Dichtungen * 1868: Krachmost * 1869: Das Paradies * 1870: Novellen * 1871\u201375: Welt und Haus (Novella) * 1873: Gevatter Tod * 1873: Rhampsinit * 1873: Die Schlangenk\u00f6nigin * 1877: Euphrosyne (Novel) * 1878: Das Buchstabirbuch der Leidenschaft (Novel) * 1878: Im Hause der V\u00e4ter (Novel) * 1879: Geschichte der Deutschen Dichtung von den \u00e4ltesten Denkm\u00e4lern bis auf die Neuzeit (Scholarly work, literary History) * 1879: Die Prophetenschule (Novel) * 1883: Friedrich Preller * 1884: Neues Novellenbuch * 1884: Das Haus Eberhard * 1884: Unterwegs * 1884: Tage des Waldlebens * 1884: Baum im Odenwald * 1887: Gro\u00dfe und kleine Leute in Alt- Weimar * 1890: Fr\u00fchlingsstimmen * 1890: Des Lebens Mummenschanz * 1892: Ul von Haslach * 1894: Siebzig Jahre (Autobiography) * 1895: Sonderlinge * 1896: Krethi und Plethi * 1896: Von Tag zu Tage (posthumous) == References == *Ludwig Julius Fr\u00e4nkel: Roquette, Otto.
