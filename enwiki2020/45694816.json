The school changed its location on March, 2010 since the student population grew to 39 students and the facility no longer provided the necessary space for the development of the school.

It was determined that the QSI Dushanbe community would be best served by leasing the available adjacent building located at 107 Sovetskaya Street (building 2). In March 2011, the preschool, five-year-old and nine and ten-year-old classes moved to the new building. The art classroom was expanded, giving teachers and students more space to explore and create. In addition, a two-year-old program and after-school daycare program were initiated. A security grant was awarded to provide bars on the windows and hire additional guards. At the start of the 2013-2014 school year, the school passed an annual safety inspection by professional engineers from the U.S. Embassy. An extra computer lab for secondary education purposes was added in 2013. The school Director is currently looking at one of the neighboring buildings with plans to attach it to the school. The school must accommodate to the various needs of the growing student body with the ultimate goal of building a new purpose-built facility.QSI Dushanbe Accreditation Reports == Information Resources and Technology == thumb The QSI Dushanbe was established in 2004.
