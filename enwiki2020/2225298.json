    "text": "Killer is the fourth studio album by the Alice Cooper band, released in November 1971. The album reached number 21 on the Billboard 200 album chart, and the two singles \"Under My Wheels\" and \"Be My Lover\" made the Billboard Hot 100 chart. == Songs == Cooper said in the liner notes of A Fistful of Alice and In the Studio with Redbeard, which spotlighted the Killer and Love It to Death albums, that the song \"Desperado\" was written about his friend Jim Morrison, who died the year this album was released. According to an NPR radio interview with Alice Cooper, \"Desperado\" was written about Robert Vaughn's character from the movie The Magnificent Seven. \"Halo of Flies\" was, according to Cooper's liner notes in the compilation The Definitive Alice Cooper, an attempt by the band to prove that they could perform King Crimson-like progressive rock suites, and was supposedly about a SMERSH-like organisation. \"Desperado\", along with \"Under My Wheels\" and \"Be My Lover\" have appeared on different compilation albums by Cooper. The song \"Dead Babies\" stirred up some controversy following the album's release, despite the fact that its lyrics conveyed an \"anti-child abuse\" message. ==Reception== === Critical reception === Rolling Stone's Lester Bangs gave it a favorable review. He explained that \"it brings all the elements of the band's approach to sound and texture to a totally integrated pinnacle that fulfills all the promise of their erratic first two albums\" and that \"each song on [the] album finds him in a different role in the endless movie he is projecting on them.\" He concluded by calling Alice Cooper \"a strong band, a vital band, and they are going to be around for a long, long time.\" Robert Christgau rated the album a B-, stating that \"a taste for the base usages of hard rock rarely comes with a hit attached these days, much less 'surreal', 'theatrical', and let us not forget 'transvestite' trappings\". However, he said that \"[the album] falters after 'Under My Wheels' and 'Be My Lover', neither of them an 'I'm Eighteen' in the human outreach department.\" AllMusic's Greg Prato rated \"Killer\" four-and-a-half out of five stars. He stated that \"disturbing tracks ... fit in perfectly\" and that \"other songs were even more exceptional\". He concluded by pointing out that \"it rewarded them as being among the most notorious and misunderstood entertainers, thoroughly despised by grownups.\" === Charts === The album reached on the Billboard album chart and two singles made the Hot 100 chart. \"Be My Lover\" reached on the Billboard chart and \"Under My Wheels\" reached . ===Live performances=== Killer is the third-most-represented album in Alice Cooper\u2019s concert setlists behind Welcome to My Nightmare and Billion Dollar Babies, accounting for 13.3 percent of the songs he has played live. Alongside Welcome to My Nightmare, it is one of only two Alice Cooper albums where every song has been played live, although \u201cYeah, Yeah, Yeah\u201d has never been played since the end of the supporting Killer Tour, while \u201cYou Drive Me Nervous\u201d was not played subsequent to the Killer Tour until 1999, and has never been performed since 2006. \u201cDesperado\u201d was performed only once prior to the Trash Tour in 1989, but has been frequently played live since. === Influence === Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd called Killer the greatest rock album of all time.Lydon, John.
