    "text": "Andrew Lawrence Fortier (born July 14, 1987) is an American musician, guitarist, filmmaker, actor, and author. He is best known for his work with Bang Tango, Stephen Shareaux, and Zen From Mars; which he cofounded, and includes members of Kik Tracee, Enuff Z'Nuff, Flipp, and Fear Factory. He was guitarist for the now late Chuck Mosley (Faith No More). He has directed and edited the documentary Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie as well as the upcoming David Ellefson produced horror film Dwellers which Fortier also wrote and stars in. He is the author of Dark, Depressing, and Hilarious which is an autobiography on his career thus far. == Film career == === Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie === Fortier took 4 years filming and editing what would become a documentary on 80's hard rock band Bang Tango. Originally intended as a studio documentary, the film became expanded upon once original members of the band became involved and more information was revealed regarding the band's history. The film was never given an official release due to clearance issues regarding usage of Bang Tango's back catalogue of music in the film which is owned by Universal Music. Aside from the inclusion of various members of Bang Tango throughout the band's career up to that point, interviews featured throughout the film include: Howard Benson, Riki Rachtman, Chris DeMakes, Mandy Lion, Andrew Wilkow, Chip Z'Nuff, as well as an opening narration by Twisted Sister's Dee Snider. The film had one free public screening in Fortier's hometown of Chicago, Illinois with Bang Tango in attendance in April 2015. Fortier became a member of Bang Tango days later as the band's second guitarist. Fortier released the film for free on YouTube in early 2016. In June 2018, Fortier released an 11 minute deleted/extended scene from the film, which contained footage from being on the road with the band as well as more insight into how the band operates while on tour. Fortier made note that the footage was initially removed from the film due to its portrayal of the band members featured in the scenes. ==== Reception ==== Reviews of the film were positive. The general consensus is that despite its low budget, the film still manages to get its point across in an unbiased, artistic, and engaging manner while being able to appeal to not only fans of the band or genre, but to anyone not familiar with Bang Tango. === Thanks. And Sorry: The Chuck Mosley Movie === Summer 2017, Fortier was recruited as guitarist for (Ex-Faith No More frontman) Chuck Mosley's solo band. During his time with the band, Fortier and Mosley explored the idea of a potential documentary to where Mosley would be the subject. Prior to his passing in November 2017 Mosley confirmed with Fortier that a documentary about his life should be made. The film is being produced by Mosley's long time manager and percussionist, Douglas Esper. In February 2018 it was announced that Thanks. And Sorry: The Chuck Mosley Movie was officially in production with a TBA release date. === Dwellers === In May 2019, it was announced that Fortier will be writing, directing, and starring in the found footage horror film Dwellers which is being produced by Megadeth bassist David Ellefson and Thom Hazaert via their newly formed production company Ellefson Films. Along with Fortier, the film will also star James L. Edwards, Douglas Esper, Rick Jermain, and Jeff Hatrix. Ellefson and Hazaert will also be appearing in the film as featured cameos. In August 2019, Ellefson Films released a 50 second teaser for the film which included a voice over from Canadian radio personality Mitch Lafon. Ellefson Films hosted a Q&A; panel at Rue Morgue's Frightmare in the Falls horror convention where Fortier and Ellefson revealed that the film will be a gritty found footage horror film that plays out as a documentary gone horribly wrong. Dwellers is described as being highly influenced by The Blair Witch Project and C.H.U.D. The full trailer for Dwellers was released via Ellefson Films in November 2019. === Other works === As a way to hone his filmmaking skills to aid the process of creating and completing Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie, Fortier experimented with shooting and editing music videos for Bang Tango, which resulted in clips for their songs: Live Life, I Like It, Bring on the World, and Suck It Up from the Pistol Whipped in the Bible Belt album. This led to Fortier, through word of mouth, being hired to produce and edit promotional videos for such acts as: Vince Neil, Slaughter, Queensr\u00ffche, Great White, Kix, Autograph, Lynch Mob, Vixen, Marty Casey, Les Warner, David Ellefson, Mark Slaughter, Jesse Camp, Doll Skin, A Killer's Confession, and more. After completing Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie, Fortier was in talks with Fear Factory for a proposed documentary on the band's career. A treatment for the film was drafted which led to meeting with members of the band to speak further about the idea. It was ultimately decided that due to the band's ongoing litigation with former members, it was not the right time for a film to be made. == Music career == === Bang Tango === After completing and screening Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie in April 2015, Fortier would go on to join the film's subject, Bang Tango, as their second guitarist making his live debut with the band at the 2015 edition of the M3 Festival in Maryland. The decision to bring Fortier into the band was at the suggestion of Rowan Robertson who, as Bang Tango's lead guitarist, felt the band should be represented as having two guitarists to properly perform the material which was originally written and recorded with two guitarists. Despite having Fortier become a member of the band, frontman Joe Leste' showed disdain toward Fortier in the press regarding the way Leste' had been portrayed in the film. Fortier took a year long break performing with the band to work for Megadeth Bassist David Ellefson's EMP Label Group as their Operations Coordinator. Fortier worked closely with Ellefson and the label's Operations Director Thom Hazaert up until he returned to Bang Tango in August 2017. === Stephen Shareaux === Mid 2015, Fortier began performing acoustic shows with Kik Tracee vocalist Stephen Shareaux. This would mark the first time Kik Tracee material had been performed live in over 20 years. Notable appearances include a one off full band appearance as support for the debut of Mark Slaughter's solo band in New Jersey as well as performing at Megadeth bassist David Ellefson's Ellefson Coffee Co. Grand Opening in Jackson, MN for which Fortier also performed an impromptu acoustic mini set of Megadeth songs with Ellefson on bass and Thom Hazaert on vocals. Fortier and Shareaux would go on to form the alternative rock band Zen From Mars. === Chuck Mosley === Fortier joined Chuck Mosley's solo band early summer 2017. It was during this time that plans for a documentary on Mosley's life were discussed which would become Thanks. And Sorry: The Chuck Mosley Movie. === Zen From Mars === Summer 2015, Fortier began demoing songs for what was intended to be Bang Tango's next studio album. Due to the songs departure from the typical Bang Tango sound, Fortier decided to put a new band together to finish writing and recording for an album release. Fortier, along with Kik Tracee vocalist Stephen Shareaux, then formed Zen From Mars. The rest of the band featured on the album include: bassist Chip Z'nuff (Enuff Z'Nuff), drummer Mike Heller (Fear Factory, Malignancy, Raven), guitarist Brynn Arens (Flipp), and pianist Kate Catalina. August 2016, the band released a short video titled Who is ZFM? which teased the identities of the band members which led to the release of a music video featuring an early demo version of the song New Leaf which was mixed by Matt Wallace. September 2016 the band released a clip of a finished song titled Aflame. Their debut album, The Ultra Head Frequency, is currently being mixed and mastered by Richard Easterling for a TBA release date. === Other works === In 2011, while shooting Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie and 4 years prior to joining the band, Fortier performed additional guitar and backing vocals on Bang Tango's Pistol Whipped in the Bible Belt album. His lead guitar parts can be heard in the choruses of the track Live Life, and his backing vocals can be heard in the choruses of the song Boombox Seance. In June 2018, Fortier joined 90's hard rock band Flipp as their guitarist for a one off show in Minnesota. == Acting career == === Her Name Was Christa === July 2017, Fortier was cast as a lead role in the horror/comedy Her Name Was Christa. Directed by and starring James L. Edwards, the film is slated for a late 2018 release. Fortier will also be the lead in a forthcoming as of yet untitled horror anthology also directed by Edwards. == Writing career == === Dark, Depressing, and Hilarious === Fortier wrote an autobiography titled Dark, Depressing, and Hilarious which covers his career up until 2018. The book features a foreword by Thom Hazaert. == Personal life == Fortier currently resides in Indianapolis, Indiana with fianc\u00e9 Tharasa DiMeo, with whom he became engaged to on the set of Her Name Was Christa by having her cast as a featured extra sharing a scene with him so he was able to surprise her on camera with a ring and marriage proposal. == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable\" ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"33\"|Year ! rowspan=\"2\"|Title ! colspan=\"7\"|Credited as |- ! width=75 | Director ! width=75 | Producer ! width=75 | Editor ! width=75 | Writer ! width=75 | Actor ! width=155| Notes |- | 2015 | Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie | | | | | |rowspan=1| Documentary on Bang Tango |- | 2019 | Her Name Was Christa | | | | | |rowspan=1| Role: Nick |- | 2019 | Back Again | | | | | |rowspan=1| Role: The Assistant |- | 2019 | Dwellers | | | | | |rowspan=1| Role: Drew |- | TBA | Thanks.
