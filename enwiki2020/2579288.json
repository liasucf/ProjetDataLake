It was released on vinyl, cassette, and mini CD on May 1, 1989. It is coupled with the first Dragon Ball Z closing theme performed by Manna. The song opened for the first 199 episodes of the TV series and the first nine movies of the film series. It has been re-recorded in many other languages with an English version performed by Kageyama himself that was released on his third greatest hits album entitled Mixture in 1996. The single sold 1.3million copies in Japan. ==Development== Kageyama had been reading the Dragon Ball manga in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump for quite some time when he was offered the job to record the song. He stated that he was shocked when the offer came up. Kageyama considers the song to be his best work as people are always happy when he sings it. ==Track listing== ==2005 Recording== In 2005 Kageyama was called back to record a new version of \"Cha-La Head-Cha-La\" called \"Cha-La Head-Cha-La (2005 Ver.)\". This version features a completely different composition. The release is coupled with a re-recording of \"We Gotta Power\" called \"We Gotta Power (2005 Ver.)\" which Kageyama performed as well. A \"Self Cover\" version featuring Kageyama on cover was also released as an iTunes exclusive; however, it omits one track mislabelled as \"Cha-La Head-Cha-La (2005 ver. Instrumental)\", however, this version lacks the \"mobi[le-re]make version\". The 2005 recording would go on to serve as the theme song for Japanese release of the video game Super Dragon Ball Z four months later. This version would peak 118 on Oricon. ===Track listing=== # Cha-La Head-Cha-La (2005 ver.) # We Gotta Power (2005 ver.) # Cha-La Head-Cha-La (DJ Dr.Knob Remix) # We Gotta Power (Yuki Nakano Remix) # Cha-La Head-Cha-La (mobi[le-re]make version) # Cha-La Head-Cha-La (2005 ver.
