Often considered one of the greatest contributors to the divan tradition of Azerbaijani literature,\"Fuzuli, Mehmed bin S\u00fcleyman\" in Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Fuzuli in fact wrote his collected poems (divan) in three different languages: in his native Azerbaijani, Arabic and Persian.Peter Rollberg.

Weber. \u2014 Academic International Press, 1987. \u2014 Volume 8. \u2014 Page 76. In Mesopotamia Fuzuli was in intimate contact with three cultures \u2014 Turkic, Arabic, and Persian. Besides his native Azeri, he learned Arabic and Persian at an early age and acquired a through command of the literatures in all three languages, an accomplishment in which the cosmopolitan literary and scholarly circles of Hilla played an important role. He was well-versed in both the Ottoman and Chagatai Turkic literary traditions as well as mathematics and astronomy.\"Fozuli, Mohammad b. Solayman\" in Encyclopaedia Iranica ==Life== Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee is generally believed to have been born around 1480 in what is now Iraq, when the area was under Ak Koyunlu Turkmen rule; he was probably born in either Karbal\u0101\u2019 or an-Najaf. He is believed to belong to Bayat tribe, one of the Turkic Oghuz tribes who were related to the Ottoman Kay\u0131 clan and were scattered throughout the Middle East, Anatolia, and the Caucasus at the time. Though Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee's ancestors had been of nomadic origin, the family had long since settled in towns. Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee appears to have received a good education, first under his father\u2014who was a mufti in the city of Al Hillah\u2014and then under a teacher named Rahmetullah.\u015eent\u00fcrk 281 It was during this time that he learned the Persian and Arabic languages in addition to his native Azerbaijani. Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee showed poetic promise early in life, composing sometime around his twentieth year the important masnavi entitled Beng \u00fc B\u00e2de (\u0628\u0646\u06af \u0648 \u0628\u0627\u062f\u0647; \"Hashish and Wine\"), in which he compared the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II to hashish and the Safavid shah Ismail I to wine, much to the advantage of the latter. One of the few things that is known of Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee's life during this time is how he arrived at his pen name. In the introduction to his collected Persian poems, he says: \"In the early days when I was just beginning to write poetry, every few days I would set my heart on a particular pen name and then after a time change it for another because someone showed up who shared the same name\".Quoted in Andrews, 236. Eventually, he decided upon the Arabic word fuz\u00fbl\u00ee\u2014which literally means \"impertinent, improper, unnecessary\"\u2014because he \"knew that this title would not be acceptable to anyone else\".Ibid. Despite the name's pejorative meaning, however, it contains a double meaning\u2014what is called tevriyye (\u062a\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0647) in Ottoman Divan poetry\u2014as Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee himself explains: \"I was possessed of all the arts and sciences and found a pen name that also implies this sense since in the dictionary fuz\u00fbl (\ufed3\ufec0\ufeee\u0644) is given as a plural of fazl (\ufed3\ufec0\ufede; 'learning') and has the same rhythm as \u2018ul\u00fbm (\ufecb\ufee0\ufeee\u0645; 'sciences') and f\u00fcn\u00fbn (\ufed3\ufee8\ufeee\u0646; 'arts')\".Ibid. In 1534, the Ottoman sultan S\u00fcleym\u00e2n I conquered the region of Baghdad, where Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee lived, from the Safavid Empire. Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee now had the chance to become a court poet under the Ottoman patronage system, and he composed a number of kas\u00eedes, or panegyric poems, in praise of the sultan and members of his retinue, and as a result, he was granted a stipend. However, owing to the complexities of the Ottoman bureaucracy, this stipend never materialized. In one of his best-known works, the letter \u015eik\u00e2yetn\u00e2me (\u0634\u06a9\u0627\u064a\u062a \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647; \"Complaint\"), Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee spoke out against such bureaucracy and its attendant corruption: :\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0648\u0631\u062f\u0645 \u0631\u0634\u0648\u062a \u062f\u06af\u0644\u062f\u0631 \u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0622\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062f\u0649\u0644\u0631 :Sel\u00e2m verdim r\u00fc\u015fvet de\u011fildir dey\u00fc almad\u0131lar.Kudret 189 :I said hello, but they didn't accept as it wasn't a bribe. Though his poetry flourished during his time among the Ottomans, the loss of his stipend meant that, materially speaking, Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee never became secure. In fact, most of his life was spent attending upon the Tomb of `Al\u00ee in the city of an-Najaf, south of Baghdad.Andrews 237 He died during a plague outbreak in 1556, in Karbal\u0101\u2019, either of the plague itself or of cholera. ==Works== Layla and Majnun Manuscript of the Hadiqat al-Su`ada (Garden of the Blessed) of Fuzuli, 1602-3 C.E. Brooklyn Museum. A page from the collected poems of Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee has always been known, first and foremost, as a poet of love. It was, in fact, a characterization that he seems to have agreed with: :\u0645\u0646\u062f\u0646 \u0641\u0636\u0648\u0644\u06cc \u0627\u064a\u0633\u062a\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0634\u0639\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u062f\u062d \u0648 \u0630\u0645 :\u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0642\u0627\u0645 \u0647\u0645\u064a\u0634\u0647 \u0633\u0648\u0632\u0648\u0645 \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0642\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u062f\u06cc\u0631 :Menden Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee isteme e\u015f'\u00e2r-\u0131 medh \u00fc zem :Men \u00e2\u015f\u0131kam hem\u00ee\u015fe s\u00f6z\u00fcm \u00e2\u015f\u0131k\u00e2ned\u00fcrTarlan 47 :Don't ask Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee for poems of praise or rebuke :I am a lover and speak only of love Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee's notion of love, however, has more in common with the Sufi idea of love as a projection of the essence of God\u2014though Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee himself seems to have belonged to no particular Sufi order\u2014than it does with the Western idea of romantic love. This can be seen in the following lines from another poem: :\u0639\u0627\u0634\u0642 \u0627\u064a\u0645\u0634 \u0647\u0631 \u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0631 \ufecb\ufe8e\ufedd\ufee2 :\ufecb\u0644\u0645 \u0628\u0631 \u0642\u064a\u0644 \u0648 \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u064a\u0645\u0634 \u0622\u0646\u062c\u0642 :\u2018\u00c2\u015f\u0131k imi\u015f her ne var \u2018\u00e2lem :\u2018\u0130lm bir k\u00eel \u00fc k\u00e2l imi\u015f ancakKudret 20 :All that is in the world is love :And knowledge is nothing but gossip The first of these lines, especially, relates to the idea of wahdat al-wuj\u016bd (\u0648\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f), or \"unity of being\", which was first formulated by Ibn al-\u2018Arab\u012b and which states that nothing apart from various manifestations of God exists. Here, Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee uses the word \"love\" (\u0639\u0627\u0634\u0642 \u2018a\u015fk) rather than God in the formula, but the effect is the same. Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee's most extended treatment of this idea of love is in the long poem D\u00e2st\u00e2n-\u0131 Leyl\u00ee v\u00fc Mecnun (\u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0644\u0649 \u0648 \u0645\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0646), a mesnev\u00ee which takes as its subject the classical Middle Eastern love story of Layla and Majnun. In his version of the story, Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee concentrates upon the pain of the mad lover Majnun's separation from his beloved Layla, and comes to see this pain as being of the essence of love. The ultimate value of the suffering of love, in Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee's work, lies in that it helps one to approach closer to \"the Real\" (al-Haqq \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642), which is one of the 99 names of God in Islamic tradition. ==Selected bibliography== ===Works in Azerbaijani Turkic=== * D\u00eev\u00e2n (\"Collected Poems\") * Beng \u00fc B\u00e2de (\u0628\u0646\u06af \u0648 \u0628\u0627\u062f\u0647; \"Hashish and Wine\") * Had\u00eekat \u00fcs-S\u00fced\u00e2 (\u062d\u062f\u064a\u0642\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u062f\u0627\u0621; \"Garden of Pleasures\") * D\u00e2st\u00e2n-\u0131 Leyl\u00ee v\u00fc Mecn\u00fbn (\u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0644\u0649 \u0648 \u0645\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0646; \"The Epic of Layla and Majnun\") * Ris\u00e2le-i Muammey\u00e2t (\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644 \ufee4\ufecc\ufee4\u064a\u0627\u062a; \"Treatise on Riddles\") * \u015eik\u00e2yetn\u00e2me (\u0634\u06a9\u0627\u064a\u062a \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647; \"Complaint\") ===Works in Persian=== * D\u00eev\u00e2n (\"Collected Poems\") * An\u00ees ol-qalb (\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0644\u0628; \"Friend of the Heart\") * Haft J\u00e2m (\u0647\u0641\u062a \u062c\u0627\u0645; \"Seven Goblets\") * Rend va Z\u00e2hed (\u0631\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0632\u0627\u0647\u062f; \"Hedonist and Ascetic\") * Res\u00e2le-e Muammey\u00e2t (\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644 \ufee4\ufecc\ufee4\u064a\u0627\u062a; \"Treatise on Riddles\") * Sehhat o Ma'ruz (\u0635\u062d\u062a \u0648 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0636; \"Health and Sickness\") ===Works in Arabic=== * D\u012bw\u0101n (\"Collected Poems\") * Ma\u1e6dla\u2018 ul-I\u2018tiq\u0101di (\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0627\ufecb\ufe98\ufed8\ufe8e\u062f; \"The Birth of Faith\") ===Translations into English=== * Fuzuli.
