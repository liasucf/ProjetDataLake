    "text": "Among Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, coupling from the past is a method for sampling from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. Contrary to many MCMC algorithms, coupling from the past gives in principle a perfect sample from the stationary distribution. It was invented by James Propp and David Wilson in 1996. ==The basic idea== Consider a finite state irreducible aperiodic Markov chain M with state space S and (unique) stationary distribution \\pi (\\pi is a probability vector). Suppose that we come up with a probability distribution \\mu on the set of maps f:S\\to S with the property that for every fixed s\\in S, its image f(s) is distributed according to the transition probability of M from state s. An example of such a probability distribution is the one where f(s) is independent from f(s') whenever s e s', but it is often worthwhile to consider other distributions. Now let f_j for j\\in\\mathbb Z be independent samples from \\mu. Suppose that x is chosen randomly according to \\pi and is independent from the sequence f_j. (We do not worry for now where this x is coming from.) Then f_{-1}(x) is also distributed according to \\pi, because \\pi is M-stationary and our assumption on the law of f. Define :F_j:= f_{-1}\\circ f_{-2}\\circ\\cdots\\circ f_{-j}. Then it follows by induction that F_j(x) is also distributed according to \\pi for every j\\in\\mathbb{N}. Now here is the main point. It may happen that for some n\\in\\mathbb{N} the image of the map F_n is a single element of S. In other words, F_n(x)=F_n(y) for each y\\in S. Therefore, we do not need to have access to x in order to compute F_n(x). The algorithm then involves finding some n\\in \\mathbb N such that F_n(S) is a singleton, and outputting the element of that singleton. The design of a good distribution \\mu for which the task of finding such an n and computing F_n is not too costly is not always obvious, but has been accomplished successfully in several important instances.http://www.dbwilson.com/exact/ ==The monotone case== There is a special class of Markov chains in which there are particularly good choices for \\mu and a tool for determining if |F_n(S)|=1. (Here |\\cdot| denotes cardinality.) Suppose that S is a partially ordered set with order \\le, which has a unique minimal element s_0 and a unique maximal element s_1; that is, every s\\in S satisfies s_0\\le s\\le s_1. Also, suppose that \\mu may be chosen to be supported on the set of monotone maps f:S\\to S. Then it is easy to see that |F_n(S)|=1 if and only if F_n(s_0)=F_n(s_1), since F_n is monotone. Thus, checking this becomes rather easy. The algorithm can proceed by choosing n:=n_0 for some constant n_0, sampling the maps f_{-1},\\dots,f_{-n}, and outputting F_n(s_0) if F_n(s_0)=F_n(s_1). If F_n(s_0) e F_n(s_1) the algorithm proceeds by doubling n and repeating as necessary until an output is obtained. (But the algorithm does not resample the maps f_{-j} which were already sampled; it uses the previously sampled maps when needed.) == References == * * Category:Monte Carlo methods Category:Markov chain Monte Carlo ",
