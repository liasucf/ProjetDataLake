He served as the Vice President of Carlos Mel\u00e9ndez and Jorge Mel\u00e9ndez from March 1915 to March 1923. ==Early life== Alfonso was born to Lucio Qui\u00f1ones and Aurelia Molina. He was married to Leonor Mel\u00e9ndez Ramirez, who was a sister of the presidents Carlos and Jorge Mel\u00e9ndez.https://www.geni.com/people/Alfonso-Qui%C3%B1%C3%B3nez-Molina- presidente-de-El-Salvador/6000000043286036049 ==Political career== The Melendez-Quinonez dynasty effectively ruled the country from 1914 to 1927. Molina was one of the founders of the Democratic Party of El Salvador. His policies largely served the interests of the coffee oligarchy of the country. In 1918, Molina established the Lega Rojas, or the Red league,which intended to work as a mediator between the oligarchy and the peasants. It was deemed as the first attempt to form an official party in the country.https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs- transcripts-and-maps/quinones-molina-alfonso-1873-1950 However, the far- reaching oligarchic control of the prevented the organization from achieving its goal. Later it supported the candidacy of President Jorge Melendez. After becoming president in 1923, Molina ruled El Salvador like a ruthless dictator,harassing and suppressing any form of opposition. It was common among Salvadoran presidents to declare an heir during the final days of their terms, as the constitution barred immediate re-election. Molina handed the presidency to Vice-president Romero. He thought that as Romero did not spring from a rich family, he would be a puppet of Molina. However, Molina's plan backfired,and he,along with other members of the dynasty organized a coup against the new president. But, the coup, which took place in December 1927, ultimately failed.https://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/q/quinones_molina.htm Molina's decision to borrow money from other countries to pave the roads of San Salvador sparked controversy in the country, and this controversy was exploited by subsequent rulers, like Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Martinez. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1950 deaths Category:People from Cuscatl\u00e1n Department Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:Vice Presidents of El Salvador ",
