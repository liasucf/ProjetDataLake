It partially divides Rhode Island Sound from Buzzards Bay. ==History== The name of the beach is believed to derive from the Algonquin word hassanegk, meaning \"a house made of stone.\" Summer homes were built in the area after a bridge connected the beach to Westport Point in 1893.

Gooseberry Neck was added to the state's holdings in 1957. ==Activities and amenities== The state reservation offers fishing, windsurfing, motorized and non-motorized boating with boat ramp, trails for biking and walking, showers, hunting, and bird watching. The beach is located along the southern portion of the peninsula, bordering Rhode Island Sound and Buzzards Bay.

A 100-site campground is located behind the dunes at Gooseberry Neck, at the eastern end of the reservation. ==Accessibility== The state reservation is accessible from the Bascule Bridge via Route 88, an offshoot of Interstate 195.
