The company is headquartered in New York, with regional headquarters in Munich, Tokyo and Bangalore. ==Products== Schr\u00f6dinger's computational platforms evaluate compounds in silico, with experimental accuracy on properties such as binding affinity and solubility. Schr\u00f6dinger's products include molecular modeling programs and LiveDesign, an enterprise application designed to facilitate communication among interdisciplinary research teams. ==Services== In addition to its computational platforms Schr\u00f6dinger provides professional services, including custom software development and training, computer-cluster design and implementation, and research-based drug discovery projects. ==Partners== Schr\u00f6dinger's partners include larger pharmaceutical companies, including Takeda and Sanofi. Nimbus Therapeutics, co-founded by Schr\u00f6dinger, uses Schr\u00f6dinger's drug screening and design platform for drug discovery. In 2016, Nimbus Therapeutics sold an Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor designed by Schr\u00f6dinger to Gilead in a deal worth up to $1.2 billion. As of spring 2019 the ACC inhibitor was moving through late-stage clinical trials in NASH. ==Recognition== In November 2013, Schr\u00f6dinger, in collaboration with Cycle Computing and the University of Southern California, set a record for the world's largest and fastest cloud computing run by using 156,000 cores on Amazon Web Services to screen over 205,000 molecules for materials science research. That work was a follow up to a 2012 collaboration which saw Cycle Computing creating a 50,000 core virtual supercomputer using Amazon infrastructure and Schr\u00f6dinger's Glide program, which at that time was used to analyze 2.1 million compounds in 3 hours. == See also== * BIOVIA * CambridgeSoft * Chemical Computing Group * Dotmatics, which licenses OpenEye's nomenclature tool * Inte:Ligand * Pharmacelera ==References== ==External links== * Category:American companies established in 1990 Category:Software companies based in New York City Category:Molecular modelling software Category:Publicly traded companies based in New York City Category:Research support companies Category:Life sciences industry Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ Category:2020 initial public offerings Category:Software companies of the United States Category:1990 establishments in the United States Category:1990 establishments in New York (state) Category:Software companies established in 1990 Category:Companies established in 1990 ",
