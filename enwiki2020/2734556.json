    "text": "Optical molasses schematic Optical molasses is a laser cooling technique that can cool neutral atoms to temperatures lower than a magneto-optical trap (MOT). An optical molasses consists of 3 pairs of counter-propagating circularly polarized laser beams intersecting in the region where the atoms are present. The main difference between optical molasses and a MOT is the absence of magnetic field in the former. Therefore, unlike a MOT, an optical molasses provides only cooling and no trapping. While a typical Sodium MOT can cool atoms down to 300\u03bcK, optical molasses can cool the atoms down to 40\u03bcK, an order of magnitude colder. ==History== When laser cooling was proposed in 1975, a theoretical limit on the lowest possible temperature was predicted. Known as the Doppler limit, T_d= \\hbar \\Gamma / {2 k_b} , this was given by the lowest possible temperature attainable considering the cooling of two- level atoms by Doppler cooling and the heating of atoms due to momentum diffusion from the scattering of laser photons. Here, \\Gamma , is the natural line-width of the atomic transition, \\hbar , is the reduced Planck's constant and, k_b , is Boltzmann's constant. Experiments at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, found the temperature of cooled atoms to be well below the theoretical limit. Initially, it was a surprise to theorists, until the full explanation came out. ==Theory== The best explanation of the phenomenon of optical molasses is based on the principle of polarization gradient cooling. Counterpropagating beams of circularly polarized light cause a standing wave, where the light polarization is linear but the direction rotates along the direction of the beams at a very fast rate. Atoms moving in the spatially varying linear polarisation have a higher probability density of being in a state that is more susceptible to absorption of light from the beam coming head-on, rather than the beam from behind. This results in a velocity dependent damping force that is able to reduce the velocity of a cloud of atoms to near the recoil limit. ==References== Category:Atomic, molecular, and optical physics ",
