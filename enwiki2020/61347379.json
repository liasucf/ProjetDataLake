    "text": "is a left-wing populist and progressive political party in Japan founded by actor-turned-politician Tar\u014d Yamamoto in April 2019. The party was formed shortly after Ichir\u014d Ozawa announced that the Liberal Party would merge with the Democratic Party for the People. The party won more than 4% of the vote after contesting the House of Councilors election in July 2019, gaining two seats only about three and a half months after the formation of the party. The party is variously described as being anti-austerity, anti-establishment and anti-nuclear power as well as supporting animal welfare, disability rights and economically interventionist. ==History== ===Founding=== Tar\u014d Yamamoto, a member of the House of Councillors for Tokyo, founded the party on 1 April 2019. This was with the intent of standing multiple candidates, including himself, in the upcoming House of Councillors election later in the year. On 10 April, Yamamoto held a press conference and announced the party's platform. ===2019 House of Councillors election=== The party stood multiple candidates in the 2019 House of Councillors election. The party won 2.2 million votes in the national PR block, exceeding the 2% threshold needed to be recognised as a political party, and securing two seats. Although nearly one million votes were cast for Yamamoto personally, since the party had nominated Yasuhiko Funago and Eiko Kimura, both of whom have disabilities,Funago with ALS and Kimura with cerebral palsy ahead of him in the party list, Yamamoto did not win a seat. The National Diet Building was adapted to allow barrier-free access for wheelchair users. Notable party members include university professor Ayumi Yasutomi and former deputy representative of the North Korean abduction liaison Toru Hasuike. === 2020 Tokyo gubernatorial election === Party leader Tar\u014d Yamamoto was one of the 22 candidates participating in the 2020 Tokyo gubernatorial election, coming in third place with 10.72% of the votes. The party promises included a direct cash handout programme due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Policies== In a press conference held shortly after the founding of the party, Yamamoto announced that his party would push for the abolition of the consumption tax and instead, make the corporation tax a progressive tax and increase government bonds. In addition, he said that the party is against the construction of the Henoko base. They would also ban nuclear power entirely, raise the minimum wage to 1500\u00a5 per hour with public guarantee, implement laws protecting free education, disability rights, LGBT rights, animal rights, institute a basic income of \u00a530,000 (circa $283 as of September 2020) per person per month whenever inflation is below 2% (benefits would end whenever inflation is not below the threshold and resume if it goes below again), and reinforce social services. The party has announced that it would reverse/abolish many of the laws that were revised or passed by Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe if elected, including the pre-emptive anti-terrorism law such as martial law State Secrecy Law and the 2015 Japanese military legislation. ==References== Category:2019 establishments in Japan Category:Political parties established in 2019 Category:Political parties in Japan Category:Left-wing populist parties Category:Progressivism in Japan ",
