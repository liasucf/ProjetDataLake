    "text": "Champs Boxing was a series of boxing matches that took place in Fort Worth, Texas during 2002 and 2003. The boxing events were created to supplement Telefutua\u2019s programming when the network moved to a 24-hour schedule. The boxing matches took place on Saturday night, and aired later in the week to round out TeleFutura\u2019s growing need for programming content. TeleFutura had large Friday Night boxing programming, but the demand was to add several smaller events throughout the week. Tommy Habeeb, Leslie Norris, and Dustin Hodge were the producers and produced the events through Tommy Habeeb Enterprises, before later moving to producing MMA events for the Art of War Undisputed Arena Fighting Championship. Kendrick Releford and America Santos were two of the more well known boxers on the events. The fights were sanctioned by the Texas Combative Sports Program. == History == Champs Boxing held six events.
