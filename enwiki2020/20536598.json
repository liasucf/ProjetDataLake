Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species on 2012-05-07Johnson R.F. & Gosliner T.M. (2012) Traditional taxonomic groupings mask evolutionary history: A molecular phylogeny and new classification of the chromodorid nudibranchs. PLoS ONE 7(4): e33479 ==Distribution== The type locality for this species is Ceylon (Sri Lanka). It has been reported widely in the Indo-West Pacific region.Rudman W.B. (1985) The Chromodorididae (Opisthobranchia: Mollusca) of the Indo-West Pacific: Chromodoris aureomarginata, C. verrieri and C. fidelis colour groups. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 83: 241-299. page(s): 268 ==Description== Goniobranchus preciosus has a white mantle with three lines of colour at the edge. The mantle rim is marked by a thin white line, with a dark red band inside this and then a yellow band. The rhinophore clubs are brown with white edges to the lamellae and the gill leaves are also brown with white markings.Gosliner, T.M., Behrens, D.W. & Vald\u00e9s, \u00c1.

The body length varies between 15 mm and 30 mm.Rudman, W.B., 2000 (July 2) Chromodoris preciosa (Kelaart, 1858). [In] Sea Slug Forum. Australian Museum, Sydney.Debelius, H. & Kuiter, R.H.

Goniobranchus trimarginatus is also similar, but has white gills and rhinophores and red speckles in the middle of the back. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Chromodorididae Category:Gastropods described in 1858 ",
