Born in Bessarabia, Russian Empire,\"Abraham Psachia Lerner, Assistant Lecturer in Economics\", The London Gazette, 8 November 1935. Lerner grew up in a Jewish family, which emigrated to Great Britain when Lerner was three years old. Lerner grew up in London's East End and from age 16 worked as a machinist, a teacher in Hebrew schools, and as an entrepreneur. In 1929, Lerner entered the London School of Economics, where he studied under Friedrich Hayek. A six-month stay at Cambridge in 1934\u20131935 brought him into contact with John Maynard Keynes. In 1937, Lerner emigrated to the United States. Lerner never stayed at one institution long, serving on the faculties of nearly a dozen universities and accepting over 20 visiting appointments. Lerner was 62 when he was given a professorship at the University of California, Berkeley in 1965 and left after reaching mandatory retirement age six years later. During his time there, Lerner criticized the unrest caused by the student Free Speech Movement as a threat to academic freedom. Although Lerner never received the Sveriges Riksbank's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, he has been recognized as one of the greatest economists of his era. Fundamental economic \"concepts, theorems and rules\" were derived and/or furthered by Lerner's work throughout his academic career. == Activities == * Lerner developed a model of market socialism which featured decentralised market pricing proportional to marginal social costAbba P.

Stiglitz, 1985. \"Human Fallibility and Economic Organization\", American Economic Review, 75(2), pp. 292\u2013297. * Lerner contributed to the idea of a social dividend by incorporating it into Oskar R. Lange's original model of socialism, where the social dividend would be distributed to each citizen as a lump-sum payment.Who framed 'social dividend'?, by Van Tier, Walter. March 2002. USBIG Conference, CUNY. * The use of fiscal policy and monetary policy as the twin tools of Keynesian economics is credited to Lerner by historians such as David Colander.\"What eventually became known as textbook Keynesian policies were in many ways Lerner's interpretations of Keynes's policies, especially those expounded in The Economics of Control (1944) and later in The Economics of Employment (1951)...Textbook expositions of Keynesian policy naturally gravitated to the black and white 'Lernerian' policy of Functional Finance rather than the grayer Keynesian policies. Thus, the vision that monetary and fiscal policy should be used as a balance wheel, which forms a key element in the textbook policy revolution, deserves to be called Lernerian rather than Keynesian.\" * The Lerner symmetry theorem states that an import tariff can have the same effects as an export tax.Abba P.

Lerner, 1944, The Economics of Control, Macmillan, ch. 3. \u2022 _____, 1978. \"Utilitarian Marginalism (Nozick, Rawls, Justice, and Welfare),\" Eastern Economic Journal, 4(1), pp. 51\u201365. * Based on effective demand principle and chartalism, Lerner developed functional finance, a theory of purposeful financing (and funding) to meet explicit goals, including full employment, no taxation designed solely to fund expenditure or finance investment and low inflation.Abba P. Lerner, 1943. \"Functional Finance and the Federal Debt,\" Social Research, 10(1), pp. 38\u201351. * Lerner (1951) developed the concept of the NAIRU (before Friedman and Phelps). He termed it \"low full employment\" and contrasted it with \"high full employment\", the maximum employment achievable by implementing functional finance.Abba P.
