    "text": "Aseptatorina is a suborder of parasitic alveolates of the phylum Apicomplexia ==Taxonomy== There are eleven families recognised in this suborder. There are ~400 species in these families. Five families \u2014 Allantocystidae, Diplocystidae, Enterocystidae, Ganymedidae and Schaudinnellidae \u2014 have only one genus. Aikinetocystidae has two genera. Two families in this suborder \u2014 Ganymedidae and Thiriotiidae \u2014 infect crustaceans. The taxonomy of this suborder may be in need of revision as it has been shown based on SSU 18S rDNA sequences that four families \u2014 Ganymedidae from the Aseptatorina and Cephalolobidae, Porosporidae and Uradiophoridae from the Septatorina appear to form a superfamily. The name Cephaloidophoroidea has been proposed for this superfamily ==History== This suborder was created by Chakravarty in 1960. ==Description== The gamont of the species in this suborder have a single compartment. An epimerite or mucron is found in some species. Syzygy occurs. ==References== Category:SAR supergroup suborders Category:Conoidasida ",
