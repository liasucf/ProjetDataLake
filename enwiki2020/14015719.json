    "text": "The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Clermont (Latin: Archidioecesis Claromontana; French: Archidioc\u00e8se de Clermont) is an Archdiocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in France. The diocese comprises the department of Puy-de-D\u00f4me, in the Region of Auvergne. The Archbishop's seat is Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral. Throughout its history Clermont was the senior suffragan of the Archdiocese of Bourges. It became a metropolitan see itself, however, in 2002. The current Archbishop is Fran\u00e7ois Kalist. At first very extensive, the diocese lost Haute-Auvergne in 1317 through the reorganization of the structure of bishoprics in southern France and Aquitaine by Pope John XXII, resulting in the creation of the diocese of Saint-Flour.Saint-Flour (Diocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy] In 1822, in the reorganization of French dioceses by Pope Pius VII, following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, the diocese of Clermont lost the Bourbonnais, on account of the erection of the diocese of Moulins. Since the reorganization in 2002 by Pope John Paul II, there are now four dioceses in the Province of Clermont: Clermont, Le Puy-en- Velay, Moulins, and Saint-Flour. ==History== The first Bishop of Clermont was Saint Austremonius (Stramonius). According to local tradition he was one of the seventy-two Disciples of Christ, by birth a Jew, who came with Saint Peter from Palestine to Rome and subsequently became the Apostle of Auvergne, Berry, Nivernais, and Limousin. At Clermont he is said to have converted the senator Cassius and the pagan priest Victorinus, to have sent Saint Sirenatus (Cerneuf) to Thiers, Saint Marius to Salers, Saint Nectarius (Nectaire) and Saint Antoninus into other parts of Auvergne, and to have been beheaded in 92. This tradition is based on a life of Saint Anstremonius written in the tenth century in the Mozac Abbey, where the body of the saint had rested from 761, and rewritten by the monks of Issoire, who retained the saint's head. Gregory of Tours, born in Auvergne in 544 and well versed in the history of that country, looks upon Austremonius as one of the seven envoys who, about 250, evangelized Gaul; he relates how the body of the saint was first interred at Issoire, being there the object of great veneration. Cf. (polemical, defensive of hagiographical tradition). Among the Bishops of Clermont should also be mentioned: Pierre de Cros (1301\u201304), engaged by Thomas Aquinas to complete his Summa; \u00c9tienne Aubert (1340\u201342), later Pope Innocent VI (1352\u201362); Guillaume du Prat (1528\u201360), founder of the Clermont College in Paris, and delegate of Francis I of France to the Council of Trent; and Massillon, the illustrious orator (1717\u201342). Several famous Jansenists were natives of Clermont: Blaise Pascal, author of the Pens\u00e9es (1623\u201362); the Arnauld family, and Jean Soanen (1647\u20131740), Bishop of Senez, famous for his stubborn opposition to the Bull \"Unigenitus\". On the other hand, the city of Riom in the diocese of Clermont was the birthplace of Jacques Sirmond, the learned Jesuit (1559\u20131651), Confessor to Louis XIII and editor of the volumes on the ancient councils of Gaul. Other natives worth mention were the Abb\u00e9 Jacques Delille, poet and Academician (1738\u20131813); and Fran\u00e7ois Dominique de Reynaud, Comte de Montlosier, the publicist (1755\u20131838), who was a member of the Estates General of 1789 for Clermont-Ferrand and a Royalist in the Convention, famous for his memoir against the Jesuits and for his being refused a Catholic burial by Bishop Ferou. The famous Jesuit paleontologist and philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955) was born only seven miles from Clermont, in the Ch\u00e2teau d'Orcines; his publications were condemned by the Roman Catholic Church.Dietrich von Hildebrand, Teilhard de Chardin: A False Prophet (Franciscan Herald Press 1970). Undoubtedly, and by far, the most famous native sons of the diocese of Clermont were \u00c9douard Michelin (1859\u20131940) and his elder brother Andr\u00e9 Michelin (1853-1931), who perfected the pneumatic tire. ===Religious Orders=== The Diocese of Clermont can likewise claim a number of monks whom the Church honours as saints, viz: St. Calevisus (Calais, 460\u2013541), a pupil in the monastery of Menat near Riom, whence he retired to Maine, where he founded the Abbey of Anisole; St. Maztius (died 527), founder at Royat near Clermont of a monastery which became later a Benedictine priory; St. Portianus (sixth century), founder of a monastery to which the city of Saint-Pour\u00e7ain (Allier) owes its origin; St. \u00c9tienne de Muret (1046\u20131124), son of the Viscount of Thiers and founder of the Order of Grandmont in Limousin, and St. Peter the Venerable (1092\u20131156), of the Montboissier family of Auvergue, noted as a writer and Abbot of Cluny. In the diocese of Clermont, the King of France enjoyed the right of nomination of the head of numerous houses. On each of the abbeys see: These included the Benedictine abbeys of Saint-Austremoine d'Issiore,Gallia christiana II, pp. 357-360. Ebrulles,Gallia christiana II, pp. 369-372.

Cistercian abbeys included: Bellaigue, Bouchet (Vau-Luisant), Mont-Peyroux, and Val-honneste. The king nominated the Abbot of the Augustinian house at Chantoin, as well as the Premonstratensian Abbots of Saint-Andr\u00e9-lez-Clermont, Saint-Gilbert-de- Neuf-fontaines, and the abbeys of Beaumont, La Boissie, Cessac, and L'Eschelle. Priories which were royal benefices were: Bragat, Cusset, Theulle (Ordre de Grammont), and Sallignac. He also held the nomination of the Collegiate Churches of Arthonne (the Abbot), Verneul (the Dean, Chanter, and five prebends), and the Dean of Saint-Amable de Rion. Other abbeys in the diocese included Saint-Pour\u00e7ain, between Clermont and Moulins.Gallia christiana II, pp. 371-374. The mendicant orders began to appear in the diocese of Clermont at an early date. The Franciscans were installed in Montferrand around 1224, and shortly thereafter at Le Puy. The Dominicans were in evidence in Clermont itself by 1227 and the Franciscans in 1241. The Dominicans also settled in Aurillac ca 1230, at Riom (1233) and at Brioude (ca. 1240-1244). Clermont also had houses of Clarisses and Carmelites. The Augustinians settled at Ennezat in 1352 and the Carmelites at Aurillac in 1358. The Dominicans opened a convent at Saint-Flour before 1367. The Celestines took up residence in Vichy in 1410. The reformed Franciscans appeared in the fifteenth century, and the observant Franciscans in 1430 at Murat.Martin (ed.), p. 443. Gallia christiana II, pp. 223-224; 322-324. The Jesuits established themselves in Clermont with the College de Clermont in 1630, after a stormy beginning in which the municipality attempted to bring the College under its control. The institution grew in numbers and prestige until 1762, when an ordinance of the Parlement of Paris of 27 February forbade the municipal officers of Clermont from choosing the masters and regents of the College from among the Jesuits. The Jesuits left Clermont in March, and the Society of Jesus was completely suppressed in France in 1764. Thereafter the College was administered by a committee, authorized by a royal order, of which the Bishop was the chair. In 1791 the College became an 'Institut' administered by the Directorate of the D\u00e9partement, and in 1796 it became the \u00c9cole centrale du d\u00e9partement de Puy-de-D\u00f4me and was administered by the municipal committee on public instruction.Tardieu, p. 616-620. The Jesuits also had colleges at Billom and Mauriac.Poitrineau, pp. 88-89. Other religious orders suffered in the Revolution. All monastic vows were abolished by the Constituent Assembly in the Autumn of 1789, and on 10 October 1789 all the properties and lands of the Church were confiscated for the benefit of the people. On 13 February 1790 all religious orders in France were dissolved. ===Councils and Papal Visits=== Church councils took place at Clermont in 535, 549,Hefele, IV, p. 371. J.D. Mansi, Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus IX (Florence 1763), pp. 141-146. It is interesting that no bishop of Auvergne (Clermont) subscribes, though Bishop Gallus was present at the Council of Orleans earlier in the same year. ca. 585\u2013588,The Council of 585/588 was a provincial synod, presided over by the Archbishop of Bourges: Mansi, IX (Florence 1763), 973-974. 590,The council in confinio trium civitatum (Arverni, Gabalitani, Rutheni; Clermont, Mende, Rodez): Gregory of Tours, Historia Francorum Book X, chapter 8.

The Council of 535 met under the presidency of Bishop Honoratus of Bourges and ratified at least fifteen canons, including one (\u00a72) that ordered that bishops be elected by the clergy and people, with the consent of the Metropolitan; and one (\u00a78) that forbade that Jews be appointed judges over Christians. Canon 6 prohibited sexual relations between a Christian and a Jew.Hefele, p. 191. De Clercq, pp. 106-107. The Council of 590 met at the southern border of the diocese of Clermont, where it touches the dioceses of Mende and Rodez. The bishops at the meeting, including perhaps Avitus of Clermont and Innocentius of Rodez attempted to deal with the complicated business of Tetradia, the widow of one Desiderius, and her dealings with Count Eulalius.Gregory of Tours, Historia Francorum Book X, chapter 8. Duchesne, pp. 36, 40, 55. Pope Urban II came to Clermont in mid- November 1095P. Jaff\u00e9, Regesta pontificum Romanorum, I, editio altera (Leipzig 1885), p. 681-682. Urban II left Clermont in the first days of December. to preside at the Council which launched the First Crusade; D. C. Munro, \"The Speech of Pope Urban II at Clermont,\" American Historical Review, XI (1906), 231\u2014242. R. Somerville (1976), 'The Council of Clermont and the First Crusade', Studia Gratiana, 20 (1976), pp. 335-337.

It was also at Clermont that, in 1262, in presence of St. Louis, the marriage of Philip the Bold and Isabella of Aragon was solemnized.Claude Fleury, Historia ecclesiastica (ed. B. Parode and D. Ziegler) Tomus XXI (Augsburg 1765), pp. 405-406. ===Cathedral=== Saint Austremonius The earliest cathedral in Clermont is naturally attributed to Saint Austremonius, the first bishop, and would therefore be a work of the third century; this is hardly likely, since Christianity was still an illegal cult, nor is it likely that it was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, given that the second cathedral had a different dedication. The second building is attributed to Bishop Namatius, in the mid-fifth century, and took twelve years to construct. It was dedicated to SS. Vitalis and Agricola.Tardieu, p. 216. This building is described by Gregory of Tours in glowing terms.Gregory of Tours, Historia Francorum, Book II, chapter 16. It was 150 feet long, 60 feet wide, and 50 feet high; it had 42 windows and eight entries. It was decorated with mosaics. The first stone for the third cathedral was laid in 937, and it was dedicated by Bishop Stephanus (II) nine years later. It was dedicated to the Virgin, SS. Vitalis and Agricola, S. Croix, S. Gervais, S. John the Baptist, S. Julian the Martyr, and the Holy Angel.Tardieu, p. 217. The fourth and current cathedral was founded in 1248 by Bishop Hugues de la Tour, who laid the first stone before his departure for Crusade. The cathedral was finally consecrated in 1341, though it was still uncompleted.Tardieu, p. 218. The Cathedral Chapter of Clermont had three dignities (the Provost,List of Provosts of Clermont: Tardieu, pp. 250-251. the Abbot,List of the Abbots of Clermont: Tardieu, pp. 251-253. and the DeanList of the Deans of Clermont: Tardieu, pp. 253-254.); there were thirty-five Canons,List of Canons of Clermont: Tardieu, pp. 256-264. all of which were filled by vote of the Chapter.Gallia christiana IX, p. 223. Privileges of the Cathedral Chapter: Tardieu, pp. 265-270. The Chapter was suppressed by the Constitutional government in 1793. It was reestablished in accordance with the Concordat of 1801 by Bishop Du Valk de Dampierre in April 1803, with only one dignity, the Grand Chantre, and ten canons.Tardieu, p. 275. The Grand Seminaire de Clermont was the idea of Bishop Louis d'Estaing (1650-1664), whose principal concern was the improvement of the condition of the clergy of his diocese. In 1653 the bishop entered into an agreement with the Abbey of Saint-Alyre for the conversion of an unused priory in Clermont for his seminary, in exchange for a tax abatement. The project won the approval of the government of Louis XIV in a royal edict of 1654. In 1775 the Grand Seminary was transferred to larger quarters, and its quarters handed over to the Petit Seminaire which had been founded in 1712. Both were closed by order of the Revolutionary government and the buildings were sold on 11 February 1791 and turned into a barracks. The Grand Seminary was reconstituted by Bishop Du Valk de Dampierre in 1804 at Montferrand, along with the Minor Seminary.Tardieu, pp. 627-630. In 1980 the Grand Seminaire de Clermont was forced to close its doors, due to the small number of ordinands. Students for the priesthood from the diocese now attend the S\u00e9minaire Saint-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e de Francheville, near Lyon.Martin, p. 435. ==Bishops== ===To 1000=== *Saint AustremoineB.

(676\u2013691) *BonitusBonitus had studied law, and became Referendary (judge) for King Sigebert III of Austrasia (ca. 634\u2013ca. 660). He then served as Governor of Marseille for Thierry III, King of Neustria (673\u2013691) and Austrasia (679\u2013691). Bonitus became bishop of Auvergne on the death of his brother Avitus, in an election of questionable canonical validity, though he was confirmed by Pepin of Herstal (679\u2013695). After ten years as bishop he retired to the monastery of Manglieu, later making a pilgrimage to Rome. He died at Lyon, where he had been resident for some four years, ca. 707.
