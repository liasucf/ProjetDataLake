    "text": "Jack Abbott is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. The character was first introduced in 1980 being portrayed by Terry Lester. Lester departed from the series in 1989 and was replaced by Peter Bergman shortly thereafter. Bergman relocated to California for the role after he successfully auditioned for the part. His first episode aired on November 27, 1989. Jack is known for his longstanding feud with the Newman family patriarch, Victor Newman as well as his romances with Nikki Newman, Phyllis Summers and Sharon Newman. Jack has represented the Abbott family as the patriarch since the 2006 passing of his father, John Abbott. ==Casting== The role of Jack Abbott was first written into the series on July 22, 1980, being portrayed by Terry Lester. In May 1985, it was announced that Lester would be leaving the role; he stated that it was because of a CBS film (Blade) he starred in which could have possibly become a series: \"I wanted to work something out. I've enjoyed being with the show. However, I was concerned about the possibility of Blade being picked up as a series and being tied to The Young and the Restless.\" However, he ended up staying. Brett Porter briefly portrayed the role in 1986. The writers picked up on Lester having \"played with Jack's dialogue\" according to his intuitions. In 1989, Lester quit out of anger, as he felt that Jack was being \"squeezed\" out of the storyline, and was upset that Lauralee Bell's character Christine Blair was moved to the forefront of several storylines. Lester made his last appearance on September 1, 1989. The producers immediately began exploring recast options. At the time, Bergman, who had rose to super stardom as Dr. Cliff Warner on All My Children, had recently been fired. Bergman's firing made headlines, and Melody Thomas Scott, who portrays Nikki Newman, suggested Bergman as Jack to her husband and former executive producer Edward J. Scott when she read of the news in Soap Opera Digest. Bergman revealed that the producers had contacted his agent and asked about his height; he initially thought it was a joke. They then inquired about Bergman's feelings about replacing someone, and he was hesitant to take the role. He stated in 2009: \"I was on All My Children and replacing someone was sheer death, and it never worked on All My Children.\" When the producers called him again, he decided it \"couldn't hurt\" to audition. Scott arranged for Bergman to come to California and audition with Jerry Douglas and Jess Walton, who portrayed John and Jill Abbott respectively. After a successful audition, Bergman was offered the part. Bergman reluctantly relocated to California after accepting the part. He made his debut on November 27, 1989. Other actors were considered for the role, including Jon Lindstrom, who screen tested for William J. Bell, which was later broadcast on an episode of 48 Hours. In 1997, Bergman appeared as Jack on an episode of the popular CBS series The Nanny entitled \"The Heather Biblow Story\". In the episode, he shared an onscreen kiss with fellow guest star Pamela Anderson. Bergman also guest starred as Jack on another of the network's comedy series' The King of Queens; he appeared in the episode \"Inner Tube\" along with fellow cast members Melody Thomas Scott and Scott Reeves (who portrayed Ryan McNeil). In 2006, Bergman stated: \"I love what I do! I get a new script every day, and I can't wait to find out what happens next. I've been doing this for 18 years, and I still can't wait to see what Jack has in store for us next.\" ==Development== ===Characterization=== While he was in the role, Lester stated that Jack was a villain, but not entirely: \"I think Jack has changed in the past four years, although there's a tendency to make him the same old circus villain he was in the beginning. Happily the producers, the writers and myself were able to keep Jack progressing - never a wonderful person, but not nasty just to be nasty.\" Of the character, Bergman stated that: \"Jack goes from tender, loving scenes at the beginning of an episode with Nikki, where he's so pathetic and loving and sincere, to taking someone's head off by Act 5. Jack is mercurial that way. He can be in a perfectly good mood and you scuff his shoe and he wants to kill you. I don't have any problems supporting that with real emotions.\" According to Bergman, \"Jack is not annoyed by the 'little people' ever.\" Though Jack is a villain, Bergman \"wanted Jack to have Achilles heels.\" Jack spends majority of his life longing for \"a solid happy family.\" Bergman's first lines as Jack on the show were \"Smiling Jack is back. No more Mr. nice guy.\" Jack has always had trouble finding and keeping the right woman. When compared to his former alter ego Cliff Warner, Bergman explained: \"It is quite the contrast, the guy who found his one true love, followed by the most unlucky-in-love guy out there, someone who can't seem to hold on to it. Love is just out of his grasp.\" During his 20th anniversary reflection, Bergman described Jack as \"a reckless, selfish, uncaring cad\" changed by love. Jack's playboy issues stem from missing his mother. His unfaithfulness was a way of unconsciously punishing all women for his mother abandoning him. For Bergman's portrayal of Jack, Mamie Johnson (Veronica Redd) is his \"Achilles heel\". Mamie is the woman who has been around since he was a child, even when his mother isn't. Jack cannot get anything past Mamie; Bergman said that she \"saw right through him\". However, John fills the role of father and mother for Jack which makes him a \"therefore larger than life figure in Jack's life.\" Bergman described John as Jack's \"rudder\" or \"consciousness.\" So when John dies, Jack feels alone. Soon after, Jack begins seeing John's ghost. According to Bergman, Jack is \"so desperate to keep his dead dad around, he keeps conjuring him up!\" ===Relationships=== Bergman stated that Jack's three most significant romances with Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott), Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) and Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) helped to reform him. Jack goes after Nikki initially for business and revenge. He intends to get Nikki to fall for him and then use her to get Jabot Cosmetics back from Victor. Jack's plan to bargain for the company by using Nikki backfires when he falls for her. Jack falls hard and is at \"his most vulnerable\" with Nikki. Though quite a few women fall victim to Jack's philandering ways, Nikki forgives him. When they lose their son in March 1993, Bergman said that, \"Jack learned empathy for the first time in his life.\" Jack usually has a lot of control over his life, but he cannot save Nikki from her addiction; in fact, he makes it worse. By the time the relationship does fall apart, \"[Jack] is still a cad, but not as bad as before.\" Jack has a long- standing relationship with Phyllis Summers. Bergman described Jack and Phyllis's pairing as one of his \"least likely pairings\", stating that Jack and Phyllis are the complete \"opposite of star-crossed\". Despite divorcing after only three years, the couple remains close. Phyllis ends up having an affair with Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow), resulting in a pregnancy. Bergman said that, \"It truly hurts him. He's in pain\" when he sees Phyllis pregnant. Following Phyllis's betrayal, Bergman felt Jack changes again, \"in a big way\", and that he becomes very \"complex\". Jack then begins a romance with Nick's ex- wife, Sharon Newman, who was also hurt by the affair. Of the decision to pair the characters, Bergman said that it may have been an \"ill-conceived last resort\" after the Phyllis and Nick pairing. The co-stars decided to make the relationship work. Bergman revealed that he and Case made the \"concerted effort to turn this relationship into something\". Of the relationship, Bergman said: \"It is only appropriate that Jack and Sharon found each other. Wherever Sharon goes, she is embarrassed. Will Phyllis come walking around the corner? But Sharon doesn't have any reason to be embarrassed with Jack.\" However, Bergman also noted that his intimacy with Sharon \"all happens so quickly. Jack is doing something manipulative.\" He also noted that Jack is attracted to Sharon's \"simple honesty\". The only thing Sharon wants in return is honesty, and Jack cannot give it to her. Sharon is the closest Jack's ever come to having a solid family unit. Though the relationship only last three and half years, Sharon is there for Jack during the death of his father and his niece, Colleen (Tammin Sursok). Jack has had other various romances. In 1994, Jack became romantically involved with newly introduced character Mari Jo Mason (Diana Barton), after a \"year of going\" it solo without a love interest. Nancy Reichardt of The Tuscaloosa News noted that Jack was back \"romantically speaking\", finding love again. However, Mari had a hidden past; a relationship with Blade Bladeson (Michael Tylo), who was married to his sister Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). Bergman said he was \"having fun\" playing out the storyline, but speaking of Mari, he said: \"I u\u00edk quite make out whether she's a big event in Jack's life or a big event in Blade Bladeson's life ... I certainly love the idea that it's a convoluted a story as it is.\" Bergman said that he is happy that Jack is \"feeling saucy again\", stating: \"I like Jack being on the prowl. I like the energy Jack gets to play. It's different from what I've been playing for some time.\" Of working with a newly cast soap opera actress, Bergman said it could be difficult working with someone lacking \"technical experience\" but at the same time, praised Barton's work. The romance failed. ===Rivalries=== Following a 2006 storyline which saw the Abbott children team up against their late father's wife Gloria Fisher (Judith Chapman), Bergman said: \"It's almost laughable that anyone feels sorry for Gloria.\" He said that \"a woman died possibly because of her malfeasance (Gloria tainted Ashley's skin cream sample), and we're feeling sorry for her? Not to mention how she changed the last part of John's life: He spent the last month of his life in prison.\" Bergman, however, stated that Jack changed after his father's passing; all he wanted was to regain the family company, Jabot Cosmetics and would do anything good or bad to get it. Bergman said: \"Jack changed at the funeral. A switch changed immutably the day John died. John was Jack's moral compass. Now he's not encumbered by that course of right and wrong. There are not too many places he won't go to protect his family.\" ===Doppelg\u00e4nger=== In April 2015, it is revealed that there are two Jacks, one being Jack himself and another being a doppelg\u00e4nger hired by Victor. On-Air On-Soaps noted that there was much speculation leading up to the reveal, observing that \"Many in the audience guessed it\". Bergman took on dual roles, the first time he had done this in his career. The actor said that he was \"having a ball\" playing two characters, saying: \"The challenge is to make it entertaining and the best way to do that is to make a lot of it funny, and we do.\" Luke Kerr of Daytime Confidential wrote: \"[Victor] went shopping at Moguls-R-Us and came home with a shiny, new Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) doppelganger, whom he's unleashed on Genoa City.\" Little is known about Fake Jack upon his introduction to the soap opera, apart from the fact that he was found by Victor in a Peruvian prison, although Bergman speculated that the character \"is quite literally a doppelg\u00e4nger, that lookalike we all supposedly have walking around on the planet somewhere\". The character is described as a \"loose cannon\". Bergman also told TV Insider that Fake Jack \"likes to wear bright stuff. [Laughs] I've been having a ball with the people in the wardrobe department!\" ==Storylines== ===Backstory=== John Abbott, Jr. known commonly as Jack, is born on June 29 (in 1953 or 1954) to Dina Abbott. and John Abbott .

Bergman however was able to win over majority of Lester's fans within the first six months of his tenure. He stated: \"The All My Children fans were the hardest ones to win over because Cliff was such a nice character.\" Marla Hart of the Chicago Tribune noted that since joining the soap opera, \"Bergman has traded on his pretty-boy image to underscore Jack's less savory side.\" Jamaica Gleaner news wrote: \"It's Jack's humanity that keeps him from being just plain bad. Jack is the anti-hero that you just can't help but root for, especially when viewers get to glimpse Jack's vulnerability.\" On Jack's rivalry with Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), Allison Waldman of AOL TV said: \"After all, their characters' on screen feud has been the stuff of soap legend. Victor and Jack have shared wives, corporations, but mostly, unabashed hatred. They despise each other.\" In July 2020, Bergman's casting was cited as the best all-time recast on a soap opera, by Soaps.com. Bergman has been nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series 16 times from 1990 to 2002, 2007 to 2008, and most recently again in 2010 winning four awards overall in 1991, 1992 and 2002. ==References== Category:The Young and the Restless characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1980 Category:Fictional business executives Category:Fictional United States Army personnel Category:Fictional United States senators Category:Fictional Vietnam War veterans Category:Fictional drug addicts Category:American male characters in television Category:Fictional businesspeople ",
