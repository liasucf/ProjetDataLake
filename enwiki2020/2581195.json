    "text": "Gary Marx (born Mark Frederick Pearman) (born 18 June 1959) is a founding member of British rock band The Sisters of Mercy and its lead-guitarist and songwriter from 1980 to 1985. He left the band in 1985 to form Ghost Dance, which included ex-Skeletal Family vocalist Anne-Marie Hurst. They released two albums and embarked on a number of extensive tours enjoying relative success. However, record-company politics and inconsistency in personnel left the outfit reeling and they had disbanded by the end of 1989. From 1997 to 2005, he worked as a teacher at Paul McCartney's Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. He subsequently released material as an independent artist through his own website and set up an archive for his previous band, Ghost Dance. In 2003, Marx released his first solo album, Pretty Black Dots. In 2007, he released the Nineteen Ninety Five and Nowhere album, with material originally written by him in 1995 for The Sisters of Mercy, at the invitation of Andrew Eldritch. == Discography == * \"The Damage Done\" (1980) (vocals, guitars, songwriting) \u2013 Single with The Sisters of Mercy * \"Body Electric\" (1982) (guitars) \u2013 Single with The Sisters of Mercy * \"Alice\" (1982) (guitars) \u2013 Single with The Sisters of Mercy * \"Anaconda\" (1983) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 Single with The Sisters of Mercy * \"Alice EP\" (1983) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 EP with The Sisters of Mercy * \"Temple of Love\" (1983) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 Single with The Sisters of Mercy * \"Body and Soul\" (1984) (guitars) \u2013 EP with The Sisters of Mercy * \"Walk Away\" (1984) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 Single with The Sisters of Mercy * \"No Time to Cry\" (1985) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 Single with The Sisters of Mercy * First and Last and Always (1985) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 Album with The Sisters of Mercy * \"River of No Return\" (1986) (guitars, drum programming, songwriting) \u2013 EP with Ghost Dance * \"Heart Full of Soul\" (1986) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 Single with Ghost Dance * \"The Grip of Love (Suite in D minor)\" (1986) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 EP with Ghost Dance * \"A Word to the Wise\" (1987) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 Single with Ghost Dance * Gathering Dust (1988) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 Compilation album with Ghost Dance * \"Introducing Ghost Dance\" (1989) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 EP with Ghost Dance * \"Down to the Wire\" (1989) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 Single with Ghost Dance * Stop the World (1989) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 Album with Ghost Dance * \"Celebrate\" (1989) (guitars, songwriting) \u2013 Single with Ghost Dance * Some Girls Wander by Mistake (1992) (vocals, guitars, songwriting) \u2013 Compilation album with The Sisters of Mercy * A Slight Case of Overbombing (1993) (guitars) \u2013 Compilation album with The Sisters of Mercy * \"Butter Fingers\" / \"Like Low Life\" (2002) (vocals, all instruments, songwriting) \u2013 Solo single * Pretty black dots (2002) (vocals, all instruments, songwriting) \u2013 Solo album * Nineteen Ninety Five and Nowhere (demo) (2002) (vocals, all instruments, songwriting) \u2013 Solo demo * Nineteen Ninety Five and Nowhere (2008) (vocals, all instruments, songwriting) \u2013 Solo album ==References== ==External links== * Gary Marx official * Ghost Dance official Category:English rock guitarists Category:British post-punk musicians Category:Gothic rock musicians Category:The Sisters of Mercy members Category:Living people Category:1958 births ",
