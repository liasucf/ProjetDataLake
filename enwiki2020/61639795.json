    "text": "First Lady of Cuba is de facto title of the spouse of the president of the Republic of Cuba. The title of first lady is purely ceremonial, and the first lady holds little to no influence on the politics of Cuba. Although the spouse of the president of Cuba is commonly referred to as the \"first lady\", no such official position exists in the Cuban government, since there was no tradition of referring to the wife of a Cuban president as a \"first lady\" until 1913. The position was regarded as a \"remnant of capitalism\" and fell into disuse during the rule of Fidel Castro. In 2018, Lis Cuesta, the spouse of President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, became the first woman to assume the role under Cuba's socialist government. The current first lady of Cuba is Lis Cuesta Peraza, the second wife of President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel. == References == Cuba * ",
