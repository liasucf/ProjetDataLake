    "text": "Belonging is an album by American pianist Keith Jarrett which was released on the ECM label in 1974. It is the first album by the so-called Jarrett's 'European Quartet' featuring Jan Garbarek, Palle Danielsson and Jon Christensen. \"Long As You Know You're Living Yours\" serves as the theme song for CBC Radio's Writers and Company program. == Reception == AllMusic reviewer Richard S. Ginell awarded the album 4\u00bd stars, stating, \"The record operates at its strongest level when Jarrett locks the quartet into his winning gospel mode on \"'Long as You Know You're Living Yours\" and the tense drive of \"Spiral Dance\"; the reflective numbers are less compelling. Still, this LP-turned-CD successfully bucked the powerful electric trends of its time and holds up well today.\"Ginell, R. AllMusic Review accessed September 12, 2011 == Controversy and legal dispute == The tune \"Long As You Know You're Living Yours\" was the subject of a lawsuit between Jarrett and jazz-rock group Steely Dan: Jarrett alleged that the duo's title track from their 1980 album Gaucho had stolen from the song. Co-writer Donald Fagen later admitted he'd loved the song and was strongly influenced by it. Jarrett sued for copyright infringement and was then added as a co-author of the song. == Track listing == :All music composed by Keith Jarrett # \"Spiral Dance\" \u2013 4:11 # \"Blossom\" \u2013 12:15 # \"'Long as You Know You're Living Yours\" \u2013 6:14 # \"Belonging\" \u2013 2:15 # \"The Windup\" \u2013 8:27 # \"Solstice\" \u2013 13:13 == Personnel == *Keith Jarrett \u2013 piano *Jan Garbarek \u2013 tenor and soprano saxophones *Palle Danielsson \u2013 bass *Jon Christensen \u2013 drums == Technical Personnel == * Jan Erik Kongshaug - Recording Engineer * Tadayuki Naito - Cover Design and Layout * Manfred Eicher - Production == References == Category:Keith Jarrett albums Category:Jan Garbarek albums Category:1974 albums Category:ECM Records albums Category:Albums produced by Manfred Eicher ",
