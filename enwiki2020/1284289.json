    "text": "frame Antiwar.com is a website which describes itself as devoted to \"non- interventionism\" and as opposing imperialism and war. It is a project of the Randolph Bourne Institute. The website states that it is \"fighting the next information war: we are dedicated to the proposition that war hawks and our leaders are not going to be allowed to get away with it unopposed and unchallenged.\"Cf. \u201cWho We Are\u201d, Antiwar.com (Randolph Bourne Institute, 2010) (April 21, 2010). ==History== The site was founded in December 1995, as a response to the Bosnian war. It is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation, operating under the auspices of the Randolph Bourne Institute, based in Atherton, California. It was previously affiliated with the Center for Libertarian Studies and functioned before that as an independent, ad-supported website.For more historical information, see \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d, Antiwar.com (Randolph Bourne Institute, 2010) (April 22, 2010). In 2011, the site discovered it was being monitored by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Justin Raimondo, The FBI vs. Antiwar.com: Secret documents reveal government spy-and-smear campaign, Antiwar.com, August 22, 2011. After their Freedom of Information Act request failed to produce results, they worked with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California which in May 2013 filed a freedom of the press lawsuit for full FBI records on Antiwar.com, Eric Garris and Justin Raimondo.Ryan J. Reilly, AntiWar.com Editors Sue Over FBI Surveillance, The Huffington Post, May 21, 2013.Julia Harumi Mass, Staff Attorney, Sloppy FBI Work Leads to Spying on Journalists, American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California press release, November 6, 2013. The documents received in November 2013 indicated that the FBI in San Francisco, and later in Newark, New Jersey, began monitoring the site after Eric Garris passed along to the FBI a threat to hack the Antiwar.com website. The FBI mistakenly took this as an actual threat against its own website and began monitoring Antiwar.com and its editors.Spencer Ackerman, FBI monitored anti-war website in error for six years, documents show, The Guardian, November 6, 2013.DOJ documents show FBI monitoring of antiwar.com (Documents), The Guardian, November 6, 2013. Eric Garris demanded the FBI correct its file.Kelley Vlahos, Antiwar.com Editor Demands FBI File Fix, American Conservative, November 15, 2013. In September 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FBI must delete its memo documenting Garris' First Amendment activities. ==Stance== The site's first objective \"was to fight against intervention in the Balkans under the Clinton presidency.\" It \"applied the same principles to Clinton's campaigns in Haiti and Kosovo and bombings of Sudan and Afghanistan.\" Antiwar.com opposed the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and generally opposes interventionism, including the US bombing of Serbia and continuing occupation of Afghanistan. It has also condemned aggressive military action and other forms of belligerence on the part of other governments, as well as what contributors view as the fiscal and civil liberties consequences of war.\u201cWho We Are\u201d, Antiwar.com (Randolph Bourne Institute, 2010) (April 21, 2010). Wen Stephenson of The Atlantic described the site as marked by \"a decidely right-wing cast of thought.\"Wen Stephenson, \u201cNot Your Father\u2019s Antiwar Movement,\u201d The Atlantic Online (Atlantic Monthly, April 14, 1999) (April 21, 2010).
