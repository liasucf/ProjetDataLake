    "text": "Vual, by Louis Le Breton, 1863 In demonology, Vual is a mighty Great Duke of Hell, commanding thirty-seven legions of demons. He gives the love of women, causes friendship between friends and foes, and tells things past, present and to come. Vual is depicted as a dromedary that after a while changes shape into a man, and speaks the Egyptian language, but not perfectly, with a deep voice. Other spellings: Uvall, Voval, Vreal, Wal, Wall. ==See also== * The Lesser Key of Solomon * Discoverie of Witchcraft by Reginald Scot, published 1585. ==Sources== * S. L. MacGregor Mathers, A.
