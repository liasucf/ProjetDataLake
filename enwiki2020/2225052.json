    "text": "The International Symmetry Society (\"International Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Symmetry\", abbreviated name SIS) is a non-profit organization registered in Hungary (Budapest, V\u00e1rmegye u. 7. II. 3., H-1052). Its main objectives are: # to bring together artists and scientists, educators and students devoted to, or interested in, the research and understanding of the concept and application of symmetry (asymmetry, dissymmetry); # to provide regular information to the general public about events in symmetry studies; # to ensure a regular forum (including the organization of symposia, and the publication of a periodical) for all those interested in symmetry studies. The topic was introduced for the first time by Russian and Polish scholars. Then in 1952, Hermann Weyl published his fascinating book Symmetry,Hermann Weyl, 1952. Symmetry. Princeton University Press. which was later translated into 10 languages. Since then, it became an attractive subject of research in various fields. A variety of manifestations of the principle of symmetry in sculpture, painting, architecture, ornament, and design, in organic and inorganic nature has been revealed; the philosophical and mathematical significance of this principle has been studied. During the 1980's the discussions concerning the nature of the world, whether it was essentially probabilistic or naturally geometric, revived the interest of the researchers to the topic. The intellectual atmosphere of this period facilitated the idea of establishment of a new institution devoted to the study of all forms of complexity and patterns of symmetry and orderly structures pervading science, nature and society, that ultimately led to the establishment of the International Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Symmetry. The Society's community comprises several branches of science and art, while symmetry studies have gained the rank of an individual interdisciplinary field in the judgement of the scientific community. The Society has members in all continents, in over forty countries. The Society was founded in 1989 following a successful international meeting in Budapest. It has operated continuously since its foundation, publishing printed and web journals and hosting an International Congress and Exhibition entitled Symmetry: Art and Science every three years: * 1989 in Budapest, Hungary * 1992 in Hiroshima, Japan * 1995 in Washington DC, US * 1998 in Haifa, Israel * 2001 in Sydney, Australia * 2004 in Tihany, Hungary * 2007 in Buenos Aires, Argentina * 2010 in Gm\u00fcnd, Austria * 2013 in Crete, Greece * 2016 in Adelaide, Australia *2019 in Kanazawa, Japan Interim full conferences have been held in * Tsukuba Science City (co- organized with Katachi no kagaku kai, Japan), 1994 and 1998 * Brussels (2002) * Lviv [Lemberg] (2008) * Krak\u00f3w and Wroclaw (2008). A new series of conferences under the general heading Logics of Image have been launched on 2013, planned to take place every two years. This series is co-organised with the Research Group on Universal Logic: * ISSC 2016: Logics of Image - Visualization, Iconicity, Imagination and Human Creativity, in Santorini, Greece * ISSC 2018: Logics of Image - Visual Learning, Logic and Philosophy of Form in East and West, in Crete, Greece The President of the International Society for the Interdisciplinary Study of Symmetry is D\u00e9nes Nagy. The Society is governed by a number of special Boards and Committees. The International Advisory Board consists of: * Rima Ajlouni (United States of America) * Alireza Behnejad (UK), * Beth Cardier (Australia) * Oleh Bodnar (Ukraine), * Beth Cardier (Australia), * Liu Dun (China), * Shozo Isihara (Japan), * Ritsuko Izuhara (Japan), * Eugene Katz (Israel), * Patricia Mu\u00f1oz (Argentina, representing SEMA), * Janusz R\u0119bielak (Poland), * Vera Viana (Portugal). * Dmitry Weise (Russia).
