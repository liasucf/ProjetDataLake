    "text": "Aurorae Chaos is a region of chaos terrain on Mars at the eastern end of the outflow channels from Valles Marineris into Chryse Planitia, centered at approximately ~324\u00b0E, 9\u00b0S.http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA14376 It is in the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle. Many layers are visible in the walls of Aurorae Chaos. Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers. A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.). 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM.
