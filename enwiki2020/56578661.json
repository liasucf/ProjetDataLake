One of Venezuela's most celebrated singers, she performed in concert halls throughout Latin America and Europe. ==Early life, education and family== Born in Caracas on 11 October 1912, Alem\u00e1n began to play the piano when she was six. Her vocal talents were recognized from an early age, especially when she reached her teens. She studied at the Escuela de M\u00fasica y Declamaci\u00f3n in Caracas before training in New York under Fausto Cleva and, in particular, Alfredo Hollander in Caracas. In her early twenties, Alem\u00e1n married the American cellist Mario Di Polo whom she met in New York when she was 22. They remained married until he died in 1975. The couple had three children: Reinaldo, a scientific researcher; Mario, a violinist, and Frank, a trumpeter. ==Career== Her first recording, on the RCA Victor label, was made in New York while her first public performance was in 1936 at Caracas's Teatro Municipal. It was also here she sang her first opera, Pergolesi's La serva padrona. She went on to perform leading roles in Verdi's Rigoletto and La Traviata. From 1950, her concert tours reached North America, Brazil and Europe. She performed in the United States, in Rio de Janeiro, and in 1951 in the Caribbean.
