    "text": "Duhamel is a town and municipality in the Outaouais region of Quebec, Canada. It is the largest municipality in surface area in the Papineau Regional County Municipality. Its western portion consists mostly of undeveloped Laurentian Hills, part of the Papineau-Labelle Wildlife Reserve. The town itself is located along the Petite-Nation River between Lake Simon and Lake Gagnon. ==History== In the mid 19th century, the area's forests were being exploited. Duhamel, which used to be called Preston, formed shortly after when its first settlers were assigned land, while logging continued to be the dominant factor for its colonization. By 1880, a post office existed bearing the name Duhamel, named in honour of Joseph-Thomas Duhamel (1841\u20131909), second bishop of Ottawa from 1874 to 1909. In 1888, the Mission of Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel opened. In 1892, the Township of Preston was formed (named after Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, Baron of Preston, and governor general of Canada from 1888 to 1893). Starting in 1925, the Singer Company, best known for its sewing machines, built a railway through Duhamel linking Thurso to Lake Montjoie (in Lac-Ernest unorganized territory). The railroad was used until 1980 when it was dismantled and converted to a tourism corridor. On August 15, 1936, the Municipality of Duhamel was formed when it separated from the United Township Municipality of Hartwell-et-Preston. On December 21, 1985, Duhamel annexed a portion of the unorganized territories of Lac-du-Sourd and Lac-des-\u00c9corces, and again on October 10, 1998, it annexed the northern portion of Lac-des- \u00c9corces. ==Demographics== Mother tongue: * English as first language: 5.8% * French as first language: 90.7% * English and French as first language: 1.2% * Other as first language: 1.2% ==Local government== List of former mayors: * T\u00e9lesphore Tremblay, 1936 \u2013 1941 * Lionel Ethier, 1941 \u2013 1949 * Ren\u00e9 Pilon, 1949 \u2013 1950 * Fr\u00e9r\u00e9ole Filion, 1950 \u2013 1951 * Arthur Lamontagne, 1951 \u2013 1954 * Lionel \u00c9thier, 1954 \u2013 1955 * Camille Poliquin, 1955 \u2013 1976 * Jean Turcot, 1976 \u2013 1979 * Martial Bri\u00e8re, 1979 \u2013 1981 * Yvon J\u00e9r\u00f4me, 1981 \u2013 1985 * Phil Patry, 1985 \u2013 1997 * Yvon Charlebois, 1997 \u2013 2005 * Richard Chartrand, 2005 \u2013 2009 * David Pharand 2009 - ==References== ==External links== * Category:Incorporated places in Outaouais Category:Municipalities in Quebec ",
