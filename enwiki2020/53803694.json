He is most known for his applications of computational intelligence and machine learning to bioinformatics, computational biology, and industrial optimization. == Early life and education == Fogel was born and raised in La Jolla, California, graduating from La Jolla High School. He received a B.A. in biology with a minor in geology from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1991. He earned a Ph.D. in biology from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1998. == Research == Fogel has published over 140 peer-reviewed publications in conferences and journals and 3 edited books. Between 2010-2018 he was editor-in-chief of the Elsevier journal BioSystems, and is an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence.http://cis.ieee.org/ieee-transactions-on-emerging-topics-in- computational-intelligence/675--ieee-transactions-on-emerging-topics-in- computational-intelligence-editor-and-associate-editors.html He previously served as a founding associate editor for IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, and as an associate editor for IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation. Within the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society, Fogel founded the Bioinformatics and Bioengineering Technical Committee and has served as Vice President, Conferences. He established the IEEE Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology conference series, chairing the first two meetings in 2004 and 2005 in San Diego.http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dr-gary- fogel-chairs-the-inaugural-2004-ieee-symposium-on-computational-intelligence- in-bioinformatics-and-computational-biology-74341687.html He was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2012 for contributions to computational intelligence and its application to biology, chemistry, and medicine. He received the IEEE Computational Intelligence Meritorious Service Award in 2016. He is also a member of Sigma Xi and was awarded the Sigma Xi San Diego Chapter Award for Distinguished Science.
