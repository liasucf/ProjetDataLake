He was also the first archivist of Ontario, from 1903 to 1935. Fraser emigrated to Canada in 1886, where he found work as a journalist at the Toronto Mail, later the Toronto Mail and Empire. He would later become the city editor in 1889 and resigned in 1898. He was also an editor of several Canadian periodicals, including Massey's Illustrated, The Scottish Canadian, The Presbyterian Review, and Fraser's Scottish Annual. Also a Presbyterian preacher, Fraser was also involved at the University of Toronto's Knox College, where he lectured in Celtic history, taught Gaelic as well as preached. He also taught history at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. ==Early life== Fraser was born on 2 November 1860 in Kineras, Invernesshire, Scotland; his parents were Hugh Fraser and Mary Mackenzie. He went on to study at Davidson's Classical Academy in Perth, and later at Glasgow University. == Career and public life == Fraser served as honorary aide-de-camp during the administrations of Sir John Hendrie, Lionel Herbert Clarke, Henry Cockshutt and W. D. Ross. Fraser was appointed the first Provincial Archivist of Ontario in June 1903. In this role he prepared the First Report of the Bureau of Archives for the Province of Ontario in 1904 which set out his vision for the archives and included the first inventory of documents held by various governmental departments. Fraser helped form the 48th Highlanders of Canada of Toronto in 1891. He was also heavily involved in Scottish fraternal organizations in Toronto. At various points in his life he was president of the Gaelic Society, the St. Andrew's Society, The Burns Literary Society of Toronto, the Toronto Shinty Club, the Canadian Fraternal Association, the Clan Fraser Society of Canada and the Toronto-Inverness-Shire Association as well as the Empire Club. He was the Grand Chief of the Sons of Scotland for 14 years and also sponsored the Scottish Games in Canada. During World War I, Fraser was active in Red Cross Relief work. He was also an honorary colonel of the 127th York Rangers and also a Mason, both a Master of St. John's Lodge and an Officer of The Grand Lodge. Fraser was, unsurprisingly, heavily involved in preserving and commemorating the colonial history of the province, although he also took an interest in the history of Indigenous communities in the region. In addition to providing advice on writing the history of Ontario's townships, he was also a strong advocate for the creation of public memorials to key historical figures, including the Samuel de Champlain statue in Orillia. and the Jesuit's Shrine at Midland. Fraser was a respected scholar of Gaelic, Celtic literature and historian. He published a Gaelic grammar, as well as scholarly work on Celtic philology, poetry, Ultonian hero ballads, and Highland and Irish antiquities. == Selected publications == * Fraser, Alexander.
