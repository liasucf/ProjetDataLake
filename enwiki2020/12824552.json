Its main character, Tomasz P\u0142achta, is a master in complicating not only his life, but also the lives of people around him. The sequel to this novel, Socjopata w Londynie (Sociopath in London), published in August 2007, follows the life of Tomasz in London. In July 2008 his third novel, Klub samob\u00f3jc\u00f3w (The Suicide Club) was published. In a review of the book, Piotr Kofta wrote: 'Koziarski's new book shows that the Polish popular literature now chooses topics so far covered by the \"high literature\"'. Koziarski also wrote a story Dziewi\u0119\u0107 \u017cy\u0107 kota Alberta (The Nine Lives of Albert the Tomcat) for an anthology that appeared in October 2008; he is now working on the third and final book of his 'Sociopath' series. ==Bibliography== Novels: *K\u0142opoty to moja specjalno\u015b\u0107, czyli kroniki socjopaty (Troubles are my specialty: Chronicles of a Sociopath) (2007) *Socjopata w Londynie (A Sociopath in London) (2007) *Klub samob\u00f3jc\u00f3w (Suicide Club) (2008) Participation in anthologies: *Opowiadania pod psem i kotem (2008) == References == ==External links== * - Blog Daniela Koziarskiego (in Polish) Category:1979 births Category:21st-century Polish novelists Category:Polish male novelists Category:Living people Category:21st-century Polish male writers ",
