The album debuted and peaked at No. 160 on the Billboard 200 and No. 43 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album contained almost an equal number of new songs, written by Ashanti herself, and covers of Christmas classics. As for singles, Ashanti released a Christmas Medley which featured the songs \"Christmas Time Again\", \"The Christmas Song\", and \"Hey Santa\". A video was shot for the medley and it received moderate rotation on BET and MTV. A reworked version of the original song \"Time of Year\" would later appear on Ashanti's second Christmas album, A Wonderful Christmas with Ashanti. ==Track listing== ==Credits== * Ashanti \u2013 vocals *Producers: Irv Gotti, Demi McGhee, Chink Santana *Executive producers: Ashanti Douglas, Irv Gotti *Engineer: Milwaukee Buck *Mixing: Duro, Irv Gotti *Mastering: Tom Coyne *A&R;: Chris G.O.T.T.I., Darcell Lawrence, Patrick \"Plain Pat\" Reynolds, Errol \"Eezie\" Vaughan Jr. *A&R; assistance: Fred Moore, Todd \"Shortma\" Simms *Recording director: Tony Vanias *Instrumentation: Demi McGhee *Assistant: Terry \"Murda Mac\" Herbert *Marketing: Daniel Cooper, Deidre Graham *Creative director: Rick Patrick *Art direction: Andy West *Cover photo: Daniela Federici *Inlay photography: Graham Kuhm ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2003) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:Ashanti (singer) albums Category:Albums produced by Irv Gotti Category:Albums produced by Chink Santana Category:2003 Christmas albums Category:Christmas albums by American artists Category:Pop Christmas albums Category:Contemporary R&B; Christmas albums ",
