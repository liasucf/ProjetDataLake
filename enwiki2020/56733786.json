    "text": "Samuel Nicholson Kane (July 2, 1846 \u2013 November 15, 1906) was an American soldier and sailor prominent in New York Society during the Gilded Age who served as the Commodore of New York Yacht Club. == Early life == Kane was born on July 2, 1846 in New York City. He was one of eight children born to Oliver DeLancey Kane (1816\u20131874) and Louisa Dorothea (n\u00e9e Langdon) Kane (1821\u20131894). His brothers were Walter Langdon Kane, DeLancey Astor Kane, John Innes Kane, Woodbury Kane. His sisters were Louisa Langdon Kane, Emily Astor Kane (who married Augustus Jay and was the mother of Peter Augustus Jay), and Sybil Kent Kane. He was the grandson of Walter Langdon and Dorothea (n\u00e9e Astor) Langdon and the great-grandson of John Jacob Astor. He was a cousin of Lt. Col. John Jacob Astor IV. His paternal lineage descended from John O'Kane who emigrated to the country in 1752 from County Londonderry and Antrim, Ireland. During the American Revolutionary War, O'Kane (who dropped the \"'O\" once in America) was living at Sharyvogne, his estate in Dutchess County, which was confiscated after the War due to his Loyalist times. His eldest son, John Jr., stayed and became one of the most prominent merchants in New York. The family lived at \"Beach Cliffe\", designed by Detlef Lienau, which was one the earliest Newport cottages \"to attain a sort of Beaux-Arts purity.\" After prep school in New York, Kane attended and graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1866. After his service in the Navy, he entered Cambridge University in England where he graduated in 1873. After returning the United States, he studied law at Albany Law School. ==Career== After the Naval Academy, Kane was assigned the grade of ensign and began working on the staff of Admiral David Farragut. He resigned from the U.S. Navy in 1868. After the Navy, he attended university in England then returned to the United States for law school, and was admitted to the bar. Even though he was admitted, due to his \"ample means\", he did not practice his profession. In 1874, he became a member of the New York Yacht Club, where he served as Commodore and an officer for many years. During the beginning of the Spanish\u2013American War, he volunteered as an Ensign and in ten days, was promoted to Senior Lieutenant, serving on the staff of Admiral Charles Dwight Sigsbee, serving until the end of the war. Kane was honorably discharged on November 15, 1898. ===Society life=== In 1892, Kane, along with two of his brothers and their wives, were included in Ward McAllister's \"Four Hundred\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. He was a member of the Union Club, Metropolitan Club, the Knickerbocker Club, the New York Yacht Club, and the American Geographical Society. ==Personal life== Kane lived at the Kane family mansion at 23 West 47th Street in Manhattan. In 1889, he was described as: > \"He is an enthusiastic yachtsman, and is an excellent whip. He has traveled > much, is a discriminating collector of books, and is exceptionally well- > like, being very affable and a raconteur of unusual eloquence.\" Kane, who suffered from cirrhosis hepatitis, died of intestinal hemorrhages in a sleeping car in Manassas, Virginia about thirty miles from Washington, DC on November 15, 1906. He had been in Hot Springs for three weeks seeking treatment. He was buried at Island Cemetery in Newport, Rhode Island. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources ==External links== * Category:1846 births Category:1906 deaths Samuel Nicholson Kane Category:United States Naval Academy alumni Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:Albany Law School alumni Category:People included in New York Society's Four Hundred Category:Kane family ",
