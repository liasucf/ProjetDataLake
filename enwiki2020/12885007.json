Raymond Hart DSC, an experienced and successful ASW officer. In January Conn and 21 EG were operating as escort or support group to various Atlantic convoys; one of these, HX 332 came under attack, losing two ships, but despite an extensive hunt the U-boat (U-825) was not found. In March 1945 Conn and 21 EG were assigned to patrol the north-east coast of Scotland; during this period the group found and destroyed four U-boats, with Conn being credited with two of these. After the German surrender in May 1945 Conn moved to general duties, and with the final end of the war in August 1945 was prepared for return under the Lend-Lease agreement, to the United States for eventual disposal.Operations of the 21st Escort Group at captainclassfrigates.co.uk; retrieved 22 July 2020 ==Battle Honours== Conn earned the following battle honours for service:Battle Honours at britainsnavy.co.uk; retrieved 22 July 2020 * Arctic 1944 * Atlantic 1944-45 * English Channel 1944 * North Sea 1944-45 ==Successes== During her service Conn was credited with the destruction of two U-boats. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
