He made his first-class debut for Worcestershire against Hampshire in May 2015. He was educated at Oundle School. Following Worcestershire\u2019s relegation to Division Two of the County Championship in 2018, he joined Nottinghamshire on a four year deal. In 2017, Clarke was included in an England Lions squad that toured Australia, scoring 45 against a CA XI in Perth. However, in May 2019, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) withdrew Clarke from the Lions' squad, after being named during Alex Hepburn's rape trial. Hepburn was found guilty of rape, and although the judge said that Clarke \"did nothing wrong\" on the night of the attack, the ECB were concerned about the disrespectful messages about women that had been exchanged. On the 21 June 2019, the English Cricket Board charged Joe Clarke and Tom Kohler-Cadmore with bringing the game into disrepute in relation to their participation in the group actions which saw Alex Hepburn found guilty of rape.https://www.ecb.co.uk/news/1252385 On the 4 July 2019, both players pled guilty to the charge and were reprimanded and fined.https://www.ecb.co.uk/news/1264569 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Shrewsbury Category:People educated at Shrewsbury School Category:English cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Nottinghamshire cricketers Category:Shropshire cricketers ",
