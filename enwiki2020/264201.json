The name \"Pe\u00f1arol\" comes from the Pe\u00f1arol neighbourhood on the outskirts of Montevideo. Throughout its history the club has also participated in other sports, such as basketball and cycling. Its focus has always been on football, a sport in which the club excels, having never been relegated from the top division. In international competition, Pe\u00f1arol is the third-highest Copa Libertadores winner with five victories and shares the record for Intercontinental Cup victories with three. In September 2009, the club was chosen as the South American Club of the Century by the IFFHS . Apart from football, other active sports sections of Pe\u00f1arol are rugby union, futsal, women's football and athletics.Otras disciplinas on Pe\u00f1arol official website, retrieved 26 Nov 2017 ==History== ===Origins=== On September 28, 1891, employees of the Central Uruguay Railway Company established the Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club (CURCC) of Montevideo, with the purpose of stimulating the practice of cricket, rugby football and \"other male sports\" (literal from the Spanish). The Central Uruguay Railway company had operated in Uruguay since 1878, with 118 employees, 72 British, 45 Uruguayan and one German. The club was known as CURCC in the neighborhood of Pe\u00f1arol\u2014the latter from the Pe\u00f1arol neighborhood, about from Montevideo, whose name in turn derived from an Italian city. The club's first president was Frank Henderson, who remained in that position until 1899. In 1892, the CURCC shifted its focus from cricket and rugby to association football. The football club's first game was against a team of students from the English high school and ended with a 2\u20130 victory. In 1895, Uruguayan footballer Julio Negr\u00f3n was chosen as the team's first non-British captain. ===First titles=== The 1905 CURCC team In 1900 the CURCC was one of four charter members of the Uruguay Association Football League, making its debut in official competition on 10 June against Albion and winning 2\u20131. The club won its first Uruguayan championship that year, repeating in 1901, 1905 and 1907. In 1906 Charles W. Bayne took over the railroad, and refused to sponsor the football team due to financial and work issues. Conflict between the company and the football club led to the severance of their relationship in 1913. In 1908, the club left the Uruguayan league after the league rejected their request to replay a game with F.C. Dubl\u00edn. CURCC had lost 2\u20133 on the road, and believed their poor showing was due to refereeing mistakes caused by pressure from rabid home fans. As a sign of good faith, Nacional also retired from the league, since both teams agreed that \" Los Partidos se ganan en la Cancha \", or the games are won in the field. Back in competition the following year, relations between the CUR and the club became frostier after fans burned a train car used for rival teams. A year after the club's 1911 Uruguayan championship, the club attempted reforms to its policies. Proposals included greater participation by non-CUR players and a name change to \"CURCC Pe\u00f1arol\". In June 1913, the proposals were rejected; the company wanted to distance itself from the club's local reputation. The railroad company, decided to separate the \" foot-ball \" section of the team from the company on Saturday 13 December 1913. That is when Pe\u00f1arol was founded. The following day it was the first time a \" Clasico \" was officially played between Nacional and Pe\u00f1arol. CURCC kept playing football in the amateurism until it was dissolved on 22 January 1915 and donated all their trophies to the British Hospital of Montevideo, not to Pe\u00f1arol. ===C.A. Pe\u00f1arol=== In 1918, the club won its first domestic title under the name \"Club Atl\u00e9tico Pe\u00f1arol\" On 12 March 1914, Pe\u00f1arol replaced CURCC's spot in the Uruguayan Football League after its foundation in 1913. A request submitted to the Uruguayan Football League two days later and approved the following day. During its first years Pe\u00f1arol was not successful, although a new stadium (Las Acacias) opened on 19 May 1916. The club won its first two league titles in 1918 and 1920. In November 1922 the Asociaci\u00f3n Uruguaya de F\u00fatbol (AUF) disqualified Pe\u00f1arol because the club played an exhibition game with Racing, an Argentine club affiliated with Asociaci\u00f3n Amateurs de Football (a dissident association established in 1919 that rivalized with the official entity, AFA). Pe\u00f1arol and other clubs then organised a new league, the Uruguayan Football Federation (FUF), and the club won the 1924 championship. The league was short-lived; Pe\u00f1arol won the 1926 Copa del Consejo Provisorio, triggering a merger between the AUF and the FUF. ===First European tour=== Players of Barcelona and Pe\u00f1arol entering the pitch before their first test, 5 June 1927 In 1927, Pe\u00f1arol made its first tour to Europe, playing a total of 19 matches against teams from Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Spain, Czechoslovakia and France. The tour extended from April to June. The first match of the tour was vs. the Vienna combined, which Pe\u00f1arol lost by 3\u20131. The Uruguayan team then played Bayern Munich (1\u20132), SpVgg (1\u20132), Hertha Berlin (0\u20131). The first win was v. Eintracht Frankfurt (3\u20131).

On June 5, Pe\u00f1arol played its first game in Spain v. FC Barcelona, losing by 1\u20135. The second test was played one day later, finishing in a tie (1\u20131). Other notable games of the tour were the two tests v. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (5\u20132 and 4\u20133). Pe\u00f1arol played a total of 19 matches in 80 days (6 in Spain, 5 in Germany, 4 in Switzerland and 1 in Czechoslovakia and France), totalizing 7 wins, 4 draws and 8 losses. The team scored 32 goals and received 33, with Antonio Sacco being the topscorer with 9 goals.\"Rescatando la gira europea de 1927\", originally published on different newspapers such as El Gr\u00e1fico, Mundo Deportivo, ABC Madrid, La Vanguardia, La Esfera, Le FIgaro, Le Petit Parisien, La Tribune de Lausanne After its first European tour in 1927, Pe\u00f1arol won the Uruguayan championship in 1928 and 1929; the following year, the club defeated Olimpia 1\u20130 in its first game at the Centenario Stadium in Montevideo. ===Consolidation=== The 1928 Pe\u00f1arol team, Primera Divisi\u00f3n champions In 1932, Pe\u00f1arol and River Plate played the first game of the professional era.

The club stayed in second place until 1944, when Pe\u00f1arol again won the Uruguayan Championship (defeating Nacional in a two-game final, 0\u20130 and 3\u20132). In 1945 the club retained the title, with Nicol\u00e1s Falero and Ra\u00fal Schiaffino the top goal scorers of the playoffs with 21 apiece. Pe\u00f1arol was again victorious in 1949, four points ahead of runner- up Nacional with \u00d3scar M\u00edguez the top scorer. After placing second in 1950, Pe\u00f1arol won the Uruguayan Championship the following year; this was also the start of the Palacio Pe\u00f1arol's four-year construction. During the 1950s, the club also won national championships in 1953, 1954, 1958 and 1959. ===International success=== Pe\u00f1arol celebrating the 1966 Copa Libertadores, the third for the club after beating Argentine club River Plate by 4\u20132 Their 1959 championship qualified Pe\u00f1arol for the recently created Copa Libertadores, an international competition then known as the Copa de Campeones de Am\u00e9rica. Pe\u00f1arol won the first two tournaments, beating Olimpia of Paraguay in 1960 and Palmeiras of Brasil in 1961. That year the club won its first Intercontinental Cup, defeating Benfica of Portugal 2\u20131 in the third game.

After a quiet year in 1963, Pe\u00f1arol won the Uruguayan Championship in 1964 and 1965 and the Copa Libertadores in 1966, defeating River Plate 4\u20132. That year the club won its second Intercontinental Cup, defeating Real Madrid 2\u20130 in Centenario Stadium and Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. During the next few years the club won national championships in 1967 and 1968 and the Intercontinental Champions' Supercup in 1969 (a tournament with South American Intercontinental Cup winners). Pe\u00f1arol had the longest undefeated run in Uruguayan league history: 56 games, from 3 September 1966 to 14 September 1968. Copa Libertadores all-time top scorer Alberto Spencer played for Pe\u00f1arol at this time. In 1970 the club again reached the Libertadores final again, losing to Estudiantes de La Plata. The club set a tournament record for greatest goal difference, defeating Valencia of Venezuela 11\u20132. With Fernando Morena as the team's star, the club won the Uruguayan championship for three consecutive years, from 1973\u201375. After placing second in 1976 and 1977, Pe\u00f1arol won again in 1978. That year, Morena set two records: most goals scored in a Uruguayan season (36) and most goals scored in a single game (seven, against Hurac\u00e1n Buceo on 16 July). The 1970s ended with another championship in 1979. Morena was top scorer in the Uruguayan tournament six straight times, and top Copa Libertadores scorer in 1974 and 1975. Pe\u00f1arol in a friendly match with Real Madrid in the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, August 2010 After beginning the 1980s with a third-place finish in 1981, Pe\u00f1arol won the Uruguayan Championship with Fernando Morena and Rub\u00e9n Paz (the tournament's top scorer).

Pe\u00f1arol players posing for photographers before 2013 Copa Libertadores preliminary game against V\u00e9lez Sarsfield Despite financial problems during the 1980s, Pe\u00f1arol won the national championship in 1985 and 1986, and a fifth Copa Libertadores in 1987. The club defeated Am\u00e9rica de Cali 1\u20130 with a goal by Diego Aguirre in the final seconds of extra time, when a tie would have gone to the Colombians on the goal differential. It was the third Copa Libertadores won by Pe\u00f1arol at the Nacional de Chile, following victories in 1966 and 1982. Banner awarded by FIFA for the club's 120th anniversary, September 2011 Pe\u00f1arol celebrated its hundredth anniversary in 1991, despite a controversy ignited by archrivals Nacional concerning Pe\u00f1arol's 1913 name change. With Pablo Bengoechea and the young Antonio Pacheco on the team and Gregorio P\u00e9rez behind the bench, Pe\u00f1arol again won the Uruguayan championship five straight times (1993\u201397). The club also reached the Copa Conmebol final in 1994 and 1995, rounding out the century with a national championship in 1999 (defeating Nacional 2\u20131 in the final, despite Julio Ribas on the bench). The next year, Pe\u00f1arol lost the Uruguayan championship final against Nacional; many of the team's players were jailed after a tournament fight. Pe\u00f1arol won the national championship again in 2003 for Diego Aguirre, defeating Nacional in the final. The club did not win another national title until the 2009\u201310 season, when it won the Clausura tournament with 14 victories in 15 games (12 of them in a row). In the Clausura final, Pe\u00f1arol defeated Nacional 2\u20131. The championship qualified the team for the Libertadores 2011, where Pe\u00f1arol reached the final with Santos. The club was congratulated on its 120th anniversary in September 2011 by presidents Joseph Blatter, Michel Platini. and Nicol\u00e1s Leoz. ==Crest and colors== ===Badge=== Throughout the club's history minor changes have been made to its symbols, but it has kept its original colors. The shield and flag were designed by architect Constante Facello and consist of five black stripes, four yellow stripes and eleven yellow stars on a black background (representing the eleven players). ===Uniforms=== The Rocket locomotive inspired Pe\u00f1arol's colors. Since its founding, Pe\u00f1arol's colors have been yellow and black. They were inspired by the Rocket locomotive designed by George Stephenson, which won an award in 1829. The first jersey was a plain shirt, divided into four square sections which alternated black and yellow. A variant had two vertical halves (black on the right and black-and-yellow stripes on the left), with black shorts and socks. Pe\u00f1arol's official jersey (black and yellow stripes) dates back to 1911 and has been worn almost continuously, with only slight variations. ===Trivia=== Pe\u00f1arol inspired Romanian club, FC Bra\u0219ov to change its official colors in December 1966 from white and blue to yellow and black. The change came following a tournament of Romania's Olympic football team in Uruguay. After a match with Pe\u00f1arol, Csaba Gy\u00f6rffy, player at FC Bra\u0219ov, received from Pe\u00f1arol's captain Alberto Spencer the shirt with which he played. Gy\u00f6rffy was fascinated by the combination of yellow and black stripes and decided at the return in the country to wear the shirt during his training sessions with the team. The decision to change the colors of the club was taken by coach Silviu Ploe\u015fteanu, who considered that, in the new colors, the team will be seen better on the field. Since January 1967, the team from Bra\u0219ov has yellow-black as official colors, recalling Pe\u00f1arol. === Kit evolution === {| | | | | |} ===Kit manufacturers=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"width:100px; | Period ! style=\"width:150px; | Company |- | 1979\u201384 || Adidas |- | 1984\u201387 || Le Coq Sportif |- | 1987\u201388 || Topper |- | 1988\u201391 || Puma |- | 1991\u201396 || Nanque |- | 1996\u201398 || Umbro |- | 1998\u201399 || Reebok |- | 2000 || Covadonga |- | 2001\u201306 || Umbro |- | 2006\u2013present || Puma |} ;Notes ==Facilities== ===Stadium=== Estadio Jos\u00e9 Pedro Damiani, used for Pe\u00f1arol's reserve matches Estadio Centenario, Pe\u00f1arol's former home ground Estadio Campe\u00f3n del Siglo, Pe\u00f1arol's current home ground Pe\u00f1arol's first stadium was the Jos\u00e9 Pedro Damiani, also known as Las Acacias. It was bought in 1913 and inaugurated on 19 April 1916 with a 3\u20131 victory over Nacional. The stadium's gate was that of the former Estadio Pocitos, Pe\u00f1arol's first stadium where the first goal in the history of the FIFA World Cup was scored in 1930. The stadium is in the Marconi neighbourhood of Montevideo. Its pitch is of , and it has a capacity of 12,000.

The new facility, which opened on 28 September 2009, includes five football pitches, a weight room and a gymnasium with artificial turf. === Frank Henderson School === The Frank Henderson School, named in honor of the club's first president, is a few kilometers away from the Centro de Alto Rendimiento. It was built to develop the club's young players, and houses those who come from other areas. ==Supporters== Fans at a match, May 2010 In Uruguayan football, loyalty to Pe\u00f1arol or Nacional divides the country. The clubs are evenly matched, and have a large fan base. Many surveys of public opinion have been conducted, but none have been conclusive. In 1993 the Factum consulting firm reported that Pe\u00f1arol was the favorite team of 41 percent of football fans, while 38 percent supported Nacional. Factum conducted another survey in 2006, confirming its previous results: Pe\u00f1arol with 45 percent and Nacional with 35 percent. MPC Consultants surveyed 9,000 Uruguayans; Pe\u00f1arol had 45 percent of the supporters, and Nacional 38 percent. An online survey on the webpage Sportsvs.com showed Nacional with 50.35 percent and Pe\u00f1arol with 49.45 percent. Since its formation, Pe\u00f1arol's barra brava has been involved in violence against other clubs and the Uruguayan police. Incidents provoked by these fans have cost Pe\u00f1arol 31 points since 1994; the penalties cost the team three tournaments (Apertura 1994, Clausura 1997 and Clausura 2002). ===Fan club=== In 2010 the club attempted to increase its fan base to improve its sustainability. During Clausura 2010 promotions were offered, marketing managers hired and the pe\u00f1as (local fan clubs) encouraged. The campaign was successful; in February 2013 the club had over 62,000 members, the largest fan club in Uruguay. ===Rivalries=== Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez taking free kick against Nacional in the second final of the 2009\u201310 Primera Divisi\u00f3n season The Uruguayan Derby between Pe\u00f1arol and Nacional goes back to 1900, the oldest football rivalry outside the British Islands. The first game ever played between Nacional and CURCC was on 15 July 1900 and ended 2\u20130 in favor of CURCC. CURCC was ahead at first, but Nacional caught up during the late 1910s. Nacional took the lead by fourteen games in 1948, and would not surrender it until the late 1970s (except briefly in 1968). Since then, Pe\u00f1arol has been the leader; its longest lead was 26 games in January 2004. Including the amateur and professional eras, league and friendly games, the teams have met 511 times in the past with 182 victories to Pe\u00f1arol, 166 to Nacional and 163 ties. A notable game for Pe\u00f1arol fans is occurred on 9 October 1949 in the Uruguayan Cup first round, and is known as the Cl\u00e1sico de la fuga (the \"escape derby\"). At the end of the first half Pe\u00f1arol was leading 2\u20130, but at halftime Nacional decided not to return. While Pe\u00f1arol fans believe that Nacional did not want to be defeated by a Pe\u00f1arol team known as the M\u00e1quina del 49 (\"Machine of 49\"), Nacional supporters claim it was a protest against poor officiating. On 23 April 1987 for a friendly game, Pe\u00f1arol and Nacional were tied 1\u20131 with 22 minutes remaining when three Pe\u00f1arol players (Jos\u00e9 Perdomo, Jos\u00e9 Herrera and Ricardo Viera) were ejected after a foul and subsequent protests. Pe\u00f1arol then had to face a full Nacional team with only eight players on the pitch. With eight minutes remaining Diego Aguirre set up Jorge Cabrera, who scored the winning goal. This win by the aurinegro was known as the Cl\u00e1sico de los 8 contra 11 (the \"8 against 11 derby\"). Pe\u00f1arol and Nacional have faced each other in the final game of the Uruguayan Championship thirteen times, with Pe\u00f1arol winning eight. The most recent was in 2018, when Pe\u00f1arol won the championship 2\u20131. ===Manyas: The Movie=== In early October 2011 Manyas: The Movie, a documentary about Pe\u00f1arol's fans, was released in Uruguay. Produced by Kafka Films and Sacromonte and directed by Andr\u00e9s Benvenuto, the film features interviews with fans, football journalists, psychologists and politicians. Manyas: The Movie was deemed of cultural interest by the Culture and Education Ministry of Uruguay and of ministerial interest by Uruguay's Ministry of Tourism and Sport. The film had the most- successful premiere of any Uruguayan film, selling 13,000 tickets during its first weekend and 30,000 over its first fifteen days. ===World's Biggest flag=== After raising $35,000 in raffles and donations, on 12 April 2011 Pe\u00f1arol fans unveiled the largest flag ever unfurled in a stadium up to that moment. Nacional unfurled a bigger one years later that covered three stands of the stadium. The flag, long and wide for a surface area of , covered one- and-a-half grandstands in Centenario Stadium. In 2013, Club Nacional de Football displayed a flag which was 600 metres long by 50 metres wide. This is now the world's biggest flag. ==Players== ===First-team squad=== ===Out on loan=== ===Noted players=== N\u00e9stor Gon\u00e7alves has the most official games in the club's history (571 matches), between 28 April 1957 and 28 November 1970. The team's all-time top scorers in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n are Fernando Morena (203), Alberto Spencer (113) and \u00d3scar M\u00edguez (107). Morena's (whose 230 goals\u2014203 with Pe\u00f1arol and 27 with River Plate\u2014make him the highest-scoring player in the Uruguayan League) 440 goals with Pe\u00f1arol are a record as well. He scored the most goals in a single Uruguayan season (36 in 1978), and is the club's second-best goal scorer in international competition with 37 goals (behind Alberto Spencer, who scored 58 goals between 1960 and 1970). Spencer and Morena are the top scorers in Copa Libertadores history, with 48 and 37 goals respectively for Pe\u00f1arol.Alberto Spencer scored 54 times in the Copa Libertadores, 48 with Pe\u00f1arol and 6 with Barcelona. Pe\u00f1arol has made a large contribution to the Uruguayan national football team. Three Pe\u00f1arol players were on the Uruguayan team which played Argentina in 1905. Five Pe\u00f1arol players were on the Uruguayan squad which won the 1930 FIFA World Cup: goalkeeper Miguel Capuccini, defender Peregrino Anselmo and midfielders Lorenzo Fern\u00e1ndez, \u00c1lvaro Gestido and Carlos Riolfo. Pe\u00f1arol had nine players on the Uruguayan squad which won the 1950 FIFA World Cup: goalkeeper Roque M\u00e1spoli, defenders Juan Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez and Washington Ortu\u00f1o, midfielders Juan Alberto Schiaffino and Obdulio Varela and forwards Ernesto Vidal, Julio C\u00e9sar Britos, \u00d3scar M\u00edguez and Alcides Ghiggia. Schiaffino and Ghiggia scored the team's two goals in the Maracanazo, the final game against Brasil. Pe\u00f1arol is the only club which has represented Uruguay in all its World Cup appearances. ==Managers== While there is no hard information about managers in the amateur era of Uruguayan football, Pe\u00f1arol has had a total of 62 coaches during its professional era. The first manager was Leonardo de Luca, who coached the team for two years and won the Uruguayan Championship (the first professional tournament in Uruguay) in 1932. Of these 62 managers, 53 were Uruguayan; two were Hungarian (Em\u00e9rico Hirschl and B\u00e9la Guttmann), two British (John Harley and Randolph Galloway), one Serbian (Ljupko Petrovi\u0107), two Brazilian (Osvaldo Brand\u00e3o and Dino Sani), one from Chile (Mario Tuane) and two from Argentina (Jorge Kistenmacher and C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti). Hugo Bagnulo and Gregorio P\u00e9rez have coached Pe\u00f1arol the longest, leading the first team for eight seasons: Bagnulo for four stints and P\u00e9rez for five.

The first president of the club was Frank Henderson, who remained in that office until 1899. After Henderson CUR administrators remained as chairmen of the sports club until 1906, when Charles W. Bayne took over the CUR. Bayne refused to sponsor the CURCC because of vandalism by fans and absenteeism by workers. He was replaced by CUR employee Roland Moor. Conflicts remained between the company and the sports club, which resulted in the separation of CURCC's football section from the company and a name change to Club Atl\u00e9tico Pe\u00f1arol. Jorge Clulow, an Englishman with Uruguayan nationality, was chosen chairman of the club; he remained in office from 1914 to 1915. ===Presidents=== * 1891\u201399: Frank Henderson * 1899\u201305: Frank Hudson * 1906\u201308: Roland C.J.

During this period Pe\u00f1arol won the Uruguayan Championship nine times, with its best years in 1900 and 1905 (when the club won the championship without conceding any points). Pe\u00f1arol was undefeated in 1901, 1903 and 1907.Moreover, in 1903 CURCC did not lose during the regular season, but lost the tiebreaker final against Nacional 2\u20133. Its worst year was 1908; the team left the league after ten games, forfeiting the other eight. Pe\u00f1arol's largest goal difference in a game during its amateur era was in 1903, when they defeated Triunfo 12\u20130. The club placed second in 1923 (when they scored a record 100 goals), and won in 1924; its most impressive victory was a 10\u20130 win over Roberto Cherry during the cancelled 1925 season. Both tournaments were organised by dissident body Uruguayan Football Federation (FUF). Since the beginning of the professional era in 1932, Pe\u00f1arol and Nacional are the only teams who have played every season for the Uruguayan championship.In 1948 the tournament was cancelled because of a player strike. Pe\u00f1arol has the most Uruguayan League titles (winning 38 times between 1932 and 2013) and the greatest number of undefeated championships (1949, 1954, 1964, 1967, 1968, 1975 and 1978). Its best performances were in 1949 and 1964, seasons when the team scored 94.44 percent of possible points; its worst season was 2005\u201306, when it finished in 16th place after winning 32.32 percent of possible points. A 12-point deduction given the team by the AUF because of unrest after a game with Cerro relegated them to that position. Pe\u00f1arol's best victory was a 9\u20130 win against Rampla Juniors in 1962; its worst defeat was 0\u20136 against Nacional. On the international scene, its best result was an 11\u20132 win over Valencia of Venezuela on 15 March 1970; its worst was against Olimpia of Paraguay, a 0\u20136 loss on 10 December 1990 during the Supercopa Sudamericana. Pe\u00f1arol holds a number of national and international records. The club has the longest undefeated run in the Uruguayan league: 56 games, from 3 September 1966 to 14 September 1968. This is also the longest undefeated run in South American professional football (second place if amateur leagues are counted). It was the first club to win the Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica undefeated, in 1960. Pe\u00f1arol has the greatest number of appearances in the Copa Libertadores (40), and the most appearances in the finals (10). The club holds the record for the biggest win (11\u20132 against Valencia), and the biggest goal difference in a two-legged elimination (defeating Everest from Ecuador 5\u20130 and 9\u20131). Pe\u00f1arol is one of the teams with five Intercontinental Cup appearances, the first to reach that number. ==Honours== ===National=== * Primera Divisi\u00f3n (AUF) (50): 1900, 1901, 1905, 1907, 1911; 1918, 1921, 1928, 1929, 1932, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1944, 1945, 1949, 1951, 1953, 1954, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1985, 1986, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2003, 2009\u201310, 2012\u201313, 2015\u201316, 2017, 2018 * Primera Divisi\u00f3n (FUF/CP) (2): 1924 FUF, 1926 CP * Supercopa Uruguaya (1): 2018 ===International=== * Intercontinental Cup (3): 1961, 1966, 1982 * Copa Libertadores (5): 1960, 1961, 1966, 1982, 1987 * Intercontinental Champions' Supercup (1): 1969 * Copa de Honor Cousenier (AFA/AUF)Established before CONMEBOL was created, this Cup was organized by the Argentine and Uruguayan Associations, between teams that belonged to them.

Its first league game (in the fourth division of Uruguayan basketball) was played in 1940. By 1943 the team, playing in the first division for Ram\u00f3n Esnal, finished third. The following year Pe\u00f1arol won the Federal Championship, a tournament attracting the best basketball teams in Montevideo; in 2003, the league changed its name to Liga Uruguaya de Basketball. In 1945, Pe\u00f1arol jumped from the Uruguayan Basketball Federation to play in a new league; when the upstart league failed, the club rejoined the federation in 1947. In 1952 Pe\u00f1arol again won the Federal Championship, winning the Winter Tournament in 1953 and 1955. After a low period (with relegation in 1968), Pe\u00f1arol won the Uruguayan Championship in 1973, 1978, and 1979;the latter was the first professional tournament in league history. In 1982 the club enjoyed its most successful season, winning the Federal Championship and the Winter Tournament The club also won the Campeonato Sudamericano de Clubes in 1983. In 1985 the club was relegated, beginning a downward spiral which ended with its expulsion from the league in 1997. However, the club rejoined in 2018 the Federaci\u00f3n Uruguaya de Basket Ball, in the third tier. ===Cycling=== Pe\u00f1arol has participated in the Vuelta Ciclista del Uruguay (Tour of Uruguay) since it began in 1939. Although the team rode well during its early years, it was not until the ninth edition (in 1952) that a Pe\u00f1arol cyclist would win the race (Dante Sudatti, with an overall time of 48 hours, 38 minutes and 38 seconds). Pe\u00f1arol cyclists also won the general classification 1953 and 1956; in the latter year, the club won the team championship. After again winning the team championship in 1959, Pe\u00f1arol would only win one individual championship in 1964. The team later improved, winning three individual titles in a row from 1989 to 1991 and the team victory in 1990 and 1991. 2002 was the fourth year that the club won both the individual and team classifications. Pe\u00f1arol has competed in other road races, including Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Orlando's 1990 victory in the Rutas de Am\u00e9rica. ===Futsal=== Pe\u00f1arol began playing futsal in 1968. During its first two decades, the club won on the national and international levels (including a victory in the 1987 World Interclub Championship). In 1995 FIFA took over the sport, and Pe\u00f1arol began competing in AUF tournaments. The team won the first three Uruguayan Championships (1995, 1996, and 1997), also finishing at the top in 1999 and 2004. It won another three consecutive tournaments in 2010, 2011 and 2012. ===Beach soccer=== In January 2013 Pe\u00f1arol inaugurated its beach soccer section. Diego Monserrat, goalkeeper of the Uruguay national team for many years, was the institution's first coach in this sport, while also goalkeeper Felipe Fern\u00e1ndez was the club's first captain. On the second half of the same month, Pe\u00f1arol won one of the three groups of five teams, that formed the qualification tournament to the \"Super Liga\", name given to the Uruguayan Championship of the discipline. After victories on quarterfinals and semi- finals, Pe\u00f1arol was declared champion of the tournament without the need of a final, after the other semi-final was suspended. ===Rugby=== Pe\u00f1arol have announced that they will form a rugby union section to compete in the inaugural 2020 season of the Superliga Americana de Rugby, to be start in February 2020.Superliga Sudamericana on Americas Rugby News Pe\u00f1arol Rugby will be the only representative of Uruguay at the competition.Ceibos, el equipo privado del mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares by Sergio Stuart Ol\u00e9, 28 Nov 2019Nace la Superliga Americana, un impulso vital para el rugby regional by Alejo Miranda La Naci\u00f3n, 1 Dec 2019 ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Official website *C.A.
