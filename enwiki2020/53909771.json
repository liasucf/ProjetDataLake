    "text": "Hotel Artemis is a 2018 American dystopian tech noir thriller film written and directed by Drew Pearce, in his feature film directorial debut. It stars Jodie Foster, Sterling K. Brown, Sofia Boutella, Jeff Goldblum, Charlie Day, Brian Tyree Henry, Jenny Slate, Dave Bautista, and Zachary Quinto. The plot follows Jean Thomas, a nurse who runs a secret hospital for criminals in futuristic Los Angeles. It was released in the United States on June 8, 2018 and grossed $13.3 million worldwide. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its visual style, intriguing screenplay and acting (particularly Foster's) but found the execution poor. == Plot == On June 21, 2028, a riot breaks out in Los Angeles over the city's water privatization. Taking advantage of the chaos, professional criminal Sherman attempts a bank robbery that leaves half his team dead with his brother Lev and another accomplice critically wounded. During the robbery, Lev takes a fancy pen from a well-dressed bank customer who tells Lev he is making a terrible mistake. They escape to the nearby Hotel Artemis, a secretive hospital that treats only criminals, run by Jean \"the Nurse\" Thomas. Confined inside the Hotel for 22 years by her severe agoraphobia and grief over the death of her son, Thomas adheres to a strict set of rules, including \"No weapons,\" \"No non-members,\" and \"No killing of other guests.\" Sherman and Lev are admitted while their accomplice is forcibly ejected by Thomas' assistant, Everest. Lev, given the codename \"Honolulu,\" undergoes the Hotel's technologically advanced treatment, including robot- assisted surgery and 3D printed transplant organs. Sherman encounters the Hotel's other guests: \"Acapulco,\" an obnoxious arms dealer, and \"Nice,\" an international assassin and old acquaintance. As the riot draws nearer, Thomas receives word that notorious crime lord Orian \"The Wolf King\" Franklin is en route. Thomas' preparations are complicated by the arrival of a wounded police officer named Morgan, a childhood friend of Thomas' late son, begging for help. Against Everest's warnings and Thomas' own rules, they admit Morgan. Thomas shows Sherman evidence that his brother Lev is a drug addict. Through aid from Nice, Sherman discovers the pen Lev stole is marked with the Wolf King's symbol and a concealed case carrying diamonds worth over $18 million dollars. The Wolf King has a strict policy of killing those who steal from him by dumping them in the ocean. Fearful of being discovered, Sherman prepares to fight the Wolf King's men until his brother is stable enough to move. The Wolf King arrives, having survived an attempt on his life, and is admitted, leaving his men and son Crosby in the lobby. Everest sneaks Morgan out of the Hotel after treating her wounds. Acapulco learns that Nice has been hired to kill the Wolf King; she incapacitates Acapulco and plants a bomb on the hotel's power generator. While administering to the Wolf King, Thomas discovers that he was responsible for her son's death. While the police reported he died due to an overdose, her son was killed after attempting to steal the Wolf King's car. The Wolf King paid the police to lie about her son's death and used the tragedy to recruit Nurse Thomas to run Hotel Artemis. Thomas prepares to kill the Wolf King, but is diverted when Nice's bomb disrupts the power and Lev's life support. While Thomas struggles to save Lev, Nice kills the Wolf King. Lev dies and Sherman confronts Nice, but the two are attacked by Acapulco; Sherman is shot but manages to kill him. As rioters storm the streets outside, Thomas, Sherman, and Nice make their way out of the Hotel, while Everest stays behind to stave off the Wolf King's men; Nice follows suit, covering Thomas and Sherman's escape. The two are met by Crosby, but kill him and make their way through the riot to Sherman's getaway car. Thomas decides to stay to give medical aid to the rioters, but tells Sherman of another hotel, the Apache in Las Vegas, before he drives off. Everest, the last man standing at the Artemis, turns on the Hotel's sign as Thomas walks away from the hotel. In a mid-credits scene, a shadowy figure runs across the screen, suggesting Nice may have also survived. ==Cast== ==Production== Development on the project began in November 2016, when it was announced Jodie Foster would star in the film with a script to be written and directed by Drew Pearce.

However, after making $1.1 million on Friday (including $271,000 from Thursday night previews), estimates were lowered to $3 million. It went on to debut to $3.2 million, finishing eighth at the box office. The film fell 69% in its second weekend to $1 million, finishing 14th. In its third week of release the film was pulled from 92.8% of theaters (2,299 to 163) and grossed just $72,151, marking the 28th- largest third-week theater drop in history. ===Critical response=== Jodie Foster's performance as Jean Thomas/The Nurse received positive reviews. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 58% based on 176 reviews, and an average rating of 5.76/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Hotel Artemis has a few flashes of wit and an intriguing cast, but mostly it's just a serviceable chunk of slightly futuristic violence\u2014which might be all its audience is looking for.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \"C\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the first time director and screenwriter for balancing \"absurdity, but also the consequences\". LaSalle further praised the film for \"its genuine thrills, terrific cast and strong performances.\" Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times praises the cast and the filmmakers attempt to do something different but is disappointed that the film is \"all too predictable and familiar\". Foster's performance received positive reviews and particular attention from critics. Empire's Jonathan Pile said; \"Foster gives a performance to treasure\u2014tough on the surface, but conveying an unshakeable sadness\", while Screen Rant 's Sandy Schaefer called her the film's best part and said: she naturally gets the meatiest role here as Nurse\u2014whose dry humor masks her struggles with anxiety and a past she cannot escape. Vulture's Emily Yoshida said; Foster, dowdied up and forever shuffling around from room to room, toting a portable record player and headphones, is a massive pleasing anchor amid all the more flashy bullet exchanges and flying kicks that inevitably break out. San Francisco Chronicle's Mick LaSalle said; Not enough can be said about the performance of Foster in this film. She brings to the role a quality of having seen the absolute worst in people, but also the suggestion that, as a result, she accepts them on their own terms and knows how to handle any situation. So she starts the film radiating confidence and sadness, and then, as the story wears on, a creeping sense of panic. Rick Bentley from Tampa Bay Times declared Foster's performance as Oscar-worthy and said, \u201cshe transforms herself from her world-weary face to a way of shuffling when she walks that suggests a life of pain and suffering ignored to spend more time helping others. This is one of the Oscar-winner\u2019s best and most memorable performances.*\u201d ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * Hotel Artemis on Fandango Category:2018 films Category:2018 action thriller films Category:American films Category:American action thriller films Category:American crime thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Cyberpunk films Category:Dystopian films Category:Films produced by Marc E.
