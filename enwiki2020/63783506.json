    "text": "The Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry Building, also known as the KCCI Building, is a heritage building in central Karachi, Pakistan dating from 1934. Its foundation stone was laid by Gandhi in July 1934. It currently serves as headquarters for the Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry. == History == The building was founded to serve as the headquarters of the Karachi Indian Merchants' Association, and its foundation stone was laid on 8 July 1934 by Gandhi. It was built on a plot measuring 4250 square yards, that was purchased for 114,750 rupees. Following independence, the building was the site of the first meeting of the Central Board of Directors in 1949 for the new National Bank of Pakistan. It was declared a protected heritage site on 7 September 1995. Although the exterior remains largely unchanged from its original design, the interior has been heavily modified over time. == Architecture == The building was designed by Ahmed Hussain Agha in a Mughal- revival style known as Anglo-Mughal which came into vogue in the 1920s. Most earlier buildings in Karachi relied heavily on a European style of architectures, such as the Frere Hall, Khaliq Dina Hall, and Karachi Port Trust Building. The KCCI Building is notable different from earlier civic building in the city in that it relied heavily on the Mughal style instead. Other Karachi buildings built in the same style include the Mohatta Palace, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation Building, and Hindu Gymkhana. It was made of sandstone, with some materials brought from Jaipur, in what is now the Indian state of Rajasthan. == Gallery == File:Heart of Karachi Commerce 03.jpg|The building has domes and faux-minarets that are Mughal in style File:Heart of Karachi Commerce 06.jpg|The building is made of sandstone File:Heart of Karachi Commerce 02.jpg|Mughal-inspired details File:Heart of Karachi Commerce 04.jpg|The front of the building has a large Islamic style arch == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Karachi Category:Heritage sites in Karachi ",
