C r Assoc fr Avnnc Set, Cotigr Blois p. 19 Fifty six species have been described in this genus. The type species is Selenidium pendula Giard, 1884. ==Description== All species in this genus infect marine invertebrates. ==Life cycle== These species infect the gut of polychaete worms. The trophozoites are vermiform with an apical complex. They have few epicytic folds. A dense array of microtubules lies under a trilayered pellicle. Syzygy occurs in the tail-to-tail, head-to-head and lateral positions. The gamonts are extracellular. They are foliaceous or cylindroid in shape and have longitudinal striations. The oocysts are spherical or ovoid, are 12-18 microns in diameter and their wall is 1 micron thick. They have four infective sporozoites each. The sporozoites undergo schizogony (merogony). ==References== Category:Apicomplexa genera ",
