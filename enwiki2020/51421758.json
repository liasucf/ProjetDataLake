Two elder siblings were also pentathletes, most notably his brother Alberto F\u00e9lix, a Mexican representative at 1992 Summer Olympics. His first international event came in 1994 and he went on to compete at Pan American and World Championships level, culminating in his only appearance at the Olympic Games. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, F\u00e9lix was one of the 24 competitors that took part in the men's modern pentathlon. He finished in 11th position overall with 5165 points. His best performing discipline was the 3 km cross country run, in which he finished third with a time of 9:17.66. ===Murder=== F\u00e9lix was shot following an altercation at his residence on Williams Street in Lamont, California on the night of 30 May 2006. According to the Kern County Sheriff's Department, he had been involved in an argument outside his apartment with a male described as being around 19 years old. During the confrontation, F\u00e9lix was brandishing a large stick. Once the assailant pulled out a handgun, F\u00e9lix ran into his apartment for protection and deadbolted the door, however the assailant was able to open the door enough to fire two shots inside. One of those shots hit F\u00e9lix in the back. He died of his injuries an hour later at the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield. ==References== ==External links== *Samuel F\u00e9lix at Sports Reference Category:1977 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Olympic modern pentathletes of Mexico Category:Male murder victims Category:Mexican male modern pentathletes Category:Modern pentathletes at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Murdered sportspeople Category:Mexican murder victims Category:People murdered in California Category:Deaths by firearm in California Category:Sportspeople from Sinaloa ",
