On May 22, 1832, Fort Dixon was officially named as a base by General Henry Atkinson. Because the site was centrally located between Fort Dearborn, Fort Armstrong, and Fort Clark, General Atkinson established Fort Dixon as his command post. Additionally, the Illinois militia used the ferry to transport troops and supplies across the river. Many notable soldiers served at Fort Dixon, including Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, Winfield Scott, and Zachary Taylor . == Replica == According to a Fort Dixon website , citizens interested in rebuilding a Fort Dixon replica are encouraged to contact the group for further information . == See Also == * Fort Dearborn * Fort Armstrong * Fort Clark == References == == External links == *Fort Dixon Mainpage *Welcome to Dixon, Illinois Category:Black Hawk War Category:Black Hawk War forts ",
