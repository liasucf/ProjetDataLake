    "text": "The 1972\u201373 season was Sport Lisboa e Benfica's 69th season in existence and the club's 39th consecutive season in the top flight of Portuguese football, covering the period from 1 July 1972 to 30 June 1973. Benfica competed domestically in the Primeira Divis\u00e3o and the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal, and participated in the European Cup after winning the previous league. After securing back-to-back league titles, Jimmy Hagan remained for a third year. Benfica signed Manuel Bento, Nelinho and brought back Augusto Matine. A late start to the pre-season did not hurt Benfica domestically, who started his league campaign with easy wins. However, in the European Cup, after passing Malm\u00f6 FF, they lost 3\u20130 on aggregate with Derby County in the second round and were knocked-out. Leaving only the domestic competitions to battle for, Benfica kept his winning pace and recorded win after win, despite difficult wins against Porto in November and CUF in December. Lapping the first half of the season with 15 wins in 15 games, Benfica already had an eight-point lead over second place Belenenses. Another hard-fought win followed with Beira-Mar in January, but Benfica remained undisturbed and with 23 consecutive wins, they won their 20th league title on 11 March. They were finally stopped by Porto in Est\u00e1dio das Antas on 1 April, but still a European record for most consecutive domestic wins with 29, dating back to April 1972. A week later, they also lost their domestic invincibility when Leix\u00f5es defeated them for the Portuguese Cup, ending over one-year of undefeated streak. In final part of the season, Benfica drew again with Atl\u00e9tico but remained undefeated winning 28 games in 30, setting a record for longest distance for second place with 18 points. Eus\u00e9bio with 40 goals was the European Golden Shoe for his second time. ==Season summary== Benfica started the new season as back-to-back champions and Ta\u00e7a de Portugal holders. For the third year of Jimmy Hagan, Benfica made some squad adjustments, signing a promising young goalkeeper; Manuel Bento, another right winger; Nelinho and bringing back Augusto Matine, who excelled at Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal. Hagan's staff also changed, with assistant manager Jos\u00e9 Augusto resigning, being replaced by Fernando Cabrita. The pre- season only started on 16 August because 12 players of Benfica took part in the Brazil Independence Cup, so their vacation was pushed forward. At the end of the competition on 9 July, they all returned to Benfica to play two friendlies with Sporting in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on 16 and 23 July. Benfica's preparations included the Ram\u00f3n de Carranza Trophy on 26 and 27 August, and they completed the pre-season with a tour in Indonesia.

Before the second leg, Benfica played the Cl\u00e1ssico with Porto for the Primeira Divis\u00e3o. Porto scored first and was winning by 2\u20130 until the 78th minute, when Benfica scored the 1\u20132 with the result eventually being a 3\u20132 win for Benfica. Three days later, on 8 November, Benfica was knocked-out of the European Cup after a 0\u20130 draw with Derby County. Now solely focused on the league campaign, Benfica kept their winning record in November after beating Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es, ending the month with a six-point lead over Belenenses. In early December, the team was nearly stopped by CUF, if it was not for a 90th-minute goal from Eus\u00e9bio.

Accounting for wins all the matches played, Benfica had now an eight-point lead over second place Belenenses and had scored 49 goals and conceded just five.

With a 14\u2013point lead with seven match-days to go, Benfica secured their 20th league title after 23 consecutive wins. Having already won the league, Benfica visited Est\u00e1dio das Antas on 1 April, to play Porto. They drew 2\u20132 after an controversial late penalty signalled by Ant\u00f3nio Garrido, stopping their winning run. Still, Benfica had set a European record for consecutive wins in domestic league.
