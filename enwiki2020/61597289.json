    "text": "The Yadkin Church is a historic church building on Upper James Creek Road in rural Randolph County, Arkansas, north of Ravenden Springs. Built about 1894, it is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The main entrance is on the otherwise unadorned northeast face, and consists of a pair of paneled doors. Sash windows line the side walls, with one on the rear wall. It is the only significant surviving element of the town of Yadkin, which was a thriving farm community in the early 20th century. It was last used for regular services about 1950. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Randolph County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Churches completed in 1894 Category:Buildings and structures in Randolph County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Randolph County, Arkansas ",
