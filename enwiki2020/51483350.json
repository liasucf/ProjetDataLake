The division was composed of six regiments (1st to 6th). During the Cultural Revolution the division actively supported the local Million Heroes() while the other military unit, 29th Army Division supported the other faction Wuhan Workers' General Headquarters(). On July 20, 1967, the mutinous independent division captured and physically assaulted Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li, and sieged Mao's hotel in Wuhan. (See Wuhan Incident.) After the incident the division was immediately disarmed and relieved by 15th Airborne Corps. Under Mao's directive the division was split and joined 29th, 44th and 45th Divisions for \"training and refitting\". Its commander, Niu Huailong() was relieved from command and put under investigation. On July 13, 1968 the division was transferred to newly formed 17th Army Corps. In December 1969 the division was renamed as 51st Army Division() and by then the division was composed of: *151st Infantry Regiment; *152nd Infantry Regiment; *153rd Infantry Regiment; *Artillery Regiment. In March 1973 the division was again renamed as Independent Division of Hubei Provincial Military District after 17th Army Corps' disbandment. Since then the division was composed of four regiments(1st to 4th). In May 1976 the division was disbanded. ==References== *\u4e2d\u56fd\u5404\u7701\u519b\u533a\u72ec\u7acb\u5e08\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6cbf\u9769, https://web.archive.org/web/20160918225002/http://www.360doc.com/content/13/1205/20/1164894_334784330.shtml *\u5f90\u6d77\u4eae\uff1a\u6b66\u6c49\u201c\u4e03\u00b7\u4e8c\u3007\u4e8b\u4ef6\u201d\u5b9e\u5f55, http://www.21ccom.net/plus/view.php?aid=14523&ALL;=1 *\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u89e3\u653e\u519b\u5404\u6b65\u5175\u5e08\u6cbf\u9769\uff0chttp://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_a3f74a990101cp1q.html Category:Infantry divisions of the People's Liberation Army Category:Military units and formations established in 1966 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1976 ",
