The main change was the increase in cylinder bore from 117 mm (4.625 in) to 127 mm (5 in) and an increase in piston stroke from 133.3 mm (5.25 in) to 139.7 mm (5.5 in). This led to a corresponding increase in displacement from 7.2 liters (441 cu in) to 8.8 liters (540 cu in). The R-5 was a rough running but reliable engine. Thousands of the R-5 and its derivatives were produced, powering many World War II trainer aircraft. Its military designation was R-540. ==Applications== Cam Harrod starts his 160 hp Kinner powered Finch Model R * Fleet Finch Model R * Kinner Sportwing * Kinner Playboy * Meyers OTW * N2T Tutor * Ryan PT-22 Recruit ==Variants== ;R-5: ;R-53: ;R-55: ;R-56: ==Specifications (Kinner R-5)== ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Duxford/usaero4.htm Category:1930s aircraft piston engines Category:Aircraft air-cooled radial piston engines ",
