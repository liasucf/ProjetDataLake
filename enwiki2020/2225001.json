Itacar\u00e9 has about 27,000 residents. Out of these, approximately 50% live in the rural interior. A mixture of races - Amerindian, black and white - can be seen in the features of the natives, called \"na\u00e7\u00e3o grapi\u00fana\", whom Jorge Amado affectionately referred to as \"the captivating people of this land\". The town was founded as a Portuguese colonial settlement, originally called S\u00e3o Jorge dos Ilh\u00e9us, in 1532. The town was a notorious hangout for Dutch and Portuguese pirates during the early colonial period and later became a hub for the cocoa planting and a port for whalers. It was officially given city status in 1881. The municipality contains 41% of the Serra do Conduru State Park, created in 1997. It also contains 14.88% of the Ba\u00eda de Camamu Environmental Protection Area, created in 2002. ==Economy== After suffering a massive blight of Vassoura de Bruxa (Witch's broom) devastated the region's cocoa crops in the 1980s, Itacar\u00e9 has depended mostly upon tourism. It is a popular destination for surfers, hikers and ecotourists. The town has a series of beautiful small cove-type beaches as well as Itacarezinho and other picturesque beaches further along the coast. Itacar\u00e9 is on the edge of a national park, one of the last large expanses of Atlantic rain forest left in Brazil. The change from sleepy agrarian town to tourist hotspot has not been an easy one, however. Locals recently won a hard-fought campaign to stop land owners who wanted to charge for access to the beaches. Access to one of the most pristine beaches, Prainha, had been blocked by a hotel/condominium development called Sao Jose Eco Resort. Both Prainha and Sao Jose beaches are now accessible by foot, free of charge. Despite development in the area, it remains a hub of Bahian culture. Many tourists visit Itacar\u00e9 to take part in the local Capoeira circles and eat traditional Brazilian food. The town is flooded with revelers during New Year's and Carnival. Itacar\u00e9 has been mentioned as one of the world's top 10 best small towns ==Travel Tips== Tourists must be cautious of volunteering opportunities which charge you to volunteer, once one knows how far $1 can go in Itacar\u00e9 then things will be in true perspective. Research the prices of things in the local currency such as lodging and food etc. to get an idea, or talk to fellow travellers. ==References== ==External links== *Itacar\u00e9 official website - photos, videos * Category:Populated coastal places in Bahia Category:Municipalities in Bahia ",
