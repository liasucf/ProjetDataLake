The collaboration is building a smaller 6 metre diameter submillimeter/millimeter telescope, the CCAT-prime (CCAT-p) as a first step before pursuing the 25 metre CCAT at some (unknown) time in the future. CCAT-p will be located at the same site and share similar mission as the full sized CCAT, but naturally with reduced capabilities compared to the CCAT. ==Site== The planned site is at an altitude of , on Cerro Chajnantor of the volcanic Purico Complex, in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. CCAT would be one of the highest permanent, ground-based telescopes in the world.The Cornell Caltech Atacama Telescope (CCAT) ; University of Cologne; Accessed 28 March 2011. ==Description== Submillimeter is a type of microwave radiation that is closest to infrared in the light spectrum. The telescope is to be outfitted with a wide-field camera that is expected to map the sky 1000 times faster and with better resolution than the SCUBA-2 camera installed on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii.Renata D'Aliesio Astronomers hope telescope unlocks secrets of universe The Globe and Mail 28 March 2011 ==Construction== The CCAT consortium participating in the project includes: Cornell University; Associated Universities, Inc., University of Colorado at Boulder, University of Cologne, University of Bonn, University of British Columbia, and other universities in the U.S. and Canada. CCAT : Partners . accessed 11.11.2014 Construction was at one time projected to begin in 2015. The telescope is intended to complement the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), by discovering new sources that ALMA will follow up with highly detailed imagery.Lauren Gold $11M gift for Atacama telescope will help astronomers answer fundamental questions about galaxy, star formation Cornell Chronicle 12 November 2010 In January 2014 the Chilean government granted the use of land on Cerro Chajnantor to the CCAT consortium for the telescope and the road to the mountain summit. Cornell Chronicle: \"Chilean government grants land for giant telescope\"; 16 January 2014. Also in January 2014, the Atacama Astronomy Park was inaugurated by the Chilean government, to coordinate activities between the current and upcoming observatories in the Chajnantor region. ccatobservatory.org; \"Atacama Astronomy Park inaugurated\"; 9 January 2014. The project has had trouble finding funding, and construction of CCAT has not materialized (as of 2019).http://www.ccatobservatory.org/index.cfm/page/about-ccat/History.htm The CCAT-p telescope construction started 2017 (signing of construction contract) with first light expected 2021.http://www.ccatobservatory.org/index.cfm/page/about-ccat/History.htm The fabrication of telescope components started late 2018.http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/11/fabrication-powerful-telescope- begins ==See also== * Martha P.
