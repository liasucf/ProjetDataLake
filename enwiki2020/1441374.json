    "text": "Oblique view from Apollo 16 Hooke is a lunar impact crater that is located to the northwest of the crater Messala, in the northeastern part of the Moon. It lies about a crater diameter to the southeast of the comparably sized Shuckburgh. The low rim of this crater is moderately eroded, with the satellite crater Hooke D intruding slightly into the southeastern side. A small worn, crater is attached to the northern exterior rim. The interior floor has been flooded, leaving a level, featureless plain and a narrow inner wall. ==Satellite craters== By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hooke. {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Hooke !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Latitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Longitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Diameter |- |align=\"center\"|D |align=\"center\"|40.7\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|55.8\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|19 km |} ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
