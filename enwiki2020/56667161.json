Katowice: Kos. pp. 53-54 == Forms == There are several ways of portraying bobak in Slavic culture. Some people believed that it was a bogeyman of some unspecified features, sometimes taking the form of a white dog or a cat. In the south-eastern region of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a bobak was said to be the name of so-called odmieniec and it was considered to be a child replaced by a demoness boginka-mamunaPe\u0142ka, Leonard (1987). Polska demonologia ludowa. Warszawa: Iskry. pp. 152 What differentiated the demon from one's progeny were its taciturnity, nonmotility and the lack of appetite, at least when home- dwelers were present. Left alone at home, bobaks were voracious, liked also booze. When such a demonic child grew up, it used to be handicapped and mistrustful of people, but it happened rarely as they used to die in their infancy. According to some sources from Wielu\u0144, in turn, bobaks were mischievous dwarves, while in the region of Kutno they were believed to be small devils or diabolic children. == References == Category:Mythology stubs Category:European mythology Category:Slavic demons ",
