The Victorian Court of Appeal decided that the plaintiff was entitled to issue separate proceedings over separate publications and was thus entitled to the potential benefit of two statutory caps on compensatory damages. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Australian racehorse owners and breeders Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
