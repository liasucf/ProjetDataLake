A regular ritual of buffalo slaughter goes haywire for Kalan Varkey, when the animal breaks lose and creates havoc across the village. Fingers get pointed, the police are called in, and the entire village gets sucked into catching the errant animal. Mob mentality soon prevails. The entire village is led by adversaries Kuttachan and Anthony(who have old scores to settle) and they take the matter into their own hands. The film also focuses on subplots like the father of a bride deciding menu for next day marriage, Sophie's problematic love triangle, unemployed youth and their pathetic ennui expressed through needs for validation that becomes a burden on the community, among others.
