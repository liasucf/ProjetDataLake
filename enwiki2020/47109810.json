    "text": "Feldkirch, Austria The Luco-Meluno culture (from German Laugen-Melaun kultur) developed between the late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age in the Alps, between Trentino, Southern and Eastern Tyrol, and in the Engadin. The term, coined in 1927 by Gero von Merhart, initially included only Meluno (Melaun), a village near Bressanone. The pitcher of Luco, found at Villandro and preserved at the Museo dell'Alto Adige of Bolzano, is a typical example of this culture: it has a triangular nozzle, a decorative outer grooves, and a height of 18.3 cm ; next to the handle are two horn-shaped appendices. Always at Villandro it was found a place used for votive burnings (Opferplatz) remained in use for centuries until the Iron Age. ==Bibliography== * Walter Leitner, Eppan - St. Pauls, eine Siedlung der sp\u00e4ten Bronzezeit - ein Beitrag zur inneralpinen Laugen/Melaun-Kultur, 2 voll., Innsbruck, 1987. * G\u00fcnther Niederwanger, Ein Laugener Brandopferplatz am Schwarzsee auf dem Seeberg im Sarntal, in \u00abDer Schlern\u00bb, 64, 1990, pp. 371-397.
