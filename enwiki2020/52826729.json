    "text": "Logo of EuroSpec EuroSpec, abbreviation for European Specification for Railway Vehicles, is an initiative of several European railway companies with the aim to develop common, explicit technical specifications for train systems and components. The work program includes doors, parking noise, TCMS, seating comfort and the revision of published specifications. The jointly developed specifications support and facilitate the process of purchasing trains. These specifications are not in the competitive domain. The continued application of the EuroSpec methodology and the developed specifications support the standardization of trains and lead to higher quality, support the development of vehicle platforms and provide significant cost savings. As a basis for developing their specifications, EuroSpec partners have developed a \"Requirement Management\" manual to ensure the necessary consistency between the specifications and their quality. The work started in 2011. The functional requirements for rail vehicles of the EuroSpec specifications are used in procurement in addition to the technical specifications for interoperability,Publication of the European Union (PBEU) the EN standards and the national notified technical rules (NNTR).European Railway Agency (ERA) - The Reference Document Database (RDD) The EuroSpec consortium does not prepare \"European standards\" or \"international standards\" within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012.REGULATION (EU) No 1025/2012 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25 October 2012 on European standardisation, amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC, 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC, 2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Decision 87/95/EEC and Decision No 1673/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council EuroSpec specifications should therefore be classified as a \"technical specification\". The EuroSpecs are increasingly used as input for European Standards and Regulations. == Members == The Eurospec consortium is composed of six European railway companies and the association of railway companies in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EuroSpec partners in Europe are: * SNCF - France * Rail Delivery Group - United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland * Deutsche Bahn - Germany * Nederlandse Spoorwegen - Netherlands * \u00d6BB - Austria * Swiss Federal Railways - Schwitzerland == Vision, mission, approach and values (version 2020) == * The vision of EuroSpec is: To align passenger train operator's needs in order to reduce the whole life cycle cost of the train, shorten the delivery time and speed up the innovation cycle and the deployment of innovations. * Our mission focusses on: less resources, less diversity in specs, promote availability info, provide needs, develop expertise. * The Approach of EuroSpec is: Fill in gaps, focus on diversity & cost, speed up standardization, exchange needs to industry. * Our values are: lean, open, transparent, sharing, accept being different == Legal status and location == The EuroSpec consortium, as a merger of a number of legally and economically independent companies that remain for the temporary introduction of an agreed purpose of the operation, is not the chosen legal form and therefore EuroSpec has no official headquarters either. Informally, the headquarters of the incumbent president is the location. == Published EuroSpec Specifications == The EuroSpec consortium publishes the specifications in English only. The following have been published, some in several versions) and are free to download from the website: * Eurospec Specification for Toilets of Railway Vehicles * EuroSpec Air conditioning * EuroSpec Documentation * EuroSpec Requirement Management * EuroSpec Contact strips * EuroSpec Wheel and Brake disc * EuroSpec Sliding Steps * EuroSpec Automatic Coupler * EuroSpec Parking Noise * EuroSpec TCMS-data transfer The overview of the EuroSpecs in development can be found in the 2020 work program. Topics such as: doors, watertightness and seating comfort. == References == == External links == * Official website EuroSpec * Official EuroSpec presentation * Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) * Reference Document Database (RDD) Category:International rail transport Category:Standards organizations Category:Transport organizations based in Europe ",
