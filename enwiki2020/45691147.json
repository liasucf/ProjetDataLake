    "text": "Riverton City, St Andrew, Jamaica is a landfill site on the outskirts of Kingston. In March 2015 it was the site of a major fire, starting on 11 March. The poor air quality brought a halt to activities in Kingston, as businesses, schools and other services were forced to close down early. The Medical Association of Jamaica called on the Cabinet to tackle the public health risks, saying that at least 600 people had attended public health facilities as a result of smoke inhalation. ==References== Category:Events in Jamaica Category:Landfills in Jamaica ",
