His notable works include Neskirkja (built 1952-1957), which is often considered the first modern church in Iceland.T\u00edmam\u00f3takirkja \u00e1 t\u00edmam\u00f3tum!, Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0, 31 March 2007, p. 27 His design caused controversy. J\u00f3nas J\u00f3nsson fr\u00e1 Hriflu, one of Iceland's most influential political figures, used the design of the church as a key example as to why modern architecture had no place in Iceland, and why the more traditional and Icelandic nationalist style of Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n Sam\u00faelsson was superior. The Neskirkja Planning Committee sought out the view of renowned Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen to assess the architectural style of the building; Saarinen praised the design.Neskirkja, Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0, 6 April 1945, p. 10 In 1997, several architects and experts on architecture placed Neskirkja on their list of the ten most beautiful buildings in Iceland. P\u00e1lsson designed Glj\u00fafrasteinn, the home of Halld\u00f3r Kiljan Laxness who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955. The building is rare for being in the functionalist style while also being situated out in the nature. P\u00e1lsson also designed two lighthouses, both built in 1946:\u00cdslenskir vitar, Sj\u00f3mannabla\u00f0i\u00f0 V\u00edkingur, 1 May 1987, p. 191 Stokksnesviti just east of the town of H\u00f6fn in south-east Iceland and Malarrifsviti south of the glacier Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull in the west of Iceland. ==References== Category:Icelandic architects ",
