    "text": "Montrose ( , ) is a town and former royal burgh in Angus, Scotland. Situated north of Dundee and south of Aberdeen, Montrose lies between the mouths of the North and South Esk rivers. It is the northernmost coastal town in Angus and developed as a natural harbour that traded in skins, hides and cured salmon in medieval times. With a population of approximately 12,000, the town functions as a port, but the major employer is GlaxoSmithKline, which was saved from closure in 2006. The skyline of Montrose is dominated by the steeple of Old and St Andrew's Church, designed by James Gillespie Graham and built between 1832 and 1834. Montrose is a town with a wealth of architecture, and is a centre for international trade. It is an important commercial port for the thriving oil and gas industry. It is known for its wide thoroughfare and high street which leads to picturesque closes containing secluded gardens. The town has a view of a square tidal lagoon, Montrose Basin, which is considered a nature reserve of international importance. It is the largest inland salt water basin in the UK, and an important habitat for the mute swan. Just outside Montrose is the 18th-century House of Dun, designed by the Scottish architect William Adam and built in 1730 for David Erskine, Lord Dun, 13th Laird of Dun. ==History== ===Toponymy and early history=== Prehistoric elements are found in the vicinity of Montrose, including the Stone of Morphie located to the north.C. Michael Hogan, Stone of Morphie, 2007, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.Mitchell (1866), p. 1 The place-name is formed from the Gaelic Monadh (meaning moor) and Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory), perhaps ultimately of Pictish origin. The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by David I who founded the town around 1140 as Sallorch or Sallork.\"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council By 1178 the name had taken the form Munross before becoming Montrose.A.D Mills, A Dictionary of British Place-Names. Oxford University Press. 2003. Folk etymology attributes the origin of the town's name as \"Mount of Roses\". This is reflected by the motto on the town's seal: Mare ditat, rosa decorat. Rev. Mr. Alexander Molleson, \"Town and Parish of Montrose\", The Statistical Accounts of Scotland (1791-99), Vol.5, p. 24 (English: The sea enriches, the rose adorns) ===Medieval history=== Montrose was visited and plundered in numerous instances by Danes. In the year 980 it was sacked and razed to the ground.Mitchell (1866), p6 It was once believed that a castle existed in Montrose in the 10th century and was destroyed by Kenneth III. However the historicity of this account has been disputed.Andrew Jervise, \"Memorials of Angus and the Mearns\" In the two proceeding centuries there are no precise dates in its history. During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as Forfar and Dundee were acquired by Malcolm IV and contributed to Restenneth Priory. In 1178 William the Lion built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside. The ruins have acquired the name Red Castle. The last record of a charter there was in 1198.Mitchell (1866), p. 8 A convent dedicated to the Virgin Mary is said to have been founded in 1230 by Alan Durward but the precise location is unknown. In 1244 the town succumbed to fire. In July 1296Angus Council, \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\" during the Wars of Independence, Edward I visited the town with 30,000 of his men and stayed at Munros castle for three nights. Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King John de Balliol by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in Brechin. Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I to protect themselves and the community of the town. The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison, was destroyed by William Wallace who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight. The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. David II visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371. The Dukedom of Montrose was created in 1488. During the 15th century, the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that James IV of Scotland intervened and settled the matter. ===Modern history=== Montrose and the steeple From its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the Hanseatic League. The town imported flax and timber from the Baltic; salt, fruit and wine from France and Portugal. The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage. Park in Montrose The site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. Graham signed the National Covenant against Charles I's reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in Edinburgh in the year 1650. The final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) James Francis Edward Stuart (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour. During the 18th century the town was a major smuggling centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504 A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194. Contemporaries expected that many would emigrate at the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War but those that did leave were few. Revd Mr Alexander Molleson, \"Town and Parish of Montrose\", The Statistical Accounts of Scotland (1791-99), Vol.5, p. 32 Samuel Johnson made a tour of the town on his visit to Scotland in the 1770s. He said of it: \"...we travelled on to Montrose, which we surveyed in the morning and found it well-built, airy, and clean. The town house is a handsome fabrick with a portico. We then went to view the English chapel, and found it a small church, clean to a degree unknown in any other part of Scotland, with commodious galleries, and what was yet less expected, with an organ.\".Samuel Johnson, The Works of Samuel Johnson (1823), p. 239 View of the city in 1838 Montrose High Street during the 1870s Alexander Christie (c. 1721 \u2013 1794) was provost in the town during the 1760s and 1780s and oversaw the establishment of Scotland's first Lunatic Asylum in Montrose in 1781Angus Council, \"Provost Alexander Christie of Montrose (c 1721-1794)\" which eventually became known as Sunnyside Royal Hospital. The Asylum, initially called Montrose Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary was founded by Susan Carnegie of Charleton to treat both paupers and private patients and was originally situated on Montrose Links. It was granted a Royal Charter in 1810. In 1858 it moved to Sunnyside farm at the nearby village of Hillside. Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962. Sunnyside remained in use for the treatment of people with mental illnesses until its final closure in 2011 when many of its patients and functions moved to the Susan Carnegie Centre at Stracathro Hospital. In 1785 a subscription library for learned men was formed. Rev. Mr. Alexander Molleson, \"Town and Parish of Montrose\", The Statistical Accounts of Scotland (1791-99), Vol.5, p. 35 Before World War I the Royal Flying Corps established a base at Montrose (later RAF Montrose). On 26 February 1913, it became the first operational military aerodrome to be established in the United Kingdom. The footpath to the high street is known as the Kirky Steps. During World War II Montrose became a hub for a constant stream of international pilots from all over the Commonwealth, Poland, Czechoslovakia, America, Russia, France and other allied nations. As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire squadrons, which flew sorties over Norway and were a part of the air defences for Edinburgh. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion. Despite its coastal location presenting a danger however, large numbers of children and young mothers from Dundee were evacuated there during the period of the Phoney War. Initially numbers totalled around 2,000 but in a second wave around 1,200 more were sent.Forbes Inglis, \"An Invasion of Montrose\", Montrose Review, 20 August 2009. As was the case in many other receiving areas, the local population was concerned by the condition of the urban poor and impetigo and vermin were found on some of those evacuated. By June 1940 Montrose could no longer provide shelter. Montrose was a royal burgh until 1975.Gazetteer of Scottish Places ===Bamse=== Statue of Bamse at Montrose Harbour Montrose high street, circa 1980 Bamse (meaning teddybear in Norwegian), a St Bernard dog famed for his exploits and popular in local imagination, is buried in the town. Bamse the Norwegian Sea Dog arrived in Montrose on the Royal Norwegian Navy minesweeper Thorodd during World War II with Captain Erling Hafto, his owner, who registered him as a crew member. He saved the life of Lieutenant Commander Olav Nilsen at Dundee Docks and generally protected his fellow sailors. In stories Bamse is said to have got up on his hind legs and, at over tall, clamped his great paws on assailants to end any fight. On his death in July 1944 Montrose schools were closed and 800 children lined the route to his graveside funeral. The Bamse Project raised \u00a350,000 to erect a larger than life-size bronze statue of Bamse at Montrose Harbour. Half the donations came from Norway. The statue was created by internationally known sculptor Alan Herriot, and was unveiled by The Duke of York in October 2007. ==Governance== Montrose is represented within Angus Council by the Montrose & District Ward, from which four councillors are elected. The members elected from this ward are, as of 2012: Bill Duff (Scottish National Party), Mark Salmond (Independent), Paul Valentine (Scottish National Party) and David May (Scottish Liberal Democrats). The town is part of the Angus constituency of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which returns a Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons, at Westminster. The constituency's MP is currently Kirstene Hair of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party. Montrose is also part of the Angus constituency of the Scottish Parliament, which has significantly different boundaries to the Westminster constituency. The constituency returns a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) to Holyrood directly, and is part of the North East Scotland electoral region with regards to additional Members of the Scottish Parliament. The constituency's MSP is currently Andrew Welsh of the Scottish National Party. For the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the constituency of Angus is due to be split into two separate constituencies and Montrose will become part of the newly formed Angus North and Mearns. ==Geography and natural features== The Bridge of Dun near Montrose is surrounded by scenic greenery and secluded spots. View towards Montrose from Ferryden Montrose occupies a position on the North Bank of Montrose Basin at the mouth of the River South Esk on the East Coast of Scotland, NNE of Arbroath, SW of Stonehaven, and ESE of Brechin. The town lies NNE of Edinburgh, and NNW of London. The built-up area occupies a roughly rectangular shape long by wide, aligned in a North-South orientation. The land is relatively flat, rising gradually to around 15m elevation to the North of the town. The expanse of the town extends to the villages on its fringes; Hillside and Ferryden. It lies close to the hamlets of Lunan and St Cyrus. The rural location ensures that the air quality is good, with low levels of nitrogen dioxide and PM10.Source: Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics ===Montrose Basin=== Montrose Basin The Montrose Basin is a shallow estuary approximately three miles in diameter.N. W. H. Allsop, Breakwaters, Coastal Structures and Coastlines, Institution of Civil Engineers, 2002, Thomas Telford publisher, 520 pages It is situated where the River South Esk meets the North Sea. During the 16th century, local landowners desiring more arable land considered reducing its size, but their plans were never carried out. Rev. Mr. Alexander Molleson, \"Town and Parish of Montrose\", The Statistical Accounts of Scotland (1791-99), Vol.5, p. 26 In 1981 the Montrose Basin Nature Reserve was created. Angus Council, \"Nature Reserve Comes of Age\", 20 June 2002 The Scottish Wildlife Trust operates a modern, purpose-built wildlife centre at Rossie Braes, which offers good telescopic and televisual views of the area, and of the thousands of migratory birds which pass through the area in all seasons. In summer, one might see the osprey which hunts along the length of the Basin, or a kingfisher flitting past. The artificial sand martin bank is a hive of activity all spring and early summer. One can watch the blue tits and barn swallows inside their nests, and take in the panoramic vista of the rolling Angus countryside and hills. In October and November there are 38,000 birds using the basin. In winter, 20,000 pink-footed geese take up residence on the mudflats, feeding in the nearby fields by day, and returning to the safety of the Basin in the evening. The haunting fluting of their calls are beloved of local people, for whom the sound marks the turning of the seasons. The many feeders attract brightly coloured field and garden birds, and the occasional woodpecker. In recent years research published by Scottish Natural Heritage claimed that the population of greylag geese has fallen as a result of climate change. ===Montrose Beach=== Montrose Beach Dunes at Kinnaber, Montrose The sandy beach has been awarded a Blue Flag for its eco credentials.The Links Hotel. Retrieved on 27 August 2009. The surrounding Traill Pavilion and Seafront Splash! facilities with an arcade, a playground, a caf\u00e9 and an ice- cream stall is popular amongst locals and visitors alike. North of the town the River North Esk enters the North Sea across the beach. The Save our Sands Campaign (SOS) was set up on 26 March 2009 to raise awareness amidst concerns over the erosion of Montrose beach, caused by the \"one million tonnes of sand, swept by the tide into the harbour...removed from the local area over the past 25 years\". In 2006 150,000 tonnes was shipped to Aberdeen to fortify its dwindling beach. This was met with opposition from Montrose Golf Links who believed that the golf course built on top of the dunes, as one of the oldest in the world, should be protected. The sand dunes are becoming unstable due to increasing tides which has forced the Montrose Golf Links to consider moving elements of the golf course more inland. A major scheme of engineered coastal protection was discouraged by Scottish Natural Heritage on the grounds that it would be unsustainable and could impact a protected coastal site at St Cyrus. A film made by local broadcaster Anthony Baxter in January 2009 highlighted the issue and was designed to attract attention for urgent action and put pressure on local politicians. The group are concerned that Angus Council are not acting efficiently to halt the effects of erosion and believe a full study should be carried out. The film won the best short film category in the BFFS Community Cinema Festival in 2009. Since 2009 a team from the University of Dundee has begun assessing the coastline around Montrose in a two-year study to decide the best way of managing coastal erosion. The film titled \"SOS Montrose Dredging\" has been posted on YouTube. ==Demography== The 2001 census gave Montrose's total resident population as 10,845. This makes it the third largest town in Angus, after Arbroath (22,785) and Forfar (14,048) with Carnoustie in fourth place (10,561). Since the Second World War the population of Montrose has increased. The presence of Dundee families in Montrose during wartime convinced a number to settle there. This altered the demographics of the town and led to the building of housing estates in the 1960s. A number of people from the Polish community who had served with the British forces at RAF Montrose also settled. There is an increasing elderly population which is reflected in the profusion of nursing and residential homes and in recent plans to extend provision for sheltered housing. Angus Council, \"Sheltered Housing for Montrose\", 6 November 2001 Data published by Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics in 2008 records the population of Montrose & District as 15,013 which is around 18% of the population of Angus as a whole. Of this total 17.6% are children, 60% are of working age and 22% are pensioners. Around 12% of those who live in the town are unemployed and 14.1% of households are \"income deprived\".Source: Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; width:70%; border:0; text- align:center; line-height:120%;\" | colspan=\"12\" style=\"text- align:center;\"|Historic population of Montrose, AngusEarly population statistics (1801\u20131841) include both the Burgh of Montrose and the outlying parish |- ! style=\"background:#9cc; color:navy; height:17px;\"| Year ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1801 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1811 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1821 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1831 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1841 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1851 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1861 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1871 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1881 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1891 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1901 |- ! style=\"background:#9cc; color:navy; height:17px;\"| Population | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 7,975 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 8,955 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 10,338 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 12,055 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 13,402 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 14,328 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 14,563 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 14,548 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 14,973 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 12,883 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 12,427 |- ! style=\"background:#9cc; color:navy; height:17px;\"| Year ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1911 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1921 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1931 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1941 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1951 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1961 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1971 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1981 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 1991 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 2001 ! style=\"background:#fff; color:navy;\"| 2011 |- ! style=\"background:#9cc; color:navy; height:17px;\"| Population | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 10,974 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 10,979 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 10,196 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| No census 1941 due to World War II | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 10,762 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| - | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 10,063 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 11,214 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 11,467 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 10,845 | style=\"background:#fff; color:black;\"| 11,955 |- | colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;font- size:90%;\"| Census: 1801-2001 |} ==Education== Montrose Academy Schools include six primary schools, Lochside, Ferryden, Southesk, Rosemount, Borrowfield and St Margarets, and one secondary school Montrose Academy. ==Economy== Glaxo Montrose The economy of the town has been expanding since the end of the Second World War.
