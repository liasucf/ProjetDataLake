( version) After the annexation of the Punjab as British territory in March 1849, a new district of Adinanagar was constituted with Dinanagar as its headquarters. Gurdaspur Tehsil, a greater portion of Batala Tehsil and 181 villages of Pathankot Tehsil were included in the Adinanagar district. In July 1849 the civil and Military escorts were transferred to Batala as Dinanagar was thought unhealthy and in 1852 it became part of Gurdaspur district. The Rowlatt ACT passed in March 1919 invested the Government with extraordinary powers to suppress any kind of political agitation. A complete hartal was observed in Dinanagar along with Gurdaspur, Pathankot and Batala. S In 1920, the non-cooperation movement was started by Mahatma Gandhi due to alliance with Khilafat leader Jallianwala Bagh massacre and Rowllat Act.

It is traversed by a number of chaos and has an undulating topography. The flood plains of the Ravi and the Beas are separated from the up land plain by sharp river cut bluffs. They are low lying, with slightly uneven topography. Sand dominates in the soil structure of the flood plains, but it diminishes in both quantity and coarseness in the upland plain. The up land plain covers a large part of the town particularly. ===Climate=== There are mainly two seasons i.e. summer and winter.

The cultivable waste land is fallow or covered with bushes or jungle which may not be put to any use. Lands under that ching grass bamboo, bushes, tree crops etc. which are not included under forests have been considered as cultivable waste. As for example, all growing lands which are permanent pastures, meadows, grazing lands within the forests etc. ===Minerals=== The foundry sand is found from Dharamkot near Batala. The deposits are located 6.5 km west of Batala. The sand gives a yellowish tinge on the surface but is reddish brown at about 1 meter depth. The salt occurs in the village Pandori near Dinanagar.
