    "text": "FAB Link is a proposed France-Alderney-Britain cable link. A European project, part of a series of grid \u2018interconnectors\u2019 between mainland Europe and UK, part of the High-voltage direct current (HVDC) power interconnector system. In 2016 only one link (IFA 2000MW) connects France with the United Kingdom and one (Britned 1000MW) from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom. The project is being jointly developed by R\u00e9seau de Transport d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 (RTE) and FAB Link Limited. ==FAB Link== ===Cables=== Twin 700 MW cables giving a capacity of 1,400 MW. According to plans, 25 km AC land cables in France, landfall will be made at Siouville-Hague, 30 km HVDC submarine cables between France and Alderney. 1 km land cables across Alderney, 140 km HVDC submarine cables with landfall at Budleigh Salterton with 20 km HVDC land cables to a converter station planned to be located near Exeter Airport with some AC land cables to connect to the grid in England. Land cables carry 400 Kv AC Voltage, The submarine voltage will be 320 Kv DC Voltage. Voltage Sourced Converters (VSC) are the preferred converter technology. ===Cost and Construction Schedule === The cost is estimated at \u20ac750m. The FAB project has received funding from the European Commission through the Connecting Europe Facility of \u20ac7.235m In January 2017 applications for licences from the Marine Management Organisation, East Devon District Council and the States of Guernsey were submitted. Approval for the project is expected after Ofgem give their final project assessment decision in July 2017 with the final investment decision made in late 2017. The project is scheduled to commence construction in 2018 with a proposed completion by 2022. ===FAB Link Electricity Interconnector=== The FAB Link in Alderney is a set of cables, each 5 inches in diameter, buried 1\u20132 metres deep crossing Alderney at Longis Common. It connects to the undersea cables from France to Alderney and from Alderney to England. FAB Link Limited is a joint venture between Alderney Renewable Energy Limited and Transmission Investment LLP. Transmission Investment is a leading independent transmission business spanning origination, project development, acquisition management, financial structuring and asset management. ==By-Products== FAB will facilitate the export of electricity from Tidal Turbines in Alderney\u2019s waters. Submarine power cables need to incorporate fibre optic cables to monitor performance, which gives an excess capacity that can be used for high- speed communications. Alderney would receive rent of around \u00a370,000 per annum for the facilities they provide together with a possible reduction in electricity prices paid by consumers. ===Planning problems=== Unresolved conflicts about the appropriateness of this project to the island resulted in the delaying of controversial planning law changes in 2016. The unprecedented change of law would open the area known as the \"Green Belt\" to industrial utility development, granting FAB Link permission to lay cables across a rural part of Alderney. The retention of the preservation laws would result in the cables having to by-pass Alderney altogether. ===Controversy=== Some Alderney residents believe the character of Alderney would be ruined, damaging the island's seasonal tourism industry; protest demonstrations took place in 2016 and in July 2017 to this end. Others believe the link will assist future tidal turbine projects and financially benefit construction and energy production contractors. ==See also== * Channel Islands Electricity Grid * High-voltage direct current ==External links== * FAB Project * Transmission Capital * Connecting Europe Facility ==References== Category:Energy in the United Kingdom Category:Energy in France Category:\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France Category:HVDC transmission lines Category:Electrical interconnectors to and from Great Britain ",
