    "text": "\"Something to Sing About\" (actual title: \"This Land of Ours\"), is one of Canada's national songs, a patriotic song written by folk singer Oscar Brand that sings the praises of the many different regions of Canada. It was used as a theme for Brand's television show Let's Sing Out, which aired on CBC and CTV in the 1960s and was also the theme song for the Canadian pavilion at Expo 67.http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/expo-67-theme-song-hey-friend-say-friend There was once a movement for it to chosen as Canada's national anthem in 1965 though Parliament ultimately picked O Canada. Brand for some years used an Americanized lyric of \"Something to Sing About\" as a theme song for his Folksong Festival radio program on WNYC in New York City. It has been recorded by, among others, The Raftsmen and The Travellers. ==See also== *Anthems and nationalistic songs of Canada ==References== ==External links== * Lyrics Category:Canadian patriotic songs Category:1963 in Canadian music Category:Expo 67 Category:World's fair music Category:1963 songs Category:Songs written by Oscar Brand Category:Television theme songs ",
