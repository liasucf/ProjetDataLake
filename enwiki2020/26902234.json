It is their heartfelt concern to contribute to the unity of Christianity. The one of the goals (as it was also once again described by the Chief Apostle Jean Luc Schneider) is not to unite all Christians into a single denomination, but rather to create a climate of trust and mutual appreciation where the things that bind us together as Christians are emphasized. The main goal of the faith is the preparation for the return of Lord Jesus Christ. == See also == *Christianity in Pakistan *Persecution of Christians == References == Category:Christian denominations in Asia Category:Churches in Pakistan Category:New Apostolic Church ",
