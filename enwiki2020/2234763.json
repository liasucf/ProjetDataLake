A Colonel in the Salvadoran Army, Aguirre led two successful coups against the Salvadoran government: once in 1931 (installing General Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez in power) and again in 1944 (installing himself in power). He left the power in 1945, with the assurance that his successor in the next election would be Salvador Castaneda Castro. He was later assassinated near his home in San Salvador at the age of 87. The Supreme Court declared his term unconstitutional, even the United States did not recognize his coming to power, which deemed his regime pro- fascist.https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs- transcripts-and-maps/aguirre-y-salinas-osmin-1889-1977 == Personal Life == Osm\u00edn Aguirre y Salinas was born in San Miguel, San Miguel, on December 24, 1889.

Aguirre y Salinas acted as Director of the National Police during Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez's presidency from 1931 through 1944. In January 1932, peasants across western El Salvador took up arms against the government after legislative elections were cancelled by President Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez.Lungo Ucl\u00e9s, Mario (1996) El Salvador in the eighties: counterinsurgency and revolution Philadelphia: Temple University Press, p 114Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p 277 In what would become a massacre of 25,000 to 40,000 indigenous and communists, Aguirre y Salinas was put in charge of capturing Farabundo Mart\u00ed, one of the rebellion's communist leaders. == Presidency == Osm\u00edn Aguirre y Salinas. On May 9, 1944, Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez resigned due to an attempted coup, strikes being conducted against his government, and pressure from the United States.A Force More Powerful: A Century of Non-violent Conflict, by Peter Ackerman and Jack DuVall, St. Martin's Press, 2015, pages 256-263A Force More Powerful: A Century of Non-violent Conflict, by Peter Ackerman and Jack DuVall, St. Martin's Press, 2015, pages 256-263 After Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez's resignation, Andr\u00e9s Ignacio Men\u00e9ndez became Provisional President of El Salvador. On October 21, 1944, Aguirre y Salinas and other military officers who previously supported Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez overthrew Andr\u00e9s Ignacio Men\u00e9ndez's government and established himself as Provisional President of El Salvador. He cracked down on political opposition which lead to an armed uprising being launched by students in San Salvador on December 8, followed by an insurgent attack from Guatemala four days later where dictator Jorge Ubico had been overthrown in July. Both movements were crushed by the Aguirre y Salinas government, which thus consolidated its position in power. During his brief and short presidency, he issued a decree reforming the regulations of executive power on February 28, 1945, with the purpose of making a \"more rational distribution of the different branches of public administration\" and considering \"urgent the introduction of some reforms to the Regulation of the Executive Power, so that the incoming Government can organize said services on new bases.\" In January 1945, Aguirre y Salinas oversaw the presidential elections and ran in them to be elected to a second term. The election was boycotted by five candidates who withdrew after accusing Osm\u00edn Aguirre y Salinas of unfair election practices to ensure victory for his favored candidate.Parker, Franklin D (1981) The Central American republics Westport: Greenwood Press, p152 The election ended in a victory for Salvador Castaneda Castro of the Social Democratic Unification Party with 312,754 votes and a margin of 99.70%.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook Vol. 1 Oxford University Press, p287 Aguirre y Salinas himself only received 690 votes, a margin of 0.22%, in the heavily rigged election.
