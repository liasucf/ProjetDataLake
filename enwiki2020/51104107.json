The album was produced by James Skelly and Rich Turvey. It peaked to number 1 on the UK Albums Chart and number 12 on the Irish Albums Chart, reaching Silver certification in the UK in April 2017. Then in June 2017 their debut album went Gold in the UK after surpassing 100,000 sales. ==Singles== \"Blow\" was released as the lead single from the album on 26 August 2014. \"Cut Me and I'll Bleed\" was released as the second single from the album on 19 January 2015. \"Blown Rose\" was released as the third single from the album on 22 July 2015. \"Charlemagne\" was released as the fourth single from the album on 5 October 2015.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 71, based on 10 reviews. Reviewing for AllMusic, Neil Z. Yeung comments, \"Blossoms' self- titled first effort sounds less like a debut and more like a greatest-hits album from a veteran group. Years in the making, Blossoms is indeed a compilation of sorts, culling eight of twelve songs from the Stockport band's multiple EPs, which were released as early as 2013. Overall, Blossoms is a strong debut that distills the best of the quintet's diverse influences into a catchy amalgam that opts to shoot for the mainstream rather than stick to the same old sound.\" Reviewing for The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick comments, \"Of course, a little nonsense never bothered Blossoms\u2019 Manchester idols Stone Roses or Oasis, but they carried the spirit of the times into their anthemic singalongs. It is as if Blossoms are so intent on being heard in an environment hostile to guitars, they\u2019ve lost sight of the kind of deeper convictions that actually sets a great rock band apart from the pop hordes. There's plenty to applaud on a promising debut, but, as yet, not enough to believe in.\" Reviewing for The Independent, Andy Gill comments, \"Stockport\u2019s Blossoms have been acclaimed as saviours of indie-pop for so long now that this debut album is in effect a singles compilation: no fewer than eight of its dozen songs have been singles \u2013 though for all their iTunes presence, none has threatened the actual charts. Which is a problem, especially when they involve such sparkling melodies and seemingly blue-chip hooks as the lovely \u201cCharlemagne\u201d and \u201cAt Most A Kiss\u201d, the former's nimbly scuttling guitar effortlessly balanced by the latter's lollopy, rolling boogie. Wreathed in mellotron, vibrato guitar and ghostly backing vocals, several songs evoke the windswept psych-pop of The Coral, whose singer James Skelly co-produces Blossoms. But whether the group can straddle the divide between indie cred and chart success remains to be seen.\" Reviewing for NME, Mark Beaumont comments, \"Enter Stockport five-piece Blossoms \u2013 this year\u2019s biggest guitar-pop shooting stars, named after a pub and looking like snake-hipped garage rockers from the wrong side of Scarysex Central \u2013 occasionally sounding like Ellie Goulding. Tipped for greatness by the BBC Sound of 2016 poll, they\u2019re cunningly making a stealth assault on chart territory. Ultimately, Blossoms leap from their chart-bound Trojan horse as modernist rock heroes.\" ===Accolades=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- ! Publication ! Accolade ! Year !

Viva Stockport!\". The album also reached number one on the Scottish Albums Chart. The following week, the album sold fewer than 8,000 copies, the lowest weekly sale for a UK number one album in modern times. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Albums (OCC) | 92 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
