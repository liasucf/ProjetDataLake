The convention complements the previously established provisions of UNESCO including the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity of 2001. \"The Convention recognises the rights of Parties to take measures to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions, and impose obligations at both domestic and international levels on Parties.\"United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office The Convention is available in six authoritative texts: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions 2005 As of January 2020, the Convention has 149 parties: 148 states and the European Union. ==Background== The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is a precursor for seven UNESCO conventions which deal with the four core areas of creative diversity; cultural and natural heritage, movable cultural property, intangible cultural heritage and contemporary creativity.Ten Keys to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions These seven UNESCO conventions include the Universal Copyright Convention (1952, followed by a revision in 1971), the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (1954/1999), the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (1970), the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972), the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage (2001), the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003), and the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005). The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions deals with specific articles in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, Articles 8 through 11. These articles clarify three issues. First, the relationship that identity has with cultural goods and services, which values and meaning should not be treated as economic goods. Second, the States have the responsibility for the protection and promotion for the \"diversity of cultural expressions and ensuring the free flow of ideas and works\". Third, there needs to be international co-operation. The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is a legally binding international agreement that ensures artists, cultural professionals, practitioners and citizens worldwide can create, produce, disseminate and enjoy a broad range of cultural goods, services and activities, including their own.UNESCO 2005 Convention Cultural expressions are conveyed by activities, goods and services, which results in an economic and cultural nature. Due to this dual sided nature, cultural expressions cannot be seen purely as objects of trade. The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions main objective is to strengthen creation, production, distribution/dissemination, access and enjoyment of cultural expressions transmitted by cultural activities, goods and services, with a strong focus on developing countries. The promotion of dialogue and creativity of cultural diversity is an necessary element in the goal to achieve peace and sustainable development. The Convention was adopted in response to \"growing pressure exerted on countries to waive their right to enforce cultural policies and to put all aspects of the cultural sector on the table when negotiating international trade agreements.\" \"The international community signalled the urgency to implement an international law that would recognize the distinctive nature of cultural goods, services and activities as vehicles of identity, values and meaning and that while cultural goods, services and activities have important economic value, they are not mere commodities or consumer goods that can only be regarded as objects of trade.\" The Convention's main objective is to provide a legally binding international agreement that reaffirms the sovereign right of States to adopt cultural policies that support their cultural industries. The Convention does not want to control and restrict cultural expressions, but to promote and protect them. Recognizing that the diversity of cultural expressions is a \"rich asset for individuals and societies, the protection, promotion and maintenance of cultural diversity are an essential requirement for sustainable development for the benefit of present and future generations.\".UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, Article 2 Paragraph 6 The Convention also defines on cultural industry and interculturalityUNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, Article 4 Paragraph 8 ==History== Since the late 1980s, a growing number of countries were showing concern that \"the proliferation of trade agreements promoting absolute market liberalization dramatically increased the threat to cultural industries. Countries wishing to retain their right to enforce cultural policies risked being marginalized and unable to maintain their position.\" Civil society played an important role in the elaboration and adoption of the 2005 Convention. The Coalition for Cultural Diversity (CDC) was one of the most active civil society organizations in the debates and later in the ratification process of the Convention. The CDC also worked closely with the governments of Quebec and Canada to prepare for the implementation of the Convention. ===Steps=== *In 2001, the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity was adoptedUNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity and 21 May was declared the World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development The preliminary draft was drawn up over a series of two years, 2003\u20132005.
