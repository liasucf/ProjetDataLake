He was often known as \"Dublin Bay Loftus\". He was a member of Dublin City Council for 25 years, an alderman for much of that time, and a member of the Council's Planning and Development Committee. He was a member and honorary legal advisor of the Dublin Bay Preservation Association (later Dublin Bay Watch). ==Background== Born Se\u00e1n D. Loftus in Dublin in 1927, he was the eldest of seven siblings. He attended Col\u00e1iste Mhuire primary school on Parnell Square and received his secondary education at Catholic University School. His father was a doctor and Loftus attended medical school at University College Dublin but did not enjoy it, leaving before graduating. He moved to England in the late 1940s, where he worked as a builder. After six years, he returned to Ireland to attend King's Inns, qualifying as a barrister. He returned to England for several years before moving to the United States, where he worked and lectured. He moved back to Ireland in 1961. Loftus specialised in town planning law, lecturing in law at Bolton Street College of Technology (later the Dublin Institute of Technology). A resident of Clontarf, he campaigned for the sustainable development of Dublin Bay. Loftus was a devout Catholic. While he lived in the United States, he was an active member of the Montclair, New Jersey branch of an Irish-American Catholic fraternal organisation, the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH). He was guest of honor at the 1960 AOH National Convention by invitation of the National President, Jeremiah J. O\u2019Callaghan. Loftus moved back to Ireland in 1961. ==Political career== In 1961, Loftus founded the Christian Democrat Movement of Ireland and stood for election to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann at the 1961 general election in the Dublin North-East constituency, the first of sixteen attempts. In 1972 the Dublin Port and Docks Board proposed the building of an oil refinery in Dublin Bay. The plan was vigorously opposed by environmentalists, including Loftus, on the grounds that it posed a serious risk of pollution. At the 1973 general election, Loftus stood for election to the D\u00e1il in the Dublin North-Central constituency as a Christian Democrat on the issue of Dublin Bay. Because the party was too small to be registered under the 1963 Electoral Act, meaning Loftus would be listed as 'Independent', he changed his name by deed poll to Se\u00e1n D. Christian Democrat Dublin Bay Loftus in order that his political affiliation and campaign issue would appear on the ballot paper. Although not elected, he succeeded in highlighting the issue and the proposal was eventually turned down by the Minister for Local Government, James Tully. He was elected to Dublin Corporation in 1974. In the following years Loftus changed his name by deed poll several times more, to \"Se\u00e1n Dublin Bay Loftus\", \"Se\u00e1n Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus\" (as part of a campaign to press the Irish Government to make a territorial claim to the Rockall islet off the coast of County Donegal) and \"Se\u00e1n Alderman Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus\",Nealon's Guide to the 22nd D\u00e1il and Seanad, Ted Nealon and S\u00e9amus Brennan, 1981. among others. It was under this last name that he was finally elected to the 22nd D\u00e1il for the Dublin North-East constituency at the 1981 general election. This D\u00e1il was short-lived, however, and he himself contributed to the end of his D\u00e1il career when he voted against John Bruton's 1982 budget. At the February 1982 general election he stood in two constituencies, Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central, but failed to win a seat in either. He continued to contest D\u00e1il and European Parliament elections until 1997. He remained on Dublin City Council, and served as Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1995 to 1996. Loftus remained active as a member and honorary legal advisor of Dublin Bay Watch, and led opposition to the 2002 application by the Dublin Port Company to fill in of Dublin Bay. The application was rejected in June 2010 by the planning board, An Bord Plean\u00e1la, while Loftus was in hospital, having undergone brain surgery. Local councillor Gerry Breen said its rejection was a \"fitting tribute\" to Loftus. ==Personal life== In 1962, Loftus married \u00dana U\u00ed Lachtn\u00e1in, a home economics teacher from Cootehill, County Cavan. They had 3 children. A committed Gaeilgeoir, she became heavily involved in Oireachtas na Gaeilge, and was elected President of Oireachtas na Gaeilge in 2011. U\u00ed Lachtn\u00e1in also served several years as Chairperson of the Dublin City Community Forum and was a founding member of the Bull Island Action Group. ==Death== Loftus died on 10 July 2010 at the Mater Private Hospital. His funeral mass took place at St. Gabriel's Roman Catholic Church in Dollymount and he was interred at St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton on 12 July 2010. He was survived by his wife, \u00dana, who died on 1 April 2014. ==References== ==External links== *Se\u00e1n D. Christian Democrat Dublin Bay Loftus, RT\u00c9 Archives, 23 February 1973.
