According to John Setzer, it is \"packed with information on the City of Splendors, from the finest inn to the most dangerous alley\". ==Publication history== Volo's Guide to Waterdeep was written by Ed Greenwood and published by TSR. ==Reception== John Setzer reviewed the module in a 1993 issue of White Wolf Magazine. He advised that \"DMs who use Waterdeep in their Campaigns will really benefit from this product\", noting \"the potential to add so much [Forgotten] Realms flavor to a campaign that it could well be a campaign-saver for stagnant games\". Overall, he rated the product a 4 out of a possible 5. ==References== Category:1993 books Category:Forgotten Realms sourcebooks ",
