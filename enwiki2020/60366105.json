    "text": "Tom Meyer (born May 9, 1976), The Bible Memory Man, is an American speaker, college professor, Bible memorization expert, and author. He is best known as The Bible Memory Man because of his unique ability to quote over 20 complete books of the Bible dramatically from memory, although he is often mischaracterized as having the entire Bible memorized. His book The Memorization Study Bible (2018) is published by Master Books and is the only Study Bible which specifically facilitates the memorization of the Bible, a popular spiritual exercise for many Evangelical Christians. ==Family and education== Meyer was born in Elmhurst, IL on Mother's Day, May 9, 1976 to Tom and Deborah (Whitehead) Meyer. He is the oldest of four children. From a young age, Meyer attended Grace Baptist Church of Lombard, IL. He became a Christian at that time. At the age of 26, Meyer decided to pursue higher education. He attended Shasta Bible College and Graduate School in Redding, CA to earn his B.A. in Bible and Theology (2002\u20132006). At this point, Meyer determined to pursue his Biblical Studies abroad. He moved to Jerusalem, Israel for four years (2006\u20132010), during which he became the only person in the Institute's history to earn two master's degrees (Geography & Archaeology of Israel and Middle Eastern Culture & Religion) from Jerusalem University College in Jerusalem, Israel. During his 1,000 day stay in the Holy Land and neighboring countries, Meyer had such adventures as speaking the Bible from memory to Prime Minister Shimon Peres, sailing the Nile River, climbing Mount Sinai and the Great Pyramid, sifting the ruins of the Temple Mount and meeting his future wife, not to mention seeing for himself the many locations made famous by the events of the Bible. On Christmas Eve 2009, Meyer was engaged to Sarah Oakes in Bethlehem and on the Day of Pentecost in 2011, he married Oakes at Christ Church in the Old City of Jerusalem. They have 4 children and live in Redding, CA. ==Career and ministry== After graduating from Willowbrook High School in 1994, Meyer worked for his family's business, Meyer Paving in Maple Park, IL. At age 26, Meyer left IL for college in CA, and shortly thereafter began to memorize and perform portions of the Bible as a one-man, Shakespearean routine to present the most famous book in the world in a whole new way. Circa 2003, he met Jason Nightingale, the now deceased founder of Wordsower Ministries International. Intrigued by the two-fold work of stateside dramatic Bible recitations as sermons and overseas mercy ministry to orphans and widows, Meyer joined Nightingale's company and began quoting the entire book of Revelation from memory. Meyer, called a throwback because he recites the Bible from heart like ancient Israelites did thousands of years ago, has since recited the Bible from memory in over 30 states, in front of actor and now friend Chuck Norris and the President of Israel. Meyer expanded to full-time public speaking in 2010, at which point he also began to teach at his alma mater, Shasta Bible College. Meyer has appeared in numerous American TV, newspaper, and radio interviews such as Fox News, Moody Radio, CBN, and The Christian Post, as well as being featured in International newspapers and radio shows in Uganda, London, the Netherlands, Belgium, South Korea, Vietnam, Portugal, Germany, and Spain. He is an annual guest speaker at the Answers in Genesis Creation Museum and tours the USA each summer with his family to give his powerful presentations from coast to coast and inspire Christians to memorize Scripture. Most recently Meyer has gained distinction for speaking out against attempts to link Biblical prophecy to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, in 2020 Meyer began a series of exclusive interviews with the Daily Express of London. Meyer was interviewed on archaeological subjects like the possible location of the Ark of the Covenant, the Merenptah Stele, the Copper Scroll the crossing of the Red Sea and a possible correlation between the early chapters of Genesis and archaeology, although his position on the latter was criticized by the Daily Beast. Meyer was also interviewed by the Daily Express on eschatological subjects like the timing of the Rapture, a chronology of Biblical end times, the location of Armageddon, and the identity of the AntiChrist. ==References== ==External links== Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American male writers Category:21st-century Protestants Category:American evangelicals Category:American evangelists Category:Christians from California ",
