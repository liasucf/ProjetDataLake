    "text": "Babak Rafati (, born 28 May 1970) is a former Iranian-German football referee. As of February 2010, he has officiated more than 150 matches in the Bundesliga and the 2. Bundesliga. As of November 2011, he has officiated 84 top-flight German league games. ==Suicide attempt== Rafati was scheduled to referee a Bundesliga match on 19 November 2011 between 1. FC K\u00f6ln and 1. FSV Mainz 05, but never arrived, leading to the match's abandonment after a replacement could not be found. He was later found in his hotel room, having attempted suicide, and was rushed into intensive care. He confirmed that he was suffering from depression, and that would like to return to refereeing after he finished undergoing therapy. Incidentally, his debut officiating a Bundesliga game was a match between K\u00f6ln and Mainz 05 on 6 August 2005. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:German people of Iranian descent Category:German football referees Category:Iranian football referees Category:UEFA Europa League referees ",
