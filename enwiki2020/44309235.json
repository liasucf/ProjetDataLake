    "text": "Ming Li is a Canadian computer scientist, known for his fundamental contributions to Kolmogorov complexity, bioinformatics, machine learning theory, and analysis of algorithms.M. Li and P. Vitanyi, Inductive reasoning and Kolmogorov complexity. Journal of Computer and System Sciences, (special issue for Structure\u201989) 44:2(1992), 343-384. Li is currently a professor of Computer Science at the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. He holds a Tier I Canada Research Chair in Bioinformatics. In addition to academic achievements, his research has led to the founding of two independent companies. ==Education== Li received a Master of Science degree (Computer Science) from Wayne State University in 1980 and earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree (Computer Science) under the supervision of Juris Hartmanis, from Cornell University in 1985. His post-doctoral research was conducted at Harvard University under the supervision of Leslie Valiant. ==Career== Paul Vitanyi and Li, pioneered Kolmogorov complexity theory,M. Li, P. M. B. Vit\u00e1nyi, \"Applications of Algorithmic Information Theory\", Scholarpedia, 2(5):2658; 2007 applications and co-authoring the textbook An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications,.M. Li and P. M. B.Vit\u00e1nyi, An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and its Applications, Springer, New York, 1993 (1st Ed.), 1997 (2nd ed.), 2008 (3rd ed.) In 2000, Li founded Bioinformatics Solutions Inc, a biomedical software company, primarily providing solutions for tandem mass spectrometry protein characterization. Originally developed to identify novel peptides through de novo peptide sequencing, the technology has been adapted to address antibody characterization. Other products have included protein structure prediction, general purpose homology searching, next generation sequencing glyco-peptide research. In 2013, Li co-founded RSVP Technologies Inc, an artificial intelligence company. Utilizing statistical machine learning, deep neural network and natural language processing, the company develops a unique language-understanding platform for knowledge mining, sentence parsing, practical question-answering, and human-computer chatting. The software has been applied on voice-control navigation systems, personal tour guide applications, robotics and other intelligent electronics. ==Awards & Honours== * 1996 - E.W.R.
