    "text": "\"What Is Truth\" is a song written and recorded by American country music artist Johnny Cash released in February 1970. Generally viewed as a protest song, a rarity in country music at the time, the criticism of the Vietnam War, and war in general, made the song a major crossover hit. The song peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles. It also became Cash's 12th Top 40 single on the Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 19, and his 2nd Top 10 single on the Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at Number 4. It also reached number 1 on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada, and number 21 on the UK Singles Chart. ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1970) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |- |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Easy Listening |align=\"center\"|4 |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Country Tracks |align=\"center\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Top Singles |align=\"center\"|9 |- |align=\"left\"|U.K. Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|21 |} ==References== Category:1970 singles Category:Johnny Cash songs Category:RPM Country Tracks number-one singles Category:Songs written by Johnny Cash Category:Columbia Records singles Category:1970 songs Category:Protest songs ",
