    "text": "WBOK (1230 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a variety of formats, including Gospel and various local talk programs brokered by their hosts. Licensed to New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, the station serves the New Orleans area. The station is owned by Bakewell Media of Louisiana, LLC. Its current slogan is \"Real Talk for Real Times\". The station was purchased by Danny Bakewell on behalf of The Bakewell Family in April 2007. ==History== AM 1230 was originally WJBW with a Top 40 format in the late 1950s, but by the end of the decade it switched call letters to WSHO and became a Broadway music formatted outlet. In 1962 WBOK swapped signals with WSHO and moved its R&B; format to the 1230 signal. The R&B; format would last until the late 1970s when it evolved to its current format after it was sold to Bishop Levi Willis. The failure of levees immediately following the landfall of Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005 resulted in flooding of WBOK's studio and offices. The station's transmitter site also received flood damage and the broadcast tower was severely damaged. Gentilly section of New Orleans, 2008. WBOK has returned to the air as of 11/3/2007 with an urban music and talk format, the station would work as an outlet for black political leaders to voice their opinion on matters because they felt as thought he other outlets were supporting whites only. WBOK is owned by the Bakewell Media Company. Its principals, Danny Bakewell Sr. and Danny Bakewell Jr. are native New Orleanians who reside and operate a number of businesses in Los Angeles, CA, including being owners of the Los Angeles Sentinel. \u201cThe new broadcast outlet offers a window into the rapidly changing African American political consciousness in post-Katrina New Orleans. The new format, \u201cTalk Back: Talk Black\u201d marks a significant development in African American political life post-Katrina. Bakewell's comments on today's broadcast made it clear that his goal is to make WBOK a voice for African Americans in New Orleans and the Diaspora. \u201cWBOK listeners will hear elements of a political discourse that is emerging in the post-Katrina black community\u2014marked by trenchant critique of racism in the recovery, a relentless attack on the current governing black political class, and a forthright discussion of destructive behaviors that are undermining black community regeneration. With virtually all the New Orleans electronic media controlled by white elites, one can expect WBOK to become an important forum for a black dialogue and alternative perspectives on race, class, and the recovery. Whether or not the \u201cTalk Back Talk Black\u201d radio format can find advertisers to ensure economic viability remains to be seen, especially given the decimation of the New Orleans black middle class and black businesses. But Bakewell seems to be guided by more a sense of justice than a desire for profit,\u201d writes Lance Hill.
