    "text": "Amityville Death House is a 2015 direct-to-video horror film. The film is based on the 1977 novel The Amityville Horror. The film follows the trend of films based on The Amityville Horror having little to nothing to do with the events in the book and only using the location, the DeFeo murders and the 112 Ocean Avenue house as a plot point. The film was directed by Mark Polonia, one of the Polonia brothers. The film uses a relatively unknown cast with the exception of Eric Roberts as \"The Dark Lord\". ==Cast== *Eric Roberts as \"The Dark Lord\" (credited as \"The Warlock\") *Kyrsten St. Pierre as Tiffany *Michael Merchant *Cassandra Hayes *Houston Baker *Ken Van Sant *Danielle Donahue *Steve Diasparra *Kathryn Sue Young *Jeff Kirkendall *Yolie Canales *Austin Dragovich *Todd Carpenter ==References== ==External links== * Category:Amityville Horror films Category:American films Category:2015 films Category:2015 horror films Category:Direct-to-video horror films Category:American horror films ",
