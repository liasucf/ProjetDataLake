    "text": "Lincoln University (LU) is a state-related, historically black university near Oxford, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded as the private Ashmun Institute in 1854, it has been a public institution since 1972 and was the United States' first degree-granting HBCU. Its main campus is located on 422 acres near the town of Oxford in southern Chester County, Pennsylvania. The university has a second location in University City, Philadelphia. Lincoln University provides undergraduate and graduate coursework to approximately 2,000 students. It is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. While a majority of its students are African Americans, the university has a long history of accepting students of other races and nationalities. Women have received degrees since 1953, and made up 66% of undergraduate enrollment in 2019. ==History== In 1854 Rev. John Miller Dickey, a Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Sarah Emlen Cresson, a Quaker, founded Ashmun Institute, later named Lincoln University, in Hinsonville. They named it after Jehudi Ashmun, a religious leader and social reformer. They founded the school for the education of African Americans, who had few opportunities for higher education. {| class=\"infobox\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" style=\"font- size: 90%;\" align=\"right\" |+ style=\"font-size: 1.25em;\" |Presidents |- |John Miller Dickey |1854\u20131856 |- |John Pym Carter |1856\u20131861 |- |John Wynne Martin |1861\u20131865 |- |Isaac Norton Rendall |1865\u20131906 |- |John Ballard Rendall |1906\u20131924 |- |Walter Livingston Wright* |1924\u20131926 |- |William Hallock Johnson |1926\u20131936 |- |Walter Livingston Wright |1936\u20131945 |- |Horace Mann Bond |1945\u20131957 |- |Armstead Otey Grubb* |1957\u20131960 |- |Donald Charles Yelton* |1960\u20131961 |- |Marvin Wachman |1961\u20131969 |- |Bernard Warren Harleston* |1970-1970 |- |Herman Russell Branson |1970\u20131985 |- |Donald Leopold Mullett* |1985\u20131987 |- |Niara Sudarkasa |1987\u20131998 |- |James Donaldson* |1998\u20131999 |- |Ivory V.

He encouraged some of his first students: James Ralston Amos (1826\u20131864), his brother Thomas Henry Amos (1825\u20131869), and Armistead Hutchinson Miller (1829/30-1865), to support the establishment of Liberia as a colony for African Americans. (This was a project of the American Colonization Society). Each of the men became ordained ministers. In 1866, a year after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, Ashmun Institute was renamed Lincoln University. The college attracted highly talented students from numerous states, especially during the long decades of legal segregation in the South. As may be seen on the list of notable alumni (link below), many furthered their in careers in fields including academia, public service, and the arts. In June 1921, days after the Tulsa race massacre, President Warren Harding visited Lincoln to deliver the commencement address. He spoke about the need to seek healing and harmony in that incident's aftermath, as well as to honor Lincoln alumni who were part of the 367,000 African American servicemen to fight in World War I. The school newspaper noted Harding's visit as \"the high water mark in the history of the institution.\"President Harding called for racial justice in America after Tulsa massacre Retrieved June 27, 2020 In 1945 Dr. Horace Mann Bond, an alumnus of Lincoln, was selected as the first African-American president of the university. During his 12-year tenure, he continued to do social science research, and helped support the important civil rights case of Brown v. Board of Education, decided in 1954 by the US Supreme Court. His relationship with the collector Albert C. Barnes was essential in ensuring the university's role in the management of his art collection. From 1854 to 1954, Lincoln University graduates accounted for 20% of African American physicians and over 10% of African American lawyers in the United States. The university celebrated its 100th anniversary by amending its charter in 1953 to permit the granting of degrees to women.The university celebrated its 100th anniversary by amending its charter in 1953 to permit the granting of degrees to women. In 1972 Lincoln University formally associated with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a state-related institution. In November 2014, University president Robert R. Jennings resigned under pressure from faculty, students and alumni after comments relating to issues of sexual assault.

On May 11, 2017, the Lincoln University board of trustees announced the appointment of Dr. Brenda A.

Barnes, philanthropist and art collector who established the Barnes Foundation. Barnes took a special interest in the institution and built a relationship with its students. Barnes gave Lincoln University the privilege of naming four of the five directors originally set as the number for the governing board of the Barnes Foundation. Barnes had an interest in helping under-served youth and populations. Barnes intended his $25 billion art collection to be used primarily as a teaching resource. He limited the number of people who could view it, and for years even the kinds of people, with a preference for students and working class. Visitors still must make appointments in advance to see the collection, and only a limited number are allowed in the galleries at one time. In the mid-20th century, local government restricted traffic to the current campus, located in a residential neighborhood located at 300 North Latch's Lane, Merion, Pennsylvania. Barnes' constraints, local factors, and management issues pushed the Foundation near bankruptcy by the 1990s. Supporters began to explore plans to move the collection to a more public location and maintain it to museum standards. To raise money for needed renovations to the main building to protect the collection, the Foundation sent some of the most famous Impressionist and Modern paintings on tour. In 2002, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania D. Michael Fisher contested Albert C. Barnes' will, arguing that the Merion location of the collection and small number of Board members limited the Foundation's ability to sustain itself financially. Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell brokered a settlement in 2005 between the Barnes Foundation and Lincoln University. This agreement resulted in the number of directors increasing. This has diluted Lincoln's influence over the collection, now valued at approximately twenty-five billion dollars. A documentary named The Art of the Steal depicts the events. ==Notable alumni== Lincoln University has numerous notable alumni, including US Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall; Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes; father of musical legend Cab Calloway; Medal of Honor recipient and pioneering African- American editor Christian Fleetwood; civil rights activist Frederick D.
