    "text": "Orazio Bruni (born c. 1630) was an Italian engraver of the Baroque period. He was born at Siena. He worked entirely with the graver, and appears to have imitated the style of Fran\u00e7ois de Poilly. He engraved plates from his own designs and others from Rutilio Manetti and others. Among his plates are The Prodigal Son, The Golden Age, A set of the Four Seasons, A set of various Animals, a Warrior, and a Female in a Triumphal Car, with Minerva presenting a Sceptre. ==References== * Category:Italian engravers Category:Italian Baroque painters Category:Baroque engravers Category:People from Siena Category:1630 births Category:Year of death unknown ",
