It was designed by the NSW Public Works Department and built by the department in 1900. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002. == History == The sewer vent and cottage were built in 1900. The Corunna Road site is one of only two sewer vents in New South Wales to feature accommodation facilities. The cottage was originally leased to Water Board employees responsible for the maintenance of the vent. The cottage was renovated by Sydney Water as part of the Heritage Assets Project, which saw the demolition of the dilapidated rear kitchen, and the installation of a new contemporary kitchen, hallway, dining room, laundry and bathroom. It also saw a new skillion roof installed at the rear of the cottage, new walls, floor and ceiling, French doors, services, and the restoration of the yard. The cottage was sold at auction by Sydney Water in 2017 for $1,405,000. The adjacent sewer vent remains owned by Sydney Water following the cottage sale. == Description == The structure comprises a brick and terracotta detailed vent shaft with rendered base and cap some 15 metres in height. With the adjoining Queen Anne revival workers cottage, the vent is integral to the design of the place as it forms part of the front fence in brick and stone detailing with wrought iron gates and fence pickets. Construction details are substantially intact. The cottage comprises a single storey detached dwelling with all original details in generally including turned timber verandah posts and verandah detail; Timber joinery; and Marseilles pattern terracotta tiles, all of which appears to be substantially intact. Further original details of the cottage include a rendered and lined ashlar wall to the side lane and rendered label moulds above the window heads. Evidence of shutters via shutter flaps remain but shutters have been removed. The cottage backs on to a rear lane which is fenced by a timber paling fence in fair to poor condition. Relatively new steel straps have been fitted to the shaft for stability which has some impact on the visual aesthetics of the shaft, however the quality and detailing of the shaft remains as an excellent example of the brick masons craft complete with entasis. What sets this shaft apart from others is the neo-classical terracotta console brackets at the capital of the shaft which is an excellent detail and example of its type. The stone detail on the shaft is inscribed \"Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage 1900\" and is in itself in poor condition continuing to exfoliate. The vent and cottage are located on the corner of a lane, and the vent is a prominent landmark within the local vicinity, particularly to the east along Corunna Road. == Heritage listing == The vent and cottage are an increasingly rare survivor of an excellent example of the brick and stonemasons craft associated with Sydney Water in the early part of the 20th century.
