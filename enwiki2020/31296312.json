Furthermore, I invite you with the > invitation of peace. If you submit then you will find safety and God will > double your reward. If you turn away, you will bear the Arians\u2019 sins. \"O > People of the Scripture! Come to a common word between us and you: that we > shall worship none but God, and that we shall ascribe no partner unto Him, > and that none of us shall take others for lords beside God. And if they turn > away, then say: Bear witness that we are they who have surrendered (unto > Him). \u2014 Quran, Chapter: Aal Imran \u201cThe House of Joachim\u201d 3:64\u201d When, after finishing his trip, Dhiyah was returning to Medina ; a group of bandit belonging to Banu Judham looted him of everything he had, when he reached Hisma, a place on the way to Syria and west of Tabuk.

When the news reached Muhammad, he immediately dispatched Zayd ibn Haritha with 500 men to punish them. The Muslim army fought with Banu Judham, killed several of them (inflicting heavy casualties), including their chief, Al-Hunayd ibn Arid and his son, and captured 1000 camels, 5000 of their cattle and a 100 women and boys. The new chief of the Banu Judham who had embraced Islam appealed to Muhammad to release his fellow tribesmen, and Muhammad released them. ==See also== *Military career of Muhammad *List of expeditions of Muhammad ==Notes== Category:628 Category:Campaigns ordered by Muhammad ",
