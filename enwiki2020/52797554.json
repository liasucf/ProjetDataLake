She struggles to make friends and soon after moving to Oslo to attend university begins to experience unexplained epileptic seizures. When she meets another student, Anja, she discovers that her feelings for Anja trigger uncontrollable psychokinetic powers. While undergoing a brain tomography test to find the cause of her seizures, she begins to think about Anja and as she focuses on her, Thelma's power is set in motion and she unconsciously and unwittingly makes Anja vanish into empty space. Distraught and confused by Anja's sudden disappearance, Thelma returns home and soon remembers that when she was a little girl she had a baby brother. Once, when feeling neglected and jealous of the attention given to her younger sibling, and wishing him to be quiet and gone, she involuntarily caused him to teleport from his crib and reappear underneath the sofa. In a final tragic incident, she caused him to disappear from his bath, and he was found trapped below the ice of a frozen lake by her father. Traumatized, Thelma's mother tried to take her own life by jumping off a bridge, but instead the failed attempt left her disabled. Thelma had forgotten these events. Realising her utter distress, her parents tell her the truth, which is that she is somehow able to manifest whatever she deeply wants and that she inherited the same inexplicable ability from her grandmother, who blamed herself for the disappearance of Thelma's grandfather and was kept sedated in a psychiatric nursing home by Trond. Thelma perceives that her parents had a similar fate in mind for her. Earlier, while visiting Anja, Thelma recalled how her father once held her hand over a lit candle until it almost burned so that she could feel what Hell's eternal fire was like. She causes the death of her father by telekinetically making him self-combust whilst out boating on the unfrozen lake. Thelma realizes that her power can also restore life when she revives a small dead bird. She begins to understand that her supernatural ability is also a gift and uses it to heal her mother, making her able to walk again. Along with the realization that she can summon her power, Thelma is able to finally control it, and brings Anja back to existence. She returns to college, now with Anja as her girlfriend in a guilt-free relationship. ==Cast== * Eili Harboe as Thelma **Grethe Elterv\u00e5g as young Thelma * Kaya Wilkins as Anja * Henrik Rafaelsen as Trond * Ellen Dorrit Petersen as Unni ==Production== Thelma was produced by Thomas Robsahm of Norwegian production company Motlys, and co-produced by Film V\u00e4st, Filmpool Nord and B-Reel (Sweden), Snowglobe Film (Denmark), and Le Pacte (France); with financial support provided by the Norwegian Film Institute, Swedish Film Institute, Danish Film Institute, Copenhagen Film Fund, Nordic Film & TV Fund, Eurimages, and MEDIA Programme.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Thelma plays with genre tropes in unexpected ways, delivering a thoughtfully twisty supernatural thriller with a lingering impact.\" On Metacritic, the film received a score of 74 out of 100, based on 31 leading critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". In IndieWire's annual critics poll of best films and performances, Thelma was selected a \"Critics Pick\" for Best Foreign Language Film. Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times that Thelma is \"a romance, a psychological thriller, a liberation story and a whodunit (and why) ... and most satisfyingly, it plays with the female Gothic ... in which women are at once the victims and agents of change\", praising Joachim Trier with having \"a great talent for making loneliness visceral and visible, for showing how pain can make the world disappear.\" In the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang said the film was a \"muted and moody supernatural chiller\" that is \"thoughtful and beautifully composed\" with sequences \"that tap into a vividly primal sense of terror.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described Thelma as \"an uncanny accumulation of mood, an ecstasy of disquiet\" and the performance by Eili Harboe as \"outstandingly good\". AfterEllen praised the performance by Harboe as \"exhilarating, and incredibly moving\", and said that \"In a sea of lesbian films that are often repetitive, Thelma explores analytical territory that none other has before.\" David Friend of The Canadian Press said the film carries \"an ominous and sinister tone that evokes the best traits of classics like 'Carrie' and 'Let the Right One In.'\" Bilge Ebiri of The Village Voice described the film's story as moving \"away from the monstrous, toward compassion and understanding ... prob[ing] the profound underlying sadness beneath tales of possession\" and \"makes vivid the protagonist\u2019s loneliness and despair.\" David Ehrlich wrote in IndieWire that Thelma was a \"an ominous, unnerving, and strangely powerful thriller about the most devious of human desires\" and \"consistently keyed in to the persuasive power of the female body.\" The Verge said Thelma was a \"quietly beautiful film\" and \"a thriller that\u2019s scary, sad, and ultimately triumphant\", with cinematography that is \"visually ... striking throughout\". The Hollywood Reporter said it contained \"intelligent, measured tone and elegant visual style\" and \"while the more enigmatic supernatural elements at times veer close to formulaic Hollywood horror tropes, the movie maintains a compelling seriousness, particularly in its consideration of the conflict between sexuality and repression.\" THR also selected Thelma as one of the best LGBT films of 2017. Variety described the film as \"an unnervingly effective slow-burn, and those with the patience for Trier\u2019s patient accumulation of detail will find it pays off in unexpected ways.\" Margaret Barton-Fumo from Film Comment summarized Thelma as \"a romantic film that pays close attention to physical detail\", and \"Surprisingly tender, [it] proves itself a modern take on the supernatural film.\" ==Box office== ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- style=\"text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"| Award ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"| Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"| Category ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"| Recipient and nominee ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"| Ref |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=1| Norwegian International Film Festival | rowspan=1| 24 August 2017 | Norwegian Critics Prize | Thelma | | rowspan=1 style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=1| L\u00fcbeck Nordic Film Days | rowspan=1| 5 November 2017 | Baltic Jury Award | Thelma | | rowspan=1 style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=1| San Diego Film Critics Society | rowspan=1| 11 December 2017 | Best Foreign Language Film | Thelma | | rowspan=1 style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=1| Utah Film Critics Association | rowspan=1| 17 December 2017 | Non-English Language Film | Thelma | | rowspan=1 style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=1| Houston Film Critics Society | rowspan=1| 6 January 2018 | Best Foreign Language Film | Thelma | | rowspan=1 style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=1| Critics' Choice Movie Awards | rowspan=1| 11 January 2018 | Best Foreign Language Film | Thelma | | rowspan=1 style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=10| Kosmorama International Film Festival | rowspan=10| 8 March 2018 | Best Picture | Thelma | | rowspan=10 style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- | Best Producer | Thomas Robsahm | |- | Best Director | | |- | Best Actress | | |- | Best Actor | Henrik Rafaelsen | |- | Best Screenplay | , | |- | Best Production Design | Roger Rosenberg | |- | Best Film Music | Ola Fl\u00f8ttum | |- | Best Editing | Olivier Bugge Coutts | |- | Best Sound Design | Gisle Tveito | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=1| GLAAD Media Award | rowspan=1| 12 April 2018 | Outstanding Film \u2013 Limited Release | Thelma | | rowspan=1 style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=12| Amanda Award | rowspan=12| 18 August 2018 | Best Norwegian Movie | Thelma | | rowspan=12 style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- | Best Director | | |- | Best Actress | | |- | Best Actor | Henrik Rafaelsen | |- | Best Supporting Actress | Kaya Wilkins | |- | Best Screenplay | , | |- | Best Cinematography | Jakob Ihre | |- | Best Production Design/Scenography | Roger Rosenberg | |- | Best Visual Effects | Esben Syberg (Shortcut) | |- | Best Music | Ola Fl\u00f8ttum | |- | Best Editing | Olivier Bugge Coutts | |- | Best Sound Design | Gisle Tveito | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=1| Nordic Council Film Prize | rowspan=1| 30 October 2018 | Award | Thelma | | rowspan=1 style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- |} ==Home media== The DVD for Region 2 and Blu-ray for Region B was released by SF Studios in Scandinavia on 4 December 2017.
