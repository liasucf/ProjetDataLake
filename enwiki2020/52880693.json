For thallium it may be used in addition to gastric lavage, activated charcoal, forced diuresis, and hemodialysis. It is given by mouth or nasogastric tube. Prussian blue is also used in the urine to test for G6PD deficiency. Side effects may include constipation, low blood potassium, and stools that are dark. With long-term use, sweat may turn blue.
