    "text": "Dungeon Hill is a hill in the Dungeon Hills range in the Galloway Hills range, part of the Southern Uplands of Scotland. Although it is the lowest of the three main hills along the ridge, it lends its name to the range. Normally climbed as part of a round of the Dungeon Hills and, occasionally, the Range of the Awful Hand, some ascents also begin from the east at Backhill of Bush bothy over the Silver Flowe, however the terrain is extremely demanding from this direction. http://www.hill- bagging.co.uk/mountaindetails.php?qu=S&rf;=1712 ==References== Category:Donald mountains Category:Mountains and hills of the Southern Uplands Category:Mountains and hills of Dumfries and Galloway ",
