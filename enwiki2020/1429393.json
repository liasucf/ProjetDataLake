A. Shaw; and commissioned 12 January 1944, Lieutenant Commander R. C. Gloss, USNR, in command. == World War II service == Devastator \u2013 the first ship in the U.S. Navy to bear that name\u2014was an auxiliary ship of the United States Navy. She served as an escort vessel during the latter half of the Second World War, and later saw service in the Korean War. Devastator arrived at Pearl Harbor 30 March 1944 as escort for a convoy. The next day she began convoy escort duty in Majuro and Kwajalein, which continued until 30 July. During 3 to 17 August she swept off French Frigate Shoals, and after one voyage to Eniwetok from 4 to 25 September, served at Pearl Harbor on training duty for the remainder of the year. === Iwo Jima and Okinawa operations === Devastator sailed from Pearl Harbor 27 January 1945 as escort for transports bound for the Battle of Iwo Jima. She participated in preinvasion minesweeping for 3 days before the invasion landings of 19 February, then escorted damaged vessels to Saipan, returning to Iwo Jima 1 March to patrol off the island until 7 March. On 19 March 1945 Devastator got underway from Ulithi for preinvasion minesweeping at Okinawa. She patrolled during and after the invasion and in the heavy suicide attacks of 6 April downed a Japanese plane about off her port quarter. On 4 July she cleared Okinawa for minesweeping operations in conjunction with the U.S. 3rd Fleet raids on the Japanese mainland. She sailed from Okinawa 15 July for Seattle, Washington arriving 12 August for overhaul. Devastator remained on the U.S. West Coast for operations except for two extended periods at Pearl Harbor for experiments in hull design development. She was placed out of commission 30 January 1947. == Korean War-related service == Sasebo, Japan, 1952 Recommissioned 26 February 1952 Devastator served in the Far East from 8 July 1952 to 5 February 1953 and again from 5 October 1953 to 2 June 1954 carrying out dangerous sweeps in Korean waters. She then operated on the U.S. west coast until again placed out of commission in reserve 15 April 1955. She was reclassified MSF-318, 7 February 1955. == Decommissioning and disposal == Devastator was decommissioned 15 April 1955. She was sold to Mexico in 1973. ==Awards and honors== Devastator received three battle stars for World War II service and two battle stars for Korean War service. ==Mexican Navy service== The former Devastator was sold to the Mexican Navy in 1973 and renamed ARM Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada (C74).
