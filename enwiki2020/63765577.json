    "text": "Andrew Rambaut , is a British evolutionary biologist, and Professor of Molecular Evolution at the University of Edinburgh. Rambaut earned a BSc in Zoology from the University of Edinburgh and a DPhil in Zoology from the University of Oxford in 1997. Rambaut was based at the University of Oxford until 2006, when he took up a Royal Society university research fellowship position and became Chair of Molecular Evolution at the University of Edinburgh in 2010. Rambaut's research is primarily on the \"evolutionary and epidemiological study of viral pathogens of humans and animals\". In 2007, Rambaut published a paper with Alexei Drummond describing BEAST (Bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling trees), a software package for evolutionary analysis by molecular sequence variation, which uses Bayesian inference techniques.
