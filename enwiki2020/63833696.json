    "text": "Daratumumab/hyaluronidase, sold under the brand name Darzalex Faspro, is a combination drug for the treatment of adults with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. It is a combination of daratumumab and hyaluronidase. It is administered via subcutaneous injection. The most common adverse reaction using daratumumab/hyaluronidase as monotherapy is upper respiratory tracts infection. == Medical uses == Daratumumab/hyaluronidase is indicated for the treatment of adults with multiple myeloma: * in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (D-VMP) in newly diagnosed adults who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant * in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (D-Rd) in newly diagnosed adults who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant and in people with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy * in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (D-Vd) in adults who have received at least one prior therapy * as monotherapy, in adults who have received at least three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent or who are double-refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent. == History == It was approved for use in the United States in May 2020. Efficacy of daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihji (monotherapy) was evaluated in the COLUMBA trial (NCT03277105), an open-label non-inferiority trial randomizing 263 participants to daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj and 259 to intravenous daratumumab (daratumumab IV). The trial's co-primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) and pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoint of the maximum Ctrough on cycle 3, day 1 pre- dose. Daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj was non-inferior to daratumumab IV in evaluating these two endpoints. Efficacy of daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj in combination with VMP (D-VMP) was evaluated in a single-arm cohort of the PLEIADES trial (NCT03412565), a multi-cohort, open\u2011label trial. Eligible participants were required to have newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and were ineligible for transplant. Efficacy of daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj in combination with Rd (D-Rd) was evaluated in a single-arm cohort of this trial. Eligible participants had received at least one prior line of therapy. == References == ==External links== * * * * Category:Combination drugs Category:Antineoplastic and immunomodulating drugs ",
