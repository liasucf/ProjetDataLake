The wine produced here was classified as one of ten Quatri\u00e8mes Crus (Fourth Growths) in the historic Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. MacNeil, Karen (2001). The Wine Bible, Workman Publishing, p. 885, ==History== Ch\u00e2teau Marquis de Terme was once part of the vast Rauzan estate owned by Pierre de Mesures de Rauzan in the mid-17th century. Over time this estate was divided, and by the time of the 1855 Classification, had been separated into the estates of Ch\u00e2teau Rauzan-Gassies, Ch\u00e2teau Rauzan-S\u00e9gla, Ch\u00e2teau Desmirail, and Ch\u00e2teau Marquis de Terme. The ch\u00e2teau\u2019s history under the name Ch\u00e2teau Marquis de Terme officially began in 1762. It was created as a marriage dowry when Ledoulx d\u2019Emplet offered the ch\u00e2teau to Fran\u00e7ois de Peguilhan, Marquis de Terme who was marrying her daughter, Elizabeth de Ledoulx d\u2019Emplet. Though the ch\u00e2teau would be classified as a Fourth Growth in the M\u00e9doc Classification of 1855, the estate was already made famous in the 1700s. American President Thomas Jefferson, who was a wine connoisseur, visited Bordeaux in 1787. He declared Ch\u00e2teau Marquis de Terme as one of the 16 best Bordeaux wines he tasted. Today the ch\u00e2teau is still owned by the Seneclauze family, who purchased it in 1935. == References == ==External links== *Ch\u00e2teau Marquis de Terme official site Category:Bordeaux wine producers ",
