    "text": "Live at Chelmsford Top Security Prison is a live album by Sex Pistols, released in 1990. It was recorded on 17 September 1976 at the Chelmsford Prison, before Glen Matlock left the band. The recording featured many non-Sex Pistols overdubs and insertions arranged by the band's early soundman Dave Goodman. These included a canned audio track of a riot (complete with shouting, scuffles, breaking glass, etc.). As the liner notes on the CD say: > Their opening number was \"Anarchy\"... at the end of the number there was a > barrage of catcalls, boos and screaming. However, the same concert tracks were released (in original play order) on the Sex Pistols: Alive CD without overdubs, contrasting with the Goodman-produced Chelmsford CD. == Track listing == # Satellite # Submission # Liar # No Fun # Pretty Vacant # Problems # I Wanna Be Me # Seventeen # New York # No Lip # Stepping Stone # Substitute # Anarchy in the Prison # Did You No Wrong == External links == * Category:Sex Pistols live albums Category:1990 live albums ",
