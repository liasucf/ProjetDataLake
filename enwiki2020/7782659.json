    "text": "She-crab soup is a rich soup, similar to bisque, made of milk or heavy cream, crab or fish stock, Atlantic blue crab meat, and (traditionally) crab roe, and a small amount of dry sherry added as it is plated. It may be thickened either by heat reduction or with a pur\u00e9e of boiled rice; it may also include such seasonings as mace and shallots or onions. The soup is a regional specialty from Tidewater Virginia, the South Carolina Lowcountry and Georgia coast. It is commonly featured on the menus of many Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia restaurants.Levitas, Gloria (June 27, 1982). \"She-Crab Soup: Southern Tradition\", New York Times.

Retrieved November 1, 2015. The soup is named for the \"she-crab\", or female crab, originally a gravid (roe-carrying) crab, as the orange crab roe comprise a chief ingredient in traditional she-crab soup. As with turtle soup, other ingredients may be added to the soup or substituted for others, although crabmeat is found in all versions. ==See also== * Partan bree * List of cream soups * List of regional dishes of the United States * List of soups ==References== Category:Cream soups Category:Cuisine of the Southern United States Category:Crab dishes Category:Fish and seafood soups ",
