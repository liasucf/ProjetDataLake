    "text": "SINIX is a discontinued variant of the Unix operating system from Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme. SINIX supersedes SIRM OS and Pyramid Technology's DC/OSx. Following X/Open's acceptance that its requirements for the use of the UNIX trademark were met, version 5.44 and subsequent releases were published as Reliant UNIX by Fujitsu Siemens Computers. ==Features== In some versions of SINIX (5.2x) the user could emulate the behaviour of a number of different versions of Unix (known as universes). These included System V.3, System III or BSD. Each universe had its own command set, libraries and header files. ==Xenix-based SINIX== The original SINIX was a modified version of Xenix and ran on Intel 80186 processors. For some years Siemens used the NSC-32x32 (up to Sinix 5.2x) and Intel 80486 CPUs (Sinix 5.4x - non MIPS) in their MX- Series. ==System V-based SINIX== Later versions of SINIX based on System V were designed for the: * SNI RM-200, RM-300, RM-400 and RM-600 servers running on the MIPS processor (SINIX-N, SINIX-O, SINIX-P, SINIX-Y) * SNI PC-MX2, MX300-05/-10/-15/-30, Siemens MX500-75/-85 running NS320xx (SINIX-H) * PC-MXi, MX300-45 on the Intel X86 processor (SINIX-L) * SNI WX-200 and other IBM- compatible i386 PCs on the Intel 80386 and newer processors (SINIX-Z) The last release under the SINIX name was version 5.43 in 1995. ==Reliant UNIX== The last Reliant UNIX versions were registered as UNIX 95 compliant (XPG4 hard branding). The last release of Reliant UNIX was version 5.45. ==See also== * BS2000 * VM2000 ==External links== * Siemens Business Services - SINIX patches and support * The SINIX operating system * Sven Mascheck, SINIX V5.20 Universes Category:MIPS operating systems Category:UNIX System V ",
