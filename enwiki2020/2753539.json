    "text": "The Japanese language has two types of regular verbs that involve the stem, and can be referred to as Japanese consonant and vowel verbs. ==Verb groups== The two groups of verbs are: #consonant-stem, , Group I, or -u verbs; and #vowel-stem, , Group II, or -ru verbs. Most verbs are consonant-stem, but vowel-stem verbs are also common, hence the numbering \"Group I\" (consonant- stem, more common) and \"Group II\" (vowel-stem, less common). Sometimes categorization is expanded to include \"Group III\" (special cases) for the irregular verbs \u3059\u308b suru and \u6765\u308b kuru; note however that there are other Japanese irregular verbs, though they are generally only slightly irregular. Consonant-stem verbs end in -u (-au, -iu, -uu, -ou), -ku, -gu, -su, -tsu, -nu, -bu, -mu or -ru, but not -eu, -zu, -dzu, -fu, -pu, or the defective columns -yu or -wu. All vowel-stem verbs end in either -iru or -eru. However, not all verbs ending in -iru or -eru are vowel-stem verbs; for example, hashiru, \"run\", is a consonant-stem verb. Verbs ending in -aru, -uru and -oru also exist, and are all consonant-stem. The Japanese names (\"5-class\" and \"1-class\") are based on the number of vowel suffixes used to form verb roots for conjugations. Classical Japanese had more verb groups (such as 2-class and 4-class) which are archaic in Modern Japanese. ==Conjugation== Consonant-stem verbs conjugate differently from the vowel-stem verbs. Consonant-stem verbs conjugate after a consonant, and vowel-stem verbs conjugate after a vowel, as can be seen in the following examples: {| class=\"wikitable\" | |- ! ! colspan=2 | consonant-stem ! colspan=2 | vowel-stem |- ! Plain form | yom.u (\"read\") \u8aad\u3080 (godan, u-verb) | hashir.u (\"run\") \u8d70\u308b (godan, u-verb, -iru verb) | mi.ru (\"see\") \u898b\u308b (kami ichidan, ru-verb, -iru verb) | tabe.ru (\"eat\") \u98df\u3079\u308b (shimo ichidan, ru-verb, -eru verb) |- ! Negative | yom.anai \u8aad\u307e-\u306a\u3044 | hashir.anai \u8d70-\u3089\u306a\u3044 | mi.nai \u898b-\u306a\u3044 | tabe.nai \u98df\u3079-\u306a\u3044 |- ! Polite form | yom.imasu \u8aad\u307f-\u307e\u3059 | hashir.imasu \u8d70-\u308a\u307e\u3059 | mi.masu \u898b-\u307e\u3059 | tabe.masu \u98df\u3079-\u307e\u3059 |- ! Potential form | yom.eru \u8aad\u3081-\u308b | hashir.eru \u8d70-\u308c\u308b | mi.(ra)reru \u898b-(\u3089)\u308c\u308b\u00b9 \u00b2 | tabe.(ra)reru \u98df\u3079-(\u3089)\u308c\u308b\u00b9 |- ! Volitional form | yom.ou \u8aad\u3082-\u3046 | hashir.ou \u8d70-\u308d\u3046 | mi.you \u898b-\u3088\u3046 | tabe.you \u98df\u3079-\u3088\u3046 |} # Note that colloquially the \u3089 ra is dropped meaning these two become \u898b\u308c\u308b mireru and \u98df\u3079\u308c\u308b tabereru. # Can also be written as mi.eru. The difference is like the difference between \"can see\" and \"can be seen.\" Two consonant-stems that have also irregular potential forms are ik.eru/ik.areru (\"can go\") and kik.eru/kik.oeru (\"can hear\"). Other irregular potential forms are suru\u2192dekiru (\"can do\") and kuru\u2192korareru (\"can come\"). Consonant-stem verbs ending in -u (-au, -iu and -ou) may not appear to conjugate \"after a consonant\"; for example, the polite form of kau (\u8cb7\u3046, \"buy\") is kaimasu (ka.u \u2192 ka.imasu). However, the stem is in these cases technically considered to end in the consonant w. The w is normally suppressed, but surfaces in the negative form, as in kaw.anai (\"does not buy\"). Traditionally these verbs ended in -hu, which is still seen on occasion in historical kana usage, and thus unambiguously ended in h. ==Terminology== The terms \"consonant-stem\" and \"vowel-stem\" come from considering the invariant part of the verb (the verb stem) on the basis of phonemes \u2013 concretely, by writing in r\u014dmaji. This is an abstract perspective, as the consonant stem itself never occurs independently, but only with a following vowel, as Japanese words are formed of morae \u2013 concretely, writing in kana. For example, while the stem of yomu is yom-, the bare *yom is not an independent word. The standard Japanese terms, ichidan and godan, literally \"one row\" and \"five rows\", more formally monograde and pentagrade, correspond to the number of different morae (kana) that appear in the stem forms of the verb, which are then optionally combined with a suffix to form a conjugated word. Formally, verbs are classified by which column of the goj\u016bon their stem ends in, with vowel stem verbs further distinguished into i and e type. For example, \u8aad\u3080 yomu is of \u30de\u884c\u4e94\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 ma-gy\u014d go-dan katsuy\u014d \"ma-column five-row conjugation\" type, as its stem form end in each of the five rows of the \u307e column, namely \u307e\u307f\u3080\u3081\u3082: * \u8aad\u307e \u3088\u307e yoma- as in yomanai (negative, irrealis), * \u8aad\u307f \u3088\u307f yomi- as in yomimasu (polite non-past), * \u8aad\u3080 \u3088\u3080 yomu- as in yomu (plain non-past; dictionary form), * \u8aad\u3081 \u3088\u3081 yome- as in yomeba (conditional), * \u8aad\u3082 \u3088\u3082 yomo- as in yom\u014d (yomou) (hortative/volitional). Note that the volitional o stem is historically the negative a stem with euphonic sound change \u2013 and the o stem is only used for the volitional form \u2013 so these verbs were traditionally called \u56db\u6bb5 yodan \"four-row, tetragrade\", omitting the o form. While the above uses are the most common uses of the respective stems, they are used in various other ways, particularly the i stem \u2013 for example \u8aad\u307f\u7269 yomi-mono \"reading material\"; compare \u98df\u3079\u7269 tabe-mono \"food\" for vowel stem. By contrast, vowel stem verbs have a single stem form, ending either in i or e, accordingly as -iru or -eru. These are referred to respectively as \u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5 kami ichi-dan \"upper one-row\" and \u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5 shimo ichi-dan \"lower one-row\", due to i being above e in the aiueo vowel ordering. In full terminology, the column of the final kana is also listed. For \u898b\u308b \u307f\u308b miru is of \u30de\u884c\u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 ma-gy\u014d kami ichidan katsuy\u014d \"ma-column upper one-row conjugation\" type and has stem: * \u898b \u307f mi- while \u98df\u3079\u308b \u305f\u3079\u308b taberu is of \u30d0\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 ba-gy\u014d shimo ichidan katsuy\u014d \"ba-column lower one-row conjugation\" and has stem: * \u98df\u3079 \u305f\u3079 tabe- In Japanese dictionaries, in the readings of conjugable words the stem and the inflectional suffix are separated by a dot (\u30fb), as in \u8d64\u3044 \u3042\u304b\u30fb\u3044 aka.i \"red\". This is used to distinguish verb type, with consonant stem verbs having only the last kana treated as suffix, while in vowel stem verbs the last two kana are treated as suffix. The column \u884c of the conjugation form corresponds to the kana immediately after the dot. For example: * \u5e30\u308b \u304b\u3048\u30fb\u308b kae.ru \"return\" \u2013 consonant stem \u30e9\u884c\u4e94\u6bb5 * \u5909\u3048\u308b \u304b\u30fb\u3048\u308b ka.eru \"change\" \u2013 vowel stem \u30a2\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5 Note that for one-row verbs with only two kana, the entire verb is treated as a suffix, and no dot is displayed, as it would appear before the word. For example: * \u8981\u308b \u3044\u30fb\u308b i.ru \"need\" \u2013 consonant stem \u30e9\u884c\u4e94\u6bb5 * \u5c45\u308b \u3044\u308b iru \"be (animate)\" \u2013 vowel stem \u30a2\u884c\u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5 The terms \"Group I\", \"Group II\", and \"Group III\" are primarily used in Japanese language education, and may be notated as (I), (II), (III) next to a verb. Similarly, the terms \"u verb\" (\u3046 verb) and \"ru verb\" (\u308b verb) are educational terms, and may be notated as \uff08\u3046\uff09 or \uff08\u308b\uff09. ==Verbs ending in -iru and -eru== ===General=== Vowel-stem verbs, such as \u898b\u308b miru \"to see\" and \u98df\u3079\u308b taberu \"to eat,\" end either in -iru or -eru (there are no other basic-form endings for this group), but some consonant-stem verbs have these endings, too (e.g. \u6563\u308b chiru \"to scatter,\" \u6293\u3081\u308b tsumeru \"to pinch\"), and there are also \"homophone verbs\" that have either a vowel stem or a consonant stem (e.g. ikiru vowel \u751f\u304d\u308b \"to live, to stay alive,\" consonant \u71b1\u308b \"to become sultry\"; shimeru vowel \u9589\u3081\u308b \"to close [something],\" consonant \u6e7f\u308b \"to be damp\"). ===Rules of thumb=== * There are more consonant verbs than vowel verbs. * All verbs not ending in -iru/-eru are consonant-stem verbs; this includes -aru/-uru/-oru verbs and verbs with a vowel ending in the basic form, such as \u8cb7\u3046 kau \"to buy\" and \u8a00\u3046 iu \"to say.\" * Over half of verbs ending in -iru have a consonant stem (e.g., of the 419 -iru verbs listed in EDICT, 248 [ca. 60%] have a consonant stem), and the majority of verbs ending in -eru has a vowel stem (e.g., of the 3013 -eru verbs listed in EDICT, 2886 [ca. 95%] have a vowel stem). * If the vowel i/e of the ending -iru/-eru is part of a kanji (as in \u5951\u308b chigi-ru \"to pledge\" and \u5632\u308b azake-ru \"to ridicule\"), as opposed to being part of an okurigana, chances are high that the verb has a consonant stem. ** However, this rule is not applicable for two-syllable verbs (\u2f92\u308b mi-ru, for example, has a vowel stem) and verbs written only in hiragana (for example, \u3073\u3073\u308b bibiru \"to be surprised\" and \u306e\u3081\u308b nomeru \"to fall forward\" have consonant stems). Some consonant-stem verbs also have the syllable with the ending vowel written in hiragana, e.g. \u6df7\u3058\u308b ma-jiru \"to mingle\" and the mentioned-above verb \u6293\u3081\u308b tsu- meru \"to pinch.\" ** -eru verbs having the e sound written in hiragana listed in EDICT: 2934 (ca. 97% of -eru verbs listed there, of them 2901 vowel verbs and 33 consonant verbs) ** -eru verbs having the e sound in a kanji listed in EDICT: 139 (of them 39 vowel verbs and 100 consonant verbs). ===Examples of conjugation=== The \"homophone verbs\" iru (vowel: \u3044\u308b (\u5c45\u308b) to be [animated] ; consonant: \u7092\u308b to boil down, to roast, \u5165\u308b to go in, \u8981\u308b to need) and eru (vowel: \u5f97\u308b to get, to obtain; consonant: \u5f6b\u308b to carve, \u9078\u308b to choose, \u5541\u308b to ridicule): {| class=\"wikitable\" | |- ! ! Vowel stem (-iru) ! Consonant stem (-iru) ! Vowel stem (-eru) ! Consonant stem (-eru) |- ! Plain form | | | | |- ! Negative | | | | |- ! Polite form | | | | |- ! Potential form 1 | | | | |- ! Volitional form | | | | |} 1 Potential forms of consonant verbs are conjugated like vowel verbs: ireru / ereru \u2192 iremasu / eremasu, etc. The same is true for passive forms (irareru / erareru \u2192 iraremasu / eraremasu, etc.). In vowel verbs, potential and passive forms are identical (irareru / erareru). Rule of thumb: In vowel verbs, the basic-ending -ru is completely replaced by the new ending (e.g. iru / eru \u2192 inai / enai), while in consonant verbs, the -r sound is kept and followed by another vowel, to which the new ending is added (e.g. iru / eru \u2192 iranai / eranai). However, in the -te/-ta forms, consonant verbs drop the -r sound and replace it by -tte/-tta (e.g. itte, itta / ette, etta), while vowel verbs have -te/-ta (e.g. ite, ita / ete, eta). ===Lists of verbs (examples)=== The following lists are not complete; feel free to add other verbs. ====Homophone vowel-stem and consonant-stem verbs ending in -iru==== {| class=\"wikitable\" | !Verb !Vowel stem !Consonant stem |- |chibiru | | |- |hiru | | |- |ikiru | | |- |iru | | |- |kiru | | |- |komiiru | | |- |} ====Homophone vowel-stem and consonant-stem verbs ending in -eru==== {| class=\"wikitable\" | !Verb !Vowel stem !Consonant stem |- |eru | | |- |fukeru | | |- |furikaeru | | |- |fuseru | | |- |heru | | |- |hineru | | |- |kaeru | | |- |kakeru | | |- |mochikaeru | | |- |mikaeru | | |- |nameru | | |- |neru | | |- |okikaeru | | |- |shimeru | | |- |suberu | | |- |takeru | | |- |} ====Consonant-stem verbs ending in -iru==== Note: Homophone verbs listed above are not repeated here. {| class=\"wikitable\" | !Verb !Kanji and/or hiragana !English |- |aburagiru | \u8102\u304e\u308b | to be greasy |- |bibiru | \u3073\u3073\u308b | to be surprised |- |chigiru | \u5951\u308b | to pledge |- |chiru | \u6563\u308b | to scatter |- |dojiru | \u3069\u3058\u308b | to mess up (coll.) |- |guchiru | \u611a\u75f4\u308b | to grumble |- |hairu | \u5165\u308b | to enter |- |hashiru | \u8d70\u308b | to run |- |hojiru | \u7a7f\u308b | to pick, dig out |- |hotobashiru | \u8ff8\u308b | to gush, spurt |- |ibiru | \u3044\u3073\u308b | to torment, roast |- |ijiru | \u5f04\u308b | to fiddle with |- |kagiru | \u9650\u308b | to limit |- |kajiru | \u9f67\u308b | to gnaw |- |kashiru | \u546a\u308b | to curse |- |kishiru | \u304d\u3057\u308b | to become misty |- |kishiru | \u8ecb\u308b | to squeak, creak |- |kojiru | \u6289\u308b | to gouge, wrench |- |kubiru | \u62ec\u308b |to grip, strangle |- |kujiru | \u6289\u308b | to gouge, scoop |- |mairu | \u53c2\u308b | to come/go - humble |- |majiru | \u6df7\u3058\u308b | to mingle |- |meiru | \u6ec5\u5165\u308b | to feel depressed |- |mikubiru | \u898b\u7e0a\u308b | to belittle; to despise |- |minagiru | \u6f32\u308b | to overflow |- |mogiru | \u6365\u308b | to wrench |- |mojiru | \u6369\u308b | to parody, to twist |- |mushiru | \u6bdf\u308b | to pluck, to pick, to tear |- |najiru | \u8a70\u308b | to rebuke |- |nejiru | \u6369\u308b | to twist |- |nigiru | \u63e1\u308b | to grasp |- |nijiru | \u8e99\u308b | to edge forward |- |nonoshiru | \u7f75\u308b | to abuse verbally |- |ochiiru | \u9665\u308b | to fall, sink |- |omoiiru | \u601d\u3044\u5165\u308b | to ponder, to contemplate |- |omoikiru | \u601d\u3044\u5207\u308b | to dare to (usually in the form omoikitte (\u601d\u3044\u5207\u3063\u3066) or omoikitta (\u601d\u3044\u5207\u3063\u305f).) |- |sebiru | \u305b\u3073\u308b | to pester for |- |shiru | \u77e5\u308b | to know |- |soshiru | \u8b17\u308b | to slander |- |sujiru | \u6369\u308b | to wriggle |- |tagiru | \u6efe\u308b | to boil, to seethe |- |tamagiru | \u9b42\u6d88\u308b | to be frightened |- |tobashiru | \u8ff8\u308b | to gush |- |tochiru | \u3068\u3061\u308b | to muff lines |- |yajiru | \u5f25\u6b21\u308b\u30fb\u91ce\u6b21\u308b | to jeer at |- |yogiru | \u904e\u308b | to pass by, to drop in |- |yojiru | \u6369\u308b | to twist, distort |- |yokogiru | \u6a2a\u5207\u308b | to traverse |} ====Consonant-stem verbs ending in -eru==== Note: Homophone verbs listed above are not repeated here. {| class=\"wikitable\" | !Verb !Kanji and/or hiragana !English |- |aseru | \u7126\u308b | to be in a hurry |- |azakeru | \u5632\u308b | to ridicule |- |daberu | \u99c4\u5f01\u308b | to chatter |- |haberu | \u4f8d\u308b | to attend on |- |hirugaeru | \u7ffb\u308b | to turn over, to wave |- |hoteru | \u706b\u7167\u308b | to flush, to feel hot |- |kageru | \u9670\u308b | to become dark, to be in shadow or shade |- |keru | \u8e74\u308b | to kick |- |kuneru | \u304f\u306d\u308b | to be crooked |- |kutsugaeru | \u8986\u308b | to be overturned |- |numeru | \u6ed1\u308b | to be slippery |- |omoneru | \u963f\u308b | to flatter |- |seru | \u7af6\u308b | to compete |- |seseru | \u6335\u308b | to pick, play with |- |shaberu | \u558b\u308b | to talk, to chat |- |shigeru | \u8302\u308b | to grow thick |- |shikeru | \u6e7f\u6c17\u308b | to become damp |- |soberu | \u305d\u3079\u308b | to lie sprawled |- |teru | \u7167\u308b | to shine |- |tsumeru | \u6293\u3081\u308b | to pinch |- |tsuneru | \u6293\u308b | to pinch |- |uneru | \u3046\u306d\u308b | to undulate |- |yomigaeru | \u8607\u308b | to be brought back to life, to be refreshed |} ==External links== * sci.lang.japan FAQ's list of iru and eru consonant-stem verbs. * Aeron Buchanan's Japanese Verb Chart, a concise summary of all Japanese verbs conjugations on one sheet of A4 ==References== *Seiichi Makino and Michio Tsutsui, A dictionary of intermediate Japanese grammar, published by The Japan Times, .
