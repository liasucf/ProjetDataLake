By 1970 architectural themes, from detailed stained glass windows to abstracted storefronts or city skylines, dominated his oeuvre. Carol Damian of the Frost Art Museum (Miami FL) described his work as studies in \"horizontals and verticals, bold stripes of color, and the ever-present shadows, especially diagonal shadows that he so favored, with darks and lights in repetition.\"Damian, Carol. \"Emilio Sanchez.\" Vie des Arts 53.215 (2009) Print. Web. For her, Sanchez's work was \"not a picture of something, but the application of pigment onto a flat surface to become a singular object to its own definition.\" == Early life == Emilio S\u00e1nchez Fonts was born in Camag\u00fcey, Cuba, in 1921 to Estrella Fonts and Emilio S\u00e1nchez.Angeline, John; Bleys, Rudi C.; and DiazCasas, Rafael.

In 1949 his first solo exhibition, held at Joseph Luyber Gallery (New York NY), was followed by solo exhibitions in 1951 at Ferargil Gallery in New York and Ateneo Espa\u00f1ol in Mexico City.\"Sanchez-Exhibitions.\" Emilio Sanchez Foundation.

In 1968 Sanchez became an American citizen. He also signed with the renown Associated American Artists (New York NY) which held solo exhibitions of his work in 1968, in 1971 and 1981. Although Sanchez continually explored a variety of subjects including fruit, flowers, clotheslines, sailboats, and sunsets, by 1971, architectural themes, such as the arched doorways of the Medio Punto oil paintings, emerged as his signature subject.Angeline, John; Bleys, Rudi C.; and DiazCasas, Rafael.

At this time solo exhibitions of his work were held throughout Latin America at the Museo Bellas Artes (Caracas, Venezuela), La Tertulia Museum (Cali, Colombia), Museo Ponce (Ponce PR) as well as the Center for Inter-American Relations (New York NY). During the 1970s frequent trips to the Mediterranean inspired Sanchez to adopt a more geometric and minimalist approach in his Moroccan paintings or Boston City Hall drawings. By the late 1980s, however, he turned his attention to New York scenes and depicted Bronx bodegas, storefronts, and garages as solid blocks of color. During this time he exhibited at the Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale and the Miami-Dade Public Library in Florida as well as at galleries in Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton and Coral Gables, and in Miami, home to many exiled Cubans. Although Sanchez increasingly experienced vision problems, he continued to paint until his death in Warwick, New York, in 1999.\"Untitled, Bronx Storefront, \"La Rumba Supermarket.\" Smithsonian American Art Museum.

Web' == Recognition and contribution == Sanchez's paintings and prints drew the attention of both the public and critics as early as 1958. In 1967 he was interviewed for the series Listening with Pictures by Arlene Jacobowitz, Assistant Curator of Paintings and Sculpture of the Brooklyn Museum of Art.\"Sanchez-Interview.\" Emilio Sanchez Foundation Web. He was also recognized internationally and was awarded first prize at the 1974 Biennial in San Juan, Puerto Rico. During his career, his critical supporters included American art collector Barbara Duncan and A Hyatt Mayor, print curator at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. In style and subject matter Sanchez's work reflected both Latin-American and American culture. His colorful Caribbean palette and interest in light and shadow on vernacular architecture is attributed to his formative years in Cuba. Although his flat, sometimes abstract, geometric style was not unlike his Brazilian contemporaries Alfredo Volpi and Livio Abramo, his paintings evoked a sense of place that, for art historian Rafael D\u00edazCasas, reflected a \"feeling of displacement\" and \"idea of an absent household\".\"Thirteen paintings and works on paper by Emilio Sanchez at Frederico S\u00e8ve Gallery.\" Art Daily. 2011.Web.Angeline, John; Bleys, Rudi C.; and DiazCasas, Rafael.
