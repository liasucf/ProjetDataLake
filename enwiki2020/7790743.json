It originally featured The Bridge Cinema De Lux, a luxury movie theater with IMAX screens, several restaurants including Johnny Rockets, Islands, On The Border, Subway and Starbucks, plus a Nordstrom Rack, and Borders Books and Music. The movie theater was eventually purchased by Rave Cinemas and operated under the Rave banner until the theater was one of the 32 locations that was purchased by Cinemark in 2012, but the theater still retained Rave logo until 2015 when it was renovated to be one of Cinemark's flagship theaters, featuring 18 screens, some featuring Cinemark XD. The center was popular around its opening but over the years lost popularity due to its proximity to Westfield Culver City, and it lost some of its big tenants including Borders which closed in 2011 due to the chains liquidation, and Nordstrom Rack which relocated to Westfield Culver City in 2013. On The Border closed and was replaced by Souplantation until it closed in 2017. It did however, manage to attract new tenants to fill some of the vacant space including Buffalo Wild Wings, Dave & Busters, and Kabuki Japanese Restaurant. The Laurus Corp. acquired the Howard Hughes Center, including The Promenade, in 2015. Laurus announced plans for a large-scale residential expansion, remodeling, and overhaul designed by the Jerde Partnership.LAcurbed.com: \"Giant Howard Hughes Center Mall Getting a Total Makeover\"; by Bianca Barragan, 19 June 2015.Los Angeles Times.com: \"New owners plan $30-million face lift for Promenade at Howard Hughes Center \"; 18 June 2015.
