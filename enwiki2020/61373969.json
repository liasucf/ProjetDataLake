T\u0101rore holds a copy of the Gospel of Luke in te reo M\u0101ori. The words around her head translate from te reo as \"Peace be with you\". Below is the tree of life, a Joshua Tree. T\u0101rore (?1824\u20131836) was the daughter of Wiremu Ng\u0101kuku, a (chief) of the M\u0101ori (tribe) Ng\u0101ti Hau\u0101 in the North Island of New Zealand. She was considered a child prodigy, a Christian martyr and her story is treasured by the New Zealand church. ==Ministry== T\u0101rore was taught to read from the (M\u0101ori language) Gospel of Luke, from the Bible, by Charlotte Brown of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) from the age of ten. She was considered a prodigy because of her ability to memorise much of the book. She would recite portions of the Gospel to crowds of 200\u2013300 of her people and was supported by her father as a lay evangelist. ==Murder== In October 1836, T\u0101rore was evacuated with the other pupils from her CMS school in Matamata, because of a violent and cannibalistic conflict between iwi. She took her father's rare te reo M\u0101ori Gospel of Luke in a small (basket) she wore around her neck. Whilst stopped for the night of 18 October near the Wairere Falls in the Kaimai Ranges, her party of 24, including her peace- loving father, was attacked by a Ng\u0101ti Whakaue war party from Rotorua, T\u0101rore was murdered and the book stolen by warrior Paora Te Uita. Her ritualistically mutilated body was carried back to the Matamata mission station and was given a Christian burial. The M\u0101ori law of required revenge for her death, but at her (funeral) her Christian father spoke words of forgiveness and said \"do not rise up to obtain satisfaction for her. God will do that.\" ==Aftermath== Several weeks later, back in Rotorua, Uita asked visiting ex-slave, mission school educated Ripahau (aka Matahau) of Ng\u0101ti Raukawa to explain the book to him. This led him to become a Christian and to ask for forgiveness from Ng\u0101kuku, leading to their reconciliation. The book, identified by Ngakuku's inscribed name, was then taken south and ended up in the hands of Ripahau again in \u014ctaki. It continued to play a key role in M\u0101ori evangelising to M\u0101ori for years to come, including the introduction of the Gospel to the South Island for the first time. ==Legacy== T\u0101rore's grave was located in 1976 at the Matamata (fortification) site near the village of Waharoa, and the following year a white cross headstone and plaque were created to commemorate her death, her father's forgiveness and the spread of Christianity through New Zealand that was influenced by her book. In 1997, The Legend of Tarore documentary was broadcast on New Zealand national television. In 2009, the Churches Education Commission gave 240,000 free copies of Joy Cowley and Mary Clover Bibby's book T\u0101rore and her Book to New Zealand primary schools because of its historical significance to both M\u0101ori and Christianity in Aotearoa New Zealand. T\u0101rore's story has been described as \"the iconic narrative of the early missionary period\" in New Zealand. While the Archbishop of Canterbury's Representative to the Holy See, Sir David Moxon described T\u0101rore's story and Gospel book as \"amongst the taonga (treasures) of the Church in Aotearoa\". ==References== Category:Ng\u0101ti Hau\u0101 Category:1836 deaths Category:Converts to Christianity from pagan religions Category:New Zealand M\u0101ori women Category:19th-century New Zealand women ",
