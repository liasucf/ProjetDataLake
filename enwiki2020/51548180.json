    "text": "Rupert D. V. Glasgow (born 1964 in Sheffield, England) is an institutionally independent translator, philosopher and writer. Glasgow studied French and German at St. John's College, Oxford, UK. His translations from German into English include letters of Martin Heidegger to his wife. Translations from the Spanish include a collection of stories by Augusto Monterroso. Glasgow's writings concern the history of ideas, including comedy, laughter, the mind, as well as the concepts of water and of self. Glasgow taught philosophy courses on 'The Phylogeny of the Self' to biologists at the Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology, Magdeburg, and the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, and received a PhD for a thesis on this topic from the Graduate School of Humanities at the Julius-Maximilians University of W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, under the supervision of Roland Borgards, Karl Mertens, and Martin Heisenberg. Upon invitation, Glasgow presented his work to the German Science Foundation Research Training Group Emotions at the Julius-Maximilians Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, Germany (2008), at the Centre for Genomic Regulation, Barcelona, Spain (2012), as well as at the Minibrains conference of the European Science Foundation/ European Molecular Biology Organization (2014). == Bibliography == Publications * R.D.V.
