    "text": "In number theory, the sum of two squares theorem relates the prime decomposition of any integer to whether it can be written as a sum of two squares, such that for some integers , . :An integer greater than one can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if its prime decomposition contains no term , where prime p \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4 and k is odd. This theorem supplements Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares which says when a prime number can be written as a sum of two squares, in that it also covers the case for composite numbers. ==Examples== The prime decomposition of the number 2450 is given by 2450 = 257. Of the primes occurring in this decomposition, 2, 5, and 7, only 7 is congruent to 3 modulo 4. Its exponent in the decomposition, 2, is even. Therefore, the theorem states that it is expressible as the sum of two squares. Indeed, . The prime decomposition of the number 3430 is 257. This time, the exponent of 7 in the decomposition is 3, an odd number. So 3430 cannot be written as the sum of two squares. == See also == * Brahmagupta\u2013Fibonacci identity.
