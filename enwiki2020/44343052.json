    "text": "Heinz Sch\u00e4fer (born c. 1930/31) is a former East German Stasi officer who was present during at least two significant European events of the Cold War years. ==Checkpoint Charlie== On 27 October 1961, Soviet and US forces confronted one another at Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie, creating the potential for all-out war between the powers. Heinz Sch\u00e4fer was an East German border guard at the time, and states that only by keeping calm did both sides avoid catastrophic confrontation. ==Opening of the Berlin Wall== 9 November 1989 marked the opening of the Berlin Wall. Sch\u00e4fer\u2014at the time a Stasi colonel\u2014claims to have been the first to open the wall, having ordered his men to deactivate the automatically triggered weapons at his Waltersdorf Chaussee/Rudow Chaussee border crossing, and then to have ordered the opening of the gate. His account places his actions hours ahead of Harald J\u00e4ger, who has long been recognized as the first East German officer to breach the wall, at the Bornholmer crossing. However, unlike J\u00e4ger's station, Sch\u00e4fer's facility at Waltersdorf- Rudow was small and had no television coverage. Therefore, there is no confirming documentation of Sch\u00e4fer's account. Sch\u00e4fer came forward with these conflicting claims during a 2009 gathering of school girls. If true, his actions would explain reports of East Berliners in West Berlin hours before the opening of J\u00e4ger's Bornholmer checkpoint. From accounts by both Sch\u00e4fer and J\u00e4ger, the two made their decisions independently of one other, without orders from supervisors. ==References== Category:Stasi officers Category:1931 births Category:People from Berlin Category:Berlin Wall Category:Living people Category:1980s in Berlin Category:Cold War ",
