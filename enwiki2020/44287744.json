    "text": "Ingvar Cronhammar: Omen (1993) in Visby, Sweden Ingvar Cronhammar (born 17 December 1947) is a Swedish-Danish sculptor who has lived in Denmark since 1965. He has gained a unique place in Danish art with his dark monumental works, often presenting an eerie confrontation between modern technology and the primitive past. ==Biography== Elia (2009) in Herning, Denmark Born in H\u00e4ssleholm in the south of Sweden, he moved to Denmark in 1965 where he studied at the Jutland Art Academy in Aarhus from 1967 to 1971. Until the early 1980s, inspired by environmental art from America, his spectacular works revealed his fascination with conflict and provocation and his contempt for convention. An early example was Koncert for en hjemmev\u00e6rnsmand (Concert for the Home Guard, 1969) featuring live chickens with lamps strapped to their backs. In 1979, he presented chairs draped with pigskin and a parasol with swastikas. Over the years, his works have become increasingly larger, often with a sacred look, simultaneously inducing fascination and disgust. The Gate (1988) presents an infernal machine of steel, sound, light and movement, representing a confrontation with death. The direct confrontation of work and nature is also apparent in his gigantic Elia (1989\u20132001) in Herning, conceived as a fire-spitting temple of dark steel. His fascination with machines also produced works with animal bones, bird wings and skin, juxtaposing nature with culture and creating visions combining primitive elements with modern technology. Cronhammar stands alone in Danish culture with his huge monumental, machine-like works which he has created with dark materials such as mahogany, steel and rubber. They can be found both in museums and as public works across the country. The Herning Museum of Contemporary Art exhibits a large collection of his works. ==Awards== In 1993, Cronhammar was awarded the Eckersberg Medal and, in 2003, the Thorvaldsen Medal. He was decorated a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 2007. ==References== ==Literature== * * ==External links== *Ingvar Cronhammar's website *Comprehensive list of Cronhammar's works from KunstOnline *Illustrated portrait of Ingvar Cronhammar from KunstOnline Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Swedish male sculptors Category:People from H\u00e4ssleholm Municipality Category:Recipients of the Thorvaldsen Medal Category:Recipients of the Eckersberg Medal Category:Knights of the Order of the Dannebrog Category:Naturalised citizens of Denmark Category:Swedish contemporary artists ",
