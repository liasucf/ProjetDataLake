    "text": "Canoeing competitions at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru, are scheduled to be held at the Rio Canete located in the city of Lunahuan\u00e1 (slalom) and Albufera Medio Mundo in the city of Huacho (sprint). The sprint competitions will start on July 27 and finish on the 30th, while slalom will start on the August 2nd and finish on the 4th. In 2016, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) made several changes to its sports program, which were subsequently implemented for these games. Included in this was the addition of the women's C2 500 metres event in sprint (the women's C1 200 metres event was also added to the Olympics, but was already contested at the Toronto 2015 Pan American Games). This also meant the removal of two men's events in sprint (C1 200 and K2 200). Also added to just the Pan American Games program was the addition of two extreme (head to head) slalom kayak events. 18 medal events are scheduled to be contested, 12 in sprint (six per gender) and six in slalom (three per gender). ==Medal table== ==Medallists== ===Slalom=== {| |- |Men's C-1 | | | |- |Women's C-1 | | | |-bgcolor=#DDDDDD |colspan=7| |- |Men's K-1 | | | |- |Women's K-1 | | | |-bgcolor=#DDDDDD |colspan=7| |- |Men's extreme K-1 | | | |- | | | | |} ===Sprint=== ;Men {| |- |Men's C-1 1000 m | | | |- |Men's C-2 1000 m | Serguey Torres Fernando Jorge | Craig Spence Drew Hodges | Guillermo Quirino Rigoberto Camilo |-bgcolor=#DDDDDD |colspan=7| |- |Men's K-1 200 m | | | |- |Men's K-1 1000 m | | | |- |Men's K-2 1000 m || Manuel Lascano Agust\u00edn Vernice || Jacob Steele Jarret Kenke || Oabaldo Fuentes Mauricio Figueroa |- |Men's K-4 500 m | Manuel Lascano Juan Ignacio C\u00e1ceres Ezequiel Di Giacomo Gonzalo Carreras | Reinier Carrera Renier Mora Robert Ben\u00edtez Fidel Antonio Vargas | Javier L\u00f3pez Juan Rodr\u00edguez Mauricio Figueroa Osbaldo Fuentes |} ;Women {| |- | | | | |- | | Mayvihanet Borges Katherin Nuevo | Karen Roco Mar\u00eda Mailliard | Anne Lavoie-Parent Rowan Hardy-Kavanagh |-bgcolor=#DDDDDD |colspan=7| |- | | | | |- | | | | |- | || Andr\u00e9anne Langlois Alanna Bray-Lougheed || Mar\u00eda Garro Brenda Rojas || Beatriz Briones Karina Alan\u00eds |- | | Andr\u00e9anne Langlois Alexa Irvin Alanna Bray-Lougheed Anna Negulic | Beatriz Briones Karina Alan\u00eds Brenda Guti\u00e9rrez Maricela Montemayor | Mar\u00eda Garro Micaela Maslein Brenda Rojas Sabrina Ameghino |} ==Qualification== A total of 169 canoe and kayak athletes will qualify to compete. 125 will qualify in sprint (60 per gender plus five wild cards) and 44 in canoe slalom (22 per gender).
