He has written extensively about a wide assortment of philosophical figures and movements as well as a broad array of cultural problems and issues.\u201cJohn J. Stuhr, Genealogical Pragmatism,\u201d http://www.sunypress.edu/p-2660-genealogical-pragmatism.aspx. Retrieved 15 April 2017. His work is known for its lively, engaged, and direct style. He draws critically on thinkers from often separated philosophical traditions (such as Pragmatism, Neopragmatism, Continental Philosophy, Critical Theory, Postmodernism, and Deconstruction). Revealing his impatience with narrow and academic conceptions of philosophy, his writings make deep and consistent use of poetry, painting, photography, and the lyrics of contemporary music, and they exhibit a broad interdisciplinary reach across fields such as rhetoric, media studies, relativity theory, political and legal theory, cultural geography, and economics.John J.

His father, an aspiring poet, left the humanities and arts after World War II to become a founding partner in the country's first consulting firm to provide strategic planning for colleges and universities. He also served as Executive Director of the Economic Club of Chicago.John J. Stuhr, \u201cBetween the Lines of Age,\u201d The Philosophical I: Personal Reflections on Life and Philosophy, ed. George Yancy (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2002), pp. 43-68. Growing up in the Chicago area and surrounded at home by philosophy and poetry and liberal politics, Stuhr attended New Trier High School. He then earned his B.A. in philosophy from Carleton College, studying with philosophers Roy Elveton, Gary Iseminger, Maury Landsman, and Perry Mason, classics scholar David H. Porter, and economist Robert E. Will.David H. Porter and Merrill E. Jarchow, Carleton Remembered 1909-1986 (Northfield, MN: Carleton College, 1987), pp. vii-xi, 163-165. Abandoning at the last moment his plans for law school, in less than three years he earned both an M.A. and Ph.D. in philosophy from Vanderbilt University, where he studied with John J. Compton, Michael Hodges, Charles E. Scott, and Robert C. Williams. Under the direction of John Lachs, he wrote a dissertation, Experience as Activity: Dewey\u2019s Metaphysics, focused on pragmatism and its historical roots in the thought of Aristotle and Hegel.\u201cDoctoral Dissertations,\u201d The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. 31, No. 1 (Sep., 1977), p. 175. == Career == Stuhr began his teaching career at the age of 24.

Throughout his university administrative work, Stuhr has evidenced strong commitment to philosophical pluralism and institutional diversity, a push for growth and an advocacy for philosophy and the humanities, and a determination to make strong faculty appointments and to provide the intellectual space for them to do high-quality work.John J. Stuhr, \u201cFundamentalism and the Empire of Philosophy: What Constitutes a Pluralist Department?,\u201d Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association, 70 (2), 1996, pp. 172-179. At Whitman College, for example, during Stuhr's leadership the philosophy department doubled in size and added the first women and first African-American philosophers in the institution's history. At the University of Oregon, the Humanities Center grew rapidly (fueled by major private fundraising) and engaged a highly diverse group of scholars on campus and intellectual leaders across the state.\u201cHistory,\u201d Oregon Humanities Center http://ohc.uoregon.edu/history.html.

Lysaker, Marta Jimenez, Melvin Rogers (now at Brown University), Susan M. Bredlau, Dilek Huseyinzadegan, and George Dewey Yancy.This is most evident through the annual changes noted in The Guide to Graduate Programs in Philosophy, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, The American Philosophical Association, http://www.apaonline.org/?page=gradguide.

Lluana McCann (Eugene, OR: University of Oregon, 1989), pp. 71-92. == Philosophical themes == === Genealogical pragmatism === The newest version of pragmatism included in American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia,American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia, eds. John Lachs and Robert Talisse (New York: Routledge, 2007). Stuhr's genealogical pragmatism, a break from most traditional philosophy, draws on the work of 19th and 20th century American and European thinkers\u2014particularly John Dewey's account of philosophy's \u201cgenetic method\u201d and Foucault's genealogy\u2014to develop a multiperspectival, fallible, always uncertain and unfinished, and irreducibly normative philosophy that is both critical and reconstructive in intent and effect. Stuhr argues that this philosophy is both instrumental\u2014a criticism of the present on behalf of possibilities inherent in the present\u2014and genealogical\u2014a history of the present on behalf of future possibilities that are not inherent or imagined in the present. Stuhr stresses that this pragmatism does not even attempt to solve the problems of traditional philosophies: \u201cInstead, studying both their ends and the means by which they have cloaked these ends in their self-proclaimed problems, methods, and systems, it localizes and abandons these philosophies.\u201dStuhr, Genealogical Pragmatism, pp. ix-x. In this context, Stuhr examines the spread of a business or corporate approach to education and critical thought that marginalizes critical thought, develops a relational account of temporal experience and a relational, radical empiricist, relativistic account of values, and formulates a critical community politics that he applies to issues of economic inequality, higher education, and the disillusioned recognition of unreconstructed personal death.Cynthia A. Gayman, Book Review of Genealogical Pragmatism: Philosophy, Experience, and Community, Journal of Speculative Philosophy, Vol. 13, No. 2 (1999), Penn State University Press, pp. 147-150. === Pragmatism and postmodernism === In a key chapter in Genealogical Pragmatism, \u201cThe Idols of the Twilight: Pragmatism and Postmodernism,\u201d Stuhr shows how many pragmatists and many postmodernists are \u201cchildren of Emerson\u201d and, beginning with James and Nietzsche, he carefully charts their similarities and their differences. Stressing the reality of time and change, in Pragmatism, Postmodernism, and the Future of Philosophy, Stuhr focuses on the ways in which these philosophical traditions present us with a Herculean labor to think and live differently in the future.Thomas Keith, Review of Pragmatism, Postmodernism, and the Future of Philosophy, Essays in Philosophy, Vol. 7, No. 2 (2007), article 5. In particular, Stuhr suggests that the work of writers such as Deleuze, Adorno, and Foucault are crucial resources for pragmatist thinkers who find in earlier pragmatism \u201can account of inquiry insufficiently attuned to issues of power, struggle, and multiplicity; a radically democratic ideal in need of response to threats from new technologies and the defects of liberal governments and societies; a pluralism in tension with pragmatism\u2019s understanding of its own values, methods, and future, and a view of philosophy as criticism that needs to become more critically self-reflective about its own history and effects, and about challenges to its very existence in possible post-critical societies.\u201dStuhr, Pragmatism and Postmodernism, pp. 1-2. Stuhr's vision here is thoroughly democratic\u2014he spells out a notion of democracy as a way of life (and one in the face of terrorism)\u2014and thoroughly this-worldly\u2014he concludes with \u201cno consolation\u201d by providing an account of \u2018life without spirituality\u201d and \u201cphilosophy without transcendence.\u201d === Philosophies as fashions, philosophy as expressivist === In Pragmatism, Postmodernism, and the Future of Philosophy, Stuhr characterized his genealogical pragmatism as a \u201ccritically pluralistic way of thinking\u201d and \u201ca way of living of great, ordinary love and sadness.\u201d And he noted that philosophy is less a matter of argument and proof than of suggestion and evocation. These two themes\u2014pluralism (across politics, morals, epistemologies, and ontologies) and philosophy as personal vision and creative, evocative art\u2014are developed thoroughly in Pragmatic Fashions: Pluralism, Democracy, Relativism, and the Absurd. This book advances in part through a large number of paintings and the author's photographs and poems, suggests that different philosophies be understood as different and multiple personal visions of the world\u2014just as we might see differences in the music of Beethoven and Beyonc\u00e9, the paintings of El Greco and Monet, or the writings of Jane Austen and James Baldwin.Jacquelyn A. K. Kegley, Book Review of Pragmatic Fashions: Pluralism, Democracy, Relativism, and the Absurd, Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews, 06/23/2016: http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/pragmatic-fashions- pluralism-democracy-relativism-and-the-absurd/. Retrieved: 21 April 2017. Stuhr writes that this expressivist view of philosophy \u201cis intimately attuned to key sensibilities of pragmatism\u2014attuned to a deep fallibilism and experimentalism, pluralism and a thoroughgoing temporalism, a radically empirical relationalism or relativism, a commitment to methods of experimental intelligence and democratic practice, and an orientation to this world and the finitude of human life.\u201dStuhr, Pragmatic Fashions: Pluralism, Democracy, Relativism, and the Absurd, p. 2. Stuhr shows how this view illuminates philosophical disagreements in accounts of reality, knowledge, values, and political issues such as democracy, terrorism, and war. After setting forth an \u201cabsurd pragmatism\u201d that draws as much or more on Camus than on James\u2014Stuhr calls Sisyphysus \u201ca pragmatist hero\u201d--,Ibid, pp. 5, 218-221. he sets forth a deeply personal, lyrical view of life that acknowledges both human finitude and human passion. ==Personal life== Stuhr has two adult children and is married to Jessica T.
