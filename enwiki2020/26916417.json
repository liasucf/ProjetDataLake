It would have allowed personal marijuana and hemp cultivation or use without a license and created a commission to regulate the sale of commercial marijuana. The act would also have set aside two percent of profits from cannabis sales to promote industrial hemp, biodiesel, fiber, protein and oil. Measure 80 was defeated 53.44%-46.56%. ==Ballot qualification== OCTA organizers stated a goal of collecting 130,000 signatures of registered Oregon state voters before submitting a request to the Secretary of State for ballot inclusion.
