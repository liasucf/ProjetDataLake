Individuals are restricted to rock outcrops and granite caves in forested areas. It is sympatric with Gehyra mutilata, Hemidactylus depressus, H. frenatus and H. parvimaculatus. Researchers identified the species is Critically Endangered due to low numbers and density only recorded from four locations. ==Description== An adult male is 28.5 mm long. Dorsum homogeneous with smooth granular scales. Chin with smooth granules whereas gular, pectoral and abdominal scales are smooth. There are 19 belly scales across mid body. Tubercles on posterior flank are weakly developed. Para vertebral granules linearly arranged. Body short and slender. Head large and depressed. Snout relatively long. Pupil round.

The argument was largely due to unknowing about binomial nomenclature in zoological taxonomy among people. They indicated that the usage of heroes' names gives by equating the national heroes to geckos. However, researchers neglect that sentence and explained that the name is given only to honor the personality. ==References== kivulegedarai Category:Endemic fauna of Sri Lanka Category:Reptiles of Sri Lanka Category:Reptiles described in 2019 ",
