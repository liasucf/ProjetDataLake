As host wing, the 316 WG operates, administers and maintains the base. The 316th Wing was activated on June 11, 2020, becoming the host wing for JBA and taking on the Airmen and units of the 11th Wing. The wing's Operations Group was a highly decorated C-47 Skytrain unit that served with Ninth Air Force and Twelfth Air Force in the European Theater of Operations and the Mediterranean theaters during World War II. The wing's officially stated mission is \"Respond, Honor, Defend, Support and Care...to project airpower and diplomacy from America's Airfield\". ==Overview== As the host wing for Joint Base Andrews, Md., the 316th Wing is responsible for maintaining emergency reaction rotary-wing airlift and other National Capital Region contingency response capabilities critical to national security and for organizing, training, equipping and deploying combat-ready forces for Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEFs).

The commander of the 316th Wing is Colonel TYLER R. SCHAFF. Its Command Chief Master Sergeant is Chief Master Sergeant THOMAS C. DANIELS. ==History== The wing was originally established as the 316th Troop Carrier Wing in 1947 at the former Greeneville AFB, SC, primarily operating the C-47 and C-82. It was subsequently inactivated in 1949. In 1966, the unit was reactivated at Langley AFB, VA as the 316th Tactical Airlift Wing (316 TAW) of the Tactical Air Command (TAC). The 316 TAW conducted C-130 replacement training from January 1966 to November 1967 and C-130 maintenance training from February to December 1966. In late 1967, the 316 TAW relinquished its training mission and became a typical operational tactical airlift wing with the C-130E Hercules. As an operational wing, the organization operated three tactical airlift squadrons in addition to its various maintenance and support squadrons. The 316 TAW participated in joint airborne training, glider training, exercises maneuvers, and ferried freight in the United States and overseas. It also participated in worldwide tactical airlift operations, humanitarian missions, and special exercises and maneuvers, including joint airborne training. In 1973, the wing also participated in repatriation of South Vietnamese and American prisoners of war from North Vietnam. In 1975, all tactical airlift assets in TAC were transferred to the Military Airlift Command (MAC). With TAC Headquarters being at Langley AFB, and with the pending arrival of the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing (1 TFW) and the first operational F-15A Eagles at Langley, MAC and TAC agreed to inactivate the 316 TAW and two of its three tactical airlift squadrons. All of the wing's C-130 aircraft assets were redistributed to other C-130 wings with the exception of the 36th Tactical Airlift Squadron (36 TAS), now known as the 36th Airlift Squadron, which was reassigned with its personnel and C-130E aircraft to the 62nd Military Airlift Wing (62 MAW), now known as the 62nd Airlift Wing (62 AW), a then-C-141 Starlifter strategic airlift wing at McChord AFB, WA in the summer of 1975. From 1980\u20131991, the 1776th Air Base Wing (1776 ABW) was the host wing that operated, administered and maintained Andrews AFB, MD for all its tenant commands. The 1776 ABW wing was consolidated with the newly established 316th Wing (316 WG) on 21 June 2006. In addition to base operations and support of Andrews AFB, the 316 WG also operated UH-1N Twin Huey aircraft for quick-reaction rotary-wing airlift in the National Capital Region. Upon the recommendation of Base Realignment and Closure, 2005, the 11th Wing of Bolling Air Force Base merged with the 316th Wing and was redesignated the 11th Wing at Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility.Mission, movement, manning \u2013 installation members stand at ready for 11 WG merger United States Air Force In June 2020, the Air Force and Navy agreed to transfer control of Joint Base Anacostia Bolling from the Navy to the Air Force, based on the predominance of Air Force 'mission sets\" at the joint base. in connection with this transfer, the 11th Wing moved to Anacostia Bolling to assume responsibilities there. The 316th Wing was reactivated on 12 June 2020 and assumed the 11th Wing's responsibilities at Andrews. ==Units== ; 316th Operations Group * 1st Helicopter Squadron *316th Operations Support Squadron ; 316th Mission Support Group * 316th Civil Engineer Squadron * 316th Contracting Squadron * 316th Logistics Readiness Squadron * 316th Force Support Squadron * 316th Security Forces Squadron ; 316th Medical Group * 316th Dental Squadron * 316th Medical Squadron * 316th Medical Support Squadron * 316th Medical Operations Squadron * 316th Aerospace Medical Squadron * 316th Surgical Squadron ==History== : See the 316th Operations Group for additional history and lineage and history prior to 1947 ==Lineage== * Established as 316th Troop Carrier Wing on 29 July 1947 : Organized on 15 August 1947 : Discontinued on 25 August 1948 * Redesignated 316th Troop Carrier Wing, Medium, and activated on 23 August 1948 : Inactivated on 20 October 1949 * Redesignated 316th Troop Carrier Wing, Assault, and activated, on 15 November 1965 : Organized on 25 November 1965 : Redesignated: 316th Troop Carrier Wing on 1 March 1966 : Redesignated: 316th Tactical Airlift Wing on 1 May 1967 : Inactivated on 1 October 1975 * Consolidated (21 June 2006) with 1776th Air Base Wing which activated on 15 December 1980 : Inactivated on 12 July 1991 * Redesignated 316th Wing on 21 June 2006 : Activated on 22 June 2006 : Inactivated on 30 September 2010 * Activated on 12 June 2020 ===Assignments=== * Ninth Air Force, 15 August 1947 \u2013 25 August 1948; 23 August 1948 * Fourteenth Air Force, 1 February-20 October 1949 * Tactical Air Command, 15 November 1965 * 840th Air Division, 25 November 1965 * Ninth Air Force, 24 December 1969 * 839th Air Division, 31 March 1970 * Twenty-First Air Force, 31 December 1974 \u2013 1 October 1975 : Attached to Operating Location A, Headquarters Twenty-First Air Force, 31 December 1974 \u2013 30 June 1975 * 76th Airlift Division, 15 December 1980 * Twenty-First Air Force, 1 October 1985 \u2013 12 July 1991 * Air Force District of Washington, 22 June 2006 \u2013 30 September 2010 * Air Force District of Washington, 12 June 2020 \u2013 present ===Components=== '; Groups * 316th Troop Carrier Group (later 316th Operations Group): 15 August 1947 \u2013 25 August 1948; 23 August 1948 \u2013 20 October 1949; 22 June 2006 \u2013 30 September 2010; 12 June 2020 \u2013 present ; Squadrons * 29th Tactical Airlift Squadron: 1 April-15 November 1971 * 36th Troop Carrier Squadron (later 36th Tactical Airlift Squadron): 1 April 1966 \u2013 25 March 1968 (detached 28 March-29 June 1967); 5 July 1968 \u2013 1 July 1975 (detached 25 February \u2013 15 June 1969, 24 November 1969 \u2013 7 February 1970, 13 August \u2013 18 October 1970, 12 July \u2013 10 September 1971, 20 May \u2013 8 September 1972, 12 March \u2013 18 May 1973, 14 January \u2013 16 March 1974, and 13 August \u2013 16 October 1974) * 37th Troop Carrier Squadron (later 37th Tactical Airlift Squadron): 1 October 1966 \u2013 15 September 1975 (detached 24 September \u2013 21 December 1967, 27 April \u2013 13 May 1968, 24 November 1968 \u2013 5 March 1969, 13 July \u2013 26 September 1969, 1 March \u2013 11 May 1970, 7 February \u2013 13 April 1971, 5 January \u2013 13 March 1972, 30 November 1972 \u2013 15 March 1973, 31 August \u2013 16 November 1973, 12 April \u2013 29 June 1974, and 5 April \u2013 15 June 1975) * 38th Troop Carrier Squadron (later 38th Tactical Airlift Squadron): 1 January 1967 \u2013 1 July 1969 (detached 5 February \u2013 22 July 1968); 15 November 1971 \u2013 31 August 1975 (detached 13 March \u2013 16 May 1972, 31 August \u2013 5 December 1972, 18 May-13 July 1973, 29 August \u2013 3 October 1973, 13 December 1974 \u2013 15 February 1975; not operational, 1 July \u2013 31 August 1975) * 316th Field Maintenance Squadron (TAC) 1 April 1966 \u2013 15 September 1975 ===Stations=== * Greenville Army Air Base (later Greenville Air Force Base), South Carolina, 15 August 1947 \u2013 25 August 1948 * Greenville Air Force Base, South Carolina, 23 August 1948 \u2013 20 October 1949 * Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, 25 November 1965 \u2013 1 October 1975 * Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, 15 December 1980 \u2013 12 July 1991 * Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, 22 June 2006 \u2013 30 September 2010; 11 June 2020 \u2013 Present * Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, 12 June 2020 \u2013 present ===Aircraft=== * Douglas C-47 Skytrain (1947\u20131949) * Fairchild C-82 Packet (1947\u20131949) * Waco CG-15 (1947\u20131949) * Lockheed C-130 Hercules (1966\u20131975) * Bell UH-1N Twin Huey (2006\u20132010, 2020\u2013present) ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== Category:Military units and formations in Maryland 0316 ",
