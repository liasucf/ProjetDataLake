    "text": "Juan Herreros (born 1958, San Lorenzo del Escorial) is a Spanish architect. His work promotes a pragmatic review of the tradition of modern architecture. == Biography == He graduated in 1985 at the Technical School of Architecture of Madrid where after being professor of construction until 1988 he became professor of Architectural Design obtaining his PhD in 1994 and the title of Professor in 2010. Since 2007 teaches at Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation in New York where he holds the rank of Professor in Professional Practice. He has also taught at American universities of Princeton in New Jersey, Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago; and European Architectural Association in London, EPFL Lausanne, Ljubljana and Alicante. It has approached the architecture to the world of art in the second half of the twentieth century with collaborations with artists as different kinds Antoni Muntadas or the American Dan Graham. In 1984 he founded \u00c1balos & Herreros and in 1999 the LMI (Multimedia International League). He has been juror in several national and international competitions, biennials and international awards, editorial advisor of specialized media and member of several expert committees on academic, sustainability and technology programs such as the Material Science Congress at the University of Columbia. His work has explored since the organizational principles of skyscrapers as a generator of generic multifunctional typologies. They were also pioneers in the use of diagrams and abstract information as display mechanism of non- evident relationships. In 2008 the firm \u00c1balos & Herreros, began to perform as two different platforms differentiating projects signed by Juan Herreros of those under the authorship of \u00c1balos. Herreros presented two projects at that time as the beginning of a new stage: A house on the island of Mallorca and architectural design of the art fair ARCO in Madrid; in which he applied urban criteria for space allocation and management of program uses. In 2008 he founded the Herreros Arquitectos after the break with I\u00f1aki Abalos until 2014 where he accomplished the rebuilding of their practice under the name estudio Herreros, from which plays a triple role: practitioner, teacher and researcher. His theoretical work currently focuses on his work and seminars on \"Emerging Practices in Architecture\" which takes its name from the Research Group directed at the Polytechnic University of Madrid based on the idea of recycling the figure of the architect and his techniques in light of new economic coordinates and the crisis of traditional modes of production which hinder the incorporation of new generations to the practice of architecture techniques.
