In contrast of the songs presented, he sang a brega bolero using colorful clothing, which would become his trade mark. Although he was rejected by critics, public applauded him. At the Christmas night, he did his first solo show. After some public request, he recorded his first album, Bonito, Lindo e Joiado, which contained his first major hit, \"I'm Not Dog No.\" The song, and adaptation of Sorriano's hit \"Eu N\u00e3o Sou Cachorro N\u00e3o\", was done in response to the high numbers of English-language music in the Brazilian radios. The independent album was taken by Beto Barbosa to the record label Continental, which re-released it in 1991. He was signed by BMG in 1994 after Raimundo Fagner showed them a Compact Cassette of Falc\u00e3o's songs. Fagner and Robertinho de Recife then produced his second album, O Dinheiro n\u00e3o \u00c9 Tudo, mas \u00c9 100%. On this work, he was advised to try again to adapta a successful brega song, and then he wrote \"Black People Car\" based on Almir Rog\u00e9rio's \"Fusc\u00e3o Preto.\" His following work, A Besteira \u00c9 a Base da Sabedoria (1995), which sold over 240,000 copies, became the best-selling album of his career. He recorded another two albums, A Um Passo da MPB (1996) and Quanto Pior, Melhor (1998), for BMG. In 1998, he starred his own show as the presenter of Falc\u00e3o na Contram\u00e3o on Rede Bandeirantes. Under the Abril Music label he released 500 Anos de Chifre, with songs about cuckolds.
