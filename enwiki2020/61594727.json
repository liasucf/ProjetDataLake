In February 2019, the Bangsamoro Transition Authority launched a design competition for a new flag for Bangsamoro, along with competitions for a new hymn and seal of the region. The Bangsamoro Cabinet selected among the submissions a design for the flag. Equal representation of Bangsamoro's ethnic groups and tribes were a priority in flag adoption process. The Bangsamoro Parliament passed Parliament Bill No. 7 which is also known as \"An Act Adopting an Official Flag of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao\". The measure was passed on its third and final reading on August 22, 2019 and was signed into law on August 28, 2019 by Chief Minister Murad Ebrahim as Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 1. On the same day, the flag was officially hoisted in front of the BARMM Executive Building. Provisionally, the flag of the former Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao had been used to represent the region prior to the adoption of the current flag. ==Design== The approved design for the Bangsamoro regional flag as per Bangsamoro Autonomy Act No. 1 is a green, white, and red horizontal tricolor of equal height with a golden yellow crescent and seven-pointed star as well as a white kris. The flag's standard dimensions is at , or with an aspect ratio of 6:11. The flag's four colors are defined by law according to their HEX values. The greens symbolizes the majority Muslim population of the region, white represents purity, and red represents the Bangsamoro struggle. The crescent represents the \"principles which guided the Bangsamoro who struggled for self- determination\" and the seven points of the star represents the component local governments of the region; the provinces of Basilan, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu and Tawi Tawi, Cotabato City and the 63 barangays in Cotabato which are part of Bangsamoro. The golden yellow of both elements situated in the center of the flag's white section signifies \"bright future\" for the region. The kris is to be displayed in the center of the bottom red portion of the flag. The width of the sword is 60 percent of the flag's width. It signifies the region's protection and resistance against \"tyranny, oppression, and injustice\". {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align:center;\" |- !rowspan=2|Scheme !width=20%|Green !width=20%|White !width=20%|Red !width=20%|Yellow |- |style=\"background:#009966\"| |style=\"background:#FFFFFF\"| |style=\"background:#FF3333\"| |style=\"background:#FFD700\"| |- | HEX|| #009966 || #FFFFFF || #FF3333 || #FFD700 |- | RGB || 0-153-102 || 255-255-255 || 255-51-51 || 255-15-0 |- | CMYK || C100-M0-Y33-K40 || C0-M0-Y0-K0|| C0-M80-Y80-K0 || C0-M16-Y100-K0 |- |} ==Usage== Under the Bangsamoro Organic Law, the Bangsamoro regional flag should be displayed alongside the Philippine national flag.
