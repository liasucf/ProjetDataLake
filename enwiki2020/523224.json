The community was established in 1820 at the intersection of the Dixie Highway (later U.S. Route 25). Blue Ball was annexed by nearby Middletown in 1994. Blue Ball was so named because that image appeared on its tavern's signboard for the benefit of the illiterate. ==References== Category:Middletown, Ohio Category:Geography of Butler County, Ohio Category:Geography of Warren County, Ohio Category:Neighborhoods in Ohio Category:1820 establishments in Ohio Category:Populated places established in 1820 ",
