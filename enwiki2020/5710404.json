    "text": "Meteghan is an Acadian fishing community along the shores of Baie Sainte-Marie in Clare municipality, Digby County, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is 25 miles northeast of Yarmouth. Meteghan, which draws its name from the Mi'kmaq term \"Mitihikan\" meaning blue rocks, was founded in 1785 by Prudent Robichaud, Joseph LeBlanc, and other Acadian families. It is home to Smuggler's Cove Provincial Park. Meteghan is the largest of several communities that make up the Clare Municipal District. This community is also the French Shore's busiest port with draggers, trawlers, seiners, cod, crab and lobster boats docking there. The fishing industry has long been the main source of income in Meteghan. Clare's shipbuilding industry began in Meteghan in 1890 with the construction of the first dry dock built in conjunction with a shipyard. Notable vessels include the Royal Canadian Navy training schooner HMCS Venture, built in 1937. The largest remaining shipyard is the A.F. Theriault & Sons Shipyard in nearby Meteghan River. ==External links== *Municipality of Clare *Baie Sainte-Marie, Nova Scotia's French Acadian Shore Meteghan fishing fleet Category:General Service Areas in Nova Scotia Category:Communities in Digby County, Nova Scotia ",
