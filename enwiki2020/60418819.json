According to Albanian sources he was a Catholic Albanian from the tribe of Kelmendi while Parry believes he was a Muslim Albanian from Shkod\u00ebr. Up to the age of 30, he sang only in Albanian but began singing in Serbo-Croatian after he married a Bosnian woman. Ugljani was able to sing in both languages for hours making him a popular lahutar. In 1934 he sang the \"Song of Baghdad\" in Novi Pazar and it is believed that this song was taught to him by another bard. == References == === Citations === === Bibliography === * * * * Category:1849 births Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1945 deaths Category:People from Sjenica Category:Date of birth missing Category:Date of death missing Category:Albanian musicians Category:20th-century Albanian singers ",
