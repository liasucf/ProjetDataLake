    "text": "The Ferozepore Brigade was an infantry brigade of the British Indian Army that formed part of the Indian Army during the First World War. It was formed in December 1914 as part of the 3rd Lahore Divisional Area for service on the North West Frontier and renamed as 44th (Ferozepore) Brigade in August 1915. It remained in India throughout the First World War but saw active service in the Third Anglo-Afghan War with the 16th Indian Division. Post-war, the brigade underwent a number of changes in designation before settling on Ferozepore Brigade Area by the outbreak of the Second World War. It was broken up in February 1942. ==History== At the outbreak of the First World War, the Ferozepore Brigade was part of the 3rd (Lahore) Division. It was mobilized in August 1914 with the division as the 7th (Ferozepore) Brigade and sailed from Bombay and Karachi between 24 and 29 September for the Western Front. The 3rd Lahore Divisional Area was formed in September 1914 to take over the area responsibilities of the 3rd (Lahore) Division and in December 1914 a new Ferozepore Brigade was formed in 3rd Lahore Divisional Area to replace the original brigade. In August 1915 it was designated as 44th (Ferozepore) Brigade. From March 1916, it was intended to form a reserve division for the North West Frontier, but the urgent need to find troops for Mesopotamia meant that the 16th Indian Division was not formed until December 1916. In February 1917 the brigade was transferred to the new division. The brigade remained on the North West Frontier throughout the First World War but was mobilized with 16th Indian Division to take part in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. In September 1920, the brigade was redesignated as 12th Indian Infantry Brigade and as 16th Indian Infantry Brigade from October 1921not to be confused with an identically designated but unrelated 12th and 16th Indian Infantry Brigades of the Second World War. In 1923, the brigade was once again renamed Ferozepore Brigade. By the outbreak of the Second World War it was designated as Ferozepore Brigade Area and it was broken up in February 1942. ==Orders of battle== {| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:transparent;\" !With 3rd Lahore Divisional Area |- |The brigade commanded the following units while serving with the 3rd Lahore Divisional Area: * 2nd Battalion, 4th Gurkha Rifles (arrived in September 1914 from 8th (Jullundur) Brigade, 3rd (Lahore) Division; transferred to Kohat Brigade in November) * 1/4th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment (arrived in December 1914 with 43rd (Wessex) Division; left for Mesopotamia, arriving at Basra on 2 March 1916 and joined 42nd Indian Brigade, 15th Indian Division) * 2/4th Battalion, Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (arrived in March 1916 from Multan; transferred in February 1917 to Bareilly Brigade, 7th Meerut Divisional Area) * 1st Battalion, 4th Gurkha Rifles (joined in March 1916 from Egypt; transferred in April 1917 to Derajat Brigade) * 3rd Battalion, 5th Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force) (formed on 28 November 1916 as 2nd Reserve Gurkha Battalion, redesignated on 29 May 1917; transferred in April 1917 to 4th (Rawalpindi) Brigade, 2nd (Rawalpindi) Division) * 2nd Battalion, 1st King George's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment) (joined in December 1916 from Jullundur and returned in April 1917) * 1/1st Kent Cyclist Battalion (arrived in January 1917 from Southern Brigade, 9th (Secunderabad) Division; detached to Bannu Brigade from April to July 1917) * 2/6th Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment (arrived in January 1917 from Southern Brigade, 9th (Secunderabad) Division; transferred in May to 45th (Jullundur) Brigade) |} {| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:transparent;\" !With 16th Indian Division |- |The brigade commanded the following units while serving with the 16th Indian Division: * 98th Infantry (joined in February 1917 from East Africa; transferred in July to 2nd Quetta Brigade) * 1/9th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment (joined in June 1917 from 43rd Indian Brigade; transferred in February 1918 to Ambala Brigade) * 2nd Battalion, 89th Punjabis (formed in June 1917; transferred in October to Dargai, 1st (Peshawar) Division) * 1/1st Kent Cyclist Battalion (rejoined in July 1917 from detachment to Bannu Brigade) * 1st Battalion, 4th Gurkha Rifles (joined in September 1917 from 43rd Indian Brigade; transferred in November to Kohat Brigade) * 71st Punjabis (joined in December 1917 from Montgomery; transferred in May 1918 to Bushire) * 2nd Battalion, 1st King George's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment) (joined in December 1917 from 45th (Jullundur) Brigade; transferred in January 1918 to 2nd (Nowshera) Brigade, 1st (Peshawar) Division) * 1st Battalion, Kashmir Infantry (I.S.)
