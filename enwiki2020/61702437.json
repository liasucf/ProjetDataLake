    "text": "Kerbal Space Program 2 is an upcoming space flight simulation video game developed by Intercept Games and published by Private Division. It is the sequel to 2015's Kerbal Space Program and is scheduled for a release in Q3 2021 for Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One. ==Gameplay== The sequel will build on the sandbox features of Kerbal Space Program, while at the same time introducing new propulsion methods (e.g. the Orion drive), habitation modules for building on-surface, orbital and planetary colonies, a multiplayer mode, as well as interstellar travel. ==Development== Kerbal Space Program 2 was announced at Gamescom 2019 on August 19, with an initial release date set for early 2020. The game was in development by Star Theory Games, formerly Uber Entertainment, which changed its name in order to display a stronger association with the Kerbal Space Program franchise. Development was shifted to Star Theory in part so that Squad could focus on developing further updates for the original game. To ensure that the experience felt \"grounded\", the team consulted a panel of scientists and experts including Dr. Uri Shumlak, the associate chair of the University of Washington's Aeronautics and Astronautics department, and Dr Joel Green, who is an astrophysicist. The game also received feedback that the original game was too overwhelming for new players. Therefore, the team aimed to make the game more accessible by introducing more tutorials in order to give more guidance to players to ensure they understand the game's various gameplay systems. However for various reasons, the release date was pushed back to Q3 2021. Take-Two established a new unnamed studio under Private Division to continue development of Kerbal Space Program 2, with some of Star Theory's employees brought into it, leaving it unclear what Star Theory's role remains on the title. Later reporting by Bloomberg revealed that Take-Two was in talks to acquire Star Theory but abruptly changed course, set up a new studio to develop the game (Intercept Games), and then poached a third of Star Theory's developers including the creative director and the lead producer. Star Theory closed its doors three months later. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Open world video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Single-player video games Category:Space flight simulator games Category:Private Division games Category:Upcoming video games scheduled for 2021 Category:Video games about extraterrestrial life Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set on fictional planets Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Video games postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Video game sequels ",
