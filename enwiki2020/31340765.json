    "text": "The N\u00fcrtingen\u2013Neuffen railway, also known as the T\u00e4lesbahn (\"Valley's Railway\"), is a branch line in the Stuttgart region of the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. It is single-track and standard gauge, and is long. It links Neuffen with N\u00fcrtingen, where it connects to the Plochingen\u2013T\u00fcbingen railway from Stuttgart to T\u00fcbingen. The line was also opened for freight on 1 June 1900 and for passenger transport on 21 June 1900. It overcomes a height difference of 111 metres. The T\u00e4lesbahn is owned and operated by the W\u00fcrttembergische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (WEG), a member of the Veolia Transport group. The line is the oldest surviving operation of the WEG. The WEG operated limestone trains between a quarry near Neuffen and a cement works in N\u00fcrtingen until 1979. The trains were hauled by purpose-built railbuses of Class WEG T 23 and 24. Passenger services on the T\u00e4lesbahn use a fleet of 4 Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1 units with a partial low floor. The typical service pattern consists of either one or two trains an hour, depending on the day and time of day, with each train taking 12 minutes for its journey. Except from regular historical train rides there was until 24 March 2013 no service on Sundays. Since then there is a test running with one train per hour between 10:00 and 20:00. == Inspiration for Model Railways == The Neuffen Station is reproduced as a 1:87 scale (H0) Model Railway plastic kit model by the Vollmer company http://www.vollmer-online.de/de/artikel/art_3510.html. The same company produces other scale versions of the Neuffen Station. == Gallery == File:WEG-RS1.jpg|RegioShuttle on the T\u00e4lesbahn == References == Category:Railway lines in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Category:Railway lines opened in 1900 Category:1900 establishments in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Esslingen (district) ",
