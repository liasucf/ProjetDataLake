    "text": "The SC 50 (Sprengbombe Cylindrisch) or cylindrical explosive bomb in English was a family of general-purpose bombs used by the Luftwaffe during World War II. == Design == The SC50 bomb has eight variants and multiple ways they were manufactured from one-piece drawn steel bodies to separate steel pieces welded together and their total weight was to . It was filled through the base with either Amatol, TNT or Trialen 105, a mixture of 15% RDX, 70% TNT and 15% aluminum powder. The SC 50 could be fitted with either an anti-ricochet adapter for anti-ship use or a Stabo Spike that kept the bomb upright and exploded the bomb before it buried itself for anti-personnel use. It could be vertically or horizontally suspended in a bomb bay or horizontally mounted on a wing or fuselage hardpoint. ==Variants== ===Standard=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-right: auto; margin-right: 0px;\" !colspan = \"4\"|Data for SC 50 Bi bomb |- !colspan = \"1\"| !colspan = \"1\"| Metric |- | Overall Length | |- | Body Length | |- | Body Diameter | |- | Tail Width | |- | Filling Weight | |- | Total Weight | |- | Charge/Weight Ratio | 45.75% |- ! colspan = \"3\"| |- | Explosive Filling | colspan=\"2;\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Cast TNT, Amatol or Trialen |- | Bomb Type | colspan=\"2;\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | High Explosive |- |} * (SC 50 Bi) Single piece cast steel body which is machined down. All fittings are welded into place. A single transverse fuze pocket is located slightly forward of the horizontal lug. The fuze pocket is secured to the opposite wall with a single weld. The fuze pocket will accommodate two picric pellets along with a normal sized electric fuze. The nose has threading which will accommodate an eye-bolt utilized for vertical suspension. A shock plate (similar to a kopfring) may be welded to the bomb nose in an attempt to prevent ricochet when utilized against targets located in the water. ===Grade I=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-right: auto; margin-right: 0px;\" !colspan = \"4\"|Data for SC 50 Ja, L, Stabo bomb |- !colspan = \"1\"| !colspan = \"1\"| Metric |- | Overall Length | Ja and L , Stabo |- | Body Length | |- | Body Diameter | |- | Tail Width | |- | Tail Length | |- | Filling Weight | to |- | Total Weight | to |- | Charge/Weight Ratio | 46% |- ! colspan = \"3\"| |- | Explosive Filling | colspan=\"2;\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | TNT, powdered Amatol or cast Trialen |- | Bomb Type | colspan=\"2;\" style=\"text- align:center;\" | High Explosive |- |} * (SC 50 Ja) The Ja variant is made from a one-piece drawn steel body. * (SC 50 L) The L variant is the same as the Ja variant with the exception that its body is made from seamless tubular steel. * (SC 50 Stabo) The Stabo variant is also like the Ja variant with the exception that it has a threaded lug forged to the nose of the bomb allowing for an steel spike which is in diameter to be secured to the lug which allows the bomb to detonate before burrowing into the ground, typically at a height of a person. ===Grade II=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-right: auto; margin-right: 0px;\" !colspan = \"4\"|Data for SC 50 J, JB, JC, J/1 bomb |- !colspan = \"1\"| !colspan = \"1\"| Metric |- | Overall Length | |- | Body Length | |- | Body Diameter | |- | Tail Width | |- | Tail Length | |- | Filling Weight | to |- | Total Weight | to |- | Charge/Weight Ratio | 46% |- ! colspan = \"3\"| |- | Explosive Filling | colspan=\"2;\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | TNT, powdered Amatol or cast Trialen |- | Bomb Type | colspan=\"2;\" style=\"text- align:center;\" | High Explosive |- |} * (SC 50 J) The J was made as a one- piece nose and body with the base welded to the body. * (SC 50 JB) The JB variant is the later model of the J variant, with identical construction. * (SC 50 JC) The JC variant was composed of two pieces, nose and body. The nose was made of pressed steel and the body was made of drawn steel. The nose and base plate were welded to the body of the bomb body. * (SC 50 J/2) The J/2 variant was similar to the JC variant with the exception of the quality of steel used for manufacturing. This variant was only produced in limited quantities. ==2015 Wembley bomb== In May 2015 an SC 50 was unearthed at a building site on Empire Way in Wembley, London. The bomb was dropped during The Blitz on London by the Luftwaffe in 1940. Bomb disposal experts from 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal in the Royal Logistics Corps attempted to defuse it, however, the disarming was unsuccessful and the bomb was later removed and safely detonated at a secret location. ==Popular culture== In the Dad's Army episode \"Something Nasty in the Vault\", an unexploded SC 50 traps Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson in the bank vault. == Photo gallery == File:Sc50ja.jpg|Sc 50Ja File:Sc50jb.jpg|Sc 50JB File:Antiricochet Plates.jpg|Anti-ricochet rings.
