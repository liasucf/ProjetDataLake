His father was semi-illiterate and worked as a fruit vendor in a market of S\u00e3o Paulo, but he was able to enroll his only child in college.Serra agarra a sua chancehttp://revistaepoca.globo.com/Epoca/0,6993,EPT419866-2011,00.html In the early 1960s, he was a prominent member of the socio-political movement A\u00e7\u00e3o Popular which opposed the conservative political system that existed at the time.See http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/jose- serra/4f8897b2a076935111000191.html Serra interrupted his studies in engineering at age 22 and left the country in 1964, after the coup that established the military government in Brazil. Serra came to the attention of the authorities having served as President of the Uni\u00e3o Nacional dos Estudantes (UNE), (National Student Union) which opposed the existing conservative regime while he was a 4th year engineering student at the Polytechnic School at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Jos\u00e9 Serra was in exile from 1964 to 1978 in Bolivia, France, Chile, and the United States.

On returning to Brazil after the political amnesty in 1978, Serra lectured in economics at the University of Campinas, did research for Cebrap, and wrote for the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. ==Political career== In 1982 he was appointed S\u00e3o Paulo's State Secretary for Economics and Planning under Franco Montoro's governorship, and became an influential secretary of Montoro's government. In 1986 and 1990 he was elected and then reelected to Congress. In 1994 he was elected Senator for the State of S\u00e3o Paulo with more than 6.5 million votes.

He ran again in 1996, resigning as Minister of Planning to participate in the election for mayor, which was won by Celso Pitta.

PSDB was seen as a coalition of democrats, liberals and social democrats with more centrist outlook than the leftist Workers' Party (PT) of presidents Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff. Both parties have great support in S\u00e3o Paulo state, but the state has been governed by the PSDB since 1994.
