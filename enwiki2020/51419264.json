Writing in The Guardian, Wendy Ide praised Clarke's direction and performance, but \"Clarke goes and spoils it all by using naked women as set dressing and cramming the frame with flash gangster cliches, which rather undermines the anti-aspirational message of the film.\" Terri White of Empire praised Clarke's uncompromising portrayal of inner city life, but criticized Maza's performance and that, \"Clarke can\u2019t avoid employing the third-in-a-trilogy tropes: one last job/reformed guy helps new guy who is essentially him/grossly unfair family tragedy as his three-parter reaches its too-neat conclusion.\" == See also == * List of hood films ==References== ==External links== * * Brotherhood at Rotten Tomatoes Category:2016 films Category:2016 drama films Category:2016 crime drama films Category:British films Category:British independent films Category:British crime drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Noel Clarke Category:Hood films Category:Films about drugs Category:British gangster films Category:Films set in London Category:Films shot in London Category:Films set in 2018 Category:Films about interracial romance Category:2010s business films Category:2010s gang films Category:Films with screenplays by Noel Clarke Category:2016 independent films ",
