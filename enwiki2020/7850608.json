    "text": "The Devil Makes Three is an Americana band from Santa Cruz, California, United States. The group blends bluegrass, old time, country, folk, blues, jazz, and ragtime music. The group's members are guitarist Pete Bernhard, upright bassist Lucia Turino, and guitarist and tenor banjo player Cooper McBean. ==Career== The band has released six full-length albums. They independently released a self-titled album in 2002. Another independent release followed in 2004, Longjohns, Boots, And A Belt. The band recorded two shows in April 2006 in Felton, California with guest fiddler Chojo Jacques. The recordings were later released as a live album, A Little Bit Faster And A Little Bit Worse. After the release of their live album, the band signed with independent label Milan Records, which specializes in film scores and soundtracks. Their first album on Milan was a re-release of their debut album, The Devil Makes Three. In 2009, they followed with an all-new album, Do Wrong Right. Band member Bernhard independently released a solo album, Things I Left Behind (2006). In September 2009 Bernhard released his next solo album, Straight Line, on Milan Records. McBean and Bernhard are originally from near Brattleboro, Vermont, where they played music together as childhood friends and when they were in high school. They were also acquainted with Turino (from New Hampshire but raised in Vermont), but didn't know her well. After graduating from high school, all three moved to California separately, Bernhard by way of Nashville. Bernhard and McBean re-connected in Olympia. Later in Santa Cruz they also became reacquainted with Turino, forming the band soon after in 2001. Before forming The Devil Makes Three with Turino, both Bernhard and McBean played in punk bands, and later toured as a duo. Around 2010, Bernhard and Turino moved back to Brattleboro while McBean remained in California, McBean later moved to Austin. Despite no longer living in the same town the band continues to tour and write. In August 2010, the band performed at Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival. The band has also performed several times at the annual Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival. On June 4, 2018 the band announced their new studio album \"Chains Are Broken\", which was produced by Ted Hutt and was released on August 24, 2018 via New West Records. Along with the album announcement, the band also released an album track entitled \u2018Paint My Face\u2019 as a streaming single, and on July 13, 2018 they released another album track entitled \u2018Bad Idea\u2019. ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details ! colspan=\"5\"| Peak chart positions |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! width=\"45\"| US Grass ! width=\"45\"| US ! width=\"45\"| US Heat ! width=\"45\"| US Indie ! width=\"45\"| US Folk |- ! scope=\"row\"| The Devil Makes Three | * Release date: 2002 * Label: Monkeywrench | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Longjohns, Boots and a Belt | * Release date: November 18, 2003 * Label: The Devil Makes Three | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| A Little Bit Faster and a Little Bit Worse (Live recording) | * Release date: November 17, 2006 * Label: The Devil Makes Three | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| The Devil Makes Three (re-release) | * Release date: November 20, 2007 * Label: Milan | 7 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Do Wrong Right | * Release date: April 21, 2009 * Label: Milan | 1 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Stomp and Smash (Live recording) | * Release date: October 24, 2011 * Label: Milan | 4 | \u2014 | 29 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| I'm a Stranger Here | * Release date: October 29, 2014 * Label: New West Records | 2 | 124 | 2 | 22 | 9 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Redemption & Ruin | * Release date: September 16, 2016 * Label: New West Records | 1 | 144 | 2 | \u2014 | 8 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Chains Are Broken | * Release date: August 24, 2018 * Label: New West Records | | | | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Live at Red Rocks | * Release date: April 20, 2019 * Label: Khan Records | | | | | |- | colspan=\"7\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart |- |} ===Music videos=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
