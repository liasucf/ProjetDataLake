    "text": "The Lakeview Resettlement Project Historic District encompasses a significant portion of a Depression-era agricultural resettlement project of the United States federal government in and around Lake View, Arkansas. Covering nearly on either side of Arkansas Highway 84 north of Old Town Lake, the area was developed in the 1930s by the Resettlement Administration as a rural community specifically developed for African-Americans. Roads and houses were built through the area, and a successful farming community eventually arose. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Phillips County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Queen Anne architecture in Arkansas Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures in Phillips County, Arkansas Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Phillips County, Arkansas ",
