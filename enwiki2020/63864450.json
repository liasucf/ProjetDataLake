As tradition and a standalone single, \"You Got Me, Part II\" was released on April 20, 2020 in celebration of her debut album M\u00fda (1998). ==Background and release== \"You Got Me, Part II\" was first announced as a single during a brief interview with Fox 5 Washington D.C.s anchorman Wisdom Martin. Beginning on April 13, 2020, \"You Got Me, Part II\" was made available for pre-order. A week later, \"You Got Me, Part II\" was officially released April 20, 2020 on all digital platforms. ==Artwork== Taking to Instagram, M\u00fda uploaded the single's official artwork. M\u00fda is seen wearing a buttoned-up black blazer, opting to go shirtless underneath the garment. On display is her decolletage area, which is accessorized with a thick necklace. The ensemble is paired with high-waisted skintight pants with a white strip going down to the side and black heels with white spots all over. To complete the look, M\u00fda wore a red hat with her hair sported in a bun while black lipstick and nail polish was applied. ==Composition== Constructed around throwback 90's R&B;, \"You Got Me, Part II\" is a sensual, hypnotic midtempo production with a runtime of four minutes and twenty-eight seconds. Written by M\u00fda with production courtesy of Bink! and additional live instrumentation provided by producer Chucky Thompson, \"You Got Me, Part II\" is a conceptual continuation of its original version performed in the key of B major with a common time of 127 beats per minute. Lyrically, the song chronicles the protagonist's realization that she has unexpected feelings for someone she had no intention of falling for. \"You got me boy/Yeah you got me/I thought I was stronger than this/ You had at me hello/ I ain't use to this\" M\u00fda sings with conviction on the song's chorus.
