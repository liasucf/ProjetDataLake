She was wrecked in 1805. ==Origins== Vice-Admiral Khanykov reported to St Petersburg, in a dispatch discussed there on 1796, that he had purchased Dispatch at the behest of Catherine the Great, and that she was being fitted out and would be handed over to Russia.Materialy, Vol. 14, p.553. Dispatch was transferred to Russia under an Admiralty Order dated 28 January 1796. She apparently was at Chatham on , in company with two Russian ships of the line, suggesting that she was already under the Russian flag.Materialy, Vol. 14, p.538.

Between 1796 and 1797, Dispatch served with the squadrons of Vice-Admiral Pyotr Khanykov and Vice-Admiral Mikhail Makarov, cruising between Copenhagen and England. In May 1797 she sailed with Makarov's First Division from Kronstadt, arriving in Britain in July. Between 1798 and 1800 Makarov's Division operated in the North Sea and off the Texel. Initially, she served primarily as an advice boat, carrying messages between flagships. Later, she patrolled in the North Sea.Materialy, Vol. 17, p.291. On 1800 she left for Russia.Materialy, Vol. 17, p.542. Then in 1801, Dispatch carried a courier to Britain.
