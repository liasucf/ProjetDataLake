    "text": "Since the 1968 Summer Olympics did not feature tennis as an official sport, two unofficial tournaments were held during the Games: a Demonstration tournament and an Exhibition tournament. The Exhibition tournament was played from 24 to 26 October 1968 on the clay courts of the Chapultepec Sports Center in Mexico City, Mexico. All matches were played at best-of-three sets; since the tiebreak rule wasn't implemented until the 1970s, a team had to win a set by a two-game margin in case of a 6\u20136 draw. Due to the short length of the tournament, no third place match was played, and both semifinal losers received bronze medals. French Rosa Mar\u00eda Darmon and American Julie Heldman won the tournament by defeating also Americans Peaches Bartkowicz and Valerie Ziegenfuss 6\u20130, 10\u20138 in the final. Ecuatorian Mar\u00eda Eugenia Guzm\u00e1n and Brazilian Suzana Petersen, alongside Mexican Cecilia Rosado and Soviet Zaiga Jansone, have all won bronze medals. Due to the short draw, 4 out of 5 pairs have won medals, giving the tournament an unusual 80% of chances of winning a medal. ==Seeds== Both seeds received a bye into the semifinals. ==Draw== ==References== ==External links== * Official Results Archive (WTA) 1968 Exhibition Category:Women's events at the 1968 Summer Olympics Olym ",
