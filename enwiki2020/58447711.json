    "text": "Alexis-Andr\u00e9 Roger (11 June 1814 \u2013 1846) was a French composer. Born in Ch\u00e2teau-Gontier, in 1828 Roger was admitted to study at the Conservatoire de Paris. He studied harmony with Victor Dourlen, counterpoint with Anton Reicha, piano with Pierre Zimmermann and organ with Fran\u00e7ois Benoist. His composition teachers were Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lesueur and Ferdinando Pa\u00ebr. After a commendatory mention in 1838, he won the Premier Grand Prix in 1842 with the cantata La Reine flore in the competition for the Prix de Rome. At the beginning of 1843 he began his two-year stay at the Villa Medici in Rome, which was associated with the prize. This was followed by a trip to Vienna and to Germany, where he died in 1846 at the age of thirty-two. Only one violin textbook (Grande m\u00e9thode de violon) which was published in Paris in 1830, has survived of his works. == External links == Category:1814 births Category:1846 deaths Category:People from Ch\u00e2teau-Gontier Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:French Romantic composers Category:19th-century French composers Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:Prix de Rome for composition Category:19th-century male musicians ",
