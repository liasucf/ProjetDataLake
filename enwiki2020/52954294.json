It is one of the landmarks on Independence Avenue. The Supreme Soviet of Belarus and Minsk City Hall are on this square. During the period of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic it was called Lenin Square. It is currently one of the biggest squares in Europe. == History == left The square was designed by Iosif Langbard and was created for conducting rallies and to serve as Minsk's main ceremonial venue during the Soviet times. During World War II most buildings that were on the square were destroyed by the Nazis. From 1946 to 1984 October Square replaced Lenin Square as the city's main venue. A project for the reconstruction of Independence Square was launched after the fall of the USSR. The first stage was completed in 2002. The transportation scheme of the area was then changed. Two more pedestrian underpasses were constructed and in the future they are to make part of the Underground Trade Centre. Several parking lots are to be built adjacent to the square. An underground shopping mall is also being constructed near the square. == Events == ===Parades=== In the Soviet era, military parades in honor of International Workers' Day (1 May) (until 1969), Victory Day (9 May), and October Revolution Day (7 November) took place on the square since it was used as the city's general parade venue until 1984. The First Secretary of the Communist Party of Belarus and members of the politburo would get on top of a grandstand in front of a statue of Lenin. These types of parades would go on until 1989. The first parade of the independent Republic of Belarus was on Independence Square in 1995, in honor of golden jubilee of the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender. ===Demonstrations=== In the Soviet era, many pro-Communist rallies took place. A rally took place in honor of the 100th birthday of Vladimir Lenin took place on the square on 22 April 1970. Rallies in honor of Minsk's 900th anniversary also took place in 1967. ====2020 protests==== During the 2020 Belarusian protests, the square was an area where many rallies occurred.
