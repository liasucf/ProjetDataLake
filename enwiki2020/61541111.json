    "text": "The Battle of Nisibis was fought between Byzantine forces under Belisarius and Peter and a Sassanian garrison under Nabedes. It took place while the Sassanian king Khosrow I was invading Lazica. It was part of a Byzantine offensive led by Belisarius into Persian land. When Belisarius arrived in the area he stationed his troops a significant distance away from the city. He hoped to drag the Sasanian garrison into a battle far from the city walls, and after defeating them, capture the undefended city, which was seemed impregnable otherwise. A Byzantine commander named Peter disagreed and moved his forces, together with those of John Troglita who was associated with him, closers to the city. Belisarius warned Peter that because the Byzantines didn\u2019t normally eat until midday the garrison would sally out then so the Byzantines would have to fight while hungry. Peter ignored this and at midday his man dispersed to eat. When the Sassanians sallied out his disorganised unit was routed losing 50 men and Peter's standard. He immediately called on Belisarius for help. When the message reached Belisarius he had already seen the dust clouds produced by the Sassanian sally and was well on his way. Despite the garrison being overwhelmed by the Byzantine army they suffered only 150 casualties as they quickly retreated to the city, exactly what Belisarius had sought to avoid. == Aftermath == Recognising Nobades wouldn\u2019t leave the city again out of fear for another such engagement Belisarius could now bypass the city as its garrison wouldn\u2019t attack him in the rear. After an assault of Sisauranon failed he sent troops to raid rich normally safe Persian territory across the Tigris. After procuring much wealth from the area the Byzantine raiding forces split up and went home as some were afraid Belisarius would take their loot. Belisarius wanted to return home too as to avoid being surprised by the arrival of Persian forces under Khosrow. Procopius later claimed this because of Belisarius wanting to confront his wife Antonina, who\u2019s lover his troops had imprisoned, as soon as possible about her affair. Claiming that Belisarius could have reached Ctesiphon as the path remained undefended. This argument is flawed however as the same information of the disposition of Persian troops had not been available to Belisarius at that time. ==References== Nisibis 541 Nisibis 541 Category:541 Category:540s conflicts Category:540s in the Byzantine Empire Nisibis 541 Category:6th century in Iran Category:Nusaybin ",
