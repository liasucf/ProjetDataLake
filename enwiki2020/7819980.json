It borders South P'y\u014fngan province to the south, and the East Korea Bay to the east. ==Physical features== The highest point is Noranbong. Most of the county's land is mountainous, but the southeast region is flat. The chief river is the Kumjin River. In the winter, its climate is continental and the weather is bitterly cold; however, the influence of the Rangrim Mountains makes Ch\u014fngp'y\u014fng's climate milder than that of the Yellow Sea coast. ==Administrative divisions== Ch\u014fngp'yong county is divided into 1 \u016dp (town), 2 rodongjagu (workers' districts) and 42 ri (villages): {| |- | valign=\"top\" | * Ch\u014fngp'yong-\u016dp * Sinsang-rodongjagu * Yongh\u016dng-rodongjagu * Changch'\u014fl-li * Changdong-ri * Changh\u016dng-ri * Choyang-ri * Chungp'y\u014fng-ri * Ch'angsil-li * Ch'ow\u014fl-li * Hanam-ri * Hojung-ri * Honam-ri * Hwadong-ri * Hyangdong-ri * Kuch'ang-ri * Ku\u016dp-ri * Kuyang-ri * Kwangh\u016dng-ri * Kwanp'y\u014fng-ri * Munbong-ri * Munch'ang-ri | valign=\"top\" | * Munh\u016dng-ri * Naedong-ri * Namch'ang-ri * Pokh\u016dng-ri * Pongdae-ri * Pup'y\u014fng-ri * P'ungyang-ri * Ryuls\u014fng-ri * Samdo-ri * Sasu-ri * Sinch'\u014fl-li * Sinp'ung-ri * Sinp'y\u014fng-ri * Sins\u014fng-ri * S\u014fgy\u014fng-ri * S\u014fnd\u014fng-ri * Taho-ri * Toksal-li * Tongch'\u014fl-li * Tongha-ri * Tongho-ri * T'aeyang-ri |} ==Economy== ===Agriculture and fishery=== Rice is cultivated on the level ground of the southeast, where the soil is fertile.
