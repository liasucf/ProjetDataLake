    "text": "Emsworth railway station serves the small town of Emsworth, on the Hampshire side of the border between Hampshire and West Sussex, in southern England. It is located on the West Coastway Line which runs between Brighton and Southampton, from Brighton. == Services == The standard off-peak service consists of four trains per hour in each direction - one between Brighton and Southampton, one between Brighton and Portsmouth Harbour, one between Littlehampton and Portsmouth & Southsea and one between London Victoria and Southampton (via Horsham). This is a doubling of the number of trains in two years and reflects both the growing numbers of passengers already using the station, and the potential for new growth along the Coastway. Most trains do not stop at the nearest station, Warblington. ==References== == External links == Category:Railway stations in Hampshire Category:Former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1847 Category:Railway stations served by Southern Category:1847 establishments in England ",
