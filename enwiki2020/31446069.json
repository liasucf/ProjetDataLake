Eckmann is the son of mathematician Beno Eckmann.Profile for Jean-Pierre Eckmann on geni.com, retrieved 2011-04-30; Photo of Jean-Pierre Eckmann as a child with his parents, in the mathematical photo collection of the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach, retrieved 2011-04-30. He completed his PhD in 1970 under the supervision of Marcel Guenin at the University of Geneva. He has been a member of the Academia Europaea since 2001.Academy of Europe: Eckmann Jean-Pierre, retrieved 2011-04-29; . In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2012-11-10. He is also a member of the G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities. With Pierre Collet and Oscar Lanford, Eckmann was the first to find a rigorous mathematical argument for the universality of period- doubling bifurcations in dynamical systems, with scaling ratio given by the Feigenbaum constants.; . In a highly cited 1985 review paper with David Ruelle,. he bridged the contributions of mathematicians and physicists to dynamical systems theory and ergodic theory,Review of by Charles Tresser in Mathematical Reviews, . put the varied work on dimension-like notions in these fields on a firm mathematical footing,Review of by Boris Hasselblatt in Mathematical Reviews, . and formulated the Eckmann\u2013Ruelle conjecture on the dimension of hyperbolic ergodic measures, \"one of the main problems in the interface of dimension theory and dynamical systems\".. A proof of the conjecture was finally published 14 years later, in 1999.. Eckmann has done additional mathematical work in very diverse fields such as statistical mechanics, partial differential equations, and graph theory. His PhD students have included Viviane Baladi, Pierre Collet, and Martin Hairer. ==References== ==External links== *Website of Jean-Pierre Eckmann Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Mathematical physicists Category:University of Geneva alumni Category:University of Geneva faculty Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society ",
