    "text": "\"'Lump\" is a song by alternative rock band The Presidents of the United States of America. It was released in 1995 and featured on their self-titled debut album. The song reached number one on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1995. Composer Chris Ballew said that the lyrics combined his own history of having a benign tumor in the head with a vision he had of a woman in a swamp, while employing the word \"lump\" because Ballew was fond of it. The musical part was described by Ballew as him \"trying to write a Buzzcocks song\". Ballew considers it his favorite composition. Later in the same year, it debuted on the Album Rock Tracks chart, and went on to hit number seven. The song is featured in the video games Rock Band 2, the Nintendo DS version of Band Hero, Just Dance and Saints Row IV. It has additionally been covered or remade by several artists such as The Johnstones and \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. ==Description== The song gives the term \"lump\" to a woman that the singer imagines. In some bizarre imagery, the song describes a muddy, piranha-filled swamp and waiting in line for rotten brains. It briefly describes the woman's (romantic) life in her twenties and repeats the refrain that the woman is \"in my head\". ==Track listings== CD single # \"Lump\" \u2013 2:13 # \"Carolyn's Bootie\" \u2013 2:17 # \"Candy Cigarette\" \u2013 2:02 # \"Twig in the Wind\" (Australia only) \u2013 2:54 7\" single \u2013 UK # \"Lump\" \u2013 2:12 # \"Wake Up\" \u2013 2:37 ==Music videos== The music video for \"Lump\", directed by Roman Coppola, takes place in a \"boggy marsh\" (as the lyrics state). The video shows the band singing in a swamp as well as on the stern of a large barge in Elliott Bay interspersed with a silhouette scene of the band performing. Another video was also made for the song. This version, commonly referred to as \"Lump 2\", was considered too disturbing and dark to be aired on MTV (reflecting the band's grunge and post-grunge origins). It features the band performing on a dark stage while various people lip sync the lines \"She's lump!\" during the chorus. This version can be found on \"Ten Year Super Bonus Special Anniversary Edition\" of The Presidents of the United States of America's debut album, and on their YouTube channel (in low definition)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhMla8vMdP0 ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1995\u20131996) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |13 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1995) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|France (SNEP) |68 |} {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1996) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |86 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |38 |} ===Certifications=== ==Parodies and covers== * \"Weird Al\" Yankovic released a parody version of the song known as \"Gump\", a joking tribute to Forrest Gump. Notably, the last line of this parody, \"and that's all I have to say about that\" would later be used by The Presidents of the United States of America in their subsequent live performances of the song. ** Comedian Brian Posehn recorded a skit for his 2020 comedy metal album Grandpa Metal called \"My Phone Call with Weird Al\", featuring Yankovic, which references both \"Lump\" and \"Gump\", in which Posehn is trying to get Yankovic's permission to record a parody called \"Trump\" about president of the United States of America Donald Trump, and Yankovic unsuccessfully tries to inform Posehn that \"Gump\" is a parody of the Presidents of the United States of America song \"Lump\". * ApologetiX also recorded a parody entitled \"Plump\". * Canadian ska punk band The Johnstones covered \"Lump\" on their 2008 EP SEX. * The Blackout also covered \"Lump\" and it features on the end of the group's album, Hope, released in 2011. ==See also== *Number one modern rock hits of 1995 *List of RPM Rock/Alternative number-one singles (Canada) ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1995 singles Category:Billboard Alternative Songs number-one singles Category:The Presidents of the United States of America (band) songs Category:Music videos directed by Roman Coppola Category:Songs written by Chris Ballew Category:Buzzcocks ",
