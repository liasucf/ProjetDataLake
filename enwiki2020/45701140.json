    "text": "The Luynes aqueduct is a former Gallo-Roman bridge aqueduct located in Luynes, France.Luynes Aqueduct ==Description== The remains show a stack of five arches and it is the most famous Roman monument in the Department of Indre-et-Loire, despite its modest dimensions. It is also one of the best preserved of the Northern aqueducts. It was classified a historical monument in 1862 and is owned by the town of Luynes. It originally had a total length of , almost in a straight line, including of raised causeway. Its underground portion, and in particular its final journey, passes the hamlet of Villeronde.Michel Laurencin, \u00ab L'aqueduc gallo-romain de Luynes et l'antique Maillacum \u00bb, Revue arch\u00e9ologique du Centre, t. 6, 1967, p.197Jacques Dubois, Arch\u00e9ologie a\u00e9rienne : Patrimoine de Touraine, Alan Sutton, 2003, p91. Only a portion of the aqueduct-bridge is now visible as it passes through the \"Valley of the Arennes\".Knight, Jeremy, Roman France, (2001) , p.60 The actual channel for the water is masonry and not a lead or terracotta piping and has a slope of 1.5 cm to 2.9 m per kilometre. The maximum height of the arches of the aqueduct is 8.90 m. ==History== The remains of the aqueduct-bridge are located 1.5 km northeast of the centre of Luynes, in Indre-et-Loire. It has a general orientation of north-northeast to south-southwest, taking water from the now dry Pie Noire (or Pinnoire),Michel Provost, Carte arch\u00e9ologique de la Gaule - L'Indre-et-Loire, Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, 1988, p108-109. and is believed to have supplied water to ancient Luynes,Michel Laurencin, L'aqueduc gallo-romain de Luynes et l'antique Maillacum, Revue arch\u00e9ologique du Centre, vol6 1967], p. 195-204. or even Caesarodunum.Michel Provost, Carte arch\u00e9ologique de la Gaule - L'Indre-et-Loire, Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres,1988, p109. It has been conjectured, however, that the aqueduct was privately owned and serviced the complex of private villas at Sainte- Roselle.Jacques Dubois, Arch\u00e9ologie a\u00e9rienne : Patrimoine de Touraine, (Alan Sutton, 2003), p34.Jacques Dubois, Arch\u00e9ologie a\u00e9rienne en Touraine, Revue arch\u00e9ologique de Picardie, no sp\u00e9cial 17,1999, p.359-366. Its construction has not yet been dated with certainty; the construction style would indicate the 2nd or 3rd century, like the resort that it fed. It remained in use until the 12th or 13th century and has been the subject of several repair campaigns, especially at the beginning of the 10th century, under Charles the Simple,aqueduc-de-luynes. which is why it has survived so well, even if number of stones of its collapsed batteries had to be recovered and used. This suggests that its use has changed throughout this period, despite the abandonment of the seaside resort of Sainte-Roselle. ==Gallery== File:Aqueduc Luynes.jpg File:R\u00f6misches Aquaedukt bei Luynes, Frankreich.jpg == See also == *List of aqueducts in the Roman Empire *List of Roman aqueducts by date *Ancient Roman technology *Roman engineering ==References== Category:Aqueducts in France Category:Roman aqueducts outside Rome ",
