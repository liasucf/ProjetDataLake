After this transaction, a new airline was established on June 29, 1998. Guilford launched Pan American Airways with a fleet of seven Boeing 727-200s. This airline was nicknamed by some as \"Pan Am III\". The third incarnation began scheduled operations on October 7, 1999 and flew to nine cities in New England, Florida, the Canadian Maritimes and Puerto Rico. The focus was on secondary airports such as Orlando Sanford International Airport instead of Orlando International Airport, and Pease International Airport and Worcester Regional Airport instead of the crowded Logan International Airport in the Boston area. The new owners relocated the company headquarters from Fort Lauderdale to Portsmouth in December 1998. Pan American later had cooperative service arrangements with Boston-Maine Airways, a feeder subsidiary incorporated by the airline in March 1999. Pan American later established in 2003 a subsidiary PAWA Dominicana, operating under a joint venture with Boston-Maine Airways. Guilford ceased operating Pan American Airways on November 1, 2004, but the operations were transferred to Boston-Maine Airways, which resumed Boeing 727 service under the Pan Am Clipper Connection brand from February 17, 2005. In 2006, Guilford changed its name to Pan Am Systems, and changed the name of its railway divisions to Pan Am Railways. Boston-Maine operated the airline service until February 29, 2008.Pan Am stops flying.
