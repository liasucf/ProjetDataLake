    "text": "Nodipecten nodosus, or the lion's paw scallop, is a species of bivalve mollusc in the family Pectinidae. It can be found along the Atlantic coast of North America, ranging from Cape Hatteras to the West Indies, including Brazil and Bermuda.Abbott, R.T. & Morris, P.A. A Field Guide to Shells: Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and the West Indies. New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1995. 29. The lion's paw scallop is a species that consists of large scallop shells with ridges and bumps that have a rough texture. The shell is known for its distinct knobs on the ridges. Ranging from red to orange and also purple, the lion's paw scallop ranges in color. The shell\u2019s common name is derived from its appearance, the color, and the knobs giving it some visual similarities to the paw of a lion. As the largest scallop of the Western-Atlantic Ocean, the lion's paw has been commercially fished for human consumption for decades. Indeed, the recent decline of abalone fisheries along with an increase in the shell\u2019s value has led to aquaculture specific to the species. Their high growth rate makes them popular; however, not much is known about the requirements to improve farming. Due to their popularity in commercial fishing, the lion's paw scallops native to Brazil face the risk of extinction. Lion's paw scallops are known to be hermaphroditic, so they have both male and female gonads. In external fertilization, an organism will release both eggs and sperm. The lion's paw shell is valuable to collectors because of its size, vibrant colors, and extremely distinctive features. ==Distribution== Nodipecten nodosus are found in the tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean. They are found in deeper waters, ranging from 9 - 49m (30 \u2013 160 ft) deep. Its habitat ranges from the coast of North Carolina to the West Indies and from Brazil to Bermuda. Lion's paw scallops can also be found in the deeper sections of the Gulf of Mexico. Lion's paw scallops usually occur in low densities and cannot be farmed from a fishery. It is, however, a commonly used species for aquaculture in the Caribbean Colombian due to their quick growth rate.Museum specimen with successive species labels, Naturalis ==Description== The lion's paw can be 6.4 - 15.2 cm (2.5\u20136 in) long and are nearly circular. It has a moderately thick shell with flattened anterior wings near the hinge. In fact, the shell of the animal is very bright and is known for its thick and knobby texture. Their colors can range from red to orange; however, some appear purple and even yellow in hue. ==Ecology== The lion's paw is an epibenthic bivalve that lives in deep, tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean in rough sediment and rubble. They are also known to attach to the hard substrate they live in. Lion's paws are filter feeders, so they feed off of microalgae in the water column. Lion's paw scallops spawn twice a year. Along the coast of Brazil, they are known to spawn once in the winter and once again in the summer. Lion's paws rarely produce pearls, however, when they do, the pearl is composed mainly of calcite and are non-nacreous. ==References== Category:Pectinidae Category:Molluscs described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
