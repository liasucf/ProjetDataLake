    "text": "One More Time is a 1986 memoir by comedian Carol Burnett. It was published by Random House and became a New York Times non-fiction bestseller. Burnett spent her childhood in a Depression-scarred Hollywood neighborhood, where she lived in a dingy single-room apartment with her grandmother, a hypochondriac devoted to Christian Science. The child of alcoholic parents - a mother who fantasized about success in Tinseltown and a father who eventually was committed to a public sanatorium - she constantly daydreamed about a show business career while at the same time realizing the odds of achieving one were very much against her, until a mysterious benefactor financed her move to New York City. In this book, she presents a coming of age tale that's humorous, heartbreaking, and hopeful. The book served as the basis for the play Hollywood Arms, which Burnett co-wrote with her daughter Carrie Hamilton. ==References== ==External links== * Bookseller Amazon.com listing Category:1986 non-fiction books Category:Books by Carol Burnett Category:Carol Burnett Category:Memoirs set in Los Angeles Category:Show business memoirs ",
