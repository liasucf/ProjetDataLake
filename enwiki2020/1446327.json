    "text": "The Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770 is a social club for Harvard students. ==History== The society was founded on September 1, 1795, by Horace Binney, who was then 15, by calling together a meeting of 21 juniors in the room of Nymphas Hatch. The club is named for hasty pudding, a traditional American dish that the founding members ate at their first meeting. Each week two members in alphabetical order had to provide a pot of hasty pudding for the club to enjoy. It is the oldest collegiate social club in America. Originally, the club engaged in holding mock trials, which became more elaborate over time. This culminated in a member, Lemuel Hayward, secretly planning to stage a musical on the night he was to host the club's meeting. On December 13, 1844, Hayward and other members staged Bombastes Furioso in Hollis 11, which began the Hasty Pudding Theatricals. Throughout its history, the Hasty Pudding Club absorbed many others, such as In 1925, the Hasty Pudding Club absorbed the Institute of 1770, which was a similar social club. The Institute name is now part of the club's official title.http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/9/13/hasty-pudding-farkas-merger/ Former location of the Hasty Pudding Club at 12 Holyoke Street, Cambridge, now owned by Harvard Universityhttp://www.thecrimson.com/article/2000/4/6/faculty- will-take-control-of-hasty/?page=single and still used by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals The Hasty Pudding Club is currently the only social club on campus that is coed and has members from all four years. Membership in the club is gained through a series of lunches, cocktail parties, and other gatherings, which are referred to as the \"punch process\". The club holds its social activities in a clubhouse near Harvard Square. These include weekly Members' Nights, dinner and cocktail parties, as well as its elaborate theme parties, such as \"Leather and Lace.\" The current clubhouse contains multiple rooms with specific purposes. Among these rooms is \"The Arena,\" which is a room with no windows or openings to the outside world. The Arena is designated as the club's game room. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Cambridge, Massachusetts ==References== ==External links== * Category:Clubhouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Harvard University Category:Clubs and societies in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Cambridge, Massachusetts Category:Harvard Square Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cambridge, Massachusetts Category:1795 establishments in the United States Category:Organizations established in 1795 ",
