After some delays, the budget was announced in 2015 for the first phase of construction from Constituci\u00f3n to C\u00f3rdoba at a total cost of between 700 and 800 million dollars.Aprobaron el presupuesto de SBASE para 2015 - EnElSubte, 24 April 2015Piccardo anuncia la construcci\u00f3n de la l\u00ednea F - EnElSubte, 27 April 2015 As of 2015, it was not yet known if construction would be done as a turnkey project or build to order, however construction was due to start in 2016. ==Overview== The line is set to be the most modern in the network, using automatic trains, a Communications-based train control system like the one being installed on Line C, and Platform screen doors.Confirman proyecto para desviar la l\u00ednea F a Facultad de Derecho - EnElSubte, 25 November 2014. The line is also expected to have the highest ridership figures when compared to the existing lines. Currently, the second phase of the development is still being defined, since a new railway station is being considered to complement Retiro railway station, and if Line F is to have access to it, it would mean altering the trajectory of the northern part of the route to connect with Line H further north at the proposed station.Michetti resucita el pol\u00e9mico proyecto Retiro Norte - EnElSubte, 23 April 2015 ===Line E ghost stations=== In 2006, it was evaluated whether the two Line E ghost stations (San Jos\u00e9 vieja and Constituci\u00f3n) could be used as the southern point of Line F, considering they overlapped the line's trajectory. However, it was later decided that Line F would use a completely new tunnel with new stations given the frequency the line is expected to have.Realizar\u00e1n estudios en Constituci\u00f3n para ubicar la cabecera de la l\u00ednea F - 1 August 2011 ==Line Plan== ==References== == External links == * Subterr\u00e1neos de Buenos Aires (Official Page) New Lines * Buenos Aires Ciudad (Official Government Page) Nuevas L\u00edneas: F, G and I (Spanish) * System map Category:Buenos Aires Underground Category:Proposed railway lines in Argentina ",
