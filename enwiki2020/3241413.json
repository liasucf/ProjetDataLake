    "text": "Physical Illucinations in the Sewer of Xuchilbara (The Red God) is an EP by British cinematic industrial black metal band The Axis of Perdition. It was released on 15 November 2004 (see 2004 in music) on Code666 Records, catalogue number CODE026. Originally intended to be half of a split CD with Blut Aus Nord, the plan was prevented by financial difficulties. It was eventually released by Code666 as a limited edition EP limited to 666 copies. A reworked version of \"Chained in the Damnation Asylum\" was removed from the original track listing due to time constraints but was not reinstated on the EP. Several songs on the album contain voice samples from Claudia Wolf, the primary antagonist from the video game Silent Hill 3. The title of the EP is also a reference to the Silent Hill series of video games. Xuchilbara is an important god in the game's cult mythology and it is believed that Pyramid Head is a representation of Xuchilbara. Valtiel is also the presence of Xuchilbara and is featured heavily in the third game. In the fourth Silent Hill game, a serial killer named Walter Sullivan finds his soul split due to conflict of guilt and ambition, which leads one half to be empowered by Valtiel, making him \"The Red Devil\", a misnomer of the red god. ==Track listing== #\"Interference from the Other Side (Pendulums Prey)\" \u2013 5:01 #\"Where the World Becomes Flesh\" \u2013 5:12 #\"Pendulum Prey (Reciprocating Horror)\" \u2013 7:10 #\"Reopening Wounds of the Transition Hospital\" \u2013 2:22 #\"Heaving Salvation in the Paradise of Rust\" \u2013 10:22 Category:2004 albums Category:The Axis of Perdition albums ",
