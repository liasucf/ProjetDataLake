Boys' Town Engadine \u2013 Dunlea Centre provides intensive life skills, therapeutic and educational services in an out of home care setting. == History == A parish priest of Sutherland Shire, in 1934 Thomas Dunlea was requested by a dying woman to look after her son. After the woman's death, Dunlea took the boy to the parish presbytery. Over the ensuing years, a number of young boys were entrusted to his care during the Great Depression. The boys were moved to a bigger house, but after Sutherland Shire Council forced them onto the road, they set up tents in nearby Royal National Park. On 1 August 1939, Dunlea officially opened the school with seven boys in his care. The purpose of the school was to help disadvantaged young males. His inspiration was the 1938 movie Boystown, about Edward J. Flanagan, who founded the original Boystown in Nebraska, USA. Publicity led to a gift of at Engadine, where Boys' Town started in August 1940. It was to be partly self-supporting and to be run by the boys themselves\u2014with the priest's oversight. In 1942, at Archbishop Cardinal Sir Norman Gilroy's request, the De La Salle Brothers came to Boys' Town. Dunlea resigned his parish, and moved to the United States in 1947, returning to Australia in the late 1940s where he became to accept that he was an alcoholic. Dunlea described the school as: > \"Boys\u2019 Town is for homeless and friendless boys\u2014it is the hometown; the > fair-dinkum town; the town of charity, unity and kindness; it is a smooth > landing ground.\" In 1978 there was a total of 135 students (mostly 'boarders', with a small percentage of 'day' students) at Boys' Town. By 1989 the number of boys at Boys' Town had dropped to 40, with each boy having his own room. In 2010 the trading name of Boys' Town Engadine was changed to Dunlea Centre to reflect that the agency now runs residential programs for adolescent girls as well as boys == Notable alumni and former staff == === Alumni === *Ben Lexcen \u2013 designer of Australia's victorious (1983) America's Cup yacht. *John Travers - one of the Anita Cobby killers, sentenced to life imprisonment. *Ivan Milat \u2013 serial killer responsible for the Backpacker Murders *Robert Parsons - author Madigan Perry's Luck part of lead up to Royal Commission into institutional child abuse.
