    "text": "Helen Reddy is the second studio album by Australian-American pop singer Helen Reddy, released on November 8, 1971, by Capitol Records. Reddy's selections include tracks by singer-songwriters Carole King, John Lennon, Randy Newman, and Donovan. It debuted on Billboard magazine's Top LP's chart in the issue dated December 4, 1971, and had a seven-week chart run in which it got as high as number 167.. On March 29, 2005, the album was released for the first time on compact disc as one of two albums on one CD, the other album being I Don't Know How to Love Him, Reddy's debut LP that originally came out in the spring of 1971. __TOC__ ==Single== Billboard's December 4, 1971, issue also marked the first appearance of the single from the album, \"No Sad Song\", on the magazine's Hot 100, where it spent eight weeks and peaked at number 62,. and the December 25 issue, three weeks later, began the song's four weeks on the Easy Listening chart, where it reached number 32.. It also reached number 51 on the pop chart in Canada's RPM magazine. ==Reception== Village Voice critic Robert Christgau chose to highlight \"a scathing death-of-a-cocksman song that Carole King somehow left off Music ['No Sad Song'], a John Lennon autotherapy that sounds inquisitive instead of foolish ['How?'], and a frolicsome sisterhood ditty that [Reddy] wrote herself ['More Than You Could Take'].\" Joe Viglione of AllMusic retrospectively describes the album as \"a pleasant listening experience, though it was the only one of her early albums not to find representation on her Greatest Hits. Because there was no big hit on the record, it is not as well-known as her other recordings, but it definitely has charm and is an essential part of her collection of music.\" ==Track listing== Side 1 # \"Time\" (Paul Parrish) \u2013 3:38 #*Leland Sklar \u2013 bass #*Ron Tutt \u2013 drums #* Paul Parrish \u2013 piano # \"How?\" (John Lennon) \u2013 3:33 #*Nick DeCaro \u2013 string arrangement #*Jerry Scheff \u2013 bass #*Ron Tutt \u2013 drums #*Craig Doerge \u2013 piano #*Tom Hensley \u2013 piano # \"Come on John\" (David Blue) \u2013 4:21 #*Jerry Scheff \u2013 bass #*Ron Tutt \u2013 drums #*Craig Doerge \u2013 piano #*Tom Hensley \u2013 piano #*David Cohen \u2013 guitar # \"Summer of '71\" (Jack Conrad, Helen Reddy) \u2013 2:36 #* Jack Conrad \u2013 bass #*John Guerin \u2013 drums #*Dennis Budimir \u2013 guitar #*David Cohen \u2013 guitar # \"I Don't Remember My Childhood\" (Leon Russell) \u2013 3:32 #*Nick DeCaro \u2013 string arrangement #*Larry Knechtel \u2013 piano Side 2 # \"No Sad Song\" (Carole King, Toni Stern) \u2013 3:11 #*Nick DeCaro \u2013 accordion #*Ron Tutt \u2013 drums #*David Cohen \u2013 guitar #*Larry Carlton \u2013 mandolin # \"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\" (Randy Newman) \u2013 2:27 #*Bob Thompson \u2013 arranger # \"Tulsa Turnaround\" (Larry Collins, Alex Harvey) \u2013 3:24 #*Joe Osborn \u2013 bass #*Ron Tutt \u2013 drums #*Larry Carlton \u2013 electric guitar #*Tom Hensley \u2013 piano #*Sneaky Pete Kleinow \u2013 steel guitar # \"More Than You Could Take\" (Helen Reddy) \u2013 2:41 #*Jerry Scheff \u2013 bass #*Ron Tutt \u2013 drums #*Dean Parks \u2013 guitar #*John Brennan \u2013 guitar # \"New Year's Resovolution\" (Donovan) \u2013 3:40 #*Leland Sklar \u2013 bass #*Russ Kunkel \u2013 drums #*John Brennan \u2013 guitar #*Larry Carlton \u2013guitar #*David Cohen \u2013 guitar #*Milt Holland \u2013 percussion ;French version of \"No Sad Song\" In 2009 EMI Music Special Markets released Rarities from the Capitol Vaults, a 12-track CD of mostly what were previously unreleased Reddy recordings, which included \"Plus De Chansons Tristes\", the French version of \"No Sad Song\" that was only released in France.(2009) Rarities from the Capitol Vaults by Helen Reddy [CD booklet].
