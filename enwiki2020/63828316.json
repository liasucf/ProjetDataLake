Towers is perhaps best known for her study of the contagion effect of mass shootings. She is also the founder and owner of Towers Consulting LLC, a consulting company that uses applied statistics and computational modeling servicing industry, academia, and the public sectors. == Education == Towers earned a B.Sc in Physics at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada. She then earned a PhD in Physics at Carleton University in 2000. Her doctoral dissertation, A Study of decays of the tau lepton with charged kaons, was supervised by . In 2010, Towers earned an M.S. in Applied Statistics from Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN. == Career and research == Towers worked as a research scientist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, developing advanced machine learning techniques from 2000-2005. Following this position she started Towers Consulting LLC (2007) and worked as a postdoctoral research associate at Purdue University, modeling the spread of pandemic influenza. From 2012-2017 she served as a faculty research associate at the Simon A. Levin Mathematical, Computational and Modeling Sciences Center, at Arizona State University. She modeled the dynamics of social systems, including modeling the spread of panic in a population, developed predictive crime analytics, and studied attitudes toward gun control. She is best known for her work showing the contagious effects of mass shootings. She currently is a visiting scholar at Purdue University and an affiliate scholar at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies. == Selected publications == * \"Beyond Ebola: Lessons to mitigate future pandemics, 2015\" * \"Contagion in mass killings and school shootings, 2015\" * \"Estimate of the reproduction number of the 2015 Zika virus outbreak in Barranquilla, Colombia, and estimation of the relative role of sexual transmission, 2016\" * \"Quantifying the relative effects of environmental and direct transmission of norovirus, 2018\" == References == == External links == Category:Living people Category:Carleton University alumni Category:Purdue University alumni Category:Simon Fraser University alumni Category:Arizona State University faculty Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century Canadian mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:21st- century American women scientists Category:21st-century Canadian scientists Category:Data scientists Category:Women data scientists Category:Canadian expatriate academics Category:American expatriate academics Category:American expatriates in Germany Category:Canadian expatriates in Germany Category:American statisticians Category:Canadian statisticians Category:Women statisticians ",
