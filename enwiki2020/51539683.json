The theater is both a cultural meeting point for locals and a stage for international theatre productions. The theater is run by British actor and writer Michael Manicardi who acquired the neglected bath house around 1985 and transformed it into a theater. As a theater it seats between 50 and 150 audience, depending on the chosen configuration. ==History== The building has a distinct circular shape around a central chimney. It was the first free standing communal bath house, build (in 1920) for this purpose. Its architecture is in the distinct \u201cAmsterdamse school\u201d style. The building is a Dutch National monument (Dutch: Rijksmonument) Since 2005 the Badhuistheater has its own theater-company: The Badhuis International Theatre.
