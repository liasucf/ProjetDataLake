Thandiani is located in the northeast of Abbottabad District and is about from Abbottabad in the foothills of the Himalayas. To the east beyond the Kunhar River lies the snow-covered Pir Panjal mountain range of Kashmir. Visible to the north and northeast are the mountains of Kohistan and Kaghan. To the northwest are the snowy ranges of Swat and Chitral. The hills of Thandiani are about above sea level. Most of the people residing here belong to the Sadaat (Syed), Awan, Mughals, Qureshi, Abbasi, Jadoon Gujjar, and Karlal tribes. The nearest villages are Bandi Sarara Mara Rehmat Khan, Inderseri, Birnagalli, Chattri, Chamaili, Sialkot, Pattan, Okharela, Dheri, Darer and Kukmang. ==History== Thandiani was originally granted as a lease to some members of the Battye familySee 'Early Leases in the Hazara' in Major Wace's Full and Permanent Settlement Report of the Hazara District 1868-1874, Annex 1. pub. 1874, pp.379-380 in British India, who were Christian missionaries and also found in civil and military service, and who produced scions such as Wigram Battye and Quintin Battye.Of the Corps of Guides (British India)For a history of the members of this unique family, see Evelyn Desiree Battye, The Fighting Ten, London: British Association for Cemeteries in South Asia publications, 1984.
