    "text": "Jordan and Turkey share a relatively close relationship due to long historical commons, as both are majority two Sunni Muslim nations and sharing a strong historic tie. Turkey has an embassy in Amman; Jordan has an embassy in Ankara in response. ==History== ===Ottoman Empire=== Following Ottoman conquest, the Hashemite rulers of the Hejaz pledged allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan in 1517 following the Ottoman conquest of Egypt, placing the holy cities of Mecca and Medina under Ottoman Protection until the Arab revolt in 1916 when Sharif Hussayn of Mecca expelled them with the aid of Britain. This had led to scrutiny and hostilities from the Turks towards the Hashemites due to the Hashemites' attempt to create a post-Ottoman state, which ended up in failure. ===Modern relations=== Following the Turkish War of Independence, Sharif Abdullah and founder of Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk had a close personal relationship, even met each other in Istanbul at 1937. In years next, with the complete independence of Jordan from British affairs at 1956, two countries established full relations. Entire of the Cold War, Jordan and Turkey both shared pro-Western view, strongly anti-communist and very critical of the new Islamic regime in Iran to a point they even supported Iraq during the Iran\u2013Iraq War. Toward the end of the Cold War, both nations adopted to a new, more polar world. ==Cooperations== As Jordan and Turkey are considered to be liberal in a turbulent region like MENA, Jordan and Turkey share a close tie based on common mutual gestures, although sometimes strained due to conflict with Jordanian interests. Two countries also vowed to strengthen their bilateral tie. Both Jordan and Turkey share common concerns over the status of Jerusalem and criticized Israel's overact in the city. Nonetheless, differences between Jordan and Turkey still prevail over trade disputes and the growing role of Turkey in the Middle East. Jordan, a country highly dependent on aid, has attempted to secure a neutral position, however, on its relations with neighbors and hegemons, including Turkey. ==See also== * Foreign relations of Jordan * Foreign relations of Turkey ==References== Category:Bilateral relations of Jordan Category:Bilateral relations of Turkey Category:Relations of colonizer and former colony ",
