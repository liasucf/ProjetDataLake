It was formed in 1991 by Fidelity Investments after it bought Dole Publishing from its longtime owner, William P. Dole. Bay State Newspaper was folded into the Metro Unit of Fidelity's Community Newspaper Company in 1996. CNC is now owned by GateHouse Media. Bay State's properties were assembled by the Dole family, which ran the Cambridge Chronicle from the 1930s to early 1990s. The Chronicle, newspaper of record for the city of Cambridge, has published since 1846 and, under the Doles, was combined with the rival Cambridge Sun. The Doles also acquired the main weeklies in two other suburban cities north of Boston, as well as printing other publications (such as shoppers).\"Dole Publishing Is Sold\".
