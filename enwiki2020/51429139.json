    "text": "Thirty Eight is the fourth studio album by Detroit-based hip hop producer Apollo Brown, released digitally on April 29, 2014 by Mello Music Group. The album was later released physically, on CD and vinyl, with their own bonus tracks. Apollo Brown described Thirty Eight as a ride through Detroit of the early 1980s, that was inspired by various 1970s and 1980s films' soundtracks. One single was released from the album, \"The Answer\", as a preorder bonus. ==Album title== According to Apollo Brown, the album was named after .38 caliber revolver: ==Critical reception== Thirty Eight received positive reviews from music critics. Exclaim! gave the album seven out of ten, saying that the album \"carries an inference to the smoky, gritty sound of '70s soul while updating it with modernized production and hip-hop soul sensibilities\" and commending Apollo Brown, who \"gets better each time out\". PopMatters also gave it seven out of ten, calling it \"another win for Brown\", but named lack of rappers as album's biggest weakness. \"These beats are crying out for rappers,\" added the critic. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Bandcamp: * Apollo Brown \u2013 producer * Michael Tolle \u2013 executive producer * Matt \"Magnetic\" Oleksiak \u2013 mixing * Eric Morgeson \u2013 mastering * Sarah Mattmiller \u2013 design * Austin Hart \u2013 creative director * Corey Sheridan \u2013 digital advisor * Joe Dent \u2013 physical advisor * Matt Conaway \u2013 media advisor ==References== ==External links== * Category:2014 albums Category:Albums produced by Apollo Brown Category:Instrumental hip hop albums Category:Mello Music Group albums ",
