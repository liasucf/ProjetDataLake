As an insurgent, he is known mainly to historians, while with the interesting data he provided to historiography, he became known to a wider readership.\u041c\u0438\u043b\u0430\u043d \u0402. \u041c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u045b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b (1876): \u041a\u043d\u0435\u0436\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430. \u0414\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 It was historian Milan Mili\u0107evi\u0107 who recorded Petar Joki\u0107's experiences during the First Serbian Uprising on behalf of the Serbian Royal Academy of Sciences before he died. According to the decision of the censor, his testimony could not appear in print during the reign of Prince Aleksandar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, but much later, only in 1891. There were two other revolutionaries, Jani\u0107ije \u0110uri\u0107 and Anta Proti\u0107, who also wrote their eyewitness accounts about the war of independence. ==Biography== Petar Joki\u0107 was born in Topola around 1779, and at the time of the uprising, in 1804, he was a young man in full strength. Until then, well known to Kara\u0111or\u0111e, Joki\u0107 was his right hand in the first days of the preparation for the uprising. Joki\u0107 is one of those who threw the first spark in the Turkish hans (inns) and started the battle. From that time until the whole series of events, Joki\u0107 was always in the physical and immediate vicinity of Kara\u0111or\u0111e, becoming an officer, a Boluk-bashi, the personal leader of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's personal Guard. Thus, Joki\u0107 had the opportunity to see, hear, learn and do a lot. He survived many difficult situations on the battlefields and overcame many wounds. Heroic, reliable, wise and prudent, Joki\u0107 had a serious word in the greatest company of the first dukes (voivodes). The circumstances were often such that the Vo\u017ed (Grand Leader Kara\u0111or\u0111e) had to be left without his escort detachment at critical moments because it was dispatched where it was most needed at the time. Joki\u0107 often only received orders to move, without notice nor explanation. In 1813, he was on the Drina and in \u0160abac, from where he was preparing for the capture of Belgrade with Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107, but he received news that Belgrade had already been taken by the Ottoman Turks and that Vo\u017ed Kara\u0111or\u0111e had already crossed the Sava. After the collapse of the uprising, in 1813, he lived with his family until 1838 in Zemun, then under the rule of the Austrian Empire, where he opened his trading company. After the liberation of Serbia, Joki\u0107 returned to his homeland and became a member of the Valjevo District Court, where he also retired when he went to Topola, the place of his birth. He lived there until his death in 1852.\u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b (2008): \u0417\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438 XIX \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430. \u0414\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u043f\u0443\u045a\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u045a\u0435. \u041d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u041c\u0414, \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 == References == Category:Serbian revolutionaries Category:1779 births Category:1852 deaths ",
