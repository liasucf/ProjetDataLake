    "text": "The nickname of grandmother of Europe has been given to various women, primarily female sovereigns who are the ascendant of many members of European nobility and royalty, as well as women who made important contributions to Europe. ==Royalty== Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122\u20131204) was Queen-consort of France from 1137 to 1152, then of England from 1154 to 1189. She earned the nickname because her descendants included royalty in England, Denmark, Castile, and Sicily, among other kingdoms. \u00c9l\u00e9onore Desmier d'Olbreuse (1639\u20131722) was the wife of George William, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, and the maternal grandmother of George II of Great Britain. Maria Theresa (1717\u20131780), Empress of Austria, was the only female ruler of the Habsburg Monarchy. Many of her children and grandchildren married many European royals and nobles. Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais (1763\u20131814) was Empress-consort of French Emperor Napoleon. She was the maternal grandmother of Napoleon III and the great-grandmother of several Swedish and Danish royals. Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily (1782\u20131866) was Queen-consort of the French king Louis Philippe I. She is known as Grand-m\u00e8re de l'Europe. Queen Victoria (1819\u20131901) was Queen of the United Kingdom and Empress of India. She had nine children, who married with royal families throughout Europe. ==Others== Louise Weiss (1893\u20131983) was a French author and a European Union politician.
