He baptized Emperor Theodosius I. Ascholius was appointed Bishop of Thessalonica by Damasus, Bishop of Rome in an attempt to preserve Roman influence over the area in the face of a policy of expansion pursued by the Bishop of Constantinople. Ascholius was present at the Second Council of Constantinople in 381 where the claims of Maximus the Cynic to the bishopric of Constantinople were rejected. ==References== *Patrologia Latina XIII, pp. 366\u2013369.
