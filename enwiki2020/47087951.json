It broadcasts on 89.5 MHz from studios on the UAQ campus and was simulcast on AM station XEUAQ-AM 580 until 2015. ==History== XHUAQ-FM came to air for the first time at 8am on Friday, August 3, 1979. The new station was the first cultural radio station in the state of Quer\u00e9taro and primarily had musical programming. Cultural programming increased its prevalence in the 1980s, with international programs being bought from such countries as Israel, Germany and the United States; at the same time, more university students and faculty became involved in the station's operations. One of the programs introduced in the 1980s, \"Jazzmania\", has been on the air since 1983 and is the oldest radio program in the state of Quer\u00e9taro. The mid-1980s saw the first expansion of the XHUAQ facilities, followed by the 1987 launch of the AM station, which operated with 250 watts of power. The station also programmed more hours, particularly in the evening, adding children's programming, Caribbean music and rock in Spanish. In 2001, Luis Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda brought the station into 24-hour operation and briefly separated the programming on AM and FM. This arrangement lasted for two years. The AM station left the air in 2015. That same year, XHUAQ was authorized to increase power to 3,000 watts. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Quer\u00e9taro Category:Radio stations established in 1979 Category:University radio stations in Mexico Category:1979 establishments in Mexico ",
