It is constituted around the personal collection of art and antiquities owned by the industrialist Raoul Warocqu\u00e9 (1870\u20131917) which were bequeathed to the Belgian state on his death. ==Museum and collection== The museum displays a notable collection of Tournai porcelain and books, as well as antiquities from Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, Ancient Rome and the Far East. In 2012, the museum was expanded by a bequest of Pre- Columbian art from the collection of Yves and Yolande Bo\u00ebl. Artefacts from archaeological excavations in the Province of Hainaut are also displayed. The original Ch\u00e2teau des Warocqu\u00e9 in which the museum was housed was destroyed by fire in 1960. The current museum is housed in a building designed by the architect Roger Bastin, which was opened in 1975.
