    "text": "The Remix is a remix album by American singer Lady Gaga. Released in Japan on March 3, 2010, it contains remixes of the songs from her first studio album, The Fame (2008), and her third extended play, The Fame Monster (2009). A revised version of the track list was prepared for release in additional markets, beginning with Mexico on May 3, 2010. A number of recording artists have produced the songs, including Pet Shop Boys, Passion Pit and The Sound of Arrows. The remixed versions feature both uptempo and downtempo compositions, with altered vocals from Gaga. The album received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, but some noted how Gaga was able to sell the songs from The Fame in new and novel ways. It reached the top of charts in Greece and the Dance/Electronic Albums chart of Billboard magazine in the United States. In other nations, The Remix charted within the top ten in Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia region), Canada, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the Billboard 200 chart of United States, while reaching the top-twenty in others. It was certified platinum in Japan and Brazil and received gold certification in Belgium and Russia. Worldwide the album has sold over 500,000 copies and it is among the best-selling remix albums of all time. ==Background== On April 15, 2010, The Guardian reported that a number of artists, including Pet Shop Boys, Passion Pit and rock musician Marilyn Manson, have contributed to a remix album by Lady Gaga, titled The Remix. The remixes included in the package had been previously released alongside Gaga's single releases in the past years. The album was originally released in Japan on March 3, 2010, containing sixteen of the remixes. The revised version, consisting of seventeen remixes, was released on May 3, 2010, the first market being Mexico. Manson features on the Chew Fu remix of \"LoveGame\", while Passion Pit remixed \"Telephone\" and Pet Shop Boys remixed \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\". Other artists who remixed Gaga's songs included Alphabeat, Frankmusik, Stuart Price, Monarchy and Robots to Mars. The album was released in the United Kingdom on May 10, 2010 and featured a different artwork for that region. The US release of the album was announced by Interscope Records in July 2010 and it was released on August 3, 2010. ==Composition== Gaga used fragments of the Chew Fu Ghettohouse Mix version during the performance of \"LoveGame\" in The Monster Ball Tour. Chuck Campbell from the California Chronicle felt that the main \"trick\" adopted by the producers behind The Remix, was to preserve the integrity of Gaga's nuances in her songs, at the same time bringing something new to her music. The second song in the track list, the \"LLG vs GLG Radio Mix\" of \"Poker Face\", features a computerized chanting of the \"mum-mum-mum- mah\" hook of the song. Stuart Price remixed \"Paparazzi\" into an electronic version, changing the original mid-tempo composition of the song. New vocals were added on top of the song, giving it a jungle-like vibe, according to Nicki Escuerdo from Phoenix New Times. She also felt that the remix of \"LoveGame\" featuring Manson, changed the original composition by \"giving the originally innocent and fun song an almost demonic quality\". According to Campbell, The Monarchy Stylites remix of \"Dance in the Dark\" \"pump[ed] extra oomph\" into the song, with addition of drum beats. Richard Vission's remix of \"Just Dance\" introduced an elastic rhythm in the song, while Frankmusik changed the soft composition of \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\" to a more upbeat one, also manipulating Gaga's vocals in the process. Campbell also added that the Passion Pit remix of \"Telephone\" felt like a \"theatrical set up for a song that feels like it's going somewhere, but never does\"; the remix consists of synths, with a thumping beat accompanying the song. Sound of Arrows remixed \"Alejandro\", changing the dark nature of its music into a bright, summery jam while \"Bad Romance\" was remixed by Starsmith, making it a complete dance track. ==Critical reception== Upon its release, the album met with mixed reviews. At Metacritic it holds an aggregate score of 54 out of 100 points, indicating generally mixed or average reviews. Simon Cage from the Daily Express gave the album three out of five stars and felt that although she \"has a winning way with ostentatious hats\", Gaga's true talent lies in selling the same album over and over again. \"It\u2019s great but... enough already!\" Music critic J. D. Considine, while reviewing the album for The Globe and Mail, complimented the piano and voice version of \"Poker Face\" adding that the latter was \"the smartest track on her newest remix album\". He felt that the song \"brings out her inner Elton John. And yes, this move, too, is probably just another bit of calculated image management, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less brilliant.\" Robert Copsey from Digital Spy noted that the release of The Remix was a more natural progression than music labels trying to \"cash-in\" by releasing something not associated with the artist. He complimented the remixers featured in the album, calling them \"as vital to keeping the singer's music fresh as her Haus Of GaGa designers are to her image.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, but felt that the track list could have been shortened. Erlewine complimented some of the remixes, including those by Pet Shop Boys and Space Cowboy, adding that The Remix \"is not an essential addition to Gaga\u2019s canon goes without saying... but there\u2019s glitz and glamour to enjoy here.\" Mark Beech, reviewing the album for Bloomberg Television, noticed that the already familiar tracks from Gaga \"are given a new sheen by the Pet Shop Boys and sometime Madonna producer Stuart Price.\" Nicki Escudero from Phoenix New Times gave a positive review saying that the songs featured in The Remix can be a great addition during workouts, as well as staple dance floor music. She listed the Chew Fu remix of \"LoveGame\" as a highlight from the album. Monica Herrera from Billboard complimented the album saying \"Gaga has employed a collection of more-than-capable producers to make her dance-ready smashes from The Fame and The Fame Monster even more danceworthy.\" Giving it three out of five stars, Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone noted an uneven sequencing among the tracks in The Remix. She felt that the Passion Pit remix of \"Telephone\" was the best remix on the album. ==Commercial performance== Following the album's release in Japan, it debuted at number nine on the Oricon Albums Chart. On the issue dated May 17, 2010, the album moved to a new peak of number seven and has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 250,000 copies.

Billboard chart manager Keith Caulfield noted that Gaga became the first act to occupy the chart's top three positions, in its nine-year history. She additionally charted on the Billboard 200, with The Fame at number 12 and The Fame Monster at number 27, marking the first time an artist placed three concurrent titles in the top 30 since January 23, 1993, when Garth Brooks placed four sets in the top 30: The Chase at number two, Beyond the Season at number 23, Ropin' the Wind at number 26 and No Fences at number 29.
