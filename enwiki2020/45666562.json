    "text": "Benedikt \"Ben\" Aage Munk (3 December 1929 - 13 March 2009) was professor of electrical engineering at the ElectroScience Laboratory (ESL) at The Ohio State University (OSU), Columbus, Ohio, USA. Quote: \"Munk, who is a professor of electrical engineering and associate supervisor of the ElectroScience Laboratory at Ohio State ...\". Munk is best known for his contributions to the field of periodic surfaces and antennae, especially ultra wide band antenna arrays using tightly coupled elements. He is the author of many papers on periodic surfaces and antennas, as well as two key books named \"Finite Antenna Arrays and FSS\" and \"Frequency Selective Surfaces: Theory and Design\". Unlike other antenna books that heavily emphasize theory and mathematics, Munk's approach is based on intuitive understanding and engineering aspects of the subjects. He had contributed two chapters to the third edition of John Kraus' classic book, \"Antennas for All Applications\", published in 2002. Munk received a masters degree in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Denmark and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from The Ohio State University (OSU) in 1954 and 1968, respectively. He joined the ElectroScience Laboratory in 1964, where he was a professor and later, professor emeritus, until he died. Prior to joining ESL, Munk was a chief designer for A/S Nordisk Antenne Fabrik, Denmark, and an assistant group leader in the antenna section of Rohde and Schwarz in Munich, Germany. Later, he was a research and development engineer with the Andrew Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, and then an antenna researcher with Rockwell International in Columbus, Ohio. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:2009 deaths Category:American electrical engineers Category:Ohio State University alumni Category:Ohio State University faculty Category:20th-century American engineers ",
