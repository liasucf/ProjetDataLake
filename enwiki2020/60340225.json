    "text": "Pharaoh Peaks from the Healy Pass area Pharaoh Peaks is a mountain with three summits located in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. Pharaoh Peaks are part of the Ball Range in the Canadian Rockies. The nearest higher peak is Scarab Peak, to the southwest. The mountain's name Pharaoh was in keeping with the Egyptian theme of the immediate surrounding area, e.g., Egypt Lake, Pharaoh Lake, Mummy Lake, and Scarab Lake, which were applied in 1922 by Arthur O. Wheeler of the Interprovincial Boundary Survey. Wheeler regarded the area particularly beautiful when he wrote: \"After 30 years of exploration, surveys and mapping the main ranges of the Canadian Rockies, the writer ... can safely say that outstanding among them for scenic charm and interest may be classed the group of peaks, lakes and alpine meadows of the Egypt Lake area.\"Banff - Assiniboine: a beautiful world : a guide to the trails and the rich history of Banff National Park from Palliser Pass to Vermilion Pass, plus the core area of Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park by Don Beers, Highline Publishing, 1993. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1956 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. ==Geology== Like other mountains in Banff Park, Pharaoh Peaks are composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below \u221230 \u00b0C. In terms of favorable weather, June through September are the best months to climb the mountain. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Bow River. ==See also== * Geography of Alberta ==References== ==External links== * Weather forecast: Pharaoh Peaks * Parks Canada web site: Banff National Park Category:Mountains of Alberta Category:Canadian Rockies ",
