Its population in 2001 was 103,516. ==Geography== The riding extends along the north bank of the Saint Lawrence River between the north suburbs of Montreal and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, straddling the Quebec regions of Lanaudi\u00e8re and Mauricie. The district includes the Regional County Municipalities of D'Autray and Maskinong\u00e9, and the former cities of Pointe-du-Lac and Trois-Rivi\u00e8res-Ouest in the City of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.

This riding lost territory to Trois-Rivi\u00e8res and gained territory from Joliette during the 2012 electoral redistribution. ==History== The riding was created in 1924 from Berthier and Maskinong\u00e9. It consisted of Berthier County and Maskinong\u00e9 County. In 1947, it was redefined to consist of the county of Berthier and the town of Berthierville, the county of Maskinong\u00e9 and the town of Louiseville, and Gouin township in the county of Joliette. In 1952, it was abolished when it was merged into Berthier\u2014Maskinong\u00e9\u2014delanaudi\u00e8re riding. The riding was recreated in 1966 as \"Berthier\" from the districts of Berthier\u2014Maskinong\u00e9\u2014delanaudi\u00e8re, Chapleau, Joliette\u2014L'Assomption\u2014Montcalm, St-Maurice\u2014Lafl\u00e8che, and Three Rivers. In 1975, the name of the riding was changed to \"Berthier-Maskinong\u00e9\". After the 1980 election, the name of the district was changed to Berthier\u2014Maskinong\u00e9\u2014Lanaudi\u00e8re. In the 1984 election, the seat was won by Progressive Conservative Robert de Cotret, who held it until the 1988 election. The riding was abolished in 1987. It was divided between Berthier\u2014Montcalm, Champlain, and Saint-Maurice. Berthier\u2014Maskinong\u00e9 was re- created in 2003. 44.8% of the riding came from Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, 36.0% from Berthier\u2014Montcalm, and 19.2% from Saint-Maurice.
