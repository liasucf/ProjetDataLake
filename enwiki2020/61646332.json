The site has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1975. ==Overview== K\u014dkukuji Castle is located on a ridge in the Ashitaka Mountains southwest of the center of modern Numazu city center. It consists of several kuruwa terraces protected by stone walls and a deep dry moat. ==History== K\u014dkukuji Castle was originally built by the Imagawa clan to protect the eastern border of Suruga Province in the 15th century. Around 1487, it came under the control of H\u014dj\u014d S\u014dun, founder of the late H\u014dj\u014d clan. H\u014dj\u014d S\u014dun's sister, Kitagawa-dono was married to Imagawa Yoshitada, and H\u014dj\u014d S\u014dun became a retainer of the Imagawa clan. Yoshitada fell in battle in 1476 and as his son Imagawa Ujichika was still a minor, Ojika Norimitsu was appointed regent. However, Norimitsu later refused to turn over power as agreed, so H\u014dj\u014d S\u014dun and his henchmen had him killed in order for the succession to go to his nephew Imagawa Ujichika. In return, Ujichika appointed H\u014dj\u014d S\u014dun castellan of K\u014dkuku Castle. But he moved his main castle to Nirayama Castle. In 1491, H\u014dj\u014d S\u014dun intervened in the conflict between the Ashikaga shogunate and the Ashikaga of the Horigoe Gosho and seized control of Izu Province. He then relocated to Niirayama Castle in central Izu, returning K\u014dkuku Castle back to the Imagawa. The castle later changed hands between the Takeda clan and the Tokugawa clan after the fall of the Imagawa. After the Battle of Sekigahara, Tokugawa Ieyasu assigned the castle to Amano Yasukage, one of his old retainers. Amano was later disposed after an uprising in his territory and the castle was abolished in 1607. K\u014dkokuji Castle is now only ruins with some stone wall, earthen wallsand dry moat. The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017. ==Gallery== Koukokuji-castle2.jpg|Tenshu Koukokuji- castle3.jpg|Honmaru compound from Tenshu Koukokuji-castle4.jpg|Earthen wall Koukokuji-castle6.jpg|Large dry moat Koukokujijou001.jpg|Large dry moat2 ==See also== *List of Historic Sites of Japan (Shizuoka) == References == * == External links == Numazu city homepage Category:Castles in Shizuoka Prefecture Category:Ruined castles in Japan Category:History of Shizuoka Prefecture Category:15th-century establishments in Japan Category:Numazu, Shizuoka Category:Historic Sites of Japan Category:Suruga Province Category:Go-H\u014dj\u014d clan Category:Imagawa clan ",
