She introduces the term \"feminization of poverty\" from the feminist economist point of view. \"\u2018Feminization of poverty,\u2019\" Jain explains, \"was used to describe three distinct elements: that women have a higher incidence of poverty than men, that women\u2019s poverty is more severe than that of men, that a trend toward greater poverty among women is associated with rising rates of female-headed households.\"(Jain 2005) According to her, \"feminization of work\" connotes low- quality, lowly-paid work. Jain argues that \"feminization\" devalues the increased presence of women.Jain, Devaki. 2005.
