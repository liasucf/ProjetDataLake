His book Collateral Frameworks: The Open Secret of Central Banks on Cambridge University Press (2017) lays bare the \"hidden\" workings and practices of central banks. In the book he argues that more focus should be placed on central bank collateral policy as an important and integral component of monetary policy. == Career == Nyborg holds a Ph.D., with a specialization in Finance, from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and an S.B. in Mathematics with General Honors (and Sigma Xi) from the University of Chicago.

He argues that \"money matters\" and quoting Walter Bagehot \"money is economical power\"Bagehot, W (1873), Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market, Homewood, IL: Richard D. Irwin, Inc. (reprinted in 1962 from the Scribner, Armstrong & Co. edition). states that \"[t]he money at the core of modern economies is central bank money, what bankers call \u2018liquidity\u2019. Central banks inject money into the economy, using banks as intermediaries, against collateral. So, if money is economic power and money is issued against collateral, it is important to understand the nature of this collateral, and the terms of the exchange.\"VOX article from 24.01.2017 \"Collateral frameworks: The open secret of central banks\" http://voxeu.org/article/how-central-bank- collateral-frameworks-distort-economy He shows that central banks' size and importance increased substantially in the last decade and if one wants to understand how financial systems work one has to look closely into what central banks are doing. Nyborg's broader agenda is to investigate the role of money in finance. Modern macroeconomics and finance often ignore money, it is rarely modeled explicitly in the theory of banking and finance. However, Nyborg argues that money and its architecture matter and are critical for understanding financial markets and the broader economy. Taking the Eurozone as an example, Nyborg shows that the Eurosystem's collateral framework promotes illiquid and risky collateral and that it impairs market forces and discipline. In their place, we find rating agencies, government guarantees, and political forces. He argues that \"[w]ell-functioning monetary and financial systems are important to the efficient flow of resources and private and social welfare. ... Widespread financial market interventions by central banks have made it difficult to gauge \u201ccorrect\u201d market prices... This undermines the efficient allocation of resources in the economy. Improving our understanding of the workings of the monetary and financial system is therefore of central, and also urgent, importance. ... Transparency is also important vis-\u00e0-vis the public at large.\" ...Nyborg, K G (2017), Collateral Frameworks: The Open Secret of Central Banks, Cambridge University Press. Nyborg's work on collateral frameworks has opened up the workings of central banks and how they manage and control capital markets and the economy through their collateral policies. == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Stanford Graduate School of Business alumni Category:Norwegian economists Category:Academics of the London Business School Category:UCLA Anderson School of Management faculty Category:Academics of University College Dublin Category:BI Norwegian Business School faculty Category:University of Zurich faculty ",
