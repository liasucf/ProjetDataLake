    "text": "Xuxa Park was a Brazilian children's television series directed by Marlene Mattos, and hosted by Xuxa Meneghel. It was aired Globo from June 4, 1994 to January 6, 2001. The show is a Brazilian version of Xuxa Park produced by Spain's Tele5 in 1992. The program marked the turn of the host to the children's public, because its previous attraction, the homonym Xuxa (1993), was dedicated to the whole family. Occupying Saturday morning, the program featured jokes, musical numbers, and cartoons. The last program was remembered for the commemoration of the day of kings exhibited on January 6, 2001, that is, the only program of the year, since it was canceled on leaving the air due to the tragic fire that occurred on January 11, 2001, when would later come to the Carnival special of that year on February 24, 2001. == History == === Background === Xuxa Park was hosted by Brazilian superstar Xuxa, an actress, model and singer that became wildly popular with young viewers through her hosting of many similar shows in both Spanish and Portuguese (plus a one- season attempt at breaking into the U.S. television market with a show in English).

She also hosted a more adult TV show concurrent with Xuxa Park\u2014in this show (Planeta Xuxa) she would, among other things, interview guests about their sexual habits. This history has led some to condemn her as an inappropriate role model for children.
