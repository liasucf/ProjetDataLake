Olivera worked mainly in the cinema of Argentina, but also has directed or contributed to several films made for the United States market. ==Biography== He began his career when he was seventeen as a second assistant director and founded his own production company in 1956 at age twenty-five. He has produced over 100 features. In the United States he is known for two of his films: Night of the Pencils (1986) and Funny Dirty Little War (1983). After completing Funny Dirty Little War, he directed five films for Roger Corman: Cocaine Wars (1985), Barbarian Queen (1985), Wizards of the Lost Kingdom (1985), Two to Tango (1988), and Play Murder for Me (1990).Film Festivals web site. He has occasionally received criticism for his choice of projects. While he has been recognized for delivering poignant political messages in some of his films he has also directed much more commercial fare. Argentine film historian Tamara Falicov addressed Olivera's track record in an article about American and Argentine co-productions in the 1980s and 1990s: > \"Olivera stated in an interview that these more politically engaged films > were in a sense \"subsidized\" by the more popular genres that he and Ayala > produced. In order for Argentine film to survive, Olivera believes, it must > conform to an industrial model as well as serving as a vehicle for cultural > production. This model thus far has been successful, as Aries is one of the > few remaining Argentine film studios still in production.\"Tamara L. Falicov > \"U.S.-Argentine Co-productions, 1982-1990: Roger Corman, Aries Productions, > 'Schlockbuster' Movies, and the International Market\" Film & History 2004 > Vol.34, Iss. 1; pg. 31-38 ===Festival juries=== In 1988 he was selected as a member of the jury for the feature films official selection at the Cannes Film Festival.Cannes Film Festival web site.
