    "text": "Catherine Greenhill is an Australian mathematician known for her research on random graphs, combinatorial enumeration and Markov chains. She is a professor of mathematics in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New South Wales, and an editor-in-chief of the Electronic Journal of Combinatorics. ==Education and career== Greenhill did her undergraduate studies at the University of Queensland, and remained there for a master's degree, working with Anne Penfold Street there. She earned her Ph.D. in 1996 at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Peter M. Neumann. Her dissertation was From Multisets to Matrix Groups: Some Algorithms Related to the Exterior Square. After postdoctoral research with Martin Dyer at the University of Leeds and Nick Wormald at the University of Melbourne, Greenhill joined the University of New South Wales in 2003. She was promoted to associate professor in 2014, becoming the first female mathematician to earn such a promotion at UNSW. ==Recognition== Greenhill was the 2010 winner of the Hall Medal of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications. She was president of the Combinatorial Mathematics Society of Australasia for 2011\u20132013. In 2015 the Australian Academy of Science awarded her their Christopher Heyde Medal for distinguished research in the mathematical sciences. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Australian women mathematicians Category:Women mathematicians Category:Graph theorists Category:University of Queensland alumni Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:University of New South Wales faculty ",
