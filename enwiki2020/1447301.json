In the summer of 1999 Kinsk\u00fd broke his thumb, resultantly not playing for the autumn half of the 1999\u20132000 season and subsequently sharing goalkeeping duties with Zbyn\u011bk Hauzr in the spring. Liberec finished the season by winning the 1999\u20132000 Czech Cup.

During a UEFA Cup match in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi in October 2002, Kinsk\u00fd was targeted by bottles thrown onto the pitch from the crowd as the home team was defeated 1\u20130 in the match and 4\u20132 on aggregate. Three policemen were injured in the incident. He played in goal in a 4\u20130 league defeat against Viktoria \u017di\u017ekov in October 2002, a game he described as \"probably the worst match in my life.\" November 2002 was more successful for Kinsk\u00fd as he saved two penalties in a UEFA Cup penalty shootout, after the second round tie against Ipswich Town had ended level after extra time. Resultantly Liberec qualified for the third round of the competition, although Kinsk\u00fd missed both matches against Panathinaikos due to injury.

In 2005, he was vice captain for the team, captaining the side in the absence of captain Viktor Onopko. Following the 2006 World Cup, Kinsk\u00fd signed a contract extension to stay at the club for another three years. He was named the best goalkeeper of the Russian Football Premier League in 2007. He kept his 100th top division clean sheet in a match against Tomsk in September 2008, becoming the 17th Czech goalkeeper to reach this figure. In October 2008, Kinsk\u00fd was offered the chance to move to Chelsea to be the backup goalkeeper for Petr \u010cech, an offer which he rejected. In November 2010 Kinsk\u00fd played his 200th competitive match for the club. Before the last game of the 2010 season, he was presented with a football shirt with the number 201 on it, intended to represent the number of games he had played for the club. However, due to injury Kinsk\u00fd was unable to take part in the match, so 200 was his actual number of competitive appearances. He left Saturn upon the expiry of his contract in December 2010. ==International career== Kinsk\u00fd played for the under-17 team of Czechoslovakia in 1992, making two appearances.
