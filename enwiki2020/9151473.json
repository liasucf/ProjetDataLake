This approach was espoused by the militant Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade led by Padraig McKearney and Jim Lynagh, who wanted an escalation of the conflict to what they termed \"total war\". They were opposed by Kevin McKenna, the IRA Chief of Staff and by the republican leadership headed by Gerry Adams, on the grounds that actions on that scale were too big a risk and unsustainable. The IRA leadership wanted a smaller scale campaign of attrition, supplemented by political campaigning by Sinn F\u00e9in.Ed Moloney, The Secret History of the IRA, p313-314The I.R.A., Tim Pat Coogan, 1995.

MacGiolla Bhrighde observed a RUC patrol car approaching the restaurant and gave the detonation code word \"one\". However, the mine failed to explode.
