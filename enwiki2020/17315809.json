    "text": "\"L\u00e0-bas\" is a 1987 song recorded as a duet by the French singer Jean-Jacques Goldman and the British-born artist Sirima. It was the second single from Goldman's 1987 double album Entre gris clair et gris fonc\u00e9. It was a smash hit in France and became a popular song throughout the years. ==Background, lyrics and music== In 1987, Goldman had finished composing the song but had not yet found a female voice to record the duet with him. Philippe Delettrez, Goldman's saxophonist, met Sirima who sang in a Parisian metro, and suggested that Goldman meet her. After several takes in studio, Goldman finally decided to record the duet with her.G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Laser, RTL, 18 November 1991 Composed by Jean-Jacques Goldman, the song deals with \"the need of escape and the dilemma between a vital renewal and the loss of one's roots\". Goldman and Sirima sing the song as a fictional couple from a unidentified country, described as poor and socially rigged. While the man wants to go away to start a more fruitful life in the country of his dreams (also unidentified and thus acting as a universal metaphor), the woman, who personifies \"stability, rooting and habit\", warns him about all kinds of dangers he could encounter and begs him to stay with her and start a family. The song is built as a dialogue that ends with two monologues in which \"one is decided, while the other begs\". The song was also released under the title \"Over there\" to win over the anglophone countries. On Radio Canada, it was awarded best francophone song of the year thanks to the votes of listeners. He had already explored a similar theme in the 1975 Tai Phong song \"Going Away\" (where the protagonist is alone), and would again in his 1997 song \"On ira\" (which is sung from the perspective of a man to an unnamed woman). In an interview, Goldman pointed out that the latter song made direct reference to \"L\u00e0-bas\" by borrowing a line from it : \"Ici tout est jou\u00e9 d'avance\", meaning \"Here everything is set from the beginning\", became \"M\u00eame si tout est jou\u00e9 d'avance\", meaning \"Even if everything is set from the beginning\" (suggesting this time that the male protagonist, presumably more mature and fatalist, and in a reversed socio-economic context, i.e. living in a rich country and longing for a more meaningful life outside of his suffocating comfort, is aware that there is not much to be gained \"out there\" but still has the urge to go anyway; and this time he is the one begging for the woman to go with him, as it doesn't make sense for him to go alone).Week-end Jean-Jacques Goldman, Nostalgie, 26\u201327 September 1997 ==Chart performances== In France, the song charted for 21 weeks on the top 50, from 5 December 1987 to 23 April 1988. It entered at number 17 and reached the top ten three weeks later. It peaked at number two for five non consecutive weeks, but was unable to dislodge Guesch Patti's \"\u00c9tienne\", then Sabrina's \"Boys (Summertime Love)\" which topped the chart then. After 12 weeks in the top ten, the single dropped on the chart. It achieved Gold status awarded by the Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique in 1988. The song sold about 593,000 units and is the 402nd best-selling single of all time in France. ==Cover versions== The song was covered by many artists throughout the years, including Michel Delpech in 1996, Murray Head and Lio, Corey Hart and Julie Masse in 1998, Renaud Hantson and Nourith, Michel Leclerc (instrumental version) in 2000, Florent Pagny and Natasha St-Pier in 2002 (available on St-Pier's album De l'amour le mieux), Philippe Heuvelinne and Marc Rouv\u00e9 in 2003, Humana, Prise 2 Son (released as a single, the second track of the CD \"Un Autre Monde, number 45 in France) in 2004, Opium du Peuple, and Gr\u00e9gory Lemarchal and the 500 choristers in 2007 (available on his posthumous album La Voix d'un ange). All these versions were recorded on an album or a single. Jean-Jacques Goldman re-recorded the song as a duet with C\u00e9line Dion for the Les Enfoir\u00e9s' 1996 album La Compil'. In 1992, he performed the song with Carole Fredericks and Michael Jones for the live album Sur sc\u00e8ne. The song was performed on several French TV programmes, such as Tapis Rouge \u00e0 Notre-Dame de Paris (France 2, 15 April 2000) by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne S\u00e9gara and Bruno Pelletier, Tubes d'un jour, tubes de toujours (TF1, 27 December 2002) by Daniel L\u00e9vi and C\u00e9cilia Cara. The song was also performed in Dutch-language by Erik Mesie and Nadieh under the title \"Ik sta\". In 2012, Marie-Mai and Baptiste Giabiconi covered the song on the number one album G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Goldman. Jean-Jacques Goldman and Michael Jones made an English version of the song called \"On my way home\" interpreted by Joe Cocker (album No ordinary world). As often with English translations of French songs in general (as examplified by \"My Way\", based on Claude Fran\u00e7ois' \"Comme d'habitude\", or \"Only The Very Best\" from Tycoon, based on Starmania's \"SOS d'un terrien en d\u00e9tresse\"), and Goldman songs in particular, the lyrics are not a literal translation of the original (on my way home versus leaving) but remain true to the overall theme (tribulation). ==Formats and track listings== * 7\" single # \"L\u00e0-bas \u2014 4:46 # \"\u00c0 quoi tu sers ?\" \u2014 5:29 * 12\" maxi # \"L\u00e0-bas\" (extended version) \u2014 6:08 # \"\u00c0 quoi tu sers ?\" (vocal) \u2014 5:29 * CD single # \"L\u00e0-bas \u2014 4:46 # \"\u00c0 quoi tu sers ?\" \u2014 5:29 # \"Entre gris clair et gris fonc\u00e9\" \u2014 7:19 ==Charts and certifications== ===Peak positions=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1987/88) !Peak position |- |French SNEP Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|2 |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1988) !Peak position |- |Europe (European Hot 100 Singles) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|56 |- |} ===Certifications=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Country !Certification !Date !Sales certified !Physical sales |- |France |align=\"center\"|Gold |align=\"center\"|1988 |align=\"center\"|500,000 |align=\"center\"|593,000 |- |} ==References== Category:1987 singles Category:Jean-Jacques Goldman songs Category:Pop ballads Category:Male\u2013female vocal duets Category:Songs written by Jean-Jacques Goldman Category:Baptiste Giabiconi songs ",
