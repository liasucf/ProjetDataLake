    "text": "New York City is an album by The Peter Malick Group featuring Norah Jones. The album was recorded during August and September 2000, a few weeks before Jones made her own demos for Blue Note Records, and released three years later. Jones sings on all seven tracks, and this album is more bluesy than Jones' debut album, Come Away with Me. One of the tracks of the album, \"Strange Transmissions\", was bundled with the Nokia 6230 mobile phone. The album reached number fifty-four on the Billboard 200, number one on Top Blues Albums, and number two on Top Independent Albums. The Bastone & Burnz remix of \"Strange Transmissions\" peaked at number twenty-three on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 2004. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits for New York City adapted from album liner notes. * Peter Malick \u2013 guitars (1-7), vocals (6), producer * Norah Jones \u2013 vocals (1-7), piano (5) * Ducky Carlisle \u2013 engineer, mixing * Jeff Chenaul \u2013 art direction, design * Nate Dub\u00e9 \u2013 engineer * Hugh Fordin \u2013 executive producer * Eric Gardner \u2013 drums (1, 4, 5, 7) * Danny McGouch \u2013 keyboards: Melotron (1, 7), Hammond B-3 (3), Wurlitzer piano (4) * Marty Richards \u2013 drums (2, 3, 6) * Mike Thompson \u2013 accordion (1, 7), piano (2, 4) * Jeff Turmes \u2013 bass (1-7) * Tom West \u2013 piano (6) * Bruce Witkin \u2013 engineer ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2003\u201304) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|22 |- !scope=\"row\"|Austrian Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|28 |- !scope=\"row\"|Danish Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|30 |- !scope=\"row\"|Dutch Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|32 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|18 |- !scope=\"row\"|Polish Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|42 |- !scope=\"row\"|Swiss Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|93 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|80 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200 |align=\"center\"|54 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Top Blues Albums |align=\"center\"|1 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Top Independent Albums |align=\"center\"|2 |} ==References== Category:2003 albums Category:E1 Music albums Category:Norah Jones albums ",
