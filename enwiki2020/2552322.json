Eleven feet of river sediment at the site provides a stratigraphy that suggests more than 10,000 years of nearly constant occupation by American Indians, potentially pre-dating the Clovis culture and contributing to the knowledge of the Dalton and San Patrice cultures. ==See also== *List of rivers of Missouri ==References== == External links == *The Big Eddy Site, from the Center for Archeological Research at Missouri State University Category:Rivers of Missouri Category:Bodies of water of the Ozarks Category:Rivers of Cedar County, Missouri Category:Rivers of Dade County, Missouri Category:Rivers of Greene County, Missouri Category:Rivers of Lawrence County, Missouri Category:Rivers of St. Clair County, Missouri Category:Tributaries of the Missouri River ",
