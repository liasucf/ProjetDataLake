    "text": "Brown Moor is an area in the metropolitan borough of the City of Leeds in West Yorkshire, England, east of Austhorpe and north of Colton Common. The M1 motorway and the A63 road pass it on its eastern flank and the A6120 road in the south. The area is named after a nearby hill. A colliery operated here in the 19th century and was accessed by a spur off the Leeds and Selby Railway, but was already disused in the early 20th century. At that time, some cottages had been erected nearby. Those had been sold by 2002 when Thorpe Park Business Park was established in the area. A length of Grim's Ditch is preserved underground north of Barrowby Lane and to the west of the former farmstead and is a scheduled monument.
