Other responses were less laudatory; in a review on Den of Geek, David Crow wrote: \"King tries her hardest to keep the movie afloat. She believably portrays a woman haunted by a past mistake that she wants to make amends for. However, her talent is wasted in a movie that only uses her as a bridge between set pieces\". ==References== ==External links== * Aubrey Bradimore on IMDb Category:Fictional American police detectives Category:Fictional characters from Wisconsin Category:Film characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional female detectives Category:Final girls Category:Silent Night, Deadly Night (film series) ",
