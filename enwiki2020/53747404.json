    "text": "The 2017 Tercera Divisi\u00f3n play-offs to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B from Tercera Divisi\u00f3n (Promotion play-offs) were the final playoffs for the promotion from 2016\u201317 Tercera Divisi\u00f3n to 2017\u201318 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. The first four teams in each group took part in the play-off. ==Format== The eighteen group winners have the opportunity to be promoted directly to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. The eighteen group winners were drawn into a two-legged series where the nine winners will promote to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. The nine losing clubs will enter the play-off round for the last nine promotion spots. The eighteen runners-up were drawn against one of the eighteen fourth-placed clubs outside their group and the eighteen third-placed clubs were drawn against one another in a two- legged series. The twenty-seven winners will advance with the nine losing clubs from the champions' series to determine the eighteen teams that will enter the last two-legged series for the last nine promotion spots. In all the playoff series, the lower-ranked club play at home first. Whenever there is a tie in position (e.g. like the group winners in the champions' series or the third-placed teams in the first round), a draw determines the club to play at home first. == Group Winners Promotion Play-off == === Qualified teams === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Team |- !1 |Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a B |- !2 |Sporting Gij\u00f3n B |- !3 |Gimn\u00e1stica Torrelavega |- !4 |Alav\u00e9s B |- !5 |Olot |- !6 |Ol\u00edmpic |- !7 |Atl\u00e9tico Madrid B |- !8 |Gimn\u00e1stica Segoviana |- !9 |Atl\u00e9tico Malague\u00f1o |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Group !Team |- !10 |Real Betis B |- !11 |Formentera |- !12 |Las Palmas Atl\u00e9tico |- !13 |Lorca Deportiva |- !14 |Cacere\u00f1o |- !15 |Pe\u00f1a Sport |- !16 |Calahorra |- !17 |Deportivo Arag\u00f3n |- !18 |Talavera de la Reina |} ===Matches=== |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center; margin: 0 auto;\" |- !colspan=\"9\"|Promoted to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B |- |Atl.
