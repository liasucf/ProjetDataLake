She is married to Juan Guaid\u00f3, president of the National Assembly and a claimant to the country's acting presidency in the Venezuelan presidential crisis. She is considered by the White House and the National Assembly of Venezuela as the first lady of Venezuela. Also available online at AP News == Early life and education == Rosales was born in the town of Tovar, M\u00e9rida State, on 22 April 1992. Her father, Carlos, was a farmer, and her mother a journalist. As a child, she observed her mother's interviews and became interested in social issues. She assisted in running the family farm and decided to study journalism. Her father died after having a heart attack in 2013, for which she blames the shortages in Venezuela; she says \"there was no medicine in his village to stabilize him, and no ambulance to take him to the nearest hospital\". Her cousin died similarly, because products for a blood transfusion could not be found. In 2013, she graduated from Universidad Rafael Belloso Chac\u00edn with a degree in journalism and social communications. She worked in M\u00e9rida state for a city council as a press officer, and later held a similar position after moving to Caracas. She met Juan Guaid\u00f3 at a youth rally, and they married in 2013. They have a daughter who was born in 2017. == Political activism == Rosales with Guaid\u00f3 at a protest in February 2019 During her university studies, Rosales began working for the opposition party Popular Will (). As a human rights activist, she had close to 150,000 followers on Instagram as of 26 January 2019. She has stated that a motivating factor for her is that she does not \"want [her] daughter to grow up wanting to leave Venezuela\", and that she is \"working for [her] daughter to inherit a better country\". During the Venezuelan presidential crisis, Guaid\u00f3 was designated acting president by the Venezuelan National Assembly, contesting the legitimacy of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. More than 50 governments have recognized Guaid\u00f3 as the acting president of Venezuela, which implicitly gives Rosales a claim to being the First Lady of Venezuela. She told Reuters that spies and \"pro- government armed groups\" follow her and Guaid\u00f3. === Foreign relations === The New York Times says Rosales is \"emerging as a prominent figure in [Guaid\u00f3's] campaign to bring change to the crisis-wracked country\". She has assumed the role of international ambassador for the opposition, meeting with Bolivarian diaspora and regional leaders to solicit support for the opposition and her country. Rosales started in Latin America, meeting with Mart\u00edn Vizcarra and Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, presidents of Peru and Chile respectively, in March 2019. Rosales with Trump On 27 March, she visited the White House to meet with US President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. She said that the crisis in Venezuela is serious, describing it as \"freedom or dictatorship, life or death\". Trump said it was a \"great honor to have the first lady of Venezuela\". From Washington, D.C., she went next to a meeting with Miami mayor Carlos A. Gim\u00e9nez, where she was given the key to Miami-Dade County. The Associated Press wrote that her \"opponents have cast her recent tour as a desperate attempt to keep Guaido in the international spotlight\", and quoted a diplomat from the Maduro administration, who said, \"She is trying to boost Guaido's image, as support for his movement in Venezuela deflates\". == References == == External links == * * Category:1992 births Category:21st-century Venezuelan women writers Category:First Ladies of Venezuela Category:Living people Category:People from Tovar, M\u00e9rida Category:People of the Crisis in Venezuela Category:Popular Will politicians Category:Venezuelan women in politics Category:Venezuelan women journalists ",
