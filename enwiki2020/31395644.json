Another test transmission was made by Antonio Pereyra from the Bolivar Hotel on May 28, 1954. On January 17, 1958, the Ministry of Education and UNESCO inaugurated the State Channel 7 and conducted a test broadcast.Resumen de Historia: Los 51 a\u00f1os de la televisi\u00f3n peruana The first commercial television broadcast was on Channel 4 Radio Am\u00e9rica in Lima, on December 15, 1958 by Nicanor Gonz\u00e1lez and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Umbert. Channel 4 Radio America's creation was possible because of an agreement with NBC and RCA. Several commercial television stations followed, including Channel 2 (Radiodifusora Victoria S.A.), Channel 13 \u2014 later changed to Channel 5 (Panamericana Televisi\u00f3n S.A.), Channel 9 (Compa\u00f1\u00eda Peruana de Producciones Radiales y TV), Channel 11 (Bego Televisi\u00f3n S.A.). Many of them soon acquired \u2014 or were associated with \u2014 stations outside Metropolitan Lima. In just two months, November and December 1959, Lima stores recorded sales of 10,000 television sets, and full page ads in newspapers and magazines announced the start of the era of television in Peru. By April 1960, there were 55,000 television sets operating in the Peruvian capital. The growth was explosive, considering the fact that in 1958 there were only 5,000 televisions. == Digital television == On March 30, 2010, Peru starts digital television transition, with TV Per\u00fa being the first television station to begin broadcast digitally.
