In the 1840s\u2013'50s, parts of the area were settled by Africans rescued by the Royal Navy from illegal slaving ships. In the 1880s\u2013'90s, the population swelled rapidly, and the characteristic Belmont street pattern of narrow, winding lanes developed. The black professional class built large homes in Belmont, as they were excluded from the more expensive neighbourhoods such as St. Clair and Maraval; Belmont became known as \"the Black St. Clair\". Many of these large homes have been renovated and converted to business use, but some remain in family hands. Belmont currently is a lower-middle to middle-class residential neighbourhood. It was the birthplace and early home of many important Carnival designers and bandleaders. Belmont has 9,035 inhabitants.Census 2011 ==Buildings in Belmont== One of the more recent renovations in Belmont which was done with a view to preserving the historic character of the building is Myler House.
