It is situated in Chuo-ku, Kobe, at the foot of the mountain stream Nunohiki and waterfall of the same name. In 2006 with the modernization of water resources and water supply, the dam was designated as important heritage site. ==History== The modern water supply plan in Japan was originally drawn up in 1887 but in 1892, Professor William Barton from the British Ministry of Engineering proposed an earth-fill dam with a reservoir capacity of about 31 million tons. Construction began in 1897 and it was completed in 1900. In 2005, the dam was partly reconstructed to incorporate seismic strengthening and sediment dredging was completed. ==Gallery== File:Nunobiki dam05s5s4272.jpg| File:Nunobiki dam02s3200.jpg| File:Nunobiki dam04s3200.jpg| File:Nunobiki dam03s3200.jpg| File:Nunobiki Reservoir - NW.jpg| File:Nunobiki_Reservoir_-_S.jpg| Category:Dams in Hyogo Prefecture Category:Dams completed in 1900 Category:Buildings of the Meiji period Category:Important Cultural Properties of Japan ",
