Kuravanji poems are used in famous dance forms like Bharatanatyam where dancers perform the roles of Kurathi and other characters as depicted in the poetry with recitations of the poems with music. == Author == This book, popularly known as Kuravanchi Natakam, was composed by Trikutarasabba Kavirayar, a courtier of the northern king Chinnananjath Thevar. He hails from Melakaram near Tenkasi in Tirunelveli district (he is the brother of Subramania Desikar, the Adinath leader of Thiruvaduthurai). The book, which was staged in the presence of Thirukurtalanadar, received the praise and prize of the then King of Madurai, Muthuvijaranga Sokkanatha Nayak. == Structure == The book manages to entertain as well as inform. Katiyankaran foretells the Thiruvala uprising of Courtallam. Thiruvala begins Three Tamils are strolling on Courtallam Nadar Road to chant the four verses. Women are getting up to see Courtallam Nadar Thiruvala. Vasanthavalli (storyteller) who was swinging the ball at that time is also coming to Thiruvalakkana. Vasanthavalli, who knows about the Lord through her friend, sends her friend in love with the Lord. In this case, the tagger is coming down the street. When the friend calls to tag her, the girl picks up on her native mountains and her career. Then Vasanthavalli looks at her hand and tells her the news of Courtallanadar's love and the (leader's) reputation of Courtalanathar. Her husband's leader is looking to see her. The two enjoy singing to the culprit to tell what happened to the leader who witnessed the crime. Thus ends the story == Features == Kuravansi Kuravansi is one of the most acclaimed texts and is still performed on stage today as a dance drama. Although he wrote Talapuranam, Malai, Siladai, Pillai Tamil, Yamakaanthadi etc. on the Trikutarasapakkavirayar Courtallam, his Kuravanchi is the only one that many people like to read today. Kutralakkuravansi got the name Thirukkuralakkuravansi because it was sung against the Lord. Filled with drama, the book is full of melodic and imaginative songs. == Period == One of the songs in the book states that Chinnanan Sathevan narrated the story of the passing away of the Pandya king Courtalanathar in the year 887 in Kollam. Kollam 824 + 887 = 1711 This book refers to the 18th century. Category:Tamil poetics ",
