    "text": "The nipsistiarios () was a Byzantine court position and rank reserved for eunuchs. The office is first attested in a 7th-century seal, but was abandoned well before the 14th century, since it is not mentioned in the Book of Offices of pseudo-Kodinos.. As his name shows (from Greek \u03bd\u03af\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \"to wash hands\"), the nipsistiarios was tasked with holding a gold, gem-encrusted water basin and assisting the Byzantine emperor in performing the ritual ablutions before he exited the imperial palace or performed ceremonies. According to the Kl\u0113torologion of 899, his insigne of office was a kamision (tunic) embroidered with the figure of a basin in purple.. In the Kl\u0113torologion, he ranks as the lowest in the hierarchy of the specifically eunuch dignities, below the koubikoularios, but in the 10th century, there is a reference to the eunuch Samonas being promoted from koubikoularios to nipsistiarios. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:Byzantine court titles Category:Byzantine palace offices Category:Byzantine titles and offices reserved for eunuchs ",
