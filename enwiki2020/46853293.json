Fungie (), also known as the Dingle Dolphin, Cutie little dolphin is a male common bottlenose dolphin who is known to live in very close contact with humans in Dingle, Ireland. Wild bottlenose dolphins are estimated to have a median lifespan between 8.3 and 17.4 years, while one bottlenose dolphin has been observed to live for at least 67 years. According to locals, Fungie was first seen in Dingle harbour in 1983, and continues to seek out human contact over thirty years later. Thus, Fungie is fully grown, and likely already in his middle or even old age. Fungie is known to interact playfully with swimmers, surfers, kayakers and divers in the water. There have not been any recorded cases of Fungie being aggressive towards humans. Although it is normal for social animals like dolphins to live in close contact with each other, it is still a rare occurrence for them to seek out human contact, and Fungie is the first recorded occurrence of a dolphin interacting positively with humans in the wild in Ireland. Fungie has been observed eating garfish, something not previously known to be eaten by dolphins. In October 2020 there was concern for his welfare after he had not been seen for several days. ==References== ==External links== * A Dolphin Has Been Living Solo In This Irish Harbor For Decades - Smithsonian Category:Dingle Category:Individual dolphins Category:Solitary dolphins Category:Individual animals in Ireland Category:Tourist attractions in County Kerry ",
