    "text": "Molly Tanzer (born October 29, 1981) is an American fantasy, horror, and science fiction writer. She has been nominated for the Locus Award, British Fantasy Award, and the Wonderland Book Award. She is known for genre-bending fiction that combines horror and fantasy with strong female protagonists, depth of characterization, and realistic interpersonal relationships. == Early life and education == Tanzer was born in Marietta, Georgia. She moved to West Palm Beach Florida when she was 12. She studied Art History at Rollins College, and received a Master's in Humanities from Florida State University, with a focus on 18th-century novels written by women about the transatlantic slave trade. == Style and themes == Tanzer's books often combine elements of multiple genres including horror, fantasy, science fiction, realism, and comedy. She frequently sets her books in alternate historical settings, in which she incorporates people of color, LGBTQIA characters, and strong female protagonists. Tanzer has stated that she strives for inclusivity in her works and that she is especially interested in the \"queering of history.\" Tanzer has been noted for the strong characterizations in her novels, complex relationships, as well as sharp and witty dialogue. Women's relationships are a prominent part of Tanzer's novels, which frequently include more than one female protagonist. Her novels often have \"slow-burn\" pacing with a longer build up that eventually gives way to action. == Awards == === Nominations === * Locus Award, Best Fantasy Novel 2018 (Creatures of Want and Ruin) *British Fantasy Award, Sydney J.
