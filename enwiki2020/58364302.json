The law also foresees subsidies also for private higher education institutions. It is intended to give underprivileged Filipino students a chance to earn a college degree.

The law was filed first by senator Ralph Recto, principally sponsored by Senator Bam Aquino, and was signed by Rodrigo Duterte, President of the Philippines, on August 3, 2017. The bill is supported by almost all members of Congress In September 2017, the chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations announced that P40 billion had been gathered and that this amount would finance all expenses foreseen by the law for 2018. On March 26, 2018, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) released the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) pertaining to the Act. Before the signing of the bill by the President, the government took the view after intense political discussions that \"the long-term benefits that will be derived from a well-developed tertiary education on the part of the citizenry will definitely outweigh any short-term budgetary challenges\". The government also stated that the \"bottom 20 percent\" was to have priority concerning the allocation of subsidies for educational-related expenses. == Requirements and benefits == To continuously benefit from the law, students must meet all the admission and retention requirements. That is, they need to pass the admission and retention requirements of the universities, which includes finishing their degree on time and enrolling in the required number of units per year. Persons who have already obtained a bachelor's degree or comparable undergraduate degree from any public or private higher education institution are not eligible for free education.Implementing Rules and Regulations, Rule II, Section 6: Exceptions to Free HE.

For those enrolled in technical-vocational schools, further fees are exempted, including the cost of utilities, facilities, equipment and tools maintenance, as well as the honoraria of trainers.
