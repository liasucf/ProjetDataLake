    "text": "The Andorra national football team () represents Andorra in association football and is controlled by the Andorran Football Federation, the governing body for football in Andorra. The team has enjoyed very little success due to the Principality's tiny population, the fifth smallest of any UEFA country (only Liechtenstein, San Marino, Gibraltar and the Faroe Islands are smaller). Andorra's first official game was a 6\u20131 defeat in a friendly match to Estonia in 1996. Since the qualifying rounds for the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament, Andorra have competed in qualifying for every European Championship and World Cup but have had very little success. They have only ever won six matches, four of them at home. They have three wins in competitive matches, 1\u20130 wins against Macedonia in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition; Hungary in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition; and Moldova in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying competition. ==History== Though the Andorran Football Federation formed in 1994, and the domestic league started in 1995, the national team could not participate in major championships until it gained affiliation with governing bodies FIFA and UEFA in 1996. The national team played its first match against Estonia in Andorra La Vella and lost 6\u20131. Andorra's first match in a FIFA-sanctioned competition was a 3\u20131 loss to Armenia on 5 September 1998 in a qualifier for UEFA Euro 2000. Andorra lost all ten qualifiers for the tournament. The team particularly struggled in away matches; each loss was by at least three goals. Andorra scored only three goals, two of which were penalties, and two of which were in the away matches. Andorra conceded 28 goals, and their biggest defeat of the qualifiers was a 6\u20131 away loss to Russia. For their first World Cup qualifying campaign, Andorra were drawn in a group with Cyprus, Estonia, Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal. They lost their opening match 1\u20130 to Estonia. In the next game, they lost 3\u20132 to Cyprus but scored their first World Cup qualifying goals. They were again defeated by Estonia, this time 2\u20131. They lost all their matches and their only away goal was in a 3\u20131 loss against Ireland. Their worst defeat was 7\u20131 to Portugal on a neutral ground in Lleida, Spain. Andorra finished the campaign with no points and conceded 36 goals in ten matches. In the team's qualification campaign for Euro 2004 they again lost every game. They scored their only goal in a 2\u20131 away loss to Bulgaria. In this competition the scores were closer than before as they lost 3\u20130 to Bulgaria, Croatia and Belgium, 2\u20130 twice to Estonia, 2\u20130 to Croatia and 1\u20130 to Belgium. Ukraine in 2009. By Andorran standards, qualification for the 2006 World Cup was successful. They won their first competitive game 1\u20130 at home against Macedonia. Andorra midfielder Marc Bernaus, who played in the Spanish second division, received a long throw in off his chest and volleyed in a goal early in the second half. After the game, Macedonia coach Dragan Kanatlarovski resigned and called the game \"a shameful outcome, a humiliation.\" Andorra also drew two matches, 0\u20130 in Macedonia and 0\u20130 at home against Finland. In Euro 2008 qualifying, Andorra again lost every game. The closest game was against Russia, a 1\u20130 defeat on 21 November 2007. Their biggest defeat was a 7\u20130 loss to Croatia in Andorra La Vella, which is their worst defeat in UEFA competitions and matched their loss to the Czech Republic as their largest losing deficit. Andorra scored only two goals and conceded 42 in a total of 12 games. In 2010 World Cup qualifying, Andorra lost all ten matches. For the tournament, they scored three goals, in defeats to Belarus and Kazakhstan, and conceded 39 goals, including six in a defeat to England, the largest margin in the group. Qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012 ended in familiar fashion; they lost all ten matches, scoring only one goal and conceding 25; their best results were two one-goal losses to Slovakia and a 3\u20131 loss in Ireland. The 2014 World Cup qualifying tournament was even more disastrous. Andorra lost all their matches while conceding 30 goals and not scoring. Israel in 2015. During 2016 UEFA Euro qualifying, Andorra again lost all of its ten games but scored four goals, setting a national team record for goals scored in a European Championship qualifying group. On 22 February 2017, Andorra beat San Marino away 2\u20130 in a friendly match, ending with 12 years and 132 days without winning any match. On 9 June 2017, Andorra beat Hungary 1\u20130 in a World Cup home qualifier with a goal by Marc Reb\u00e9s, their first victory in a competitive match since 2004. Thanks to these two wins and a draw against the Faroe Islands on 6 July 2017, Andorra progressed 57 positions in the FIFA rankings to 129th, its second best position ever. On 21 March 2018, Reb\u00e9s scored the only goal of a friendly win over Liechtenstein in Spain, giving Andorra their third victory of the last 13 months and sixth of all time. In 2018, Andorra made its debut in the newly created UEFA Nations League. They played in Group 1 of League D, where they finished at the bottom of the group with four ties and two losses, finishing unbeaten at home. On 11 October 2019, Andorra won 1\u20130 against Moldova in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying competition, thus ending a 56-match winless run in Euro qualifiers. One month later, the team earned one more point after an away draw against Albania, thus avoiding for the first time to end a qualifying round in the last position. ==Stadium== Andorra's former home stadium, Estadi Comunal d'Andorra la Vella. From 1996 until 2014, Andorra played their home matches at the Comunal d'Andorra la Vella, in the capital city of Andorra la Vella. This stadium has a capacity of 1,800 and also hosts the matches of club sides FC Andorra and the Andorran Premier League. On 9 September 2014, the national team began playing at the new Estadi Nacional with a capacity of 3,306. Andorra have occasionally played home matches outside their borders. For example, Andorra hosted France and England in the 2000 European Championship, 2008 European Championship and 2010 World Cup qualifiers in the Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys in Barcelona, which was the home of RCD Espanyol between 1997 and 2009. ==Kit suppliers== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The nation has only won three competitive fixtures, World Cup qualifying matches against Macedonia in 2004 and Hungary in 2017, both by 1\u20130; a European Championship qualifying match against Moldova in 2019, by the same score; and three friendly games against Belarus and Albania at home and San Marino away, all of them by 2\u20130. With the fourth smallest population of any UEFA country, until the admission of Gibraltar, the talent pool is small. Players are predominantly amateurs because the Andorra domestic league is only part-time. Since Andorra began playing in 1996, their average FIFA ranking is 163. ==Manager history== Koldo. Manuel Miluir was the first coach of the team and managed their first three matches of European Championship qualifying. He departed in 1999 to make way for David Rodrigo, whose first competitive match was a 2\u20130 European Championship qualifying defeat at home to Iceland on 27 March of that year. Rodrigo had been in charge of the team until February 2010, when it was announced that Koldo would take over this role. * Isidre Codina (1996) * Manuel Miluir (1997\u20131999) * David Rodrigo (1999\u20132009) * Koldo \u00c1lvarez de Eulate (2010\u2013) ==Competition records== ===FIFA World Cup record=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !colspan=9|FIFA World Cup record !
