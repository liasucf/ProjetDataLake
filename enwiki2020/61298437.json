The construction of Fundaci\u00f3n Biblioteca Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Col\u00f3n at this two sites preserved as much as possible the history of both structures. The corner lot was first owned by Juan de Dios Conde, a two-time mayor of Ponce in 1836 and 1839. Some 30 years later, in 1872, a new two-story structure was built which became, three years later, Hospital Militar Espa\u00f1ol de Ponce. In 1896, Gaspar Bonn\u00edn y Mir\u00f3, a businessman from Mallorca, Spain, bought the property, as the Hospital moved to a new and more spacious building elsewhere in the city. In 1898 the structure was taken over by the US Army, upon its invasion of Puerto Rico in July of that year. Eventually the property was acquired by the government of Puerto Rico, and a new building was erected at this corner lot to serve as the site of the Puerto Rico Criminal Courthouse for the District of Ponce.Apuesta hist\u00f3rica y contempor\u00e1nea en el casco urbano de Ponce.

Much of this building was built from scratch, to provide all the modern services needed by a library-museum, including the electrical room, elevator, offices, rest rooms, and all other support facilities required so that the older historic building to its north would be impacted the least. Perhaps most importantly, a seamless transition from this mostly-rebuilt building to the historic building to the north was achieved via halls that make possible the passage from one building to the other.Apuesta hist\u00f3rica y contempor\u00e1nea en el casco urbano de Ponce.
