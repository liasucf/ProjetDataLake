Silk commanded the weapons platoon of Company E, 398th > Infantry, on 23 November 1944, when the end battalion was assigned the > mission of seizing high ground overlooking Moyenmoutier, France, prior to an > attack on the city itself. His company jumped off in the lead at dawn and by > noon had reached the edge of a woods in the vicinity of St. Pravel where > scouts saw an enemy sentry standing guard before a farmhouse in a valley > below. One squad, engaged in reconnoitering the area, was immediately pinned > down by intense machinegun and automatic-weapons fire from within the house. > Skillfully deploying his light machinegun section, 1st Lt. Silk answered > enemy fire, but when 15 minutes had elapsed with no slackening of > resistance, he decided to eliminate the strong point by a one-man attack. > Running 100 yards across an open field to the shelter of a low stone wall > directly in front of the farmhouse, he fired into the door and windows with > his carbine; then, in full view of the enemy, vaulted the wall and dashed 50 > yards through a hail of bullets to the left side of the house, where he > hurled a grenade through a window, silencing a machinegun and killing 2 > gunners. In attempting to move to the right side of the house he drew fire > from a second machinegun emplaced in the woodshed. With magnificent courage > he rushed this position in the face of direct fire and succeeded in > neutralizing the weapon and killing the 2 gunners by throwing grenades into > the structure. His supply of grenades was by now exhausted, but undaunted, > he dashed back to the side of the farmhouse and began to throw rocks through > a window, demanding the surrender of the remaining enemy. Twelve Germans, > overcome by his relentless assault and confused by his unorthodox methods, > gave up to the lone American. By his gallant willingness to assume the full > burden of the attack and the intrepidity with which he carried out his > extremely hazardous mission, 1st Lt. Silk enabled his battalion to continue > its advance and seize its objective. ==See also== *List of Medal of Honor recipients ==References== * * Category:1916 births Category:1955 deaths Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:United States Army Medal of Honor recipients Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Category:People from Johnstown, Pennsylvania Category:United States Army colonels Category:World War II recipients of the Medal of Honor ",
