    "text": "The John von Neumann Lecture Prize was established in 1959 with funds from IBM and other industry corporations, and is awarded for \"outstanding and distinguished contributions to the field of applied mathematical sciences and for the effective communication of these ideas to the community\". It is considered the highest honor bestowed by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). The recipient receives a monetary award and presents a survey lecture at the SIAM Annual Meeting. ==Selection process== Anybody is able to nominate a mathematician for the prize. Nominations are reviewed by a selection committee, consisting of members of SIAM who serve two-year appointments. The committee selects one recipient for the prize nine months before the SIAM Annual Meeting and forwards their nomination to SIAM's Executive Committee and Vice President for Programs. ==Past lecturers== *1960: Lars Valerian Ahlfors *1961: Mark Kac *1962: Jean Leray *1963: Stanislaw M.
