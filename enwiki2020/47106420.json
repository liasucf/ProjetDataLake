    "text": "Guyana competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was the nation's seventeenth appearance at the Summer Olympics as an independent state, although it had previously represented in five other editions (1948 to 1964) under the name British Guiana. Guyana joined the African-led boycott of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Guyana Olympic Association sent a team of six athletes, three per gender, to compete only in track and field and swimming at the Games, matching its roster size (one sport less) with London 2012. Track sprinter Winston George was the only Guyanese athlete to have represented at the previous Games, with the rest of the field making their Olympic debut in Rio de Janeiro. Other notable athletes also featured world-ranked triple jumper Troy Doris and 19-year-old butterfly swimmer Hannibal Gaskin, who eventually led the team by carrying the Guyanese flag at the opening ceremony. Guyana, however, failed to win its first Olympic medal, since the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, where Michael Anthony took the bronze in men's bantamweight boxing. Unable to end his nation's 36-year drought on the podium, Doris produced a best result for Guyana at these Games, finishing seventh in the men's triple jump final. ==Athletics (track and field)== Guyanese athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event): ;Track & road events {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Quarterfinal !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Winston George |align=left|Men's 400 m |45.77 |5 |colspan=2 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Brenessa Thompson |align=left|Women's 100 m |colspan=2 |11.72 |7 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|Women's 200 m |23.65 |7 |colspan=2 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|Aliyah Abrams |align=left|Women's 400 m |52.79 |5 |colspan=2 |colspan=4|Did not advance |} ;Field events {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Qualification !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Distance !Position !Distance !Position |-align=center |align=left|Troy Doris |align=left|Men's triple jump |16.81 |4 q |16.90 |7 |} ==Swimming== Guyana has received a Universality invitation from FINA to send two swimmers (one male and one female) to the Olympics. {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font- size:95%\" !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Hannibal Gaskin |align=left|Men's 100 m butterfly |58.57 |42 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|Jamila Sanmoogan |align=left|Women's 50 m freestyle |28.88 |63 |colspan=4|Did not advance |} ==See also== *Guyana at the 2015 Pan American Games ==References== == External links == * Category:Nations at the 2016 Summer Olympics 2016 Olymp ",
