It is a monster that has traditionally been popular throughout the country. It also has been called Gangcheol (Hangul: \uac15\ucca0), Kkangcheol (Hangul: \uae61\ucca0), and Ggoangcheol (Hangul: \uaf5d\ucca0). One of the earliest records of Gangcheori being mentioned is the \"Jibong Yu- seol\" (1614). In those days, there was an old saying, \"Where Gangcheori goes is like spring even it is fall.\" When author Lee Soo-kwang asked an old man in the countryside about the origin of the word, the old man told him about a monster called Gangcheori that burns down everything in a few miles. == References == Category:Korean legendary creatures Category:Mythological monsters Category:Mythology stubs Category:Dragons ",
