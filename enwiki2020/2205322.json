Combi made his debut as the Italian captain in his 33rd game on 15 November 1931. === The 1934 World Cup === Combi (left) as Italian goalkeeper and captain in the 1934 World Cup, here with his Spanish colleague Ricardo Zamora in the Quarter-finals. Around the beginning of 1934, 31-year-old Gianpiero Combi was preparing to retire from football. In this season he was on the way to winning his fifth Italian championship (a record fourth in a row) with Juventus and he had played more than 40 games for the national team. A new promising young goalkeeper was emerging: Carlo Ceresoli, who played for Inter. On his debut Ceresoli had helped the national team to qualify for the 1934 World Cup which was held in Italy that summer, by eliminating Greece in Milano by a 4\u20130 win. But the National Coach Vittorio Pozzo included Combi in the Italian squad - he was also one of the Nazio-Juve members - and was asked by Pozzo to postpone his retirement until the end of the tournament as his experience might be a great help. During a training session a few weeks before the beginning of the tournament, a shot by Pietro Arcari broke one of Ceresoli's forearms. This forced him to miss the World Cup and Combi again found himself the top goalkeeper in Italy, with the responsibility of leading the Azzurri to their debut in football's premier competition. The first match was on 27 May 1934 when Italy played the first round of the World Cup in the Stadio Nazionale of the P.N.F. in Rome against the United States. The Azzurri beat their opponents 7\u20131, a victory provided by a hat trick from Angelo Schiavio, a double from Raimundo Orsi and a goal each from Giovanni Ferrari and Meazza. In the Quarter-finals the Italians met Spain, who were led by another great goalkeeper of the time, Ricardo Zamora. The game was played on 31 May 1934 in the Stadio Comunale \"Giovanni Berta\" of Florence. The game against the Spanish team was a very difficult one, dominated by the speed and force used by both teams and finished in a 1\u20131 draw after extra time. A replay had to be played the next day, in which Italy changed four players and Spain seven. Italy won 1\u20130 with a goal by Meazza. Pozzo, Monzeglio, Bertolini, Combi, Monti (half-hidden) and the assistant manager Carcano (behind) before the start of extra time in the victorius final versus Czechoslovakia. Their semi-final opponents were the Austrian Wunderteam, the squad who had beaten the Italians 4\u20132 in Turin four months earlier. The match was played in Milano's Stadio Calcistico San Siro on 3 June and the Azzurri won 1\u20130 with a goal by Enrico Guaita. Combi was also decisive when he made two miraculous saves to keep the score in favor of Italy until the end. The final was held in Rome on 10 June 1934 against Czechoslovakia. The first half finished without a goal but in the 71st minute, against all odds, Antonin Pu\u010d managed to beat the Italian goalkeeper. Ten minutes later Orsi equalized and the game went to extra-time. With the help of a noisy support, so great that the rival coach Pozzo had to continually run along the pitch so that the players could hear his instructions, Italy won the match through a goal by Schiavio and the Italian team were crowned World Champions. Gianpiero Combi, who played 510 minutes and conceded three goals as captain of the squad, received the Jules Rimet trophy from the Italian Dictator Benito Mussolini. 1934 Italia: 10 June 1934, the final match (chapter ten) - www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org == End of career and retirement == A year later, in November 1935, Combi played only five of the eight matches in the International Cup and in his absence the Italian team won the trophy. He totalled 47 caps for the Italian team, 5 of which were as captain. Although he had stopped playing football, his passion for the sport remained all his life and he still held a number of unofficial positions with Juventus. He offered advice to the technical staff and also served as a scout. In 1951 the Italian Football Federation offered him the job of technical commissioner for the Italian national team with Carlino Beretta and Toni Busini. They led the National Team for seven months, from 8 April to 25 November 1951 in which time the Italian squad played 5 games without any losses. They won 4\u20131 against Portugal and France, and drew against Yugoslavia (0\u20130), Sweden (1\u20131) and Switzerland (1\u20131) - the only competitive game of the five. He died in Imperia on 12 August 1956, aged 53. == Style of play == Combi in action with Bianconeri in 1928 Despite his relatively small stature for a player in his position, Combi was a commanding keeper, who possessed notable strength, which he combined with his elegance, agility, intelligence, shot- stopping ability, positional sense, and excellent technique; throughout his career, he stood out in particular due to his consistency, efficient goalkeeping style, and composure, rather than flamboyance, even though he was capable of producing spectacular diving saves when necessary. He is regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time. == Records == * Combi is the first goalkeeper to win four Italian Championships in a row.From 1930\u201331 season to 1934\u201335 season.
