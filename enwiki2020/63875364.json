    "text": "Akiva Weingarten Akiva Weingarten (born December 23, 1984 in Monsey, New York) is a German-American liberal rabbi. He serves as the rabbi of the city of Dresden, Germany and the Liberal Jewish community \"Migwan\" in Basel, Switzerland. He is the founder of the Haichal Besht synagogue in Bnei Brak, Haichal Besht synagogue in Berlin and the Besht Yeshiva in Dresden. == Early life and education == Weingarten grew up in the Hasidic Satmar community in New York. The eldest of eleven siblings, his mother tongue is Yiddish. His family on his father's side emigrated from post-World War II Hungary, and his maternal ancestors came from Lithuania. He was a critical thinker from an early age and asked questions in the Yeshivot, which was met with rejection in the ultra-Orthodox community. He received his first rabbinic ordination at the age of 17. The following year he went to Israel to continue his studies and lived in the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak for ten years. At the age of 19 he was engaged and married at 20. Two years later he was already the father of two children. In Israel he was ordained a rabbi two more times. In 2014 Weingarten left Israel and the ultra-Orthodox community and went to Germany. He studied \"Jewish Studies\" at the University of Potsdam until he was appointed rabbi to Dresden and Basel in 2019. == Career == Akiva Weingarten has been rabbi of the \"Migwan\" Liberal community in Basel and the city of Dresden since August 2019. There he took over the office of his predecessor Alexander Nachama. Today Weingarten supports Jews who have left the ultra- Orthodox communities to get integrated in a life outside of the strictly religious environment. In 2017 he founded the liberal Hasidic community \"Besht-Berlin\", where Kabbalat Shabbat services, Kiddush and joint study groups were held regularly. == Philosophy == Weingarten is unique as a Liberal rabbi who wears Hasidic clothing such as the shtreimel and kaftan on Shabbat. In his sermons, he often uses Hasidic stories and explanations about the Torah, along with a liberal and up-to-date interpretation. He describes his approach to Judaism as liberal Hasidic. == References == == External links == * Akiva Weingarten, personal website * Migwan Basel, Liberal Jewish community of Basel, Switzerland * Shalom Dresden, Jewish community of Dresden, Germany * Facebook, personal Facebook page * Youtube, personal Youtube page Category:American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent Category:American people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent Category:Satmar Hasidim Category:People from New York City Category:People from Bnei Brak Category:American emigrants to Germany Category:German rabbis Category:1984 births Category:Living people ",
