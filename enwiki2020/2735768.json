It is marinated in sauce made up of soy sauce, sugar, Chinese wine, and spices. Despite the name \"Swiss\", it is unrelated to Switzerland. Instead, it is believed to have originated in either Hong Kong or Guangzhou.CNN Go 40 Hong Kong foods we can't live without 13 July 2011. Retrieved 2011-10-09 == Naming == There are no concrete answers as to the source or the name of the dish. One story \u2014 likely to be a mere urban legend \u2014 goes that a Westerner came across the dish \"sweetened soya sauce chicken wings\" in a restaurant, and asked a Chinese waiter what that was. The waiter, who did not speak perfect English, introduced the dish as \"sweet wing\". The customer misheard \"sweet\" as \"Swiss\", and the name \"Swiss wing\" has been used ever since. == Origin == Some claim that the dish was invented by a local restaurant, the Tai Ping Koon (:zh:\u592a\u5e73\u9928\u9910\u5ef3). It is a common practice in Hong Kong restaurants to name a new dish after a place, which may or may not have any connection with the dish itself at all. Swiss wing is also featured in the TVB cooking variety series So Good. == See also == *Buffalo wing *List of chicken dishes *Soy sauce chicken == References == == External links == *History of Tai Ping Koon Restaurant from their website. *Swiss Sauce Chicken Wings (Dark Soy Sauce Chicken Wings) Category:Cantonese cuisine Category:Chinese chicken dishes Category:Hong Kong cuisine ",
