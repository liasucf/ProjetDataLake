    "text": "Naehun (Instructions for women, \ub0b4\ud6c8, \u5167\u8a13) is the first known book written by a woman in Korea, it is a Confucian morality guidebook for women. The book is one of the most representative books which reflects social construction of gender and sexuality based on Confucian ideals in premodern East Asia. It has a modern value in that it becomes a unique Korean history material with various Korean royal court vocabulary describing appropriate behavior for a woman in accordance with Confucian cultures. == Background == Grand Queen Dowager Insoo (posthumous Queen Sohye, 7 October 1437 \u2013 11 May 1504) regretted that there were no educational books that women could read easily at that time, and she wrote this book by extracting the key points of the women's discipline from four books of Chinese classical books for women such as Biographies of Exemplary Women, lesser learning, Mingxin baojian, Chinese Introduction for women. == Introduction of Royal Consorts == This is an instruction book for women published in 1475 (year 6 of Seongjong) written by Grand Queen Dowager Insoo, a wife of king Deokjong (1438 \u2013 2 September 1457, Korean: \uc758\uacbd\uc138\uc790). Queen Insu was a member of Cheongju Han clan family, appointed as the queen mother in 1475. The most emphasized of the virtue of women in the Naehun is Intellectual, moral rectitude and capability to act as a counselors and to remonstrators to their men. Such portrayal of women suggest a subversive notion of a 'blurred' demarcation of the inner and outer sphere, private or domestic. To justify those understanding, the book states for King and Queen, Men and Women's 'Speech and Component', Sitting, Eating, Walking, Conversation and so on. == Confucian morality for women == Naehun is the oldest known surviving work by a woman writer in Korea, however, it shows the effects of Confucian social values on women's status of the Joseon kingdom. It is published several times at different times, and the notation, as well as the vocabulary and writing style change well, making it an important resource for the study of Korean medieval languages. == The Book == At the head of the book is the Queen's letter of Instruction (\ub0b4\ud6c8) and the list. The book is composed of 3 volumes and 7 chapters. Volume 1 : Etiquette, Filial piety, Marriage Volume 2 : Married couple Volume 3 : Parents, Mother, Cordiality, Frugality === Queen Sohye's letter === Tomb of the Grand Queen Dowager Insu of Joseon kingdom (1392\u20131897), UNESCO World Heritage. \"Humankind are born with the divine energy of heaven and earth, and contains the five virtue of man's virtues. The reason is not different from beads or stones. But why is there something unusual like an orchid or wormwood? It depends on whether or not you have done your best to cleanse yourself. The enlightenment of the King Zhou of Shang, was further expanded in the wisdom of his wife, Daji. The king Yu of Zhou dynasty's supremacy was derived from the power of his wife, Bao Si. So who is better than this to serve the king and serve the husband? Politics is ruling or dizzying, and the rise or fall of the country depends on the light and dark of husbands, but also on the good and bad of their wives. Therefore, we must teach well. On the whole, a male plays in a wide and large mind, learns his will from various mysteries, and moves himself and discerns his wrong as a figure. So how would you wait to teach me and then do it?\" == See also == *Society in the Joseon Dynasty *Women in China *Women in Japan *Han Myeong-sook *Han Terra == References == Category:Korean non-fiction books Category:Korean culture Category:Memory of the World Register Category:National Treasures of South Korea Category:Cheongju Han clan Category:Korean women Category:Korean women in politics Category:15th-century Korean women writers Category:Royal consorts of the Joseon Dynasty Category:15th-century women rulers Category:Asian women Category:Confucian culture Category:Confucian academies ",
