While shopping at a supermarket, he bumps into his former high school girlfriend Amanda. The two greet each other, but Jim says he doesn't want to stop her from whatever she was up to. He bumps into her again in the parking lot and the two decide to go for coffee at a place called Blue Jay. The two discuss what has happened in their lives since they last saw each other. Amanda got married and became the stepmother to two children. Jim is working on building houses with his uncle and thinking about renovating his late mother's house. While walking Amanda to her car, the two pass a liquor store they went to frequently in their younger days. Amanda bets that the store owner will recognize them from when they were younger, although Jim disagrees. To Amanda's satisfaction, the store owner does remember the two. He remarks about how the two \"famous lovebirds\" are still together after two decades and gives them free beers and jelly beans, while Amanda and Jim jokingly play along about how they are still a couple after all this time. The two further discuss their current lives in depth by a lake, leaving Jim crying and feeling discontented about his life when he hears of how impressive Amanda's life sounds. The two visit his mother's house, leaving them nostalgic over the memories they shared. While rummaging through old memorabilia, Amanda discovers a letter addressed to her written years ago, and she decides to keep it. Amanda then finds tape recordings of Jim and her roleplaying their middle-aged lives. They play the recordings and laugh about how uncool they were. Jim proposes they have some \"fun\" and they decide to recreate the tape, pretending to be a married couple celebrating their 20th anniversary. At the end of the night, Amanda confesses to Jim she is on anti- depressants and that she has not cried in years. The two eventually share a kiss that leads to making out in the bedroom. But things are stopped when Jim reveals his residual love for her. It is then revealed dramatically that Amanda had an abortion back in high school and that was the cause of their separation. They lash out at each other, ending it with Jim breaking down and crying on the floor. Jim walks Amanda to her car the next morning, and Amanda explains her decision. Jim asks her to read the letter he didn't send her, saying he wanted to keep the baby. Amanda begins to cry, for the first time in 5 years, and then they laugh about it together. Jim and Amanda then sigh at one another and the screen cuts to black. ==Cast== * Mark Duplass as Jim Henderson * Sarah Paulson as Amanda Stone * Clu Gulager as Waynie ==Production== The film was shot over the course of 7 days in and around Crestline, California.
