    "text": "The 2018\u20132019 All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship was the 49th annual gaelic football club championship since its establishment in the 1970\u201371 season. The winners receive the Andy Merrigan Cup. The defending champions were Corofin from Galway who defeated Nemo Rangers from Cork on 17 March 2018 to win their 3rd title. ==Competition format== County Championships All thirty two counties in Ireland and London play their county senior championships between their top gaelic football clubs. Each county decides the format for their county championship. The format can be straight knockout, double-elimination, a league, groups, etc. or a combination. Only single club teams are allowed to enter the All-Ireland Club championship. If a team which is an amalgamation of two or more clubs, a divisional team or a university team wins a county's championship, a single club team will represent that county in the provincial championship as determined by that county's championship rules. Normally it is the club team that exited the championship at the highest stage. Provincial Championships Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster each organise a provincial championship for their participating county champions. The Kilkenny senior champions play in the Leinster Intermediate Club Football Championship. Beginning in 2018\u201319, London compete in the Connacht championship. In previous years they played one of the provincial champions in a single match in December referred to as a quarter-final. All matches are knock-out. Two ten minute periods of extra time are played each way if it's a draw at the end of normal time in all matches including the final. If the score is still level after extra time the match is replayed. All-Ireland The two semi-finals between the four provincial champions are usually played on a Saturday in mid February. The All-Ireland final is traditionally played in Croke Park on St. Patrick's Day, the 17th of March. All matches are knock-out. Two ten minute periods of extra time are played each way if it's a draw at the end of normal time in the semi-finals or final. If the score is still level after extra time the match is replayed. ==TV Coverage== TG4 continue to broadcast live and deferred club championship games each year.
