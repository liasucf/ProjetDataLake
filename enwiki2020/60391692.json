    "text": "Padillothorus is a genus of jumping spiders in the family Salticidae containing the single species, Padillothorus elegans. It was first described by Jerzy Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski in 2018, and has only been found in Indonesia. In 1987, Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski synonymized the genus Padillothorax, first described by Eug\u00e8ne Simon in 1901, with Stagetillus. In 2017 and 2018, Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski restored Padillothorax, and separated it from the new genus Padillothorus. Simon had placed Padillothorax and Stagetillus in his group Bavieae, now the tribe Baviini in Maddison's 2015 classification of Salticidae. Since the male of Padillothorus elegans is unknown, Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski considered that classification to any group of genera was impossible. ==References== ==External links== Category:Monotypic Salticidae genera Category:Salticidae ",
