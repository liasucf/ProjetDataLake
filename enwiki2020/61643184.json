    "text": "The 2020 ACA Africa T20 Cup Finals is a forthcoming cricket tournament due to be held in Nairobi, Kenya. The tournament was originally scheduled to be held in September 2019, but was moved to March 2020. On 9 March 2020, the tournament was postponed again due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with the Kenyan government's 30-day ban on international gatherings. The eight qualified teams are split into two groups, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the semi-finals. Group A consists of Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria and Uganda; while host nation Kenya are placed in group B along with Botswana, Cameroon and Mozambique. All of the matches will have full T20I status as the ICC granted T20I status to matches between all of its members from 1 January 2019. Cameroon could be playing their first matches with T20I status during this tournament, depending on when the event is rescheduled. ==Squads== Squads as announced before the event was postponed on 9 March 2020. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto\" |- ! ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | | * Solefack James (c) * Nyoma Abega * Abada Amah * Nono Aminou * Nseke Toube Bruno * Ondoa Charles * Mpegna Faustin * Tchakou Idris * Dipita Loic * Ngong Michael * Ndouteng Narcise * Abanda Protais * Mballa Raoul | * Obed Harvey (c) * Daniel Anefie * Moses Anefie * Samson Awiah * Richmond Baaleri * Kofi Bagabena * Francis Bakiweyem * Godfred Bakiweyem * Rexford Bakum * Abdulai Mohammed * Devender Singh * Aziz Sualley * Joseph Theodore * James Vifah | |- ! ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Mohamed Abdulla (c) | * Kaleem Shah (c) | * Abiola Ayannaike (c) * Rasheed Abolarin * Sesan Adedeji * Vincent Adewoye * Daniel Ajekun * Chima Akachukwu * Pradeep Chaudhary * Daniel Gim * Isaac Okpe * Sylvester Okpe * Dotun Olatunji * Chimezie Onwuzulike * Sulaimon Runsewe * Ovais Yousof | * Arnold Otwani (c) * Richard Agamiire * Frank Akankwasa * Zephania Arinaitwe * Trevor Bukenya * Bilal Hassun * Deusdedit Muhumuza * Roger Mukasa * Frank Nsubuga * Riazat Ali Shah * Henry Ssenyondo * Shahzad Ukani * Charles Waiswa * Kenneth Waiswa |} ==Group stage== ===Group A=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !width=150| Team !width=20| !width=20| !width=20| !width=20| !width=20| !width=20| !width=50| ! style=\"width:185px;\" | |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" | align=\"left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || +0.000 || rowspan=2 | Advanced to semi-finals |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" | align=\"left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || +0.000 |- | align=\"left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || +0.000 || |- | align=\"left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || +0.000 || |} ===Group B=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !width=150| Team !width=20| !width=20| !width=20| !width=20| !width=20| !width=20| !width=50| ! style=\"width:185px;\" | |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" | align=\"left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || +0.000 || rowspan=2 | Advanced to semi-finals |- style=\"background:#cfc;\" | align=\"left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || +0.000 |- | align=\"left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || +0.000 || |- | align=\"left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || +0.000 || |} ==References== Category:Cricket in Africa Category:2020 in Kenyan cricket Category:Associate international cricket competitions in 2019\u201320 ACA Africa T20 ",
