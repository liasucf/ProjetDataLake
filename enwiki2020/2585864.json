    "text": "Harold Julian Amery, Baron Amery of Lustleigh, (27 March 1919 \u2013 3 September 1996), was an English Conservative Party politician, who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for 39 of the 42 years between 1950 and 1992. He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1960. Amery was created a life peer upon his retirement from the House of Commons in 1992. For three decades, he was a leading figure in the Conservative Monday Club and the son-in-law of Conservative prime minister Harold Macmillan. His brother, John, was hanged for high treason for supporting Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy during the Second World War. ==Early and family life== Amery was born in Chelsea, London. His father was Leo Amery, a British statesman and Conservative politician. He was educated at Eaton House, Summer Fields School, Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford. While an undergraduate, he had a brief romance with the novelist Barbara Pym, who was six years his senior. ==Military service== Before the Second World War started, Amery was a war correspondent in the Spanish Civil War and later an attach\u00e9 for the British Foreign Office in Belgrade. After the war began, he joined the RAF as a sergeant in 1940 then was commissioned and transferred to the British Army on the General List in 1941, reaching the rank of Captain. He spent 1941\u201342 in the eastern Mediterranean (the Middle East, Malta, Yugoslavia) and served as Liaison Officer to the Albanian Resistance Movement in 1943\u201344 (\"The Musketeers\": Captain Julian Amery, Major David Smiley and Lieutenant-Colonel Neil McLean). The following year, Amery went to China to work with General Carton de Wiart, then Prime Minister's Personal Representative to Generalissimo Chiang Kai- shek. Amery became a close friend of King Zog of Albania and described him as \"the cleverest man I have ever met\".Amery, Julian, Approach March: a Venture in Autobiography. Hutchinson, 1973 ==Political career== Amery won a Parliamentary seat in the first general election held after he returned to civilian life, in 1950. He was elected as Conservative MP for Preston North, going on to hold a number of government offices, all in governments led by his father-in-law, now the Prime Minister. He began with two Under-Secretaryships of State: for War (1957\u201358) and for the Colonies (1958\u201360). He was promoted to Secretary of State for Air (1960\u201362), followed by a promotion to the post of Minister of Aviation (1962\u201364). In this role, Amery played a major role in developing the supersonic passenger service known as Concorde. Amery lost his seat in 1966, but was elected again in 1969 for Brighton Pavilion, a seat he would hold until 1992 when he retired. On 8 July 1992, he was created a life peer as Baron Amery of Lustleigh, of Preston in the County of Lancashire and of Brighton in the County of East Sussex. Under the Heath administration, Amery held three ministerial posts: Minister for Public Works (1970), Minister for Housing and Construction (1970\u201372) and Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1972\u201374). ===Monday Club=== For 30 years, Julian Amery was an active member and later a Patron of the Conservative Monday Club, where he became friendly with General Sir Walter Walker, subsequently writing the foreword for Walker's anti-Soviet book, The Next Domino. He was Guest of Honour at the Club's Annual Dinner at the Cutlers' Hall in 1963. In 1965, he wrote the foreword for Club activist Geoffrey Stewart-Smith's book, No Vision Here. On May Day 1970, he was one of the Club's principal speakers at their 'Law and Liberty' rally in Trafalgar Square, held in answer to the 'Stop the Seventy Tour' campaign, designed to stop the South African cricket tour. Julian Amery was the Monday Club's Guest-of-Honour at their Annual Dinner held at the Savoy Hotel, London, in January 1974 and again at the dinner at the end of the Club's two-day Conference in Birmingham in March 1975. ===Political views=== Amery was in favour of entry to the European Common Market and also of the nuclear deterrent. Both caused some discord between himself and his old friend Enoch Powell. But for many, he was seen as an archetypal \"God and Empire\" Conservative. In late 1962 Amery made these comments after Egypt sent troops to Yemen to prevent an insurrection: > \"The prosperity of our people rests really on the oil in the Persian Gulf, > the rubber and tin of Malaya, and the gold, copper and precious metals of > South- and Central Africa. As long as we have access to these; as long as we > can realize the investments we have there; as long as we trade with this > part of the world, we shall be prosperous. If the communists [or anyone > else] were to take them over, we would lose the lot. Governments like > Colonel Nasser's in Egypt are just as dangerous.\" In 1963, Amery took charge of Quintin Hogg's campaign for leadership of the Conservative Party.cf.Heffer, 189; 324 In early 1975, he took part in a House of Commons debate on the Trades Unions Congress's invitation to Alexander Shelepin, the former Soviet KGB Chief, to visit Britain. He stated that \"more and more people are beginning to look upon the TUC as a Communist-penetrated show and this invitation must strengthen that view.\" According to Margaret Thatcher's 1995 memoir, The Path to Power, when Harold Wilson's Labour government proposed devolution for Scotland in 1976, \"Julian Amery and Maurice Macmillan proved effective leaders of the anti-devolution Tory camp.\" Although he was Harold Macmillan's son-in-law, he failed to defend him when Count Nikolai Tolstoy published The Minister and the Massacres in 1986, focusing the ultimate burden of blame sharply on Macmillan for the 1945 Bleiburg repatriations and the Cossack repatriations. Amery stated that the repatriations were \"one of the few blots on Harold that I can think of\". ==Personal life== On 26 January 1950, he married Catherine Macmillan (19 November 1926 - 27 May 1991), daughter of Harold Macmillan. The couple had one son and three daughters. ==Death== Amery died on 3 September 1996 in Westminster, London. He is buried with his wife (who predeceased him) at the Church of St John the Baptist in Lustleigh, Devon. ==Notes== ;Citations ;Bibliography * Copping, Robert, The Story of The Monday Club \u2013 The First Decade, April 1972 (P/B); and The Monday Club \u2013 Crisis and After (Foreword by John Biggs-Davison, M.P.), May 1975, (P/B), pps:12 & 24, published by the Current Affairs Information Service. * Amery, Julian, M.P., et al., Rhodesia and the Threat to the West Monday Club, London, 1976 (P/B). * Gash, Norman, with Donald Southgate, David Dilks, and John Ramsden; introduction by Lord Butler, K.G.,P.C., The Conservatives \u2013 A History of their Origins to 1965 London, 1977, pps:268-9. * Amery, Julian, PC, MP, The Next Four Years, in the Primrose League Gazette, vol.87, no.4, October 1983, London. * Amery, Julian, MP, The Rt.
