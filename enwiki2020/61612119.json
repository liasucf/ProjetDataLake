Born a twin to a Tharawal mother in La Perouse, New South Wales. At age thirteen although barely educated herself, Callaghan became a teacher within an Aboriginal settlement in Bellbrook, New South Wales. Emma lived on this settlement for twenty-five years alongside Retta Long helping with childbirth, birth registration, and the ill. She was proficient in needlework and was also a translator of the Dhanggati language, the tongue of her first husband\u2019s tribe, working with biblical tales. Her new home in Armidale was later visited by Ellen Kent Hughes. On the same year as her second husband\u2019s death, she met Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark.
