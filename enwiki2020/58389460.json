    "text": "The Big Creek Bridge is a -long, open spandrel, concrete deck arch bridge located on the southern portion of the Big Sur coast of California, along State Route 1 near Lucia. Opened for traffic in 1938, it crosses Big Creek Canyon on this scenic, mountainous coast. ==History== Constructed during the Great Depression and identified by Caltrans as Bridge No. 44 0056, it was opened for traffic in 1938 (some sources give this figure as 1937). Its construction was partially funded by the federal government in connection with the Works Progress Administration. Situated high above Big Creek canyon, this bridge has remained open while many others on the Pacific Coast Highway have been closed due to mud slides. There are parking areas at both ends of the bridge to allow motorists to stop and take photographs. ==Design and construction== Its two main spans are open spandrel arches, each long, while the -long side arches are cantilevered to the canyon walls. The -wide bridge deck provides for two lanes of traffic and is above the ground below. Christian Theophil Gutleben, noted for his reinforced concrete arch bridges throughout the California coast and in the Los Angeles area, was the designer. The structure got a seismic retrofit in 1999. == References == ==External links== Category:Road bridges in California Category:Open-spandrel deck arch bridges in the United States Category:California State Route 1 Category:Bridges in Monterey County, California Category:Concrete bridges in California Category:Bridges completed in 1938 Category:Big Sur ",
