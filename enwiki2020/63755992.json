He observed many patients with pneumonia and hypoxia (low oxygen levels in blood) who did not have typical symptoms of breathing problems such as chest discomfort or painful breathing. Levitan suggested in a New York Times op-ed that the widespread use of pulse oximeters could lead to earlier detection of serious breathing complications, and to better outcomes for patients with these complications. Although the op-ed was widely covered in the news, other doctors cautioned that early detection might lead to overtreatment, and that the role of early detection of hypoxia in treating COVID-19 still needed to be studied. == Personal life == On January 7, 1990, Levitan married lawyer Diane Edbril at the Windows on the World. , Levitan resides in northern New Hampshire. == Selected works == === Books === *Reviews of the Airway Cam Guide to Intubation and Practical Emergency Airway Management * * * * === Journal articles === * * * * ==References== == Further reading == * * * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Physicians from New York (state) Category:Living people Category:21st-century American physicians Category:American emergency physicians Category:New York University School of Medicine alumni Category:Geisel School of Medicine faculty Category:21st- century American businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:Horace Mann School alumni Category:Williams College alumni ",
