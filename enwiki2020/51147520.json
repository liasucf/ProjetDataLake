    "text": "Rohini Balakrishnan is an Indian bioacoustics expert. She is a senior Professor and Chair of the Centre for Ecological Sciences at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. Her team works on different aspects of animal communication and bioacoustics to help understand animal behaviour. == Education and career == Balakrishnan has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Biology and a Master\u2019s in Zoology. She received her PhD in behaviour genetics in 1991 from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai, India. She was the first Ph.D. student of Veronica Rodrigues, an Indian geneticist. She then moved into the field of behavioural ecology, studying acoustic communication in animals and carried out postdoctoral research at McGill University, Canada, from 1993-1996, followed by a second postdoc at the University of Erlangen, Germany (1996-1998). She joined the IISc, Bangalore in 1998 where she is currently Professor and Chair of the Centre for Ecological Sciences. == Research == Balakrishnan's current research is on acoustic communication in animals, focusing primarily on crickets and katydids as study systems. Over the past 15 years, she has worked extensively on cricket species in the tropical forests of Karnataka. Her team aims to develop and validate databases of acoustic signals of various species to facilitate identification of different animals, without actual physical contact. She aims to develop means to aid periodic biodiversity monitoring exercises with an automated recorder installed in an environment. == Publications == * Deb, R., Modak, S., & Balakrishnan, R. (2020).
