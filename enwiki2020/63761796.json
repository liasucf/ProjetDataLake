Garbi had her biggest commercial success with Arhizo Polemo and Evaisthisies, two of the highest selling albums of the 1990s (decade), followed by the double To Kati, which is one of the best-selling albums of the 2000s (decade) in Greece. Her albums have been released on Sony Music Entertainment Greece (1989\u20132009, 2013), Universal Music Greece (2010\u20132013) and Panik Platinum (2016\u2013present).

Breaking away from the duo, Garbi featured on compilation albums Ta Deka Dekaria Vol 1 and Vol 2, which were followed by her debut solo album Prova. In 1992, Garbi's fourth album Tou Feggariou Anapnoes was certified gold and spawned Garbi's first commercial hit \"Pes To M'Ena Fili\". This led to her participating in the Eurovision Song Contest 1993 with \"Ellada, Hora Tou Fotos\", taking 9th place. The same year Garbi began collaborating with songwriter Phoebus in a partnership that resulted in 1 gold, 1 platinum and 3 multi-platinum albums. Garbi's popularity culminated in the mid-1990s early-2000s (decade), becoming a prominent performer of the laiko-pop genre reigning at the time.
