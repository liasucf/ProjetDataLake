    "text": "Kevin Knabjian (born July 5, 1984) is a retired American mixed martial artist of Armenian descent. A professional from 2003 until 2012, he competed for the UFC and the WEC. ==Mixed martial arts career== Knabjian went to Eastern Illinois University, from which he graduated with a degree in Business Management. Together with fellow EIU student, Brian Ebersole, he started practicing MMA when he was in his freshman year of college. He also wrestled for EIU, a Division 1 school. In his professional debut Knabjian fought Adam Gibson to a draw. His WEC debut ended unsuccessfully when he was knocked out by Brock Larson only 27 seconds into the fight; he went on to compete in other promotions, such as XFO, where he has drawn attention as the title fight of XFO 22, defeating Ultimate Fighter 1 fighter Josh Rafferty by TKO. ==Mixed martial arts record== |- |Loss |align=center|12\u20137\u20131 |Drew Fickett |Submission (guillotine choke) |WMMA 1: Fighting for a Better World | |align=center|1 |align=center|3:38 |El Paso, Texas, United States |Lightweight bout. |- |Win |align=center|12\u20136\u20131 |Brandon Adamson |Submission (kimura) |XFO 42: Xtreme Fighting Organization | |align=center|1 |align=center|1:44 |Hoffman Estates, Illinois, United States | |- |Win |align=center|11\u20136\u20131 |John Tarrh |Submission (punches) |PCF: TWC 9: Berserk | |align=center|1 |align=center|0:36 |Indianapolis, Indiana, United States | |- |Loss |align=center|10\u20136\u20131 |Nick Duell |KO (head kick) |NAAFS: Caged Vengeance 9 | |align=center|2 |align=center|1:01 |Canton, Ohio, United States | |- |Loss |align=center|10\u20135\u20131 |Brian Gassaway |Decision (unanimous) |Bellator 25 | |align=center|3 |align=center|5:00 |Chicago, Illinois, United States | |- |Loss |align=center|10\u20134\u20131 |Jacob Volkmann |Submission (D'arce choke) |Bellator 7 | |align=center|2 |align=center|1:42 |Chicago, Illinois, United States | |- |Win |align=center|10\u20133\u20131 |Jacob Kuester |Submission (heel hook) |Extreme Challenge 101 | |align=center| 1 |align=center| 4:26 |Franklin, Wisconsin, United States | |- |Win |align=center|9\u20133\u20131 |Mario Stapel |TKO (punches) |Primetime Fighting Championships | |align=center|1 |align=center|2:02 |Merrillville, Indiana, United States | |- |Win |align=center|8\u20133\u20131 |Josh Rafferty |TKO (punches) |Xtreme Fighting Organization 22 | |align=center|1 |align=center|1:58 |Crystal Lake, Illinois, United States | |- |Win |align=center|7\u20133\u20131 |Josh Lee |Submission (rear-naked choke) |AB: Lockdown | |align=center|1 |align=center|3:51 |Chicago, Illinois, United States | |- |Loss |align=center|6\u20133\u20131 |Brock Larson |TKO (punches) |WEC 28 | |align=center|1 |align=center|0:27 |Las Vegas, Nevada, United States | |- |Win |align=center|6\u20132\u20131 |Jedrzej Kubski |TKO (punches) |IMMAC 2: Attack | |align=center|2 |align=center|1:20 |Chicago, Illinois, United States | |- |Win |align=center|5\u20132\u20131 |Grant Sarver |Submission (armbar) |CFC 1: Explosion | |align=center|2 |align=center|0:48 |Tinley Park, Illinois, United States | |- |Win |align=center|4\u20132\u20131 |Joe Geromiller |TKO (punches) |Courage Fighting Championships 7 | |align=center|3 |align=center|0:55 |Decatur, Illinois, United States | |- |Win |align=center|3\u20132\u20131 |Randy Newell |Submission (armbar) |APEX: Undisputed | |align=center|1 |align=center|0:55 |Montreal, Quebec, Canada | |- |Win |align=center|2\u20132\u20131 |Andre Garcia |TKO |DC 2: Duneland Classic 2 | |align=center|1 |align=center|N/A |Portage, Indiana, United States | |- |Loss |align=center|1\u20132\u20131 |LaVerne Clark |KO (punch) |Courage Fighting Championships 1 | |align=center|2 |align=center|0:10 |Decatur, Illinois, United States |Welterweight debut. |- |Loss |align=center|1\u20131\u20131 |Miguel Gutierrez |Submission (rear-naked choke) |Cage Fighting Championship: Ultimate Fighting Mexico | |align=center|2 |align=center|N/A |Monterrey, Mexico | |- |Win |align=center|1\u20130\u20131 |Nino Marroquin |TKO (punches) |CFM: Cage Fighting Monterrey | |align=center|3 |align=center|N/A |Monterrey, Mexico | |- | Draw |align=center|0\u20130\u20131 |Adam Gibson |Draw |Shooto: Midwest Fighting | |align=center|2 |align=center|5:00 |Hammond, Indiana, United States | |- ==References== ==External links== * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Chicago Category:Eastern Illinois University alumni Category:American people of Armenian descent Category:American male mixed martial artists Category:Mixed martial artists from Illinois Category:Welterweight mixed martial artists ",
