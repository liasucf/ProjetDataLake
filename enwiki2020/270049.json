Jacques Albin Simon Collin de Plancy (28 January 1793 in Plancy-l'Abbaye \u2013 1881 in Paris) was a French occultist, demonologist and writer; he published several works on occultism and demonology.J Stouff, Les Mille et un jours (2010) biblioweb.hypotheses.org \"C'est sans doute la raison pour laquelle, il fut demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Jacques Collin de Plancy (1793-1881) qui ne connaissait par l'Orient, mais \u00e9tait expert en esprits et d\u00e9mons de toute sorte, d'en r\u00e9diger une introduction.\" \\- Fran\u00e7oise Lavocat, Pierre Kapitaniak, and Marianne Closson, eds. \"Fictions du diable: Litt\u00e9rature et d\u00e9monologie de saint Augustin \u00e0 L\u00e9o Taxil\".

Finally, Jean C\u00e9ard examines the lingering hold that the demonology of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries exerted upon the imaginations of the later Romantics, as exemplified by authors such as Jacques Collin de Plancy, who \u201crediscovered\u201d earlier demonologists. ...\" ==Biography== He was born Jacques Albin Simon Collin on 28 (in some sources 30) January 1793 in Plancy (presently Plancy-l'Abbaye), the son of Edme-Aubin Collin and Marie-Anne Danton, the sister of Georges-Jacques Danton who was executed the year after Jacques was born.L\u00e9on Fr\u00e9mont, Revue de Champagne et de Brie: Histoire, biographie, archa\u00e9ologie. Georges H\u00e9relle, 1880: \"Jacques Collin, connu en litt\u00e9rature sous le nom de Collin de Plancy, naquit \u00e0 Plancy, le 30 janvier 1794. Il \u00e9tait fils de Edme-Aubin Collin et de Marie-Anne Danton, et par cette derni\u00e8re neveu du fameux Danton. Il commen\u00e7a ses \u00e9tudes chez\u2026\" He later added the aristocratic de Plancy himself \u2013 an addition which later caused accusations against his son in his career as a diplomat. He was a free-thinker influenced by Voltaire. He worked as a printer and publisher in Plancy-l'Abbaye and Paris. Between 1830 and 1837, he resided in Brussels, and then in the Netherlands, before he returned to France after having converted to the Catholic religion. Collin de Plancy followed the tradition of many previous demonologists of cataloguing demons by name and title of nobility, as it happened with grimoires like Pseudomonarchia Daemonum and The Lesser Key of Solomon. In 1818, his best known work, Dictionnaire Infernal, was published. In 1863, some images were added that made it famous: imaginative drawings concerning the appearance of certain demons. In 1822, it was advertised as: :\"Anecdotes of the nineteenth new century or historiettes, recent anecdotes, features and words little known, singular adventures, various quotations, bringings together and curious parts, to be used for the history of customs and the spirit of the century when we live compared with the last centuries.\" It is considered a major work documenting beings, characters, books, deeds and causes which pertain to the manifestations and magic of trafficking with Hell; divinations, occult sciences, grimoires, marvels, errors, prejudices, traditions, folktales, the various superstitions, and generally all manner of marvellous, surprising, mysterious, and supernatural beliefs. By the end of 1830, he ostensibly became an enthusiastic Catholic, much to the confusion of his former admirers and detractors. In 1846, he published a two-volume work entitled Dictionnaire Sciences Occultes et des Id\u00e9es superstitieuses, another listing of demons. The set cost 16 francs. Jacques Collin de Plancy was the father of Victor Collin de Plancy (1853\u20131924), who, for nearly a decade, starting in 1884, was French Minister to Korea and whose collected art works and books became part of the core of the Korean collections of the French Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale and the Mus\u00e9e Guimet in Paris.Fran\u00e7ois Roudaut: Le Fonds Collin de Plancy \u00e0 la Biblioth\u00e8que de Troyes.
