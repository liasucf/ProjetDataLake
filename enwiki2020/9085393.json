    "text": "Sarva Dharma Sama Bhava is a Hindu concept embodying the equality of the destination of the paths followed by all religions (Although the paths themselves may be different). The concept was embraced by Ramakrishna and Vivekenanda, as well as Mahatma Gandhi. Although commonly thought to be among the ancient Hindu vedas, the phrase is actually attributed to Gandhi, having been used first in September 1930 in his communications to his followers to quell divisions that had begun to develop between Hindus and Muslims toward the end of the British Raj. The concept is one of the key tenets of secularism in India, wherein there is not a separation of church and state, but an attempt by the state to embrace all religions. Sarva dharma sama bhav has been rejected by a small portion of highly conservative Hindu's who claim that religious universalism has led to the loss of many of Hinduism's rich traditions. Sarva dharma sama bhav is often translated as \"All religions are the same\" or \"All path's lead to the same destination [In a religious sense]\", although its literal meaning is closer to \"All dharma/faiths are possible\". This concept of pluralism significantly differs from Abrahamic religions's (Islam, Christianity and Judaism) exclusivist-supremacist doctrine of \"only my faith, prophet/messenger and book are the only way to salvation\". Hence, unlike Abrahamic religions, Hinduism has no concept of the Apostasy (prohibition of and punishment for renouncing religion) and the Blasphemy (following being punishable crime: lack of reverence, lack of strict adherence, act of insulting or showing contempt). One issue arises over the fact that while vedas were written in a period when no other religion existed, how would this concept arise? Thus, it is critical to imagine its source. ==See also== * Comparative religion * Hindu\u2013Christianity relations * Hindu\u2013Islamic relations * Hinduism and Judaism * Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb * Unity in diversity * Religious syncretism * Hindutva * We Are the World ==References== ==External links== * Sarva Dharma Samabh\u00e3va or Sarva Dharma Sambhrama?
