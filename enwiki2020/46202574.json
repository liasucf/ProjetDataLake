    "text": "Ireland has participated in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest five times since their first appearance in the contest. The Irish language broadcaster, TG4, is responsible for the country's participation in the contest, and uses the national final Junior Eurovision \u00c9ire to select the Irish entries. Since their debut in 2015, Ireland has achieved one top ten placing, in when the song \"Br\u00edce ar bhr\u00edce\" performed by Zena Donnelly placed 10th. ==History== TG4 originally intended to make their debut in the contest in Marsa, Malta, but required funding from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, which was rejected. Ireland debuted in the contest when TG4 participated in the contest in Sofia, Bulgaria, when the song \"R\u00e9alta na mara\" performed by Aimee Banks placed 12th in a field of 17 countries. Despite having initially confirmed their participation in the contest in January 2020, TG4 announced in August 2020 that they would not participate in the contest due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ===Junior Eurovision \u00c9ire=== Junior Eurovision \u00c9ire is an Irish television show which has served as Ireland's national final for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest since the country's debut in 2015. The show is hosted by Eoghan McDermott. Between 2015 and 2018, the show selected both the song and the artist, while in 2019 the show selected only the artist, and the song was selected internally. ==Participation== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" !width=30px|Year !Artist !Song !Language !width=50px|Place !width=50px|Points |- !scope=\"row\"| |Aimee Banks |\"R\u00e9alta na mara\" |Irish |align=center|12 |align=center|36 |- !scope=\"row\"| |Zena Donnelly |\"Br\u00edce ar bhr\u00edce\" |Irish, English |align=center|10 |align=center|122 |- !scope=\"row\"| |Muireann McDonnell |\"S\u00faile glasa\" |Irish |align=center|15 |align=center|54 |- !scope=\"row\"| |Taylor Hynes |\"IOU\" |Irish |align=center|15 |align=center|48 |- !scope=\"row\"| |Anna Kearney |\"Banshee\" |Irish |align=center|12 |align=center|73 |} ==Commentators and spokespersons== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align: left; width: 500px;\" |- !Year(s) !Commentator !Spokesperson !class=\"unsortable\"| |- !scope=\"row\"| |Stiof\u00e1n \u00d3 Fearail and Caitl\u00edn Nic Aoidh |Anna Banks | |- !scope=\"row\"| |rowspan=\"2\"|Eoghan McDermott |Andrea Leddy | |- !scope=\"row\"| |Walter McCabe | |- !scope=\"row\"| |M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Ciaraidh and Sin\u00e9ad N\u00ed Uallach\u00e1in |Alex Hynes | |- !scope=\"row\"| |Sin\u00e9ad N\u00ed Uallach\u00e1in |Leo Kearney | |- !scope=\"row\"| | | | |} ==Gallery== File:Aimee Banks at stage of JESC 2015 (2).jpg|Aimee Banks during the rehearsals in Sofia () File:JESC 2016 Zena Donnelly (Ireland).jpg|Zena Donnelly during the rehearsals in Valletta () File:Taylor Hynes at JESC 2018 (1).jpg|Taylor Hynes during the rehearsals in Minsk () File:Anna Kearney 2019.jpg|Anna Kearney during the rehearsals in Gliwice () ==See also== *Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest *Ireland in the Eurovision Dance Contest *Ireland in the Eurovision Young Dancers *Ireland in the Eurovision Young Musicians ==Notes and references== ===Notes=== ===References=== Category:Countries in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest ",
