    "text": "\"She's a Bitch\" is a song recorded by Missy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliott for her second album, Da Real World (1999). Produced by Timbaland, it was released as the album's debut single, and despite an expensive music video directed by noted video director Hype Williams, the song peaked only at number 90 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, with Da Real World's other singles \"All n My Grill\" and \"Hot Boyz\" going on to greater chart success. Elliott performed the song live on a number of occasions, including the 2017 VH1 Hip Hop Honors: The '90s Game Changers. ==Music video== The \"She's a Bitch\" video was directed by Hype Williams on May 1, 1999; similar to his other clips for Elliott, Williams makes extensive use of unique effects, costuming, and sets. Highlights of the video include Elliott and her dancers being raised from underwater on a giant hydraulic \"M\", and also a complete set made from electroluminescent lighting. ==Ski Mask the Slump God remix== Florida rapper Ski Mask the Slump God released a remix of the song titled \"Catch Me Outside\". A music video for the song was released on July 27th, 2017, and was directed and shot by Cole Bennett. In the song, he makes references to Naruto, the Pokemon Ninetales, the Italian luxury fashion brand Gucci, the basketball movie Like Mike, Peter Griffin, who is the protagonist of Family Guy, Lauryn Hill, King Julien from Madagascar, the famous cat Garfield, the rappers Gucci Mane and Yo Gotti, \"Doktor Avalanche\", a drum machine used by The Sisters of Mercy, his mixtape You Will Regret (stylized as \"YouWillRegret\"), the actor Jonah Hill, Coca-Cola and its polar bear mascot used in Christmas advertising, and the children's TV show Blue's Clues. == Track listings == === UK single === 12-inch promoMissy Elliott \u2013 She's A Bitch Side A #\"She's a Bitch\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:27 #\"She's a Bitch\" (Clean Version) \u2013 3:27 Side B #\"She's a Bitch\" (Instrumental) \u2013 4:00 #\"She's a Bitch\" (Acapella) \u2013 3:48 === US single === 12-inch promoMissy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliott* \u2013 She's A BitchMissy Elliott \u2013 She's A Bitch Side A #\"She's a Bitch\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:27 #\"She's a Bitch\" (Clean Version) \u2013 3:27 Side B #\"She's a Bitch\" (Instrumental) \u2013 4:00 #\"She's a Bitch\" (Acapella) \u2013 3:48 CD promoMissy Misdemeanor Elliott* \u2013 She's A Bitch #\"She's a Bitch\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:27 #\"She's a Bitch\" (Clean Version) \u2013 3:27 #\"Audio Bio\" \u2013 1:25 ===Europe single=== CD promoMissy Misdemeanor Elliott* \u2013 She's A Bitch #\"She's a Bitch\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:27 #\"She's a Bitch\" (Clean Version) \u2013 3:27 ==Personnel== *All vocals by Missy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliott and Timbaland *Produced by Timbaland *Co-produced by Missy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliott *Engineer: Senator Jimmy D (Jimmy Douglass) *Assistant engineer: Drew Coleman *Mixed by Timbaland and Jimmy Douglass at Manhattan Center Studios, New York, New York. *Assistant mixing engineer: Darren S.
