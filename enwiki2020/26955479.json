The match was contested by Stevenage Borough who won the competition in 2007 and 2009, and Barrow who won the competition in 1990.

It was on the ten-minute mark where, in Borough's first attack of the game, Andy Drury lashed a strike straight into the top corner of Barrow keeper Stuart Tomlinson's goal. This goal seemed to change the feel of the game, with Stevenage applying more and more pressure until, on 28 minutes, Stevenage midfielder David Bridges was shown a straight red card for serious foul play on Barrow No. 7, Andy Bond. The game was evenly balanced from then until half- time. Barrow began the second-half brightly, creating plenty of chances; Stevenage had a few chances, however Barrow seemed to apply more and more pressure. On 79 minutes, substitute Lee McEvilly placed a header into the bottom right corner of Chris Day's net. Barrow exerted more and more pressure from then onwards, until 90 minutes when Borough keeper Day suffered an injury and was replaced by Ashley Bayes. Deep into added time when extra time seemed likely, Robin Hulbert went in for a challenge with his elbow, meaning the referee had no choice but to show red. Stevenage substitute Charlie Griffin had a huge amount of blood coming from his face, there was no way he could continue. They had already used all three subs, meaning the extra time was played 10 against 9 (Barrow 10 players, Stevenage 9). The first half of extra time was even, but Barrow were possibly edging it. The second half of extra time could not have started better for Barrow as Jason Walker struck a stunning 25-yard strike into the top left corner of the goal. Barrow seemed to try and play the clock down and Stevenage had a few decent chances, before on 117 minutes Barrow had a 3-against-1 on the keeper, which amazingly, they missed. In the end, it didn't matter and the trophy went to Barrow. ===Details=== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||21 || Stuart Tomlinson |- |RB ||2|| Simon Spender |- |CB ||4 || Paul Jones (c) |- |CB ||5|| Phil Bolland |- |LB || 3 || Paul Edwards |- |RM ||8|| Paul Rutherford || || |- |CM ||6 || Robin Hulbert || || |- |CM ||7|| Andy Bond |- |LM ||24|| Simon Wiles || || |- |FW ||9|| Jason Walker |- |FW ||26 || Gregg Blundell || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||1|| Tim Deasy |- |MF ||8|| Mark Boyd || || |- |FW ||10|| Lee McEvilly || || |- |MF ||11|| Carlos Logan || || |- |DF ||12|| Mike Pearson |- |colspan=3|Managers: |- |colspan=4| Darren Sheridan Dave Bayliss |} |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=center |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||16 || Chris Day || || |- |RB ||25 || Ronnie Henry |- |CB ||5 || Jon Ashton |- |CB ||14|| Mark Roberts (c) |- |LB ||3|| Scott Laird |- |RM ||23 || Andy Drury |- |CM ||18|| David Bridges || || |- |CM ||24 || Michael Bostwick |- |LM ||30|| Joel Byrom || || |- |FW ||20 || Chris Beardsley || || |- |FW ||11|| Yemi Odubade |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||1|| Ashley Bayes || || |- |DF ||2 || Lawrie Wilson || || |- |MF ||8|| Stacy Long |- |FW ||9|| Charlie Griffin || || |- |MF ||30 || Peter Vincenti |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4| Graham Westley |} |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| |} ==References== Category:FA Trophy Finals Fa Trophy Final Fa Trophy Final Fa Trophy Final FA Trophy Final 2010 FA Trophy Final 2010 Category:Events at Wembley Stadium ",
