    "text": "How to Design Programs (HtDP) is a textbook by Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew Flatt, and Shriram Krishnamurthi on the systematic design of computer programs. MIT Press published the first edition in 2001, and the second edition in 2018, which is freely available online and in print. The book introduces the concept of a design recipe, a six-step process for creating programs from a problem statement. While the book was originally used along with the education project TeachScheme! (renamed ProgramByDesign), it has been adopted at many colleges and universities for teaching program design principles. According to HtDP, the design process starts with a careful analysis of a problem statement with the goal of extracting a rigorous description of the kinds of data that the desired program consumes and produces. The structure of these data descriptions determines the organization of the program. Then, the book carefully introduces data forms of progressively growing complexity. It starts with data of atomic forms and then progresses to compound forms, including data that can be arbitrarily large. For each kind of data definition, the book explains how to organize the program in principle, thus enabling a programmer who encounters a new form of data to still construct a program systematically. Like Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), HtDP relies on a variant of the programming language Scheme. It includes its own programming integrated development environment (IDE), named DrRacket, which provides a series of programming languages. The first language supports only functions, atomic data, and simple structures. Each language adds expressive power to the prior one. Except for the largest teaching language, all languages for HtDP are functional programming languages. In the 2004 paper, The Structure and Interpretation of the Computer Science Curriculum, a paper in which the authors compare and contrast HtDP with SICP. the authors distinguish the pedagogic focus of HtDP from that of SICP, and show how HtDP was designed as a textbook to address some problems that some students and teachers had with SICP. == Use in postsecondary education == Many colleges and schools have used HtDP in their classes, including: * University of Chicago, Chicago IL, United States * Northwestern University, Evanston IL, United States * Suffolk County Community College, (Ammerman Campus) Selden NY, United States * Adelphi University, Garden City NY, United States * University of California, Irvine, Irvine CA, United States * California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA, United States * Northeastern University, Boston MA, United States * Seton Hall University, South Orange NJ, United States * University of Delaware, Newark DE, United States * Westmont College, Santa Barbara CA, United States * Vassar College, Poughkeepsie NY, United States * Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester MA, United States * University of Notre Dame, South Bend IN, United States * University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada * National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), Mexico * Rhode Island College, Providence RI, United States * Pacific Union College, Angwin CA, United States * University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany * University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany * University of Dallas, Irving TX, United States * Indiana University, Bloomington IN, United States * Istanbul Bilgi University, Istanbul, Turkey * South Carolina State University, Orangeburg SC, United States * Berry College, Rome GA, United States * Monmouth College, Monmouth IL, United States * Manhattanville College, Purchase NY, United States * University of Minnesota, Morris, United States * University of British Columbia, Canada * Brown University, Providence RI, United States * Zefat Academic College, Israel * University of Chile, Chile * Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil == References == == External links == * , 2018 2nd edition, 2003 1st edition Category:2001 non-fiction books Category:Computer science books Category:MIT Press books ",
