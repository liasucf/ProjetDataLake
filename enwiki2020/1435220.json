It was established in 1951 by the Government of Ireland, to encourage interest in Irish art (including visual art, music, performance, and literature) and to channel funding from the state to Irish artists and arts organisations. This includes encouragement of traditional Irish arts, support for contemporary Irish arts, and finance for international arts events in Ireland. The council was modeled on the Arts Council of Great Britain, founded in 1946, and works closely with the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, formed by the British government in Northern Ireland in 1962 to fulfil a similar role. ==International policy== The Arts Council of Ireland is the official \"Cultural Contact Point\" between the EU Commission's Cultural Programme and Ireland.The Irish Times The Arts Council of Ireland is a founding member of the International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies.
