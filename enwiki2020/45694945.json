She then became the model for many painters, including Jean Ag\u00e9lou, Amedeo Modigliani and Chaim Soutine, who persuaded her to study painting and art history at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux- Arts. In March 1917, she met the Japanese artist Tsuguharu Foujita at the Caf\u00e9 de la Rotonde in Montparnasse, who fell madly in love with her and married her thirteen days later. In 1918 the couple moved to escape the German bombs to Cagnes-sur-Mer, where she spent a year painting and meeting many friends. During this period, she became friends with Jeanne H\u00e9buterne, the bride of Modigliani. When Modigliani died of tuberculosis in 1920, Barrey tried in vain to console the new widow, but Jeanne, eight months pregnant, committed suicide. During the year 1925, the couple led a very open relationship, both having relations with people of both sexes. The painter did not forgive Fernande after she had a love affair with his cousin, Koyanagi, a painter. He then locked himself with the Belgian artist Lucie Badoul (called Youki) for three days during which Fernande desperately sought her husband in the Parisian morgues. In 1928, the couple divorced and she lived with Koyanagi in Montmartre. When Koyanagi was separated himself in 1935, his relationship with Tsugouharu Foujita improved; he helped her financially until her death. Some sources link Fernande Barrey and the famous Miss Fernande, favourite model of the female photographer Jean Ag\u00e9lou, who appeared on many erotic postcards, although this has never been proven. As a painter, she exhibited the paintings Josiane and Les P\u00eaches at the Salon d'Automne in 1929. ==References== == Bibliography == * * Christian Bourdon et Jean-Pierre Bourgeron, Jean Ag\u00e9lou : de l\u2019acad\u00e9misme \u00e0 la photographie de charme, \u00c9ditions Marval, 2007. * * * * * * Category:1893 births Category:1974 deaths Category:People from Saint-Valery- sur-Somme Category:French artists' models Category:20th-century French painters Category:French women painters Category:French prostitutes Category:20th-century French women artists ",
