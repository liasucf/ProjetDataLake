Suzanne has two children with the photographer and is expecting a third which she cannot afford to keep. In order to help raise funds for an abortion, Pauline lies to her parents about a school trip, and when they find out, she leaves home and begins working as a singer. The photographer commits suicide and Suzanne moves away to live with her parents on their farm. The two women lose touch for ten years but are reunited at a demonstration in 1972 and begin to correspond by postcard. Pauline, now known as Pomme (French: Apple), moves to Iran with her boyfriend Darius (Ali Rafie), but becomes dissatisfied with her life there and returns to France. Suzanne leaves the farm and opens a family planning clinic in Hy\u00e8res, where she marries a local doctor. ==Production== ==External links== * * * *One Sings, the Other Doesn\u2019t: Bodies and Selves an essay by Amy Taubin at the Criterion Collection Category:1977 films Category:French films Category:1970s feminist films Category:1970s historical films Category:1970s high school films ",
