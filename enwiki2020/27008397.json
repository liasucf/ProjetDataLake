Arkansas elected seven constitutional officers, 17 of 35 state senate seats, all 100 house seats and 28 district prosecuting attorneys, and voted on one constitutional amendment and one referred question. Non-partisan judicial elections were held the same day as the party primaries for four Supreme Court justices, four appeals circuit court judges, and eight district court judges. ==Federal== === United States Senate=== Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Blanche Lincoln ran unsuccessfully for re-election against Republican John Boozman.

Lincoln faced Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter and narrowly won the primary contest. ====Democratic primary==== The Democratic primary was held on May 18, 2010, with early voting from May 3\u201317.
