    "text": "The third Cornell bear, Touchdown III Poster illustration of a Cornell baseball player, 1908. The Cornell Big Red is the informal name of the sports teams, and other competitive teams, that represent Cornell University, located in Ithaca, New York. The university sponsors 36 varsity sports, as well as numerous intramural and club teams. Cornell participates in NCAA Division I as part of the Ivy League. The men's and women's ice hockey teams compete in the ECAC Hockey League. Additionally, teams compete in the National Intercollegiate Women's Fencing Association, the Collegiate Sprint Football League, the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC), the Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges (EAWRC), the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association, and the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association (EIWA). ==History== Cornell's teams did not have an official name until after 1905, when a recent graduate, Romeyn Berry '04, wrote lyrics for a new football song. The lyrics included the words \"the big, red team,\" and the nickname stuck.Cornell Athletics \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions Cornell does not have an official mascot; however, the bear has long been a symbol of Cornell Athletics. In 1915, a live bear named Touchdown first appeared at football games to represent Cornell. The current version, which appears at many of Cornell's sporting events, is a brown bear costume (the live bear was replaced in 1939) that is worn by an undergraduate student; it is referred to as the \"Big Red Bear\" or by its nickname, \"Touchdown.\" And recently, \"red man,\" a person dressed in a tight red suit, has been seen running up and down the field of men's soccer games. Cornell's colors, carnelian red and white, date back to the university's Inauguration Day on October 7, 1868. Many of Cornell's athletic directors have made substantial contributions to collegiate athletics in general, including Romeyn Berry, James Lynah, and Robert Kane. Big Red sports are covered in the two campus publications, the Cornell Daily Sun and the Cornell Review, as well as on various blogs. === Fight songs === A number of fight songs are associated with Cornell sports teams, such as \"The Big Red Team\", \"Fight for Cornell\", and \"New Cornell Fight Song\", but the one with the longest use and tradition is \"Give My Regards to Davy\", a song written by three Cornellians in 1904. The song is sung to the tune of George M. Cohan's \"Give My Regards to Broadway\". == Sports sponsored == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" |- |- | Baseball || Basketball |- | Basketball || Cross country |- | Cross country || Equestrian |- | Football || Fencing |- | Golf || Field hockey |- | Ice hockey || Gymnastics |- | Lacrosse || Ice hockey |- | Polo || Lacrosse |- | Rowing (heavyweight) || Polo |- | Rowing (lightweight) || Rowing |- |Soccer|| Sailing |- | Sprint Football || Soccer |- | Squash || Softball |- | Swimming & diving || Squash |- | Tennis || Swimming & diving |- | Track and field\u2020 || Tennis |- | Wrestling || Track and field\u2020 |- | || Volleyball |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"\" | |} The sprint football team has won the CSFL title six times.

Other campus facilities include a Robert Trent Jones (a Cornell alumnus) designed golf course, baseball's Hoy Field, the Niemand\u2022Robison Softball Field, the Oxley Equestrian Center, and numerous fields and gymnasiums. Some of the athletic playing fields along Tower Road are known as the \"Alumni Fields\" because the Cornell Alumni Association funded the grading and development of these fields in exchange for a promise that they would remain in perpetuity. A subsequent land swap resulted in giving the Agriculture College building sites at the east end of the fields in exchange for the site of what became Schoellkopf Field and Hoy Field.Cornell Alumni News 1910-12-21 p. 146 The Alumni Fields became the site of an underground Synchrotron Laboratory.Retrieved 2007-09-09. Since the 1970s, several of the fields were used as sites for new biology buildings and were replaced by new fields along Jessup Road. Today, facilities are spread around campus with tennis courts and basketball courts located near a number of dormitories. In addition, the athletics department operates Helen Newman Hall (formerly the women's athletics building) and Noyes Center as remote fitness facilities. John Collyer Class of 1917 Boathouse The men's and women's crew programs are housed in the John Collyer Class of 1917 Boathouse and Doris B. Robison Boathouse on Cayuga Inlet. Both boathouses underwent an $8 million renovation in 2011. ==Rivalries== Cornell maintains informal athletic rivalries with other collegiate institutions. Cornell's principal rival is Harvard. The men's ice hockey team has a historic rivalry with Harvard that dates back to 1910 and includes many championship meetings. This rivalry was highlighted in the 1970 novel Love Story and its film adaptation. Following tradition, when Harvard plays the men's ice hockey team at Cornell's Lynah Rink, some Big Red fans throw fish on the ice. A historic rivalry with Boston University, dating back to when Cornell and Boston University played in ECAC Hockey before the creation of Hockey East, is maintained by biennial games at Madison Square Garden, dubbed \"Red Hot Hockey,\" on Thanksgiving weekend. Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania are long-time rivals in football. They have played each other in 122 games since their first meeting in 1893, this is the fifth most-played rivalry in college football. Cornell's football series against both the University of Pennsylvania and Dartmouth College are tied for second longest uninterrupted college football match-ups in history, both dating back to 1919. Cornell and Penn play for the Trustees Cup. They are only surpassed by the Lehigh-Lafayette series, which is uninterrupted since 1897. In polo, the men's and women's teams maintain rivalries with the University of Virginia and the University of Connecticut. Cornell\u2014Princeton lacrosse rivalry For men's lacrosse, Cornell and Princeton University have historically been the perennial favorites in the Ivy League and the Princeton game is usually the most anticipated Ivy-game. Fellow upstate schools Syracuse University and Hobart are also considered Cornell's lacrosse rivals. Additionally, in women's equestrian, Skidmore College is a constant rival. ==See also== * List of Cornell University alumni * Lynah Rink * Cornell\u2013Princeton lacrosse rivalry * Cornell\u2013Harvard hockey rivalry * Columbia\u2013Cornell football rivalry * Cornell\u2013Dartmouth football rivalry * Cornell\u2013Penn football rivalry ==References== ==External links== * ",
