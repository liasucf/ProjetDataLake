    "text": "The Limon Wind Energy Center is a 600.6 megawatt (MW) wind farm in eastern Colorado near the town of Limon. It became the largest wind facility in the state when construction completed in 2014. The electricity is being sold to Xcel Energy under long-term power purchase agreements. ==Facility details== The facility is located about 80 miles east of Denver. It was constructed in three phases, and extends across western Lincoln County and crosses a few miles into Elbert County. About 45 miles (72 km) of 345 kV transmission line connect the wind farm substations to the Xcel Energy substation near Deer Trail in Arapahoe County. Limon I and Limon II were constructed by Battner Energy, and came on line in late 2012. The 400 MW facility consists of twin 200 MW projects, each using 125 \u2013 GE 1.6 MW wind turbines that occupy more than 55,000 acres. Two new substations were also constructed. Limon III came into service in 2014 with an additional 200 MW of capacity. It consists of 118 \u2013 GE 1.7 MW wind turbines occupying over 49,600 acres. An approximately ten mile, 345 kV transmission line connects the Limon III substation to the Limon II substation. NextEra Energy Resources developed and financed, and continues to own and operate the facility. == Electricity production == {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center; font-size:0.9em; width:650px;\" |+Limon Wind Energy Center Generation (MW\u00b7h) |- !
