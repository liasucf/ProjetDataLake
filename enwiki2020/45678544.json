    "text": "Jamal Ja'far Muhammad Ali Al Ibrahim ( ', 1 July 1954 \u2013 3 January 2020), known by the kunya Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis (), also spelled Mohandes, was an Iraqi politician and military commander. At the time of his death, he was deputy chief of the Popular Mobilisation Committee (Al-Hashd Al-Sha'abi). The organisations he oversaw have been reported to have close links to the Quds Force, part of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Since 1977 he was a huge opponent to the Saddam Hussain and rose quickly in the ranks due to his popular support amongst the people after the regime fell. Muhandis enjoyed popular support among the Iraqi people prior to and after his death due to his exceptional role in the defeat of ISIS. He became the commander of many various popular volunteer militias that grew for the need to combat ISIS, including the Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah militia group. and prior to that worked with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps against the Saddam Hussein regime. Allegations of terrorism have been levelled against him over his activities in Kuwait in the 1980s. He was sentenced to death in absentia in 2007 by a court in Kuwait for his involvement in the 1983 Kuwait bombings. Muhandis was on the United States list of designated terrorists. See paragraph 5 of the report. However this has been disputed due to his role in combating the Ba\u2019ath regime rather than supporting it (via attacking Kuwait). The charges were dropped when the new Iraqi government was formed in 2004. He was killed by a targeted U.S. drone strike at Baghdad International Airport on 3 January 2020, which also killed Iranian Armed Forces Major General Qasem Soleimani. == Biography == Jamal Jaafar al-Ibrahimi was born on 1 July 1954 in Abu Al-Khaseeb District, Basra Governorate, Iraq, to an Iraqi father and an Iranian mother.
