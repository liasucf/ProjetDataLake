    "text": "The Women's Professional Billiards Championship was an English billiards tournament run by Burroughes and Watts in 1930, and from 1931 to 1950 by the Women's Billiards Association. Joyce Gardner won the tournament on seven of the fourteen times that it was held. ==History== Margaret Lennan beat Joyce Gardner 1000-960 at Hull in September 1928 in a match billed as the British Championship. Billiard manufacturers Howard and Powell provided a silver rose bowl for the winner. This match is omitted from records in the handbooks of the Billiards and Snooker Control Council. Lennan did not take part in the tournament established in 1930, until the 1935 championship. In 1930, the cue sports company Burroughes and Watts organised the British Women's Billiards Championship, also known as the Burwat Billiards Cup. The following year, 1931, the Women's Billiards Association was formed, and it was agreed that the Association would take over the running of the competition as a world championship, with the same trophy used in 1930. Joyce Gardner was champion each year until 1934, when Ruth Harrison won the first of her three titles. 1934 saw the first century break in the competition, a 100 by Gardner. Margaret Lennan made two centuries, 113 and then 153 in the 1936 competition. Ruth Harrison's break of 197 in 1937 remains a women's record in competitive billiards.World Ladies Billiards Champions World Billiards. Retrieved 19 August 2019. Thelma Carpenter won her first title in 1940, and was champion again when the tournament was next held in 1948. In 1950, she was watched by her 10-year-old son as she beat Joyce Gardner to win her fourth title. This was to be the last women's professional championship to be held to date, effectively making Carpenter the professional champion from 1940 to the present day. Although the tournament was billed as a \"World Championship,\" no players from outside the United Kingdom participated. The World Women's Billiards Championship is viewed as a continuation of the Amateur championship rather than of the Women's Professional Billiards Championship. ==Finals== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"text-align: center; background-color: #00af00\" | Year ! style=\"text-align: center; background-color: #00af00\" | Winner ! style=\"text-align: center; background-color: #00af00\" | Runner-up ! style=\"text-align: center; background-color: #00af00\" | Final score ! style=\"text-align: center; background-color: #00af00\" | Venue |- | 1930 | Joyce Gardner | Eva Collins | align = \"center\" | 1500-727 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | 1931 | Joyce Gardner | Eva Collins | align = \"center\" | 2000-1185 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | 1932 | Joyce Gardner | Ruth Harrison | align = \"center\" | 2000-1713 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | 1933 | Joyce Gardner | Ruth Harrison | align = \"center\" | 2000-1306 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | 1934 | Ruth Harrison | Joyce Gardner | align = \"center\" | 2000-1608 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | February 1935 | Ruth Harrison | Joyce Gardner | align = \"center\" | 3000-2708 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | November 1935 | Joyce Gardner | Margaret Lennan | align = \"center\" | 3000-2872 | align=\"left\"| Thurston's Hall, London |- | 1937 | Joyce Gardner | Ruth Harrison | align = \"center\" | 2223-2204 | align=\"left\"| Thurston's Hall, London |- | 1938 | Joyce Gardner | Thelma Carpenter | align = \"center\" | 2313-1824 | align=\"left\"| Thurston's Hall, London |- | 1939 | Ruth Harrison | Joyce Gardner | align = \"center\" |2559-1792 | align=\"left\"| Burroughes Hall, London |- | 1940 | Thelma Carpenter | Ruth Harrison | align = \"center\" | 2184-1641 | align=\"left\"| Thurston's Hall, London |- | 1941\u20131947 | align = \"center\" colspan = \"4\" rowspan= \"1\" | No tournament held |- | 1948 | Thelma Carpenter | Joyce Gardner | align = \"center\" | 2659-1670 | align=\"left\"| Leicester Square Hall, London |- | 1949 | Thelma Carpenter | Joyce Gardner | align = \"center\" | 3120-2518 | align=\"left\"| Leicester Square Hall, London |- | 1950 | Thelma Carpenter | Joyce Gardner | align = \"center\" | 1978-1374 | align=\"left\"| Leicester Square Hall, London |} ==Statistics by player== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align: center;\" |- !
