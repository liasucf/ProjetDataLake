He was of Pashtun originally from Afghanistan and was the son of Hayat Khan and the grandson of Taleh Khan. Amir Khan rose to be a military commander in the service of Yashwantrao Holkar of the Maratha Empire in 1798. In 1806, Khan received the state of Tonk from Yashwantrao Holkar of the Maratha Empire. While the Pindaris tended to concentrate on the east and south central Hindustan, Amir Khan and his Pathans concentrated on the north and Rajasthan. At the height of his power, he is said to have controlled a personal following of 8,000 cavalry, 10,000 infantry and up to 200 guns. The largest contingent amongst the Maratha chiefs, by far. After the defeat of the Rohillas in the Rohilla War of 1774\u20135 against the British, he fought against them. He had acquired the town and pargana of Tonk and the title of Nawab from Yashwantrao Holkar in 1806, and this area together with some other scattered parganas that he held, was combined with the pargana of Rampura (Aligarh) and erected into a new principality. Ultimately he established his rule in Tonk in 1806.Anil Chandra Banerjee The Rajput States and British Paramountcy 1980 - Page 71 \"During the years 1807-10 Amir Khan gradually made himself the most powerful man in Central India\" In 1817, after the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Amir Khan submitted to the British British East India Company, the Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief, The Marquess of Hastings, resolved to extinguish the Pindaris whom they deemed a menace. The Treaty of Gwalior severed the link between them and Scindia. Moreover, the treaty required the latter to join forces with the British to eliminate the Pindaris and Pathans. Bowing to the inevitable, Amir Khan assiduously came to terms with the British, agreeing to disband his men in return for a large stipend and recognition as a hereditary ruler. Amir Khan was recognized as hereditary nawab, disbanded his forces and quietly settled down to consolidating his little state. He became a faithful friend to the British, earning praise and consideration from successive pro- consuls. Amir Khan died in 1834. He was succeeded by his son Muhammad Wazir Khan (r. 1834\u20131864). ==See also== * Tonk (princely state) * Pindari * Pathans of Rajasthan ==References== ==External links== Category:1769 births Category:1834 deaths Category:Rohilla Category:Nawabs of Tonk Category:Nawabs of India Category:Indian Muslims Category:Indian people of Pashtun descent ",
