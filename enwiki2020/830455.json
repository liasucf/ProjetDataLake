    "text": "Klubi i Futbollit Tirana (KF Tirana) is an Albanian football club based in the country's capital city, Tirana. The men's football club is part of the multi- disciplinary sports club SK Tirana, and is the most successful in Albania, having won 52 recognized major domestic trophies. They play their home games at the Selman St\u00ebrmasi Stadium in Tirana and they play in the Kategoria Superiore. The club was founded on 15 August 1920 as Sport Klub Tirana (in English: Sport Club Tirana), but then, they name changed to Shoqata e Futbollit Agimi (in English: Agimi Footbll Association) and they had since participated in all the top tier national championships ever held in Albania. However, the ninth-place finish in the 2016-17 season relegated the club to the Albanian First Division (second-tier) for the first time in their history. They have competed under the name of SK Tirana between 1927 and 1947, when the communist regime forcibly renamed the club 17 N\u00ebntori Tirana, Puna Tirana and KS 17 N\u00ebntori. In 1991 KF Tirana retook its pre-1947 name and was divided into two branches, the multi disciplinary SK Tirana and the football branch of KF Tirana. KF Tirana is the most successful Albanian team in European competitions, having progressed from the first rounds on 13 occasions (once direcly by draw, without playing) since making their European debut in the 1965\u201366 European Cup. They reached Round of 16 in European Competitions four times, three such in the European Cup (now Champions League) alone in 1980s. The club also holds the record of being the highest ever ranking Albanian club according to IFFHS, having been ranked 31st in the world in 1987, following good results in their 1986\u201387 campaign. In addition, KF Tirana is an ECA member. ==History== ===1911: The first tournament=== Tirana appeared for the first time in 1911 in the Fier Fair Football Tournament, the first-ever championship held in Albania. The city was represented with what is believed to be the predecessor of KF Tirana. The team dominated the tournament, defeating Elbasani and Kavaja to make their way to the final, in which they won 6\u20131 against Peqini, making them Albania's first-ever champions. The tournament is not yet officially recognized by the Albanian Football Association. ===1920\u20131937: Beginnings of Klubi i Futbollit Tirana=== The first picture of the KF Tirana squad. Tirana was officially founded on 15 August 1920 by patriot and football enthusiast Palok\u00eb Nika, who had previously former Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr. The first name of the club was Sportklub Tirona which was later changed into Futboll Klub Tirona. The team played their first official match in October at Shallvare against Juventus Shkod\u00ebr. Tirana played their first international match against Yugoslav team Crnogorac Cetinje from Montenegro in 1925. On 16 August 1927, which was the seventh anniversary of the formation of the Agimi Sports Association, the club's name changed into Sportklub Tirana, which would be commonly referred to as SK Tirana.Kampionatet e koh\u00ebs s\u00eb Luft\u00ebs II Bot\u00ebrore On that day the president of the club was Teki Selenica. in 1930, Tirana took part in the first officially recognised football competition held in Albania, organized by newly founded Albanian Football Association. The team dominated the tournament, reaching the final after winning five matches, drawing four and losing just one, to finish joint top, along with Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb, albeit with a slightly better goal difference. Tirana faced in the championship final Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb, who refused to play as a sign of protest against the bias of the competition and the Albanian Football Association towards Tirana. The club was named champion after the games were awarded 2\u20130. The following season, the club introduced new players such as goalkeeper Vasfi Samimi, Sabit \u00c7oku, Muhamet Agolli and Halim Begeja. The championship format changed as it divided the teams into two groups. Tirana was placed in Group A and managed to finish 1st after collecting five points from three matches. In the final against Group B winners Teuta Durr\u00ebs, the team drew 1\u20131 in the first leg at home but managed a 3\u20130 win in the second one to retain the championship title. Tirana continued to dominate the Albanian football even in the next season, despite the fact that the championship format was changed once again. In a group where every club would play each other twice and the winner would be decided by who finished top of the league, Tirana had it easy as they finished the championship unbeaten, winning five matches and drawing three, winning the title for the third consecutive year, which further cemented their place in history as the first club to dominate football in Albania. The club lost the title for the first time in history in 1933, finishing in a disappointing third place out of six, behind Bashkimi Shkodran and the winners Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb. It turned out to be a transition period as team bounced back firmly in the 1934 Championship, finishing five points ahead of runners-up Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb in a seven team format. In the next years, Tirana managed to win the 1936 and 1937 championship, guided by ethnic-Albanian forward Riza Lushta who was named top goalscorer in both years. This was the last pre-World War II competition held by the Albanian Football Association as there was no championship held in 1938 and World War II broke out in 1939. ===1939\u20131947: War years=== In 1939, Albania was under Italian invasion; Giovanni Giro, a loyal trustee of Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano, was in charge of organising the first football competition under Victor Emmanuel III, which was called Turneja Komb\u00ebtare E Footbollit P\u00ebr Ndeshjet E Trofeut T\u00eb Liktorit (National Tour of Football for the Matches of the Lictor Trophy). Tirana participated in the tournament, eliminating 9\u20130 on aggregate Dragoj Pogradeci in the first round to reach the semi-finals. In the semi-final, the team played Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb, beating them 3\u20130 to reach the final against Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr. In the final played at the Shallvare field in the capital on 30 September 1939, Tirana won the trophy by winning 6\u20135. A similar tournament was held in the next year by the fascist regime, this time in a group format where teams were divided into two groups based on geography location. Two of Tirana's most important players Kryeziu and Lushta left Albania for Italy to join Bari and Roma respectively. In the first match, Tirana drew 2\u20132 with Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr, and then won 3\u20130 at home against Elbasani. The rest of the campaign did not prove to be fruitful as Vllaznia finished top of the group ahead of Tirana and reached the championship finals, where they defeated Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb 11\u20131 on aggregate to win their first national championship, to this day unrecognized by the Albanian Federal Association. The championship was not held in 1941 but returned in the following year, which also had three clubs from Kosovo. These clubs from Kosovo competed in the northern section along with the reigning champions Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr and Tirana competed in the new middle section group and the southern clubs competed in their own group. In a bizarre ruling, only players born between 1921 and 1925 were allowed to participate in the competition, meaning that only players between the ages of 17 and 22 were allowed to play. However, this rule was not followed by most clubs and senior players did participate in the competition. Tirana reached the semi-finals after winning 5\u20131 versus Elbasani and drawing 1\u20131 against Teuta Durr\u00ebs. In the semi-final, the team faced Prizreni; the first leg ended in a 2\u20132 draw while the second one was won by Tirana 2\u20131. The team thus reached the final once again where they faced Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr on 29 June. The regular time ended in a 1\u20131 draw, leading the Italian referee Michele Carone then asked both sides to play extra time of two 15-minute halves, but Vllaznia declined. Two days after the final had been played the match was awarded 2\u20130 to Tirana along with the title. The club won two out of the three National Championships that were held during World War II, but in March 2013, Albanian Football Association made a decision by refusing to recognize them, stating that they were not legitimate, since they weren't organized by the AFA, but by the fascist regime. ===1944\u20131957: Postwar period=== Myslym Alla, coached Tirana from 1956 to 1972. Following the end of World War II, footballing activities resumed as they had done before the war under the guidance of the Albanian Football Association. In the championship of 1945, Tirana was placed in Group B. The team topped the group easily, collecting 16 points from 10 matches, thus reaching the final where they faced Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr once again. They lost both matches 2\u20131, thus missing the opportunity to win another championship. Under communist regime led by dictator Enver Hoxha, Tiran would quickly become a victim as in early March 1946 the ruling communist Politburo had instructed the club to change its name to 17 N\u00ebntori in honour of the Liberation of Tirana which took place on 17 November 1944. In the following decade, the club was subject to appalling treatment by the regime, and this was highlighted by the creation of a privilege system for the newly created communist backed teams Partizani Tirana and Dinamo Tirana. The following decade would unroll in the same suffocating atmosphere, becoming even heavier after the foundation of two system-privileged teams that would follow the experiences of their sisters in the former USSR, former Yugoslavia, and the other eastern European countries: Partizani, the Defense Ministry team and Dinamo, the Internal Affairs Ministry team. Dozens of Tirana's talented players were \"convinced\", against their will, to play for either Partizani or Dinamo. As a result, \"17 Nentori\" struggled to stay at the top during the years 1947\u201357, however the team managed to gain some of the lost ground during the second part of the 1950s after replacing in part some of the first choice players of its line up. === 1958\u20131990: Decline and revival, communist decades and the golden 80s === From 1958 to 1964 Tirana kept on producing some good football and finishing the championship almost always at the third spot. These years were a prelude to what was about to happen later: Tirana reexperienced its pre-war glory spell under the services of the unforgettable coach Myslym Alla. At the end of the 28th national championship Tirana became champions of Albania more than twenty years after their last title. The team repeated the success the year after, but this was an obvious challenge to Partizani's generals and Dinamo's secret service bosses. After having practically won the 1966\u201367 title three matches in advance, Tirana was banned from the competition and the title was assigned to Dinamo. After this, Tirana won the championship two years in a row in style, losing only two matches in 1968 and only one during the 1969\u201370 season. During the seventies, Tirana struggled hard to stay at the top, the best result being the second place and the worst the thirteenth. Yet the club won the national cup twice. The generation of older players came to the end of their careers and this could only mark the end of a highly successful era. However the unsuccessful spell would not last long this time. Tirana won the championship at the end of the 1981\u201382 season, and they went on to win the title three other times during the eighties, in 1984\u201385, 1987\u201388 and 1988\u201389 and the Albanian Cup in 1982\u201383, 1983\u201384 and 1985\u201386. The club was also successful in European club competitions, reaching there the round of 16 four times in the 1980s, alone in the European Cup three times. Many of the team's players made up the core of the Albania national football team, such as Agustin Kola, Arben Minga, Shk\u00eblqim Mu\u00e7a and Mirel Josa. ===1991\u20132006: Return to success=== In August 1991, less than a year following the fall of communism in Albania, Tirana regained its old name, and likewise the whole Albanian society, went through a period of profound changes. Almost all the best Albanian players left the country and went abroad looking for a richer team who could hire them. But it seems that the club simply could not stand being too long from the leading spots. The team returned to the winning ways by winning the Albanian Cup in the 1993\u201394 season, defeating 1\u20130 on aggregate Teuta Durr\u00ebs. Shortly after, in January 1995, the team won also their first Albanian Supercup trophy, defeating 1\u20130 Teuta Durr\u00ebs at Qemal Stafa Stadium. A couple of months later, they clinched their 15th championship by finishing 12 points ahead of the runner-up Teuta Durr\u00ebs. This championship was followed by another one in the 1995\u201396 season, as Tirana won it just one point ahead of Teuta Durr\u00ebs once again. The team also clinched the cup in that season, completing the domestic double for the second time in history. Another domestic double followed in 1998\u201399 season. In the following years, Tirana continued to dominate the Albanian football, winning 10 out of the last 18 Albania's championships. The team also dominated in the domestic cups, adding to their trophy cabinet three Albanian Cups and five other Albanian Supercups. ===2007\u2013present: Refik Halili era=== Elvis Sina, most-capped player in the history of Tirana with more than 500 appearances in all competitions. Following a successful 2006\u201307 campaign which saw the club win the Albanian Superliga comfortably, the team begun to struggle for results. They begun the season by getting eliminated from the UEFA Champions League by NK Dom\u017eale. Despite winning the Albanian Supercup versus Besa Kavaj\u00eb, Tirana managed only a 6th-place finish their worst finish since 1993. In cup, the team lost the final to Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr. In the following season, Tirana bounced back; inspired by striker Migen Memelli, who went on to score 30 goals, Tirana managed to win the championship for the 24th time in history. In cup they reached another final, only to be defeated again, this time by Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb. In the next years, Tirana experiences mixed fortunes, being unable to win the championship but remaining on top in domestic cups, winning the Albanian Cup in 2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312, and three other Albanian Supercups in 2009, 2011 and 2012. There was also major controversies off the field between club's chief and president in the 2010\u201311 season, which led to a delay in paying the players' wages and even some players not receiving their wages. On 12 October 2011, Municipality of Tirana city council voted through a unanimous decision to change the status of the club from a municipality owned to a shareholder own one, under the name KF Tirana Sh.A, with the municipality of Tirana initially holding a 100% stake in the club but with the possibility of any future private sponsors and donors to own stocks in the club. Starting from 2013, Tirana entered in a period of disappointments. In the 2013\u201314 season, the team was seriously in risk of getting relegated for the first time in history. By the end of December 2013 the team was ranked in the last position with only 10 points from 13 matches, 7 points away from the safe zone. However, with Gugash Magani as manager and a strong transfer market, the team bounced back and eventually finished in 6th position, escaping the relegation only in the penultimate match. On 26 June 2014, the Tirana city council approved a proposal to give private donors a 66% stake in the club's assets for the next 18 years, which at the time fell in the hands of Refik Halili and Lulzim Morina, which enabled such donors to invest in players, facilities and youth teams. Selman St\u00ebrmasi Stadium was renovated between 2014 and 2015. Tirana begun the 2014\u201315 season with high expectations, challenging for the title in the first part of the season. In the second part, however, the team declined and ultimately finished in 5th position. In cup, Tirana was controversially eliminated from La\u00e7i in the semi-final 1\u20130 on aggregate. La\u00e7i eventually won the final against Kuk\u00ebsi, leaving Tirana without Europa League football once again. The club was relegated during the 2016\u201317 season. From title contender halfway through the season, Tirana fell continuously to dramatically succumb to relegation for the first time in their history. Ilir Daja was sacked on 1 November following a goalless draw against Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr, and was replaced by the returned Mirel Josa. The club also broke the relationship with the fans after allowing with their lifetime rivals Partizani Tirana to play at Selman St\u00ebrmasi Stadium; they opposed such an agreement and subsequently abandoned the matches for the entire season as a result. Tirana then endured a 15 winless match streak before winning 2\u20130 against Korabi Peshkopi. Their relegation was officially confirmed on 27 May following a goalless draw versus fellow relegation strugglers Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr. In cup, Tirana did much better, winning their 16th trophy on 31 May after defeating 3\u20131 Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb at Elbasan Arena. This meant the return of Tirana in European competitions after five years. Tirana retained most of their players ahead of the new season. The club appointed former Brazil international Z\u00e9 Maria as the new manager. The team eliminated from the UEFA Europa League by Israel's Maccabi Tel Aviv In September 2017, Tirana won another trophy, their 11th Albanian Supercup after winning 1\u20130 against Kuk\u00ebsi. They also set a record by becoming the Albanian First Division side to win the Supercup. In the league Tirana dominated with hammering results in either home or away matches. Club's goal of a quick promotion in Superliga was reached with three spare rounds to play. Tirana won their first ever Albanian First Division title on 16 May by winning 2\u20130 against the Group A winners Kastrioti Kruj\u00eb. Tirana won the 25th championship in the 2019\u201320 season which was also the club's 100th anniversary. It was the first title after 11 years. During the season the team recorded two wins against Partizani, ending the negative record of 18 winless matches against them; the 5\u20131 win in February 2020 was the biggest since 2005. Ndubuisi Egbo took charge of the team starting in the 13th matchday; he was highly praised for his work and also become the first African coach to win a league title in Europe. In cup, the team managed to reach the final but was defeated 2\u20130 by Teuta. ==Grounds== ===Shallvare (1920\u201346)=== The club's first home ground was the Shallvare, located in the centre of Tirana where today is the existing Shallvare block, acquired by the club prior to their formation in 1920. The also field served as an amusement centre for the youth of Tirana to enjoy, and it was a popular gathering place where various games were played during religious holidays. Before its use as a football ground the site was use by the Ottoman garrison as a playground, and in 1916 it served as a runway for the Austrian-Hungarian Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops. The club played their first game at the Shallvare in 1920 against a team made up of the occupying Austrian-Hungarians. In 1925 there were changing rooms built at the ground, and in the early 1930s there was an athletics track built around the football pitch. The administrator of the ground was the football referee, Besim Hamdiu (Qorri), who only had one assistant in the maintenance of the ground. The ground did not have a main stand or seating area for spectators, but rather a two storied building that was constructed in 1923 by a member of parliament Masar K\u00eblli\u00e7i . The building stood 50 metres away from the football pitch and was located in line with the middle of the pitch, with its balcony facing the field and the Dajt mountains. The ground was also used for other sporting events as well as military parades, one of which the president and later king Ahmet Zogu attended in 1927. The ground was destroyed in 1951 and Soviet\u2013style apartment blocks were built onto of it instead.Fusha e Shallvares, fusha e par\u00eb sportive zyrtare n\u00eb TiranaNa ishin nj\u00ebher\u00eb fushat sportive t\u00eb Tiranas ===Qemal Stafa Stadium (1946\u20132015)=== The home ground of KF Tirana is Selman St\u00ebrmasi Stadium, which is shared with city rivals Dinamo Tirana and Partizani Tirana. However, most derby and significant matches are played at the national team's Qemal Stafa Stadium; the stadium is also used if the Selman St\u00ebrmasi Stadium is unavailable as it is used by three different teams. The club has expressed its desire to rebuild the current Selman St\u00ebrmasi Stadium into a modern complex with around 15,000 to 20,000 seats. They want it to be Albania's first modern post-Communism stadium without an athletic track around the field, which they hope will provide more atmosphere and attract more fans. However, it has not yet been decided when this will be built but it is rumoured to be the club's 100th anniversary present in 2020.New stadium plans (in Albanian) ===Selman St\u00ebrmasi Stadium (1956\u2013present)=== Selman St\u00ebrmasi Stadium in its inaugural match. KF Tirana plays most of its official and friendly games at the Selman St\u00ebrmasi Stadium in Tirana. The Selman St\u00ebrmasi Stadium was built in 1956 and was previously named the 'Dinamo' Stadium till 1991 when it was permanently given its new name. The Football Association of Albania and the club decided to name the stadium post mortem after the eminent KF Tirana player, coach and president, Selman St\u00ebrmasi. The stadium has a capacity of 12,500 (8,400 seated). In December 2014, another phase of reconstruction was started, involving a new pitch, central main covered stand, central fans stand including two extra rows extension, broken or missing seats replacements/repairs, interior facilities, general lineaments and a shopping center just under central seated. The internal facilities include general repairs, a press conference room, journalists' corner and modern showers. The side fans stands will temporary be shut and covered by advertising boards. It is still unclear when will stadium scoreboard and clock be fitted. The main parking area is located at the front of the stadium, which leads to the entrance. The whole external part of the stadium is surrounded by a 2.7 M (9 ft) rail fence. ===Sk\u00ebnder Halili Complex=== The club's training ground is called the Sk\u00ebnder Halili Complex and it is located off Rruga e Kavaj\u00ebs, near the Birra Tirana factory. The training complex was posthumously named after Sk\u00ebnder Halili, who was one of the club's most notable associates, both during his playing career and after. The complex features a full sized natural grass football pitch, as well as a smaller astro turf fan along with dressing rooms used by senior team as well as some of the youth teams. In December 2014 work began on both the Sk\u00ebnder Halili Complex and the Selman St\u00ebrmasi Stadium in order to fully renovate these grounds to be used by the club, and at the training ground the training facilities were all improved which included the dressing rooms and even the single stand that holds a small number of spectators for those wishing to attend training sessions and even occasional friendlies that are played at the ground. ==Supporters== Tirana is considered to be one of the most supported football clubs in Albania, and its supporters also formed the first Ultras group in the country in 1986 called Ultras Tirona. The group was forced to operate illegally as the communist regime did not allow such organised groups to function. However, despite this, its supporters used games as an outlet to show their dissent against the regime in place and following the fall of communism in Albania they became more organised and attracted more supporters in the late 90s and early 2000s. During the mid 2000s, younger supporters began to emerge on the scene and felt that the older Ultras Tirona did not entirely represent them, which led to the younger supporters forming a new Ultras group called the Tirona Fanatics on 8 January 2006.Saisonfinale auf Albanisch \u2013 Fussball \u2013 Blickhttp://www.sktirana.com/public/kuvend/viewtopic.php?f=2&t;=466 (in Albanian)Giovanni Armillotta: \"Drejt njohjes s\u00eb tre Kampionate Komb\u00ebtare t\u00eb Luft\u00ebs: 1939, 1940 dhe 1942\" Tirona Fanatics are widely regarded as a right wing tifo-group, whereas Ultras Guerrils are mostly associated with the left due to their history. The group quickly rose in membership and became the most organised supporters group in Albania, following Tirana home and away, including European games. On 20 May 2015 the majority of the founding members of Tirona Fanatics decided to hand over the management of the group to younger supporters.Ndryshim brezash n\u00eb drejtimin e \u201cTirona Fanatics\u201d The group has partnerships with Macedonian group Shvercerat of FK Shkupi ===Rivalries=== The fans have three main rivals. Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr, the oldest derby in the country, with the matches between them called the All-time Albanian derby. The other rivalries are the Tirana derbies with Dinamo Tirana and Partizani Tirana. However, since 2010s, they have developed a fierce rivalry with Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb since the latter side's rise to prominence. ==Players== ===Current squad=== ===Other players under contract=== ===KF Tirana B=== Klubi i Futbollit Tirana B is an Albanian football club based in Tiran\u00eb. It was founded in 1932, but was dissolved before it was refounded again on 22 January 2013. ===Reserves and academy=== The KF Tirana Reserves and Academy (Albanian: Klubi i Futbollit Tirana Rezervat) are the reserve team of KF Tirana, They play in the North section of the Albanian U-19 Superliga and Albanian U-17 Superliga. ===Retired numbers=== \u2013 Since the start of 2014\u201315 season, Tirana retired the number 12 as a recognition towards the Tirona Fanatics, the club's biggest fanbase, considered the 12th man in the pitch. ==Honours== Tirana are the most successful and decorated club in Albania, having won 25 league titles, a national record. The club's first trophy was also the first Albanian National Championship, held in 1930, which was also the first official football competition in the country.

They reached Round of 16 in European Competitions four times, of which three times in the European Cup (now Champions League) alone in 1980s, making it the Albanian team to have progressed farthest in any European competition. White and blues hold the all-time record for the highest IFFHS ranking of an Albanian football club, being ranked as high as 31st in the world in 1987, as result of good results preceded 1986\u201387. In their European path, Tirana have played against \"big guns\" such as: Ajax, Bayern Munich, AC Milan, etc. Drawn against good squads such as Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti, Ferencv\u00e1ros, CSKA Sofia, Stab\u00e6k IF, Utrecht, Dinamo Zagreb, IFK G\u00f6teborg, Malm\u00f6 FF, Standard Li\u00e8ge, Red Star Belgrade, etc. In several occasions, respectable European names such as: Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti, Dinamo Tbilisi, Gorica, NK Varteks, etc., have been eliminated from white and blues. In the 2004\u201305 season, after having easily passed FC Gomel of Belarus in the first round, KF Tirana played against Ferencv\u00e1ros in the second round. Having lost the first leg 3\u20132 at home, Tirana led 1\u20130 in Budapest; however, they were unable to score the one extra goal they needed, having missed a penalty and hit the woodwork twice, and were eliminated on away goals, the tie finishing 3\u20133 on aggregate. ===European performance table=== {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" |- !
