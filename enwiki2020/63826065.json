He notably served in Suffren's squadron during the Anglo-French War. == Biography == Du Pas joined the Navy as a Garde-Marine on 19 January 1757. He was promoted to Lieutenant on 4 April 1777, and to Captain on 15 September 1782. La R\u00e8gle arrived in the Indian Ocean with the first wave of reinforcements set there after Suffren took command of the squadron, as first officer on the 74-gun Illustre under Captain Bruy\u00e8res-Chalabre. He later captained the 64-gun Ajax. In the run-up to the Battle of Trincomalee, on 25 August 1782, Du Pas led four companies of marines to lay siege to the forts of Trincomalee. On 9 February 1783, Suffren appointed him to the command of the 64-gun Ajax. He was killed at his station during the battle, as Ajax was bearing to HMS Inflexible. After the war, Bruy\u00e8res was praised by Bruy\u00e8res, and he was amongst the captains that Suffren recommended for promotion. He received a 600-livre pension in recognition of his service. == Sources and references == Notes References Bibliography * * Category:French Navy officers ",
