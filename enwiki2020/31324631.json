    "text": "Thomas Drue or Drewe (c.1586\u20131627) was an English Protestant playwright. He wrote The Life of the Duchess of Suffolk. It has also been suggested that he wrote The Bloody Banquet (By T. D.,\u2019 1620, 4to).,p.240-241, Cecilie Goff, A Woman of the Tudor Age However others have attributed it to Thomas Dekker and Thomas Middleton. An unpublished play, the \u2018Woman's Mistake,\u2019 is ascribed in the \u2018Stationers' Registers,\u2019 9 Sept. 1653, to Robert Davenport and Drue. Possibly the dramatist may be the Thomas Drewe who in 1621 translated and published Daniel Ben Alexander, the converted Jew, first written in Syriacke and High Dutch by himselfe. ==The Life of Katherine Willoughby, the Duchess of Suffolk== Drue is the author of a historical play, \u2018The Life of the Dvtches of Svffolke,\u2019 1631, 4to, which has been wrongly attributed by Gerard Langbaine and others to Thomas Heywood. The play was published anonymously, but it is assigned to Drue in the \u2018Stationers Registers\u2019 (under date 13 November 1629) and in Sir Henry Herbert's \u2018Office-book.\u2019 This play was first produced during a period in which James I was active in suppressing criticism of his foreign policy, particularly the attempt to marry the future Charles I to the Catholic Maria Anna of Spain. The play was staged by the Palsgrave's Men, a theatre troupe sponsored by Frederick of the Palatinate. Drawing on the flight and exile of Catherine Willoughby, one of the Marian exiles, Drue further embellished the story recorded in Foxe's Book of Martyrs, making the story closer to that of Frederick's wife Elizabeth of Bohemia, James I's daughter. In this way the play highlighted the plight of Elizabeth, who had been forced into exile from the Palatinate following the defeat of the Protestant cause at the Battle of White Mountain. ==References== * Category:1586 births Category:1627 deaths Category:English Renaissance dramatists Category:17th- century male writers Category:17th-century English dramatists and playwrights ",
