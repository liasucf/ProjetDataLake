The RedHawks recovered their second on-side kick with four seconds left but Raudabaugh's was intercepted to end the game. ===Vanderbilt=== Miami lost to Vanderbilt of the Southeastern Conference by the score of 24\u201313. Three straight Vanderbilt turnovers in the second quarter allowed Miami to lead 13\u201310 midway through the third quarter. Miami's only touchdown came when quarterback Daniel Radabaugh connected with Jamal Rogers for a 40-yard touchdown pass with 6:16 left in 2nd quarter.

The Bulls were led by James Starks who finished with 154 yards on 19 carries and quarterback Drew Willy who completed 33 of 45 passes for 217 yards. ===Akron=== Coming into the game Miami was tied with Buffalo for first place in the Mid-American Conference East Division. The RedHawks hold all the tiebreaker advantages and would represent the East in the MAC Championship Game by winning their final two regular-season games or a Buffalo loss. Coach Montgomery's main concern coming into the game was how to contain the Zips offense, led by sophomore tailbacks Alex Allen and Bryan Williams along with the senior wide receiver Jabari Arthur. The defensive game plan had to take into account two different styles of play depending on who was playing quarterback for the Zips. The Zips could play either Chris Jaquemain, who is more of a passing quarterback or Carlton Jackson who is more of a running quarterback. Miami prevailed 7\u20130 in a game dominated by defense. Neither offence scored during the game, with Miami's touchdown coming on the defensive side of the ball. RedHawks defensive lineman Craig Mester picked up a fumble midway through the fourth quarter and rumbled seven yards for the only score. The costly turnover came shortly after University of Akron coach J. D. Brookhart replaced Chris Jacquemain with Carlton Jackson because Akron had struggling to move the ball consistently. On a third-and-13 at Zips 20-yard line Jackson dropped back to pass and was pressured by Miami's Clayton Mullins, who forced the fumble. Mester scooped up the ball and became the hero for the RedHawks. Miami outgained Akron 320 yard to 216 yard but was hampered by four turnovers. Miami's Daniel Raudabaugh was responsible had three interceptions in back-to-back-to-back possessions spanning the second and third quarters. All three were intercepted in the endzone. The game marked the first Miami shutout since a 49\u20130 victory against Indiana State in 2004. And the first MAC shutout since a 49\u20130 win against Buffalo in 2002. ===Ohio U=== Coming into the game Miami had already clinched a spot in the Mid-American Conference Championship game due to a Bowling Green victory over Buffalo a week earlier. With a victory of over Ohio, Miami could have clinched outright possession of the Mid-American Conference East Division and a bowl bid. For the second straight week the RedHawks' defense had to prepare for a team with a running quarterback (Theo Scott) and a passing quarterback (Brad Bower). The RedHawks led 17\u20137 at halftime. Ohio switched quarterbacks for the second half, replacing Theo Scott with Brad Bower, and scored three quick touchdowns to take a 28\u201317 lead. Two of the touchdowns were help by great field position because of two interceptions thrown by Danial Raudabaugh on Miami's first two position of the second half. Miami's Nathan Parseghian tied a school record with five field goals, with the RedHawks unable to push the ball in the endzone in the second half. For the game Miami outgained the Bobcats 379 to 199 yards but Ohio's placekicker Michael Braunstein sealed the victory for Ohio with a 40-yard field goal that gave Ohio a 38\u201329 lead with 2:26 remaining. ===MAC Championship Game: Central Michigan=== Central Michigan quarterback Dan LeFevour ran for 170 yards and threw for 185, leading the Chippewas to a 35\u201310 over Miami for their second straight Mid-American Conference championship. Miami's defense was able to contain LeFevour in the first half, but Miami's offense wasn't able to take advantage. Miami only scored one touchdown, a 12-yard pass from Daniel Raudabaugh to Armand Robinson with 9:09 left in the game to shave CMU's lead to 11 points (21\u201310). Central answered with two more touchdowns, a 7-yard run by Ontario Sneed and a 28-yard run by LeFevour. ==Post season== ===Awards=== *Clayton Mullins, Mid-American Conference Defensive Player of the Year, First-team All-Mid-American Conference outside linebacker *Joey Hudson \u2013 Second-team All-Mid-American Conference inside linebacker *Dave DiFranco \u2013 Third-team All-Mid-American Conference offensive lineman *Joe Coniglio \u2013 Third-team All-Mid-American Conference down lineman *Jake Richardson \u2013 Third-team All-Mid-American Conference punter ==References== Miami Category:Miami RedHawks football seasons Miami RedHawks football ",
