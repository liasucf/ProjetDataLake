Directed by Richard Rush, the film stars Bruce Willis and Jane March. The cast also features Ruben Blades, Lesley Ann Warren, Brad Dourif, Lance Henriksen, Kevin J. O'Connor and Scott Bakula. It is one of two well-known works by director Rush, the other being The Stunt Man 14 years before. Color of Night flopped at the box office and won a Golden Raspberry Award as the worst film of 1994. Nonetheless, it became one of the 20 most-rented films in the United States home video market in 1995.Billboard vol 108 #1 p.54. Maxim magazine also singled the film out as having the best sex scene in film history. In 2018, Kino Lorber (under license from Disney) released a special edition Blu- ray of the film; it contains an audio commentary by director Richard Rush. ==Plot== Dr. Bill Capa, a New York psychiatrist, falls into a deep depression after an unstable patient dies by suicide in front of him by jumping from his office window. The sight of the bloody body clad in a bright green dress causes Bill to suffer from psychosomatic color blindness, taking away his ability to see the color red. Bill travels to Los Angeles to stay with a friend, fellow therapist Dr. Bob Moore, who invites him to sit in on a group therapy session. However, Bob is violently murdered in the office and Bill is plunged into the mystery of his friend's death. Lt. Hector Martinez considers everyone in Moore's therapy group, including Bill, as suspects in the murder. Bill continues to live in Bob's house and begins an affair with Rose, a beautiful but mysterious young woman who comes and goes. Bill takes the therapy group, which includes; Clark, a temperamental OCD sufferer, Sondra, a nymphomaniac and kleptomaniac, Buck, a suicidal ex-cop, Casey, who paints sado-masochist images, and Richie, a 16-year old with social anxiety and a history of drug use. After Casey is found violently murdered, Bill becomes the target of several attempts on his life. He discovers that all but one of his patients have been romantically involved with Rose. He eventually learns that \"Richie\" is really Rose, and the murders were the work of her deranged brother, Dale. They once had an actual brother named Richie, who was molested by his child psychiatrist along with Dale. After Richie committed suicide, Dale abused Rose into playing the part of their brother. Rose began to re- emerge during therapy and, under another personality named \"Bonnie\", started relationships with the other patients. Dale proceeded to kill them, fearing that they would soon link Rose to Richie. Bill confronts them and is overpowered by Dale, who is about to kill him with a nail gun but is instead killed by Rose. Deeply traumatized, she then tries to commit suicide. Bill is able to stop her, bookending the story with two suicide attempts, one at the beginning, resulting in Bill's loss of color vision, and one at the end, thwarted and resulting in his regaining it. ==Cast== *Bruce Willis as Bill Capa *Jane March as Rose *Ruben Blades as Martinez *Lesley Ann Warren as Sondra *Scott Bakula as Bob Moore *Brad Dourif as Clark *Lance Henriksen as Buck *Kevin J. O'Connor as Casey *Eriq La Salle as Anderson *Andrew Lowery as Dale *Kathleen Wilhoite as Michelle *Jeff Corey as Ashland *Shirley Knight as Edith Niedelmeyer ==Release== Richard Rush turned his cut of the film over to producer Andrew Vajna in late 1993. Vajna was concerned about the film's commercial prospects and demanded a recut, something Rush refused. Nonetheless, Vajna mandated he had final cut per contractual obligation, and insisted on testing his own version of the film. After both versions were given a number of test screenings, Vajna determined that his cut would be released and fired Rush in April 1994. This ultimately escalated into a battle between Rush and Vajna that received coverage in the Los Angeles trades. Rush commented that his version tested higher than Vajna's cut; his statements were defended in Variety and by film critic Bill Arnold, who attended a test screening of Rush's version in Seattle, Washington. The Los Angeles Times, meanwhile, defended Vajna, stating that Rush stubbornly refused any input from the studio. The Directors Guild of America attempted to intervene on the matter. The battle ultimately ended when Rush suffered a near-fatal heart attack and became hospitalized. Months later, after Rush recovered, he compromised with Vajna that the producer's cut would be released theatrically and that the director's cut would see a video release. Eventually, four versions were released: *The R-Rated theatrical release form the USA *The international theatrical release *The R-Rated Director's Cut *The Unrated Director's Cut (Among them, international theatrical release version also contains numerous scenes that are not included in the Unrated Director's Cut.) ==Reception== ===Critical response=== The film received mostly negative reviews around the time of its release. Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gave it a score of 22% based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 3.98/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Bruce willie shot aside, the only other things popping out in Color of Night are some ridiculous plot contortions and majorly camp moments\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale. Referring to the film as \"memorably bizarre,\" Janet Maslin in her August 19, 1994 The New York Times review wrote: \"The enthusiastically nutty Color of Night has the single-mindedness of a bad dream and about as much reliance on everyday logic.\" She also cited the revelation of the murderer, \"whose disguise won't fool anyone, anywhere.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \"I was, frankly, stupefied. To call it absurd would be missing the point, since any shred of credibility was obviously the first thing thrown overboard. It's so lurid in its melodrama and so goofy in its plotting that with just a bit more trouble, it could have been a comedy.\" Luke Y. Thompson of The New Times praised March's performance and wrote: \"Minority opinion here, I know, but I found the sex scenes hot and March's performance truly impressive.\" Brian McKay of eFilmCritic.com stated the film was a \"Mediocre L.A. noir thriller made more tolerable by Jane March disrobing frequently.\" Ken Hanke of the Mountain Xpress (Asheville, North Carolina) wrote the film was \"Underrated, but far from great.\" The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made. ===Box office=== The film opened at #4, grossing $6,610,488 its opening weekend playing at a total of 1,740 theaters. The film ended up a box office failure, grossing only $19,750,470\u2014far below its $40 million production budget.
