    "text": "Hippopede (red) given as the pedal curve of an ellipse (black). The equation of the hippopede is 4x2+y2=(x2+y2)2. In geometry, a hippopede (from Ancient Greek \u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03ad\u03b4\u03b7, \"horse fetter\") is a plane curve determined by an equation of the form :(x^2+y^2)^2=cx^2+dy^2, where it is assumed that and since the remaining cases either reduce to a single point or can be put into the given form with a rotation. Hippopedes are bicircular rational algebraic curves of degree 4 and symmetric with respect to both the x and y axes. ==Special cases== When d > 0 the curve has an oval form and is often known as an oval of Booth, and when the curve resembles a sideways figure eight, or lemniscate, and is often known as a lemniscate of Booth, after 19th-century mathematician James Booth who studied them. Hippopedes were also investigated by Proclus (for whom they are sometimes called Hippopedes of Proclus) and Eudoxus. For , the hippopede corresponds to the lemniscate of Bernoulli. ==Definition as spiric sections== Hippopedes with a = 1, b = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0. Hippopedes with b = 1, a = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0. Hippopedes can be defined as the curve formed by the intersection of a torus and a plane, where the plane is parallel to the axis of the torus and tangent to it on the interior circle. Thus it is a spiric section which in turn is a type of toric section. If a circle with radius a is rotated about an axis at distance b from its center, then the equation of the resulting hippopede in polar coordinates : r^2 = 4 b (a - b \\sin^{2} \\theta) or in Cartesian coordinates :(x^2+y^2)^2+4b(b-a)(x^2+y^2)=4b^2x^2. Note that when a > b the torus intersects itself, so it does not resemble the usual picture of a torus. ==See also== * List of curves ==References== *Lawrence JD.
