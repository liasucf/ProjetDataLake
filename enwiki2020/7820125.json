    "text": "Asha (; also arta ; Avestan:\ud802\udf00\ud802\udf34\ud802\udf00 a\u1e63\u030ca/arta) is a Zoroastrian concept with a complex and highly nuanced range of meaning. It is commonly summarized in accord with its contextual implications of 'truth' and 'right(eousness)', 'order' and 'right working'... For other connotations, see meaning below. It is of cardinal importance. to Zoroastrian theology and doctrine. In the moral sphere, a\u1e63\u030ca/arta represents what has been called \"the decisive confessional concept of Zoroastrianism\". qtd. in . The opposite of Avestan a\u1e63\u030ca is \ud802\udf1b\ud802\udf2d\ud802\udf0e\ud802\udf18 druj, \"deceit, falsehood\". Its Old Persian equivalent is arta-. In Middle Iranian languages the term appears as ard-. The word is also the proper name of the divinity Asha, the Amesha Spenta that is the hypostasis or \"genius\". of \"Truth\" or \"Righteousness\". In the Younger Avesta, this figure is more commonly referred to as Asha Vahishta (A\u1e63\u030ca Vahi\u0161ta, Arta Vahi\u0161ta), \"Best Truth\". The Middle Persian descendant is Ashawahist or Ardwahisht; New Persian Ardibehesht or Ordibehesht. In the Gathas\u2014 the oldest texts of Zoroastrianism, thought to have been composed by Zoroaster \u2014it is seldom possible to distinguish between moral principle and the divinity. Later texts consistently use the 'Best' epithet when speaking of the Amesha Spenta, only once in the Gathas is 'best' an adjective of a\u1e63\u030ca/arta. ==Etymology== Avestan ' and its Vedic equivalent ' both derive from Proto-Indo-Iranian *\u1e5bt\u00e1- \"truth\", which in turn continues Proto-Indo-European * \"properly joined, right, true\", from the root *. The word is attested in Old Persian as '. It is unclear whether the Avestan variation between a\u1e63\u030ca and arta is merely orthographical. Benveniste suggested \u0161 was only a convenient way of writing rt and should not be considered phonetically relevant.. According to Gray, \u1e63\u030c is a misreading, representing \u2013 not /\u0283/ - but /rr/, of uncertain phonetic value but \"probably\" representing a voiceless r.. Miller suggested that rt was restored when a scribe was aware of the morpheme boundary between the /r/ and /t/ (that is, whether the writer maintained the \u2013ta suffix).. Avestan druj, like its Vedic Sanskrit cousin druh, appears to derive from the PIE root *, also continued in Persian \u062f\u0631\u0648\u063a / d[o]r\u016b\u0121 \"lie\", German Trug \"fraud, deception\". Old Norse draugr and Middle Irish airddrach mean \"spectre, spook\". The Sanskrit cognate druh means \"affliction, afflicting demon\". In Avestan, druj- has a secondary derivation, the adjective dr\u0259guua\u1e47t- (Young Avestan druua\u1e47t-), \"partisan of deception, deceiver\" for which the superlative draoji\u0161ta- and perhaps the comparative draoj(ii)ah- are attested (Kellens, 2010, pp. 69 ff.). ==Meaning== A\u1e63\u030ca \"cannot be precisely rendered by some single word in another tongue\" but may be summarized as follows: It is, first of all, 'true statement'. This 'true statement', because it is true, corresponds to an objective, material reality that embraces all of existence. Recognized in it is a great cosmic principle since all things happen according to it.. \"This cosmic [...] force is imbued also with morality, as verbal Truth, 'la parole conforme', and Righteousness, action conforming with the moral order.\". The correspondence between 'truth', reality and an all- encompassing cosmic principle is not far removed from Heraclitus' conception of Logos.. ===As \"truth\"=== Both Avestan a\u1e63\u030ca/arta and Vedic \u0157t\u00e1- are commonly translated as \"truth\" as this best reflects both the original meaning of the term as well as the opposition to their respective antonyms. The opposite of Avestan a\u1e63\u030ca/arta is druj-, \"lie.\" Similarly, the opposites of Vedic ' are ' and druh, likewise \"lie\". That \"truth\" is also what was commonly understood by the term as attested in Greek myth of: Isis and Osiris 47, Plutarch calls the divinity \u0391\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 Aletheia, \"Truth.\". ===As \"existence\"=== The adjective corresponding to the noun a\u1e63\u030ca/arta, \"truth\", is Avestan haithya- (hai\u03b8iia-), \"true\", the opposite of which is also druj-. Avestan haithya- derives from Indo-Iranian *s\u0101tya that in turn derives from Indo-European *sat- \"being, existing\". The Sanskrit cognate s\u00e1tya- means \"true\" in the sense of \"really existing.\" This meaning is also preserved in Avestan, for instance in the expression hai\u03b8\u012bm var\u0259z, \"to make true\" as in \"to bring to realization.\" Another meaning of \"reality\" may be inferred from the component parts of the a\u1e63\u030ca/arta: from (root) \u0157 with a substantivizing -ta suffix. The root \u0157 corresponds to Old Avestan ar\u0259ta- and Younger Avestan \u0259r\u0259ta- \"established\", hence a\u1e63\u030ca/arta \"that which is established.\" The synonymy of a\u1e63\u030ca and \"existence\" overlaps with the stock identification of Ahura Mazda as the creator (of existence itself). Truth is existence (creation) inasmuch as falsehood is non-existence (uncreated, anti-created). Also, because a\u1e63\u030ca is everything that druj- is not (or vice versa), since a\u1e63\u030ca is, druj- is not. This notion is already expressed in the Avesta itself, such as in the first Yasht, dedicated to Ahura Mazda, in which the \"fifth name is the whole good existence of Mazda, the seed of Asha\" ( Yasht 1.7). Similarly, in the mythology of Gandar\u0259\u03b2a, the 'yellow-heeled' dragon of the druj- that emerges from the deep to destroy the \"living world (creation) of A\u1e63\u030ca\" (Yasht 19.41) In the ethical goals of Zoroastrianism (\"good thoughts, good words, good deeds\"), Vohu Manah is active in good thoughts, Sraosha in good words and A\u1e63\u030ca in good deeds. (Denkard 3.13-14). A\u1e63\u030ca is thus \"represented as active and effective.\". ===As \"right working\"=== Subject to context, a\u1e63\u030ca/arta- is also frequently translated as \"right working\" or \"[that which is] right\". The word then (cf. Bartholomae's, coll. 229-259. and Geldner's. translations as German language \"Recht\") has the same range of meaning of \"right\" as in the English language: truth, righteousness, rightfulness, lawfullness, conformity, accord, order (cosmic order, social order, moral order). These various meanings of \"right\" are frequently combined, such as \"the inexorable law of righteousness,\". or as \"the eternal fitness of things that are in accord with the divine order.\". As (the hypostasis of) regularity and \"right working\", a\u1e63\u030ca/arta- is present when Ahura Mazda fixed the course of the sun, the moon and the stars (Yasna 44.3), and it is through a\u1e63\u030ca that plants grow (Yasna 48.6). \"Right working\" also overlaps with both Indo-European *\u00e1r- \"to (properly) join together\" and with the notion of existence and realization (to make real). The word for \"established\", ar\u0259ta-, also means \"proper\". The antonymic anar\u0259ta- (or anar\u0259\u03b8a-) means \"improper. In Zoroastrian tradition, prayers must be enunciated with care for them to be effective. The Indo- Iranian formula *s\u0101tyas mantras (Yasna 31.6: hai\u03b8\u012bm mathrem) \"does not simply mean 'true Word' but formulated thought which is in conformity with the reality' or 'poetic (religious) formula with inherent fulfillment (realization)'\". It perhaps has also suggestions of harmoniousness or cooperativeness ===In comparison to Vedic usage=== The kinship. between Old Iranian a\u1e63\u030ca-/arta- and Vedic \u0157t\u00e1- is evident in numerous formulaic phrases and expressions that appear in both the Avesta and in the RigVeda. cit. . For instance, the *\u0157t\u00e1sya path-, \"path of truth\", is attested multiple times in both sources: Y 51.13, 72.11; RV 3.12.7, 7.66.3. Similarly \"source of truth,\" Avestan a\u1e63\u030ca kh\u00e1 and Vedic ' (Y 10.4; RV 2.28.5) The adjective corresponding to Avestan a\u1e63\u030ca/arta- is hai\u03b8iia- \"true\". Similarly, the adjective corresponding to Vedic \u0157t\u00e1- \"truth\" is s\u00e1tya- \"true\". The opposite of both a\u1e63\u030ca/arta- and haithya- is druj- \"lie\" or \"false\". In contrast, in the Vedas the opposite of both \u0157t\u00e1- and s\u00e1tya- is druj- and \u00e1n\u0157ta-, also \"lie\" or \"false\". However, while the Indo-Iranian concept of truth is attested throughout Zoroastrian tradition, \u0157t\u00e1- disappears in post-Vedic literature and is not preserved in post-Vedic texts. On the other hand, s\u00e1tya- and \u00e1nrta- both survive in classical Sanskrit. The main theme of the Rig Veda, \"the truth and the gods\", is not evident in the Gathas.. Thematic parallels between a\u1e63\u030ca/arta and \u0157t\u00e1-, however, exist such aa in Yasht 10, the Avestan hymn to Mithra. There, Mithra, who is the hypostasis and the preserver of covenant, is the protector of a\u1e63\u030ca/arta.. RigVedic Mitra is likewise preserver of \u0157t\u00e1-. ==Fire as the agent of Truth== Asha Vahishta is closely associated with fire. Fire is \"grandly conceived as a force informing all the other Amesha Spentas, giving them warmth and the spark of life.\". In Yasht 17.20, Angra Mainyu clamours that Zoroaster burns him with Asha Vahishta. In Vendidad 4.54-55, speaking against the truth and violating the sanctity of promise is detected by the consumption of \"water, blazing, of golden color, having the power to detect guilt.\" This analogy of truth that burns and detecting truth through fire is already attested in the very earliest texts, that is, in the Gathas and in the Yasna Haptanghaiti. In Yasna 43-44, Ahura Mazda dispenses justice through radiance of His fire and the strength of a\u1e63\u030ca. Fire \"detects\" sinners \"by hand-grasping\" (Yasna 34.4). An individual who has passed the fiery test (garmo-varah, ordeal by heat), has attained physical and spiritual strength, wisdom, truth and love with serenity (Yasna 30.7). Altogether, \"there are said to have been some 30 kinds of fiery tests in all.\". According to the post- Sassanid Dadestan i denig (I.31.10), at the final judgement a river of molten metal will cover the earth. The righteous, as they wade through this river, will perceive the molten metal as a bath of warm milk. The wicked will be scorched. For details on a\u1e63\u030ca's role in personal and final judgement, see a\u1e63\u030ca in eschatology, below. Fire is moreover the \"auxiliary of the truth,\" \"and not only, as in the ordeal, of justice and of truth at the same time.\" In Yasna 31.19, \"the man who thinks of a\u1e63\u030ca, [...] who uses his tongue in order to speak correctly, [does so] with the aid of brilliant fire\". In Yasna 34-44 devotees \"ardently desire [Mazda's] mighty fire, through a\u1e63\u030ca.\" In Yasna 43-44, Ahura Mazda \"shall come to [Zoroaster] through the splendour of [Mazda's] fire, possessing the strength of (through) a\u1e63\u030ca and good mind (=Vohu Manah).\" That fire \"possesses strength through a\u1e63\u030ca\" is repeated again in Yasna 43.4. In Yasna 43.9, Zoroaster, wishing to serve fire, gives his attention to a\u1e63\u030ca. In Yasna 37.1, in a list of what are otherwise all physical creations, a\u1e63\u030ca takes the place of fire. Asha Vahishta's association with atar is carried forward in the post-Gathic texts, and they are often mentioned together. In Zoroastrian cosmogony, each of the Amesha Spentas represents one aspect of creation and one of seven primordial elements that in Zoroastrian tradition are the basis of that creation. In this matrix, a\u1e63\u030ca/arta is the origin of fire, Avestan atar, which permeates through all Creation. The correspondence then is that a\u1e63\u030ca/arta \"penetrates all ethical life, as fire penetrates all physical being.\" In the liturgy Asha Vahishta is frequently invoked together with fire. (Yasna l.4, 2.4, 3.6, 4.9, 6.3, 7.6, 17.3, 22.6, 59.3, 62.3 etc.). In one passage, fire is a protector of a\u1e63\u030ca: \"when the Evil Spirit assailed the creation of Good Truth, Good Thought and Fire intervened\" (Yasht 13.77) In later Zoroastrian tradition, Asha Vahishta is still at times identified with the fire of the household hearth.. ==In eschatology and soteriology== In addition to the role of fire as the agent of Truth, fire, among its various other manifestations, is also \"the fire of judicial ordeal, prototype of the fiery torrent of judgement day, when all will receive their just deserts 'by fire and by A\u1e63\u030ca' (Y 31.3).\" In the Avesta, the \"radiant quarters\" of a\u1e63\u030ca is \"the best existence\", i.e. Paradise (cf. Vendidad 19.36), entry to which is restricted to those who are recognized as \"possessing truth\" (a\u1e63\u030cavan).. The key to this doctrine is Yasna 16.7: \"We worship the radiant quarters of A\u1e63\u030ca in which dwell the souls of the dead, the Frava\u0161is of the a\u1e63\u030cavans; the best existence (=Paradise) of the a\u1e63\u030cavans we worship, (which is) light and according all comforts.\" 'A\u1e63\u030ca' derives from the same Proto- Indo-European root as 'Airyaman', the divinity of healing who is closely associated with Asha Vahishta. At the last judgement, the common noun airyaman is an epithet of the saoshyans, the saviours that bring about the final renovation of the world. The standing epithet of these saviour figures is 'astvat\u04d9r\u04d9ta', which likewise has arta as an element of the name. These saviours are those who follow Ahura Mazda's teaching \"with acts inspired by a\u1e63\u030ca\" (Yasna 48.12). Both Airyaman and Asha Vahishta (as also Atar) are closely associated with Sraosha \"[Voice of] Conscience\" and guardian of the Chinvat bridge across which souls must pass. According to a lost Avestan passage that is only preserved in a later (9th century) Pahlavi text, towards the end of time and the final renovation, A\u1e63\u030ca and Airyaman will together come upon the earth to do battle with the Az, the daeva of greed (Zatspram 34.38-39). The third Yasht, which is nominally addressed to Asha Vahishta, is in fact mostly devoted to the praise of the airyaman ishya (airy\u04d9m\u0101 \u012b\u0161yo, \"Longed-for airyaman\"), the fourth of the four great Gathic prayers. In present-day Zoroastrianism it is considered to invoke Airyaman just as the Ashem Vohu, is the second of the four great Gathic prayers, is dedicated to A\u1e63\u030ca. All four prayers (the first is the Ahuna Vairya, the third is the Yenghe Hatam) have judgement and/or salvation as a theme, and all four call on the Truth. It is Airyaman that \u2013 together with fire \u2013 will \"melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and it will be upon the earth like a river\" (Bundahishn 34.18). In Zoroastrian tradition, metal is the domain of Xshathra [Vairya], the Amesha Spenta of \"[Desirable] Dominion\", with whom A\u1e63\u030ca is again frequently identified. Dominion is moreover \"a form of truth and results from truth.\". In Denkard 8.37.13, Asha Vahishta actually takes over Airyaman's healer role as the healer of all spiritual ills and Airyaman then only retains the role of healer of corporeal ills. Although Airyaman has no dedication in the Siroza, the invocations to the divinities of the Zoroastrian calendar, Airyaman is twice invoked together with A\u1e63\u030ca. (Siroza 1.3 and 2.3) Aogemadaecha 41-47 prototypes death as a journey that has to be properly prepared for: As mortals acquires material goods as they go through life, so also should they furnish themselves with spiritual stores of righteousness. They will then be well provisioned when they embark on the journey from which they will not return. A\u1e63\u030ca's role is not limited to judgement: In Bundahishn 26.35, A\u1e63\u030ca prevents daevas from exacting too great a punishment to souls consigned to the House of Lies. Here, A\u1e63\u030ca occupies the position that other texts assign to Mithra, who is traditionally identified with fairness. For the relationship between A\u1e63\u030ca, eschatology and Nowruz, see in the Zoroastrian calendar, below. Although there are numerous eschatological parallels between A\u1e63\u030ca and A\u0161i \"recompense, reward\" (most notably their respective associations with Sraosha and Vohu Manah), and are on occasion even mentioned together (Yasna 51.10), the two are not etymologically related. The feminine abstract noun a\u0161i/arti derives from ar-, \"to allot, to grant.\" A\u0161i also has no Vedic equivalent. ==In relationship to the other Amesha Spentas== In Zoroastrian cosmogony and cosmology, which\u2014though alluded to in the Gathas\u2014is only systematically described in Zoroastrian tradition (e.g. Bundahishn 3.12), a\u1e63\u030ca is the second (cf. Yasna 47.1) of the six primeval creations realized (\"created by His thought\") by Ahura Mazda. It is through these six, the Amesha Spentas that all subsequent creation was accomplished. In addition to Asha Vahishta's role as an Amesha Spenta and hence one of the primordial creations through which all other creation was realized, Truth is one of the \"organs, aspects or emanations\" of Ahura Mazda through which the Creator acts and is immanent in the world.. Although Vohu Manah regularly stands first in the list of the Amesha Spenta (and of Ahura Mazda's creations), in the Gathas Asha Vahishta is the most evident of the six, and also the most commonly associated with Wisdom (Mazda). In the 238 verses of these hymns, A\u1e63\u030ca appears 157 times. Of the other concepts, only Vohu Manah \"Good Purpose\" appears nearly as often (136 occurrences). In comparison, the remaining four of the great sextet appear only 121 times altogether. Although a formal hierarchy is not evident in the Gathas, the group of six \"divides naturally into three dyads.\" In this arrangement, A\u1e63\u030ca is paired with Vohu Manah. This reflects the frequency in which the two appear (together) in the Gathas and is in turn reflected in Zoroastrian tradition. In Bundahishn 26.8, Vohu Manah stands at the left hand of God, while A\u1e63\u030ca stands at the right. ==In divine epithets== ===Of Ahura Mazda=== Yasht 1, the hymn dedicated to Ahura Mazda, provides a list of 74 \"names\" by which the Creator is invoked. In the numbered list of Yasht 1.7, 'Asha Vahishta' \"Best Truth\" is the fourth name.. A later verse, Yasht 1.12, includes 'A\u1e63\u030cavan'. \"Possessing Truth\" and 'A\u1e63\u030cavast\u0259ma' \"Most Righteous\".. In Yasna 40.3, Ahura Mazda is a\u1e63\u030ca\u014b\u0101\u010d \"having a\u1e63\u030ca following\". ===Of other divinities=== One of Haoma's stock epithets is a\u1e63\u030cavazah- \"furthering a\u1e63\u030ca\" (Yasht 20.3; Yasna 8.9, 10.1.14, 11.10 et al.). Atar \"possesses strength through a\u1e63\u030ca\" (a\u1e63\u030ca-ahojah, Yasna 43.4). ==In the Zoroastrian calendar== In the Zoroastrian calendar, the third day of the month and the second month of the year are dedicated to and named after a\u1e63\u030ca and Asha Vahishta (called\u0627\u0631\u062f\u064a\u0628\u0647\u0634\u062a Ordibehesht in Modern Persian both in Iranian Calendar and Yazdgerdi calendar). A special service to a\u1e63\u030ca and A\u1e63\u030ca, known as the 'Jashan of Ardavisht', is held on the day on which month-name and day-name dedications intersect. In the Fasli and Bastani variants of the Zoroastrian calendar, this falls on April 22. Rapithwin, one of the five gahs (watches) of the day, under the protection of A\u1e63\u030ca. (Bundahishn 3.22) This implies that all prayers recited between noon and three invoke A\u1e63\u030ca. Noon is considered to be the \"perfect\" time, at which instant the world was created and at which instant time will stop on the day of the final renovation of the world. In the winter months, the daevic time of year, Rapithwin is known as the Second Havan (the first Havan being from dawn to noon), and with the first day of spring, March 21, Rapithwin symbolically returns. This day, March 21, is Nowruz Nowruz, the holiest of all Zoroastrian festivals is dedicated to A\u1e63\u030ca. It follows immediately after Pateti, the day of introspection and the Zoroastrian equivalent of All-Souls Day. Nowruz, Zoroastrianism's New Year's Day, is celebrated on the first day of spring, traditionally understood to be the day of rebirth, and literally translated means \"New Day\". The first month of the year of the Zoroastrian calendar is Farvadin, which is dedicated to and named after the Frava\u0161is, the ancestral higher spirits. \"The underlying idea of the dedication\" of the second month of the year to Asha Vahishta \"may be revivification of the earth after the death of winter.\". ==Iconography== On Kushan coins, Asha Vahishta \"appears as A\u1e63\u030caeix\u0161o, with a diadem and nimbus, like Mithra in the same series.\" ==In proper names== \"Arta- (Mid. Iranian ard-), representing either the Av. divinity A\u1e63\u030ca or the principle a\u1e63\u030ca, occurs frequently as an element in Iranian personal names.\" Hellenized/Latinized names include: * Artabanos (Greek, Latin Artabanus, Modern Persian \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0646 Ardav\u0101n), from *Artab\u0101nu \"glory of arta\". * Artabazanes (Latin) a variant of either Artabazus or Artabrzana * Artabazus, Artabazos (Greek, Latin Artavasdes), attested as Avestan Ashavazdah, perhaps meaning \"powerful/persevering through arta\" * Artabrzana (Greek), from *Artabrzana \"exalting arta\" * Artaphrenes (Greek), either from Artamainyu \"spirit of arta\" (phrene: Greek 'spirit') or a corruption of Artafarnah \"[divine] Glory of arta\" * Artasyras (Greek), from *Artasura, \"powerful through arta\" * Artaxata, Artaxiasata (Greek, Armenian Artashat), meaning \"joy of arta\". * Artaxias (Greek, Armenian Artashes), from an Aramaic form of Artax\u1e63\u030cac\u0101 (Artaxerxes, see below). * Artaxerxes (Latin, variant Artoxerxes, Greek Artaxesses, Hebrew/Aramaic Artax\u1e63\u030cast or Artax\u1e63\u030casta), a compound of Arta and Xerxes, the latter not being a part of the original Old Persian Artax\u1e63\u030cac\u0101, \"whose reign is through arta\" or \"dominion of arta.\" * Artazostre (Greek), from *Artazaushri \"who is in favor of arta\" or \"who takes delight in arta\" * Artembares (Greek), from *Artempara \"who encourages arta\" or \"who furthers arta.\" Other names include: * Artavardiya (Old Persian) and Irdumardiya (Elamite), meaning \"doer of Justice\" * Arda Viraz, the \"righteous Viraz\" (having an eschatological connotation) * Ardeshir, Middle Persian form of Old Persian Artax\u1e63\u030cac\u0101 (i.e. Artaxerxes), literally \"whose reign is through arta\"; actually means \"Holy Kingship\".Dehkhoda Persian Dictionary Middle Iranian ard- is also suggested to be the root of names of the current day Iranian cities of Ardabil, Ardekan, Ardehal and Ardestan. ==See also== *Truth *Ma'at ==Notes== {| |- | style=\"vertical-align:top; width:2em; text-align:right;\"|a) | valign=\"top\" | | Middle Iranian ard- denoting a\u0161a-/arta- should not be confused with another ard-, denoting \"fortune.\" The latter derives from Avestan a\u0161i- or arti-, which has a different gender. |- | style=\"vertical- align:top; width:2em; text-align:right;\"|b) | valign=\"top\" | | Avestan vahi\u0161ta (as in Asha Vahishta) is a superlative of the adjective vohu- \"good\", hence \"vahi\u0161ta\" \"best\".
