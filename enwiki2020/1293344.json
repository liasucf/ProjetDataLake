    "text": "Rajab () is the seventh month of the Islamic calendar. The lexical definition of the classical Arabic verb rajaba is \"to respect\" which could also mean \"be awe or be in fear\", of which Rajab is a derivative. This month is regarded as one of the four sacred months in Islam in which battles are prohibited. The pre-Islamic Arabs also considered warfare blasphemous during the four months. Muslims believe Rajab is the month in which \u2018Al\u012b ibn Ab\u012b T\u0101lib, the first Imam of Shia Muslims and fourth Caliph of Sunni Muslims, was born. Rajab is also the month during which Isra' Mi'raj (journey from Mecca to Jerusalem and then through the 7 Heavens to meet ALLAH ) of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, took place. Rajab and Sha\u02bfb\u0101n are a prelude to the holy month of Rama\u1e0d\u0101n. ==Timing== The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, and months begin when the first crescent of a new moon is sighted. Since the lunar year is 11 to 12 days shorter than the solar year, Rajab migrates throughout the seasons. The estimated start and end dates for Rajab, based on the Umm al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia, are:Umm al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\" |+Rajab dates between 2018 and 2023 |- !scope=\"col\"|AH !scope=\"col\"|First day (CE/AD) !scope=\"col\"|Last day (CE/AD) |- !scope=\"row\"|1439 |18 March 2018 |16 April 2018 |- !scope=\"row\"|1440 |8 March 2019 |5 April 2019 |- !scope=\"row\"|1441 |25 February 2020 |24 March 2020 |- !scope=\"row\"|1442 |13 February 2021 |13 March 2021 |- !scope=\"row\"|1443 |2 February 2022 |3 March 2022 |- !scope=\"row\"|1444 |23 January 2023 |20 February 2023 |} ==Events== * The Battle of Tabouk took place in Rajab, 9 A.H.
