    "text": "Just Friends is a vocal jazz album by Rick Haydon and John Pizzarelli, released in February 2006 with Mel Bay Records. It reached 19 on the JazzWeek Top 100 charts in April 2006. ==Reception== Mike Shanley for the JazzTimes wrote that technically \"both guitarists play Bill Moll seven-string axes, so it would\u2019ve been nice if this album did a better job of distinguishing one from the other\" but that \"their musical touchstones and graceful styles blend together like a seasoned team.\" Ken Dryden at All About Jazz had a more positive take, writing the duo alternates \"between lead and rhythm lines so effectively that it's hard to tell who is who.\" He concluded \"it is obvious that they had a ball making this disc.\" Scott Yanow rated the album four stars on AllMusic, commenting that Haydon \"holds his own with Pizzarelli on this good-natured and consistently swinging quartet set.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Rick Haydon7-string electric guitar * John Pizzarelli7-string electric guitar * Martin Pizzarellibass * Tony Tedescodrums ==References== ==External links== * Category:2006 albums Category:John Pizzarelli albums Category:Collaborative albums ",
