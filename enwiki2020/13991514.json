The station mostly carries the same programs as WEEI-FM from Boston. Some local commercials take the place of Boston commercials.

WPPI also carries University of Maine Black Bear football and ice hockey,of Maine Official Athletic Site and Portland Pirates ice hockey.Pirates Announce New Radio Home ==History== The 95.5 frequency began operations in 1993 as WPME, simulcasting a country music format with 96.7 WCME from Boothbay Harbor (now WBQA). A year later, the station converted to an oldies format as WXGL-FM. Atlantic Coast Radio purchased the station in 1999, and in January 2000, the station switched to an adult album alternative format as WCLZ. A few months later, WCLZ adopted a sports talk format, initially as a simulcast of WJAE (the descendant of WJAB); the next year, the station took the call letters WJJB-FM. On August 25, 2008, WLOB-FM was converted to a simulcast of WJJB (which WJAE had become by that time), resulting in WLOB's programming being heard only on the AM signal. This was part of a shuffle of Atlantic Coast Radio's FM stations as a result of the conversion of two of its stations, including WJJB-FM, on September 1, 2008 to simulcasts of WEEI. Shortly after the completion of these format changes, 95.5's call letters were changed to WGEI (it had initially planned to use the WTEI call sign, and for a week in September 2008 used the WUEI call letters). On April 1, 2009, WGEI converted to a simulcast of WLOB; it became WLOB-FM a few days later. In August 2011, WLOB-FM returned to simulcasting WEEI. On September 7, 2011, WLOB-FM changed their call letters to WPPI. ==References== == External links == * * PPI Category:Sports radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1993 PPI Category:Topsham, Maine Category:1993 establishments in Maine Category:Boston Red Sox broadcasters ",
