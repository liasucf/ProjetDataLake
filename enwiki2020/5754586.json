    "text": "The Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International (), widely known as LBCI, is a private television station in Lebanon. LBCI was founded in 1992 by acquiring the assets, liabilities and logo of LBC, an entity founded in 1985 during the Lebanese Civil War by the Lebanese Forces militia. LBCI went global in 1996 when it launched its satellite channel LBC Al-Fadha'iya Al-Lubnaniya () covering Lebanon, the Arab world, Europe, America, Australia and Africa. ==History== ===Post-war era=== The Lebanese Forces, a lebanese resistance that had founded LBC in 1985, was militarily and financially weakened by Lebanese civil war which ended in 1990 and its leader Samir Geagea was imprisoned in 1994. In 1992 Pierre El Daher had founded LBCI along with other shareholders and registered it at the Commercial Register of Baabda. In the current ownership battle over the channel, El Daher has failed to prove that the Lebanese Forces sold the original LBC channel to him allowing him to move its assets to the newly created LBCI. In April 1996, El Daher and other shareholders launched LBCsat, a free satellite channel. The new channel was a success, especially to the Lebanese diaspora, disseminated throughout the world. In 2003, as a result of an agreement between Saleh Kamel, founder of LMH company (Lebanese Media Holding, owner of 49% of LBC SAT and Pac's shares) and Saudi prince Al Waleed bin Talal, the latter, through Kingdom, replaced Kamel in LMH. By the end of 2008, it was decided to increase the capital of LMH considerably. Accordingly, Al-Waleed Bin Talal became the largest shareholder after acquiring the absolute majority in PAC (a content provider for both LBCI and LBC SAT) and LBC SAT, based on an understanding that the capital increase would be invested to improve the programs\u2019 network and upgrade productivity under the supervision of Sheikh Pierre Daher. In 2010, Rupert Murdoch joined the group and PAC and LBC SAT were merged with Rotana. Rumor was that this merger would improve and develop the group, which seemed an obvious result of the cooperation between the Saudi prince and the owner of the biggest media empire in the world, Rupert Murdoch. These expectations did not materialize. ===Al Hayat and LBC SAT merger=== At the end of the year 2002, LBC SAT and the London-based Al Hayat newspaper owned by Saudis, merged their news programs. LBC SAT daily news bulletin was called the \"Al Hayat-LBC SAT news bulletin\". The cooperation ended in 2010. ===LBCI ownership battle=== The Lebanese Forces, a local political party initiated proceedings in Lebanon claiming ownership of LBCI, and lost miserably, because of the flaws and political influence over the judiciary system. As stated above, pierre daher failed to show evidence that he owns the original LBC TV. ==Television channels== ===Domestic=== * LBCI \u2013 a local channel for Lebanese viewers broadcasting a variety of programs of different genres. *Lebanese Diaspora Channel (LDC) \u2013 an international version of LBCI targeted to Lebanese in diaspora countries. *LB2 (formerly known as LBCI Drama) \u2013 a local channel dedicated to around the clock reruns of entertainment shows and series. *LBCI News \u2013 local channel that focuses on broadcasting the most actual news. *LBCI HD \u2013 Lebanon's first HD channel, broadcasting LBCI programs in high definition. ===International=== *LBC Europe \u2013 an international version of LBCI targeted to Lebanese citizens in Europe. *LBC America \u2013 the international version of LBCI is targeted at Lebanese citizens in America. *LBC Australia \u2013 the international version of LBCI is targeted at Lebanese citizens in Australia. *LBC Africa \u2013 the international version of LBCI is targeted at Lebanese in Africa. *LBC Maghreb \u2013 international version of LBCI targeted at Lebanese citizens in the Middle East and North Africa. In December 2019, LBCI announced that the LDC brand will be discontinued by the beginning of the year 2020 and that all programs will be broadcast via LBCI. The main reason behind the decision is that the LDC branding is no longer needed since the battle for the LBC brand and channels with Al Walid Bin Talal has been resolved and won by LBCI current owner, Pierre El Daher. ===Logos=== File:LBCI DRAMA.jpg.png|LBCI Drama logo File:LBCI News logo.png|LBCI News logo File:LBCI HD logo.png|LBCI HD logo File:LDC logo new.png|LDC logo File:EUROPE FINAL.png|LBC Europe logo File:Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation America (logo).png|LBC America logo File:LBC Australia.png|LBC Australia logo ==Popular programs== LBCI has produced many popular shows including: Little Big Stars \u0646\u062c\u0648\u0645 \u0635\u063a\u0627\u0631, Star Academy Arab World, Ya Katel Ya Maktoul (Arabic version of Greed), Miss Lebanon, Hellha wo Ehtalha (Arabic version of French TV Show Fort Boyard), Survivor Middle East, El Wadi (Arabic version of The Farm), The Perfect Bride and Mission Fashion.
