The early part of the work is largely mythical, depicting the history of Ireland as a succession of invasions and settlements, and derives primarily from medieval writings such as the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, the Dindsenchas, royal genealogies and stories of heroic kings. The later part depicts the Normans as the latest in this series of settlers. Keating, a Catholic priest of Anglo- Norman descent, gave Irish people of both Gaelic and Norman ancestry a shared place in the history of the nation, and emphasised the role of the Church as a unifying factor in Irish society. The work was extremely popular, surviving in a large number of manuscripts,Brendan Bradshaw, Andrew Hadfield and Willy Maley, Representing Ireland: Literature and the Origins of Conflict, 1534-1660, Cambridge University Press, 1993, pp. 166-168 and its prose style became the standard followed by generations of Irish-language writers.Diarmuid \u00d3 Murchadha (2005) \"A review of some placename material from Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn\", \u00c9igse, A Journal of Irish Studies, Vol. 35, p. 81, National University of Ireland However, it was received critically from the start, with Sir Richard Cox, a protestant lawyer of English descent, describing it in the 1680s as \"an ill-digested heap of very silly fictions\". Modern scholars view it in the context of the antiquarian tendency of Renaissance humanism, with Keating expounding on ancient Irish sources, whose authority he defends, to provide \"an origin-legend for Counter-Reformation Catholic Ireland.\" ==See also== * Annals of the Four Masters * Leabhar na nGenealach * \u00d3 Cl\u00e9irigh Book of Genealogies ==References== ==Editions and translation== :For a fuller list of translations and editions see : * * * ** ** ** ** ===Manuscripts=== * ==External links== * Category:Royal Irish Academy Library Category:Early Irish literature Category:Irish-language literature Category:Mythological cycle Category:Cycles of the Kings Category:Irish chronicles Category:17th-century Irish literature Category:Irish manuscripts Category:Irish books ",
