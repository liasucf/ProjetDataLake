In the journal Clinical Psychology Review (2009), three authors wrote that Ferrada de Noli and co-workers had found a new pathway in the pathogenesis of suicidal behaviour associated with PTSD. The review concluded that Ferrada de Noli and his co-workers \"demonstrated that among refugees with PTSD, major depression was not substantially associated with heightened levels of suicidal behaviour\". Meaning that the path to severe suicide attempts in PTSD victims was not mediated by depression - as it was thought before - but linked directly to PTSD. The discovery indicated modifications in prevention and treatment of suicidal behaviour.Panagioti M, Gooding P, Tarrier N (2009). \"Post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal behavior: A narrative review\". Clinical Psychology Review. 29 (6): 471\u201382. doi:10.1016/j.cpr.2009.05.001. . Another finding was significant correlations between specific methods in suicidal behavior and methods used in torture inflicted to prisoners later diagnosed with PTSD. In the book Suicide and the Holocaust Professor David Lester referred to that finding, and summarized: \"for example those subjected to water torture thought of using drowning\".David Lester (2005), \"Suicide and the Holocaust\". Nova Science Publishers, New York. . In section \"Suicidal Behaviour in Refugees and After Torture\", page 57: \"Ferrada-Noli found that the method of suicide used or planned was similar to the method of torture with which the victim has been brutalized\".

In article (\"In Russia, a curious thesis puts forward to exculpate Damascus\") \"En Russie, une curieuse th\u00e8se reprise pour exon\u00e9rer Damas\", authored by the newspaper's correspondent in Moscow and using a Swedish journalist source, affirms that Ferrada de Noli \"sought refuge in Sweden, where, in addition to have assayed espionage, he would have pursued a scientific career...\" In French, original text: \u00abil s'est r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 en Su\u00e8de, o\u00f9, en plus de avoir g\u00f4ut\u00e9 \u00e0 l'espionnage, il aurait poursuivi une carri\u00e8re scientifique, notamment \u00e0 Harvard et \u00e0 l'institut su\u00e9dois Karolinska des Nobel.\u00bb In 1976 he started working as psychotherapist at health services for political refugees in Stockholm County, and 1989 in crisis therapy provided at the Swedish Red Cross Project for traumatized and torture-survivor refugees.\"Professional work in psychotherapy and psychology\", Academic CV Academic CV During mid-80s he participated in the Swedish Liberal Party. Following retirement, Ferrada de Noli founded the online magazine The Indicter , dealing with \"human rights and geopolitical issues\", as read in the magazine's banner. === Controversies === ====Early controversies==== Earlier academic controversies have involved articles in Swedish medical journals and media on his public opposition to the Swedish diagnose \"utbr\u00e4ndhet\" (work- related stress 'burnout'), which he said didn't have epidemiological ground.Torbj\u00f6rn Friberg. \"Burnout: From Popular Culture to Psychiatric Diagnosis in Sweden\". Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry (2009) 33: 538. After he wrote in DN that one risk factor for \"utbr\u00e4ndhet\" in women could be stress caused by a double working load, at the job and then at home \u2013contradicting the notion of an advanced Swedish gender equality,Dagens Nyheter, DN-debatt, 20 October 2000. \"Utbr\u00e4ndheten mest en modetrend\". Minister Mona Sahlin commented that his thesis was \"a bid insulting, to say the least\".Expressen. (\"It is insulting\"). \"Det \u00e4r f\u00f6rel\u00e4mpande\". Stockholm, 21 October 2000. Mona Sahlin (later the leader of the Swedish Social Democrat Party), meant that the problem was not rooted in whether men help women at home, but instead in poor organized environments in working places. The debate on his theses continued 2000-2002 in the journal of the Swedish Medical Association L\u00e4kartidningen. Later in 2005, Aftonbladet published a half front-page headline, \"Professor in attack against the burned-out\". It referred an interview where Ferrada de Noli stated that to be displeased with a job cannot be equated with a medical diagnosis,Aftonbladet. (\"Stress-burnout is an invention\"). \"Utbr\u00e4ndhet \u00e4r ett p\u00e5hitt\". Stockholm, 14 April 2005. and a new debate ensued in the Swedish media.Svenska Dagbladet. \"Professor condemns sick leaves\". \"Professor d\u00f6mer ut sjukskrivningar\". 19 September 2002. In 1998, at that time professor in Norway, De Noli requested the legal extradition of General Augusto Pinochet, to be judged in a European court on allegations of torture and war crimes.Associated Press (AP). \"Chilean in Norway files against Pinochet\". Oslo, Norway. 1 November 1998.NTB/Dagbladet. (\"Pinochet accused in Norge\"). \"Pinochet politianmeldt i Norge\", Oslo, 1 Nov 1998. Svenska Dagbladet. Br\u00e4nnpunkt. (\"Pinochet has to be taken to court\"). \"Pinochet m\u00e5ste st\u00e4llas inf\u00f6r r\u00e4tta\". 6 November 1998. ====Assange case==== De Noli has been criticized in the Swedish media for his public defence of Julian Assange. He published the book Sweden vs. Assange. Human Rights Issues, claiming that the case was instead political.Libertarian Books Sweden (publisher), Stockholm, 2016 (2nd edition). 340 pages. ISBN . In a RT (TV network) interview, 2012, he said that \"WikiLeaks is a lifeboat to democracy\",RT (TV network). 'MSM blacks Assange as US seeks Manning link'. 27 March 2012. (Video-interview): \"The disclosures made by Wikileaks aim to reveal the secrets that actually belong to the people which have elected those authorities which are abusing power by not telling the truth. In my opinion, Wikileaks is actually sending a lifeboat to democracy and democratic societies should instead be thankful for that effort, and not punish Wikileaks.\" and 2011, via Jennifer Robinson (lawyer), he submitted to the London Court deliberating the extradition of Assange, a testimony based on his investigation \"Swedish Trial by Media\".However the testimony was received off court, the issue was referred in \"Findings of facts and reasons\" delivered by Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle. See \"City of Westminster Magistrates' Court (Sitting at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court). Excerpts; \"There has been considerable adverse publicity in Sweden for Mr Assange, in the popular press, the television and in parliament\" (Judge Riddle); and, \"There is significant prejudice because of trial by media\" (Lawyer Hurtig). In 2012, Swedish Radio said in a broadcast that Ferrada de Noli has implicated \"a social democratic feminist working together with 'arms-(exports) companies' trying to get Assange\".Radio Sweden (Sweden's official international broadcasting station). \"Whistleblower in row with newspaper \u2013Wikileaks vs. Swedish tabloid Expressen\". Stockholm, 8 March 2012. Ferrada Noli denied that and asked Swedish Radio for a retraction. Professorsblogg, \"Swedish Radio incorrectly referring Professors Blogg's theses on Swedish case against Assange\", The Professors' Blogg, 8 March 2012. In a reportage about Ferrada de Noli's human rights undertakings done by the Italian newspaper L'Eco di Bergamo (January 2019), he was asked why he defended Assange's deeds \"instead of regard it illegal or criminal\". De Noli replied, \"According to International Law, what could instead be considered as criminal is what Assange has denounced\", Emanuele Roncalli (autor), \"Primo piano. Storia e personagi: 'In Cile ho combattuto contro Pinochet. Ora la mia battaglia \u00e8 per I diritti umani'\" (\"In Chile I combatted against Pinochet. Now my battle is for the human rights\").

De Noli's thesis was that the poison Novichok would have been developed in Uzbekistan, not in Russia, and its possession by other countries could not be ruled out. According to Dagens Nyheter, he would have declared in an interview done with him by the newspaper April 2, 2018, that the Skripal incident could be a case of False flag in anticipating an eventual confrontation sought by the United Kingdom against Russia.Dagens Nyheter, April 2, 2918.
