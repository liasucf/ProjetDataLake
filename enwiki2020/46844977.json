A major poetry figure in her country, she was especially known for her rigor in managing classical verse within the sonnet.

Acu\u00f1a began publishing poetry in the 1930s and was one of the most prolific women poets in Guatemala, publishing in the newspaper El Imparcial, the leading woman's magazine Nosotras, as well as in bound collections. She participated in many poetry contests, winning numerous awards, as a means to open the door to publishing\"Finzer (2008)\", p 175 and her skillful use of language helped her succeed and gain recognition a society which still mostly believed that men's intelligence was superior to women's.\"Finzer (2008)\", p 176 Unlike some of her fellow Guatemalan female writers, like Elisa Hall de Asturias who gave up writing due to the then- prevalent misogyny, or Magdalena Sp\u00ednola who faced ostracism during the dictatorship of Jorge Ubico Casta\u00f1eda, Acu\u00f1a was able to manipulate language and use poetic forms to address the culture without appearing to be a threat.\"Finzer (2008)\", p 183 Rather than promoting the heroic fatherland united under \"Father God\", Acu\u00f1a celebrated her nationalism by employing imagery of mother earth's fertility to evoke both pride in her homeland and address the patriarchy of her times without explicit confrontation.\"Finzer (2008)\", pp. 200-01 In 1938, Acu\u00f1a participated in an anthology called Colecci\u00f3n lila with Olga Violeta Luna de Marroqu\u00edn, Mar\u00eda del Pilar de Garcia, and Magdalena Sp\u00ednola, which was Central America's first women's poetry collection, both written and published by women.\"Finzer (2008)\", p 60 She founded and directed for several literary journals throughout her career and was a member of the Academia Guatemalteca de la Lengua.
