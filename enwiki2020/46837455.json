Though named after the Nayaka king, according to art historian George Michell, the palatial bungalow was actually built by the 18th century Mysore ruler Hyder Ali. The building is a protected monument under the Karnataka state division of the Archaeological Survey of India. The two storied building comprises a Durbar hall (\"nobel court\") with massive wooden pillars and lobed arched panels. The living chambers on the sides are at the upper level and have balconies and look down into the hall. Numerous antiquities collected from near by temples and archeological sites, such as sculptures, inscriptions and hero stones from the Hoysala era and later periods are on display at the palace grounds.Michell (2013), Southern India: A Guide to Monuments Sites & Museums, chapter:Karnataka, section:19, Shimoga, Roli Books, ==Gallery== ===The Building=== File:Shivappa Nayaka Palace in Shivamogga.JPG|Darbar hall in the Shivappa Nayaka Palace. ===12th century Hindu Sculptures=== File:Sculpture of Mahishasura Mardhini dated to the 12th century.JPG|Sculpture of Mahishasura Mardhini dated to the 12th century.
