    "text": "The twenty-fourth series of the British medical drama television series Casualty commenced airing in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 12 September 2009IMDB Casualty Series 24 and concluded on 21 August 2010. Events of the series included a crossover with sister show Holby City. ==Crew== The series was produced by the BBC and aired on BBC One in the United Kingdom. In April 2010, series production staff staged a protest at the Casualty studios over the dismissal of seven staff members from the show's props department. Media entertainment trade union BECTU claimed that the staff members were dismissed after 11 months and two weeks of service so that the BBC could avoid granting them rights allowed to employees who have worked for the company for a year or longer. Bectu supervisory official Helen Ryan stated: \"This treatment of individuals would be unacceptable and immoral coming from any employer. However the fact this it is the BBC, a publicly funded and universally respected broadcaster will cause many to view the BBC in a new light.\" A petition against the decision was circulated, and BECTU representatives urged the dismissed employees to launch a formal appeal against the BBC. == Cast == === Overview === Casualty features an ensemble cast of characters in the medical profession, who work in the hospital's Emergency Department.
