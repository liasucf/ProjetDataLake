    "text": "Fitzjames in One Hour, or The Carnival Ball Louise Fitzjames was a 19th- century ballerina. She was born on 10 December 1809 in Paris, and danced at Paris Opera from 1832 to 1846. When Marie Taglioni dropped out of Meyerbeer's Robert le diable after a few appearances, Fitzjames took on Taglioni's role of the Abbess. She danced the Abbess over 230 times. She was criticized by poet Th\u00e9ophile Gautier for her emaciated appearance. Other roles included those in Le Dieu et la bayadere and La Jolie Fille de Gand in 1842. ==References== Category:People from Paris Category:French ballerinas Category:1809 births Category:Year of death missing ",
