    "text": "The Mad Doctor is a 1935 novel by Australian author F. J. Thwaites, a melodramatic medical romance set in Africa. Thwaites based the novel on a story he heard from an old man while crossing the Atlantic in 1933. However, he changed the tragic ending to a more optimistic one. ==Plot== A Sydney surgeon is sent to jail. When he gets out, finding himself a social outcast, he goes to work in the African jungle. Although he only works among the native Africans, his reputation as a miracle worker in cases of paralysis spreads far and wide. ==Adaptation== The novel was adapted for radio in Adelaide in 1936. During the production of this, Thwaites met the actress Jessica Harcourt, who he later married. ==The Mad Doctor in Harley Street== The Mad Doctor in Harley Street is a 1938 novel by F. J. Thwaites. A sequel to The Mad Doctor, it describes the doctor's efforts to get his cure recognised by the medical establishment in London. A contemporary review says that the novel \"bubbles over with sentimentalism.\" The novel was adapted for radio in 1938. ==References== ==External links== *The Mad Doctor at AustLit *The Mad Doctor of Harley Street at AustLit Category:1935 Australian novels Category:Novels set in Africa Category:Medicine and health in fiction ",
