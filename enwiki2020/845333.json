    "text": "Llanrumney () is a suburb, community and electoral ward in east Cardiff, Wales. Llanrumney was in Monmouthshire until it was incorporated into Cardiff in 1938. ==History== Rhymney River The land where modern Llanrumney stands was left to Keynsham Abbey by the Lord of Glamorgan after the Norman Conquest. According to legend, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the final prince of an independent Wales, was interred in a stone coffin by the monks in 1282, on land where Llanrumney Hall would be built centuries later. After Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries in the sixteenth century, the land passed to the Kemeys family. It remained in their possession until 1951, when it and its grounds were compulsorily purchased by the local authority in order to build the large estates that can be seen there today. The origins of the name Llanrumney are found in the Welsh word glan ('bank, shore') and the Anglicised version of Rhymni, the name of the local river. The substitution of glan for llan ('church') is explained by the fact that in Welsh, 'lan' is the lenited form of both glan and llan. Thus phrases such as 'i Lanrhymni' and 'o Lanrhymni' (that include the common prepositions i 'to' and o 'from') could be understood as referring to a place called either Glanrhymni or Llanrhymni.Gwynedd O. Pierce, 'Under the Eaves: Some Place Names in the Rhymni Valley Area', Morgannwg, 36 (1992), 98. The district is predominantly composed of large scale council estates and is bounded by the wards of Pontprennau & Old St. Mellons to the north, Rumney to the south, Penylan to the southwest, and Pentwyn to the west. The electoral ward of Llanrumney falls within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff South and Penarth. Eastern Leisure Centre The area has a number of shopping precincts, the largest of which can be found on Countisbury Avenue. The Eastern Leisure Centre is scheduled to be refurbished at a cost of \u00a36.8m. Llanrumney Hall, a reputedly haunted pub, is one of several local locations associated with the pirate Henry Morgan. and is claimed to have been his home from 1635. Llanrumney Library Llanrumney Library opened in 2008, replacing the old Llanrumney Library. Cyncoed Ladies F.C. of the Welsh Premier Women's Football League have been based in the area since 2005 when they were formed. ==Politics== Llanrumney is in the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff South & Penarth and the Welsh Assembly constituency of the same name. Llanrumney is both an electoral ward and a community in Cardiff Council. The ward elects three councillors to represent Llanrumney on Cardiff Council every five years. The community of Llanrumney does not have a community council. ==Transport== Cardiff Bus services 49 and 50 serve the area, with buses running frequently to and from the city centre. Routes 65 and 65A link Llanrumney, along with a number of other local suburbs, to the Heath Hospital. The area is currently accessible only via various junctions along Newport Road, which also connects the suburb to the city centre to the south west and St Mellons, the A48(M) and Newport to the north east. In February 2008, Cardiff County Council approved plans for a new Park and Ride facility to be created on the Rhymney River flood plain adjacent to the nearby Pentwyn Interchange of the A48. In November the same year the site was cleared and access roads created from the nearby A48, signalling the beginning of the project. In December 2019, as part of the council's East Cardiff Industrial Strategy, a plan was announced to ease congestion in east Cardiff by constructing a road and a bridge to link Llanrumney with the Pentwyn Park & Ride site. ==Education== Llanumney has six primary schools: Bryn Hafod, Pen-y- Bryn, Glan-yr-Afon, St Cadoc's, St Mellon's and Bro Eirwg, and one secondary school. Llanrumney High School closed in 2013 as part of the Council's plans to reorganise secondary education in the city. ===High School closure=== On 20 March 2009 Cardiff Council published a legal statutory notice announcing their intention to close Llanrumney High School by 2012 as part of Cardiff County Council's plans to reduce surplus places in schools across the city. Pupils will be merged with those from Rumney High School, which is also to close, and will be housed at a new English medium secondary school built on the Rumney Recreation Ground.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/7955231.stm BBC Wales News Online \"School shake-up notice published\" 20/03/2010 The plans led to the formation by residents from the communities of Llanrumney, Rumney, St Mellons and Trowbridge, Cardiff of the Rumney Recreation and Eastern Leisure Centre Action Group (RREEL), seeking to preserve the Rumney Recreation Ground from the proposed development.
