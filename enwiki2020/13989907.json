    "text": "Progression, previously stylized as PROGRESSION, is a music creation and performance computer program created by NOTION Music (now owned by PreSonus). Created for use on Microsoft Windows and macOS laptops or desktops, Progression focuses on composition for guitar, but can also be used to compose for keyboards (piano, electric piano, and clavinet), bass (electric and upright), and drums (standard drum set). As of April 2019, Progression is no longer available for sale in the PreSonus online store, nor via dealers worldwide. ==Summary== Users can compose in Progression both in standard notation and tablature (\"tab\") at the same time and hear their musical ideas played back with digital samples from Victor Wooten (bass), Roy \"Futureman\" Wooten (drums), Neil Zaza (guitar), and others. Playback features include built-in effects and amp simulators, customizable bends and slides, and continuous real-time control of playback tempos. With its MIDI Out features, users can incorporate sounds from other sound libraries outside of Progression. ==Input== Users can enter notes, rests, and chords with standard computer keyboard/mouse input (including keyboard shortcuts) or by MIDI keyboard, MIDI guitar, MusicXML file, MIDI file, or any mix of these. Other input options include an interactive fretboard (that a user can add/remove strings and assign alternate tunings) and chord library. Changes made to the tab staff automatically update an instrument's standard notation staff and vice versa. ==Output== The program's audio mixer includes gain, pan, and mute/solo buttons for individual instruments, and also provides access to effects and digital channels for routing audio to a mixing board or digital audio workstation. In addition to Progression files, output options include print-out, wav digital audio file, standard MIDI file, or MusicXML file. ==Notes== ==See also== * PreSonus * Notion (software) * List of music software ==External links== * Category:Scorewriters ",
