    "text": "Sunday's Illness () is a 2018 Spanish drama film directed by Ram\u00f3n Salazar. It was screened in the Panorama section at the 68th Berlin International Film Festival. ==Plot== Anabel is hosting a large dinner party and recognises one of the catering staff as Chiara, the daughter she has not seen since she abandoned her at the age of eight over thirty years ago. She arranges to meet Chiara to find out why she has re-appeared. Chiara requests that she spend 10 days with her. Anabel's husband and the family lawyer are suspicious of Chiara's motives, but after she agrees to sign a contract waiving any rights she had as a family member, they agree to the plan. Before leaving, Anabel informs her other, younger, daughter that she has a-half sister, who then asks her to be kind to Chiara. Chiara drives Anabel into the countryside to a remote community where she lives in her childhood home. During the following days the tensions build between the two women, and Chiara refuses to reveal what she wants to achieve, saying that she doesn't need or want to forgive Anabel. Chiara becomes drunk during a party at the local town and passes out for over a day. After giving Anabel some magic mushroom infused tea, she tells her that she is seriously ill. The next day, during an excursion on a sled, Chiara becomes sick and is taken to hospital. Anabel is told the extent of Chiara's condition by the staff. They return home and Anabel asks Chiara how she can help her. Chiara states that she only wants one thing and if Anabel won't do it she can leave. She whispers in Anabel's ear and immediately afterwards Anabel packs her belongings and departs. She travels to Paris and meets with Chiara's father. They discuss their previous relationship in dispassionate terms, before the conversation turns to Chiara. Her father said that he offered to help her but she refused. Anabel returns to the farmhouse and finds Chiara collapsed but conscious nearby. She tenderly undresses her and carries her into the lake. Chiara says that she is not afraid and Anabel slowly lowers her into water, holding her under until she stops struggling. ==Cast== * Susi S\u00e1nchez as Anabel * B\u00e1rbara Lennie as Chiara * Richard Bohringer as Matthieu * David Kammenos as Matthieu Joven * Bruna Gonz\u00e1lez as Chiara Ni\u00f1a * Greta Fern\u00e1ndez as Greta * Miguel \u00c1ngel Sol\u00e1 as Bernab\u00e9 * Manuel Castillo as Jefe Protocolo * Ima Ranedo as Se\u00f1ora Cena * M\u00f2nica Van Campen as Mujer Cena * Fred Adenis as Tob\u00edas * Iv\u00e1n Morales as Guillem * Carla Linares as Asistente * Abdellatif Hwidar as Lugare\u0144o * Lucy Tillett as Mujer Bosque ==Reception== On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 18 reviews, and an average rating of 7.0/10. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 films Category:2018 drama films Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish drama films Category:Spanish- language films ",
