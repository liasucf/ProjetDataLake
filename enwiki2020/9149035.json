Citation: > For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life > above and beyond the call of duty. Troops B and C, while conducting a > reconnaissance mission along a road were suddenly attacked by a Viet Cong > regiment, supported by mortars, recoilless rifles and machine guns, from > concealed positions astride the road. Sgt. Long abandoned the relative > safety of his armored personnel carrier and braved a withering hail of enemy > fire to carry wounded men to evacuation helicopters. As the platoon fought > its way forward to resupply advanced elements, Sgt. Long repeatedly exposed > himself to enemy fire at point blank range to provide the needed supplies. > While assaulting the Viet Cong position, Sgt. Long inspired his comrades by > fearlessly standing unprotected to repel the enemy with rifle fire and > grenades as they attempted to mount his carrier. When the enemy threatened > to overrun a disabled carrier nearby, Sgt. Long again disregarded his own > safety to help the severely wounded crew to safety. As he was handing arms > to the less seriously wounded and reorganizing them to press the attack, an > enemy grenade was hurled onto the carrier deck. Immediately recognizing the > imminent danger, he instinctively shouted a warning to the crew and pushed > to safety one man who had not heard his warning over the roar of battle. > Realizing that these actions would not fully protect the exposed crewmen > from the deadly explosion, he threw himself over the grenade to absorb the > blast and thereby saved the lives of 8 of his comrades at the expense of his > life. Throughout the battle, Sgt. Long's extraordinary heroism, courage and > supreme devotion to his men were in the finest tradition of the military > service, and reflect great credit upon himself and the U.S. Army. ==See also== *List of Medal of Honor recipients *List of Medal of Honor recipients for the Vietnam War ==References== * * Category:1939 births Category:1966 deaths Category:American military personnel killed in the Vietnam War Category:United States Army Medal of Honor recipients Category:People from Lawrence County, Ohio Category:United States Army soldiers Category:Deaths by hand grenade Category:Vietnam War recipients of the Medal of Honor Category:People from Oak Hill, Ohio ",
