Like the other cold corals, the stony corals of the Comau fiord region, Desmopyhllum dianthus, Caryophyllia huinayensis and Tethocyathus endesa they found in unusually shallow water on fiord walls 15m down and below.F\u00f6rsterra, G., H\u00e4ussermann, V., & Laudien, J.

It is threatened with extinction from aquaculture dropping faeces, or nutrients firstly causing sedimentation, secondly supporting the conditions for harmful algal blooms through primary production and eutrophicationFolke, C., Kautsky, N., & Troell, M. (1994). The costs of eutrophication from salmon farming: implications for policy. Journal of environmental management, 40(2), 173-182.. This is supplemented by internationally significant use of antibiotics, copper from antifouling, abandoned gear and invasive salmon species escapees. It is also threatened by sedimentation and smothering from a new road proposed close to the fiord walls where the remaining population is found. Historic overfishing from long lines and shellfish diving has also been a concern. The marine indigenous community of Ma\u00f1ihueico-Huinay (Espacio Costero Marino de Pueblos Indigenarios) are concerned for its future and are looking for international support in its preservation, as well as those other cold coral species threatened listed above. == References == *Breedy, O., Cairns, S.
