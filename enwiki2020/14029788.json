    "text": "Inheritance is a 2011 novel written by American author Christopher Paolini. It is the fourth novel in The Inheritance Cycle. The Inheritance Cycle was originally intended to be a trilogy, but Paolini has stated that during writing, the length of Brisingr grew, and the book was split into two parts to be published separately. Because of this, many plot elements originally intended for Brisingr are in Inheritance. Since the release of Inheritance, Paolini has expressed his future interest in expanding upon Alaga\u00ebsia and the Inheritance Cycle. In an interview, he talked about a potential \"book five,\" a prequel centering on Brom, and said that he has planned \"around seven more stories set in Alaga\u00ebsia \u2014 and one of those is in fact a series.\" ==Development== ===Decision for a fourth book=== In a video that was released on October 30, 2007, Christopher Paolini stated that during the work on the third book, he realized it would become too long and so he decided to split it into two separate books. His explanation is as follows: ===Publication announcement=== On March 23, 2011, Random House announced the title, cover artwork, and release date of Inheritance. It was released on November 8, 2011 in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, India, Australia, and Hungary. It was released with a first print of 2.5 million copies. ==Plot== The Varden attack the Empire city of Belatona. In the battle, Saphira, Eragon's dragon, is nearly killed by a Dauthdaert, a spear from the Dragon Wars that can bypass magical wards and kill dragons. Belatona is captured by the Varden, and an alliance is later formed between the Varden and the werecats. Afterwards, Eragon's cousin Roran is sent on a mission to capture Aroughs, which he succeeds at using unconventional tactics. Roran rejoins the Varden at Dras- Leona, which proves difficult to take, as it is under protection by Murtagh and his dragon Thorn. Jeod finds information about an incomplete sewer system under the city, which should provide access to it. Eragon, Arya, Angela, the werecat Solembum, and an elf named Wyrden enter this sewer system, to sneak into the city and open the gates for the Varden. However, the mission goes awry, as the tunnels are used by the priests of Helgrind, who separate the group, slay Wyrden, and capture Eragon and Arya. The priests worship the Ra'zac, and attempt to feed Eragon and Arya to Ra'zac hatchlings, although Angela and Solembum save them. Eragon is then able to open the city gates and defeat Murtagh and Thorn, allowing the Varden to take control of the city. As Eragon and Arya become drunk to celebrate their victory, Murtagh and Thorn attack their camp and capture Nasuada. In her absence, Eragon is appointed as the leader of the Varden, as they march on to Ur\u00fb'baen, the capital of the Empire. Eragon struggles under the weight of command, and recalls Solembum's previous advice, instructing him to journey to the Rock of Kuthian and open the Vault of Souls. As nobody has knowledge of the Rock of Kuthian, he questions Solembum, discovering that he had given the advice on instinct. During the conversation, Solembum appears to be possessed, giving Eragon. He discovers the Rock of Kuthian is located on Vroengard Island, and protected by magic which causes everyone, barring himself and Saphira, to forget about it upon hearing of it. He manages to inform Arya and Glaedr of this, and decides to journey to Vroengard. Glaedr joins Eragon and Saphira, while Arya stays behind and helps trick the Varden into thinking Eragon is still with them. Upon reaching the island, Eragon and Saphira find the Rock of Kuthian and learn that they must speak their true names in order to enter the Vault of Souls. Eventually, they find their true names and gain entry. Inside, they find a hoard of Eldunar\u00ed and dragon eggs, hidden away before Galbatorix destroyed the Riders. Umaroth, the dragon of the former leader of the Riders, who leads the Eldunar\u00ed, decides to join Eragon and the Varden to overthrow Galbatorix. Leaving some Eldunar\u00ed behind to guard the eggs in the event of their defeat, Eragon and the others leave Vroengard, losing their memories of the Vault. They make their way to Ur\u00fb'baen, under siege by the combined forces of the Varden, elves, werecats, Urgals and dwarves. Eragon reveals the Eldunar\u00ed to the leaders of the forces, and they plan an attack on the city. The combined forces of the Varden attack Ur\u00fb'baen while Eragon, Saphira, Arya, Elva, and elven spellcasters break into Galbatorix's citadel. They make their way to the throne room after progressing through a series of traps, during which the spellcasters are captured. In the throne room, Galbatorix easily subdues Eragon, Saphira, Arya, and Elva and informs them that he has learned the true name of the ancient language, referred to as the Word. With the Word, he is able to control the usage of magic with the ancient language, negating any spells they attempt, while possessing more Eldunar\u00ed. To amuse himself, he orders Murtagh and Eragon to fight using only their swords. Eragon defeats Murtagh, and persuades him to join his side. Murtagh, who had developed feelings for Nasuada in her captivity, has his true name changed, and turns on Galbatorix, using the Word to strip him of his wards. Enraged, Galbatorix incapacitates Murtagh, and battles Eragon, while Saphira and Thorn battle his dragon Shruikan. Using the Eldunar\u00ed, Eragon casts a spell to make Galbatorix experience the pain and suffering that he has caused, while Arya kills Shruikan with the Dauthdaert. Overwhelmed with Eragon's spell, Galbatorix uses magic to destroy himself, also destroying most of the citadel. Eragon, using the Eldunar\u00ed, is able to protect those in the citadel. To heal from their ordeal, Murtagh and Thorn decide to journey far away, teaching Eragon the Word before departing. Nasuada becomes the High Queen of Human Alaga\u00ebsia and King Orrin of Surda grudgingly pledges his allegiance to her. Arya returns to Du Weldenvarden to help choose a new queen for the elves after the death of her mother, Queen Islanzad\u00ed, in battle. She takes with her the remaining dragon egg, which hatches for her, and she names the dragon F\u00edrnen. She is also chosen to be queen of the elves. Eragon realizes that there is no safe place to raise the dragons and train new Riders in Alaga\u00ebsia. He thus decides to sail away with the Eldunar\u00ed and the eggs to a region far east of Alaga\u00ebsia. Eragon reworks the magic of the pact between Riders and dragons to allow dwarves and Urgals to become Riders. He leaves two eggs in Alaga\u00ebsia: one is to be sent to the dwarves, and the other to the Urgals. The future Riders will travel to Eragon's new home for training, while new eggs will be periodically sent back to Alaga\u00ebsia. Eragon and Saphira sadly say their farewells to their friends and family, but look forward to the future. ==Critical reception== Inheritance debuted at No. 1 on the USA Today's \"Best-Selling Books\" list, selling nearly half a million copies on the first day in the United States. On Goodreads, it has a score of 4.01 out of 5, as of October 1, 2018. The book received mixed reviews. Joshua Hill of Book Fantasy Review wrote that Inheritance was an improvement over previous books in the series and praised the characters of Roran, Arya, and Murtagh as \"three of the most interesting characters I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure to read\". However, Hill criticized the plot for being overly reliant on magic and the ending as being too similar to the final three chapters of The Lord of the Rings. Washington Post's Yvonne Zipp noted that, although the book is marketed to young adults, certain content may be too violent for younger readers, such as the scenes in which Nasuada is tortured and Arya's hand is degloved while trying to escape from shackles. Some reviews criticized the novel for being overly detailed and leaving unresolved plot threads. Shelby Scoffield of Deseret News called the book \"a sophisticated novel\" and \"a sense of closure to a truly great series\", but criticized Paolini's use of \"long and boring details\". Richard Marcus of the Seattle PI said that \"Paolini clutters up the book with page upon page of battles that could just as easily taken place off stage\" and that \"the last hundred or so pages of the book are spent in a very awkward attempt to tie up all the loose ends\". He also says that, \"In fact by wasting so much time on insignificant details along the way, the final confrontation with Galbatorix when it comes feels rushed. Even worse, discovering the location of the Rock of Kuthian and the Vault of Souls feels incredibly contrived.\" == References == == External links == * * Category:2011 American novels Category:2011 fantasy novels Category:Inheritance Cycle Category:Novels by Christopher Paolini ",
