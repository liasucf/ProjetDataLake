Smith is the son of former NSW Attorney General Greg Smith, and trained as a plumber. He served on Kogarah Council prior to his election to parliament. Nathaniel made headlines when he saved the day in NSW parliament - there was a delegate from the United States visiting the parliament and the sewers were blocked up and none of the toilets would flush. Nathaniel recalled his trusty plumbing experienced and had those boggers running in no time. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly ",
