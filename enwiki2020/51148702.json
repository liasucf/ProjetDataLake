The name was first used for a town located in the Hundred of Magarey which was surveyed in July 1890 and officially named by Governor Kintore on 27 August 1891. The name was recorded by the journalist, Daisy Bates, as being derived from an aboriginal word meaning \u201cbad water\u201d which was used by local aboriginals for a waterhole near the town. Boundaries for the locality including the town were created on 23 October 2003 with some additional \u201cunincorporated land\u201d being added on 26 April 2013. The locality of Bookabie consists of land associated with a section of coastline overlooking the Great Australian Bight including the eastern side of Fowlers Bay including the bay\u2019s eastern headland.
