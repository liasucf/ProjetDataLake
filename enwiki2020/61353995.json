The Ice Age Trail follows the Gandy Dancer State Trail for 19 miles from St. Croix Falls past the town of Luck. == History == A gandy dancer was a slang term used for American railroad workers that would build and maintain tracks by hand. The term likely originated from the Gandy Manufacturing Company based in Chicago which produced railroad tools. These workers were known to sing and keep their voices and feet in unison which led to them being described as dancers. In 1990 a naming contest was held for the naming of the trail. The name Gandy Dancer was chosen to honor the railroad workers who built the tracks. == Use == Gandy Dancer Trail Sign Trail activities vary depending on the trail segment and time of year. Hiking and bicycling is open throughout the entire trail however bikes with an off-road tread are recommended for the northern segment due to the soft and uneven parts of the trail. The Douglas County section in the northern segment also allows all-terrain vehicles year-round and horseback riding. Snowmobiling is allowed on the trail with the local counties deciding when to open and close the trails to snowmobilers. Hunting and trapping is not permitted anywhere along the trail. == References == == External Links == Gandy Dancer State Trail - Northern Segment (DNR website) Gandy Dancer State Trail - Southern Segment (DNR website) Friends of Gandy Dancer State Trail Website Gandy Dancer Trail Marathon Website Category:Rail trails in Wisconsin Category:Rail trails in Minnesota ",
