It Happened in Brooklyn was Sinatra's third film for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who had purchased his contract from RKO because Louis B. Mayer was a huge Sinatra fan.Turner Classic Movies The film contains six songs written by Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne, and included \"The Song's Gotta Come From the Heart\" (performed as a duet by Sinatra and Durante), \"The Brooklyn Bridge\", \"Whose Baby Are You\", \"I Believe\", \"Time After Time\", and \"It's the Same Old Dream\". ==Plot== A post-World War II feel-good movie, It Happened in Brooklyn begins in England at the end of the war. Danny Miller (Frank Sinatra) is with a group of GIs awaiting transportation home to the US. On his last night there, he meets Jamie Shellgrove (Peter Lawford), who is a very shy young man whose grandfather feels should be taken under someone's wing. After observing Miller come to his grandson's aid at the piano, he asks Danny to speak with his son, to give him \"some words of encouragement\". In order to look good in front of the Brooklyn-born nurse (Gloria Grahame) who scolded him for not making friends, he agrees, even going so far as to saying what would really fix Jamie up would be for him to come to Brooklyn. As he rushes out to catch his transport to the docks for the voyage home, Danny discovers that Jamie is really the heir to a duke. Upon Danny's return to Brooklyn, the film revolves around characters realizing their dreams of escaping working-class drudgery: in Sinatra's case to become a singer/musician rather than a shipping clerk, in Lawford's case to break out of his extreme shyness to gain a wife and a career as a songwriter, and in Grayson's case to break out of her school teaching job to star in the opera (although this last is not shown coming to pass, but she presumably lives happily ever after as she is brought to England as the fianc\u00e9e of the Lawford character, who is heir to a dukedom). The story ends with Danny realizing the nurse he talked to at the start of the film is the only girl for him, and since he figures she's got to be back in Brooklyn herself, and he's got all kinds of friends now, he's optimistic about finding and winning her. The film's tagline was \"Happy songs! Happy stars! Happy romance!\". Lawford dances while singing a song, a performance that was particularly well received by both critics and public, outshining future fellow Rat Pack member Sinatra. One highlight of the film is seeing and hearing Sinatra and Grayson singing \"L\u00e0 ci darem la mano\" from Mozart's 1787 opera Don Giovanni. ==Cast== * Frank Sinatra as Danny Webson Miller * Kathryn Grayson as Anne Fielding * Peter Lawford as Jamie Shellgrove * Jimmy Durante as Nick Lombardi * Gloria Grahame as Nurse * Marcy McGuire as Rae Jakobi * Aubrey Mather as Digby John * Tamara Shayne as Mrs. Kardos * William Roy as Leo Kardos (as Billy Roy) * William Haade as Police Sergeant ==Bobby Long== The movie also features the film debut of a multi-talented preteen actor, Bobby Long, who after filming, mysteriously disappeared from the spotlight without any explanation. His character, Johnny O'Brien, is described as being the littlest student at New Utrecht High School. He usually sneaks into the school gym at night to do some acrobatic exercises so he can grow as tall as the rest of his classmates. One night as Danny and Nick were about to have dinner, Nick decides to close the gym windows with Danny's help. Suddenly, they're intruded by Johnny as he does his somersault exercises. The duo meets the boy and learns about his dilemma and help him realize his potential by showing some support and faith with the tune 'I Believe'. Johnny then shows them how amazingly talented he truly is by singing and tap dancing around them before showing off a big acrobatic stunt finale. Johnny O'Brien appears in the movie in 4 1/2 scenes and has 6 lines in total. His final appearance was the concert scene at the record shop where Leo Kardos performs his piano solo. Bobby Long never got to appear in another movie after doing IHIB. Neither did he ever appear in any other media presentation like radio, tv, etc. There was also a rumor that claimed he suffered a horrible accident doing the big dance number. No one ever went looking for him or his family since. Information into Long's disappearance has yet to be investigated. ==Filming== The original director was supposed to be George Sidney, but he was replaced by Richard Whorf, who is probably best known for his television directing, particularly The Beverly Hillbillies, Gunsmoke and My Three Sons. Filming was interrupted for approximately ten days when Durante had to go and finish filming on This Time for Keeps. The piano solos in the film were performed by the pianist and composer Andr\u00e9 Previn. ==Box office== The film earned $1,877,000 in the US and Canada and $787,000 elsewhere, resulting a loss of $138,000. Variety says the film earned $2,150,000 in rentals.\"Top Grossers of 1947\", Variety, 7 January 1948 p 63 ==Critical reception== It Happened in Brooklyn was generally well received, Variety noting that: \"Much of the lure will result from Frank Sinatra's presence in the cast. Guy's acquired the Bing Crosby knack of nonchalance, throwing away his gag lines with fine aplomb. He kids himself in a couple of hilarious sequences and does a takeoff on Jimmy Durante, with Durante aiding him, that's sockeroo.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Review, Variety Category:1947 films Category:1947 musical comedy films Category:1947 romantic comedy films Category:American musical comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:American romantic musical films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Richard Whorf Category:Films set in Brooklyn Category:Films set in England Category:Films set in New York City Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:1947 comedy films ",
