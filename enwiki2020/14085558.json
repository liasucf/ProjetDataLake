    "text": "{| |} The Commerce de Paris class were a series of ships of the line of the French Navy, designed in 1804 by Jacques-No\u00ebl San\u00e9 as a shortened version of his 118-gun three-deckers, achieved by removing a pair of guns from each deck so that they became 110-gun ships. Two ships were built to this design in France. Four more were begun at Antwerp in 1810\u20131811, but these were never completed and were broken up on the ways; three more were ordered in Holland, but these were never laid down. == Ships == * :Builder: Toulon shipyard :Ordered: 14 May 1804 :Laid down: October 1804 :Launched: 8 August 1806 :Completed: May 1807 :Fate: razeed in 1825.
