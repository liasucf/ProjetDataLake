It was produced by Jerry Masucci and Puchi Lavoe. == Reception == Revent\u00f3 has been called \"a solid album in the classic New York salsa style\". According to Lavoe's biographer Marc Shapiro, the album was critically acclaimed upon release, although \"it was not hailed as a landmark or breakthrough H\u00e9ctor Lavoe album\"; he goes on to say that it further established Lavoe as a talented, legitimate singer. Revento entered the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart (New York) on 15 June 1985 at position 12; it stayed in the charts until November that year. ==Track listing== # \"De Qu\u00e9 Tama\u00f1o Es Tu Amor\" - 3:33 # \"La Vida Es Bonita\" - 4:11 # \"Don Fulano de Tal\" - 3:46 # \"La Fama\" - 5:20 # \"D\u00e9jala Que Siga\" - 6:27 # \"C\u00e1ncer\" - 6:53 # \"\u00bfPor Qu\u00e9 No Puedo Ser Feliz?\" - 4:23 ==Personnel== * H\u00e9ctor Lavoe (lead vocals, backing vocals) * Joe Torres, Isidro Infante (piano) * Sal Cuevas (bass) * Milton Cardona (congas, backing vocals) * Pablo Rosario (bongo) * John Andrews (timbales) * Lewis Kahn, Leo Pineda (trombone) * H\u00e9ctor Casanova (maracas) * Johnny Pacheco (g\u00fciro, flute solo in \"D\u00e9jala que siga\") * Mario Andreola (guitar) * Richie Ray (piano solo in \"C\u00e1ncer\") * Jos\u00e9 Mangual (backing vocals) * Brenda Feliciano (Coro in \"La vida es bonita\"), * Juan Viloria Villarman \"Juancho\" (Coro in \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no puedo ser feliz?\") ;Technical * Jerry Masucci (production) * Puchi Lavoe (production) == References == Category:1985 albums Category:H\u00e9ctor Lavoe albums Category:Fania Records albums ",
