    "text": "The Mausoleum of Saladin holds the resting place and grave of the medieval Muslim Ayyubid Sultan Saladin. It is adjacent to the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria. It was built in 1196, three years after the death of Saladin.Mannheim, 2001, p.88. Originally the tomb complex included the burial of Salah al-Din and Madrassah al-Aziziah of which little remains except a few columns and an internal arch adjacent to the renovated tomb of Saladin. The mausoleum presently houses two sarcophagi: one made of wood, said to contain Saladin's remains, and one made of marble, was built in homage to Saladin in late nineteenth century by Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II and was later restored by German emperor Wilhelm II.Saladin, 2011, Anne-Marie Edde, Caption to PictureMan, 2015, p.264. Along with a marble sarcophagus, Wilhelm II, a golden ornate gilt bronze wreath was also put on the marble sarcophagus, which was later removed by either Faisal I or Lawrence of Arabia who later deposited it in the Imperial War Museum. ==Gallery== File:Damascus-53.jpg|c. 1900 photo of the marble sarcophagus built by Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II and later restored by Wilhelm IISaladin, 2011, Anne-Marie Edde, Caption to Picture File:Entrance to Saladin's Mausoleum .jpg|Entrance to Saladin's Mausoleum in 2019 File:Saladin's Original Tomb 2019.jpg|Saladin's Original Tomb in 2019 File:Courtyard of Saladin's Tomb.jpg|Courtyard of Saladin's Mausoleum 2019 File:Tomb of Saladin.JPG|Mausoleum walls with tiles added in Ottoman era. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ** Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1196 Category:Mausoleums in Syria Category:Ayyubid architecture Category:Buildings and structures inside the walled city of Damascus Category:Saladin ",
