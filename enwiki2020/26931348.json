It serves the E Line.http://backup.buildexpo.org/phase2_overview.php Although opponents filed a lawsuit to halt construction, they were ultimately unsuccessful in their efforts (see Opposition section, below). ==Location and design== {|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 0px gray;\" width=50 rowspan=3 valign=top|Platform |style=\"border-bottom:solid 0px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Westbound |style=\"border-bottom:solid 0px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=400|\u2190 toward Downtown Santa Monica (Expo/Sepulveda) |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border- left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform, doors will open on the left |- |style=\"border- bottom:solid 0px gray;border-top:solid 0px gray;\" width=100|Eastbound |style=\"border-bottom:solid 0px gray;\"|\u2192 toward 7th Street/Metro Center (Palms) \u2192 |} Westwood/Rancho Park Station is located at Exposition Boulevard just east of Westwood Boulevard, between Westwood Boulevard and Overland Avenue.http://backup.buildexpo.org/phase2/Phase%202%20FEIR%20Documents/02_ProjectAlternatives_FEIR.pdf This station is located in Rancho Park, an affluent single-family neighborhood south of Westwood and southwest of Century City. The station location is a short walk from the Westside Pavilion shopping mall. The final environmental impact report included 170 surface parking spaces at this station, with an option to remove all parking for transit users (20 parking spaces would be provided for local residents only). In March 2011, the Expo Board approved the no-parking option. Sepulveda station, less than one mile away, has a parking lot. ==Opposition== In the Final EIR, Metro staff recommended routing the Expo Line along the Exposition Right-Of-Way through Rancho Park (which includes Westwood Station), at-grade. During the EIR process, a group of neighbors known as Neighbors For Smart Rail (NFSR) organized to oppose at-grade light rail through this ROW. The group claims that this design will be dangerous if built as specified, and that Metro failed to comply with environmental law. Metro publicly disputed these claims, as did several groups supporting the current design.http://smarterrail.org/ On 5 March 2010, NFSR filed a lawsuit to halt construction of Expo Phase 2. This lawsuit was dismissed by the Superior Court of the State of California on February 22, 2011. ==Bus connections== * Culver CityBus: 3 * Santa Monica Big Blue Bus: 8, Rapid 12 ==References== * Curbed Staff (November 24, 2014) \"Expo Line Extension is 80 Percent Done; See the New Stations\" Curbed Los Angeles ==External links== *Metro Expo Line Construction Authority *Project Website, Metro Rail Expo Corridor, Phase 2 to Culver City *Expo Line Phase-2 Photo Gallery Category:Los Angeles Metro Rail stations Category:E Line (Los Angeles Metro) Category:Railway stations in Los Angeles Category:Rancho Park, Los Angeles Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 2016 Category:2016 establishments in California ",
