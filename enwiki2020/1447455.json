When it was closed by the Russian Imperial authorities in 1905, he was forced to continue his education abroad in Marburg, Germany, where he studied from 1907 to 1910.Marek Jaworski, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz, pp. 26\u201336. ==Career== As he describes in his Memoirs, it was a chance encounter with a male relative, whose height made him stand out above the crowd at a Krak\u00f3w railroad station, upon the outbreak of World War I that led Tatarkiewicz to spend the war years in Warsaw.W\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz, Wspomnienia (Memoirs), p. 144. There he began his career as a lecturer in philosophy, teaching at a girls' school on Mokotowska Street, across the street from where J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski was to reside during his first days after World War I.

In 1919\u201321 he was professor at Stefan Batory University in Wilno, in 1921\u201323 at the University of Pozna\u0144, and in 1923\u201361 again at the University of Warsaw.

During World War II, risking his life, he conducted underground lectures in German-occupied WarsawW\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz, Wspomnienia (Memoirs), p. 165\u201368. (one of the auditors was Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz).W\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz, Wspomnienia (Memoirs), p. 171. After the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising (August\u2013October 1944) he again consciously risked his life when retrieving a manuscript from the gutter, where a German soldier had hurled it (this and other materials were later published as a book, in English translation titled Analysis of Happiness).* W\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz, Analysis of Happiness, p. xi. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz died the day after his 94th birthday.

Characteristically, he saw even that indignity as a blessing in disguise, as it gave him freedom from academic duties, and leisure to pursue research and writing.W\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz, Wspomnienia (Memoirs), p. 119. Tatarkiewicz reflected that at all crucial junctures of his life, he had failed to foresee events, many of them tragic, but that this had probably been for the better, since he could not have altered them anyway.W\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz, Wspomnienia (Memoirs), p. 181. ==View on happiness== Tatarkiewicz believed that \"satisfaction with particular things... is only partial satisfaction; happiness requires total satisfaction, that is, satisfaction with life as a whole.\"https://search.proquest.com/openview/6b042353db50565f7e667978915d1ae3/1?pq- origsite=gscholar&cbl;=1818345 == Major works == Tatarkiewicz belonged to the interwar Lw\u00f3w\u2013Warsaw school of logic, created by Kazimierz Twardowski, which gave reborn Poland many scholars and scientists: philosophers, logicians, psychologists, sociologists, and organizers of academia.W\u0142adys\u0142aw Tatarkiewicz, Zarys dziej\u00f3w filozofii w Polsce (A Brief History of Philosophy in Poland), pp. 31\u201332.
