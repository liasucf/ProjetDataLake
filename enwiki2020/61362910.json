    "text": "American Book Review is a literary journal operating out of the University of Houston-Victoria. Their mission statement is to \u201cspecialize in reviews of frequently neglected published works of fiction, poetry, and literary and cultural criticism from small, regional, university, ethnic, avant-garde, and women's presses.\u201d In addition to publishing the American Book Review six times a year, American Book Review and the University of Houston-Victoria organize the UHV/ABR Reading Series. Hosting over a hundred speakers since the American Book Review's conception, the reading series \u201cfeatures nationally recognized writers on extended visits to the Victoria campus.\u201d Guests read from their most recent works, participate in discussion with UHV faculty and staff, and offer signed editions of their work for purchasing. ==History== The American Book Review was founded in 1977 by Ronald Sukenick. According to author and essayist Raymond Federman, in his reading with American Book Review in 2007, Sukenick founded the American Book Review because The New York Times had stopped reviewing books by \u201cthat group labeled experimental writers,\u201d and Sukenick wanted to start a \u201cjournal where we can review books that everyone is ignoring.\u201d Federman and Sukenick both funded the beginning of American Book Review, with the \u201cAmerican\u201d in the title suggesting that the journal would review books from all across American and not primarily focus on books from New York. Originally operating out of University of Colorado at Boulder in 1987, ABR later moved to Illinois State University in 1995. In The Employment of English Michael B\u00e9rub\u00e9 writes,\u201cWhen Ron Sukenick folded the University of Colorado (Boulder) branch of FC2, Normal also picked up publication of American Book Review, one of the liveliest general-purpose reader\u2019s guides for everything.\u201d The publication then moved to the University of Houston-Victoria in 2006. In 2009, ABR, through an agreement with Johns Hopkins University Press, allowed online editions of its issues to be available through the database ProjectMuse. The current American Book Review staff includes Jeffrey R. Di Leo as publisher and editor, Jeffrey A. Sartain as managing editor, and JJ Hernandez as Assistant Editor. ==References== ==External links== * Official Website Category:Bimonthly magazines published in the United States Category:Book review magazines Category:Literary magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1977 Category:Magazines published in Colorado Category:Magazines published in Illinois Category:Magazines published in Texas ",
