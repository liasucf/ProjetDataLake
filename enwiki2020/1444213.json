She remained in post until January 2005 when she was removed from the position, following strong criticism over long hospital waiting lists. An independent report showed that even though waiting list time targets were higher than in England and Scotland, Hutt had still failed to meet them. As a result, she faced criticism from all the major political parties in Wales, with the strongest coming from within her own party. As a result, her position became untenable, as some became worried that the problems could even damage the case for further Welsh devolution. She became Minister for Assembly Business and Chief Whip, with additional responsibility for Openness in Government; Communications Strategy; co-ordinating Government policy in relation to children and Equality of Opportunity. In the first Cabinet of the Third Assembly, she was appointed Minister for Budget and Assembly Business (31 May 2007). In the coalition, Cabinet announced on 19 July 2007 she became Minister for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills. She left the government during the November 2017 reshuffle, but returned as Chief Whip thirteen months later under new First Minister Mark Drakeford. She is the only MS to have served as a Minister in every Welsh Government to date. ==Personal life== In July 1984 Hutt married Labour councillor Michael Trickey, they have two daughters. ==Offices held== ==References== ==External links== * Personal Website * Biography at the Welsh Assembly Government * Profile on BBC Website Category:1949 births Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics Category:Alumni of the University of Bristol Category:Alumni of the University of Kent Category:Members of South Glamorgan County Council Category:Living people Category:Members of the Welsh Assembly Government Category:School governors Category:Wales AMs 1999\u20132003 Category:Wales AMs 2003\u20132007 Category:Wales AMs 2007\u20132011 Category:Wales AMs 2011\u20132016 Category:Wales AMs 2016\u20132021 Category:Welsh Labour Members of Senedd Cymru \u2013 Welsh Parliament Category:Female members of Senedd Cymru \u2013 Welsh Parliament Category:Ministers for Finance of Wales Category:Women finance ministers Category:Politics of the Vale of Glamorgan Category:20th-century British women politicians Category:21st-century British women politicians Category:Women members of the Welsh Assembly Government ",
