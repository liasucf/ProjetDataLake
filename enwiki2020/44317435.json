    "text": "The Industrial and Mining Water Research Unit (abbreviated IMWaRU) is one of several research entities based in the School of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. It provides research as well as supervision to masters and doctorate students within the University, as well as consulting to industry. ==Unit Structure== The unit deals with cross disciplinary water issues relating to industry and mining.Harding, KG, 2014, Accounting for water use in the process industries, Chemical Technology, April 2014, p3, retrieved 14 November 2014. As such the group includes experts in chemical engineering, microbiology and other sciences. The unit includes five NRF rated researchers and over 20 masters and doctoral level postgraduate students in the faculties of engineering and science. ==Members== The group currently comprises 7 academics (alphabetically - Mogopoleng (Paul) Chego, Kevin Harding, Michelle Low, Craig Sheridan, Geoffrey Simate, Karl Rumbold and Lizelle van Dyk), as well as several postgraduate students. ==Logo== IMWaRU icon The logo of the Unit is in the shape of a drop of water, with the left half representing the blue of water. The right half of the drop is modified to show grass and how water is linked to all life. Underneath the icon are the letters IMWaRU, while to the right, the name \"Industrial and Mining Water Research Unit\" appears. ==Location== Richard Ward Building, to the right, home to the Industrial and Mining Water Research Unit. The unit is housed in several buildings across the University, most notably in the Richard Ward Building on East campus.Google+, IMWaRU, Google Maps location, retrieved 13 November 2014. Additionally, some members are located in the Biology Building on East Campus and have access to laboratories in that building. They also have access to an outdoor facility on West Campus where constructed wetland, and other outdoor, experiments take place. == Research == 2nd floor laboratories of the Richard Ward Building, upgraded in 2013 for use by IMWaRU and others. The group has a broad range of research publications in the areas as listed below: * Acid mine drainage (AMD) - methods of reducing, treating and managing AMD.Sheridan , C, 2013.

Active collaborations include the Schools of Law, Chemistry, Civil and Mining Engineering and the Global Change Institute at the university, in addition to the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany. They have also collaborated with the Universities of Cape Town, Geneva, Queensland and the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. IMWaRU has had several Technology Innovation Agency (TIA) projects run through Wits Enterprise. The unit exhibited with several other groups at Mine Closure 2014.Mine Closure 2014 , Exhibitors list, 9th International Conference on Mine Closure, 1\u20133 October 2014, Sandton Convention Centre Johannesburg, South Africa, retrieved 7 November 2014. == Presentations == Constructed wetland equipment used in research experiments by the group.
