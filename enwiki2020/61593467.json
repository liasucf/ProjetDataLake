Yenght is the first game of Dinamic Software, and the first graphic adventure game published in the Spanish market. ==Gameplay== ==Plot== The player's mission is to find the fountain of youth. ==Development== The development process was both handmade and homemade - tapes were not manufactured until they had received enough orders to justify them ordering copies of the print covers and making duplicates of the cassette tapes. Originally they received a few tens of mail orders, but this later ballooned into several hundreds. ==Reception== El Mundo Del Spectrum wrote that despite its simplicity, the game \"overflowed with magic and charm\". IGN recommended that players take out a paper and pencil to draw a map and avoid getting lost in the game's world. ===Legacy=== The game was featured as part of FX Museum's official launch celebrating 30 years of their company's video games \\- by this point, Dinamic Software had evolved into FX Interactive. == References == * Microhobby 1,Microhobby 2, Microhobby 3 == External links == * * Yenght at World of Spectrum * Category:1984 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Video games developed in Spain Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:ZX Spectrum-only games ",
