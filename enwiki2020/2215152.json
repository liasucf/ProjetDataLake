The city of Sip\u00e1n is dated from 50\u2013700 AD, the same time as the Moche Period.Horz & Kallfass 1998, p. 9 ==Significance== Larco Museum Collection. Sip\u00e1n is an archaeological site where royal tombs were discovered and excavated between 1987\u20131990,Horz & Kallfass 1998, p. 9 a fairly recent find in the last 30 years, and is considered to be a very important archaeological discovery. Many of the tombs were looted, yet the artifacts that remained and were discovered by archaeologists play an important role in understanding the Moche rulers and tradition. Tombs have been found also in Sip\u00e1n's Huaca Rajada, an area near Chiclayo. The tombs in the area are of adobe construction, of pyramidal shape, and have now shown erosion which could have been exacerbated over time by successive El Ni\u00f1o events. There is very little research on the commoners of Sip\u00e1n, yet it is well known that the commoners often paid a tax through labor which allowed for the creation of the burial platforms for the Lords of Sip\u00e1n.Bawden 1999, p. 105 These platforms and other adobe structures are often made with marked adobe bricks which tracked this labor in order to pay off taxes.Quilter & Castillo B. 2010, p. 148 Other than providing labor for the Lord there is very little known specifically about Moche commoners from Sip\u00e1n. The tombs of Sip\u00e1n allowed for archaeologists and anthropologists to get a better understanding of the Sacrifice Ceremony of the Sip\u00e1n rulers that had been illustrated on murals, ceramics, and other decorative goods.Bawden 1999, p. 112 The Sacrifice Ceremonies were often depicted with prisoners among gods or royalty.Bawden 1999, p. 114 The tombs at Sip\u00e1n showed that rulers actually took part in such Sacrifice Ceremonies when looking at the artifacts uncovered including: adornments and a headdress that matched the illustrations of the ceremony along with large knives and tools that would have been used for bloodletting and decapitation.Bawden 1999, p. 114Quilter & Castillo B. 2010, p. 49 ==Looting== Reconstruction of the tomb of the Lord of Sip\u00e1n, Huaca Rajada In February 1987, a man by the name of Ernil Bernal led a band of huaqueros (tomb looters) who tunneled into one of the pyramids located at Huaca Rajada. Over the next few nights, they took a large number of valuable metal objects, destroying hundreds of ceramics and human remains in the process. Untold numbers of artifacts were lost, sold for profit to private collections on the black market.Atwood 2004 Alva arrived with the police a day or more later, after an exceedingly ornate mask had been confiscated from the huaqueros stash house and presented to the researcher.Kirkpatrick 1992, p. 28 There are a number of accounts from the events taking place upon the arrival of Alva and the police, however it is clear that they were able to drive the huaqueros away from the site, erect fences around the tombs, and begin excavation.Atwood 2002 Thereafter Alva and his team excavated 12 more tombs while villagers and huaqueros threw rocks and taunted them in an attempt to get the researchers out of the site and allow the looting to continue. The villagers were unsuccessful, however, as Alva completed his work which became the foundation of the \"Royal Tombs of Sip\u00e1n\" discussed below.Atwood 2002Kirkpatrick 1992 ==Metalwork== Mask at the Tumbas Reales de Sip\u00e1n Museum, Lambayeque, Peru During the excavations in 1987\u20131990, a spectacular treasure of gold and silver ornamental and ceremonial artifacts was recovered, dating to AD 50\u2013300.Horz & Kallfass 2000, p. 391 These objects demonstrate the outstanding craftsmanship of the Moche metalsmiths through their use of elaborate and advanced metalworking techniques. Moche smiths made these artifacts out of thin sheets of copper alloys, using electrochemical processes to purify an extremely thin (0.5\u20132.0 \u03bcm) layers of gold or silver coating.Horz & Kallfass 1998, p. 10 To make the artifacts, copper ingots were hammered into sheet metal and formed into the desired shape (e.g. a mask). While the exact method for adding the gold film to the outside is not known, one well-accepted theory is that gold was likely dissolved in aqueous solutions of corrosive compounds recovered from the Northern Peruvian deserts and brought to a low boil, after which the copper sheet was dipped in resulting in the reaction: : 2Au3+ \\+ 3Cu \u21cc 2Au0 \\+ 3Cu2+ thereby dissolving copper and depositing gold on the surface of the metal. The sheet is then heated to between 500 and 800oC, allowing the gold film to permanently bond to the surface. These gold films were not pure gold, but have been found to be of gold-copper-silver solutions (ex. Cu28Au2Ag).Horz & Kallfass 1998, p. 11Lechtman 1988 Some of the silver artifacts (namely individually made head-shaped beads, about 4.0 cm by 5.1 cm) were formed by alternating between hammering and annealing copper-silver alloy (Cu18Ag1Au) resulting in copper-oxide forming along the surface which can be removed using an acid (plant juices) or base (stale urine that has turned to ammonia). After many repetitions, the copper will be depleted resulting in the appearance of pure silver (in actuality silver only makes up 18% of the surface).Horz & Kallfass 1998, p. 12 Other silver artifacts are believed to have been made in roughly the same manner, but contain as much as 90% silver on the surface Horz & Kallfass 1998, p. 13 Examples of metalwork found in Sip\u00e1n include the above- mentioned head-shaped beads, peanut-shaped beads, coffin straps, fan handles, spearheads, a copper-plated banner, ceremonial knives, golden headdresses, silver and gold nose and ear ornaments, scepters, a gold necklace made of 10 spiderweb beads (spider bodies with human faces sitting on golden wires), a gilded copper animal (possibly fox or dog), among others.Gero 1995, pp. 354\u2013355 The vast majority of these works were placed in richly decorated tombs, indicating both their high value toward the Sip\u00e1n leadership and the frequent need for artisans to continue to make new artifacts as old ones were buried.Horz & Kallfass 1998, p. 9 ==Museums with artifacts from Sip\u00e1n== ===Museo Tumbas Reales de Sip\u00e1n=== Museo Tumbas Reales de Sip\u00e1n *The Museo Tumbas Reales de Sip\u00e1n, Royal Tombs of Sip\u00e1n Museum, is located in Lambayeque, Peru and was opened in 2002. This museum specifically focuses on the tomb of the Lord of Sip\u00e1n found in Sip\u00e1n in 1987.Museo Tumbas Reales de Sip\u00e1n Website *The museum's focus is based on the Lord of Sip\u00e1n as well as the 8 people sacrificed with him, the Old Lord of Sip\u00e1n and priest accompanying the Lord.Museo Tumbas Reales de Sip\u00e1n Website *The setup of the museum is specific to the way in which the archaeology was conducted with the museum starting on the third floor and moving into lover levels which correlate to the excavation of the tomb.Museo Tumbas Reales de Sip\u00e1n Website *The tomb replication is complete with the exact structures from the Lord of Sip\u00e1n tomb; as well as, full body adornment of precious metals, jewels, ceramics, wood carvings, and other grave goods.Museo Tumbas Reales de Sip\u00e1n Website *See External Links for more information on the Museo Tumbas Reales de Sip\u00e1n. ===Royal Tombs of Sip\u00e1n Exhibit by the Fowler Museum of Cultural History=== *The Royal Tombs of Sip\u00e1n was a traveling exhibit across the United States from 1993\u20131995.Gero 1995, p. 353 *The exhibit has rooms separated by their specific location. There are three main rooms that are for tomb 1 (Lord of Sip\u00e1n as well as the wealthiest tomb), tomb 2 (with very few artifacts), and tomb 3 (the oldest tomb).Gero 1995, pp. 354\u2013355 *The exhibit has a separate room that contains artifacts that have been recovered from looters. These artifacts are separate from the labeled tomb rooms, because it is not possible to know the exact tomb the artifact was originally taken from.Gero 1995, p. 354 *Artifacts on Display: **Tomb 1 was the richest tomb that included the possessions of the Lord of Sip\u00e1n. Some of the artifacts on display were: multiple earspools, very large peanut shaped beaded necklaces, 12 feather fans, intricate designs of animals in metalworking, and a mannequin that is wearing all of the Lord of Sip\u00e1n's burial regalia.Gero 1995, p. 355 **Tomb 2 is a much smaller display with only three cases of artifacts. These artifacts include: an owl headdress (created from copper and feathers), and a double stranded necklace where one strand was of human faces smiling and the other was of human faces grimacing.Gero 1995, p. 355 **Tomb 3 is the oldest tomb that was a pit burial. This burial was still very elaborate based on its artifacts that include gold jewelry that incorporated human faces and spider webs. Many of the artifacts were poorly preserved and were not on display in the exhibit, but were displayed in catalogs. The poorly preserved artifacts include: gilded animals that had movable body parts, wooden artifacts, and pieces of textiles.Gero 1995, p. 354 ===Reconstruction of Tomb=== A reconstruction of one of the tombs of Sip\u00e1n is on display the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.Hall of South American Peoples ==Nearby Moche locations== * Pampa Grande is located about 10 km to the east from Sip\u00e1n along the Chancay River valley. * Chiclayo is located about 29 km to the west of Sip\u00e1n. * Lambayeque is located about 40 km to the west-northwest of Sip\u00e1n. * Pacatnamu is located about 58 km to the south of Sip\u00e1n. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== *Museo Tumbas Reales de Sip\u00e1n (Original site in Spanish) * Museo Tumbas Reales de Sip\u00e1n (Translated into English) Category:Archaeological sites in Peru Category:Moche culture ",
