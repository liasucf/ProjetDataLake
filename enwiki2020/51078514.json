It is asserted that the Count of Provence, had the largest share in this play. Le Mariage secret having first been refused, the Count of Provence heard that and wrote the same day to the gentleman responsible for the management of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais that he wanted the play be received: it was then, \"on order\", making the studied and successfully performed.
