The entire municipality is part of the traditional region of Inner Carniola and is now included in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region.Brezovica municipal site It includes the hamlet of U\u010dne to the east on the slope of \u0160pilj Hill (525 m). ==Name== The name Preserje occurs multiple times in Slovenian toponymy; unlike other examples of the name (e.g., Preserje, Preserje pri Komnu, etc.), which are feminine plural nouns, this Preserje is a neuter singular. The origin of the name is uncertain. Possibilities are that it is derived from *Pr\u011b-syr\u044cje 'place before a damp area, place before a swamp', *Pr\u011bs\u011br\u044cje 'place before an area singed by heat', or *Pr\u011bster\u044cje 'place for drying flax'. ==History== Church-sponsored schooling on Sundays was held in Preserje from 1835 to 1854; after this, regular schooling was instituted. During the Second World War, in July 1942 Italian forces burned three houses in the village. ==Churches== There are two churches near the settlement. On a hill to the northwest of the settlement is a 17th-century church dedicated to Saint Joseph. The parish church, on the southern outskirts of the settlement next to the local cemetery, is dedicated to Saint Vitus and was built in 1711.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference numbers e\u0161d 2177 & 2179 File:Preserje Brezovica Slovenia - St Joseph Church.jpg|Saint Joseph's Church File:Preserje Slovenia church.JPG|Saint Vitus' Church from the east File:Preserje Slovenia church interior.JPG|Arch and chancel of Saint Vitus' Church ==Notable people== Notable people that were born or lived in Preserje include: *Jo\u017ee \u0160eligo (1911\u20131941), poet *Kazimir Zakraj\u0161ek (1878\u20131958), priest, poet, writer, playwright, and editor *Leon Zakraj\u0161ek (1887\u20131963), editor and journalistSlovenska dr\u017eava 1963 14(3) (1 March): 3. *\u017diva Vadnov (born 1982), Miss Slovenia 2004\"\u017diva Vadnov: \"\u017delim si le, da me bodo imeli \u010dim bolj radi\" Dnevnik. 14. september 2004 ==References== ==External links== * *Preserje on Geopedia Category:Populated places in the Municipality of Brezovica ",
