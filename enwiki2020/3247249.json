Turkish Aerospace / TUSAS produced 46 F-16s for the Egyptian Air Force between 1993 and 1995 under the agreement signed between the Governments of Turkey and the Arab Republic of Egypt.A contract to produce 46 Block 40 F-16C/D's for the Egyptian Air Force was placed with TUSAS Aerospace Industries (TAI) of Turkey. 34 of them will be F-16C's, 12 will be F-16D's. This was carried out under the auspices of the Peace Vector IV program, and marked the first sale of a foreign-built Fighting Falcon to a third-party nation in the history of the F-16 program. TAI is engaged in manufacturing aerostructures for fixed and rotary wing, military and commercial aircraft for worldwide customers. TAI is in various partnership arrangements with AgustaWestland, Airbus, Alenia Aermacchi, Boeing, IAI, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, MD Helicopters, Sikorsky and numerous other companies in aerospace sector. TAI manufactures Section 18 fuselage panels for Airbus 319/320/321 aircraft, wing tips and flight deck panels for Boeing 737 aircraft, rear doors and engine cowlings for Eurocopter EC135 helicopters, MD 902 fuselage for MD Helicopters, horizontal stabilizers, tail rotor pylons and tail booms for Sikorsky S-70A and MH-60 helicopters, horizontal stabilizers for Sikorsky S-76 helicopters and AB139 fuselages for Agusta. Furthermore, TAI manufactures nose landing gear doors for the Boeing 747, dorsal fin for 777 and parts/subassembly parts for 737/767/777. It also manufactures seven components of the Eurocopter AS 532 helicopter. TAI, which had a single program (the co-production of the F-16 Fighting Falcon) at its establishment phase, is working on over 50 military and commercial programs today. As a partner of the Airbus Defence and Space, TAI has been participating in the design and development activities of the Airbus A400M program with the leading European aerospace companies; namely Airbus (France, Germany, Spain and UK), EADS CASA (Spain) and FLABEL (Belgium) from the beginning of the project. TAI has accepted the production of A350XWB's winglets with the new cooperation. In May 2015, the Turkish regional jet project was launched, which consisted of the indigenous production of two regional aircraft in different sizes. The 32-seat TRJ-328 jet with a range up to was planned to enter service in 2019. It was a Fairchild Dornier 328JET- based, modernized aircraft with new cockpit and engines. The larger, 70-seat TRJ-628 jet would be ready in 2023. The project has since been cancelled. ==Products== ===Aircraft=== * TAI H\u00fcrku\u015f, two-seat, single engine, turboprop aircraft for training and ground attack * TAI H\u00fcrjet, proposed advanced jet trainer and light attack aircraft * TAI TFX, proposed twin-engine all-weather air superiority fighter ===Helicopters=== * TAI/AgustaWestland T-129 ATAK * TAI T-70, Turkish variants of Sikorsky S-70i * TAI T-625 ===Unmanned aerial vehicles=== * TAI Aksungur MALE ISTAR * TAI Anka-A (TIHA-A) (2013), MALE ISTAR UAV * TAI Anka-B (TIHA-B) (2013), MALE UCAV * TAI Bayku\u015f (2004), tactical surveillance drone * TAI G\u00f6zc\u00fc (2007), short-range tactical ISTAR drone * TAI Keklik (2001), target drone for tracking and non-firing exercise * TAI Mart\u0131 (2003), surveillance drone * TAI Pelikan (IHA-X2), tactical ISTAR drone * TAI \u015eim\u015fek, high-speed target drone * TAI Turna (2001), target drone for tracking and live firing TAI UAV-X1 (1982), surveillance drone ===Satellites=== * G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk-1, earth observation satellite * G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk-2 (launched 2012), earth observation satellite * G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk-3 satellite * T\u00fcrksat 6A, communications satellite TAI operates Turkish Satellite Assembly, Integration and Test Center. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Aerospace companies Category:Aircraft manufacturers of Turkey Category:Defence companies of Turkey Category:Government-owned companies of Turkey Category:Ministry of National Defense (Turkey) Category:Manufacturing companies based in Ankara Category:Space program of Turkey Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1984 Category:Science and technology in Turkey Category:Turkish brands Category:Unmanned aerial vehicle manufacturers Category:Turkish companies established in 1984 ",
