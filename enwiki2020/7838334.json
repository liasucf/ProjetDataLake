The Post Office Department approved the new post office, but as the village had no name Congressman Mann was to give it one. Before he did so, postal maps were made with the temporary designation \"Mann's Choice\" written on it. The name was never changed, and became the permanent and official one. ==Sources== *The Political Graveyard Category:1795 births Category:1873 deaths Category:County clerks in Pennsylvania Category:People from Fulton County, Pennsylvania Category:Pennsylvania Jacksonians Category:Pennsylvania Democrats Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania Category:Pennsylvania state senators Category:Members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Category:Pennsylvania lawyers Category:Jacksonian members of the United States House of Representatives Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives ",
