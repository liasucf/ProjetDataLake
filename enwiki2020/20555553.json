    "text": "The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Class E was a class of 2-8-0 steam locomotives in service between 1904 and 1928. ==History== No. 1886 with tender 26 were rebuilt by George Whale from Class B 4-cylinder compounds with the simple addition of a leading pony truck to reduce excessive front overhang between 1904-1908. The only alteration was to wheelbase and weight, but when the letter classification system was introduced in 1911, this took them into a different class. Two of Class Es were further rebuilt to Class Fs by the replacement of the 4'3\" diameter boiler with a larger 5'2\" diameter boiler; these being 1038 in 1907 and 647 in 1908. From 1917, Charles Bowen Cooke started to rebuild the remaining 24 Class Es into LNWR Class G1 0-8-0s with simple expansion engines. 12 had been so treated by the grouping of 1923, and a further pair were treated in January and February of that year. Of the remaining ten Class Es, the LMS allocated them the numbers 9600-9. A further four were rebuilt to Class G1 in 1923-4, while the remaining six engines were withdrawn still as Class Es in 1927/8, two of them never receiving their allocated LMS No. None was preserved. ==List of locomotives== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !LNWR no. !!Rebuilt from B !!LMS no. !!Fate !!Notes |- |1883 ||1904 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1918 || |- |1884 ||1904 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1917 || |- |1885 ||1905 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1917 || |- |1886 ||1904 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1923 || |- |1888 ||1904 ||(9600) ||Rebuilt to G1 1924 || |- |1889 ||1906 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1920 || |- |905 ||1905 ||9601 ||Withdrawn 1928 || |- |18 ||1905 ||(9602) ||Withdrawn 1928 || |- |2558 ||1906 ||9603 ||Withdrawn 1928 || |- |2563 ||1908 ||(9604) ||Rebuilt to G1 1924 || |- |1017 ||1906 ||(9605) ||Withdrawn 1927 || |- |1038 ||1905 || ||Rebuilt to F 1907 || |- |1042 ||1906 ||9606 ||Withdrawn 1928 || |- |1064 ||1906 ||(9607) ||Rebuilt to G1 1923 || |- |1065 ||1906 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1919 || |- |1222 ||1906 ||9608 ||Withdrawn 1928 || |- |1223 ||1906 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1921 || |- |1227 ||1908 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1921 || |- |1236 ||1906 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1921 || |- |2574 ||1906 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1920 || |- |1586 ||1906 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1921 || |- |647 ||1907 || ||Rebuilt to F 1908 || |- |1585 ||1906 ||(9609) ||Rebuilt to G1 1923 || |- |2056 ||1907 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1921 || |- |437 ||1906 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1922 || |- |2169 ||1906 || ||Rebuilt to G1 1923 || |} LMS numbers in parentheses were not carried prior to rebuilding as G1 or withdrawal. ==Notes== ==References== * == Further reading == * * * == External links == * LNWRS Webb page on the Class E (NB lifetime is incorrect as it includes G1 rebuilds) E Category:2-8-0 locomotives Category:Compound locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1904 Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain Category:1\u2032D n4v locomotives ",
