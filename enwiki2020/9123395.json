    "text": "Christian Escoud\u00e9 (born 1947) is a French Gypsy jazz guitarist. He grew up in Angoul\u00eame and is of Romani descent on his father's side. His father was also a guitarist who was influenced by Django Reinhardt. When Escoud\u00e9 was ten, his father began teaching him the guitar, and he became a professional musician at age fifteen. His style is a mix of bebop and gypsy jazz influences, featuring the use of vibrato, portamento, and fast runs. He started work in a trio with Aldo Romano in 1972. By the 1980s, he was in John Lewis's quartet. He also played with Philip Catherine for a time. In his forties, he signed with the French division of Verve Records. ==Career== ===1970s\u20131980s=== From 1969 to 1971, he was a member of the Aim\u00e9 Barelli band. In Paris, he joined the trio of Eddy Louiss Bernard Lubat, and Aldo Romano. Later, he joined Didier Levallet's Swing String System and the Michel Portal Unit. In 1976, l'Acad\u00e9mie du Jazz awarded him the Prix Django Reinhardt. He then formed a new quartet with Michel Graillier, Aldo Romano, and Alby Cullaz, the latter soon replaced by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Jenny-Clark. He also worked with Michel Portal or Slide Hampton, Martial Solal and Jean-Claude Fohrenbach. In 1978, he performed at the Festival de Nice with John Lewis, Bill Evans, Stan Getz, Freddie Hubbard, Philly Joe Jones, Lee Konitz, and Shelly Manne. The same year, he began a tradition of participating in the annual Festival de Samois, a tribute to Reinhardt. He performed in the Festival de Dakar in 1979 with the trio of Ren\u00e9 Urtreger, Pierre Michelot, and Daniel Humair. Escoud\u00e9 toured in a duo with guitarist John McLaughlin during 1980. The following year he joined the big band of Martial Solal and in 1982 performed in a quartet with Shelly Manne. In 1983, he played in duo again, this time with Didier Lockwood. Soon after, they added Philip Catherine. Escoud\u00e9 formed the Trio Gitan with Boulou Ferr\u00e9 and Babik Reinhardt, Django's son. Then he played in quartet in 1988 with Jean- Michel Pilc, Fran\u00e7ois Moutin and Louis Moutin. In 1989, he created an octet, half of them guitarists: Paul Challain Ferret, Jimmy Gourley, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sylvestre, and himself. The rest of the octet consisted of Marcel Azzola on accordion, Vincent Courtois on cello, Alby Cullaz on bass, and Billy Hart on drums. ===1990\u2013present=== In 1990, Escoud\u00e9 played at the Village Vanguard in New York City with Pierre Michelot, Hank Jones, and Kenny Washington. The following year he recorded an album of compositions by Django Reinhardt while supported by a string orchestra. In 1998 he recorded A Suite for Gypsies, a jazz fusion album. On the fiftieth anniversary of Reinhardt's death in 2003, he formed a big band of seventeen musicians. In 2004 Escoud\u00e9 organized the New Gypsy Trio with David Reinhardt (another relative of Django) and Martin Taylor (or Jean-Baptiste Laya). The next year, he released the album Ma Ya. He formed his Progressive Sextet with Marcel Azzola, Jean-Baptiste Laya, Stephane Guillaume, Jean-Marc Jafet, and Yoann Serra. In 2012, he released the album Christian Escoud\u00e9 joue Brassens: Au bois de mon c\u0153ur, a tribute to French poet and musician Georges Brassens. Escoud\u00e9 plays the compositions of Brassens with bassist Pierre Boussaguet and drummer Anne Paceo, with guests violinist Fiona Monbet, clarinetist Andre Villeger, Gypsy jazz guitarist Bir\u00e9li Lagr\u00e8ne and 11-year-old Gypsy guitarist Swan Berger. ==Discography== ===As leader=== * Reunion (Musica, 1976) * Christian Escoude & Alby Cullaz (Red, 1979) * Return (Red, 1979) * Gousti (All Life, 1980) * Gipsy's Morning (JMS, 1981) * Trio (JMS, 1983) * Christian Escoude Group Featuring Toots Thielemans (JMS, 1983) * Three of a Kind (JMS, 1985) * Gipsy Waltz (Mercury, 1989) * Plays Django Reinhardt (EmArcy/Gitanes, 1991) * Holidays (EmArcy/Gitanes, 1993) * In L.A.
