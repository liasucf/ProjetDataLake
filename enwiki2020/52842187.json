The publication contains the most significant contributions in fundamentals and applications fundamental research of combustion science combustion phenomena. Research papers and invited topical reviews are included on topics of reaction kinetics, soot, PAH and other large molecules, diagnostics, laminar flames, turbulent flames, heterogenous combustion, spray and droplet combustion, detonations, explosions & supersonic combustion, fire research, stationary combustion systems, internal combustion engine and gas turbine combustion, and new technology concepts. The editors-in-chief are Daniel C. Haworth (Pennsylvania State University) and Terese L\u00f8v\u00e5s (Norwegian University of Science and Technology). ==History== The need for development of automotive engines, fuels, and aviation formed the basis for the organization which became The Combustion Institute. The first three symposiums were held in 1928, 1937, and 1948. Since 1952, symposiums have been held every second year. The first combustion symposium with published proceedings was in 1948. == Abstracting and indexing == The journal is abstracted and indexed in: According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 4.120. ==See also== == References == == External links == * Category:Chemistry journals Category:Physics journals Category:Publications established in 1948 Category:Elsevier academic journals Category:Engineering journals Category:English-language journals Category:Combustion Category:Biennial journals ",
