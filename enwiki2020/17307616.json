Its name, literally old pear, refers to the boulders and rocks that are found in Moimenta da Beira. Its first inhabitants settled in the region during an obscure period of the Neolithic, coming from continental Europe. These were likely Celts, owing to the many prehistoric dolmens and shelters that were used as shelter. The tributaries of the Paiva and Varosa Rivers wind through the plateaus, providing irrigated fertile lands that could be used to support the early clans. While the Romans came to occupy the valleys and floodplains, the Lusitanians continued to occupy the high-grounds and defended their territory. Alman\u00e7or's Moorish forces eventually crossed the same territory after destroying the castle of Moimenta da Beira, around the 9th century. The Goths from Asturias eventually retook and repopulated the region, which was vaguely populated, reorganizing and forming an administrative territory (municipality) that included the villages of Peva, Ariz and Soutosa. Until 1834 it was a municipality and municipal seat, that included the parishes of P\u00eara Velha, Ariz and Peva. By 1801, P\u00eara Velha had a population of 1136 inhabitants across . ==Architecture== ===Prehistoric=== * Castro of P\u00eara Velha () * Dolmen of Lameiras (), which is a set of three Neolithic dolmens ===Religious=== * Chapel of Senhora da Livra\u00e7\u00e3o () * Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Fonte Santa () * Church of P\u00eara Velha (), an 18th-century church dedicated to the archangel Michael ==References== Category:Parishes of Moimenta da Beira Category:Former parishes of Portugal ",
