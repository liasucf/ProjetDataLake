The Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Published on the internet. Accessed: 2015-June-29. It was first described by the French botanists Jean Marie Bosser and Philippe Morat in 2001. The type specimen was collected in 1974 by Bosser and Morat from the woods near Ankazoabo, but it has also been found south of Sakaraha, near Mahaboboka, and near Morombe. The specific epithet peyrotii was given to this species in honor of Dr. Jean-Pierre Peyrot whose observations and collections have led to a better understanding of Malagasy orchids.Bosser, J., and P. Morat. 2001. Contribution \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude des Orchidaceae de Madagascar et des Mascareignes. XXXI. Esp\u00e8ces et combinaisons nouvelles dans les genres Oeceoclades, Eulophia et Eulophiella. Adansonia, 23(1): 7-22. ==Description== The conical pseudobulbs are about high by wide and heteroblastic (derived from a single internode). Each pseudobulb has a single ovate-pointed, leathery leaf with slightly wavy margins. The leaves are long by wide at the widest point and have long petioles that are hinged from the top of the pseudobulb. The leaves are dark green on the upper surface and purplish on the underside, sometimes with darker stripes. The erect inflorescences are tall, of which only the terminal is a simple or compound raceme where the flowers emerge. The flowers are small, about in diameter. Oeceoclades peyrotii is a terrestrial species found growing in deciduous forests of southwestern Madagascar, where it is known from only four locations. It is similar to other small-flowered species such as O. rauhii, O. analavelensis, and O. analamerensis but can be distinguished from those species by the differing characters of the labellum and spur and by the length of the petiole. ==References== peyrotii Category:Endemic flora of Madagascar Category:Plants described in 2001 ",
