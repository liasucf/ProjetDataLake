    "text": "Surrey Hills railway station is located on the Lilydale and Belgrave lines in Victoria, Australia. It serves the eastern Melbourne suburb of Surrey Hills opening on 13 August 1883.Surrey Hills Vicsig Two trains ran to Lilydale each day and five only to Box Hill. Engineers were initially unwilling to allow trains to stop at Surrey Hills claiming potential difficulties with the gradient, and also that there was not enough traffic to warrant the stop. In April 1883 a deputation asked for Surrey Hills to be a flag station so that passengers wishing to detrain could inform the guard of this at the previous station, while those wishing to join the train could show a red flag or a red lamp at night. By August 1883 trains would stop on request. On 1 September 1883 Surrey Hills station was brought into regular service. Surrey Hills station first appeared in the Victorian Railways Working Timetable on 15 October 1883. The double line came into use on 9 December 1888 when a second platform was provided on the north side of the line. By the 1930s a small goods yard was provided to the south of the station, in what is now a carpark. The connection to the mainline was at the Box Hill end of the station. The signal box and goods yard was removed in 1966 to allow track amplification works to be carried out. The present station building was provided, and the then citybound platform converted to an island platform. Services on the third track from East Camberwell extended though the station to Box Hill in December 1971. Surrey Hills was upgraded to a Premium station in June 2001. In 2016, two people were killed when a motor vehicle and an express down service X'Trapolis train collided at the Surrey Hills Level Crossing. Severe damage resulted to the train and the vehicle when the vehicle was dragged 150 meters before coming to a mangled rest between the station platform and train. The station underpass was also damaged. The investigation is ongoing. ==Platforms & services== Surrey Hills has one island platform (platforms 1 & 2) and a side platform (platform 3) linked by an underpass. The island platform features a large brick building which features a customer service window, an enclosed waiting room and toilets. Platform 3 features a small brick building.
