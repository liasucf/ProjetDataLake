    "text": "The rivalry between Am\u00e9rica Futebol Clube and Clube Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro is a footballing rivalry played between Brazilian clubs Am\u00e9rica Mineiro and Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro, from Belo Horizonte. The clubs first played against each other in 1913, and was for many decades considered the biggest encounter in Minas Gerais. With the fallback suffered by Am\u00e9rica due to initially refusing to become a professional club and the rise of Cruzeiro, it lost its status as the most important derby in the state, but the rivalry between Am\u00e9rica and Atl\u00e9tico continued. == History == Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro was founded in 1908 in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais; Am\u00e9rica emerged four years later. The first match between the two clubs happened on 13 November 1913, and finished 1\u20131. The two clubs, together with Yale, took part in the Ta\u00e7a Bueno Brand\u00e3o in 1914. It was the first competition organised in the state, and was won by Atl\u00e9tico. In 1915, Atl\u00e9tico also won the inaugural edition of the Campeonato Mineiro, the state league of Minas Gerais. The competition was then organised by the Liga Mineira de Sports Athl\u00e9ticos, which would later become the Federa\u00e7\u00e3o Mineira de Futebol. Despite Atl\u00e9tico's initial success, Am\u00e9rica was the dominant force in the first decades of the encounter. It won the following ten editions of the Campeonato Mineiro, and Atl\u00e9tico only won the state league again in 1926. The matches between the two clubs were known in their early days as the Cl\u00e1ssico das Multid\u00f5es (\"Derby of the Masses\") as they were the most popular clubs in the state. Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro was founded by liberal, upper-class students, but from an early age it opened its doors to players from every social class, nationality or ethnicity, which earned it a \"people's club\" status in Belo Horizonte and in the state. Am\u00e9rica, meanwhile, had a reputation as an elitist club. In the 1930s, Atl\u00e9tico pioneered professionalization of football in Minas Gerais, whereas Am\u00e9rica resisted against it. Am\u00e9rica suffered a setback as a result of its internal disagreements regarding professionalism. A controversial Campeonato Mineiro final happened in 1948, when Am\u00e9rica won 3\u20131 with what was known as the \"gol do guarda\" (\"guard goal\"). The match was disputed at Am\u00e9rica's Est\u00e1dio da Alamaeda, and Atl\u00e9tico could draw to be crowned champion. When Am\u00e9rica was winning 2\u20131, forward Murilinho kicked the ball, after which it bounced on a municipal officer and entered the goal. The goal was confirmed by English referee John Barrick, and Am\u00e9rica was champion of the competition. With Am\u00e9rica's setback in the 1930s and Cruzeiro's rise to prominence since the 1940s, the derby lost some importance in the state to the Cl\u00e1ssico Mineiro in this decade. The rivalry between Atl\u00e9tico and Cruzeiro eventually became the biggest derby in Minas Gerais in the 1960s, after the construction of the Mineir\u00e3o. ==Records== *Biggest wins: **For Am\u00e9rica: Am\u00e9rica 7\u20132 Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro, (15 May 1952 and 6 April 1979); **For Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro 6\u20131 Am\u00e9rica (11 September 1938). *Top goalscorers: **For Am\u00e9rica: Zuca, 13 goals; **For Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: Reinaldo, 19 goals. *Biggest unbeaten runs: **For Am\u00e9rica: 19 games (26 May 1918 to 8 October 1922); **For Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: 18 games (24 March 1966 to 28 February 1971). *Most consecutive wins: **For Am\u00e9rica: 8 wins (3 January 1960 to 13 November 1960); **For Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: 14 wins (26 November 1966 to 28 February 1971). ==References== Category:Am\u00e9rica Futebol Clube (MG) Category:Clube Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro Category:Brazilian football derbies ",
