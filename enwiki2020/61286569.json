    "text": "United States v Iran, played on 21 June 1998, was a football match between Iran and the United States in the group stage of the 1998 FIFA World Cup at the Stade de Gerland in Lyon, France. The match, which is described as the \"mother of all games\" and the \"most politically charged game in World Cup history\", ended with a 2\u20131 victory for Iran, the team's first ever victory in the history of the FIFA World Cup. Hamid Estili and Mehdi Mahdavikia scored for Iran, while Brian McBride scored for the US. == Background == Since the overthrow of the pro-Western Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, due to the Iranian revolution, and the attack on the American embassy in Iran, and the American support for Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war, relations between the two countries had been hostile. According to FIFA regulations team B should walk towards team A for the pre-match handshakes, and Iran were the team B, while the US were the team A; However, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic regime, Ali Khamenei, \"gave express orders that the Iranian team must not walk towards the Americans\". Mehrdad Masoudi, one of the FIFA media officer of the match, negotiated with the US team, and the due to that, the Americans walked towards the Iranians. During a delicately-choreographed pregame ceremony, the Iranian players gifted white roses to their American opponents, as a symbol of peace. == Match == === Summary === === Details === {| width=\"92%\" | | |} {| width=\"100%\" | valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" | {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" ! width=\"25\" | ! width=\"25\" | |- |GK |18 |Kasey Keller |- |DF |2 |Frankie Hejduk |- |DF |3 |Eddie Pope |- |DF |5 |Thomas Dooley (c) | | |- |DF |6 |David Regis | |- |MF |10 |Tab Ramos | | |- |MF |13 |Cobi Jones |- |MF |21 |Claudio Reyna |- |FW |7 |Roy Wegerle | | |- |FW |9 |Joe-Max Moore |- |FW |20 |Brian McBride |- | colspan=\"3\" |Substitutions: |- |MF |8 |Earnie Stewart | | |- |MF |14 |Preki | | |- |MF |19 |Brian Maisonneuve | | |- | colspan=\"3\" |Manager: |- | colspan=\"4\" |Steve Sampson |} | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" | {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" ! width=\"25\" | ! width=\"25\" | |- |GK |1 |Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh (c) |- |DF |4 |Mohammad Khakpour |- |DF |14 |Nader Mohammadkhani | | |- |DF |17 |Javad Zarincheh | | |- |DF |20 |Mehdi Pashazadeh |- |MF |2 |Mehdi Mahdavikia |- |MF |6 |Karim Bagheri |- |MF |9 |Hamid Estili |- |MF |21 |Mehrdad Minavand | |- |FW |10 |Ali Daei |- |FW |11 |Khodadad Azizi | | |- | colspan=\"3\" |Substitutions: |- |MF |7 |Ali Reza Mansourian | | |- |DF |5 |Afshin Peyravani | | |- |DF |3 |Naim Sadavi | | |- | colspan=\"3\" |Manager: |- | colspan=\"4\" |Jalal Talebi |} |} {| style=\"font- size: 90%\" width=\"100%\" |Assistant referees: Laurent Rausisi (Switzerland) Nicolae Grigorescu (Romania) Fourth official: Lucien Bouchardeau (Niger) |} == Aftermath == According to Mehrdad Masoudi, after the historical victory of Iran in this game, \"people were dancing in the streets of Tehran.\" Jeff Agoos, a former US defender, said that \"We did more in 90 minutes than the politicians did in 20 years.\" 18 months later, the teams played a friendly match at Pasadena.
