    "text": "\"He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot\" is a song by American indie rock band Grandaddy, released as the second single from their second studio album The Sophtware Slump (2000). ==Writing and composition== Regarding the song's conception and its position as The Sophtware Slump's opening track, Jason Lytle noted: \"It was definitely a struggle to get all the three parts to actually sound like they were intended to live together. I usually get into this space where, once the album starts to come together, I start to figure out what's missing or what needs to be added, and I realised that it really needed something like that to set it off in a certain direction. It's just a struggle putting something like that together and making it not sound forced, y\u2019know?\" == Release == \"He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot.\" was released as the second single from The Sophtware Slump. It reached number 82 in the UK Singles Chart. == Touring == Grandaddy toured with Elliott Smith in 2000 and he would occasionally join them onstage and sing lead vocals on parts of this song. == Legacy == The song was featured on the soundtrack of UK hidden camera show Trigger Happy TV and the films Jackpot (2001), The Forest for the Trees (2003), and Occupation: Dreamland (2005). Actor Jason Lee has cited this song as the inspiration to name his child Pilot Inspektor. ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2000 singles Category:Grandaddy songs Category:2000 songs ",
