Guomao () is an area in Beijing at the center of the Beijing central business district, demarcated by the intersection of Jianguomen Outer Street and the Third Ring Road. The Chinese World Trade Center is located there. It was formerly known as Dabeiyao (), and bus stops in the vicinity still bear this name. Guomao is also the name of the interchange station on Line 1 and Line 10. ==History== During the Ming Dynasty, the area was pastureland outside the city walls, and served as a hunting ground for the imperial family.(Chinese video) \"CBD\u516c\u4ea4\u7ad9\u6cbf\u7528\u8001\u5730\u540d \u5927\u5317\u7a91\u66fe\u662f\u65e5\u519b\u70e7\u7816\u5904\" 2013-09-11 During World War II, the occupying Japanese Army built a complex of kilns in the area, the largest of which in the north became a landmark. The area was then called Dabeiyao (), literally the \"Great Northern Kiln\". In 1985, the China World Trade Center was built at the intersection of the 3rd Ring Road and Jianguomen Outer Street and the Beijing CBD was established in 1993. The Dabeiyao Overpass was consequently renamed the Guomao Bridge - \"Guomao\" is the abbreviation for the Chinese name of the World Trade Center().
