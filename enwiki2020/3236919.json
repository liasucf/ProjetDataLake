    "text": "An electorate or electoral district (), or informally, a seat, is a geographical constituency used for electing members to the New Zealand Parliament. The size of electorates is determined such that all electorates have approximately the same population. Before 1996, all members of Parliament were directly chosen for office by the voters of an electorate. Starting from 2014 under the MMP electoral system, 71 of the usually 120 seats in Parliament are filled by electorate members, with the remainder being filled from party lists in order to achieve proportional representation among parties (there were 69 electorates in 2005, and 70 electorates in the 2008 and 2011 elections). The 71 electorates are made up from 64 general and seven M\u0101ori electorates. ==Distribution== the Representation Commission determines electorate boundaries. The Commission consists of: * Four government officials\u2014the Government Statistician, the Surveyor-General, the Chief Electoral Officer, and the Chairperson of the Local Government Commission. * A representative of the governing party or coalition, and a representative of the opposition bloc. * A chairperson (often a judge) nominated by the other members (with the exception of Chairperson of the Local Government Commission). The Representation Commission reviews electorate boundaries after each New Zealand census, which normally occurs every five years. The South Island is guaranteed to have 16 general seats, and dividing the number of persons in the South Island's general electoral population by 16 determines the South Island Quota which is then used to help calculate the number of M\u0101ori electorates and to determine the number of North Island electorates. The number of M\u0101ori electorates is influenced by the M\u0101ori Electoral Option where M\u0101ori voters can opt to be in either a M\u0101ori electorate or a general electorate. The percentage of M\u0101ori voters opting for the M\u0101ori roll determines the percentage of the whole M\u0101ori population (of persons claiming M\u0101ori ancestry at the previous census) which is then divided by the South Island Quota to calculate the number of M\u0101ori seats. South Island M\u0101ori opting for the general roll are included in the population on which the South Island Quota is established. The North Island population (including M\u0101ori opting for the general roll) is divided into electorates, each of approximately the same population as the South Island ones. Electorates may vary by no more than 5% of the average population size. This has caused the number of list seats in Parliament to decline as the population is experiencing \"northern drift\" (i.e. the population of the North Island, especially around Auckland, is growing faster than that of the South Island) due both to internal migration and to immigration. Although the New Zealand Parliament is intended to have 120 members, recent iterations have exceeded this quantity. Due to some parties winning more electorate seats than their proportion of the party vote suggests, overhang seats have been awarded. In 2005 and 2011, 121 members were elected; 122 members were elected in 2008. === History === Originally, electorates were drawn up based on political and social links, with little consideration for differences in population. Elections for the New Zealand House of Representatives in the 1850s modelled the electoral procedures used for the British House of Commons, which at that time featured both single- member electorates (electorates returning just one MP) and multi-member electorates (electorates returning more than one MP). Each electorate was allocated a different number of MPs (up to three) in order to balance population differences. All electorates used a plurality voting system. From 1881, a special country quota meant that rural seats could contain fewer people than urban seats, preserving improportionality by over-representing farmers. For the 1905 election the multi-member electorates were abolished. The quota system persisted until 1945. Because of the increasing North Island population, the Representation Commission awarded the North Island an additional electoral seat beginning in the 2008 general election. Another new North Island seat was added for the 2014 general election. Each time, the need for an extra seat was determined from the results of the most recent New Zealand census, with the seat coming out of the total number of list seats. The total number of list seats has thus declined from 55 to 49 since the introduction of Mixed Member Proportional voting in 1996. ==Naming== The Representation Commission determines the names of each electorate following the most recent census. An electorate may be named after a geographic region, landmark (e.g. a mountain) or main population centre. The Commission adopts compass point names when there is not a more suitable name. The compass point reference usually follows the name of the main population centre, e.g. Hamilton East. ==Special electorates== Over the years, there have been two types of \"special\" electorates created for particular communities. The first were special goldminers' electorates, created for participants in the Otago Goldrush\u2014goldminers did not usually meet the residency and property requirements in the electorate they were prospecting in, but were numerous enough to warrant political representation. Two goldminers' electorates existed, the first began in 1863 and both ended in 1870. === M\u0101ori electorates === Much more durable have been the M\u0101ori electorates, created in 1867 to give separate representation to M\u0101ori citizens. Although originally intended to be temporary, they came to function as reserved positions for M\u0101ori until 1967, ensuring that there would always be a M\u0101ori voice in Parliament. In 1967 the reserved status of the Maori seats was removed, allowing non-Maori to stand in the Maori electorates, thus removing any guarantee that Maori would be elected to Parliament. Until 1993 the number of M\u0101ori electorates was fixed at four, significantly under-representing M\u0101ori in Parliament. In 1975 the definition of who could opt to register on either the general or the m\u0101ori roll was expanded to include all persons of M\u0101ori descent. Previously all persons of more than 50% M\u0101ori ancestry were on the M\u0101ori roll while persons of less than 50% M\u0101ori ancestry were required to enrol on the then European roll. Only persons presumed to have equal M\u0101ori and European ancestry (so-called half- castes) had a choice of roll. Since the introduction of MMP, the number of seats can change with the number of M\u0101ori voters who choose to go on the M\u0101ori roll rather than the general roll. ==Electorates in the 52nd Parliament== New Zealand electorates used since 2017, showing 2017 election results This table shows the electorates as they were represented during the 52nd New Zealand Parliament. In the 2020 general election districts reflect the changes of the Representation Commission\u2019s 2020 boundary review. As well as new boundaries for many districts, the names of ten electorates have been changed, and one new electorate (Takanini) has been created. ===General electorates=== {| style=\"font-size: 95%;\" class=\"sortable wikitable\" !
