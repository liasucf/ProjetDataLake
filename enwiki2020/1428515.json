    "text": "Fine wood rasp Farrier using a two-sided file, double-cut on the visible side and rasp cut against a horse's hoof A rasp is coarse form of file used for coarsely shaping wood or other material. Typically a hand tool, it consists of a generally tapered rectangular, round, or half-round sectioned bar of case hardened steel with distinct, individually cut teeth. A narrow, pointed tang is common at one end, to which a handle may be fitted. ==Use== Rasps come in a variety of shapes\u2014rectangular, round, and half-round\u2014and vary in coarseness from finest, \"cabinet\", to most aggressive, \"wood\". Farriers, for example, commonly use rasps to remove excess wall from a horse's hoof. They are also used in woodworking for rapidly removing material, and are easier to control than a drawknife. The rough surfaces they leave may be smoothed with finer tools, such as single- or double-cut files. Rasps are used in shaping alabaster. Saws and chisels are used to rough out alabaster work. ==See also== *Surform ==References== Category:Woodworking hand tools Category:Files (hand tool) Category:Alabaster ",
