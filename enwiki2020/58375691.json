    "text": "The Johnson Road Covered Bridge is a covered bridge located near Petersburg, Jackson County, Ohio, United States. It was built around 1870 by Robert W. Smith, using his 1969 patent for the Smith truss design. While most all of the covered bridges built in Jackson County in the 19th century used this design, this one is the only known example still standing in the state, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Covered bridges in Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Jackson County, Ohio Category:Bridges completed in 1870 Category:1870 establishments in Ohio ",
