The first two discs of Live in Vienna cover the entire first and second sets of the concert. The third disc on the original Japanese release was a bonus disc featuring live tracks from King Crimson's 2015 tour of Japan. On the main release, the third disc comprises one of the band's first performances of \"Fracture\" since 1974, two encores from the show in Vienna, and newly sequenced pieces with excerpts from Robert Fripp's soundscapes edited into them. ==Critical reception== Writing for All About Jazz, John Kelman praised the album, especially the third disc's version of \"Fracture\" and its live improvisations, which he called \"a primary reason to consider Live in Vienna an essential listen.\" ==Track listing== Notes * \"Fracture\" was performed at Falconer Salen in Copenhagen, Denmark on 23 September 2016. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from liner notes.
