Its main worship center is located at the CCF Center in Ortigas East (formerly Frontera Verde), Pasig. ==History== Dr. Peter Tan-Chi, founder and senior pastor of CCF. In 1982, Pastor Peter Tan-Chi began an evangelistic home Bible study in Brookside Subdivision, Cainta, Rizal. Only three couples attended that first Bible study, but as they began to invite their friends, who then invited their own friends and families, the Bible study grew and moved to San Juan City. Two years later, a core group of 40 people (businessmen, professionals, and their families) emerged from these Bible studies. Later on, they met at the Asian Institute of Management for their first Sunday worship service and launched \"Christ\u2019s Commission Foundation\" in August 1984.Roderick T. dela Cruz, How a young architect designed the country\u2019s largest worship center, manilastandard.net, Philippines, March 23, 2014 Sun star, Praise and worship for the King of all Kings, sunstar.com.ph, Philippines, December 3, 2017 Since then, CCF\u2019s continuous growth has caused its worship services to move from place to place. From AIM, services moved to Greenbelt in Makati City, then to the Conference Room of the Philippine International Convention Center, and then to the PICC Plenary Hall. Worshippers then split in order to attend at a venue in CCF Sucat, and one at the Valle Verde Country Club. In 1997, CCF's worship services transferred to St. Francis Square in Ortigas Center. On 12 May 2013, CCF held its first Sunday worship service at the new CCF Center in Frontera Verde in Pasig, with a 10,000 seating capacity. In 2016, the church was chosen by the Dangerous Drugs Board (a government agency in the Philippines) to offer a spiritual rehabilitation program for drug addicts. Jodee A. Agoncillo, Miracle coming?
