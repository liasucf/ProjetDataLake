    "text": "The Baumberge are the highest hills in the natural regions of M\u00fcnsterland and Kernm\u00fcnsterland with a maximum height of .In the historic M\u00fcnsterland the Westerbecker Berg at in Tecklenburger Land and in the natural region of the Teutoburg Forest was the highest elevation. They are located between M\u00fcnster and Coesfeld, which is itself close to the southwest edge of the Baumberge. The hilly terrain has several geological, hydrographic and architectural features. == Natural regions == The Baumberge and their immediate foothills are subdivided into natural regions as follows:Geographische Landesaufnahme: The natural region units on Sheet 83/84 - Osnabr\u00fcck/Bentheim (Sofie Meisel 1961; centre of sheet), Sheet 95/96 - Kleve/Wesel (Wilhelm von K\u00fcrten 1977; east) and Sheet 97 - M\u00fcnster (Sofie Meisel 1960; west) - Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Landeskunde, Bad Godesberg \u2192 maps * (to 54 Westphalian Basin) ** (to 541 Kernm\u00fcnsterland) *** (to 541.0 Burgsteinfurt Land) **** 541.00 Osterwick Hills (Osterwicker H\u00fcgelland) - 128 m; gently rolling, NW foothills, separated from the Schr\u00f6ppingen Ridge by the Vechte river **** 541.02 Sch\u00f6ppingen Ridge (Sch\u00f6ppinger R\u00fccken) - 158 m; N foothills of the Baumberge **** 541.03 Baumberge - 188 m **** 541.05 Altenberge Ridge (Altenberger R\u00fccken) - 117 m; NE gently rolling ridge, parallel to the Baumberge and Sch\u00f6ppingen Ridge, separated by the stream of the Steinfurter Aa **** 541.07 Coesfeld-Darup Heights (Coesfeld-Daruper H\u00f6hen) - 166 m; SW foothills of the Baumberge == Location == The Baumberge lie within the M\u00fcnsterland district of Coesfeld running in a northwest to southeast direction between Billerbeck in the west, the Rosendahl villages of Darfeld in the northwest, Havixbeck in the east, Nottuln-Schapdetten in the southeast and Nottuln in the south, Schapdetten being situated on the southeastern slopes of the hills themselves. On the other side of the Nottuln\u2013Billerbeck state road (Landesstra\u00dfe) the hills are separated by a saddle from the Coesfeld-Darup Heights which are up to 166 m high, the southwest foothills of the southern slopes. To the north the Baumberge transition into the Sch\u00f6ppingen Ridge, which after depression of only a little over 100 m reach a height of 158 m at the Sch\u00f6ppinger Berg. The A 43 motorway runs past the Baumberge just 2 km to the south (south of Schapdetten) and the A 1 passes 8 km to the east. The northern part of the range is separated by the Baumberge Railway. == Landscape == The Baumberge rise over the otherwise flat landscape to around 100 m reaching their highest point in the Westerberg ; whose summit is crowned by the Longinus Tower. Typical of this landscape a relatively level and treeless plateau with steep wooded edges of uniform height. The plateau is sparsely populated due to its aridity. The highest elevations around the Baumberge are the Sch\u00f6ppinger Berg near Sch\u00f6ppingen at 157.6 m, Bentheim Ridge (Bentheimer Hohenr\u00fccken) near Bad Bentheim at 91.9 m the Gildehaus Ridge (Gildeh\u00e4user H\u00f6henr\u00fccken) west of it near Gildehaus at around 80 m, the Altenberge Ridge (Altenberger H\u00f6henr\u00fccken) at 113.0 m and the Buchenberg near Burgsteinfurt at 110 m. == Karst hills == A watermill made of Baumberge Sandstone The substratum of the Baumberge consists of a calcareous sandstone that is very porous. As a result, rainwater on the plateau soaks away to a great depth. The farms here have, for centuries, had to bore wells 40 m to 50 m deep to collect drinking water \u2013 frequently, however, they had to use rainwater cisterns until, in the early 1970s, a drinking water main was laid to them. The rainwater that drains away reappears at the edges of the Baumberge in spring horizons again; sometimes even entire streams can appear at the surface after just a few metres. Several other features of a karst hill range like ponors and sinkholes are also found in the Baumberge. == References == == External links == * Baumberge tourism * Natural region map from the individual 1:200,000 sheets by the Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Landeskunde - the Baumberge are \"541.03\" on **Sheet 83/84 - Osnabr\u00fcck/Bentheim (centre of sheet) **Sheet 95/96 - Kleve/Wesel (east) **Sheet 97 - M\u00fcnster (west) Category:Hill ranges of Germany Category:Landforms of North Rhine-Westphalia Category:M\u00fcnster (region) Category:Westphalian Lowland ",
