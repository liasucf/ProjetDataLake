A funny script, familiar situations, and good actors in all of the roles made the film a great success. The film also had a sequel in 1964 called Operasjon Sj\u00f8spr\u00f8yt (Operation Sea Spray). The film was released on DVD on February 11, 2004. ==Plot== A number of very different men are called in for three weeks of training exercise at the Haglemoen military base, one just as odd as the next. They include the jolly salesman Goggen Rask (Rolf Just Nilsen), the car repairman Bottolph Johansen (Arve Opsahl), who is nicknamed Dreamer, and the shipowner Rieber-Larsen Jr. (Odd Borg). An unruly gang with characters like Major Kampstrup (Tore Foss) has a hard time keeping order\u2014and keeping them\u2014in the camp as they get sick and are taken care of by nurses Bitten (Anita Thallaug) and Florence (S\u00f8lvi Wang). The men do their best and make it through the big field maneuver after countless complications and comic situations. ==Songs== *\"Brother Bill\" (by Tony Hatch and Per Gunnar Jensen), performed by Ray Adams ==References== ==External links== * * Operasjon L\u00f8vsprett at the National Library of Norway Category:1962 films Category:Norwegian comedy films Category:Norwegian films Category:Films directed by Knut Andersen Category:Norwegian-language films Category:1962 comedy films ",
