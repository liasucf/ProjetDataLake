    "text": "The Muse\u00e9 alsacien (Alsatian museum) is one of the three museums of Haguenau, France. Like its older and much larger counterpart in Strasbourg, it is dedicated to local, mostly rural customs, furniture, and folk art. The museum was established in 1972 when the ethnographic collection of the Mus\u00e9e historique de Haguenau was separated from the rest of the collections in order to reorganise the existing space. It was moved into the former chancery (), a late 15th-century building. ==Gallery== Haguenau Mus\u00e9eAlsacien 2.JPG|Upper part of the fa\u00e7ade Haguenau Mus\u00e9eAlsacien 13.JPG|Detail of the fa\u00e7ade Haguenau Mus\u00e9eAlsacien 14.JPG|Astronomical clock on the fa\u00e7ade Enfant J\u00e9sus-Cire habill\u00e9e-Mus\u00e9e alsacien de Haguenau.jpg|Wax statuette of Infant Jesus (19th century) Mus\u00e9e alsacien de Haguenau-Souhaits de bapt\u00eame 2.jpg|Baptism wishes (1812) Poterie de Soufflenheim-Mus\u00e9e alsacien de Haguenau.jpg|Pottery from Soufflenheim Plaque-Armoiries des comtes de Hanau-Lichtenberg.jpg|Fireplace fireback (1684) with coat of arms of the Counts of Hanau-Lichtenberg Peinture sous verre-Saint Martin-Mus\u00e9e alsacien de Haguenau.jpg|Reverse glass painting (18th century) of St Martin and the beggar Moule \u00e0 Springerle-Mus\u00e9e alsacien de Haguenau.jpg|Mould for Springerle cookies Mus\u00e9e alsacien de Haguenau-Bonnet 1.jpg|Embroidered cap (early 19th century) == References == == External links == *Website of the Mus\u00e9e alsacien Museum Category:Museums in Bas-Rhin Category:Ethnographic museums in France Category:Museums established in 1972 Category:1972 establishments in France ",
