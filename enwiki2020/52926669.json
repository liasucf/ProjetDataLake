Despite giving consent as a child, she felt unaware of the lifelong implications. Hart describes how stigma \"sets the scene\" for such interventions, \"There\u2019s a fear that people will be maladjusted because their bodies are different, and that fear teamed with the ignorance of the realities of what it\u2019s like to live as an adult with those bodies without surgery, kind of perpetuates a surgical intervention process\". Growing up, Hart did not know that her sister, Phoebe Hart, also had androgen insensitivity syndrome. == Career == Hart is a \"high-energy avant-garde performer\" and multidisciplinary artist, assembling digital and analog filmmaking, music, and visual art. She is a cofounder of Venting Gallery and the Foundation for Contemporary Music and Culture http://fcmc.org.au/ in Brisbane, Queensland, and performs with bands including X-wave and the Unaustralians.
