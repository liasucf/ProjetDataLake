The company was founded in 2013 and produces weatherproof materials using the fungi \"Ganoderma lucidum\" and \"Pleurotus ostreatus\".Advanced Materials From Fungal Mycelium: Fabrication and Tuning of Physical Properties They use the production method (which is similar to casting) to make furniture, bricks, footwear, and leather. == Launch == The company began when Chief Technical Officer Phil Ross began an art project by adding chemicals to different fungal growth stages. == Technology == MycoWorks produces its products through a process which involves steam cooking bags of sawdust (or cornhusks) for several hours in airtight bags (to sterilise the growing medium), after which the sawdust or cornhusks are moved into a mold (which has the shape of the final product, ie furniture, ...). In the mold, mushroom tissue (mycelium) is introduced which feeds on the growing medium. The mycelium then grows (into the shape of the mold). Lastly the fungi is killed by putting the whole into an oven, hence stopping additional growth.Making Furniture from FungiMycotecture (Phil Ross) According to co- founder Phil Ross, production of this material is similar to making ravioli from scratch, and the final product is more resilient than cement. Another product made by the company is a leather-like textile. Unlike traditional animal hide leather, the product is made from a mix of fungus and wood fibers. It can be made in any size. The leather product can be made in sheets up to 27 square feet. == See also == * Ecovative Design == References == == External links == * Category:Companies based in San Francisco Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Biotechnology in the United States Category:2013 establishments in California Category:Fungi in cultivation ",
