It is part of the Grandtully and Strathtay Conservation Area. Neighbouring Grandtully is situated on the other side of the Tay, across Grandtully Bridge. Strathtay is a particularly attractive village in Highland Perthshire, very much shaped by the Scottish feu system, which has led to a prevalence of Victorian architecture and landscaping. The village has many stone houses with large, mature gardens containing oak, beech, and monkey-puzzle trees and rhododendrons. J. M. Barrie is known to have spent summer holidays at Beechwood in Strathtay.
