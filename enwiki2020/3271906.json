    "text": "In philosophy and psychology, ressentiment () is one of the forms of resentment or hostility. The concept was of particular interest to some 19th century thinkers, most notably Friedrich Nietzsche. According to their use, ressentiment is a sense of hostility directed toward an object that one identifies as the cause of one's frustration, that is, an assignment of blame for one's frustration.TenHouten W., From Ressentiment to Resentment as a Tertiary Emotion, Rev. Eur. Stud. 10 (2018) p.49-64 The sense of weakness or inferiority complex and perhaps even jealousy in the face of the \"cause\" generates a rejecting/justifying value system, or morality, which attacks or denies the perceived source of one's frustration. This value system is then used as a means of justifying one's own weaknesses by identifying the source of envy as objectively inferior, serving as a defense mechanism that prevents the resentful individual from addressing and overcoming their insecurities and flaws. The ego creates an enemy in order to insulate itself from culpability. == History == Ressentiment as a concept gained popularity with Friedrich Nietzsche's writings. Walter Kaufmann ascribes his use of the term in part to the absence of a proper equivalent term in the German language, contending that this absence alone \"would be sufficient excuse for Nietzsche\", if not for a translator.Kaufmann, Walter. \"Editor's Introduction, Section 3\" On the Genealogy of Morals in Nietzsche: Basic Writings; Walter Kaufmann, tr. New York: The Modern Library, 1967. The term came to form a key part of his ideas concerning the psychology of the 'master\u2013slave' question (articulated in Beyond Good and Evil), and the resultant birth of morality. Nietzsche's chief development of ressentiment came in his book On The Genealogy of Morals; see esp \u00a7\u00a7 10-11). Earlier it has been used by S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard.Poole, Roger. Kierkegaard, University of Virginia Press, 1993, pp. 226\u2013228.Stivers, Richard. Shades of loneliness, Rowman & Little Field o, 2004, pp. 14\u201316.Davenport, John, et al. Kierkegaard after MacIntyre, Open Court , 2001, p. 165. notably in his Two Ages: A Literary Review.Ressentiment was translated as envy in Hong's translation of Kierkegaard, see pages 81-87 The term was also studied by Max Scheler in a monograph published in 1912 and reworked a few years later.Scheler M., Das Ressentiment im Aufbau der Moralen, 1915 (\u00dcber Ressentiment und moralisches Werturteil, 1912), engl. transl. Ressentiment, Marquette University press, 1994 Currently of great import as a term widely used in psychology and existentialism, ressentiment is viewed as an influential force for the creation of identities, moral frameworks and value systems. However there is debate as to what validity these resultant value systems have, and to what extent they are maladaptive and destructive. == Perspectives == === Kierkegaard and Nietzsche === > \"It is a fundamental truth of human nature that man is incapable of > remaining permanently on the heights, of continuing to admire anything. > Human nature needs variety.

The ego creates the illusion of an enemy, a cause that can be \"blamed\" for one's own inferiority/failure. Thus, one was thwarted not by a failure in oneself, but rather by an external \"evil.\" According to Kierkegaard, ressentiment occurs in a \"reflective, passionless age\", in which the populace stifles creativity and passion in passionate individuals. Kierkegaard argues that individuals who do not conform to the masses are made scapegoats and objects of ridicule by the masses, in order to maintain status quo and to instill into the masses their own sense of superiority. Ressentiment comes from reactiveness: the weaker someone is, the less their capability to suppress reaction.See e.g. The Will to Power, 78. According to Nietzsche, the more a person is active, strong- willed, and dynamic, the less place and time is left for contemplating all that is done to them, and their reactions (like imagining they are actually better) become less compulsive. The reaction of a strong-willed person (a \"wild beast\"On the Genealogy of Morality, 11), when it happens, is ideally a short action: it is not a prolonged filling of their intellect.On the Genealogy of Morality, 10, last paragraph Another aspect according to a discussion by Stephen Mulhall, Keith Ansell-Pearson and Fiona Hughes is that after the weaker (slave) side has won out over the stronger, there is in ressentiment a general sense of disappointment that the rewards of victory are much less than was expected by the slaves. The former long-time past resentment at being a slave is perhaps increased by an inadequate outcome, leading to ressentiment.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b087rt4z \"Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality\" on In Our Time (BBC 2017) ===Max Scheler === See Ressentiment in Scheler's works Max Scheler attempted to place Nietzsche's ideas in a more sociologically articulated context. He started by considering how values are established within society and next proceeded to analyze their sharing or rejection on various grounds.Scheler M., Ressentiment, Marquette University press, 1994 ===Weber=== Max Weber in The Sociology of Religion relates ressentiment to Judaism, an ethical salvation religion of a \"pariah people.\" Weber defines ressentiment as \"a concomitant of that particular religious ethic of the disprivileged which, in the sense expounded by Nietzsche and in direct inversion of the ancient belief, teaches that the unequal distribution of mundane goods is caused by the sinfulness and the illegality of the privileged, and that sooner or later God's wrath will overtake them.\" ===Deleuze=== Gilles Deleuze significantly develops the concept of ressentiment as discussed by Nietzsche in his work Nietzsche and Philosophy. === Girard === Ren\u00e9 Girard differs from Nietzsche by assessing the ressentiment is a left-over of not pursuing the mimetic rival or the scapegoat. It is the price paid for turning the other cheek. Atonement could be achieved only by moving beyond rivalry and ressentiment. == See also == *Psychological projection *Peter Sloterdijk *Helmut Schoeck ==References== ==Further reading== *Aeshbach S., Ressentiment: an anatomy.
