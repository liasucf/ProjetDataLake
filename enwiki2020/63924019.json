The company has a broad pipeline of next generation immunotherapy product candidates for the treatment of advanced blood cancers and solid tumours in pre-clinical and clinical development. The company was founded in 2011 by the two university professors Gerhard Ehninger and Michael Bachmann.Get to know GEMoaB, Company Website, Retrieved: May 11, 2020 == Company background == To overcome the limitations of current cellular immunotherapies, GEMoaB has established two cellular immunotherapy platforms, which are called UniCAR & RevCAR. These genetically modified T-cells can be rapidly and repeatedly turned on and off via dosing of so-called Targeting Modules (TMs), which crosslink UniCAR/RevCAR T-effector cells with malignant target cells. Upon cross-linkage, UniCAR/RevCAR T-cells are activated and expanded and eliminate malignant target cells. They can be rapidly turned off after TM withdrawal, promising to avoid T-effector cell exhaustion and to reduce potential side effects typically associated with CAR-T therapies.M. Cartellieri, A.
