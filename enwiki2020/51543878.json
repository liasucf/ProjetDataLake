Beard, Craftsmen and Interior Decoration in England, 1660\u20131820 (Holmes and Meier, New York 1981), p. 273. He collaborated in the furnishing of the churches of the City of London rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren after the Great Fire of London. A number of his works survive including some of his preparatory drawings. It has been emphasised that, despite the persistent idea that Grinling Gibbons was responsible for much of the carving in the rebuilt City churches, in the building accounts and parish minute-books Gibbons's name appears only once, in connection with the exceptional altarpiece at St Mary Abchurch,J. Summerson, Architecture in Britain, 1530\u20131830 (Yale University Press 1993), Vol. 3, pp. 201-02. a church which also contains carvings by William Newman and William Emmett.N. Pevsner, The Buildings of England. I \u2013 The Cities of London and Westminster (Harmondsworth 1962), p. 155. Font-cover at St Stephen Walbrook. == The Weavers' Company Hall == Accounts for the furnishing of the Weavers' Company Hall (which was rebuilt after the Fire by 1669) show that in 1671 and 1672 Newman was paid for carvings in the Parlour, and for various images on the Hall Stairs. These included heads of leopards and wyverns, probably derived from the Company's heraldry.A. Plummer, The London Weavers' Company 1600\u20131970 (Routledge 2013), p. 211 and note 52, citing Company MS 4649A. == St Stephen, Coleman Street == In 1676\u201377 Newman was employed for making the altar-table and rails, and the altar-piece, for Wren's rebuilding of St Stephen Coleman Street.A.T.

Bolton and Hendry (eds), The City Churches, Vestry Minutes and Churchwardens' Accounts, Wren Society XIX (Oxford University Press 1942), p. 53. The church was destroyed by bombing in 1940. The following description exists: \"Communion Table and Rails. Table: with moulded top carved with acanthus-ornament, moulded stretchers carved with flowers and raised in a segmental curve in the middle of the long sides; the table is supported at the angles by large carved eagles and in the middle of the front and back is a seated cherub. Rails: with carved and panelled standards, turned, twisted and carved balusters, carved upper and lower rails.\"'Coleman Street Ward', in An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in London, Vol. 4: The City (Royal Commission, London 1929), pp. 71-76 (British History Online).

In 1681\u201382 Creecher and Newman were again employed to construct wainscots ten feet high for the Vestry room, and screens for the east and west doors.T. Milbourn, 'The Church of St Stephen, Walbrook', Transactions of the St Paul's Ecclesiological Society I (1881\u20131885), p. 212. == St Martin Ludgate == The surviving reredos at St Martin Ludgate may incorporate Newman's work, in the cherub heads, palm fronds and urns featured within the tall pedimented structure. Work at this church in 1683\u201386 was carried out by three joiners, Athew, Draper and Poulden, and by the carvers Cooper and William Newman.Bradley and Pevsner, London: The City Churches, p. 103.
