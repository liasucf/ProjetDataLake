    "text": "Malcolm Edward Gregson (born 15 August 1943) is an English professional golfer. Gregson was born in Leicester and educated at Millfield School in Somerset from 1957 to 1960. He turned professional in 1961 and was in his prime in the 1960s, before the official establishment of the European Tour in 1972. He won five tournaments on the European circuit, including three in 1967 when he collected the Harry Vardon Trophy as leader of the Order of Merit, which was based on a points system at that time. He also made his only appearances in the Ryder Cup and the World Cup in 1967. Gregson made the top one hundred on the Order of Merit in each of the European Tour's first nine official seasons and left the tour after the 1982 season. He joined the European Seniors Tour in 1994 and made the top ten on the Order of Merit in each of his first four seasons. Since 2006, he has only played a handful of tournaments each year. ==Professional wins (12)== ===Other wins (7)=== *1964 Gor-Ray Cup *1967 Daks Tournament, Schweppes PGA Championship, Martini International (tie with Brian Huggett) *1968 Daks Tournament *1972 Sumrie Better-Ball (with Brian Huggett) *1974 Cock of the North (Zambia) ===European Senior Tour wins (5)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner(s)-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|2 Jul 1994 |Tandem Stockley Park Seniors Opens |\u22128 (69-67-69=205) |1 stroke | John Morgan, Liam Higgins |- |align=center|2 |align=right|3 Aug 1996 |Lawrence Batley Seniors |\u22124 (69-75-65=209) |2 strokes | Neil Coles, Alberto Croce |- |align=center|3 |align=right|17 Oct 1998 |Is Molas Senior Open |\u22127 (67-73-69=209) |2 strokes | Tommy Horton |- |align=center|4 |align=right|15 Jun 2003 |Irvine Whitlock Jersey Seniors Classic |\u221213 (69-68-73=203) |3 strokes | Bob Cameron |- |align=center|5 |align=right|27 Jun 2004 |De Vere Northumberland Seniors Classic |\u22126 (69-68-73=210) |2 strokes | Seiji Ebihara |} ==Results in major championships== {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font- size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text- align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !1964 !1965 !1966 !1967 !1968 !1969 |- |align=left|Masters Tournament |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T35 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|The Open Championship |T19 |CUT |T47 |T51 |T27 |CUT |} {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text- align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !1970 !1971 !1972 !1973 !1974 !1975 !1976 !1977 !1978 !1979 |- |align=left|Masters Tournament |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|The Open Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T25 |CUT |CUT |T51 |CUT |T42 |CUT |CUT |CUT |} {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font- size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text- align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !1980 !1981 !1982 !1983 |- |align=left|Masters Tournament |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|The Open Championship |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |CUT |} Note: Gregson never played in the U.S. Open or PGA Championship.
