Dasburg extensively reworked by carving directly into a sculpture of a life-size plaster head by Arthur Lee.American Studies at the University of Virginia Dasburg was born in 1887 in Paris. He emigrated from Germany to New York City with his widowed mother in 1892. After a severe injury, he passed the time in convalescence by sketching. In 1902 he joined the Art Students League of New York on a scholarship, where he was taught by Kenyon Cox. At the League's summer school in Woodstock, New York, he studied landscapes under L. Birge Harrison. In 1909 Dasburg visited Paris and joined the modernist circle of artists living there, including Morgan Russell, Jo Davidson, and Arthur Lee. During a trip to London that same year he married sculptor Grace Mott Johnson. Johnson returned to the United States early the next year, but Dasburg stayed in Paris where he met Henri Matisse, Gertrude Stein and Leo Stein, and became influenced by the paintings of C\u00e9zanne and Cubism.Corley, Erin, A Finding Aid to the Andrew Dasburg and Grace Mott Johnson Papers, 1833-1980 (bulk 1900-1980), Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. He soon became an ardent promoter of the Cubist style. Dasburg returned to Woodstock, New York, in August and he and Johnson became active members of the artist community. In 1911 their son Alfred was born, the same year as Dasburg's first exhibition. Dasburg exhibited three oils and a sculpture at the \"International Exhibition of Modern Art\", better known the Armory Show, which opened in New York City's 69th Regiment Armory in 1913 and introduced astonished New Yorkers to modern art. Andrew Michael Dasburg, artnet. Accessed October 30, 2007. The three Cubist-oriented oils displayed at the 1913 show were considered \"daringly experimental\". In the years after the Armory Show, Dasburg's works were exhibited along with those of other Modernists at Alfred Stieglitz's 291 gallery.Corley, Erin, A Finding Aid to the Andrew Dasburg and Grace Mott Johnson Papers, 1833-1980 (bulk 1900-1980), Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. At the Armory show, Dasburg exhibited the only sculpture he had ever made. Prior to the show, he extensively reworked a sculpture, originally a life-size cast plaster head by Arthur Lee, by carving facets directly into the plaster of Paris. > I asked him if I could cut it which he was glad \u2013 we were very close > friends.

By 1917 they had separated and Dasburg began teaching painting in Woodstock and in New York City. In 1918 he was invited to Taos, New Mexico, by Mabel Dodge Luhan, and returning in 1919, Johnson joined him there for a period of time. After moving to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1921, Dasburg integrated the boxy traditional construction styles in New Mexico into his Cubist art.Zimmer, William. \"Mexico, Both Sides of the Border, From the Century's First Half\", The New York Times, October 27, 1996. Accessed October 30, 2007. \"Andrew Dasburg worked with the idea that New Mexican towns and villages, with their arrangements of box-like buildings, constituted a kind of Cubism in the flesh. His Taos Houses (New Mexican Village) is a good example of this.\" In 1924, Dasburg collaborated with a group of other artists and writers to form the Spanish and Indian Trading Company, a cooperative \"curio shop\" located on East San Francisco across from Santa Fe's La Fonda. In its inaugural year, the store sold Dasburg's own collection of Native American and Mexican blankets, and Witter Bynner's Navajo silver.[\"Curio Shop by Artists New Departure in Old Santa Fe\"], The Santa Fe New Mexican, April 24, 1924.

Andrew Dasburg, Improvisation, c.1915-16 In both New York and Taos, he was part of the social milieu that included Georgia O'Keeffe and Gertrude Stein, and a close friend of Mabel Dodge Luhan. A painting named The Absence of Mabel Dodge was allegedly painted to inflame the jealousy of her then- lover, mutual friend John Reed (it was a pointed reminder of a peyote celebration in which the two had shared), and for four years Dasburg and Reed's other lover Louise Bryant carried on an affair. The painting is now lost. The elderly Dasburg appeared posthumously as himself in the movie about Reed and Bryant, Reds, although he \"curiously ... does not speak of his intimacy with either\". He was also involved for some time with Ida Rauh, a co- founder of the Provincetown Players, and the two of them were friends with D. H. Lawrence and his wife Frieda von Richthofen, and helped Lawrence recover from a bout of tuberculosis that nearly got him refused entry to the U.S. at the border with Mexico.
