    "text": "Rhode Island School for the Deaf (RISD) is a school for deaf students in Rhode Island, United States, established in 1876. == History == ===Founding=== The school was founded on the initiative of the parents of Jeanie Lippitt, who became deaf due to scarlet fever when she was four years old in 1856. Her mother, Mary Ann Lippitt, taught Jeanie to communicate through lip reading and speaking. Jeanie\u2019s father, Henry Lippitt, became governor of Rhode Island in 1875. During these years, Jeanie visited the Rhode Island State house to convince members of the General Assembly to establish a school for deaf children. Henry\u2019s political endorsements allowed Jeanie\u2019s wishes to come true in 1877 when the General Assembly passed a bill to found a deaf school. The Rhode Island School for the Deaf is still functioning today in 2018. ===School name history=== 1876-1879: Providence Day School for the Deaf 1880-1888: Rhode Island School for the Deaf 1889-1892: State School for the Deaf 1895-1930: Rhode Island Institute for the Deaf 1931-present: Rhode Island School for the Deaf ===Principals/Directors=== 1876-1882: Joseph Warren Homer 1882-1885: Katherine H.
