    "text": "Phil Woods and his European Rhythm Machine at the Montreux Jazz Festival is a 1970 album by Phil Woods, produced by Johnny Pate. ==Reception== Scott Yanow reviewed the album for Allmusic and wrote that Woods' European Rhythm Machine was \"an adventurous unit that really challenged the altoist\" and \"one of the most underrated groups of the 1968-70 period\". Yanow concluded that \"It is very good to hear Phil Woods playing post-bop and almost avant-garde music for a change, but it is a pity that all of the intriguing group's recordings are currently out of print\". == Track listing == # \"Capricci Cavaleschi\" (George Gruntz) \u2013 9:50 # \"I Remember Bird\" (Leonard Feather) \u2013 10:15 # \"Ad Infinitum\" (Carla Bley) \u2013 10:20 # \"Riot\" (Herbie Hancock) \u2013 5:12 == Personnel == *Phil Woods \u2013 alto saxophone *George Gruntz \u2013 piano *Henri Texier \u2013 double bass *Daniel Humair \u2013 drums *Johnny Pate \u2013 producer ==References== Category:1969 live albums Category:Albums recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival Category:Albums produced by Johnny Pate Category:Phil Woods live albums Category:MGM Records live albums Category:Instrumental albums ",
