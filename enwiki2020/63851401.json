    "text": "Jamharat Ash'ar al-Arab (; The Gathering of the Arabs' Verses) is an early Arabic poetry anthology by . The date of publication is unknown, and al- Qurashi is supposed by various scholars to have lived in the 8th, 9th or 10th centuries. It contains seven sections, each containing seven qasidas. ==Sections== The first section consists of the seven Mu'allaqat. The anthology is the first source to use the name Mu'allaqat; earlier writers describe the poems simply as \"the Seven.\" Al-Qurashi's choice of poems is somewhat idiosyncratic, as he includes Al-Nabigha and Al-A'sha among the seven and excludes Antarah ibn Shaddad and Al-Harith.El Tayib 1983, p. 112. The second section is called \"al-Mujamharat\" (\"the assembled\"). It contains poems by , Adi ibn Zayd, , , , , and Antarah ibn Shaddad. The third section is \"al- Muntuqayat\", \"the chosen\".Mustafa 1963, p. 120. Represented poets include Abu Layla al-Muhalhel, Urwa ibn al-Ward, and Dorayd bin Al Soma. The fourth section, \"al-Mudhahhabat\" (\"the gilded ones\") consists solely of poetry from the Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj tribes.Mustafa 1963, p. 121. It contains poems by Hassan ibn Thabit, Abdullah ibn Rawaha, and Amr ibn Imru al-Qays. The fifth section contains elegies, and the sixth, \"al-Mashubat\", contains \"testimonies of faith mingled with heresy\".Mustafa 1963, p. 122. One of the Mashubat is by Ka'b ibn Zuhayr, famous for reciting the poem in question in front of Muhammad. The final section, \"al-Mulhamat\", is ambiguous in meaning but probably means that the poems refer to bloody fights or struggles.Mustafa 1963, pp. 125\u20136. Represented poets include Al-Farazdaq and Al-Akhtal al- Taghlibi. ==References== Category:9th-century Arabic books Category:10th- century Arabic books Category:Abbasid literature Category:Arabic anthologies Category:Medieval Arabic poems ",
