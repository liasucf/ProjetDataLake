    "text": "The National Corvette Homecoming is an annual event held in Bowling Green, Kentucky celebrating America's production sports car, the Chevrolet Corvette. First held in 1981, it was created by two Corvette enthusiasts, Tom Hill and Sam Hall, in response to the assembly of Corvettes moving from St. Louis, MO to the Bowling Green Assembly Plant, which is currently the sole assembler of the car. The event is a summertime event that focuses on vintage as well as modern Corvettes. The homecoming offers Corvette owners and specialty vendors opportunities to network. All Corvette production years and custom variations are welcome. The event features competitions in numerous judged shows, along with informative seminars to expand on Corvette knowledge. The event features a unique opportunity to find parts and products that will enhance Corvette ownership. There is a Corvette road tour, car corral, special parties, live music and an exclusive show called Sans Pareil (without equal). And in 2014 a new class was added called The Originals where the cars have to be at least 30 years and 80% original. The Homecoming also welcomes other classic vehicles including muscle cars and antiques. In 2008, NCH announced its first Grand Marshal, Bloomington Gold CEO David Burroughs.
