    "text": "The Rockingham 500 was an annual Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) motor race held at the Rockingham Motor Speedway oval track in Corby, Northamptonshire, England, United Kingdom in 2001 and 2002. The event was the first major motor race held on an oval track featuring Champ Cars in the United Kingdom. It was created in the hope of rivalling the Formula One British Grand Prix, although CART had problems promoting the event to the public. The inaugural race, held in 2001, was marred by drainage problems, and was won by Team Penske driver Gil de Ferran. It was last held the following year when a poor trading environment and inclement weather conditions affected the track. The race was moved to Brands Hatch for 2003 under the name London Champ Car Trophy. The event was instrumental in helping the Rockingham Motor Speedway become established on the world motor sport scene, and brought a new type of racing to Britain. ==History== The plan to hold a CART motor race was revealed publicly in October 1999 by former property developer Peter Davies during the construction of the Rockingham Motor Speedway. It was announced in July 2000 that Rockingham would hold a race for the 2001 season. It would be the second event to occur in Europe, following the German 500 at the EuroSpeedway Lausitz in Klettwitz, Germany. The event would take place on a four-turn oval track that has banking of up to 7.9 degrees. The organisers signed a five-year contract with CART to hold the event. It would become the first time since 1978 that Champ Cars had participated in Europe, and the first time the vehicles had driven on an oval track in the United Kingdom. Several observers were doubtful about the chances of CART holding a race in England, noting that past similar schemes were unsuccessful. It was started in the hope it would rival the British Grand Prix. At an early stage, CART encountered problems in promoting the race. They were unable to adequately educate British motor racing fans about the series. Rockingham's owners attempted to display an advertisement at the 2001 British Grand Prix but the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone cancelled the plan shortly before it was due to occur. A major marketing strategy took place in response. The advertising, headed by the Michaelides & Bednash agency, began in August in the printed press, and also included two television advertisements and an official poster. The event was affected by drainage problems on the new track which caused the practice sessions to be cancelled. The starting order was set according to the drivers' positions in the points' standings. Its distance was reduced from 210 to 140 laps and was won by Team Penske driver Gil de Ferran after overtaking pole position starter Kenny Br\u00e4ck on the race's final lap. Most drivers praised the circuit but did not criticise the problem that affected it. Despite two days of practice and qualifying rounds being cancelled because of the drainage issues, 38,000 spectators watched the race. The track later had an extra layer added along with a sealant to allow it to drain water. During the planning for the 2002 race, it was announced that a provisional date for 2003 had been set at 4 May. The then Chief Executive of the circuit David Grace said it presented an opportunity to hold the event at the start of summer, and give motor racing fans \"the ideal start\" to the season. He noted the moving of dates did not involve additional risk of bad weather as the meteorological information the track accumulated showed the months of May and September were the driest of the year. The 2002 event had better weather but was down on attendance. It was won by Team Green driver Dario Franchitti. In an attempt to promote the race, Dale Coyne Racing formed what was described as an \"all-England\" team named Team St. George with British American Racing Formula One test driver and ASCAR Days of Thunder series competitor Darren Manning. Some journalists believed there was a possibility the race would not be run because of the cancellation of the German 500 owing to financial difficulties. Rockingham renegotiated its sanctioning fee from $4.2 million to $2.8 million, claiming the event's reputation had been damaged by the German 500's cancellation. In November 2002, Rockingham Motor Speedway's chief executive Ashley Power began talks with CART officials hoping to end the race's five-year contract early because of a poor trading environment and inclement weather conditions. He added the circuit would make a loss, contradicting a forecast made by the track's former chairman Peter Middleton in January. This was due partially to the track financing the Team St. George operation although Rockingham sold sponsorship to regain some of its deficit. On 25 November, it was announced that Rockingham Motor Speedway would not hold its scheduled 2003 race but CART and track personnel declared their intention to explore the possibility of holding similar events in future years. It was revealed that the track did not have the resources to develop a marketing program and the time find a new title sponsor. The delay until 2004 would allow them to reach those targets. The race helped Rockingham to become established on the world motor sport scene, and created a new attraction for British motor racing fans. It was moved to the Brands Hatch Indy circuit for 2003 and was held under the name London Champ Car Trophy. ==Race winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! rowspan=\"2\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" | Driver ! rowspan=\"2\" | Team ! rowspan=\"2\" | Chassis ! rowspan=\"2\" | Engine ! colspan=\"2\" | Race Distance ! rowspan=\"2\" | Race Time ! rowspan=\"2\" | Average Speed (mph) ! rowspan=\"2\" | Report ! rowspan=\"2\" | |- !
