    "text": "The Battle of Strangford Lough was fought in 877 between two groups of rival Vikings described by the Irish Annals as the \"fair heathens\" and the \"dark heathens\". The Annals of Ulster describe \"Albann\", a figure usually identified with Halfdan Ragnarsson, a leader of the Great Heathen Army, as king of the \"dark heathens\", and Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib identifies B\u00e1rid mac \u00cdmair, King of Dublin as the leader of the \"fair heathens\". All accounts agree Halfdan was killed in the battle, and Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib adds that B\u00e1rid was wounded in it. ==Background== Sometime in the 850s or 860s the three Viking brothers \u00cdmar, Amla\u00edb Conung and Auisle began to rule as kings in Dublin.\u00d3 Corrain (1998), p. 28-29 \u00cdmar died in 873, Amla\u00edb in 874, and Auisle in 867; with B\u00e1rid, son of \u00cdmar probably succeeding them as king.Downham, p. 24, 28 Some scholars have also suggested that Oistin, son of Amla\u00edb ruled with B\u00e1rid as co-king.Sigur\u00f0sson and Bolton, p. 36-37 According to some scholars Halfdan Ragnarsson was brother to \u00cdmar, Amla\u00edb Conung and Auisle, and hence uncle to B\u00e1rid and Oistin.Downham, p. 16 Halfdan is not described as ruling in Ireland like his brothers in any contemporary source, but he is instead described as one of the leaders of the Great Heathen Army which invaded the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England from 865 onwards.Venning, p. 132 Halfdan is identified by some as a brother of the three kings of Dublin because in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle he is described as the brother of another leader of the Great Heathen Army named \u00cdvarr. This \u00cdvarr is often considered the same as \u00cdmar, primarily because \u00cdmar is absent from Irish records during the period \u00cdvarr is described as a leader of the Great Heathen Army.\u00d3 Corrain (1979), p. 314-323 According to the later Norse sagas Halfdan was the son of the legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok, but the historicity of Ragnar is uncertain and the identification of Ragnar as the father of Halfdan is not to be relied upon.Costambeys The main historical sources for this period are the Norse sagas and the Irish annals. Some of the annals, such as the Annals of Ulster are believed to be contemporary accounts, whereas the sagas were written down at dates much later than the events they describe and are considered far less reliable. A few of the annals such as the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland and the Annals of the Four Masters were also complied at later dates, in part from more contemporary material and in part from fragments of sagas.Radner, pp. 322-325 According to Downham: \"apart from these additions [of saga fragments], Irish chronicles are considered by scholars to be largely accurate records, albeit partisan in their presentation of events\".Downham, p. 12 ==Battle== The Annals of Ulster record a battle taking place in 877: According to South \"there is now general agreement that Halfdan [Ragnarson] is identical with Albann\".South, p. 87 Albann is mentioned only one in other time in the annals; in 875 he is named as the killer of Oistin mac Amla\u00edb, possible co-king of Dublin.Downham, p. 238 Assuming Albann and Halfdan to be the same person, and assuming Halfdan to be the brother of \u00cdmar, this makes Oistin's death nepoticide. Downham suggests this familial connection indicates a motive for the murder; it was part of a dynastic squabble for control of the kingdom.Downham, p. 68 Downham also suggests the squabble continued until 877, of which the battle described by the Annals of Ulster was the culmination. The Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib expands on the Annals of Ulster account: In this account Halfdan is to be identified with \"Ragnall's son\". However, this is problematic since in the Fragmentary Annals the name of \u00cdmar, Amla\u00edb, and Auisle's father is Gofraid, not Ragnall.Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, \u00a7 400 It is possible Ragnall is simply a rendering of Ragnar, meaning Ragnar Lodbrok, who is named as Halfdan's father in the later (and more historically dubious) sagas.Saga Book of the Viking Society for Northern Research, p. 86, note 1 ==Notes== ==References== ===Citations=== ===Primary sources=== * * * * * Accessed via Internet Archive. ===Secondary sources=== * Subscription or UK public library membership required. * * * * * * * * ==External links== * CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork.
