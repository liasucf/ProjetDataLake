    "text": "Digestive Disorders Foundation is a British medical research charity dedicated to the research of digestive disorders. _Guts UK_ is the current name of the Digestive Disorders Foundation. In 1970, the Council of the British Society of Gastroenterology first considered founding a charity to promote research in this speciality. A steering group, chaired by their President at the time, Dr Nelson Coghill, compiled facts and figures which established the importance of digestive disorders as a national health problem. Using this evidence as a basis for appeal, a Digestive Disorders Trust Fund was established. Dr Thomas Hunt, a founder member of the British Society of Gastroenterology, agreed to launch the new charity. He succeeded in attracting prominent lay and professional support. By 1974 its funds were sufficient to award the first research fellowship and to inaugurate the charity as a Foundation with Dr Hunt as its first President. On his death in 1980, Sir Francis Avery Jones took over the presidency for the next 12 years. Important landmarks during this time were the appointment of the first full-time director, expansion of research support and the development of the successful patient information programme. Today, Guts UK are the only UK charity funding research into the entire digestive system. Their vision is of a world where digestive disorders are better understood, better treated and everyone who lives with one gets the support they need. To date, the charity have put over \u00a315 million into research of the digestive system and continue to print and provide over 180,000 patient information leaflets per year to hospitals, clinics and other medical organisations across the country. ==See also== Guts UK Charity Website ==References== ==External links== * Category:Health charities in the United Kingdom Category:Gastroenterology organizations ",
