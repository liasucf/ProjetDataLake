    "text": "Lenore Keeshig-Tobias is an author and a major advocate for Indigenous writers in Canada. She is a member of the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation. She was one of the central figures in the debates over cultural appropriation in Canadian literature in the 1990s. Along with Daniel David Moses and Tomson Highway, she was a founding member of the Indigenous writers' collective, Committee to Reestablish the Trickster. == Biography == Keeshig-Tobias was born Lenore Keeshig in Wiarton, Ontario in 1950, the eldest of ten children of Keitha (Johnston) and Donald Keeshig. She went to school on the Cape Croker Reserve and then at Loretto Academy in Niagara Falls and the Wiarton District High School. She later attended York University in Toronto and received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1983. == Advocacy == In 1990, she published an essay in Canada's The Globe and Mail newspaper, entitled \"Stop Stealing Native Stories,\" in which she critiqued non-Native writers' use of Native stories and experiences as a \"theft of voice,\" pointing to the examples of Darlene Barry Quaife's Bone Bird, W.P. Kinsella's Hobbema, and the film Where the Spirit Lives. She argued that the prominence of these works by settler writers came at the expense of even the most celebrated works by Native writers, such as Basil Johnston's Indian School Days and Maria Campbell's Half Breed, which did not generate a comparable critical reception or institutional support. In 1991, Keeshig-Tobias became the founding chair of the Racial Minority Writers' Committee at the Writers' Union of Canada after raising concerns about access to institutional and professional support for Indigenous and racialized writers. In 1992, the Racial Minority Writers' Committee organized The Appropriate Voice, a gathering of 70 Indigenous and racialized writers in Orillia, Ontario meant to identify their shared concerns and barriers to publishing in Canada. This session produced a motion against cultural appropriation that was forwarded to the Writers' Union of Canada and passed by its general membership on June 6, 1992. These efforts led to the 1994 Writing Thru Race conference, a gathering of Indigenous and racialized writers in Vancouver, hosted by the Writers' Union of Canada. Keeshig-Tobias addressed the gathering on the opening night of the event. Writing Thru Race is now considered to be a major milestone in race politics and literature in Canada. == Published Works == Keeshig-Tobias has published two bilingual children's books in English and Ojibway: Bird Talk (Sister Vision Press, 1991) and Emma and the Trees (Sister Vision Press, 1996). Together with her spouse, David McLaren, she also wrote The Truth about Nibbles (Ningwakwe Learning Press, 2005). All three were illustrated by her daughter, Polly Keeshig-Tobias. She is the editor of the collection, Into the Moon: Heart, Mind, Body, Soul (Sister Vision Press, 1996), an anthology of poetry, fiction, myth, and personal essays by Native women. == References == == External links == *Reprint of \"Stop Stealing Native Stories\" Category:1950 births Category:Anishinaabe people Category:Canadian women non-fiction writers Category:York University alumni Category:20th-century Canadian non-fiction writers Category:First Nations artists Category:First Nations women writers Category:21st-century Canadian non-fiction writers Category:20th-century First Nations writers Category:21st-century First Nations writers Category:Canadian children's writers Category:Living people Category:Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation ",
