Roller is known as one of the most decorated athletes in his state's history, a standout at Bixby High School while competing in wrestling, baseball, and football, lettering in each, and was the Tulsa World's 1998 Male Athlete of the Year. In baseball, he was a two-time letterman, playing shortstop, hitting in the lead-off spot, and was twice selected for the All-Metro Honorable Mention Team. In football, Roller played quarterback, running back, free safety, and was a three-time letterman. Roller was selected to play in the Jim Thorpe All-Star Game and was also selected as the 1997 Oklahoma Football Coaches Association All-Star Running Back. In wrestling, Roller was his high school's first four-time state champion and was twice selected as the Most Outstanding Wrestler at the state tournament. He compiled a 141-3 record and was selected for the All-State team, being voted the Most Outstanding Wrestler at the All-State match. He was also an Asics First Team All-American and received the Junior Hodge Award which is given to the nation's most dominant high school wrestler. Roller also received the Dave Schultz award which is for academic and athletic excellence, as he was also his class' salutatorian and a member of the National Honor Society. He received a scholarship to continue competing in wrestling for Oklahoma State University and was a three-time NCAA All-American, three-time Academic All-American, and Big 12 Champion. Roller was also the captain of the 2003 NCAA Championship team, and earned a bachelor's degree in psychology. He later earned his master's degree from the school while working as an assistant coach, earning three NCAA championships. ==Mixed martial arts career== ===Early career=== Roller made his professional mixed martial arts debut in 2007 and compiled a record of 3-1 before being signed by the WEC. ===World Extreme Cagefighting=== Roller made his WEC debut defeating Todd Moore at WEC 35 via submission (guillotine choke) at 3:00 of the first round.
