The exhibition took place on the same site where IGA 63 was held a decade earlier. There were some changes to the site location, such as the vaulting of the Marseillerstrasse so that visitors throughout the area without crossing could visit. Instead of a cable car, a park trail was constructed on the site to provide for visitors. The line had four stations and took 30 minutes to complete a lap. ==References== ==External links== * Official website of the BIE Category:International Horticultural Exhibitions Category:1973 in Germany Category:Festivals in Hamburg Category:Garden festivals in Germany ",
