    "text": "In mathematics, an LB-space, also written (LB)-space, is a topological vector space X that is a locally convex inductive limit of a countable inductive system (X_n, i_{nm}) of Banach spaces. This means that X is a direct limit of a direct system \\left( X_n, i_{nm} \\right) in the category of locally convex topological vector spaces and each is a Banach space. If each of the bonding maps i_{nm} is an embedding of TVSs then the LB-space is called a strict LB- space. This means that the topology induced on by > is identical to the original topology on . Some authors (e.g. Schaefer) define the term \"LB-space\" to mean \"strict LB-space,\" so when reading mathematical literature, its recommended to always check how LB-space is defined. == Definition == The topology on can be described by specifying that an absolutely convex subset is a neighborhood of 0 if and only if U \\cap X_n is an absolutely convex neighborhood of in for every n. == Properties == A strict LB-space is complete, barrelled,, and bornological (and thus ultrabornological). == Examples == * If is a locally compact topological space that is countable at infinity (i.e. equal to a countable union of compact subspaces) then the space C_c(D) of all continuous, complex-valued functions on with compact support is a strict LB-space. For any compact subset K \\subseteq D, let C_c(K) denote the Banach space of complex-valued functions that are supported by K with the uniform norm and order the family of compact subsets of by inclusion. === Counter-examples === * There exists a bornological LB-space whose strong bidual is not bornological. * There exists an LB-space that is not quasi-complete. == See also == * DF-space * Direct limit * Final topology * LF-space == References == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Topological vector spaces ",
