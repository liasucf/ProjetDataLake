The company also operates a chocolate-making school at its factory in Perugia, which commenced in 2007. Perugina was purchased by the Nestl\u00e9 corporation in 1988, and it is now a division of Nestl\u00e9 corporation. ==History== The company was formed in 1907 by Francesco Buitoni, Annibale Spagnoli, Leone Ascoli and Francesco Andreani. It was founded in the town of Perugia, which is located in the Umbria region of central Italy. A great deal in Perugina's success is attributed to Luisa Spagnoli, who created the chocolate brand Perugina and played the paramount role in the chocolate factory setup and further development. The company was introduced to the United States at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City, and since became known for producing fine chocolates. Perugina also opened a retail store on Fifth Avenue in New York City circa 1939.. ==Products== The company produces a wide array of chocolate and food products, including chocolate bars, hard candy, nougat, and biscotti.
