The team is managed by the \"Argentine Cerebral Palsy Football Federation\" (FAFPC). Their best world ranking sixth and their lowest was ninth. Argentina has competed at both the IFCPF World Championships and the Paralympic Games, but has never finished in the medals in either event. == Overview == In 2012, the team was coached by Osvaldo Hern\u00e1ndez. In February 2014, an IFCPF coaching workshop was held in Brazil to try to further develop the sport. Chilean, Brazilian and Argentine coaches participated in it. National team development is supported by an International Federation of Cerebral Palsy Football (IFCPF) recognized national championship. Recognized years for the national IFCPF recognized competition include 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. In 2016, after getting an endorsement by the World AntiDoping Agency (WADA), the IFCPF Anti-Doping Code was formally amended to allow for out of competition testing. This was done through a WADA approved Whereabouts Programme managed through ADAMS. Drawing from players in a Registered Testing Pool, players from this country were included ahead of the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio. == Ranking == Argentina was ranked sixth in the world by the IFCPF in 2016. The team is also ranked second in the Americas in 2016. In August 2013 and November 2014, Argentina was also ranked sixth in the world. In September 2012, the team was ranked eighth.

The draw for the tournament was held on May 6 at the 2016 Pre Paralympic Tournament in Salou, Spain. Argentina was put into Group B with the United States, Netherlands and Russia. Iran qualified for the 2016 Rio Games following the suspension of Russia. The IPC ruled that there could not be a redraw for the groups. This resulted in Iran being put into Group A with the Netherlands, Argentina and the United States. The tournament where the Paralympic draw took place featured 7 of the 8 teams participating in Rio. It was the last major preparation event ahead of the Rio Games for all teams participating. Argentina finished 7th after losing placement matches to the United States 4 - 3 and Ireland 0 - 3. Going into the Rio Games, the team was hoping to build on good results earlier in past two years and win a medal. == References == ==External links== * Cerebral Palsy Category:Argentina at the Paralympics Category:National cerebral palsy football teams Category:Football 7-a-side teams at the 2016 Summer Paralympics Category:Football 7-a-side teams at the 2012 Summer Paralympics Category:Football 7-a-side teams at the 2004 Summer Paralympics Category:Football 7-a-side teams at the 2000 Summer Paralympics Category:Football 7-a-side teams at the 1996 Summer Paralympics ",
