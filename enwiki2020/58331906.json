    "text": "\"Forbidden Fruit\" is the third episode of the eighth season of the anthology television series American Horror Story. It aired on September 26, 2018, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Manny Coto, and directed by Loni Peristere. ==Plot== Langdon refers to Timothy and Emily\u2019s indiscretion and the murder of Evie as \u201cminor infractions\u201d and directs Mr. Gallant to say his grandmother died in her sleep. He notes to Dinah that he was surprised to find her at Outpost 3 and she contends that she is not \u201cpowerful enough\u201d to stop him. In her interview with Langdon, Mallory insists that she has no dark urges within her, however she does admit to feeling unsure of who she really is as a person. When Langdon tries to push her into admitting more about her fears, the young woman tries to flee the room but Langdon grabs her by the arm in an attempt to continue probing her. Finally losing control Mallory screams for him to let go and telekinetically throws him off of her. Langdon then lunges at her, and exposes his demonic form. However an unflinching Mallory retaliates by shooting flames out of the fireplace behind him, effectively disarming him and surprising them both by the revelation of her supernatural powers. Later, a troubled Langdon performs a Satanic ritual and calls for guidance from his father, cutting himself in sacrifice. He says that he thought he \u201cdestroyed them all\u201d but that \u201cone survived\u201d. Ms. Mead describes her false memories to Ms. Venable, including the memory of a blonde boy, and laments her artificiality. Venable admits that she has not been selected to move on to the Sanctuary. Mead suggests they kill the other inhabitants of Outpost 3 and venture to the Sanctuary on their own. In the ruins of Los Angeles, Brock stumbles upon a pair of cannibals while searching for Coco. The two claim no knowledge of the Outpost 3's location as a third approaches Brock from behind, but Brock preempts the attack and guns down the tribe. He then beholds a horse-drawn carriage pass him by. The Outpost 3 perimeter alarm sounds off and Mead and The Fist investigate. They approach the carriage and find it vacant, save for a trunk, not seeing Brock clinging to the undercarriage. Inside the trunk, Venable, Mead, and The Fist discover apples. Venable suggests to Mead that they poison the others. Outside, The Fist prepares to execute the horses and is killed by Brock, who steals her identification card and enters Outpost 3. Inside, Mallory ponders her unknown nature and Venable calls for a meeting. Venable announces that they will be celebrating Halloween in the form of a Victorian masquerade ball. Coco suspects the ball to be a ruse for announcing who has been chosen for the Sanctuary. At the ball, a masked figure approaches Coco; presuming the man to be Langdon, Coco ingratiates herself and offers anilingus. Back in her room, the figure takes off his mask, revealing himself to be Brock. She feigns happiness for the arrival of her ex-boyfriend, but Brock stabs her in the forehead. After everyone has had a chance to bob for apples, the purples and grays feast on them together. Venable and Mead have injected the apples with venom, and the inhabitants of Outpost 3 soon die. The pair seeks out Langdon in his bedroom, and Venable tells him that they will be making the selections. Langdon calls Venable \"perfect\" for the Sanctuary but Venable urges Mead to shoot him regardless. A perplexed and devastated Mead is unable to and executes Venable instead. Langdon consoles her by revealing that she was modelled after someone dear to him from his childhood. Langdon beckons \"the only woman who ever really understood\" him to be by his side. The song on the radio shifts to The Rolling Stones' \"She's a Rainbow\" as Cordelia Goode, Madison Montgomery, and Myrtle Snow descend upon Outpost 3. Cordelia resurrects their \"sisters\": Mallory, Dinah, and Coco. Madison straddles a bewildered Mallory and remarks \"Surprise, bitch. I bet you thought you\u2019d seen the last of me.\" ==Reception== \"Forbidden Fruit\" was watched by 1.95 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 0.9 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349. The episode has been critically acclaimed, with most of the critics praising the cliffhanger. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \"Forbidden Fruit\" holds a 100% approval rating, based on 18 reviews with an average rating of 8.13/10. The critical consensus reads, \"\"Forbidden Fruit\" pushes Apocalypse forward, delivering on the gore, the glee, and most importantly, the girls.\" Ron Hogan of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4.5/5, saying, \"So far, aside from a mention of genetic perfection, there hasn't been much of a tie-in to the world of the witches (or to the ghosts, for the matter, aside from Michael Langdon's presence). However, that connection was made more openly this week, after a solid episode which featured some very impressive visual trickery from director Loni Peristere. From the cold opening to the surprise at the end, 'Forbidden Fruit' is one of the most impressive editorial feats of the entire series, let alone this season.\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+. She particularly praised the ball scenes, saying that they are \"a serious mashup of various fairytale tropes: poisoned apples, a masquerade ball, and even a Cinderella figure yearning for greater things in the background\", and also appreciated all the different twists of the episode. Finally, she enjoyed the cliffhanger with the Coven witches. Vultures Ziwe Fumudoh gave the episode a 5 out of 5, with a positive review. Much like Rosenfield, she particularly praised the death scene of all Outpost 3 inhabitants, commenting that \"I have never been so disgusted and so entertained in my life\", and also liked the revelation about Mead's and Langdon's relationship. Finally, she really enjoyed the arrival of the witches, and the cliffhanger of the episode. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 6.8 out of 10, with a mixed to positive review. He said, \"Once the music switched from Bread to Rolling Stones, and the Coven ladies majestically swooped in, things felt infused with more energy. There was a welcome supernatural lightness in those final moments that seemed to coat all the previous ugliness and stuffiness with a silver sheen. That's not to say the season's about to get exponentially better, but it was a very welcome shift from the Lazy Susan of aggravation these past few weeks have offered up.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:American Horror Story: Apocalypse episodes ",
