Vendors must be verified prior to getting a vendor status on the forum. The Hub has hosted Dr. Fernando Caudevilla, 'DoctorX' as an adviser for the site's drug users who has answered more than a thousand questions in the forums of the original Silk Road and Silk Road 2.0 and the site has an ongoing harm reduction and drug awareness program. == References == == External links == * Category:Darknet markets Category:Internet properties established in 2014 Category:Tor onion services Category:Internet forums ",
