    "text": "The national anthem of the Dominican Republic was composed by Jos\u00e9 Rufino Reyes y Siancas (1835-1905), and its lyrics were authored by Emilio Prud\u2019Homme (1856-1932). ==Overview== The first public performance of the national anthem took place on 17 August 1883. Though the music was an instant success, several objections were made to the lyrics for having various historical inaccuracies. In 1897, Prud\u2019Homme submitted revised lyrics which stand to this day. On 7 June 1897, the Congress of the Dominican Republic passed an act adopting \"Himno Nacional\" with the original music and revised lyrics as the country's official national anthem; however, then-President Ulises Heureaux (1846-1898) vetoed the act because the lyric's author, Prud\u2019Homme, was an opponent of the president and his administration. In 1899, Heureaux was assassinated, and the political disorder that ensued prevented the national anthem's legal adoption until 30 May 1934 when \"Himno Nacional\" was officially adopted and signed into law. The Spanish name of the Dominican Republic, \"Rep\u00fablica Dominicana\", is never used in the anthem's official Spanish lyrics nor is the demonym for Dominicans, \"dominicanos\". Rather, the indigenous word for the island of Hispaniola, \"Quisqueya\", is used twice and its derivative demonym, \"quisqueyanos\", is used once. However, research later shows that these words does not seem to derive from the original Arawak Ta\u00edno language. In public, the national anthem is usually performed through the end of the lyric's fourth paragraph. Also note that, no official translation of the Spanish lyrics into any other language, including English, has been enacted into law. ==Lyrics== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Spanish lyrics !English translation |- | Quisqueyanos valientes, alcemos Nuestro canto con viva emoci\u00f3n, Y del mundo a la faz ostentemos Nuestro invicto glorioso pend\u00f3n. \u00a1Salve! el pueblo que, intr\u00e9pido y fuerte, A la guerra a morir se lanz\u00f3, Cuando en b\u00e9lico reto de muerte Sus cadenas de esclavo rompi\u00f3. Ning\u00fan pueblo ser libre merece Si es esclavo indolente y servil; Si en su pecho la llama no crece Que templ\u00f3 el hero\u00edsmo viril, Mas Quisqueya la ind\u00f3mita y brava Siempre altiva la frente alzar\u00e1; Que si fuere mil veces esclava Otras tantas ser libre sabr\u00e1. Que si dolo y ardid la expusieron De un intruso se\u00f1or al desd\u00e9n, \u00a1Las Carreras! \u00a1Beller!, campos fueron Que cubiertos de gloria se ven. Que en la cima de hero\u00edco baluarte De los libres el verbo encarn\u00f3, Donde el genio de S\u00e1nchez y Duarte A ser libre o morir ense\u00f1\u00f3. Y si pudo inconsulto caudillo De esas glorias el brillo empa\u00f1ar, De la guerra se vio en Capotillo La bandera de fuego ondear. Y el incendio que at\u00f3nito deja De Castilla al soberbio le\u00f3n, De las playas gloriosas le aleja Donde flota el cruzado pend\u00f3n. Compatriotas, mostremos erguida Nuestra frente, orgullosos de hoy m\u00e1s; Que Quisqueya ser\u00e1 destruida Pero sierva de nuevo, \u00a1jam\u00e1s! Que es santuario de amor cada pecho Do la patria se siente vivir; Y es su escudo invencible el derecho; Y es su lema ser libre o morir. \u00a1Libertad! que a\u00fan se yergue serena La Victoria en su carro triunfal, Y el clar\u00edn de la guerra a\u00fan resuena Pregonando su gloria inmortal. \u00a1Libertad! Que los ecos se agiten Mientras llenos de noble ansiedad Nuestros campos de gloria repiten \u00a1Libertad! \u00a1Libertad! \u00a1Libertad! | Brave Quisqueyans, Let\u2019s raise our song with vivid emotion, From the world to the face of the earth Show our unconquered glorious banner. Hail, the nation who strong and intrepid, Into war launched itself set to die When in a warring challenge to the death Its chains of slavery still it cut off. No people deserves to be free If it\u2019s an indolent slave and servile; If in its chest doesn't grow the flame that forged virile heroism. But Quisqueya the brave and indomitable Always proudly her forehead will raise For if she were a thousand times a slave This many times it will be free. And if fraud and cunning exposed her To disdain of an intrusive man, Las Carreras! Beler!...were fields Which covered in glory were seen. At the top of our heroic bastion, Word of the free was materialized, Where the genius of Sanchez and Duarte Taught us to be free or to die. And if could inconsiderate leader Reduce the luster of these glories, Of the war seen in Capotillo The banner of fire waves on. And the fire that leaves shocked The arrogant lion from Castile, Removes it from glorious beaches to Where floats the banner that\u2019s crossed. Compatriots, let\u2019s show erect our Forehead, proud of today for; Quisqueya will be destroyed But it will never be again enslaved. That every chest is of love a sanctuary Where one feels the homeland lives; It is the law her invincible shield; It is her motto be free or die. Liberty that still serenely lifts up Victory in her triumphal carriage. The trumpet of war still resounds Proclaiming her immortal glory Freedom! Let the echoes agitate While full of noble anxiety Our battlefields of glory reverb these words - Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! |} ==References== ==External links== * El himno nacional de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana * Audio of the national anthem of the Dominican Republic with information and lyrics * Ceremonial performance of the Dominican Republic's national anthem * Vocal Category:Dominican Republic music Category:National symbols of the Dominican Republic Dominican Republic Category:Spanish-language songs Category:National anthems Category:National anthem compositions in E-flat major ",
