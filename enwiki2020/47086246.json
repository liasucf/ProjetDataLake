The highway connects the north-eastern and southern regions of Poland, running from Ku\u017anica at the Belarus border to Barwinek at the Slovak border, traversing through the Podlaskie, Masovian, Lublin and Podkarpackie voivodeships. National road 19 is part of European highway E371. Until the 1980s way between Lublin and Rzesz\u00f3w was marking the national road No. 26, and between Lublin and Radzy\u0144 Podlaski national road No. 24. The remaining length of the route did not have the status of national road. After renumbering of roads, route 19 near Bia\u0142ystok led in the direction of August\u00f3w, Suwa\u0142ki, to the border in Budzisko (today's Route 8 E67). Later changed course from Bia\u0142ystok towards Sok\u00f3\u0142ka to the border in Ku\u017anica (former road No. 18). ==Major cities and towns along the route== * Ku\u017anica (border with Belarus) * Sok\u00f3\u0142ka * Sochonie (road 8) * Bia\u0142ystok (road 8, 65) * Bielsk Podlaski (road 66) * Siemiatycze (road 62) * \u0141osice * Mi\u0119dzyrzec Podlaski (road 2) * Radzy\u0144 Podlaski (road 63) * Kock (road 48) * Lublin (S12, S17) * Kra\u015bnik (road 74) * Jan\u00f3w Lubelski (road 74) * Nisko (road 77) * Rzesz\u00f3w (road 9, road 94) * Miejsce Piastowe (road 28) * Barwinek (border with Slovakia) 19 ",
