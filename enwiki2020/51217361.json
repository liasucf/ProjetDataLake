The parish's patroness is Saint Anne. == History == === The Grupo === In the year 1908 started the Grupo of their annual feast. The first Ermita measured 6m x 10m, was built on the land of Silverio Merluza. At present, it is owned by Dolores Villasenor VDA. De Guevarra, in the care of Nena Bendico. It is on the right side of the old road, built near the former elementary school. The school (Malicboy Elementary School) was made a Japanese garrison. According to the people of Crossing, adjacent to the former hermitage was built a tomb for the people killed by Japanese soldiers including three nuns in white. The Grupo, led by Pio Dimalaluan and Enrique Glorioso agreed to seek the help of Lino Castro, who is from the town proper, Pagbilao and owner of the farm cultivated by Pio. Lino was the one who would invite a priest to say mass for their fiesta. Father and daughter Lino and Ana then arranged that the fiesta mass on their farm be held on Ana's birthday which is July 26. On that day Ana Castro brought the picture of her patron saint; St. Anne. From then on, Ana brought the picture every year until she had it enshrined in the ermita under the care of Pio. The Grupo is an organization of males in Malicboy. \u2022Grupo ng Crossing \u2013 Enrique Glorioso, Boris Tiay and Felicisimo Tiay \u2022Grupo ng Sapinit \u2013 Pio Dimalaluan, Cipriano Ayala, Catalino \u201cTog-ok\u201d Catausan, and Miguel Merjudio Lorenzo Salazar, a guy from Tuguegarao, Cagayan, left Malicboy on start the WWII, carrying the image of Sta. Ana. === 1926 === A strong storm hit the village in 1926 and destroyed the Ermita. === World War II === In 1937, before World War II, the elected Barrio Captain: Vicente Batilo, together with his constituents, built a new ermita on top of a hill owned by Severina Luna (mother of the Ayala clan) to make it nearer to the community. The land is now owned by the Lukang family. People started building new houses around the then newly constructed train station. A contest in the barrio was conducted, and was used as fund raising to build the Hermitage. One of the candidates was Mrs. Carmen Abrigo. There are no other images in the new Ermita but the Holy cross. Consequently, the Hermitage was adorned by flowers made of paper, there was always a reminder: \"ito ay \"Simbahan\", Hindi sayawan\"(this is \"Church\", not a place for dancing). Fr. Francisco Ayala, priest from Pagbilao, presided over the masses held there. He was assignment in Macalelon, but returned to Pagbilao because of the war. During these times, Ana hired an artist from Lucban, Lucilo Empamano, who decorated the ermita every year during the fiesta, to adorn the Hermitage. He made an image of patroness by dressing a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, before it was called Mediatrix of All Graces, in a red cloth. \u201cSi Lucilo Empamano ay taga Lucban, walang asawa, at medyo malambot kung kumilos, siya ay isang pintor.\u201d -Interview with Vicente & Natalia Ayala (February 20, 2007) The image of Sta. Ana was clothed by Ana Castro every feast. It is clothed in a White cloth with a Blue cape. (according to Carmen Abprigo). Because of the WWII, the vicinity of the Ermita was used as a Cemetery. 13-17 are known to be buried here currently, yet, only 6 were named. They are: Arcelita Ayala, Amando (Andoy) Florantes, Jesus de Espiritu Santo, Simfro Batilo, Eleonor Catausan and Rodencio Catausan. Until such time that the structure was destroyed by termites, Malicboy had no permanent church. For quite a long time, the yearly mass celebrations was held under a temporary bamboo frame erected wherever they could arrange for space. === Angel Glorioso and the New Ermita === Another Ermita was built in land of Marquez (Sitio Magsaysay). Fr. Diogracias Medrano precided the masses held there. But it was again damaged only after a year. Later, on a lot inherited by Angel Glorioso from his father Enrique, a new wooden ermita with tin roof was built. This area used to be situated behind the houses and a warehouse owned by a Chinese businessman. In 1948, in Lipa, Batangas, the Blessed Virgin Mary was announced as the Mediatrix of All Graces. === Single St. Anne Image === The couple Angel and Canding (Catapat) went on to have the ermita built. The structure was made sturdy with wooden walls. In April of that year, a stranger had his car broke down near the railroad crossing which is near the couple's house. The occupants are from Pampanga and were selling Christ the King images. The strangers stayed in the couple's house for the night. By next day, an order was placed for an image of St. Anne based on the picture left behind by Ana Castro-Martinez. In May of that year, the new image was delivered. The image did not have an infant Mary yet because the picture on which it was based from could be representing the time that St. Anne is still single. With the image of St. Anne, the people were inspired to improve the ermita. Many contributed wooden planks for the walls.
