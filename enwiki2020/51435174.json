Neither the base nor the top of the formation is known. Copious dykes of basic composition and aphanitic texture intrude the formation. At some locations Miocene plutons of the North Patagonian Batholith intrude the Traigu\u00e9n Formation. The intruded plutons are of varied composition including gabbro and granodiorite. == See also == * * == References == Category:Geologic formations of Chile Category:Miocene Series of South America Category:Neogene Chile Category:Tuff formations Category:Geology of Ays\u00e9n Region ",
