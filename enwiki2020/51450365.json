In prato quondam rana conspexit bovem, et tacta invidia tantae magnitudinis rugosam inflavit pellem. Tum natos suos interrogavit an bove esset latior. Illi negarunt.

An Ox the Frog a-grazing view\u2019d, And envying his magnitude, She puffs her wrinkled skin, and tries To vie with his enormous size: Then asks her young to own at least That she was bigger than the beast. They answer, No. With might and main She swells and strains, and swells again. \u201cNow for it, who has got the day?\u201d The Ox is larger still, they say. At length, with more and more ado, She raged and puffed, and burst in two.Phaedrus, The Fables of Ph\u00e6drus literally translated into English prose with notes, Christopher Smart and Henry Thomas Riley (transl.). Accessed 29 Aug. 2016. | The needy man, while affecting to imitate the powerful, comes to ruin. Once on a time, a Frog espied an Ox in a meadow, and moved with envy at his vast bulk, puffed out her wrinkled skin, and then asked her young ones whether she was bigger than the Ox. They said: \u201cNo.\u201d Again, with still greater efforts, she distended her skin, and in like manner enquired which was the bigger. They said: \u201cThe Ox.\u201d At last \u2014 while, full of indignation, she tried, with all her might, to puff herself out \u2014 she burst her body on the spot. | The fable teaches that one should not pretend to be something that he is not in reality. It appeals to us to be satisfied with what we have and not to yield to envy or to covet what others have more of. Though the fable addresses a concern over lack of bodily size, it can readily be extended to a concern over lack of wealth or power. Maxims like \u201cpuffed up like a frog\u201d, \u201cinflated sense of self- importance\u201d or \u201cbursting with envy\u201d derive from this fable.Georg B\u00fcchmann and Walter Robert-Tornow, Gefl\u00fcgelte Worte: Der Citatenschatz des deutschen Volkes, Berlin, 1898.
