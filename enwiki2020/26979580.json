In seminal papers that advanced strong methodological positions and set an agenda for subsequent research, Clower formalized and reformulated: * Keynesian theory as disequilibrium analysis in contrast to standard general equilibrium theory, thereby generalizing (or rejecting) Walras' law and standard price theory. To this end, he proposed the 'dual- decision hypothesis' in which realized transaction quantities affect adjustments in output at other than full-employment equilibrium but not at full-employment equilibrium. This, he argued, was implicit in Keynes's work to explain how full-employment equilibrium is only a special case. Such quantity constraints introduce nonlinearities that complicate dynamic stability of the economic system as to full-employment equilibrium and require a distinction between notional and effective demand.\u2022 Robert W.

Hicks and received a B.Litt. degree in 1952.The Bachelor of Letters degree at Oxford was retitled Master of Letters in 1978.
