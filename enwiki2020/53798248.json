    "text": "Mel Bernstein (born 1945; nicknamed \"Dragon Man\") is the owner of Dragon Arms and a military museum in Colorado Springs, Colorado. ==Early life== Bernstein was born in Brooklyn, New York to a Jewish family. After dropping out of high school, he was drafted into the Vietnam-era Army and worked on and fired quad- mounted anti-aircraft guns at Fort Bliss; after serving two years in the military and acquiring over 100 tattoos, Bernstein started a motorcycle repair shop, where he built a custom 1966 Harley Davidson forming a dragon's wings and head with metal and fiberglass, and later modified the dragon's head so the eyes would light up and its snout would shoot fire; Bernstein claims it was the locals who saw him ride the custom dragon Harley, that gave him the nickname \"Dragon Man\". ==Career== Since 1982, after moving from Huntington, Long Island, NY to Colorado, Bernstein has run a mail-order motorcycle parts business, gun store, gun range, paintball park and military museum, on 260 remote acres he owns called \"Dragon Land\". Billing himself as the \"most armed man in America,\" Bernstein has weapons and equipment on display from the Civil War to Afghanistan, including M1 Garands, .50-caliber machine guns, over 80 military-grade vehicles, a functional 40 ton T54 Russian tank, six 1000-pound bombs; medieval Japanese swords captured by U.S. troops in World War II and over 900 mannequins dressed in military uniforms. Bernstein states that some of his military weapons are so big that he cannot shoot them. Bernstein is a Class III firearms dealer and values his collection of military memorabilia at ten million dollars. ==Discovery Channel accident== On June 14, 2012 Bernstein's wife and business manager Terry Flanell, was accidentally killed during the filming of a promotional piece for a new Discovery Channel reality show featuring Bernstein and his crew, called \"Dragon Land\". Flanell was struck by two smoke bombs travelling at 150 mph during a special-effects smoke scene. Bernstein and a family member filed a wrongful death suit in Federal court against Discovery Channel parent Discovery Communications and Anthropic Productions Corp. The case was later dropped. == References == ==External links== * Video tour of military museum Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:American collectors Category:American Jews Category:Militaria Category:People from Brooklyn Category:Tourism in Colorado Springs, Colorado Category:United States Army soldiers Category:People from Huntington, New York ",
