    "text": "Letters in the Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift The Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift (VA, meaning \"simplified written script\") is a simplified form of handwriting primarily based on the Lateinische Ausgangsschrift. It was developed in 1969 and tested since 1972. The letters has been simplified and the shapes approximated the block letters. As of 2017, the Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift is mandatory in Saxony-Anhalt. In another 10 of the 16 German federal states, it is available for schools to choose from, among other cursives. == Overview == The difficulties in learning the Latin script developed from the \"Deutschen Normalschrift\" prompted the development of a standardised cursive. The Vereinfachten Ausgangsschrift was intended to correct inconsistencies in the Latin source script and to develop a script that was easier to learn. The Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift is primarily based on the Lateinische Ausgangsschrift and is also based on the Druckschrift (DS). During development, attention should be paid to a consistent and logical flow of writing, the analogy to the printed text, a light motor implementation and the avoidance of unnecessary decorative elements. == Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift compared to the Lateinische Ausgangsschrift == In the Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift, almost all lowercase letters begin and end on the upper middle band. 116x116px This is very important for the flow of writing, since so-called \"breakpoints\" are always \"starting points\" for the letters. In the original Latin script, connecting the letters is considered to be easier in terms of typing, but more difficult to learn because there are four different options. With the simplified initial script, almost all lowercase letters begin and end at the same place. The letters are therefore standardized in the simplified initial script. In the Latin source script, there are several letter combinations for the same letter. (Example: Latin source script above, simplified source script below). The simplified source font disrupts the flow of writing through \u201cjerky\u201d transitions, but enables textbook publishers to use a standardized printing set instead of costly handwritten sample texts.http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/bildung/artikel/1/keine-paedagogischen- interessen/ Example of a couple Latin phrases The striking feature of the simplified initial font is the \u201cspread\u201d (or \u201csheet\u201d, e.g. \u201cb\u201d), which, when put together, only occurs with the last letter of the word. However, this \u201cspread\u201d is an integral part of each letter, as it is intended to enable a fluid, uniform connection of the letters. As the letter is the small \"z\" with sub-loop emphasize that in this form has a centuries-old tradition in the writing, Kurrent- and Fraktur has. The capital letters of the Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift differ from the Lateinische Ausgangsschrift. The publication was taken into account because the students learn it first. frameless == References == == External links == * Universit\u00e4t Essen: Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift \u2013 Pro & Contra (PDF; in German) * Kostenloser Downloader der Open-Source-Schriftart (OTF-Font; in German) * Das Original: Kostenloser Download Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift, unliniert (TT-Font; in German) * Die Zeit, 24 March 2011: Schreibschrift: Mit Schwung, aber lesbar!
