This was followed up with Starstrike 3D, a game based on Atari's Star Wars arcade game. Carrier Command was published in 1988. The company was also involved in porting Elite to IBM PC compatibles and Starglider to the ZX Spectrum. Realtime's early titles were self-published. Later games were published by Rainbird.
