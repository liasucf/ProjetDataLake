The church is the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rhodes. On September 20, 1936 the first stone was laid in the presence of Archbishop Giovanni Castellani and Italian Governor Mario Lago. The works for the construction of the church, designed by architect Armando Bernabiti, ended in 1939. In 1940 the church was equipped with an organ and enriched with 14 terracotta bas-reliefs depicting the Stations of the Cross, the sculptor Monteleone. The frescoes on the walls of the choir were painted by Pietro Gaudenzi. On the ceiling above the central altar, a cross rises, around which symbols of the four evangelists are arranged symmetrically. Gaudenzi also are the paintings on the side altars representing, respectively, the Annunciation and St. Maurice. ==See also== *Roman Catholicism in Greece *St. Francis of Assisi ==References== Night view of the church Francis of Assisi Category:Buildings and structures in Rhodes Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1939 ",
