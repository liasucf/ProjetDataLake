Work on the Songjeongni\u2013Damyang section began in April 1921, and was opened to traffic on 1 July 1922 as the Jeonnam Line; the month prior, work had begun on the Masan\u2013Jinju section, which was later opened as the Gyeongnam Line. On 1 September 1923, the Ch\u014dsen Southern Railway merged with five other privately owned railways to create the Ch\u014dsen Railway.Establishment of the Chosen Railway, Dong-A Ilbo, 3 September 1923 (in Korean) Work to build the Damyang\u2013Jinju section was never completed, and on 31 October 1944, the Gwangju\u2013Damyang section was dismantled. After the end of the Pacific War and the nationalisation of Korea's railways, the Korean National Railroad divided the Jeonnam Line, making the Gwangju\u2013Seongjeongni section part of the Gwangju Line, and after completing the Songjeong\u2013Jinju section, merging that into the Gyeongjeon Line. ==Route== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\" |- |+\u5168\u5357\u7dda - \uc804\ub0a8\uc120 - Zen'nan Line - Jeonnam Line |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Distance !! colspan=\"4\" | Station name !! colspan=\"3\" | |- !
