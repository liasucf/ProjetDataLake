She was launched on 1 June 1943, before being transferred to the FNFL and entering Free French naval service on 3 March 1944. During her service in World War II, L'Escarmouche was primarily occupied with escorting transports and supply ships in the English Channel. In June 1944 she served as an escort for American transports heading for Utah and Omaha Beach on D-Day. L'Escarmouche was escorting the landing ship when the latter was sunk by either an undersea mine or a submarine-launched torpedo on 28 December 1944. The frigate assisted in rescuing survivors from Empire Javelin, but failed to find an attacker after conducting a sweep for a U-boat. Following the end of the war, L'Escarmouche remained in the service of the newly formed French Fourth Republic. She was decommissioned in 1960. == References == Category:River- class frigates Category:Free French Naval Forces Category:1943 ships ",
