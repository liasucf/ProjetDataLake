Commenced on 23 September and concluding on 29 September 1971, it was one of the first tours of Japan by a western rock band.Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press. , pp. 68-70. \"It was the first time I'd been to such a sort of overpopulated place\u2026\" recalled guitarist Jimmy Page of Tokyo, where the tour began. \"It was a city with such a new vision towards the future. The technology boom was really going on, even then\u2026 It seems odd now with Nikon everywhere, but at the time they were just really breaking the market, and you could get cameras over here really, really inexpensively, and hi-fi and little cine cameras\u2026 We came here and went away loaded with cameras and I started documenting the rest of my travels with Led Zeppelin for a bit.\" One of the concerts from the short tour, at Hiroshima on 27 September,Led Zeppelin official website: concert summary was a benefit show.
