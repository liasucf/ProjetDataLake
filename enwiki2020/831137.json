    "text": "There were 130 parliamentary by-elections in the United Kingdom between the 1979 and 2010 general elections. In the list below, the names of the incumbent and victor and their respective parties are given. Where seats changed political party at the election, the result is highlighted: blue for a Conservative gain, red for a Labour gain, yellow for a Scottish National Party (SNP) gain, orange for a Liberal, Social Democratic Party (SDP) or Liberal Democrat gain and grey for any other gain. ==Resignations== Where the cause of by-election is given as \"resignation\" or \"seeks re-election\", this indicates that the incumbent was appointed on his or her own request to an \"office of profit under the Crown\", either the Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds or the Steward of the Manor of Northstead. Accepting an office of profit under the Crown vacates the member's seat. This process is used because members of the House of Commons are not technically permitted to resign. A member who resigns in this manner may stand for re-election. ==By-elections== ===2005\u20132010 Parliament=== There were 14 by-elections in the 2005\u20132010 Parliament. Eight were in seats held by the governing Labour party, three by the Conservatives, one by the Liberal Democrats, one by an independent and one by the speaker. Eight by-elections were won by the incumbent party, including in Haltemprice and Howden where Conservative David Davis resigned to recontest his seat. Meanwhile, Blaenau Gwent was won by a second independent candidate. Labour lost four seats; two to the Conservatives, one to the Liberal Democrats and one to the SNP. The speaker's seat was regained by Labour, the party speaker Michael Martin represented before he took up the position. Eight by-elections were a result of the death of the incumbent MP - five Labour MPs died, along with one Liberal Democrat, one Conservative and independent MP Peter Law. At the dissolution of Parliament in 2010 there were three vacancies: North West Leicestershire and Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, caused by the death of their respective Labour members David Taylor and Ashok Kumar; and Strangford caused by the resignation of the DUP's Iris Robinson. With the close proximity of the 2010 general election, by-elections were not held in these seats. Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland and Strangford were held by Tom Blenkinsop and Jim Shannon respectively, but North West Leicestershire was won by Conservative Andrew Bridgen. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | By-election !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Date !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px;\" | Incumbent !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" colspan=2 | Party !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px;\" | Winner !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" colspan=2 | Party !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 500px;\" | Cause |- |Glasgow North EastGain retained at the 2010 general election. |12 November 2009 |Michael Martin Michael Martin had originally been elected as a Labour MP. |Willie Bain |Resignation |- bgcolor=lightblue |Norwich North |23 July 2009 |Ian Gibson |Chloe Smith |Resignation |- |Glenrothes |6 November 2008 |John MacDougall |Lindsay Roy |Death (mesothelioma) |- bgcolor=FFFF66 |Glasgow EastGain not retained at the 2010 general election. |24 July 2008 |David Marshall |John Mason | Resignation due to ill health |- |Haltemprice and Howden |10 July 2008 |David Davis |David Davis |Resigned to recontest |- |Henley |26 June 2008 |Boris Johnson |John Howell |Election as Mayor of London |- |- bgcolor=lightblue |Crewe and Nantwich |22 May 2008 |Gwyneth Dunwoody |Edward Timpson |Death (heart attack) |- |Sedgefield |19 July 2007 |Tony Blair |Phil Wilson |Resignation on appointment as Middle East Envoy |- |Ealing Southall |19 July 2007 |Piara Khabra |Virendra Sharma |Death (liver problems) |- |Bromley and Chislehurst |29 June 2006 |Eric Forth |Bob Neill |Death (cancer) |- |Blaenau Gwent |29 June 2006 |Peter Law |Dai Davies |Death (cancer) |- |- bgcolor=ffcc66 |Dunfermline and West Fife |9 February 2006 |Rachel Squire |Willie Rennie |Death (cancer/stroke) |- |Livingston |29 September 2005 |Robin Cook |Jim Devine |Death (heart disease) |- |Cheadle |14 July 2005 |Patsy Calton |Mark Hunter |Death (cancer) |} ===2001\u20132005 Parliament=== There were six by- elections in the 2001\u20132005 Parliament.
