    "text": "Gott ist mein K\u00f6nig, BWV 71 (1708). Compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach printed during his lifetime (1685\u20131750) include works for keyboard instruments, such as his Clavier-\u00dcbung volumes for harpsichord and for organ, and to a lesser extent ensemble music, such as the trio sonata of The Musical Offering, and vocal music, such as a cantata published early in his career. Other works, such as several canons, were printed without an indication by which instruments they were to be performed. No more than a few works by Johann Sebastian Bach were printed during his lifetime. Extended works for choir and instrumentalists were not printed very often in his day. Bach selected mostly keyboard compositions for publication, which conformed to such contemporary practices, and was instrumental in establishing him as a keyboard composer. His works not only circulated in print: also manuscripts were copied and transmitted. Whether or not a work was selected for print was independent of the quality of the music. ==Context== Whereas earlier composers such as Palestrina, Monteverdi, Praetorius and Sch\u00fctz had their works printed to ensure that the entire range of their music became more widely known, this was not the case with Bach, who only had a small proportion of his works printed. Christoph Wolff has suggested three reasons: firstly the financial support from municipal councils or noble patrons available to previous generations had diminished in Germany as a result of the Thirty Years War; secondly the expense of printing contrapuntal keyboard music which, at that time in Germany, was more often typeset than engraved; and lastly the low number of potential customers for works that were often technically difficult and unconventional. Counting by BWV numbers, less than ten percent of the composer's output was printed during his lifetime. Especially the choral works, less than half a percent of over 400 BWV numbers, are under- represented. This was however not exceptional for Bach's time when larger works for chorus and orchestra were less often printed. Bach's own efforts to get his works printed concentrated mostly on his keyboard compositions, which contributed to the fact that, at least until the 19th-century Bach Revival, he was mainly regarded as a keyboard composer. Whether or not a work was selected for print was independent of the quality of the music. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach printed during his lifetime |- ! scope=\"col\" | BWV ! scope=\"col\" | Work ! scope=\"col\" | Print |- | 71 | Council election cantata Gott ist mein K\u00f6nig | 1708 |- | 439\u2013507 | songs and arias in Schemellis Gesangbuch | 1736 |- | 552 | Prelude and Fugue in E for organ in Clavier-\u00dcbung III | 1739 |- | 645\u2013650 | chorale preludes for organ (Sch\u00fcbler Chorales) | 1747\u20131748 |- | 669\u2013689 | chorale preludes for organ in Clavier-\u00dcbung III | 1739 |- | 769 | Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch\" for organ | 1747\u20131748 |- | 802\u2013805 | duets for keyboard instrument in Clavier- \u00dcbung III | 1739 |- | 825\u2013830 | partitas for harpsichord in Clavier-\u00dcbung I | 1726\u20131730, 1731 |- | 831 | French Overture for harpsichord in Clavier-\u00dcbung II | 1735 |- | 971 | Italian Concerto for harpsichord in Clavier-\u00dcbung II | 1735 |- | 988 | Goldberg Variations for harpsichord (Clavier-\u00dcbung IV) | 1741\u20131742 |- | 1074 | Canon a 4 | 1728, 1739, 1747 |- | 1076 | Canon triplex a 6 | 1747 |- | 1079 | The Musical Offering for diverse instruments | 1747\u20131749 |- | 1080 | The Art of Fugue | 1751, 1752 |- | 1138.1 | Council election cantata for M\u00fchlhausen #2 (lost) | 1709 |- | 1138.2 | Council election cantata for M\u00fchlhausen #3 (lost) | 1710 |} Most of the prints of Bach's music which appeared during his lifetime were commissioned by the composer. Bach's personal copies, often containing handwritten corrections or additions, have been recovered for several of his printed works. The German expression for personal copy, , also appears in English-language Bach-scholarship, and is used in the list below when referring to prints once contained in the personal library of Johann Sebastian Bach. During Bach's lifetime his compositions were mostly distributed amongst his immediate musical associates through manuscript copies. After his death in 1750, manuscript copies of keyboard and vocal works were made by professional copyists and distributed by musical publishing firms, especially Breitkopf (Leipzig), Traeg (Vienna) and Westphal (Hamburg). This in turn led to the appearance of printed editions of his works, beginning with the publication of Bach's four-part chorales in the second half of the eighteenth century. The fact that Bach had published representative samples of his music for keyboard instruments contributed to his fame, and to an increased demand for such works after his death. In his 1732 , Johann Gottfried Walther listed all keyboard compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach which had been printed up to that point, that is, the six partitas of Clavier- \u00dcbung I. In Bach's obituary, which was published four years after the composer's death, printed and unprinted works are listed separately: the list of engraved compositions contains eight items, all of them instrumental works, and concludes with The Art of Fugue, which had been printed shortly after the composer's death. A comparable list, starting with the same eight items, appeared half a century later in Johann Nikolaus Forkel's Bach-biography. In 1937 Georg Kinsky published an extensive study of Bach's original publications. ==Printed music== The eight publications listed in Bach's obituary included The Art of Fugue which was in fact published shortly after the composer's death. Further, two publications with vocal music and two canons are extant. ===M\u00fchlhausen council election cantatas=== Gott ist mein K\u00f6nig, BWV 71, Bach's council election (Ratswahl) cantata composed for M\u00fchlhausen in 1708, was printed that same year at the expense of the town council. Also in 1709 and 1710 Bach wrote the council election cantatas for M\u00fchlhausen, which likewise would have been printed. These cantatas, BWV 1138.1 and 1138.2, are however lost: neither a print nor a manuscript survives. ; Publication : The M\u00fchlhausen council commissioned the publication of the cantatas. The parts and libretto of the Gott ist mein K\u00f6nig cantata, printed in M\u00fchlhausen in 1708, are extant. ; : Mus. 11495 of the Berlin State Library, one of the surviving prints of the BWV 71 cantata, has a handwritten note by Bach on the front page. ===Clavier-\u00dcbung I=== Title page of the 1726 edition of BWV 825, the first of six partitas that would be grouped into in 1731 Bach's Six Partitas, BWV 825\u2013830, for harpsichord, were published in instalments from 1726 to 1730: #Autumn 1726: Partita No. 1 in B-flat major, BWV 825\\. #Easter 1727: Partita No. 2 in C minor, BWV 826\\. #Michaelmas 1727: Partita No. 3 in A minor, BWV 827\\. #1728: Partita No. 4 in D major, BWV 828\\. #1730: Partita No. 5 in G major, BWV 829\\. #1730: Partita No. 6 in E minor, BWV 830.Lost source: original print of BWV 830 at Bach Digital website. In 1731 these partitas were collectively published as Clavier-\u00dcbung (\"Keyboard Exercise\"). ;Publication : According to an announcement published in May 1730, it was originally planned to publish seven suites. ; : In 1774 Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, son of Johann Sebastian, sold a print of from his father's personal library to Johann Nikolaus Forkel. In 2008 Andrew Talle identified of the Austrian National Library as the that changed hands in 1774. Previously, Bach scholars had (tentatively) identified Bach's of as either of the Music Division of the Library of Congress (e.g. Peter Wollny in 1996) or of the British Library (e.g. Walter Emery in 1952, and Richard D. P. Jones in 1978, 1988 and 1997). ===Canon a 4=== Bach's \"Canon mit 4\" (canon for four voices), BWV 1074, was published in Georg Philipp Telemann's in 1728.D-LEm Becker III.13.86 at Bach Digital website. This canon was also published with two solutions in Johann Mattheson's Der vollkommene Capellmeister in 1739, and with three solutions in Volume 3 of Lorenz Christoph Mizler's in 1747. ===Clavier-\u00dcbung II=== The second volume of the Clavier-\u00dcbung was first published in 1735,Original print of Clavier-\u00dcbung II (BWV 971 and 831), 1st printing at Bach Digital website. soon followed by a reprint with several corrections.Original print of Clavier-\u00dcbung II (BWV 971 and 831), 2nd printing at Bach Digital website. It contained two compositions, specified for performance on a two-manual harpsichord: * Concerto nach Italienischen Gusto (Italian Concerto), BWV 971 * Ouvert\u00fcre nach Franz\u00f6sischer Art (French Overture), BWV 831 Komm, s\u00fc\u00dfer Tod\", BWV 478, No. 868 in Schemelli's Musicalisches Gesang-Buch ; Publication : Clavier-\u00dcbung II was printed in N\u00fcrnberg by Christoph Weigel. In the second printing pages 20 to 22 were replaced by new engravings. ; : K.8.g.7 from the British Library was Bach's : it is a copy from the first print run with more than hundred corrections in Bach's hand.GB-Lbl K.8.g.7 at Bach Digital website ===Spiritual songs and arias from Schemelli's Musicalisches Gesang-Buch=== Georg Christian Schemelli's Musicalisches Gesang-Buch (musical songbook) contains 954 song texts, 69 of which, BWV 439\u2013507, are printed with a setting for singing voice and thoroughbass. Not all 69 melodies were composed by Bach, but he provided (or \"improved\") an accompaniment for all of them. Schemellis Gesangbuch was published in 1736, and contains some of Bach's probably least known compositions.Brilliant Classics, CD No. 99361/5 and 99361/6 (CD 14 and 15 from \"Bach Edition\") ===Clavier-\u00dcbung III=== Title page of Clavier-\u00dcbung III For organ, containing: * Prelude in E-flat major, BWV 552/i * German Kyrie and Gloria settings, BWV 669\u2013677 * Catechism chorales, BWV 678\u2013689 * Four duets, BWV 802\u2013805 * Fugue E-flat major, BWV 552/ii The Prelude and Fugue were published separately as a pair by C. F. Peters in 1845 in Volume III of the Organ Works of J. S. Bach, with the fugue listed in the contents as the \"St Annen-Fuge\".Recorded as in the Bach Archive. ===Clavier-\u00dcbung IV=== In 1741 or 1742 another Clavier-\u00dcbung volume was published, the Aria with diverse variations for double manual harpsichord, later known as the Goldberg Variations, BWV 988\\. Not thus numbered in the print it was the fourth Clavier-\u00dcbung publication. This publication does not carry a reference to Johann Gottlieb Goldberg: the music was published over half a century before the perhaps exaggerated anecdote involving Goldberg was printed in Forkel's biography of Bach. ;Publication : The work was published by Balthasar Schmid in N\u00fcrnberg. ; : Ms. 17669 is at the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France (BnF). It contains corrections by Bach as well as the autograph manuscript of the canons BWV 1087.Work at Bach Digital website ===Canon triplex a 6=== The Canon triplex a 6, BWV 1076, which had appeared on Elias Gottlob Haussmann's portrait of Bach in 1746, was printed in 1747. ===Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\"=== Autograph manuscript of second version of first Canonic Variation The Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\", BWV 769, for organ, were published on the occasion of Bach's admission to Mizler's \"Society of the Musical Sciences\" in 1747. ===Musikalisches Opfer=== The Musical Offering, BWV 1079, was published in 1747, after Bach's visit to Frederick the Great in Potsdam. The work contains a trio sonata for flute, violin and continuo.Work at Bach Digital website. ===Sch\u00fcbler Chorales=== The Sch\u00fcbler Chorales, BWV 645\u2013650, is a set of chorale preludes for organ, published around 1748 as Sechs Chorale von verschiedener Art (Six Chorales of Various Kinds) by Johann Georg Sch\u00fcbler. ;Publication : There is some doubt whether Bach commissioned the publication, which mainly, perhaps even exclusively, consists of arrangements of cantata movements which he had composed a few decades earlier. The work was published in Zella Melsi, and the engraver apparently prepared the print unsupervised by the composer. It is likely that Bach at least chose the six pieces, determined their sequence in the publication, and gave some instruction on how they were to be arranged. ; : Bach's is part of the Scheide Library at Princeton University Library. It contains several corrections by Bach, but misses the title page and the first page of music. ===Kunst der Fuge=== In preparation for print when the composer died (1750): The Art of Fugue, BWV 1080. The printed versions (1751 and 1752) contain BWV 668a, a variant of the chorale prelude \"Wenn wir in h\u00f6chsten N\u00f6ten sein\", BWV 668\\. ==Further reading== * ==References== ==Sources== ===Music prints=== * * * * * * * * * * . \u2013 facsimiles: MS-17669 at Gallica (, ); D-LEb Peters PM 1400 at Bach Digital website; Kenny 548 at Baldwin Wallace University. * * * * * * * * * . \u2013 facsimiles: VM7-3878 at Gallica (); Mus.2392.B.1 at SLUB; M B/4987 at . ===Other=== * * * * * * * * * * * * * Printed during his lifetime, List of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach ",
