It was created on 11 August 1838 for Charles Stuart-Menteth. The third baronet was a naturalised American. The Menteths descend from ancient Earls or Mormaers of Menteith, and more specifically from the marriage in 1260 of Mary, Countess of Menteth with Walter Bailloch Stewart, son of Walter Stewart, 3rd High Steward of Scotland. The Stuart name was not adopted until 1770, when the first baronet's father, Rev. James Meneth, adopted the name and arms from his cousin Charles Stuart in order to inherit his estates. ==Stuart-Menteth baronets, of Closeburn and Mansfield (1838)== *Sir Charles Granvill Stuart- Menteth, 1st Baronet (1769\u20131847) *Sir James Stuart-Menteth, 2nd Baronet (1792\u20131870) *( Sir ) James Stuart-Menteth ( 3rd Baronet), (1841\u20131918) *Sir James Frederick Stuart-Menteth, 4th Baronet (1846\u20131926) *Sir William Frederick Stuart-Menteth, 5th Baronet (1874\u20131952) *Sir James Wallace Stuart-Menteth, 6th Baronet (1922\u20132008) *Sir Charles Greaves Stuart-Menteth, 7th Baronet (born 1950) The heir presumptive is the present holder's brother William Jeremy Stuart-Menteth (born 1953).
