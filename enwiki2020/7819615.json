    "text": "Luis Alberto Su\u00e1rez D\u00edaz (; born 24 January 1987) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a striker for Spanish club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and the Uruguay national team. Often regarded as one of the best players in the world, and as one of the greatest strikers of his generation, Su\u00e1rez has won 18 trophies in his career, which include six league titles, a UEFA Champions League title at club level, and a Copa Am\u00e9rica with Uruguay. A prolific goalscorer, Su\u00e1rez has won two European Golden Shoes, an Eredivisie Golden Boot, a Premier League Golden Boot, also ending the six-year dominance of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo by winning La Liga's Pichichi Trophy in 2016. He has scored 488 career goals for club and country. Nicknamed El Pistolero (meaning 'The Gunman'), Su\u00e1rez began his career as a youth player for Nacional in 2003. At age 19, he relocated to the Netherlands to play for Groningen, before transferring to Ajax in 2007. He won his first trophy in 2010, the KNVB Cup, finishing the season as the league's top scorer and was named Dutch Footballer of the Year. A year later, he helped Ajax secure the Eredivisie title, and scored his 100th Ajax goal. In January 2011, Su\u00e1rez transferred to Liverpool, and won the League Cup in his first full season. In 2014, he was named the PFA Players' Player of the Year and the FWA Footballer of the Year as well as winning the Premier League Golden Boot, and sharing the European Golden Shoe with Cristiano Ronaldo. Liverpool led the league with three games to go, but narrowly lost out to Manchester City. In the summer of 2014, Su\u00e1rez moved to Barcelona in a transfer worth \u20ac82.3 million (\u00a364.98 million), making him one of the most expensive players in football history. In his first season at Barcelona, Su\u00e1rez starred in an attacking trio alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, helping the club win a historic second continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League. Messi, Su\u00e1rez, Neymar (dubbed MSN), scored a total of 122 goals that season, the most for an attacking front three in Spanish football history. In his second season at the club, Su\u00e1rez won his first Pichichi Trophy as well as his second European Golden Shoe, for which he became the first player since 2009 to win both awards other than Messi or Ronaldo. He ended the season with a total of 40 league goals, 14 of which came in his last five matches, and 16 assists, becoming the first player in history to top La Liga in both goals and assists. At international level, Su\u00e1rez is Uruguay's all-time leading goalscorer, and has represented his nation at three editions of the FIFA World Cup and three editions of the Copa Am\u00e9rica, as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics, and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, where he helped his team to a fourth-place finish. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup he played an important role in Uruguay's fourth-place finish, scoring three goals, as well as controversially blocking an otherwise game-winning goal-bound extra time header with his hands during the quarter-final against Ghana. At the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica, Su\u00e1rez scored four goals as Uruguay won a record fifteenth Copa Am\u00e9rica, and he was named Player of the Tournament. At the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, Su\u00e1rez scored his 40th international goal before he was suspended from the tournament after biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini. Su\u00e1rez has been a source of controversy throughout his career. As well as his goal-line handball in the 2010 FIFA World Cup against Ghana, he has also bitten opponents on three occasions. He has also been accused of and admitted to diving, and in 2011, the FA found him guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra, a decision Su\u00e1rez disputes. ==Club career== ===Youth=== Su\u00e1rez lived his early years at the Cerro neighbourhood in Salto, where he played youth football at Sportivo Artigas.Su\u00e1rez Cap\u00edtulo 1: El \"Salta\", aquel pibe de barrio \u2013 Enrique Arrillaga / \u00c1ngel Asteggiante, El Pa\u00eds, 19 October 2014 At age seven, he moved with his family (parents and six brothers) to Montevideo, where he played youth football at Urreta. When he was a kid, a car ran over his foot, breaking the 5th metatarsal bone. In spite of the injury, he continued to play. ===Nacional=== Su\u00e1rez joined local side Nacional's youth team at age 14. At age 16, Su\u00e1rez headbutted a referee after showing his discontent following a red card, although a sports editor claimed he \"accidentally fell into the referee\". One night, he was caught drinking and partying, prompting his coach to threaten he would never play unless he started playing football more seriously. In May 2005, at age 18, Su\u00e1rez made his first-team debut against Atl\u00e9tico Junior in the Copa Libertadores. He scored his first goal in September 2005 and helped Nacional win the 2005\u201306 Uruguayan league with 10 goals in 27 matches. Su\u00e1rez was found by a group of scouts from the Dutch club Groningen when they were in Uruguay to scout another player. As they watched, he won and converted a penalty and scored a \"wonder goal\" against Defensor. After watching only that match, the scouts approached Su\u00e1rez and said they wanted to buy him, and after the season, Groningen paid Nacional \u20ac800,000 for him. Su\u00e1rez was thrilled to go to Europe because his then girlfriend, and now wife, Sof\u00eda Balbi, had moved to Barcelona; they had maintained a long-distance relationship for a year and he wanted to move closer to her. ===Groningen=== Su\u00e1rez on the training field of Groningen in 2006 Su\u00e1rez was 19 years old when he joined Groningen. Initially, Su\u00e1rez struggled because he could not speak Dutch or English, and he played on the second team to adjust to the Dutch game. His teammate and fellow Uruguayan, Bruno Silva, helped him settle into living in the Netherlands and playing for a new team. He worked hard to learn Dutch and his teammates respected him for his efforts with the language. Su\u00e1rez scored goals for Groningen, but he also had disciplinary problems; in one five-game stretch in January 2007, he scored four goals but received three yellow cards and one red card. Su\u00e1rez especially made his mark in a 4\u20133 home win over Vitesse, when with ten minutes to go he subsequently won a penalty and scored two goals. Su\u00e1rez ended with 10 goals in 29 league appearances to help Groningen finish eighth in the 2006\u201307 Eredivisie. He also scored in a 4\u20132 loss to Serbian club Partizan in his European debut on 14 September 2006. Ajax saw potential in Su\u00e1rez and offered Groningen \u20ac3.5 million for him, but Groningen rejected the offer. Su\u00e1rez was upset and brought his case to the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB)'s arbitration committee to try to facilitate the sale. The arbitration committee ruled against him on 9 August 2007, but that same day, Ajax increased their offer to \u20ac7.5 million and Groningen accepted. ===Ajax=== ====2007\u201309: Development and breakthrough==== Su\u00e1rez signed a five-year contract with Ajax and made his club debut in the UEFA Champions League qualifier against Slavia Prague. He scored one goal in his Eredivisie debut for the club and two goals in his home debut at the Amsterdam Arena. Ajax finished second in the league table in the 2007\u201308 season and Su\u00e1rez scored 17 goals in 33 league appearances, setting up a blossoming striking partnership with league top scorer Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. During the 2008\u201309 season, Ajax head coach Marco van Basten noted how Su\u00e1rez played an important role in many of Ajax's goals, but Van Basten was also upset by the number of yellow cards Su\u00e1rez received. Su\u00e1rez was suspended for one match because he was given his seventh yellow card of the season against Utrecht in a 2\u20130 win. He was also suspended after a half-time altercation with teammate Albert Luque over a free kick. Ajax ended the season in third place. Su\u00e1rez scored 22 goals in 31 league matches and finished second in scoring tables, one goal behind Mounir El Hamdaoui of AZ. Su\u00e1rez was also named Ajax Player of the Year. ====2009\u201310: League top goalscorer, Eredivisie winner==== pennant) as Ajax captain in 2010. Su\u00e1rez was named captain in the 2009\u201310 season. Before the 2009\u201310 season, Martin Jol replaced Van Basten as head coach. After the departure of Ajax captain Thomas Vermaelen to Arsenal, Jol named Su\u00e1rez team captain. Su\u00e1rez started scoring goals early in the season with a hat-trick in a 4\u20131 win against RKC Waalwijk. He had a number of multiple-goal matches throughout the season, including four in wins over Slovan Bratislava in the UEFA Europe League play-off round, VVV-Venlo and Roda JC. He scored three in the first half in another win over VVV-Venlo and six against WHC Wezep in the KNVB Cup as Ajax won by a club-record margin of 14\u20131. Su\u00e1rez scored two goals in the second leg of the KNVB Cup final and finished as the tournament's top scorer. Ajax won the Cup final 6\u20131 on aggregate over Feyenoord, but they finished second in the league behind Twente. Su\u00e1rez ended the season as the Eredivisie's top scorer with 35 goals in 33 matches, and had 49 goals in all competitions. He was named Ajax Player of the Year for the second straight year and Dutch Footballer of the Year. ====2010\u201311: First biting incident==== Su\u00e1rez playing for Ajax in a UEFA Champions League match against Dynamo Kyiv in 2010 Soon after Su\u00e1rez returned from his World Cup campaign, he scored his 100th goal for Ajax in a 1\u20131 home draw against PAOK in a UEFA Champions League qualifier. This put him in an elite group of players, including Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten and Dennis Bergkamp, to score 100 or more goals with the club. Su\u00e1rez continued his scoring run with a hat-trick against De Graafschap in a 5\u20130 win. On 20 November 2010, Su\u00e1rez bit PSV's Otman Bakkal on the shoulder during a 0\u20130 draw. Ajax suspended him for two matches and fined him an undisclosed amount, which the club said they would donate to a \"good cause\". The Dutch daily newspaper De Telegraaf branded Su\u00e1rez the \"Cannibal of Ajax\". The KNVB increased Su\u00e1rez's suspension to seven league matches. Su\u00e1rez apologised for his actions through a video he uploaded to his Facebook page. ===Liverpool=== ====Transfer==== During the suspension, Ajax were in contact with other European clubs interested in Su\u00e1rez. On 28 January 2011, they accepted a \u20ac26.5 million (\u00a322.8 million) offer for Su\u00e1rez from Premier League club Liverpool. Despite leaving while suspended, Su\u00e1rez departed Ajax on good terms, and he was given a farewell sendoff after an Ajax match. During the sendoff, an Ajax coach spoke to him and the crowd and said how the club wished he could stay longer; the crowd applauded their agreement and fireworks followed. Ajax ended the 2010\u201311 season as Eredivisie champions and Su\u00e1rez was given a winner's medal for his 7 goals in 13 appearances. On 31 January 2011, Su\u00e1rez signed a five-and-a-half-year deal with Liverpool until 2016, and was the club's most expensive signing (\u00a322.8 million) until the arrival of Andy Carroll (\u00a335 million) a few hours later. Su\u00e1rez requested the number seven shirt, which had been worn by Liverpool legends Kenny Dalglish, his new manager, Kevin Keegan, and Peter Beardsley ====2011\u201312: Early seasons==== Su\u00e1rez (left) was signed by Liverpool on the same day as Andy Carroll. Su\u00e1rez made his Liverpool debut on 2 February against Stoke City at Anfield in a 2\u20130 win; he came on as a substitute and scored Liverpool's second goal in front of the Kop in the 79th minute. He was one of Liverpool's best players during his partial season and helped Liverpool go from 12th in the league in mid-January to finish sixth. He finished the 2010\u201311 season with four goals in 13 games. After winning the Player of the Tournament at the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica, Su\u00e1rez had a disappointing 2011\u201312 season by his standards. Liverpool finished in eighth place and Su\u00e1rez scored 11 league goals. On 26 February, Liverpool won the League Cup, defeating Cardiff City in penalty shootout. On 28 April, Su\u00e1rez scored his first Liverpool hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win against Norwich City at Carrow Road. He finished sixth for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or. =====Racial abuse incident===== The season was marked by an incident in which Su\u00e1rez was found guilty by a three-man panel from The Football Association (FA) of racially abusing Patrice Evra during a match against Manchester United in October; he was issued an eight-match suspension and a \u00a340,000 fine. Su\u00e1rez disputed this decision. After a 1\u20131 draw against Manchester United on 15 October 2011, Su\u00e1rez was accused of racially abusing Evra, and the FA opened up an investigation into the incident. Su\u00e1rez wrote on his Twitter and Facebook pages that he was upset by the accusation and denied the claims. On 16 November, the FA announced it would charge Su\u00e1rez with \"abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour contrary to FA rules\", including \"a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Patrice Evra\". Liverpool later released a statement announcing Su\u00e1rez would plead innocent, adding they would \"remain fully supportive\" of him. On 20 December, the FA concluded a seven-day hearing, handing Su\u00e1rez an eight-match ban and a \u00a340,000 fine for racially abusing Evra. In their next meeting in February, during the pregame handshakes, Su\u00e1rez avoided shaking Evra's hand, for which Su\u00e1rez and Dalglish were later forced to apologise. Su\u00e1rez was also banned for one match for making an obscene gesture towards Fulham fans. ====2012\u201313: Return and individual success==== On 7 August 2012, Su\u00e1rez signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool. On 26 August, he scored his first goal of the 2012\u201313 season in a 2\u20132 draw with champions Manchester City at Anfield. On 29 September 2012, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick in Liverpool's Premier League fixture away at Norwich City for the second consecutive season. Su\u00e1rez playing for Liverpool against Arsenal in January 2013 On 6 January 2013, Su\u00e1rez handled the ball before scoring the decisive goal in Liverpool's 2\u20131 win over Mansfield Town from the Conference National in an FA Cup third round match. Liverpool's manager Brendan Rodgers defended his player by claiming \"it's not his job to own up\", while Mansfield manager Paul Cox said he felt \"a little bit gutted\" by the \"instinctive\" handball, but admitted he would have accepted a goal scored like that by one of his players. On 19 January, Su\u00e1rez scored his seventh goal in three matches against Norwich, as Liverpool cruised to a 5\u20130 home league victory. The following week, Su\u00e1rez captained Liverpool for the first time for the FA Cup fourth round match against Oldham Athletic; Liverpool lost 2\u20133. On 2 March, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat- trick against Wigan Athletic, leading Liverpool to a dominant 4\u20130 victory at the DW Stadium. In so doing, he became only the third Liverpool player to score 20 Premier League goals in a single season after Robbie Fowler and Fernando Torres. On 10 March, Su\u00e1rez scored his 50th goal in all competitions since joining the Reds by scoring the opener in a 3\u20132 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur, ending Spurs' 12-match unbeaten run. He was also named man of the match for his performance after he won the decisive penalty which Steven Gerrard converted. At the end of the season, Su\u00e1rez was one of six players named on the shortlist for PFA Players' Player of the Year. Su\u00e1rez finished second in the final ballot behind Gareth Bale of Tottenham and was named in the PFA Team of the Year. He was second-top goalscorer in the Premier League for 2012\u201313 with 23 goals and Liverpool's top scorer in all competitions with 30 goals. On 28 May 2013, he was named as Liverpool's player of the season after receiving 64% of votes in a poll of the club's supporters. Zenit Saint Petersburg, his second goal in a 3\u20131 win, March 2013 =====Second biting incident===== On 21 April 2013, during a 2\u20132 draw with Chelsea in a Premier League match at Anfield, Su\u00e1rez bit Branislav Ivanovi\u0107; this was the second time Su\u00e1rez had bitten an opponent. It was not noticed by the officials, and Su\u00e1rez scored an equaliser in injury time. The bite prompted UK Prime Minister David Cameron to call on the FA to take a hard line with Su\u00e1rez: the FA charged him with violent conduct and he was fined an undisclosed sum by his club. Contrary to claims from Su\u00e1rez, Ivanovi\u0107 did not accept an apology. Su\u00e1rez accepted the violent conduct charge but denied the FA's claim the standard punishment of three matches was clearly insufficient for his offence. A three-man independent panel appointed by the FA decided on a ten-game ban for Su\u00e1rez, who did not appeal the ban; the panel criticised Su\u00e1rez for not appreciating \"the seriousness\" of the incident when he argued against a long ban. The panel also wanted to send a \"strong message that such deplorable behaviours do not have a place in football\", while noting that \"all players in the higher level of the game are seen as role models, have the duty to act professionally and responsibly, and set the highest example of good conduct to the rest of the game \u2013 especially to young players\". On 31 May 2013, Su\u00e1rez said he would be seeking an exit from Liverpool in the summer, citing excessive media attention on his family as a reason for wanting to leave. On 6 August, after Liverpool had rejected a bid of \u00a340,000,001 for the player from Arsenal, Su\u00e1rez reiterated his wish to leave Liverpool and said Liverpool had previously promised to allow him a transfer if the club failed to qualify for the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League. The following day, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said Liverpool had not broken any promises to Su\u00e1rez and that the player had shown \"total disrespect\" for the club. After this incident, the British press reported that Su\u00e1rez had been instructed to train away from the Liverpool first-team squad by Rodgers. On 8 August, Liverpool owner John W. Henry stated that Su\u00e1rez would not be allowed to leave the club. ====2013\u201314: European Golden Shoe and departure==== On 14 August, Su\u00e1rez appeared to reverse his position about wanting to leave the club, with reports stating he wanted to stay at the club and that he was possibly going to sign a contract extension, citing the support from Liverpool supporters as the reason for his unexpected turnaround. Su\u00e1rez returned to first-team training two days later after \"offer[ing] contrition\" to his teammates but reportedly not apologising to his manager. On 25 September, Su\u00e1rez returned to the Liverpool team after his suspension to make his first appearance of the 2013\u201314 season in a League Cup third round tie against Manchester United at Old Trafford, losing 1\u20130. On 29 September, Su\u00e1rez made his first Premier League appearance of the season, scoring twice as Liverpool defeated Sunderland 3\u20131 at the Stadium of Light. On 5 October, Su\u00e1rez made his first appearance of the season at Anfield, where he scored Liverpool's opening goal in a 3\u20131 win against Crystal Palace. On 26 October, he scored his fourth Premier League hat-trick, his first at Anfield, in a 4\u20131 defeat of West Bromwich Albion. According to the BBC, he has scored a hat-trick every 20.3 Premier League matches, \"the best rate of all 46 players to have scored more than one treble\" in the top tier. On 4 December, Su\u00e1rez scored four goals against Norwich City in a 5\u20131 home win. He became the first player in Premier League history to score three hat-tricks against the same club, and took his scoring record against Norwich to 11 goals in 5 matches. On 15 December, Su\u00e1rez captained Liverpool for the first time in a Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur. He scored twice and assisted once as the team recorded a 5\u20130 win at White Hart Lane to close the gap on league leaders Arsenal to two points. The following day, Su\u00e1rez was named the Football Supporters' Federation Player of the Year for 2013. On 20 December, Su\u00e1rez signed a new four-and-a-half-year contract with Liverpool. On 1 January 2014, by scoring in a 2\u20130 home win over Hull City, Su\u00e1rez became the first Liverpool player to score 20 or more goals in successive Premier League seasons since Robbie Fowler in 1994\u201395 and 1995\u201396. He equalled Andy Cole's Premier League record for the earliest date to reach the 20-goal mark, but set a new record low of 15 matches. His strike partnership this season with Daniel Sturridge has earned them a nickname \"SAS\", i.e., Sturridge and Su\u00e1rez\". On 1 March, Su\u00e1rez made his 100th Premier League appearance, scoring in a 3\u20130 win over Southampton at St Mary's Stadium. In the following fixture, he scored his 25th league goal of the season as Liverpool defeated Manchester United at Old Trafford for the first time since 2009 by a convincing three-goal margin. On 22 March, Su\u00e1rez scored his sixth Premier League hat-trick, and third of the season, in a 6\u20133 win over Cardiff City at the Cardiff City Stadium. On 30 March, he broke Robbie Fowler's club record of 28 goals in a Premier League season in a 4\u20130 home win against Tottenham which took Liverpool top of the league with six matches remaining. On 20 April, he scored in a 3\u20132 win at Norwich to become the first Liverpool player to score 30 league goals in a season since Ian Rush in 1986\u201387. This also made him the seventh player to score 30 goals in a Premier League season, following Andy Cole, Alan Shearer, Kevin Phillips, Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo and Robin van Persie. On 18 April, Su\u00e1rez was named as one of the six players nominated for the PFA Player of the Year award for the second consecutive season. On 27 April, he won the award, becoming the first non- European to win the award. On 5 May 2014, Su\u00e1rez was named as the Football Association Writers Player of the Year. He finished the season with 31 goals in 33 matches, winning the Premier League Golden Boot, with Sturridge as runner-up, as Liverpool came second in the league and returned to the UEFA Champions League. Su\u00e1rez also won the Barclay's Premier League Player of the Season award. As the Premier League's top scorer with 31 goals, he also shared the European Golden Shoe with Cristiano Ronaldo. On 21 May 2014, Su\u00e1rez ranked number one on \"Europe's most influential player\" list of the year, ahead of Lionel Messi, Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 and Cristiano Ronaldo, according to a study by Bloomberg of the top five European leagues. ===Barcelona=== ====Signing and suspension==== Su\u00e1rez making his Barcelona debut against Club Le\u00f3n in August 2014. After serving his four-month suspension for biting at the 2014 World Cup he made his competitive debut for the club on 25 October. On 11 July 2014, Su\u00e1rez agreed with Barcelona on a five-year contract for an undisclosed transfer fee. However, according to a leaked document by Football Leaks, the fee was \u00a364.98 million (\u20ac82.3 million), making him one of the most expensive players in world football history. Bar\u00e7a confirmed Su\u00e1rez would wear the number 9 shirt for the 2014\u201315 season. Su\u00e1rez missed the first part of the season after being found guilty of biting Italian player Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. As part of the suspension, he was banned from all \"football-related activities\", including training for Barcelona, for four months (until 26 October). He was also banned from entering any stadium, even as a spectator, during the same period. On 24 July, Su\u00e1rez and his lawyers filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and requested the sanctions be reduced or the suspension to be lifted. The parties were heard at a hearing which took place at the CAS offices in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 8 August. Six days later, the CAS confirmed the ban imposed by FIFA against Su\u00e1rez, who remained suspended from football for four months, as well as a nine-match ban in internationals, the first of which was served in the Uruguay's round of 16 match against Colombia in the 2014 World Cup. However, the CAS removed the player's \"football-related activities\" ban and was allowed to train with Barcelona. As a result of this ban, Su\u00e1rez was banned from participating in the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica. The CAS permitted Su\u00e1rez to play in friendly matches, and he made his Barcelona debut on 18 August against Club Le\u00f3n of Mexico at the Camp Nou, replacing Rafinha for the final 14 minutes of an eventual 6\u20130 win in the Gamper Trophy. Fellow forwards Lionel Messi and Neymar had already been substituted off by the time Su\u00e1rez took to the pitch. ====2014\u201315: MSN trio and treble winner==== Su\u00e1rez made his competitive debut for Barcelona on 25 October, starting in attack with Lionel Messi and Neymar away to Real Madrid in El Cl\u00e1sico. Although he set up Neymar for the opening goal in the fourth minute, Su\u00e1rez was substituted in the second half and Barcelona lost 3\u20131. He scored his first goal for the club on 26 November in a 4\u20130 win at APOEL in the UEFA Champions League group stage. On 20 December, he scored his first league goal for the club in his eighth La Liga match, contributing to a 5\u20130 home win against C\u00f3rdoba. On 24 February 2015, Su\u00e1rez scored twice as Bar\u00e7a defeated English champions Manchester City 2\u20131 in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League round of 16 tie. On 4 March, he scored in Barcelona's 3\u20131 Copa del Rey semi-final win over Villarreal to qualify the club for its 37th Spanish Cup final. On 8 March, Su\u00e1rez scored twice in a 6\u20131 home win over Rayo Vallecano. On 22 March 2015, Su\u00e1rez scored the winning goal for Barcelona in the 2\u20131 victory over Real Madrid at Camp Nou. In the post-match press conference, his coach Luis Enrique lauded Su\u00e1rez, saying, \"Very few players can score a goal like he did, and that is why we signed him. He can decide games. He's a pure scorer, who needs very little to finish.\" On 15 April, Su\u00e1rez scored two goals in a 3\u20131 UEFA Champions League quarter-final first leg victory over Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. He nutmegged PSG defender David Luiz twice before scoring both goals. On 2 May, he scored his first hat-trick for the club, in 8\u20130 win at C\u00f3rdoba. Su\u00e1rez scored in the Champions League final against Juventus on 6 June in Berlin, putting the team back into the lead in an eventual 3\u20131 win by converting the rebound after Gianluigi Buffon saved from Messi. The win sealed a treble for the team. Su\u00e1rez ended his first season at Barcelona with 25 goals and 20 assists in all competitions. The Barcelona attacking trio of Messi, Su\u00e1rez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", ended with 122 goals, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history. ====2015\u201317: Second European Golden Shoe, domestic success==== Sevilla in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup Su\u00e1rez opened the season by scoring and assisting on a goal in Barcelona's 5\u20134 extra-time victory over Sevilla in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup, on 11 August 2015. The next day, he was named one of the three finalists for the 2015 UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. On 31 October, Su\u00e1rez scored in a 2\u20130 away win against Getafe after being assisted with a backheel from Sergi Roberto. This was his 11th goal of the season and his 300th senior career goal. On 21 November, Su\u00e1rez scored twice in Barcelona's 4\u20130 away win against Real Madrid. On 17 December, Su\u00e1rez scored all three goals as Barcelona defeated Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande 3\u20130 in the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup semi-final in Yokohama, Japan, becoming the first player to score a hat-trick in the competition's history. He then scored twice in Barcelona's 3\u20130 win over Argentine club River Plate in the final. Su\u00e1rez finished the tournament as top scorer with five goals and was also named the best player of the tournament. On 3 February 2016, Su\u00e1rez scored four goals in the 7\u20130 Copa del Rey win against Valencia. On 20 April, he again scored four times in a match, as well as assisting three further goals for teammates, as Bar\u00e7a won 8\u20130 away at Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a in La Liga. Only three days later, he scored another four goals in a 6\u20130 home win over Sporting de Gij\u00f3n, for which Su\u00e1rez became the first player to score four times in two consecutive matches in the history of La Liga. On 30 April, Su\u00e1rez became the second player in the history of the club to reach the milestone of 35 goals in a single season. On the final day of the 2015\u201316 La Liga season, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 victory at Granada to win the Spanish championship for Bar\u00e7a and registered 40 league goals for the season to win the Pichichi Trophy, for which Su\u00e1rez became the first player since 2009 to win both the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe other than Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Fourteen of his goals came in his last five matches. Su\u00e1rez also led the league in assists, tied at 16 with Messi, becoming the first player ever to lead La Liga in both goals and assists. On 22 May 2016, Su\u00e1rez suffered a season-ending injury during Barcelona's 2\u20130 victory over Sevilla in the 2016 Copa del Rey Final. The club confirmed after the match that Su\u00e1rez had suffered an injury to his right hamstring, and would likely miss at least part of the upcoming Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario with his national football team. For Uruguay, Su\u00e1rez also previously missed part of the 2014 World Cup and the entire 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica through suspension. The front three of Messi, Su\u00e1rez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season. Su\u00e1rez opened his goal scoring account of the following season by scoring a goal in the first leg of the 2016 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a against Sevilla and winning the match 0\u20132. In the first match of the 2016\u201317 La Liga season, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick in a 6\u20132 victory against Real Betis in which he scored his first free-kick goal for Barcelona. Su\u00e1rez made his 100th Barcelona appearance in a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Alav\u00e9s. Though unable to score, Su\u00e1rez claimed the distinction of scoring more goals and assists in his first 100 matches in Spain than both Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi; Su\u00e1rez contributed 88 goals and 43 assists in his first 100 matches for Barcelona, compared to Ronaldo's 95 goals and 29 assists, and Messi's 41 goals and 14 assists. Su\u00e1rez opened his UEFA Champions League account for the season with two goals in a 7\u20130 defeat of Celtic; this was followed by another goal in a 5\u20131 defeat of Legan\u00e9s. On 11 January 2017, Su\u00e1rez scored his 100th goal for Barcelona in a Copa del Rey round of 16 match against Athletic Bilbao. On 7 February, Su\u00e1rez scored and was later sent off for a second yellow in the semi-final match of the Copa del Rey against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for an alleged foul on Koke, his first red card competitively for Barcelona, meaning he would miss the final. In an interview after the match, Su\u00e1rez said he strongly disagreed with the decision, and wished to appeal it, saying, \"I'm laughing at that second yellow, it's not even a foul. I did absolutely nothing. I hope the club will appeal it.\" ====2017\u201320: Back- to-back La Liga triumphs and final season==== On 23 September, Su\u00e1rez scored in Barcelona's win over Girona in the first ever Catalan derby for the opposition. On 14 October, Su\u00e1rez maintained Barcelona's undefeated start to a La Liga season with a late header against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid. He scored twice against Legan\u00e9s in a 3\u20130 win at the Estadio Municipal de Butarque on 18 November. On 17 December, Su\u00e1rez scored two against Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a in a 4\u20130 win. Less than a week later, Su\u00e1rez opened the scoring for Barcelona in a 3\u20130 win over Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u. After the mid season break, on 14 January Su\u00e1rez scored twice in a 4\u20132 comeback win at Real Sociedad. Suarez scored a hat-trick in a 6\u20131 win over Girona at the Camp Nou on 24 February. On 31 March, late goals from Suarez and Messi secured a 2\u20132 draw against Sevilla at the Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n. On 14 April, Su\u00e1rez scored as Barcelona defeated Val\u00e8ncia 2\u20131 to secure the longest unbeaten streak (39 games) in La Liga history. Su\u00e1rez playing for Barcelona in 2019 On 21 April, Barcelona won their fourth consecutive Copa del Rey title in beating Sevilla 5\u20130 in Madrid, with Su\u00e1rez scoring twice. Barcelona held on for a dramatic 2\u20132 draw against Real Madrid on 6 May to extend their unbeaten streak in the league, with Su\u00e1rez and Messi scoring the goals for Barca, before Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale drew Real level. Barcelona's record unbeaten streak (43 games) came to an end on 13 May losing to Levante 4\u20135. Barcelona mounted a comeback after trailing 1\u20135, with Su\u00e1rez scoring one and new club record signing Philippe Coutinho scoring a hat-trick. On 2 September 2018, Su\u00e1rez scored twice for Barcelona in an 8\u20132 win over newly promoted Huesca. A week later he scored in their 2\u20131 victory at Real Sociedad, as the club made it four wins out of four in La Liga. On 28 October, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 home win over Real Madrid in El Cl\u00e1sico. Su\u00e1rez is only the second Barcelona player (after Messi) to score a hat-trick in El Cl\u00e1sico in La Liga since Rom\u00e1rio in 1994. He eventually managed to win another La Liga title for the fourth time with Barcelona. However, Su\u00e1rez scored only one goal in the 2018\u201319 UEFA Champions League, in a 3\u20130 win over his former club Liverpool in the semi-final first leg, then Barcelona lost the second leg 0\u20134 in Anfield to be eliminated from the competition. Su\u00e1rez scored two goals in a 2\u20131 win over Inter Milan in the 2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League group stage. Later on, he scored a goal in a 2\u20138 defeat against Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals, capping Bar\u00e7a's first trophyless season since 2007\u201308. ===Atl\u00e9tico Madrid=== ====2020\u201321 season==== After becoming Barcelona head coach on 19 August 2020, Ronald Koeman informed Su\u00e1rez he was no longer wanted, and club president Josep Maria Bartomeu had also left him off a list of players he considered not for sale in the aftermath of the 8\u20132 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League earlier that month. On 23 September 2020, after failing to join Juventus and amid accusations that he cheated his way to obtain an Italian citizenship, Su\u00e1rez signed a two-year contract with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. On 27 September, he made his debut for the club, scoring two goals and providing Marcos Llorente with an assist in a 6\u20131 victory against Granada. ==International career== Su\u00e1rez was invited to play for Uruguay in the qualifying rounds for the 2007 U-20 World Cup, but his club, Groningen, did not release him to play. He did play in the tournament finals, and he scored two goals in four appearances. His goals came in a group stage draw against Spain and in the Round of 16 against the United States, but the U.S. won 2\u20131 and Uruguay was eliminated from the tournament. Su\u00e1rez made his senior debut for Uruguay on 8 February 2007 in a 3\u20131 win against Colombia. He was sent off in the 85th minute after receiving a second yellow card for dissent. Su\u00e1rez played in 19 of 20 games in 2010 World Cup qualifying and the inter- confederation play-offs and scored five goals. ===2010 FIFA World Cup=== Su\u00e1rez (left) and Diego Forl\u00e1n at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa In June 2010, \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez named Su\u00e1rez to Uruguay's 23-man World Cup squad. Uruguay began the tournament with a 0\u20130 draw against France. In the second match, a 3\u20130 win over South Africa, Su\u00e1rez drew a penalty and assisted \u00c1lvaro Pereira's stoppage time goal. In the final match of the group stage, he headed in a goal off a pass from Edinson Cavani and was named Man of the Match in a 1\u20130 win over Mexico. Uruguay won Group A and advanced to the knockout stage. During the round of 16 against South Korea, Su\u00e1rez scored both goals in a 2\u20131 win. His second broke a tie in the 80th minute when he dribbled around a defender and curled a \"spectacular shot\" in off the far post; Su\u00e1rez was again named Man of the Match. This win put Uruguay through to the quarter-finals for the first time since 1970. In the quarter-final against Ghana, the score was 1\u20131 at the end of regulation and the match went into extra time. Late in extra time, Ghana sent a free-kick into the box, and Su\u00e1rez blocked Stephen Appiah's shot on the goal line. He then blocked Dominic Adiyiah's goalbound header with his hands, committing a professional foul to save what would have been the game winner and was sent off. Asamoah Gyan hit the crossbar with the ensuing penalty kick and Su\u00e1rez, who had stopped to watch, celebrated the miss before heading down the tunnel. Uruguay won the shootout 4\u20132 and advanced to the semi-finals. After the match, Su\u00e1rez said, \"I made the save of the tournament.\" He said he had no alternative, was acting out of instinct, and would do it again if it helped his team win. Ghana head coach Milovan Rajevac said the play was an \"injustice\" and Su\u00e1rez was labelled a villain and a cheater. Others viewed him as a hero. Due to the automatic suspension that accompanies a red card, Su\u00e1rez sacrificed himself in the semi-final for the unlikely chance the penalty would be missed, and his team would later win. While Su\u00e1rez was suspended for the semi-final match for his red card against Ghana, Uruguay \"lacked a second striker [alongside Diego Forl\u00e1n] of cunning and movement\" and lost 3\u20132 to the Netherlands. Su\u00e1rez returned for the third place game against Germany; he was booed almost every time he had the ball because of his handball in the Ghana match. He assisted Cavani on Uruguay's first goal, but Uruguay lost 3\u20132. During the tournament, Su\u00e1rez played 543 minutes in six appearances and scored three goals. ===2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica=== Su\u00e1rez was named most valuable player of the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica In the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica, Su\u00e1rez scored in Uruguay's opening game, a 1\u20131 draw with Peru. Uruguay finished second in their group and advanced to the knockout round with a win, 1\u20130 against Mexico, and two draws, against Peru and Chile. In the quarter-finals, Uruguay drew with tournament hosts Argentina 1\u20131 after regulation and extra time. Uruguay won the shootout 5\u20134 and Su\u00e1rez converted his penalty. Su\u00e1rez scored both goals in Uruguay's 2\u20130 semi-final win over Peru and was named Man of the Match. In the final, Su\u00e1rez scored the opening goal as Uruguay defeated Paraguay 3\u20130 for their record 15th Copa Am\u00e9rica title. Su\u00e1rez scored four goals during the tournament and was named MVP of the Tournament. ===2012 Summer Olympics=== On 9 July 2012, Su\u00e1rez was selected for the Uruguay Olympic football team alongside Liverpool teammate Sebasti\u00e1n Coates to compete in the 2012 Olympic Games. In the first pre-tournament warm- up game against Chile on 11 July, Su\u00e1rez scored a hat-trick for Uruguay as they came from 0\u20132 down to win 6\u20134 in a thrilling match. As one of Uruguay's three overage players, Su\u00e1rez was named as captain for the Olympic Games. After an opening win over the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay were defeated by Senegal and Great Britain and eliminated at the first round. Su\u00e1rez failed to score during the tournament. ===2013 Confederations Cup=== Su\u00e1rez was selected in the Uruguay squad to play in Brazil at the 2013 Confederations Cup. He scored a curling free-kick from in a 2\u20131 defeat to Spain in their opening match at Recife on 16 June. He then scored twice after appearing as a substitute in Uruguay's 8\u20130 win over Tahiti, making him the Uruguay national team's all-time top-goalscorer with 35 goals, surpassing his teammate Diego Forl\u00e1n. Uruguay were eventually eliminated in the semi-finals, losing 2\u20131 to Brazil in Belo Horizonte.\"Brazil 2\u20131 Uruguay\". BBC Sport. Retrieved 29 June 2014 ===2014 FIFA World Cup, third biting incident=== celebrating one of his two goals against England at the 2014 World Cup Su\u00e1rez ended the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign as top scorer in the South American section with 11 goals in 14 matches. In November 2013, Uruguay defeated Jordan 5\u20130 on aggregate in an intercontinental play-off to qualify for the 2014 World Cup. On 22 May, Su\u00e1rez underwent emergency surgery on his left knee. He was confined to a wheelchair for a time, leading to rumours he would be unable to participate in the World Cup. He was named as a substitute for Uruguay's first match, a 3\u20131 defeat to Costa Rica, but did not play in the match. Su\u00e1rez started Uruguay's second match against England and scored both of the team's goals in a 2\u20131 win at the Arena Corinthians in S\u00e3o Paulo. For Uruguay's final group match against Italy on 24 June, Uruguay needed a win to advance to the knockout stage while Italy only needed a draw. Around the 79th minute and with the score at 0\u20130, Su\u00e1rez clashed with Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini while waiting for a cross. Replays showed that Su\u00e1rez lunged at Chiellini and bit his shoulder (Chiellini showed bite marks), followed by Su\u00e1rez falling and clutching his face. The controversial incident made headline news around the world.\"Luis Suarez bite: We will use every argument possible to get him cleared, vows lawyer\". Evening Standard. Retrieved 6 September 2014 As the Italian players protested to Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodr\u00edguez for not penalising Su\u00e1rez for the bite, Uruguay won a corner and scored. The match would finish 1\u20130 to Uruguay as they qualified for the knockout stage and eliminated Italy. Two days later, on 26 June, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, banned Su\u00e1rez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. The ban ruled him out of 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica as well. It was the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique at the 1994 World Cup. He was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months and fined CHF100,000. The seven-member FIFA panel studied the incident from 34 camera angles and rejected Su\u00e1rez's defence that the bite was as a result of an accidental collision, instead finding the bite was \"deliberate, intentional and without provocation... with the intention of wounding [Chiellini] or at least of destabilising him\". The severity of the penalty was due to the fact it was Su\u00e1rez's third biting offence, as well as what FIFA saw as a lack of remorse. Soon after the suspension was announced, online gambling firm 888poker cancelled its sponsorship deal with Su\u00e1rez. With Su\u00e1rez banned, Uruguay lost their next match 0\u20132 to Colombia and were eliminated from the World Cup. On the same day the ban was announced, the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) said it would appeal the suspension. Su\u00e1rez's lawyer said that \"we don't have any doubts\" of a European-based campaign against Su\u00e1rez. Various Uruguayan individuals defended Su\u00e1rez, questioning if he had actually bitten Chiellini, and criticised the severity of his ban, including President of Uruguay Jos\u00e9 Mujica, who labelled the ban \"fascist\" and called FIFA \"a bunch of old sons of bitches\"; AUF president Wilmar Valdez; Uruguay captain Diego Lugano; and Uruguay head coach \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez, who resigned from two FIFA posts in protest of the ban. The Uruguayan media were also noted to have been in a defiant and defensive mood. For non- Uruguayan parties, Chiellini, who was bitten, called the ban \"excessive\", while international players' union FIFPro called for Su\u00e1rez to \"receive all the support he needs\" and that the \"focus should be on the rehabilitation and serious treatment\" of Su\u00e1rez. Six days after the incident, on 30 June, Su\u00e1rez apologised to Chiellini through Twitter and vowed never to repeat the incident, while writing that the \"physical result of a bite\" occurred in a collision with Chiellini. Chiellini responded through Twitter indicating all was forgotten and his hope that FIFA would reduce Su\u00e1rez's suspension. On 3 July, the AUF appealed Su\u00e1rez's ban, but it was rejected by FIFA on 10 July. With Su\u00e1rez's ban not preventing him from transferring to another club, it was announced on 11 July that Su\u00e1rez had agreed to move to Barcelona. Days before the transfer, Su\u00e1rez's apology to Chiellini had been praised by various Barcelona club individuals. Barcelona club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the apology was \"honourable\", sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta welcomed Su\u00e1rez as being \"humble enough to admit an error\" while new signing Ivan Rakiti\u0107 commended Su\u00e1rez's \"character and strength\". ===Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario and 2018 FIFA World Cup=== Portugal in the last 16 of the 2018 World Cup On 25 March 2016, after over a year of international absence for Uruguay, Su\u00e1rez scored an equalizer against Brazil in Recife for a 2\u20132 draw in the qualification process for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Su\u00e1rez was included in Uruguay's 23-man squad for the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario, although a hamstring injury sustained in the 2016 Copa del Rey final on 22 May put his place in the team in jeopardy. Although he remained in the squad, he missed both of his national side's opening group losses to Mexico and Venezuela, which resulted in a first-round elimination from the tournament. He was once again left on the substitutes' bench in Uruguay's final 3\u20130 group win over Jamaica on 13 June. Su\u00e1rez scored twice on 10 October 2017 as Uruguay won 4\u20132 at home to Bolivia in their final World Cup qualifying match, thus securing their place for the tournament in Russia. In March, Uruguay won the 2018 China Cup, and Su\u00e1rez scored his 50th international goal with a penalty against the Czech Republic in the semi-finals, winning it himself when fouled by goalkeeper Ji\u0159\u00ed Pavlenka. He won his 100th cap on 20 June 2018 in Uruguay's second group match at the World Cup, scoring the only goal against Saudi Arabia at the Rostov Arena in Rostov-on-Don to advance the nation into the last 16. In the final group game on 25 June, Su\u00e1rez scored Uruguay's opener with a free kick into the bottom corner in a 3\u20130 win over hosts Russia. In the Round of 16 match against Portugal on 30 June, he set-up Cavani's opening goal in an eventual 2\u20131 victory. Uruguay were eliminated from the tournament following a 2\u20130 defeat to France in the quarter-finals on 6 July. ===2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica=== In March 2019, manager Tab\u00e1rez included Su\u00e1rez in the final 23-man Uruguay squad for the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil. On 16 June, he scored the third goal in a 4\u20130 win over Ecuador in the team's opening group match of the tournament, also setting up the opener scored by Nicol\u00e1s Lodeiro. In the quarter-finals against Peru on 29 June, he had a goal disallowed by VAR for offside, and was subsequently the only player to miss his spot-kick in the resulting penalty shoot-out, following a 0\u20130 draw after regulation time, which saw Uruguay eliminated from the competition. ==Style of play== Su\u00e1rez in action for Liverpool takes on Sylvain Distin of Everton during the Merseyside Derby in 2012 Su\u00e1rez creates goal scoring chances with his powerful shot, and has \"remarkable technical ability\" according to his FIFA profile. Known for his direct running at players, Su\u00e1rez has a particular penchant for nutmegging opponents (putting the ball through their legs). Liverpool fans (accompanied with a banner) used to say he was so good, \"he could nutmeg a mermaid\". Harry Redknapp said that Su\u00e1rez could play anywhere \u2013 as the target man or behind as a second striker. Uruguay head coach \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez called Su\u00e1rez \"a great forward, an elite player among forwards in the world\", and Liverpool coach Kenny Dalglish said, \"he's intelligent, he's had a fantastic education at Ajax\". Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge said his abilities allow him to get into a position to score and evade defenders. Su\u00e1rez has been praised for his work rate, and his quickness that allows him to attack from the outside. He also creates many scoring opportunities for his teammates, as is reflected in his high number of assists. Former Ajax coach Marco van Basten criticised Su\u00e1rez for his tendency to receive yellow cards. Van Basten said he had a tense relationship with Su\u00e1rez, although he conceded that \"Luis is unpredictable, he's hard to influence but that makes him special.\" At times, Su\u00e1rez can be dominant but fail to convert his efforts into goals. Despite his weaknesses, Su\u00e1rez's leadership stood out to Ajax management. == Controversies == Su\u00e1rez has been widely accused of diving. His manager, teammates and various analysts have commented that this reputation for simulation has caused referees not to award him legitimate penalties. In January 2013, Su\u00e1rez admitted to diving against Stoke City in an October 2012 match. This led his manager Brendan Rodgers to comment his actions were \"unacceptable\" and that he would be dealt with \"internally\" by the club. During the 2018 World Cup game against Portugal, after collisions with Portuguese players, Suarez twice acted like he had a head injury despite Suarez's head not being touched. Su\u00e1rez has received infamy for the multiple occasions he has bitten opponents. In a Group D matchup at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Suarez was shown to have bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini, resulting in FIFA suspending Suarez from all football activities for 4 months. While playing for Liverpool, Suarez bit Chelsea player Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 in a Premier League match, and was punished with a ten match ban. In an earlier incident while playing for AFC Ajax he was caught biting PSV Eindhoven player Otman Bakkal and was suspended for seven games. Su\u00e1rez has also been accused of stamping on opponents in the Premier League and the UEFA Europa League. Due to his diving, biting, stamping, and other antics, Su\u00e1rez has been frequently labelled as a pest and a cheat. In December 2013, Spanish football website El Gol Digital ranked Su\u00e1rez at fifth in its list of the world's dirtiest footballers. ==Media and sponsorship== Puma since 2018. He wears Puma Future 2.1. Su\u00e1rez had a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas, before switching to rivals Puma in 2018. Su\u00e1rez starred in a 2014 advert for Beats with other global football stars including Neymar and Thierry Henry, with the theme of \"The Game Before the Game\" and the players' pre-game ritual of listening to music.\"Neymar, Thierry Henry and Luis Suarez star in thrilling new World Cup advert\".

Active on social media, Su\u00e1rez has over 35 million Instagram followers as of May 2020, the most for a person from Uruguay. ==Personal life== Su\u00e1rez was born in Salto, Uruguay to Sandra Diaz and Rodolfo Su\u00e1rez, the fourth of seven boys. His older brother, Paolo Su\u00e1rez, is a retired professional footballer, who last played for Isidro Metap\u00e1n in El Salvador. Su\u00e1rez moved with his family to Montevideo when he was seven, and his parents separated when he was nine. In Montevideo, he developed his football skills on the streets, while also taking up work as a street sweeper at the age of 15. The contrast between his life in Europe and the poverty he left behind has been cited as contributing to his periodic aggression on the field, as well as being a possible explanation for the more forgiving attitudes of the Uruguayan public and press towards such cases, compared to Europe. Besides his native tongue, Su\u00e1rez is able to speak Dutch and English. Mural of Su\u00e1rez on his former school in Montevideo, Uruguay Su\u00e1rez is of mixed race, with public records indicating his having a black grandfather. The matter of ethnicity was raised in reporting on the Patrice Evra incident, where use by his grandmother, Lila Piriz, of \"mi negrito\" as a sobriquet has been offered to explain Su\u00e1rez's repeated use of \"negro\" over the two-minute altercation; the FA judged his evidence unreliable en route to issuing him an eight-match ban. His mother also supported the claim Su\u00e1rez made that using the word was not racist in Uruguay. She said it was \"normal\", and that it was \"a word people use with their friends. It's like calling someone fat, thin or whatever.\" Su\u00e1rez began dating Sof\u00eda Balbi at age 15 in Montevideo; the Balbi family moved to Barcelona in 2003, and Su\u00e1rez's focus on football strengthened as a result as he wanted to follow them to Europe to join Sof\u00eda again. Su\u00e1rez married her in 2009, and the couple have a daughter named Delfina (born 2010) and two sons named Benjamin (born 2013) and Lauti (born 2018). He has a tattoo of his daughter's name Delfina on his wrist which he kisses as part of his goal celebration \u2013 this celebration routine is featured in EA Sports\u2019 video game FIFA 15 as \"Kiss The Wrist\". On 11 July 2014, Su\u00e1rez joined Barcelona, allowing him to live closer with his wife Sof\u00eda's family. On the move, Su\u00e1rez said, \"[Liverpool] did all they could to get me to stay, but playing and living in Spain, where my wife's family live, is a lifelong dream and ambition. I believe now the timing is right.\" In 2014, Su\u00e1rez released his autobiography, Crossing the Line \u2013 My Story. Su\u00e1rez who is married to an Italian citizen, flew to Perugia in September 2020, to do a B1 Italian language exam in order to gain Italian citizenship. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {|
