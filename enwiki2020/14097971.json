KVVS is licensed to Rosamond, California, United States, it serves the Antelope Valley area. The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.. Although a simulcast, KVVS broadcasts as a class A commercial station with 6,000 watts ERP, but does not broadcast its unique call sign for an unknown reason. ==History== 105.5 FM signed on in 1988 as a Christian Talk station known as KAVC. The format lasted until 1998, when KAVC was moved to 1340 AM in Mojave, California. 105.5 changed call letters to KOSS and started a new Adult Contemporary format as 105.5 The Oasis. As time went on, Oasis began to lean more toward Hot AC. In December 2007, Oasis 105.5's air staff was dismissed and 97.7's simulcast of KIIS was moved to 105.5, the KVVS call letters were moved to 105.5 as well. The KOSS call letters made their way up to 97.7 in Mojave, which became the new home to KTPI-FM. The KTPI call letters resided at 103.1 in Tehachapi until January 2, 2008 when they were moved to 97.7 and the KOSS call letters moved to 103.1 FM for a brief time until their call letters were changed to KSRY and 103.1 became a simulcast of Alt 98.7 FM. KTLW's flagship station 88.9 leases tower space on KVVS's tower. Antelecom also leases space on KVVS's tower for their wireless broadband service. ==Airstaff== KVVS is a simulcast of KIIS-FM (\"102.7 KIIS-FM\") in Los Angeles.
