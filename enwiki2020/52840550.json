    "text": "\"Have Guns \u2014 Will Haggle\" is the twelfth episode of the sixth series of the 1960s cult British spy-fi television series The Avengers, starring Patrick Macnee and Linda Thorson. It was first aired by Thames Television on 11 December 1968. The episode was directed by Ray Austin, and written by Donald James. ==Plot== Three thousand top-secret and super-powerful FF70 rifles are stolen and come up on the black market for auction. In order to thwart the power-hungry Col. Nsonga, Steed decides to try and outbid him. There is an added incentive: the winner also decides the fate of the captured Tara. ==Cast== *Patrick Macnee as John Steed *Linda Thorson as Tara King *Johnny Sekka as Col.

In its original conception, entitled \"Invitation to a Killing\", it ran for 90 minutes and introduced the character of Tara King. As with Steed's previous companions, the intention was to introduce Tara as already working with Steed. However when original producer John Bryce was replaced by Albert Fennell and Brian Clemens, they decided to begin the series with \"The Forget-Me-Knot\" which explicitly introduced the character, so \"Have Guns \u2014 Will Haggle\" was moved to midway through the run. As such, it was edited down to the usual length of around 50 minutes.Rogers, Dave (1995) The Ultimate Avengers, Boxtree ==References== ==External links== * *Episode overview on The Avengers Forever! website Category:1968 British television episodes Category:The Avengers (season 6) episodes ",
