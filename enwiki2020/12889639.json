    "text": "Franklin Thomasson Franklin 'Frankie' Thomasson (16 August 1873 \u2013 29 October 1941) was an English 20th century MP. Descended from a well known family of cotton spinners from Bolton, Lancashire, Franklin Thomasson was born on 16 August 1873 at Alderley Edge, Cheshire, the 3rd child of John Pennington Thomasson, who was a benefactor and MP for Bolton. He married Elizabeth, a daughter of the late Caleb Coffin of New York City on 11 July 1895. They had 3 children, John (1898), Marjorie (1901) and Barbara (1903). Franklin contested the Westhoughton Parliamentary division in 1900, and Stretford in 1901, but on both occasions he was unsuccessful. He became Liberal MP for Leicester at a by-election in 1906, however, sharing the representation of the double-member constituency with Ramsay MacDonald. He retired at the January 1910 election. In 1906, Thomasson ventured on a bold but disastrous experiment in newspaper production by founding the Tribune (1906\u20131908). He played a large part in local political life before he left Bolton for London. During World War I he commanded the 2-5th Battalion Loyal North Lancashire Regiment. His wife Elizabeth died in 1927 and he then married Gertrude Prescott. They had three children, Margaret (1930), Christopher (1932) and Jenny (1937). Franklin died of cancer on 29 October 1941 aged 68 and was buried at Lyndhurst, Hampshire. == References == *Bolton Journal and Guardian 4 August 1933 * == External links == * Category:People educated at Bolton School Category:People from Bolton Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1906\u20131910 Category:1873 births Category:1941 deaths ",
