There were a total number of 40 participating athletes, with three qualifying heats and the final held on Sunday 1993-08-22. The three Chinese athletes in this race showed their inexperience at this level. Yan Wei looked at the starter while all the other athletes were looking forward at their first step. At the gun, all three were squeezed to the back having to halt their steps, with Liu Dong being left at the back of the field. Liu sped around the outside of the field in the first 125 metres to reach the front, but Olympic champion Hassiba Boulmerka had no interest in letting her take the pace, instead aggressively holding Liu to the outside. Boxed at the back of the pack for the first 400 meters, L\u00fc Yi then ran around the far outside of the pack to join Liu's shoulder on the outside. Just before 800 meters, Yan worked her way through traffic to get behind L\u00fc, temporarily boxing in Sonia O'Sullivan. Crossing the start line for the second time, Liu accelerated into the lead with L\u00fc in tow. Boulmerka continued to fight, holding off L\u00fc with the field stringing out behind them. Over the next lap, it became a four-woman breakaway as O'Sullivan was the only other able to hold onto the pace. Liu continued to increase the gap to Boulmerka, opening up 10 metres down the backstretch as L\u00fc sprinted past Boulmerka into second. O'Sullivan followed L\u00fc then sprinted past her on the final curve. Liu was gone, pulling away to a 15-metre win. O'Sullivan maintained her position as L\u00fc faded. Boulmerka was unable to make any headway against O'Sullivan and had to settle for bronze. ==Final== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\" !RANK !align=\"left\" style=\"width: 18em\"|FINAL !TIME |- |align=\"center\"|Image:Med 1.png | |align=\"center\"|4:00.50 |- |align=\"center\"|Image:Med 2.png | |align=\"center\"|4:03.48 |- |align=\"center\"|Image:Med 3.png | |align=\"center\"|4:04.29 |- |align=\"center\"|4. | |align=\"center\"|4:06.06 |- |align=\"center\"|5. | |align=\"center\"|4:07.95 |- |align=\"center\"|6. | |align=\"center\"|4:08.04 |- |align=\"center\"|7. | |align=\"center\"|4:08.11 |- |align=\"center\"|8. | |align=\"center\"|4:08.23 |- |align=\"center\"|9. | |align=\"center\"|4:08.57 |- |align=\"center\"|10. | |align=\"center\"|4:09.05 |- |align=\"center\"|11. | |align=\"center\"|4:09.15 |- |align=\"center\"|12. | |align=\"center\"|4:10.79 |- |align=\"center\"|13. | |align=\"center\"|4:12.14 |- |align=\"center\"|14. | |align=\"center\"|4:13.87 |- |align=\"center\"|15. | |align=\"center\"|4:18.93 |} ==Qualifying heats== *Held on Friday 1993-08-20 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\" !RANK !style=\"width: 20em\"|HEAT 1 !style=\"width: 5em\"|TIME |- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" |align=\"center\"|1. | |align=\"center\"|4:05.81 |- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" |align=\"center\"|2. | |align=\"center\"|4:05.97 |- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" |align=\"center\"|3. | |align=\"center\"|4:06.89 |- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" |align=\"center\"|4. | |align=\"center\"|4:07.46 |- style=\"background:#ddffdd;\" |align=\"center\"|5. | |align=\"center\"|4:08.33 |- |align=\"center\"|6. | |align=\"center\"|4:09.75 |- |align=\"center\"|7. | |align=\"center\"|4:10.70 |- |align=\"center\"|8. | |align=\"center\"|4:11.29 |- |align=\"center\"|9. | |align=\"center\"|4:12.93 |- |align=\"center\"|10. | |align=\"center\"|4:13.40 |- |align=\"center\"|11. | |align=\"center\"|4:17.43 |- |align=\"center\"|12. | |align=\"center\"|4:25.70 |- |align=\"center\"|13. | |align=\"center\"|4:49.22 |- |align=\"center\"| \u2013 | |align=\"center\"|DNS |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\" !RANK !style=\"width: 20em\"|HEAT 2 !style=\"width: 5em\"|TIME |- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" |align=\"center\"|1. | |align=\"center\"|4:13.13 |- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" |align=\"center\"|2. | |align=\"center\"|4:13.87 |- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" |align=\"center\"|3. | |align=\"center\"|4:13.93 |- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" |align=\"center\"|4. | |align=\"center\"|4:13.94 |- |align=\"center\"|5. | |align=\"center\"|4:14.34 |- |align=\"center\"|6. | |align=\"center\"|4:14.75 |- |align=\"center\"|7. | |align=\"center\"|4:14.81 |- |align=\"center\"|8. | |align=\"center\"|4:15.15 |- |align=\"center\"|9. | |align=\"center\"|4:19.67 |- |align=\"center\"|10. | |align=\"center\"|4:21.33 |- |align=\"center\"|11. | |align=\"center\"|4:28.39 |- |align=\"center\"| \u2013 | |align=\"center\"|DNS |- |align=\"center\"| \u2013 | |align=\"center\"|DNS |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\" !RANK !style=\"width: 20em\"|HEAT 3 !style=\"width: 5em\"|TIME |- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" |align=\"center\"|1. | |align=\"center\"|4:04.36 |- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" |align=\"center\"|2. | |align=\"center\"|4:07.52 |- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" |align=\"center\"|3. | |align=\"center\"|4:07.95 |- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\" |align=\"center\"|4. | |align=\"center\"|4:08.32 |- style=\"background:#ddffdd;\" |align=\"center\"|5. | |align=\"center\"|4:08.82 |- style=\"background:#ddffdd;\" |align=\"center\"|6. | |align=\"center\"|4:08.97 |- |align=\"center\"|7. | |align=\"center\"|4:11.75 |- |align=\"center\"|8. | |align=\"center\"|4:14.47 |- |align=\"center\"|9. | |align=\"center\"|4:18.67 |- |align=\"center\"|10. | |align=\"center\"|4:29.17 |- |align=\"center\"|11. | |align=\"center\"|4:42.15 |- |align=\"center\"|12. | |align=\"center\"|4:56.22 |- |align=\"center\"| \u2013 | |align=\"center\"|DNF |} ==See also== * 1990 Women's European Championships 1500 metres (Split) * 1991 Women's World Championships 1500 metres (Tokyo) * 1992 Women's Olympic 1500 metres (Barcelona) * 1994 Women's European Championships 1500 metres (Helsinki) * 1995 Women's World Championships 1500 metres (Gothenburg) ==References== * Results Category:1500 metres at the World Athletics Championships Category:1993 in women's athletics ",
