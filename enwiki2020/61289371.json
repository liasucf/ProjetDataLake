    "text": "Mila - Quebec AI Institute (originally Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms) is a research institute in Montreal, Quebec, focusing mainly on machine learning research. Approximately 500 researchers, including faculty and students, were part of Mila in 2020. == History == Mila was founded as Laboratoire d'informatique des syst\u00e8mes adaptatifs (LISA) at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in 1993 by Yoshua Bengio, a Turing award winner and one of the founders of the field of deep learning. Since 2017, Mila is the result of a partnership between the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and McGill University with \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al and HEC Montr\u00e9al. == Notable researchers == Besides Bengio, Mila's faculty members include Jo\u00eblle Pineau and Doina Precup. Some of its graduates include Hugo Larochelle and Ian Goodfellow. == Research activities == Research at Mila is largely, but not exclusively focused on deep learning and reinforcement learning. Specific research topics include: * generative models * natural language processing * meta learning * computer vision * reinforcement learning * applications of AI, including: climate change research and covid-19 research. == Other activities == Mila is both a research and educational institution, providing postdoc and internship positions, and granting PhD and Master's degrees in machine learning. Mila members have also contributed to open-source software. Theano, one of the early programming frameworks for deep learning originated at Mila. In 2020, active projects included myia, a deep learning framework for Python, and baby- ai, a platform for simulating language learning with a human in the loop. In addition, Mila is also involved in numerous partnerships with private companies. == References == == External links == * Mila Category:Research institutes in Canada Category:McGill University Category:Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al Category:Artificial intelligence laboratories ",
