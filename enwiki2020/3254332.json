Like most other towns in the East Fjords, it is surrounded by mountains, of which the highest is about . Although the climate is particularly rainy and foggy, on clear summer days it often has the highest temperatures in Iceland. From the early 20th century, Rey\u00f0arfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur was a trading port, as well as a fishing port. Due to its strategic location and good harbour conditions, it became the second-largest of the Allied bases in Iceland during World War II. There is a World War II museum located at the old camp above the town. Rey\u00f0arfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur joined Eskifj\u00f6r\u00f0ur and Neskaupsta\u00f0ur in 1998 to form the new municipality of Fjar\u00f0abygg\u00f0 (\"fjords-settlement\"). ==Geography== The other villages composing the municipality are: Eskifj\u00f6r\u00f0ur (1,043 inh.), F\u00e1skr\u00fa\u00f0sfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur (662 inh.), Mj\u00f3ifj\u00f6r\u00f0ur (35 inh.), Neskaupsta\u00f0ur (1,437 inh.)Located in the Nor\u00f0fj\u00f6r\u00f0ur and St\u00f6\u00f0varfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur (203 inh.).

It was built between 2004 and 2007 by the contractor Bechtel, requiring thousands of workers from various countries, most notably from Poland. At one point, the town had the highest concentration of foreign residents of any community in the country, and the number of workers reached as high as 2,800. By 2008, the construction workers had left. The townspeople have faith in the aluminium plant for the continuing prosperity of their old community, and surrounding communities. The Fjar\u00f0a\u00e1l aluminium smelter reached full production capacity in April 2008. The facility contains a smelter, cast house, rod production and deep-water port. The smelter employs 450 people and produces 940 tons of aluminium a day, with capacity of 346,000 metric tons of aluminium per year. Fjar\u00f0a\u00e1l means \"Fjords aluminium\" in Icelandic.Alcoa - Fjar\u00f0a\u00e1l smelter information For the smelter, the new K\u00e1rahnj\u00fakar Hydropower Plant in the neighboring municipality of Flj\u00f3tsdalsh\u00e9ra\u00f0 was built. ==Catholic church== Catholic Church, 2017 On 17 June 2017 a new Catholic Church was consecrated in the town in a ceremony led by Bishop David Tencer of Reykjavik.
