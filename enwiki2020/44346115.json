    "text": "Manuel Mar\u00eda Eutimio de Zamacona y Murphy (13 September 1826 \u2013 29 May 1904) was a Mexican radical liberal lawyer, journalist, and politician. Born in Puebla, he studied at seminary and went on to practice law. As a journalist he founded El Siglo XIX, an influential newspaper founded in 1852.Brian Hamnett, Ju\u00e1rez, New York: Longmans 1994, pp. 179-80. He served as minister of Foreign Affairs in the cabinet of President Benito Ju\u00e1rez (1861). He negotiated an agreement with the British Ambassador to Mexico, Charles Wyke, known as the Wyke-Zamacona Treaty, which sought an interim solution of the Ju\u00e1rez government's problems concerning the external debt to Great Britain, France, and Spain. When Ju\u00e1rez decided to suspend payments on the foreign debt in July 1861, he risked foreign intervention. The treaty was aimed at forestalling that, but it was rejected by the Mexican congress. With that rejection, Zamacona resigned from Ju\u00e1rez's government and went on to lead the liberal opposition to Ju\u00e1rez.Hamnett, Ju\u00e1rez, pp. 154, 280. He negotiated diplomatic recognition to the administration of President Porfirio D\u00edaz from the government of the United States (1878) and presided over the Supreme Court of Justice. ==Notes and references== Category:1826 births Category:1904 deaths Category:Politicians from Puebla Category:Mexican Secretaries of Foreign Affairs Category:Ambassadors of Mexico to the United States Category:Presidents of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation Category:Presidents of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico) Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Mexico) Category:People from Puebla (city) Category:Liberalism in Mexico Category:Second French intervention in Mexico ",
