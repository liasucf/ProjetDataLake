    "text": "The European Conservatives and Reformists Party (ECR Party), formerly known as Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (AECR) (2009\u20132016) and Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (ACRE) (2016\u20132019), is a conservative Eurosceptic European political party with a main focus on reforming the European Union (EU) on the basis of Eurorealism, as opposed to total rejection of the EU (anti-EU-ism). It currently has twenty-four member parties and three further independent members from twenty-one countries, in addition to seven regional partners worldwide. The political movement was founded on 1 October 2009, after the creation of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) political group of the European Parliament. It was officially recognised by the European Parliament in January 2010. ECR is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the Council, which represents all ECR member parties. The executive board is composed of the president Giorgia Meloni, Secretary General Anna Fotyga MEP from Poland, and Treasurer Jorge Buxad\u00e9 MEP from Spain. The party is affiliated with the European Conservatives and Reformists Group in the European Parliament, the pan-European think tank New Direction \u2013 The Foundation for European Reform, and the youth organisation the European Young Conservatives. It is also formally associated with the European Conservatives and Reformists Group in the Committee of the Regions, in the Congress of the Council of Europe, and in the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. In the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the ECR Party forms the European Conservatives Group and Democratic Alliance with the Identity and Democracy Party. ==History== The European Conservatives and Reformits Party was founded as the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists on 1 October 2009, after the ECR political group was founded in the wake of the 2009 European Parliament election, and was officially recognised by the European Parliament in January 2010. Amongst ACRE's eight founding members the largest were the UK Conservative Party, the Polish PiS and the Czech ODS. ECR was formally constituted under the chairmanship of Belgian MEP Derk Jan Eppink, who was succeeded by Czech MEP Jan Zahradil. At ACRE's first congress was in Warsaw on 8 June 2010, attended by its founding members, including UK Conservative Party Chairman and Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek. On 25 March 2011, the Civic Conservative Party from Slovakia joined; Iceland's Independence Party in November 2011 (the party's first member from outside the European Union); Georgia's Christian- Democratic Movement in August 2012; Italy's Conservatives and Social Reformers in October 2012; the Conservative Party of Canada became the ACRE's first associate member (later renamed 'regional partners') in November 2012; Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party in November 2013; and the Faroe Islands' People's Party, and Romania's New Republic; and in July 2014, Prosperous Armenia. The Conservative Party of Georgia and New Majority joined on 1 November 2014. At the same time, the ACRE formally affiliated to the European Conservatives Group in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. In November 2015, the Conservatives and Reformists of Italy were admitted as ECR Party members, followed by the Alliance for Progress and Renewal (ALFA) of Germany and M10 party of Romania in March 2016. The Liberal Party of Australia, Istiqlal Party of Morocco, National Party of New Zealand, and Republican Party of the United States joined as further regional partners in 2014, followed by Afek Tounes and Likud Movement in 2015 and 2016. The Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists officially changed its name to the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (ACRE) on 6 October 2016. In December 2018, ACRE was ordered to repay more than half a million euros of EU funds, following an investigation into their spending. This included \u20ac250,000 for a three-day conference in Miami and \u20ac90,000 for a trade meeting in Kampala. ACRE had previously been asked to return \u20ac121,000 given to the Prosperous Armenia party. More recently the ECR has seen a shift further towards the conservative right with the acceptance of the Brothers of Italy, Forum for Democracy, Vox and Sweden Democrats as members in 2019.https://www.euractiv.com/section/eu-elections-2019/news/italys-far-right- hopes-to-form-new-broad-conservative-alliance-in- europe/https://www.acreurope.eu/item/acre_welcomes_three_new_parties All four members are nationalist, right-wing populist and anti-immigration marking a departure from the more moderate positions of the majority of members. ==Principles== ECRP adopted the Reykjav\u00edk Declaration at its Council Meeting on 21 March 2014. The declaration defines the principles that underpin ECR. The Reykjav\u00edk Declaration *The European Conservatives and Reformists Party brings together parties committed to individual liberty, national sovereignty, parliamentary democracy, the rule of law, private property, low taxes, sound money, free trade, open competition, and the devolution of power. *ECRP believes in a Europe of independent nations, working together for mutual gain while each retaining its identity and integrity. *ECRP is committed to the equality of all European democracies, whatever their size, and regardless of which international associations they join. *ECRP favours the exercise of power at the lowest practicable level\u2014by the individual where possible, by local or national authorities in preference to supranational bodies. *ECRP understands that open societies rest upon the dignity and autonomy of the individual, who should be as free as possible from state coercion. The liberty of the individual includes freedom of religion and worship, freedom of speech and expression, freedom of movement and association, freedom of contract and employment, and freedom from oppressive, arbitrary or punitive taxation. *ECRP recognises the equality of all citizens before the law, regardless of ethnicity, sex or social class. It rejects all forms of extremism, authoritarianism and racism. *ECRP cherishes the important role of civil associations, families and other bodies that fill the space between the individual and the government. *ECRP acknowledges the unique democratic legitimacy of the nation-state. *ECRP is committed to the spread of free commerce and open competition, in Europe and globally. *ECRP supports the principles of the Prague Declaration of March 2009 and the work of the European Conservatives and Reformists in the European Parliament and allied groups on the other European assemblies. ==Members== As of 2019, the ECRP is composed of members from 29 European nations (shown in dark blue) and regional partners from 10 non-European nations (shown in light blue). ===Member parties=== The following parties listed below are members of the ECRP as of 2020.https://www.acreurope.eu/our_family#parties {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
