    "text": "The U-Tsang Military Commission (Chinese: \u4e4c\u65af\u85cf\u90fd\u6307\u6325\u4f7f\u53f8) was a Chinese administrative position established in central Tibet in 1372, during the Ming dynasty. It was matched in eastern Tibet by the Do-kham Regional Military Commission. Both were subordinate to the Shaanxi Regional Military Commission; or in western Tibet to the Ngari Commanding Tribal Office. Both were deactivated in 1618. Some scholars claim that their existence proves Tibet's suzerainty to China during this period; others that they were nominal agencies, as the reins of government are still under Tibetan aristocrats and monks. ==References== Category:Government of the Ming dynasty Category:14th- century establishments in Tibet Category:China\u2013Tibet relations Category:1372 establishments in Asia Category:1618 disestablishments Category:Military history of the Ming dynasty ",
