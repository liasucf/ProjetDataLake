    "text": "Muppets Tonight is an American live-action/puppet family-oriented television series created by Jim Henson Productions and featuring The Muppets. Much like the \"MuppeTelevision\" segment of The Jim Henson Hour, the show was a continuation of The Muppet Show, set in a television studio rather than a theater. Unlike the original Muppet Show, most episodes of Muppets Tonight featured multiple guest stars. There would usually be one principal guest, but other celebrities would make small walk-on appearances. For example, the Garth Brooks episode features a cameo from Leonard Nimoy. It first ran on ABC from March 8 to July 14, 1996, with reruns on Disney Channel from 1997 to 2000. ==Format== The premise of Muppets Tonight was that Clifford was the host of a variety/talk show on KMUP. The show stuck closely to The Muppet Show format of various skits (mostly featuring the show's human guest star) interspersed with some sort of crisis occurring backstage. ==Characters== ===Returning Muppets=== * Clifford (performed by Kevin Clash) \u2013 Host of the show since no one else wanted the job. Although he was featured with Muppet eyes in this series instead of his sunglasses, he went back to wearing sunglasses for the rest of his appearances. At MuppetFest in 2001, Clash revealed that he disliked the eyes, and would refuse to perform Clifford again unless he was wearing his sunglasses. * Kermit the Frog (performed by Steve Whitmire) \u2013 Producer of the show * Animal (performed by Frank Oz) * Beauregard (performed by Dave Goelz) \u2013 Janitor of KMUP * Bean Bunny (performed by Steve Whitmire) * Behemoth (performed by Bill Barretta) \u2013 Ernst Stavros Grouper's assistant * Dr. Bunsen Honeydew (performed by Dave Goelz) \u2013 The scientist and inventor from Muppet Labs who shows off his inventions on the show * Beaker (performed by Steve Whitmire) \u2013 Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's assistant * Dr. Julius Strangepork (performed by Jerry Nelson) \u2013 Appears in a \"Bay of Pigswatch\" sketch as the lifeguard inspector as seen in the Pierce Brosnan episode * Clueless Morgan (performed by Bill Barretta) \u2013 A goat who previously appeared in Muppet Treasure Island; appears in the \"At the Bar\" sketch co-owning a bar with Polly Lobster * The Elvises (performed by Brian Henson, Jerry Nelson, and Bill Barretta) \u2013 A group of Muppets resembling Elvis Presley that star in \"Great Moments in Elvis History\" * Eugene (performed by Steve Whitmire) \u2013 A mink who serves as Nigel's assistant * George the Janitor (performed by Steve Whitmire) \u2013 Janitor of KMUP * Gonzo the Great (performed by Dave Goelz) \u2013 Does his stunt shows on the show * Fozzie Bear (performed by Frank Oz) * J.P.
