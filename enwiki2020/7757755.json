It can also be attributed to the New Zealand slang 'Tiki-tour' describing taking a longer route to a destination in order to explore. ==History== In 1962, when New Zealander John Anderson was alone and without much money he devised a plan so that he would not have to travel alone and could see Europe for free. He put a deposit on a minibus, gathered a group of people to travel with, and spent 12 weeks exploring Europe with his group. At the end of the trip, he unsuccessfully tried to sell the minibus. As a result, he decided to promote his Europe trip again, and this time he was able to fit two trips into the summer season. The first tours were booked by 19- to 29-year-olds, starting the tradition of Contiki Holidays being for youth travellers. In 1982, the company began offering tours in the United States. In 1984, it expanded to Australia. In 2009, it expanded to Asia. In 2013, it began tours in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Galapagos and in 2015, it expanded to Japan. ==External links== * ==References== Category:1962 establishments in New Zealand Category:Travel and holiday companies of New Zealand ",
