    "text": "Aristide Mugabe (born 11 February 1988) is a Rwandan professional basketball player for Patriots of the National Basketball League. == Early life == Mugabe was born to Theotime Habiryayo and Veneranda Mukamurehe in Maraba, a sector in the Huye District of Rwanda, and was the second born in a family of three boys. He grew up playing football with other children in his neighborhood. In 1994, when Mugabe was six years old, his father, older and younger brothers, and other relatives were killed by the Interahamwe militia in the Rwandan genocide. After their deaths, he frequently moved around to escape the Interahamwe. Eventually, he and his mother were evacuated to Burundi by the humanitarian organization Terre des hommes. The trauma of losing his family members in the genocide caused him to give up sports for the next six years. In 2001, Mugabe started playing basketball after being encouraged by his secondary school, E.A.V. Ntendezi, in the Nyamasheke District. He credits basketball with helping him recover from the genocide. He attended St. Joseph Kabgayi, where he won a high school title and finished third place at the East African secondary school games, before moving to Laiser Hill Academy in Nairobi, Kenya for one year, winning an East Africa secondary school title as its most valuable player (MVP). == Professional career == In 2007, Mugabe made his debut in the National Basketball League, the top-flight league in Rwanda, with Rusizi BBC. Two years later, he joined Rwandan team Espoir BBC. Mugabe also played in the Zone VI Championships qualifiers of the FIBA Africa Clubs Championship with Marine BBC in 2009 and with Cercle Sportif de Kigali (CSK) in 2010. In 2012, Mugabe led Espoir to its first Zone V championship, a qualifier for the 2012 FIBA Africa Clubs Champions Cup, and was named MVP of the National Basketball League after winning the regular season title and playoffs trophy. In 2013, he repeated as MVP after helping Espoir win the regular season title and playoffs trophy. In 2015, Mugabe signed with fellow Kigali-based club Patriots. With the Patriots, he won three consecutive NBL titles in 2017, 2018 and 2019. == National team career == Mugabe has played for the Rwanda national basketball team on several occasions, serving as captain.
