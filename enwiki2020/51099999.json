The Beginning\". ==Plot== ...The cold November of 1796. Empress Catherine the Great who undividedly ruled Russia for 34 years has died. The throne goes back to her son Paul I - a nervous and impetuous middle aged man, who is a captive of his own illusions. Deciding to change almost everything what he inherited from his unloved mother, Paul attracts supporters, one of whom is Count Peter Pahlen. He is an intelligent and calculating courtier who thanks to the boundless trust of the emperor gathers immense power in his hands. Pahlen initially supports Paul's reforms but then the situation changes... The highest nobility in Russia, fueled by the money of England is extremely unhappy with the innovations of Paul I. One after another plots against him are conspired. Distraught by the suspicion directed towards him and fearing for his life, Paul punishes the innocent and the guilty, but this can not save the unfortunate emperor. The main conspiracy against Paul involves his own sons, Alexander and Constantine, and its general command is carried out by Count Pahlen! Paul eventually falls in total despair after he learns of such a comprehensive betrayal, he ceases to resist and the doomed man awaits the conspirators-murderers in his bedroom at the Mikhailovsky Castle ... ==Cast== * Viktor Sukhorukov \u2013 Emperor Paul I of Russia * Oleg Yankovskiy \u2013 Count Pahlen * Oksana Mysina \u2013 Maria Feodorovna, Paul's wife * Yuliya Mavrina \u2013 Anna Lopukhina * Aleksey Barabash \u2013 Alexander, Paul's oldest son * Anna Molchanova \u2013 Elizabeth Alexeievna, Alexander's wife * Yevgeni Karpov \u2013 Konstantin, Paul's son * Igor Shibanov \u2013 Ivan Kutaisov, Paul's valet * Vadim Lobanov \u2013 Alexander Bezborodko * Sergey Barkovsky \u2013 John Rogerson, personal doctor of Catherine the Great * Boris Khvoshnyansky \u2013 Jos\u00e9 de Ribas * Andrey Chumanov \u2013 Platon Zubov * Ivan Parshin \u2013 Valerian Zubov * Sergey Murzin \u2013 Nikolay Zubov * Vera Karpova \u2013 Baroness Livsi * Aleksandr Grigoryants \u2013 Vincenzo Brenna * Dmitriy Sutyrin \u2013 Duke Yashvil ==Awards== *2003 - Kinotavr - M.
