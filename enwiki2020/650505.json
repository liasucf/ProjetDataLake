    "text": "The Bernese Oberland Railway (or correctly translated Bernese Highlands Railway; , BOB) is a narrow-gauge mountain railway in the Bernese Highlands of Switzerland. It runs, via a \"Y\" junction at Zweil\u00fctschinen to serve Interlaken and Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald. The railway is rack assisted (that is although an adhesion railway, rack and pinion operation is used on steep sections of the line to assist traction). The BOB is owned by the Berner Oberland-Bahnen AG, a company that also owns the Schynige Platte Railway. Through that company it is part of the Allianz - Jungfrau Top of Europe marketing alliance, which also includes the separately owned Wengernalpbahn, Jungfraubahn, Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen\u2013M\u00fcrren, Harderbahn, and Firstbahn. ==History== ===Planning=== Share of the Berner-Oberland-Bahnen AG, issued 31. December 1889 The first proposals for the Berner Oberland-Bahn, made in 1873, showed a line from Interlaken (at that time Aarm\u00fchle) to Zweil\u00fctschinen with later options to Lauterbrunnen and Grindlewald with starting point at B\u00f6nigen. Four years later an 80 years concession was obtained for construction and operation of the line and the company, Berner Oberland-Bahnen AG was founded on 2 November 1888 and construction started the following year. ===Failure of the plan to extend to Visp=== In 1897 the company obtained a concession to construct a 54.7 km line from Lauterbrunnen to Visp, with stations at Stechelberg, Steinberg, Oberborn, and Blatten. It would have involved the construction of a 4,650 m tunnel at 2,200 m elevation under the Breithorn mountain. At Visp it would have had a connection with the Simplon line. Estimated at 15 million Swiss francs, finance was not forthcoming and by 1906 the plans were abandoned. ===Initial operations=== By 1 July 1890 the gauge line, was opened, using steam traction. On 18 August 1902 a disastrous fire destroyed the station buildings and goods shed at Grindelwald and these were later rebuilt, surviving to the present day. On 7 October 1908 a new station was added to the system, that at Schwendi on the Grindelwald section. Steam traction on the line came to an end in 1914, the line becoming electrified at 1500 V d.c., overhead supply, on 17 March of that year, although steam locomotives have been used since that date on special services. Several changes were made during the 1950s and 1960s, the two most important being in 1957, the construction of an airfield at Interlaken causing the realignment of the line between Wilderswil and Interlaken Ost, but to no detriment and, with a need for servicing and construction facilities on the line a new depot was opened at Zweil\u00fctschinen in 1968. ===Recent improvements=== A modern low-floor train of the BOB in Grindelwald with the track of the Wengernalpbahn on the adjacent platform. Note the modern blue / yellow BOB livery. Since that time there has been a need for track capacity to be increased and in 1991 the Wilderswil to Gsteigwiler section was substantially improved. This was followed by the doubling of the Gsteigwiler to Zweil\u00fctschinen 4 years later. A bottleneck between Wilderswil and Zweil\u00fctschinen was eased when, in 1999, a 2.5 km. double track section was opened between those places meaning that trains could run through without the need to use the passing loop and, as necessary, awaiting the train in the opposite direction. The BOB has a total length of 23.608 km and is a mixed rack and adhesion railway with four rack and pinion sections, using the Riggenbach rack system, two each on the steep sections of both arms of the line. ===Fatal accident in 2003=== On 7 August 2003 two trains collided head-on on a single track section between Zweil\u00fctschinen and Wilderswil, 1 person was killed and 64 injured.Swiss Info The regular train coming down from Zweil\u00fctschinen had passed a red signal at the end of the double track section and collided with an extra train near Gsteigwiler. Automatic train stop system ZSI-127 had already been in place but not yet in use, awaiting final completion and approval. ==Operations== A train at the Wilderswil station with the track of the Schynige Platte Railway (red train) on the adjacent platform Since 1949 railcars have predominated. Some of the older electric locomotives still survive and are used for special trains. The centre of operations is Zweil\u00fctschinen with the depot headquarters and the modern main workshops. From the introduction of the 1999 timetable, the newly constructed 2.5 km section of dual track between Gsteigwiler and Zweil\u00fctschinen allows trains to pass without one having to wait in a loop, off the main line. This means that a half-hour timetable can be operated with only five train compositions. Since 2005, every composition has been equipped with an articulated (three-part) low-floor driving trailer as standard. Two train compositions are usually coupled together to travel to Zweil\u00fctschinen where they are then split. The front portion travels to Lauterbrunnen, the other one to Grindelwald. The motor coach (power unit) is always positioned on the uphill side, a driving trailer (coach with a driver's cab) being positioned on the downhill side, to avoid any running round manoeuvres at the terminus stations. ===Stations=== {| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse\" |- align=left ! width=\"15%\"|Station ! width=\"10%\"|Distance (km) ! width=\"10%\"|Height (m) ! width=\"65%\"|Information |- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\" |Interlaken Ost||-0.18||567||connections to the Zentralbahn, BLS and Swiss Federal Railways |- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\" |Wilderswil||3.24||584||connections to the Schynige Platte Railway |- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\" |Zweil\u00fctschinen||8.18||652||trains divide with front portion for Lauterbrunnen and the rear portion for Grindelwald |- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\" |Sandweid||10.42||725||Request stop |- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\" |Lauterbrunnen||12.28||795||connections to the Wengernalpbahn for Kleine Scheidegg via Wengen and the Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen- M\u00fcrren to M\u00fcrren |- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\" |Lutschental||12.29||714||Request stop |- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\" |Burglauenen||14.43||896||Request stop |- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\" |Schwendi||16.82||920||Request stop |- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\" |Grindelwald Terminal||18.34||1001||Opened 15 December 2019BOB website - station was to have been called Rottenegg in 2015 plan to serve M\u00e4nnlichen cableway |- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\" |Grindelwald||19.41||1034||connections to the Wengernalpbahn for Kleine Scheidegg |} ==Timetable== The departure board at Sandweid station, showing clock-face scheduling Like all Swiss railways the BOB operates to a clock - face timetable offering connections from the main line at Interlaken and, at its upper terminals, to the Wengernalpbahn. Throughout the year the BOB offers a service every hour in each direction on both its lines, the trains leaving Interlaken Ost coupled together and dividing at Zweil\u00fctschinen. From mid December to late October, additional trains give a 30-minute service frequency in the morning and afternoon. The last services are often timetabled to be operated by buses. ==Locomotives / Railcars== {|class=\"wikitable\" !No. !Name !Class !Seats: 1st/2nd !Builders Details !Date Built !Notes. |- || 1 || || Tm || ||Stadler/Sr/BBC/ MFO/SIG||1946||Rebuilt 1980; 6-cyl/110 kW |- || 21 || || Xm1/2 || ||P&T; ||1979||6-cyl diesel/123 kW |- || 24 || || HGe3/3 || ||SLM/MFO/BBC ||1914||Rebuilt 1940 |- || 29 || || HGe3/3 || ||SLM/MFO ||1926||2013Neues in K\u00fcrze (Nik), Museums- und Touristikbahnen BC in Eisenbahn Amateur (Swiss railway and model railway magazine) 02/2014 page 69 (German) transfer to the Blonay\u2013Chamby museum railway (BC) |- || 31 || || HGm2/2 || ||Steck/Deutz/SLM ||1985|| 6-cyl diesel/296 kW |- || 301 || || ABDeh4/4||10/32||SLM/BBC || 1949 ||Leased to MIB, 1995 scrapped |- || 302 || || ABDeh4/4||10/32||SLM/BBC ||1949||Engineers Dept. |- || 303 || || ABDeh4/4||10/32||SLM/BBC ||1949||Engineers Dept. |- || 304 || || ABeh4/4 ||12/32||SIG/SLM/BBC ||1965||Brown/Cream livery at 9.2007. |- || 305 ||G\u00fcndlischwand|| ABeh4/4 ||12/32||SIG/SLM/BBC ||1965|| Rebuilt 1998 |- || 306 ||L\u00fctschental || ABeh4/4 ||12/32||SIG/SLM/BBC ||1965|| Rebuilt 1997 |- || 307 ||Wilderswil || ABeh4/4 ||12/32||SIG/SLM/BBC ||1965|| Rebuilt 2002 |- || 308 ||Gsteigwiler || ABeh4/4 ||12/32||SIG/SLM/BBC ||1979|| |- || 309 || || ABeh4/4 ||12/32||SIG/SLM/BBC ||1979|| 1999 sold to BZB |- || 310 ||Matten || ABeh4/4 ||12/32||SIG/SLM/BBC ||1979||Rebuilt 2007 |- || 311 ||Grindelwald || ABeh4/4 ||12/24||SLM 5296/BBC ||1986|| |- || 312 ||Interlaken || ABeh4/4 ||12/24||SLM 5297/BBC ||1986|| |- || 313 ||Lauterbrunnen||ABeh4/4 ||12/24||SLM 5298/BBC ||1986|| |- || (321) || ||BDe4/4 || 0/34||SIG/SAAS ||1953|| 2003 ex-CJ No.601*), 2006 sold to LEB No.28**) |- || (322) || ||BDe4/4 || 0/34||SIG/SAAS ||1953|| 2003 ex-CJ No.604*), 2005 sold to MIB No.10 |} * Rebuild 1997-2008 of 304-310 included fitting of equipment for push\u2013pull trains, available from delivery on 311-313 * *) for use on the then-planned but finally not built branch line to Mystery Park * **) arrived on LEB still numbered 601 on 22 February 2006 and was used together with Bt 702 arriving directly from CJ.

Goods stock is a varied collection, much of which would not be out of place in a museum. The earliest wagon shown on the BOB stock list dates from 1888 and was rebuilt by the BOB in 1990. The collection of goods stock totals over 30 assorted wagons, most pre-First World War, many built by SIG and much rebuilt by the BOB over the years. More recently a few additions have been made, most of which are second-hand from CFF/SBB/FFS. The line is home to a snowplough (Series Xrot e) with was built in 1954 by SIG/BBC and rebuilt in 1990 at the BOB workshops. ==Preservation== Several items of rolling stock have been sold (transferred) to metre gauge preserved railways. *Series B, Second class open saloon bogie coaches with 52 seats, numbered 201 and 202, built by SIG in 1930 are preserved by the La Traction group.
