He has represented Comoros at international level. ==Club career== ===Early career in France=== Born in Martigues, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, Abdou started out with his home-town club Martigues, first joining the side when he was seven years old. After progressing through the ranks, Abdou was promoted to the first team in 2002 and spent one season with them, making twenty\u2013six appearances and scoring two times. ===Sedan=== After one season at Martigues, Abdou joined Sedan on 25 July 2003.

It wasn\u2019t until on 6 December 2003 when he made his Sedan debut, starting the whole game, in a 0\u20130 draw against Grenoble Foot 38.

In the 2005\u201306 season, Abdou found himself behind the pecking order in the first team and came on as a substitute bench in number of matches, due to his poor performances. This also combined with his own injury concern. At the end of the 2005\u201306 season, making fifteen appearances, the club was promoted to Ligue 1 after three seasons in Ligue 2. In the 2006\u201307 season, Abdou missed the first half of the season, due to being suspended and playing in the club\u2019s reserve side. It wasn\u2019t until on 18 November 2006 when he made his first Ligue 1 appearance of the season, coming on as a substitute for J\u00e9r\u00f4me Le Moigne in the 49th minutes, and scored an own goal, in a 1\u20130 loss against Olympique Lyonnais.

By September, he regained his first team place, playing in the midfield position. His return performance received praises by Manager Lomas, saying: \"He is a better player than he is given him credit for and he can pass the ball. I keep hearing people say he can\u2019t pass the ball. I watch him in training every day and he can pass the ball. He has bided his time, got in the team and like I\u2019ve said to the lads when you are in the team, keep the shirt.\" Abdou then set up a goal for Scott Malone to score the club\u2019s second goal of the game, in a 2\u20130 win over Leeds United on 28 September 2013.

I\u2019m always on at Jim \u2013 and I\u2019ve known him a long time \u2013 about finishing, finishing, finishing. The way we play and the form we\u2019ve been in over the last 10 months our midfield players should be scoring goals.
