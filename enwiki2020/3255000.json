    "text": "116th Street is a station on the IRT Lenox Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of 116th Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem, it is served by the 2 and 3 trains at all times. ==History== This station opened just after midnight on November 23, 1904, as part of the IRT's original system. It was completed along with the rest of the IRT Lenox Avenue Line, then known as the East Side Subway or East Side Branch, south of 145th Street. Starting on March 2, 1998, the tunnel was reconstructed along with the cracked tunnel floor, and the 116th Street station was closed for a complete renovation. This was done to correct a major water problem that had existed for many years due to the presence of the Harlem Creek and other underground streams, which caused extensive flooding, water damage, and seepage problems that occasionally contributed to severe service disruptions. The project cost $82 million and was finished on October 12, 1998. During the reconstruction, many trains were rerouted via the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, while the trains were rerouted to the 137th Street\u2013City College station on the IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line. Each of the two Lenox Avenue Line tracks were alternately taken out of service and supplemental shuttle bus service connecting to other lines in the area were provided for much of this time. ==Station layout== {|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50|G |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Street level |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=475|Exit/entrance |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=4 valign=top|P Platform level |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\" colspan=2|Side platform |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Northbound |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 toward () \u2190 toward () |- |Southbound | toward () \u2192 toward ( late nights) () \u2192 |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border- top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Side platform |} The station has two tracks and two side platforms. It features extensive mosaics featuring Harlem history and famous African-Americans. It was fully renovated as part of the 1998 Lenox Avenue subway reconstruction project. Fare control is at platform level. There are no crossovers or crossunders between the two side platforms to allow free transfer between directions. The reconstruction project gave this station all new wall tiling and restored the \"116\" terra cotta wall cartouches. It also combatted a major water seepage problem along the Lenox Avenue Line. The artworks here are Minton's Playhouse on the uptown platform, and Movers and Shakers on the downtown platform (both by Vincent Smith, 1999). ===Exits=== * One stair, NW corner of Lenox Avenue and West 116th Street (southbound only) * One stair, SW corner of Lenox Avenue and West 116th Street (southbound only) * One stair, NE corner of Lenox Avenue and West 116th Street (northbound only) * One stair, SE corner of Lenox Avenue and West 116th Street (northbound only) == References == == External links == * * nycsubway.org \u2014 Minton's Playhouse/Movers and Shakers Artwork by Vincent Smith (1999) * Station Reporter \u2014 2 Train * Station Reporter \u2014 3 Train * The Subway Nut \u2014 116th Street Pictures * MTA's Arts For Transit \u2014 116th Street (IRT Lenox Avenue Line) * 116th Street entrance from Google Maps Street View * Platforms from Google Maps Street View Category:1904 establishments in New York (state) Category:Harlem Category:IRT Lenox Avenue Line stations Category:New York City Subway stations in Manhattan Category:New York City Subway stations located underground Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1904 ",
