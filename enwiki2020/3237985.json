It is an almost exclusively residential area, the great majority of its housing stock having been built in the late 1940s and early 1950s, by a consortium of five Ottawa area developers. Prior to its development, much of the land was slightly marshy treed area, used as riding trails stemming from nearby Mile Circle as well as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police stables, which remain nearby, and are the home of the Musical Ride. It is well treed, with some notable white pines scattered throughout. A small pocket park is named Vincent Anthony park, after a former Canadian diplomat. Notable local institutions include Manor Park Public School, and St Columba Anglican Church. ==See also== *List of Ottawa neighbourhoods ==References== * Category:Neighbourhoods in Ottawa ",
