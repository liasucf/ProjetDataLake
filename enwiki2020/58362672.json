University of Toronto Press, 2004. p. 220 It is the first of what writer George Melnyk calls a trilogy which concludes with Kitchen Party (1998) and waydowntown (2000). ==Plot== Bob and Al are passing time by driving around and looking for marijuana. In another part of town, two other young men, Eric and Carl, are also trying to buy drugs. A group of three musicians are at a Middle Eastern restaurant. They go to the suburbs to find a relative after they accidentally get their instruments locked up in an apartment. Carl starts a fight with a novelist and Eric almost gets arrested for drugs in a police raid and then Eric starts a fight with the musicians. Carl and Bob steal some drugs. ==Cast== *Bob Stephen Spender as Bob *Joel McNichol as Al *Jacob Banigan as Eric *Stewart Burdett as Carl Musicians: * Jihad Traya * Ahmad Taha * Rogy Masri ==Reception== Variety noted the \"sharp editing and tight control of actors\" and the use of \"[b]leached colors, oblique camera angles and bargain-basement lighting\". The film, which was aimed at male Generation X viewers, showed the unromantic drabness and pettiness of life in the suburbs in Western Canada, a stark contrast to the majestic mountains often shown in postcards. ==References== Category:1995 films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian drama road movies Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Gary Burns Category:Films shot in Alberta Category:Films set in Alberta Category:1990s drama road movies ",
