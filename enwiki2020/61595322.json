During pre-season training for the 2020 NRL season, Smith suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury during a contact session. Sydney Roosters head coach Trent Robinson confirmed the injury saying \u201cIt\u2019s Billy\u2019s other knee and it\u2019s an ACL, One of the doctors was telling me a stat where once you suffer one ACL injury you\u2019re then a 25 per cent chance of doing the other knee inside two years if you\u2019re under 21. We\u2019re all feeling for Billy, there was a big opportunity there for him but the type of person he is he\u2019ll fight back from this\". Smith was widely tipped to start the year at centre after the departure of Latrell Mitchell. ==References== ==External links== *Sydney Roosters profile Category:1999 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Sydney Roosters players Category:Rugby league centres Category:North Sydney Bears NSW Cup players Category:Living people Category:People from Sydney ",
