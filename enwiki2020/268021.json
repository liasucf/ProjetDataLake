    "text": "Mariehamn (; ) is the capital of the \u00c5land Islands, an autonomous territory under Finnish sovereignty. Mariehamn is the seat of the Government and Parliament of \u00c5land, and 40% of the population of \u00c5land live in the city. It is mostly surrounded by Jomala, the second largest municipality in \u00c5land in terms of population; to the east it is bordered by Lemland. Like all of \u00c5land, Mariehamn is unilingually Swedish-speaking and around of the inhabitants speak it as their native language. == History == S\u00f6dragatan, one of the oldest streets of Mariehamn. The town was named after the Russian empress Maria Alexandrovna. Mariehamn was founded in 1861, around the village of \u00d6vern\u00e4s, in what was at the time part of the municipality of Jomala. The city has since expanded and incorporated more of Jomala territory. Mariehamn was built according to a very regular scheme which is well-preserved. One of the oldest streets is S\u00f6dragatan where many wooden houses dating from the 19th century can be seen. Following the First World War Mariehamn was home to the Mariehamn Grain Fleet. == Transportation == === Harbours === Pommern is anchored in the western of Mariehamn's two harbours, V\u00e4sterhamn. The city is located on a peninsula. It has two important harbours, one located on the western shore and one on the eastern shore, which are ice-free for nearly the whole year, and have no tides. The Western Harbour is an important international harbour with daily traffic to Sweden, Estonia and mainland Finland. A powerful incentive for Baltic ferries to stop at Mariehamn is that, with respect to indirect taxation, \u00c5land is not part of the EU customs zone and so duty-free goods can be sold aboard. \u00c5land and Mariehamn have a reputable heritage in shipping. The Flying P-Liner Pommern museum ship is anchored in the Western Harbour. The Eastern Harbour features one of the largest marinas in Scandinavia. The famous Dutch steamer Jan Nieveen (now called F.P. von Knorring, after \u00c5land teacher and vicar Frans Peter von Knorring) can also be found here. === Airport === Mariehamn Airport serves the city; it has scheduled flights on two airlines including Finnair. == Culture == Municipal library The city is an important centre for \u00c5land media; both of the local newspapers (\u00c5landstidningen and Nya \u00c5land), several radio stations and the local TV channels (TV \u00c5land and \u00c5land24) operate out of the city. The islanders are traditionally fond of reading, and had public libraries before 1920. A printing works was established in the town in 1891. The municipal library, which was built in 1989, is one of the most interesting modern buildings. == Architecture == Nordea bank office in Mariehamn Saint George's church Mariehamn features several buildings drawn by Finnish architect Lars Sonck, who moved to \u00c5land as a child. Buildings drawn by him include the church of Mariehamn (1927), the main building of the \u00c5land Maritime College (1927) and the town hall (1939). Hilda Hongell also designed several buildings, although only a few are still standing. == Demographics == A chart on population increase. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-left:60px\" |- !rowspan=1| Year !rowspan=1| Population |- |- | 1987 ||align=left | 9,966 |- | 1990 ||align=left | 10,263 |- | 1997 ||align=left | 10,408 |- | 2000 ||align=left | 10,488 |- | 2002 ||align=left | 10,632 |- | 2004 ||align=left | 10,712 |- | 2006 ||align=left | 10,824 |- | 2008 ||align=left | 11,005 |- | 2009 ||align=left | 11,123 |- | 2010 ||align=left | 11,190 |- | 2011 ||align=left | 11,262 |- | 2012 ||align=left | 11,346 |- | 2013 ||align=left | 11,393 |- | 2014 ||align=left | 11,480 |- | 2015 ||align=left | 11,461 |- | 2016 ||align=left | 11,565 |- | 2017 ||align=left | 11,677 |- | 2018 ||align=left | 11,743 |} {| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:center;\" ! style=\"text- align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | People with a foreign background |- !

This renders summers to be cooler than both the Swedish and Finnish mainlands, with winters being similar in cold to the adjacent coastal part of Sweden but milder than Finland's mainland. The lowest temperature at Mariehamn airport was -32.9 C (-27.2F) in February 1979, and the highest temperature on record was 31.3 C (88.3F) in July 1941.https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/15734/2009nro8.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y ==Twin towns and sister cities== Mariehamn is twinned with:Mariehamns stads v\u00e4norter.
