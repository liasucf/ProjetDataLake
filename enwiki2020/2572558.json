    "text": "The Slovak koruna or Slovak crown (, literally meaning Slovak crown) was the currency of Slovakia between 8 February 1993 and 31 December 2008, and could be used for cash payment until 16 January 2009. The ISO 4217 code was SKK and the local abbreviation was Sk. The koruna was subdivided into 100 haliers (abbreviated as \"hal.\" or simply \"h\", singular: halier). The abbreviation is placed after the numeric value. Slovakia switched its currency from the koruna to the euro on 1 January 2009, at a rate of 30.1260 korunas per euro. In the Slovak language, the nouns \"koruna\" and \"halier\" both assume two plural forms. \"Koruny\"CIA - The World Factbook -- Slovakia. 15 May 2007; accessed 19 May 2007. and \"haliere\" appears after the numbers 2, 3 and 4 and in generic (uncountable) context, with \"kor\u00fan\" and \"halierov\" being used after other numbers. The latter forms also correspond to genitive use in plural. ==Modern koruna== In 1993, the newly independent Slovakia introduced its own koruna, replacing the Czechoslovak koruna at par. ===Coins=== Svk-10 hal-01.png Svk-20 hal-01.png SK 50h93 a.png SK 50h96 a.png SK 1k93 a.png SK 2k93 a.png SK 5k93 a.png SK 10k93 a.png In 1993, coins were introduced in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 haliers, 1, 2, 5 and 10 korunas. The 10- and 20-halier coins were taken out of circulation on 31 December 2003. In 1996 the 50-halier coin was made smaller and instead of aluminium it was made with copper plated steel. The obverse of the coins feature the coat of arms of Slovakia, with motifs from Slovak history on the reverses. *10 halierov (silver-coloured) \u2013 Octagonal wooden belfry from Zempl\u00edn (early 19th century) = \u20ac0.0033 *20 halierov (silver-coloured) \u2013 the Kriv\u00e1\u0148 peak in the High Tatras = \u20ac0.0066 *50 halierov (copper-coloured) \u2013 Renaissance polygonal tower of Dev\u00edn Castle = \u20ac0.0166 *1 koruna (copper-coloured) \u2013 Gothic wooden sculpture of the Madonna with child ( 1500) = \u20ac0.0332 *2 koruny (silver-coloured) \u2013 Earthen sculpture of the sitting Venus of Hradok (4th millennium BC) = \u20ac0.0664 *5 kor\u00fan (silver- coloured) \u2013 Reverse of a Celtic coin of Biatec (1st century BC) = \u20ac0.166 *10 kor\u00fan (copper-coloured) \u2013 Bronze cross (11th century A.D.) = \u20ac0.332 Coins were exchangeable for euros at the National Bank of Slovakia until January 2, 2014. ===Banknotes=== At midnight on 31 December 1992, the Czechoslovak Republic bifurcated into the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. In 1993, the newly independent Slovakia introduced its own koruna, replacing the Czechoslovak koruna at par. Provisional banknotes were issued in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 kor\u00fan by affixing stamps bearing the coat of arms of Slovakia and the denomination to Czechoslovak banknotes. The main motifs on the obverses of the banknotes represent important people living in the territory of the present Slovakia in various historical eras. On the reverses, these motifs are completed by depicting places where these people lived and were active. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\" |- !Denomination !Dimensions (millimetres) !Value in euros (\u20ac) !colspan=\"2\" | Image ! colspan=\"2\" |Main colour !Obverse !Reverse !Remark |- !20 kor\u00fan |128 x 65 |\u20ac0.66 |centre |centre |style=\"background:#19E119\"| |Green |Prince Pribina |Nitra/Neutra Castle | |- !50 kor\u00fan |134 x 68 |\u20ac1.66 |centre |centre |style=\"background:#1199FF\"| |Blue |Saints Cyril and Methodius |Dra\u017eovce church and the first seven letters of the Glagolitic alphabet | |- !100 kor\u00fan |140 x 71 |\u20ac3.32 |centre |centre |style=\"background:#FF5757\"| |Red |Madonna at Levo\u010da church |St. Jacob's church in Levo\u010da/Leutschau and city hall | |- !200 kor\u00fan |146 x 74 |\u20ac6.64 |centre |centre |style=\"background:#00C0F0\"| |Turquoise |Anton Bernol\u00e1k (1762 - 1813), linguist and Catholic priest |Trnava in the 18th century |Introduced in 1995 |- !500 kor\u00fan |152 x 77 |\u20ac16.60 |centre |centre |style=\"background:#996633\"| |Brown |\u013dudov\u00edt \u0160t\u00far (1815 - 1856), leader of the Slovak national revival |Bratislava Castle and St. Michaels church | |- !1000 kor\u00fan |158 x 80 |\u20ac33.19 |centre |centre |style=\"background:#B14AD6\"| |Purple |Andrej Hlinka (1864 - 1938), politician and Catholic priest |Madonna of Liptovk\u00e9 Sliace/Liptau church; St. Andrew's church in Ru\u017eomberok | |- !5000 kor\u00fan |164 x 82 |\u20ac165.97 |centre |centre |style=\"background:#FFAA22\"| |Orange |Milan Rastislav \u0160tef\u00e1nik (1880 - 1919), politician and diplomat |Stefanik's grave on Bradlo Hill: Ursa Major constellation |Introduced in 1994 |- |colspan=\"10\"| |} Slovak banknotes denominated in koruny can be exchanged for euros indefinitely. ===Historical exchange rates=== Historical exchange rates from 1999 The graph shows the value of the euro in korunas from 1999 to December 2008. As may be seen, the currency strengthened as Slovakia's economy did. The koruna joined the ERM II on 28 November 2005 at the rate of \u20ac = 38.4550 Sk with a 15% band. On 17 March 2007, this rate was readjusted to 35.4424 Sk with the same band, an 8.5% increase in the value of the koruna. On the same day, 1 euro traded at 33.959 Sk. The central rate of koruna was then adjusted once more on 28 May 2008 to 33.8545 with no change in the band. ==See also== * Czechoslovak koruna * Czech koruna * Economy of Slovakia * Slovak euro coins ==Notes== ==References== * * * ==External links== *ECB: The euro cash changeover in Slovakia (as of 1 January 2009) *, , (History of the Slovak koruna/crown and its predecessors at the website of the National Bank of Slovakia, parts 1, 2, 3) *The banknotes of Slovakia Category:Currencies of Europe Category:Currencies replaced by the euro Category:Currencies of Slovakia Category:Modern obsolete currencies Category:Banknotes of Europe Category:Currency symbols ",
