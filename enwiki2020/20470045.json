    "text": "The 2000 United States Senate election in Michigan was held on November 7, 2000. Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Spencer Abraham ran for re-election to a second term, but was defeated by his Democratic opponent, congresswoman Debbie Stabenow. Stabenow subsequently made history as the first woman to represent Michigan in the U.S. Senate. == Candidates == === Democratic === * Debbie Stabenow, U.S. Representative === Republican === * Spencer Abraham, incumbent U.S. Senator === Green === * Matthew Abel === Libertarian === * Michael Corliss === Reform === * Mark Forton === Constitution === * John Mangopoulos === Natural Law === * William Quarton == Campaign == Abraham, who was first elected in the 1994 Republican Revolution despite never running for public office before, was considered vulnerable by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Major issues in the campaign included prescription drugs for the elderly. By September 4, Abraham still had failed to reach 50% in polls despite having spent over $6 million on television ads. In mid-October, he came back and reached 50% and 49% in two polls respectively.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dz8iAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=sqwFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3886,3871152&dq;=debbie+stabenow&hl;=en ===Debates=== *Complete video of debate, October 22, 2000 == Results == The election was very close with Stabenow prevailing by just over 67,000 votes. Stabenow was also likely helped by the fact that Vice President Al Gore won Michigan on the presidential level. Ultimately, Stabenow pulled out huge numbers out of the Democratic stronghold of Wayne County, which covers the Detroit Metropolitan Area. Stabenow also performed well in other heavily populated areas such as Ingham County home to the state's capital of Lansing, and the college town of Ann Arbor. Abraham did not concede right after major news networks declared Stabenow the winner; He held out hope that the few outstanding precincts could push him over the edge. At 4:00AM, Abraham conceded defeat. Senator Abraham called Stabenow and congratulated her on her victory. A historic election, Stabenow became the first woman to represent Michigan in the United States Senate. == See also == * 2000 United States Senate elections == References == 2000 Michigan Category:2000 Michigan elections ",
