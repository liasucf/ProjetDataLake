    "text": "The Hmar language or Khawsak \u1e6dawng belongs to the Kukish branch of the Sino- Tibetan family of languages. The speakers of the language are also known as Hmar. According to the official 2011 Census of India, there are 50,561 Hmar/Khawsak speakers in Assam, 48,375 in Manipur, 69,175 in Tripura, 1,700 in Meghalaya, 29,587 in Mizoram although Majority of the Hmars in Mizoram speak Duhlian (Mizo). Hmar/Khawsak is a recognised language in the School curriculum of Assam, Manipur and Mizoram, and also recently recognised as one of the Modern Indian Language (MIL) at Manipur University. Board of Secondary Education, Assam has also included Hmar(Khawsak dialect) as an MIL in its matriculation syllabus from 2005. Both Manipur University and Assam University, Silchar has also permitted Khawsak Hmar language to be studied as Modern Indian Language in the Graduation level. ==Geographical distribution== Khawsak dialect of Hmar is spoken in the following locations *Assam: Dima Hasao district (formerly North Cachar district), Karbi Anglong district, Barak Valley (Hailakandi district, Karimganj district and Cachar district) *Manipur: Pherzawl district, Churachandpur district, Jiribam district, Imphal and Moreh *Mizoram: Aizawl district, Champhai district and Kolasib district *Tripura: In and around Darchawi and Jampui Hills *Meghalaya: Shillong and Khaddum village *Myanmar: Tamu *Bangladesh: Bawm Since Hmar speakers are scattered over a vast area in Mizoram, Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, Chittagong Hill tracts, NC Hills and Cachar district of Assam state and Myanmar, there appears to be slight dialectal distinction. There is no homogeneous settlement of Hmar speakers alone. In Manipur, Hmar exhibits partial mutual intelligibility with the other Kukish dialects of the area including Thadou, Paite, Vaiphei, Simte, Kom and Gangte languages. ==References== ==External links== * VIRTHL-Ushering Change: News & Info House of the Hmars Visit Site *Hmar R\u00fbnpui : Hmar Social Networking Visit Site *Manipur Online The Unresolved Issues of the Hmar *Hmar.in *Hmarram.com *Sinlung News Category:Languages of India Category:Kukish languages Category:Languages of Assam Category:Languages of Manipur Category:Languages of Mizoram Category:Endangered Indian languages Category:Languages of Tripura ",
