Baron, Public Policy Considerations Warranting Denial of Reimbursement to ERISA Plans, 55 Mercer Law Review 595 (2004). of a Participant or BeneficiaryThe term \u201cparticipant\u201d is defined in 29 U.S.C. 1002 (7) and generally encompasses employees and former employees. The term beneficiary\u201d is defined in 29 U.S.C. 1002(8) as \u201ca person designated by a participant or by the terms of an employee benefit plan, who is or may become entitled to benefit thereunder.\u201d of the ERISA Plan. The concept of \u201creimbursement\u201d can be traced to the traditional doctrine of \u201cSubrogation,\u201d but it exists today without the traditional safeguards established in the development of the law concerning subrogation. When an insurer pays a claim to an insured, the insurer generally has the right to \u201cstep in the shoes\u201d of the insured for the purpose of recapturing that money by pursuing a claim against the tortfeasor who may be liable for the loss.Roger M. Baron, Subrogation: A Pandora's Box Awaiting Closure, 41 South Dakota Law Review 237, 238 (1996). An ERISA plan's \u201cright of reimbursement\u201d is essentially a subrogation claim. Although there are subtle legal distinctions between \u201csubrogation\u201d and \u201creimbursement,\u201d these devices are essentially the same. Unfortunately, there is little or no oversight on the ability of ERISA Plans (and their insurers) to pursue reimbursement claims. Historically, subrogation actions were limited at common law to matters involving property damage claims, with subrogation on personal injury claims being specifically prohibited.Roger M. Baron, Subrogation on Medical Expense Claims: The \"Double Recovery\" Myth and the Feasibility of Anti-Subrogation Laws, 96 Dickinson Law Review 581, 583, notes 11-12 and accompanying text (1992). Authority for \u201cERISA reimbursement\" claims is attributed to federal preemption under the auspices of ERISA which was enacted in 1974. At the time ERISA was enacted by Congress, however, subrogation for health insurers was uniformly prohibited in the United States. Such claims were deemed unlawful in all jurisdictions. The first reported judicial decision involving an effort of a health insurer to seek subrogation on a personal injury claim is the 1982 decision in Frost v. Porter Leasing Corp., 436 N.E.2d 387 (Mass. 1982) in which subrogation was denied. \u201cERISA reimbursement\u201d claims began arising in the late 1980s and have been resisted by some federal courts.David M. Kono, Unraveling the Liningh of ERISA Health Insurer Pockets \u2013 A Vote for the National Federal Common Law Adoption of the Make Whole Doctrine, 2000 BYU L.Rev. 427 (2000). Roger M. Baron, Public Policy Considerations Warranting Denial of Reimbursement to ERISA Plans, 55 Mercer Law Review 595 (2004). According to industry statistics, ERISA plans and related insurers are collecting close to $1 billion per year through the seizure of tort recoveries or other contractual payments received by insured personal injury victims.\u201cOne of the largest private healthcare claims recovery services in the United States recovered $239.9 million in health claims in 2003. See Trover Solutions, Inc., Form 10-K (FY 2003) at 29. Based on the recoveries made by this service, it is estimated that more than $1 billion is recovered annually on behalf of all plans.\u201d 2006 WL 467695, at footnote 37, page 15. Quoted material is taken from Amicus Brief filed by the US Chamber of Commerce, found in Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc, 126 S.Ct. 1869, 74 USLW 4240, 164 L.Ed.2d 612, (May 15, 2006). The plans tend to pursue reimbursement on a \"first dollar priority\" basis in order to maintain steady insurance premiums for their members. == References == Category:1974 in law Reimbursement ",
