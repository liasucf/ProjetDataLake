    "text": "The William Mowry House is an historic farm house on Farnum Pike in North Smithfield, Rhode Island. It is a 2-1/2 story plank-framed house, five bays wide, with a gable roof and a large central chimney. The main entrance is centered on the main (south-facing) entry, and is enclosed within a single- story hip-roof vestibule of 20th-century construction. A small single-story ell extends to the west of the main block. The interior follows a typical center-chimney plan, with the kitchen and parlor in the front of the house, and the dining room flanked by a small pantry and bathroom in the rear. The house was built c. 1802-05 by William Mowry, whose family has owned land in the area since the 17th century. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Providence County, Rhode Island ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Rhode Island Category:Houses completed in 1805 Category:Houses in Providence County, Rhode Island Category:Federal architecture in Rhode Island Category:North Smithfield, Rhode Island Category:1805 establishments in Rhode Island Category:National Register of Historic Places in Providence County, Rhode Island ",
