    "text": "A mans\u01ebngr (literally 'maiden-song'; plural mans\u01ebngvar; modern Icelandic mans\u00f6ngur, plural mans\u00f6ngvar) is a form of Icelandic poetry. In scholarly usage the term has often been applied to medieval skaldic love-poetry; and it is used of lyric openings to r\u00edmur throughout the Icelandic literary tradition. ==In high-medieval Iceland== Skaldic love-poetry and erotic poems in Old Norse-Icelandic are often characterised in modern scholarship as mans\u00f6ngvar. However, Edith Marold and Bjarni Einarsson have argued that the term mans\u00f6ngr has been over-used in medieval scholarship, being applied to love-poems which we have no evidence were actually viewed as mans\u00f6ngvar.Edith Marold, ' Mans\u01ebngr \u2014 a Phantom Genre?', trans. by Kate Heslop, in Learning and Understanding in the Old Norse World: Essays in Honour of Margaret Clunies Ross, ed. by Judy Quinn, Tarrin Wills, and Kate Heslop, Medieval Texts and Cultures of Northern Europe, 18 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2007), pp. 239-62; Bjarni Einarsson, \u2018\"Mans\u00f6ngr\" revisited\u2019, Opuscula, 11 (2003) [=Bibliotheca Arnamagn\u00e6ana, 42]. Many medieval references to mans\u00f6ngvar are not accompanied by the poem in question, and the boundaries of the genre are thus disputed. The Icelandic Homily Book (from c. 1200) mentions mans\u00f6ngr in connection with the music of David and Solomon. === In Icelandic sagas === In Egils saga, the poet Egill Skallagr\u00edmsson recites a poem about a woman to his friend Arinbj\u00f6rn. Arinbj\u00f6rn asks Egill for whom he has composed this mans\u00f6ngr and Egill recites another poem before revealing that the subject of both is Arinbj\u00f6rn's kinswoman \u00c1sger\u00f0r, the widow of Egill's brother \u00de\u00f3r\u00f3lfr (Thorolf).The dialogue between Egill and Arinbj\u00f6rn is first preserved in the 'theta fragment' of Egils saga (AM 162 A \u03b8 fol.) from c. 1250. Egill requests Arinbj\u00f6rn's help in arranging his marriage with \u00c1sger\u00f0r, and the mans\u00f6ngvar are thus a prelude to an open declaration of love and a marriage petition. Hallfre\u00f0r vandr\u00e6\u00f0ask\u00e1ld's poems to Kolfinna \u00c1valdad\u00f3ttir are also described as mans\u00f6ngvar in Hallfre\u00f0ar saga, but the saga depicts Hallfre\u00f0r as resisting attempts to organise Kolfinna's marriage to both himself and other men. The saga portrays Hallfre\u00f0r's erotic poetry about Kolfinna and his libellous verses on Kolfinna's husband, Gr\u00eds, as destructive in nature\u2014objectifying Kolfinna while inciting her family to violence. Only through his relationship with his King \u00d3lafr Tryggvason (his eventual godfather) and his spiritual poems does Hallfre\u00f0r find redemption and maturity and eventually express regret for the sorrow he has caused Kolfinna.Ingibj\u00f6rg G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir, \u201eKrist vil ek allrar \u00e1star....\u201c Um e\u00f0li Hallfre\u00f0ar s\u00f6gu vandr\u00e6\u00f0ask\u00e1lds, University of Iceland, BA Thesis in Icelandic Literature, 2008. One of the oldest saga manuscripts to preserve a reference to the genre is DGThe De La Gardie Collection in Uppsala University Library 8 from c. 1225\u20131250 in the hagiographical saga \u00d3l\u00e1fs saga helga. According to the saga, the Icelandic skald \u00d3ttarr svarti composed a mans\u01ebngsdr\u00e1pa about Queen \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0r of Norway when they were both in the court of her father, the King of Sweden. This dr\u00e1pa provoked the wrath of her husband, King \u00d3lafr Helgason, but when \u00d3ttarr travelled to Norway he prudently enlisted the help of his uncle and skald Sigvatr \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson to gain an audience with the Norwegian king and redeem himself with the poem H\u01ebfu\u00f0lausn, which praises the merits of King \u00d3lafr rather than the beauty of his wife. === In Icelandic law === The composing of mans\u00f6ngvar for or about women is explicitly prohibited by the medieval Icelandic law-code Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s, 'in the younger additions to Konungsb\u00f3k (GKS 1157 fol) and Sta\u00f0arh\u00f3lsb\u00f3k (AM 334 fol), where it is inserted into a passage bearing the title 'vm scaldscap' ('on poetry'), an exhaustive treatment of the different kinds of poetry and the various punishments for them'.Edith Marold, ' Mans\u01ebngr \u2014 a Phantom Genre?', trans. by Kate Heslop, in Learning and Understanding in the Old Norse World: Essays in Honour of Margaret Clunies Ross, ed. by Judy Quinn, Tarrin Wills, and Kate Heslop, Medieval Texts and Cultures of Northern Europe, 18 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2007), pp. 239-62 (pp. 249-50). But there is no clear explanation of what a mans\u00f6ngr is. In the Konungsb\u00f3k version, \u00a7238, the text readsText and translation quoted from Edith Marold, ' Mans\u01ebngr \u2014 a Phantom Genre?', trans. by Kate Heslop, in Learning and Understanding in the Old Norse World: Essays in Honour of Margaret Clunies Ross, ed. by Judy Quinn, Tarrin Wills, and Kate Heslop, Medieval Texts and Cultures of Northern Europe, 18 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2007), pp. 239-62 (p. 249); she quotes the text from Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s: Isl\u00e6ndernes lovbog i fristatens tid, udg. efter det kongelige Bibliotheks Haanskrift, ed. and trans. by Vilhj\u00e1lmur Finsen, 2 vols (Copenhagen: Berling, 1852), Ib, 184.

The mans\u00f6ngur typically shares a metre with the r\u00edma it prefaces but is lyric poetry rather than narrative and the poet often speaks in the first person, addressing the audience directly. The mans\u00f6ngur is often addressed to a woman but known as mans\u00f6ngr even when it isn't. The mans\u00f6ngur may or may not relate to the main narrative of the r\u00edmur: some poets use the mans\u00f6ngur to comment on the events of the story as they unfold or explore specific narrative themes, but others treat the mans\u00f6ngur as a 'break from the action'. The earliest r\u00edmur lack mans\u00f6ngvar. In later r\u00edmur, the author (usually male) would compose poetry about a woman he had fallen in love with (but who generally is not depicted as reciprocating his feelings). Accordingly, mans\u00f6ngvar are often sorrowful. Later, they started to feature other topics, such as love for one's ancestral estate or complaints at how few people appreciate poetry.V\u00e9steinn \u00d3lason, 'Old Icelandic Poetry', in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. by Daisy Nejmann, Histories of Scandinavian Literature, 5 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2006), pp. 1-63 (pp. 55-59). One example of the content of a mans\u00f6ngur is afforded by Craigie's summary of stanzas 1-17 of the third r\u00edma of Skotlands r\u00edmur by Einar Gu\u00f0mundsson, a 17th-century poet. It includes many of the classical features of the mans\u00f6ngur in r\u00edmur: a fair woman is addressed, while the poet laments his inadequacy as a poet and the sorrowful state of the world. The mans\u00f6ngur is also a platform for personal expression\u2014here, probably, a (veiled) complaint over losing his position as the minister for Sta\u00f0ur in Reykjanes in 1635 after accusing two parishioners of sorcery: > Though the ring-decked maiden might wish for a love-song, I have but little > poetry from Odin. Only a little scent of the fruit of song he gave me once: > I have no need to be grateful for his generosity. Let those rejoice who have > been more successful. Friendship is not shown to every man, and I was never > good at winning favour of the great. True friendship is rare over all the > land; most men look for some advantage and are envious of all others who get > wealth or fame. Seek not, then, to be praised by the world: disgrace and > loss may follow. He that sees in secret will reward you, and He will come > one day to sit in judgement.
