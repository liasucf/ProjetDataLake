    "text": "SABC Encore was a 24-hour free-to-air digital satellite and digital terrestrial television retro rerun channel created and owned by the South African Broadcasting Corporation, as a carriage deal between the SABC and Multichoice. This channel stopped airing at midnight on 1 June 2020 after MultiChoice's decision not to renew the channel once its contract had come to an end. ==History== The channel first came up as SABC Africa until it was discontinued back in 2008 in which it was not viable due to poor performance. SABC signed a 5 year agreement with MultiChoice and in that agreement it included a news channel which launched in 2013 and entertainment channel which was delayed due to the switch from analogue to digital television. The channel was set to launch by the end of 2014 under the name SABC Entertainment which never materialized at the time. In 2015, SABC Encore launched on DStv through the family package and a few weeks later on the Easyview package. On 20 May 2020, it was announced that a longstanding partner of the MultiChoice Group, the channel will be ceasing broadcast in Africa at 00:30 on 1 June 2020 and it will no longer available from 1 June of that year. It was revealed by SABC that both parties ended their agreement back in 2018 and that the agreement was non-renewable and gave the channel a 2 year extension. Even though the channel is discontinued SABC mentioned they are looking at ways to possibly continue the channel through another platform.SABC says its SABC Encore channel on DStv wasn't axed over its failure to pay artists residuals but that MultiChoice in 2018 already decided to can the channel in 2020. ==Programming== The terminated channel showcased vintage South African comedies, dramas, kiddies and lifestyle shows from the 1980s and 1990s, including iconic titles such as 'Sgudi 'Snaysi, Agter Elke Man, Interster, Ubambo Lwami, Pumpkin Patch, Haas Das en Nuuskas, Dikolong and Hlala Kwabafileyo, among many others. ==See also== ==References== Category:Television in South Africa ",
