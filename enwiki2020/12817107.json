    "text": "In mathematics, Ono's inequality is a theorem about triangles in the Euclidean plane. In its original form, as conjectured by T. Ono in 1914, the inequality is actually false; however, the statement is true for acute triangles and right triangles, as shown by F. Balitrand in 1916. ==Statement of the inequality== Consider an acute or right triangle in the Euclidean plane with side lengths a, b and c and area A. Then :27 (b^2 + c^2 - a^2)^2 (c^2 + a^2 - b^2)^2 (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)^2 \\leq (4 A)^6. This inequality fails for general triangles (to which Ono's original conjecture applied), as shown by the counterexample a=2, \\, \\, b=3, \\, \\, c=4, \\, \\, A=3\\sqrt{15}/4. The inequality holds with equality in the case of an equilateral triangle, in which up to similarity we have sides 1,1,1 and area \\sqrt{3}/4. ==See also== *List of triangle inequalities ==References== * * * ==External links== * Category:Disproved conjectures Category:Triangle geometry Category:Geometric inequalities ",
