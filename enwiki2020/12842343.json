    "text": "Ceyx is an Old World genus of river kingfishers. These kingfishers are found from South East Asia to the Solomon Islands. The genus was introduced by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de in 1799. The type species is the oriental dwarf kingfisher (Ceyx erithraca). A molecular phylogenetic study of the alcedinine kingfishers published in 2007 found that the genera as then defined did not form monophyletic groups. The species were subsequently rearranged into four monophyletic genera. The little kingfisher, azure kingfisher, Bismarck kingfisher, silvery kingfisher and Indigo-banded kingfisher were moved from Alcedo to Ceyx. All except one of the birds in the reconstituted genus have three rather than the usual four toes. The exception is the Sulawesi dwarf kingfisher which retains a vestigial fourth toe. The Moluccan dwarf kingfisher (Ceyx lepidus) was previous named the variable dwarf kingfisher and included 15 recognised subspecies. A genetic study published in 2013 found that most of the subspecies had substantially diverged from one another. The species was therefore split and 12 of the subspecies were promoted to species status. At the same time the name was changed from the variable dwarf kingfisher to the Moluccan dwarf kingfisher. The two African species in the genus Ispidina were sometimes placed in this genus. Compared to the related species in the genus Alcedo they are more terrestrial. There are 22 or 23 species in the genus: * Oriental dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx erithaca * Philippine dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx melanurus * Sulawesi dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx fallax * Moluccan dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx lepidus \u2013 previously named \"variable dwarf kingfisher\" * Dimorphic dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx margarethae \u2013 previously a subspecies of the variable dwarf kingfisher * Sula dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx wallacii \u2013 previously a subspecies of the variable dwarf kingfisher * Buru dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx cajeli \u2013 previously a subspecies of the variable dwarf kingfisher * Papuan dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx solitarius \u2013 previously a subspecies of the variable dwarf kingfisher * Manus dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx dispar \u2013 previously a subspecies of the variable dwarf kingfisher * New Ireland dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx mulcatus \u2013 previously a subspecies of the variable dwarf kingfisher * New Britain dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx sacerdotis \u2013 previously a subspecies of the variable dwarf kingfisher * North Solomons dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx meeki \u2013 previously a subspecies of the variable dwarf kingfisher * Bougainville dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx pallidus \u2013 previously a subspecies of the variable dwarf kingfisher, sometimes still considered a subspecies of the North Solomons dwarf kingfisher * New Georgia dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx collectoris \u2013 previously a subspecies of the variable dwarf kingfisher * Malaita dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx malaitae \u2013 previously a subspecies of the variable dwarf kingfisher * Guadalcanal dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx nigromaxilla \u2013 previously a subspecies of the variable dwarf kingfisher * Makira dwarf kingfisher, Ceyx gentianus \u2013 previously a subspecies of the variable dwarf kingfisher * Indigo-banded kingfisher, Ceyx cynopectus \u2013 previously in Alcedo * Southern silvery kingfisher Ceyx argentatus \u2013 previously in Alcedo * Northern silvery kingfisher Ceyx flumenicola \u2013 split from C. argentatus * Azure kingfisher Ceyx azureus \u2013 previously in Alcedo * Bismarck kingfisher Ceyx websteri \u2013 previously in Alcedo * Little kingfisher Ceyx pusillus \u2013 previously in Alcedo ==References== ==Sources== * Category:Alcedininae Category:Bird genera ",
