    "text": "Gyland is a former municipality in Vest-Agder county, Norway. The municipality is located in the northeastern part of the present-day municipality of Flekkefjord. The municipality existed very briefly from 1838 until 1839 and then it was re-created in 1893 and it existed until 1965. The administrative centre was the village of Gyland where Gyland Church is located. ==History== The parish of Gyland was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt), but it was almost immediately merged into neighboring Bakke municipality in the fall of 1839. The Gyland area (population: 1,085) was separated (again) from Bakke municipality on 31 December 1893 to once again form its own municipality. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the municipalities of Gyland, Bakke, Hidra, and Nes were merged with the town of Flekkefjord to form a new, larger municipality of Flekkefjord. Prior to the merger, Gyland had a population of 691. ==Name== The municipality (originally the parish) was named after the old Gyland farm (Old Norse: G\u00fdjuland), where the Gyland Church was originally located. The first element is the old name of the river that flows past the farm (Old Norse: G\u00fdja or G\u00fd) and the last element is land which means \"land\". ==See also== *List of former municipalities of Norway ==References== Category:Former municipalities of Norway Category:Flekkefjord ",
