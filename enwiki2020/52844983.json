The Kollel focuses on educating and training young aspiring Rabbis from the Lubavitch community in various fields of Jewish Law; . === Mikvah & eruv consultancy === Since 2016, Shuchat has traveled the United States supervising the construction of mikvaot (Jewish ritual baths), and certifying them after their completion, ensuring they are built in accordance with the highest standards of halakha (Jewish law). He was involved in the construction of mikvaot across North and South America. Due to his expertise in the intricate laws of eruv (ritual enclosures), Shuchat is regularly called upon to design and review their placement in big cities across the United States. === Lectures on Jewish law === Shuchat lectures in contemporary halakhic issues, specializing in modern technology and innovation as it applies to Jewish law,; and is part of the faculty of the \"Online Smicha\" rabbinical ordination program. Since 2016, Shuchat is a regular panelist at the yearly Kinus HaShluchim (International conference of Chabad emissaries) where he lectures on halakha and his knowledge of directives of Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Chabad-Lubavitcher Rebbe. He is also a featured speaker at the Kinus Torah in the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters, which takes place on the day after the conclusion of each of the holidays of Passover, Shavuot and Sukkot; and other rabbinic conferences and events. === Arbitration and mediation === Shuchat trained with the New York Center for Interpersonal Development, and is a member of the Association for Conflict Resolution (ACR). He serves as an arbitrator and mediator in disputes between and within Jewish organizations. === Responsa === Shuchat's first responsa, written in 2012, received the approbation of Rishon LeZion Ovadia Yosef. As posek (Jewish law authority), Shuchat has authored hundreds of She'elot u-Teshuvot (responsa) to queries he received from rabbis the world over. == Controversies == * In October 2013, Shuchat was implicated in the Edison divorce torture plot, a sting operation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the goal of which was to bring about the arrests of a number of rabbis who plotted to abduct and torture a non-existent Jewish man in order to coerce him into issuing a get (divorce document) to his 'wife'.Molloy, Allie (October 22, 2013) \"Judge Sets Bail for Jewish Scribe, 3 Others in Kidnapping-Divorce Case\", CNN. Retrieved July 9, 2019. Shuchat pleaded guilty in New Jersey Federal Court to traveling in interstate commerce to commit an act of violence.Samaha, Albert (June 24, 2014) \"Enforcer in Orthodox Jewish Divorce Extortion Operation Pleads Guilty\", The Village Voice. Retrieved July 8, 2019. He was sentenced to time served and no additional jail time, along with two years of supervised release with the first six months being house arrest. * After a second measles outbreak in the Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn in 2014 (following an earlier outbreak in 2013), Shuchat wrote an article berating the anti-vaxxers, stating \"When someone does an action which can cause death, or even refuses to do an action which can prevent death, he is compared to a murderer\"., quoted in * On May 29, 2014 the Chabad Lubavitch- affiliated publishing house Kol Menachem released Chaim Miller's book Turning Judaism Outwards: A Biography of the Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, which was promoted and branded as \"A Human Portrait of the Rebbe\". Shuchat was asked by Chabad leaders to review the book and respond to the alleged disrespect showed by the author to the Rebbe. In mid-June 2014, Shuchat published a review of the book, titled \"Taking the Wrong Turn Outwards: A Critical Review\", describing some of the inaccuracies in the book. * In 2015, when some members of the Crown Heights community advocated for the Jewish prenuptial agreement, Shuchat was one of the rabbis opposing it, explaining its fallacies while proposing a possible alternative. * In 2015, when the KosherSwitch was introduced (an innovative light switch for circumventing the prohibition against using electricity on Shabbat), Shuchat expounded upon why it cannot be used on Shabbat, his position later being affirmed by other rabbis. * In 2016, when an eruv was built around the Crown Heights Jewish community, the local community rabbis strongly voiced their opposition, with some even comparing the eruv users with members of Reform Judaism. The only Chabad rabbi to check the eruv and ultimately render it permissible was Shuchat, who ruled that although it is kosher, it should not be used until it is modified to satisfy the most stringent opinions. * In 2017, the \"TahorApp\" was created with the purpose of enabling women who are niddah to discreetly send questions to the rabbis, without the need to go in person. A few hours after its launch, Shuchat released a statement to the effect that this app \"may not be used... and any psak (religious ruling) obtained from said app is invalid\" until a rabbi is consulted in person. Later, four additional rabbis added their names to the prohibition, and the certifying rabbi Fishel Jacobs pulled his endorsement from the app. * In 2017, Shuchat joined a group of Chabad rabbis who signed a proclamation addressing child sexual abuse cases in Brooklyn's haredi community and in the Chabad community in particular. The rabbis affirmed that \"there is no need to seek rabbinic approval prior to reporting\" all forms of abuse to the authorities. The letter was organized by Dovid Nyer, a licensed clinical social worker in New City, New York with Shuchat's help. * Immediately after Passover in 2018, the hechsher (kosher supervision) department of the Central Rabbinical Congress released a letter prohibiting the consumption of any beer sold by Manhattan Beer Distributors due to a perceived problem with the sale of chametz (leaven) performed for the company by the OK Kosher Certification. The problem, which was widely reported in haredi publications and termed \"The Great Beer Episode of 2018\" was immediately investigated by Shuchat, who determined that the sale of chametz was valid. His detailed responsa was later published in various rabbinical journals.Oholei Torah Yeshiva, Rabbinical Journal Haoros U'Biurim, Year 39, Vol. 16 (1146), published Spring 2018, p. 58-69; Rabbi Chaim Oberlander, Rabbi Gedalia Oberlander, Rabbinical Journal Ohr Yisroel, Year 24, Vol. 1 (77), published Fall 2018, p. 52-66. He was later joined by Gavriel Zinner, Av Beth Din of Nitei Gavriel of Brooklyn, Asher Eckstein, Chief Rabbi of the Belz community in Brooklyn and Menachem Meir Weissmandel of Monsey, New York, who all acknowledged that the sale of chametz was performed properly.Rabbi Chaim Oberlander, Rabbi Gedalia Oberlander, Rabbinical Journal Ohr Yisroel, Year 24, Vol. 1 (77), published Fall 2018, p. 34-51. * In the fall of 2018, Shuchat spearheaded the campaign to discredit the International Beit Din headed by Simcha Krauss after it allowed a married woman to remarry without first obtaining a get, rendering any future children born as mamzerim (illegitimate). He was later joined by the Brooklyn beth din (religious court) of the Central Rabbinical Congress, the beth din of the Edah HaChareidis in Jerusalem, Moishe Sternbuch of Jerusalem, the Bnei Brak, Israel beth din of Nissim Karelitz, the Sydney, Australia beth din, the Monsey Eizer Mishpot beth din of Pinchas Rabinowitz, the Brooklyn Avnei Shaish Faltishan beth din of Yitzchok Stein and the Brooklyn beth din of Gavriel Zinner. In January 2019, Shuchat was invited to deliver an address to a conference of veteran haredi rabbis and dayanim (rabbinic judges) in Boro Park regarding this matter. == Personal life == Shuchat married Chaya in 2009, and together they have three daughters. == Publications == Shuchat serves as an associate editor of the Rebbe's works, and was involved in producing the following: * Hadran - Siyum Maseches Chagiga (editor) - A discourse by the Rebbe on the occasion of completing the Tractate Chagigah of the Babylonian Talmud.
