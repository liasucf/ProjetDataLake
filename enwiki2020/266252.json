The other three kings are Amaymon, Corson and Gaap (although some translations of The Lesser Key of Solomon consider Belial, Beleth, Asmodai and Gaap, not giving detail on the cardinal point they rule). He is the king of the north according to both the The Lesser Key of Solomon and Pseudomonarchia Daemonum. ==See also== * Amaymon is also one of the four cardinal spirits, of the East in the Lesser Key of Solomon. * Corson is also one of the four cardinal spirits, of the West in the Lesser Key of Solomon. * Gaap is also one of the four cardinal spirits, of the South in the Lesser Key of Solomon. == References == Category:Goetic demons ",
