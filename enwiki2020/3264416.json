It is located at the intersection of Shoreditch High Street with Hackney Road, within the London Borough of Hackney in East London. The current building dates from about 1740. The church is mentioned in the line \"When I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch\" from the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons.The Centre of Attention at Shoreditch Church accessed 06/01/08 The crypt beneath the church is the final resting place of many actors from the Tudor period. ==Origins== The original church is possibly Saxon in origin, though the first historical reference to it occurs in the 12th century. Memorial to Tudor actors buried in the church The church was situated near The Theatre, England's first purpose-built playhouse, built in Shoreditch in 1576, and the nearly contemporary Curtain Theatre (built in 1577).The Bells of Shoreditch accessed 06/01/08 Several members of the theatrical profession from the Elizabethan period are buried in the church, including: *James Burbage, the founder of The Theatre, England's first playhouse. *His son Richard, who was the leading man in many of Shakespeare's plays, which were first performed in the contemporary Shoreditch theatres. *The comedian Richard Tarlton, who was a stalwart of the pre-Shakespearian stage. *The actor Gabriel Spenser, who was killed by Ben Jonson in a duel. These, with others of their profession from the period, are commemorated by a large classical memorial erected by the London Shakespeare League in 1913, inside the church, which serves as a reminder of Shoreditch's Shakespearian heritage. The Shoreditch Vestry levied a special poor rate in 1774 for the purpose of setting up a workhouse for the parish of St. Leonard's, which highlights the level of poverty in the area. ==Current building== One of the bells, removed for maintenance Following a partial collapse of the tower in 1716, the medieval church was rebuilt in Palladian style by George Dance the Elder during 1736\u201340, with a soaring steeple 192 feet tall\u2014an imitation of Christopher Wren's magnificent steeple on St Mary-le-Bow in Cheapside\u2014and a giant four-columned, pedimented Tuscan portico.
