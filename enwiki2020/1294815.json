She produced but did not appear in America's Funniest Home Videos and Nandi (1998).

A subsequent marriage to Eugene McGarth, in 1956, lasted three years. One year after this marriage ended, Moore married Stuart Cramer after his divorce from Jean Peters; they had two children together, Stuart Cramer IV and actor Grant Cramer, before divorcing in 1972. In 1979, Moore claimed to have married Richard F. Carey, in Mexico; he disappeared a few days later, having swindled her and others out of their money. Her 1992 marriage to Jerry Rivers lasted until his death in 2001. Moore became the subject of public attention as a result of her relationship with Howard Hughes. According to Moore, she and Hughes were married in 1949 in a ceremony performed by a ship captain in international waters. Moore has said that Hughes destroyed the ship's log that recorded the marriage, and they separated from each other by 1956, but she and Hughes were never divorced. Moore has explained her subsequent marriages during Hughes' lifetime by saying, \"I didn't care whether I was a bigamist or not, frankly. I mean, my desire to have children was that strong.\" The Texas courts rejected Moore's claim of being Hughes' widow based on judicial estoppel; since Moore had claimed in her divorce from Cramer to have been married to him in 1959 and received a property settlement in that case, her claim that she was married to Hughes at the time was inconsistent with that and would not be accepted.Moore v. Neff, 629 S.W.2d 827 (Tex. Ct. App. 1982). Nevertheless, the Hughes heirs agreed that Moore had had a long-term relationship with Hughes and agreed to a financial settlement with her. Moore described the settlement as \"not more than eight figures\"; a biography of Hughes implies that the settlement was $350,000. Moore dated actor Glenn Ford in the early 1970s. Ford, Peter.
