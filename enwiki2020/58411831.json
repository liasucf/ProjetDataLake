He currently works as a youth coach at BK Frem, coaching the under-19 side, after taking a break from football. In September 2018, he made his debut for the Denmark national team, as the regular squad withdrew following a players' union dispute. ==Club career== Holm left Skovshoved IF in March 2019 and returned to his former club Br\u00f8ndby IF to play for the club's reserve team in the last six games.Daniel Holm tr\u00e6kker i Br\u00f8ndby-tr\u00f8jen igen: Skal hj\u00e6lpe Sj\u00e6llandsserie-holdet til overlevelse, 3point.dk, 28 April 2019 In the summer 2019, he left Br\u00f8ndby again and returned to one of his other former clubs, Boldklubben Frem.Daniel Holm \u2013 Boldklubben FREM, bkfrem.dk On 18 January 2020 it was confirmed, that Holm had decided to take a break from football, after playing only six games in first half of the season due to an injury.

However, a contract dispute arose regarding the commercial rights of the players, resulting in a failure to sign a new agreement. Despite an offer from the squad to extend the previous deal to allow for further negotiations, the DBU instead named an entirely uncapped squad under the temporary management of coach John Jensen to avoid punishment from UEFA for cancelling the matches. The squad consisted of a mixture of players from the Danish 2nd Division and the Denmark Series (the third and fourth tier of Danish football respectively), along with futsal players from the Denmark national futsal team. On 4 September 2018, Holm was one of 24 players to be named in the replacement squad. The following day, he made his international debut in the friendly match against Slovakia, coming on as a substitute in the 61st minute for Kasper Kempel. The match finished as a 0\u20133 away loss. ==Career statistics== ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !colspan=3|Denmark |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2018||1||0 |- !Total!!1!!0 |} ==References== ==External links== * * Profile at DBU.dk * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Danish footballers Category:Denmark youth international footballers Category:Denmark international footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Hvidovre IF players Category:Boldklubben Frem players Category:Skovshoved IF players Category:Danish 2nd Division players ",
