In July 2012, he joined Burnley on a two-year scholarship deal. He progressed through the youth side and was named as captain in his second season at the club, signing his first professional contract in March 2014.

He made his senior debut in the 1\u20131 league draw with Dover Athletic, playing the full ninety minutes. He made five appearances during his month at the Deva Stadium, however, he turned down the option to extend his loan despite interest from Chester manager Steve Burr. In January 2016, he instead chose to join National League rivals Gateshead on a loan deal until the end of the season, preferring to move closer to his North East roots. He was a first team regular for the club and made twenty-three appearances in all competitions, scoring twice. His performances during the spell convinced Burnley to extend his contract for a further year. In July 2016, he joined League Two side Morecambe on a loan deal until January 2017. He made his debut in August 2016, in the opening day 2\u20130 defeat to Grimsby Town.
