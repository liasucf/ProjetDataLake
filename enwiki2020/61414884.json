    "text": "Megascolecidae earthworm Amynthas japonicus was a Japanese native probably collected from Nagasaki in the 1820s. It was one of three native earthworms featured in Dr P.F.B. von Siebold\u2019s extensive collection and recorded as one of Japan\u2019s earliest pheretimoid species. It is now deemed extinct given that a 2018 Nagasaki expedition and earlier 1930s reports failed to locate it. It is featured on The Recently Extinct Plants and Animals Database. ==References== Category:Megascolecidae Category:Nagasaki ",
