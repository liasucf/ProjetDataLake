In both The Twelfth Heart and The Dorm Challenge the theme of friendship is explored through the central character of Mercy, a girl who leaves her small village behind and meets new people at boarding school. == References == Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Ghanaian women novelists Category:Writers of young adult literature Category:University of Ghana alumni Category:Alumni of the University of Surrey Category:Ghanaian women short story writers Category:21st-century Ghanaian women writers Category:21st- century Ghanaian writers Category:Ghanaian novelists ",
