Their friend Sherry (Humayun Saeed), a divorce lawyer, returns to Pakistan from the United States and finds that all his friends are in miserable marriages. Sherry treats the wives well so that they allow their husbands to accompany Sherry on a road trip to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Sherry actually plans to take the men to Bangkok to add excitement to their lives. In Bangkok, Sherry meets a girl named Marina (Mehwish Hayat) and they fall in love. However, when Sherry learns that Marina is the daughter of a crime boss named Bichi Don (Ismail Tara), he wants to leave Bangkok to get away from Marina. The men's wives, having learnt of the deception, arrive at the Bangkok hotel where the group are staying. Pervez tries to commit suicide by jumping off the hotel but is saved when he lands in a swimming pool. Sherry tells the wives that the trip was the men's idea and not his. The wives demand divorces from their husbands, saying they can no longer trust them. A few months pass and the three friends learn that Sherry is to marry Zoya (Sohai Ali Abro). She is the daughter of Mehboob Khan (Javed Sheikh), a billionaire in Lahore. Zoya is the quintessential nouveau riche kid, who insists on speaking with a strong American-English accent and abbreviates expressions like \"OMG\" (Oh my God) and \"MA\" (Masha'Allah). She enjoys clicking selfies and spending her father's money carelessly. Zoya's mother (Bushra Ansari), worries about her daughter's attitude. When the three friends arrive at Sherry's wedding, he asks them not to tell Zoya and her family about Marina. Bichi Don arrives at the wedding and introduces himself as \"Ya Sheikh\", a friend of Mehboob Khan. Sherry tells everyone that his friend, Saif's nickname is also Sherry. The farce is that no one knows which Sherry anyone is talking about. Two days before the marriage, Marina arrives. Sherry wants Marina's father to reject him as a potential son-in-law, so he pretends to be a homosexual. The ploy works and Marina and her father leave, only to return on the day of the wedding. Mehboob Khan and Marina's father, (Ya Sheikh) argue about Sherry and this results in both men rejecting Sherry as a potential son-in-law. The story ends when the three friends patch things up with their wives and Sherry asks for Marina's hand in marriage. == Cast == * Humayun Saeed as Shereyar a.k.a Sherry * Hamza Ali Abbasi as Saif Ahmed a.k.a Saif/Sherry * Ahmad Ali Butt as Parvez (Pipi) * Vasay Chaudhry as Sheikh * Ayesha Khan as Kubra (Saif's wife) * Sohai Ali Abro as Zoya * Mehwish Hayat as Marina * Sarwat Gillani as Gul (Sheikh's wife) * Uzma Khan as Lubna (Parvez's wife) * Jawed Sheikh as Mehboob Khan (Zoya's father) * Bushra Ansari as Jabbo (Zoya's mother) * Ismail Tara as Don / Yaa Sheikh (Marina's father) * Bashar Amir Shafi as Pipi's son (child artist) ===Special Appearance=== * Gohar Rasheed as XYZ (fashion designer) * Farhan Ally Agha as Sherry's father * Yasra Rizvi as Sherry's mother * Naveed Raza as Lawyer * Zainab Qayyum as Lawyer * Ali Kazmi as Dr. Aamir Liaquat Khan * Fahad Mustafa as Himself * Zainab Jamil as Charity * Bilal Lashari as Police officer * Wajid Khan as Stylist * Ali Rizvi as Caller * Saife Hassan as Lawyer * Adnan Siddiqui as Himself (in picture) * Shakeel Hussain Khan as a caller * Viktor Krav as Gangster == Production == ===Filming=== The film was shot in various locations in Thailand including Bangkok, Pattaya and Coral Island.
