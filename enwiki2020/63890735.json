    "text": "Shuttered Hugo Boss store in Brisbane, Australia (March 2020) The COVID-19 pandemic affects the global fashion industry as governments close down manufacturing plants, and through store closures, and event cancellations to slow the spread of the virus. The coronavirus pandemic has had a major impact on fashion brands worldwide. At the same time, the fashion industry faces challenges in consumer demand. New opportunities are also presenting themselves as fashion brands shift to making fashionable coronavirus face masks. ==Manufacturing== Manufacturing issues include lack of fabric availability and order cancellations, but brands that prepared originally by importing fabrics and have them stored at a safehouse will benefit from the pandemic. ==Sales== Apparel is a leading discretionary purchase. As many people are staying at home, there is less emphasis on getting dressed. Likewise, many people make clothing purchases ahead of special occasions, such as weddings and vacation, but as many of these events have been canceled or postponed, the impetus to buy new clothing is no longer there. Layoffs, furloughs and pay cuts are also affecting sales. ==Events== Designers have adapted with producing and showcasing their fashion products by streaming presentations online without a live audience present. The British Fashion Council made an announcement in April 2020 that it would develop a digital \u201ccultural fashion week platform\u201d that designers could use in any way that they thought would work for them rather than facilitating the typical format and setting of a fashion show. Shanghai and Moscow fashion weeks were presented digitally in late March and April 2020. Ermenegildo Zegna coined the word \"phygital\" to describe \"physical space and digital technologies\" as its new way of showcasing fashion. As art galleries and museums are closed, First American Art Magazine organized a virtual art exhibition and asked the Native art community to submit masks. More than seventy artists handed in 125 masks, from functional masks to decorated ones. == Face masks == Face masks have been trending as a fashion statement during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been suggested that possibly \"no other piece of clothing that has had a trajectory like face masks \u2014 something that began as purely protective transforming into a fashion statement in no time at all.\" Trikini, a three piece garment was popularized in Italy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The trikini consists of a two piece beachwear and a matching mask. ==Distribution channels== As retail stores shut their doors and stay-at-home orders kept people inside, there was a dramatic shift towards digital commerce that is likely to continue post-pandemic. Consumers had to increase their use of services like social commerce and curbside pickup and retailers had to offer digital solutions in order to survive . Sales from physical brick-and-mortar stores and department stores are down and expected to continue decreasing while direct-to-consumer online retailers are on the rise . ==Lasting effects== The COVID-19 pandemic will inevitably change the fashion industry forever. The necessity to purchase clothing on a frequent basis no longer exists, and the financial and cultural devastation which took place when numerous brands and historical department stores closed for good. As time goes on, the catastrophic effects of the Coronavirus on small fashion businesses will become clear, what can be expected for certain is a sort of dynamic shift which is expected to occur in terms of production and collection cycles, what styles are produced (as well as where & how often) and most importantly, who will be the ones in power to make these decisions. == References == fashion industry Category:History of fashion Category:Clothing Category:Jewellery Category:Shoe business ",
