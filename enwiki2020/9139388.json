While hardly trained as a television presenter, Pineda nonetheless became popular, being as he was then, the only television weatherman in the 1970s and 1990s; for catchphrases like, \"'Yan ang pinakahuling ulat mula sa PAGASA\" (\"That's the latest from PAGASA\") at the end of his forecasts and \"Kaya mga bata, may pasok bukas\" (\"And so children, there are classes tomorrow\") after forecasts of weaker- than-expected tropical storm. Pineda made several cameo appearances in films, in roles mostly spoofing himself. The comedian Tessie Tomas also gained renown with her own spoof of Pineda appearing on CHAMPOY, her character named Amanda Pineda. Pineda was the head of Weathernews Philippines, Inc., a commercial weather bureau. He died on August 6, 2015 at the age of 77 due to cardiac arrest. ==TV shows== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccc; text- align:center;\" ! Title !! Year !!
