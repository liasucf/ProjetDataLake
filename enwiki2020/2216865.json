    "text": "Selkup language is the language of the Selkups, belonging to the Samoyedic group of the Uralic language family. It is spoken by some 1,570 people (1994 est.) in the region between the Ob and Yenisei Rivers (in Siberia). The language name Selkup comes from the Russian \"\" (selkupsky yazyk), based on the native name used in the Taz dialect, \u0448\u04e7\u043b\u044c\u04c4\u0443\u043c\u044b\u0442 \u04d9\u0442\u044b \u0161\u00f6\u013equmyt \u04d9ty, lit. forest- man language. Different dialects use different names. Selkup is fractured in an extensive dialect continuum whose ends are no longer mutually intelligible. The three main varieties are the Taz (Northern) dialect (, tazovsky dialekt), which became the basis of the Selkup written language in the 1930s, Tym (Central) dialect (, tymsky dialekt), and Ket dialect (, ketsky dialekt). It is not related to the Ket language. ==Phonology== There are 25 vowel and 16 consonant phonemes in the Taz dialect. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Taz Selkup consonants |- ! !! Labial !! Dental !!

Stops and fricatives may be voiced between vowels or after sonorant consonants. * The palatalized stop and fricative , are most typically rendered as an alveolo-palatal affricate and fricative . Depending on the speaker, the former can be also realized as the stop , the latter as a non-palatalized fricative, postalveolar or retroflex . * Before front vowels, palatalized variants of other consonants are also found. * and are allophones of when occurring before nasals and liquids, respectively. * The non-coronal stops , , have optional fricative allophones , , when occurring before or . {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Taz Selkup vowels |- ! colspan=\"2\"| !! colspan=\"2\"| Front !!

(Shown on a darker gray background.) * The non-phonemic lax central vowel only occurs in unstressed non-first syllables; it is normally treated equivalent with short tense . Selkup has a syllable structure (C)V(C). Word-initial and word-final or do not occur. Various consonant clusters and geminate consonants such as may occur, though many potential combinations occurring morphologically are simplified. Stress in Selkup is marginally phonemic. Generally the rightmost long vowel in a word is stressed, or otherwise the first syllable, but certain suffixes with short vowels may acquire stress, leading to minimal pairs such as \"to stamp down\" vs. \"to stamp once\". ==References== ==External links== *Endangered Languages of Indigenous Peoples of Siberia: The Selkup Language * Helimski, Eugene. 1998. \"Selkup\".
