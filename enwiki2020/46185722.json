    "text": "Melaleuca cardiophylla, commonly known as tangling melaleuca or umbrella bush is a plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae and is endemic to the west and south-west of Western Australia. It is a dense, prickly shrub with heart- shaped leaves, stamens that are joined in unusually long claw-like bundles, and distinctive, warty fruits. ==Description== Melaleuca cardiophylla is a shrub growing to a height of . The leaves are arranged alternately with the stalk of the leaf attached to the underside of the leaf. They are long and wide with about 12 to 20 longitudinal veins and end in a point that is often sharp. The flowers are arranged in groups of 1 to 5 along considerable lengths of the branches. The petals and sepals have edges that are almost transparent and the petals fall from the flower soon after it opens. The stamens are white or cream and arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle having the appearance of a claw. Flowering time is variable but is usually between August and January. The fruit are almost spherical, knobbly, woody capsules that are larger than those of most other melaleucas at about diameter.

The specific epithet (cardiophylla) is from the Ancient Greek kardia (\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03af\u03b1) meaning \"heart\" and phyllon (\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd) meaning \"leaf\", hence \"with heart-shaped leaves\".Backer, C.A. (1936). Verklarend woordenboek der wetenschappelijke namen van de in Nederland en Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb in het wild groeiende en in tuinen en parken gekweekte varens en hoogere planten (Edition Nicoline van der Sijs). ==Distribution and habitat== This melaleuca occurs in areas close to the coast between Perth, the Exmouth district and the Pilbara in the Carnarvon, Gascoyne, Geraldton Sandplains, Swan Coastal Plain and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. It grows in sand on limestone and sand dunes often in association with Eucalyptus species such as E. obtusiflora, E. oraria and E. zopherophloia. ==Conservation status== Melaleuca cardiophylla is listed as \"not threatened\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. == References == cardiophylla Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Plants described in 1859 Category:Endemic flora of Western Australia Category:Taxa named by Ferdinand von Mueller ",
