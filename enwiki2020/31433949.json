    "text": "Christopher Gibson (born 27 December 1992) is a Finnish professional ice hockey goaltender for the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL). Gibson was selected by the Los Angeles Kings in the second round (49th overall) of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, although he never played for them, instead signing with the Toronto Maple Leafs, playing in their minor league system before a trade sent Gibson to the New York Islanders. ==Early life== Gibson was born in Karkkila, Finland to Peter, an artist and kick boxer from Saint Lucia, and a Finnish mother, Ulla Nurse. He was raised in Espoo, Finland before moving to Saskatchewan at age 15 to attend Notre Dame College. ==Playing career== In Gibson's first year at Notre Dame College, the Notre Dame Hounds (Midget AAA) won the Telus Cup national championship (2009). Following that year at Notre Dame, Gibson was drafted by the Chicoutimi Saguen\u00e9ens of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League in the first round (16th overall) of the 2009 CHL Import Draft. Gibson was ranked as the number one goaltender from the QMJHL heading into the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Selected at 49th overall by the Los Angeles Kings, Gibson was the first goaltender selected from the Canadian Hockey League in the 2011 draft. Unsigned by the Kings, he would re-enter the draft, but was signed by the Toronto Maple Leafs instead. On 17 September 2015, Gibson was traded by the Maple Leafs, along with four other prospects, to the New York Islanders in exchange for Michael Grabner. On 2 January 2016, Gibson got his first taste of NHL action coming in relief for Thomas Greiss. Gibson allowed one goal from Patric Hornqvist, but made 16 saves. On 6 April 2016, Gibson got his first NHL start and his first NHL win with the Islanders against the Washington Capitals. Gibson made 29 saves as the Islanders came back from a 3\u20131 deficit to win 4\u20133 in overtime. The win clinched the Islanders a spot in the 2016 playoffs. On 15 August 2016, the Islanders re-signed Gibson to a one-year, two-way contract worth $660,000. On 11 March 2018, Gibson had a 50-save game against the Calgary Flames, becoming the first Islanders' rookie goaltender to do so since Billy Smith made 55 in 1972. After five seasons within the Islanders organization, Gibson left as a free agent and was signed to a one-year, two-way contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning on October 9, 2020. ==International play== At age 17, Gibson represented Finland at the 2010 IIHF World U18 Championships in Belarus, winning the bronze medal. Gibson was selected to the Finnish national junior team for the 2012 World Junior Championships in Canada. Gibson turned 19 years old during the tournament. ==Career statistics== 180px {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:75%\" |- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! align=\"center\" colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! align=\"center\" rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! align=\"center\" colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | Regular season ! align=\"center\" rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! align=\"center\" colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | Playoffs |- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
