All of the feeder aircraft operated in the United States are owned by FedEx and because of this all of the aircraft are in the FedEx Feeder livery. Just like regional airlines, the contractor will operate the aircraft with their own flight number and call sign. ==References== Category:Cargo airlines of the United States Category:Airlines established in 1998 Category:Airlines based in Michigan Category:1998 establishments in Michigan ",
