Preceded by Ghana Bassi, Manin was the last ruler of the Ghana Empire before the Almoravid conquest. Accounts of Tunka Manin come from al- Bakhri, a visitor to the Ghana kingdom who described him as a \"lover of justice and favorable to Muslims\". Manin inherited his throne from his mother, brother, King Basi, and as King, he was the chief decision-maker. Manin settled disputes and ordeals and also had ministers who collected taxes and made laws. During his reign, he controlled numerous warriors that were tasked with defending the kingdom. Later on in his reign, the kingdom would eventually fall because of a few factors. One factor as the system of governance, religious reasons (which sparked the Almoravids movement), the fact that Manin himself was not Muslim, and division between Muslims and non- Muslims. Ibn Yacin, who started the Almoravid movement, declared jihad on Tunka Manin's kingdom in a struggle that would span over ten years with the Almoravids briefly gaining control. Manin had succeeded Bassi in 1062 and like him had refused to convert to Islam.African Glory: The Story of Vanished Negro Civilizations by John Coleman De Graft-Johnson, page 88 The missionary Almoravids who wanted to convert other people to their faith had been angered by Bassi's refusal to convert had started invading the empire under Abu Bakr ibn Umar.African Glory: The Story of Vanished Negro Civilizations by John Coleman De Graft-Johnson, page 87 Al-Bakri noted that Manin controlled some 200,000 warriors.Early African Empires and their Global Connections However, in 1076, the Almoravids succeeded in sacking the empire's capital of Kumbi Saleh.The Oxford Encyclopedia of African Thought, Volume 1 byAbiola Irele, Biodun Jeyifo, page 407 Manin continued to rule as a vassal of the Almoravids and paid tribute to them.African Glory: The Story of Vanished Negro Civilizations by John Coleman De Graft-Johnson, page 88 The Almoravids were expelled in 1087 with Abu Bakr being killed. The empire had however been severely weakened and the territories formerly ruled by it had become independent. Islam which had become the dominant faith of its upper class was being imposed on all subjects and many animists who migrated to other areas away from the empire.Balancing Written History with Oral Traditions: The Legacy of the Songhoy People by Hassimi Oumarou Maiga, page 25 Manin is renowned for his involvement with the local communities, and also for his success economically, as he increased trade, especially that of salt, greatly within the empire. Manin is said to have surrounded himself with an air of divinity and magic, which he used to motivate his people to protect him well.West African Kingdoms 500-1590: Social Class and Economy History: Tunka Manin | World Eras Manin was known to display his wealth by decking himself out in gold, ivory, and other precious materials. == References == Category:1010 births Category:1078 deaths Category:Ghana Empire ",
