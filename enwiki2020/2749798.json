    "text": "Zeta Volantis (\u03b6 Vol, \u03b6 Volantis) is a binary star system in the southern constellation of Volans. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.93, which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements, it is approximately 141 light years from the Sun. The companion is a magnitude 9.7 star at an angular separation of 16.7\u2033. Based upon their motion through space, this system made its perihelion passage some 858,000 years ago when it came within of the Sun. It is currently moving away with a radial velocity of 48 km/s. The primary component is K-type giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III. It has a derived luminosity of around 53 times that of the Sun, 1.74 times the Sun's mass and is about 5.27 billion years old. The measured angular diameter of this star is mas. At the estimated distance of Zeta Volantis, this yields a physical size of about 11 times the radius of the Sun. The expanded outer envelope has an effective temperature of 4,721 K, giving it the orange glow of a K-type star. ==References== {0.0046491\\ \\text{AU}/R_{\\bigodot}} \\\\\\ & \\approx 21.6\\cdot R_{\\bigodot} \\end{align} }} Category:K-type giants Category:Binary stars Volantis, Zeta Category:Volans (constellation) Category:Durchmusterung objects 063295 037504 3024 ",
