The former name of Tempelburg refers to the Templar Knights, which settled nearby at the orders of King Przemys\u0142 II. Until 1668, the town was part of Poland. Afterwards it was part of Brandenburg, Prussia and Germany, until the end of World War II. It is one of the northernmost towns of the historical region of Greater Poland. Czaplinek is a local tourist destination, which has the second deepest lake in Poland and a large marina. The main market square features events, exhibitions and annual festivals. ==History== Slavic palisade settlement called gord The oldest trace of a settlement dates back over 2,500 years; a palisade was once discovered on the island of Bielawa on Drawsko Lake, the second deepest lake in Poland, as well as in the village of Stare Drawsko. The area was initially inhabited by the Goths in the ancient times, followed by the West Slavs, whose settlements called gords were most likely burned down by Duke Boles\u0142aw III the Wrymouth, thus incorporating Pomerania into the Polish state. The abundance of isthmuses on the numerous lakes in the region helped to protect the towns from invasions and plunder. In the autumn of 1286, the Prince of Greater Poland and future King of Poland Przemys\u0142 II brought the Templar Knights to a nearby fishing village for defensive purposes, hence the former name of Tempelburg. Czaplinek was granted city rights in 1291 and in around 1300, it was annexed by Brandenburg. In 1345 the Templar estates passed to the Knights Hospitaller. In 1368 the town was purchased by King Casimir III the Great. For the next centuries Czaplinek remained a part of Poland, as a royal town, administratively in the Pozna\u0144 Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Czaplinek was granted various privileges by Polish kings in 1504, 1635 and 1640.S\u0142ownik geograficzny Kr\u00f3lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj\u00f3w s\u0142owia\u0144skich, Tom XII, Warszawa, 1892, p. 291-292 (in Polish) In the 1658 Treaty of Bydgoszcz, it came under the control of Brandenburg-Prussia, and was definitively lost by Poland in 1668, although Poles made diplomatic efforts to regain the town until the First Partition of Poland in 1772, but to no avail. In the 17th century the town experienced rapid development in infrastructure, which increased its population. In 1725 and 1765, Czaplinek was also the site of heavy fires. In the late 18th century the town's castle gradually lost its importance and began to fall into ruin. At the end of the 19th century, Czaplinek was connected via railways to large cities like Szczecin. The construction of roads, cobblestone streets and a proper gas network begun, simultaneously with the establishment of the telegraph. During World War II, the Germans established a labor camp for Soviet POWs and prisoners in Czaplinek. A large group of ethnic Poles was also employed as forced labor. The town was part of the so-called Pomeranian Wall, which was a line of defense created by the Germans. It was constructed as a light defensive position in case of an attack from the Second Polish Republic. In the final stages of the war, on March 3, 1945, the Battle of Czaplinek took place, in which the First Polish Army defeated the forces of Nazi Germany and captured the town. Following Germany's defeat in 1945, Czaplinek, as part of historic Greater Poland, was finally reintegrated with Poland. The town's German population was expelled and the town was resettled by Poles. The remaining pre-war Polish inhabitants of the town, were joined by various other groups of Poles, the first of which were the just freed forced laborers and prisoners of war.Brunon Bronk, Administracja oraz pocz\u0105tki \u017cycia w gminie, \"Czaplinek 1945-2009 cz.

In the meantime, German Nazi militias, with the help of some local Germans, carried out terrorist attacks and sabotage acts against Poles. The first 1945 Polish mayor of Czaplinek was Boles\u0142aw Kondulski, a freed forced laborer.Bronk, Op. cit., p. 46 After the war, the town's life was organized anew.
