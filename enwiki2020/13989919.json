Pelletier\u2019s work adapts and expands Ensor's mockery of government, religious and business leaders, recasting the return of Jesus based on modern biblical interpretations of the late 20th century American Christian Fundamentalist and Christian Dominionist movements, especially of Left Behind author and activist Tim LaHaye. The work has been displayed throughout the United States and Europe, usually accompanied by presentations by and discussion with the artist. ==American Fundamentalist Movement== Pelletier has written a manifesto that comments on American Fundamentalism. Religion, politics, economy, and corporations are discussed. ==References== ==External links== * * Joel Pelletier's JOHN PAUL JOEL Tribute project site * ZEPPELIN LIVE band site * Mr. Jimmy Led Zeppelin Revival band site * THE LUSH POP TRIO site * Joel Pelletier AMERICAN FUNDAMENTALISTS site * Review of Pelletier's CD CHAMBER POP * CHAMBER POP review at Home Theater and High Fidelity * Review of CHAMBER POP at The Muse's Muse * Listen to artist talk by Joel Pelletier on \"American Fundamentalists at Institute for Humanist Studies in Albany, NY * Louis Vandenberg presents American Fundamentalists (from The Daily Kos) * Artist to lead panel on controversial artwork \"Fundamentalists\" at University of Wisconsin Eau Claire * Painting and artist appearing in Madison, WI * Official Fundamental Website Category:Living people Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:21st-century American painters Category:21st-century male artists Category:American male musicians Category:American musicians Category:American actors Category:1961 births Category:University of Hartford Hartt School alumni ",
