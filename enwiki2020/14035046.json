The basketball events were not held on the 2005 Southeast Asian Games since the host country, the Philippines basketball federation (the Basketball Association of the Philippines) was suspended by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). The suspension was lifted in 2006 and the Philippines and Malaysia defended their men's and women's championships, respectively, last won in 2003. The tournament was conducted on a single round robin; the team with best record wins the gold. The men's team of the Philippines maintained their superiority in the SEA Games, winning all of their games with an average lead of 42 points; the women's team of Malaysia easily dispatched their opponents in the first two games before upending the Thais in overtime to successfully defend their gold. ==Men's tournament== ===Participating nations=== * * * * * ===Results=== {| class=wikitable |- ! width=150px|Team !! width=30px| Pts. !! width=20px| W !! width=20px| L !! width=20px| PF !! width=20px| PA !! width=20px| PD |- align=center bgcolor=gold | align=left | || 8 || 4 || 0 || 413 || 244 || +169 |- align=center bgcolor=silver | align=left | || 7 || 3 || 1 || 284 || 252 || +32 |- align=center bgcolor=#cc9966 | align=left | || 6 || 2 || 2 || 288 || 315 || -27 |- align=center | align=left | || 5 || 1 || 3 || 244 || 282 || -38 |- align=center | align=left | || 4 || 0 || 4 || 262 || 398 || -136 |} :Times given below are in Time in Thailand (UTC+7). ==Women's tournament== ===Participating nations=== * * * * * \u2013 withdrew ===Results=== {| class=wikitable |- ! width=150px|Team !! width=30px| Pts. !! width=20px| W !! width=20px| L !! width=20px| PF !! width=20px| PA !! width=20px| PD |- align=center bgcolor=gold | align=left | || 6 || 3 || 0 || 195 || 159 || +36 |- align=center bgcolor=silver | align=left | || 5 || 2 || 1 || 210 || 162 || +48 |- align=center bgcolor=#cc9966 | align=left | || 4 || 1 || 2 || 177 || 199 || -22 |- align=center | align=left | || 3 || 0 || 3 || 145 || 207 || -62 |} :Times given below are in Time in Thailand (UTC+7). :This game was supposedly to be held on December 9 but host Thailand switched the game schedule placing the Philippines-Thailand game on December 9.SEA Games host Thailand alters sked of RP women cagers :This game was supposedly to be held on December 8 but host Thailand switched the game schedule placing the Philippines-Singapore game on December 8. ==Medal summary== ===Medal tally=== ===Medalists=== {| |- | Men |nowrap=true valign=top| Richard Alonzo Boyet Bautista Beau Belga Jeffrei Chan Jervy Cruz Jonathan Fernandez Gabriel Norwood Frederic Rodriguez Allan Salangsang Eugene Tan Al Vergara Jayson William |nowrap=true valign=top| Raka Cokorda Andrie Ekayana Rony Gunawan Faisal Julius Achmad Andi Poedjakesuma Amin Prihantono Welyanson Situmorang Youbel Sondakh Andre Tiara Wahyu Widayat Jati Mario Wuysang |nowrap=true valign=top| Ang Tun Kaw Chee Li Wei Cheong Yow Keen Chow Kin Hoong Koh Way Tek Koo Chen Jye Satyaseelan Kuppusamy Lau Bik Ing Loh Hoo Won Abdul Kote Yusoff Soo Eng Heng Tan Kian Hoong |- | Women |nowrap=true valign=top| Beh Siew Lian Chan Ying Chee Chow Sion Foong Goh Beng Fong Hee Shook Ying Kew Suik May Lee Siew Fun Low Bee Chuan Pee Yann Yann Teo Woon Yuen Thoh Chai Ling Yong Shin Min |nowrap=true valign=top| Naruemol Banmoo Nantana Charoenrat Chonticha Chirdpetcharat Chonlada Eiamsum-Ang Juthamas Jantakan Supane Ludrodkij Junthathip Mathuros Roong-Aroon Pungkoksoong Wipaporn Saechua Charothai Suksomwong Chanonnan Tunsaw Penphan Yothanan |nowrap=true valign=top| Aurora Adriano Victoria Lynne Brick Joan Grajales Amira Issa Melissa Jacob Diana Rose Jose Machiko Matsuno Minerva Narciza Cassandra Noel Tioseco Fatima Tolentino Sylvia Marie Valencia Emelia Vega |} ==References== ==See also== * Basketball at the Southeast Asian Games * Southeast Asian Championships 2007 ==External links== * Basketball at the official website of the 2007 SEA Games basketball 2007 Category:International basketball competitions hosted by Thailand Category:2007\u201308 in Asian basketball Category:2007\u201308 in Philippine basketball Category:2007\u201308 in Malaysian basketball Category:2007\u201308 in Indonesian basketball Category:2007\u201308 in Singaporean basketball Category:2007\u201308 in Thai basketball Category:2007 in Cambodian sport ",
