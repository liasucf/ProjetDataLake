Chromodoris elisabethina Bergh, 1877. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species on 2015-02-12 Chromodoris elisabethina ==Distribution== This species was described from Burias Island in the Philippines. It is found in the central area of the Indo-Pacific region from Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Queensland, Australia to the southern part of Japan.Rudman, W.B., 1998 (November 19) Chromodoris elisabethina Bergh, 1877. [In] Sea Slug Forum. Australian Museum, Sydney.Bolland, R. (1999) Chromodoris elisabethina Okinawa Slug Site. ==Description== Chromodoris elisabethina can reach a maximum size of length. The body is elongate with a foot which is distinct from the upper body by a skirt like mantle partially hiding the foot. The branched gills and the rhinophores are orange to yellow and can be withdrawn into pockets under the skin in case of danger.Rudman, W.B., 1999 (March 25) Rhinophore in nudibranchs. [In] Sea Slug Forum. Australian Museum, Sydney. The main background colour is bluish, the intensity of the latter varying from blue-grey to intense blue. The blue dorsal side has a median black line which may be broken in some individuals and usually some short, finer parallel lines. These longitudinal lines are also present on the foot. The longitudinal discontinuous lines are distinctive of this species and allow the observer to differentiate it from other close species like Chromodoris lochi, Chromodoris willani and Chromodoris annae.Rudman, W.B. 1982. The Chromodorididae (Opisthobranchia: Mollusca) of the Indo-West Pacific: Chromodoris quadricolor, C. lineolata and Hypselodoris nigrolineata colour groups. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 76: 183-241. page(s): 205 The mantle edge and the foot are bordered with white and orange to yellow lines in which the width and the colour intensity can vary greatly from a specimen to another. The blue colour of the body and the external margin is outlined by a black line.Debelius, Helmut, 2001, Nudibranchs and Sea Snails: Indo-Pacific Field Guide, IKAN - Unterwasserarchiv, Frankfurt, Germany.P.L.
