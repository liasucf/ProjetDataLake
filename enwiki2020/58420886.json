    "text": "Parachelo\u00eftae or Paracheloitai or Paracheloitas ( - meaning \"near the Achelous\") was a town in ancient Aetolia. The town, near the Achelous River, gave name to the fertile plain adjoining it: Parachelo\u00eftis (\u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03bb\u03c9\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2). Apparently, this was older than the town of the same name in Thessaly, as Strabo relates that there, too was a river named Acheolous with giving name to a town. Although the Parachelo\u00eftis is located as the lower flood plain of the modern Achelous River, the site of a town is not given. == References == Category:Populated places in ancient Aetolia Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Lost ancient cities and towns ",
