    "text": "Gartcairn Football Academy Juniors, commonly referred to as Gartcairn Juniors, are a Scottish semi-professional football club from the town of Airdrie, North Lanarkshire who play in the . ==History== The Gartcairn Football Academy was founded in 2007 with two teams at under-8 and under-10 level. Since that time, the club grew to involve 700 players and 60 coaches with teams from the youngest age groups up to an adult amateur side. Gartcairn decided to apply for membership of the Scottish Junior Football Association in 2015, to create an unbroken player pathway to semi-professional level and to provide a playing option for existing local talent in Airdrie and neighbouring Coatbridge. Airdrie had previously had no representation at Junior level since the 1930s. The Academy officially opened their own facility at St Margaret's High School in Airdrie in January 2014, however the Junior side initially had to play out of Coatbridge Outdoor Sports Centre due to certain ground criteria not being met. The club were able to use to their own ground, named MTC Park, from January 2016 after alterations were made. The first team have been managed since the winter of 2019 by William Kinniburgh. The club attracted former Hibernian player Tam McManus out of retirement for their debut Junior season. The club did the same with recently retired former Dundee and Partick Thistle player Gary Harkins in 2020. ==Managers== * Billy McKie (Jun 2015 \u2013 Aug 2015) * Gary Johnstone (Aug 2015 \u2013 Mar 2016) * Gerry Bonham (Mar 2016 \u2013 Dec 2016) * David Greig (Dec 2016 \u2013 May 2018) * Jamie McKenzie (May 2018 \u2013 December 2019) * William Kinniburgh (December 2019 \u2013 present) ==References== ==External links== * Club Website * Club Facebook * Twitter Category:Sport in North Lanarkshire Category:Football clubs in Scotland Category:Scottish Junior Football Association clubs Category:Association football clubs established in 2015 Category:2015 establishments in Scotland Category:Airdrie, North Lanarkshire Category:West of Scotland Football League teams ",
