It is a tiny roundworm used as the first food for larger kinds of newly-hatched fish, such as larval common carp. The microworm is widely used in aquaculture as food for a variety of fish and crustacean species. One of thirteen currently recognized species of Panagrellus, P. redivivus is about 50 \u03bcm in diameter and just over 1 mm in length, barely visible to the naked eye. Subsisting on yeast, it is easily cultured at home on a substrate of flour pasteLinnaeus identified the species in library or book paste. or porridge inoculated with dry yeast.Worm Culture Information Females reach maturity in about three days and deliver live young rather than eggs, as most nematodes produce. The microworm has been used in genetic analysis studies, but not nearly as universally as its relative, Caenorhabditis elegans. In Vietnamese cuisine, using lactic fermented by yeast rice (c\u01a1m m\u1ebb), which contains microworm (con m\u1ebb), to make the sourness of dishes is common. == References == == Further reading == * * *Batchelder, E., \"Panagrellus redivivus\" at Unity College Nematodes == External links == *Photos Category:Rhabditida Category:Pet foods Category:Nematodes described in 1767 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
