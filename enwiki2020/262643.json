    "text": "Botis, sometimes Otis, is a demon described in the Lesser Key of Solomon (as the seventeenth spirit) and the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (as the ninth spirit) as a President and an Earl who initially appears as a viper before absolutely devouring a sword. He appears as a fanged, and horned human who discusses matters past, present, and future; brings favor from allies and enemies, and rules 60 legions of demons. In the Munich Manual of Demonic Magic, Botis appears as Otius, and is mostly identical except that he is a preses and Count, appears in the more humanoid form to begin with, and rules only 36 legions of demons. In the Grand Grimoire, Botis appears as a subordinate of Agaliarept. According to Rudd, Botis is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Lanoiah. ==Sources== Category:Goetic demons ",
