    "text": "Charles Thomas Pick (April 10, 1888 \u2013 June 26, 1954), was a professional baseball player who played second base in the Major Leagues from 1914 to 1920 for the Chicago Cubs, Washington Senators, Philadelphia Athletics, and Boston Braves. He was later the manager of the Sacramento Senators of the Pacific Coast League from 1922\u20131924. Game 3 of the 1918 World Series came to an end with Pick being caught in a rundown between third base and home plate, failing to score on a passed ball, in a 2-1 Chicago loss to the Boston Red Sox. Pick went on to bat .389 for the Series, leading the Cubs in hits. Charlie Pick is one of fourteen players in major league history to record eleven at bats in a single game. On May 1, 1920 he became the only player to record eleven at bats in a game without getting a hit. Playing for the Braves in a 26 inning 1-1 tie against the Brooklyn Robins, Pick set a single game record for batting futility that has not since been equaled by going 0 for 11. Adding to his frustrations at the plate that day, he also committed two errors at second base. ==External links== Category:1888 births Category:1954 deaths Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:Baseball players from Virginia Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Boston Braves players Category:Washington Senators (1901\u20131960) players Category:Philadelphia Athletics players Category:Omaha Rourkes players Category:Terre Haute Terre- iers players Category:Toronto Maple Leafs (International League) players Category:Richmond Climbers players Category:San Francisco Seals (baseball) players Category:Sacramento Senators players Category:Sacramento Solons managers Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Jersey City Skeeters players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:People from Brookneal, Virginia ",
