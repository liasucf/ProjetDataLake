The source files usually have the extension `fjo` or `sma`. == Features == Fj\u00f6lnir is based on the concept of representing programs as trees, and packages by substitutions on trees using algebraic operators.http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=800225.806833 For example, in the Hello World example below, `\"GRUNNUR\"` is a package, the block of code between braces is a package, and `*` is an operator that substitutes names in one package with elements from another. In this case, `skrifastreng` (which writes a string to the standard output) is imported from `\"GRUNNUR\"`. == Code examples == ;; Hello world in Fj\u00f6lnir \"hello\" < main { main -> stef(;) stofn skrifastreng(;\"Hello, world!\"), stofnlok } * \"GRUNNUR\" ; == External links == * Fj\u00f6lnir package (DOS, works in older versions of Windows) * PDF about Fj\u00f6lnir (In Icelandic) * 99 Bottles of Beer in Fj\u00f6lnir * The original source for both Fj\u00f6lnir 1 and Fj\u00f6lnir 2; coded in Fj\u00f6lnir itself. == References == Category:Non-English-based programming languages Category:Icelandic language ",
