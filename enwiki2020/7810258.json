It is home to one of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets training centres. The hamlet of Inskip Moss Side lies about a mile north and east of the village at . ==Etymology== The first part of the name Inskip may be the Brittonic \u00efn\u00efs meaning \"island\" (Welsh ynys), in place names generally referring to dry land in a marshy flood-prone area. Suffixed may be the Brittonic *cib meaning any rounded receptacle, presumably with some topographic sense, Old English -cy:pe or Anglo-Latin cuppa, with the sense \"fish-trap\" recorded for both. ==History== Inskip was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Inscip. Its area was estimated in that survey to be two carucates of land. From 1281, the village was owned by Richard Butler of Rawcliffe Hall. He received it from William de Carleton as a dowry of his bride, Alice. The airfield was formerly referred to as 'HMS Nightjar' while it was a communications centre during World War I and World War II.http://www.controltowers.co.uk/H-K/Inskip_airfield.htmlhttps://aeroengland.photodeck.com/media/b2427a91-fe2a-45ef-9498-bb71b34b0633-rnas- inskip-aka-hms-nightjar-aerial-photograph ==Church== Inskip's church is dedicated to St Peter. It was built in 1848 and was financed by the Earl of Derby and Archdeacon Hornby.
