    "text": "Motola is a 45-year-old female Asian elephant in Thailand who stepped on a landmine in 1999, while working at a logging camp near the Burmese border. The mine mangled her left front foot and leg, and her foot was amputated shortly after. The accident highlighted the dangers of mines that remain from various insurgencies. Motola walked on three legs for a number of years until she was fitted with a prosthetic foot. She received medical care at the Friends of the Asian Elephant Foundation hospital. ==References== ==External links== *Motola's story in photos Category:Individual elephants Category:Landmine victims ",
