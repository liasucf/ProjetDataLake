It is the northernmost municipality of Brazil, with Monte Cabura\u00ed being the northernmost point. West of this mountain, there is also the Monte Roraima, the tallest mountain in Roraima and in Guyana, located in the triple frontier of Brazil, Guyana and Venezuela. Still, Uiramut\u00e3 holds the title of the northernmost urban seat of a municipality in Brazil. Its counterparts in the South, West and East are respectively Chu\u00ed, state of Rio Grande do Sul; M\u00e2ncio Lima, Acre; and Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba. The municipality is located entirely inside the Raposa Serra do Sol Indian Reservation. Because of this, its economic activities are limited. As a result, Uiramut\u00e3 is also noted for being the Brazilian municipality that depends the most on government funds: 80% of its income is provided by the public administration, including social insurance and welfare programs such as the Bolsa Fam\u00edlia. The municipality contains the Monte Roraima National Park, a protected area created in 1989. == References == Category:Municipalities in Roraima Category:Populated places established in 1995 ",
