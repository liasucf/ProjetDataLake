Due to his prominence and influence as a scholar, he had been brought into the government fold and given the title of Firqa Meshir, chief of the army. Rizwani was a follower of Islamic scholar Muhammad Atta-ullah Faizani, and headed his own Islamist group, mainly composed of army personnel, called Qiyam-i Islami (Islamic Uprising), which plotted an abortive coup against the government of President Mohammed Daoud Khan. The coup was preempted; Rizwani and 50 of his associates (such as Sayyid Ismail Pasikh and Akhtar Mohammad Sulaimankhel) were arrested on December 9, 1976, and Rizwani executed in 1978 following the communist takeover. His associates who survived fled to Pakistan. ==References== Category:Afghan military personnel Category:Afghan religious leaders Category:20th-century executions by Afghanistan Category:1978 deaths Category:Attempted coups d'\u00e9tat ",
