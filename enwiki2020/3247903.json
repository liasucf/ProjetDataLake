During its short ten-year history, the team managed several notable domestic performances. Originally founded in 2008 as FCM T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, it changed its name five years later to ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219. The new acronym and the red and blue equipment were meant to closely resemble the identity of one of the former clubs in the city, which was dissolved in 2005. ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 won its first major trophy after defeating FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti in the 2015 Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei, having earned its place in the competition after coming second in the Liga I championship the previous campaign. Ro\u0219-alba\u0219trii recorded their only European appearance in the 2015\u201316 edition of the UEFA Europa League, when they were eliminated by Saint-\u00c9tienne in the third qualifying round. In January 2018, the club announced its withdrawal from the second division after a period marked by insolvency and financial problems, announcing a future reorganization from the summer of that year.EXCLUSIV / ASA Targu Mures se desfiinteaza: \u201eJucatorii si-au gasit alte echipe\u201d . sptfm.ro ==History== ===Early years=== The team was founded in 2008 as FCM T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, becoming the city's main football team, as a successor to CS T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (dissolved in 1960), Mure\u0219ul T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (dissolved in 1964), and the original ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (dissolved in 2005). They bought a spot from the newly promoted Unirea S\u00e2nnicolau Mare, consequently playing in the 2008\u201309 Liga II. FCM outperformed the predictions and played well throughout the season, winning 16 games and drawing 9, while scoring 54 goals and receiving 27, the fewest in the Seria II. At the end of the season, the team was very close to promote to the Liga I, finishing third with 57 points. The following season, the club finished first in their series with 69 points, winning 20 games, drawing 9 and losing 3. The team scored 52 goals and received 20 (the fewest goals received in their series, like the year before) and was promoted for the first time in its history to the Liga I. Eighteen years had passed since the city's last presence in the Romanian top football league (1991\u201392 season with ASA). ===Promotion to Liga I=== FCM debuted in Liga I by finishing 9th in the table, the same number of points as the defending champions, CFR Cluj, and Astra Ploie\u0219ti. Ioan Ovidiu Sab\u0103u led the team to a fantastic streak, at ten points behind Gaz Metan Media\u0219, the last team who took an UEFA Europa League spot. The next season, the club failed to maintain its position in the Liga I, finishing 15th, the highest place in the relegation zone. One team from the second division, Politehnica Timi\u0219oara, did not receive its licence for the first league, so the Romanian Football Federation had to decide whether to keep the first team under the relegation line, FCM T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, or to promote the team placed third in the Seria II, behind Timi\u0219oara. Finally, the FRF decided that Gaz Metan Severin should be promoted, thus FCM ended up being relegated. ===Return to Liga II=== Former logo The board of directors fixed as an objective for the 2012\u201313 season the promotion back to the Liga I. However, the team couldn't keep the rhythm set by Corona Bra\u0219ov and ACS Poli Timi\u0219oara, and after the first half of the season it was behind the earlier mentioned two in the league table. The second half of the season was even worse, FCM ending fifth in the West Division of Liga II, ten points behind ACS Poli, which took the second promoting place. ===Name change and back to first division=== In 2013, the club changed its name from Fotbal Club Municipal T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 to Asocia\u021bia Sportiv\u0103 Ardealul 2013 T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219. At the end of 2013\u201314 Liga II they finished second and entered Liga I for the first time with the new name. ====2014\u201315 season==== On 16 July 2014, the team debuted in Cupa Ligii (), Romania's secondary club football tournament, and lost their first ever match in the competition against CSMS Ia\u0219i. It was an extraordinary season for \"The Red-Blues\", securing their very first qualification in a European competition, by finishing second, and winning against two-time defending champions Steaua Bucure\u0219ti both home and away. After the away victory over Steaua, T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 seized the first place and was close to obtain a historical league title, however, after a 1\u20133 loss to Astra Giurgiu, the team fell back to the second place. However, T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 kept chances to winning the championship after Steaua's 0\u20130 draw against CSMS Ia\u0219i, having to win against relegated O\u021belul Gala\u021bi. Mure\u0219 side went to a 1\u20130 lead, but lost the title after O\u021belul turned the score to 1\u20132. ====2015\u201316 season==== On 9 July 2015, T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 earned a spot in the Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei as championship runners-up last season. The club faced FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti, which won the domestic treble (Championship, Cup and League Cup), and defeated them 1\u20130, after a goal scored in the 63rd minute by Mircea Axente, who also received the \"Man of the Match\" award. This was the club's first major trophy. The team was led by manager Dan Petrescu, who resigned after only one match, due to the financial problems which had appeared in recent days. Shortly after, Vasile Miriu\u021b\u0103 was revealed as the new coach. On July 17, it was announced that T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 would face AS Saint- \u00c9tienne in the UEFA Europa League third qualifying round. The club only managed to win the second leg in France 2\u20131, and was eliminated after 2\u20134 on aggregate. T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 signed former Romanian international Adrian Mutu for the latter half of the 2015\u201316 season, being his last team of his playing career. ==Chronology of names== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align: left;\" |- !
