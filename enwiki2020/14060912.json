In 1942, during the occupation of Denmark, he established an architectural practice in Virum north of Copenhagen. In the following decades he left a stamp on buildings in contiguously built-up urban areas of Copenhagen. He was behind the highrise blocks on Sorgenfrivang, the single-family houses on Klosterbakken and the renovation of Virum School among others.
