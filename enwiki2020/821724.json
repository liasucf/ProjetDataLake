    "text": "The Lace Curtain was an occasional literary magazine founded and edited by Michael Smith and Trevor Joyce under their New Writers Press imprint. Both press and journal were dedicated to expanding the horizons of Irish poetry by rediscovering a native modernist tradition, publishing younger Irish poets who were working in modes that sat outside the mainstream and introducing innovative non-Irish writing to an Irish audience. The journal ran to six issues spanning the period 1969 - 1978. Contributors included Anthony Cronin, Eil\u00e9an N\u00ed Chuillean\u00e1in, Michael Hartnett, Augustus Young, John Montague, Antonio Machado, Paul Durcan, Desmond O'Grady, Brian Coffey Denis Devlin, Georg Trakl, Samuel Beckett, Thomas MacGreevy, Thomas Kinsella, Derek Mahon, Austin Clarke and Pablo Neruda. N\u00ed Chuillean\u00e1in co-founded Cyphers, which first appeared as The Lace Curtains penultimate edition was published. ==References== Print Online *Checklist of New Writers Press publications including full contributor listings for The Lace Curtain Category:Defunct literary magazines published in Europe Category:Defunct magazines published in Ireland Category:Literary magazines published in Ireland Category:Magazines established in 1969 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1978 Category:Poetry literary magazines ",
