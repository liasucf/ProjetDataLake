    "text": "Paul Tasch (born November 28, 1910 in New York City, died July 13, 2001 in Wichita, Kansas) was an American paleontologist. Tasch served in the US Army Signal Corps during World War II. He graduated from City College of New York with a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1948, and from Pennsylvania State University with a master\u2019s degree in 1950. Tasch received his doctorate in 1952 from the State University of Iowa, and was an instructor at the University of Connecticut and from 1953 assistant professor at the North Dakota Agriculture College. In 1954 he became an associate professor at Moorhead State University and in 1955 professor at Wichita State University. He retired in 1982. As a paleontologist, he studied Conchostraca. He used the paleogeography of fossil clam shrimp in the southern hemisphere (including Antarctica) and the clues that result from it to support the theory of continental drift. He also did research on fossil bacteria in Permian salt formations, and in the history of geology (especially Charles Darwin and Charles Lyell). He contributed the Branchiopoda chapter to the Arthropoda volume of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. In 1970 he received the Antarctic Service Medal from the US Congress. Tasch Peak in the Crary Mountains in Antarctica is named after him. ==References== Category:1901 births Category:2001 deaths Category:American paleontologists Category:20th-century American scientists Category:City College of New York alumni Category:Pennsylvania State University alumni Category:University of Iowa alumni Category:Wichita State University faculty Category:People from New York City ",
