    "text": "Quasimodo is a student newspaper published by the Fremantle Student Association at the University of Notre Dame Australia. The magazine takes its name from Quasimodo, Victor Hugo's fictional bell-ringer and protagonist of Notre Dame de Paris ==Politics== In 2005, former Quasi editor Chris Bailey charged that the university's Catholic hierarchy sought to restrict the range of topics discussed in the magazine, telling The Australian that he and other contributors were \"unofficially told by university staff that students involved in defying the university may be kicked out of uni.\" Upcoming editions are vetted by a review committee of university and student representatives \u2013 \"Quasimodo now is very much G-rated\" as a result, Bailey claimed. One Quasi edition, containing an article on the morning-after pill, was banned by vice-chancellor Peter Tannock. ==References== * Christopher van Opstal: The art of censorship Category:1990 establishments in Australia Category:Magazines established in 1990 Category:Student newspapers published in Australia Category:Conservative magazines Category:University of Notre Dame Category:Conservatism in Australia Category:Magazines published in Sydney Category:Student magazines ",
