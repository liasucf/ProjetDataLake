He sent his first article in November 1994, to the Distour Newspaper, and was laughed at for his young age and first-time writer status by the people at the post office (this was before the start of the internet, so you had to write articles and send them by mailing). He would publish four other articles for Al-Distour, however, they wouldn't send him any revenue for the published articles. He paused after the 4th article for this cause. === Career at Al-Ra'ee (1994\u20132001) === In 1994, after pausing his writing for Al-Distour newspaper, Mohammed Barhouma, looked for other newspapers. He wrote for Al-Ray'ee Newspaper. This was his regular temporary job, where he used revenues to pay for his mom's essentials, since she stopped sewing due to old age and lack of concentration. During these seven years (1994\u20132001), Mohammed Barhouma would publish around 200 articles in Al-Raee, some articles were even featured on the front cover, gaining him status and reputation for his fresh start as a 21-year-old political writer, which at the time was unheard of, especially in politics, were authors were in the old age of over 45.

Some comments from political websites on this major work include: > \"It can be said that this study attempts to stare critically at the ideals > and religious values, reform and restructure them and put moral > consciousness and the ethical issue in their appropriate practical context, > by exposing them to the considerations of rights culture and private and > public freedoms, as stated in the International Covenants. The human > consciousness that has settled in our time on the centrality and > independence of the human being, linking it to the issue of power, > governance and public affairs management, to the establishment of the idea > of faith as a direct relationship with human knowledge, science, culture and > freedom, is not an inverse relationship with all that. \" Eram News \u2666 Another commentary by Riy'e-El-Youm: > \"In his new book he works on the idea of his boss to say that the idea of > moral reform seeks to prevent the clash of religion with freedom or the > shackling of knowledge. He believes that there is no complete effort or > project for Renaissance, enlightenment and religious reform in the Arab > region and the Islamic world, in general, without engaging in the idea of > reforming the ideals and religious values, and providing scientifically > coherent theoretical and philosophical efforts regarding the nature of the > relationship between religion and morality, by building On the ideas and > efforts scattered in the Arab and Islamic heritage discussed this issue in > the past, and the approach of the moral question, but did not insist on > criticizing those ideas and efforts and dismantling, organizing, developing > and framing them in the context of the development of \"ethics\" in Arab > civilization based on the human common General. Mohamed Barhouma draws > attention to the fact that this was available in the golden centuries of > Islamic civilization, especially in the period between the 2nd and 5th > century Hijri, but the civilized retreat that began with the ages of > decadence prevented the crystallization of this great civilized project.\" \u2666 Another commentary by 2ooli News, about the book, quoted: > \"This study comes at a political time when Salafist jihadist currents kidnap > the human, moral and civilized dimension of Islam, and hence the study > focuses on saying that the location of human morality in the fields of faith > and Sharia in the form provided by Salafi religious thinking and the owners > Religious ideologies can justify what is immoral in the name of religion, > when it is transformed into an ideology, and when religious texts and > teachings are interpreted in a strict manner that collide with the needs and > interests of people and their human and human gains as presented and > provided by the experiences of political Islam and Salafists In more than > one Arab or Islamic country, where the moral, human and civilized dimension > of Islam is almost in the test.\" \u2013 2ooli News == Records == Other than book reviews and commentaries from known political review websites, Mohammed Barhouma earned records in article attention.
