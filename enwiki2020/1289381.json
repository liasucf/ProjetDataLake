Both aircraft were replaced with two A300-600RFs owned by Air Macau. These two Airbus A300 left the company in 2012. Two old A321-100 were replaced by two new A321-200 in 2013. In 2020 two Airbus A319-100 were retired. ===Livery=== Although Air Macau serves as Macau's flag carrier, the Special Administrative Region of Macau flag has never appeared on any of its aircraft, similar to Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific. However, unlike Cathay Pacific, which carried a Union Jack on its aircraft prior to the Hong Kong SAR's 1997 handover, the flag of Portugal never appear on any Air Macau aircraft prior to the 1999 handover. ===Macau Asia Express=== Macau Asia Express was a failed low-cost airline project, which was to be based in Macau and originally to be launched in 2007, offering scheduled flights mostly to mainland China. It was founded on 24 January 2006 with an initial funding of $30 million. It was owned by Air Macau (51%) and ST-CNAC (CNAC and Shun Tak Holdings) (49%). The aircraft fleet would have consisted of 6 Airbus A320 short-medium haul jet aircraft, which was planned to be expanded to 15-20 aircraft over the first years in operation. In November 2007, the Macau Daily News reported that Macau Asia Express was suffering funding problems, which led to a delay at the taking-over of the already ordered aircraft, and finally the revocal of the Air Operator's Certificate in 2008. ==See also== * Transport in Macau == References == == External links == * Category:Airlines of Macau Category:IATA members Category:Airlines established in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in Macau Category:Brands of Macau *[ C]: Business Class *[Y]: Economy Class ",
