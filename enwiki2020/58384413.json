    "text": "Deivi Anderson Garc\u00eda (born May 19, 1999) is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut in 2020. ==Early life== Garc\u00eda was born and grew up in Bonao, Dominican Republic. He has two older brothers. His father, a youth baseball coach, also coached Garc\u00eda as a youngster. His mother, a doctor, set aside her career to raise their family. ==Career== Garc\u00eda signed with the New York Yankees in July 2015 for a $200,000 signing bonus. Though he previously played baseball as an infielder and an outfielder, the Yankees had him become a pitcher due to his throwing arm strength. In 2018, Garc\u00eda pitched for the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League and the Tampa Tarpons of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. He made his final start of the 2018 season with the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League. Garc\u00eda returned to Tampa in 2019, and was promoted to Trenton after making four starts. In July he was selected to play in the All-Star Futures Game. After the game, he was promoted to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International League. Following the 2019 season, the Yankees added Garc\u00eda to their 40-man roster to protect him from becoming eligible in the Rule 5 draft. Garc\u00eda was named minor league pitcher of the year in the Yankees organization in 2019. The Yankees sent Garc\u00eda to their alternate training site to begin the 2020 season. He made his major league debut for the Yankees on August 30. He pitched six innings on 75 pitches, allowing four singles, one unearned run, no walks, and had six strikeouts in a no-decision. He had a 3\u20132 record with a 4.98 ERA in six starts during the 2020 season, and will start Game 2 of the 2020 American League Division Series. ==References== ==External links== Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:All-Star Futures Game players Category:Charleston RiverDogs players Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Dominican Summer League Yankees players Category:Gulf Coast Yankees players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic Category:New York Yankees players Category:People from Bonao Category:Pulaski Yankees players Category:Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders players Category:Tampa Tarpons players Category:Trenton Thunder players ",
