    "text": "Evert \"Eef\" Gerardus Dolman (22 February 1946 - 12 May 1993) was a Dutch racing cyclist, who won the gold medal in the 100 km team trial at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, alongside Gerben Karstens, Bart Zoet, and Jan Pieterse. His sporting career began with Apollo Rotterdam. He became Dutch champion in 1967 and 1968, but was later stripped of his 1967 title because of doping. He said in an interview with the Dutch magazine Wielerrevue that his racing career had been undermined by drug-taking and what he described as the witch-hunt conducted in the first years of drug-testing in the 1960s. == Palmar\u00e8s == ;1964 : Olympic title team time trial ;1965 :Ronde van Noord- Holland :Ronde van Limburg ;1966 : World amateur road race champion :Ronde van Gelderland :Tour de Namur ;1967 :Stage 6 of Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a ;1968 :Goirle : Dutch National Road Race Championship :Ulestraten ;1969 :1st stage of Tour de Luxembourg :Mijl van Mares :Monaco ;1970 :Kortenhoef ;1971 :Tour of Flanders ==See also== * List of Dutch Olympic cyclists == References == == External links == * *Official Tour de France results for Evert Dolman Category:1946 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Dutch male cyclists Category:Cyclists at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic cyclists of the Netherlands Category:Olympic gold medalists for the Netherlands Category:Sportspeople from Rotterdam Category:Dutch Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a stage winners Category:Olympic medalists in cycling Category:Medalists at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a cyclists Category:UCI Road World Championships cyclists for the Netherlands Category:Tour de France cyclists ",
