As the second largest lake in the canton of Zurich (Lake Zurich being the largest), it is about long and at the widest point, with a maximum depth of . The Aabach (Greifensee) (or just Aa) is the main supplying river, while its outlet is the Glatt. On its southeastern end the M\u00f6nchaltorfer Aa (or just Aa) enters the Greifensee. == Points of interest == Boat on the Greifensee Steamship \"Greif\" (built in 1895) A boat connects small towns along the edge of the lake, Maur, Niederuster, F\u00e4llanden, M\u00f6nchaltorf and the town Greifensee with its charming Altstadt and Greifensee castle. Greifensee is the scene of the Greifensee-Lauf, a semi- marathon around the lake held every year. Greifensee is a popular recreation area for biking and inline skating on the paved recreation path around the lake. Easy hiking trails follow the water and pass Greifensee castle before entering a nature preserve. There are well maintained bicycle roads all around the lake as well as on the banks of Aabach. == Nature == The lakeside is under UNESCO protection, and buildings are not allowed, resulting in reed bed and a rich fauna and flora: Around 400 plant species in the lake and 19 species in its tributaries. The nature reserves are important for the birds breeding there including more than 120 migratory species. == Cultural Heritage == The lake was known as Glattsee (after the Glatt) in the medieval periodMure bi Glattese, Orig ZUB VI; 2285; 248 (1294); Mure bi Glatse, Orig ZUB VIII; 3097; 349 (1311).
