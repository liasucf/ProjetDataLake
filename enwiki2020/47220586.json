Variety and Twitch Film both praised the film for its approach to old school action, with film critic Chase Whale of Twitch writing that it was \"a rollicking blast. It brings the pain and something a lot of action movies are missing these days: fun\". The Hollywood Reporter was more mixed in its review, stating that \"the scenes inside the barricaded station offer plenty of tension and crazy-enough-to-work schemes with which the outgunned, outnumbered good guys might outwit their captors. But the movie can't forget the grating premise that got it to this point\". The Action Elite gave the film 4.5 stars and called it \"one of the best action films of the year\", while Shock Till You Drop described it as \"a fun ride filled with fights, guns and more blood than you can fill a barrel with. It's a damn fun night at the movies\". === Accolades === The film won the Canadian Society of Cinematographers CSC award for 'Best Cinematography' as well as 'Best Action Film' at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival == References == == External links == * * Category:2015 films Category:Canadian films Category:Films shot in Toronto Category:Canadian action thriller films Category:2015 action thriller films ",
