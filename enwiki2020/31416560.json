Cinq m\u00e9lodies \"de Venise\", Op. 58, is a song cycle by Gabriel Faur\u00e9, of five m\u00e9lodies for voice and piano. Composed in 1891, the cycle is based on five poems by Paul Verlaine,Orledge (1979), p. 295 from the collections F\u00eates galantes and Romances sans paroles.Nectoux (2004), p. 179 According to Faur\u00e9 himself, the song cycle contains a number of musical themes which recur from song to song. He used a similar technique for his later song cycle La bonne chanson,Orledge (1979), pp. 78\u201381 which was also based on Verlaine's poetry.Orledge (1979), pp. 296\u2013297 ==Composition== Faur\u00e9 composed the first song, \"Mandoline\", in May 1891 in Venice.Nectoux (2004), p. 510 He was staying in the Palazzo Volkoff (or Wolkoff) on the Grand Canal,Johnson (2009), p. 217 as a guest of Winnaretta Singer, the future Princess de Polignac.Nectoux (2004), p. 35 Among Singer's other guests were the painter Ernest Ange Duez and his wife Am\u00e9lie. She was a singer, and entertained the group with Faur\u00e9's new composition.Johnson (2009), p. 210 Only \"Mandoline\" and part of \"En sourdine\" were composed in Venice. The idea of creating a cycle seems to have come to Faur\u00e9 only after his return to Paris on 20 June. The rest of the songs were completed in Paris by September 1891. The cycle was published by Hamelle that year, dedicated to Singer. It was published in England in 1896 by Metzler, with an English translation by Adela Maddison. Faur\u00e9 wrote to Singer in September 1891 that he believed that with this song cycle he had created a new form, whereby the return of the themes of the other songs in the final one, \"C'est l'extase\", made the songs into a kind of suite.Orledge (1979), p. 78 ==Settings== Faur\u00e9's settings of Verlaine's poems are as follows: #\"Mandoline\" (from F\u00eates galantes) #\"En sourdine\" (from F\u00eates galantes) #\"Green\" (from Romances sans paroles) #\"\u00c0 Clym\u00e8ne\" (from F\u00eates galantes) #\"C'est l'extase\" (from Romances sans paroles) ==Premieres== \"Mandoline\" was premiered at the salon of Marguerite Baugnies on 21 June 1891, the day after Faur\u00e9's return to Paris from Italy.Nectoux (2004), p. 178 Cinq m\u00e9lodies \"de Venise\" had its premiere at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique on 2 April 1892, sung by Maurice Bag\u00e8s. ==References== ==Sources== * * * ==External links== * *French texts with English translations, at The Lied, Art Song, and Choral Texts Page Category:Song cycles by Gabriel Faur\u00e9 Category:1891 compositions Category:M\u00e9lodies Category:Musical settings of poems by Paul Verlaine Category:Classical song cycles in French ",
