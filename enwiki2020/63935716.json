His mother is sometimes said to have been the Elizabeth Schaw who a mistress of James V of Scotland and mother of James Stewart, Commendator of Kelso, but she died in 1536. He was however a kinsman of the Master of Work, William Schaw and Elizabeth Schaw, Countess of Annandale. His home, Carribber, is near Linlithgow. His other residence was Knock, in Fife, close to the present day Knockhill Racing Circuit. The surname was often spelled \"Gib\". ==Court life== Robert Gibb of Carribber served James V of Scotland as Esquire of the Stable.Andrea Thomas, Princelie Majestie: The Court of James V of Scotland (Edinburgh, 2005), p. 228. John Gibb was a valet of the chamber of James VI of Scotland from 1576.Amy Juhala, 'For the King Favours Them Very Strangely', in Miles Kerr-Peterson and Steven J. Reid, James VI and Noble Power (Routledge: Abingdon, 2017), p. 171. In February 1580 he was payed for supplying tennis balls to the royal tennis court, called the \"catchepule\". The tennis court for James VI at Stirling Castle had been constructed from timber in June 1576.Charles Thorpe McInnes, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1574-1580, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1978), pp. 131, 307. In October 1582 he met Walter Keyre at Leith, a messenger from the Duke of Lennox who was staying at Rothesay Castle, displaced from his favour at court by the Gowrie Regime. James VI spoke to Gibb privately about the meeting in the \"stole\" or garderobe at Holyrood Palace. The English ambassador Robert Bowes heard the king advise Gibb that the Duke and Keyre ought not to endanger themselves by sending messages.Bowes Correspondence (London, 1843), pp. 205-6: Roderick J. Lyall, Alexander Montgomerie: Poetry, Politics, and Cultural Change in Jacobean Scotland (Arizona, 2005), p. 97.

In October 1589 the Provost John Arnot formally gave the jewel back to the king as a marriage gift.David Masson, Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 420. It was delivered by Clerk's son-in-law John Provand to William Fairlie, who commissioned the goldsmith David Gilbert to upgrade and refashion it, and it was presented to Anne of Denmark during her Entry to Edinburgh in May 1590.Marguerite Wood, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589-1603, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 7. Gibb was in charge of jewels in the king's use, and in October 1584 transferred several pieces to the keeping of the Master of the Wardrobe, Patrick, Master of Gray. Some of the jewels had recently been in the possession of Colonel William Stewart. One tablet or locket had been a gift from the Laird of Rosyth. A little hat badge with diamonds and sparks of rubies was a recent present from Queen Elizabeth. A diamond cross was one of the jewels of Mary, Queen of Scots.Thomas Thomson, Collection of Inventories (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 314-16. The grooms and valets of the chamber were also in charge of the king's linen. In October 1590 he was paid for ruffs, napkins, shirts, caps called \"mutches\", and sheets supplied to the king since 1588.

In August 1591 Gibb was given \u00a3240 to buy clothes for Danish servants of Anne of Denmark who were returning home.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), p. 133. The king also bought clothes for John Gibb, including in February 1591 a cloak of black Naples taffeta, and a black satin doublet with black velvet breeches.National Records of Scotland, E35/13 f.13r, account of Robert Jousie. ==Letters and messages at court== John Gibb continued as a servant in the bedchamber in England after the Union of the Crowns. Gibb was the messenger who brought reprieves from the death sentence for Markham, Grey, and Cobham at Winchester. On 24 October Gibb, John Auchmoutie, John Murray, and George Murray, grooms of the bedchamber were given winter clothing.George Duncan Gibb, Life and times of Robert Gib, Lord of Carriber, vol. 2 (London, 1874), pp. 2, 13. As a member of the king's chamber Gibb was able to forward the business of petitioners. In 1607 Maurice Peeters complained to Robert Cecil that his plan for reforming the manufacture of fabrics in England made from Persian bombazine cotton without wool, and his patent for silk dyeing had been forwarded by Gibb, but then Gibb took it up with other partners and promoted it to the king, to the loss, Peeters claimed, of Cecil and Anne of Denmark.M. S. Giuseppi & David McN. Lockie, HMC Salisbury Hatfield, 19 (London, 1965), p. 450. ===Henry Gibb=== His younger son Henry Gibb also had a bedchamber position. He was first a groom of the bedchamber to Prince Henry.George Duncan Gibb, Life and times of Robert Gib, Lord of Carriber, vol. 2 (London, 1874), pp. 42, 100. John Gibb obtained the lands of Kilcroft and Carriber and transferred them to Henry Gibb.Gordon MacGregor, 'Gibb of Carriber', Red Book of Scotland, vol. 4 (2020), pp. 512. In September 1613 Henry Gibb and Mr May travelled to Veere and Sluis to prevent Henry Howard, a son of the Earl of Suffolk fighting a duel with the Earl of Essex over issues concerning his sister Frances Howard and the annulment of her marriage.William Shaw & G. Dyfnallt Owen, HMC 77 Viscount De L'Isle, Penshurst, vol. 5 (London, 1961), pp. 120-3.HMC Mar & Kellie, vol. 2 (London, 1930), p. 54. Young Gibb was part of an incident in 1615 connected with the fall of the Scottish favourite, Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, who had married Frances Howard. He passed a letter and message from Somerset's message to Anne of Denmark's servant, his kinswoman Elizabeth Schaw, Mrs Murray. This caused the queen offence and difficulties for Scottish courtiers including Schaw's husband John Murray of the Bedchamber. The Countess of Eglinton heard about the affair and she wrote to the Murrays about Somerset, who she described as the \"errant liar\", who \"wret to you and message sent with that ungret fullich cousing of yours, Herie Gib.\" He lost his place at court for a while.James Maidment, Letters and State Papers of James the Sixth (Edinburgh, 1838), pp. 289-91, now NLS Adv. MS 33.1.1 vol. 10 no. 120: Thomas Birch (Folkestone Williams), Court and Times of James the First vol. 1 (London, 1848), p. 367 The early biographer of King James Arthur Wilson has a version of these events, saying the letter or message carried by Henry Gibb was intended for King James. It came from a Scottish man called Lumsden and described the actions of Richard Weston, the keeper of the Tower of London, and was critical of the lawyer Edward Coke. Francis Bacon said it was a libel and slander,George Duncan Gibb, Life and times of Robert Gib, Lord of Carriber, vol. 2 (London, 1874), pp. 131-3: Arthur Wilson, The History of Great Britain: Being the Life and Reign of King James the First (London, 1653), pp. 81-88. ===John Gibb humiliated at court=== In April 1616 John Gibb was questioned with Sir Robert Kerr about missing letters and documents and they were placed in the custody of Sir James Fullerton.Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 1 (Philadelphia, 1939), pp. 609, 625-6. According to an old story, at Theobalds in 1622 the king had misplaced some papers relating to a Spanish treaty, and became angry and frustrated, and insisted that John Gibb had them. Gibb threw himself on the floor saying he had never had the papers, and James kicked him. Gibb abandoned his humility and said wouldn't put up with it any more, and rode away to London. Endymion Porter hearing of this remembered he had the documents. James sent messengers to bring Gibb back to Theobalds and kneeled in front of his servant to beg forgiveness. The incident was an illustration of the imbalance in the king's humours for the biographer Arthur Wilson.Arthur Wilson, The History of Great Britain: Being the Life and Reign of King James the First (London, 1653), p. 219. Thomas Middleton made this affair into a stage play as The Nice Valour, in which the Duke whips a courtier, Shamont, in the face, but later apologises and devotes himself to justice. The scene would read as a compliment to the king.Swapan Chakravorty, Society and Politics in the Plays of Thomas Middleton (Oxford, 1996), pp. 112-3. In 1618 John Taylor, the Water Poet, came to Dunfermline and lodged at John Gibb's house, presumably part of the palace. Taylor said Gibb, who was not there, was \"the oldest servant the king hath.\" A Mr Crighton showed Taylor around the palace.John Taylor, 'Pennilesse Pilgrimage', All the Workes of John Taylor, the Water Poet (London, 1630), p. 132.

John Gibb's sister, Elizabeth Gibb, married the king's tutor Peter Young in 1577. She became a gentlewoman in the household of Anna of Denmark and made head coverings and veils for riding for the queen.Jemma Field, 'Dressing a Queen: The Wardrobe of Anna of Denmark at the Scottish Court of King James VI, 1590\u20131603', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019), pp. 160-3. A Thomas Gibb was recorded as a servant of Anne of Denmark in September 1601 when his daughter Isobel was baptised at Dunfermline.George Duncan Gibb, Life and times of Robert Gib, Lord of Carriber, vol. 2 (London, 1874), pp. 97-8. ==References== ==External links== *'Carribber Castle', HES/RCAHMS Canmore Category:Court of James VI and I Category:1628 deaths Category:17th-century Scottish people Category:16th-century Scottish people Category:People from West Lothian ",
