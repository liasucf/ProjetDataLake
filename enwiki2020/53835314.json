    "text": "United Lutheran Seminary, located in Pennsylvania with campuses in Gettysburg and Philadelphia, is one of the seven seminaries of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. == History == === Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg === On September 5, 1826, what is now the oldest Lutheran seminary in the Americas held its first classes with eight students in the small borough of Gettysburg. In 1832, the seminary relocated to Seminary Ridge overlooking Gettysburg, becoming the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg. In July 1863, the seminary's premises and environs became the stage for the Battle of Gettysburg. Schmucker Hall. the original seminary building, is today a museum, dedicated to the battle that took place there, the role of faith in freedom in nineteenth century America, and also civil war medical practices. Schmucker Hall was the largest fixed field hospital at Gettysburg. === Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia === Founded by the Ministerium of Pennsylvania in 1864 to preserve both Lutheran identity and the study of and instruction in the German language, the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia was first located in the Center City District. It relocated to Mount Airy in 1889, a historic site where the first shots of the American Revolution's Battle of Germantown had been fired a century before. == Merger == The current school was founded on July 1, 2017, as a consolidation of the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg and the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia. United Lutheran Seminary will continue under the charter of Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg. The first president of the seminary, Rev. Dr. Theresa F. Latini, a Presbyterian, was announced on April 20, 2017. Latini's previous experience working for OneByOne, an organization that performed \"gay conversion\", caused significant controversy and she was fired on March 14, 2018. The Rev. James Dunlop, bishop of the Lower Susquehanna Synod, ELCA, served as Acting President, and on May 16, 2018, the seminary board announced its selection of Dr. Richard Green as Interim President, beginning June 1. On June 9, 2020 the seminary board announced the election of the Rev. Dr. R. Guy Erwin as president. Erwin was previously bishop of the Southwest California Synod of the ELCA. He is the first Native American bishop of that church-body and first openly gay bishop of that church body. == Notable faculty == *Paul Rajashekar == Notable affiliations == In 1835 Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg welcomed one of the first African Americans to study theology in America, Daniel Alexander Payne, who later became a bishop in the AME Church and the first president of Wilberforce University under AME auspices. A century after its early integration, Gettysburg was also the first among American Lutheran seminaries to grant tenure to a female professor, Dr Bertha Paulssen. Graduating in 1965 was Elizabeth Platz, the first woman to be ordained (in 1970) by a U.S. Lutheran body. Following his graduation from the Philadelphia Seminary, Franklin Clark Fry was elected to the presidency of the United Lutheran Church, The Lutheran World Federation, and the World Council of Churches. On April 7, 1958, Fry was featured on the cover of TIME. Among its student awards, United Lutheran Seminary awards annual prizes for Excellence in Writing and Excellence in Preaching in honor of the acclaimed American author and ordained Presbyterian minister, Frederick Buechner. Winners of the prizes are selected by faculty in recognition of their significant achievements in each area. Additionally, the seminary has regularly distributed copies of Buechner's works among its students. == References == Category:American Civil War sites Category:Cemeteries in Pennsylvania Category:Educational institutions established in 2017 Category:Gettysburg Battlefield Category:Lutheran buildings and structures in North America Category:Lutheran seminaries Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania Category:Universities and colleges in Adams County, Pennsylvania Category:2017 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Pennsylvania Category:National Register of Historic Places in Adams County, Pennsylvania Category:Lutheran cemeteries in the United States ",
