    "text": "Hoxne manor in Suffolk, England was mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Survey as a seat of the East Anglian bishops, from around that date being the bishops of Norwich, a transition from the bishops of Thetford. The Domesday name of Hoxne hundred, annexed to the manor, was \"Bishop's Hundred\". At this point Herbert Losinga took Hoxne as a key location from which to compete with the Abbot of St Edmunds; he rededicated the church at Hoxne to honour Edmund the Martyr, and kept control of the Hoxne manor house, though himself locating elsewhere. Bishops Thomas Brunce and Walter Lyhert died there during the 15th century. It was a residential episcopal manor, and probably the site of a bishop's palace. The manor house still belonged to the Bishop of Norwich, under the name Hoxun Court, during the reign of Henry VIII of England; it passed to the king in 1535.Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII, Volume 12 Part 1: January\u2013May 1537, no. 1284A Woman of the Tudor Age, Cecilie Goff, p.85 The manor house site was then occupied by Hoxne Hall; it was seat of the Maynard family, before passing to the Kerrisons, being the seat of the Kerrison Baronets.http://www.leighrayment.com/baronetage/baronetsK.htm Under the later name Oakley Park it lasted until the twentieth century, but was demolished in the period 1920\u20131930. ==References== Category:Tudor England Category:Country houses in Suffolk Category:Hoxne ",
