    "text": "Sad Caf\u00e9 are an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1976, who achieved their peak of popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They are best known for the UK Top 40 singles \"Every Day Hurts\", \"Strange Little Girl\", \"My Oh My\" and \"I'm in Love Again\", the first of which was their biggest hit, reaching number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in 1979. The band also had two US Billboard Hot 100 hits with \"Run Home Girl\" and \"La-Di-Da\". Frontman Paul Young went on to achieve greater chart success as the co-lead singer (with Paul Carrack) of Mike + The Mechanics. ==History== The group formed as a result of the unification of rock bands Mandalaband and Gyro. Its founder members were Paul Young (vocals), Ian Wilson (guitar), Vic Emerson (keyboards), Ashley Mulford (lead guitar), John Stimpson (bass) and Tony Cresswell (drums). Over the course of the band's history, only Young and Wilson were constant members, with other musicians amongst the band's ranks over the years including: Dave Irving (drums), Lenni \"Sax\" Zakson (saxophone), Des Tong (bass), Michael Byron-Hehir (lead guitar), Steve Piggot (keys), Jeff Seopardi (drums), Paul Burgess (drums), Phil Lanzon (keyboards) and Alistair Gordon (keyboards). Harvey Lisberg, who also managed 10cc, arranged for Eric Stewart to produce their third album, Facades, which included the top 3 single, \"Every Day Hurts\". Reviewing the band's 1978 Misplaced Ideals LP, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): \"In which the decade's most paradoxical, characteristic, and disgusting pop-music synthesis\u2014combining hard rock's compulsive riff energy with MOR's smooth determination to displease no one\u2014is achieved without recourse to jazz rhythms or semiclassical decoration. Misplaced ideals my ass\u2014they threw them down the deepest hole they could find.\" The band initially dissolved in 1990, but briefly reformed in 1998, and again in 2000. The 2000 concert was a tribute to the band's former vocalist Paul Young, who had died, aged 53, on 15 July 2000. In 2012, the band was reformed by Wilson, who due to Young's death is now the band's only continuous member, along with other former members Mulford, Irving, and Tong, and new members Sue Quin (vocals, keyboards), Simon Waggott (keyboards) and Steve Whalley (guitars, vocals). The band conducted a UK tour in November 2012, the band's first full live tour in 25 years. The new lineup formed in 2018 includes Wilson, Tong and Irving plus Sue Quin and new members Dave Day (lead guitar, vocals), Barry James Thomas (vocals, percussion), Neil Shaw-Hulme (saxophone, wx7, vocals) and Pete Hughes (keyboards, vocals). They played their first gig in November 2018 to a sell- out audience at the Cinnamon Club in Bowdon and repeated the feat with two more sell-out shows in March 2019 where Matt Steele replaced Pete Hughes on keyboards. ==Personnel== ===Members=== ;Current * Ian Wilson \u2013 guitars, vocals (1976\u20131990, 1998, 2000, 2012\u2013present) * Dave Irving \u2013 drums, vocals (1978\u20131984, 2000, 2012\u2013present) * Des Tong \u2013 bass, vocals (1980\u20131990, 1998, 2000, 2012\u2013present) * Sue Quin \u2013 vocals (2012\u2013present) * Dave Day - lead guitars, vocals (2018-present) * Barry James Thomas - vocals, percussion (2018-present) * Neil Shaw-Hulme - saxophones, wx7, vocals (2018-present) * Matt Steele - keyboards (2019-present) ;Former * Paul Young \u2013 lead vocals (1976\u20131990, 1998; died 2000) * Vic Emerson \u2013 keyboards (1976\u20131984, 2000; died 13 October 2018) * John Stimpson \u2013 bass (1976\u20131980) * Tony Cresswell \u2013 drums (1976\u20131978) * Lenni \u2013 saxophone (1979\u20131984, 1998, 2000) * Michael Byron-Hehir \u2013 lead guitars (1981\u20131984, 1989\u20131990, 1998; guest musician: 1986) * Jeff Seopardi \u2013 drums (1984\u20131986) * Phil Lanzon \u2013 keyboards (1986) * Alistair Gordon \u2013 keyboards, vocals (1989\u20131990, 1998) * Simon Waggott \u2013 keyboards (2012\u20132014) * Steve Whalley \u2013 guitars, vocals (2012\u20132014) * Ashley Mulford \u2013 lead guitars, vocals (1976\u20131981, 1986\u20131989, 2000, 2012\u20132014) * Pete Hughes - keyboards, vocals (2018) ;Guest musicians * Roy Martin \u2013 drums (1998) * Paul Burgess \u2013 drums (1986\u20131990) * Steve Pigott \u2013 keyboards (1984\u20131986) ===Lineups=== {| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:width:375px; margin:0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #e2e2e2; width:99%;\" |- !
