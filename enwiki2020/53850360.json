In North Carolina he and his wife Nancy Sanders, the daughter of a Duke English professor, owned a showplace home and garden. Goodwin came to Duke as the student of Joseph Spengler. He completed his studies in 1958, and became the first faculty member appointed in economics at the new York University in Toronto. He returned to Duke in 1962 as an assistant professor. In 2009, along with three other speakers, Roy Weintraub, Kevin Hoover, and Bruce Caldwell, Craufurd Goodwin presented four talks on Keynes in relation to the Bloomsbury Group, for which Goodwin gave the first talk on the subject of \"Maynard Keynes of Bloomsbury\". The talks were delivered as part of the inaugural event for the Center for the History of Political Economy at Duke University. The series on Keynes was also held in conjunction with Vision and Design: A Year of Bloomsbury, an interdisciplinary program surrounding an exhibition of art by the Bloomsbury group at Duke University's Nasher Museum of Art. For a time, Goodwin was a program officer in charge of European and international affairs for the Ford Foundation. On the 40th anniversary of HOPE, Kevin D.
