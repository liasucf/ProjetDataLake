He is most famous as a public speaker who advocated sovereignty for Quebec from Canada. == Biography == Bourgault was born in East Angus in the Estrie (Eastern Townships) region of Quebec. His father was a civil servant and his mother, a homemaker. His parents sent him to boarding school at age seven, determined that he should receive the education which they lacked. After secondary school, he briefly attended the seminary and entertained the idea of a possible entry into the priesthood, per ancestral tradition, but reneged on his obligation shortly thereafter. He is today entombed within the traditionally Catholic Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal. Beginning in the early 1960s, he supported Quebec independence from Canada and in 1960 joined the pro-independence Rassemblement pour l'ind\u00e9pendance nationale. A famed and inflammatory orator, he led a number of union strikes and marches that resulted in violence. In 1964, he became leader of the RIN, and came up just short in the Duplessis riding of Northern Quebec. During the St. Jean Baptiste celebration in 1968, he and other supporters rioted and threw objects in the direction of newly minted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He and 300 others were arrested for this incident, while Trudeau's stoic response significantly helped. In 1968, popular cabinet minister and television host Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque founded Mouvement Souverainet\u00e9-Association, a more moderate sovereignist party. L\u00e9vesque rebuffed in an attempt to have the RIN included en masse, fearing the RIN's reputation for protests and violence would hurt the movement. Bourgeault disbanded the party and invited its members to join the MSA one by one and the new Ralliement national in the newly founded Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, under L\u00e9vesque's leadership. In the 1970 Quebec election, he was the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois candidate in Mercier electoral district, running unsuccessfully against Liberal leader (and soon-to-be Premier) Robert Bourassa, who would become a close personal friend. Bourgault himself did not play any role in the PQ government that came to power in the 1976 Quebec election and was given a patronage appointment. He often quarreled with L\u00e9vesque, especially in the lead up to the 1980 referendum, in which he was a passionate participant, before leaving the PQ in the 1980s. In his early life, he was a journalist at Montreal newspaper La Presse, and he returned to this publication in the 1990s as a columnist for Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al newspaper. After 1976, he was a professor of communications at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQAM). He was also the co-host or regular columnist of several radio shows aired on la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada, the French language sector of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1992, he had an acting role in the film L\u00e9olo, cast by director Jean-Claude Lauzon. to whom Bourgault was a mentor.Maurie Alioff, \"L\u00e9olo,\" Take One, No. 1, 1992, p. 16. Lauzon denied he was cast for political reasons.Jim Leach, \"It takes monsters to do things like that: The films of Jean-Claude Lauzon,\" Great Canadian Film Directors, The University of Alberta Press, 2007, p. 51. He was openly gay, though he said in an interview for Radio-Canada a few years before his death that in his later years he chose to stop having sexual relations. Bourgault was a fluent and eloquent speaker of English. For a brief period in the 1980s, he was a weekly columnist for Montreal's anglophone daily, The Gazette. ==Candidacy== == Works == * Qu\u00e9bec quitte ou double, 1970 * Oui \u00e0 l'ind\u00e9pendance du Qu\u00e9bec, 1977 * Le plaisir de la libert\u00e9, 1983 * \u00c9crits pol\u00e9miques 1960-1981, 1989 * Moi, je m'en souviens, 1989 * Maintenant ou jamais, entretiens, 1990 * La politique. \u00c9crits pol\u00e9miques, 1996 ==Awards== *1983 - Prix Air Canada *1997 - Prix Georges- \u00c9mile-Lapalme *2000 - Prix Jules-Fournier *2001 - Prix Condorcet ==References== ==External links== *Obituary (from Le Devoir, in French) Category:French Quebecers Category:Canadian people of Breton descent Category:1934 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Canadian columnists Category:Canadian radio personalities Category:Gay politicians Category:Gay writers Category:Journalists from Quebec Category:LGBT politicians from Canada Category:LGBT writers from Canada Category:Quebec political party leaders Category:Canadian non-fiction writers in French Category:Quebec sovereigntists Category:Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al faculty Category:20th-century Canadian non-fiction writers Category:20th-century Canadian male writers Category:Canadian male non-fiction writers Category:Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery burials ",
