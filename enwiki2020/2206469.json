    "text": "The lentiform nucleus, or lenticular nucleus, comprises the putamen and the globus pallidus within the basal ganglia. With the caudate nucleus, it forms the striatum. It is a large, lens-shaped mass of gray matter just lateral to the internal capsule. Increased volume of the lentiform nuclei has been observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder, with decreased volume conversely observed in other anxiety disorders. ==Structure== When divided horizontally, it exhibits, to some extent, the appearance of a biconvex lens, while a coronal section of its central part presents a somewhat triangular outline. It is shorter than the caudate nucleus and does not extend as far forward. ===Boundaries=== It is lateral to the caudate nucleus and thalamus, and is seen only in sections of the hemisphere. It is bounded laterally by a lamina of white substance called the external capsule, and lateral to this is a thin layer of gray substance termed the claustrum. Its anterior end is continuous with the lower part of the head of the caudate nucleus and with the anterior perforated substance. ===Components=== In a coronal section through the middle of the lentiform nucleus, two medullary laminae are seen dividing it into three parts. The lateral and largest part is of a reddish color, and is known as the putamen, while the medial and intermediate are of a yellowish tint, and together constitute the globus pallidus; all three are marked by fine radiating white fibers, which are most distinct in the putamen. ==Etymology== The name comes from Latin and means lens-shaped, probably referring to the appearance of the nucleus from the side. ==Additional images== File:Gray678.png|Schematic representation of the chief ganglionic categories (I to V) File:Gray683.png|Dissection of brain-stem.
