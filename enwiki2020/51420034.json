    "text": "Ginger Rogers - 1940s The Ginger Rogers filmography lists the film appearances of American actress Ginger Rogers, as well as her television, stage, and radio credits. Rogers's career spanned fifty-seven years, from 1930 to 1987. Initially signing with Paramount Pictures in 1930, she quickly opted out of her contract and worked for several studios, most notably for Warner Brothers in musicals 42nd Street (1933) and Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933), during this time she was named one of WAMPAS Baby Stars. In 1932 Ginger co-starred with comedian Joe E. Brown in the movie, \"You Said A Mouthful\". In 1933, Rogers signed with RKO Radio Pictures, where she was paired with dancer Fred Astaire in commercially successful Flying Down to Rio (1933). The pair achieved greater success in subsequent musicals The Gay Divorcee (1934), Top Hat (1935), Swing Time (1936), and Shall We Dance (1937), totaling 8 films made between 1933 and 1939. Without Astaire, Rogers starred in critically and commercially successful non-musicals throughout the remainder of the 1930s such as Stage Door (1937) with Katharine Hepburn, Vivacious Lady (1938) with James Stewart, and Bachelor Mother (1939) with David Niven, culminating with an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Kitty Foyle (1940). Rogers flourished throughout the 1940s, becoming one of the most popular and highest paid actresses of the decade. She starred in comedies Tom, Dick and Harry (1941) and Roxie Hart (1942; this was an adaptation of the 1926 non- musical play Chicago, and later the inspiration for the hit 1975 musical and 2002 film adaptation), dramas Tender Comrade (1943) and I'll Be Seeing You (1944) and in director Billy Wilder's American film debut The Major and the Minor (1942). She was reunited with Fred Astaire for MGM's The Barkleys of Broadway (1949). In the 1950s, Rogers' film career had faltered, due to lesser demand for older actresses. She co-starred with popular Cary Grant in Monkey Business (1952) but her career continued to wane throughout the decade. She ended her film career with one of two fictionalized biographies on actress Jean Harlow in 1965's Harlow. Beginning the following year, she found success by returning to musical theatre, including a stint as one of several replacements for Carol Channing in the long-running Hello, Dolly! on Broadway.
