It was a piston engined aircraft produced at the start of the jet age. ==Development== La-9 represents a further development of the Lavochkin La-126 prototype. The first prototype, designated La-130 was finished in 1946. Similarity to the famous Lavochkin La-7 was only superficial \u2013 the new fighter had an all-metal construction and a laminar flow wing. Weight savings due to elimination of wood from the airframe allowed for greatly improved fuel capacity and four-cannon armament. Mock combat demonstrated that the La-130 was evenly matched with the La-7 but was inferior to the Yakovlev Yak-3 in horizontal planes. The new fighter, officially designated La-9, entered production in August 1946. A total of 1,559 aircraft were built by the end of production in 1948. ==Variants== Like other aircraft designers at the time, Lavochkin was experimenting with using jet propulsion to augment performance of piston-engined fighters. One such attempt was La-130R with an RD-1Kh3 liquid fuel rocket engine in addition to the Shvetsov ASh-82FN piston powerplant. The project was cancelled in 1946 before the prototype could be assembled. A more unusual approach was La-9RD which was tested in 1947\u20131948. It was a production La-9 with a reinforced airframe and armament reduced to two cannons, which carried a single RD-13 pulsejet (the engine which powered the V-1 flying bomb, probably taken from surplus Luftwaffe stocks) under each wing. The 70 km/h (45 mph) increase in top speed came at the expense of tremendous noise and vibration. The engines were unreliable and worsened the handling. The project was abandoned although between 3 and 9 La-9RD were reported to perform at airshows, no doubt pleasing the crowds with the noise. Other notable La-9 variants were: * La-9UTI \u2013 two- seat trainer version. Built at GAZ-99 in Ulan-Ude. Two versions exist: with 12.7 mm UBS machine gun and with one 23 mm NS-23 cannon (all armament is mounted in the cowling above the engine, firing through the propeller). * La-132 (La-132) \u2013 prototype with upgraded Shvetsov M-93 engine. Projected top speed 740 km/h (460 mph) at 6,500 m (21,325 ft). Engine proved a failure and the single prototype was equipped with an experimental Shvetsov ASh-82M instead. The aircraft did not proceed to production. * La-9M (La-134) \u2013 long- range fighter prototype, see Lavochkin La-11 * La-9RD \u2013 one La-9 was fitted with two auxiliary RD-13 pulsejet engines underwing. * La-138 \u2013 one La-9 was fitted with two underwing PVRD-450 auxiliary ramjet engines. ==Operators== ;People's Republic of China * People's Liberation Army Air Force Imported 129 La-9 airplanes in 1950. The last 5 La-9 fighters retired in 1959. ;East Germany * Volkspolizei (5 operated from 1952 to 1956 prior to the formation of the Air Forces of the National People's Army) ;North Korea * North Korea Air Force ;Romania * Romanian Air Force (10 delivered in 1950: 5 La-9 and 5 La-9 UTI) ;Soviet Union * Soviet Air Force * Soviet Air Defence Forces ==Surviving aircraft== ===China=== *La-9 6201 is on display at Beijing Aeronautical Institute, Beijing, China as 7504 *La-9 (unidentified S/N) on display at People's Liberation Army Air Force Museum, Datangshan, Chiangping, China as 06 *La-9UTI (unidentified S/N) on display at People's Liberation Army Air Force Museum, Datangshan, Chiangping, China ===North Korea=== *La-9 102 is on display at Glorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum, Pyongyang, North Korea ===Romania=== *La-9 66 on display at Central Military Museum, Bucharest, Romania ===United States of America=== *La-9 28 owned by Jerry Yagen's Military Aviation Museum and restored by Pioneer Aero Restorations in New Zealand between 2001 and 2003, airworthy as N415ML ==Specifications (La-9)== 300px ==See also== ==References== ===Further reading=== * Gordon, Yefim.
