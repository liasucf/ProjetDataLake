    "text": "Edward McKey Hallowell is an American psychiatrist who specialises in ADD and ADHD. He is the co-author of the books Driven to Distraction (1994) and Delivered From Distraction (2005). ==Background== Hallowell grew up in Charleston, South Carolina. His father suffered from bipolar disorder and had ECT.ADHD Nation - Schwarz (2016). Hallowell's mother remarried to an abusive alcoholic. ==Education== Hallowell is an alumnus of Harvard and Phillips Exeter Academy and received his medical degree from Tulane University Medical School.ADHD Nation - Alan Schwarz - 2016 He got a degree in English from the same University. ==ADHD== In 1981, Hallowell attended a lecture about children with ADHD and stated that it was there when he learned that he has the syndrome. Despite this, he has never been officially diagnosed. For the next ten years Hallowell diagnosed people with it using the Conner's Scale. In an interview in 2012, Hallowell stated that ADHD appears in 15% of the population. In a May 2015 interview, Hallowell said that the USA is full of ADHD genes coming from the colonizers and this could explain its 'thriving structure' in the way it behaves as well as being an explanation for being a violent nation. He calls this the \"American Edge.\" \"The people who colonized this country were loaded with the ADHD genes, hence our current gene pool is well stocked with ADHD. It has driven our greatest successes \u2013 but is also why we are such a violent nation. Hallowell states that ADHD does not always include Hyperactivity but can include having an inability to follow through on assignments at work or at school, misplacing things, avoiding tasks, or getting distracted easily. Hallowell has claimed that Einstein, Mozart, Thomas Edison and Abraham Lincoln all had ADHD. ==Drug companies== Hallowell has been a paid consultant to and spokesperson for McNeil Pediatrics, a company that makes Concerta and other stimulants which Hallowell has praised along with Novartis.https://projects.propublica.org/d4d-archive/payments/10997328 ==Views on stimulant drugs== Hallowell has stated that Concerta, Adderall, Ritalin, and other ADHD drugs are \"incredibly and unbelievably safe\", \"safer than aspirin\", and are like \"eye glasses\". In 2012 Hallowell said \"The fact is, stimulant medication is safer than aspirin. It has fewer side effects and works better than caffeine, and everybody goes to Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts. So, not to try it, unless it\u2019s against your religion, makes no sense. People say, \u2018Well, shouldn\u2019t I try a year of non-medical approaches first?\u2019 That's like saying shouldn't I try a year of squinting before I try eyeglasses. It just makes no sense. These meds are so well researched. They've been around since 1937. That's 70 years of experience. Nothing lasts that long unless it's safe and it works. Most entrepreneurs have ADHD. I think it should be renamed the entrepreneur's trait\".http://www.celebritybrandingagency.com/pdf/drhallowell.pdf But he does not take them for his own ADHD. On September 15, 2005 Hallowell said \"Whenever you get someone with ADHD diagnosed and treated successfully, everyone wins. Along with behavioral therapy, medication is good because it can improve adults' relationships, parenting skills, job performance, even their sex lives\".Pittsburgh Morning Star - September 15, 2005 In June 2011 Hallowell claimed to have tested an eight-year-old boy with \"An IQ of 69, close to mentally handicapped, and I put him on Ritalin and his IQ went up to 140. It was a dramatic story that I\u2019ve never forgotten \u2014 to see how diagnosis could be a life-altering change in ability and stability\". In February 2013 Hallowell on the Dr Oz show said he was \"Speaking Hyperbolically\" and \"Took back\" his long held claims about Adderall being safer than Aspirin. This was after he heard about the story of Richard Fee who got addicted to Adderall after wrongly being diagnosed with ADHD, went Psychotic and hanged himself. In June 2020 Hallowell claimed that ADHD was under diagnosed in the elderly and that the oldest person he treated was 86 years old. Once again he praised the safeness of stimulant medication.https://ihyper.net/adhd-in-the-elderly-dr- hallowell/ ==Sexual misconduct charge== In May 2015, Hallowell was charged with sexually groping a make up artist on 20 October 2014. Hallowell admitted having carried out this crime. The report said Hallowell confessed to putting his hand on the woman\u2019s shoulder, moving his hand down along the side of her body, then grabbing and squeezing her buttocks. The report also said a Harvard Business Publishing employee witnessed the incident.http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/article/20150521/NEWS/150528592http://www.patriotledger.com/article/20150908/news/150906905 Hallowell was given pre-trial probation for a year in September 2015 and the matter was dropped. ==Personal life== Hallowell lives in the Boston area with his wife, Sue, a social worker, and their three children. ==Books== Hallowell has written several books.
