Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 532 It is notable for being the only extant Old-Norse Icelandic legendary which exclusively deals with female saintsWolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 532 and for being the only extant text which contains Old Norse-Icelandic prose and poetic accounts of St Dorothy.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 534 The book takes its name from the convent of Kirkjub\u00e6r, which likely held the codex until King Christian III of Denmark dissolved the Icelandic monasteries in the mid sixteenth century.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 534 == Contents == The codex contains material in Old-Norse Icelandic and Latin relating to eight saints' legends: St Margaret of Antioch, St Catherine of Alexandria, St Cecilia, St Dorothea of Caesara, St Agnes, St Agatha, St Barbara, and Sts Fides, Spes and Caritas.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 533 Apart from the prose and poetry relating to St Dorothy, the legends all exist in other manuscripts written before 1500, though it is the only text which preserves the legend of St Cecilia in its entirety.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 535 Wolf suggests that it is likely that the material in the codex was copied from individual lives of saints that were available in Iceland, rather than from another legendary, as the arrangement of the legends appears arbitrary, and is not organised according to the liturgical year.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 534 A gathering of 10 leaves appears to be missing between folios 18v and 19r of the legend of St Catherine and around four leaves from the end of the legend of Fides, Spes and Caritas are also lost. Apart from this, the texts in the codex are complete.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 533 The contents of the codex is given below; unless indicated otherwise, the texts are written in Old Norse-Icelandic: * St Margaret ** Margr\u00e9tar saga ** Prayer to St. Margaret (Latin) * St Catherine ** Katr\u00ednar saga * St Cecilia ** Cecil\u00edu saga ** Cecil\u00edu diktur * Saint Dorothy **D\u00f3r\u00f3theu saga ** Dorotheudiktur - Dorotheu kv\u00e6\u00f0i ** A Verse of St. Dorothy (Latin) * St Agnes ** Agnesar saga * St Agatha ** Ag\u00f6thu saga * St Barbara ** Barbare saga * Sts Fides, Spes and Caritas ** Saga af Fides, Spes og Karitas == Provenance == The codex was collected by \u00c1rni Magn\u00fasson from 'P\u00e1ll \u00e1 Fl\u00f3kasto\u00f0um', who was likely P\u00e1ll \u00c1mundason, the administrator of the Kirkjub\u00e6r's land from 1681-1708.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 534 There is no direct record of the codex belonging to the convent; an inventory of 1397 notes that it held 20 Latin and Norse books.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 534 However, based on its specialised contents referring to female saints, some of whom were known to be venerated by the nuns at Kirkjub\u00e6r, Wolf considers there to be 'little doubt' that it was written for convent.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 537 She suggests that rather than by being written by the nuns themselves, it may have been produced at the monastery of \u00deykkvab\u00e6r.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 537 == Description == The codex is formed of 84 leaves of calfskin divided into 11 gatherings, measuring 11.5cm x 8.8cm.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 532 The codex has been rebound with cardboard plates, but was probably originally bound with a leather cover.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 532 Accounting for the missing leaves mentioned above, Wolf suggests that the codex would have originally consisted of 94 or 98 leaves.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 533 The codex was written by at least four scribes and is illustrated using red and blue. There are full-page illustrations of Sts Margaret, Catherine, Cecilia, Dorothy and Agnes, who are distinguished by their attributes.Wolf, Kirsten (2005) \"Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k: Codex AM 429 12mo\", in Rudolf Simek and Juith Meurer (eds.) Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of the 12th International Saga Conference, Bonn/Germany, 28th July\u20142nd August 2003, Bonn, p. 533-534 Some of the illustrations may have used those in Teiknib\u00f3k as models. == References == == Further reading == * Category:Icelandic manuscripts Category:Sagas of saints ",
