    "text": "The moon-viewing turret at Takamatsu Castle The was a han or feudal domain in Sanuki Province (present-day Kagawa Prefecture), Japan during the Edo period. The domain was governed first by the Ikoma clan then by the Mito-Matsudaira clan. ==History== Matsudaira Yoritoshi, the last daimyo of Takamatsu The Takamatsu domain was founded in 1587, after Toyotomi Hideyoshi's forces subdued Shikoku. The entire province of Sanuki, rated at 173,000 koku, was granted to Hideyoshi's general Ikoma Chikamasa. Because they sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara, the Ikoma retained their fief, and ruled it until 1640, when they were moved to the Yashima Domain because of an uprising. For a time, the territory of the domain was divided between rulers of the neighboring fiefs, but in 1642, the Takamatsu domain was re- formed, this time under the rulership of Matsudaira Yorishige, a son of Tokugawa Yorifusa, the son of Tokugawa Ieyasu who was the first Tokugawa lord of Mito. The Matsudaira of Takamatsu held some degree of influence in the Tokugawa shogunate, and assisted in communications with the imperial court. In 1868, the forces of Takamatsu fought on the shogunate's side at the Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi, but were defeated; soon after, Takamatsu itself surrendered to the forces of the nearby Tosa and Marugame domains. Two of the domain's kar\u014d, Oga Mataemon and Obu Hy\u014dgo, were executed; the daimyo, Matsudaira Yorishige, was sentenced to solitary confinement for some time, but subsequently released. Like all the other domains of Japan, Takamatsu was disbanded in 1871. The territory was first known as , but later became part of , where its territory remains to the present day. == List of daimy\u014ds == * Ikoma clan 1587\u20131640 (tozama; 173,000 koku) {| class=wikitable ! || Name || Tenure |- |1|||| 1587\u20131600 |- |2|||| 1600\u20131610 |- |3|||| 1610\u20131621 |- |4|||| 1621\u20131640 |} * 30px Matsudaira clan 1642\u20131871 (Shinpan; 120,000 koku) {| class=wikitable ! || Name || Tenure |- |1|||| 1642\u20131673 |- |2|||| 1673\u20131704 |- |3|||| 1704\u20131735 |- |4|||| 1735\u20131739 |- |5|||| 1739\u20131771 |- |6|||| 1771\u20131780 |- |7|||| 1780\u20131792 |- |8|||| 1792\u20131821 |- |9|||| 1821\u20131842 |- |10|||| 1842\u20131861 |- |11|||| 1861\u20131871 |} ===Simplified family tree (Mito-Tokugawa)=== *20px Tokugawa Ieyasu, 1st Tokugawa sh\u014dgun (1543\u20131616; r. 1603\u20131605) ** Tokugawa Yorifusa, 1st daimy\u014d of Mito (1603\u20131661) ***15px I.
