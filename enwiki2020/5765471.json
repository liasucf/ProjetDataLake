The establishment of sealer settlements by Europeans in Eastern Bass Strait, including Kent Group, were amongst the earliest outside Sydney Cove. A lighthouse was constructed on Deal Island in 1848, with permanent human habitation until its deactivation in 1992. However parts of the islands were subject to grazing cattle until as recent as 1996, with Dover Island least impacted by human activities. ==Marine Reserve== Kent Group has a high diversity of fish species, likely due to the convergence of influences including the East Australian Current and westerly flow of Bass Strait. The marine reserve area generally east of Deal Island prohibits fishing. ==See also== *Protected areas of Tasmania ==References== ==External links== *Kent Group National Park website Category:National parks of Tasmania Category:Protected areas established in 1971 Category:North East Tasmania Category:1971 establishments in Australia ",
