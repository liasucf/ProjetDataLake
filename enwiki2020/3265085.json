It was one of two mountain infantry divisions of Poland to fight against the Invasion of Poland of 1939. Currently its traditions are continued by the 21st Podhale Rifle Brigade. Until 1939 the unit was commanded by Col. Leopold Engel-Ragis and was stationed in and around the towns of Sanok, Przemy\u015bl and Sambor. Along with 11th Infantry and 21st Mountain Infantry Divisions, the 22nd was notable for its distinctive uniforms, based on folk attire of the G\u00f3rale (Polish highlanders) rather than standard uniforms of the Polish Army. During the Invasion of Poland, the division was attached to the Prusy Army. Overrun by the Germans, the Regiments fought separately in the ranks of other units. ==OOB== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
