    "text": "The Sportske novosti Yellow Shirt award or SN Yellow Shirt for short () is an annual football award given by the Croatian sports daily Sportske novosti. It is awarded to the best football player playing in the Croatian First League at the end of every season, based on post-match ratings awarded by sports journalists over the course of a season. Established in 1953, the award was originally sponsored by the defunct Zagreb-based sports newspaper Narodni sport and its sports weekly Sportska panorama, and was awarded to the Player of the Season in the Yugoslav First League. In February 1962 Narodni sport was acquired by the Vjesnik publishing company and renamed Sportske novosti (SN). Since 1991 and the breakup of Yugoslavia the paper gives the award to the best players in the Prva HNL, Croatian top flight. As of 2010 only three players have won the award on more than occasion, with each of them winning two consecutive awards: *Igor Cvitanovi\u0107 (1996, 1997) *Ivica Oli\u0107 (2002, 2003) *Eduardo (2006, 2007) ==Winners== ===Yugoslav league=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! width=\"70px\" |Season !width=\"160\"|Player (Wins) !width=\"160\"|Club |- | 1952\u201353 | (1) | Hajduk Split |- | 1953\u201354 | (1) | Partizan |- | 1954\u201355 | (1) | Hajduk Split |- | 1955\u201356 | (1) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 1956\u201357 | (1) | Vojvodina |- | 1957\u201358 | (1) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 1958\u201359 | (1) | Red Star |- | 1959\u201360 | (1) | Red Star |- | 1960\u201361 | (1) | Partizan |- | 1961\u201362 | (1) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 1962\u201363 | (1) | Partizan |- | 1963\u201364 | (1) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 1964\u201365 | (2) | Partizan |- | 1965\u201366 | (1) | Vojvodina |- | 1966\u201367 | (1) | \u017deljezni\u010dar |- | 1967\u201368 | (1) | Hajduk Split |- | 1963\u201364 | (2) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 1969\u201370 | (1) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 1970\u201371 | (1) | Hajduk Split |- | 1971\u201372 | (1) | OFK Belgrade |- | 1972\u201373 | (1) | Vele\u017e |- | 1973\u201374 | (1) | Hajduk Split |- | 1974\u201375 | (1) | Vele\u017e |- | 1975\u201376 | (2) | Hajduk Split |- | 1976\u201377 | (1) | Borac Banja Luka |- | 1977\u201378 | (1) | Partizan |- | 1978\u201379 | (1) | Sarajevo |- | 1979\u201380 | (1) | Red Star |- | 1980\u201381 | (1) | Hajduk Split |- | 1981\u201382 | (1) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 1983\u201383 | (1) | Partizan |- | 1983\u201384 | (1) | Hajduk Split |- | 1984\u201385 | (1) | Sarajevo |- | 1985\u201386 | (1) | Rijeka |- | 1986\u201387 | (1) | Vele\u017e |- | 1987\u201388 | (1) | Red Star |- | 1988\u201389 | (1) | Vojvodina |- | 1989\u201390 | (1) | Hajduk Split |- | 1990\u201391 | (1) | Dinamo Zagreb |- |} ===Croatian league=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! width=\"70px\" |Season !width=\"190\"|Player (Wins) !width=\"160\"|Club |- | 1992 | (1) | Hajduk Split |- | 1992\u201393 | (1) | Croatia Zagreb |- | 1993\u201394 | (1) | Rijeka |- | 1994\u201395 | (1) | Osijek |- | 1995\u201396 | (1) | Croatia Zagreb |- | 1996\u201397 | (2) | Croatia Zagreb |- | 1997\u201398 | (1) | Hrvatski Dragovoljac |- | 1998\u201399 | (1) | Varteks |- | 1999\u20132000 | (1) | Cibalia |- | 2000\u201301 | (1) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 2001\u201302 | (1) | NK Zagreb |- | 2002\u201303 | (2) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 2003\u201304 | (1) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 2004\u201305 | (1) | NK Zagreb |- | 2005\u201306 | Eduardo (1) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 2006\u201307 | Eduardo (2) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 2007\u201308 | (1) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 2008\u201309 | (1) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 2009\u201310 | (1) | Hajduk Split |- | 2010\u201311 | (1) | NK Zagreb |- | 2011\u201312 | (1) | Hajduk Split |- | 2012\u201313 | (1) | Rijeka |- | 2013\u201314 | (1) | Dinamo Zagreb |- | 2014\u201315 | (1) | NK Zagreb |- | 2015\u201316 | (1) | Hajduk Split |- | 2016\u201317 | (1) | Rijeka |- | 2017\u201318 | (1) | Rijeka |- | 2018\u201319 | (1) | Hajduk Split |- | 2019\u201320 | (1) | Rijeka |} Source: Nogometni-magazin.com Notes on club name changes: *Dinamo Zagreb changed their name to \"HA\u0160K Gra\u0111anski\" in June 1991 and then again in February 1993 to \"Croatia Zagreb\".
