    "text": "The Golden Sheaf Award for best Emerging Filmmaker production is presented by the Yorkton Film Festival. ==History== In 1947 the Yorkton Film Council was founded. In 1950 the first Yorkton Film Festival was held in Yorkton, Saskatchewan, Canada. During the first few festivals, the films were adjudicated by audience participation through ballot casting and winners were awarded Certificates of Merit by the film festival council. In 1958 the film council established the Yorkton Film Festival Golden Sheaf Award for the category Best of Festival, awarded to the best overall film of the festival. Over the years various additional categories were added to the competition. In 2006 the Golden Sheaf Award for best Emerging Filmmaker production was added to the Accompanying Categories of the film festival competition. The winner of this award is determined by a panel of jurors, selected by the film council. The Emerging Filmmaker Award is given to the director for recognition of the filmmaker's first professional production. This award is open to any genre. Emerging Filmmaker can be awarded \"to a filmmaker (specifically a director) in recognition of his/her first professional production in any genre.\" As of 2020, the Golden Sheaf Award categories included: Main Entry Categories, Accompanying Categories, Craft Categories, and Special Awards. ==Winners== === 2000s === {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" cellpadding=\"5\" ! width=\"50\" |Year ! width=\"250\" |Film ! width=\"200\" |Directors ! width=\"250\" |Producers | Production Companies ! width=\"10\" |References |- |2006 | Alice & Bastard, 2005 | Ana Valine | Ana Valine, Rodeo Queen Pictures | |- |2007 | Sur la ligne, 2006 | Frederic Desager | Christine Falco, Distributions Netima Ltd | |- |2008 | Sur la terre comme au ciel, 2007 | Herv\u00e9 Demers | Herv\u00e9 Demers, Les Films Herve Demers | |- |2009 | Jackpot, 2009 | Alan Black | Michelle Latimer, Streel Films | |- |} === 2010s === {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" cellpadding=\"5\" ! width=\"50\" |Year ! width=\"250\" |Film ! width=\"200\" |Directors ! width=\"250\" |Producers | Production Companies ! width=\"10\" |References |- |2010 | The Man Who Slept, 2009 | In\u00e9s Sedan | Ron Dyens, Aur\u00e9lia Pr\u00e9vieu, Marcel Jean, Galile Marion-Gauvin, Marc Bertrand,Sacrebleu Productions, , National Film Board of Canada | |- |2011 | Mokhtar, 2010 | Halima Ouardiri | Halima Ouardiri, Mila Aung-Thwin, EyeSteelFilm | |- |2012 | Blind Spot: What Happened to Canada's Aboriginal Fathers?, 2012 | Geoff Leo | Geoff Leo, Paul Dederick, CBC Saskatchewan | |- |2013 | Beauty Mark, 2013 | Mark Ratzlaff | Nimisha Mukerji, Daniel Domachowski, Miles Mook Productions | |- |2014 |Jingle Bell Rocks!, 2013 | Mitchell Kezin | Mitchell Kezin, Mila Aung-Thwin, Bob Moore, mabooshi film company & EyeSteelFilm | |- |2015 | The Match, 2014 | Kurt Spenrath | Frederick Kroetsch, Open Sky Pictures | |- |2016 | Sex Spirit Strength, 2015 | Courtney Montour | Tracey Deer, Mohawk Princess Pictures | |- |2017 | Show and Tell, 2016 | Reem Morsi | Sally Karam, Sixth Avenue Productions, BravoFACT | |- |2018 |Game, 2017 | Joy Webster | Lucas Ford, Ford Films | |- |2019 |Res-urgency, 2018'' | Desiree Wallace | Desiree Wallace | |- |} == References == Category:Awards established in 2006 Category:Yorkton Film Festival awards ",
