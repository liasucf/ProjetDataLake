    "text": "You're the Greatest, Charlie Brown is the 18th prime-time animated TV special based upon the comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. It was originally aired on the CBS network on March 19, 1979, making it the last Peanuts TV special of the 1970s. It has been released to DVD by Warner Home Video as a bonus feature to You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown. It appeared in remastered form in the Peanuts 1970s Collection Vol. 2. ==Synopsis== Charlie Brown decides to enter the Junior Olympics at his school after it is revealed he and his family are not going on vacation after all (even though he thought he would). The decathlon is the only thing left open, and Charlie Brown accepts the challenge (of course after everyone else there refused to take on such a tough event before Charlie Brown showed up). Peppermint Patty, who is the school's coordinator for the Junior Olympics, oversees Charlie Brown's rigorous training for the event. Marcie also watches (and gives encouragement), and Snoopy works out with him (showing how in-shape he is and how out of shape Charlie Brown is in the process). During a review of the ten events, Patty worries about whether or not he could win and decides to enter Marcie to back him up. On day one, Charlie Brown is introduced to his competitors: Marcie, Freddie Fabulous from Fremont (defending Decathlon champ and smug egotist who calls Charlie Brown \"Pumpkin head\"), and Snoopy's alter ego from Ace Obedience School, The Masked Marvel (making his first appearance since You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown four years earlier). He places well in the first five events, enough to place him in third after the day is over. Lucy states she is annoyed that Charlie Brown cannot be a total blockhead by his third-place ranking, as the Masked Marvel came in dead last (even after winning the final event of the first day, the 400m dash). Day two starts off bad for Charlie Brown. First, he feels nervous due to the increased pressure, then he performs badly in the 110m high hurdles (knocking down all but one hurdle and finishing last by a mile). However, after a tough talk from Peppermint Patty, a great showing in the pole vault and first-place finishes in the discus and javelin throw catapult him into first place. Now it's all on the 1500m run to finish it all off and be the school's hero. When Charlie Brown gains the lead over Freddie Fabulous, Lucy is aghast that the world must be ending as Charlie Brown is coming in first. Unfortunately, after taking the lead, Charlie Brown closes his eyes and daydreams of his victory and winds up running off the track, off the school grounds...and out of contention. Peppermint Patty sees this and cries (since Charlie Brown was daydreaming), \"Good grief! He ran off the track! He lost the race!\" It is learned afterward that their school still won the Junior Olympics, due to Marcie winning the 1500m (and thus the decathlon) and the disqualifications of Freddie Fabulous and The Masked Marvel (for fighting on the track). Peppermint Patty consoles Charlie Brown, telling him that everybody knows he did his best. Marcie arrives and Charlie Brown congratulates her on the win. Marcie, in turn, replies, \"You're a great competitor and a real gentleman. I think you're the greatest, Charles.\" Uncharacteristically, she then lifts her glasses and winks at Charlie Brown, who blushes. ==Voice cast== * Arrin Skelley as Charlie Brown/Vocal Effect/5 ** Mel Blanc as Charlie Brown (grunting) * Michelle Muller as Lucy van Pelt * Bill Melendez as Snoopy, Woodstock * Patricia Patts as Peppermint Patty * Casey Carlson as Marcie * Daniel Anderson as Linus van Pelt, Schroeder * Tim Hall as Freddy Fabulous, Pig-Pen * Scott Beach as Announcer Sally Brown appears, but has no speaking roles. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Animated television specials Category:CBS television specials Category:Peanuts television specials Category:Television programs directed by Phil Roman Category:1970s American television specials Category:1979 television specials Category:1979 in American television Category:Sports animation ",
