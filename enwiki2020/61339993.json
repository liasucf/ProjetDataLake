    "text": "\"SZNS\" (pronounced \"seasons\") is a song by American singer Dinah Jane featuring American rapper A Boogie wit da Hoodie. The song was released on July 25, 2019. ==Background== \"SZNS\" follows the release of Dinah's eponymous three-track bundle in April, which showcased her creative growth with the confident \"Heard It All Before\", moody \"Pass Me By\", and confessional \"Fix It\". The song has 90's R&B; vibes with verses such as \"Summer through the winter, we been through it / Might fall, but spring back to it,\" that show an optimist love of a romantic relationship. \"Hey Ma\" is introduced in the first verse as an interpolation to Nelly and Kelly Rowland's \"Dilemma\" and Tupac's \"Thugz Mansion\". The song paid homage to Mariah Carey's song \"Always Be My Baby.\" ==References== Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Dinah Jane songs Category:A Boogie wit da Hoodie songs ",
