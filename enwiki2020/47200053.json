The property was rented out from 1754 to 1779, while Falch lived in the village of Borgund. In 1759, Falch acquired the farm Djupvika in Borgund which he operated as a model farm. On August 25, 1756 he married again, to Christi(a)ne Margrethe Hagerup (1732\u20131795), and they had the following children: Anna Sophie Falch (1759\u20131830), Michael Melchiorsen Falch (1762\u2013?), Hans Christian Falch (1764\u2013?), Melchior Falch (1768\u20131849), and Cathrine Marie Helene Harboe Falch (1770\u20131854, who married Hans Knagenhjelm Daae).

In gratitude he was made the district magistrate for Sunnm\u00f8re in 1754, a position he would hold for the next twenty five years.Seminarium Fredericianum. Falch also earned much money for his work in developing the fishing industry. He was also active as a writer and in 1769 he became a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in Trondheim. On November 2, 1773 he co-founded one of Norway's first nonprofit organizations: the Sunnm\u00f8re Practical Agricultural Society (). Hans Str\u00f8m and other clergy also participated in the work. It was modeled on the Royal Danish Agricultural Society (established in 1769) and similar societies in other European countries. The society's mission was to promote economic development, especially in agriculture. Its main activity was educational, such as handing out pamphlets and useful premiums (2 to 4 riksdaler) to farmers that carried out recommended measures to improve production.Solli, Gunnar. 1931.

The society went into decline when Falch and Str\u00f8m left Sunnm\u00f8re in 1779. ==Works== * Beregning over hvad Tr\u00e6-Materialier S\u00f8ndm\u00f8r aarlig beh\u00f8ver (Calculation of Sunnm\u00f8re's Annual Thread Requirement; 1784) * Om Fyrre- og Gran-Skovene i Norge (Pine and Spruce Forests in Norway; 1784) * Om Torske Vaar-Fiskeriet paa Sundm\u00f8er (The Spring Cod Fishery in Sunnm\u00f8re; 1788) * Afhandling om Fiskerierne i Norge, i S\u00e6rdeleshed om de s\u00f8ndm\u00f8rske, og Fiske-Grundene uden for Landet (Thesis on the Fisheries in Norway, Especially That of Sunnm\u00f8re and Fishing-Grounds outside the Country; 1790) ==References== Category:1720 births Category:1791 deaths Category:People from Sogndal Category:University of Copenhagen alumni Category:Norwegian jurists Category:Norwegian judges Category:Norwegian writers ",
