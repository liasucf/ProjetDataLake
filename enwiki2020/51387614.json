    "text": "Julia Teresa Tallon (6 May 1867 \u2013 10 March 1954) \u2013 in religious Mary Teresa \u2013 was an American Catholic professed religious from the Holy Cross Sisters who founded the Parish Visitors of Mary Immaculate. Tallon was born to Irish immigrants in New York City and joined the religious life in Indiana despite the protests of her family. Tallon became titled as a Servant of God on 20 February 2013 under Pope Benedict XVI when the beatification cause was introduced in the Archdiocese of New York. ==Life== Julia Teresa Tallon was born at a farm in upstate New York 1867 as the seventh of the eight children to the Irish immigrants Peter Tallon (1827 \u2013 21 September 1872) and Bridget Duffy (1827 \u2013 8 August 1905). After the death of her first husband, Peter Tallon, she married John Bogan. Her siblings were: * William Tallon * Ellen Tallon (died aged six) * Elizabeth Tallon (died aged six) * Alice Cecilia Dunn (1855 \u2013 13 February 1939) \u2013 married Patrick Dunn (1845\u20131913) and had one child James B. Dunn (1876\u20131956) * Mary Bloomfield (1861 \u2013 October 1929) \u2013 married David A. Bloomfield (1866\u20131912) From 1879 she felt a strong call to enter the religious life as a sister despite the protests of her mother and siblings who did not approve of her decision. Her mother in particular \u2013 despite her deep faith \u2013 did not approve of her daughter's decision though was powerless to prevent this from materializing. Regardless of their opinion she joined the Holy Cross Sisters on 30 April 1887 and resided with the order at their convent until 1920 after the conclusion of World War I. Tallon founded the Parish Visitors of Mary Immaculate in New York on 15 August 1920 \u2013 an order that now operates in Nigeria and the Philippines. Tallon suffered from disabling illnesses in the final two decades of her life and she hid the fact that she was sick though a few of her colleagues knew of this. On 10 February 1954 she was critically ill after suffering a fall in her room and spent the next month in pain. She died on the evening of 10 March 1954 just as her fellow Sisters concluded the recitation of the rosary at her bedside. Her remains were exhumed for canonical inspection and transferred on 16 October 2015 and then relocated for the final time on 9 December 2015. ==Beatification cause== The beatification process opened in the Archdiocese of New York on 20 February 2013 under Pope Benedict XVI after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \"nihil obstat\" (nothing against) to the cause and titled her as a Servant of God; news of this was given to the archdiocese on 28 February 2013. The diocesan process opened on 16 April 2013 and concluded on 13 January 2015 in which Cardinal Timothy Dolan both inaugurated and concluded the process. The C.C.S. received all the boxes of documentation on 22 January 2015 and validated the process on 29 April 2016. The postulator assigned to the cause is Dr. Waldery Hilgeman and the vice-postulator is Sister Maria Catherine. ==References== ==External links== *Hagiography Circle *Saints SQPN *Parish Visitors of Mary Immaculate Category:1867 births Category:1954 deaths Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:19th- century Roman Catholics Category:19th-century American people Category:20th- century venerated Christians Category:20th-century Roman Catholics Category:20th-century American people Category:American Servants of God Category:American Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:People from Oneida County, New York Category:American people of Irish descent Category:20th-century Christian nuns Category:Catholics from New York (state) ",
