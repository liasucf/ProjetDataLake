    "text": "Incontinence (\"a want of continence or self-restraint\") is often used by philosophers to translate the Greek term Akrasia (\u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1). Used to refer to a lacking in moderation or self-control, especially related to sexual desire,dictionary.com \u2013 incontinence incontinence may also be called wantonness. ==Aristotle== Aristotle devoted book VII of the Nicomachean Ethics to the discussion of continence and incontinence, having previously linked the latter both to prodigality in its effects, and to those dominated by irrational feeling in its failure to obey knowledge of the good:J. A. K. Thompson trans, The Ethics of Aristotle (1976) pp. 142, 66, and 89 a case of knowing virtue, but not having habituated it to control passion. Aristotle considered one could be incontinent with respect to money or temper or glory, but that its core relation was to bodily enjoyment.Thompson, p. 235-9 Its causes could be weakness of will, or an impetuous refusal to think.Thompson, p. 244 At the same time, he did not consider it a vice, because it is not so much a product of moral choice, but instead, a failure to act on one's better knowledge.Thompson, p. 244-6 ==Later developments== For Augustine, incontinence was not so much a problem of knowledge (knowing but not acting) but of the will: he considered it a matter of everyday experience that men incontinently choose lesser over greater goods.Carl Mitcham, Thinking Through Technology (1994) p. 263-4 In the structural division of Dante's Inferno, incontinence is the sin punished in the second through fifth circles. The mutual incontinence of lust was for Dante the lightest of the deadly sins,Dante, p. 101-2 even if its lack of self-control would open the road to deeper layers of Hell. Akrasia appeared later as a character in Spenser's The Faerie Queene, representing the incontinence of lust, followed in the next canto by a study of that of anger;Edmund Spenser, The Fairie Queen (1978) p. lxiv and as late as Jane Austen the sensibility of such figures as Marianne Dashwood would be treated as a form of (spiritual) incontinence.Claire Harman, Jane's Fame (2007) p. 126 With the triumph of Romanticism, however, the incontinent choice of feeling over reason became increasingly valorised in Western culture.Mitcham, p. 265\u201356 Blake wrote that \"those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained\".Quoted in M. H. Abrams, The Mirror and the Lamp (1971) p. 251 Encouraged by Rousseau, there was a rise of what Arnold J. Toynbee would describe as \"an abandon (\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1)...a state of mind in which antinomianism is accepted \u2013 consciously or unconsciously, in theory or in practice \u2013 as a substitute for creativeness\".Arnold J. Toynbee, A Study of History (1939) v5 p. 377 and p. 399 A peak of such acrasia was perhaps reached in the 1960s cult of letting it all hang out \u2013 of breakdown, acting out and emotional self-indulgence and drama.Jenny Diski, The Sixties (2009) p. 120-1 Partly in reaction, the proponents of emotional intelligence would look back to Aristotle in the search for impulse control and delayed gratificationDaniel Goleman, Emotional Intelligence (1996) pp. 80\u201383 and p. xiv \u2013 to his dictum that \"a person is called continent or incontinent according as his reason is or is not in control\".Thompson, p. 302 ==See also== * Akrasia *Seven deadly sins ==References== ==Further reading== *Dahl, N.O. 1984.
