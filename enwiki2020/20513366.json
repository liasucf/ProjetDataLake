It was richly illustrated with fashion plates. Le Follet belonged to the numerous fashion magazines which from the 1820s onward replaced the previous dominance of Journal des dames et des modes. It was a part of the great industry of French fashion magazines which competed which each other during the 19th-century, many of which became popular not only in France but also internationally. Le Follet belonged to the most successful of these magazines, and alongside its rival La Mode illustr\u00e9e (1860-1937), Le Follet was particularly internationally successful, with many foreign subscribers in Great Britain and the United States.
