    "text": "Monchhichis is an American animated series based on the stuffed toy line of dolls, released by the Japanese company Sekiguchi Corporation. Produced by Hanna-Barbera, it premiered on ABC on September 10, 1983 as part of The Monchhichis/Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show, replacing Pac-Man (which by then, had been given its own half-hour time slot) from the previous season. The series aired as part of a package show with The Little Rascals and Richie Rich through the end of 1983, but as early as January 7, 1984, because of lower- than-anticipated ratings, the package show was split up into two separate half-hour shows - Monchhchis moved to 8:00 a.m. ET, switching slots with rebroadcasts of Cococinel, the latter of which would move to 9:00 a.m. ET and The Little Rascals and Richie Rich remained in the 8:30 a.m. ET slot, as a downgraded package series The Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show for the remainder of the 1983-84 season. ==Plot== The Monchhichis are monkey-like creatures who live in the forest land of Monchia at the very top of tall trees well above the clouds. The tribe's leader Wizzar is a magical wizard who can make up spells and potions to defeat their enemy, Horrg and the evil Grumplins of Grumplor. ==Voice cast== * Robert Arbogast \u2013 Kauri * Peter Cullen \u2013 TanuTanu * Laurie Faso \u2013 Chimutan * Ellen Gerstell \u2013 Amy * Gary Goren \u2013 Willow * Hettie Lynne Hurtes \u2013 * Laurie Main \u2013 Sakura * Joe Medalis \u2013 Akiyama * Sidney Miller \u2013 Hojita * Bobby Morse \u2013 Moncho * Frank Nelson \u2013 Opa Sylvus * Laurel Page \u2013 Lily * Hank Saroyan \u2013 * Rick Segall \u2013 * Frank Welker \u2013 Oma Josefina * Bill Woodson \u2013 ==List of episodes== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\" ! style=\"background-color: #8A4500; color:white;\" | # ! style=\"background-color: #8A4500; color:white;\" | Title ! style=\"background-color: #8A4500; color:white;\" | Written by ! style=\"background-color: #8A4500; color:white;\" | Original air date |- |} ==Home Media releases== An episode of the show (\"Tickle Pickle\") was released as part of Saturday Morning Cartoons: The 1980s DVD set by Warner Home Video in 2010.
