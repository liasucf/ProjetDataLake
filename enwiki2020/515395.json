The tell (artificial mound) has a height of and is about in diameter.Klaus Schmidt (2009) \"G\u00f6bekli Tepe \u2013 Eine Beschreibung der wichtigsten Befunde erstellt nach den Arbeiten der Grabungsteams der Jahre 1995\u20132007\"; Erste Tempel \u2013 Fr\u00fche Siedlungen; 12000 Jahre Kunst und Kultur; Oldenburg; p. 188 It is approximately above sea level. The tell includes two phases of use, believed to be of a social or ritual nature by site discoverer and excavator Klaus Schmidt, dating back to the 10th\u20138th millennium BCE. During the first phase, belonging to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA), circles of massive 'T'-shaped stone pillars were erected \u2013 the world's oldest known megaliths. More than 200 pillars in about 20 circles are known (as of May 2020) through geophysical surveys. Each pillar has a height of up to and weighs up to 10 tons. They are fitted into sockets that were hewn out of the local bedrock. In the second phase, belonging to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB), the erected pillars are smaller and stood in rectangular rooms with floors of polished lime. The site was abandoned after the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB). Younger structures date to classical times. The details of the structure's function remain a mystery. The excavations have been ongoing since 1996 by the German Archaeological Institute, but large parts still remain unexcavated. In 2018, the site was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. ==Discovery== G\u00f6bekli Tepe site (1) The site was first noted in a survey conducted by Istanbul University and the University of Chicago in 1963.Peter Benedict (1980): Survey Work in Southeastern Anatolia. In: Halet \u00c7ambel; Robert J. Braidwood (ed.): Prehistoric Research in Southeastern Anatolia I. Edebiyat Fak\u00fcltesi Basimevi, Istanbul, pp. 151\u2013191. American archaeologist Peter Benedict identified lithics collected from the surface of the site as belonging to the Aceramic Neolithic, but mistook stone slabs (the upper parts of the T-shaped pillars) for grave markers, postulating that the prehistoric phase was overlain by a Byzantine cemetery. The hill had long been under agricultural cultivation, and generations of local inhabitants had frequently moved rocks and placed them in clearance piles, which may have disturbed the upper layers of the site. At some point attempts had been made to break up some of the pillars, presumably by farmers who mistook them for ordinary large rocks. In 1994, Klaus Schmidt of the German Archaeological Institute, who had previously been working at Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori, was looking for another site to excavate. He reviewed the archaeological literature on the surrounding area, found the 1963 Chicago researchers\u2019 brief description of G\u00f6bekli Tepe, and decided to reexamine the site. Having found similar structures at Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori, he recognized the possibility that the rocks and slabs were prehistoric. The following year, he began excavating there in collaboration with the \u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum, and soon unearthed the first of the huge T-shaped pillars.The story of the discovery and early excavation of the site is told in greater detail in the excavation team's official blog. See: https://www.dainst.blog/the-tepe- telegrams/2016/06/02/gobekli-tepe-the-first-20-years-of-research/ (Accessed 2019-08-04) G\u00f6bekli Tepe site during excavation. ==Dating== The imposing stratigraphy of G\u00f6bekli Tepe attests to many centuries of activity, beginning at least as early as the Epipaleolithic period. Structures identified with the succeeding period, Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA), have been dated to the 10th millennium BCE. Remains of smaller buildings identified as Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) and dating from the 9th millennium BCE have also been unearthed. A number of radiocarbon dates have been published:Dietrich, Oliver. (2011). Radiocarbon dating the first temples of mankind. Comments on 14C-Dates from G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Orient-Arch\u00e4ologie. 4. 12-25. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Lab-Number !!

View of site and excavation ==Complex== Complex E G\u00f6bekli Tepe is on a flat and barren plateau, with buildings fanning in all directions. In the north, the plateau is connected to a neighbouring mountain range by a narrow promontory. In all other directions, the ridge descends steeply into slopes and steep cliffs.Klaus Schmidt: Sie bauten die ersten Tempel. Das r\u00e4tselhafte Heiligtum der Steinzeitj\u00e4ger. Die arch\u00e4ologische Entdeckung am G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Munich 2006, p. 102. On top of the ridge there is considerable evidence of human impact, in addition to the construction of the tell. Excavations have taken place at the southern slope of the tell, south and west of a mulberry that marks an Islamic pilgrimage,Klaus Schmidt: G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Eine Beschreibung der wichtigsten Befunde erstellt nach den Arbeiten der Grabungsteams der Jahre 1995\u20132007. In: Erste Tempel \u2013 Fr\u00fche Siedlungen. 12000 Jahre Kunst und Kultur. Ausgrabungen und Forschungen zwischen Donau und Euphrat. Oldenburg 2009, p. 188. but archaeological finds come from the entire plateau. The team has also found many remains of tools. ===Plateau=== Pillar 2 from Enclosure A (Layer III) with low reliefs of what are believed to be a bull, fox, and crane The plateau has been transformed by erosion and by quarrying, which took place not only in the Neolithic, but also in classical times. There are four and channels on the southern part of the plateau, interpreted as the remains of an ancient quarry from which rectangular blocks were taken. These possibly are related to a square building in the neighbourhood, of which only the foundation is preserved. Presumably this is the remains of a Roman watchtower that was part of the Limes Arabicus, though this is conjecture.Schmidt 2006, p. 105 Most structures on the plateau seem to be the result of Neolithic quarrying, with the quarries being used as sources for the huge, monolithic architectural elements. Their profiles were pecked into the rock, with the detached blocks then levered out of the rock bank. Several quarries where round workpieces had been produced were identified. Their status as quarries was confirmed by the find of a 3-by-3 metre piece at the southeastern slope of the plateau. Unequivocally Neolithic are three T-shaped pillars that had not yet been levered out of the bedrock. The largest of them lies on the northern plateau. It has a length of and its head has a width of . Its weight may be around 50 tons. The two other unfinished pillars lie on the southern Plateau. Area surrounding G\u00f6bekli Tepe ===Tell=== At the western edge of the hill, a lionlike figure was found. In this area, flint and limestone fragments occur more frequently. It was therefore suggested that this could have been some kind of sculpture workshop.Schmidt 2006, pp. 109\u2013111 It is unclear, on the other hand, how to classify three phallic depictions from the surface of the southern plateau. They are near the quarries of classical times, making their dating difficult.Schmidt 2006, p. 111 Apart from the tell, there is an incised platform with two sockets that could have held pillars, and a surrounding flat bench. This platform corresponds to the complexes from Layer III at the tell. Continuing the naming pattern, it is called \"complex E\". Owing to its similarity to the cult-buildings at Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori it has also been called \"Temple of the Rock\". Its floor has been carefully hewn out of the bedrock and smoothed, reminiscent of the terrazzo floors of the younger complexes at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Immediately northwest of this area are two cistern-like pits that are believed to be part of complex E. One of these pits has a table-high pin as well as a staircase with five steps.Schmidt 2006, p. 109 At the western escarpment, a small cave has been discovered in which a small relief depicting a bovid was found. It is the only relief found in this cave. ===Layer III=== At this early stage of the site's history, circular compounds or temene first appear. They range from 10 to 30 metres in diameter. Their most notable feature is the presence of T-shaped limestone pillars evenly set within thick interior walls composed of unworked stone. Four such circular structures have been unearthed so far. Geophysical surveys indicate that there are 16 more, enclosing up to eight pillars each, amounting to nearly 200 pillars in all. The slabs were transported from bedrock pits located approximately 100 metres (330 ft) from the hilltop, with workers using flint points to cut through the limestone bedrock.Schmidt 2000b, pp. 52\u201353 Pillar with the sculpture of a fox Two taller pillars stand facing one another at the centre of each circle. Whether the circles were provided with a roof is uncertain. Stone benches designed for sitting are found in the interior.Mithen 2004, p. 65 Many of the pillars are decorated with abstract, enigmatic pictograms and carved animal reliefs. The pictograms may represent commonly understood sacred symbols, as known from Neolithic cave paintings elsewhere. The reliefs depict mammals such as lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelles, and donkeys; snakes and other reptiles; arthropods such as insects and arachnids; and birds, particularly vultures. At the time the edifice was constructed, the surrounding country was likely to have been forested and capable of sustaining this variety of wildlife, before millennia of human settlement and cultivation led to the near\u2013Dust Bowl conditions prevalent today. Vultures also feature prominently in the iconography of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck and Jericho. Monolith with possible bird figures Few humanoid figures have appeared in the art at G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Some of the T-shaped pillars have human arms carved on their lower half, however, suggesting to site excavator Schmidt that they are intended to represent the bodies of stylized humans (or perhaps deities). Loincloths appear on the lower half of a few pillars. The horizontal stone slab on top is thought by Schmidt to symbolize shoulders, which suggests that the figures were left headless.Schmidt 2010, pp. 244, 246 Whether they were intended to serve as surrogate worshippers, symbolize venerated ancestors, or represent supernatural, anthropomorphic beings is not known. Some of the floors in this, the oldest, layer are made of terrazzo (burnt lime); others are bedrock from which pedestals to hold the large pair of central pillars were carved in high relief.Schmidt, 2010, p. 251. Radiocarbon dating places the construction of these early circles in the range of 9600 to 8800 BCE. Carbon dating suggests that (for reasons unknown) the enclosures were backfilled during the Stone Age. ===Layer II=== A sort of totem pole from G\u00f6bekli Tepe, with portions of humanoid figures. Layer II, 8800\u20138000 BCE \u2013 \u015eanl\u0131urfa (Urfa) Museum Creation of the circular enclosures in layer III later gave way to the construction of small rectangular rooms in layer II. Rectangular buildings make a more efficient use of space compared with circular structures. They often are associated with the emergence of the Neolithic,Flannery and Marcus, The Creation of Inequality, p. 128 but the T-shaped pillars, the main feature of the older enclosures, also are present here, indicating that the buildings of Layer II continued to serve the same function in the culture, presumably as sanctuaries.Schmidt 2010, pp. 239, 241. Layer II is assigned to Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB). The several adjoining rectangular, doorless and windowless rooms have floors of polished lime reminiscent of Roman terrazzo floors. Carbon dating has yielded dates between 8800 and 8000 BCE.Schmidt 2009, p. 291 Several T-pillars up to 1.5 meters tall occupy the center of the rooms. A pair decorated with fierce-looking lions is the rationale for the name \"lion pillar building\" by which their enclosure is known.Schmidt 1990, p. 198 A stone pillar resembling totem pole designs was discovered at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, Layer II in 2010. It is 1.92 metres high, and is superficially reminiscent of the totem poles in North America. The pole features three figures, the uppermost depicting a predator, probably a bear, and below it a human-like shape. Because the statue is damaged, the interpretation is not entirely clear. Fragments of a similar pole also were discovered about 20 years ago in another site in Turkey at Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori. Also, an older layer at Gobekli features some related sculptures portraying animals on human heads.The G\u00f6bekli Tepe \u2018Totem Pole\u2019. News & Notes from the G\u00f6bekli Tepe Research Staff \u2013 2017-03-01 ===Layer I=== Layer I is the uppermost part of the hill. It is the shallowest, but accounts for the longest stretch of time. It consists of loose sediments caused by erosion and the virtually- uninterrupted use of the hill for agricultural purposes since it ceased to operate as a ceremonial center. The site was deliberately backfilled sometime after 8000 BCE: the buildings were buried under debris, mostly flint gravel, stone tools, and animal bones.Schmidt 2010, p. 242 In addition to Byblos points (weapon heads, such as arrowheads etc.) and numerous Nemrik points, Helwan-points, and Aswad-points dominate the backfill's lithic inventory. ==Chronological context== Statue of a wild boar, G\u00f6bekli Tepe, 9000 BCE All statements about the site must be considered preliminary, as less than 5% of the site has been excavated, and Schmidt planned to leave much of it untouched to be explored by future generations when archaeological techniques will presumably have improved. While the site formally belongs to the earliest Neolithic (PPNA), to date no traces of domesticated plants or animals have been found. The inhabitants are presumed to have been hunters and gatherers who nevertheless lived in villages for at least part of the year.The Guardian report 23 April 2008 So far, very little evidence for residential use has been found. Through the radiocarbon method, the end of Layer III can be fixed at about 9000 BCE (see above), but it is hypothesized by some archaeologists that the elevated location may have functioned as a spiritual center during 10,000 BCE or earlier, essentially, at the very end of the Pleistocene. The surviving structures, then, not only predate pottery, metallurgy, and the invention of writing or the wheel, but were built before the Neolithic Revolution that marks the beginning of agriculture and animal husbandry, around 9000 BCE. The construction of G\u00f6bekli Tepe implies organization of an advanced order not hitherto associated with Paleolithic, PPNA, or PPNB societies, however. Archaeologists estimate that up to 500 persons were required to extract the heavy pillars from local quarries and move them to the site. The pillars weigh , with one still in the quarry weighing 50 tons. \"Vulture Stone\", Gobekli Tepe Around the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE G\u00f6bekli Tepe lost its importance. The advent of agriculture and animal husbandry brought new realities to human life in the area, and the \"Stone-age zoo\" (Schmidt's phrase applied particularly to Layer III, Enclosure D) apparently lost whatever significance it had had for the region's older, foraging communities. However, the complex was not simply abandoned and forgotten to be gradually destroyed by the elements. Instead, each enclosure was deliberately buried under as much as of refuse, creating a tell consisting mainly of small limestone fragments, stone vessels, and stone tools. Many animal and even human bones have been identified in the fill.Schmidt 2010, pp. 242\u2013243, 249. Why the enclosures were buried is unknown, but it preserved them for posterity. ==Interpretation== Schmidt's view was that G\u00f6bekli Tepe is a stone-age mountain sanctuary. Radiocarbon dating as well as comparative stylistical analysis indicate that it is the oldest known temple yet discovered anywhere. Schmidt believed that what he called this \"cathedral on a hill\" was a pilgrimage destination attracting worshippers up to distant. Butchered bones found in large numbers from local game such as deer, gazelle, pigs, and geese have been identified as refuse from food hunted and cooked or otherwise prepared for the congregants.Peters & Schmidt 2004, 207 Zooarchaeological analysis shows that gazelle were only seasonally present in the region, suggesting that events such as rituals and feasts were likely timed to occur during periods when game availability was at its peak. Klaus Schmidt, 2014 in Salzburg Schmidt considered G\u00f6bekli Tepe a central location for a cult of the dead and that the carved animals are there to protect the dead. Though no tombs or graves have yet been found, Schmidt believed that graves remain to be discovered in niches located behind the walls of the sacred circles. In 2017, discovery of human crania with incisions was reported, interpreted as providing evidence for a new form of Neolithic skull cult.Julia Gresky, Juliane Haelm and Lee Clare, \"Modified human crania from G\u00f6bekli Tepe provide evidence for a new form of Neolithic skull cult\", Science Advances, Vol. 3, no. 6, 28 Jun 2017. . Schmidt also interpreted the site in connection with the initial stages of the Neolithic. It is one of several sites in the vicinity of Karaca Da\u011f, an area that geneticists suspect may have been the original source of at least some of our cultivated grains (see Einkorn). Recent DNA analysis of modern domesticated wheat compared with wild wheat has shown that its DNA is closest in sequence to wild wheat found on Karaca Da\u011f away from the site, suggesting that this is where modern wheat was first domesticated.Heun et al., Site of Einkorn Wheat Domestication Identified by DNA Fingerprinting, Science, 278 (1997) 1312\u20131314. Steles and sculptures from G\u00f6bekli Tepe in \u015eanl\u0131urfa Museum With its mountains catching the rain and a calcareous, porous bedrock creating many springs, creeks, and rivers, the upper reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris was a refuge during the dry and cold Younger Dryas climatic event (10,800\u20139,500 BCE). Speculation exists that conditions driven by population expansions locally could have led them to develop common rituals strengthened by monumental gathering places to reduce tensions and conflicts over resources, and, probably, to mark territorial claims. Schmidt also engaged in speculation regarding the belief systems of the groups that created G\u00f6bekli Tepe, based on comparisons with other shrines and settlements. He presumed shamanic practices and suggested that the T-shaped pillars represent human forms, perhaps ancestors, whereas he saw a fully articulated belief in deities as not developing until later, in Mesopotamia, that was associated with extensive temples and palaces. This corresponds well with an ancient Sumerian belief that agriculture, animal husbandry, and weaving were brought to humans from the sacred mountain Ekur, which was inhabited by Annuna deities, very ancient deities without individual names. Schmidt identified this story as a primeval oriental myth that preserves a partial memory of the emerging Neolithic.Schmidt 2006, pp. 216\u2013221 It is apparent that the animal and other images give no indication of organized violence, i.e. there are no depictions of hunting raids or wounded animals, and the pillar carvings generally ignore game on which the society depended, such as deer, in favour of formidable creatures such as lions, snakes, spiders, and scorpions.Schmidt 2006, pp. 193\u2013194, 218.Peters & Schmidt 2004, p. 209 Expanding on Schmidt's interpretation that round enclosures could represent sanctuaries, Gheorghiu's semiotic interpretation reads the G\u00f6bekli Tepe iconography as a cosmogonic map that would have related the local community to the surrounding landscape and the cosmos.Dragos Gheorghiu (2015); A river runs through it. The semiotics of Gobekli Tepe's map (an exercise of archaeological imagination); in Andrea Vianello (ed.), Rivers in Prehistory, Oxford, Archaeopress ==Importance== Sites with similar 'T'-shaped pillars from the PPN G\u00f6bekli Tepe is regarded by some as an archaeological discovery of great importance since it could profoundly change the understanding of a crucial stage in the development of human society. Ian Hodder of Stanford University said, \"G\u00f6bekli Tepe changes everything.\" If indeed the site was built by hunter-gatherers, as some researchers believe, then it would mean that the ability to erect monumental complexes was within the capacities of these sorts of groups, which would overturn previous assumptions. Some researchers believe that the construction of G\u00f6bekli Tepe may have contributed to the later development of urban civilization, or, as excavator Klaus Schmidt put it, \"First came the temple, then the city.\"K. Schmidt 2000: \"Zuerst kam der Tempel, dann die Stadt.\" Area of the fertile crescent, circa 7500 BCE, with main sites. G\u00f6bekli Tepe is one of the important sites of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period. The area of Mesopotamia proper at this time was not yet settled by humans. In addition to its large dimensions, the side-by-side existence of multiple pillar shrines makes the location unique. There are no comparable monumental complexes from its time. Since its discovery, however, surface surveys have shown that several hills in the greater area also have 'T'-shaped stone pillars (e.g. Hamzan Tepe, Karahan Tepe, Harbetsuvan Tepesi, Sefer Tepe, and Tasl\u0131 Tepe) but little excavation has been conducted. Most of these constructions seem to be smaller than G\u00f6bekli Tepe, and their placement evenly between contemporaneous settlements indicates that they were local social-ritual gathering places, with G\u00f6bekli Tepe perhaps as a regional centre. So far none of the smaller sites are as old as the lowest Level III of G\u00f6bekli Tepe, but are contemporary with the younger Level II (mostly rectangular buildings, though Harbetsuvan is circular). This could indicate that this type of architecture and associated activities originated at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, and then spread to other sites. A site that is 500 years younger is Neval\u0131 \u00c7ori, a Neolithic settlement. It was excavated by the German Archaeological Institute and has been submerged by the Atat\u00fcrk Dam since 1992. Its 'T'-shaped pillars are considerably smaller, and its rectangular ceremonial structure was located inside a village. The roughly contemporary architecture at Jericho is devoid of artistic merit or large- scale sculpture, and \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, perhaps the most famous Anatolian Neolithic village, was built 2,000 years later. It remains unknown how a population large enough to construct, augment, and maintain such a substantial complex was mobilized and compensated or fed in the conditions of pre-sedentary society. Scholars have been unable to interpret the pictograms, and do not know what meaning the animal reliefs had for visitors to the site. The variety of fauna depicted \u2013 from lions and boars to birds and insects \u2013 makes any single explanation problematic. As there is little or no evidence of habitation, and many of the animals pictured are predators, the stones may have been intended to stave off evils through some form of magic representation. Alternatively, they could have served as totems.Peters & Schmidt (2004), pp. 209\u2013212 The assumption that the site was strictly cultic in purpose and not inhabited has been challenged as well by the suggestion that the structures served as large communal houses, \"similar in some ways to the large plank houses of the Northwest Coast of North America with their impressive house posts and totem poles.\"Banning (2011) It is not known why every few decades the existing pillars were buried to be replaced by new stones as part of a smaller, concentric ring inside the older one.Mann (June 2011), p. 48 Human burials may have occurred at the site. The reason the complex was carefully backfilled remains unexplained. Based on current evidence, it is difficult to deduce anything certain about the originating culture or the site's significance. ==Conservation== Future plans include construction of a museum and converting the environs into an archaeological park, in the hope that this will help preserve the site in the state in which it was discovered.K. Schmidt in Schmidt (ed.) 2009, p. 188. In 2010, Global Heritage Fund (GHF) announced it will undertake a multi-year conservation program to preserve G\u00f6bekli Tepe. Partners include the German Archaeological Institute, German Research Foundation, \u015eanl\u0131urfa Municipal Government, the Turkish Ministry of Tourism and Culture and, formerly, Klaus Schmidt.\"GHF - G\u00f6bekli Tepe - Turkey\", globalheritagefund.org, web: GHF2 . The stated goals of the GHF G\u00f6bekli Tepe project are to support the preparation of a site management and conservation plan, construction of a shelter over the exposed archaeological features, training community members in guiding and conservation, and helping Turkish authorities secure UNESCO World Heritage Site designation for GT.\"GHF \u2013 Gobekli Tepe, Turkey \u2013 Overview\"; globalheritagefund.org: GHF3 G\u00f6bekli Tepe The conservation work caused controversy in 2018, when \u00c7i\u011fdem K\u00f6ksal Schmidt, an archaeologist and widow of Klaus Schmidt, said the site was being damaged by the use of concrete and \"heavy equipment\" during the construction of a new walkway. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism responded that no concrete was used and that no damage had occurred. ==Construction== G\u00f6bekli Tepe follows a geometric pattern. The pattern is an equilateral triangle that connects enclosures A, B, and D. This means that the people who built G\u00f6bekli Tepe had at least some rudimentary knowledge of geometry. The authors of the paper discuss the implications of their findings. The authors suggest that enclosures A, B, and D are all one complex, and within this complex there is a \"hierarchy\" with enclosure D at the top. The authors also say that, compared to previous estimations, the amount of manpower required to build G\u00f6bekli Tepe should be multiplied by three. Third, the idea that each enclosure was built and functioned individually seems less likely \u2014 at least in planning and their early stages \u2014 given their findings. But they maintain that their suggestions that enclosures A, B, and D are a single complex makes it unlikely that each enclosure was built separately. ==Relative chronology== ==See also== *G\u00fcrc\u00fctepe *List of archaeological sites by continent and age *List of largest monoliths *Natufian culture *Prehistoric religion ==Notes== ==References== * Badisches Landesmuseum Karlsruhe (ed.): \"Vor 12.000 Jahren in Anatolien.
