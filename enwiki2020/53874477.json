In doing so, he became Cherno More's youngest-ever first team player in the Bulgarian league, aged 16 years and one day. In the beginning of June 2017 he spent five days on trial at Serie A club Torino, where he trained with the U17 team and took part in one friendly match, scoring a hat-trick. Minchev began to establish himself in the Cherno More first team during the 2017\u201318 season. On 30 March 2018, he scored his first competitive goal for the club, netting Cherno More's first in a 2\u20131 league victory against Pirin Blagoevgrad. ===Sparta Prague=== On 26 June 2020, Minchev moved abroad, signing a 4-year contract with Sparta Prague. ==International career== ===Youth teams=== Minchev made his Bulgaria under-18 debut at the age of 15 in January 2017 during the 2017 Granatkin Memorial Cup. He scored his first goal in the Bulgaria's fifth game of the tournament against Slovakia on 18 January. On 19 September 2017, Minchev made his debut for Bulgaria U17 in a friendly against Turkey U17, scoring the second consolation goal in a 2\u20135 home defeat. In August 2018, Minchev took part in the Vaclav Jezek Tournament with Bulgaria U18. He scored three goals during the tournament in Vrchlab\u00ed, Czech Republic, and was named Player of the Tournament. ===Senior team=== After a good run of form with Cherno More, on 11 March 2019 Minchev was called up by manager Petar Hubchev to the senior Bulgarian squad for the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying matches against Montenegro and Kosovo. He made his first senior appearance for Bulgaria in a 1\u20131 home draw against Montenegro on 22 March at the Vasil Levski National Stadium, coming on as a substitute for Spas Delev in the 82nd minute.
