It premiered on 24 February 2015 on TVE's main channel La 1. The series follows the exploits of a patrol of the fictional Ministry of Time, which deals with incidents caused by time travel that can make differences in our current time. On 24 March 2015, it was confirmed that TVE had renewed the series for a second season. The show was renewed for a third season on 22 September 2016. On 29 December 2016 it was announced that RTVE had sold the rights to Netflix to broadcast the third series internationally, outside of Spain, resulting in a bigger production budget. The series was renewed for a fourth season, which started airing on Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola the 5th May 2020. It was known that HBO has acquired the broadcasting rights for the series, at least on HBO Spain and HBO Portugal. ==Plot== The front door of the abandoned Palace of the Duchess of Sueca in Madrid, featured in the series as the fa\u00e7ade of the headquarters of the Ministry. The Ministry of Time is the best kept secret of the state of Spain: an autonomous government institution that reports directly to the Prime Minister. Its patrols have to watch the doors of time so that no intruder from other eras can change history for their own benefit. The series follows the assignments of the Ministry's newest patrol: the one formed by Army of Flanders soldier Alonso de Entrerr\u00edos, 19th century student Amelia Folch and 21st century Samur paramedic Juli\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez. ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Rodolfo Sancho as Juli\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, one of three members of the protagonist patrol. He is a trained SAMUR paramedic from 21st century Madrid. Present as a member of the patrol through season 1 and second half of season 2. His absence during the first half of season 2 was due to his shooting for Mar de pl\u00e1stico. and he left the series at the end of the season after failing to reach an agreement with the show producers. However, in November 2019 it was confirmed he will return for season 4. * Aura Garrido as Amelia Folch, the leader of the protagonist patrol. She is a late 19th-century pioneering university student and an only child from an upper-class Barcelona family, still living with her parents. Garrido left the series halfway through the third season citing scheduling conflicts after she, like Sancho, signed on to other projects due to renewal uncertainty. She left on good terms and was open to returning in the future. In November 2019, it was confirmed her return in season 4. * Nacho Fresneda as Alonso de Entrerr\u00edos, one of three members of the protagonist patrol. A highly experienced 16th-century soldier from Seville, he is portrayed as an expert in fields of combat.

A lesbian from the repressed 1960s, her character is used to express a less rigid viewpoint within the Ministry. * Juan Gea as Ernesto Jim\u00e9nez, Chief Operating Officer inside the Ministry.
