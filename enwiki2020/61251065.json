The portable track, of which a picture from 1887 is still preserved, was repeatedly extended on the dam and then dismantled in sections until the dam was completed. The family of the Italian immigrant Miguel Bancalari ran since 28 February 1874 a grain mill on the Rio Lujan near the town of Pilar. They re-laid the Decauville railway after the opening of the Tranvia Rural de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, whose former route is still visible in satellite photos. When the Ferrocarril Buenos Aires al Pacifico was built, it would have had to cross the existing Decauville railway on an elaborate bridge structure. When the Manzanares station was opened on 24 May 1889, the shortened Decauville railway ended on its southern side. After the mill was closed, the railway continued to operate to bring milk cans from nearby dairy farms to Manzanares.El molino harinero, punto de partida del desarrollo de Pilar. 2 September 2012. Similar Decauville railways were also used in the construction of the Basilica of Our Lady of Luj\u00e1n to bring the bricks from what is now San Bernardo to the Descanso del Peregrino workshop. Later, they were used for the construction of other historical buildings on the banks of the river as well as for excursions.Horacio Papaleo und Nicol\u00e1s Grande: Recorrida por lugares sin conservaci\u00f3n. 12 May 2017.Horacio Papaleo und Nicol\u00e1s Grande: Photo of the \u201aTren Hist\u00f3rico del Parque Avelleneda\u2018.

In the area of the Rio Lujan, the route crossed a high and narrow dam and several watercourses, in particular using a steel bridge over the Arroyo Las Flores. Finally, it crossed the Rio Lujan on a brick dam and ended at the Bancalari mill.Alejandro Tumanoff, Jorge Lusona, Hector Chavez und Oscar Chavez: Ferrocarril Decauville Molino Bancalari, Arqueologia Ferroviaria. 6 November 2010.Mar\u00eda Laura Fourment Photo of a set of points at the Bancalari Mill.
