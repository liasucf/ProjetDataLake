He left the stage briefly to pursue a degree in engineering and returned to appear with Beerbohm Tree's company in 1904. He gained fame as a Shakespearian actor appearing on London and New York stages. In 1931, Anson made his screen debut in John Ford's film Arrowsmith. Director Frank Capra cast him to play the \"High Lama\" in his film Lost Horizon, but Anson died before filming so the role was given to Sam Jaffe. Anson died in Monrovia, California. ==Stage career== His father was the Shakespearean and character actor George W. Anson. His stage debut was at the Court Theatre in London on 27 April 1895. In 1904 (like his father at around this time) he joined Herbert Beerbohm Tree's company. In 1905 he played Brabantio in Othello, his first major role.

The company produced Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, which opened on 7 November 1910, Anson playing Master Ford. This last play came in December 1910 to Toronto, where a reviewer wrote, \"Mr. Anson was especially fine as the jealous husband Ford. Indeed his was a performance that deepened the significance of the play.\" He was in The Witness for the Defence by A. E. W. Mason, which ran for 64 performances at the Empire Theatre, opening in December 1911. This came to Toronto, where the same reviewer wrote, \"Mr. A. E. Anson... is known to be one of the most eloquent actors of the day \u2013 a man much of the type of Sir George Alexander, the possessor of a beautiful voice and the bearing of a person of distinction as he is supposed to be in the play.\" The play Romance by Edward Sheldon, in which Anson played Cornelius van Tuyl, ran for 160 performances in 1913 at the Maxine Elliott Theatre. A critic wrote, \"Mr. Anson's complete command of the resources of his art is a treat to all lovers of acting, and his suave ease upon the stage a thing to be copied by many a player.\"\"What bishops do in their youth\". Walter Prichard Eaton, Plays and Players: Leaves from a Critic's Scrapbook (1916), page 74. In London, Romance opened at the Duke of York's Theatre on 6 October 1915; Anson, who produced the play, appeared again as van Tuyl.
