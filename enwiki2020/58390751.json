    "text": "Vladimir Radunsky (born 1 March 1954 in Perm, Russia - died 11 September 2018 in Rome, Italy) was a Russian-born American artist, designer, author and illustrator. == Life and work == Vladimir Radunsky grew up in Moscow where he studied fine art, design and architecture. In 1973, he studied at the Moscow Architectural Institute. In 1982, he emigrated to New York, became a US citizen, and continued his work as a graphic designer, producing mainly art books and children's books. Radunsky produced very different types of books, such as a book of shapes for young readers, Square Triangle Round Skinny (a set of four books shaped the way their titles suggest); Discovery, a lyrical poem by Nobel-prize winner Joseph Brodsky about the discovery of America, and What Does Peace Feel Like?, a compilation of conversations with children during school visits in the US and Europe. His interactive book, Le Grand Bazar, subtitled For people with imagination age 5 to 105 (published in Paris by Edition du Panama), requires the reader to use scissors, pen, and stapler. Boy Meets Girl is to be read forward, backward, upside down and inside out. The Mighty Asparagus (Harcourt) combines the works of Italian Renaissance painters with his own paintings in a collage.. The Hip-Hop Dog, written by Chris Raschka (HarperCollins), is hip-hop poetry for children, where graffiti art has migrated from walls into a printed book. For his exhibition at Milanese gallery Nina Due and, subsequently, at the Palazzo delle Esposizioni in Rome, Radunsky presented a unique collection of clothes for animals.. Among the works that he designed were an anaconda's wedding dress, a horse's riding breeches, and a hippo's bathing trunks. For the new production of the ballet Don Quixote at the Roman Teatro dell'Opera's 2017-2018 season, Radunsky created the set and costumes. The libretto, originally created in the middle of the nineteenth century by the French Choreographer Marius Petipa, inspired Radunsky to design the set as an enormous pop-up book. == Bibliography == * Mother Goose of Pudding Lane author Chris Raschka 2019, Candlewick Press * If I met Bemelmans\u2026 2015, Buffalo Zine (issue No.3) * Alphabetabum author Chris Raschka 2014, The New York Review Children's Collection * On a Beam of Light author Jennifer Berne 2013, Chronicle Books * Advice to Little Girls author Mark Twain 2013, Enchanted Lion Books * Consigli alle bambine di Mark Twain 2010, Donzelli * Hip-Hop Dog author Chris Raschka 2010, Harper Collins * You? 2009, Harcourt Children's Books * Where The Giant Sleeps author Mem Fox 2007, Harcourt Children's Books * Because... in collaboration with Mikhail Baryshnikov 2007, Ginee Seo Books * Le Grand Bazar 2006, Les Editions Du Panama * Fire!
