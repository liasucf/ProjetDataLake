A son of Nizam Sikandar Jah, he was influenced by the Wahhabi movement and wanted to overthrow the British and defeat his elder brother and Nizam Nasir-ud-Daulah. However, his plans were intercepted by Resident James Stuart Fraser and he was arrested by the Nizam. ==Early life== Mubarez-ud-Daulah was born as Mir Gowhar Ali Khan Bahadur at Purani Haveli, Hyderabad on 18 March 1798. His father Sikandar Jah was the third Nizam of Hyderabad. Mubarez-ud-Daulah's mother was Chandi Begum. His elder brother was Nasir-ud-Daulah, the fourth Nizam. ==Wahhabi uprising== The Wahhabi movement was popularised in India by Shah Waliullah Dehlawi in the 18th century. Mubarez-ud-Daulah was inspired by the Wahhabi movement. He had hated the presence of the British in Hyderabad State since his childhood. On the advice of the British, his father Sikandar Jah had been imprisoned in 1815 for five years. According to Thomas Herbert Maddock, Mubarez-ud-Daulah was instrumental in spreading the Wahhabi movement in the Deccan region. Rasool Khan, the Nawab of Kurnool was also influenced by the movement. When Mubarez-ud-Daulah came to know about it, he struck a secret deal with him. According to the deal, Rasool Khan would set up a secret arsenal to manufacture arms. In return, Mubarez-ud-Daulah would provide monetary help. In , a rumour spread that a Russian army was advancing towards India from Central Asia. It was also believed that the combined armies of Mubarez-ud-Daulah and Rasool Khan would uproot the British and defeat Nizam Nasir-ud-Daulah. Subsequently, the Maratha Empire would be restored and Mubarez-ud-Daulah would be appointed subahdar of Deccan by Mohammad Shah Qajar, the Shah of Persia. James Stuart Fraser, the then Resident of Hyderabad, discovered their plans through his network of spies. He cautioned the Nizam about the conspiracy hatched against them. Fraser believed that Mubarez-ud-Daulah was using Wahhabism as a disguise to \"fulfill his personal ambitions\" and to usurp his elder brother. In June 1839, the Nizam send 10,000 troops to put down the uprising. On 15 June 1839, Mubarez-ud-Daulah was arrested from his palace by Nizam's troops. Along with him, forty-six Wahhabi preachers were arrested from Hyderabad. The Resident and the Nizam set up a Judicial Enquiry Commission. The commission found him guilty of conspiring with Rasool Khan to overthrow the British and Nizam. The commission also believed that he was trying to spread sedition amongst the Muslim soldiers of Secunderabad. Subsequently, Mubarez-ud-Daulah was imprisoned at the Golconda Fort. He died as a state prisoner on 25 June 1854. ==Personal life== Mubarez- ud-Daulah's full name with titles is Mubarez-ud-Daulah, Nawab Mir Gowhar Ali Khan Bahadur, Mubaraz Jung.
