In 1974, Thomas F. Keller, a 1953 Duke graduate, became the graduate school's new dean. In three years, Keller's capital campaign raised $24 million, $10 million of which came from businessman and philanthropist J.B. Fuqua. The graduate school's name was then changed to The Fuqua School of Business. J.B. Fuqua was raised by his grandparents on a tobacco farm in Prince Edward County, Virginia. Fuqua began his relationship with Duke University when he borrowed books by mail from the Duke library. J.B. Fuqua's cumulative giving to Duke was nearly $40 million at the time of his death on April 5, 2006. In September 2008, Fuqua launched an expansion initiative to establish offices in St. Petersburg, Russia; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Shanghai/Kunshan, China; New Delhi, India; and London, England. ==Admissions== A Bust of J.B.
