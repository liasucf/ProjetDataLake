    "text": "Pal\u00f3c soup (Hungarian: pal\u00f3cleves) is a soup similar to Hungarian goulash soup, but lighter and a bit sour in taste. Contrary to popular opinion, the soup was not named after the pal\u00f3c people. ==History== The exact history of the soup is not known, however, there are several legends surrounding its origins. The most prominent is the soup having been created by J\u00e1nos Gundel, for a restaurant opening event, where well-known writer K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Miksz\u00e1th was invited to. Gundel named the soup after Miksz\u00e1th's nickname, \"the greatest of Pal\u00f3c people\". Elek Magyar's prominent cookbook, Az \u00ednyesmester szak\u00e1csk\u00f6nyve recalls the soup being created for a food contest, where the jury liked it so much they ate two bowls of it. ==Recipes== Pal\u00f3c soup is usually made of mutton, pork or beef, rarely from turkey. Previous recipes called for the vegetables to be cooked separately. The soup is often made by mixing sour cream, but can be served with sour cream in a separate bowl. Newer recipes use vinegar or lemon to give the soup a sourish taste and some dill can also be used as decoration. ==See also== * List of soups ==References== Category:Hungarian soups ",
