    "text": "Plamenac (, also transliterated Plamenatz) is a Montenegrin surname, derived from the word plamen (flame), literally meaning \"out of the flame\". It has origins from the Boljevi\u0107i of the Crmnica nahija in Montenegro. Its bearers are ethnic Serbs and Montenegrins, of Orthodox faith. The family descends from Ilija Bogustinovi\u0107, a nobleman from Bosnia, who following its fall to the Ottomans fled to Zeta and became a prominent figure on the court of Lord Ivan Crnojevi\u0107. He earned a nickname Plamenac (fiery), because at the meeting on Vranjina Island in 1492 he spoke so passionately campaigning for the war against the Turks that it seemed as the fire was coming out of his mouth, as observed by a Venetian envoy present at the meeting.
