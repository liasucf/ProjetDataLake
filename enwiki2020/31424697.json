    "text": "The Grammy Award for Best Regional Roots Music Album is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 as the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for releasing albums in the regionally based traditional American music, including Hawaiian, Native American, polka, zydeco and Cajun music genres. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\". The category was introduced in 2012 in which the previous Best Hawaiian Music Album, Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album and Best Native American Music Album categories were combined. The change was the result of a major overhaul of Grammy categories, announced in April 2011. The new category also recognizes other American roots forms, such as polka, whose own Grammy category was discontinued in 2009. == Recipients == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Year ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Performing artist(s) ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Work ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Nominees ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Ref. |- | align=\"center\"|2012 | Rebirth Brass Band | Rebirth of New Orleans | | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"|2013 | Wayne Toups, Steve Riley & Wilson Savoy | The Band Courtbouillon | | align=\"center\"|[List of 2013 nominees ] |- | align=\"center\"|2014 | Terrance Simien and the Zydeco Experience | Dockside Sessions | | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"|2015 | Jo-El Sonnier | The Legacy | | align=\"center\"|List of Nominees 2015 |- | align=\"center\"|2016 | Jon Cleary | Go Go Juice | | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"|2017 | Kalani Pe'a | E Walea | | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"|2018 |The Lost Bayou Ramblers |Kalenda | | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\"|2019 |Kalani Pe'a |No 'Ane'i | | align=\"center\"|Grammy.com, 7 December 2018 |- | align=\"center\"|2020 | Ranky Tanky | Good Time | | align=\"center\"|2020 Grammy Awards nominations list |- |} Each year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year. ==References== == External links == * Official Site of the Grammy Awards Category:Awards established in 2012 Regional Roots Music Album ",
