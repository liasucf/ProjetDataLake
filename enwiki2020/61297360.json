J. McLeod Motorsports Chevrolet for Vinnie Miller. ==Race== ===Summary=== Cole Custer started on pole, but Christopher Bell overtook him before the first lap, causing Custer to ultimately not lead a single lap during the race. The first caution occurred on lap 33 when John Hunter Nemechek's car backed into the wall due to brake failure, causing heavy rear-end damage from which he couldn't recover. By the end of Stage 1, Tyler Reddick drove low under Brandon Jones in a desperate attempt to overtake him. They battled on the frontstretch, nearly allowing Bell to capture the win, but Jones managed to hang on and win the stage. Stage 2 did not see any cautions, and Bell was able to win the stage ahead of Justin Allgaier. On lap 142, Noah Gragson spun and the caution was thrown for debris. The ensuing restart tightened the field, with Paul Menard and Harrison Burton racing each other particularly hard. On lap 155, Menard slammed Burton, who spun and made contact with the wall. Burton was not able to recover from the damage sustained. Menard stated after the race that Burton had ran into him twice earlier in the race and Menard was \"voicing his displeasure\". Bell pulled away and continued his dominating lead, eventually holding off Custer and winning the race. ===Stage Results=== Stage One Laps: 45 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:98% |- !
