    "text": "Rootless cosmopolitan () was a pejorative Soviet epithet which referred mostly to Jewish intellectuals as an accusation of their lack of patriotism, i.e. lack of full allegiance to the Soviet Union, especially during the anti- cosmopolitan campaign of 1948\u20131953. The anti-cosmopolitan campaign began in 1946 when Joseph Stalin attacked writers who were ethnic Jews in a speech in Moscow and culminated in the exposure of the non-existent Doctors' Plot in 1953. == Origin == The expression was coined in the 19th century by Russian literary critic Vissarion Belinsky to describe writers who lacked Russian national character.Orlando Figes The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia, 2007, , page 494. The idea also comes from German Romantic criticism of Bodenlosigkeit (\"absence of roots\", \"ground\"). == Use under Stalin == According to the journalist Masha Gessen, a concise definition of rootless cosmopolitan appeared in an issue of Voprosy istorii (The Issues of History) in 1949: \"The rootless cosmopolitan [...] falsifies and misrepresents the worldwide historical role of the Russian people in the construction of socialist society and the victory over the enemies of humanity, over German fascism in the Great Patriotic War.\" Gessen states that the term used for \"Russian\" is an exclusive term that means ethnic Russians only and so she concludes that \"any historian who neglected to sing the praises of the heroic ethnic Russians [...] was a likely traitor\". According to Cathy S. Gelbin: > From 1946 onwards, then, when Andrei Zhdanov became director of Soviet > cultural policy, Soviet rhetoric increasingly highlighted the goal of a pure > Soviet culture freed from Western degeneration. This became apparent, for > example, in a piece in the Soviet weekly Literaturnya gazeta in 1947, which > denounced the claimed expressions of rootless cosmopolitanism as inimical to > Soviet culture. From 1949 onwards, then, a new series of openly antisemitic > purges and executions began across the Soviet Union and its satellite > countries, when Jews were charged explicitly with harbouring an > international Zionist cosmopolitanist conspiracy.Cathy S.

According to Margarita Levantovskaya: > The campaign against cosmopolitanism of the 1940s and 1950s [...] defined > rootless cosmopolitans as citizens who lacked patriotism and disseminated > foreign influence within the USSR, including theater critics, Yiddish- > speaking poets and doctors. They were accused of disseminating Western > European philosophies of aesthetics, pro-American attitudes, Zionism, or > inappropriate levels of concern for Jewry and its destruction during World > War II.
