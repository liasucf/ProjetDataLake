    "text": "is a motorcycle racing arcade game developed and manufactured by Sega released in 1990 in Japan, North America, and Europe. It was also ported to the Sega Master System and Game Gear in 1993. ==Sega Master System version== This version is played permanently in a split screen, regardless of if one or two players are playing. If only one player is racing then the second player is replaced by a computer opponent called \"Wayne.\" \"Wayne\" plays like a human player in that his performance varies from race to race, in contrast to most racing games of the era, where the main opponent is programmed to always finish in the same position. ==Reception== In Japan, Game Machine listed GP Rider on their November 15, 1990 issue as being the fourth most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. The One reviewed the arcade version of GP Rider in 1991, calling it a \"realistic motorcycle simulation\" and praising its graphics, expressing that GP Rider has \"amazingly smooth scrolling\" and \"great new gradient effects\". The One also praises GP Rider's motorcycle controller hardware as \"realistic\" and adding to the game's atmosphere. The One notes GP Rider as \"the first motorcycle game that lets you race against another player\", and expresses that this competitive \"head-to-head excitement with a superb implementation and ultra realistic bike handling [makes GP Rider] something well worth major coin investment.\" ==Notes== ==References== ==See also== *Hang-On ==External links== * * Category:1990 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Motorcycle video games Category:Master System games Category:Sega Game Gear games Category:Sega-AM2 games Category:Sega arcade games Category:Video games designed by Yu Suzuki Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Hiroshi Kawaguchi Category:Video games scored by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi ",
