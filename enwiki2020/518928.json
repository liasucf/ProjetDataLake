    "text": "Secret Window is a 2004 American psychological horror thriller film starring Johnny Depp and John Turturro. It was written and directed by David Koepp, based on the novella Secret Window, Secret Garden by Stephen King, featuring a musical score by Philip Glass and Geoff Zanelli. The story appeared in King's 1990 collection Four Past Midnight. The film was released on March 12, 2004, by Columbia Pictures; it was a moderate box office success and received mixed reviews from critics. ==Plot== After catching his wife Amy having an affair with their friend Ted, mystery writer Mort Rainey retreats to his cabin at Tashmore Lake in upstate New York, depressed and suffering from writer's block. Six months pass, and Mort has delayed finalizing the divorce. One day, a drawling Mississippian named John Shooter arrives at the cabin and accuses Mort of plagiarizing his short story, \"Sowing Season\". Upon reading Shooter's manuscript, Mort discovers it is virtually identical to his own story, \"Secret Window\", except for the ending. The following day, Mort, who once plagiarized another author's story, tells Shooter that his story was published two years before Shooter's, invalidating his plagiarism claim. Shooter demands proof and warns Mort against contacting the police. That night, Mort's dog, Chico, is found dead outside the cabin, along with a note from Shooter giving Mort three days to provide proof. Mort reports the incident to Sheriff Newsome. Mort drives to his and Amy's house intending to retrieve the magazine in which his story was published but leaves because Ted and Amy are there. Mort hires private investigator Ken Karsch, who stakes out the cabin and speaks to Tom Greenleaf, a local resident who may have seen Shooter and Mort talking together. At the cabin, Shooter demands that Mort revise his story's ending to Shooter's version, where the protagonist kills his wife. When an arson fire destroys Amy and Mort's house, Mort reveals to the police that he has an enemy. Karsch tells Mort that he suspects Shooter has threatened Greenleaf after Greenleaf claimed he never saw Mort and Shooter talking together. Mort and Karsch agree to confront Shooter but first will meet up with Greenleaf at the local diner the next morning. Arriving late, Mort discovers that neither Karsch nor Greenleaf showed at the diner. Mort encounters Ted at a gas station where Ted demands Mort sign the divorce papers. Believing Shooter is in Ted's employ, Mort refuses, taunts Ted, and leaves. Shooter summons Mort to a meeting place; when he arrives, Mort finds Karsch and Greenleaf dead inside Greenleaf's truck. Shooter arrives and says the two men had \"interfered\" with his business. Shooter warns that he has implicated Mort in the two men's murders. Mort agrees to meet Shooter at his cabin to show him the magazine containing his story. Mort then pushes Greenleaf's truck off the steep cliff into a water-filled quarry where it sinks. While moving the vehicle, Mort's wristwatch is accidentally ripped off and left inside the truck cab. Mort's literary agent has sent a copy of the magazine with his story. The packet has already been opened and Mort's story ripped out from the magazine. At the cabin, Mort sees Shooter's hat and puts it on. He begins speaking to himself, trying to make sense of the events. Mort realizes that Shooter is a figment of his imagination, a created character brought to life through Mort's undetected dissociative identity disorder, adopted to carry out malevolent tasks like killing Chico, Greenleaf, and Karsch, as well as arson. Amy arrives and sees the word \"SHOOTER\" carved repeatedly on the cabin's walls and furniture. Mort appears, speaking and acting as Shooter and wearing his hat, which a flashback reveals Mort previously bought at a flea market. Amy realizes the name \"Shooter\" represents Mort's desire to \"SHOOT HER\". He chases Amy and stabs her in the ankle. Ted, looking for Amy, arrives and is ambushed by Mort, who smashes his face with a shovel. Amy watches helplessly as Mort beheads Ted with the shovel and does the same to her, reciting the ending of \"Sowing Season\". Mort recovers from writer's block and his overall-mood improves. Mort is feared and shunned in town. Sheriff Newsome arrives and warns Mort that he is the prime suspect in the supposed murders, he will eventually be caught, and says he is no longer welcome in town. Mort passively dismisses the threat. In Mort's writing loft is a previously hidden window overlooking the garden. It is implied that Amy and Ted's bodies are buried under the corn growing there, allowing Mort to slowly destroy any evidence of their murders. In an alternate, longer version of the scene, Ted and Amy's bodies are shown buried beneath the corn. Mort simply eats the corn. ==Cast== *Johnny Depp as Morton \"Mort\" Rainey *John Turturro as John Shooter *Maria Bello as Amy Rainey *Timothy Hutton as Ted \"Teddy\" Milner *Len Cariou as Sheriff Dave Newsome *Charles S.

The site's critics' consensus reads: \"Depp is quirkily entertaining, but the movie runs out of steam by the end.\" On Metacritic, the film has an aggregated score of 46 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"Mixed or average reviews\". Roger Ebert awarded Secret Window three stars out of a possible four, stating that it \"could add up to a straight-faced thriller about things that go boo in the night, but Johnny Depp and director David Koepp ... have too much style to let that happen.\" He continues by noting that the \"story is more entertaining as it rolls along than it is when it gets to the finish line. But at least King uses his imagination right up to the end, and spares us the obligatory violent showdown that a lesser storyteller would have settled for.\" Ian Nathan from Empire only awarded the film 2 stars out of a possible 5, stating that \"The presence of the sublime Depp will be enough to get Secret Window noticed, but even his latest set of rattling eccentricities is not enough to energise this deadbeat parlour trick.\" The film was a modest box office success, succeeding at recouping its budget of $40 million with a worldwide gross of $92 million. ==See also== *List of films featuring mental illness ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:2004 films Category:2004 horror films Category:2000s mystery thriller films Category:2004 psychological thriller films Category:2000s horror thriller films Category:Adultery in films Category:American films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American mystery thriller films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:American psychological horror films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Dissociative identity disorder in films Category:Films about writers Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on horror novels Category:Films based on works by Stephen King Category:Films directed by David Koepp Category:Films set in New York (state) Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Philip Glass Category:Films scored by Geoff Zanelli Category:Fiction with unreliable narrators Category:Films with screenplays by David Koepp ",
