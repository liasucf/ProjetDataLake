He was one of the nine commandants of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) Directorate that assumed power after overthrowing the Somoza regime. N\u00fa\u00f1ez was born in Leon, Nicaragua. He and his brother Ren\u00e9 both joined the Sandinista movement, then underground, in 1969. Carlos N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who received guerrilla training abroad, was quickly put in charge of operations in Leon, then assigned to Managua. In March 1979, he joined the FSLN Directorate, shortly before the FSLN succeeding in overthrowing Anastasio Somoza Debayle. In 1984 he was elected president of the National Assembly and led the process that culminated in the 1987 establishment of the Nicaraguan Constitution. Though the FSLN lost the legislative elections in 1990, N\u00fa\u00f1ez was re-elected that year. His wife Mil\u00fa Vargas also served in the National Assembly. N\u00fa\u00f1ez died of a heart attack on October 2, 1990 in Havana, Cuba, where he was seeking medical treatment. Vargas and four children survived him. ==References== Category:Presidents of the National Assembly (Nicaragua) Category:Sandinista National Liberation Front politicians Category:1990 deaths Category:People from Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua Category:Members of the National Assembly (Nicaragua) Category:1950s births ",
