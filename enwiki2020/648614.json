    "text": "Plot of E_1 function (top) and \\operatorname{Ei} function (bottom). In mathematics, the exponential integral Ei is a special function on the complex plane. It is defined as one particular definite integral of the ratio between an exponential function and its argument. ==Definitions== For real non-zero values of x, the exponential integral Ei(x) is defined as : \\operatorname{Ei}(x)=-\\int_{-x}^{\\infty}\\frac{e^{-t}}t\\,dt=\\int_{-{\\infty}}^{x}\\frac{e^{t}}t\\,dt.\\, The Risch algorithm shows that Ei is not an elementary function. The definition above can be used for positive values of x, but the integral has to be understood in terms of the Cauchy principal value due to the singularity of the integrand at zero. For complex values of the argument, the definition becomes ambiguous due to branch points at 0 and \\infty.Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 228 Instead of Ei, the following notation is used,Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 228, 5.1.1 :E_1(z) = \\int_z^\\infty \\frac{e^{-t}}{t}\\, dt,\\qquad|{\\rm Arg}(z)|<\\pi (note that for positive values of x, we have -E_1(x) = \\operatorname{Ei}(-x)). In general, a branch cut is taken on the negative real axis and E1 can be defined by analytic continuation elsewhere on the complex plane. For positive values of the real part of z, this can be writtenAbramowitz and Stegun, p. 228, 5.1.4 with n = 1 :E_1(z) = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{e^{-tz}}{t}\\, dt = \\int_0^1 \\frac{e^{-z/u}}{u}\\, du ,\\qquad \\Re(z) \\ge 0. The behaviour of E1 near the branch cut can be seen by the following relation:Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 228, 5.1.7 :\\lim_{\\delta\\to0+} E_1(-x \\pm i\\delta) = -\\operatorname{Ei}(x) \\mp i\\pi,\\qquad x>0. ==Properties== Several properties of the exponential integral below, in certain cases, allow one to avoid its explicit evaluation through the definition above. ===Convergent series=== For real or complex arguments off the negative real axis, E_1(z) can be expressed asAbramowitz and Stegun, p. 229, 5.1.11 :E_1(z) =-\\gamma-\\ln z-\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-z)^k}{k\\; k!} \\qquad (|\\operatorname{Arg}(z)| < \\pi) where \\gamma is the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant. The sum converges for all complex z, and we take the usual value of the complex logarithm having a branch cut along the negative real axis. This formula can be used to compute E_1(x) with floating point operations for real x between 0 and 2.5. For x > 2.5, the result is inaccurate due to cancellation. A faster converging series was found by Ramanujan: :{\\rm Ei} (x) = \\gamma + \\ln x + \\exp{(x/2)} \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{ (-1)^{n-1} x^n} {n! \\, 2^{n-1}} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor (n-1)/2 \\rfloor} \\frac{1}{2k+1} These alternating series can also be used to give good asymptotic bounds for small x, e.g. : :1-\\frac{3 x}{4}\\le{\\rm Ei} (x) - \\gamma - \\ln x \\le 1-\\frac{3 x}{4}+\\frac{11 x^2}{36} for x\\ge 0. ===Asymptotic (divergent) series=== Relative error of the asymptotic approximation for different number ~N~ of terms in the truncated sum Unfortunately, the convergence of the series above is slow for arguments of larger modulus. For example, for x = 10 more than 40 terms are required to get an answer correct to three significant figures for E_1(z).Bleistein and Handelsman, p. 2 However, there is a divergent series approximation that can be obtained by integrating z e^z E_1(z) by parts:Bleistein and Handelsman, p. 3 : E_1(z)=\\frac{\\exp(-z)} z \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\frac{n!}{(-z)^n} which has error of order O(N!z^{-N}) and is valid for large values of \\operatorname{Re}(z). The relative error of the approximation above is plotted on the figure to the right for various values of N, the number of terms in the truncated sum (N=1 in red, N=5 in pink). ===Exponential and logarithmic behavior: bracketing=== Bracketing of E_1 by elementary functions From the two series suggested in previous subsections, it follows that E_1 behaves like a negative exponential for large values of the argument and like a logarithm for small values. For positive real values of the argument, E_1 can be bracketed by elementary functions as follows:Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 229, 5.1.20 : \\frac 1 2 e^{-x}\\,\\ln\\\\!\\left( 1+\\frac 2 x \\right) < E_1(x) < e^{-x}\\,\\ln\\\\!\\left( 1+\\frac 1 x \\right) \\qquad x>0 The left-hand side of this inequality is shown in the graph to the left in blue; the central part E_1(x) is shown in black and the right-hand side is shown in red. ===Definition by Ein=== Both \\operatorname{Ei} and E_1 can be written more simply using the entire function \\operatorname{Ein}Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 228, see footnote 3. defined as : \\operatorname{Ein}(z) = \\int_0^z (1-e^{-t})\\frac{dt}{t} = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^{k+1}z^k}{k\\; k!} (note that this is just the alternating series in the above definition of \\mathrm{E}_1). Then we have : E_1(z) \\,=\\, -\\gamma-\\ln z + {\\rm Ein}(z) \\qquad |\\operatorname{Arg}(z)| < \\pi :\\operatorname{Ei}(x) \\,=\\, \\gamma+\\ln x - \\operatorname{Ein}(-x) \\qquad x>0 ===Relation with other functions=== Kummer's equation :z\\frac{d^2w}{dz^2} + (b-z)\\frac{dw}{dz} - aw = 0 is usually solved by the confluent hypergeometric functions M(a,b,z) and U(a,b,z). But when a=0 and b=1, that is, :z\\frac{d^2w}{dz^2} + (1-z)\\frac{dw}{dz} = 0 we have :M(0,1,z)=U(0,1,z)=1 for all z. A second solution is then given by E1(\u2212z). In fact, :E_1(-z)=-\\gamma-i\\pi+\\frac{\\partial[U(a,1,z)-M(a,1,z)]}{\\partial a},\\qquad 0<{\\rm Arg}(z)<2\\pi with the derivative evaluated at a=0. Another connexion with the confluent hypergeometric functions is that E1 is an exponential times the function U(1,1,z): :E_1(z)=e^{-z}U(1,1,z) The exponential integral is closely related to the logarithmic integral function li(x) by the formula : \\operatorname{li}(e^x) = \\operatorname{Ei}(x) for non-zero real values of x . The exponential integral may also be generalized to :E_n(x) = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{e^{-xt}}{t^n}\\, dt, which can be written as a special case of the incomplete gamma function:Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 230, 5.1.45 : E_n(x) =x^{n-1}\\Gamma(1-n,x). The generalized form is sometimes called the Misra functionAfter Misra (1940), p. 178 \\varphi_m(x), defined as :\\varphi_m(x)=E_{-m}(x). Including a logarithm defines the generalized integro-exponential functionMilgram (1985) :E_s^j(z)= \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(j+1)}\\int_1^\\infty (\\log t)^j \\frac{e^{-zt}}{t^s}\\,dt. The indefinite integral: : \\operatorname{Ei}(a \\cdot b) = \\iint e^{a b} \\, da \\, db is similar in form to the ordinary generating function for d(n), the number of divisors of n: : \\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty} d(n)x^{n} = \\sum\\limits_{a=1}^{\\infty} \\sum\\limits_{b=1}^{\\infty} x^{a b} ===Derivatives=== The derivatives of the generalised functions E_n can be calculated by means of the formula Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 230, 5.1.26 : E_n '(z) = - E_{n-1}(z) \\qquad (n=1,2,3,\\ldots) Note that the function E_0 is easy to evaluate (making this recursion useful), since it is just e^{-z}/z.Abramowitz and Stegun, p. 229, 5.1.24 ===Exponential integral of imaginary argument=== right|200px|thumb|E_1(ix) against x; real part black, imaginary part red. If z is imaginary, it has a nonnegative real part, so we can use the formula : E_1(z) = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{e^{-tz}} t \\, dt to get a relation with the trigonometric integrals \\operatorname{Si} and \\operatorname{Ci}: : E_1(ix) = i\\left[ -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\pi + \\operatorname{Si}(x)\\right] - \\operatorname{Ci}(x) \\qquad (x>0) The real and imaginary parts of \\mathrm{E}_1(ix) are plotted in the figure to the right with black and red curves. === Approximations === There have been a number of approximations for the exponential integral function. These include: * The Swamee and Ohija approximation :: E_1(x) = \\left (A^{-7.7}+B \\right )^{-0.13}, :where ::\\begin{align} A &= \\ln\\left [\\left (\\frac{0.56146}{x}+0.65\\right)(1+x)\\right] \\\\\\ B &= x^4e^{7.7x}(2+x)^{3.7} \\end{align} * The Allen and Hastings approximation ::E_1(x) = \\begin{cases} - \\ln x +\\textbf{a}^T\\textbf{x}_5,&x;\\leq1 \\\\\\ \\frac{e^{-x}} x \\frac{\\textbf{b}^T \\textbf{x}_3}{\\textbf{c}^T\\textbf{x}_3},&x;\\geq1 \\end{cases} : where ::\\begin{align} \\textbf{a} & \\triangleq [-0.57722, 0.99999, -0.24991, 0.05519, -0.00976, 0.00108]^T \\\\\\ \\textbf{b} & \\triangleq[0.26777,8.63476, 18.05902, 8.57333]^T \\\\\\ \\textbf{c} & \\triangleq[3.95850, 21.09965, 25.63296, 9.57332]^T \\\\\\ \\textbf{x}_k &\\triangleq[x^0,x^1,\\dots, x^k]^T \\end{align} * The continued fraction expansion ::E_1(x) = \\cfrac{e^{-x}}{x+\\cfrac{1}{1+\\cfrac{1}{x+\\cfrac{2}{1+\\cfrac{2}{x+\\cfrac{3}{\\dots}}}}}}. * The approximation of Barry et al. ::E_1(x) = \\frac{e^{-x}}{G+(1-G)e^{-\\frac{x}{1-G}}}\\ln\\left[1+\\frac G x -\\frac{1-G}{(h+bx)^2}\\right], : where: ::\\begin{align} h &= \\frac{1}{1+x\\sqrt{x}}+\\frac{h_{\\infty}q}{1+q} \\\\\\ q &=\\frac{20}{47}x^{\\sqrt{\\frac{31}{26}}} \\\\\\ h_{\\infty} &= \\frac{(1-G)(G^2-6G+12)}{3G(2-G)^2b} \\\\\\ b &=\\sqrt{\\frac{2(1-G)}{G(2-G)}} \\\\\\ G &= e^{-\\gamma} \\end{align} :with \\gamma being the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant. == Applications == * Time-dependent heat transfer * Nonequilibrium groundwater flow in the Theis solution (called a well function) * Radiative transfer in stellar and planetary atmospheres * Radial diffusivity equation for transient or unsteady state flow with line sources and sinks * Solutions to the neutron transport equation in simplified 1-D geometries ==See also== * Goodwin\u2013Staton integral * Bickley\u2013Naylor functions ==Notes== ==References== * , Chapter 5. * * * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * * NIST documentation on the Generalized Exponential Integral * * * * Exponential, Logarithmic, Sine, and Cosine Integrals in DLMF.
