The school has approximately 700 students and has a range of extra curricular activities which include music and choir, drama, debating, equestrian and golf. ==History== In 1925, the school was registered as a secondary school with the approval of the Department of Education. Many of the students educated at St. Joseph\u2019s from the 1920s onwards entered Teacher Training Colleges or University or went on to work in the Civil Service. During the 1960s, it became increasingly evident that a new school would have to be built as student numbers continued to grow. In an effort to support the work of the Sisters, a Parents Association was formed to raise funds for the building project. A government grant was made available and in 1969 the main block of St. Joseph\u2019s Secondary School, as we know it, was officially opened.CEIST: Catholic Education an Irish Schools Trust ceist.ie In 2007, the school began operating under the trusteeship of CEIST Catholic Education an Irish Schools Trust. ==Mission statement== St Joseph\u2019s Mercy Secondary School states that it is 'informed and influenced by the teaching and example of Jesus Christ and is conducted in an atmosphere of care, respect and joy.'Our Mission from MercyNavan.ie, retrieved 23 July 2015 == References == ==External links== * St Joseph's Secondary School site Category:Secondary schools in County Meath Category:Girls' schools in the Republic of Ireland Category:Educational institutions established in 1853 Category:Catholic secondary schools in Ireland Category:Sisters of Mercy schools ",
