Muriel a and\u011bl\u00e9 (Muriel and Angels) is a comic album written by Milo\u0161 Macourek and drawn by K\u00e1ja Saudek, originally created in the late 1960s and published in 1991. The album is considered one of the masterworks of Czech comics; it was voted the best Czech comic in a poll held by the newspaper Mlad\u00e1 fronta DNES in 2009. Muriel and Angels tells the story of a young physician Muriel Ray and her friend Ro, a winged angel who came to Earth from a distant future. The main character was inspired by the Czech film star Olga Schoberov\u00e1, and the main antagonist, militant general Ian Xeron, was inspired by Saudek's twin brother, photographer Jan Saudek. == Background == K\u00e1ja Saudek met Macourek in 1960, through Olga Schoberov\u00e1, a young shopgirl in a Prague's ironmongery.Prok\u016fpek (2009), p. 148 \"P\u0159ivedla m\u011b k n\u011bmu Olga Schoberov\u00e1, p\u016fvabn\u00e1 prodava\u010dka ze \u017eelez\u00e1\u0159stv\u00ed u Rotta...\" Their artistic collaboration began in 1966, and was initially focused on film. Saudek created special effects for the film Kdo chce zab\u00edt Jessii? (Who Wants to Kill Jessie?); Macourek was a co-author of the screenplay.Prok\u016fpek (2009), p. 148 \"Macourek k filmu napsal (spole\u010dn\u011b s re\u017eis\u00e9rem V\u00e1clavem Vorl\u00ed\u010dkem) sc\u00e9n\u00e1\u0159 a Saudek dostal na starosti celkovou v\u00fdtvarnou stylizaci...\"Kdo chce zab\u00edt Jessii? at imdb.com Following that, both artists decided to work also in the comics genre. The cycle about the adventures of a beautiful doctor Muriel was intended to have twelve parts; however, only two parts have been created. The cycle was initially inspired by the French comic Barbarella, later adapted to a film by Roger Vadim. The main characters of the French and Czech albums are similar\u2014a winged man and a beautiful young woman.Prok\u016fpek (2009), p. 149 The publishing of the first part of the cycle was announced in 1969 in the magazine Mlad\u00fd sv\u011bt, however, the tightened communist censorship following the Prague Spring considered the story potentially dangerous and banned its publishing. \"P\u0159\u00edb\u011bh o lodn\u00ed l\u00e9ka\u0159ce, je\u017e zachr\u00e1n\u00ed and\u011bla, kter\u00fd j\u00ed p\u0159edstav\u00ed sv\u011bt bez nen\u00e1visti, zl\u00fdch lid\u00ed i smrti, vystra\u0161il dobovou cenzuru, a tak komiks Muriel a and\u011bl\u00e9, nakreslen\u00fd podle sc\u00e9n\u00e1\u0159e Milo\u0161e Macourka, nakonec vy\u0161el poprv\u00e9 a\u017e v roce 1991.\"Diesing (2009), p. 269 \"...z politick\u00fdch d\u016fvod\u016f v\u0161ak nebyla nakonec vyd\u00e1na ani jedna z nich.\" Muriel and Angels was eventually published in 1991, following the fall of the Czechoslovak communist r\u00e9gime. Muriel and Angels is considered one of Saudek's master works.Diesing (2009), p. 257 \"Saudek s\u00e1m se p\u0159edvedl v mistrovsk\u00e9 form\u011b, je\u017e snese srovn\u00e1n\u00ed se sv\u011btovou \u0161pi\u010dkou.\" It was inspired by \"visual psychedelia\" of the hippie culture of the 1960s, but additionally uses some elements of futurism and symbolism. Another characteristic feature of the book is Saudek's processing of the sequences of pictures, similar to film editing.Diesing (2009), p. 257 \"Komiks vynik\u00e1 tak\u0159ka dokonale filmov\u00fdmi z\u00e1b\u011bry a st\u0159ihem...\" The formatting of individual pages is unusual, given the time of the creation of the book. It makes use of bevelled frames, enabling innovative work with the space and perspective.Diesing (2009), p. 257 \"...vynikaj\u00edc\u00edm zp\u016fsobem se zde pracuje s perspektivou a nezvykl\u00e9 na svou dobu je r\u016fzn\u011b zkosen\u00e9 form\u00e1tov\u00e1n\u00ed panel\u016f...\" == Plot == At the beginning of the story, Muriel saves the life of the angel Ro. Ro enables her to visit the world of distant future, full of young and beautiful winged people, who live in peace and love, without wars and armies. Maniacal general Xeron manages to travel with them, but he doesn't like the optimistic and peaceful vision of future and attempts to prevent it. Muriel and Ro seek to protect a young boy, who is the future inventor of immortality. The boy's name is Mike Richardson.Diesing (2009), p. 257 == See also == *Muriel a oran\u017eov\u00e1 smrt == Literature == * == Notes == == References == * * == External links == *Muriel a and\u011bl\u00e9 - podivn\u00e1 poh\u00e1dka?
