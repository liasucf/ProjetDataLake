It was also featured on the soundtrack of the video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. ==Background== According to DJ Premier, \"Mass Appeal\" was recorded to poke fun at radio when it came to hip hop music : > \"It was recorded as a joke. We just wanted to make fun of the radio on what > it sounded like to get airplay. That\u2019s why I made the background melody real > simplistic. I was making fun of the radio, but I\u2019m going to make a funky > version of making fun of it. Everything\u2019s a vision, and your brain has to be > that intense to be able to capture that. What the radio played, when it came > to hip-hop, it sounded too watered down. That was making fun of it, but that > record did real good for us\". The track samples Vic Juris' 1980 song \"Horizon Drive.\" ==Music video== The music video was released in March 1994, shortly after Hard to Earn was released. The first verse featured Guru rapping inside an old apartment complex. The second verse featured Guru rapping inside a moving car, and the third verse featured Guru rapping on a beach. DJ Premier mentioned the video was filmed on a very cold night in Far Rockaway. ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1994) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} == References == == External links == * Category:1994 songs Category:1994 singles Category:Gang Starr songs Category:Song recordings produced by DJ Premier Category:Songs written by DJ Premier Category:Chrysalis Records singles ",
