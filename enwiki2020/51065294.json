    "text": "Thu Van Tran (born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, 1979) is an artist. She lives and works in Paris, France. ==Works== Tran's work has been characterised by literature, architecture and history. Her birth country, Vietnam \u2013 a former French colony \u2013 and her homeland France bring her to think and work with duality, inequality and instability as structural elements of her practice. Her work takes form of semantic or sculptural compositions that are placed in contemplative and discursive fields. In 2016 Tran is showing a solo exhibition at les Abattoirs, FRAC Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Toulouse (France), besides having her first solo exhibition in Germany at the Neuer Berliner Kunstverein, Berlin (Germany) and a solo exhibition at the Macleay Museum in Sydney (Australia).
