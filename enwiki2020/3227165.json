Mills, Dictionary of English Place-Names (Oxford UP, 2nd ed., 1998), p. 32. == Demographics == === Population === leftOverall, the population of Beighton has increased. From 1850 till 1910 there was a rapid decline in population due to the industrial revolution which attracted the rich families whom were previously living in large estates in Beighton countryside, into the busy city centres such as London to profit from the industrial boom. From 1910 to around 1920 population started to grow, however it then dropped due to the First World War where a large number of men whom where of fighting age joined their local regiments. From 1960 till 2010 the population has steadily grown, to the current population of 436. The ethnic make up of the area is predominantly white; 96.3% of the population in this area are White (English, Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish) alongside various minority races. 25% of the population in the Parish are 25-44 and 29% of the population is between the age of 45\u201364 years old. == Occupation == From the population of Beighton, 84 people have no qualifications. According to the 2011 census 101 people have a qualification of a degree and 172 have qualifications below degree level. Between males and females in 1881 there was a large contrast between the occupation field. Males tended to do the more manual jobs such as agriculture and construction whilst females tended to either be house wives or work in the domestic field.leftThe occupation structure of males and females in 2011 According to the 2011 census, the occupation structure has dramatically changed. Majority of the working women in Beighton are employed in the Education, Health and Social work in 2011 rather than being in the domestic sector or with no known work in 1881. The men of the village have moved from agricultural work in to construction and manufacturing. This shift for both males and females has come from an improvement in education and the change in industry due to the industrial revolution. There is dramatic change in that from 1881 to 2011 women started working and thus got educated and become qualified to have occupations which were once male dominated. In Beighton 20% of the population between the age of 16-74 are socio-economically classified as \"Lower managerial and professional occupations\" Examples of \"Lower managerial and professional occupations\" are social workers, nurses, journalists, retail managers and teachers. == Landmarks == === Church of All Saints === The earliest work is from the 13th century but the rest of the church seems to be of 14th century date.
