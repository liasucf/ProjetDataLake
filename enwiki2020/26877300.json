It was heard on Friday nights at 10:30pm beginning October 4, 1935. Because the show's sponsor was the Elgin National Watch Company, the title was sometimes announced as Elgin Campus Revue. The featured performers were the Mills Brothers, the first African-Americans to have a network show on radio. Writing about \"Sepia singers and musicians\" in the California Eagle (November 25, 1935), Charles Isaac Bowen commented: :At the present time there is only one Negro group on big time, that is a regular network commercial program and they are the Mills Brothers, the mainstays of the Elgin Watch company. They air out in the Campus Revue coming from Chicago over NBC each Friday night. The boys were signed for a quarter-year contract which has yet another month to go.Bowen, Charles Isaac. \"On the Air or Otherwise,\" California Eagle, November 25, 1935.
