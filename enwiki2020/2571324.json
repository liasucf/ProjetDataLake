    "text": "\"Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud\" is a funk song performed by James Brown and written with his bandleader Alfred \"Pee Wee\" Ellis in 1968. The first part of the song was arranged by Belford \"Sinky\" Hendricks. It was released as a two-part single which held the number-one spot on the R&B; singles chart for six weeks, and peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100.White, Cliff (1991). \"Discography\". In Star Time (pp. 54\u201359) [CD booklet]. New York: PolyGram Records. Both parts of the single were later included on James Brown's 1968 album A Soulful Christmas and on his 1969 album sharing the title of the song. The song became an unofficial anthem of the Black Power movement. \"Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud\" was Brown's first recording to feature trombonist Fred Wesley. ==Lyrics== In the song, Brown addresses the prejudice towards blacks in America, and the need for black empowerment. He proclaims that \"we demands a chance to do things for ourself/we're tired of beating our head against the wall/and workin' for someone else\". The song's call-and-response chorus is performed by a group of young children, who respond to Brown's command of \"Say it loud\" with \"I'm black and I'm proud!\" The song was recorded in a Los Angeles area suburb with about 30 young people from the Watts and Compton areas. The lyrics \"We've been 'buked and we've been scorned/We've been treated bad, talked about as sure as you're born\" in the first verse of the song paraphrase the spiritual \"I've Been 'Buked\". Several other Brown singles from the same era as \"Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud\", notably \"I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing (Open Up the Door, I'll Get It Myself)\", explored similar themes of black empowerment and self- reliance. The song's opening exhortation, \"With your bad self\", is an example of linguistic reappropriation, and added a new entry to Brown's long list of nicknames: \"His Bad Self.\" ==Recognitions== The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included \"Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud\" in their 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. In 2004 it was ranked number 305 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. It inspired the title of a VH1 television special and box set, Say It Loud! A Celebration of Black Music in America. \"'Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud' was a record that really convinced me to say I was black instead of a negro,\" remarked Public Enemy's Chuck D. \"Back then black folks were called negroes, but James said you can say it loud: that being black is a great thing instead of something you have to apologise for.\"Mojo, March 2002 However in direct response to the song's message, Willie Cobbs wryly observed that Brown was a millionaire by that point, as Cobbs retort was \"Sing It Low - I'm Black and I'm Poor\". ==Personnel== * James Brown \u2013 lead vocal * Unknown children's chorusLeeds, Alan, and Harry Weinger (1991). \"Star Time: Song by Song\".

A few performers have recorded cover versions of the song, including jazz saxophonist Lou Donaldson (on his 1969 album Say It Loud!), reggae singer Bob Marley (in a medley with \"Black Progress\") and the punk rock band Black Randy and the Metrosquad. A slightly modified version of the bassline of \"Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud\" appears in long sections of the track \"Yesternow\" on the Miles Davis album A Tribute to Jack Johnson. Jazz pianist Jaki Byard recites the title phrase at the onset of \"Parisian Thoroughfare\", the opening track of his album The Jaki Byard Experience. However, the recitation is only audible when the track is played at a high volume. The song is referenced in an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, inspired by Black Power protests, Will, the African-American male lead attempts to hold a protest (ironically, Will and his cousin Carlton are the only black people in the room) to get a popular teacher reinstated, he inspires \"Cornflake\", a white fellow student, who stands up and shouts passionately \"Fight the Power Will! Sing it loud, I'm black and I'm proud\", to which Will replies \"See, my man Cornflake's got the spirit. He's a little confused but he's got the spirit\". The song is also referenced in the Temptations song \"Message From a Black Man\". \"Let's Take it to the Stage\" by Funkadelic gives a nod to this song with the lyric \"Say it loud, I'm funky and I'm proud.\" R&B;/Rock artist Meshell Ndegeocello covers the song during her live performances. ==References== ==External links== * [ Song Review] from Allmusic * List of songs that sample \"Say It Loud\u2014I'm Black and I'm Proud\" Category:1968 singles Category:African and Black nationalism Category:Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs number-one singles Category:James Brown songs Category:Songs against racism and xenophobia Category:Songs written by James Brown Category:King Records (United States) singles Category:1968 songs Category:Songs written by Alfred \"Pee Wee\" Ellis ",
