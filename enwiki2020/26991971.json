    "text": "Juan Torres Ruiz (; born 26 November 1989), commonly known as Cala , is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a central defender for C\u00e1diz CF. ==Club career== ===Sevilla=== Born in Lebrija, Seville, Andalusia, Cala finished his football formation at local giants Sevilla FC, making his professional debuts in the 2007\u201308 season for the reserve squad, Sevilla Atl\u00e9tico, which competed in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. On 9 December 2009, he made his first official appearance with the first team, playing 90 minutes against Rangers in the UEFA Champions League in a 1\u20130 group stage home win. Cala would first appear in La Liga on 7 February 2010, again playing the entire game but now suffering a 1\u20132 defeat at Real Zaragoza. In a streak that started on 10 April at M\u00e1laga CF, he scored in three consecutive matches (two wins and one loss), which was a club record for a defender. For the 2010\u201311 campaign, Cala was loaned to FC Cartagena. He was regularly used by the second level team during his spell, making his official debut on 11 September in a 5\u20131 home success over FC Barcelona B and finding the net in the game. On 5 July 2011, Cala signed a one-year loan deal with AEK Athens FC, where he reunited with former Sevilla boss \u2013 main squad and reserves \u2013 Manolo Jim\u00e9nez, as well as teammate Jos\u00e9 Carlos. He played 21 official games during his tenure, scoring on 30 October to conclude a 3\u20130 home win over Aris Thessaloniki F.C. for the Superleague Greece. In late January 2012, Cala was recalled by Sevilla as a replacement for Juventus FC-bound Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres. AEK received \u20ac60,000 in compensation. On 21 December 2013, he scored to open a 2\u20131 win at Villarreal CF, also being sent off when he fouled Jaume Costa for a penalty kick scored by J\u00e9r\u00e9my Perbet; he added eight complete appearances in the UEFA Europa League, which ended in conquest. ===Cardiff City=== On 7 February 2014, Cala signed for Premier League club Cardiff City on a -year contract, after terminating his link with Sevilla. He made his debut for his new team eight days later, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1\u20132 home loss against Wigan Athletic for the round-of-16 of the FA Cup; his maiden appearance in the league took place on the 22nd, but in another defeat at the Cardiff City Stadium, now at the hands of Hull City (0\u20134). Cala scored his first goal for the Bluebirds on 15 March 2014, but in a 1\u20132 loss at Everton. His second came in an away triumph over Southampton on 12 April, as he hit from long range for the game's only goal; fifteen days later he was sent off for the first time in his Cardiff career, during a 0\u20134 away defeat to Sunderland. Cala was released with immediate effect from his Cardiff contract on 3 December 2014, having only made one appearance in the Championship that season. He had previously complained via Twitter for being sent to train with the club's academy. ===Granada / Getafe=== After being strongly linked to Getafe CF, Cala signed a six-month contract with fellow league team Granada CF on 28 January 2015. On 28 May he was deemed surplus to requirements by new manager Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Sandoval, and subsequently left the club. On 25 June 2015, Cala agreed to a three-year deal with Getafe also in the top level. The following 4 January, he scored his first Spanish League goal in over two years, equalising in a 2\u20131 away win against Sporting de Gij\u00f3n. On 6 August 2016, Cala signed a season- long loan deal with FC Anzhi Makhachkala with an option of making the move permanent at the end of it. Seven days later he announced his return through Instagram, alleging personal problems; according to the Russian club's press release, he returned to Spain to care for his younger brother who was having health issues. ===Henan Jianye=== Even though it had always been his intention to agreeing on terms for a new contract, on 1 March 2018 Cala signed with Henan Jianye F.C. for a reported transfer fee of \u20ac1.5 million. He made his debut in the Chinese Super League the following day, playing the entire 0\u20134 home loss against Tianjin Quanjian FC. ===Las Palmas / C\u00e1diz=== On 7 July 2018, Cala joined UD Las Palmas from the Spanish second division for two seasons. He terminated his contract the following 18 June, and moved to C\u00e1diz CF on a five-year deal on 17 July. ==Club statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\" | Club !rowspan=\"2\" | Season !rowspan=\"2\" | League !colspan=\"2\" |League !colspan=\"2\" |Cup !colspan=\"2\" |League Cup !colspan=\"2\" |Continental !colspan=\"2\" |Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Sevilla B||2007\u201308||rowspan=\"2\"|Segunda Divisi\u00f3n||5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0 |- |2008\u201309||11||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||11||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Sevilla||2009\u201310||rowspan=\"1\"|La Liga||5||3||2||0||0||0||1||0||8||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Cartagena (loan)||2010\u201311||Segunda Divisi\u00f3n||25||4||1||0||0||0||0||0||26||4 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|AEK Athens (loan)||2011\u201312||Superleague Greece||13||1||2||0||0||0||6||0||21||1 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Sevilla||2011\u201312||rowspan=\"3\"|La Liga||8||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||14||1 |- |2012\u201313||10||0||3||1||0||0||0||0||13||1 |- |2013\u201314||9||1||2||0||0||0||8||0||19||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"| Total !48!!5!!7!!1!!0!!0!!9!!0!!64!!3 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Cardiff City||2013\u201314||Premier League||7||2||1||0||0||0||0||0||8||2 |- |2014\u201315||Championship||1||0||0||0||2||0||0||0||3||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"| Total !8!!2!!1!!0!!2!!0!!0!!0!!11!!2 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Granada||2014\u201315||rowspan=\"1\"|La Liga||7||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||7||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"| Total !7!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!7!!0 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Getafe||2015\u201316||rowspan=\"1\"|La Liga||22||1||1||0||0||0||0||0||23||1 |- |2016\u201317||Segunda Divisi\u00f3n||31||3||1||0||0||0||0||0||34||3 |- |2017\u201318||La Liga||20||2||2||0||0||0||0||0||22||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"| Total !73!!6!!4!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!77!!6 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Henan Jianye||2018||rowspan=\"1\"|Chinese Super League||11||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||11||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"| Total !11!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!11!!0 |- !colspan=\"3\"| Career total !185!!18!!15!!1!!2!!0!!15!!0!!217!!19 |} ==Honours== Sevilla *UEFA Europa League: 2013\u201314 ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:People from Lebrija Category:Spanish footballers Category:Andalusian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Sevilla Atl\u00e9tico players Category:Sevilla FC players Category:FC Cartagena footballers Category:Granada CF footballers Category:Getafe CF footballers Category:UD Las Palmas players Category:C\u00e1diz CF players Category:Super League Greece players Category:AEK Athens F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:Cardiff City F.C. players Category:Chinese Super League players Category:Henan Jianye F.C. players Category:Spain youth international footballers Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Expatriate footballers in Wales Category:Expatriate footballers in China Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Greece Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Wales Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in China ",
