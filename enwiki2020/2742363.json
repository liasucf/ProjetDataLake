The pound hug (also referred to as a pound shake, hip-hop hug, one-armed hug, dude hug, cootie hug, homie hug, shug, bro-grab, bro hug, brah hug, thug hug, man-hug, or a daps) is a stylized greeting, exclusively performed between two people, that consists of a combination of a handshake and one-armed hug. Unlike the traditional hug, which symbolically and effectively removes interpersonal barriers and unites the two persons embracing, the pound hug\u2014performed by keeping the right hand locked in handshake while the left arm wraps around the other's shoulder\u2014interposes the obstacle of the two right arms to the joining of the two bodies. == Origin == The pound hug evolved from the dap, a type of handshake created by African-American soldiers serving in the Vietnam War. Due to the high racial tensions in the United States during this time, black soldiers were frequent victims of racist violence and systemic discrimination in the military. |ref=1 The dap became a gesture of unity and solidarity between black veterans, with its movements symbolizing \"I\u2019m not above you, you\u2019re not above me, we\u2019re side by side, we\u2019re together\". From these veterans, the dap dispersed into hip hop culture and eventually popular culture, retaining its conveyed sense of camaraderie. == Popular Culture == An example of the pound hug can be seen in the Tupac Shakur video \"I Get Around\" in 1993. ==References== == External links == *How to give the perfect man hug \u2013 VideoJug Category:Greetings Category:Hip hop phrases Category:North American society ",
