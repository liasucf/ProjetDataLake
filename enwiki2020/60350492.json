UNTV operator BMPI started testing Japan's Integrated Service Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial (ISDB-T), the sole digital television (DTV) standard in the Philippines for its transition from analog to digital broadcast, on UHF Channel 38 as its frequency. The network initially activated four subchannels on digital television. UNTV-1, UNTV-2 and UNTV 1-SEG air the same program while ADDTV showcased MCGI praise music videos primarily from A Song of Praise (ASOP) Music Festival.
