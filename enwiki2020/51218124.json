    "text": "Ruth Schloss (; 22 November 1922 \u2013 2013) was an Israeli painter and illustrator. Major themes in her work were Arabs, transition camps, children and women at eye-level. She expressed an egalitarian, socialist view via realism in her painting and drawing. == Biography == Ruth Schloss was born in Nuremberg, Germany, to Ludwig and Dian Schloss, as the second of three daughters of bourgeois assimilationist Jewish family well-integrated into German culture. As the Nazis came into power in 1933, her family immigrated to Israel in 1937, and settled in Kfar Shmaryahu, then an agricultural settlement. Schloss studied at the Department of Schloss graphic design at \"Bezalel\" from 1938 to 1942 alongside Friedel Stern and Joseph Hirsch. She was a realistic painter who focused on disadvantaged people in the society and social matters as an egalitarian. Her realism was thus an \u201cinevitable realism,\u201d motivated by an inner necessity: the need to observe reality as it is. Her painting repeatedly addressed the door pulled from its frame, employing drawing's unique ability to stop time and prolong the image's persistence in the retina, she repeatedly committed to paper - in a matter-of- fact, non-evasive manner devoid of mystery \u2013 man's tendency to generate chaos, suffering and pain. Throughout her life, Schloss remained minimalist. Painting about human fate was the main subject of her artworks. Her natural inclination was to describe the darker aspect of human existence. === 1940s === In this period she mainly depicted landscapes of kibbutz and wretched women living hard life, children in huger, older people, refugees. ==== Life in the Kibbutz ==== After completing her art studies, Schloss joined a training group at Kibbutz Merhavia in 1942, and after two years moved to Karkur region, the nucleus established Kibbutz Lehavot Habashan in the Upper Galilee. Through this time, she fell in love with the surroundings and drew landscapes. They are simple and direct with fresh, lucid lines. These paintings were selected as the main works of her first exhibition in 1949. In early 1945, Schloss started to draw illustrations in the children's magazine Mishmar Leyeladim, and designed the logo of Al Hamishmar, the paper's new name in 1948. In 1948, upon the founding of Mapam (United Workers\u2019 Party), she designed her party's emblem, which became a well-known icon. She kept working as an illustrator for Mishmar Leyeladim until 1949.Information Center for Israeli Art: Ruth Schloss \"Mor the Monkey\" project yielded financial profits and this income was used for a study trip to Paris for two years. She was succeeded as illustrator however, she had inner conflicts of her identity as witnessed painter toward neglected class in Israeli society. ==== First Exhibition at Mikra-Studio Gallery, 1949 ==== She presented forty drawings on paper in her first solo exhibition, representing a selection of the themes of kibbutz landscape, its lifestyle. Schloss confidently proposed her direction through simplicity without using colors in her drawings. === 1950s === Between 1949 and 1951, she studied at the Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in Paris. She began working in oils, with which she continued throughout the 1960s. The exhibition \u201cBack from Paris\u201d opened in November 1951 at Mikra-Studio Gallery . In 1951 she married Benjamin Cohen, who served as chairman of the national leadership of Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party in Tel Aviv. He was a theoretician and a man of principle, highly esteemed by its leaders who became a professor of history at Tel Aviv University. In 1953, following the Mordechai Oren affair and the publication of Moshe Sneh 's followers from Kibbutz Artzi, she and her husband left the kibbutz and moved to the agricultural farm, Kfar Shmaryahu, where she lived until her death. At a certain point in Israeli history, segments of the socialist movement felt that Israel should become part of the Communist bloc, rather than seek the support of the western world. Because the Schloss couple support of Moshe Sneh's left-wing party, they had to leave the kibbutz. She depicted ordinary women without hiding or making up anything. The poet Natan Zach wrote about her works in 1955: \u201cHer motto remains that which has been all these years: life as it is, without bluffing.\" Schloss's \u201cPiet\u00e0\u201d (1953) became a universal cry expressing the pain of mothers on either side of the divide. In the late 1950s, she was the mother of two daughters. When she drew her daughters, unlike the universal babies she depicted, naked and with clenched fists, the painting of her children employed babyish sweetness to the full.She also painted children in the transition camp and Jaffa in the 1950s and 1960s. === 1960s-1980s === Schloss painted at a studio in Jaffa from 1962 till 1983. In this time, she turned her interest to people around her more than kibbutz \u2013 the children, mothers, and poor workers, the alleys and houses. She opened the space to the street and its dwellings, built interactions around it, and was nurtured by the presence of the outside in her work. === 1960s === Schloss painted an Arab woman, Nabva, and images of old people. In the late 1960s, she began to paint in acrylic and never went back to oils. In 1965 Schloss devoted a series \u201cArea 9 (1965)\u201d to the demolition of Arab houses and expropriation of land, carrying a socio-political messages. The series was exhibited at Beit Zvi, Ramat Gan, in 1966. In 1968, Schloss and Gansser-Markus presented \u201cDrawing of War\u201d in Zurich gallery. She expressed the war as an ultimate expression of destruction and ruin, regardless of victors and vanquished. === 1970s === In late 1970s Schloss began printing selected photographs directly on the canvas, reworking them in acrylic. She printed her work at Har-El Printers in Jaffa. This technique was mainly adopted in two large series: Anne Frank (1979-1980) and Borders (1982). Through this technique she placed the figure of elder Frank next to that of the famous young Frank, and released it at the exhibition at Beit Ariela Cultural Center, Tel Aviv, in 1981. The series touched upon the Holocaust. === 1980s === She dedicated a large series Borders, one of the most powerful image linked to the series is the figure of Yemenite woman raising her hand. She was the first to raise the Black Panthers demonstration to the level of a social icon.In the 1980s and again in 2000, the Intifada uprisings led Schloss to render representational and symbolic works that could be interpreted as critical of Israel's political and military actions. === 1990s \u2013 2000s === Schloss exhibited in private galleries and small museums. The main museums, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Israel Museum, included her works only in group exhibitions, and only in 1991 was her retrospective exhibited at the Herzliya Museum. In the 2000s, Schloss turned to the animal kingdom and Bedouins in the south. A huge rhinoceros, birds of prey, and other \"bad animals,\" as Cohen Evron, daughter of Ruth, calls them and \"I connected this to the Nazis,\" said Schloss. In 2006, a large retrospective exhibition of her work was presented at the Museum of Art in Ein Harod, curated by Tali Tamir. == Education == * 1938-41 Bezalel, Jerusalem, with Mordecai Ardon * 1946 painting course for Kibbutz Artzi artists with Yohanan Simon and Marcel Janco * 1949-51 Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re, Paris ==Awards and recognition== *1965 Silver Medal, International exhibition in Leipzig, Germany *1977 Artist-in-residence, The Cit\u00e9 Internationale Universitaire de Paris == Selected solo exhibitions == * 2004 \u201cMicha Baram, Ruth Schloss: Painting-Photography,\u201d The Art Gallery, Kibbutz Cabri, Israel, Curator: Drora Dekel * 2003 \u201cWorks on Photographic Paper,\u201d The Artists\u2019 House, Jerusalem, Curator: Irit Levin * 2001-2003 \u201cRuth Schloss: Reacting to Reality, Works 1982-2002,\u201d Habama Center, Ganei Tikva, Israel (curators: Irit Levin, Miri Krymolowski) * 2001 \u201cThe Last Years,\u201d Givatayim Theater, Israel (curators; Irit Levin, Doron Polak) * 2001 \u201cWorks, 1991-2001,\u201d Beit Gabriel, Tzemach, Israel * 1999 \u201cNew Born,\u201d Nophr Art Gallery, Tel Aviv * 1998-2004 \u201cAnne Frank in Perspective,\u201d Kunstraum am Hallop, Memmingen, Germany\u05ea Traveling exhibition in France (as part of \u201cSemaine contre le Racisme\u201d) * 1997-1999 \u201cIn the Footsteps of Caravaggio,\u201d Municipal Gallery, Kfar Saba, Israel * 1997 \u201cPast Time,\u201d Nama Gallery and Shai Gallery, Tel Aviv * 1993 \u201cPeople and Years,\u201d Nelly Aman Gallery, Tel Aviv * 1992 \u201cRuth Schloss: Retrospective, 1942-1992,\u201d Herzliya Museum of Art * 1989 \u201cIntifada: New Works,\u201d Tiroch Gallery, Tel Aviv * 1989 \u201cBorders,\u201d Produzentengalerie, Zurich * 1982 \u201cBorders 82,\u201d Herzliya Museum, Israel * 1975 Rosenfeld Gallery, Tel Aviv * 1974 Mishkan Le\u2019Omanut, Beit Meirov, Holon, Israel * 1968 \u201cDrawing of War,\u201d Forum Gallery, Zurich (with photographer Ursula Gransser-Markus) * 1966 \u201cArea 9,\u201d Beit Zvi, Ramat Gan, Israel * 1957 The Artists\u2019 House, Jerusalem * 1956 Traklin Gallery, Haifa * 1953 The Artists\u2019 House, Jerusalem * 1949 Mikra Studio Gallery, Tel Aviv == Selected group exhibitions == * 2006 \u201cHero \u2013 Antihero,\u201d Munitipal Gallery, Kfar Saba, Israel, curator: Irit Levin * 2005 \u201cNostalie de Paris,\u201d Ein Hod Gallery, Israel, curator: Avraham Eliat * 2005 \u201cWounds and Bandaging,\u201d The Art Gallery, Umm el-Fahem, Israel, curator: Eif Gan * 2004 \u201c The Art of Aging,\u201d The Jewish Institute of Religion Museum, Hebrew Union College, New York, curators: Ayana Friedman, Laura Kruger (cat.) * 2004 \u201cDrawing.
