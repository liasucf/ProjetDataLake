Coppin State University is named after Fannie Jackson. The stated goal of the club was to study culture and community improvement. The state motto of the club was \"Deeds Not Words.\" It also used the motto \"Lifting as We Climb\". During its heyday, the club served as a \"mother club\" for black club women in California. Journalist and historian Delilah Beasley reported on the activities of the club in her popular column, \"Activities Among the Negroes.\" == Home for the Aged and Infirm Colored People == One of the notable 19th century projects organized by the club was the club's involvement in the creation of the Home for the Aged and Infirm Colored People in Oakland, California. This was the first organization to provide care for elderly African Americans in the state of California. == Membership == Members included many notable Oakland area suffragists and club women including Melba Stafford, Willa Henry, Emma Scott and Hettie B. Tilghman. == Legacy of the club == Club members created a wide variety of organizations aimed to improve the lives of African Americans in the east bay. Hettie B. Tilghman, Willa Henry, Melba Stafford and Delilah Beasley were very community oriented and in 1920 they created the Linden Center Young Women's Christian Association. The Linden Center YWCA offered vocational training as well as cultural programs. Despite the creation of independent organizations that grew out of the Fannie Jackson Coppin club, it remained intact and lasted well into the 1960s. == See also == * Fanny Jackson Coppin * List of California suffragists * Timeline of the women's suffrage movement in California *Women's suffrage in California == References == Category:California suffrage Category:Organizations based in California Category:Women's suffrage advocacy groups in the United States Category:YWCA leaders Category:Feminism in California Category:African-American women's organizations ",
