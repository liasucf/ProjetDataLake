    "text": "Off the ball (or OTB) is a term used in football in the United Kingdom, usually associated with a player's action when not in possession of the ball, such as a fight or a late challenge. If a referee does not see an OTB incident, his assistant referee or linesman may draw his attention, usually activating a buzzer that the referee has strapped to his upper arm. The linesman will inform the referee as to what happened and the referee will act accordingly to the laws of the game. This may involve sending the involved player off or otherwise booking him. == External links == * Tottenham 4-1 Bolton, BBC Sport, 25 February, 2007. * Clockwatch: China 0-2 Costa Rica, BBC Sport, 4 June, 2002.
