    "text": "\u0130nce Minareli Medrese (literally Slender Minaret Medrese) is a 13th-century madrasa (Islamic school) located in Konya, Turkey, now housing the Museum of Stone and Wood Art (Ta\u015f ve Ah\u015fap Eserler M\u00fczesi). ==History== Built between 1258-1279 by the Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate vizier S\u00e2hib Ata Fahreddin Ali who later founded the Anatolian beylik of S\u00e2hib Ata.Justin McCarthy, The Ottoman Turks, (Longman Publishing, 1997), 1. The minaret was originally much taller than the section that survives today, and had an unusually slender appearance in comparison to the minarets of other contemporary Seljuk mosques, hence the name of the structure. The building has a highly ornamented stone fa\u00e7ade which includes relief work of scripts, geometric patterning and vertical ribbon-like lines. The entrance is surrounded by a band of elegant Thuluth, depicting Sura 36 and Sura 110.Annemarie Schimmel, Islamic Calligraphy, (Brill, 1970), 22. The minaret was damaged by lightning in 1901, and was restored in 1956.Malise Ruthven and Azim Nanji, Historical Atlas of Islam, (Harvard University Press, 2004), 44. The building now houses a museum of stone and wooden objects dating from the Seljuk and Ottoman periods. ==Gallery== 1913 Injeh Minaret Konia.png|Old historical photo Ince Minareli Medrese 02.jpg|Detail of the facade Ince minare entrance.jpg|The highly ornamented stone fa\u00e7ade of the entrance of the \u0130nce Minareli Medrese.
