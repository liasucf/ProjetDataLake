Whysall was a right-handed batsman who did little before the First World War but then developed in the 1920s into a solid and consistent opener in the increasingly successful Nottinghamshire side. He toured Australia as a member of the 1924-25 side, acting as reserve wicket- keeper and playing in three Test matches. He scored 75 at Adelaide and 76 at Melbourne. After being the leading batsman in Nottinghamshire's County Championship-winning side of 1929, Whysall was recalled to the England Test team for the decisive match of the 1930 series against Australia. The move was not a success. Whysall scored only 13 and 10, and was criticised for his lack of mobility in the field, as England lost by an innings. Barely two months later, Whysall was dead. He slipped on a dance floor, injured his elbow, and died within two weeks from septicaemia despite a blood transfusion. Whysall was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1925. ==References== Category:1887 births Category:1930 deaths Category:Deaths from sepsis Category:English cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:Nottinghamshire cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:People from Woodborough, Nottinghamshire Category:Infectious disease deaths in England Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:Sir Julien Cahn's XI cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 Category:Lord Hawke's XI cricketers Category:A.
