In about 1310 the east window of the chancel was inserted and at least two of the windows in the south wall of the chancel were enlarged in the Decorated Gothic style. At the end of the 14th century the north aisle was added, linked with the nave by an arcade of four bays. The large Perpendicular Gothic window in the middle of the south wall of the chancel was inserted in the 15th century, replacing the Norman original. The south porch was added in 1630, the clerestorey was added to the nave in 1636 and the north arcade was probably rebuilt in the same century. The bell tower was built in 1725, probably replacing an earlier one. The west gallery was inserted in 1735. The church was restored and the north porch added in 1871. By 1854 the tower had a ring of six bells, of which the two oldest were cast in 1638 and the remainder in 1679, 1683, 1729 and 1854. The bells were increased to a ring of eight,The Gloucester & Bristol Diocesan Association of Church Bell Ringers: North Cotswold Branch and in 2016 an appeal was launched to replace the bell frame and to increase the number of bells to ten. ==Present day== The ecclesiastical parish now forms part of the Vale and Cotswold Edge team of Church of England churches, with the Team Vicar remaining responsible for Blockley and its outlying villages of Paxford, Draycott and Aston Magna, as well as the parish of Bourton-on-the-Hill.A Church Near You: St Peter & St Paul, Blockley The church is used as St Mary's Roman Catholic church in the Father Brown television series and the vicarage transformed into presbytery for Father Brown's residence.

The tenor bell was recast, two new trebles added, and all the headstocks and other equipment replaced. ==Notable people== * Erasmus Saunders, (1670\u20131724) a Welsh priest and writer, curate and then vicar at the beginning of the 18th century * Thomas Wilson, vicar, later Dean of Worcester (1571\u20131586) * Thomas Henry Morgan (1898-1957) buried in churchyard, A Welsh Uncle -Memories of Tom Morgan 1898\u20131957, John Dann, FastPrint Publishing, 2018 ISBN original Welsh composer of Welsh standard c.1940 We'll keep a Welcome (in the hillside) ==Gallery== Blockley - geograph.org.uk - 47112.jpg| The church within the village Blockley church tower - geograph.org.uk - 889246.jpg| Church tower South porch, Blockley Church - geograph.org.uk - 889236.jpg| South porch St Peter and St Paul, Blockley.jpg|South-west view Blockley Church.jpg ==References== ==External links== * Church website * A Church Near You profile Blockley Blockley ",
