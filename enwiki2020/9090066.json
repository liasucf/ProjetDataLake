Already at that time there was a parish church and a stronghold. It is an evidence that Slu\u0161tice was among significant villages. In 1519 it was bought by Marta Pechancov\u00e1 of Bezd\u011bkov. At that time the stronghold was not inhabited, it was controlled from Kr\u00e1lovice and K\u0159enice and the local stronghold ceased to exist. The village of Slu\u0161tice belonged to the Kr\u00e1lovice and K\u0159enice estates. In 1623 (at the time of the Thirty Years' War) Slu\u0161tice was confiscated, sold to the Prince Charles of Liechtenstein and incorporated into the estate of \u0160kvorec with which it shared its fate. ===Historical development of the name of the village=== The etymology of the word Slu\u0161tice is \"ves lid\u00ed slu\u017ekov\u00fdch\" which is \"a village of servants\". *1223 Miztidruch de Zluscic *1332 apud judicem de Slusicz *1357 villas Zluchsicz et (and) Zlatho (Zlat\u00e1) *1352-1399 decan.
