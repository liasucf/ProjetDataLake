    "text": "Albrecht Dold (5 August 1928, Triberg, Germany - 26 September 2011) was a German mathematician specializing in algebraic topology who proved the Dold\u2013Thom theorem, the Dold\u2013Kan correspondence, and introduced Dold manifolds, Dold\u2013Puppe stabilization, and Dold fibrations. ==Life== Albrecht Dold studied mathematics and physics at Heidelberg University, earning a Ph.D. degree in 1954 under the direction of Herbert Seifert. He visited the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1956\u201358, and taught at Columbia University in 1960\u201362 and at the University of Z\u00fcrich in 1962\u201363. In 1963 he returned to Heidelberg, where he stayed most of his career, till his retirement in 1996. Dold's work in algebraic topology, in particular, his work on fixed-point theory has made him known in economics as well as mathematics. His book \"Lectures on Algebraic Topology\" is a standard reference among economists as well as mathematicians. He had 19 doctoral students, including M\u00f3nica Clapp, Eberhard Freitag, Volker Puppe, and Carl-Friedrich B\u00f6digheimer, as well as 58 descendants. Dold was married to Yvonne Dold-Samplonius, a distinguished historian of mathematics. ==References== * * * Category:1928 births Category:2011 deaths Category:20th-century German mathematicians Category:21st-century German mathematicians Category:Topologists Category:Heidelberg University alumni Category:Heidelberg University faculty Category:People from Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis ",
