On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has a 50% approval rating based on 6 reviews. Rupert Hawksley of The Daily Telegraph stated the premise \"is not a bad one at all\" but ultimately finds that the \"cast is wasted\" due to the writing, claiming that the \"jokes landed with all the grace of an injured pheasant.\" Brad Newsome of the Sydney Morning Herald described the series by saying, \"Rupert Grint, Nick Frost and Don Johnson are all very naughty boys in this dark but agreeably untaxing British comedy series.\" Barbara Ellen of The Guardian considered the \"performances are great and there are plenty of laughs in the escalating twists of surrealist failure.\" In an article by James Rampton for The Independent, it is characterized as \"dark, but silly as well. It's Breaking Bad meets Fawlty Towers,\" and \"cleverly fuses light and shade.\" In a review for Paste Magazine, LaToya Ferguson also writes that Sick Note has a \"pretty solid premise\" but the series is \"wildly uneven,\" it \"has a singular narrative and aesthetic vision, and it never once veers from that, no matter what\", continuing that the addition of Lohan to the second season \"doesn't read as an attempt to course-correct, it probably should've been,\" although her character \"meshes much better with the story as a whole. Especially, as she almost, sort of, but not quite solves the show's woman problem.\" ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! Year ! Award ! Category !
