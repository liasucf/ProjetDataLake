During June 1863 a government crisis broke out with armed conflicts between two different political factions, the so-called \"Mountain\" and \"Plain\" (after the homonymous factions of the French Revolution). Aristeidis\u2019 father, Konstantinos Kanaris, as well as his brother, Miltiadis, were prominent members of the Mountain. Lieutenant Aristedis Kanaris was ordered to go to the Palace in Athens as leader of a mixed force of the 1st, 2nd and 8th battalions of Infantry and a firemen force in order to strengthen the small Gendarmerie Force of the Palace that was loyal to the Government.\u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0388\u03b8\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, 1975, vol.13 (\u0399\u0393'), p. 228. On June 19, the conflict intensified when anti-government forces (loyal to Dimitrios Voulgaris) of artillery, infantry, gendarmerie and rural bandits who had sided with the opposition, moved to the Palace under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Dimitrios Papadiamantopoulos. This attack, although fierce, was repelled by the defenders under the command of Kanaris, who was killed by a bullet to his temple. A temporary truce allowed Miltiadis Kanaris to transfer Aristeidis\u2019 body to the house of their father in Plaka. During the funeral that was held the next day, riots were triggered when certain men of the Plain started to shoot. ==References== Category:1831 births Category:1863 deaths Category:Hellenic Army officers Category:Greek military personnel killed in action ",
