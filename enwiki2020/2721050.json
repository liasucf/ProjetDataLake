The Rajiv Gandhi Bridge connecting Pune to Ravet crosses the river at Aundh. The Harris Bridge crosses at Dapodi. New Holkar Bridge The Holkar bridge crosses the river near Khadki. Mula River from the west bankThe Sangam Bridge crosses the Mutha River at Sangamwadi, just before their merger. == Pollution and flooding == In 2010, areas surrounding the river experienced flash floods due to high levels of pollution and garbage dumped into the river. The College of Engineering, Pune (CoEP) holds an annual boating festival at the river near its premises. In 2012, it was found that the river was not navigable from Khadki to CoEP because the Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited had obstructed the flow of the river by constructing a mud path to lay a pipeline. In 2013, it was reported that there were dead fish in the river near Wakad. The Pimpri- Chinchwad Municipal Corporation did not determine pollution in the river as the cause. Due to high levels of pollution, including 125 MLD of untreated sewerage water being discharged into the river by the Pune Municipal Corporation, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has classified the water quality to be of Class-IV. In 2014, the Pune Police discovered that cannabis plants were being grown on the riverbed near Kharadi. == References == Category:Rivers of Maharashtra Category:Geography of Pune Category:Rivers of India ",
