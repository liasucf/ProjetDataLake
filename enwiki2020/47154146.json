She criticized the series for its attempts at serious romance in what was essentially a comedy, and also found fault with author's skill at drawing people. She was most heavily critical of the age gap between the two romantic leads, commenting that upon examination, \"First Love Monster comedy is overwhelmed by its creepy factor.\" She did, however, praise the series' dialogue, stating that \"the way Kanade talks is a fun mixture of childlike and more adult.\" ==References== ==External links== * at Aria * Anime official website * Category:Anime series based on manga Category:Funimation Category:Kodansha manga Category:Romantic comedy anime and manga Category:School life in anime and manga Category:Sh\u014djo manga Category:Yen Press titles ",
