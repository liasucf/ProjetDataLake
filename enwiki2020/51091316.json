    "text": "Blackass is a novel by Nigerian author A. Igoni Barrett. It was released in the United Kingdom and Nigeria in 2015, and 2016 in the United States. It received mixed reviews. ==Plot summary== The novel concerns Furo Wariboko, a Nigerian man, who wakes up one day to discover that he has become white. ==Reception== Reviewing Blackass in the Financial Times, Jon Day wrote: \"From the first sentence, Kafka\u2019s The Metamorphosis confronts you with the inherent strangeness of the pact you make when you read fiction. Gregor Samsa has become an insect, Kafka says. Suspend your disbelief. Take it or leave it. A Igoni Barrett\u2019s first novel \u2014 his third book \u2014 demands a similar response....to read him only as a Nigerian writer would be to do him a disservice. For Blackass is a strange, compelling novel, and Barrett has something to tell us all.\"Jon Day, \"\u2018Blackass\u2019, by A Igoni Barrett\" (review), Financial Times, 14 August 2015. Writing in The Guardian, Helon Habila said: \"Igoni Barrett\u2019s greatest asset is his ability to satirise the ridiculous extents people, especially Lagosians, go to in order to appear important.\"Helon Habila, \"Blackass by A Igoni Barrett review \u2013 a cocktail of Kafka and comedy\", The Guardian, 14 August 2015. Claire Fallon for the Huffington Post concluded: \"Blackass is a blunt, transparently written novel \u2014 the kind that makes the reader feel as though they\u2019re standing inside the skin of the character, going about his day with him \u2014 and though the topic could easily be that of a polemic, it\u2019s also a subtle, circumspect novel about the intersecting, sometimes mutually exclusive needs humans have for family and connection, and for status and power.\"Claire Fallon, \"The Bottom Line: \u2018Blackass\u2019 By A. Igoni Barrett\", HuffPost Arts and Culture, 4 March 2016. Aaron Bady of Okayafrica calls it \"the most unapologetically Nigerian book that American publishers have published in a long time, and as the 'Afropolitan' has become an increasingly omnipresent strand of contemporary African literature, there has been a steady backlash, both against the Afropolitan as such, and against the entire category of African immigrant literature.Aaron Bady, \"A. Igoni Barrett\u2019s \u201cBlackass\u201d And The Afropolitan Debate\", Okayafrica, 10 March 2016.
