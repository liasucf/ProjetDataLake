Noted as a monument historique, it is five metres high by two metres wide. Its designer's name is unknown. Thomas Becket visited Sens twice during his exile from England - once in 1164 to meet Pope Alexander III and once in 1170 just before returning to England. The window was granted the bay number 23 in the Corpus vitrearum medii aevi.
