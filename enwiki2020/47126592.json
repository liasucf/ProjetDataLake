The company built the 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) narrow-gauge line in 1903. The company built this narrow-gauge line in 1903 to carry cotton from cotton-rich interior areas of Vidarbha to the Murtajapur Junction on main broad gauge line to Mumbai from where it was shipped to Manchester in England. Murtajapur Junction was the focal point of this railway. In 1920 line from Darwha-Pusad was dismantled. Though, working autonomously, the CPRC was grouped in 1952 under the Central Railways. A ZD-steam engine, built in 1921 in Manchester, pulled the train for more than 70 long years after being put in service in 1923. It was withdrawn on 15 April 1994, and replaced by a diesel engine. == See also == * Shakuntala Express == Conversion to broad gauge == In 2016, Indian Railways announced that the Shakuntala Railway would be converted to broad gauge.Government to take over Shakuntala, only private railway line, convert to broad gauge ==References== Category:Vidarbha Category:2 ft 6 in gauge railways in India Category:Defunct railway companies of India * ",
