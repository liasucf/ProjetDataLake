Originally, from 1838 until 1865, the municipality encompassed roughly the same boundaries as the present- day municipality of Vennesla. The second iteration of the municipality was only and it corresponded to the central part of present-day Vennesla. The municipal centre was the village of Skarpengland. The small village of \u00d8vreb\u00f8 is located about west of Skarpengland, and this is where the \u00d8vreb\u00f8 Church is located. ==History== The parish of \u00d8vreb\u00f8 was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). It existed as a municipality until 1865, when it was dissolved and split into two: the southern part of the municipality (population: 1,103) became the new municipality of Vennesla and the remainder of the municipality became \u00d8vreb\u00f8 og H\u00e6geland (population: 1,829). On 1 July 1896 the municipality of \u00d8vreb\u00f8 was re-created when the municipality of \u00d8vreb\u00f8 og H\u00e6geland was divided into two separate municipalities: \u00d8vreb\u00f8 (population: 888) and H\u00e6geland (population: 843). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the Eikeland area (population: 39) of \u00d8vreb\u00f8 was transferred to neighboring Songdalen municipality, while the rest of \u00d8vreb\u00f8 (population: 925) was merged with H\u00e6geland and Vennesla to form a new, larger municipality of Vennesla. ==Name== \u00d8vreb\u00f8 municipality was named after the old \u00d8vreb\u00f8 farm (Old Norse: \u00d8frib\u0153r), since the first \u00d8vreb\u00f8 Church was built there. The first part of the name means \"upper\" and second part of the name is identical with the word b\u0153r which means \"farm\" and it is cognate with the Dutch language word \"boer\" which means \"farmer\". The name therefore means \"the upper farm\". ==See also== *List of former municipalities of Norway ==References== Category:Former municipalities of Norway Category:Vennesla ",
