    "text": "Current champions alt= The WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling world tag team championship contested in WWE on the SmackDown brand. Unveiled on the August 23, 2016 episode of SmackDown Live, it was created to be the counterpart title to the then-WWE Tag Team Championship, which became exclusive to Raw as a result of the 2016 WWE draft and was subsequently renamed to Raw Tag Team Championship. The championship is generally contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition. The inaugural champions were Heath Slater and Rhyno, who won the title in a tournament final at Backlash on September 11, 2016. The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) are the current champions in their first reign. As a result of the 2020 WWE Draft, previous champions The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) were drafted to Raw on Night 1 of the draft, while on Night 2 on October 12, The Street Profits - then reigning Raw Tag Team Champions - were drafted to SmackDown. Later that night to keep the branded championships on their respective brands, WWE official Adam Pearce had the two teams trade championships. Therefore, New Day became Raw Tag Team Champions, while The Street Profits became SmackDown Tag Team Champions. As of , , overall there have been 23 reigns between 14 teams composed of 26 individual champions, and one vacancy. The team of Heath Slater and Rhyno were the inaugural champions. The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) have the most reigns at seven (both as a team and individually), and also have the shortest reign at three days. The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) have the longest singular reign at 182 days for their third reign, and they have the longest combined reign at 380 days (379 days as recognized by WWE). The youngest champion is Jason Jordan, having won the title at 28 years old, while Shane McMahon is the oldest, having won it at age 49. == Reigns == == Combined reigns == As of , .
