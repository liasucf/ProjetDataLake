    "text": "The case of Irianna V.L. refers to the arrest, trial, conviction and reactions of PhD student Irianna V.L. for participating in the terrorist organization \"Conspiracy of Fire Nuclei\". Irianna V.L. was found innocent after she appealed. Because Irianna was found guilty based on insufficient DNA sample, the case hit the headlines. Another issue that also caused controversy was that the court took into consideration the social contacts and relations of Irianna, most notably a trip to Barcelona, a city that hosts many anarchists. Irianna's sentence of 13 years was met with skepticism as the principle of presumption of innocence was shaken. == Timeline == It was 2011 when Greek police was surveilling the house of a group of notorious anarchists, then suspects for links with \"Conspiracy of Fire Nuclei\". Irianna visited the specific place some times as those anarchists were friends of her boyfriend. After a police raid, Irianna gave a testimony to Greek police and voluntarily a DNA sample. In November 2011, arms were found in Polytechnic School of Athens, by accident, a small sample of DNA was spotted on them, below the threshold for reaching safe conclusion. In 2013, Irianna was arrested solely based on the tiny DNA sample found on the arms the police found in 2011. The issue was that the sample was so small that it was less that it was required by the law- so little that the sample was consumed for the first examination of the DNA and there was no left for cross-examination to validate the results. The first degree trial that followed, found Irianna guilty and sentenced her to 13 years in prison, based on the DNA sampling. In 2018, she was found not guilty by a second decree trial and was freed. === Concerns raised about the DNA sample in Irianna's case === *The DNA sample collected from the guns were 174pg when the required mass of DNA is legally defined as 200pg. *The two samples (from the guns and Irianna's) matched in 7 from total 16 sequences identified. *The European Ombudsman in 2008 (decision 2008/C 89/01) reported that because of false positive results in DNA matching, every sample should be cross examined at least once. == Criticism of the trial == The acceptance by the court of the DNA evidence has been widely criticized. Professor of the philosophy of Law at University of Athens, Aristides Hatzis, highlighted various police shortcomings regarding the DNA sampling, from collecting the sample to its interpretation, that should have led to the rejection of the DNA matching and hence Irianna should have been found not guilty. Hatzis also claimed that Irianna was punished by the police and the court for having an affair and social relations with anarchists- which constitutes a fundamental violation of the rule of law. Likewise, Gregoris Kalfetzis, professor of Law at AUTH raised his concern on the handling and interpretation of the DNA sample and noticed parallels between Irianna's case and the notorious Dreyfus affair- where the judiciary decision was predetermined before the trial and the evidence was manipulated to fit the decision. ==See also== *Anarchism in Greece *DNA profiling ==References== Category:Anarchism in Greece Category:Trials in Greece Category:2013 in Greece Category:Wrongful convictions ",
