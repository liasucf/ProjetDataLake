Some reasons for the latter are: * The loss of human life. * The environmental impact of oil spills, especially where large tanker ships are involved. * Financial consequences to local communities close to the accident. * The financial consequences to shipowners, due to ship loss or penalties. * Damage to coastal or off-shore infrastructure, for example collision with bridges. As sea lanes are getting more congested and ship speeds higher, there is a good possibility that a ship may experience an important accident during her lifetime. Higher speeds may cause larger operational loads, like slamming, or excessively severe loads, for example during a collision. Denser sea routes increase the probability of an accident\u2014in particular a collision\u2014involving ships or ships and shore or offshore structures. ==Collisions with wildlife== Large whales and species like sea turtles sear often suffer lethal wounds from collisions with ships (\"ship strikes\"). ==See also== *Vessel speed restrictions to reduce ship collisions with North Atlantic right whales *Ramming *List of ships sunk by icebergs ==References== Category:Maritime incidents ",
