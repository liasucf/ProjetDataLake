Reviewers praised it for being compact and comfortable to hold, its design, the clear and loud calls and the battery life, saying it can last a couple of days of heavy usage. User reviews saw the phone as being good as a first phone, but also did not like the storage space, the camera, the fact that it lacked a MP3 player, and its Bluetooth features. It was also considered to be easy to use, to be a good value for money, and have a good display. == References == Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2006 ",
