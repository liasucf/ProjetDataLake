    "text": "The Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts is one of the six academic units at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The College conducts research and provides higher education for undergraduate, master\u2019s, and doctoral degrees in liberal arts disciplines. The College strives to bridge the traditional separation between science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines and the humanities and social sciences. The College is named for former two-term Atlanta mayor Ivan Allen Jr., a Georgia Tech alumnus (Commerce, 1933) and advocate for the advancement of civil rights in America. ==History== === Early history === When the Georgia School of Technology opened in 1888, English was one of the six subjects taught at the time. The Department of Modern Languages was established in 1904. By 1908, the English Department was also teaching economic theory, general history, political economy, and physical geography. Two years of foreign language study were required for nearly all Georgia Tech majors. Departments of Economics and Social Sciences were established in 1934. These subjects were grouped into a formal school of liberal arts when, concurrent with the school's renaming as the Georgia Institute of Technology, the first two colleges were formed: the College of Engineering and the General College. In 1968, a new core curriculum was approved that included both humanities and social sciences. The History and Technology program was created in the Department of Social Sciences, with a (then) controversial use of engineering, science, and technology as a lens for history studies. Georgia Tech's first African American professor, William Peace, was hired in the college's Department of Social Sciences in 1968. The College awarded its first baccalaureate degree in Economics in 1971. In 1975, the General College was renamed the College of Science and Liberal Studies (COSALS) and the Master of Science degree in Technology and Science Policy was established. === Formation of the Ivan Allen College === In 1990, the College of Sciences and Liberal Studies was renamed the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy and International Affairs in honor of former Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. In addition to the three schools included in the new name, the reconfigured college also encompassed individual schools of History and Technology; Literature, Communication, and Culture; Modern Languages; Economics and Industrial Management, and Georgia Tech Reserve Officers' Training Corp (ROTC). In 1996, the School of International Affairs was renamed the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs in honor of the retiring U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, who joined the Ivan Allen College as a distinguished professor. In 1998, the School of Management (now the Ernest J. Scheller College of Business) was spun off into its own college. As a result, the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs was renamed the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, and its mission was redefined as encompassing liberal arts studies at Georgia Tech through the humanities and social sciences. In 1999, Sue Rosser was named dean of the Ivan Allen College, becoming the first woman named to an academic decanal post at Georgia Tech. === Modern Era === In 2004, the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts established the nation's first doctoral program in Digital Media within the School of Literature, Communication, and Culture. In 2008, the Ivan Allen College established a doctoral program in International Affairs, Science, and Technology within the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs. Jacqueline Royster was named dean of the Ivan Allen College in 2010, becoming the first African-American to hold an academic decanal post at Georgia Tech. In 2012, the School of Literature, Communication, and Culture was renamed the School of Literature, Media, and Communication (LMC). In 2015, the School of History, Technology, and Society was renamed the School of History and Sociology (HSOC). ==Schools== The Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts comprises six schools, offering ten Bachelor of Science degrees, eight Master of Science degrees, and six doctoral degrees. The College also hosts Georgia Tech's Army, Air Force, and Navy ROTC units.http://www.iac.gatech.edu/about-us/facts-and- statshttp://www.iac.gatech.edu/academics/schools * School of Economics * School of History and Sociology * Sam Nunn School of International Affairs * School of Literature, Media, and Communication * School of Modern Languages * School of Public Policy * Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC): Air Force ROTC, Army ROTC, and Navy ROTC === Reputation and rankings === In 2016, U.S. News and World Report ranked the School of Public Policy 2nd in its list of Best Graduate Schools in IT Management.
