The Evening Post 20 December 1889 Page 2 Most of the population, in Wadestown, amalgamated with Wellington City in 1907, the rest in 1919. ==Maintaining Hutt County's roads== Proceeds of all tolls are for Hutt County Council Onslow College 2007 A major incentive in the formation of the new borough was Hutt County Council's Kaiwarra toll gate set up where traffic moved between Wellington and Hutt County. Hutt County had imposed a tax on all traffic entering Wellington and their toll gate was on part of the proposed new borough's district. If the new Borough of Onslow were approved there could be no more tolls collected there by Hutt County.Boroughs and Toll Gates. Evening Post 8 March 1890 Page 2 Once the new borough was approved Hutt County did erect replacement toll gates in the Ngauranga Gorge and on the Hutt Road but these placements did not affect local Onslow and Wellington traffic to the same extent.The Tollgate Difficulty.

His name came from a township in the parish of Shrewsbury St. Chad, Shropshire. ==Merging== The difficulties of building adequate drainage for Wadestown within Onslow's boundaries, the subdivision of the Highland Park estate and the appeal to the residents of this very steep area of joining Wellington's tramway system led to Wadestown's amalgamation with Wellington City in April 1907.Municipal Consolidation.
