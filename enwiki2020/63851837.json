    "text": "East Peak is a glaciated mountain summit located in the Chugach Mountains, in the U.S. state of Alaska. The peak is situated east of Valdez, northeast of Mount Francis, and immediately north of Hogback Ridge. Although modest in elevation, relief is significant since the western aspect of the mountain rises up from tidewater of Prince William Sound in approximately six miles. The mountain received its descriptive name in 1898 from Captain William R. Abercrombie, who led an 1898 expedition seeking a route from coastal Alaska to the Klondike.Donald J. Orth, Dictionary of Alaska Place Names, 1967, page 299. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, East Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Weather fronts coming off the Gulf of Alaska are forced upwards by the Chugach Mountains (orographic lift), causing heavy precipitation in the form of rainfall and snowfall. Temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below \u221230 \u00b0C. This climate supports the Rubin, Keystone, and Camicia Glaciers, as well as smaller unnamed hanging glaciers surrounding the mountain. ==See also== *List of mountain peaks of Alaska *Geography of Alaska East Peak upper right, West Peak (left) ==References== ==External links== * Weather forecast: East Peak * East Peak: YouTube * Skiing video East Peak: Vimeo Category:Mountains of Alaska Category:Landforms of Valdez\u2013Cordova Census Area, Alaska ",
