The Centre was established in 2011 with core funding from the Australian Research Council (ARC), the Australian Government's main agency for allocating research funding to academics and researchers in Australian universities. The Centre of Excellence for the History of Emotions uses historical knowledge from medieval and early modern Europe to understand how societies have understood, experienced, expressed and performed emotions in pre-modern Europe, and how this long history impacts on contemporary Australia. == Organisational structure == The Centre's headquarters are based at the University of Western Australia in , Western Australia, Australia, with other nodes around Australia at the universities of Adelaide, Melbourne, New England, Queensland, and Sydney, at the Australian Catholic University, Macquarie University and Western Sydney University. The Centre has four programs: Meanings, Change, Performance, and Shaping the Modern. Its membership includes fourteen chief investigators, over 38 full-time postdoctoral fellows, 37 postgraduate students and more than 100 associate investigators at universities around Australia.

The Centre also has formal links with the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies (USA) and the University of York (UK). CHE hosted over 50 international academic visitors on short-term fellowship schemes, and attracted (and continues to attract) many more to its conferences and collaboratories each year, from postgraduates to professors, and the CHE collaborated on major international events in Germany, Italy, the UK, China, South Africa, the USA and Canada.
