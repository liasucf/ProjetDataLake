    "text": "NuTonomy (stylized as nuTonomy) is an MIT spin-off technology startup company that makes software to build self-driving cars and autonomous mobile robots. The company was founded in 2013. In August 2016, it launched its robo-taxi service (pilot project) in Singapore. ==History== NuTonomy began testing its software on cars in early 2016. One of the cars used to test its software included Mitsubishi i-MiEV. The product is still in research and development phase. In August 2016, it launched its autonomous taxi service using a fleet of 6 modified Renault Zoes and Mitsubishi i-MiEVs. NuTonomy later signed three significant partnerships to develop its technology and service: with Grab, with Groupe PSA, which is supposed to provide the company with Peugeot 3008 SUVs, and the last one with Lyft to launch a Robo-Taxi service in Boston. In October 2017, Delphi Automotive (now Aptiv) purchased the company. ==Technology== NuTonomy-fitted cars use \"formal logic\" to decide motion, maneuverability, and speed. The software guides a car on how to plan its motion through an environment. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Companies based in Massachusetts Category:Self-driving cars ",
