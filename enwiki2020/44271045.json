He has been referred to as a \"shadowy persona\". Al-Suwaydawi was a member of the Al-bu Swda clan of the Dulaim, the largest tribe in Iraq's Al Anbar Governorate. Al-Suwaydawi served under the Ba'athist regime of Saddam Hussein as a lieutenant colonel in the Iraqi Army. He also operated in Iraq's Air Defense Intelligence. According to Ahmed al-Dulaimi, the governor of Al Anbar Governorate, al-Suwaydawi graduated from the same military academy as future senior ISIL leaders Haji Bakr and Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi. An IS biography of Abu Muhannad al-Suwaydawi describes him as being \"especially close to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi and says, \"He and Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi were friends both in childhood and jihad\". According to the biography, Abu Muhannad was present at both the First Battle of Fallujah and the Second Battle of Fallujah during the occupation of Iraq. He was also responsible for planning the 2013 Abu Ghraib prison break. In 2007, al- Suwaydawi was detained by U.S. forces in Iraq at Camp Bucca. Following the deaths of Haji Bakr and al-Bilawi in 2014, al-Suwaydawi reportedly succeeded them as head of ISIL's military council. In November 2014, there were media reports that al-Iraqi had been killed in an Iraqi airstrike that reportedly also injured Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, however this was not confirmed at the time. In May 2015, ISIL carried out a wide-scale assault on Ramadi, capturing the city centre. The assault was named after al-Suwaydawi, who was described as having been killed in a US-led air strike. Jihadists frequently name their military offensives after fallen leaders. The Daily Beast reported that al- Suwaydawi was succeeded by senior ISIL figure Abu Ali al-Anbari. In October 2019, an article for the BBC claimed al-Iraqi was killed fighting on the front line in Syria by the Syrian Democratic Forces rather than a US airstrike. == References == Category:1965 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant members from Iraq Category:Iraqi Army officers Category:Prisoners and detainees of the United States military Category:Iraqi prisoners and detainees Category:Members of al-Qaeda in Iraq Category:Deaths by airstrike during the Iraqi Civil War ",
