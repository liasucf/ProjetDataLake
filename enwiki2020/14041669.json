WFAS broadcast 100 watts on a frequency of 1210 kHz from a T top antenna on the roof of the hotel. Prior to that, the station used the call sign WCOH when it was located in Yonkers (Westchester Broadcasting Corporation) and WBRS in Brooklyn (North American Broadcasting Corporation). WFAS had to share time on the 1210 kHz frequency with WBRB; Long Branch, New Jersey, WGBB; Freeport, New York and WGNY; Newburgh, New York. That was not an unusual arrangement in the early days of broadcasting when fewer frequencies were made available by the government. In 1941, in accordance with the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), the station moved to 1240 kHz and increased power to 250 watts, still sharing the frequency with two other stations. By March 1943, the station had moved to 1230 kHz on a full- time exclusive basis.FCC license file and application record, Application B1-ML-1073, March 9, 1943 In 1947, the transmitter site was moved to its current location on Secor Road in the Town of Greenburgh.FCC license file and application record, Application B1-P-4392, July 29, 1946 Concurrent with that move, 103.9 WFAS-FM signed on the air on August 1, from the same location.

Bruce Hall's Second Opinion hosted such events as the Westchester Golf Show and had recurring guests of Clarke Judge, San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy, and NFL Network contributor Russle Baxter.
