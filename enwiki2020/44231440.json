It premiered on Showtime on December 7, 2014. == Plot == Carrie (Claire Danes) and Saul (Mandy Patinkin) are pulled from the damaged van by the Marines, but John Redmond (Michael O'Keefe) didn't survive. Quinn (Rupert Friend) uses the radio to ask the Marines to return, but Taliban soldiers shoot from nearby buildings, pinning them down. Martha (Laila Robins), Dennis (Mark Moses), and Lockhart (Tracy Letts) hide in the vault, a secure lockdown room, with a package containing the names of all CIA informants in Pakistan. Haissam Haqqani (Numan Acar) and his Taliban soldiers arrive. They gun down many embassy personnel and keep the survivors as hostages. As Marines are hit around Carrie, she phones Col. Aasar Khan (Raza Jaffrey), asking him to send the Pakistani military. However, Tasneem Qureishi (Nimrat Kaur) reveals that the ISI is helping the Taliban, to Khan's disapproval. Tasneem asks Khan to delay the soldiers by 10 minutes. Quinn and a Marine succeed in killing some of the Taliban. Haqqani goes to the vault and demands it be opened and demands the package of informants. He executes several embassy personnel. Against Martha's wishes, Lockhart yields and opens the vault. The package is handed over. However, Haqqani executes Fara Sherazi (Nazanin Boniadi) regardless. Before he can execute the others, Quinn and the Marine open fire on the group; Haqqani is wounded but escapes. Carrie, Saul, and the bodies of Marines are brought back to the embassy by the Pakistani military. The White House cuts relations with Pakistan and prepares to evacuate the surviving embassy personnel. Dennis asks Martha for a belt to commit suicide with, in order to lower the impact on Martha's career, but he changes his mind. Max grieves over Fara's death.
