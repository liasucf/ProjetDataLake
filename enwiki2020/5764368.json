    "text": "Tiran Calvin Porter (born September 26, 1948) is an American bass and guitar player, vocalist and composer, best known as a member of The Doobie Brothers from 1972 to 1980 and 1987 to 1992. ==Biography== Porter graduated from Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, California in 1966. He rose to fame as a member of the Doobie Brothers, replacing bassist Dave Shogren on their second album Toulouse Street in 1972.Aronie, Dan - GuitarShowCase; accessed December 31, 2015. His vocals were mostly restricted to the background in the studio, although he wrote and sang \"For Someone Special\" (a tribute to ill bandleader Tom Johnston) on the album Takin' It To The Streets (1976) and the creatively syncopated \"Need A Lady\" on the album Livin' On The Fault Line (1977). In concert, Porter usually performed lead vocals on one or two songs. Porter's most notable contributions to the Doobie Brothers' sound were his busy and punchy bass lines; his distinctive tone permeates all of the band's classic compositions and hits. Often pictured with his trusty Alembic or Gibson basses during the seventies (usually with a Thunderbird or Ripper bass and earlier with an EB-0L), Porter played Fender instruments, most notably the Fender Jazz Bass, along with BC Rich Eagles and Rickenbackers. His early technique, with rich chordal attack, was based mostly on his picking style, favoring the guitar pick over fingerstyle playing. The hit title track from Takin' It to the Streets, which prominently features Porter's thundering, picked notes, is a prime example of this technique. More recently, even performing the old repertoire with the Doobies, Porter has been playing new, custom-made instruments almost exclusively finger style.Fox, Brian. Bass Player Magazine; accessed December 31, 2015. Porter left the Doobies in 1980, citing frustration with the hectic and constant touring schedule. His replacement was session man Willie Weeks, later famous for his collaboration with Michael Jackson and other Quincy Jones prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. After guesting onstage with his former bandmates briefly during the 1982 farewell tour, he rejoined the Doobies in 1987. Porter played on Cycles (1989), whose title was taken from an unused song he wrote,Liner notes from Playing To An Empty House and Brotherhood (1991). Neither album featured a Porter composition or lead vocal, and his bass is often buried in the mix. After five years of touring in support of Cycles and Brotherhood, Porter finally quit the Doobies for good in 1992. He was reportedly still frustrated with constant touring and the band's preference for recording familiar sounding material instead of his own, more diverse compositions. Porter released a self-produced solo album, Playing to an Empty House, in 1995. It is a mix of rock, progressive, and jazz spotlighting Porter on all of the instruments and vocals. The album features surprising jazz solos sculpted on exotic chord progressions. (Strangely, it features little or no bass guitar, focusing instead on lead guitar and sequenced keyboards.) Currently, Porter plays bass with singer song writer Keith Greeninger from Santa Cruz California who just released a new CD called Human Citizen. With beautiful lyrics and a tribute to our fallen soldiers. Porter use to play bass with California-based Beatles tribute band White Album Ensemble as well as Stormin' Norman and the Cyclones. He has toured with Moby Grape during its occasional partial reunions. ==Albums== ===Solo=== *Playing To An Empty House (1995) ===With the Doobie Brothers (incomplete)=== *Toulouse Street (1972) (US #21) *The Captain and Me (1973) (US #7) *What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits (1974) (US #4) *Stampede (1975) (US #4) *Takin' It to the Streets (1976) (US #8) *Livin' on the Fault Line (1977) (US #10) *Minute by Minute (1978) (US #1) *One Step Closer (1980) (US #3) *Cycles (1989) (US #17) *Brotherhood (1991) (US #82) *Live at the Greek Theater 1982 [Live] (2011) (guest appearance on one song) ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:American rock bass guitarists Category:American rock guitarists Category:American male bass guitarists Category:The Doobie Brothers members Category:African-American rock musicians Category:American rock singers Category:American funk bass guitarists Category:African-American male singers Category:American baritones Category:20th-century American bass guitarists Category:20th-century American male musicians ",
