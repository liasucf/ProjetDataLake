Baking mixes may be commercially manufactured or homemade. Baking mixes that cater to particular dietary needs, such as gluten- free baking mixes or kosher baking mixes, can be bought in many places. == Types == Baking mixes are produced for the preparation of specific foods such as breads, quick breads, pancakes, waffles, cakes, muffins, cookies, brownies pizza dough, biscuits and various desserts, among other foods. Some all- purpose baking mixes, including commercial and homemade varieties, can be used to prepare several types of baked goods, such as biscuits, pizza dough, muffins, cookies and pancakes, among others. Some bread baking mixes are formulated for use in a bread machine. Ingredients in baking mixes may include flour, bread flour, baking powder, baking soda, yeast, sugar and salt, as well as others depending upon the food type. Gluten-free baking mixes may be prepared using rice flour in place of wheat flour. Dry baking mixes typically require the addition of water or milk, and may also require additional ingredients such as eggs, butter and cooking oil. ==Size== Some baking mixes are sold in bulk volumes, and the baker measures out the amount needed. In other cases, the mix is sold pre-measured in a commonly desired size, such as enough baking mix to make a particular size of cake. Around 2012, most large American manufacturers of cake mixes reduced the size of their standard cake mixes by about 15% by weight, as a result of rising prices for ingredients. This resulted in complaints from some customers about the mix making smaller cakes or fewer cupcakes. Betty Crocker and Pillsbury mixes shrank from 18.25 ounces to 15.25 ounces. However, not all manufacturers followed this trend of reducing the amount to maintain the price; the King Arthur Flour Company, which makes premium-quality cake mixes, continued to produce 22-ounce cake mixes. ==Brands and companies== ===United States=== ====Brands==== Arrowhead Mills is a brand of organic baking mixes, cereals, grains and nut butters.

According to General Mills, Bisquick was invented in 1930 after one of their top sales executives met an innovative train dining car chef on a business trip. After the sales executive complimented the chef on his deliciously fresh biscuits, the dining car chef shared that he used a pre-mixed biscuit batter he created consisting of lard, flour, baking powder and salt. The chef then stored his pre-mixed biscuit batter on ice in his kitchen ahead of time, enabling him to bake fresh biscuits quickly on the train every day.
