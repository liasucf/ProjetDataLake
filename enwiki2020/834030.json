    "text": "An Assassin's Diary () is a book written by Arthur Bremer and Harding Lemay. It was released in 1973 which was based on part of the diary of Bremer, the would-be assassin of Alabama Governor George Wallace. Bremer shot Wallace at the Laurel Shopping Center in Laurel, Maryland, while Wallace was making his third campaign for President on May 15, 1972. In the book, Bremer says that he was not particularly opposed to Wallace's political agenda, which many had branded as white supremacist, but his primary motive was to become famous, and that he had also stalked President Richard Nixon. Paul Schrader was partly inspired by Bremer's diary when he wrote the screenplay for the 1976 film Taxi Driver, directed by Martin Scorsese. Peter Gabriel's 1980 song \"Family Snapshot,\" from Peter Gabriel (III) was inspired by An Assassin's Diary.Music Review: Peter Gabriel \u2013 Melt (1980) ==Reviews== In the essay \"The Art and Arts of E. Howard Hunt\", Gore Vidal assesses Bremer's writing style and notes the apparent contradiction between Bremer's lucid prose and his characterization as a person with a mediocre intellect. ==References== ==External links== *Portrait of an Assassin: Arthur Bremer, with quotes from his diary Category:1973 non-fiction books Category:Diaries Category:George Wallace ",
