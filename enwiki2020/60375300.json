    "text": "A diazaquinone is a chemical compound that has an heterocyclic aromatic core including two consecutive doubly-bonded nitrogen atoms , with the two carbon units adjacent to the nitrogens replaced by carbonyl (ketone) groups . These carbon and nitrogen atoms then comprise a diacyl diimide unit, . Two canonical examples are 3,6-pyridazinedione (a quinone of pyridine), emerald-green; and 1,4-phthalazinedione (a quinone of phthalazine) a green crystalline solid (both soluble in acetone and stable at -77 \u00b0C). The name was proposed by Thomas J. Kealy in 1962. ==References== Thomas J. Kealy (1962): \"The Chemistry of Diazaquinones: 3,6-Pyridazinedione and 1,4-Phthalazinedione\".
