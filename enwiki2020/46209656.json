    "text": "Dot Com Blues is a 2001 album by the American jazz organist Jimmy Smith. The album was Smith's first recording for five years, and features guest appearances by B.B. King and Etta James.Discogs accessed March 20, 2015 On the Billboard Top Jazz Album charts Dot Com Blues peaked at number 8. ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Roy Wynn awarded the album three stars and said that the album was \"...something of a blues sampler with Smith playing a prominent role rather than a Jimmy Smith album. Jazz fans will be happy to know that, after more than 40 years of recording, Smith retains his ability to play, but Dot Com Blues is anything but a showcase for the man whose name is on the cover.\" ==Track listing== #\"Only in It for the Money\" (Dr. John, Mac Rebennack) - 4:35 #\"8 Counts for Rita\" (Jimmy Smith) - 3:39 #\"Strut\" (Taj Mahal) - 5:03 #\"C.C.
