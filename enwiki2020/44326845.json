    "text": "Reynista\u00f0arklaustur (Reynistathir abbey) was a Catholic monastery in Iceland, belonging to the Order of Saint Benedict and active from 1295 until 1562, when it was closed down during the Icelandic Reformation It was one of nine monasteries on the island, and one out of only two to house nuns, the other one being Kirkjub\u00e6jar Abbey. Located in Skagafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, it fell under the authority of the Bishop of H\u00f3lar. When Jarl Gissur \u00deorvaldsson died in 1268, he donated his holdings in Reynista\u00f0ar to the Catholic Church, to house a religious community. It took three decades for this to happen, when finally Bishop J\u00f6rundur \u00deorsteinsson \u2013 together with Hallbera \u00deorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, later Abbess, and a number of other wealthy women \u2013 took the initiative to found the convent once and for all. Some of Hallbera's successors include Gu\u00f0n\u00fd Helgad\u00f3ttir, Oddbj\u00f6rg J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, Ingibj\u00f6rg \u00d6rn\u00f3lfsd\u00f3ttir, \u00de\u00f3runn Ormsd\u00f3ttir, \u00de\u00f3ra Finnsd\u00f3ttir, and Agnes J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir. The convent declined significantly during the Black Death, and for several years there was no Abbess present. The last Abbess of Reynista\u00f0arklaustur was Solveig Rafnsd\u00f3ttir. The monastery's lands and properties were confiscated during the introduction of Protestantism, causing Solveig to lose her authority. The last few nuns were allowed to remain for life in the defunct monastery. ==References== Category:Benedictine nunneries in Iceland Category:Christian monasteries established in the 13th century Category:1295 establishments in Europe Category:1562 disestablishments in Europe Category:13th-century establishments in Iceland Category:Monasteries dissolved under the Icelandic Reformation ",
