Like Ramsay Street?\" So I have those connections, but I got used to playing it after a while.

As the storyline progressed, Bridget was seen considering abortion or adoption, before ultimately deciding to have the child with Declan's support.

Steve and Miranda decide to take India with them to Oakey, but Declan decides to keep her and raise her by himself. On the day of India's first birthday, she chokes on a marshmallow and is rushed to the hospital. Declan is upset and worried about his daughter, but she is given the all clear. Paul Robinson pays for a private pediatrician to check her over and Rebecca tells Declan that Paul saved India's life.

Upon India's introduction, the Daily Record called her \"a screamer\" and said \"If her lungs are anything to go by, she's set for a great future as an opera singer.\" The paper said Bridget and Declan are left at their wits' end and cannot work out what is wrong with their daughter. They added \"What can be wrong with her? Nothing much, apart from a reluctance to ever take a nap.

A couple of weeks later, Amanda who is head of the Year 12 charity committee, is left outraged when she is outvoted over who should head the Debutante ball committee, with Kate getting the position. Amanda then goes to see Kate and suggests that she should resign, so they could have a second vote and Amanda could take over. Kate tells Amanda that she is not prepared to do that and Amanda realises that she cannot manipulate Kate easily.
