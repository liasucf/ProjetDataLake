Pillow fights often occur during children's sleepovers. Since pillows are usually soft, injuries rarely occur. The heft of a pillow can still knock a young person off balance, especially on a soft surface such as a bed, which is a common venue. In earlier eras, pillows would often break, shedding feathers throughout a room. Modern pillows tend to be stronger and are often filled with a solid block of artificial filling, so breakage occurs far less frequently. == Organized pillow fights == Pillow fighting has become a part of flash mob culture, with pillow fight flash mobs popping up in cities around the world. Social media is frequently used to initiate and advertise public pillow fight events. World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), occasionally staged \"pillow fight matches\" between female wrestlers, then known as Divas, during the early 2000's. These were often booked as Lingerie Pillow Fights, in which women \"compete\" in lingerie or pajamas, with little or no actual wrestling taking place. The final match of this type was held in 2008.

The rules called for \"no lewd behavior, and moves such as leg drops or tickling or submission holds are allowed as long as a pillow is used.\" The league ceased operations in 2011, and a crowdfunding campaign created to facilitate its return was unsuccessful. March 22, 2008, was the first World Pillow Fight Day, a day organized in the United States by Newmindspace, a group created by two University of Toronto students. The Wall Street Journal estimated that 5,000 people participated in a New York event coinciding with the day. The Guinness World Record for the largest pillow fight was set in July 2015 at a St. Paul Saints baseball game, where 6,261 participated in an event sponsored by local manufacturer My Pillow. The record was later broken in May 2018 at an evangelical Christian concert. 7,861 people participated in the Minneapolis, Minnesota event, which was also sponsored by My Pillow. == In Japan == In Makura-Nage, the Japanese Pillow fighting variation, players throw pillows instead of swinging them. ==In film== The 25 second long Pillow Fight From Edison Studios Pillow fights were a popular theme in early cinematography. 1897 saw the release of A Pillow Fight by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company followed by Pillow Fight from Edison Studios.
