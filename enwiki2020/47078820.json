    "text": "North Salt () is a barony in County Kildare, Ireland. ==Etymology== North Salt derives its name from the Latin name of Leixlip: Saltus salmonis (literally \"salmon leap\"; the English name is derived from Old Norse Lax-hlaup). This makes Salt one of very few Irish placenames derived directly from Latin. ==Location== North Salt barony is located in northeast County Kildare, north of the Liffey and east of the Lyreen, bordering on County Meath and County Dublin. ==History== The U\u00ed Gabla sept of the D\u00e1l Chormaic is noted early in North Salt. \u00d3 Gelbroin is found as a chief of Mag Life on the plains of the river Liffey here. There was originally a single Salt barony, divided into north and south baronies before 1807. ==List of settlements== Below is a list of settlements in North Salt: *Celbridge *Leixlip *Maynooth *Straffan ==References== Category:Baronies of County Kildare ",
