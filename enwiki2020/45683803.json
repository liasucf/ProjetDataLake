    "text": "James William Hanson (born 10 November 1995) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender or midfielder for League One club Oxford United. ==Club career== === Derby County === Hanson was a product of the Derby County academy with more than ten years at the club. He made his Football League debut for the Rams on 14 March 2015, starting against Norwich City in a 1\u20131 away draw at Carrow Road. In the 66th minute, with Derby 1\u20130 down, he swung in a corner kick and seemed to have scored the equalizing goal on his debut, but it was given as an own goal by Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy, who fumbled it over the line. Derby later appealed the decision with the Football League, and the goal was credited to Hanson on 19 March, meaning that he had scored for the club on his professional debut. He played one more match in the 2014\u201315 season, playing 70 minutes in a 1\u20130 home defeat to Middlesbrough on 17 March. Hanson played more regularly in the 2015\u201316 season; his first appearance coming on 15 August, playing 90 minutes in a 1\u20131 draw against Charlton Athletic, playing at the base of Derby's midfield three. He started again on 18 August against Middlesbrough but had to be withdrawn after 39 minutes because of injury. He missed the next match because of it, but returned for the following match, a 2\u20131 home defeat to Leeds United on 29 August. He signed a new three-year contract with Derby on 7 September and since then, he made five more league appearances, all of them as a substitute. ===Oxford United=== Hanson signed for Oxford United on 9 August 2018, for an undisclosed fee, on a four-year contract. He made his debut in a 4\u20131 away defeat at Portsmouth in League One, conceding a penalty that was saved by keeper Jonathan Mitchell. ==International career== On 19 March 2015, Hanson was named in the England under-20 squad for the first time, by manager Aidy Boothroyd, to face Mexico and the United States.\"England U20s squad named to face Mexico and USA\" The FA. 19 March 2015.
