It was held on a 257.4 kilometres (159.9 mi) course from Maastricht to Cauberg as the sixth event of the 2010 UCI ProTour and the tenth event in the UCI World Ranking series. The race was won by Philippe Gilbert, ending a 16-year wait for a Belgian victory in the race. == Teams == As the Amstel Gold Race is a UCI ProTour event, the 18 ProTour teams are automatically invited and obligated to send a squad. Six UCI Professional Continental teams round out the race's 24-team peloton.http://www.amstelgoldrace.nl/index.php?pageId=33 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Several riders who planned to compete in the race were unable to make it to Maastricht because of the colossal ash cloud formed by the eruption of the Icelandic Volcano Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, which grounded flights throughout Europe. The team most affected was Caisse d'Epargne, whose leaders Alejandro Valverde and Luis Le\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez, as well as several others, were all unable to make it to the race. They start the race with only Jos\u00e9 Vicente Garc\u00eda, Imanol Erviti and David L\u00f3pez available to ride instead of the customary eight riders, and needed special permission from the UCI to allow them such a small squad. Team Sky's Bradley Wiggins, Cerv\u00e9lo TestTeam captain Carlos Sastre, and the Team HTC-Columbia duo of Craig Lewis and Vicente Reyn\u00e8s, all of whom reside in Spain, were also unable to get to Maastricht in time for the race.http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/valverde-sanchez-miss- amstel-gold-due-to-volcano- eyjafjallajokullhttp://www.cyclingnews.com/news/sastre-out-of-amstel-due-to- volcano-eyjafjallajokull There was also talk that helicopters providing live images of the race would be grounded because of the ash cloud, but the race received special permission from the Dutch transportation minister for the helicopters to fly during the race.http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/amstel- broadcast-to-go-on-as-scheduled ==Result== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccccff;\" ! !Rider !Team !Time |- | align=center |1 | | | 6h 22' 54\" |- | align=center |2 | | | + 2\" |- | align=center |3 | | | + 2\" |- | align=center |4 | | | + 5\" |- | align=center |5 | | | + 5\" |- | align=center |6 | | | + 5\" |- | align=center |7 | | | + 7\" |- | align=center |8 | | | + 9\" |- | align=center |9 | | | + 11\" |- | align=center |10 | | | + 11\" |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Amstel Gold Race Amstel Gold Race Category:2010 UCI World Ranking Category:2010 in Dutch sport ",
