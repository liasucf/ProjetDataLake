    "text": "A white ethnostate is a proposed type of state in which residence or citizenship would be limited to white people and would exclude those viewed as non-whites such as Black people, non-White Hispanics, Jewish people, Muslims etc. In the United States, the idea to create such states is advanced by white supremacist/nationalist and white separatist factions such as Ku Klux Klansmen, neo-Nazis, white power skinheads and the alt-right whether through claiming a certain part or the whole of the country to have a white majority. Historically, Australia attempted to establish a whites-only state through restriction of non-white immigration and assimilation of Aborigines in its White Australia policy. Apartheid-era South Africa, attempted to do so by pushing non-white population in areas known as Bantustans, through various means including deportations and racial segregation, with the aim of establishing separate states out of the resulting ethnically cleansed areas, the largest of which would be a white state. ==Proposed white ethnostates== === North America === Historically as well as in modern times, the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and a portion of Montana) has been proposed by many white supremacists as a location for the establishment of a white ethnostate. This Northwest Territorial Imperative was promoted by Richard Girnt Butler, Robert Jay Mathews, David Lane and Harold Covington, the terrorist organization The Order, the neo-Nazi Christian Identity organization Aryan Nations, the white power skinhead Volksfront, and the Northwest Front, among others. The Northwest Territorial Imperative also has loose overlap with the Cascadia independence movement which also seeks to create an independent republic between the Northwest and parts of Northern California in the United States and British Columbia in Canada. Some in the far-right use the term American Redoubt to describe a similar migration to the Northwestern United States.https://www.inlander.com/Bloglander/archives/2018/04/26/does-this-anti- sodomite-slavery-defending-holocaust-denying-idaho-pastor-lead-a-hate-group Additionally other areas have looked into as sites for a potential white ethnostate by certain groups most notably the South and the self-proclaimed \"Southern Nationalist\" League of the South (LS) given the region's history of secessionism and once being an independent nation known as the Confederate States of America (1861-1865). Another example is Billy Roper's Shield Wall Network (SWN), a neo-Nazi organization located in Mountain View, Arkansas seeks to build a \"white ethnostate\" in the Ozark region and is affiliated with other separatist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) Knights Party located near Harrison, Arkansas, League of the South (LS) and National Socialist Movement (NSM) of the now defunct Nationalist Front.https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/shield-wall-network-swn Conversely, the Ozarks have been a \"hotbed\" for adherents of the Christian Identity movement including the Church of Israel and various members of the Christian Patriot movement who have set up paramilitary training camps to prepare for a coming Armageddon.https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/combating- hate/Gayman-Dan- EIA-1.pdfhttps://www.resist.com/Instauration/OtherPubs-20120723/SilentBrotherhood.pdf The defunct neo-Nazi organization Traditionalist Workers Party (TWP) led by Matthew Heimbach also sought to create a white ethnostate called \"Avalon\" built upon the ideological principles of Nazism, various strands of European fascism such as Legionarism and British Fascism and Eastern Orthodoxy. === South Africa === After the end of apartheid, some Afrikaner nationalist organizations, including Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, started to promote the idea of a Volkstaat that would be created in the Western Cape region. ==Historical attempts at creating a white ethnostate== ===South Africa=== During the apartheid era, the South African government, led by the National Party, attempted to turn South Africa into a whites-only state by forcing millions of black people to move to bantustans. Post-apartheid, some Afrikaner groups such as Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) and Afrikaner Volksfront have promoted the idea of a Volkstaat or a homeland for Afrikaners only. The town of Orania, Northern Cape is a manifestation of the Volkstaat idea. ===Australia=== For 72 years, from 1901 until 1973, Australia implemented a White Australia Policy to exclude people of non-European origin. ===United States=== In 2013, white supremacist Craig Cobb attempted to take over the small town of Leith, North Dakota, and turn it into a neo-Nazi enclave; this failed due to Cobb's violent behavior towards Leith residents, which got him arrested. The events form the basis of the documentary Welcome to Leith. The United States also had historical white nationalist ideas, in the form of the Naturalization Act of 1790 which would allow whites to apply for citizenship if they have lived in The United States for two years without breaking any laws. Non-White citizens as of The Johnson-Reed Act https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/immigration- act#:~:text=The%20Immigration%20Act%20of%201924%20limited%20the%20number%20of%20immigrants,of%20the%201890%20national%20census. in 1924 were allowed to immigrate to America following a quota of 2% of the number of people from their race living in America in 1890. The 1952 McCarren- Walter Act revised the former 1924 act and decreased the percentage of people coming into America. It also removed the ban on immigration from Asia.https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/immigration-act Discrimination in immigration only ended legally by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. ===Nazi Germany=== Adolf Hitler's plan was to create a Nordic/Aryan superstate that would rule over most of Europe and dominate its geopolitical landscape and eradicate everyone who was not considered \"pure\" by the Nazis. The objective of Nazi Germany was to turn a large part of central and eastern Europe into an \"Aryan\" homeland by cleansing its population through the genocide and mass deportation of non-Aryans such as Jews, Slavs (i.e. Poles, Russians, Serbs, Ukrainians), Roma/Gypsies, homosexuals, etc. ===Rhodesia=== In 1965, then prime-minister Ian Smith declared the independence of Rhodesia to prevent blacks from ruling the country and preserve white colonial culture. ==See also== *White nationalism *Ethnonationalism *Ethnocracy *White supremacy *Identitarianism *Fourteen Words *Fourth Reich == References == Category:Alt-right Category:White supremacy Category:Proposed countries ",
