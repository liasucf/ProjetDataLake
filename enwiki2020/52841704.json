The three of them met at the Sziget Theatre, where they had worked as actors for six years. They initially launched under the name \"The 3 Rock Tenors\". Their first song was a cover of Metallica's \"Nothing Else Matters\", which later successfully passed the qualification round of X-Faktor. Their mentor was P\u00e9ter Geszti. The band's first live broadcast in X-Faktor was with \"Bad\" by Michael Jackson. Mentors liked the majority of productions, with Mikl\u00f3s Malek saying \"Geszti and Rocktenors puts out rock\". They were ultimately successful in a duel based on viewers' votes with the Queen song \"The Show Must Go On\" song against Tibor Gyurcs\u00edk. Gyurcs\u00edk was voted against by Geszti, while Malek and Ildik\u00f3 Keresztes voted against the Rocktenors. In the second round of X-Faktor, they played a 300-year old Adagio. They then, on the third day, played Rolling Stones' \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". For Fer\u00f3 and Keresztes, while there was too much choreography, the rock was held and urged them to safely undertake themselves because they did not need others to imitate like a parody. The band's duel against Ikrek with the Queen song \"Who Wants To Live Forever\", which was won once again voted by judges. Malek said the team duel was \"overwhelmingly well-sung.\" On the fourth day, Rocktenors sang the Northern Kings cover of the A-ha song \"Take On Me\". Again, they were dueling position, this time by the mentor of the other team, Apollo23. The band sang \"Always\" by Bon Jovi. Geszti and Keresztes voted against the Rocktenors, while Malek and Fer\u00f3 voted against Apollo23, tying the vote. The viewers' votes surprisingly fell out of the Apollo23. In the fifth round, they performed \"Don't Cry\" by Guns N' Roses and was unanimously beloved by the mentors and the spectators. At the sixth round, they then performed the Santana & Chad Kroeger song \"Into The Night\", which successfully passed again, this time in the top 6th On the seventh live show, they sang Fec\u00f3 Bal\u00e1zss' \"Homok a sz\u00e9lben\". The performance was well received by the jury, with Malek saying that \"It was the best I've ever been on the show.\" In their final show, the team lost the duel against Tamvs Tar\u00e1ny when they sang Aerosmith's \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\".
