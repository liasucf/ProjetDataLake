    "text": "My Talking Tom is a virtual pet app released by Slovenian studio Outfit7 in November 2013. It is similar to Pou and the fourteenth app of the Talking Tom and Friends series overall. A similar app called My Talking Angela was released on December 3, 2014. Another similar app called My Talking Hank was released on December 2, 2016. A sequel, My Talking Tom 2, was released on November 3, 2018. Yet another similar app called My Talking Tom Friends was released on June 11, 2020. ==Gameplay== The goal of the game is to take care of an anthropomorphic cat called Tom (who can optionally be renamed by the player). The player is invited to care for \"Tom\" and help him grow from a baby kitten to a full-grown tomcat by interacting with him in different ways, such as feeding him, taking him to the bathroom, playing mini games, and tucking him into his bed to sleep when he is tired. Tom can repeat words spoken into the device's microphone for up to 25 seconds using a synthesized voice. Through in-app purchases, in-game currency, or by logging into Facebook, there is an option to visit Tom's friends, or travel around the world. Using in-game currency, various different outfits, skins, and accessories can be purchased to dress-up and customize Tom. == Age Inappropriate Advertising Controversy == The app was reported for having advertised age-inappropriate advertisements for adult services. In 2015, the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that advertising for an adult web site was delivered to underage children via the app. The ASA noted that Outfit7 \"had a strict advertising policy\" but that the company \"had not been able to identify which ad network had served an age-inappropriate ad on a children\u2019s app\" and how the advertisements were shown in the app. ==Awards== * \"Best iPad Game: Kids, Education & Family\" at the 2014 Tabby Awards. * \"Best iPad Game: Kids, Education & Family\" and \"Best Android Game: Puzzle, Cards & Family\". ==See also== * Talking Tom * Talking Tom (character) ==References== Category:2013 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Outfit7 games Category:Virtual pet video games Category:Video games about animals Category:Fictional cats Category:Video games developed in Slovenia Category:Windows Phone games Category:Anthropomorphic cats Category:Talking Tom and Friends Category:Unity (game engine) games ",
