When he took reign of U.C. Sampdoria next, Sampdoria was supposed to play on the second level Serie B. However, due to a scandal and penalties on other teams, Sampdoria kept their Serie A spot. With the roster already assembled for Serie B, Sampdoria had to fight hard to avoid relegation. After the season, he was hired by S.S. Lazio, but was fired after just 8 games in the next season in which Lazio gained only 5 points and were second from the bottom. Next he was hired by A.C. Cesena, who qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time in their history. Cesena was knocked out of the cup in the first round and he was fired again.
