With a capacity of 20,724 seats, it is the 24th-largest stadium in Spain and the 5th- largest in Andalusia. ==History== The stadium was inaugurated 3 September 1955. A month earlier on 6 August the national flag was raised at the stadium in the presence of Jos\u00e9 Le\u00f3n de Carranza (mayor of the city), Cazalla Morales (responsible for the work), the architects in charge (Mu\u00f1oz Monasterio and Fern\u00e1ndez Pujol) and the president and the vice president of C\u00e1diz CF (Juan Ram\u00f3n Cilleruelo Montero and Rafael Garc\u00eda Serrano). With a total of 15,000 spectators, the stadium built with an oval shape included a 400-metre athletics track between the pitch and the stands. The inaugural match was played against FC Barcelona, that ended in a loss of 0\u20134. With two goals from Villaverde, then Luis Su\u00e1rez then a final goal from Kubala. The first rebuilding of the stadium took place in 1984, over the course of 4 months the main stand was demolished and rebuilt and the other stands were redesigned, at the same time the athletics track was removed and the pitch was moved closer to the stands. The rebuilt stadium included a roof over the main stand. The stadium capacity after the first rebuilding was 23,000. On 8 February 2002, the mayor of the city, Te\u00f3fila Mart\u00ednez, presented the first real project for the New Carranza. One of its key points was the enlargement of the commercial areas in the stadium, which total surface was estimated at 5,000 square meter. The second rebuilding of the stadium took place between 2003 and 2012 when all four stands were demolished and rebuilt starting with the south stand (Fondo Sur) and the east stand (Preferente) between 2003 and 2005. Then the north stand (Fondo Norte) was rebuilt between 2006 and 2008. The last stand to be rebuilt was the main stand (Tribuna) which is the largest one with 8,281 seats and thus far the only one with a roof, the construction took place between 2009 and 2012. The new stadium with a total capacity of 20,724 spectators has a total built up area of 94,938 square metres, it includes 31,555 m of underground parking for around 900 cars under the four stands, commercial areas located throughout the stadium totaling 23,349 m, and 28,714 m are used for a hotel located in the main stand. The total cost of the rebuilding was \u20ac68 million, all paid for with public funds.
