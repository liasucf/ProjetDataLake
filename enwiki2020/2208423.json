During his early years Hal must work as a casual laborer. His dream is to fly dragons, so he joins a traveling troupe who give rides on dragons as entertainment from town to town. Hal is away from his home country and his king, Asir. When war breaks out, he is drafted into the army as an unwilling soldier. However, he does his best and works his way through the ranks of the army and society with his heroic exploits. Dragons are mainly wild and untamed creatures that are brought into the war, while Hal and others devise new and more damaging ways to use the dragons against their enemies. This tale is told in the first two books, which contain bloody action throughout. The third book covers life after the war, the difficulties ex- soldiers face, and how Hal deals with it. ====The Last Legion==== * The Last Legion (1999) () * Firemask (2000) () * Storm Force (2000) () * Homefall (2001) () ====Shadow Warrior==== * Shadow Warrior: The Wind After Time (1996) () * Shadow Warrior: Hunt the Heavens (1996) () * Shadow Warrior: Darkness of God (1997) () ====Star Risk Series==== * Star Risk, Ltd.

While the main attraction of the series was the action and understated humor, the series was actually a political critique. It had seemed to Bunch and Cole that entirely too many science fiction authors were enamored with monarchies and their consequent fascist (although benevolent) ideals. They wanted to write a series to show the realities of politics and power and to place a working- class man into this series, letting the reader see through his eyes and watch as he grows to be a real and realistic hero. # Sten (1982) () # The Wolf Worlds (1984) () # The Court of a Thousand Suns (1985) () # Fleet of the Damned (1988) () # Revenge of the Damned (1989) () # The Return of the Emperor (1990) () # Vortex (1992) () # Empire's End (1993) () ====Anteros==== * The Far Kingdoms (1985) () * The Warrior's Tale (1994) () * Kingdoms of the Night (1995) () ====Novels==== * A Reckoning for Kings (1987) () ==See also== * ==Notes== ==External links== * * Interview at SFFWorld.com * Category:1943 births Category:2005 deaths Category:20th-century American novelists Category:21st-century American novelists Category:American fantasy writers Category:American male novelists Category:American science fiction writers Category:United States Army personnel Category:Writers from Fresno, California Category:20th-century American male writers Category:21st-century American male writers Category:People from Ilwaco, Washington ",
