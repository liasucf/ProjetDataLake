    "text": "The Bedlam Series is the name given to the Oklahoma\u2013Oklahoma State rivalry. It refers to the athletics rivalry between Oklahoma State University Cowboys and Cowgirls and the University of Oklahoma Sooners of the Big 12 Conference. Both schools were also members of the Big Eight Conference before the formation of the Big 12 Conference in 1996, and both were divisional rivals in the Big 12 South Division prior to 2011. The Bedlam Series is, like most other intrastate rivalries, a rivalry that goes beyond one or two sports. Both schools also have rivalries with other schools, though most of those rivalries are limited to one or two sports at the most. The rivalry is all the more intense since their games often decide the conference championship. While the football and basketball games stand today as the marquee events in the Bedlam Series, the term \"Bedlam\" actually began with the rivalry between the schools' prestigious wrestling programs, more particularly the raucous crowds that attended the matches held at Oklahoma State's Gallagher-Iba Arena. ==Football== The original Bedlam Series logo. The first Bedlam football game was held at Island Park, now known as Mineral Wells Park, in Guthrie, Oklahoma. It was a cold, and very windy day with the temperatures well below the freezing mark. At one moment in the game when the Oklahoma A&M; Aggies were punting, the wind carried the ball backwards behind the kicker. If the Oklahoma A&M; squad recovered the ball it would be a touchback and if the University of Oklahoma squad recovered it, it would be a touchdown. The ball rolled down a hill into the half-frozen creek. Since a touchdown was at stake, members of both teams dove into the icy waters to recover the ball. A member of the OU team came out with the ball and downed it for a touchdown. OU won the game, 75\u20130. In 2007, author Steve Budin, whose father was a New York bookie, publicized the claim that the 1954 Bedlam Game was fixed by mobsters in his book Bets, Drugs, and Rock & Roll (). Allegedly, the mobsters threatened and paid off a cook to slip laxatives into a soup eaten by many OU Sooner starting players, causing them to fall violently ill in the days leading up to the game. OU was victorious in the end, but their 14\u20130 win did not cover the 20-point spread they had in their favor. However, many people involved in the 1954 contest do not recall any incident like the one purported by Budin to have occurred. Nor do any of the pregame and postgame newspaper articles mention any such condition. One possible reason for the Sooners' lackluster performance, according to one coach, was that the players were \"beat up\" from the previous game against Nebraska. Since it started in 1904, Bedlam is now the 4th-longest continuously-played rivalry in FBS (Division 1) college football. Because it is uninterrupted since 1910, it is also now the single longest uninterrupted rivalry, between two public universities, in the same state, that have a game named \"University of _ vs. _ State University.\" ===Game results=== ==Men's basketball== Oklahoma owns the all-time series record in men's basketball, 140\u2013100, and have won 22 of the last 34 meetings. The Sooners swept the Cowboys in 2018-2019, giving Oklahoma its seventh Bedlam sweep since 2006, including 2013\u201314, 2014\u201315 and 2015\u201316 regular season Bedlam series. Oklahoma State has swept just once in that span, in 2017. ==Wrestling== Oklahoma State holds a lopsided advantage in the schools' wrestling rivalry, the original \"Bedlam Series.\" The Cowboy wrestling program currently holds a 141\u201327\u201310 record against the Sooners, which is all the more remarkable considering that both schools have long been national powers in wrestling. Oklahoma has won seven team national championships in its history, while Oklahoma State's wrestling program has a record thirty-four team national titles. ==See also== * List of NCAA college football rivalry games * List of most-played college football series in NCAA Division I ==References== ==External links== * Bedlam Series at OKState.com * Bedlam Series at SoonerSports.com *Voices of Oklahoma interview with Bob Barry Sr. First person interview conducted on March 31, 2011, with Bob Barry Sr. Original audio and transcript archived with Voices of Oklahoma oral history project.
