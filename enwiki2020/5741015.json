    "text": "The Battle of V\u00e9zeronce took place on June 25, 524 near V\u00e9zeronce-Curtin (then Veseruntia) in Is\u00e8re, France. This battle was part of an invasion of Burgundy initiated by the four successors of the Frankish king Clovis I: Childebert I, Chlodomer, Chlothar I, and Theuderic I. The previous Burgundian king Sigismund had been executed by the Franks, and was succeeded by his brother Godomar. Godomar led the Burgundian army and inflicted a severe defeat on the Franks, with Chlodomer killed during the fighting. However, the defeat of the Franks was only temporary and the kingdom was lost to the Merovingians within a decade. A helmet was found in the peat marsh of Saint-Didier, to the north of the battle site in 1871 and is conserved in the Mus\u00e9e dauphinois, Grenoble. The helmet is of Byzantine craftsmanship and was probably that of a Frankish chieftain. ==External links== *Collections Arch\u00e9ologie at the Mus\u00e9e dauphinois website. *The Conversion of Clovis at the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica website. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:524 Category:520s conflicts Vezeronce Vezeronce Vezeronce Vezeronce Category:Battles in Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Category:6th century in France Category:Is\u00e8re Category:6th century in Francia ",
