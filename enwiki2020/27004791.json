He was wounded in action fighting No. 1 Squadron RNAS on 14 August, and again on 23 November in combat against No. 56 Squadron RFC. On 18 March 1918, Wolff shot down and killed his first victim, which was possibly Lt. John McCudden. Wolff then steadily scored for the next two months, downing his tenth victim on 15 May 1918. He and his Fokker Dr.I were shot down the following day, most probably by Lt. Horace Barton of No. 24 Squadron RAF. He's the only German pilot who scored all of his victories in the Fokker Dr.I. ==Sources of information== ==References== Above the Lines: The Aces and Fighter Units of the German Air Service, Naval Air Service and Flanders Marine Corps 1914 - 1918 Norman L.
