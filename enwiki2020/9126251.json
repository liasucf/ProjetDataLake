A member of the Mavrokordatoi, one of the most famous Phanariote families (although her exact relationship to the family is unclear), she was raised in Constantinople, where she was given a good education. After two unhappy marriages, she became the first woman in Greece to start a salon in Athens.Jennifer S. Uglow : The Macmillan dictionary of women's biography (1982) Although Greece was under Ottoman rule, it was not as isolated as other regions in the Balkans, and enjoyed a close contact with the cultural developments of Western Europe.
