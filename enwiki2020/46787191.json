    "text": "Frederick W. Dawes (2 May 1911 \u2013 12 August 1989) was an English retired professional footballer who played in the Football League for Northampton Town and Crystal Palace as a defender. He also managed Crystal Palace and was the younger brother of Albert Dawes, who also played professionally for Crystal Palace and Northampton. ==Playing career== Dawes began his youth career with Aldershot and, in 1929, signed for Northampton Town, where his older brother Albert was also a player. Between then and 1936, Dawes made 162 League appearances for the club, scoring once. In February 1936, Dawes signed for Crystal Palace, once again re-joining his older brother who had moved to Palace in 1933, and immediately established himself in the side being ever- present for the remainder of that season and throughout the 1936\u201337 season. Dawes went on to make a total of 223 Football League appearances for Palace before being forced to retire as a player, through injury, during the 1949\u201350 season. Dawes career was notable in that he completed a century of appearances for Crystal Palace either side of World War II. ==Managerial career== After retiring as a player, Dawes was appointed as assistant to then Crystal Palace manager Ronnie Rooke. Despite a reasonably successful 1949\u201350 season and a number of close-season signings, the club had a very poor start to the 1950\u201351 season. In November 1950, Rooke was relieved of his position and Dawes was appointed as joint-manager, together with chief scout Charlie Slade. However, the partnership was unable to improve upon the season start and the club had to seek re-election in 1951. The 1951\u201352 season also began poorly and Dawes and Slade were dismissed in October. ==Later career== Dawes was reinstated as an amateur by the Football Association after leaving Crystal Palace and went on to play for Beckenham Town. After leaving football altogether, Dawes became a shopkeeper. Fred Dawes died on 12 August 1989 in Shirley, Surrey, aged 78. ==References== ==External links== * * Fred Dawes at holmesdale.net Category:1911 births Category:1989 deaths Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:English Football League players Category:Aldershot F.C. players Category:Northampton Town F.C. players Category:Crystal Palace F.C. players Category:Beckenham Town F.C. players Category:Crystal Palace F.C. managers Category:Brentford F.C. wartime guest players Category:English football managers ",
