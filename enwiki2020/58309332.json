This has resulted in five concert tours (three of them worldwide), and a lot of TV and award shows performances. Since her musical debut in 2006 thanks to the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana (2006-2011) she has been promoting all of her albums as well as her debut one Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus, in 2007 and 2008, through performances at several festivals including the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. Following the Hannah Montana series, Cyrus embarked through 2007 and 2008 on her debut concert tour, the Best of Both Worlds Tour, which only visited North America and grossed over $54 million. In March 2009 Cyrus released the soundtrack of her first headlining theatre movie Hannah Montana: The Movie. Later that year she embarked on her first world tour and second in general named Wonder World Tour which visited North America and the United Kingdom and Ireland where she promoted her second studio album Breakout (2008) as well as her first EP The Time of Our Lives released in August 2009. Cyrus' next tour was named Gypsy Heart Tour which began in April 2011 and ended in July 2011 visiting Latin America and Oceania. The tour ranked 22nd in Pollstar's \"Top 50 Worldwide Tours (Mid-Year)\", earning over $26 million. Cyrus made this stattment about the tour: \"The Gypsy Heart tour is a dream come true. Not only because of all the beautiful cities I will get to visit, but all of the beautiful people I will get to meet. Gypsy Heart is not just a tour for me, but a mission to spread love\". In October 2013 Cyrus announced on Saturday Night Live her fourth concert tour named Bangerz Tour in support of her 2013 album Bangerz. The tour began in Vancouver in February 2014 and ended in late October in Australia. It was the 16th highest-grossing tour of 2014, earning $62.9 million. Footage from the shows at Barcelona and Lisbon was filmed, airing on NBC on July 6, 2014. It was then released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 24, 2015. At the end of the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards celebrated at The Forum on August 30, 2015 which Cyrus hosted, she announced that her fifth studio album Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz was available for free online streaming. The album was self-published. In April 2017, the album was officially uploaded to iTunes and paid music subscription services like Apple Music and Spotify, after only being available for free on SoundCloud for almost 2 years. Cyrus embarked on an eight-concert tour in support of the album in the end of 2015. On December 19, 2015, go90 live streamed Cyrus' Los Angeles show, the farewell night of the tour. Cyrus' sixth studio album Younger Now was released in September 2017. To promote the album, the singer attended The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon for a whole week. No tour in support of the album has been booked or announced yet. == Concert Tours == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\" ! scope=\"col\" |Title ! scope=\"col\" width=\"14%\" |Dates ! scope=\"col\" |Associated album(s) ! scope=\"col\" |Continent(s) ! scope=\"col\" |Shows ! scope=\"col\" |Gross ! scope=\"col\" |Attendance ! scope=\"col\" width=\"2%\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" |The Party's Just Begun Tour (The Cheetah Girls Tour) | \u2013 March 4, 2007 |Hannah Montana | North America |22 | | | |- class=\"expand-child\" | colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom-width:3px; padding:5px;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" |Best of Both Worlds Tour | \u2013 January 31, 2008 |Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus | North America |70 |$54,000,000 | +300,000 | |- class=\"expand-child\" | colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom- width:3px; padding:5px;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" |Wonder World Tour | \u2013 December 29, 2009 |Breakout The Time of Our Lives |North America Europe |56 |$66,941,255 |807,514 | |- class=\"expand-child\" | colspan=\"8\" style=\"border- bottom-width:3px; padding:5px;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" |Gypsy Heart Tour | \u2013 July 2, 2011 |Can't Be Tamed |Latin America Philippines Oceania |21 |$26,000,000 |289,441 | |- class=\"expand-child\" | colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom- width:3px; padding:5px;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" |Bangerz Tour |February 14, 2014 \u2013 October 23, 2014 |Bangerz |North America Europe South America Oceania |78 |$62,900,000 | +620,000 | |- class=\"expand-child\" | colspan=\"8\" style=\"border- bottom-width:3px; padding:5px;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" |Milky Milky Milk Tour |November 19, 2015 \u2013 December 19, 2015 |Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz | North America |8 | | | |- class=\"expand-child\" | colspan=\"8\" style=\"border-bottom- width:3px; padding:5px;\" | |} == Live performances == === Hannah Montana era === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" ! style=\"width:12%;\" |Date ! style=\"width:20%;\" |Event ! style=\"width:12%;\" |City !Performed song(s) |- |September 1, 2005 ! scope=\"row\" |Hannah Montana season 1 concert |Glendale, California | |- |June 22, 2006 ! scope=\"row\" |Hannah Montana - In Concert at Disney's Typhoon Lagoon |Orlando | |- |July 22, 2006 ! scope=\"row\" |Radio Disney's Totally 10 Birthday Concert |Anaheim | |- |August 2, 2006 ! scope=\"row\" |Hollywood Radio & Television Society Kids Day 2006 |Los Angeles | |- |October 23, 2006 ! scope=\"row\" |Good Morning America |New York City | |- |October 24, 2006 ! scope=\"row\" |Live with Regis and Kelly |New York City |\"I Got Nerve\" |- |November 11, 2006 ! scope=\"row\" |Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade |Orlando |\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\" |- |November 23, 2006 ! scope=\"row\" |Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade |New York City |\"The Best of Both Worlds\" |- |- |} === Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus era === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" ! style=\"width:12%;\" |Date ! style=\"width:20%;\" |Event ! style=\"width:12%;\" |City !Performed song(s) |- | ! scope=\"row\" |Hannah Montana season 2 concert | | |- |March 28, 2007 ! scope=\"row\" |Hannah Montana: Live in London |London | |- |April 8, 2007 ! scope=\"row\" |White House Easter Egg Roll |Washington, D.C. | |- |April 27, 2007 ! scope=\"row\" |Disney Channel Games 2007 |Orlando | |- |June 22, 2007 ! scope=\"row\" |Good Morning America |New York City | |- |June 26, 2007 ! scope=\"row\" |Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus Release Party |Hollywood | |- |October 9, 2007 ! scope=\"row\" |Dancing with the Stars |Los Angeles |\"Ready, Set, Don't Go\" (with Billy Ray Cyrus) |- |November 18, 2007 ! scope=\"row\" |Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade |Anaheim |\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" |- |November 21, 2007 ! scope=\"row\" |The Oprah Winfrey Show |Chicago |\"The Best of Both Worlds\" |- |December 20, 2007 ! scope=\"row\" |The Oprah Winfrey Show |Chicago | |- |December 31, 2007 ! scope=\"row\" |Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve |New York City | |- |February, 27, 2008 ! scope=\"row\" |The Tonight Show with Jay Leno |Burbank |\"Ready, Set, Don't Go\" (with Billy Ray Cyrus) |- |March 9, 2008 ! scope=\"row\" |Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo |Houston |Best of Both Worlds Tour setlist |- |March 29, 2008 ! scope=\"row\" |2008 Kids' Choice Awards |Los Angeles |\"G.N.O.
