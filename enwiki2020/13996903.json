Originally elected as a Co-operative Commonwealth Federation MP in the 1953 election, he became part of the New Democratic Party (NDP) caucus in 1961. Regier resigned his House seat on August 20, 1962 so that federal NDP leader Tommy Douglas could contest a safe seat in a by- election. He then stood as the NDP's candidate in Fraser Valley in the 1963 election, in Algoma West in the 1965 election and in Prince George\u2014Peace River in the 1968 election, but was not re-elected to the House in any of the later elections. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1916 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Canadian Mennonites Category:Co-operative Commonwealth Federation MPs Category:20th-century Canadian politicians Category:New Democratic Party MPs Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from British Columbia Category:University of British Columbia alumni ",
