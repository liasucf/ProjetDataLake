    "text": "The Bad Plus Joshua Redman is a 2015 album by jazz trio The Bad Plus and saxophonist Joshua Redman. The album was reviewed by seven critics on Metacritic and scored 84%, which means universal acclaim. ==Background== The record is the group's eleventh studio album and the first one in collaboration with Joshua Redman. It only contains original compositions, except for \"Dirty Blonde\" and \"Silence is the Question\" which already appeared on previous albums. ==Reception== Evan Haga of JazzTimes wrote \" The album includes nine tracks, including two compositions apiece by Redman and pianist Ethan Iverson, four by bassist Reid Anderson (including two pieces previously recorded by TBP) and one by drummer Dave King. There are none of TBP\u2019s calling-card deconstructions of pop hits, and you don\u2019t miss them; the original music is excellent and wide-ranging and deftly arranged, in a way that underscores both the trio\u2019s affinity for composition and the fresher, more noticeably improvised terrain that Redman\u2019s presence opens up\". Nate Chinen of The New York Times mentioned, \"As a chemistry experiment, the album is a knockout.\" Michael Ullman of The Arts Fuse wrote \"One of the longest lasting small groups in jazz, The Bad Plus is also one of the most creatively satisfying. With the galvanic addition of Redman, the ensemble is now made up of four intense virtuosos whose musical intelligence is as impeccable as their instrumental chops. They write exquisitely crafted originals in a startling range of styles. Sometimes they do the seemingly impossible (their \u201cRite of Spring\u201d) or indulge in re-workings of Pink Floyd\". Jon Garelick of The Boston Globe mentioned \"Having covered Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cIron Man,\u201d Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cRite of Spring,\u201d and, most recently, Ornette Coleman\u2019s epochal \u201cScience Fiction,\u201d piano trio the Bad Plus returns to its own intricate explorations of song form and improvisation\". Mike Hobart of Financial Times commented, \"Here, saxophonist Joshua Redman adds much-needed heft and brings the best out of drummer Dave King and pianist Ethan Iverson, transforming a somewhat derivative repertoire into an appealing personal statement.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Reid Anderson \u2013 bass *Ethan Iverson \u2013 piano *David King \u2013 drums *Joshua Redman \u2013 saxophone ==References== ==External links== * Category:The Bad Plus albums Category:Joshua Redman albums Category:2015 albums Category:Nonesuch Records albums ",
