    "text": "xDISCIPLEx A.D. (or xdisciplex a.d.) was a straight edge Christian hardcore band from Erie, Pennsylvania. Formerly xdisciplex or disciple, the band had to change its name to avoid legal actions due to a prior established band named Disciple. They released albums with Goodfellow Records, Triple Crown Records and Facedown Records. The band often played in Ontario, Canada, due to its connections with the Buffalo/Hamilton hardcore scene and Goodfellow Records/Redstar Records. After they disbanded, Dan Quiggle, Dave Quiggle, and Adam Salaga started another band called Jesus Wept, Strike First Records *Bands* while Neil Hartman joined No Innocent Victim. Dave Quiggle moved to California during the summer of 2005 and also joined No Innocent Victim and works for Facedown Records doing design.
