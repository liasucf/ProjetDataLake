    "text": "Renni the Rescuer: A Dog of the Battlefield (German original: Renni der Retter: Das Leben eines Kriegshundes) is a 1940 war novel by Felix Salten, describing the career of a military working dog called Renni, a German Shepherd dog, and his master, Georg. Although the book is a work of fiction, Salten did some research for it: he was allowed to follow the dog training of the Swiss army. The story is set to an unspecific German-language country, and the German-language edition opens with a note: > \u201cThe occurrences depicted in this book take place in an imaginary country. > Therefore also the war events are merely imaginary shadows of a tragic > reality.\u201dRenni der Retter (1941), p. 5. This note is missing from the English-language edition; on the other hand, the English edition has additional references to Europe, missing from the German version.Cf. Renni the Rescuer (1940), p. 59: \u201cpeople here in Europe accept\u201d. Renni der Retter (1941), p. 49: \u201cdie Menschen seien\u201d. Renni the Rescuer was published in English translation in 1940 in the United States, and the original German-language edition was published in Switzerland only in 1941. The English translation is longer than the published German-language edition because Salten\u2019s Swiss publisher removed some sequences that were considered weak.Eddy (2010), p. 298. The most remarkable omissions are the following: # A conversation between the working dogs about the essence of war.Pages 245\u2013247 in the 1940 U.S. edition. # The subplot with the traumatized carrier pigeon has been removed altogether.The pigeon appears on pages 260\u2013321 in the 1940 U.S. edition. On the other hand, the death scene of a war horse, which takes a page in the German-language edition,Renni der Retter (1941), pp. 221\u2013222. has been reduced into nine lines in the English translation.Renni the Rescuer (1940), pp. 307\u2013308. Also some references to alcoholic beverages have been removed from the English translation. The U.S. edition was illustrated by Diana Thorne and the Swiss edition by Philipp Arlen. The novel is divided in three parts. The first part tells about Renni\u2019s childhood and youth. The second part describes the education of Renni as a combat search and rescue dog and his first triumph at a war manoeuvre. The final part takes the main characters to a full-scale war where they become a seamless unit. At the end, both are wounded so that they have to be released from duty. So, although the book is labeled as a biography (Das Leben), it does not end with the death of the protagonist \u2014 it merely recounts the whole story of Renni\u2019s career as a military working dog. The English-language edition adds chapter division to the book, totalling 30 chapters. The main human character of the novel is Georg Hauser, a young farmer of his late twenties and a reservist, Corporal. He is an ideal dog-owner who wants to train his dog without beating or even talking harshly to it.Eddy (2010), p. 297. A contrast to Georg is Karl Stefanus who owns Renni\u2019s brother Pasha and who beats his dog constantly and finally shoots the poor animal to death. Other subsidiary characters include Georg\u2019s mother Maria; Bettina, a service girl; Augustin Flamingo, a deceited husband; the Russian family Safonov with their six children; and Voggenberger who raises dogs.
