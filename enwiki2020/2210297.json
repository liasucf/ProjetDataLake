    "text": "Barrenjoey High School is a government-funded co-educational comprehensive secondary day school, located in Avalon Beach, a suburb in the Northern Beaches of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Established in 1968, the school catered for approximately 700 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, including one percent of whom identified as Indigenous Australians and eight percent were from a language background other than English. The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education; the principal is Ian Bowsher. == Overview == The first student intake was in 1968 with a single grade (known at the time as 'Form 1') which formally graduated from the school in 1973. The inaugural graduating year of 1973 remains close-knit and has recently held a reunion with an outstanding number of students in attendance (more than 70, close to 40 years after last seeing each other). The location of the school right at the beach lends itself to many curricular and non-curricular beach activities. Over ensuing years, the school has grown in enrolments to its current level, necessitating expansion of the campus and construction of additional facilities. Barrenjoey's feeder primary schools include Avalon Public School, Bilgola Plateau Public School and a few other schools in the local area. There appears to be a trend towards increasing achievement at the school, with the class of 2008 achieving 150 Band 6 results in a range of subjects in the NSW Higher School Certificate. This trend has continued through to 2014, where the class achieved over 170 Band 6 results. == House system == In 2009, Barrenjoey High School introduced the house system. Students are placed into one of the four houses in Year 7. The houses are made up in alphabetical order, according to students last name. The four houses are named Maluka (blue), Akuna (yellow), Iluka (red) and Tingara (green). Students can win 'house points' through various activities including receiving merit certificates and participating in school carnivals. But, by the end of 2018, this system had been terminated. == Community involvement == Barrenjoey High School is actively involved in the Avalon community. The SRC chooses a charity each year to support, in previous years they have supported: * RUOK? * Asylum Seeker Resource Centre Various teachers have participated in Movember in 2014 and 2015, raising over $2,700 towards prostate cancer and testicular cancer research. Their team is called Barrenmoey.https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123928/http://au.movember.com/team/1606381 ==Notable alumni== * Nina Curtissailor; silver medalist at the 2012 Summer Olympics * Chelsea Georgesonworld surfing champion * Lyndall Gerlacharcher; Australian and New South Wales champion * Sam Harrisrugby union and rugby league player; played with the NSW Waratahs, Manly Sea Eagles and Wests Tigers * Dr Mark Howdenchief research scientist at CSIRO * Dr Shane Oliverchief economist at AMP * Ben Playerworld-champion bodyboarder * Angus Stonemusician * Julia Stonemusician * Wendy Sharpeartist; winner of the 1996 Archibald Prize * Professor Richard Whittingtonveterinarian and academic * Sam Verrillsrugby league player * Dr Rebecca Johnson - Chief Scientist Smithsonian Institution Museum Washington DC == See also == * List of government schools in New South Wales * Education in Australia == References == == External links == * * NSW Department of Education and Training: Barrenjoey High School Category:Educational institutions established in 1968 Category:1968 establishments in Australia Category:Rock Eisteddfod Challenge participants Category:Public high schools in Sydney Category:Avalon Beach, New South Wales ",
