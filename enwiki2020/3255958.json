    "text": "Language reform is a kind of language planning by widespread change to a language. The typical methods of language reform are simplification and linguistic purism. Simplification regularizes vocabulary, grammar, or spelling. Purism aligns the language with a form which is deemed 'purer'. Language reforms are intentional changes to language; this article does not cover natural language change, such as the Great Vowel Shift. ==Simplification== By far the most common language reform is simplification. The most common simplification is spelling reform, however inflection, syntax, vocabulary and word formation can also be targets for simplification. For example, in English, there are many prefixes which mean \"the opposite of\", e.g. un-, in-, a(n)-, dis-, and de-. A language reform might propose to replace the redundant prefixes with one, such as un-. ==Purification== Linguistic purism or linguistic protectionism is the prescriptive practice of recognizing one form of a language as purer or of intrinsically higher quality than others. The perceived or actual decline may take the form of change of vocabulary, syncretism of grammatical elements, or loanwords, and in this case, the form of a language reform. ==Examples== Examples of language reforms are: * Belgian (Flemish/Dutch) \u2013 In 1844 (Jan Frans Willems), 1864 (Matthias de Vries and L.A. te Winkel), 1946 (Marchant), 1996 (Actie) and 2006. * Catalan \u2013 In 1917 Pompeu Fabra published Diccionari ortogr\u00e0fic, the first Catalan dictionary. The complete Diccionari General de la Llengua Catalana was published in 1931. * Chinese ** (1920s) \u2013 replaced Classical Chinese with Vernacular Chinese as the standard written language, largely through the efforts of Hu Shih. ** Mandarin was chosen at a committee from several Chinese dialects. ** (1950s PRC) \u2013 changed the script used to write the standard language by introducing Simplified Chinese characters (later adopted by Singapore and Malaysia, but Traditional Chinese characters remain in use in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and various overseas Chinese communities). * Czech (19th century) \u2013 The dictionary of Josef Jungmann contributed to the renewal of the vocabulary. In the 1840s the letter w was replaced by v. * Dutch (19th and 20th century) \u2014 In 1883 (De Vries and Te Winkel), 1934 (Marchant), 1947 (The Green Booklet), 1996 (Actie) and 2006. * Estonian (1910s/1920s) \u2013 reform movement led by Johannes Aavik and Johannes V. Veski renewed the vocabulary, borrowing a lot of roots from Finnish and other Uralic languages and even inventing some roots. * French (18th, 19th, and 20th century) \u2014 In 1740, 1762, 1835, 1992 by the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. * German (1901/02) \u2013 unified the spelling system nationwide (first in Germany, with later adoption by other German-speaking lands). Further reforms were enacted more recently, in the German spelling reform of 1996. * Greek (1970s/1980s) \u2013 while the written \"pure\" language, the Katharevousa was full of Ancient Greek words, the spoken \"popular\" language, the Demotic Greek was not. After the fall of the military rule, a law was promulgated, making the latter the written language as well. For example, on Greek coins, the plural of the currency was drachmai (Katharevousa) before and became drachmes (Demotic Greek) after 1982. * Hebrew (1920s) \u2013 Modern Hebrew was created from Ancient Hebrew by grammatical simplification (especially of the syntax) according to Indo-European models, coinage of new words from Hebrew roots based on European models, and simplification of pronunciation rules. Linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann argues that Modern Hebrew, which he calls \"Israeli\", is a Semito-European hybrid, based not only on Hebrew but also on Yiddish and other languages spoken by revivalists.Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns, Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Journal of Language Contact, Varia 2, pp. 40\u201367 (2009). Zuckermann therefore endorses the translation of the Hebrew Bible into what he calls \"Israeli\".Let my people know! , Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Jerusalem Post, May 18, 2009. * Hungarian (late 18th and early 19th centuries) \u2013 more than ten thousand words were coined,K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Szily presented approx. 10,000 words in his book A magyar nyelv\u00faj\u00edt\u00e1s sz\u00f3t\u00e1ra (\"Dictionary of Hungarian language reform\", vol. 1\u20132: 1902 and 1908), without aiming to be comprehensive thousands of which are actively used today (see also Ferenc Kazinczy). * Irish (1940s) \u2013 spelling system greatly simplified: Gaedheal became Gael, and \u00d3 S\u00e9igheadh became \u00d3 S\u00e9. * Japanese (1946) \u2013 historical kana usage was replaced by modern kana usage, while the kanji system also transformed from Traditional Chinese characters to New Characters. * Norwegian (20th century) \u2013 as Norway became independent from Denmark (1814), Norwegians wanted a written language closer to spoken Norwegian. The reforms in 1907 and 1917 made Riksm\u00e5l the written standard Norwegian, renamed Bokm\u00e5l in 1929. Bokm\u00e5l and the more vernacular Nynorsk were made closer by a reform in 1938. Today both language forms are written: on Norwegian coins, the name of the country is alternately Norge (Bokm\u00e5l) and Noreg (Nynorsk). * Portuguese (20th century) \u2013 replaced a cumbersome traditional spelling system with a simplified one (asthma, for instance, became asma and phthysica became t\u00edsica). * Romanian (19th century) \u2013 replaced Cyrillic script with the Latin alphabet, deprecated thousands of Slavic words in favour of Romance words. Romanian has undergone spelling reforms in 1904, 1953, and, most recently, in 1993, with two minor ones in 1964 and 2005. * Russian \u2013 1918 \u2013 Major changes in Russian orthography. Several letters were removed from Russian alphabet. Minor changes in Russian grammar. The reform has simplified some aspects of the language. Other reforms happened in 1708/1710 and 1956. * Serbian (19th century) \u2014 Slavonic-Serbian, the literary language of Habsburg Serbs, was disused with Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107's reforms and standardization as official language of Serbia. * Somali (1970s) \u2013 modified Latin script developed by a number of leading scholars of Somali, including Musa Haji Ismail Galal, B. W. Andrzejewski and Shire Jama Ahmed for writing the Somali language; made compulsory in 1972 by the President of Somalia, General Mohamed Siad Barre * Turkish (1930s) \u2013 language and writing system were reformed beginning in the 1920s, such that the older language is called by a different name: Ottoman Turkish. The Ottoman alphabet was based on the Arabic alphabet, which was replaced in 1928 by the new Latin-based Turkish alphabet. Loanwords of Persian and Arabic origin were dropped in favor of native Turkish words or new coinages based on Turkic roots. * Vietnamese (20th century) \u2013 Classical Chinese lost official status in 1918, and the colonial schools instituted a \"Franco-Vietnamese Curriculum\" at this time. Vietnamese was taught using the Latin alphabet, and this form soon became dominant. ==Instances in popular culture== *(Fictional): In George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, English has become Newspeak, a language designed to make official propaganda easy and to make politically undesirable thoughts impossible to express. ==See also== *Coptic pronunciation reform *Spelling reform *English-language spelling reform *Language revival *Language planning *Language policy *Metrication *International Phonetic Association *Constructed language *Gender-neutral language *Newspeak *Diglossia *Otto Basler ==Bibliography== *Geoffrey Lewis, The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success, Oxford University Press, 2002, .
