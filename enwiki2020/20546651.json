Just prior to the ceremony, Jeremiah Wayne (Ford), desperately in love with Moonyeen, forces his way through the crowd and tries to stop the wedding. As John moved towards him, Jeremiah drew a pistol and leveled it at the bridegroom. Just as the shot was fired, Moonyeen moved to protect John and received the bullet intended for him. As she laid dying, the marriage ceremony was performed. Many years later, Kathleen (Talmadge), the image of her aunt Moonyeen, has become the ward of John. She meets Kenneth Wayne (Ford), the son of Jeremiah, and the couple fall in love, much to the grief of her guardian, who hates the name of the man who caused him a lifetime of sorrow. John orders the young Wayne away and forbids Kathleen from ever seeing him again. In spite of John's orders, Kathleen goes to bid farewell to her sweetheart as he leaves for duty in World War I. When she returns, John tells her the story of Moonyeen as the reason she must forget Kenneth. After four years Kathleen and Kenneth meet, the latter returning wounded and crippled.
