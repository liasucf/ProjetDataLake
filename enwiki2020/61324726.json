    "text": "\"Go back to where you came from\" is a racial insult used in the United States mainly by white Americans to target immigrants or members of minority groups who are falsely regarded as immigrants. There is also a common variant of this phrase popularized by the Ku Klux Klan \"Go back to your country.\" The phrase has a long history going back at least as far as 1798. It is most frequently directed at Latino Americans from Mexico and Latin America, but sometimes directed towards Asian Americans and African Americans. People who come to the U.S. from Latin America are often told to \"Go back to Mexico!\" even when some of them aren't from Mexico and African Americans are often told \"go back to Africa\". The message conveys a sense that the person is \"not supposed to be there, or that it isn't their place\". The speaker is presumed to be a \"real\" American while the target of the remark is not. Go back to where you came from is deemed by the United States federal government and the court system to be discriminatory in the workplace. Its use has been accepted as evidence of workplace discrimination in cases brought before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)\u2014a federal government agency that \"enforces federal law to make sure employees are not discriminated against for their gender, sex, national origin or age\". EEOC documents specifically cite the use of the comment \"Go back to where you came from\", as the example of unlawful workplace conduct by co-workers and supervisors\u2014along with the use of \"insults, taunting, or ethnic epithets, such as making fun of a person's accent\"\u2014deemed to be \"harassment based on national origin\". ==Background== The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is a federal government agency that \"enforces federal law to make sure employees are not discriminated against for their gender, sex, national origin or age\".The EEOC was established against the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement in the United States and was mandated by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. EEOC documents defining \"harassment based on national origin\" specifically cite the use of the comment \"Go back to where you came from\", as the example of \"unlawful\" workplace conduct by co-workers and supervisors if its use is creates an \"intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment, interfere[s] with work performance, or negatively affect[s] job opportunities\". Other \"illegal\" workplace behavior includes the use of \"insults, taunting, or ethnic epithets, such as making fun of a person's accent\". According to a July 20, 2019, CNN article, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has used phrases, such as, \"Go back to where you came from\" as evidence of workplace discrimination. ==Examples== According to an August 31, 2003, Houston Chronicle article, a car salesman of East Indian descent who was Muslim was had been hired at a Texas car dealership in May 2001, began to be subjected to taunts by his co-workers including \"go back where you came from\" post 9/11. He filed a complaint with the EEOC in 2003 after he was fired from the dealership in 2002. According to CNN, in rendering their decision to side with the EEOC case on behalf of the salesman and against the car dealership accused of creating a \"hostile work environment based on ... national origin and religion\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \"cited the example\" several times of the repeated use of the phrase \"just go back where [he] came from\". By 2003, allegedly as part of the post-9/11 backlash, over 943 discrimination complaints were filed to the EEOC leading to over 115 lawsuits. Since at least 2006, according to a list of EEOC litigation cases from 2005 to 2016, published by EEOC, the Delano Regional Medical Center (DRMC) in southern California subjected \"Filipino- American hospital workers\" to harassing comments, including \"humiliating threats of arrest if they did not speak English and were told to go back to the Philippines\". The case against DRMC, settled on September 17, 2012, awarded the workers who were mostly nursing staff with $975,000 and injunctive relief. On February 12, 2008, a case against U-Haul of Nevada was resolved in Los Angeles, in favor of the employees. EEOC had alleged that some Hispanic and Asian/Filipino employees had been \"subjected to derogatory comments and slurs based on their race and/or national origin such as \"go back to Mexico.\" A Texas-based oil company, Blue Ridge Resources, had to pay damages and provide injunctive relief to a five-member crew originally from Mexico, who had been were subjected to national origin harassment by their rig-crew supervisor, including being told to \"go back to Mexico\". The supervisor also used \"unwelcomed ethnic slurs\", called them \"stupid Mexicans\", and said that all Mexicans who came to the U.S. should be hung. An employee who is Muslim and was originally from The Gambia, filed an EEOC complaint against a Wal-Mart store and won the ensuing lawsuit in Philadelphia on June 12, 2015. The \"national origin and religious harassment\" he was subjected to included \"being told to \"go back to Africa,\" \"all Muslims do is blow up buildings and people,\" and mocking his accent\". On July 14, 2019, President Donald Trump used the phrase to refer to four American congresswomen of color in a tweet, stating \"Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came...\", even though three of the four are native-born Americans. The tweet drew controversy due to Donald Trump's history of racially-charged comments. According to CNN legal analyst Laura Coates, the statement, \"although obviously racist to the public,\" may not be unlawful, because EEOC guidelines only apply to work environments and \"the United States Congress and its members do not work for the President.\" In response to Trump's tweet, The New York Times invited readers to comment. They received accounts from 16,000 readers of their \"experiences of being told to 'go back'.\" ==Global usage== Numerous articles related to racism in Europe cite the use of the phrase and its variations in many European countries. In 2009, a nurse who worked in a S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje Hospital in Sweden complained to management about the way the staff treated patients who had immigrant backgrounds, citing examples of verbal harassment such as \"go back to Arabia\". The nurse lost his job. Incidents of verbal harassment based on ethnicity in Italy include the 2018 beating of a 19-year-old man from Senegal, who had requested political asylum and was working as a server in Palermo. He was attacked by three Italian men and told to \"Go back to your country, dirty nigger\". Their actions were denounced by Monsignor Michele Pennisi, the Archbishop of Monreale, who expressed the \"strongest condemnation of this act of racism, of xenophobia\" that does not reflect the \"attitude of Christians and of many men of good will in Sicily\". The phrase was used during the 2015 South African xenophobic riots, in which immigrants\u2014including African expatriates from other African countries\u2014were blamed for the high unemployment rate of South Africans. According to an April 20, 2015, CNN article, local news reported that the Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini had said at a gathering that foreigners \"should pack their bags and go\" because they are taking jobs from citizens. Shortly after this report, violence against immigrants erupted in the port city of Durban. Zwelithini denied that he had said this. The Los Angeles Times said that South Africa's high unemployment rate has been the catalyst for violent attacks in South Africa against migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and other African countries who are blamed for \"stealing jobs and undercutting small businesses owned by South Africans\". There was a wave of xenophobic killings in South Africa in 2008, in which 62 people were killed. ==See also== *Go Back to Where You Came From, an award-winning Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) TV documentary series, produced in Australia, that was broadcast in 2011, 2012, and 2015. In each season, 6 Australians\u2014whose views on asylum seekers differ\u2014traveled to the countries of origin of refugees, and then took the often perilous route the refugees had taken to reach Australia. *Perpetual foreigner ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * * also published in Category:Aftermath of the September 11 attacks Category:Anti-Asian sentiment in the United States Category:Anti-immigration politics in the United States Category:Ethically disputed political practices Category:Ethnic and racial stereotypes in the United States Category:Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Category:Freedom of speech Category:Harassment Category:Hate crime Category:Hate speech Category:Linguistic controversies Category:Microaggression theory Category:Political terminology Category:Prejudice and discrimination Category:Race legislation in the United States Category:Race and law in the United States Category:Racism in the United States Category:United States administrative law Category:Xenophobia ",
