The unit does not use the Coast Guard rank system, but uses modified Coast Guard officer rank insignia to signify a member's position within the organization. For example, a Flotilla Commander wears insignia similar to a Lieutenant. USCG Auxiliary Insignia USCG Auxiliary officers wear silver braid insignia (referred to as \"office insignia\") instead of gold; with a \"hollow\" USCG shield above containing the letters \"USCG\" superimposed above a red \"A\" (to signify an appointed officer\") or silver \"A\" (to signify an elected officer). Metal and sew-on insignia are identical to Coast Guard officer insignia, except that a red, blue, or black \"A\" is superimposed. Auxiliarists generally do not use titles in direct address, with the exception of a few very senior leaders who are addressed as \"Commodore.\" ==See also== * List of United States Coast Guard enlisted rates * Naval officer ranks\u2014comparison to other countries and explanation of NATO rank codes ==External links== *DoD Military Rank and Insignia: Coast Guard *Department of Defense Rank Insignias \u2014 Officers Rank Rate Category:Military insignia * ",
