    "text": "Idle Moments is a 1963 jazz album, released in 1965,Billboard Mar 6, 1965 by guitarist Grant Green. Released on Blue Note, it features performances by Joe Henderson on tenor saxophone, Bobby Hutcherson on vibes, Blue Note in-house producer Duke Pearson on piano, Bob Cranshaw on bass, and Al Harewood on drums. It was released in early 1965. The album is best known for the title piece, a slow composition in C minor which lasts for nearly 15 minutes. Pearson, who wrote the song, explains in his liner notes to the album that the tune was meant to be much shorter. Due to the musicians repeating the main melody twice, however, there was some confusion as to whether or not one chorus would consist of 16 or 32 measures. Producer Alfred Lion was satisfied with the take, although he suggested that they do a retake to fit the song into a seven-minute limit. However, the song had a special feeling to it which no subsequent take could recapture, so it was decided to release the first take on the album. Two other songs, \"Jean De Fleur\" and \"Django\", were re- recorded in shorter renditions to compensate for the length of the title track; the extended renditions of both songs can be heard on the CD re-issues of the album. The listing below follows the 1998 RVG edition of the album. The album was identified by Scott Yanow in his Allmusic essay \"Hard Bop\" as one of the 17 Essential Hard Bop Recordings. ==Track listing== #\"Idle Moments\" (Pearson) \u2013 14:56 #\"Jean De Fleur\" (Green) \u2013 6:49 #\"Django\" (John Lewis) \u2013 8:44 #\"Nomad\" (Pearson) \u2013 12:16 Bonus tracks on CD reissue: # * \"Jean De Fleur\" [Alternate Take] - 8:09 #\"Django\" [Alternate Take] - 13:12 Recorded on November 4 (#1, 4-6)and November 15 (#2-3), 1963. ==Personnel== *Grant Green - guitar *Joe Henderson - tenor saxophone *Duke Pearson - piano *Bobby Hutcherson - vibraphone *Bob Cranshaw - double bass *Al Harewood - drums == References == Category:1965 albums Category:Grant Green albums Category:Blue Note Records albums Category:Albums produced by Alfred Lion Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio ",
