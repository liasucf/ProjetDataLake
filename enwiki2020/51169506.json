Headquartered in New Zealand, the ClearFoundation Community provides its support to the ClearOS users based in over 150 countries across the globe. ClearFoundation centers its efforts around providing a growing community with the ability to use, develop and even contribute source to the ClearOS distribution. == History == ClearFoundation was founded in 2009 by Michael Proper, Gregory Jackson, John Fallentine, Ray Mihaere, David Loper and others. Considering the fragmented patent laws in Canada, India and the United States, ClearFoundation's founders started searching for an intelligent jurisdiction they could build their new open source project protected from patent and/or copyright issues. The main motive behind founding ClearFoundation was to provide its Community with a jurisdiction for open source licensing. After a global search, the founders of ClearFoundation selected New Zealand considering the friendly patent laws and strict copyright laws available in New Zealand. == ClearFoundation Community == ClearFoundation has a rich community of over 107,000 members from more than 150 countries. Many of these members have become experts to help resolve fresh concerns, wish-lists, development, testing and deployment of ClearOS Community editions. Community members can earn recognition (badges) by participating in community projects, forums, and other tasks associated to ClearOS. The ClearFoundation Forum also provides the users with a space to discuss about their issues and thoughts about ClearOS and get their issues fixed by experts. == Projects == === ClearOS === ClearOS is an Open Source Linux Distribution based upon CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Initially, the software was launched as ClarkConnect in 2002 and got its present name in 2009. Paid versions of ClearOS and the ClearOS Marketplace are developed and supported by ClearCenter. ClearOS is specifically designed for small and medium enterprises as a network gateway and network server with web-based administration interface. == References == Category:Linux companies Category:Software companies of New Zealand ",
