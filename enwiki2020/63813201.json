    "text": "Mabuhay, also known as Mabuhay Magazine, is a monthly publication that serves as the inflight magazine of Philippine Airlines. Since July 2016 the magazine has been published by London-based Ink Global. First published in 1982, publication of the magazine passed to Eastgate Publishing Corporation in 1988, formerly owned by Max Soliven, publisher of The Philippine Star. Eastgate continued to publish the magazine until Ink Global won the contract to publish it in 2016. Under both publishers it has won several awards both local and international, and both for its travel photography and its journalism. The magazine, however, is not immune to criticism: in 2012, it was criticized for using transphobic language in its reporting of Jenna Talackova's entry in that year's Miss Universe Canada pageant \u2014 an act for which it later apologized and corrected in its digital edition. Publication of Mabuhay has been suspended owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, but is expected to resume once Philippine Airlines restarts its flights. ==See also== *Mabuhay (expression) ==References== ==External links== *Mabuhay from Ink Global, including current issues *Archive of Eastgate Publishing-published Mabuhay issues * Category:Philippine Airlines Category:Magazines published in the Philippines Category:Inflight magazines Category:Magazines established in 1982 ",
