After playing for Rosenborg between 2011 and 2013, H\u00f8iland returned to Stab\u00e6k ahead of the 2014 season. ==Club career== H\u00f8iland was born and grew up in F\u00e5berg outside Lillehammer and played for the local side during his youth Faaberg. At the age of eight he watched the semi-final of the 1985 Norwegian Football Cup where his brother Olav was played for the Faaberg-team that lost against V\u00e5lerenga. during his youth, before he left for Bryne in 1995. After two seasons with the club, he joined Kongsvinger where he played for two seasons before he travelled to the Swedish club IFK G\u00f6teborg ahead of the 1999 season, which was one of the biggest club in Scandinavia. In his two first seasons in Sweden, the club finished fourth in Allsvenskan, before they finished sixth in the 2001 season. IFK G\u00f6teborg were struggling in the bottom half of the table in the 2002 season. H\u00f8iland's contract expired after that season and he was offered a sixth month contract with the English club Portsmouth, but chose to join Malm\u00f6 FF as a free agent in January 2003, and signed a three-year contract with the club. He played 86 matches during his four seasons with IFK G\u00f6teborg In his second season with the club he scored the decisive goal when Malm\u00f6 claimed the 2004 Allsvenskan championship. When Niklas Skoog's penalty was saved by the goalkeeper, H\u00f8iland scored on the rebound, when Malm\u00f6 won 1\u20130 against Elfsborg, while Halmstads BK who were leading the league ahead of the decisive match only managed a 1\u20131 draw against IFK G\u00f6teborg. H\u00f8iland was loaned out to the Bundesliga side 1. FC Kaiserslautern in January 2006, until the end of the 2005\u201306 Bundesliga season. The German side had an option to buy H\u00f8iland, but H\u00f8iland did not want to continue to play in the club that was relegated from Bundesliga. He returned to Malm\u00f6, but stated that his dream was to continue playing in one of the big leagues in Europe. In March 2005, H\u00f8iland signed a new three-year contract-extension with Malm\u00f6 FF. He did however returned to Norway after eight years abroad in August 2007, when he transferred to Stab\u00e6k. In his first season with Stab\u00e6k, the club finished second. The next season, Stab\u00e6k won the Tippeligaen, with H\u00f8iland playing regularly at the right back. After winning a bronze-medal with Stab\u00e6k in the 2009 season, H\u00f8iland was used as a centre-back in the 2010 season. His contract with Stab\u00e6k expired after the 2010 season, and he followed head coach Jan J\u00f6nsson to Rosenborg where he became J\u00f6nsson's first signing as head coach of Rosenborg. H\u00f8iland signed a two-year-long contract with Rosenborg in December 2010. H\u00f8iland made his debut for Rosenborg in the opening matches of the 2011 season against Brann. An ankle-injury in the fourth match of the season against Fredrikstad, made H\u00f8iland miss most of the season and did only make 10 appearances for his club. Towards the end of the 2012 season, H\u00f8iland signed a one-year contract extension with Rosenborg. His family had bought a house at Snar\u00f8ya during H\u00f8iland's first spell at Stab\u00e6k, and in February 2013 they decided that this was their last season in Trondheim. When the school started in August 2013 his family moved back to Snar\u00f8ya, and H\u00f8iland asked Rosenborg if he was allowed to return to his old club Stab\u00e6k, but they did not want to let him go due to an injury on Per Verner R\u00f8nning. H\u00f8iland played for Rosenborg until his contract expired, and won a silver-medal as Rosenborg finished second in the 2013 Tippeligaen. H\u00f8iland's last match for Rosenborg was the 2013 Norwegian Football Cup Final, where they lost 4\u20132 against Molde. He started the match instead of the regular right-back Cristian Gamboa. H\u00f8iland returned to Stab\u00e6k ahead of the 2014 season, and signed a two-year contract with the club. Stab\u00e6k had been promoted to the Tippeligaen in 2013, and H\u00f8iland stated that it would be hard to switch his mind-set to avoid relegation when he had won a medal in the league six of the last seven seasons. ==International career== H\u00f8iland represented his country at youth international level and played a total of 18 matches for different youth teams before he made his debut for the under-21 team against Iceland U21 in July 1997. He was a part of the Norwegian squad at the 1998 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, where the Norwegian team won bronze. He played a total of 14 matches for the under-21 team. H\u00f8iland was one of the best right-backs in Sweden between 2001 and 2003, but was not called up to the Norway national football team which Nils Johan Semb was national team coach. Semb's successor, \u00c5ge Hareide did however name H\u00f8iland in his first national team squad in January 2004. Hareide later claimed that H\u00f8iland was a player he wanted to buy while he was manager of Helsingborgs IF because of his offensive abilities as a right-back and also said that H\u00f8iland soon would challenge Christer Basma as the right-back on the national team. H\u00f8iland made his debut for Norway in the friendly match against Sweden in January 2004. After appearing in three friendly matches, H\u00f8iland was chosen to play as a right back in the 2006 World Cup qualifier against Belarus in September 2005, after Basma made a poor performance in the previous match against Italy. H\u00f8iland then became the first-choice as right-back on the national team. He scored his first and only goal for Norway on 1 April 2009, in the 3\u20132 victory over Finland. He played his 25th game for Norway against Montenegro on 29 May 2010, and he was awarded the Gold Watch for this feat. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== :Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |2007 |rowspan=\"4\"|Stab\u00e6k |rowspan=\"8\"|Tippeligaen |3||1||0||0||0||0||3||1 |- |2008 |22||2||5||3||0||0||27||5 |- |2009 |24||3||3||0||1||0||28||3 |- |2010 |27||2||3||0||2||0||32||2 |- |2011 |rowspan=\"3\"|Rosenborg |10||0||0||0||0||0||10||0 |- |2012 |19||0||0||0||7||0||26||0 |- |2013 |8||0||5||0||2||1||14||1 |- |2014 |rowspan=\"1\"|Stab\u00e6k |23||3||2||0||0||0||25||3 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !136!!11!!18!!3!!12!!1!!166!!15 |} ===International goals=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! # !!
