    "text": "The cream-eyed bulbul (Pycnonotus pseudosimplex) is a member of the bulbul family of passerine birds. It is endemic to the island of Borneo. It was formerly considered a white-eyed color morph of the red-eyed Bornean population of the cream-vented bulbul (P. simplex), especially as actual white-eyed morphs of P. simplex exist outside of Borneo. However, genetic analysis indicates that the Bornean white-eyed population is genetically distinct from P. simplex and most closely related the ashy-fronted bulbul (P. cinereifrons) of Palawan in the Philippines, whereas the Bornean red-eyed population is most closely related to white-eyed P. simplex from mainland Southeast Asia, though it could still warrant recognition as a separate subspecies or even species. Unlike the Bornean cream-vented bulbul, the cream- eyed bulbul is also much more habitat-restricted, occurring mostly only in high-altitude old-growth forests. == References == Category:Pycnonotus Category:Endemic birds of Borneo Category:Birds described in 2019 ",
