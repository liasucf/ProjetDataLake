It is the first paid concert streaming service in the world that delivers full- scaled live online concert aided by technology such as augmented reality and with real-time interactions between artists and live audience enabled. On its establishment, the platform has been regarded by global media as a relevant response in substituting traditional concerts during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first live concert of the Beyond Live series was headlined by South Korean boy supergroup SuperM with the concert titled SuperM: Beyond the Future on April 26, 2020; the live concert recorded over 75,000 virtual tickets sold, playing to real-time audience from 109 countries. Since its creation, multiple artists from SM and JYP have delivered full-length live online concerts within Beyond Live series, and other K-pop entertainment enterprises started to produce virtual live concerts in similar format. ==Background, technology and media reaction== By April 2020, it was announced South Korea's largest entertainment company SM Entertainment and South Korean Internet search platform and media corporation Naver had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with purpose to expand the reach of concerts to global audience. The joint effort lead to the creation of Beyond Live, a series of online live concerts which, according to SM, was formed in order to combine \"SM's content development capabilities with Naver's platform technology.\" On April 20, SM Entertainment released a trailer on their official YouTube channel announcing the upcoming series of live concerts, with the first live show to be headlined by K-pop boy group SuperM. Initially, Beyond Live was scheduled with four concert dates in April and May 2020. The concerts are hosted on the Vlive application and made available to audience from over 200 countries and territories. Subtitles in different languages are made available to live audience. Together with real-time access to the live concert, the paid audience have rights to on-demand viewing of the concerts afterwards. \u201cBeyond Live\u201d constitutes a real-time customized performance service for full-length and full-sized arena live concert in which there are no in-person audience, which is considered as different from prior commonly used methods of broadcasting a performance online from home or broadcasting an existing footage from previous concerts. The format and design of the concert is optimized for the online audience with the aid of technology including augmented reality (AR) technology, three-dimensional backdrop graphics, live sync camera walk, and digital communication to enable real-time interactions (two-way) between performers and the online audience. Specifically, Beyond Live concerts are credited for implementing augmented reality graphics to transform the stage to fit each performance, as well as varying camera shots arranged differently from normal concert broadcasts. Artists perform on a stage before \"a backdrop of screens and visuals [\u2026] directed in real-time\" by camera operators personnel. Real-time communication and Q&A; sessions between artists and online audience are conducted via video calls. Global media outlets like Forbes, Rolling Stone, and ABC News have commended the platform as a viable and timely alternative to traditional in-person concerts, which were being cancelled around the world as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ensuing rules on social distancing and restricted travels enforced in various countries. The Beyond Live concert series is also regarded as a digital innovation created to foster interactions between artists and the \"technical-savvy audience.\" In addition, Forbes remarked that, even if the impact of the coronavirus pandemic is to be ignored, the concert streaming service still addresses a prevalent need from international K-pop fans located across regions where K-pop acts rarely travel to, highlighting that for areas outside certain countries in Asia, the Americas, Europe, and Australia, fans lack the chance for in-person concerts and would need to turn to online alternatives regardless. On August 4, 2020, SM Entertainment and JYP Entertainment announced the establishment of Beyond Live Corporation, a joint company for virtual concerts. It was formed to grow Beyond LIVE into a global online concert brand by strengthening global joint business development by adding synergy between SM's content production capabilities and Naver's technology. ==Shows and reception== On April 21, 2020, the line-up for the first four concerts in the series were announced, with the each show to be headlined - in chronological order - by the boy groups SuperM, WayV, NCT Dream, and NCT 127.

The Hankyoreh described how the stage for \"Jopping\" transformed into the Colosseum-like structure in which the group members danced on the \"circular stadium\", giving the members an impression \"like gladiators in ancient Rome\". The live sync camera filming, with which space is linked with camera walking, is also regarded as a factor contributing to building a more realistic experience for viewers.
