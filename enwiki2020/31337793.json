It is located in the downtown Midtbyen area of the city of Trondheim, just a few blocks north of the Nidaros Cathedral. It is one of the two churches for the Nidaros og V\u00e5r Frue parish which is part of the Nidaros domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Nidaros. ==History== Drawing of V\u00e5r Frue kirke with dates of construction V\u00e5r Frue Church is a stone church that was built in a long church plan with features of both the Romanesque and Gothic architectural style. The church was first constructed during the mid- to late-1100s by Bj\u00f8rn Sigvardsson. The church has been damaged by fire several times. It has also been renovated, remodeled, and expanded several times in the centuries since that time. The oldest part of the existing church building dates back to the 12th century. Following the Protestant Reformation, the church was expanded westward, with the masonry in the original eastern parts preserved. The church was rebuilt after fires during the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. V\u00e5r Frue Church was restored in 1739. The tower was built in 1742 with the spire erected in 1779. During the 1700s, church received baroque decor. Much of the Baroque and Rococo interior were removed by restoration in the 1880s, led by architect Christian Christie (1832-1906), who also worked on the restoration of the Nidaros Cathedral. Christie made simplifications to the interior to bring it back partly to its former appearance during the Middle Ages. From 1957 to 1959, a new refurbishment was conducted, led by architect John Tverdahl (1890-1969). The church had a whitewashed exterior which was removed. The exterior masonry was knocked off so that the cobblestone stood bare as during the Medieval period. The altarpiece was originally carved for Nidaros Cathedral by Heinrich K\u00fchnemann (1711-1792) and dates to between 1742-1744. It was painted by J.N. Schavenius, and has figures cut by Jonas Granberg (1696-1776). In 1837 it was transferred to V\u00e5r Frue kirke. The pulpit was made in 1771 and it was restored 1957-1959. The baptismal font in the church is from 1898. ==Media gallery== Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora, Trondheim, Noruega, 2019-09-06, DD 122.jpg|Altar and altarpiece of V\u00e5r Frue kirke Vaar Frue kirke Trondheim SE.jpg|Side view of V\u00e5r Frue kirke Vfk schoning.jpg|Drawing of V\u00e5r Frue kirke from c. 1770 File:V\u00e5r Frue kirke Trondheim IMG 8651.jpg|Pulpit at V\u00e5r Frue kirke Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora, Trondheim, Noruega, 2019-09-06, DD 123.jpg|View of the organ and back of the church Vfk cityplanr.png|Location on old maps Vfk portal.jpg|View of the door V\u00e5r Frue kirke Trondheim IMG 8654.jpg|Roccoco wall V\u00e5r Frue kirke Trondheim IMG 8644.jpg|Front of the church Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora, Trondheim, Noruega, 2019-09-06, DD 42.jpg|Bell tower ==See also== *List of churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag ==References== ===Related reading=== * ==External links== *V\u00e5r Frue kirke Official Website *V\u00e5r Frue kirke (Trondheim) picture gallery Category:Churches in Trondheim Category:Churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag Category:Stone churches in Norway Category:12th-century establishments in Norway Category:12th-century Church of Norway church buildings ",
