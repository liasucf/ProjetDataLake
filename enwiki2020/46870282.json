    "text": "Si Sauvage is an album released on both 12\" vinyl and CD by the American New wave band The Suburbs, released in 2013. It was recorded 27 years after their last studio release. ==Reception== Writing for Allmusic, music critic Mark Deming wrote of the album \"It doesn't take long for Si Sauvage to announce itself as an album the Suburbs couldn't and wouldn't have made in the '80s, but if this is an older and battle-weary version of the Suburbs, it still sounds and feels like them... Si Sauvage is an album about acknowledging life's lessons without regrets, and finding both sorrow and joy in the process; it's the middle-aged response to the band's best album, 1984's Love Is the Law, and a work that gains depth and power with each listen.\" ==Track listing== All songs composed by Blaine John \"Beej\" Chaney and Chan Poling. #\"Born Under a Good Sign\" \u2013 4:03 #\"Turn the Radio On\" \u2013 4:14 #\"Dumb Ass Kids\" \u2013 3:10 #\"Where It Is!\" \u2013 4:05 #\"What's It Like out There?\" \u2013 4:05 #\"Reset the Party\" \u2013 3:12 #\"You've Got to Love Her\" \u2013 3:32 #\"I Liked It Better When You Loved Me\" \u2013 3:38 #\"Si Sauvage\" \u2013 3:12 #\"This Monkey\" \u2013 3:50 ==Personnel== * Chan Poling \u2013 vocals, keyboards * Blaine John \"Beej\" Chaney \u2013 vocals * Hugo Klaers \u2013 drums * Steve Brantseg \u2013 guitar * Steve Price \u2013 bass * Max Ray \u2013 saxophone * Rochelle Becker \u2013 baritone saxophone * Stephen Kung \u2013 trumpet * Janey Winterbauer \u2013 vocals * Aby Wolf \u2013 vocals ==Production notes== *Steve Price \u2013 producer *Steve Nagel \u2013 assistant engineer *Chuck Zwicky \u2013 mixing, mastering *Kii Arens \u2013 artwork, photography ==References== Category:2013 albums Category:The Suburbs albums ",
