    "text": "Ferskeytt (literally 'four-cornered') is an Icelandic stanzaic poetic form. It is a kind of quatrain, and probably first attested in fourteenth-century r\u00edmur such as \u00d3lafs r\u00edma Haraldssonar. It remains one of the dominant metrical forms in Icelandic versifying to this day.V\u00e9steinn \u00d3lason, 'Old Icelandic Poetry', in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. by Daisy Nejmann, Histories of Scandinavian Literature, 5 (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2006), pp. 1-63 (pp. 55-59). Ferskeytt comprises odd-numbered, basically trochaic lines with four stresses in the pattern / x / x / x /, alternating with even- numbered trochaic lines with three stresses in the pattern / x / x / x. In each line, one unstressed syllable may be replaced with two unstressed syllables. Stanzas are normally of four lines, and rhyme aBaB. In the first line, two heavily-stressed syllables alliterate with the first heavily- stressed syllable of the second line, and so on in the usual alliterative pattern of Germanic alliterative verse.Richard Ringler, Bard of Iceland : J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson, poet and scientist (Madison, Wisc.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2002), \u00a7III.2, http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/Jonas/Prosody/Prosody-II.html. An example of the form is this verse by J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson, with a translation into the same metre by Dick Ringler.Richard Ringler, Bard of Iceland : J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson, poet and scientist (Madison, Wisc.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2002), \u00a7III.2, http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/Jonas/Prosody/Prosody-II.html. Alliteration is emboldened and rhyme is italicised: There are many variations on ferskeytt, whose common principle is that they are quatrains with some kind of alternate rhyme. A poem in this metre is called a ferskeytla ('four- cornered [poem]'). Metres which share these properties belong to the ferskeytlu\u00e6tt ('ferskeytla-family').Richard Ringler, Bard of Iceland : J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson, poet and scientist (Madison, Wisc.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2002), \u00a7III.2, http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/Jonas/Prosody/Prosody- II.html. ==References== ==External links== * H\u00f3lmfr\u00ed\u00f0ur P\u00e9tursd\u00f3ttir singing in ferskeytt: '\u00deegar vetrar \u00feokan gr\u00e1' * Ingibj\u00f6rg Fri\u00f0riksd\u00f3ttir singing in ferskeytt: 'Ferskeytlan er l\u00edti\u00f0 lj\u00f3\u00f0' * Gunnar Helgmundur Alexandersson singing in ferskeytt: 'Ferskeytlan er Fr\u00f3nb\u00faans' Category:Poetic devices Category:Medieval poetry Category:Old Norse poetry Category:Icelandic literature Category:Icelandic music Category:R\u00edmur ",
