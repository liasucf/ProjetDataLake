    "text": "The House of Houdini is a museum and performance venue located at 11, D\u00edsz Square, within the walls of the Buda Castle in Budapest, Hungary. The museum houses the only collection of original Houdini artifacts in Europe. ==History== The museum's collection includes original Houdini memorabilia: e.g., handcuffs, personal correspondence, and \"precious artifacts.\" A Bible once owned by Houdini is part of the collection. It also includes original props from the Houdini film Oxygen (1999), which featured Adrien Brody, an Oscar winner, and the later miniseries. The facility opened on June 16, 2016. Budapest was selected as the location of the museum as Houdini was born in the city. The museum is the product of David Merlini, an escapologist who served as technical advisor on the Houdini miniseries. Its artifacts were previewed at Budapest's National Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi Library. This followed an earlier exhibition in Milan, Italy. The venue is also a center for research into Houdini's life, highlighting his Hungarian origin. and Jewish. Notwithstanding his Hungarian birth, Houdini never performed in Hungary. Six magicians rotate performance in the museum's small theater. ==Admission== As of September, admission is 2,400 forints for adults and 1,350 forints for children under age 11. English, Italian and Hungarian language guided tours are available. Visitor entrance can only be gained through decoding a secret \"arcane\" message; if the visitor fails to solve it, they refund the price of admission. ==Name== This \"house\" should not be confused with the \"House of Houdini\" which was a former Houdini home, purchased in 1908, at 278 West 113th Street, Harlem, now called Morningside Heights, New York City that also displays artifacts. Likewise, in 1919 he rented the cottage at 2435 Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Los Angeles, while making movies for Lasky Pictures. His wife occupied it for a time after his death. As of 2011 the site of the cottage was a vacant lot and up for sale. The main mansion building itself was rebuilt after it was destroyed in the 1959 Laurel Canyon fire, and is now a historic venue called The Mansion. While Houdini did not likely live at the \"mansion,\" there is some probability that his widow did. ==Other Houdini museums== *American Museum of Magic *David Copperfield's International Museum and Library of the Conjuring Arts, which is closed to the public *The History Museum at the Castle (Appleton Wisconsin) *Houdini Museum (Scranton, Pennsylvania) *Houdini Museum of New York *University of Texas Library houses Houdini ephemera and a large collection of Houdini letters and manuscripts. ==See also== *List of magic museums ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ==External links== * House of Houdini Official website Category:Biographical museums in Hungary Category:Organizations established in 2016 Category:Magic museums Category:Museums in Budapest ",
