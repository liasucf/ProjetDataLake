In 1658, Ponhea Chan (Sultan Ibrahim) overthrew Outey and massacred his family. Ang So and his brother Ang Tan revolted against Chan. At first they were defeated and took refuge by Neak Ang Chov (). The latter convinced them to seek help from Hu\u1ebf. Reinforced by a Vietnamese army, they took the offensive in October 1658. They defeated and killed their own brother Ang Em, whom had sided with Ponhea Chan, in a naval battle. The Vietnamese captured Chan, locked him in an iron cage and deported to Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh, where he soon died. Ang So ascended the throne under the name of Barom Reachea VIII. For Hu\u1ebf's help, Cambodia granted permission to the Vietnamese to settle in Cambodia, to own lands and agreed to pay tribute to Hu\u1ebf.the historical background - Shodhganga, page. 30\u201331 In December 1672, he was killed and usurped by his nephew Chey Chettha III. ==References== * Phoeun Mak, Dharma Po \u00ab La premi\u00e8re intervention militaire vietnamienne au Cambodge (1658-1659) \u00bb dans: Bulletin de l'\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient, tome 73, 1984, p. 285-318. * Chroniques Royales du Cambodge de 1594 \u00e0 1677. \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame Orient.
