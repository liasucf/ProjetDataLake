Behind the home are a carriage house, which is connected to the main house by a breezeway, and the caretaker's cottage. ==History== The Lytle brothers, Robert and Joseph, ran a grocery business in Fairhaven, Washington, then moved their business to Hoquiam. In the 1880s, Hoquiam became a center for lumber. When a customer paid his bill by turning over his logging operation, the brothers became part of the logging industry. Joseph built his house on a hill overlooking Hoquiam in 1900, next door to his brother's grander mansion. After his death in 1914, his widow lived in the home until the early 1930s. In the 1940s, the home was converted to apartments. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Grays Harbor County, Washington Category:Queen Anne architecture in Washington (state) Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1900 ",
