Up to ten crews are removed from the bottom of last year's finishing order, who must then race alongside new entrants to decide which crews gain a place (with one bumps place per 3 crews competing, subject to the maximum of 10 available places). The 2007 Lent Bumps Getting-on Race took place on 23 February 2007. A total of 17 men's and 24 women's crews took part, competing for the bottom 6 men's spaces and bottom 8 women's spaces in the main bumps races. ===Successful crews=== The successful crews were (in the order that they were put onto the main start order); ====Men==== * * * * * * ====Women==== * * * * * * * * Category:Lent Bumps results Lent Bumps Category:2007 in English sport ",
