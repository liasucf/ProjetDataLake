The season was divided into two tournaments, called the Apertura and Clausura, with the winner of each earning separate national titles. To date, it marks the only time in Serie A history that two titles were awarded in one year. ==Campeonato Apertura== The Apertura tournament was set into two stages. The First Stage was a double round-robin tournament where each team plays the other nine teams twice, once at home and once away. The top eight teams advanced to a two-leg single elimination knockout stage. The last team in the First Stage was relegated to Serie B. The winner of the knockout stage is the Apertura champion, and qualifies as the Ecuador 1 berth in the 2006 Copa Libertadores. ===First stage=== ===Playoff stage=== (*) Barcelona and D. Cuenca advance because of better First Stage records. ==Campeonato Clausura== The Clausura tournament was set into two stages.
