    "text": "The UK Albums Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling albums of the week in the United Kingdom. Since 2004 the chart has been based on the sales of both physical albums and digital downloads. This list shows albums that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart during 2010, as well as albums which peaked in 2009 and 2011 but were in the top 10 in 2010. The entry date is when the album appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced). One-hundred and fifty-two albums were in the top ten this year. Sixteen albums from 2009 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year, while Loud by Rihanna, Sigh No More by Mumford & Sons, The Beginning by The Black Eyed Peas and The Lady Killer by CeeLo Green were all released in 2010 but did not reach their peak until 2011. Crazy Love by Michael Bubl\u00e9, Lungs by Florence + the Machine, Only Revolutions by Biffy Clyro and The Hits by Will Young were the albums from 2009 to reach their peak in 2010. Thirteen artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 2010. Ellie Goulding, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Olly Murs and Tinie Tempah were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 album in 2010. The first number-one album of the year was Crazy Love by Michael Bubl\u00e9. Overall, thirty-two different albums peaked at number-one in 2010, with thirty-two unique artists hitting that position. ==Background== ===Multiple entries=== One-hundred and fifty-two albums charted in the top 10 in 2010, with one-hundred and thirty- six albums reaching their peak this year (including 1962\u20131966, 1967\u20131970 and Simply Red 25: The Greatest Hits, which charted in previous years but reached a peak on their latest chart run). Thirteen artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 2010. Glee Cast had five top 10 albums, the most of any artist this year. Andr\u00e9 Rieu, The Beatles, The Black Eyed Peas, Cheryl, JLS, the Johann Strauss Orchestra, Lady Gaga, Peter Andre, Rihanna, Robbie Williams, Susan Boyle and Take That were the acts who had two top 10 albums this year.
