Army general is normally the highest rank used in peacetime. The equivalent position in the Commonwealth, U.S., and several other countries is simply termed general, four-star rank, or informally \"full general\". The title \"army general\" should not be confused with the rank \"general of the army\", which is more senior, and corresponds to other countries' marshal or field marshal. ==See also== *Army general (Soviet Union) *Army general (Kingdom of Yugoslavia) *Army general (Russia) *Army general (France) *Army general (East Germany) *General officer *Ranks and insignia of NATO armies officers ==References== Category:Military ranks Category:Army generals ",
