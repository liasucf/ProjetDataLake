After spending two years at Zaragoza, G\u00e1llego moved on and signed for Huesca in 2010. In 2012, after spending two years in the team's youth academy, he gave his professional debut for their second team, Almud\u00e9var, where after a great first season his duties where also required in the first team. He gave his debut for Huesca in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, Spain's third tier, in the 2013\u201314 season. In January 2014, he left Huesca after three years, signing for Sari\u00f1ena, where he continued gaining experience in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. Staying for only 6 months, G\u00e1llego then went on and continued his career at Cacere\u00f1o, staying for two seasons. In June 2017, G\u00e1llego signed for Lealtad, but again only spent 6 months with the team, as his transfer to Greek Superleague team AEL got announced on 20 December 2016. On 4 January 2017, he made his official debut for AEL against Veria, scoring in his debut and being named man of the match. However, after 6 months he just managed to make five more appearances for AEL and was released at the end of the season. After his spell in Greece, he left Europe and signed for Nicaraguan side Real Estel\u00ed. In his 6 months with the club, G\u00e1llego managed to make a great impact and caught the eye of European clubs. On 31 August 2018, he returned to Europe signing for Albanian team Kastrioti. Not being able to showcase his talent and abilities for his new team, he was released on 7 November 2018 after just appearing in two league matches, one cup game resulting in one goal. On 2 January 2019, his return to Spain got announced, where he signed for Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B club Teruel. After fulfilling his 6-month contract with Teruel, G\u00e1llego returned to Nicaragua signing for Managua in the Liga Primera de Nicaragua. On 12 December 2019, Managua won the Copa de Nicaragua, after beating Diriang\u00e9n 4\u20133 in penalties. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Club ! rowspan=\"2\" |Season ! rowspan=\"2\" |League ! colspan=\"2\" |League ! colspan=\"2\" |CupIncludes appearances in the Copa del Rey, Greek Football Cup, Kupa e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb and Copa Nicaragua ! colspan=\"2\" |ContinentalIncludes appearances in the CONCACAF League ! colspan=\"2\" |OtherIncludes appearances in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B playoffs, Apertura playoffs and Clausura playoffs ! colspan=\"2\" |Total |- !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Almud\u00e9var |2012\u201313 | rowspan=\"2\" |Tercera Divisi\u00f3n | rowspan=\"2\" |53 | rowspan=\"2\" |3 | colspan=\"6\" rowspan=\"2\" |\u2013 | rowspan=\"2\" |53 | rowspan=\"2\" |3 |- |2013\u201314 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !53 !3 ! colspan=\"6\" |\u2013 !53 !3 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Huesca |2013\u201314 |Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B |1 |0 |0 |0 | colspan=\"4\" |\u2013 |1 |0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !1 !0 !0 !0 ! colspan=\"4\" |\u2013 !1 !0 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Sari\u00f1ena |2013\u201314 |Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B |10 |0 | colspan=\"6\" |\u2013 |10 |0 |- bgcolor=\"gainsboro\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !10 !0 ! colspan=\"6\" |\u2013 !10 !0 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Cacere\u00f1o |2014\u201315 | rowspan=\"2\" |Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B |32 |0 | colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"2\" |\u2013 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2013 |32 |0 |- |2015\u201316 |27 |7 |2 |0 |29 |7 |- bgcolor=\"gainsboro\" ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !59 !7 ! colspan=\"4\" |\u2013 !2 !0 !61 !7 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Lealtad |2016\u201317 |Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B |17 |0 | colspan=\"6\" |\u2013 |17 |0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !17 !0 ! colspan=\"6\" |\u2013 !17 !0 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |AEL |2016\u201317 |Superleague |6 |1 |0 |0 | colspan=\"4\" |\u2013 |6 |1 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !6 !1 !0 !0 ! colspan=\"4\" |\u2013 !6 !1 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Real Estel\u00ed |Clausura 2018 |Liga Primera de Nicaragua |14 |7 | colspan=\"4\" |\u2013 |4 |1 |18 |8 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !14 !7 ! colspan=\"4\" |\u2013 !4 !1 !18 !8 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Kastrioti |2018\u201319 |Kategoria Superiore |2 |0 |1 |1 | colspan=\"4\" |\u2013 |3 |1 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !2 !0 !1 !1 ! colspan=\"4\" |\u2013 !3 !1 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Teruel |2018\u201319 |Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B |6 |0 |0 |0 | colspan=\"4\" |\u2013 |6 |0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !6 !0 !0 !0 ! colspan=\"4\" |\u2013 !6 !0 |- | rowspan=\"4\" |Managua |Apertura 2019 | rowspan=\"3\" |Liga Primera de Nicaragua |16 |6 |7 |5 |2 |1 |4 |1 |29 |13 |- |Clausura 2020 |17 |7 |1 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2013 |4 |2 |22 |9 |- |Apertura 2020 |11 |3 |4 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |15 |3 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !44 !16 !12 !5 !2 !1 !8 !3 !66 !25 |- bgcolor=\"gainsboro\" ! colspan=\"3\" |Career Total !212 !34 !13 !6 !2 !1 !14 !4 !241 !45 |} == Honours == Managua *Liga Primera de Nicaragua runner-up: Apertura 2019, Clausura 2020 *Copa Nicaragua: 2019; runner-up: 2020 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from Huesca Category:Spanish footballers Category:Aragonese footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:AD Almud\u00e9var players Category:SD Huesca footballers Category:CP Cacere\u00f1o players Category:CD Lealtad players Category:Super League Greece players Category:AE Larissa FC players Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Expatriate footballers in Nicaragua Category:Real Estel\u00ed F.C. players ",
