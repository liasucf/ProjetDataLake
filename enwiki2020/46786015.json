Judy Garland at Quaglino's on her wedding day with her wedding cake Quaglino's, nicknamed Quag's, is a restaurant at 16 Bury Street, St James's, London owned by D&D; London and originally opened by Terence Conran in 1993. The name comes from the original Quaglino's founded by Giovanni Quaglino in 1929, with his brother Ernest as headwaiter. The restaurant was highly popular with the British establishment from the 1930s through the 1950s, and was a popular haunt of London's caf\u00e9 society. Its reputation faded in the 1960s, as it was sold to a succession of hotel companies, and it closed in 1977. ==Origins== Giovanni \"John\" and his brother Ernesto \"Ernest\" Quaglino were immigrants from Piedmont, Italy, probably from Riva presso Chieri.Ministero delle Finanze, Elenco dei Contribuenti Possessori di Redditi delle Categorie B e C, Provincia di Torino, 1930, p. 140 John was the ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel at the Martinez Hotel in Cannes, and later worked at The Savoy in London with Giovanni \"John\" Sovrani. Sovrani left The Savoy to start Sovrani's Restaurant in Jermyn Street in 1927, taking Quaglino with him, however, according to rumour, Sovrani took too much interest in Quaglino's wife, causing him to resign as head waiter in 1929. John started Quaglino's in the basement of the St. James's Palace Hotel (later the Meurice) on nearby Bury Street, under the patronage of Lady Furness, and with his brother Ernest as headwaiter. Sovrani's lost a lot of business to Quaglino's and closed in 1931. A version of the rumours was repeated in the Tatler on 6 January 1932 in which a restaurant owner was quoted as saying \"my boss, he pinch my brother's wife, so now I pinch his business\", causing Sovrani to sue the publishers and printers of Tatler for libel.\"High Court of Justice King's Bench Division Libel Action by Restaurant Proprietor Sovrani v. Eyre & Spottiswoode, Limited, and Another.\" The Times, 15 March 1933, p. 4. The defence argued that the words could not apply to Sovrani as his restaurant had already closed by the time they appeared and Quaglino's only brother was not married. The jury, however, found in favour of Sovrani and awarded him \u00a32500 damages with costs.\"High Court of Justice King's Bench Division Restaurant Proprietor's Libel Action: \u00a32,500 Damages Awarded Sovrani v. Eyre & Spottiswoode, Limited, and Another.\" The Times, 16 March 1933, p. 4. Giovanni Sovrani died when the SS Arandora Star carrying around 1500 Italian, Austrian and German internees and enemy aliens to Canada was torpedoed by a German U-boat off the coast of Scotland in July 1940. ==Before WWII== Quaglino's became highly fashionable in the 1930s, due in large part to the Quaglinos' charm. It was patronised by the Mountbattens, Evelyn Waugh, Edward, Prince of Wales and Mrs. Simpson, King Alfonso of Spain, and King Carol of Romania, and the newspaper columnist Charles Graves. Lord Forte recounted that he treated royalty \"with respect but without fuss\", but also made \"every guest... feel that he was the only person who mattered\", regardless of rank. Quaglino's offered dining, dancing, and cocktails until midnight. Leslie \"Hutch\" Hutchinson, one of the first popular black entertainers in Britain, became a regular performer at Quaglino's in the 1930s and 1940s. According to the Sunday People, his affair with Lady Edwina Mountbatten caused her husband Lord Mountbatten to complain to the band leader at Quaglino's that \"Hutch has a p***** like a tree-trunk, and he's f****** my wife right now.\" In the 1930s, romantic novelist Barbara Cartland found a real pearl in an oyster served at Quaglino's. Steak Diane may have been invented at Quaglino's in the 1930s, perhaps by their head chef, Bartolomeo \"Meo\" Calderoni.Caterer & Hotelkeeper 179:53 (1988)\"Meo is brought to book at last\", \"The Times Diary/PHS\", The Times, April 11, 1978, p. 16 The Quaglino brothers left for Italy in 1940 rather than be interned on the Isle of Man as enemy nationals.Richard Whittington, Martin Webb, Quaglino's: The Cook Book, 1995, , section \"Quaglino's Story\" They may have been fascist sympathizers.Judith Walkowitz, Nights Out: Life in Cosmopolitan London, 2012, p. 125cf. Collar the Lot! The restaurant was renamed \"Meurice\" after their departure.Margaret Gaskin, Blitz: The Story of December 29, 1940, p. 416 ==After WWII== The Quaglino brothers returned to England in 1947, with some difficulty,Mr. Anthony Greenwood, Oral Answers to Questions, December 4, 1947 but the restaurant continued to be popular. In 1947, George Soros was a waiter at Quaglino's.Rob Baker, \"Communists, bombs and pigeon with pineapple \u2013 curious tales about three of London's oldest restaurants\", The Telegraph, December 11, 2019 Queen Elizabeth II dined at Quaglino's in 1956, making her the first reigning British monarch to eat at a public restaurant. The restaurant was said to have a table permanently reserved for the regular visits by Princess Margaret, the Duke and Duchess of Kent and Princess Alexandra. John Profumo and his wife made a show of togetherness at a dinner-dance at Quaglino's in 1963, after the scandal of the Profumo affair broke. In March 1969, Judy Garland held the wedding reception for her marriage to Mickey Deans, her fifth, at Quaglino's. The reception was reported to have been poorly attended with more waiters than guests; even Garland's daughter Liza Minnelli failed to attend, saying \"I can't make it Mamma but I promise I'll come to your next one!\". Quaglino's reputation faded in the 1960s, as it was sold to a succession of hotel companies, and it closed in 1977.Richard Whittington, Martin Webb, Quaglino's: The Cook Book, 1995, , section \"Quaglino's Reborn\" ==The new Quaglino's, 1993== Conran Restaurants bought the restaurant in 1993 and revived the name, aiming to revive the spirit of the original: The restaurant became a staple of the BBC television sitcom Absolutely Fabulous. In 2013, Quaglino's hid a \u00a32000 pearl in an oyster to be served at the restaurant as a publicity stunt based on the incident when Barbara Cartland found a small pearl by accident in the 1930s. In 2014, the restaurant reopened after a \u00a33 million renovation under the new owners of the Conran Restaurants, D&D; London. In 2018, Quaglino's launched its sustainable menu \"Science of Sustainability' featuring sustainably sourced products. ==Chefs== Early in his career, John Torode worked at Quaglino's as a sous chef. ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:Restaurants in London Category:1929 establishments in England Category:1977 disestablishments in England Category:1993 establishments in England Category:Italian restaurants ",
