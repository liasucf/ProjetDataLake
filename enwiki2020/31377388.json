    "text": "View from the endpoint of the peninsula. Hindens rev is a long, narrow, straight peninsula that projects westwards from K\u00e5lland into Dalbosj\u00f6n, the western part of lake V\u00e4nern. Hindens rev is a terminal moraine and is part of what is known as the central Swedish terminal moraine zone. The latter is in turn part of a series of terminal moraines that runs from southern Norway through Dalsland, Skaraborg and \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, continuing under the Baltic Sea into southern Finland and Russia as the Salpausselk\u00e4 moraine which separates lakes Ladoga and Saimaa. These moraines were formed during the Younger Dryas period, about 11,000 years ago, when the ice cap from the last ice age temporarily ceased withdrawing and rocks and other glacial materials emerged from the melting ice were deposited in front of the glacier terminus. The narrow peninsula is about five kilometers long and never wider than 100 meters, usual significantly narrower. Its highest elevation over the level of lake V\u00e4nern is 21 meters. Hindens rev is highest by the mainland, and lowers gradually until it submerges after five kilometers. The formation continues under water as a series of reefs. At high tide its extreme point becomes five small island called Killingarna (\"the [goat] Kids\"). The moraine reappears twelve kilometers away on the western shore of V\u00e4nern, where it is known as Hjortens udde. In addition to pines, rowans, birches and aspens grow on Hindens rev. Several protected plant species also grow there. Hindens rev is a nature reserve classed as riksintresse for nature conservation and outdoors activities. Hindens rev is a popular destination for picnikers and tourists, offering hiking, fishing and birding opportunities in summer and tour skating in winter. == See also== * Salpausselk\u00e4 * V\u00e4nersn\u00e4s * Parkudden Category:Nature reserves in Sweden Category:Geography of V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County Category:Landforms of V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County Category:Tourist attractions in V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland County Category:Peninsulas of Sweden ",
