    "text": "Physaria fendleri is a species of flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae known by several common names, including Fendler's bladderpod, popweed, and lesquerella. ==Distribution== The plant is native to the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is also cultivated in these regions, as it does best in their climates and in local calcareous soils. It requires less irrigation than many other crops, due to its adaptation to life in an arid region. ==Description== Physaria fendleri is a perennial plant in natural habitats. It is cultivated as a winter annual. It produces hairless capsules called siliques which contain 6 to 25 seeds each. ==Uses== The species is best known as the richest source of bladderpod oil. Most Physaria species contain the hydroxy acid lesquerolic acid in their oil with a seed oil content of ~24%. This oil is useful as a replacement for castor oil in some applications due to its ability to form estolides. If the plant becomes more widely cultivated and breeding and refinement techniques are improved, the oil could be used in a number of industries, including cosmetics, coatings, plastics, and lubricants. One obstacle to use is the oil's reddish-brown color, which makes it less valuable for certain applications than the colorless or pale yellow castor oil. Breeding may reduce the pigment load of the plant's oils over time. Breeding may also favor other characteristics in this species, such as its capacity for cultivation in other climates, male sterility to allow better control of pollination, and tolerance for a wider array of soil types. The plant has uses beyond its oil. The seed coat of P. fendleri also contains a useful natural gum which might be viable as a food additive similar to xanthan gum. The mash is high in protein, and has a similar proportion of various amino acids to the soybean. It may prove to be a good animal fodder. ==References== ==External links== *USDA Plants Profile for Physaria fendleri (lesquerella) *USDA.gov: Industrial uses of Physaria fendleri *Hort.purdue.edu: New crop fact sheet for Lesquerella *Hort.purdue.edu: Lesquerella oil in cosmetics *Arizona.edu: \"Lesquerella, an Arizona specialty crop\" fendleri Category:Crops originating from Mexico Category:Crops originating from the United States Category:Flora of Arizona Category:Flora of Chihuahua (state) Category:Flora of Coahuila Category:Flora of Colorado Category:Flora of Durango Category:Flora of New Mexico Category:Flora of Nuevo Le\u00f3n Category:Flora of San Luis Potos\u00ed Category:Flora of Texas Category:Flora of Utah Category:Flora of Zacatecas Category:Flora of the Great Plains (North America) Category:Taxa named by Asa Gray ",
