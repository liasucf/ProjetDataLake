The hull is moderate displacement, the keel is long, and the ballast/displacement ratio is 32 percent. Optional hulls are a centerboard/keel and a deep keel. The sail plan is balanced and designed to be handled by two people.\" ==See also== *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Dickerson 41 *Irwin 41 Citation *Lord Nelson 41 *Morgan Out Island 41 *Newport 41 *Nimbus 42 ==References== Category:Keelboats Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ",
