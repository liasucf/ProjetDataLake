In the middle to late 19th century 'Tretire and Michaelchurch' was a parish in the Weomelow Hundred and the Ross district of Herefordshire, with Ross-on-Wye as its post town. It was in the Ross Union--poor relief provision set up under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834--and the Ross county court division and Harewood's End petty sessional division. The manor belonged to Sir Hungerford Hoskyns, 7th Baronet (1776 - 1862).
