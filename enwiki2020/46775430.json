    "text": "Howard Hunt Pattee (born October 5, 1926) is an American biologist, Professor Emeritus at Binghamton University and Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He graduated at Stanford University in 1948 and completed a Ph.D. there in 1953. ==Contributions== Professor Pattee's main research interests are theoretical biology with a focus on origin of life, artificial life, biosemiotics, semiotic control of dynamic systems, and the physics of codes and symbols. His many contributions to the \"symbol-matter\" problem within the cell have had much influence on theoretical biology, biosemiotics, complex systems and artificial life. ==Present title== * Professor Emeritus, Department of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering, Thomas J.
