    "text": "The 2018 Fed Cup is the 56th edition of the most important tournament between national teams in women's tennis. The 2018 Fed Cup was expected to feature some structural changes, including a 16-team World Group and the introduction of a Final Four event at a neutral, predetermined location. However, the ITF announced shortly before their annual meeting that they were tabling a vote on the changes for at least one year. In one of the biggest shocks in the tournament history, Russia was demoted to the Zonal Groups for the first time in two decades, after consecutive losses to Slovakia and Latvia. The final took place on 10\u201311 November and was won by the Czech Republic. ==World Group== ==World Group Play-offs== The four losing teams in the World Group first round ties and four winners of the World Group II ties will compete in the World Group Play-offs for spots in the 2019 World Group. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- !colspan=4|Participating teams |- !style=\"width:25%;\"| !style=\"width:25%;\"| !style=\"width:25%;\"| !style=\"width:25%;\"| |- !style=\"width:25%;\"| !style=\"width:25%;\"| !style=\"width:25%;\"| !style=\"width:25%;\"| |} ===Seeds=== {| class=wikitable style=\"border:1px solid #AAAAAA;\" |- !Venue!!Surface!!Home Team!!Score!!Visiting Team |- | Minsk, Belarus | Hard (i) | '''''' |align=center| 3\u20132 | |- | Cluj-Napoca, Romania | Clay (i) | '''''' |align=center| 3\u20131 | |- | Wollongong, Australia | Hard (i) | '''''' |align=center| 4\u20131 | |- | Genoa, Italy | Clay | |align=center| 0\u20134 | '''''' |} ==World Group II== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- !colspan=4|Participating teams |- !style=\"width:25%;\"| !style=\"width:25%;\"| !style=\"width:25%;\"| !style=\"width:25%;\"| |- !style=\"width:25%;\"| !style=\"width:25%;\"| !style=\"width:25%;\"| !style=\"width:25%;\"| |- |} ===Seeds=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:1px solid #aaa;\" |- !
