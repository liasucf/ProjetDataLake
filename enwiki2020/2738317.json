It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. The station is operated by Northern Trains. ==History== The station, opened by the CLC on 1 August 1873, was originally known as Farnworth (Widnes), Farnworth being at the time a village north of Widnes, but is now a northern suburb of the town. The station was renamed Widnes North on 5 January 1959, and finally Widnes on 6 May 1968 ( and , on other lines, having closed to passengers in 1964 and 1962 respectively). Plaque Widnes railway station is generally said to be the station where Paul Simon reputedly composed the song \"Homeward Bound\" though some think it more likely that it was Ditton railway station, part of the Widnes Loop Line and the train to London. Simon is quoted as saying \"[i]f you'd ever seen Widnes, then you'd know why I was keen to get back to London as quickly as possible.\"Backtrack - BACKTRACK BRIEFS . . . Northern Echo (Darlington); 21 November 2008; Mike Amos; p. 11 ==Facilities== The railway station is of the standard Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) style. A footbridge connects the two platforms. The station is staffed, but only until early afternoon. There is a car park outside. The station was refurbished in 2009 and as of 2010 houses a station shop and a beauty parlour, though there are still no toilet or waiting facilities for passengers other than the already existent shelter on the Manchester-bound platform. The platforms and footbridge have recently been refurbished. A ticket machine has been installed on the Manchester-bound platform.
