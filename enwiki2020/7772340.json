    "text": "Jorge Miguel de Oliveira Ribeiro (born 9 November 1981) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for Casa Pia AC. Mainly a left back, he can also play as a wing-back or midfielder. He totalled 118 Primeira Liga games and 15 goals, for six clubs including two spells at Benfica, and added over 175 appearances in LigaPro for as many teams. Additionally, he had stints in Russia with Dynamo Moscow and in Spain. Ribeiro earned 30 caps for Portugal at youth level, and represented the country at Euro 2008. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Born in Lisbon, Ribeiro was brought up in S.L. Benfica's youth system. In 2002, he was one of three young players sold to fellow Primeira Liga club Varzim SC, along with Rui Bai\u00e3o and Pepa. In January 2005, after angering his employers Gil Vicente F.C. by an unauthorised absence, he was purchased by the Russian Premier League's FC Dynamo Moscow; unadjusted, he left the team precisely a year after, joining La Liga side M\u00e1laga CF until the end of the season, which ended in relegation. In January 2007, Ribeiro returned to Portugal, joining C.D. Aves still on loan from the Russians. On 4 February, he played his first league match for his new club against S.C. Braga (0\u20131 away loss), as the team he represented again dropped down a level. He would be purchased by Boavista F.C. in July and blossomed as a top flight player, scoring eight league goals during his only campaign, many from free kicks. ===Return to Benfica=== On 24 July 2008, Ribeiro returned to Benfica after a deal was agreed upon in April. Having scored his first goal for them on 22 September in a 4\u20133 win at F.C. Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira, he eventually became first-choice left-back, overtaking Brazilian L\u00e9o. However, Ribeiro soon lost his starting place to David Luiz, and eventually was deemed surplus to requirements. In the 2009\u201310 season, as Benfica won the league and the League Cup, he did not collect one single official appearance, often training separately and choosing to see out his lucrative contract rather than signing with another club. On 16 August 2011, after spending five months on loan to Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es, Ribeiro signed for two years with Granada CF on a free transfer. He only made one official appearance with the Andalusians \u2013 55 minutes against Real Sociedad for the round of 32 in the Copa del Rey (1\u20134 away defeat)\u2013 losing his No. 16 jersey in the winter transfer window and being released from contract on 17 February 2012. ===Later years=== In the summer of 2013, after more than one year out of football, Ribeiro returned to active, penning a one-year contract with S.C. Olhanense but being released less than one month later, still during pre-season play. He subsequently returned to Aves, where he was a regular until his departure. Ribeiro signed a one-year deal with Atl\u00e9tico Clube de Portugal also of the LigaPro in July 2015. After the season ended with relegation to the third tier, he moved to S.C. Farense at that level; after scoring six times in 30 games to win promotion in his second year, he extended his contract until 30 June 2019. In July 2019, the 37-year-old Ribeiro joined Casa Pia A.C. in his hometown, newly promoted to division two. ==International career== Ribeiro made his debut for Portugal in November 2002, against Scotland. He was part of the under-23 team that was eliminated in the group stage at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Greece. Ribeiro did not play a senior game again until a 2\u20132 draw away to Liechtenstein in October 2004. After another two-year absence, he was again called and played as a replacement for right back Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers against Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan on 13 and 17 October, respectively. With eight caps, Ribeiro was selected for the squad that competed in the finals in Austria and Switzerland, as older brother Maniche was left out. He appeared as a substitute in the last group stage match against Switzerland, a 0\u20132 loss that would be his final international. ==Personal life== Jorge's older brother, Nuno, was also a footballer. A midfielder, he represented, among others, Benfica, FC Porto and Chelsea, and the two were teammates at Dynamo Moscow. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Benfica B |1999\u201300 |8||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||8||0 |- |2000\u201301 |16||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||2 |- |2001\u201302 |22||5||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||22||5 |- !Total !46!!7!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!46!!7 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Benfica |1999\u201300 |1||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||2||0 |- |2000\u201301 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2001\u201302 |4||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||0 |- !Total !5!!0!!2!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!7!!0 |- |Santa Clara (loan) |2000\u201301 |3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Varzim |2002\u201303 |30||2||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||32||2 |- |2003\u201304 |23||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||24||2 |- !Total !53!!4!!3!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!56!!4 |- |Gil Vicente (loan) |2004\u201305 |14||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||15||0 |- |Dynamo Moscow |2005 |27||4||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||29||4 |- |M\u00e1laga (loan) |2005\u201306 |5||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||0 |- |Aves (loan) |2006\u201307 |14||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||14||2 |- |Boavista |2007\u201308 |26||8||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||27||8 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Benfica |2008\u201309 |15||1||0||0||2||1||4||0||21||2 |- |2009\u201310 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !Total !15!!1!!0!!0!!2!!1!!4!!0!!21!!2 |- |Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es (loan) |2010\u201311 |14||2||4||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||20||2 |- |Granada |2011\u201312 |0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Aves |2013\u201314 |41||3||4||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||45||3 |- |2014\u201315 |37||2||1||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||41||2 |- !Total !78!!5!!5!!0!!3!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!86!!5 |- |Atl\u00e9tico |2015\u201316 |39||4||0||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||41||4 |- |Farense |2016\u201317 |22||8||3||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||10 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Career total !361!!45!!22!!2!!9!!1!!4!!0!!396!!48 |} ==Honours== Benfica *Ta\u00e7a da Liga: 2008\u201309 Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es *Ta\u00e7a de Portugal runner-up: 2010\u201311 Portugal U-21 *Toulon Tournament: 2001 ==References== ==External links== * * * National team data * * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Lisbon Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Association football midfielders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:S.L.
