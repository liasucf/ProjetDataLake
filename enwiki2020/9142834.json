The Celestial Bed. New York, Delacorte Press, 1987. () The title refers to the \"celestial bed\" marketed by the 18th century sexologist James Graham. One of the theories the book addresses is that certain individuals are ill-adjusted to normal sex, and that this can have grave consequences. The book states that these issues can be solved, but only with the help of sex surrogates. The patients must be taught practical sexual techniques by real people. The book also discusses whether sex technicians \u2014 the people who provide the hands on learning \u2014 are prostitutes. The plot is structured according to the hero's journey technique. The name of the book comes from a famous quack cure for impotence and sterility advocated by the \"doctor\" James Graham.Museum of Hoaxes: Graham's Celestial Bed (Both are a reference to a line in Act I, Scene 5 of Shakespeare's Hamlet.)
