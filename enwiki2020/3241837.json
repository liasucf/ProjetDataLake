    "text": "T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji in Nara , also Ritsu school, is one of the six schools of Nara Buddhism in Japan, noted for its use of the Vinaya textual framework of the Dharmaguptaka, one of the early schools of Buddhism. The Ritsu school was founded in Japan by the blind Chinese priest Jianzhen, better known by his Japanese name Ganjin. Ganjin traveled to Japan at the request of Japanese priests, and established the T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji in Nara. During the Kamakura period, the Ritsu sect was divided into schools at T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji, Kaidan-in, Saidai-ji, and Senny\u016b-ji. However, during the Meiji period, the Ritsu sect was incorporated within the Shingon sect by decree of the Japanese government. Today only T\u014dsh\u014ddai-ji, which resisted the government measures, retains its identity as a Ritsu temple. ==See also== * Buddhism in Japan * Dharmaguptaka * Schools of Buddhism * Vinaya ==References== ==Bibliography== * Bunyiu Nanjio (1886).
