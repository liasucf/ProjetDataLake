The fourth issue contained History of a Coat, its first comic strip. After the fifth issue, the title was changed to The Northern Looking Glass to reflect broader Scottish concerns. ==Format== The fortnightly publication provided satirical snapshots of Glasgow society, British culture and Nineteenth century fashions. Innovations included use of the term \"To be continued\" and word balloons. ==References== Category:Comics magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines established in 1825 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1826 Category:1825 establishments in Scotland Category:1826 disestablishments in Scotland Category:Comics before 1900 Category:Lithography Category:Communication design Category:Graphic design Category:Planographic printing Category:Printmaking ",
