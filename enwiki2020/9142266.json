    "text": "The Herschel Medal is awarded by the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) for \"investigations of outstanding merit in observational astrophysics\". It is awarded for a single piece of work so that younger scientists can be candidates for the award. It is named after the RAS's first president, William Herschel. The medal was first awarded in 1974. The medal has been shared twice, in 1977 and 1986. It has been awarded 22 times to a total of 24 people (23 men, one woman), mostly from the UK. == Medalists == Source: Royal Astronomical Society {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
