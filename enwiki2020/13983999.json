    "text": "John Joseph Bostock (born 15 January 1992) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Toulouse. He made his professional debut for Crystal Palace at the age of 15. In 2008, he signed for Tottenham Hotspur for an initial \u00a3700,000. He played only four games for Tottenham, none of which were in the Premier League, and spent most of his time out on loan in The Football League and with Toronto FC of Major League Soccer. In 2013, he was released and moved to Belgium, representing Royal Antwerp and OH Leuven. In summer 2016, he joined French side Lens where he stayed for one and a half seasons. Born in England, Bostock represented that country up to under-19 level. In 2016, he chose to represent his ancestral Trinidad & Tobago at full international level, although he has yet to appear for them. ==Club career== ===Crystal Palace=== Bostock made his league debut on 29 October 2007 at the age of 15 years and 287 days, playing 20 minutes as a substitute for Ben Watson in a 2\u20130 defeat to Watford at Selhurst Park, making him Palace's youngest ever player. He also became the youngest ever Palace player to start a game, aged 15 years and 295 days, on 6 November 2007 against Cardiff City at Ninian Park. ===Tottenham Hotspur=== Tottenham Hotspur in 2009 On 30 May 2008, Tottenham Hotspur announced the signing of Bostock on their club website. Crystal Palace later issued a statement denying reports that an agreement had been reached with Tottenham. Tottenham and Crystal Palace entered negotiations over the transfer fee, but agreement could not be reached, leading to the sum being decided at a tribunal. On 9 July, the tribunal declared that Tottenham would pay \u00a3700,000 for Bostock, with add-on payments of up to \u00a31.25m dependent on appearances and a further \u00a3200,000 should he make his full international debut. A sell-on clause entitled Crystal Palace to 15% of any profit Tottenham makes from any future sale of Bostock's contract. Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan said he was so disgusted with Bostock and his stepfather that he intended to revoke and refund their Selhurst Park season tickets for 2008\u201309, which the pair had already purchased. Bostock made his first team debut for Spurs in an 8\u20130 pre-season win over Spanish side Tavernes, providing the cross for Aaron Lennon's opening goal. On 6 November 2008, he made his competitive match debut in the 2008 UEFA Cup game against Dinamo Zagreb, coming on as a substitute, and becoming the youngest player ever to play for Spurs at 16 years, 295 days, just beating the previous record-holder Ally Dick by six days. Bostock made a further two appearances in the UEFA Cup that season, however his career with Tottenham stalled after that and had to wait until January 2012 for his next appearance, in an FA Cup match against Cheltenham Town. ===Loan spells=== On 13 November 2009, Bostock joined League One club Brentford on loan for a month, he was handed the number 17 shirt immediately.
