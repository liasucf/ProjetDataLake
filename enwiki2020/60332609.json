Featuring more of his sophisticated and swinging tunes, the album finds Golson in top form on some of his best compositions in years ... Calling to mind the best Blue Note-era recordings, Terminal 1 is one flight of fancy not to be missed\". All About Jazz's Eric J. Iannelli stated \"Benny Golson is indisputably a fine tenor saxophonist, but at the end of his already long career he will probably be best remembered for the quality and breadth of his songwriting ... Terminal 1 is a solid, engaging album, full of some lively ensemble work and a showcase of new interpretations of familiar Golson songs next to at least one fresh chart and the two older standards ... It\u2019s hardly a matter of settling for whatever Golson happens to be offering on account of his notoriety or his age. While Terminal 1 benefits from his experience, it\u2019s as expressive and buoyant as anything Golson was doing with Blakey\u2019s Jazz Messengers lineup fifty years ago\".Iannelli, E. J., All About Jazz Review, accessed March 26, 2019 JazzTimes' David Franklin observed \"As a player, Golson remains an awesome modern mainstream improviser, able to craft captivating and emotion-laden melodic lines while sailing through the chord changes with the ease afforded by his ultrasharp composer\u2019s ear\".Franklin, D., JazzTimes Review, accessed March 26, 2019 == Track listing == All compositions by Benny Golson except where noted # \"Terminal 1\" \u2013 8:12 # \"Killer Joe\" \u2013 6:54 # \"Caribbean Drifting\" \u2013 6:27 # \"Park Avenue Petite\" \u2013 7:47 # \"Blues March\" \u2013 6:54 # \"Sweet Georgia Brown\" (Ben Bernie, Maceo Pinkard, Kenneth Casey) \u2013 5:34 # \"Cherry\" (Don Redman, Ray Gilbert) \u2013 8:32 # \"In Your Own Sweet Way\" (Dave Brubeck) \u2013 10:30 # \"Touch Me Lightly\" \u2013 8:27 == Personnel == *Benny Golson \u2013 tenor saxophone *Eddie Henderson \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn *Mike LeDonne \u2013 piano *Buster Williams - bass *Carl Allen \u2013 drums ===Production=== *John Burk \u2013 producer *Dennis Wall \u2013 engineer == References == Category:Benny Golson albums Category:2004 albums Category:Concord Records albums ",
