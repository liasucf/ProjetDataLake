Wisanger joined in 1910, thereafter several clubs came and went such as Muston. ===Post WWII (1946 \u2013 )=== The Kangaroo Island Football League (KIFL) was formed in 1946 with founding clubs of Kingscote and Wisanger. They were joined by Parndana, American River and Nepean Bay. With the demise of the latter two clubs Western Districts became the fifth club in 1970, with the league maintaining that structure to the present day. The reserve competition was formed in 1958 and the colts competition. Senior colts was formed in 1966 as an U15's competition, in 1976 saw it change to U16's and currently it is U15's. The junior colts was formed in 1970, formerly called the minis, and in 1976 it was changed to U13's and today it is the U12's. ==Notable past players== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Player !

Crabb was a regular in defence and became known as reliable and a great clubman, as proven by him winning best clubman in 2013 and 2018. Crabb was named club captain in 2015, 2016, and 2017 and he was named at Full back in \"The Advertiser Team of the Year in 2015. Crabb retired in 2019 having played 215 league games, over 300 games in total for South Adelaide and he kicked a total of 6 goals. |- | David Stoeckel | Dudley United | 1981\u20131984 | After dominating in the 1984 Grand final against Wisanger, David joined South Adelaide as a twenty year old key forward and went on to have an illustrious career from 1985\u20131997. David played 267 games and kicked 391 goals during this time, and was rewarded with life membership in 1994.

David captained South Adelaide in 1996 and 1997, and was recognised with induction into the SANFL hall of fame in 2015. |- | Roger Williams | Nepean Bay, Kingscote & Dudley United | 1960\u20131990 | Roger Williams is arguably the greatest footballer to play on Kangaroo Island. He stands with the best country footballers in South Australia as a seven time Mail medal winner, one of only four players to achieve this feat. Roger made his senior debut as a 12-year-old for Nepean Bay in 1960, and played for two seasons for them before moving to Adelaide for his schooling. During this time Roger played a handful of reserves games in 1964, and made his senior debut in 1965. He would go on to play 50 league and reserves games over the next three seasons, before being transferred to Glenelg mid 1967 where he played another 4 league games. Roger returned to the island in 1968, playing with Kingscote winning the Mail Medal in 1969, 1972, 1973,1975, 1976 and 1977. He transferred to Dudley United as playing coach in 1978, and set the standard for his new team by winning the medal that year too. Roger credits his brother, John and his colts coach, Charlie Inglis, as his greatest influences in football. |- | Danny Jenkins | Parndana | 1969\u20131975,1986\u20131997? | Jenkins joined SANFL club Norwood, having won the Kangaroo Island Football League's best and fairest award in 1974. He made his senior Redlegs debut, aged twenty-one, in 1976, and ended up winning the club's best first year player award. The twin highlights of his career were the victorious grand finals of 1982 against Glenelg, when he won the Jack Oatey Medal as best afield, and 1984 against Port Adelaide when he was in his only season as captain of the side. He also played in the victorious grand final of 1978 against Sturt. Between 1976 and 1985 he played a total of 198 senior SANFL games and represented South Australia 5 times. |- | Allan Howard | Parndana | 1966\u20131971, 1979\u20131986? | Allan Howard debuted for North Adelaide in 1971 and was a member that year of the Roosters' winning grand final combination against Port Adelaide. He lined up on a half back flank on that occasion, as he did in the following year's premiership decider against the same opposition. Howard also played in the 1973 grand final but despite being one of the best players on view could not prevent the Roosters succumbing to Glenelg by seven points. Early in his SANFL career Howard sometimes played as a ruck-rover but he blossomed after being shifted to a half back flank. Between 1971 and 1978 and in 1981 he played 144 senior games for North and booted three goals. Both prior to commencing with the Roosters and during the gap in his SANFL career Allan Howard played with distinction for the Parndana Football Club on Kangaroo Island where he won a couple of Mail Medals for competition best and fairest in 1980 and 1981. |} ==Grade Structure== As of 2018 the KIFL hosts 5 grades of competition, which include two senior grades, A-Grade & Reserves, and 3 colts grades, U15's, U12's & AusKick (U12's and AusKick do not play for premiership points).
