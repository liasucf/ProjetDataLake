    "text": "Francisco Le\u00f3n Barrios (Andalusian ; born 4 October 1974), known as Paco Le\u00f3n (/ \u02c8pa.ko/), is a Spanish actor, producer, director, screenwriter and activist from Seville, Andalusia. Beginning as a comedy performer, he rose to prominence on channel Antena 3 with sketch show ', and in A\u00edda, playing the main character Luisma. He gained more prominence for portraying Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Riquelme in the Netflix series The House of Flowers, and writing, directing, and starring as Manolo in Movistar's Arde Madrid. He is also a prominent campaigner for HIV/AIDS causes. ==Career== Le\u00f3n's first roles were in comedy television, on Mariquilla R\u00ede Perlas and Castillos en el aire in 1999. These played on Canal Sur, the channel of Andalusia. Le\u00f3n has had success in theatre throughout his career, first appearing on stage in 2001. He moved to Madrid in 2003 to continue his career, where his first big job was impersonating personalities on Homo Zapping, where he was noticed for popular imitations of women like Anne Igartiburu and Raquel Revuelta. He is best known for playing Luisma, a recovering drug addict, on A\u00edda, a role he played for nine years and which garnered him many Best Actor awards. He has also had notable film roles, as an OCD patient in Toc Toc and a playboy in The Tribe. As a voice and dubbing actor, he has had roles in Valiant and Madagascar, and as a film director, his debut was the 2012 Carmina or Blow Up, for which he was nominated for a Goya as Best Directorial Debut. His mother and sister star in the film, and were both nominated for acting Goyas. His third directorial feature was Kiki, Love to Love, in which he stars and was similarly multi- nominated. For his 2014 film, Carmina y am\u00e9n, the El Confidencial writer Juan Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez suggested that he was becoming \"the new Pedro Almod\u00f3var\", particularly highlighting the funeral scene that opens Carmina y am\u00e9n and saying it has \"a poetry only comparable to\" the opening scene of Volver. Fern\u00e1ndez also notes how both Le\u00f3n and Almod\u00f3var are influenced by the women in their lives, that they both often work with a sibling, and celebrate their mothers in their films. In 2018, he created Arde Madrid with wife Anna R. Costa, a black and white miniseries about Ava Gardner, in which he also played Gardner's chauffeur. From 2018 to 2020, he portrayed trans woman Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Riquelme on The House of Flowers. Regarding working on The House of Flowers, Le\u00f3n says working with Ver\u00f3nica Castro was an honour. In 2019, profiling the actor, Dann Dulin wrote that Le\u00f3n's \"persona and popularity are akin to a James Franco or Jake Gyllenhaal\". ==Personal life== Le\u00f3n's mother is Carmina Barrios. He has one sister, Mar\u00eda Le\u00f3n, who is also an actress. Both his mother and sister starred as characters based on themselves in the films Carmina or Blow Up (2012) and Carmina y am\u00e9n (2014), which Paco wrote and directed. Mar\u00eda and Paco also play siblings in The House of Flowers. Le\u00f3n met the Catalan playwright Anna Rodr\u00edguez Costa in 2006 in a play, going on to act in a short she directed later that year; she was also an acting teacher to Mar\u00eda. Le\u00f3n said that at the time they met, he had a boyfriend, but knew that he wanted to be with her. The couple have been together since 2006 and wrote the screenplay for Arde Madrid together. They have a daughter (born 2010), and Costa's son Eloi (born c. 1994) is Le\u00f3n's stepson. Costa also appears in Carmina y am\u00e9n. He is openly bisexual, and actively campaigns for HIV/AIDS causes. He has several friends living with the disease and has worked with organisations including Fundaci\u00f3n Tri\u00e1ngulo, Apoyo Positivo, StopSIDA, and the Fight Against AIDS Foundation since at least 2009, which largely offer support to the LGBT+ community in Spain, as well as fundraising for the work of eminent HIV researcher Bonaventura Clotet. Le\u00f3n has said that he became aware of the AIDS epidemic when Rock Hudson died, but has also had a scare personally. Le\u00f3n became the subject of media attention when he promised to tweet a nude photo of himself after gaining one million Twitter followers, which he did in October 2013; he posted a video running naked across a golf course to celebrate a million followers on Instagram in 2019, following this up with more nudes. He is a relatively private person and does not often give press interviews. ==Filmography== ===Television=== * Castillos en el aire (1999) on Canal Sur * Jet Lag (2000) * Moncloa, digame on Telecinco, FDF * Homo Zapping on Antena 3 TV (2003\u20132005) * 7 vidas on Telecinco (2004, 2005) * A\u00edda on Telecinco (2005-2014) * Planeta Finito on La Sexta (2007) * \u00c1caros on Cuatro (2007) * La peste on Movistar+ (2017) * The House of Flowers (La Casa de las Flores) on Netflix (2018) * Arde Madrid (Madrid on Fire), Movistar (2018) ===Films=== * Amar y Morir en Sevilla, Don Juan Tenorio (2001) by Victor Barrera * Asalto informatico (2002) * La vida mancha (2003) * Recambios (2004) * La Dama Boba (2006) * Los m\u00e1nagers (2006) * Mediterranean Food (2009) * Quickie Love Is So (2016) *Queens (Reinas) (2006) *3 Bodas dem\u00e1s (2013) *Kiki, Love to Love (2016) *7 A\u00f1os (2016) *Embarazados (2016) *Toc Toc (2017) * La tribu (2018) ===Short films=== * La grieta by Enrique L\u00f3pez de Haro * D\u00edas rojos (2004) * Con lengua (2006) by Anna R.
