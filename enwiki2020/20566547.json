    "text": "Sonny, Please is a 2006 album by jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins. It was released on the Doxy label and features performances by Rollins, Clifton Anderson, Bobby Broom, Bob Cranshaw, Steve Jordan, Kimati Dinizulu, and Joe Corsello. ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Jeff Tamarkin awarded the album 3.5 stars, stating: \"Most of his playing here is relatively easygoing. Rollins still enjoys taking it to the limit, just not as often as he once did. He doesn't need to, though; with nothing left to prove, he can afford to stand back and just enjoy being Sonny Rollins.\"Tamarkin, J.
