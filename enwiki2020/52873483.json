After finishing school, instead of going to veterinary college as his mother wanted, in the fall of 1935 he chose to go to work as a trainer at the farm of William Latta in River Hebert, Nova Scotia. Within a few years Joe O'Brien had become a dominant force in racing in the Maritime Provinces.Reprint of the February 1955 Hoof Beats magazine story by Jim Harrison titled \"Little Joe Is Big Joe Now!
