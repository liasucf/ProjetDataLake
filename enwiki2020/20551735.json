Kirkegaarden on it was in 1894 ca. two alen (1.26 meter) high, ca. 37 alen (23.23 meters) from north to south, and ca. 50 alen (31.39 meters) from east to west. The excavation in 1898 unearthed there a one foot to two feet (0.31 to 0.63 meter) high as well as four feet and six inches (1.41 meter) thick foundation of raw boulders, down to 130 centimeters below the surface of the earth, which several places were laid around driven down oak piles. Down to 85 centimeters below the surface of the earth there was on top of the foundation remnants of a wall core of smaller fieldstones and brick fragments in ample lime, which was covered with large medieval bricks. When the monastery was torn down, the large medieval bricks were first removed, after which the wall core was toppled outward. Pieces of the toppled wall were till then up to seven alen (4.39 meters) high, but on top there was probably courses entirely of brick.Mehlsen, Ejnar (1919).

Randers, Denmark: Randers Amts Historiske Samfund, p. 53 The foundation was of a building's north-eastern corner, which was ended flatly toward east, and inside it was 30 feet (9.42 meters) on each side. Nearby remains indicated that the foundation was continued toward north from the building's north-west, which is why the building probably was the church's chancel. The monastery's probable floor plan. The mapping in 1925 indicated that the foundation north of the church's chancel was of the monastery's 49 meters long and 10 meters wide eastern wing, which was divided into four rooms. The sacristy was apparently nearest the church.Lorenzen, Vilhelm (1933). De danske benediktinerklostres bygningshistorie. Copenhagen, Denmark: G. E. C. Gad, p. 326 The mapping indicated also that the eastern wing was built to the monastery's northern wing, in which there probably was a ca. two and a half alen (1.57 meter) wide open cloister. Also the monastery's western wing was indicated,Lorenzen, Vilhelm (1933). De danske benediktinerklostres bygningshistorie. Copenhagen, Denmark: G. E. C. Gad, pp. 96-97 and between the wings there was a courtyard which was open toward south, with a stone-lined well in the middle and buried skeletons around. Straight in front of the courtyard was another stone-lined well \u2013 this with stairs. Altogether the monastery was measured to be ca. 57 meters from north to south and 47 meters from east to west. In 1529 there was kitchen, priest kitchen, scullery, basement, a food loft and a granary in the monastery, as well as perhaps rooms for labourers and guests, and the monastery owned a home farm with a flour house.Lorenzen, Vilhelm (1933). De danske benediktinerklostres bygningshistorie. Copenhagen, Denmark: G. E. C. Gad, p. 97 On a plot of heavy boulders north of the monastery stood a watermill, and curved around east of the monastery was a ditch with water. South-west of the monastery was its fishpond. From the monastery lead a road across the bog to a ca. 40 square meters flat space at the bottom of the gully Lausdal,S\u00f8nderhald Egnsarkiv. LAUSDAL, SLUGT VED SOFIEKLOSTER. https://arkiv.dk/vis/2167729 [Retrieved 2016-11-13] where at the Well of Saint Lawrence there was a stone wall, and where in 1850 was found a 10 alen (6.28 meters) long tree pump. In the beginning of the 18th century were also found skeletons in walled and at the top vaulted graves on the location, which consequently was the monastery's graveyard, and again late in the 18th century as well as in 1849.Caspersen, Erling (1977).
