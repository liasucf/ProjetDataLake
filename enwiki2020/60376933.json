    "text": "MIT Building 46, the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences The Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, engages in fundamental research in the areas of brain and neural systems, and cognitive processes.https://bcs.mit.edu/about-bcs The department is within the School of Science at the MIT and began initially as the Department of Psychology founded by the psychologist Hans-Lukas Teuber in 1964.https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/07/archives/hanslukas-teuber-is-dead-in- caribbean-mit-psychology-department.htmlhttps://bcs.mit.edu/news- events/newsletter/spring-summer-2015/department%E2%80%99s-founders In 1986 the MIT Department of Psychology merged with the Whittaker College integrating Psychology and Neuroscience research to form the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.https://bcs.mit.edu/content/department-psychology-merges- whittaker-college-become-department-brain-and-cognitive ==Research == The department aims to understand the basic processes of intelligence and brain processes. It has four main themes of research:http://catalog.mit.edu/schools/science/brain-cognitive-sciences/ ;Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience: This deals with biology of neurons and cellular physiology.https://bcs.mit.edu/research/cellular-molecular- neuroscience ;Systems Neuroscience: This deals with developing models of cognitive processes at the neural level. This includes developing algorithms and mathematical models of neural activity.https://bcs.mit.edu/research/systems-neuroscience ;Cognitive Science: This engages in the research of mind through the interdisciplinary approaches of psychology, computer science, mathematics and linguistics for the experimental analysis and mathematical modeling of cognitive processes. The Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences works in collaboration with the McGovern Institute and the Picower Institute, also at the MIT.https://bcs.mit.edu/research/cognitive- sciencehttp://catalog.mit.edu/schools/science/brain-cognitive-sciences/ ;Computation: This deals with the development of theoretical models that explains the processes of memory, language and reasoning using computer simulations and computational models.https://bcs.mit.edu/research/computation The Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences work in close collaboration with the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and the Computer Science department and the Centre for Biological and Computational Learning at the MIT.https://bcs.mit.edu/research/cognitive- sciencehttp://catalog.mit.edu/schools/science/brain-cognitive-sciences/ ==Researchers== The Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences has had several prominent scientists these include: {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:left;\" |- !style=background:navajowhite|Researcher !style=background:navajowhite|Field |- |Steven Pinker|| Cognitive Psychologist https://news.stanford.edu/news/2004/november3/story-1103.html |- |Tomaso Poggio|| Mathematical Cognitive Scientist https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/tomaso-poggio/ . |- |Joshua Tenenbaum ||Mathematical Cognitive Psychologist https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/joshua-tenenbaum |- |} ==See also== * McGovern Institute * Picower Institute ==References== Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology Category:Cognitive science research institutes Category:Neuroscience research centers in the United States Category:Research institutes in the United States Category:Psychology institutes Category:Scientific organization stubs Category:Cognitive science ",
