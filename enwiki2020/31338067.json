Although construction began in late 1915, a shortage of rails impeded progress and, after suspending work in 1920 for some two years, the line opened on 24 February 1923.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Boolarong Press 1990 Stops were established at Barlil, Byee, Gueena, Mondure, Kawl Kawl, Hivesville and Kinleymore en route to Proston. The Windera railway line branched off at Barlil. A mixed service was provided three times a week for this and, between 1938 and 1964, a rail motor service operated to and from Gympie. Proston timber mill and butter factory accessed the line until both closed and only spasmodic grain traffic continued until line closure. The thirty kilometre section between Byee and Proston was closed on 25 January 1993 and from Barlil to Byee was suspended in May 1999. The branch line from Barlil to Windera was closed on 1 July 1961. == References == ==External links== * 1925 map of the Queensland railway system Category:Closed railway lines in Queensland Category:Railway lines opened in 1923 Category:Railway lines closed in 1993 Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in Australia Category:1923 establishments in Australia ",
