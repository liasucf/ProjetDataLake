It was assumed by doctors that this was a result of growth, but she was later diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma, a cancerous bone tumor, on her right leg. The tumor kept her hospitalized and she experienced many regular cancer symptoms, such as hair loss, trouble walking, and acid reflux disease, as she was unable to eat many foods. During her treatment with chemotherapy, she began writing songs about the way she felt.
