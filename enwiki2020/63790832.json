    "text": "The gens Javolena, occasionally found as Javolenia, was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Few members of this gens appear in history, but two of them attained the consulship, one under Domitian, and the other in the time of Antoninus Pius. ==Origin== The nomen Javolenus belongs to a class of gentilicia formed using the suffix ', typically of Umbrian and Picentine origin.Chase, p. 118. Based on a number of inscriptions from Iguvium in Umbria, historian Anthony Birley concludes that the various names of Lucius Javolenus Priscus point to this as the likely origin of the family. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Javoleni were Gaius, Lucius, and Marcus, the three most common names in all periods of Roman history. The only other praenomen found in inscriptions of this family is Sextus. ==Members== * Gaius Octavius Tidius Tossianus Lucius Javolenus Priscus, legate of the Legio III Augusta and Legio IV Flavia Felix, and consul suffectus in AD 86.
