From 1729 to 1740, Blach, Jacob Severin and Rasmus Sternberg held a monopoly on trade on Northern Norway (then known as Finmarken). In 1763 he was appointed to managing director of the General Trade Company (Det almindelige handelskompagni). In 1764 he was appointed to the managing board of Kurantbanken. Blach was appointed Kancellir\u00e5d in 1746, Justitsr\u00e5d in 1749 and Etatsr\u00e5d in 1755. His trading company was passed on to his son Christian Schaarup Blach. It was for a while in partnership with wit Niels Ryberg and later with Erich Erichsen. ==Personal life== Blach married Kl\u00f8cker's step daughter Birgitte Mangor (. 1699 - 17 January 1778) in the Church of Holmen on 17 November 1723. She was the daughter of city councilor and city builder (stadskondukt\u00f8r) Elovius Mangor (c. 1662\u20131714) and Johanne Herforth (1681\u20131756).
