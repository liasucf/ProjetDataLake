But stretched over 16 tracks, the forced minimalism begins to wane in appeal.\" (Roch Parisien, Allmusic) *\"The Muffs is a powerful pop-punk album that has Ramones-styled power-chord rockers in addition to more laidback and soothing numbers. \" (Matt Carlson, Billboard/Allmusic) *\"You'd have to reach all the way back to Blondie's Plastic Letters to find punkish power pop this endearing.\" (Jim DeRogatis, Chicago Sun-Times) *\"PERHAPS it's post-punk integrity that makes \"The Muffs\" such an uneven affair, but it's probably just incompetence. The debut album from this half-female, half-male LA quartet has its bristly moments - notably the 31-second \"Stupid Jerk,\" a cover of an Angry Samoans rant.\" (Mark Jenkins, The Washington Post) ==References== ==External links== * * * *The Muffs Discography from Billboard.com Category:The Muffs albums Category:1993 debut albums Category:Warner Records albums ",
