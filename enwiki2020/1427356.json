    "text": "The Cadillac DTS (short for DeVille Touring Sedan) is a full-size luxury sedan that was produced by Cadillac. It replaced the Cadillac DeVille as Cadillac's largest luxury car for the 2006 model year. This renaming followed new nomenclature conventions set by the earlier CTS and STS. The first version of the DTS was initially shown at the 2005 Chicago Auto Show on February 9. The DTS remained in production until 2011. ==Production and specifications== Cadillac DTS The front-wheel drive DTS was manufactured at GM's Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly factory from July 2005 through May 2011. Base price of the entry DTS at time of introduction was US$41,195 ($ in current dollars) which was over 10% lower than the DeVille model it had replaced. One major feature change from the DeVille to the DTS was the elimination of standard 6-passenger seating configuration for non-limousine models. However, such capability remains an optional feature for fleet clients. Even though priced less than the rear-wheel drive STS, the DTS is longer than the STS. The DTS has standard industry features including multiple airbags, bi-functional xenon high-intensity discharge HID headlamps, leather seating, and power seats. Options include navigation system, Magnetic Ride Control (magnetic ride control on performance models only), moonroof, chrome wheels, heated/cooled seats, and a heated steering wheel. A new DTS Platinum edition was released in 2007 with special interior trim, badging, and other luxury amenities. The DTS incorporates the updated GM G-platform (GM chose to continue referring to it as the K platform, as denoted by the 4th letter in the VIN), and is powered by a transverse 32V Northstar V8, which produces in \"Standard\", \"Luxury\" and \"Premium\" trims. The DTS Platinum is equipped with version. GM phased out all GM fender badges from vehicles during the 2010 model year, including those on the Cadillac DTS. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Model !Year !Engine !Power !Torque |- |rowspan=2|Standard Luxury I, II, III||2006||rowspan=3|4.6 L Northstar LD8 V8|| at 5200 rpm|| at 4400 rpm |- |2007\u20132008||rowspan=2| at 6000 rpm||rowspan=2| at 4400 rpm |- |Standard Luxury Premium||2009\u20132011 |- |rowspan=2|Performance||2006||rowspan=3|4.6 L Northstar L37 V8|| at 5600 rpm|| at 4400 rpm |- |2007\u20132009||rowspan=2| at 6300 rpm||rowspan=2| at 4500 rpm |- |Platinum||2008\u20132011 |- !colspan=5| |} ===DTS-L=== 2008 Cadillac DTS-L Especially for the limousine market, the lightly stretched DTS-L was released in November 2006 for the 2007 model year. Developed and finished by Accubuilt, this version was being touted as having greater rear legroom. Early DTS-L Cadillacs are easily recognized by the wider rear C-pillar, similar to the one used on the older Fleetwood 75 Series. This was necessitated by the use of the standard length DTS rear door, which left a strange-looking space between the rear wheelwell and door. In 2008 a new version, with longer rear doors, was introduced. This change also meant that the C-pillars became considerably slimmer. Despite these efforts, the low production DTS-L soon disappeared from the marketplace. ====Other uses==== Cadillac DTS hearse The DTS was available as a 'coachbuilder' chassis for aftermarket conversion into either limousines, or hearses. The limousine model was designated V4U, and the hearse model was designated B9Q. These were only available to manufacturers named as Cadillac Master Coachbuilders, meaning they were certified by General Motors to modify them. The coachbuilder chassis are an incomplete car, with no rear doors, trunk, rear windshield, and other parts not used during the conversion. These models also included 8 lug wheels, upgraded suspension components, as well as a transmission cooler. ===End of production=== The last DTS rolled off the assembly line at 11:51 a.m. on May 27, 2011. ==Presidential State Car== U.S. President George W. Bush A specially designed and outfitted armored vehicle with DTS styling and a high- roof fitted to a GM four-wheel drive chassis was debuted in the second inauguration of U.S. President George W. Bush, which also served as the debut for the DTS before its official debut at the Chicago Auto Show. While details of the modified vehicle, codenamed \"Stagecoach\", remain classified, previous such vehicles indicate that it would have been upgraded with advanced armor and safety features in order to protect the president from various threats. Shorter armoured DTS are also the Vice President of the United States cars in the USA at least since 2010. A modified DTS was also used by former Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper. ==Yearly American sales== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Calendar Year !Total sales |- |2005 |23,322 |- |2006 |58,224 |- |2007 |51,469 |- |2008 |30,479 |- |2009 |17,330 |- |2010 |18,640 |- |2011 |11,589 |- |2012 |465 |} ==Next generation== The next full-size front- wheel drive Cadillac sedan was the XTS which went on sale in June 2012 as a 2013 model. A second full-size sedan, the rear-wheel drive CT6, was added to the lineup in 2016. Prior to bankruptcy, GM had considered a rear-drive sedan, powered by the new Ultra V8 engine (replacement for the Northstar), to bow for 2010. GM later stopped development of new North American Zeta-based models and canceled the Ultra V8 engine. ==References== ==External links== * Official Cadillac America Forum *2006-2010 Cadillac DTS: Overview *Official US website DTS Category:Full-size vehicles Category:Luxury vehicles Category:Front-wheel- drive vehicles Category:Sedans Category:Cars introduced in 2005 Category:2010s cars Category:Limousines Category:Flagship vehicles ",
