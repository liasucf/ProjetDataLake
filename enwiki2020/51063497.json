    "text": "Streshnevo () is a station on the Moscow Central Circle of the Moscow Metro that opened in September 2016. The station is in the border of the Sokol and Shchukino districts of Moscow; however the station's name comes from the adjacent Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo District. The original name was slated to be Volokalamskaya; but the city government agreed to change the name prior to the start of service. There is a large gap between the platform and the cars at this station. In 2016, during a test run, one of the trains was scratched by the platform as it passed. Although the ED4 trains will not run on this line, the problem was corrected so that this does not become a problem with future trainsets. ==Transfers== No transfers to the Moscow Metro are available; however, the station is a short distance from Pokrovskoye-Streshnevo station on the Rizhsky suburban railway line of the Moscow Railway. ==References== == External links == * mkzd.ru Category:Moscow Metro stations Category:Railway stations in Russia opened in 2016 Category:Moscow Central Circle stations ",
