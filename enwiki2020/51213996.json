According to Palatucci, his father was a \"lifelong Republican\" who was 50-years-old at the time of his birth; during World War II the elder Palatucci served as chair of the ration board of Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. Bill Palatucci says that, due to his father's work schedule, the few times the pair socialized was when they would watch Crossfire together. He is of Italian heritage and has been described as a \"devout Catholic\". Palatucci graduated from Rutgers University where, in his final year, he worked as chauffeur to Thomas Kean during his election campaign for governor of New Jersey. He later went on to receive a J.D. from the Seton Hall University School of Law. ==Career== ===Politics=== Described by some sources as Chris Christie's \"right hand\", Palatucci has worked as an organizer and fundraiser on a number of Republican political campaigns since the 1980s, including serving as New Jersey executive-director of Bush-Quayle 1992. He was elected to the Republican National Committee in 2010 and subsequently went on to serve as co-chair of Christie's 2013 campaign for Governor of New Jersey. Since 2010 Palatucci has served on the New Jersey Apportionment Commission, which is responsible for drawing legislative and congressional district boundaries in New Jersey. He formerly served as chair of the Westfield, New Jersey town recreation commission. During the 2016 Republican National Convention, Palatucci was one of four informally designated \"whips\" on the party's rules committee who had been tapped by the Donald Trump campaign to quash a possible insurrection by the \"Never Trump\" movement. Afterwards, he was appointed by Christie as general counsel for the planned presidential transition of Donald Trump but was removed from this position in November 2016. Palatucci has donated money to a number of Republican political candidates, as well as to Democratic Party congressman Albio Sires. ===Law=== Palatucci began practicing law at the Trenton, New Jersey law firm of Dughi & Hewit in 1993, initially heading the firm's government affairs practice. In 2001 he was made a partner of the firm, whose name was changed to Dughi, Hewit & Palatucci. During the George H.W. Bush presidential campaign of 1992, Palatucci met Chris Christie whom he recruited to the firm, ten years later recommending Christie to Karl Rove for appointment as United States Attorney. Palatucci subsequently went on to serve as general counsel of Community Education Centers, leaving the company in 2012 after his relationship with Christie, then governor of New Jersey, came under media scrutiny; Community Education Centers was the recipient of millions of dollars worth of contracts from the State of New Jersey. As of 2016 he is counsel at Gibbons, P.C. === Halfway Home Controversy === Palatucci was a senior executive for Community Education Centers (CEC), a nonprofit organization that operates halfway homes across the country. In his role as a senior executive, he lobbied for the Center to have increased state aid. Ultimately the inmates were being diverted from entering public prisons where stricter restraints would prevent attacks and assaults by escaped inmates, according to a lawsuit. In 2012 a lawsuit by law enforcement unions violations of state law by acing county inmates into the care of Palatucci\u2019s nonprofit. The county which filed the lawsuit was Essex County which is led by County Executive Joe DiVincenzo, a democrat ally whom endorsed Christie\u2019s reelection. Community Education Centers came under scrutiny for avoiding pay-to-play laws through its shell company, Education and Health Centers of America.https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/media/publications/report_on_essex_county_nj_immigration_detention_expansion.pdf The avoidance of such regulations led to the Essex awarding Community Education Centers a county contract. In 2011 New Jersey's state comptroller issued a report highlighting that about half of the state's $62M half-way home contracts were held by Education and Health Centers of America. Although laws requiring that such programs be non-profit, CEC's contracts were paid to its for-profit by using its political connections. It is believed that the agreement to allow the for-profit to operate was struck either between Palatucci or Chris Christie. In 2010 CEC's political contributions were at $110,000. A New York Times investigation uncovered Palatucci\u2019s lobbying efforts by Palatucci on behalf of Community Education Centers. In 2010 Governor Christie\u2019s budget increased funding for halfway homes, increases as large as $3.1M. Assaults in the halfway homes led to lawsuits, one which arose from an inmate being strangled to death. Derek West Harris was murdered by three other inmates, highlighting the dangers that continued at Community Education Center\u2019s Essex County facility known as Delaney Hall. Harris\u2019s murder led to an investigation by Essex County which ultimately decided not to press any charges. \\----[1]https://www.nj.com/essex/2012/08/lawsuit_charges_essex_county_c_1.html [2]https://www.nj.com/politics/2013/06/essex_county_executive_joseph_divincenzo_endorses_christie.html [3]https://njmonthly.com/articles/jersey-living/ready-for-re-entry/ ==Personal life== Palatucci is married and has three daughters.
