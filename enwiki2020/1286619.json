Skola street, Madona Main street, Madona, in 1918 ==History== The surrounding area of Madona had been populated in earlier times, which is confirmed by discoveries of old burial grounds in the city's vicinity. Madona is first mentioned in writing in 1461, when Archbishop Sylvester began renting the lands of Bir\u017ei Manor. However, the Swedish government placed the land under state control. After the Great Northern War, Madona became property of the Russian Empire. Empress Elizabeth presented Bir\u017ei Manor along with other of Vidzeme's manors to Count Alexander Buturlin. Empress Catherine II bought the lands back as a present to another relative of her court \u2014 the Serbian major-general Maxim Zori\u0107. From the 19th to the beginning of the 20th century, the location of Madona was the fields of Bir\u017ei Manor. According to one version, the name of Madona stems from the adjacent Madona Lake. According to another version, Madona got its name from Bir\u017ei Manor, which German exonym is Madohn or Modohn. For this reason, the railway station situated at the P\u013cavi\u0146as - Valka narrow gauge railway line was named Madona as well. The populated place that slowly emerged around the station also got this name after the erection of the Madona railway station in 1903.Apinis K. Latvijas pils\u0113tu v\u0113sture.
