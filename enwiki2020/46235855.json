There were about 1,000 Chinese laborers forced to work in mines in Nagasaki. During the atomic bomb on Nagasaki, 32 of those Chinese laborers died. The Nagasaki memorial commemorates those 32 Chinese, brought to Japan as forced labourers and made to work as coal-miners, who were in Urakami Prison and died in the atomic bombing of the city on August 9, 1945, during World War II.
