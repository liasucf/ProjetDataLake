    "text": "The Punjab State Super Football League is an Indian semi-professional league for men's association football clubs. The league serves as the top football league in the state of Punjab. The league is currently sponsored by JCT Limited, thus making the official league name the JCT Punjab State Super Football League. ==History== Started in the 1900s, the Punjab State Super Football League was started by the Punjab Football Association, however, during the early days, the league was played as a knock-out tournament which was played out for at least one week and thus the league was not granted \"state league\" status by the All India Football Federation till 2001. In 2001, the Punjab Football Association reformed the league to make it more into a league which would be played on a home and away basis. This thus earned the league its \"state league\" status. In 2014, the Punjab State Super Football League was relaunched with JCT Limited as the title sponsors. The league would also now be played in a number of different cities to promote grassroots football and prize money would be given out to provide an incentive for teams in the league. ==Clubs== The following eight clubs are in the Punjab State Super Football League.https://www.twitter.com/minervapunjabfc/status/1046003829039353856 {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
