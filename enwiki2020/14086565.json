    "text": "The 2004 Carolina Panthers season was the franchise's 10th season in the National Football League and the 3rd under head coach John Fox. It was also the team's 8th season at Bank of America Stadium. They failed to improve upon their record in 2003, a year when they finished the regular season 11\u20135 and ultimately fell 29\u201332 in Super Bowl XXXVIII to the New England Patriots and they finished 7\u20139. Their collapse to a 1\u20137 record start was because of key injuries to their starters including wide receiver Steve Smith Sr., through the first eight games. Despite their late-season rally, they failed to make the playoffs since 2002. They would suffer another collapse in 2016 to a 6-10 record that year after appearing in Super Bowl 50 the previous season. ==Offseason== ===NFL Draft=== ==Personnel== ===Staff=== ===Roster=== ==Schedule== ===Regular season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !style=\"\"| Week !style=\"\"| Date !style=\"\"| Opponent !style=\"\"| Result !style=\"\"| Record !style=\"\"| Venue !style=\"\"| Recap |- |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fcc\" ! 1 | | Green Bay Packers | L 14\u201324 | 0\u20131 | Bank of America Stadium | Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#cfc\" ! 2 | September 19 | at Kansas City Chiefs | W 28\u201317 | 1\u20131 | Arrowhead Stadium | Recap |-align=\"center\" ! 3 | colspan=\"6\" | Bye |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fcc\" ! 4 | October 3 | Atlanta Falcons | L 10\u201327 | 1\u20132 | Bank of America Stadium | Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fcc\" ! 5 | October 10 | at Denver Broncos | L 17\u201320 | 1\u20133 | Invesco Field at Mile High | Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fcc\" ! 6 | October 17 | at Philadelphia Eagles | L 8\u201330 | 1\u20134 | Lincoln Financial Field | Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fcc\" ! 7 | October 24 | San Diego Chargers | L 6\u201317 | 1\u20135 | Bank of America Stadium |Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fcc\" ! 8 | October 31 | at Seattle Seahawks | L 17\u201323 | 1\u20136 | Qwest Field | Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fcc\" ! 9 | November 7 | Oakland Raiders | L 24\u201327 | 1\u20137 | Bank of America Stadium | Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#cfc\" ! 10 | November 14 | at San Francisco 49ers | W 37\u201327 | 2\u20137 | Monster Park |Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#cfc\" ! 11 | November 21 | Arizona Cardinals | W 35\u201310 | 3\u20137 | Bank of America Stadium | Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#cfc\" ! 12 | November 28 | Tampa Bay Buccaneers | W 21\u201314 | 4\u20137 | Bank of America Stadium | Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#cfc\" ! 13 | December 5 | at New Orleans Saints | W 32\u201321 | 5\u20137 | Louisiana Superdome | Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#cfc\" ! 14 | December 12 | St. Louis Rams | W 20\u20137 | 6\u20137 | Bank of America Stadium | Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fcc\" ! 15 | | at Atlanta Falcons | L 31\u201334 | 6\u20138 | Georgia Dome | Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#cfc\" ! 16 | December 26 | at Tampa Bay Buccaneers | W 37\u201320 | 7\u20138 | Raymond James Stadium | Recap |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#fcc\" ! 17 | January 2 | New Orleans Saints | L 18\u201321 | 7\u20139 | Bank of America Stadium | Recap |} ==Standings== ==References== Category:Carolina Panthers seasons Carolina Panthers Season, 2004 Carolina ",
