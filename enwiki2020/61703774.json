Al-Boushi described her nomination as being to the \"Ministry of the Revolution\". She expressed her enthusiasm for the position, stating, ===Women's football=== On 30 September 2019, a 21-team women's football league was launched under al- Boushi's ministership, with both al-Boushi and Aisha Musa present at the match between the Eltahadi and Eldifaa teams, refereed by female umpires. An Islamist hate preacher and supporter of former president Omar al-Bashir, Abdal Hai Youssef, accused al-Boushi of blasphemy and apostasy for having re- introduced women's football to Sudan. Under Article 126.2 of the 1991 version of the Sudanese Penal Code, apostasy is punishable by the death sentence if the accused does not repent. Al-Boushi lodged an official complaint against Youssef. Information Minister Faisal Saleh stated that Youssef's comments constituted an attack against women's rights and said that the Sudanese cabinet requested the Ministry of Justice to take \"the necessary legal measures\" against Youssef. ==References== Category:1986 births Category:Government ministers of Sudan Category:Women government ministers of Sudan Category:Living people Category:People of the Sudanese Revolution Category:Alumni of Imperial College London ",
