Yaound\u00e9, the capital of Cameroon, is 178 km to the west, and Bertoua, the capital of the East Province, lies 108 km to the east. From Ayos, at the border in the Centre Province 145 km (90 mi) from Abong-Mbang, the tar on National Route 10 ends and a dirt road begins.Hudgens and Trillo 1115. Abong-Mbang is the seat of the Abong-Mbang sub-division and the Haut-Nyong division. The town is headed by a mayor.Mahop. Gustave Mouamoss\u00e9 has held the post since August 2002.Elvido. Abong-Mbang is site of one of the East Province's four Courts of First InstanceGeschiere, Witchcraft, 262 note 4. and a prefectural prison.Chrispin 52. The population was estimated at 18,700 in 2001.Institut National de la Statistique 41. According to oral traditions of the Kwassio and Bakola peoples, Abong-Mbang was settled when the Maka-Njem peoples moved northwest from the Great Lakes region of the Congo River. They encountered Pygmy hunter-gatherers and requested their aid as guides through the region. Some of the migrants settled in the vicinity, which they called Bung-Ngwang (\"bathing area in the Nyong River\"). When Europeans arrived in the 19th century, this name was changed to Abong-Mbang. Some migrants continued westward in search of salt; they became the Kwassio and Bakola of Cameroon's coast.Ngima Mawoung 213. German colonisers moved into the area in the late 19th century. They used the Nyong River as a means to reach the wild rubber growing farther inland.Quinn 15. The Germans built a fort and other military and administrative buildings in the town. The fort is today a prefectural prison, and the other buildings serve similar administrative functions.Chrispin 52\u201353.West 191. The French took over in 1919 following Germany's defeat in World War I. Typical Maka house in Abong-Mbang Abong-Mbang is the main settlement of the Maka people, a group who speak a Bantu language of the same name.Fisiy and Geschiere 230. Much of the population farms; important crops include bananas, cocoa, corn, groundnuts, tomatoes, and tubers. Shifting cultivation with no fertiliser is the primary method of agriculture.Boeglin et al. 277. Baka hunter-gatherers live in the surrounding forests. Since colonial times, the government has attempted to better integrate this group into Cameroonian society.Oyono 119. Abong-Mbang is part of the Doum\u00e9-Abong-Mbang diocese of the Roman Catholic Church. The church estimates that 46.7% of the population is Roman Catholic.Cheney. Since Francophone Cameroun's independence in 1960, Abong-Mbang has become an important centre of commerce for the East Province.Peterson 106. This has led to a cosmopolitan influx of immigrants from outside the Maka area. An estimated 99% of males and 95% of females speak French.Sio Bobda. However, among traders, Ewondo is the lingua franca of choice: 72% use Ewondo but only 48% use French in market situations.Wolf 167. By the late 1970s, the government had zoned large areas of the surrounding forest for timber exploitation.Wolfheim 688. Most timber and bush meat traffic from the East Province passes through the town.Rose 2. Union Abong-Mbang FC is the local football (soccer) team.Foimoukom. The town often suffers prolonged cuts to electric power, which the utility company, AES-SONEL, blames on an aging power plant. On 17 September 2007, violent protests against the cuts ended with two protesters dead and 10 others seriously injured.Nsom. Abong-Mbang market Abong-Mbang lies on the South Cameroon Plateau, approximately 700 metres above sea level.Sigha-Nkamdjou et al. 216. The soils are red. The Boumba, Dja, and Nyong rivers rise in the Abong-Mbang region. The Nyong forms the town's northern border and is navigable for about 160 km (100 mi) to Mbalmayo in the Centre Province. The area along the Nyong consists of swampy forests that support populations of raffia palm, such as Raphia montbuttorum.Stuart 58. The area surrounding the town consists of secondary-growth forest of semi- deciduous trees, particularly Sterculiaceae and Ulmaceae; the primary-growth forest has been removed for logging and farming. In some areas, the forests are further degraded and home to other forms of vegetation. The Abong-Mbang Forest Reserve is north of the town. Local wildlife includes populations of western lowland gorillaAlbrecht et al. 71.Redmond 305. and forest elephants. An estimated 100 elephants lived in the Abong-Mbang Forest Reserve in 1998.Barnes et al. 41. The Ntimbe Caves are 18 km (11 mi) south of the town. ==Notes== ==References== *Albrecht, Gene H., Bruce R. Gelvin, and Joseph M. A.
