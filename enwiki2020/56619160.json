He was promoted into the first-team midway through the 2017\u201318 season, making his professional debut on 24 January 2018 in a 1\u20131 draw with Independiente. Four appearances later, on 17 February, Lioi scored a hat-trick during a 5\u20130 league win at the Estadio Gigante de Arroyito against Olimpo.

After twelve appearances for Korona Kielce, Lioi's loan was extended until July - from 30 June - after the end of the 2019\u201320 campaign was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Rosario Central |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"3\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |10||3||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||10||3 |- |2018\u201319 |11||0||7||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||18||0 |- |2019\u201320 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !21!!3!!7!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!28!!3 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Korona Kielce (loan) |2019\u201320 |rowspan=\"1\"|Ekstraklasa |12||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||12||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !33!!3!!7!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!40!!3 |} ==Honours== ;Rosario Central *Copa Argentina: 2017\u201318 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Rosario, Santa Fe Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Poland Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Poland Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Ekstraklasa players Category:Rosario Central footballers Category:Korona Kielce players ",
