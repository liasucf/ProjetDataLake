    "text": "Patricia (\"Trish\") Joan Davies (born December 5, 1956) is a former field hockey player from Zimbabwe, who was a member of the national team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Because of the boycott by the United States and other countries, only one team was available to compete in the Women's Field Hockey Tournament: the hosting USSR team. A late request was sent to the government of the African nation, which quickly assembled a team less than a week before the competition started. To everyone's surprise they won, claiming Zimbabwe's only medal in the 1980 Games. ==References== *sports-reference Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Zimbabwean female field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Zimbabwe Category:Field hockey players at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Zimbabwe Category:Olympic medalists in field hockey Category:Medalists at the 1980 Summer Olympics ",
