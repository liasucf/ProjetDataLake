    "text": "Silvio Pettirossi International Airport is Paraguay's main national and international gateway, located at Luque, serving the capital city, Asunci\u00f3n. It is named after the Paraguayan aviator Silvio Pettirossi and was formerly known as President Stroessner International Airport, after Paraguay's former head of state General Alfredo Stroessner. In 2019, Pettirossi handled a record 1.23 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in the country. It is the main international hub for LATAM Paraguay and Paranair. ==History== The airport serves as hub for LATAM Paraguay, formerly known as TAM Paraguay, TAM Mercosur and LAP (L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Paraguayas). The terminal building splits into two international concourses, the north concourse with 2 gates (5 and 6) and the south concourse with 4 gates (1 to 4). The airport is being expanded to accommodate more gates. Iberia provided direct flights to Asunci\u00f3n from Madrid from 1966 (or perhaps 1968) till the mid-nineties. Lufthansa flew once a week from Frankfurt to Asunci\u00f3n from 1971 to 1980, with DC-10 service starting in 1974. For both airlines, the flights included multiple destinations in South America. On 17 December 2015, the first Air Europa flight arrived from Madrid, Spain to the Silvio Pettirossi International Airport in Luque and provided the first direct connection between Paraguay and Europe in 21 years. ==Accessibility and location== The airport, located within Luque, may be reached from the city of Asuncion via the Aviadores del Chaco Avenue, which runs adjacent to nearby \u00d1u Guas\u00fa Park. Asuncion's local bus line 30-A links the city center with the airport's terminal. The airport is also near the headquarters of CONMEBOL, the continental governing body of association football in South America. ==Airlines and destinations== ===Passenger=== ===Cargo=== ==Statistics== These data show number of passengers movements into the airport, according to the Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Aeron\u00e1utica Civil's Aviation Sector Summary Reports. {| class=\"sortable wikitable toccolours\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !style=\"background:#3830AE;color:white\"| Year !style=\"background:#3830AE;color:white; width:50px\"| 2010 !style=\"background:#3830AE;color:white; width:50px\"| 2011 !style=\"background:#3830AE;color:white; width:50px\"| 2012 !style=\"background:#3830AE;color:white; width:50px\"| 2013 !style=\"background:#3830AE;color:white; width:50px\"| 2014 !style=\"background:#3830AE;color:white; width:50px\"| 2015 !style=\"background:#3830AE;color:white; width:50px\"| 2016 !style=\"background:#3830AE;color:white; width:50px\"| 2017 !style=\"background:#3830AE;color:white; width:50px\"| 2018 !style=\"background:#3830AE;color:white; width:50px\"| 2019 |- | Passengers || 733,810 || 823,207 || 868,534 || 835,323 || 915,425 || 910,554 || 1,033,168 || 1,180,111 || 1,211,576 || 1,239,403 |- | Growth (%) || 23.29% || 12.2% || 5.51% || 3.82% || 9.59% || 0.53% || 13.47% || 14.22% || 2.67% || 2.30% |- | colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| Source: Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Aeron\u00e1utica Civil (DINAC).
