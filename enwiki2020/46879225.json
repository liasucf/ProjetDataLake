This section explains the relation between class number and graduation date. The first class graduated in June 1842. Through much of the school's history, there were two graduating classes per year, in January and June. But in some years, including all years after 1965, there was only one graduating class, in June. The following list details the correspondence between class number and graduation date.Alumni Directory 1995, Associated Alumni of the Central High School of Philadelphia, Bernard C. Harris Publishing, 1995. 1 June 1842 2 June 1843 3 January 1844 4 June 1844 ... 2 classes per year ... 75 January 1880 76 June 1880 77 June 1881 78 June 1882 79 January 1883 ... 2 classes per year ... 95 January 1891 96 June 1891 97 June 1892 ... 1 class per year ... 116 June 1911 117 January 1912 118 June 1912 .... 2 classes per year ... 223 January 1965 224 June 1965 225 June 1966 ... 1 class per year ... Thus, for classes graduating after 1965, the class number equals the graduation year minus 1741. ==See also== *Central High School (Philadelphia) ==References== * ",
