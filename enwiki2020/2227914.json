It is located in the east of the country, bordering the departments of Cerro Largo to the north, Durazno and Florida to the west, Lavalleja and Rocha to the south, while to its east is the lake Laguna Mer\u00edn separating it from the southernmost end of Brazil. ==History== When the First Constitution of Uruguay was signed in 1830, the territory of this department was mostly part of Cerro Largo, one of the nine original departments of the Republic. In 1853 the pueblo (village) of Treinta y Tres was created in its south. It was named after the thirty three honoured patriots who fought for and secured the Independence of the old Provincia Oriental, which became Uruguay. A permanent service of transport by horse-drawn carts between this pueblo and Montevideo was first established in 1866. On 18 September 1884 and by the Act of Ley No 1.754, the department of Treinta y Tres was created out of parts of the departments of Cerro Largo and Minas (the actual Lavalleja Department). ==Population and demographics== As of the census of 2011, Treinta y Tres department had a population of 48,134 (23,416 male and 24,718 female) and 21,462 households Demographic data for Treinta y Tres Department in 2010: *Population growth rate: -0.158% *Birth Rate: 13.80 births/1,000 people *Death Rate: 9.15 deaths/1,000 people *Average age: 33.7 (32.7 male, 34.6 female) *Life Expectancy at Birth: **Total population: 75.97 years **Male: 72.16 years **Female: 79.90 years *Average per household income: 23,122 pesos/month *Urban per capita income: 8,994 pesos/month 2010 Data Source: {| style=\"margin- top:16px;\" |- ! align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left:20px;\" | Main Urban Centres ! align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left:20px;\" | Other towns and villages |- | colspan=2 | Population stated as per 2011 census. |- valign=\"top\" | {| class=\"wikitable\" !
