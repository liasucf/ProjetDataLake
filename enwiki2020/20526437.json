    "text": "Promanullin is a cyclic nonribosomal peptide. It is an amatoxin, all of which are found in the mushroom genus Amanita. ==Toxicology== Like other amatoxins, proamanullin is an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. Promanullin has a specific attraction to the enzyme RNA polymerase II. Upon ingestion, it binds to the RNA polymerase II enzyme, effectively causing cytolysis of hepatocytes (liver cells). ==See also== *Mushroom poisoning ==References== ==External links== *Amatoxins REVISED Category:Peptides Category:Amatoxins Category:Hepatotoxins Category:Indoles ",
