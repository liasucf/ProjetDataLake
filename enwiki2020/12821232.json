    "text": "Merauder is an American metalcore band from New York City, formed in 1990. ==History== The group formed in 1990, establishing itself on the New York hardcore and metal scene through frequent touring and a few demo releases. In 1995, the band released an EP after vocalist Jorge joined, replacing Minus, and toured with Biohazard.[ Biography] at Allmusic.com Upon the release of their 1996 debut, the band scored a slot opening for Fear Factory and toured Europe in 1995 with B\u00f6hse Onkelz. Merauder shifted into crossover thrash and metalcore genres. The band split up following the recording of their 2003 release Bluetality. In 2007, vocalist Jorge Rosado formed his own version of the band. Guitarist Anthony Muccini publicly opposed Rosado's use of the name Merauder, though Muccini himself is not an original member, having replaced the original guitarist, 'Karate\" Chris Bozeth. In 2008, the band announced completion of a new studio album recorded at Big Blue Meenie studios in Jersey City, New Jersey, and embarked on headline tours through Europe, Japan, and the U.S. The band also finished touring with the Haunted and the Agonist. A new album titled God Is I was released June 19, 2009, in Europe and August 11, 2009, through Regain Records. Although there were many difficulties with the European release, Regain has sent the copies only to Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands. In December 2009, Merauder toured around Europe with Entombed and Devious. Their last show was at Eindhoven's Metal Meeting, where they shared the stage with Satyricon, Nile and Legion of the Damned. In May the band went on a tour around the US West Coast (including a festival in Las Vegas with Donnybrook and Grave Maker) and Mexico. In August they joined This is Hardcore festival in Philadelphia, along with Bane, Cro-Mags, Sheer Terror, Death Before Dishonor and more. In February 2011, a fan-made video for the song \"Until\" surfaced online featuring Rosado and Smerdon. In Summer of 2018 Merauder returned to Europe for a full tour with UK metal/hardcore band Climate Of Fear, featuring Rosado and long-time bassist Kevin Mahon and members of Climate Of Fear filling in. ==Discography== *Demo Tape with Minus on vocals (1993) *Split EP with Stigmata (1995, Stone Records) *Master Killer (1996, Century Media) *Demo Tape with Eddie Sutton of Leeway (band) on vocals (1998) *Five Deadly Venoms (1999, Century Media) *Bluetality (2003, Century Media) *Master Killers: A Complete Anthology (Compilation) (2007, Century Media) *God is I (2009, Regain Records) ===Covers=== * 'Downfall of Christ' by Heaven Shall Burn (Album - Iconoclast (Part 1: The Final Resistance)) * 'Life is Pain' by Hatebreed (Album - For the Lions) * 'Master Killer' by God Forbid (Century Media Records's 2CD compilation Covering 20 Years of Extremes) * 'See You In Hell' from Grim Reaper's album See You in Hell (1984) (Featured on the album God is I) * 'Master Killer' by Twitching Tongues,a bonus track on the album World War Live == Band members == ===Current members=== *Jorge Rosado - vocals (1995-2003, 2008-present) * Kevin Mahon - guitar (2018-present) bass guitar (2013-2018) * Dylan Tobia - bass guitar (2018-present) *Rob \"Big Rob\" Castoria - guitar (2018-present) *Jay Shine - drums (2018-present) ===Former members=== (-Vocalists-) *Minus Rodriguez - vocals (of Minus1) *Eddie Sutton - vocals (of Leeway) (-Guitarists-) *Javier Carpio - guitar (deceased May 1, 2006) *\"Karate\" Chris Bozeth - guitar *Anthony Muccini - guitar *Delvin \"DJ\" Hodges - guitar *Dave Stafford - guitar *Darian Polach - guitar *Ernesto Colon - guitar (2013-2018) *Andrew \u201cLumpy\u201d Francis - guitar (-Bassists-) *Eamon Carney - bass guitar *Rick Lopez - bass guitar *Michael MacIvor - bass guitar (of Candiria, Dead Air, Rampage) *Javier E.
