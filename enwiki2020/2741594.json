Owned by iHeartMedia (formerly Clear Channel Communications), the station broadcasts at 105.9 MHz with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 15.5 kW. Since October 2006, WXDX has been the radio flagship station of the National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins. Its transmitter is located in Pittsburgh's North Side, while its studios are located in Green Tree. ==History== WXDX's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD. 105.9 FM signed on as WAMO-FM in 1948 and had the most powerful signal coverage in western Pennsylvania. It also had various formats during its early years, which also included Album-oriented Rock, Disco, and CHUrban. However, it had better success with its urban contemporary/R&B; direction, of which the WAMO call letters would be associated with in the following decades, even with various frequency changes. In 1974, WAMO and WAMO-FM began separate programming. The A.M. station aired Urban Gospel programming on weekdays, while on weekends, it simulcasted WAMO-FM. WAMO-FM was formatted as an Urban Contemporary station with Gospel programming on Sunday. Over the years, the station was branded as \"Hot 106 WAMO\". On April 10, 1996, at 3 PM, WAMO swapped frequencies with WXDX, and moved to the 106.7 frequency, with WXDX moving to 105.9 FM. WXDX was one of six stations in the Clear Channel roster that dropped Howard Stern in February 2004 (however, Stern would show up on WRKZ later that year). Howard began airing on WXDX in November 1995 (when it was still on 106.7 FM). Currently, the station\u2019s air staff consists of morning host Abby Krizner, midday & weekend host Russ \u201cWhip\u201d Rose, afternoon host Mark Madden, evening host Stacy Walter, and weekend/swing hosts Brandy Richey, Katie Oltmanns, and Travis Marzina. Additional time is filled by programming from the Penguins Radio Network and iHeartMedia\u2019s Premium Choice network, which provides the station with talent and music in the overnight hours and Saturday evenings. ===Former on-air staff=== * Alan Cox \u2013 The Alan Cox Radio Show.

In May 2009, as part of WXDX's renewal of Pittsburgh Penguins radio rights, WXDX and the Penguins announced that the HD2 subchannel would become a 24-hour channel devoted to Penguins coverage, billed as \"Pittsburgh Penguins Radio.\" Plans for the channel (which launched October 1, 2009) include local and nationally-originated Penguins and hockey coverage (including \"NHL Live\" and league commissioner Gary Bettman\u2019s weekly \u201cNHL Hour\"), rebroadcasts of classic Penguins games, and game broadcasts of the team's top farm club in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. The move will make the Penguins the second North American professional sports team (the first NHL team) with their own terrestrial radio channel (after the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and their HD2 relationship with KRLD-FM). In the fall of 2015, WXDX-HD2 dropped Penguins Radio 24/7 with music WXDX normally plays on their station (but still simulcast Penguins games) until late March 2016 when they replaced the format altogether with iHeart2000s (which was moved over by WKST-HD2, and was replaced with Pride Radio). As of early 2020, WXDX is no longer broadcasting an HD2 subchannel. ==References== ==External links== *Official website * XDX- FM Category:Modern rock radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1948 Category:IHeartMedia radio stations ",
