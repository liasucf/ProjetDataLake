In 1863, the family moved to the Mission District of San Francisco, California. Sullivan graduated from St. Ignatius College Preparatory, and in 1870, received both A.B. and M.A. degrees from St. Ignatius College. After graduation, he read law with the law office of Winans & Belknap to enter the bar on January 13, 1874. He then practiced in the firm of Meighan & Sullivan, and in 1877 sat on the San Francisco Board of Education. On September 2, 1879, Sullivan was elected as a judge of the San Francisco County Superior Court under the new constitution, and was re-elected in 1884. Among his notable cases is common law marriage and divorce case of Sarah Althea Hill against Senator William Sharon of Nevada.Sharon v. Sharon, 75 Cal. 1, 16 Pac. 345 (1888).Sharon v. Sharon, 79 Cal. 633, 22 Pac. 26 (1889). Sullivan ruled the marriage existed and ordered a property settlement. Former Chief Justice David S. Terry, who married Hill in 1886, then accused Sullivan in the press of taking a bribe to sway the case, which Sullivan disputed. He served on the trial bench until August 1, 1889, and then re-entered private practice with this brother, Matt I. Sullivan.

On January 3, 1927, Sullivan gave up the seat to the election winner, William Langdon.
