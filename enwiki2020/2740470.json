Fopp was later combined with the band's first EP, Screaming Life (1987), and released as the Screaming Life/Fopp compilation album in 1990. ==Recording== The EP was recorded in 1988 at the Moore Theatre in Seattle, Washington, with producer Steve Fisk. ==Music and lyrics== The EP contains one Soundgarden original, two covers, and a remix. Guitarist Kim Thayil said of the title track: \"That's an Ohio Players song off of Honey\u2014I've had that album since I was in high school. We thought we could take the song and make it AC/DC or something. We'd take the power chords, turn up the volume and make it heavy. \"Fopp\" is a good song that needed to be given its due as a 'kick-ass rock song!'\"Gilbert, Jeff. \"Primecuts: Kim Thayil\". Guitar School. May 1994. The EP also contains a cover of the Green River song \"Swallow My Pride\" from the 1985 EP, Come on Down. ==Release and reception== Fopp was released on vinyl only, packaged in black die-cut sleeves and limited to 3,000 copies. The album's cover art was photographed by Charles Peterson. Frontman Chris Cornell said, \"The second record did pretty well but it wasn't like a sweep, some people didn't like it.\"White, Richard. \"Soundgarden Rocks\". Rockpool.
