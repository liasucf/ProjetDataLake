He respected M G Ramachandran and Sivaji Ganesan among the Tamil film actors for their body of work.

He acted with Pierce Brosnan in The Deceivers (1988). Shashi Kapoor requested Amitabh Bachchan to star in his ambitious directorial debut film Ajooba.

The film did not do too well at the box office in India, but was classed as a hit abroad. The film had a lavish budget with a mega star Line up. The film over the years has been appreciated for its story telling, and acting from Amitabh Bachchan, Rishi Kapoor, Shammi Kapoor and Amrish Puri.
