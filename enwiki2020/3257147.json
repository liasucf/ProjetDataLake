    "text": "First edition (publ. Steidl) My Century (German: Mein Jahrhundert, 1999) is a novel written by German author G\u00fcnter Grass. Having published many significant novels in the postwar period, he was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize in Literature. Each chapter in My Century is only a few pages long. Each focuses on a single year from 1900-1999. The story of each year is told differently, expressed by changes in time, place, narrator and literary style. ==Reception== While acknowledging Grass' talents and works, Peter Gay of The New York Times said of this book: > Grass's intentions are obvious: he was trying to construct a mosaic of > German history across the 20th century through the diverse voices of its > participants. Each year is designed to illuminate an event or create an > atmosphere, the whole, without consecutive narration, commentary or > analysis, to add up to a living portrait. Instead Grass has produced a > collection of fragments that fail to cohere.\"Peter Gay, \"A Cloud of > Witness\", New York Times, 19 December 1999, accessed 8 September 2014 Similarly, Richard Bernstein of The New York Times said that the book is a kaleidoscope, \"But it is a pale, watery sort of kaleidoscope, providing unsatisfactorily fragmentary glances at people and events that disappear almost as soon as they are seen.\"Richard Bernstein, \"BOOKS OF THE TIMES; 100 Years of Certitude: Gunter Grass's History\", New York Times, 5 January 2000, accessed 8 September 2014 Wolfgang Weber was more appreciative; he said: > \"This is Grass's way of challenging the conventional view of history. > Instead of an event being presented abstractly and in a familiar form, in > connection with \u201cgreat politics\u201d, it is viewed as through a prism \u201cfrom > below\u201d and \u201cfrom close up\u201d ... from changing, unexpected viewpoints. The > stories about the first half of the century are also linguistically > colourful and multifaceted, allowing history to be re-lived and re- > considered.\"\"'My century?'
