    "text": "Amanita farinosa, commonly known as the Eastern American floury amanita, is a North American poisonous mushroom of the genus Amanita, a genus of fungi including some of the most deadly mushrooms. ==Taxonomy== Two recent molecular studies show that Amanita farinosa is part of a subgroup within Amanita with its close relatives Amanita muscaria, A. gemmata and A. roseotincta.Moncalvo J-M, Drehmel D, & Vilgalys R. (2000). Variation in modes and rates of evolution in nuclear and mitochondrial ribosomal DNA in the mushroom genus Amanita (Agaricales, Basidiomycota): phylogenetic implications. Molecular Phylogenetic and Evolution 16:48-63.Drehmel D, Moncalvo J-M, & Vilgalys R. (1999). Molecular phylogeny of Amanita based on large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences: implications for taxonomy and character evolution. Mycologia 91:610-618 ==Description== The cap is 2.5-7 cm (1-2.8 inches) in diameter, domed in young and flat in older specimens, with a striate margin. It is whitish grey and covered with brownish grey volval or mealy material. The gills are white. They may be attached to the stem or free. They are close and crowded and not bruising. The stem, or the stipe, lacks a ring and at its base a smallish bulb or volva. It measures up to 6.5 cm high, 1-3 centimeters thick. The stem is white to tan in color.Kuo, M. (2008, March). Amanita farinosa. Retrieved from the MushroomExpert.Com Web site: http://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita_farinosa.html The spores are white. They are 5.5-8 x 6-8 \u00b5m in measurement and inamyloid. The spores are smooth and round to broadly elliptical. The flesh is white in color. It doesn't stain on exposure. In old specimens, the smell can be strong and that of mink. ==Distribution and habitat== An uncommon mushroom, it is found across North America in late summer to late autumn in coniferous or deciduous woodlands. ==See also== *List of Amanita species ==Footnotes== farinosa Category:Poisonous fungi Category:Fungi of North America Category:Fungi of Central America Category:Fungi of Mexico Category:Fungi described in 1822 ",
