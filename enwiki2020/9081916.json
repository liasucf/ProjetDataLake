The station is currently owned by Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. through licensee Beasley Media Group, LLC. The station's studios are located in the unincorporated Clark County area of Spring Valley, while its transmitter is in Dolan Springs. ==Translators== *KOAS operates an FM booster transmitter on 105.7 MHz in Henderson, Nevada. The booster, known as KOAS-FM1,Radio Locator Information on KOAS-1 transmits with 2,500 watts of ERP. It provides the Las Vegas area with a stronger signal than the main transmitter located in Dolan Springs. :Radio stations KOAS and KVGS have on-channel FM boosters broadcasting from an antenna at the top of The Stratosphere. Licensed as KOAS-FM1 and KVGS-FM1, they are the only radio stations with transmitters at the tower. However, the signals being transmitted from this structure are relatively low-power and only cover the immediate Las Vegas area on a \"fill in\" or \"booster\" basis. Both of these stations have their main transmitter sites located elsewhere, and those transmitter sites are what give these stations more wide spread, regional coverage.https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/CDBS_Attachment/getattachment.jsp?appn=101261190&qnum;=5100&copynum;=1&exhcnum;=1https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/CDBS_Attachment/getattachment.jsp?appn=101368034&qnum;=5080&copynum;=1&exhcnum;=2 *K288FS, a translator of KOAS, serves nearby Charleston Park, Nevada with a two hundred fifty-watt signal on 105.5 MHz.Radio Locator information on K288FN ==History== The station was assigned the call sign KCRR on August 1, 1984. On November 20, 1987, the station changed its call sign to KFLG. On December 12, 2000, the station became KBYE. On August 8, 2001, KBYE flipped to smooth jazz as \"The Oasis\", with the station changing call letters to the current KOAS on the 14th.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2001/RR-2001-08-17.pdf On December 26, 2009, after airing Christmas music for a month, KOAS dropped Smooth Jazz for Rhythmic AC, giving the market two stations in the format, the other being KPLV (which would shift to top 40 roughly four months later). On April 1, 2013, KOAS shifted their format to rhythmic oldies. In November 2013, the long time \"Oasis\" moniker (from the previous smooth jazz format) was dropped in favor of \"Old School 105.7\". On June 17, 2019 at midnight, KOAS flipped from rhythmic adult contemporary to urban adult contemporary as Jammin 105.7. ==Gallery== File:The Stratosphere Las Vegas 2 Bay FM Antenna.jpg|Picture of KOAS-FM1 and KVGS-FM1 transmitting antenna atop The Stratosphere, March 2010.
