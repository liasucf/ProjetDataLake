These include The Gate of Heavenly Peace (1995), which depicted the spring on 1989 in China leading up to the events of June Fourth, and Morning Sun, on the Cultural Revolution. He is known as a non-native scholar who can research and write Chinese at the highest level.Rudd's ANU China centre puts noses out of joint The Australian 11 August 2010 His book An Artistic Exile: A Life of Feng Zikai was awarded the Joseph Levenson Book Prize for Modern China, 2004. He was editor of the ANU based e-journal China Heritage Quarterlyfrom 2005 to 2012, and is the editor of China Heritage. In 2016, he founded The Wairarapa Academy for New Sinology in collaboration with sinologist John Minford. ==Education and career== Barm\u00e9 took his B.A. Asian Studies from ANU, majoring in Chinese and Sanskrit, then studied at universities in the People's Republic of China (1974\u201377) and Japan (1980\u201383). When he first returned to Australia as a Lecturer in History, one of his first students was future Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, whose support was important in funding the Centre for China in the World. He edited the journal East Asian History from 1991 to 2007 East Asian History 1.1 (1991) In 2011, he gave the inaugural \"China in the World\" Invited Lecture at ANU, \"Australia and China in the World: Whose Literacy?\" CIW 2011 Annual Lecture ==New Sinology== In an essay first published in 2005, Barm\u00e9 called for a \"New Sinology,\" which would be :descriptive of a \"robust engagement with contemporary China\" and indeed with the Sinophone world in all of its complexity, be it local, regional or global. It affirms a conversation and intermingling that also emphasizes strong scholastic underpinnings in both the classical and modern Chinese language and studies, at the same time as encouraging an ecumenical attitude in relation to a rich variety of approaches and disciplines, whether they be mainly empirical or more theoretically inflected. In seeking to emphasize innovation within Sinology by recourse to the word 'new', it is nonetheless evident that I continue to affirm the distinctiveness of Sinology as a mode of intellectual inquiry.\"New Sinology\", China in The World, First published in the Chinese Studies Association of Australia Newsletter Issue No. 31, May 2005 The historian Arif Dirlik is among those who welcomed Barm\u00e9\u2019s intervention as \"an important reminder of the importance of language as the defining feature of the term.\"Arif Dirlik Literary Identity/Cultural Identity: Being Chinese in the Contemporary World MCLC Resource Center (accessed April 9, 2015). ==Selected major publications== * * * * * * * * * ==References== == External links == * Barm\u00e9, Geremie WorldCat authority page. * Evan Osnos, Q & A Geremie Barme New Yorker (29 September 2009) * Geremie Barme Archives China Digital Times Links to articles. * China in the World Lecture - Geremie Barm\u00e9 YouTube * New Sinology \u540e\u6c49\u5b66/\u5f8c\u6f22\u5b78 The China Story (ANU).
