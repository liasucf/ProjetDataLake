In an effort to promote responsible behaviour among children, Mukesh Khanna spent a substantial part of the airtime in explaining to the children that the stunts shown on television were not real and should not be emulated. Khanna also stated that most of the controversies were fake and were raised in media to undermine its popularity. ==Comic Books== A series of comic books appeared featuring Shaktimaan and published in many Indian languages as well as English in association with Diamond Comics and Raj Comics. ==Merchandise== Shaktimaan merchandise like costumes, stickers, dolls were introduced in the market. ==Awards and nominations== Shaktimaan: The Animated Series won 2012 FICCI BAF award for best animated TV series. ==References== ==External links== * * Interview with Mukesh Khanna at Indiantelevision.com Category:Television superheroes Category:Indian superheroes Category:Television characters introduced in 1997 Category:DD National original programming Category:Shaktimaan ",
