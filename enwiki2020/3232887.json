    "text": "Sir Bagby was an American daily strip created by brothers Rick Hackney and Bill Hackney, who signed the strip \"R & B Hackney.\" The setting was a medieval world filled with anachronisms and puns. (In that, it resembled Jack Kent's King Aroo, distributed by the same syndicate.) The strip ran in a small number of US newspapers from 1957 to 1967. ==Characters and story == The main characters are Sir Bagby, a knight, King Filbert I, II (\"King Filbert I was my father. He built the business up so I decided to keep the name.\"), a wizard named Snerk, a jester named Solly, a playwright named Faro, and his assistant, Billingsgate. == Reprints == The only reprints of the strip have been in Comics Revue. ==References== * Strickler, Dave.
