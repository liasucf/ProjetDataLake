    "text": "Gary Hoey (born August 23, 1960) is an American hard rock and latterly blues rock guitarist, singer and songwriter. He has recorded over 20 albums and had five Top 20 Billboard hits. ==Early life and early career== Hoey was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, United States. At fourteen, Hoey often lingered outside Boston's renowned Berklee College of Music, making friends and offering to pay for lessons. To devote his time to music, he dropped out of high school and began playing Boston's local clubs and teaching guitar to other young players. He auditioned for Ozzy Osbourne in 1988, when Osbourne was searching for a replacement for Jake E. Lee, but the job went to Zakk Wylde. In 1990, he teamed with singer Joel Ellis, bassist Rex Tennyson, and drummer Frankie Banali to form Heavy Bones. The band released their debut album in 1992, but broke up shortly afterwards. In 1993, he recorded the successful Animal Instinct album, which included a cover of the Focus hit \"Hocus Pocus\". The single reached the top five in the Billboard Hot 100 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and the album was also commercially successful. The successful Endless Summer II (1995) soundtrack soon followed. He went on to record around twelve instrumental albums, all electric guitar oriented. His 1996 release, Bug Alley, displayed added vocal ability that he has expanded on more recent albums. He continues to tour extensively. ==Later career== As writer, producer, and guitar player, Hoey's clients have included Disney, ESPN, and No Fear, and he has performed the National Anthem for the New England Patriots, San Diego Padres, Boston Red Sox, and the Boston Bruins. Hoey was featured in VH1 Classic\u2019s documentary Aftermath, and guest starred alongside Michael Anthony, Ace Frehley, and Dave Mason, among others, at the 2010 Rock N Roll Fantasy Camp in Los Angeles, a special series that aired on VH1 Classic. His popular \u201cHo! Ho! Hoey!\u201d series of Christmas CDs and on-air station visits during the holiday season have become an annual staple at hundreds of radio stations nationwide. Moreover, his live annual interpretation, \"Ho Ho Hoey's Rockin' Holiday Show,\" gains new fans each year. Hallmark's musical greeting cards feature two of Hoey's \"Ho Ho Hoey\" classics. In addition to touring as a headline act, Hoey has toured and/or recorded with Brian May of Queen, Ted Nugent, Foreigner, Joe Satriani, The Doobie Brothers, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Eric Johnson, Steve Vai, Peter Frampton, Rick Derringer, Deep Purple, and Lita Ford. Hoey supported Jeff Beck on the US leg of his Spring 2010 tour. Hoey played on and co-wrote a few songs on Lita Ford's Living Like a Runaway album in 2012, as well as toured with her in support of that album. His 2008 release Fade to Blues saw a shift in emphasis and style towards blues rock in his own work. Hoey's most recent album, Neon Highway Blues was released in 2019. It debuted at number 2 in the US Billboard Blues Albums Chart. Hoey endorses and primarily plays Fender guitars, favoring multiple different Strat models, while simultaneously endorsing Taylor acoustic guitars. He also uses guitars by other makes including Hamer, Gibson and Ovation. Additionally he is also an endorser of GHS strings, EVH amps and Fishman pickups. ==Discography== * Get A Grip (1991) * Heavy Bones (with the band Heavy Bones) (1992) * Animal Instinct (1993) * Endless Summer II Soundtrack (1994) * Gary Hoey (1995) * Ho!
