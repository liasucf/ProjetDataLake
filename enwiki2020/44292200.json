The current dam was completed within just seven months although initial development started in 2012 was disrupted by Typhoons Bopha and Lingling (local names: Pablo and Agaton). The dam is part of the Cateel Irrigation Project, the biggest project by the Mindanao Rural Development Project, both in physical and financial terms, costing about \u20b1281 million. The dam is expected to provide irrigation to over 1,600 hectares of rice fields spanning eleven barangays of Cateel. ==References== Category:Dams in the Philippines Category:Dams completed in 2014 Category:Buildings and structures in Davao Oriental Category:2014 establishments in the Philippines Category:Gravity dams ",
