    "text": "Folio 12v of the Bern Physiologus. The Bern Physiologus (Bern, Burgerbibliothek, Codex Bongarsianus 318) is a 9th-century illuminated copy of the Latin translation of the Physiologus. It was probably produced at Reims about 825-850. It is believed to be a copy of a 5th-century manuscript. Many of its miniatures are set, unframed, into the text block, which was a characteristic of late-antique manuscripts. It is one of the oldest extant illustrated copies of the Physiologus. ==References== * ==Further reading== *Stavros Lazaris: \"Quelques consid\u00e9rations sur l\u2019illustration du Physiologus grec\", in: Bestiaires m\u00e9di\u00e9vaux : Nouvelles perspectives sur les manuscrits et les traditions textuelles.
