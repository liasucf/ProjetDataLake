    "text": "The 20th Avenue NE Bridge (also known as the Ravenna Park Bridge) is a three- hinged, steel, lattice-arched bridge that spans a ravine in Seattle's Ravenna Park. It was designed by Frank M. Johnson under the direction of city engineer Arthur Dimock. Built in 1913, the structure is both listed in the National Register of Historic Places and is a designated city landmark. The structure is long. It has a arch that rises over the ravine. It supports an reinforced concrete roadway. The road has been closed to vehicular traffic since 1975, but it is accessible by pedestrians.
