He fought with the Virginia militia in the Revolutionary War and represented Virginia in the U.S. Congress from 1797 until 1804. ==Life== ===Family life=== John was born on his father's farm near New London in Lunenburg County, Virginia. He was one of the eight children of William Trigg (1716 - 1773) and Mary (Johns) Trigg (1720 - 1773). His father, William served as a judge in Bedford County (which was formed from part of Lunenburg County in 1754) for many years. His brother, Abram, would serve with him in congress. The Trigg and Johns families both arrived in Virginia from England in the mid-seventeenth century. Mary Johns was, in fact, a descendant of Captain John Fox of London, a tobacco merchant and ship's captain who received a land grant from his patron King Charles II in 1667. The Triggs were from Cornwall. John married Dianna Ayers on December 17, 1770, and they settled on their own plantation \"Old Liberty\" near what became the town of Liberty (now Bedford, Virginia). The family would grow to include seven children: Stephen, William, Nancy, Daniel, Theodosia, John Johns Jr., and Mary (Polly). Dianna survived John, living until some time after 1807. ===Military service=== Virginia expanded her militia as the conflict with Great Britain loomed. Trigg raised a new militia company in Bedford County in 1775Biographical Directory of the US Congress. Accessed 11 June 2006 and led it as its lieutenant. He remained with this unit throughout the war, and saw several local actions. The state's House of Delegates named him as a captain on March 23, 1778, and a major in 1781. He was a major of artillery at the Siege of Yorktown later that year, and was present at the surrender of Lord Cornwallis. After the war Trigg continued his service in the Virginia militia. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1791, and in 1793 served as a major in the Second Battalion of the Tenth Regiment of the Virginia militia. In 1796 and 1802, he was commander of the 91st Regiment of the Virginia militia.Virginia Militia Records, accessed 11 June 2006. ==Political career== Trigg's political service started around 1781 when he became a Justice of the Peace in Bedford County. He was elected to represent the county in the Virginia House of Delegates, and served there from 1784 until 1792. In 1788 he represented Bedford County in the Virginia Convention that ratified the U.S. Constitution.Swem, Earl G. and Williams, John W., A Register of the General Assembly of Virginia 1776-1918 and of the Constitutional Conventions (Richmond, Va: 1918), 439.

Trigg was re-elected three times, and served in the Congress from 1797. He died at home on May 17, 1804, on his farm near Liberty in Bedford County and was buried in a family plot there. ===The Fifth Congress=== Trigg arrived on the second day the Fifth Congress of the United States convened, Tuesday, May 16, 1797, and was in time to hear the new President's speech to Congress about his position in regards to France. At this time, Trigg, a Democratic-Republican/Anti-Federalist was in the minority party, as the House was majority Federalist, as was John Adams, the President of the United States.
