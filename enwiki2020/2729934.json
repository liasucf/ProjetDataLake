Kannis was placed in seventh position, eliminated on 17 October 2005. Kannis had auditioned for Australian Idol in Sydney by singing a song, \"A Dollar Away\", which he composed with his step father, producer Sammy K. The three judges responded with positive comments, Marcia Hines stated that she thought Kannis has \"got a really good future in this industry\". During his Top 30 performance, he performed, \"Change the World\", originally by Babyface, and although the judges provided positive feedback, he did not reach the Top 12. He returned to perform in the \"Wildcard\" round singing, \"Drift Away\", and became the \"Judges Choice\" and the first \"Wildcard\" to be put through to the Final 12. James Kannis later signed with Zeus Records/Shock. His debut album, Angels on a Hot Tin Roof, which takes inspiration from many genres of music including hip-hop, orchestral and dance, was produced in Australia by Sammy K and mastered in New York by Tom Coyne (Destiny's Child, Pink) is due for release in early 2007. His debut single, \"Love 2 Love\", which was released on 11 November 2006 peaked at No. 22 on the ARIA Physical Singles Chart. It reached No. 35 on the ARIA Singles Chart, making him the only independent Australian artist in the ARIA Top 40 on 4 December. On 2 April 2007, \"Love 2 Love\", re-entered the ARIA Chart at No. 35. It peaked on the ARIA Physical Singles Chart at No. 17 after Kannis' appearance at a Greek Music Festival in Australia during March. This was three-and-a-half months after it left the Australian Chart in the first place. \"Love 2 Love\" also topped the Australian Indie charts.
