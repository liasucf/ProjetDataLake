It occupies the building of the former Saguenay Valley High School, constructed in 1962. It is operated by the Central Quebec School Board. The school was created by the merger of Sageunary Valley High School and the high school grades of St. Patrick's School in 1997 at the time that the Quebec government replaced confessional school boards (Catholic or Protestant) with linguistic boards (French or English). ==References== ==External links== *https://www.cqsb.qc.ca/en/web/riverside- regional-high-school Category:High schools in Quebec Category:Education in Saguenay, Quebec ",
