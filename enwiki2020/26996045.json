Synthesis of the selective D2 receptor agonist PNU-95666E from D-phenylalanine using a sequential oxidative cyclization strategy. Journal of Organic Chemistry. 1997; 62(19):6582. It was developed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome. While it has never been approved for medical use it is a highly valuable tool compound for basic research to identify neurobiological mechanisms that are based on a dopamine D2-linked (vs. D1, D3, D4, and D5-linked) mechanism of action. In 2004, Pfizer announced the end of their clinical development program for sumanirole, citing \u201crecent studies that failed to sufficiently distinguish sumanirole from currently available therapies\u201d. == See also == * Ropinirole == References == Category:Amines Category:Dopamine agonists Category:Imidazoquinolines Category:Ureas ",
