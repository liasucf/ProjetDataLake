Using the name Si Yin, Bia Qian fell in love with her master. During a battle with the Demon Tribe's King, Mo Yuan sacrificed himself in order to seal away the Demon King. His soul was scattered and his body became preserved in a block of ice. Bai Qian took Mo Yuan's body back to Qing Qiu, a mystical land where her family lives, where she awaited his eventual awakening and return. One day, Bai Qian attends a banquet where she saves a boy named Ah Li from getting kidnapped. She also meets his father, the Crown Prince of the Heaven Tribe and her betrothed. Upon seeing Bai Qian, he calls her by the name of a mortal woman he had fallen in love with 300 years prior and Ah Li's mother, Su Su. Shortly after, Ye Hua and Ah Li arrive in Qing Qiu in an attempt to bond with her. During his stay, he comes to the conclusion that Bai Qian was Su Su, and is saddened yet relieved that she does not remember their painful past. Realizing that they have developed a mutual liking for each other, Ye Hua and Bai Qian decide to wed. Bai Qian eventually learns from Ye Hua's side concubine, Su Jin, that Su Su had committed suicide and comes to believe that Ye Hua is only marrying her because he feels guilty. Due to an artifact given to her by Ye Hua, Bai Qian's memories as Su Su are regained. 300 years ago, Bai Qian was forced to undergo a heavenly trial. With her powers and memories locked away, she started a new life as Su Su and subsequently met Ye Hua. He snuck Su Su into the Heaven Tribe where he abandoned her and left Su Su to work as a maid. After being falsely accused of a crime by Su Jin, Ye Hua gouged out Su Su's eyes as retribution. Su Su came to believe that Ye Hua no longer loved her and later committed suicide shortly after giving birth to Ah Li. Because she is immortal, Bai Qian's body returned to Qing Qiu where she drank a healing water to forget her life as Su Su. In reality, Ye Hua had broken the laws of Heaven by falling in love with a mortal. In order to protect her from the consequences of his actions, Ye Hua disguised Su Su as a maid and left her alone in the palace to keep up the charade. Su Jin discovered Su Su was actually Ye Hua's human lover and framed her for a crime. Ye Hua was forced to blind Su Su and endured her original punishment which was to be struck by lightning. Still heartbroken about her memories as Su Su, Bai Qian refuses to see Ye Hua who waits in Qing Qiu for days. Hearing that Qing Cang has broken free, Ye Hua takes it upon himself to defeat the Demon King. Bai Qian learns of his plans and witnesses Ye Hua sacrificing himself to lock up Qing Cang. Ye Hua's body drifts into a freezing river and floats away under the ice as Bai Qian watches in tears. Ye Hua's sacrifice allows Mo Yuan to awaken, as Ye Hua was the final piece of Mo Yuan's scattered soul. Mo Yuan and Bai Qian are happily reunited. ==Cast== * Liu Yifei as Bai Qian / Si Yin / Su Su * Yang Yang as Ye Hua / Mo Yuan * Luo Jin as Zhe Yan * Yan Yikuan as Qing Cang * Li Chun as Su Jin * Gu Xuan as Xuan Nu * Peng Zisu as Ah Li (Bai Chen) * Chen Xingxu ==Production== On 16 June 2015, it was announced that Liu Yifei will play the leading role of Bai Qian / Si Yin / Su Su.
