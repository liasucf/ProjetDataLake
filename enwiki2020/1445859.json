    "text": "\u0130ske iml\u00e2 (, , \"Old Orthography\") is a variant of the Arabic script, used for the Tatar language before 1920, as well as for the Old Tatar language. This alphabet can be referred to as \"old\" only to contrast it with Ya\u00f1a iml\u00e2. Additional characters that could not be found in Arabic and Persian were borrowed from the Chagatai language. The final alphabet was reformed by Qayum Nasiri in the 1870s. In 1920, it was replaced by the Ya\u00f1a iml\u00e2 (which was not an Abjad, but derived from the same source). This alphabet is currently used by Chinese Tatars, who speak an archaic variant of the Tatar language. ==Description== Qazan \u2013 \u0642\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0646 is written in Ya\u00f1a iml\u00e2 in the semblance of a Zilant Cover of Tatar primer for the Russians in Arabic script from 1778. \u0425\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0444\u0438\u043d, \u0421\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0442. \u0410\u0437\u0431\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430. \u2014 \u041c., 1778. \u2014 52 \u0441. Dini kitaplar (Religious books) written in Cyrillic and \u0130ske iml\u00e2. \u0130ske iml\u00e2 is frequently used for Tatar among Muslim clergy. Another example of modern use of Arabic script in Tatar: telephone token, used in mid 1990s in Kazan telephone network. The word Kazan is written in Russian (\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044c) and Tatar, \u0130ske iml\u00e2 (\u0642\u0632\u0627\u0646). Use of the Arabic script for Tatar was linked to Pan Islam and anti- Sovietism, with the old traditional class promoting Arabic script in opposition to the Soviets. Based on the standard Arabic alphabet, \u0130ske iml\u00e2 reflected all vowels in the beginning and end of a word and back vowels in the middle of a word with letters, but front vowels in the middle of a word, as in most Arabic alphabets, were optionally reflected using harakat (diacritics on top of or below consonants). Just as in standard Arabic orthography, letters Alif, Y\u0101\u02bc and Waw were used to represent all vowels in the beginning and end of a word and back vowels in the middle of a word, with various harakat on top or below them and in these cases the letters actually denoted a vowel. The same harakat that combined with the afore-mentioned letters to make vowels were used in the middle of a word on top of or below a consonant to represent a front vowel. However, the following pairs/triplets of Tatar vowels were represented by the same harakat, because Arabic language only uses 3 of them to represent vowels which can be either back or front depending on whether they are applied to Alif, Y\u0101\u02bc and Waw or another letter (plus Alif madda represents a in the beginning of a word): \u0131, e, \u00ed and i were represented with kasra, whereas \u00f6 and \u00fc were represented with damma. O and U also looked the same, but being back vowels, they were represented with the help of Alif and Waw and thus were distinct from \u00f6 and \u00fc. Fat\u1e25ah represented only one vowel. While the user had to make a conversion of writing into pronunciation, somewhat akin to English, this allowed for more similar orthography between Turkic languages, because words looked more similar even when vowels vary, such as in cases of variations like \u00f6 to \u00fc, o to u, or e to i. Ya\u00f1a iml\u00e2 added separate letters for vowels and thus broke out with standard Arabic alphabets, but spelling followed no standard convention. During that period, the Tatar language had no borrowed vowels and consonants, so Arab loanwords were pronounced using the closest Tatar consonants (see table). European and Russian loanwords were pronounced according to how they could be written with the \u0130ske iml\u00e2, so that, for example, \"equator\" was spelled \"ikwatur\". ==The alphabet== {| class=\"wikitable\" | ! name !!
