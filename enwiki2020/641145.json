    "text": "The New Jersey Jackals are an American professional baseball team based in Little Falls in Passaic County, New Jersey, United States. The team was founded in 1998 by Floyd Hall and is owned by Al Dorso, a businessman who also owns the Sussex County Miners, Skylands Stadium, and State Fair Superstore. The Jackals are a member of the Can-Am Division of the Frontier League, an independent baseball league which is a Partner League of Major League Baseball. They were previously members of the Northeast League, Northern League, Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball, and All- American Baseball Challenge. The Jackals play their home games at Yogi Berra Stadium on the campus of Montclair State University. ==Team history== ===1998: Inaugural season=== The Jackals were founded in 1998 and replaced the Bangor Blue Ox in the Northeast League after that franchise folded. Kash Beauchamp was named the team's first manager and they began play on May 30, 1998 against the Waterbury Spirit, where they won both games of a doubleheader. The Jackals' first home game was played at a yet-to-be-finished Yogi Berra Stadium on June 5. Facing the Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs, New Jersey went to extra innings before winning 2\u20131 in the thirteenth on a home run by Gary Collum. The Jackals finished the regular season with 53 wins, most in the league, and won the first half championship, which ensured a place in the Northeast League playoffs. They would defeat the Allentown Ambassadors in their first playoff series, then face Albany-Colonie again for the league championship. The Jackals defeated the Diamond Dogs 2\u20130 in a best of three series to win their first league championship. ===1999-2000: Entering a new league=== The Jackals became members of the Northern League for the 1999 season after the league decided to absorb the Northeast League. The Jackals became part of the new Northern League East Division. The Jackals won 45 games in 1999 and again qualified for the playoffs, knocking off Allentown in their first playoff matchup before falling to Albany-Colonie in a rematch of their league championship series from 1998. The Jackals received the honor of hosting the Northern League All-Star Game in 2000. 4,211 fans showed up to watch the game, which saw the East defeat the Central Division 10\u20135.http://www.nlfan.com/league/allstar/allstar00.shtml It was one of the year's highlights, but there were not many others as the Jackals struggled throughout the season. A 31\u201352 record placed the team last in the division, and following the season Kash Beauchamp announced his resignation after three seasons. ===2001-2004: Champions=== George Tsamis was hired to take over the Jackals for 2001. He had lost his job as manager in Waterbury following the 2000 season when the Spirit suspended operations. The Jackals again found struggles, but managed to pull together 45 victories against 45 losses. They qualified for the Northern League playoffs for the second time in three years as a wild card and once again won their first round series, sweeping Albany- Colonie. Shortly after the Jackals' win over the Diamond Dogs, the September 11 attacks occurred and threw the rest of the playoffs into doubt. After discussion the Northern League determined that they would continue to play and the Jackals resumed their championship quest against the Elmira Pioneers on September 17. In a five-game series, New Jersey emerged victorious and advanced to the Northern League Championship Series against the Winnipeg Goldeyes, whom they defeated in four games to win their second league championship. ===2002=== The 2002 Jackals season was historic on two fronts. The first historic moment came when Jeremy Callier threw a no-hitter on August 28 against the Berkshire Black Bears, requiring a home run by Ryan Kane in the bottom of the ninth inning to make it official. The second piece of team history saw the Jackals set a team record for victories, finishing with 62 to lead the league. In the playoffs, however, the Jackals had problems. In the first round, they took the first two against Elmira before the Pioneers won the next two to tie the series. The Jackals emerged victorious in five games. Then, in the Northern League East Championship Series against Adirondack, the Jackals were down to their final out in Game 5 trailing 2-1 when Dave Callahan hit a double with the bases loaded to score all three runners and give the team a 4\u20132 victory. The Jackals capped it off with their second straight victory over Winnipeg in the Northern League Championship Series, defeating the Goldeyes 3 games to 1. ===2003=== 2003 saw two major changes for the Jackals. First George Tsamis resigned to take the managerial position with the St. Paul Saints, New Jersey hired Gary SouthShore RailCats manager Joe Calfapietra to take his place. The second saw the end of the merger with the Northern League, as the Northeast League once again became its own entity.

When the Jackals began in 1998, games were carried over Seton Hall University's WSOU. After a season there, the team moved to commercial station WMTR, an oldies station in Morristown. They also were heard on WJUX-FM, a New York-based standards station, ending their run on commercial radio in 2002. For this entire stretch, Jim Cerny was the voice of the Jackals. WPSC-FM, the on-campus radio station for William Paterson University, took broadcast rights in 2003 and kept them until 2006. The original broadcast team consisted of Darren Cooper on play-by-play with Joe Ameruoso as color commentator. Cooper left the broadcast after the season, and Tony Colucci was added as color man to take over for the promoted Ameruoso. Beginning in 2005, Ameruoso did the broadcasts by himself and continued to do so after the broadcasts became web exclusive in 2007, continuing in the role for several more years until his eventual departure. ==Career pitching leaders== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Seasons played !Player !!
