Early sources assumed that he was the son of a sculptor named Domenico Negri, but his father's name is given as Lunardo in some documents and Francesco in others. His first art lessons came from Matteo Ponzone. Later, he worked with Francesco Ruschi. In his early days, much of his work is difficult to distinguish, stylistically, from Antonio Zanchi. His first verified work is from 1658, when he signed an engraving on the frontispiece of Antioco by the poet, Nicol\u00f2 Minato. The paintings attributed to him, prior to the 1660s, are all missing. A painting of Antonio e Cleopatra is dated from c.1664. In 1670, he produced the Albero serafico dei Ordini francescani (Seraphic Tree of the Franciscans), currently at the basilica of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari. One of his best known works is Nerone che esamina il corpo di Agrippina (Nero Examining the Corpse of Agrippina), in the collection of the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden.Fondazione Zeri He married Franceschina Maria Barbara, with whom he had two sons. She died shortly after giving birth to the second and he remarried in 1673, to Angela Caroli, the widow of a merchant.
