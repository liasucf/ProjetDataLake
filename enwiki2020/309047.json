    "text": "Mascarpone (, , ) is an Italian soft cheese made from cream and resembling cream cheese, that is coagulated by the addition of acidic substances such as lemon juice, vinegar, or citric acid. It is recognized in Italy as a ' (\"traditional agri-food product\"). ==Production process== After denaturation of the cream, the whey is removed without pressing or aging. Mascarpone also may be made using cream and the residual tartaric acid from the bottom or sides of barreled wine. The traditional method is to use lemon juice at the rate of three tablespoons per pint of heated heavy cream. The cream is allowed to cool to room temperature before it is poured into a cheese cloth-lined colander, set into a shallow pan or dish, and chilled and strained for one to two days. ==Origins== Mascarpone originated in the area between Lodi and Abbiategrasso, Italy, southwest of Milan, probably in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century. Popularly, the name is held to derive from mascarpa, an unrelated milk product made from the whey of stracchino (a young, barely aged cheese), or from mascarpia, a word in the local dialect for ricotta. Ricotta, unlike mascarpone, is made from milk rather than cream. ==Uses== Mascarpone is milky-white in color and is easy to spread. It is used in various Lombardy dishes and is considered a specialty in the region. Mascarpone is one of the main ingredients in the modern Italian dessert known as tiramisu. Sometimes it is used instead of, or along with, butter or Parmesan cheese to thicken and enrich risotto. Mascarpone also is used in cheesecake recipes. ==See also== *Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche *List of dairy products ==References== ==External links== * Category:Acid-set cheeses Category:Cow's-milk cheeses Category:Cream cheeses Category:Italian cheeses ",
