He was one of the first and most influential British settlers in Kenya. Lord Delamere was the son of Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere, and his second wife, Augusta Emily Seymour, daughter of Sir George Hamilton Seymour. Lord Delamere moved to Kenya in 1901 and acquired vast land holdings from the British Crown. Over the years, he became the unofficial 'leader' of the colony's European community. He was as famous for his tireless labours to establish a working agricultural economy in East Africa as he was for childish antics among his European friends when he was at his leisure. ==Early years== Vale Royal Great House, formerly the seat of the Barons of Delamere \u2013 sold in 1947 Delamere left Eton at the age of sixteen with the intention of entering the British Army,Best, Nicholas, (1979). Happy Valley: The Story of the English in Kenya, p.39. but gave up his military pursuits after acceding to the title aged seventeen on the death of his father on 1 August 1887.http://www.thepeerage.com/p7255.htm#i72546 Baron Delamere was an indirect descendant of Sir Robert Walpole, the first Prime Minister of Great Britain.Hayden, Joseph. (1851). The book of dignities, pp. 527, 565. He entered the 3rd battalion, Cheshire Regiment with a commission in the service as a Lieutenant. He continued to play a role in the militia Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry with the rank of captain. The young baron inherited a sizeable estate in the North of England, including land that had been in the Cholmondeley family since 1615Pakenham, Compton. \"Kenya as a White Man's Country; The Story of Lord Delamere and a Colony That Has Peculiarly Interesting Racial and Social Problems,\" New York Times. 7 July 1935.: and the ancestral seat at Vale Royal in the county of Cheshire. \"Lady Delamere Dies in Africa,\" New York Times. 19 May 1914;Holland, G.D et al. (1977). Vale Royal Abbey and House, pp. 20\u201332; Westair-Reproductions: Cheshire, Museum finder ==African expeditionary explorer== The young Lord Delamere made his first trip to Africa in 1891 to hunt lion in British Somaliland, and returned yearly to resume the hunt. In 1894 he was severely mauled by an attacking lion, and was only saved when his Somali gunbearer, Abdullah Ashur, leaped on the lion, giving Delamere time to retrieve his rifle. As a result of the attack, Lord Delamere limped for the rest of his life; he also developed a healthy respect for Somalis.Bull, Bartle (1992). Safari: A Chronicle of Adventure, p.188. It is believed that on one of these Somaliland hunting trips, Delamere coined the term 'white hunter', the term which came to describe the white safari hunter in colonial East Africa. Delamere employed a professional hunter named Alan Black and a native Somali hunter to lead the safari. As the story goes, to avoid confusion, the Somali was referred to as the 'black hunter', and Black was called the 'white hunter'.Brian Herne, White Hunters: The Golden Age of Safaris,\" Henry Holt & Co., 1999, pages 6\u20137 On an expedition in 1896, Delamere, with a retinue including a doctor, taxidermist, photographer, and 200 camels, set out to cross the deserts of southern Somaliland, intending to enter British East Africa from the north. In 1897, he arrived in the lush green highlands of what is now central Kenya. ==Colonial Kenya== In 1899, the young Lord Delamere married Lady Florence Anne Cole, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat from a prominent Ulster family. She was the daughter of The 4th Earl of Enniskillen, a peer whose ancestral seat was Florence Court in south-west County Fermanagh in the north of Ireland. \"Lord Delamere: Pioneer and Leader in Kenya,\" The Times (London). 14 November 1931. The couple soon sought to relocate to what became known as 'the White Highlands' in Kenya. Lord Delamere originally applied for a land grant from the British Crown in May 1903, but was denied because the Governor of the Protectorate, Sir Charles Eliot, thought the land was too far from any population centre.Best, Happy Valley, p. 41 His next request for , near what is now Naivasha, was denied because the government felt that settlement by a colonising farmer might ignite conflicts with the Maasai tribesman who lived on the land. Delamere's third attempt at land acquisition was successful. He received a 99-year lease on of land that would be named 'Equator Ranch', requiring him to pay a \u00a3200 annual rent and to spend \u00a35,000 on the land over the first five years of occupancy. In 1906, he acquired a large farm in Gilgil division, which would eventually include more than 50,000 acres (210 km\u00b2), located between Elementeita Railway Station, Elmenteita Badlands and Mbaruk Railway Station. This ranch he named Soysambu. Together, these vast possessions made Delamere one of Kenya's 'largemen'; the local name for the handful of colonists with the greatest land holdings. ==Farming== Among Kenya's white settlers, Lord Delamere was famous for his utter devotion to developing Kenyan agriculture. For many years his only homes in Kenya were native-style mud and grass huts, which his wife (who was Ulster Anglo-Irish) decorated with their fine English and Irish furnishings.Bull, Safari, p. 191 For twenty years, Delamere farmed his colossal land by trial, error and dogged effort, experimenting endlessly with crops and livestock, and accruing an invaluable stockpile of knowledge that would later serve as the foundation for the agricultural economy of the colony.Best, Happy Valley, p. 43 By 1905, Delamere was a pioneer of the East African dairy industry. He was also a pioneer at crossbreeding animals, beginning with sheep and chicken, then moving to cattle; most of his imported animals, however, succumbed to diseases such as foot and mouth and Red water disease.Kamau, John, Who was Lord Delamere?, The East African Standard, 22 May 2005, available at http://www.eastandard.net/archives/cl/hm_news/news.php?articleid=21034 Delamere purchased Ryeland Rams from England to mate with 11,000 Maasai ewes, and in 1904, imported 500 pure-bred merino ewes from New Zealand. Four-fifths of the merino ewes quickly died, and the remaining stock were moved to Delamere's Soysambu Ranch, as well as the remaining stock of 1,500 imported cattle that suffered from pleuro-pneumonia.Huxley, Elspeth, Settlers of Kenya (1975), pp. 29\u201330 Eventually, Lord Delamere decided to grow wheat. This, too, was plagued by disease, specifically Rust (fungus).Kamau, John, Who was Lord Delamere? By 1909, Delamere was out of money, resting his last hopes on a wheat crop that eventually failed. He was quoted by author Elspeth Huxley as commenting drily, 'I started to grow wheat in East Africa to prove that though I lived on the equator, I was not in an equatorial country.' Delamere eventually created a 'wheat laboratory' on his farm, employing scientists to manufacture hardy wheat varieties for the Kenyan highlands.Huxley, Settlers of Kenya, pp. 25\u201327 To supplement his income, he even tried raising ostriches for their feathers, importing incubators from Europe; this venture also failed with the advent of the motor car and the decline in fashion of feathered hats.Best, Happy Valley, p. 45 Delamere was the first European to start a maize farm, Florida Farm, in the Rongai Valley, and established the first flour mill in Kenya.Church, Archibald, East Africa: A New Dominion, 1970, pp. 287\u20138 By 1914, his efforts finally began to generate a profit.Huxley, Settlers of Kenya p. 30 ==Happy Valley set== Lord Delamere was active in recruiting settlers to East Africa, promising new colonists , with 200 people eventually responding.Hughes, Anthony John, East Africa: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Penguin, 1969, p. 275 He persuaded some of his friends among the British landed gentry to buy large estates like his own and take up life in Kenya; he is credited with helping to found the so-called Happy Valley set, a clique of well-off British colonials whose pleasure-seeking habits eventually took the form of drug-taking and wife-swapping. The story is often told of Delamere riding his horse into the dining room of Nairobi's Norfolk Hotel and jumping over the tables.Barton, Fiona, The Curse of White Mischief, The Daily Mail, 23 September 2006 He was also known to knock golf balls onto the roof of the Muthaiga Country Club, the pink stucco gathering-place for Nairobi's white \u00e9lite, and then climb up to retrieve them.Thurman, Judith, Isak Dinesen: Life of a Storyteller, MacMillan, 1999, p. 123 At the outbreak of World War I, Delamere was placed in charge of intelligence on the Maasai border, monitoring the movements of German units in German East Africa.Herne, Brian, White Hunters: The Golden Age of African Safaris, 1999, pp. 99 Delamere entertained many high-ranking official visitors to Kenya, including then Under-Secretary for the Colonies, Winston Churchill. He was also the first president of the East African Turf Club.Herne, White Hunters, pp. 21\u201333 ==Government== Delamere embodied the many contradictions of the committed East African settler. He was personally fond of many Africans, and particularly enjoyed the company of the Maasai (even gently tolerating their habit of pilfering his cattle for their own herds),Bull, Safari, pp. 189\u2013191 but fought fiercely to maintain British supremacy in the colony. \"The extension of European civilization was in itself a desirable thing,\" he wrote in 1927. \"The British race... was superior to heterogeneous African races only now emerging from centuries of relative barbarism... the opening up of new areas by means of genuine colonisation was to the advantage to the world.\"Thurman, Judith, Isak Dinesen: The Life of a Storyteller, MacMillan, 1999, p. 180 Richard Meinertzhagen (himself a complex figure of Africa's colonial days) quoted Delamere as proclaiming, \u201cI am going to prove to you all that this is a white man's country.\u201dMeinertzhagen from African Diary, quoted in Ridgeway, Rick, The Shadow of Kilimanjaro, Owl Publishing Company, 1998, p. 194 These views held great sway among the settlers because Delamere was their undisputed, if unofficial, leader and, in some measure, spokesman for 30 years. He was a member of the Legislative Council, the Executive Council, and, in 1907, became President of the Colonists\u2019 Association.Trzebinski, Errol, The Kenya Pioneers, W.W. Norton 1986, p. 129 and Berman, Bruce, Control & Crisis in Colonial Kenya: The Dialectic of Domination, James Currey 1990, p. 140 In 1921 he established the Reform Party. Errol Trzebinski, who wrote a number of books on Kenya's colonial elite, wrote of him: \u201cDelamere was the Rhodes of Kenya and the settlers followed him both politically and spiritually.\u201d Trzebinski, The Kenya Pioneers, p. 23 Another contemporary and former colonist said more or less the same: \u201c(His) ascendancy over the settlers of Kenya has been enjoyed long enough for him to expect all men \u2013 and women \u2013 to do his bidding, and do it promptly. He is their Moses. For 25 years he has been their guide.\u201dHughes, East Africa: Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, p. 275 Beryl Markham, the aviator and author, was close with Delamere and his wife, who served for a few years as Markham's surrogate mother. She summed Delamere up thus: \"Delamere had two great loves \u2013 East Africa and the Masai People.... Delamere's character had as many facets as cut stone, but each facet shone with individual brightness. His generosity is legendary, but so is his sometimes wholly unjustified anger.... To him nothing was more important than the agricultural and political future of British East Africa \u2013 and so, he was a serious man. Yet his gaiety and occasional abandonment to the spirit of fun, which I have often witnessed, could hardly be equalled except by an ebullient schoolboy.\"Markham, Beryl, West With The Night, North Point Press, San Francisco, 1983, pp. 71\u201372 Delamere's efforts to steer Kenyan economic and racial policy, which often contravened the more pro-African intentions of the Colonial Office, were assisted by his powerful friends at home in Great Britain. Delamere, and other settlers, were so successful in affecting Kenya's politics that, in 1923, the British Government responded with the Devonshire White Paper, which declared officially that, in Kenya, the concerns of Africans were 'paramount', even when they conflicted with the needs of whites.Maxon, Robert, Struggle for Kenya: The Loss and Reassertion of Imperial Initiative, 1912\u20131923, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1993, pp. 13\u201314 == Legacy == Lord Delamere died in November 1931, at age 61. \"Lord Delamere Dies on his African Ranch; Leader in Deoelopment of Kenya Colony\u2014Was Pioneer in Big Game Hunting Expeditions,\" New York Times. 14 November 1931. He was survived by his second wife, formerly Lady Charles Markham (n\u00e9e Gwladys Helen Beckett, daughter of Hon. Rupert Eveleyn Beckett). \"Gwladys Lady Delamere\" (obituary). New York Times. 23 February 1943; His widow, Gwladys, became the second female Mayor of Nairobi. She was portrayed by actress Susan Fleetwood in the 1941-set film White Mischief (1987) as \"Gwladys Delamere\", one of Lord Erroll's Happy Valley friends. He was succeeded in the barony by his son from his first marriage, Thomas. At his death, he left Kenya's agricultural economy healthy enough to develop into one of the most stable economies in Africa. He also left unpaid bank loans totalling \u00a3500,000. Nairobi's Sixth Avenue was named Delamere Avenue to commemorate his place in the development of the colony, and an eight-foot bronze statue of the 3rd Baron was erected at the street's head, across from the New Stanley Hotel. When Kenya achieved independence in 1963, many white settlers opted to sell their farms and leave the country rather than submit to African rule. Delamere's family, by then headed by his son Thomas, the 4th hereditary Baron, elected to remain and accept Kenyan citizenship. Other traces of Delamere's colonial \"reign\" were not permitted to linger. Delamere Avenue was renamed as Kenyatta Avenue, after Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta, and the statue of Delamere was relocated to the family's Soysambu estate, where it faces out toward the mountain known locally as \"Delamere's Nose\" or \"The Sleeping Warrior.\" Among the Maasai, with whom Delamere was the first to establish a strong European connection, his family is now frequently reviled as those who \"stole\" the Maasai's land;Barton, The Curse of White Mischief but at his death, The Times reported that this complicated man had been amongst the very few Europeans who had made it a point to learn the Maasai language. One of the restaurants inside the Nairobi Norfolk Hotel has been known as the Lord Delamere Terrace for decades. \"Traveling in Style : Our Hearts Are in the Highlands\", David Lamb, LA Times, 20 March 1988, webpage: LAT-1988.
