It charted at No. 29 on the UK Albums Chart. \"Long Way from Home\", the leading track on the album reached No. 55 on the UK charts. It was the group's last album to feature original drummer Dave Dowle. ==Cover art== Lovehunter's controversial cover art, showing a naked woman straddling a large snake, was created by fantasy artist Chris Achilleos. It was the last album cover he designed for many years, until 2003 and Gary Hughes' rock opera Once and Future King Part I.MelodicRock.com Interviews: Gary Hughes - Once And Future King The original Lovehunter artwork was stolen in the 1980s. A similar idea had been used three years earlier for the cover of Jon Lord's Sarabande album.
