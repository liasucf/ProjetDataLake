It is located on the eastern side of the north- south A10 High Road in Tottenham, North London, from (measured via Kentish Town and Mortimer Street Junction) and situated between and . It is in Zone 3, in the London Borough of Haringey. South Tottenham to station (on the western, Seven Sisters Branch of the Lea Valley Lines and on the London Underground Victoria line) is considered an official out-of-station interchange by the National Rail timetable, and involves a short walk. This link will become fixed under the planned route for Crossrail 2, which sees a double-ended underground station built linking together South Tottenham and Seven Sisters stations.https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/crossrail2/october2015/user_uploads/s3.pdf == History == Map dated 1914, showing South Tottenham station top right, on the \"Tottenhm & Hampstead Jnt. (G.E. and Mid.)\" railway Opened as 'South Tottenham and Stamford Hill' station on 1 May 1871, on the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway, it was renamed 'South Tottenham' in 1949.Forgotten Stations of Greater London by J.E.Connor and B.HalfordChronology of London Railways by H.V.Borley == The station today == A short distance west of the station, on the far side of the A10, there is a single east-to-north spur towards Seven Sisters. To allow this to be reached by westbound trains, there is a facing crossover, located in the platform area. A short distance to the east of the station, there is a double turnout branching to the south, to reach the eastern route of the two north-south Lea Valley Lines. Visually from the platforms, this looks like it is the main line, since the main tracks curve to the north from the junction. (In fact, it was the original main line, since the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway eastwards was a later addition.) Both curves were formerly part of the route used by trains on the Palace Gates Line (which then continued onwards to ) but these days see infrequent use, with just one booked London Overground train, which travels between Liverpool Street and via and Seven Sisters, in one direction only. However, this train is susceptible to diversion and has not run via South Tottenham since 21 August 2018, and looks unlikely to resume soon. This surviving parliamentary train does not however stop at South Tottenham. The station has been receiving investment, following station management passing to London Overground in 2007. ==Connections== The station is served by London Buses routes 76, 149, 243, 318, 349, 476 and night route N73. ==Services== A basic 15 minute interval service (4 train per hour) operates from the station in both directions throughout the week (including Sundays), with one additional a.m peak period service to Low Level on weekdays only.GB eNRT December 2016 Edition, Table 62 ==References== ==External links== *South Tottenham Station in the 1960s on Flickr Category:Railway stations in the London Borough of Haringey Category:Former Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1871 Category:Railway stations served by London Overground ",
