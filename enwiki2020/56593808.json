Jan Gerbicz, or Herbisz was a thirteenth century bishop of Poznan (around 1240-1297).Stanis\u0142aw Karwowski, Biskupi pozna\u0144scy z drugiej po\u0142owy XIII wieku Roczniki Towarzystwa Przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 Nauk Pozna\u0144skiego vol.43, (Pozna\u0144, 1915). He came from a noble family of Wielkopolska of the Na\u0142\u0119cz\u00f3w coat of arms and was the Son of Tomasz, castellan of Poznan. He may have had a legal education and probably started his spiritual career from the cantor office in Pozna\u0144, which he held in the years 1269-1276. In a document of June 6, 1278, is already called an archdeacon. It is also known that he was a member of the Gniezno chapter. On August 17, 1285, he was certified for the first time as a Pozna\u0144 Bishop, but according to Jan D\u0142ugosz, he received the bishop's consecration from the hands of Archbishop Jakub \u015awinka only in May 1286 in L\u0105d. From the beginning of his ministry on the Pozna\u0144 throne, he was associated with the policy of Przemys\u0142 II and Jakub \u015awinka. Probably, on their initiative, he mediated in a dispute between Prince Henry IV Probus and Tomasz II Zaremba, bishop of Wroc\u0142aw, who was the co-author of the privilege granted by that same prince to the Wroc\u0142aw bishopric. In 1295, he took part in the coronation of Przemysl as the king of Poland, and after his murder in 1296, he was a signatory of the Curiatian system, under which Henry III G\u0142ogowczyk was to embrace southern Wielkopolska. He was a good administrator in managing the diocese. He bought several villages in Greater Poland, erected the altar of the Holy Trinity and Saint Jadwiga, founded by Przemys\u0142 II, founded the parish churches in Lus\u00f3w (more precisely in 1288 he established the parish in the existing church from 1244) and Mieszk\u00f3w and collegiate church of St. Jacob in G\u0142uszyna. In 1297 he obtained numerous estates for the Pozna\u0144 bishops along with broad immunities in the Duchy of Czersk in Mazovia from Boles\u0142aw II Mazowieckie. He invested in the Magdeburg Law of S\u0142upca and \u015ar\u00f3dka (which was part of the Pozna\u0144 conurbation) and several villages. He also tried several times to sort out tithing in the diocese. The Gniezno cathedral gave a codex, including the decrees of Gregory IX, which is still in its collections written down on parchment. The exact date of death is not known, but the document from June 17, 1297 still has his name, while December 20 of the same year, Andrzej Zaremba sat on the bishop's throne. ==References== Category:13th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Bishops of Pozna\u0144 ",
