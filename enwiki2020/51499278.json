    "text": "ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. The ESP32 series employs a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor in both dual-core and single-core variations and includes built-in antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power-management modules. ESP32 is created and developed by Espressif Systems, a Shanghai-based Chinese company, and is manufactured by TSMC using their 40 nm process. It is a successor to the ESP8266 microcontroller. == Features == ESP32 function block diagram. Features of the ESP32 include the following: * Processors: ** CPU: Xtensa dual-core (or single-core) 32-bit LX6 microprocessor, operating at 160 or 240 MHz and performing at up to 600 DMIPS ** Ultra low power (ULP) co-processor * Memory: 520 KiB SRAM * Wireless connectivity: ** Wi-Fi: 802.11 b/g/n ** Bluetooth: v4.2 BR/EDR and BLE (shares the radio with Wi-Fi) * Peripheral interfaces: ** 12-bit SAR ADC up to 18 channels ** 2 \u00d7 8-bit DACs ** 10 \u00d7 touch sensors (capacitive sensing GPIOs) ** 4 \u00d7 SPI ** 2 \u00d7 I\u00b2S interfaces ** 2 \u00d7 I\u00b2C interfaces ** 3 \u00d7 UART ** SD/SDIO/CE-ATA/MMC/eMMC host controller ** SDIO/SPI slave controller ** Ethernet MAC interface with dedicated DMA and IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol support ** CAN bus 2.0 ** Infrared remote controller (TX/RX, up to 8 channels) ** Motor PWM ** LED PWM (up to 16 channels) ** Hall effect sensor ** Ultra low power analog pre-amplifier * Security: ** IEEE 802.11 standard security features all supported, including WFA, WPA/WPA2 and WAPI ** Secure boot ** Flash encryption ** 1024-bit OTP, up to 768-bit for customers ** Cryptographic hardware acceleration: AES, SHA-2, RSA, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), random number generator (RNG) * Power management: ** Internal low-dropout regulator ** Individual power domain for RTC ** 5\u03bcA deep sleep current ** Wake up from GPIO interrupt, timer, ADC measurements, capacitive touch sensor interrupt == QFN packaged chip and module == ESP32 is housed in quad-flat no-leads (QFN) packages of varying sizes with 49 pads.
