    "text": "The relationship between Azerbaijan and Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation dates back to 1992 when Azerbaijan signed Istanbul Summit Declaration and the Bosphorus Statement. == Background == Black Sea Economic Cooperation was formed according to the Istanbul Summit Declaration and the Bosphorus Statement signed on 25 June 1992 by the Heads of State and Government of the countries in the region. BSEC gained international legal identity when it was transformed into a full-fledged organization - the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation on May 1, 1999 after its Charter entered into force. The Organization has 12 member states (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine) cooperating on various areas like agriculture, finance, education, culture, tourism, trade, transport, energy, and healthcare. Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs is the main decision- making organ. The Heads of the member countries meet generally every 5 years in the Summit Meetings. == History of relations == Azerbaijan is one of the founding members of the OBSEC and since 25 June 1992. Azerbaijan collaborates on trade, customs, transport, energy, environment, information and communications, science and technology issues based on mutual interests with the member states. Due to the ongoing conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh region, Azerbaijan started to actively participate in the work of OBSEC after ceasefire was declared. The President of Azerbaijan attended in the Summit of OBSEC on 25 October 1996 for the first time and signed Moscow Declaration. President Heydar Aliyev addressed the business conference on \u201cNew opportunities to Black Sea Region\u201d on April 28, 1997 in Istanbul. He also attended the Meeting of Head of the States held in Yalta (1998), and in Istanbul (1999 and 2002). During these events, he met with the presidents of member states and discussed mutual relations on different issues. During the period of 1992-2003, relations between OBSEC and Azerbaijan were more advisory, but since 2003 the relations have been characterized by the development of cooperation in specific areas. The relations with OBSEC are developing at a low pace because conflicts between member states (Azerbaijan- Armenia, Russia-Georgia, Greece-Turkey) and economic crisis have weakened inter-institutional integration processes.
