    "text": "A lithophysa (plural lithophysae, from Greek lithos \"stone\" + physan \"to blow\")What Are Lithophysae? is a felsic volcanic rock with a small spherulitic cavity and concentric chambers. Its shape is spherical or lenticular. These rocks are usually found within obsidian or rhyolite.Roger Weller Lithophysae cluster These cavities are believed to be caused by expanding gases in tuffs and rhyolitic lavas before solidification. If it has become lined with crystals it may be referred to as a geode or filled partially or fully with agate, jasper or opal is a thunderegg. The term vug is also used for similar cavities although the meaning of vug is usually restricted to cavities in rocks formed by the removal of material such as soluble minerals. These cavities usually contain layers of various colors (red, pink, gray, etc.) composed by crystals of quartz, chalcedony, hematite, fluoriteMineralienatlas and various colored oxides or other minerals. Lithophysae are one of the many forms of silica (SiO2),Geowiki as quartz, agate, opal, chalcedony, etc. They can have an average diameter , with a maximum of . Lithophysae are also related to the spherulites found in obsidians on the Italian island of Lipari, in Yellowstone National Park, and other places.Geological Survey Bulletin, Ed. 136 ==See also== * Lava balloon == References == Category:Igneous petrology Category:Mineralogy Category:Volcanic rocks Category:Volcanology ",
