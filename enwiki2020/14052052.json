    "text": "Otonycteris is a genus of vesper bats. Members of this genus are found in Northern Africa and Central Asia. Until recently, it was thought to be monotypic, but in 2010, the Turkestani long-eared bat was distinguished from the desert long-eared bat; previously, all populations were recognized as the desert long-eared bat. Currently, it consists of two species: *Desert long- eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii) **Subspecies ***Otonycteris hemprichii hemprichii: found in North Africa, the Levant, and the Middle East ***Otonycteris hemprichii cinerea: found in the mountains of Iran and Oman ***Otonycteris hemprichii jin: found in low-elevation deserts of the eastern Arabian Peninsula and southeast Iran *Turkestani long-eared bat (Otonycteris leucophaea) ==References== Category:Taxa named by Wilhelm Peters Category:Bat genera ",
