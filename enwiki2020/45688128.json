    "text": "Wonderland Cave is the largest cave in northwestern Arkansas. It is located on Dartmoor Road in Bella Vista, northeast of Bella Vista Lake and east of United States Route 71. The cave was first developed in the 1920s, and transformed into a nightclub in the 1930s, finishing a cavernous space within it with a concrete floor, stage for musicians, and decorations reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland. Portions of the facility have also been used historically for the aging of locally produced wine, and at least one session of the Arkansas General Assembly has been held in the cave. A local organization is developing plans to reopen the site as a tourist attraction. The cave was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Benton County, Arkansas ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures in Benton County, Arkansas Category:Caves of Arkansas Category:Landforms of Benton County, Arkansas Category:Tourist attractions in Benton County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Benton County, Arkansas Category:Bella Vista, Arkansas ",
