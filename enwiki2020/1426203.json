    "text": "All Summer Long is the sixth album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released July 13, 1964 on Capitol Records. It rose to number 4 in the US during a 49-week chart stay, and was certified gold by the RIAA. Lead single \"I Get Around\" was issued in May and became the band's first number one hit in the U.S. The album also had a UK Top 10 debut with a number peak. ==Background== It was the first LP the group recorded since the British Invasion, and the last where their music reveled in California beach culture until the 1968 single \"Do It Again\". Only one song explicitly references surfing: \"Don't Back Down\"; there are no hot rod songs at all for the first time, since \"Little Honda\" is about a motorcycle. \"Drive-In\" was recorded shortly after the release of Little Deuce Coupe in October 1963. That April, during the recording sessions of \"I Get Around\" and \"Little Honda\", Brian relieved his father Murry Wilson of his managerial duties after three years. An attempt at reconciliation on Murry's part, much of it captured on the tapes for the 1965 recording sessions of \"Help Me, Rhonda\", cemented the break. In an interview with Hit Parader, Brian later recalled, \"We love the family thing \u2013 y'know: three brothers, a cousin and a friend is a really beautiful way to have a group \u2013 but the extra generation can become a hang-up.\" ==Reception== ==The Girls on the Beach== The Beach Boys were later featured in the 1965 film The Girls on the Beach, performing \"Girls on the Beach\", \"Lonely Sea\", and \"Little Honda\". Their appearance was filmed in April 1964, a month before All Summer Long was completed. ==Track listing== * Mike Love was not originally credited for \"I Get Around\", \"All Summer Long\", \"Wendy\", \"Do You Remember?\", \"Drive-In\", and \"Don't Back Down\". His credits were awarded after a 1990s court case. ==Personnel== The Beach Boys performing \"I Get Around\" on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964 Partial credits courtesy of session archivist Craig Slowinski.
