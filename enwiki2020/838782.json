    "text": "Litom\u011b\u0159ice (; ) is a town in the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 24,000 inhabitants. It lies at the junction of the rivers Elbe and Oh\u0159e, approximately northwest of Prague. The area within the \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem Region is sometimes called The Garden of Bohemia due to the mild weather conditions important for growing fruits and grapes. During the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, many pensioners chose it over more southern areas of the Empire. The town is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Litom\u011b\u0159ice (part of Archdiocese of Prague), the 4th oldest \u2013 and 3rd still existing \u2013 Catholic diocese on present Czech territory. ==History== The settlement of Litom\u011b\u0159ice has a deep history of Paleolithic cultures as well as large Celtic settlements of the La T\u00e8ne culture, which did not survive the incoming Germanic attacks. The area was later settled by Germanic tribes, when Litom\u011b\u0159ice first appear on Ptolemy's Map in the 2nd Century under the name of Nomisterium. The Germanic tribes later migrated west and those remaining mingled with the incoming Slavs. Litom\u011b\u0159ice as seen from the Radob\u00fdl Hill One of the oldest Czech towns, Litom\u011b\u0159ice was established in the 10th century on the site of an early medieval P\u0159emyslid Dynasty fort. The area was settled by the Czech tribe of Litom\u011b\u0159ici, after which the town was named. In the High Middle Ages a small group of German settlers was also invited in by Slavic rulers. A royal-town statute was granted in 1219 by the king Ottokar I of Bohemia. From the 12th to the 17th century it was a significant trading centre in the Holy Roman Empire. The population suffered during the 15th century Hussite Wars. After the Protestant tensions with the Catholics that triggered the Thirty Years' War and the Protestants' defeat in the Battle of White Mountain, the surviving population of the city was forced to accept Catholicism or face property confiscation and the obligation to leave the kingdom. In this way, the town became a Catholic bishop's residency in 1655. As a result, the Czech Protestant population shrank and the town became largely Germanized. Occupation, 1938 In 1918, Bohemia, Moravia and Czech Silesia became constituent parts of the newly-created Czechoslovakia (which was confirmed by the Treaty of St. Germain), along with a large border area inhabited predominantly by Germans. Local Germans tried to join German Austria (which in turn aimed to join post-war German Reich), but Czechoslovak troops prevented this. Known under the informal name of the Sudetenland, the region became the subject of political controversy in the following years. Slavs settled there again, but remained a minority. In 1938, after the Munich Agreement, German troops occupied the Sudetenland (and all the rest of Czech lands a few months later). The Czech population, which had grown to about 5,000 people, had to leave again. Jews from Leitmeritz were forced to flee to the Protectorate or were deported during the Holocaust in the Sudetenland. From March 1944 to May 1945, Leitmeritz concentration camp was located west of the town. 18,000 prisoners passed through the camp and were forced to work mostly on excavating underground factories (Richard I and II) under Radob\u00fdl. 4,500 died. In the final stages of World War II, German troops retreated to escape the advancing Red Army. The Czech resistance took control of the castle on 27 April 1945, and after a few days they started negotiations with the German commander about the terms of his surrender. The Wehrmacht capitulated in the night after 8 May, but German troops fled on 9 May, just before Soviet troops entered the town on 10 May 1945. Most of the German population of the town was expelled by the so-called Bene\u0161 decrees in August 1945, along with about 2.5 million other former Czechoslovak citizens of German ethnicity from the country. ==Sights== Old Town Hall and the Church of All Saints Main Square with the Town Hall There are several main sights already visible when approaching Litom\u011b\u0159ice. The Baroque St. Stephen's Cathedral at the Cathedral Square (D\u00f3msk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed) was built in place of an older Romanasque basilica in the years 1664\u20131668. The interior is almost completely authentic with main and six side altars and a lot of original paintings. Right next to the dome is a bishop's residence built in 1683\u20131701 by Giulio Broggio. On the main square there is All-Saints Church and within distance there is an Annunciation (Lady Day) Church, another masterpiece built by the son of Giulio Broggio, Octavio. The old town hall (now city museum) and Black Eagle House (D\u016fm u \u010dern\u00e9ho orla) on the main square are also worthy a look. The symbol of the city is a chalice, since the watchout tower on the Town Hall has this shape. There are numerous cellars connected by an extensive web of underground ways under the town. In some places, the cellars were built in three floors. The ways are about three kilometers () long and they belong to the longest of their kind in the Czech Republic. Unfortunately, only of these underground ways are open to the public. You can notice the ancient town wall when entering the town. The original town wall was built in the Gothic style. Northern Bohemian Gallery of Creative Arts (SGVU) is based close the main square. Extensive collection spans from 13th century to contemporary art with numerous other exhibitions during the year. ==Population== * 1 December 1930: 18,498 (10,878 Germans, 6,485 Czechs, 143 JewsMichael Rademacher (dissertation): Deutsche Verwaltungsgeschichte von der Reichseinigung 1871 bis zur Wiedervereinigung 1990.
