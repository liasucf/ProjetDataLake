    "text": "The International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) supports, represents and works to strengthen professional associations of midwives on a global basis. At present, ICM has over 100 members, representing midwifery associations in around 100 countries. The ICM works with midwives and midwifery associations globally to secure women\u2019s rights and access to midwifery care before, during and after childbirth. The ICM has worked alongside UN agencies and other partners for decades in global initiatives to help reduce the numbers of mothers and babies who die in and around childbirth, and evidence is growing that shows expanding midwifery care is one of the best ways to combat maternal mortality. The drive for safer motherhood continues to gain strength as more women worldwide achieve access to midwifery care. == Vision == ICM envisions a world where every childbearing woman has access to a midwife's care for herself and her newborn. == Mission == ICM seeks to strengthen member associations and to advance the profession of midwifery globally by promoting autonomous midwives as the most appropriate caregivers for childbearing women and in keeping birth normal, in order to enhance the reproductive health of women, and the health of their newborn and their families. ==Projects== === Midwifery education === \"ICM Global standards for midwifery education\" are one of the essential pillars of ICM\u2019s efforts to strengthen midwifery worldwide by preparing fully qualified midwives to provide high quality, evidence-based health services for women, newborns and childbearing families. The education standards were developed in tandem with the update of essential competencies for basic midwifery practice, which define the core content of any midwifery education programme. They are available on the ICM Website in English, French and Spanish. ==History== It is known that midwives have been making efforts to meet internationally for over 100 years. There are records of a midwives\u00b4 conference held in Berlin, Germany, in the year 1900, when over 1,000 midwives attended. This was arranged at a time without the use of telephones, computers, credit cards or aeroplanes, and women travelling on their own was difficult and not always acceptable. In 1919, a group of European midwives, centred in Antwerp, Belgium, established the first beginnings of what was to become the International Confederation of Midwives. By this time, many countries already had a national association of midwives; communication among them increased and a series of regular meetings was launched. During the 1930s and 1940s, travel and communication in Europe was disrupted by war and unrest. Unfortunately, the detailed records of the earlier midwives\u00b4 meetings and documents were destroyed. However, the desire to continue international work was still strong. In 1954, the initiative grew again and this time the location was London, UK. For the first time, the name of \u00b4International Confederation of Midwives\u00b4 was decided, and also the idea of regular triennial congresses was established. Since 1954 the series of such meetings every three years has remained unbroken. The ICM now has over 100 members \u2013 all autonomous midwifery associations, from around 100 countries spanning four regions: Africa, Asia Pacific, the Americas and Europe. Each member association sends delegates to the ICM Council, which is the overall governing body; each region elects representatives to a smaller board, which oversees the continuing business of the Confederation. The ICM Council decided in 1999 to move the location of the headquarters office from London to The Hague, in the Netherlands, and it has been established there ever since. The headquarters permanent staff has increased from the appointment in 1987 of one part-time executive secretary, to the present larger group including the Secretary General, Programme Co-ordinator, Communications Manager and other part-time administrative assistance. The ICM journal, International Midwifery, is now in its 18th year of communicating \"to, from and among midwives across the world\" and the ICM website at www.internationalmidwives.org has been assisting speedier access to ICM news and activities since 2000. International congresses are held every three years. The site of each is decided six years ahead, and the event is co-hosted by ICM and one of its member associations. Venues over the past 50 years have included Jerusalem, Kobe, Manila, Santiago, Sydney, Vancouver and Washington, as well as numerous European cities. These congresses have become the major regular focus for midwives\u2019 global business, professional and scientific meetings. In addition, regional meetings and conferences are often held in the years between congresses. The ICM's Mission is to \"advance world-wide the aims and aspirations of midwives in the attainment of improved outcomes for women in their childbearing years, their newborn and their families wherever they reside\". The ICM is an official supporting organisation of Healthcare Information For All by 2015, a global initiative whose goals include: By 2015, every midwife will have access to the information they need to learn, to diagnose, to provide appropriate care and treatment, and to save lives. == Member associations== Since its founding, the ICM has grown from a small group of midwifery associations in western Europe to a major confederation of over 100 autonomous member associations from countries in every part of the globe. Criteria for membership demand that each association is headed by midwives who determine their own governance and activities, and are committed to the mission, vision and aims of ICM.
