The area is located in the borough of \u00d6stermalm and is undergoing brownfield redevelopment. Article about Norra Djurg\u00e5rdsstaden on Stockholm official site The area consists of former harbours and industries. An important part of the development concerns a concentration of port operations to the two piers in V\u00e4rtahamnen and at Frihamnen. 10,000 dwellings and 30,000 workplaces will be developed in the area up to 2025. The project is part of the Clinton Climate Initiative. ==History== Norra Djurg\u00e5rdsstaden was historically a part of Kungliga Djurg\u00e5rden. Since the 1880s, this area together with its harbour has been developed into one of Stockholm's largest industrial areas. The direct access to the Baltic Sea was one of the reasons to build the port of V\u00e4rtahamnen in 1884. To a beginning, this harbour was mainly used to transporting coal, used as fuel to the local gasworks. During the start of the 21st century, it was decided for this area to be modernised and the previous industries to be demolished. ==Photo gallery== June 2013.
