    "text": "The Deltaproteobacteria are a class of Proteobacteria. All species of this group are, like all Proteobacteria, Gram-negative. The Deltaproteobacteria comprise a branch of predominantly aerobic genera, the fruiting body-forming Myxobacteria which release myxospores in unfavorable environments, and a branch of strictly anaerobic genera, which contains most of the known sulfate- (Desulfovibrio, Desulfobacter, Desulfococcus, Desulfonema, etc.) and sulfur- reducing bacteria (e.g. Desulfuromonas spp.) alongside several other anaerobic bacteria with different physiology (e.g. ferric iron-reducing Geobacter spp. and syntrophic Pelobacter and Syntrophus spp.). A pathogenic intracellular deltaproteobacterium has recently been identified. ==Phylogeny== The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA-based LTP release 111 by 'The All- Species Living Tree' Project 'The All-Species Living Tree' Project. Notes: \u2660 Strains found at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) but not listed in the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LSPN) \u2663 International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology or International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSB/IJSEM) published species that are in press. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Proteobacteria ",
