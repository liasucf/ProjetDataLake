    "text": "Terry Leyden (born 1 October 1945) is an Irish former Fianna F\u00e1il politician who served as a Senator (elected by the Labour Panel) from September 2002 to March 2020, and previously during December 1992 (upon being nominated by the Taoiseach). He served as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) from 1977 to 1992. He was elected to Roscommon County Council in 1974, and re-elected in 1979 and 1985. Leyden was elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann at his first attempt, in the 1977 general election, when he was returned to the 21st D\u00e1il as a TD for the Roscommon\u2013Leitrim constituency. He was returned for the new Roscommon constituency at the 1981 general election, and re-elected a further four times before losing his seat at the 1992 general election in the new Longford\u2013Roscommon constituency. From March to December 1982, he served as Minister of State at the Department of Transport and Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. He then served as Minister of State at the Department of Health from 1987 to 1989, and as Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce from 1989 to 1992. Following his D\u00e1il defeat he sat very briefly in the 19th Seanad, having been nominated by the Taoiseach Albert Reynolds on 2 December 1992. After the 19th Seanad last sat on 17 December 1992 he stood unsuccessfully in the 1993 election to Seanad \u00c9ireann by the Administrative Panel, and was unsuccessful again in 1997 when seeking election by the Industrial and Commercial Panel. Leyden was re-elected to Roscommon County Council in 1999, a position that he held until the ending of the dual mandate in 2003 \u2013 because by that time he was also a Senator \u2013 when his seat was taken by his daughter Orla Leyden. Leyden was also a member of the Western Health Board from 1992 to 2002, and was Chairman from 2001 to 2002. He was elected to the 22nd Seanad by the Labour Panel in September 2002 and re-elected in 2007, 2011 and 2016. He was the Fianna F\u00e1il Seanad spokesperson on Children and European Affairs. In May 2010, he invoked Parliamentary privilege and accused The Irish Times columnist Fintan O'Toole of incitement to riot, which O'Toole denied. This came about as a result of the latter's addressing of a demonstration against the bank bailouts proposed by the Government, which later turned violent. In July 2013, he claimed that Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini were \"good Christians\" while speaking in the Seanad. On realising the absurd nature of his comments, he apologised to the chair and admitted he was distracted. He was a member of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland by virtue of inclusion on the \"Minister's List\". Prior to his inclusion on the RIAI register he was a member of the Irish Architects Society, the majority of whose members did not have formal qualifications for entry on the architect's register. He was the Fianna F\u00e1il Seanad spokesperson on Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources. He retired from politics at the 2020 Seanad election. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of NUI Galway Category:Fianna F\u00e1il TDs Category:Local councillors in County Roscommon Category:Members of the 21st D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 22nd D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 23rd D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 24th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 25th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 26th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 19th Seanad Category:Members of the 22nd Seanad Category:Members of the 23rd Seanad Category:Members of the 24th Seanad Category:Members of the 25th Seanad Category:Ministers of State of the 23rd D\u00e1il Category:Ministers of State of the 25th D\u00e1il Category:Ministers of State of the 26th D\u00e1il Category:Nominated members of Seanad \u00c9ireann Category:Fianna F\u00e1il senators ",
