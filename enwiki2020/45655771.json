    "text": "Sheikh Mustafa Dev\u00e2t\u00ee Efendi was a Jelveti sheikh of the seventeenth century Ottoman Empire. His birthplace and date are not known. He was the son of Arslan A\u011fa. Since as a youth he worked as a scribe (divit\u00e7i or dev\u00e2t\u00ee) he was given the name Dev\u00e2t\u00ee. He became affiliated with the Jelveti order through Muk'ad Ahmed Efendi, a khalifa of Aziz Mahmud Hudayi Efendi. He advanced quickly along the Sufi path and was sent by Muk'ad Ahmed Efendi to guide the people of Kastamonu. After a period there, he returned to Istanbul and joined the ulama. In 1657, he built a tekke (khanqah) in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, in the B\u00fclb\u00fclderesi Selmana\u011fa neighborhood, called the \u015eeyhc\u00e2mii Tekkesi or the Dev\u00e2t\u00ee Mustafa Efendi Tekkesi. His tomb is in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar. ==References== \u00dcsk\u00fcdarli Meshurlar Ansiklopedisi, pp. 279\u2013280.
