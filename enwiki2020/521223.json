    "text": "Pinus glabra, the spruce pine, is a tree found on the coastal plains of the southern United States, from southern South Carolina south to northern Florida and west to southern Louisiana. This pine is a straight-growing, medium-sized species, attaining heights of 20\u201340 m. The leaves are needle-like, in bundles of two, 5\u20138 cm long, slender (1 mm thick), and glossy dark green. The small, slender cones are 4\u20136 cm long, with weak prickles on the scales that are soon shed. Pinus glabra differs markedly from most other pines in that it does not occur in largely pure pine forests, but is typically found as scattered trees in moist woodland habitats in mixed hardwood forest. To be able to compete successfully in such habitats, it has adapted to greater shade tolerance than most other pines.
