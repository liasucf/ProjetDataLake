Blazier; and commissioned on 18 February 1943, Lieutenant Eskil A. Bjork, USNR, in command. ==Service history== During World War II, LST-461 was assigned to the Asiatic-Pacific theater. She took part in the capture and occupation of Saipan in June and July 1944; in the capture and occupation of Tinian in July 1944; the Leyte operation in October 1944; the Lingayen Gulf landings in January 1945; in the Nasugbu operations in January 1945; and the assault and occupation of Okinawa Gunto in May 1945. Following the war, LST-461 returned to the United States and was decommissioned on 2 September 1947, and struck from the Navy list on 16 September, that same year. On 30 March 1948, the tank landing ship was sold to Consolidated Builders, Inc., of Seattle, Washington, and subsequently scrapped. ==Honors and awards== LST-461 earned six battle stars for her World War II service. == Notes == ;Citations == Bibliography == Online resources * * * ==External links== * Category:1942 ships Category:World War II amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:LST-1-class tank landing ships of the United States Navy Category:S3-M2-K2 ships Category:Ships built in Vancouver, Washington Category:Ships of the Aleutian Islands campaign ",
