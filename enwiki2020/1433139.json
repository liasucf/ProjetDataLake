It was established on the farm Koffiekuil in 1892 and named after a Dutch Reformed Church minister Reverend HJ Luckhoff. Nowadays the bulk of the sheep found in this district are dorper sheep and not merino. A small number of farmers also stock an indigenous sheep breed known as the damara. The town is located 82 km north-west of Philippolis and 56 km west of Fauresmith. It was established in 1892 on the farm Koffiekuil. Probably named after Heinrich Jacob Luckhoff (1842-1943), Minister of the Dutch Reformed Church in Fauresmith at that time. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Populated places in the Letsemeng Local Municipality Category:Karoo Category:Populated places established in 1892 ",
