Ellet's daily enrollment for the 2012\u20132013 school year was 1,147. ==History== The bulk of the land in the Ellet District was purchased in 1810 from Simon Perkins by three sons of Samuel Ellet, an early settler who moved into the area that year. The Ellet District was annexed to the city of Akron in 1929 and became part of Akron Public Schools the same year. A new Ellet High School on Woolf Avenue opened in 1950. Additions to the school were built in 1957, 1975 and 1987. The school replaced the older Ellet High School on Canton Road, which had served both elementary and high school students since 1891. The school on Canton Road was closed and demolished in 2008 to make way for the new Ritzman Community Learning Center. It was originally Springfield High School, and became Ellet High School in 1929 when the land was annexed from Springfield. In 2019 the new Ellet Community Learning Center opened on the same land adjacent to the older high school. ==Athletics== Ellet's official school colors are orange and white, although the varsity letter jackets and many of the team uniforms also feature navy blue. Ellet's mascot is the Orangeman. Current varsity sports for boys at the school include football, soccer, cross country, golf, wrestling, basketball, bowling, baseball, tennis, and track.
