    "text": "Sceloporus scalaris, the bunch grass lizard, is a species of small, phrynosomatid lizard. ==Taxonomy== Currently, Sceloporus scalaris belongs in the scalaris group with a fluctuating number of other species.Grummer, J. A., Bryson, R. W., & Reeder, T. W. (2014). Species delimitation using Bayes factors: simulations and application to the Sceloporus scalaris species group (Squamata: Phrynosomatidae). Systematic biology, 63(2), 119-133. In 2010, Wiens et al. recognized the following species: Sceloporus aeneus, S. bicanthalis, S.chaneyi, S.goldmani, S. scalaris, and S. subniger while others such as Bryson et al. 2011 recognize: Sceloporus aeneus, S. bicanthalis, S.chaneyi, S.goldmani, S. samcolemani, S. scalaris, and S. slevini J.J.

Bryson Jr. et al. / Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 62 (2012) 447\u2013457 ==Distribution== S. scalaris is widely distributed in Mexico, expanding northward from the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt to the southern United States of Arizona and New Mexico. The species is typically found in high elevation grasslands (1500 \u2013 3000 m).Ortega, A., & Barbault, R. (1986). Reproduction in the high elevation Mexican lizard Sceloporus scalaris. Journal of herpetology, 20(1), 111-114. ==Description== Bunch grass lizards are typically grey in color, often with orange and yellow coloration around the neck and behind the forelimbs. Males will have more of this vibrant coloration on their underside while female undersides tend to be white. Adults range from 52\u201362 mm snout-to- vent length (Ortega and Barbault, 1986). ==Reproduction== Many species of Sceloporus are ovoviviparous including the scalaris species. Juveniles are seen for the first time in late August (Ortega and Barbault, 1986). ==References== Category:Phrynosomatidae Category:Reptiles of Mexico Category:Reptiles of the United States Category:Taxa named by Arend Friedrich August Wiegmann Category:Reptiles described in 1828 ",
