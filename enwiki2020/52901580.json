The narrator, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Stein, travels in China in search of examples of classical Chinese culture and understanding how contemporary Chinese society relates to it. An English translation by Ottilie Mulzet was published in 2016. ==Reception== In the Los Angeles Review of Books, Michael LaPointe wrote that \"Krasznahorkai channels the works of W.G. Sebald, who saw ashes on every attraction, and \u2014 unexpectedly \u2014 the novels of Michel Houellebecq, which trace the extension of the domain of the market into the sacred realms of human experience\". Publishers Weekly called the book an \"occasionally frustrating yet often dazzling travel memoir\". ==References== ==External links== * Hungarian publicity page * English-language publicity page Category:2004 novels Category:Books about China Category:Hungarian novels Category:Travel novels Category:Works by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai Category:Magvet\u0151 books ",
