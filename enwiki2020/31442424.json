Burroughs and Brion Gysin and released on Zorn's Tzadik label in 2010.Tzadik catalogue ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars stating \"Interzone is one of John Zorn's more ambitious multi-part pieces. While some claim this is a return to the file card process and recordings like Spillane, Interzone feels different: it's more an ensemble work even when it travels through genres, dynamics, textures, and musical geographies\".Jurek, T.
