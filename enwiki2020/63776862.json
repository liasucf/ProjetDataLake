    "text": "The Hub (also referred to as Hub Minneapolis and Hub on Campus) is a luxury residential apartment building located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The project was first announced under the working name 311 Harvard, before being renamed as the Hub during construction. The building was designed by Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture and includes 407 residential units designated for the campus population of the nearby University of Minnesota. It also contains leasable retail space, with current tenants including Caribou Coffee, Chase Bank, and Roti Modern Mediterranean. == Construction and opening == Construction began on the Hub in October 2016 with a traditional groundbreaking ceremony. In the official proposal for the Hub, the completed project would become one of the tallest structures located near the University of Minnesota campus. == Design == The exterior contains a 268 ft (82 m) glass curtain wall, inspired by neighboring urban walls within the vicinity. Holly Dolezalek from Minneapolis financial magazine Finance & Commerce named it one of the \"Top Projects of 2018\", highlighting its efforts to continue construction despite numerous setbacks. == Location == The Hub is located at the intersection of Harvard Street Southeast and Washington Avenue Southeast, adjacent to the Metro Green Line East Bank light rail station. It was built atop a former retail block in the East Bank neighborhood of Minneapolis, with previous businesses such as Big 10 Restaurant and Espresso Expos\u00e9 becoming displaced after the project's announcement. == References == == External links == * Official website Category:2018 establishments in Minnesota Category:Apartment buildings in Minnesota Category:Buildings and structures in Minneapolis Category:Residential buildings completed in 2018 Category:Residential skyscrapers in Minneapolis ",
