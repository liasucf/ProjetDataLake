There were 109 inhabitants in the 1830s. The population in 1870 was 106, in 24 houses. In 1961, the population was 69. The parish subsequently came under the Church in Wales parish of Narberth and Tenby.

Reynalton Colliery closed in 1921. ===Parish church=== The parish church of St James was described by Samuel Lewis in 1833 as \"a small ancient edifice, with a low tower, and in a very dilapidated condition\". It has mediaeval origins and retains its original tower; the building was restored in the 19th century and is now a Grade II listed building. ===Internet access=== In December 2008, Reynalton was one of six broadband \"not-spots\" in Wales \u2013 communities without high-speed Internet access; the Welsh Assembly Government in conjunction with BT confirmed that coverage in these areas would soon be upgraded to bring them into line with the rest of the UK. In 2010, Reynalton became broadband enabled. ==References== ==External links== *Further historical information and sources on GENUKI Category:Villages in Pembrokeshire ",
