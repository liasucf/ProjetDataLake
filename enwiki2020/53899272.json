She attended the Abe Gakuin High School in Tokyo, and won the Asian Junior Championship in her weight class when she was 18. That same year, she entered the All Japan Wrestling championships, placing third in her weight class. Hashimoto continued to pursue amateur wrestling into college, attending Nihon University where she placed third in the World Student Championship at the age of 20. She had hopes of competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, but was unsuccessful in qualifying. She graduated from University in 2015, and after watching a match involving Meiko Satomura, decided to begin training as a wrestler once again. On June 11, she once again took and passed a tryout, and subsequently enrolled in the Sendai Girls dojo. == Professional wrestling career == Hashimoto was trained by Meiko Satomura and made her debut on October 11, 2015, teaming with Shinobu Kandori to defeat Manami Toyota and Mika Iwata.
