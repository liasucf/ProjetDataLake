He appears to have been a descendant of Walter I de Claville (floruit 1086), one of the 52 Devon Domesday Book tenants-in-chief of King William the Conqueror, who had 32 landholdings in Devon.Thorn, part 2, 24,15; Thorn chap.24, 1-32 lists all his Domesday Book landholdings The original Anglo-Saxon name of the site donated by Walter II, perhaps a sub-manor of Burlescombe, was \"Leigh\" (Domesday Book LeigeThorn, part 2, 24,15), which after the foundation of the Abbey became known as \"Canons' Leigh\"Thorn, Caroline & Frank, (eds.) Domesday Book, (Morris, John, gen.ed.) Vol. 9, Devon, Parts 1 & 2, Phillimore Press, Chichester, 1985, part 2 (notes) chap.24,15 and was Latinised by mediaeval scribes to Leigh Canonicorum (i.e. \"Leigh of the canons\"), now \"Canonsleigh\". By 1284 the number of canons had declined to seven, and these were evicted in 1285 when the widow Maud de Lacy, Countess of Gloucester(d.1289), formerly the wife of Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester (d.1262), refounded the establishment as a nunnery as the Abbey Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist and Saint Etheldreda. In 1286 the abbess was granted licence to hold weekly markets. It was not especially wealthy. The number of historical records that survive for this establishment is not large which limits a full knowledge of its history. However recent research by Atkinson has added much to its known history.

Of its later history, in September 1546 Sir Richard Grenville (c.1495-1550), of Stowe, Cornwall and Bideford, and Roger Blewett of Holcombe Rogus paid nearly \u00a31,170 for the manors of Canonsleigh in Burlescombe and Tynyell in Landulph.History of Parliament biography , quoting Letters & Papers of Henry VIII, x, xii, xiv, xvi, xxi The remains today consist of a small 15th-century gatehouse that has two large blocked arches and, to the east, further fragments that include ruined buildings, the remains of a reredorter and a possible south wall of the eastern range of buildings.Cherry, Bridget & Pevsner, Nikolaus, The Buildings of England: Devon.
