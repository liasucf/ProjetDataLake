It grants master's degrees, doctoral degrees, and certificates. Established in 1909, the school also offers research fellowship opportunities at the postdoctoral level through the National Academies' National Research Council research associateship program.Research Associateship Programs. Sites.nationalacademies.org. Retrieved on 17 October 2011. == History == On 9 June 1909, Secretary of the Navy George von L. Meyer signed General Order No. 27, establishing a school of marine engineering at Annapolis, Maryland. On 31 October 1912, Meyer signed Navy General Order No. 233, which renamed the school the Postgraduate Department of the United States Naval Academy. The order established courses of study in ordnance and gunnery, electrical engineering, radio telegraphy, naval construction, and civil engineering and continued the program in marine engineering. During World War II, Fleet Admiral Ernest King, Chief of Naval Operations and Commander-in-Chief United States Fleet, established a commission to review the role of graduate education in the Navy. In 1945, Congress passed legislation to make the school a fully accredited, degree-granting graduate institution. Two years later, Congress adopted legislation authorizing the purchase of an independent campus for the school. Herrmann Hall A postwar review team, which had examined 25 sites nationwide, had recommended the old Hotel Del Monte in Monterey as a new home for the Postgraduate School. During World War II, the Navy had leased the facilities, first for a pre-flight training school, then for part of the Electronics Training Program. Negotiations with the Del Monte Properties Company led to the purchase of the hotel and of surrounding land for $2.13 million. The Postgraduate School moved to Monterey in December 1951. Today, the school has over 40 programs of study including highly regarded M.S. and PhD programs in management, national security affairs, electrical and computer engineering, mechanical and astronautical engineering, systems engineering, space systems and satellite engineering, physics, oceanography meteorology, and other disciplines, all with an emphasis on military applications. Former Guantanamo Bay Naval Base commander and World War II and Korean War veteran, RADM Edward J. O\u2019Donnell, assumed the role as superintendent of the school in 1965. He himself graduated from the school in the 30's with a degree in ordnance engineering. He would leave the role of superintendent in 1967 after retiring from the Navy. The school's Space Systems Academic Group (through the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, which was closed in 2005) has graduated several astronauts. The school is home to the Center for Information Systems Security Studies and Research (CISR) and the Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS).Center for Homeland Defense & Security. Chds.us. Retrieved on 17 October 2011. CISR is America's foremost center for defense- related research and education in Information Assurance (IA), Inherently Trustworthy Systems (ITC), and defensive information warfare; and CHDS provides the first homeland security master's degree in the United States. On 27 November 2012, Vice Admiral Daniel T. Oliver (retired) and Provost Dr. Leonard Ferrari were relieved of duty by Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus. A Navy press release cited findings from a Naval Inspector General investigation which included Oliver's misuse of standard contracting procedures to circumvent federal hiring and compensation authorities. The investigation also found that both Oliver and Ferrari \"inappropriately accepted gifts from an independent private foundation organized to support the school.\" == Academics == NPS offers graduate programs through four graduate schools and twelve departments. The different schools and departments offer various PhD and M.S.-level degrees: *Graduate School of Business & Public Policy includes the academic groups: #Acquisition Management #Enterprise Management #Financial Management #Management #Manpower and Economics #Operations and Logistics Management *Graduate School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, includes the units: #Applied Mathematics Department #Electrical and Computer Engineering Department #Mechanical and Astronautical Engineering Department #Meteorology Department #Oceanography Department #Physics Department #Systems Engineering Department #Space Systems Academic Group #Navigation Systems Engineering Institute #Under Sea Warfare Systems Academic Committee #Remote Sensing Center #Spacecraft Robotics Laboratory *Graduate School of Operational & Information Sciences includes the departments, located in Glasgow Hall, which has 50 stairs: #Computer Sciences #Defense Analysis #Information Sciences #Operations Research *School of International Graduate Studies with multiple centers: # National Security Affairs Academic Program # Defense Resource Management Institute # Center on Contemporary Conflict # Center for Civil Military Relations # Center for Stabilization Reconstruction and Studies # Leadership Development and Education for Sustained Peace # International Defense and Acquisition Resource Management # Center for Homeland Defense and Security # International Graduate Program Office # Program for Culture & Conflict Studies NPS also operates an active, and for US warfighters and civilian government employees. Center for Homeland Defense and Security Emergency responders including local, tribal, state, and federal can enroll in a variety of programs including online distributed learning program, executive education programs, and most prominently a Master of Arts program. Masters of Arts Program The M.A. program is offered at no cost to eligible local, tribal, state, and federal officials. To accommodate participants' time constraints, NPS requires students to be in residence only two weeks every quarter (for a total of twelve weeks for the whole program). Students complete the remainder of their coursework online. ===Students=== NPS students are mostly active-duty officers from all branches of the U.S. military, although U.S. Government civilians and members of foreign militaries can also matriculate under a variety of programs. Most of the faculty are civilians. == Notable alumni == *Earl E.
