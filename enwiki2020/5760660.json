    "text": "The National Numeracy Strategy arose out of the National Numeracy Project in 1996, led by a Numeracy Task Force in England. The strategy included an outline of expected teaching in mathematics for all pupils from Reception to Year 6. In 2003, the strategy, including the framework for teaching, was absorbed into the broader Primary National Strategy. The framework for teaching was updated in 2006. ==See also== *National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) *Key Stage *Chunking (division) *Grid method multiplication *Number bond ==Further reading== * Department for Education and Employment (January 1998), Numeracy matters: the preliminary report of the Numeracy Task Force, London: DfEE * Department for Education and Employment (1998), The implementation of the National Numeracy Strategy: The final report of the Numeracy Task Force, London: DfEE * Department for Education and Employment (1999), The National Numeracy Strategy: framework for teaching mathematics from reception to Year 6, London: DfEE. -- browse (via Dudley Council); browse (via CountOn.org); download (via Norfolk County Council). * QCA (1999), Standards in mathematics: exemplification of key learning objectives from reception to year 6 * Gary Eason, Back to school for parents, BBC News, 13 February 2000 * Rob Eastaway, Why parents can't do maths today, BBC News, 10 September 2010 * Mary Ruddle, How maths teaching has changed - the new order of learning, mad4maths website, 2007 * Ian Thompson (2000), Is the National Numeracy Strategy evidence based?, Mathematics Teaching, 171, 23\u201327 * Dylan V.
