BenEzra, who had been in the door industry for over a decade realized he could expand his business by manufacturing windows. Basing his design on British manufacturing techniques WeatherGard became the first Michigan window manufacturer to introduce four point welding, and first to offer painted exterior colors. WeatherGard would later expand its operations, moving to its current location in Oak Park in 1995 and introducing insulation, roofing, gutter, and siding installation services. WeatherGard focuses primarily on residential services, but has also taken part in commercial work such the restoration of the historic Alden Park Towers in Detroit. In 2015 WeatherGard received an Excellence in Energy Efficiency Award from Consumers Energy. ==References== ==External links== * WeatherGard Official site Category:Companies based in Michigan Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1988 Category:Privately held companies based in Michigan Category:Window manufacturers ",
