E. A. Joy, K. K. Bell, & M. K. Ramsey (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007), p. 302. == Research and practice focus == Uebel\u2019s research is best described as humanistic. Examining issues such as the formation of utopian thought, the ideology of gender relations, and the potentials of human existence, Uebel has urged a reconnaissance of disciplines as seemingly disparate as psychoanalysis, gerontology, philosophy, and social science. Uebel is forging an approach to literary, philosophical, and social phenomena that eludes the narcissistic allegorization of history that mires much contemporary cultural studies work. Increasingly, Uebel's writing focuses on the currents of cultural analysis in the humanities.https://utexas.academia.edu/MichaelUebel As a psychotherapist, Uebel\u2019s practice and research focus on issues related to the social contexts of psychopathology and treatment modalities that address the person, the social body, and the relational world, including mindfulness modalities, gestalt therapy, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/name/Michael_Uebel_PhD,LCSW_Austin_Texas_46379 == Influences == Significant influences on Uebel include the humanistic psychologists Rollo May, Abraham Maslow, Fritz Perls, Thomas Szasz, and Robert Jay Lifton, the politically engaged psychoanalysts Wilhelm Reich, Erich Fromm, and Herbert Marcuse, and the less easily pigeon-holed thinkers Walter Benjamin, F\u00e9lix Guattari, and Paul Goodman. == Major works == Uebel\u2019s major works to date include a study of the legend of Prester JohnUebel has been called \"one of the foremost scholars and the translator of the 'Letter of Prester John.'\" See Michael Calabrese, Review of The Postcolonial Middle Ages, in The Medieval Review, 2001, 01.10.16. and utopian thought formation in the early Middle Ages (Ecstatic Transformation: On the Uses of Alterity in the Middle Ages, 2005), a volume of essays on the cultural intersections of race and masculinity (with Harry Stecopoulos, Race and the Subject of Masculinities, 1997), and a volume of essays on the significance of labor in the High Middle Ages (with Kellie Robertson, The Middle Ages at Work, 2004).
