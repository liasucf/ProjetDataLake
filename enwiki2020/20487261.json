The residence has continued to provide for public service through its current use by the Valparaiso Woman's Club. Dr Loring used his home as his medical office until his death in 1914. It was Loring's initial efforts that brought medical care to the county and provided for the first hospital. Although private, it became the county's first public hospital when Loring sold the building in 1906 to build his home and clinic. Loring was a physician and surgeon. He was vice president of the Indiana State Medical Association and founder of the Porter County Medical Society.Porter County Interim Report, Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory, Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana; July 1991, p. 51. ==History== Dr. Loring Movied to Valparaiso in 1882 after studying and practicing medice at Rush Medical College in Chicago, Bellevue Hospital in New York and in Cincinnati.

In 1905, he decided to build a new clinic west on Jefferson on the northeast corner with Washington Street. Dr Loring built his home in 1906 from the proceeds of the sale of his private hospital to the Valparaiso Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) for $13,000. His home was designed and built by local architect and builder Charles Lembke. When Dr Loring died in 1914, his Washington Street home and office was sold to Dr J. R. Pagin, who sold it to the Elks Club in 1924. The Elks own building had burned that year. The Elks decided within the year to rebuild on their own site. They resold the house the same year to the Woman's Club for $30,000. It was dedicated to Sarah Porter Kinsey on September 21, 1925. They paid off the mortgage and celebrated on December 1, 1939.Neeley, George E., City of Valparaiso, A Pictorial History, St Louis, Missouri: G. Bradley Publishing, Inc., 1989, p. 146.
