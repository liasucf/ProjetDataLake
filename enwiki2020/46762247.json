In a Spectacular Demonstration of Musical Daring and Brilliant New Stereo!!) is an album by drummer Shelly Manne and guitarist Jack Marshall recorded in early 1962 and released on the Contemporary label.Contemporary Records discography accessed May 21, 2015 The album was produced as a stereo test and demonstration record to be used by hi-fi enthusiasts to test the performance of their audio systems. The duo followed this with another release in 1966 on the Capitol label titled Sounds!. ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states \"On a dozen standards, Marshall's playing serves as interludes between the percussion displays of Manne; the liners give a full description of every device he hits. The music is fairly routine even if the sound is excellent for the period\". ==Track listing== # \"Poinciana\" (Nat Simon, Buddy Bernier) - 3:10 # \"My Funny Valentine\" (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) - 3:05 # \"The Continental\" (Con Conrad, Herb Magidson) - 3:26 # \"By Myself\" (Arthur Schwartz, Howard Dietz) - 2:19 # \"Stormy Weather\" (Harold Arlen, Ted Koehler) - 2:54 # \"Begin the Beguine\" (Cole Porter) - 3:35 # \"Night and Day\" (Porter) - 3:09 # \"Makin' Whoopee\" (Walter Donaldson, Gus Kahn) - 2:39 # \"The Piccolino\" (Irving Berlin) - 3:11 # \"I'll Remember April\" (Gene de Paul, Patricia Johnston, Don Raye) - 3:17 # \"The Boy Next Door\" (Hugh Martin, Ralph Blane) - 2:42 # \"Temptation\" (Nacio Herb Brown, Arthur Freed) - 3:12 ==Personnel== *Shelly Manne - percussion *Jack Marshall - classical guitar ==References== Category:Contemporary Records albums Category:Shelly Manne albums Category:1962 albums ",
