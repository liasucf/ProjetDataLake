    "text": "An ontbijtkoek (literally translated breakfast cake) or peperkoek (pepper cake) is a Dutch and Flemish spiced cake. Rye is its most important ingredient, coloring the cake light brown. It is often spiced with cloves, cinnamon, ginger, succade and nutmeg. Several parts of the Netherlands have their own local recipe, of which the most famous is oudewijvenkoek (old woman's cake) , which is mostly eaten in the northern regions, and is flavored with aniseed. Ontbijtkoek is traditionally served at breakfast with a thick layer of butter on top, as a replacement for bread, however, due to its sweet taste it is also served as a snack. It is best eaten the day after it is baked. Ontbijtkoek is also found in Indonesia due to its historical colonial ties with The Netherlands.Kuliner Peninggalan Belanda - Nggak Nyangka! 17 Makanan Favoritmu Ini Olahan Negeri Kincir Angin - Tribun Travel https://today.line.me/id/pc/article/17+Makanan+Peninggalan+Belanda+yang+Populer+di+Indonesia+hingga+Saat+Ini- gLLL8g ==See also== * Gingerbread * Coffee cake * Lekach ==References== Category:Cakes Category:Dutch cuisine Category:Dutch words and phrases Category:Indonesian breads ",
