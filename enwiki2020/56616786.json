    "text": "Alfred Harmsworth, Founder of the Sylvan Debating Club, by Seymour Lucas, R.A. The Sylvan Debating Club is a free speech society in which topical issues are discussed. Founded in London in 1868, it meets monthly and employs a traditional motion-based debating format.\"The Sylvan Debating Club. Mr. Maxse and the Sanctity of Confidence.\" The Times (London, England) 21 May 1913. Page 10. Retrieved 10 March 2018. == History == The Sylvan Debating Club was founded in 1868. More specifically, the inception of the club was discussed on top of one of the Green Atlas buses, which ran from the City of London through Baker Street and the Abbey Road to the Princess of Wales Hotel in St. John's Wood. A conversation took place between Alfred Harmsworth and one of the other founders and resulted in the first meeting being held on 6 January 1868. The club, particularly in its early years, included a number of prominent members. This was partly driven by the Harmsworth family, who owned several leading newspapers. Ultimately three of Alfred Harmsworth's sons were raised to the peerage, all of whom became members of the club. Their associates and those of the other founders ensured that the club enjoyed the presence of illustrious members of British society well into the early decades of the twentieth century. Operating in such a milieu meant that the activities of the Sylvans were reflected in major British newspaper reports at the time, particularly in coverage of the club's annual dinner, which was something of a set-piece event. In 1901, the Duke of Norfolk was the principal guest.\"Sylvan Debating Club.\" Morning Post (London, England) 24 May 1901. Page 3.

While it is ironically debatable whether such clubs had any impact whatsoever on the course of history, there are some statements recorded in the newspaper reports providing relevant indications. During his speech at the 1901 Sylvan dinner, His Grace the Duke of Norfolk commented, according to the London Evening Standard, that \"he thought that such clubs as the Sylvan Debating Club really did an important part in carrying on the public life of England, and the writing of the history of the great nation to which they belonged.\" The club continued its activities through both the first\"Sylvan Debating Club.\" The Times (London, England) 4 November 1920.

The customary schedule had been weekly debates October through to April, with breaks over Christmas and Easter, with a program of topics announced in advance via printed cards. Washington Edmonds Haycock as president of the Sylvan Debating club in 1902-1903 Membership in debating societies in London in general waxed and waned due to various factors, post an initial flourishing in the mid eighteenth century. By the mid twentieth century, few of these original clubs were still in existence.\"An Old London Debating Club.\" The Times (London, England) 17 June 1914. Page 35. Retrieved 10 March 2018. Those that were experienced a general decline in membership, in particular when major newspapers closed their Fleet Street offices. The Sylvans continued uninterrupted during this period, though membership declined to a low point in the early 2000s, which has since been reversed. == Current activities == The subject of the club's now monthly debates typically relates to key topical issues of public and political life. Recent subjects have included Brexit, the NHS, the UK and US elections, the role of women in government, the war in Syria and many others. The Sylvans debates are structured along the lines of the those held by the Oxford and Cambridge Unions and other debating societies. There is a chairman who introduces the speakers and controls the debate generally. The debate is focused on a particular motion. This is proposed by the Proposer and opposed by the Opposer, following which all present are invited to contribute if they so wish, which are called \"floor speeches\". Following rebuttals by the Proposer and the Opposer, the debate concludes with a vote, and the motion is thus declared to be either won or lost. Members and guests are invited to play a role in selecting the motions, and to put themselves forward for the position of Proposer or Opposer. == Notable members == * Alfred Harmsworth\"Death of Mr. A.
