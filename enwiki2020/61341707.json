Quote: As pivotal as that first 500 for CBS was, Squier considered Yarborough's win in 1983 to be just as important in furthering the sport's popularity. An innovation which director Bob Fishman helped develop - a miniature, remote-controlled in-car camera called RaceCam - was mounted inside Yarborough's car. The pictures gave the viewing audience a better portrayal of the drivers as what Squier called \"real people taking real risks\" instead of the perception of a bunch of good ol' boys simply making one left-hand turn after another. \"You got a sense of the control it took and the judgment those people had to have to survive,\" he said. \"And it changed the American perspective.\" Quote: \"Then in 1983, we introduced the in-car camera. We put the average race fan in the driver's seat. They got a sense for speed, a sense of how close the traffic was. Until 1983, cars didn't look that fast on a 19-inch television screen. All of a sudden you're behind the wheel and you learned these cars drive like a sailboat going 200 mph. You got a sense of what it's like to be a driver. It was reality and fantasy television all in one.\" Fishman Quote: Fishman has directed every 500 telecast except for the three years (1992, 1994 and 1998) when he was at the Winter Olympics directing CBS' figure-skating coverage. Fishman and producer Bob Stenner were almost inseparable at the Speedway until Stenner left for Fox in 1994 after Pat Summerall and John Madden insisted that he continue being part of the NFL games which they called. directed every Daytona 500 telecast on CBS, with the exception of 1992, 1994 and 1998 because Fishman was away directing CBS' figure-skating coverage for the Winter Olympics. *TBS broadcast the Richmond spring race, held the week after Daytona Speedweeks, from 1983 to 1995, as well as the fall races at Rockingham (1985-1987), Atlanta (1983-1985) and Riverside (1982-1987). *TNN started showing races live in 1991,TNN decided to get into the game in 1991 and that pretty much guaranteed that each weekend's NASCAR race would be shown somewhere on television, whether it was CBS, ABC, WTBS, ESPN or TNN. but it had aired taped coverage of a few Winston Cup races in the 1980s on its American Sports Cavalcade program. ===1984=== {| class=wikitable |- |Date |Event |Network |Lap-by-lap |Color commentator(s) |- |2/12 |Busch Clash (Daytona) |CBS |Ken Squier |Ned Jarrett |- |2/16 |UNO Twin 125's (Daytona) |USA |Ken Squier |David Hobbs |- |2/19 |Daytona 500 |CBS |Ken Squier |David Hobbs and Ned Jarrett |- |2/26 |Richmond 400 (Richmond) |TBS |Ken Squier | |- |3/4 |Carolina 500 (Rockingham) |SETN |Mike Joy |Benny Parsons |- |3/18 |Coca- Cola 500 (Atlanta) |ABC | | |- |4/15 |TransSouth 500 (Darlington) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Larry Nuber |- |5/12 |Coors 420 (Nashville) |TBS |Ken Squier |Benny Parsons |- |5/20 |Budweiser 500 (Dover) |Mizlou |Mike Joy |Phil Parsons |- |6/10 |Van Scoy 500 (Pocono) |Mizlou/ESPN |Mike Joy |Donnie Allison |- |7/4 |Firecracker 400 (Daytona) |ABC |Jim Lampley |Sam Posey |- |7/22 |Like Cola 500 (Pocono) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Larry Nuber |- |7/29 |Talladega 500 (Talladega) |CBS |Ken Squier |Ned Jarrett and Benny Parsons |- |9/2 |Southern 500 (Darlington) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Jack Arute |- |10/21 |American 500 (Rockingham) |SETN |Mike Joy |Benny Parsons |- |11/11 |Atlanta Journal 500 (Atlanta) |TBS |Ken Squier |Glenn Jarrett |- |11/18 |Winston Western 500 (Riverside) |TBS |Ken Squier |Phil Parsons |} *Special Events Television Network (SETN) is the name of a defunct syndicated television package that broadcast tape delayed NASCAR races from 1984 to 1988. SETN aired races (typically from Martinsville and Pocono as well as from Rockingham, Charlotte, Richmond and Daytona for good measure) that didn't have live television deals at the time. The broadcasts were aired on tape delay because certain promoters still feared that live telecasts would hurt their gate. ===1985=== {| class=wikitable |- |Date |Event |Network |Lap-by-lap |Color

Pocono race a year was produced by Jim Wiglesworth on pay-per-view for Viewer's Choice (now In Demand) from 1988 to 1990. They were not a huge success, as fans were reluctant to pay for what they could see last week for free. The Viewer's Choice shows were noteworthy in that they premiered viewer phone-in questions during the races. ===1989=== {| class=wikitable |- |Date |Event |Network |Lap-by-lap |Color commentator(s) |- |2/12 |Busch Clash (Daytona) |CBS |Ken Squier |Ned Jarrett and Chris Economaki |- |2/16 |Twin 125's (Daytona) |CBS (tape delayed to 2/18) |Ken Squier |Ned Jarrett and Chris Economaki |- |2/19 |Daytona 500 |CBS |Ken Squier |Ned Jarrett and Chris Economaki |- |4/16 |First Union 400 (North Wilkesboro) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Ned Jarrett and Gary Nelson |- |5/7 |Winston 500 (Talladega) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Ned Jarrett and Benny Parsons |- |5/21 |The Winston (Charlotte) |ABC |Paul Page |Benny Parsons and Bobby Unser |- |5/28 |Coca-Cola 600 (Charlotte) |TBS |Ken Squier |Johnny Hayes |- |6/4 |Budweiser 500(Dover) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Ned Jarrett and Benny Parsons |- |6/11 |Banquet Frozen Foods 300 (Sears Point) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Ned Jarrett and Benny Parsons |- |6/18 |Miller High Life 500 (Pocono) |PPV |Dave Despain |Lyn St. James and Gary Nelson |- |7/1 |Pepsi 400 (Daytona) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Ned Jarrett and Benny Parsons |- |7/23 |AC Spark Plug 500 (Pocono) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Ned Jarrett and Benny Parsons |- |7/30 |DieHard 500 (Talladega) |CBS |Ken Squier |Ned Jarrett and Chris Economaki |- |8/13 |Bud at the Glen (Watkins Glen) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Ned Jarrett and Benny Parsons |- |9/10 |Miller High Life 400 (Richmond) |TBS |Ken Squier |Johnny Hayes and Phil Parsons |- |9/17 |Peak Performance 500 (Dover) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Ned Jarrett and Benny Parsons |- |9/24 |Goody's 500 (Martinsville) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Ned Jarrett and Benny Parsons |- |10/8 |All Pro Auto Parts 500 (Charlotte) |TBS |Ken Squier |Johnny Hayes and Joe Ruttman |- |10/15 |Tyson Holly Farms 400 (North Wilkesboro) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Ned Jarrett and Benny Parsons |- |11/5 |Autoworks 500 (Phoenix) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Ned Jarrett and Benny Parsons |- |11/19 |Atlanta Journal 500 (Atlanta) |ESPN |Bob Jenkins |Ned Jarrett and Benny Parsons |} ==References== ==See also== *List of Daytona 500 broadcasters *List of Wide World of Sports (American TV series) announcers *List of events broadcast on Wide World of Sports (American TV series) *NASCAR on television in the 1960s **NASCAR on television in the 1970s **NASCAR on television in the 1990s **NASCAR on television in the 2000s **NASCAR on television in the 2010s Category:ABC Sports Category:CBS Sports Category:NBC Sports Category:Wide World of Sports (American TV series) Category:CBS Sports Spectacular Category:Sportsworld (American TV series) Category:ESPN Category:Turner Sports Category:Mizlou Television Network 1980s Category:Showtime (TV network) Category:USA Network Sports Category:1980s in American television ",
