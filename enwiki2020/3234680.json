    "text": "A buy\u2013sell agreement, also known as a buyout agreement, is a legally binding agreement between co-owners of a business that governs the situation if a co- owner dies or is otherwise forced to leave the business, or chooses to leave the business.de Frutos, M.-A. and Kittsteiner, T. (2008), Efficient partnership dissolution under buy-sell clauses. The RAND Journal of Economics, 39: 184\u2013198. It may be thought of as a sort of premarital agreement between business partners/shareholders or is sometimes called a \"business will\". An insured buy\u2013sell agreement (triggered buyout is funded with life insurance on the participating owners' lives) is often recommended by business-succession specialists and financial planners to ensure that the buy\u2013sell arrangement is well-funded and to guarantee that there will be money when the buy\u2013sell event is triggered. ==Clauses== A buy\u2013sell agreement consists of several legally binding clauses in a business partnership or operating agreement or a separate, freestanding agreement, and controls the following business decisions: *Who can buy a departing partner's or shareholder's share of the business (this may include outsiders or be limited to other partners/shareholders); *What events will trigger a buyout, (the most common events that trigger a buyout are: death, disability, retirement, or an owner leaving the company) and; *What price will be paid for a partner's or shareholder's interest in the partnership and so on. Buy\u2013sell agreement can be in the form of a cross-purchase plan or a repurchase (entity or stock- redemption) plan. For greater neutrality and effectiveness of the buy\u2013sell arrangement, the service of a corporate trustee is recommended. ==References== Category:Mergers and acquisitions ",
