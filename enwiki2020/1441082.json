After several years of submitting work which showed \"a remarkable gift for the composition of light verse,\" he was invited to join the staff in 1897, becoming assistant editor in 1902 and finally editor in 1906. It was during his tenure there that A. A. Milne, author of the Winnie-the-Pooh stories, worked as his assistant; it is thought that Seaman's dour disposition may have been the inspiration behind the gloomy character of Eeyore.

Munro put it. qtd. in In 1915, he published War Time, a book of poetry that Munro described as \"a mixture of satiric verse and patriotic doggerel.\" Nevertheless, in 1933, he was created a baronet, of Bouverie Street in the City of London.
