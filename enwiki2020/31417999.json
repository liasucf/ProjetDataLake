    "text": "Bank of Buffalo Henry's Crime is a 2010 American romantic comedy film directed by Malcolm Venville and starring Keanu Reeves, Vera Farmiga, and James Caan. The film follows Henry (Reeves), who goes to jail for a bank robbery he did not commit. Once released, he plans to rob the same bank with his former cellmate Max (Caan). The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 14, 2010, and was given a limited release in the United States on April 8, 2011. ==Plot== Working the night shift as a toll collector on a lonely stretch of highway in Buffalo, New York, Henry is a man seemingly without ambition, dreams or purpose; a man sleepwalking his way through life. His wife Debbie is not happy with the situation. One morning Eddie, a friend, drops by to ask Henry to play in a baseball game, as one of the others is ill, and Henry agrees to. As they drive to the game in Henry's car, Eddie asks Henry to stop at an ATM. But Eddie, and two acquaintances also in the car, instead rob the Buffalo Savings Bank, and Henry is arrested as an accomplice. Rather than give up the names of the real culprits, Henry takes the fall and goes to jail. There he is celled with the irrepressible Max, a con man who has grown far too comfortable with the familiarity and security of his \"idyllic\" life behind bars, but one who also helps plant an idea in Henry's mind which will change his life forever: for a man to find his purpose, he must first have a dream. Debbie decides to divorce him, and she marries Joe, one of the acquaintances. Upon his release eighteen months later, Henry finds his purpose. Having done the time, he decides he may as well do the crime. Discovering a long forgotten bootlegger's tunnel which runs from the very same bank to a theater across the alleyway, he convinces the reluctant Max to file for his long overdue parole \u2013 to help stage a robbery of the bank. Max encourages Henry to become an actor in the theater's current production of Anton Chekhov's 1904 play The Cherry Orchard, to assist Max, \"volunteering\" to work in the theater, in getting access to the tunnel. Meanwhile, Henry finds himself falling for the production's mercurial leading lady, Julie. Debbie's husband Joe is recruited to help clearing the tunnel of mud; he informs Eddie, who insists in participating too. Frank, a guard at the bank forced into retirement, helps by informing the robbers when there is a lot of money in the vault. During the actual robbery, Eddie uses a gun to try to take all the money himself, but is overpowered by Max and is left behind in the vault. As the three make their escape, Henry demands Joe stop the car. Henry wishes Max well, and he then returns to Julie. ==Cast== * Keanu Reeves as Henry Torne * James Caan as Max Saltzman * Vera Farmiga as Julie Ivanova * Judy Greer as Debbie Torne * Fisher Stevens as Eddie Vibes * Peter Stormare as Darek Millodragovic * Bill Duke as Frank * Danny Hoch as Joe * Currie Graham as Simon * David Costabile as Arnold ==Production== ===Development=== Malcolm Venville directed the film from a screenplay written by Sacha Gervasi and David N.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"Supporting actors Vera Farmiga and James Caan give the movie a little heft, but Henry's Crime is an otherwise predictable heist/comedy with slow pacing.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 49 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C grade, and wrote, \"This picaresque caper might do well as a novel, but as a movie \u2013 assembled with no consistent sense of moviemaking, each performer left to his or her own actorly whims \u2013 it's a grab bag of comic clich\u00e9s about bank robberies and regional theater.\" Film critic Roger Ebert wrote, \"Reeves has many arrows in his quiver, but screwball comedy isn't one of them. Vera Farmiga, James Caan and Fisher Stevens can do it, but they often seem to be looking back, waiting for Reeves to pass the baton. What's needed is someone nervous to play Henry. A Steve Buscemi for example. Reeves maintains a sort of Zen detachment. Whatever happens is all right with him.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:2010 films Category:2010s crime comedy- drama films Category:American films Category:American crime comedy-drama films Category:American heist films Category:American independent films Category:Films about bank robbery Category:Films set in New York (state) Category:Films shot in Buffalo, New York Category:Films shot in New York City Category:2010 independent films ",
