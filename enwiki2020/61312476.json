The religious came to Brazil especially to participate in the Festival Halleluya in a show held for the first time in the Americas. Wilde F\u00e1bio, writer and director of the proposal, explained that \"The new music video of MSH with Sister Cristina is a very joyful, happy and intense song that passes the image of a young and living Church, as is the heart of Jesus who loves each and intense as is the heart of the young man who thirsts for the love of God\"\u201d. The song \"Eis-me Aqui\", launched in August 2018, is a preparation for the World Youth Day 2019, to be held in Panama.
