    "text": "Mount Clemenceau is the fourth highest mountain in the Canadian Rockies. The peak was originally named \"Pyramid\" in 1892 by Arthur Coleman. The mountain was renamed by the Interprovincial Boundary Survey in 1919 to its present name, which is for Georges Clemenceau, premier of France during World War I. Mt. Clemenceau was first climbed in 1923 by D.B. Durand, H.S. Hall, W.D. Harris and H.B. De V. Schwab. __NOTOC__ == Routes == There are three standard climbing routes: *West Face II **This is the normal route, similar to the north glacier route (normal) on Mount Athabasca but considered more interesting. The route avoids the steepest parts of the face. *North-East Ridge IV *North Face IV ==See also== *List of mountains in the Canadian Rockies *Mountain peaks of Canada *Mountain peaks of North America *Mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains *Rocky Mountains == References == ==External links== * Mount Clemenceau aerial photo: PBase Category:Canadian Rockies Category:Mountains of British Columbia ",
