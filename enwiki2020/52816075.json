    "text": "Lucy Vinis (born 1952/53) is an American politician. She was elected mayor of Eugene, Oregon, in 2016, and started her term in January 2017. ==Education== Vinis is a graduate of Kenyon College in Ohio and earned master's degrees from the University of Maryland and the University of Michigan. ==Career== Her position as mayor of Eugene is her first time in public office. She is a member of the Democratic Party and has described her position on the political spectrum as \"progressive liberal\". During the May 2020 George Floyd protests in Eugene, the city's police under Vinis' command shot and injured a reporter from the Eugene Weekly who was documenting the demonstrations, who in turn filed a lawsuit against the city. Subsequently, six protestors also sued the City and the Eugene Police Department for gassing, shooting and arresting them in a way that allegedly violated their civil rights. On July 27, 2020, after the Eugene City Council deadlocked at 4-4 on a vote to refer a measure allowing STAR voting to be used in city elections to the November 2020 ballot, Vinis cast the deciding vote against the referral. ==Personal life== Vinis has lived in Eugene since 1991. She has worked for non-profit organizations in Eugene, including EarthShare of Oregon, Northwest Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides, and ShelterCare. == Electoral history == {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"4\" |Eugene, Oregon Mayor Primary Election, May 17, 2016 |- |Party |Candidate |Votes |% |- |Non-Partisan |Lucy Vinis |28,010 |52.51 |- |Non- Partisan |Mike Clark |19,976 |37.45 |- |Non-Partisan |Bob Cassidy |2,283 |4.28 |- |Non-Partisan |Scott Landfield |1,762 |3.30 |- |Non-Partisan |Stefan G.
