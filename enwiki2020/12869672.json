    "text": "Women in Technology is the second album by British recording artist White Town. It was released on 25 February 1997 and is the second full studio album by White Town. The album is most known for the song \"Your Woman\" which was its only top 40 single. The song received much acclaim and reached #1 in the UK Singles Chart. A second single, released as a promo, was made of \"Wanted\" and failed to chart anywhere. The album's third single \"Undressed\" reached 57. The album was recorded entirely at Jyoti Mishra's home studio. ==Background== In early 1997, Jyoti Mishra mailed out five copies of his extended play >Abort, Retry, Fail? to various radio stations. This caused the EPs lead track \"Your Woman\" to receive heavy rotation on stations, resulting in Mishra getting a deal with EMI. Through Chrysalis Records, a label owned by EMI, Mishra released the second White Town full-length Women In Technology, which produced three singles: the widely successful \"Your Woman\", the promo-only \"Wanted\", and \"Undressed\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Jyoti Mishra \u2013 production, vocals *Ann Pearson \u2013 vocals (\"Thursday at the Blue Note\", \"Wanted\", and \"Once I Flew\") *Robert Fleay \u2013 guitar (\"Undressed\", \"A Week Next June\", Going Nowhere Somehow\", and \"Once I Flew\") == References == Category:1997 albums Category:White Town albums Category:Electronica albums by British artists ",
