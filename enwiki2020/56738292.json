Featuring sixty-four teams, it began on March 9, and concluded with the championship game on March 24. The eight regional winners met in the Elite Eight for the quarterfinal, semifinal, and championship rounds. For the second consecutive year, the Elite Eight was held at the Sanford Pentagon in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. ==Qualification== A total of 64 bids are available for each tournament: 24 automatic bids (awarded to the champions of the twenty-two Division II conferences) and 40 at-large bids. The sixty-four bids are allocated evenly among the eight NCAA-designated regions (Atlantic, Central, East, Midwest, South, South Central, Southeast, and West), each of which contains three of the twenty-four Division II conferences that sponsor men's basketball. Each region consists of three automatic qualifiers (the teams who won their respective conference tournaments) and five at-large bids (which are awarded regardless of conference affiliation). Five teams qualified for their first NCAA Division II tournament in 2018: Ohio Dominican, Point Loma Nazarene, Saint Martin's, Southern Nazarene, and West Florida. ==Regionals== ===Atlantic \u2013 Petersburg, Virginia=== Location: VSU Multi-Purpose Center ===Central \u2013 Maryville, Missouri=== Location: Bearcat Arena ===East \u2013 Syracuse, New York=== Location: Le Moyne Athletic Center ===Midwest \u2013 Big Rapids, Michigan=== Location: Jim Wink Arena ===South \u2013 Atlanta, Georgia=== Location: Forbes Arena * \u2013 Denotes overtime period ===Southeast \u2013 Harrogate, Tennessee=== Location: B.
