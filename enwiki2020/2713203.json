    "text": "Pi1 Ursae Majoris (Pi1 UMa, \u03c0\u00b9 Ursae Majoris, \u03c0\u00b9 UMa) is a yellow G-type main sequence dwarf with a mean apparent magnitude of +5.63. It is approximately 46.8 light years from Earth, and is a relatively young star with an age of about 200 million years. It is classified as a BY Draconis type variable star and its brightness varies by 0.08 magnitudes. In 1986, it became the first solar-type star to have the emission from an X-ray flare observed. Based upon its space velocity components, this star is a member of the Ursa Major moving group of stars that share a common motion through space. An excess of infrared radiation has been detected from this system, which suggests the presence of a debris disk. The best fit to the data indicates that there is a ring of fine debris out to a radius of about 0.4 AU, consisting of 0.25 \u03bcm grains of amorphous silicates or crystalline forsterite. There may also be a wider ring of larger (10 \u03bcm) grains out to a distance of 16 AU. ==Naming and etymology== With \u03c02, \u03c31, \u03c32, \u03c1, A and d, it composed the Arabic asterism Al \u1e6chib\u0101\u1fbd, the Gazelle. According to the catalogue of stars in the Technical Memorandum 33-507 - A Reduced Star Catalog Containing 537 Named Stars, Al \u1e6chib\u0101 were the title for seven stars : A as Althiba I, this star (\u03c01) as Althiba II, \u03c02 as Althiba III, \u03c1 as Althiba IV, \u03c31 as Althiba V, \u03c32 as Althiba VI, and d as Althiba VII. ==References== ==External links== * TPF-C data for Hip 42438 * Individual results for HD 72905 Ursae Majoris, Pi Ursae Majoris, 03 072905 Category:G-type main-sequence stars Ursae Majoris, 03 Category:BY Draconis variables Althiba II Category:Circumstellar disks Category:Ursa Major (constellation) 042438 3391 Category:Durchmusterung objects ",
