    "text": "Decriminalization or decriminalisation is the lessening of criminal penalties in relation to certain acts, perhaps retroactively, though perhaps regulated permits or fines might still apply (for contrast, see: legalization). The term was coined by anthropologist Jenifer James to express sex workers' movements' \"goals of removing laws used to target prostitutes\".M. G. Grant, Playing the Whore (Verso/Jacobin, 2014), p. 112 The reverse process is criminalization. Decriminalization reflects changing social and moral views. A society may come to the view that an act is not harmful, should no longer be criminalized, or is otherwise not a matter to be addressed by the criminal justice system. Examples of subject matter which have been the subject of changing views on criminality over time in various societies and countries include: *abortion *breastfeeding in public *drug possession, and recreational drug use *euthanasia *gambling *homosexuality *polygamy *prostitution *public nudity *steroid use in sport In a federal country, acts may be decriminalized by one level of government while still subject to penalties levied by another; for example, possession of a decriminalized drug may still be subject to criminal charges by one level of government, but another may yet impose a monetary fine. This should be contrasted with legalization, which removes all or most legal detriments from a previously illegal act. It has also been noted that while some acts have been decriminalised, such as homosexuality and adultery, others have increased in their criminalization, such as familial sexual activities, or incest. ==Drug-use decriminalization topics== *Decriminalization of non-medicinal marijuana in the United States *Legal history of cannabis in the United States *Cannabis legalization in Canada *Colorado Amendment 64 *Marijuana Policy Project *Psilocybin decriminalization in the United States *Law Enforcement Against Prohibition *Legality of cannabis *Timeline of cannabis law *Responsible drug use *War on Drugs ==See also== *Drug liberalization *Drug policy of the Soviet Union *Legal issues of anabolic steroids *Legalization *Liberalization *Alcohol prohibition *Prostitution in Canada *Prostitution in Rhode Island *Public-order crime *Sex worker *Sodomy law *Timeline of LGBT history *Unenforced law *Victimless crime ==References== Category:Classical liberalism Category:Criminal law legal terminology Category:Drug policy reform ",
