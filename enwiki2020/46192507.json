    "text": "Angola competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. This was the nation's ninth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics, with the exception of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, because of its participation in the Soviet boycott. The Angolan Olympic Committee () selected a total of 25 athletes, 8 men and 17 women, for the Games, competing in seven different sports. The nation's team size was roughly ten athletes smaller than the team sent to London four years earlier, and had the second largest share of women in its Summer Olympic history. Women's handball was the only team-based sport in which Angola had its representation at these Games, unable to send any of the nation's basketball teams to the Olympics for the first time since 1988. Among the sports played by the athletes, Angola marked its debut in rowing and a return in sailing and shooting from a two-decade absence. Notable Angolan athletes featured three- time judoka Ant\u00f3nia Moreira, medley swimmer Pedro Pinotes, trap shooter Jo\u00e3o Paulo da Silva, who sought for his Olympic comeback in Rio after a 16-year absence, and four-time Olympian and handball team captain Lu\u00edsa Kiala, who became the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Angola, however, has yet to win its first ever Olympic medal. ==Athletics== Angola has received universality slots from IAAF to send two athletes (one male and one female) to the Olympics. ;Key * Note \u2013 Ranks given for track events are within the athlete's heat only * Q = Qualified for the next round * q = Qualified for the next round as a fastest loser or, in field events, by position without achieving the qualifying target * NR = National record * N/A = Round not applicable for the event * Bye = Athlete not required to compete in round ;Track & road events {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Quarterfinal !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Hermenegildo Leite |align=left|Men's 100 m |11.65 |7 |colspan=6|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|Liliana Neto |align=left|Women's 100 m |13.58 |7 |colspan=6|Did not advance |} ==Handball== ;Summary Key: * ET \u2013 After extra time * P \u2013 Match decided by penalty-shootout. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|Event !colspan=6|Group Stage !Quarterfinal !Semifinal !colspan=2|Final / |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Rank !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Opposition Score !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Angola women's |align=left|Women's tournament | W 23\u201319 | W 27\u201325 | L 20\u201330 | L 24\u201328 | L 22\u201326 |4 | L 27\u201331 |colspan=2|Did not advance |8 |} ===Women's tournament=== Angola women's handball team qualified for the Olympics by winning the 2015 Africa Qualification Tournament in Luanda.
