    "text": "Salonius was a confessor and bishop of the 5th century. He was born about 400, a son of Eucherius of Lyon and Galla. He was educated at L\u00e9rins Abbey, first by Hilary of Arles, then by Salvianus and Vincent of L\u00e9rins. In 440, he was elected bishop of Geneva and, as such, took part in the Synod of Orange (441), the Synod of Vaison (442), and the Synod of Arles (451). He has also been listed as the bishop of Genoa, but it is not clear if this was a later appointment or if the word Geneva was miswritten as Genova. He was an accomplished Latin ecclesiastical writer. Most notably, he composed mystical and allegorical interpretations of the Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. His feast day is 28 September. ==References== * Holweck, F.
