In 1826, the city of Nice, encouraged by King Charles F\u00e9lix, bought it from its owners and had it demolished and rebuilt. It was inaugurated in 1828 with Giovanni Pacini's Il Barone di Bolsheim. In 1856, a great ball was organized in the honour of King Victor Emmanuel II. In 1860, Napoleon III was invited to attend an evening at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royal. For this special occasion, Johann Strauss led the orchestra. The same year, the theatre became the \u201cTh\u00e9\u00e2tre Imp\u00e9rial\u201d. In 1864, Napoleon III returned, accompanied by Tsar Alexander II of Russia. In 1868, Louis II, Duke of Bavaria attended a performance of Cendrillon. The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royal was renamed \u201cTh\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal\u201d in 1870. On Wednesday, March 23rd 1881, as the opera Lucia di Lammermoor began, a gas leak started a huge fire. The fire was controlled the next day but there was nothing left of the theatre. Three siblings of Marjory Kennedy-Fraser died in the fire: Lizzie, Kate and James (soprano, contralto and baritone respectively). The city of Nice immediately decided to rebuild another theatre on the same site. It was designed by architect Fran\u00e7ois Aune with the apparent approval of Charles Garnier, the architect of the Paris Opera. On February 7th 1885, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Municipal re-opened with Verdi\u2019s Aida.Alexandre. Ivan A. Nice pour m\u00e9moire. Diapason 649, September 2016, p9.

With the support of the M\u00e9decin family of Nice, the house flourished, attracting major singers and directors in opera, but despite the efforts of Jean-Albert Cartier from 1994\u20131997, the importance of the house declined. ==21st century== From 2001 to 2009 the director-general was the Belgian producer Paul-\u00c9mile Fourny. He was succeeded by Jacques H\u00e9douin, with a policy of closer working with the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, as well as closer collaboration with the two regional orchestras, the Orchestre philharmonique de Nice and the Orchestre r\u00e9gional de Cannes-Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur.Fauchet B.
