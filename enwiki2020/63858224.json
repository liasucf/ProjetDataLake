    "text": "Mabel Frenyear (August 25, 1880 \u2013 died after 1921) was an actress and chorus girl on stage and in three silent films. == Career == Frenyear appeared in three silent films, A Fool There Was (1915), a Theda Bara vehicle, Tit for Tat (1915), a comedy, and Social Quicksands (1918), written by Katharine Kavanaugh. On her first trip to make films in Los Angeles in 1914, she made headlines for criticizing local women's fashion. \"Southern California is a wonderland to me, but the women in Los Angeles; oh, they dress so terribly,\" she declared. On Broadway, Frenyear's roles included parts in The Girl in the Barracks (1899), The Stronger Sex (1908-1909), The Only Law (1909), Where There's a Will (1910), You Can Never Tell (1915), The Importance of Being Earnest (1921, as Miss Prism), and Montmartre (1922). She also appeared in productions of The Wizard of Oz, Babes in Toyland, Father and the Boys (1910), The 'Mind-the-Paint' Girl (1912), Nothing But the Truth (1916), and Kissing Time (1921). Frenyear took chorus roles to prepare for her role as a chorus girl in The Only Law. A Minnesota reviewer in 1921 noted that Frenyear was \"really pretty and plays her part with spirit.\" Her stage work was not always so admired; \"If Miss Frenyear would not shriek her lines unintelligibly,\" commented one reviewer in 1915, \"the worst defect of the production would be removed.\" == Personal life == Frenyear married twice. In 1900 she married Edward F. Dunn. She only lived with Dunn for eight weeks, when he sold all her jewelry and gambled the proceeds; they divorced in 1904. By the end of 1904 she remarried, to Thomas R. Finucane; that marriage was almost immediately annulled, because both parties admitted they were \"married while intoxicated\". In 1911 she was rumored to have married her co-star, Ralph Kellard, but both \"laughed at the mere idea\". == References == == External links == * * *Mabel Frenyear at Playbill *Three photographs of Mabel Frenyear, in the Billy Rose Theatre Collection Photograph File at the New York Public Library Digital Collections. *A Fool There Was (1915), silent film featuring Mabel Frenyear, on Internet Archive.
