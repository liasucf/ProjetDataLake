This is the main obstacle to frame Milei as an 'Austrian' economist. Although his conceptual framework is decidedly Austrian, his methodology is overall not.Milei disertar\u00e1 en Met\u00e1n sobre capitalismo y monopolios, NOVA Salta, Retrieved 21 December 2018 Keynesian economist Andr\u00e9s Asiain, writing for P\u00e1gina 12, rejected Milei's characterization of the excess of fiat currency issuing as \"counterfeiting money\".
