    "text": "Sanditon is a British historical drama television series adapted by Andrew Davies from an unfinished manuscript by Jane Austen and starring Rose Williams and Theo James in the lead roles. Set during the Regency era, the plot follows a young and naive heroine as she navigates the new seaside resort of Sanditon. The series first aired on ITV in the United Kingdom on 25 August 2019 in eight parts, and on PBS in the United States on 12 January 2020, which supports the production, as part of its Masterpiece anthology. Due to the unfinished nature of the novel (Austen completed only eleven chapters), the original work is used for the majority of the first episode, and then Davies used the developed characters to complete the story. The novel is set in a seaside town during a time of social change. At the time of her death in 1817, Austen had completed 24,000 words of the novel. ==Overview== A chance accident brings Charlotte Heywood to Sanditon, a seaside resort on the cusp of dramatic change. Spirited and unconventional, Charlotte is initially keen to experience everything the town has to offer but is then shocked by its scheming and ambitious inhabitants and intrigued by the secrets they share. When Charlotte is tactlessly forthright about the family of enthusiastic entrepreneur Tom Parker, she immediately clashes with his handsome but wild younger brother Sidney. Amidst the rival suitors and unexpected danger, can Charlotte and Sidney see past each other's flaws and find love? ==Cast== ===Main=== * Rose Williams as Charlotte Heywood * Theo James as Sidney Parker * Kate Ashfield as Mary Parker * Crystal Clarke as Georgiana Lambe * Turlough Convery as Arthur Parker * Jack Fox as Sir Edward Denham * Kris Marshall as Tom Parker * Matthew Needham as Mr. Crowe * Anne Reid as Lady Denham * Alexandra Roach as Diana Parker * Lily Sacofsky as Clara Brereton * Charlotte Spencer as Esther Denham * Mark Stanley as Lord Babington * Leo Suter as James Stringer ===Recurring cast=== * James Atherton as Fred Robinson * Elizabeth Berrington as Mrs. Griffiths * Jack Brady as Mr. Howard * Kevin Eldon as Mr. Hankins * Mollie Holder as Phillida Beaufort * Rob Jarvis as Isaac Stringer * Jyuddah Jaymes as Otis Molyneux * Ruth Kearney as Eliza Campion * Kayleigh-Paige Rees as Julia Beaufort * Adrian Scarborough as Dr. Fuchs * Sophie Winkleman as Lady Susan * Isobel Hawkridge, Molly Bishop, Isaac Vincent-Norgate as the Parker children: Alicia, Jenny & Henry ===Guest cast=== * Sarah Belcher as Mrs. Heywood * Clinton Blake as Sam Sidaway * Liz May Brice as Mrs. Harries * Jon Foster as Beecroft * Adrian Rawlins as Mr. Heywood * Tessa Stephens as Alison Heywood ==Episodes== ==Production== Many of the Sanditon scenes were filmed in Somerset including the seaside towns of Clevedon, Brean and Weston-super-Mare. Dyrham Park near Bath, Somerset was used as the location for Sanditon House. The majority of interior filming took place on interior and exterior sets built at The Bottle Yard Studios in Bristol. ==Critical reception== Critical reception has been mixed. Some UK media outlets reported that viewers were shocked at the depictions of sex and nudity in the opening episode, considering it to be untrue to the works of Jane Austen. Many viewers critiqued the ending as unusual and very \u201cun-Austen-like\u201d. Viewers claim Austen would have liked a happy ending for all characters, as she has happy endings in all of her stories; however, this could have been a set up for a second season. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2010s British drama television series Category:2019 British television series debuts Category:2019 British television series endings Category:2010s British television miniseries Category:ITV television dramas Category:Period television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows set in Somerset Category:Television shows based on works by Jane Austen ",
