    "text": "Biospeedotrema jolliveti is a species of trematodes inhabiting hydrothermal vent fishes (particularly Ventichthys biospeedoi) in the south eastern Pacific Ocean. It can be distinguished from its family by its symmetrical testicular configuration; its uterus passing between the testes. Furthermore, it can be differentiated by vitelline fields which extend slightly into its post- testicular region; its intestinal bifurcation is dorsal to its ventral sucker; its genital pore is somewhat submedian or median; its cirrus sac is short and the caeca are large and overlap the testes. ==References== ==Further reading== *Bray, Rodney A., et al. \"The molecular phylogeny of the digenean family Opecoelidae Ozaki, 1925 and the value of morphological characters, with the erection of a new subfamily.\" Folia parasitologica 63 (2016): 013. *Shedko, M.
