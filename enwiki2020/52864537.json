    "text": "The Wife is a 2017 drama film directed by Bj\u00f6rn L. Runge and written by Jane Anderson, based on the novel of the same name by Meg Wolitzer. It stars Glenn Close, Jonathan Pryce, and Christian Slater, and follows a woman who questions her life choices as she travels to Stockholm with her husband, who is set to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. The film premiered on September 12, 2017, at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, and was released in the United States on August 17, 2018, by Sony Pictures Classics. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with Close's performance garnering high praise. She won the Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Independent Spirit Award and Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress for her performance, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress. ==Plot== In 1958, young Joan Archer, a college student at Smith College, is awed by her professor Joseph Castleman, a handsome, young, married man, and his force of personality and advice that \"a writer must write\"; she is attracted to him. Later, Joan meets a published alumna female author whose cynical view of opportunities available to female writers disheartens her; but importantly, the woman tells her \"a writer must be read.\" Two years later, Joseph has been fired for having an affair with Joan, his marriage is failing, and his first attempt at writing a novel turns out very poorly. Joan, a secretary at a publishing house, observes how the all-male editors dismiss women writers. When Joan criticizes Joseph's work, he threatens to end his relationship with her, claiming she cannot love \"a hack.\" Joan agrees to fix Joseph's novel for him. The work, titled The Walnut, is published and becomes a bestseller. By 1968, Joseph and Joan are married and living in a large seaside home in Connecticut. Joan is hard at work on a novel, to be published under Joseph's name, while Joseph supports her by cooking, cleaning, and caring for their first child, David. As Joseph and Joan converse, it is apparent that Joan's novel is a reflection of their life together, which bores Joan. A narcissist, Joseph has several adulterous affairs over the next four decades, and tells everyone that Joan \"does not write.\" By 1992, an elderly Joseph has become a celebrated author. He wins the Nobel Prize in Literature, about which Joan is less than happy. David, who idolizes his father but is unaware that Joan has written all of Joseph's books, seeks his critique of his first short story. The three of them fly to Stockholm as Nathaniel Bone, a biographer with a taste for scandal, tries to ingratiate himself with the Castlemans. Joan's unhappiness worsens as adulation is heaped on Joseph. His attempts to publicly thank her for supporting him only embitter her further. Nathaniel, sensing Joan's emotional state, induces her to talk with him over drinks and says that he knows that Joan has ghostwritten a major portion or even all of each of Joseph's novels. Joan does not admit the truth, but Nathaniel is convinced by their conversation that he is correct. Meanwhile, Joseph begins to seduce a young photographer who is assigned to him, but just as he is beginning his seduction his watch alarms goes off for him to take his heart pills, cooling the moment and she leaves the room. Joseph accuses Joan of abandoning him, while Joan expresses her outrage over his attempted affair. The argument ceases when they learn that their daughter Susannah has given birth. On the night of the Nobel ceremony, David confronts his parents after being told by Nathaniel that Joan is the only writer in the family. Joseph and Joan deny everything. At the ceremony and the banquet which follows, Joan becomes increasingly upset by the accolades showered on Joseph. She flees, and Joseph follows her. He demands that she take his prize, but she refuses. At their hotel, Joan tells Joseph she is divorcing him. They argue violently, and Joseph has a heart attack. Prostrate on the bed, he begs for Joan's love. She tells him she loves him; he replies \"You're such a good liar,\" and dies moments later. On the Concorde flight back to the US, Nathaniel offers his condolences to Joan. She tells him that if he tries to print anything that undermines Joseph's reputation as a writer, she will sue him. David overhears her. Joan says that she will tell David and his sister the truth when they get home. She then turns the page to the journal she had opened, runs her hand over a blank page, and looks up. ==Cast== * Glenn Close as Joan Castleman ** Annie Starke as Joan Archer, Joan's younger self * Jonathan Pryce as Professor Joseph Castleman ** Harry Lloyd as young Joseph Castleman * Christian Slater as Nathaniel Bone * Max Irons as David Castleman * Karin Franz K\u00f6rlof as Linnea * Elizabeth McGovern as Elaine Mozell * Alix Wilton Regan as Susannah Castleman ==Production== On May 16, 2014, it was reported that Glenn Close would star in an adaptation of the Meg Wolitzer novel The Wife.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 221 reviews, and an average rating of 7.14/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The Wife relies on the strength of Glenn Close's performance to drive home the power of its story\u2014and she proves thoroughly, grippingly up to the task.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Peter Travers gave the film four out of five stars in Rolling Stone, calling Close's acting a \"tour-de-force,\" and saying she \"takes it to the next level with a powerfully implosive performance that doubles as an accumulation of details that define a marriage. She never telegraphs Joan\u2019s feelings, letting them unravel slowly as we watch her attend parties as a buildup to the big night.\" The chief film critic for The Observer Mark Kermode described the movie as a \"Stockholm syndrome with a twist,\" while Glenn Close, interviewed by Robbie Collin for Irish Independent, described it as \"part-period piece, part-love story, part-Bergmanesque drama\u2014so much so the latter that it could have been called Scenes from a Marriage.\" Citing the screening coordinator Peggy Siegal, Bill McCuddy of the Gold Derby called The Wife \"the perfect '#MeToo' film\" and defined it as Oscar bait. San Diego Reader writer Scott Marks gave the film one out of five stars and criticized the film's simplicity, writing: \"It might not have been so bad had the road to the big reveal been paved with insight and originality, but other than the performances, there is nothing here audiences haven't seen more times than they have their own feet.\" Writing for the Chicago Reader, Ben Sachs wrote: \"Because the performances are so calculated, the emotional outbursts on which the story hinges fail to make a dramatic impact. And for a film about a novelist, The Wife conveys very little sense of what it's like to read or write.\" ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s) and nominee(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! rowspan=\"1\" scope=\"row\" |AACTA International Awards | rowspan=\"1\" |January 4, 2019 |Best Actress | rowspan=\"6\" | Glenn Close | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | Academy Awards | February 24, 2019 | Best Actress | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Alliance of Women Film Journalists | rowspan=\"2\"| January 20, 2019 | Best Actress | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | Actress Defying Age and Ageism | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\"| British Academy Film Awards | rowspan=\"1\"| February 10, 2019 | Best Actress in a Leading Role | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Capri Hollywood International Film Festival | rowspan=\"2\"| January 2, 2019 | Best Actress | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | Best Supporting Actor | Jonathan Pryce | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\"| Critics' Choice Movie Awards | rowspan=\"1\"| January 13, 2019 | Best Actress | rowspan=2| Glenn Close | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\"| Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Film Critics Association | rowspan=\"1\"| December 17, 2018 | Best Actress | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | Film by the Sea Festival | rowspan=\"1\"| Set 7-16, 2018 | Best Film and Literature | The Wife | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\"| Florida Film Critics Circle | rowspan=\"1\"| December 21, 2018 | Best Actress | rowspan=\"15\" | Glenn Close | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\"| Gotham Awards | rowspan=\"1\"| November 26, 2018 | Best Actress | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\"| Golden Globe Awards | rowspan=\"1\"| January 6, 2019 | Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\" | Hollywood Film Awards | rowspan=\"1\" | November 4, 2018 | Best Actress | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | Houston Film Critics Society | rowspan=\"1\" | January 3, 2019 | Best Actress | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | Independent Spirit Awards | February 23, 2019 | Best Female Lead | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"1\"| London Film Critics' Circle | rowspan=\"1\"| January 20, 2019 | Actress of the Year | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | Palm Springs International Film Festival | January 3, 2019 | Icon Award | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | San Diego Film Critics Society | December 10, 2018 | Best Actress | |rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | Satellite Awards | February 17, 2019 | Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama | |rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | Screen Actors Guild Awards | January 27, 2019 | Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role | | rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | St. Louis Gateway Film Critics Association | December 16, 2018 | Best Actress | |rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | Washington D.C.
