They are known as bark antlions - during the day they rest on the bark of trees, with their wings flattened. At night they may be attracted to lights. ==Species== ===Centroclisis maligna=== Widespread and fairly common in the drier western parts of southern Africa. It can distinguished from other Centroclisis species by its reddish colour. The larvae are large and robust; they live in sandy soils, but do not make pitfall traps.
