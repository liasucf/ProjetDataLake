He eventually rose to the rank of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de division and held the prestigious command of the Grenadiers \u00e0 Cheval de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale, the senior heavy cavalry regiment of the Imperial Guard.Fierro; Palluel-Guillard; Tulard, p. 904 He was made a baron in 1809 and then became a count in 1815, after which he was known as Comte Lepic. ==Early career and Revolutionary Wars== Born the eleventh child in a poor family from Montpellier, Lepic joined a dragoon regiment at age 16 and benefitted from the outburst of the French Revolution, which facilitated his promotion to squadron commander (March 1793). He was at first involved in fighting against the Vend\u00e9ean insurrection, before moving to the 'Army of Italy' in 1796, where he was remarked for gallantry and was wounded several times. Lepic remained in Italy until the end of 1805, when he was named colonel major of the Grenadiers \u00e0 Cheval de la Garde Imp\u00e9riale regiment of the newly created Imperial Guard, which he would command for the rest of his military career. ==Napoleonic Wars== Grenadiers \u00e0 Cheval as they are forming for a charge under intense fire at the battle of Eylau, in 1807.

At the battle of Eylau, seeing his horse grenadiers lowering their heads as bullets whistled around, Lepic uttered the famous words: \"Heads up, gentlemen, these are bullets, not turds !\" (Haut la t\u00eate, messieurs, la mitraille ce n'est pas de la merde !). The ensuing heroic charge at the head of his horse grenadiers, where he was seriously wounded, brought him the rank of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade. Seeing Lepic after the battle, Napoleon went to him and said: \"I thought you had been captured, general Lepic. I was feeling deeply sorrowful about it.\" Lepic retorted: \"Sire, you will only ever hear of my death.\" That evening, Lepic, who had been seriously wounded in action that day, received 50,000 francs, which he immediately distributed to his horse grenadiers. Five days later, he would be promoted to general and given an annuity of 30,000 francs.Pigeard, 143. Lepic then served in the Peninsula in 1808 but was called back to France in 1809 to serve in the newly created Grande Arm\u00e9e d'Allemagne, the main French army which fought the Austrians in the War of the Fifth Coalition. During this campaign, Lepic was named baron of the Empire and was involved with his horse grenadier regiment in the battle of Wagram. He would then serve in Spain and Portugal between 1810 and 1811, before being recalled to the second Grande Arm\u00e9e for the Russian campaign. During the campaign, his most important action was his regiment's charge against Platov's cossacks on November 7, which repulsed the Russian attack on the Emperor's headquarters. Lepic was promoted to g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de division in February 1813, and he took part in the Saxon campaign of the War of the Sixth Coalition, where he would fight his last battles. Having retired in 1814, he was made a count by King Louis XVIII in January 1815. He subsequently rallied to Napoleon's return in the Hundred Days. He served in the battle of Waterloo, before being retired by Louis XVIII. ==Legacy== The name LEPIC appears on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. His son was Louis-Joseph-Napol\u00e9on Lepic (1810\u20131875), who had a distinguished military career and was a close supporter of Napol\u00e9on III. His grandson was Ludovic-Napol\u00e9on Lepic, an artist and friend of Edgar Degas. ==References== ==Sources== *Fierro, Alfredo; Palluel-Guillard, Andr\u00e9; Tulard, Jean - \"Histoire et Dictionnaire du Consulat et de l'Empire\u201d, \u00c9ditions Robert Laffont, Category:Generals of the First French Empire Category:Commanders in the French Imperial Guard Category:1765 births Category:1827 deaths Category:Cavalry commanders Category:Names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe ",
