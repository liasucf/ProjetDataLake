He met Amparo on the set of Mam\u00e1 cumple cien a\u00f1os. The relationship subsequently received much publicity. Querejeta remained married throughout their relationship; although he and his wife, Maria Carmen y Marin had been living separate lives, there was never an official split and neither party pursued a divorce.
