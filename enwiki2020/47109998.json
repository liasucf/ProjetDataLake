It was built during the Ottoman period. ==History== The Hamra Square was a public space created in Haifa during the Ottoman period. It was surrounded by a market, Carmelite and Maronite churches, hotels, etc. In 1954, when the Israeli government commissioned the Carmelit funicular subway system from a French company, it decided to rename the area to Paris Square as a friendly gesture to the French. The station next to the square was named Paris Square as well. In 2018 the Paris Square Carmelit station was renamed Downtown Station. It is the lower terminus of the Carmelit. In 2011, the square was renovated, and its reopening ceremony was attended by the mayor of Paris at the time, Bertrand Delano\u00eb.\"HAIFA.
