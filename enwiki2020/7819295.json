    "text": "The Princess of Wales Hospital () is a district general hospital in Bridgend, Wales. It is managed by Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board. ==History== The hospital was commissioned to replace the aging Bridgend General Hospital. The new hospital, which was designed by Holder Mathias, was officially opened by the Princess of Wales on 11 June 1986. The George Thomas Scanner Suite was subsequently opened by the Princess of Wales and Viscount Tonypandy in February 1990. ==Services== The Surgical Materials Testing Laboratory, which provides testing and technical services to the Welsh NHS on medical devices, is based at the hospital. ==Performance== In May 2014 staff at the hospital was criticised in an report into the death of an elderly patient who had been treated at the hospital; the report found that there had been \"variable or poor professional behaviour and practice in the care of frail older people\". The Healthcare Inspectorate Wales carried out a mental health unit review in April 2015 and raised concerns about \"insufficient staffing levels to maintain safe levels of care\" and \"concerns around a specific patient for which there was inadequate recording of fluid intake and a care and treatment plan which did not adequately address the area of diabetes and an absence of any care strategy in relation to this area\". ==Uniforms== Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine re-designed the uniforms of the catering department as part of their ITV show, Trinny & Susannah Undress the Nation. The episode was broadcast on 18 December 2007. == Radio == Bridgend's Hospital Radio provides the hospital radio service at the hospital. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1985 Category:NHS hospitals in Wales Category:Hospitals in Bridgend County Borough Category:Hospitals established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board ",
