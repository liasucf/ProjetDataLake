November 1204) was the Ban of Bosnia from 1180 to 1204, first as a vassal of the Byzantine Empire and then of the Kingdom of Hungary, although his state was de facto independent. He was one of Bosnia's most prominent and notable historic rulers and had a great effect on the development of early Bosnian history. One of his most noteworthy diplomatic achievements is widely considered to have been the signing of the Charter of Ban Kulin, which encouraged trade and established peaceful relations between Dubrovnik and his realm of Bosnia.Franz Miklosich, Monumenta Serbica, Viennae, 1858 His son, Stjepan Kulini\u0107 succeeded him as Bosnian Ban. Kulin founded the House of Kulini\u0107. ==Early life== Kulin's sister was married to Miroslav of Hum, the brother of Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja (r. 1166\u20131196). Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (1143\u20131180) was at that time the overlord of Bosnia. In 1180, when Komnenos died, Stefan Nemanja and Kulin asserted independence of Serbia and Bosnia, respectively. ==Reign== His rule is often remembered as being emblematic of Bosnia's golden age, and he is a common hero of Bosnian national folk tales. Under him, the \"Bosnian Age of Peace and Prosperity\" would come to exist. Bosnia was completely autonomous and mostly at peace during his rule.Bosnia and Herzegovina -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia Bosnia and Herzegovina: Ancient and Medieval Periods ===War against Byzantium=== In 1183, he led his troops with the forces of the Kingdom of Hungary under King B\u00e9la and the Serbs under Stefan Nemanja, who had just launched an attack on the Byzantine Empire. The cause of the war was Hungary's non-recognition of the new emperor, Andronikos Komnenos. The united forces met little resistance in the eastern Serbian lands - the Byzantine squadrons were fighting among themselves as the local Byzantine commanders Alexios Brannes supported the new Emperor, while Andronikos Lapardes opposed him - and deserted the Imperial Army, going onto adventures on his own. Without difficulties, the Byzantines were pushed out of the Morava Valley and the allied forces breached all the way to Sofia, raiding Belgrade, Brani\u010devo, Ravno, Ni\u0161 and Sofia itself. ===Bogomils=== In 1199, Serbian prince Vukan Nemanji\u0107 informed the Pope, Innocent, of heresy in Bosnia. Vukan claimed that Kulin, a heretic, had welcomed the heretics whom Bernard of Split had banished, and treated them as Christians. In 1200, the Pope wrote a letter to Kulin's suzerain, the Hungarian King Emeric, warning him that \u201cno small number of Patarenes\u201d had gone from Split and Trogir to Ban Kulin where they were warmly welcomed, and told him to \u201cGo and ascertain the truth of these reports and if Kulin is unwilling to recant, drive him from your lands and confiscate his property.\u201d Kulin replied to the Pope that he did not regard the immigrants as heretics, but as Catholics, and that he was sending a few of them to Rome for examination, and also invited that a Papal representative be sent to investigate. Unconvinced, the Pope sent his legates to Bosnia to interrogate Kulin and his subjects about religion and life, and if indeed heretical, correct the situation through a prepared constitution. The Pope wrote to Bernard in 1202 that \"a multitude of people in Bosnia are suspected of the damnable heresy of the Cathars.\" The two legates sent by the Pope went through the country of Bosnia and interrogated the clergy. ====Bilino Polje abjuration==== Not only did Casamaris listen to his informants\u2019 answers, but where they were in error, he would have taught them correct doctrine, in line with Innocent's directive. John must have convinced himself that he had fulfilled Innocent's command to correct the krstjani, because the \u201cConfessio\u201d (Abjuration) signed at Bilino Polje by seven priors of the Krstjani church on 8 April 1203, makes no mention of errors. The same document was brought to Budapest, 30 April by Casamaris and Kulin and two abbots, where it was examined by the Hungarian King and the high clergy. Kulin's son On the surface, the \u201cConfessio\u201d concerned church organization and practices. The monks renounced their schism with Rome and agreed to accept Rome as the mother church. They promised to erect chapels with altars and crucifixes, where they would have priests who would say Mass and dispense Holy Communion at least seven times a year on the main feast days. The priests would also hear confession and give penances. The monks promised to chant the hours, night and day, and to read the Old Testament as well as the New. They would follow the Church's schedule of fasts, as well as their own regimen. They also agreed to stop calling themselves krstjani\u2014which had been their exclusive privilege\u2014lest they cause pain to other Christians. They would wear special, uncolored robes, closed and reaching the ankles. In addition they were to have graveyards next to the church, where they would bury their brethren and any visitors who happened to die there. Women members of the order were to have special quarters away from the men and to eat separately; nor could they be seen talking alone with a monk, lest they cause scandal. The abbots also agreed not to offer lodging to manicheans or other heretics. Finally, upon the death of the head of their order (magister), the abbots, after consultation with their fellow monks, would submit their choice to the Pope for his approval. As for the Bosnian Catholic diocese itself, John advised Innocent that they needed to break the hold of the Slavonic bishop who had ruled the Bosnian church up to then, and to appoint three or four Latin bishops, since Bosnia was a large country (\u201cten days\u2019 walk\u201d). After the \u201cConfessio\u201d was approved by King Emmerich, John de Casamaris, in a letter to Innocent, refers to \u201cthe former Patarenes.\u201d(23) Obviously, he thought that he had converted the krstjani, but he was wrong. Partly due to Rome's complacency (caused by Casamaris's feelings of success) and the Pope's failure to appoint Latin bishops, as John had suggested, the heretical movement grew stronger over the next few decades, uniting with remnants of the old native Catholic church. Together they formed a national, heretical church which survived crusades and threats of crusades until the mid-fifteenth century, when it gradually vanished in the face of the Ottoman takeover. ===Charter of Ban Kulin=== The Charter of Ban Kulin was a trade agreement between Bosnia and the Republic of Ragusa that effectively regulated Ragusan trade rights in Bosnia written on 29 August 1189. It is one of the oldest written state documents in the Balkans and is among the oldest historical documents written in Bosan\u010dica. The charter is of great significance in national pride and historical heritage.Franz Miklosich, Monumenta Serbica, Viennae, 1858, p. 8-9. ===Death=== After the death of Ban Kulin in 1204, the Bosnian throne was succeeded by his son Stjepan Kulini\u0107 (often referred to in English as Stephen Kulini\u0107). ==Marriage and children== Kulin married Vojislava, with whom he had two sons: *Stephen Kulini\u0107, the following Ban of Bosnia *A son that went with the Pope's emissaries in 1203 to explain heresy accusations against Kulin ==Legacy and folklore== As a founder of first de facto independent Bosnian state, Kulin was and still is highly regarded among Bosnians. Even today Kulin's era is regarded as one of the most prosperous historical eras, not just for Bosnian medieval state and its feudal lords, but for the common people as well, whose lasting memory of those times is kept in Bosnian folklore, like an old folk proverb with significant meaning: \"Od kulina Bana i dobrijeh dana\" (\"\"). Accordingly, in today's Bosnia and Herzegovina, many streets and town squares, as well as cultural institutions, and non-governmental organizations, bear Kulin's name, while numerous culturally significant events, manifestation, festivals and anniversaries are held in celebration of his life and deeds. ==See also== *Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Middle Ages *List of rulers of Bosnia ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * Category:Bans of Bosnia Category:12th-century births Category:1204 deaths Category:12th-century rulers in Europe Category:12th-century Bosnian people Category:13th-century Bosnian people Category:Kulini\u0107 dynasty Category:Bosnian monarchs ",
