    "text": "The Bophuthatswana Air Force (BAF) was the aviation branch of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force. The BAF existed from 1987 until 27 April 1994. The primary role of the BAF was to provide support and medevac services to the ground units of the Bophuthatswana army. The BAF operated from several bases, one being Mmabatho AFB. All surviving aircraft and helicopters were integrated into the South African Air Force after 27 April 1994. ==History== An air component of the BDF was established on 19 March 1981 with the purchase of an Alouette III from the South African Police. It was flown by Major De Villiers and Captain LaGrange of the SAAF, with Warrant Officer Strydom, ex-Rhodesian Air Force as Technical officer and Warrant Officer Viljoen of the South West African Police as Gunner and Navigator. In 1982, the unit became known as Bophuthatswana Air Wing with the arrival of a 2nd Alouette III and 2 Helio H-295s. In 1983, 2 Partenavia P.68s and an AS-355 \u00c9cureuil were purchased - the latter was assigned to VIP transports. In November 1989, it was replaced by an SA-365N1 Dauphin. In 1985, a CASA 212-200 Aviocar was purchased to transport paratroopers, a CASA 212-300 was received in 1987.Bophuthatswana Air Force CASA 212-300 The 2 Helios were withdrawn from service and replaced by 2 MBB/Kawasaki BK 117s.
