It was released under the guidance of Bart\u0142omiej \"Bart\" Krysiuk, and it is one of two records released under the name \"Batushka\" in 2019, the other one being Panihida, which was written and recorded by Krzysztof \"Derph\" Drabikowski. These competing releases come as a result of a falling out and subsequent legal dispute between Drabikowski and Krysiuk over control and ownership of the band and the \"Batushka\" name. ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ==Personnel== * \u0412\u0430\u0440\u0444\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0439 \u2013 lead vocals, producer * Pawe\u0142 Jaroszewicz \u2013 drums == See also == * List of number-one albums of 2019 (Poland) ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Metal Blade Records albums ",
