    "text": "Survival of the Fittest was a British reality TV series that premiered on ITV2 on 11 February 2018. The programme comes from the same production company that is behind Love Island. The series pits the girls and boys against each-other as a \"Battle of the Sexes\". They compete in various mental and physical challenges. The show is presented by Laura Whitmore, and is narrated by Brennan Reece. The series is filmed in South Africa with contestants living in a luxurious lodge. The series finished on 2 March 2018 with the girls being crowned the winners of Survival Of The Fittest. Mettisse was voted the fittest girl of the girls team and chose to split her \u00a340,000 cash prize with her team, so each girl received \u00a310,000. Billed as a sister-show to Love Island; the series was cancelled after one season due to low ratings.https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-09-24/survival-of-the-fittest- cancelled-itv2/ ==Contestants== On 11 February 2018, 6 boys and 6 girls began competing in a battle of the sexes for a cash prize of \u00a340,000. The boys and girls compete against each other in a series of team challenges throughout the series. The winning team will automatically be safe from elimination while the losing team will face the public vote. The opposing team will then decide who is to be eliminated among those who are not saved by the public vote. When a contestant is eliminated, a new contestant will join the lodge as replacement. After Shanice's arrival on Day 16, there will be no more replacements as the public votes for the \"fittest boy\" and \"fittest girl\", and only 4 girls and 4 boys will make the final. ===Boys' team=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:54%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:17%;\" | Name ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | Age ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Hometown ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | Entered ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:17%;\" | Status |- | scope=\"row\" | David Lundy | 26 | Surrey | Day 1 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 21) |- | scope=\"row\" | James Middleton | 24 | Fulham | Day 1 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 21) |- | scope=\"row\" | Tristan Jones | 20 | Manchester | Day 1 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 21) |- | scope=\"row\" | Warren Phillips | 30 | Gloucester | Day 1 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 21) |- | scope=\"row\" | Callum Pardoe | 21 | Pontypool | Day 1 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 19) |- | scope=\"row\" | Tom Wilson | 26 | Nottingham | Day 12 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 17) |- | scope=\"row\" | Joel Bennett | 28 | Manchester | Day 8 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 11) |- | scope=\"row\" | Ryan Cleary | 27 | Manchester | Day 1 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 7) |} ===Girls' team=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:54%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:17%;\" | Name ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | Age ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Hometown ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | Entered ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:17%;\" | Status |- | scope=\"row\" | Jennifer West | 31 | Wigan | Day 1 |style=\"background:lightgreen\" | Winners (Day 21) |- | scope=\"row\" | Mariam Musa | 23 | Surrey | Day 1 | style=\"background:lightgreen\" | Winners (Day 21) |- | scope=\"row\" | Mettisse Campbell | 21 | Birmingham | Day 4 | style=\"background:lightgreen\" | Winners (Day 21) |- | scope=\"row\" | Sam Dewhurst | 24 | Manchester | Day 6 | style=\"background:lightgreen\" | Winners (Day 21) |- | scope=\"row\" | Hayley Madigan | 28 | Portsmouth | Day 14 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 19) |- | scope=\"row\" | Shanice Benstead | 25 | Surrey | Day 16 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 17) |- | scope=\"row\" | Georgia Cole | 25 | Bristol | Day 1 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 15) |- | scope=\"row\" | Sydney Devereaux | 24 | Essex | Day 9 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 13) |- | scope=\"row\" | Lottie James | 22 | Wales | Day 2 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 9) |- | scope=\"row\" | Georgie Clarke | 25 | London | Day 1 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 5) |- | scope=\"row\" | Tia Latham | 28 | Buckinghamshire | Day 1 | style=\"background:#f4c7b8;\" | Eliminated (Day 3) |- | scope=\"row\" | Dani Dyer | 21 | East London | Day 1 | style=\"background:#FCF| Walked (Day 2) |} ===Elimination chart=== : Girls' team : Boys' team {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"12\" | Team challenge |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Contestant ! scope=\"col\" | 1 ! scope=\"col\" | 2 ! scope=\"col\" | 3 ! scope=\"col\" | 4There was no public vote after the team challenge.
