Contrary to the intentions of the Iraqi nationalists, the occupation ensured that the region became part of the modern state of Syria. The territory was located between the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration (OETA) in Syria on the West and British-occupied Iraq on the East. The governors of occupied Zor were, in order: Mar'i Pasha al-Mallah, Ramadan al-Shallash, and Mawlud Mukhlis; the latter two were members of the Iraqi Covenant Society. ==See also== * Haj Fadel Government ==References== ==Bibliography== * Christian Velud.
