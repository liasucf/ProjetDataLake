M\u00e9ribel refers to three neighbouring villages in the Les Allues commune of the Savoie d\u00e9partement of France, near the town of Mo\u00fbtiers (), called M\u00e9ribel Centre, M\u00e9ribel-Mottaret and M\u00e9ribel Village. The villages are within the Vanoise National Park and a part of the Les Trois Vall\u00e9es interlinked ski system. M\u00e9ribel Les Allues is a ski resort that was developed adjacent to the traditional hamlet of Morel, with its centre situated at about 1400 metres above sea level. It was founded by a Scotsman, Major Peter Lindsay,https://snowlimitsskischool.com/the-history-of-meribel/ who was looking for a new site for winter sports away from the ski resorts of Austria and Germany, because of the growing strength of the Nazi regime. In 1936, he visited the town of Les Allues for the first time. He then imagined how the town could become a ski resort. Firstly, he decided to create a property company in order to develop finances strong enough to build the resort. In 1938, the first lift was placed above Les Allues. A year later, he began the construction of the first chalets and hotels in the hamlet of M\u00e9ribel. Three years later, the war would stop the development of the resort, but when it was over, development continued. Now a Colonel, Peter Lindsay used specialized architects, Paul Grillo, Grand Prix de Rome (1937), and his partner Christian Durupt, so that all buildings would be in harmony with the Savoyard style, using wood and stone for the walls, with slanted slate roofs. In 1950, the Burgin-Saulire gondola was built to link the resort to Courchevel. Lindsay's family continue to hold a financial stake in the resort. Lindsay's ashes and those of his wife are scattered on the Burgin mountain. M\u00e9ribel was home to events of the 1992 Winter Olympics (Albertville). It hosted the ice hockey and the women's alpine skiing events.1992 Winter Olympics official report. pp. 106\u2013109. Until 2011, M\u00e9ribel was the host to the acclaimed Altitude Festival, with prestigious acts such as KT Tunstall, Marcus Brigstocke and Omid Dijalili performing in the bars and nightclubs around the resort. For 2011, it has been announced that the festival will be moved to Austria, with the organiser Richard Letts citing a reduction in support from the M\u00e9ribel Tourist Office. The ski resort is part of the Trois Vall\u00e9es ski area. The Three Valleys area comprises 180 lifts, 335 marked runs (over 600 kilometres) and over 130km of cross-country tracks. The Three Valleys was expanded in 1996 to incorporate a fourth valley, though the area kept the name Trois Vall\u00e9es. The area comprises the resorts of Courchevel, La Tania, M\u00e9ribel, Les Menuires-Saint Martin, Val Thorens and Orelle. The resort comprises the sub village of M\u00e9ribel-Mottaret, at an altitude of 1750 m towards the head of the Allues valley, and M\u00e9ribel Village at 1400 m on the road to Courchevel 1850. ==Lift system== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" |- Current Lifts |- ! scope=\"col\" | Name ! scope=\"col\" | Type ! scope=\"col\" | Persons per hour ! scope=\"col\" | Year of construction ! scope=\"col\" | Manufacturer |- | Table Verte || Chairlift fixed 4 places || 1250 || 1981 || Poma |- | Burgin 1 || Gondola 6 places || 1700 || 1982 || Poma |- | Burgin 2 || Gondola 6 places || 1700 || 1982 || Poma |- | Plattieres 2 || Gondola 6 places || 2200 || 1983 || Poma |- | Plattieres 1 || Gondola 6 places || 2200 || 1984 || Poma |- | Plattieres 3 || Gondola 6 places || 2200 || 1984 || Poma |- | Arolles || Chairlift fixed 4 places || 1800 || 1985 || Skirail |- | Rocher de la Loze || Chairlift fixed 4 places || 1500 || 1988 || Poma |- | Mont-Vallon || Gondola 12 places || 3400 || 1988 || Poma |- | Rhodos || Gondola 12 places || 2025 || 1989 || Von Roll |- | Mures Rouges || Chairlift detachable 4 places || 1800 || 1989 || Poma |- | Roc de Fer || Chairlift fixed 4 places || 1460 || 1990 || Poma |- | Olympe 1 || Gondola 6 places || 920 || 1990 || Poma |- | Olympe 2 || Gondola 6 places || 920 || 1990 || Poma |- | Olympe 3 || Gondola 6 places || 920 || 1990 || Poma |- | Olympic Express || Chairlift detachable 4 places || 1500 || 1990 || Poma |- | Morel || Chairlift fixed 3 places || 700 || 1991 || Poma |- | C\u00f4tes Brune || Chairlift detachable 4 places || 2070 || 1991 || Poma |- | Combes || Chairlift detachable 4 places || 2400 || 1994 || Doppelmayr |- | Pas du Lac 1 || Gondola 8 places || 3000 || 1997 || Poma |- | Pas du Lac 2 || Gondola 8 places || 3000 || 1997 || Poma |- | Adret || Chairlift detachable 6 places || 2400 || 1998 || Poma |- | Dent de Burgin || Chairlift detachable 6 places || 2400 || 2000 || Poma |- | Altiport || Chairlift detachable 8 places || 3400 || 2000 || Poma |- | Plan des Mains || Chairlift detachable 6 places || 3000 || 2002 || Leitner |- | Plan de l'Homme || Chairlift detachable 6 places || 3000 || 2004 || Poma |- | Ch\u00e2telet || Chairlift detachable 6 places || 2200 || 2006 || Poma |- | Chalets || Gondola pulsed 6 places || 522 || 2007 || Poma |- | Tougn\u00e8te 2 || Chairlift detachable 6 places covered || 3600 || 2007 || Poma |- | Tougn\u00e8te 1 || Gondola 6 places || 1500 || 2008 || Poma |- | Golf || Chairlift detachable 4 places || 1500 || 2009 || Poma |- | Altiport || Button lift continuous || 500 || 2009 || Poma |- | Doron || Conveyor belt covered || || 2010 || Poma |- | Les Loupiots || Conveyor belt || || || Poma |- | Foret || Rope tow || || || Poma |- | Combe || Button lift detachable || || || Poma |- | Cotes || Button lift detachable || || || Poma |- | Escargot || Button lift continuous || || 2005 || Poma |- | Arpasson || Button lift continuous || || 2006 || Poma |- | Roc de Tougne 1 & 2 || Button lift detachable || || || Poma |- | Aigle || Button lift detachable || || || Poma |- | Sitelle || Button lift detachable || || || Poma |- | Stade || Button lift continuous || || || Poma |- |} Past projects *For the 2012 season, the Burgin-Saulire 2 gondola is being replaced, and the new lift will be called Saulire Express 2.

Most well known neighbour systems are Paradiski (Les Arcs, La Plagne) and Espace Killy (Val-d'Is\u00e8re and Tignes). A weekly lift ticket in M\u00e9ribel/Les Trois Vall\u00e9es offers a choice to ski one day in each of the other two systems mentioned. There were once plans to interlink all systems and resorts to create the - by far - largest ski area in the world. However that vision was ended with the creation of the Vanoise National Park. ==See also== *List of ski areas and resorts in Europe *M\u00e9ribel Airport *Battle of M\u00e9ribel ==References== ==External links== * Vanoise National Park * Panoramic virtual tour at top of Mont Vallon gondola at 360 Travel Guide * Meribel Piste Map * Category:Venues of the 1992 Winter Olympics Category:Olympic alpine skiing venues Category:Ski areas and resorts in France Category:Tourist attractions in Savoie Category:Sports venues in Savoie ",
