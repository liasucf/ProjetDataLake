Ali, Nasir Khan, Ruman Khan and Sumit Bajaj) for the first time at a nightclub in Park Street who offered to drop her home, when she was leaving. Soon after, she was gang-raped by the five in a moving car and later, dumped near Exide Crossing, opposite the Calcutta Club. Around 3.30 am, she boarded a taxi to her residence in Behala. ===Revealing her identity=== While the media and police initially ensured an information blackout of the victim's name, as is customary in India, she later publicly revealed her identity as 37 year old and a mother of two, in order to encourage other survivors to speak out. After revealing her identity, she said, \"Why should I hide my identity when it was not even my fault? Why should I be ashamed of something that I did not give rise to? I was subjected to brutality, I was subjected to torture, and I was subjected to rape, and I am fighting and I will fight.\" At the time of her death, three of the five men accused of raping Jordan inside a moving car had been arrested and were on trial, although they denied the charges. The remaining two, including the main suspect, had not been arrested. The names of the accused are main accused Mohommad Ali and Kader Khan (The then boyfriend Of Nusrat Jahan) who are absconding, and Nasir Khan, Ruman Khan (Ruman Khan alias Tussi) and Sumit Bajaj who are in custody. ===Outcome of case=== One of the prime accused was Kadir Khan, the then boyfriend of Bengali television star Nusrat Jahanwho later went on to become a member of parliament from Basirhat.
