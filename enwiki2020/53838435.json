She was the subject of a painting by Edward Burne-Jones. Deslandes travelled to England in 1893 to meet Burne-Jones in preparation for an article that she was writing about him for Le Figaro. It was arranged that Burne-Jones would paint Deslandes' portrait, which he did in 1895-96. Deslandes wrote under the pseudonym \"Ossit\". She wrote four novels : A quoi bon? (1892), Ilse (1894), Il n'y a plus d'\u00eeles bienheureuses (1898) and Cyr\u00e8ne (1908). According to Emily Wubben, Deslandes \"pursued a glittering social life in Parisian literary and artistic circles. She was celebrated as a hostess of a cultured salon that attracted the presence of renowned artists, poets and composers.\" She once entered a lion's cage at a fair and recited poetry by Jean Richepin. ==References== Category:1866 births Category:1929 deaths Category:French women writers Category:Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood artists' models Category:French baronesses Category:People from Montlu\u00e7on ",
