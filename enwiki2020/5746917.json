Rae promptly dumps Michael at a convenience store and hops a ride to the airport. Soon after, Michael loses the car when a young kid cons him out of the keys. Michael soon finds his day going from bad to worse when he's caught up in a botched robbery at the convenience store where he's now stranded. The cops (local vigilantes) show up ready for a gunfight. Michael finds himself trying to convince the gunman (Y\u00e1\u00f1ez) to let him and the other hostages go, all while trying to plan how to get to the airport before Rae's flight leaves. ==Cast and characters== *Jamie Foxx as Michael Dawson A.K.A.
