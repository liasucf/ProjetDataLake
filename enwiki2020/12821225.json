    "text": "Officers Row, a part of the Vancouver National Historic Reserve Historic District, is a congregation of 21 of the former homes of U.S. military officers stationed at the Vancouver Barracks in Vancouver, Washington.cityofvancouver.usClark County Historic Register The oldest of the homes, named the Grant House (after Ulysses S. Grant, who was stationed at the barracks as a Captain at that time but never lived in the house), dates from 1846, and the last edifice was constructed in 1906. In the 1970s a grassroots campaign to refurbish the dilapidated properties began to appear, and the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In 1980, the U.S. Army declared it a surplus, and it was henceforth deeded to the city for one dollar. A $10.9 million rehabilitation effort proceeded in 1987. Today these homes have been fully restored, and now house several commercial and 34 residential rental spaces. ==See also== * Firsts Monument ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Clark County, Washington Category:National Historic Sites in Washington (state) Category:Buildings and structures in Vancouver, Washington Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington (state) ",
