    "text": "Plaque at the monument. Photo: Rice University Okj\u00f6kull (Ok glacier) was a glacier in western Iceland on top of the shield volcano Ok. Ok is located northeast of Reykjav\u00edk. The glacier was declared dead in 2014 by glaciologist Oddur Sigur\u00f0sson. In 2018, anthropologists Cymene Howe and Dominic Boyer of Rice University filmed a documentary about its loss, Not Ok, and proposed a commemorative plaque. The plaque was installed on August 18, 2019, with an inscription written by Andri Sn\u00e6r Magnason, titled \"A letter to the future\", in Icelandic and English. The English version is: > Ok is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier. In the > next 200 years all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This > monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to > be done. Only you know if we did it. At the end is the global atmospheric carbon dioxide reading for that month: 415 ppm. The ceremony was attended by Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, the Prime Minister of Iceland; Gu\u00f0mundur Ingi Gu\u00f0brandsson, the Environment Minister; and Mary Robinson, the former President of Ireland. The placement of the plaque is intended to raise awareness of the decline of Iceland's glaciers due to global warming. Prior to the ceremony, NASA Earth Observatory tweeted images of Okj\u00f6kull in 1986 and 2019. == References == Category:Glaciers of Iceland ",
