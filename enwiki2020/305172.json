    "text": "{| |} The Harrier, informally referred to as the Harrier Jump Jet, is a family of jet-powered attack aircraft capable of vertical/short takeoff and landing operations (V/STOL). Named after a bird of prey, it was originally developed by British manufacturer Hawker Siddeley in the 1960s. The Harrier emerged as the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many attempted during that era. It was a subsonic aircraft, unlike most of its competitors. It was conceived to operate from improvised bases, such as car parks or forest clearings, without requiring large and vulnerable air bases. Later, the design was adapted for use from aircraft carriers. There are two generations and four main variants of the Harrier family, developed by both UK and US manufacturers: * Hawker Siddeley Harrier ** British Aerospace Sea Harrier * McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II ** British Aerospace Harrier II The Hawker Siddeley Harrier is the first generation-version and is also known as the AV-8A Harrier; it was used by multiple air forces, including the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The Sea Harrier is a naval strike/air defence fighter derived from the Hawker Siddeley Harrier; it was operated by both the Royal Navy and the Indian Navy. During the 1980s, a second generation Harrier emerged; manufactured in the United States as the AV-8B and in Britain as the British Aerospace Harrier II respectively. By the start of the 21st century, the majority of the first generation Harriers had been withdrawn, many operators having chosen to procure the second generation as a replacement. In the long term, several operators have announced their intention to supplement or replace their Harrier fleets with the STOVL variant of the F-35 Lightning II, designated as the F-35B. ==Development== ===Background=== Throughout the 1950s, particularly in the years following the Korean War, a number of aircraft companies in both Europe and America separately decided to investigate the prospective capabilities and viability of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, which would eliminate the requirement for vulnerable runways by taking off and landing vertically as opposed to the conventional horizontal approach.Mason 1967, p. 3. In addition to military applications, the prospect of applying such technology to commercial airliners was also viewed with considerable interest by the mid 1950s, thus the value of developing viable vertical take-off systems was judged to be substantial. However, during this era, few companies envisioned that a VTOL aircraft could also be compatible with the characteristics of high performance military aircraft. Underside view of the first prototype P.1127. The rotating jet nozzles were a key design element of its VTOL capability During 1957, following an approach by the British aero engine manufacturer Bristol Engine Company, who were designing an innovative vectored thrust engine, British aviation conglomerate Hawker Aircraft developed their design for an aeroplane that could meet an existing NATO specification calling for a \"Light Tactical Support Fighter\". Bristol's projected vectored thrust engine, which received the name Pegasus,The name \"Pegasus\" for the engine was in keeping with Bristol's tradition of naming engines after figures from classical mythology. harnessed rotatable cold jets which were positioned on either side of the compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe; this concept had originated from Michel Wibault, a French aviation consultant. Throughout much of the early development work, there was no financial support for the project from HM Treasury; however, support for the engine development portion of the effort was sourced via NATO's Mutual Weapon Development Program (MWDP).Mason 1967, p. 3.Jefford 2006, pp. 21\u201322. Senior project engineer Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft to take advantage of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. During March 1959, the newly merged Hawker Siddeley decided to privately fund a pair of prototypes of the design, which had received the internal company designation of P.1127, to demonstrate the design's capabilities.Spick and Gunston 2000, p. 358. During the 1960s, the P.1127 attracted the attention of the RAF; this would eventually result in the development and issuing of Requirement ASR 384, which sought a V/STOL aircraft for ground attack operations.Jefford 2006, p. 13. During late 1965, the RAF placed an order for six pre-production P.1127 (RAF) aircraft.Jenkins 1998, p. 21. ===Requirements and emergence=== alt=An aircraft landed on a runway Around the same time as the RAF's interest in the concept, NATO proceeded to develop their own specification, NBMR-3, which called for a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft; specific requirements included the expectation for the performance of such an aircraft to be equivalent to the conventional McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II fighter. Specifications called for a supersonic V/STOL strike fighter with a combat radius of , a cruise speed of Mach 0.92, and a dash speed of Mach 1.5.Wood 1975, p. 215. During the early 1960s, Hawker commenced work upon developing a supersonic version of the P.1127, designated the P.1150, culminating in the abortive Hawker P.1154. NBMR.3 also attracted ten other contenders, among which was P.1154's principal competitor, the Dassault Mirage IIIV. The P.1154 was ultimately selected to meet NBMR-3; however, this did not lead to orders being placed.Wood 1975, p. 216. On 6 December 1961, prior to the design being submitted to NATO, it was decided that the P.1154 would be developed with the requirements for use by both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy (RN).Buttler 2000, pp. 118\u2013119. Following the cancellation of the NBMR-3 requirement, HSA focused all its attention on the British joint requirement.Wood 1975, p. 216. Accordingly, development of the type continued for some time; however, by October 1963, the Ministry of Aviation was concerned with the project's progress, and noted that the effort to combine a strike aircraft and a fighter in a single aircraft, and trying to fit that same airframe to both of the services, was \"unsound\".Buttler 2000, p. 120. On 2 February 1965, work on the P.1154 was cancelled by the new British government on grounds of cost at the point of prototype construction.Buttler 2000, p. 121. Irrespective of work on the P.1154 programme, development had continued on the subsonic P.1127 evaluation aircraft. A total of nine aircraft, known as the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel, was ordered and manufactured for testing.Mason 1967, p. 7. During 1964, the first of these had commenced flight operations; the Kestrel was assessed by the multinational \"Tri-partite Evaluation Squadron\", which consisted of British, US and German pilots, to determine how VTOL aircraft could be operated; the evaluations were finalised in November 1965.Spick and Gunston 2000, p. 362. During 1966, following the cancellation of the P.1154, the RAF opted to proceed with ordering a modified derivative of the P.1127/Kestrel for service, which was designated the Harrier GR.1.Jenkins 1998, p. 21.\"VTOL Aircraft 1966\". Flight International, 26 May 1966. p. 884. ===First-generation Harriers=== The Hawker Siddeley Harrier GR.1/GR.3 and the AV-8A Harrier were the first generation of the Harrier series, the first operational close-support and reconnaissance attack aircraft with vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) capabilities. These were developed directly from the Hawker P.1127 prototype and the Kestrel evaluation aircraft. On 18 April 1969, the Harrier GR.1 officially entered service with the RAF when the Harrier Conversion Unit at RAF Wittering received its first aircraft.Evans 1998, pp. 21\u201322. The United States Marine Corps (USMC) also chose to procure the type, receiving 102 AV-8A and 8 TAV-8A Harriers between 1971 and 1976.Nordeen 2006, p. 31. The British Aerospace Sea Harrier is a naval V/STOL jet fighter, reconnaissance and attack aircraft; it was a navalised development of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier. The first version entered service with the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm in April 1980 as the Sea Harrier FRS.1, and was informally known as the Shar.Grove 1987, pp. 319\u2013320. Sea Harriers played a high-profile role in the Falklands War of 1982, flying from the aircraft carriers HMS Invincible and HMS Hermes. Wartime experiences led to the production of an improved model in the form of the upgraded Sea Harrier FA2; this version entered operational service on 2 April 1993. The Sea Harrier was also procured by the Indian Navy, where the first Indian Sea Harriers entered squadron service during December 1983.Hiranandani 2000, p. 276. ===Second-generation Harriers=== As early as 1973, Hawker Siddeley and American aviation manufacturer McDonnell Douglas were jointly working on development of a more capable version of the Harrier. Early efforts concentrated on the development of an improved Pegasus engine, designated the Pegasus 15, which was being tested by Bristol Siddeley.Wilson 2000, p. 26. During August 1981, the program received a boost when British Aerospace (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking the UK's re-entry into the program. The Harrier was extensively redeveloped by McDonnell Douglas, and later joined by BAe (now parts of Boeing and BAE Systems, respectively), leading to the family of second-generation V/STOL jet multi-role aircraft. The American designation for this was the AV-8B Harrier II.Nordeen, Lon O. Harrier II, Validating V/STOL. Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 2006. . On 12 December 1983, the first production AV-8B was delivered to the USMC. The AV-8B is primarily used for attack or multi-role tasks, typically operated from small aircraft carriers.Nordeen 2006, p. 59.Jenkins 1998, p. 76. The RAF also chose to procure the second generation of the British Aerospace-built (with McDonnell Douglas as subcontractor) Harrier II GR5/GR7/GR9, which entered service in the mid-1980s.Jefford et al. 2006, pp. 81\u201382. This model was also operated by several other NATO countries, including Spain and Italy. In December 1989, the first RAF squadron to be equipped with the Harrier II was declared operational.Nordeen 2006, p. 68. The British Harrier II was used by the RAF and later by the Royal Navy up to 2010, at which point the Harrier II and the Joint Force Harrier operational unit was disbanded as a cost-saving measure.Wyatt, Caroline. \"Struggle at the top over decision to scrap UK Harriers.\" BBC News, 15 December 2010. Between 1969 and 2003, 824 Harrier variants were delivered. While the manufacture of new Harriers concluded in 1997, the last remanufactured aircraft (Harrier II Plus configuration) was delivered in December 2003, ending the Harrier production line.\"Harrier Projects\". airforce-technology.com. Retrieved: 21 July 2011. ==Operation== alt=Aircraft engine, partially uncovered as an exhibit Locations of the four nozzles at the sides of the Pegasus engine. The Harrier Jump Jet, capable of taking off vertically, can only do so at less than its maximum loaded weight. In most cases, a short take off is needed to lift the required amount of fuel and weapons needed for a training sortie/mission, using forward speed to supplement the jet lift with aerodynamic lift. A short takeoff also uses less fuel than a vertical take off. On aircraft carriers, a ski-jump ramp is used at the bow of the carrier to help the aircraft become airborne. Landings are not usually done in a conventional manner because the range of speeds at which this is advisable is narrow due to the relatively vulnerable outrigger undercarriage. Operationally, a near-vertical landing with some forward speed is preferred, and this technique called Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL). Rotating the vectored thrust nozzles to some angle other than rearwards during normal flight (to a maximum of 8-degree forward of vertical, i.e. 98 deg.) is called vectoring in forward flight, or \"VIFFing\". This is a dog-fighting tactic, allowing for more sudden braking and higher turn rates. Braking could cause a chasing aircraft to overshoot and present itself as a target for the Harrier, a technique formally developed by the USMC for the Harrier in the early 1970s.Nordeen 2006, pp. 33\u201334.Spick 2000, pp. 382\u2013383. This technique was much discussed in the Media before the Falklands War in 1982, but ultimately not used by British pilots in that conflict.\"Air War South Atlantic\" by Jeffrey Ethel and Alfred Price published in 1983. However, the ability to rotate the nozzles slightly forwards did allow the aircraft to fly slowly backwards in the hover, which was widely used in British and American airshows.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKQlxCbaRQ4 The wind direction is critical during VTOL manoeuvres because unless it enters the intake from straight ahead it will push the nose sideways as it turns to enter the intake (known as intake momentum drag). If not corrected immediately the aircraft will roll out of control. The pilot has a wind vane in front of the windscreen to help him keep pointing into the wind.A View From The Hover My Life In Aviation, John Farley2008, , p.81 The procedure for vertical takeoff involves facing the aircraft into the wind. The swivelling nozzles are pointed vertically downwards (thrust vector 90\u00b0) and the throttle is pushed to its maximum stop, at which point the aircraft leaves the ground. The throttle is adjusted until hovering is achieved at the desired altitude.Brown 1970, p. 83. The short-takeoff procedure involves proceeding with a normal takeoff and then rotating the nozzles partially downwards (a thrust vector less than 90\u00b0) at a speed below the normal takeoff speed; usually this is done at about . For a shorter takeoff run the thrust vector is greater for more jet lift. The reaction control system uses thrusters at the aircraft extremeties, nose, tail and wingtips. Thrust from the engine can be temporarily syphoned to control the aircraft's pitch, roll and yaw before it is going fast enough for the elevators, rudder and ailerons to become effective.\"Hawker Harrier reaction control system\" U.S. Centennial of Flight, 2003. Retrieved 28 August 2011. The Harrier has been described by pilots as \"unforgiving\" to fly.Nordeen 2006, p. 60. The aircraft is capable of both forward flight (where it behaves like a fixed-wing aircraft above its stall speed), as well as VTOL (where the conventional lift and control surfaces are ineffective) and STOL. Accelerating and decelerating transitions between hovering and conventional flight required considerable skill and concentration on the part of the pilot, especially in crosswind conditions.Properly To Test, Book One \"The Early Years\",Reminiscences Of Flying At The Aeroplane And Armament Experimental Establishment Boscombe Down, Bernard Noble 2003, , Chapter 21 Merriman, p.178,179 Pilots for the combined UK/US/Germany trials on the Kestrel were first given several hours helicopter tuitionJefford 2006, p. 41. Royal Air Force pilots destined for Harrier squadrons were usually selected from those with single-seat fast-jet experience. On two occasions the Royal Air Force explored whether experienced helicopter pilots, with their ability to hover and transition to forward flight, would be a better source for Harrier squadrons. In both cases the pilots were completely out of their depth with conventional flight, navigation, orientation and weapons delivery at the high speeds of a fast jet.Properly To Test, Book One \"The Early Years\",Reminiscences Of Flying At The Aeroplane And Armament Experimental Establishment Boscombe Down, Bernard Noble 2003, , Chapter 21 Merriman, p.178,179 With the introduction of two-seat Harriers less experienced pilots were introduced. The United States Marine Corps also started with very experienced pilots, who were mostly test pilots.Flight International Magazine, \"The Royal Air Force record\", 27 August 1977, p.588,589 In addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling the direction of the four vectoring nozzles. Pilots were impressed that to control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit.Jefford 2006, p. 42. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downward.Markman and Holder 2000, pp. 74\u201377.Jenkins 1998, p. 25. ===Replacement=== During 2010, it was announced that the RAF and RN would retire their remaining Harriers by 2011,\"Securing Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: The Strategic Defence and Security Review\" . HM Government, 19 October 2010. Retrieved: 19 October 2010. and in December 2010 the RAF's Harrier GR9s made their last operational flights.\"Harrier jump jets make final flight from RAF Cottesmore\". BBC News, In June 2011, the MoD denied press reports that the aircraft were to be sold to the US Marine Corps for spares to support their AV-8B fleet.\"Harrier jump- jets sold 'for peanuts'. The Telegraph, 15 June 2011.\"MoD denies sale of Harriers to US\" . DMJ, 15 June 2011. However, at the end of November 2011, the Defence Minister Peter Luff announced the sale of the final 72 Harriers to the US Marine Corps, with the aircraft to be used as sources of spare parts for the Marine Corps' airworthy fleet. , the STOVL variant of the F-35 Lightning II (formerly the Joint Strike Fighter), designated the F-35B, is intended to replace the AV-8B Harrier II in service with the US Marine Corps\"Harrier Production\".

Defense News, 10 May 2012. Italian Navy AV-8Bs are also slated to be replaced by 15 (originally 22) F-35Bs, which will form the air wing of Cavour. During the first half of 2016, the Indian Navy retired the last of their remaining 11 Sea Harriers, which had been operating from INS Viraat (formerly ), in favour of the conventional Mikoyan MiG-29K. Starting in 2007, Spain was looking to replace its Harrier IIs\u2013with the likely option being the F-35B. The Spanish government, in May 2014 however, announced that it had decided to extend the aircraft's service life to beyond 2025 due to a lack of funds for a replacement aircraft. ==Variants== ; Hawker P.1127 : (1960) ; Kestrel FGA.1 : (1964) ; Harrier GR.1/1A/3/3A : (from 1966) ; Harrier T.2/2A/4/4A/8/52/60 : (from 1970) ; AV-8A/C/S Harrier Mk.50/53/55/Matador ; TAV-8A/S Harrier Mk.54/Matador ; Sea Harrier FRS.1/FRS.51/F(A).2 : (from 1978) ; AV-8B Harrier II/EAV-8B Matador II/AV-8B Harrier II Night Attack/AV-8B Harrier II Plus : (from 1983) ; TAV-8B Harrier II/ETAV-8B Matador II/ ; Harrier GR.5/5A/7/7A/9/9A : (from 1985) ; Harrier T.10/12 File:Hawker P. 1127 - NASA.jpg|The Hawker P.1127, predecessor of the Harrier File:Harrierxv752.jpg|An RAF Harrier GR3 on display at Bletchley Park, England File:SeaHarriers FA2 in Persian Gulf.jpg|Royal Navy Sea Harrier FA2s of 801 Naval Air Squadron on the deck of HMS Illustrious in the Persian Gulf File:Harrier AV-8B.jpg|US Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier File:AV-8B Harrier landing aboard Principe de Asturias (R11).jpg|AV-8B Harrier landing aboard Principe de Asturias File:bae harrier gr9 zg502 takeoff arp.jpg|RAF Harrier GR9 arrives at RIAT 2008 ==Operators== Operators of the Harrier (all variants) alt=A parked Harrier United States Marine Corps AV-8A of alt=several Harriers stored on board a ship ; *Indian Navy (former)Indian Navy Retires Sea Harriers 21 March 2016.
