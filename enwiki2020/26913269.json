C., Goodman, N. D., & Tenenbaum, J. (2009). Using speakers\u2019 referential intentions to model early cross-situational word learning . Psychological Science, 20, 579-585. He has also studied the role of language in numerical cognition by comparing the performance of native Pirah\u00e3 language speakers to that of MIT undergraduate students in numeric tasks.Frank, M. C., Everett, D. L., Fedorenko, E., & Gibson, E., (2008). Number as a cognitive technology: Evidence from Pirah\u00e3 language and cognition. Cognition, 108, 819-824. For this work, he traveled to Amazonas, Brazil with Daniel Everett, a linguist best known for his claim that Pirah\u00e3 disproves a crucial component of Noam Chomsky's theory of universal grammar, recursion. Frank won the Cognitive Science Society's prestigious Marr Award for this work in 2008.List of Marr Award winners published by the Cognitive Science Society ==References== Category:Cognitive development researchers Category:Cognitive scientists Category:Hunter College High School alumni Category:Stanford University Department of Psychology faculty Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
