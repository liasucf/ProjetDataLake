    "text": "\"'My Man\" is the debut single by Dutch girl group Luv', released in May 1977 by Philips/Phonogram Records. It appears on the 1978 album With Luv. ==Background== The song is Luv's very first commercially available single. In 1976, producers and songwriters Hans van Hemert and Piet Souer first recorded the music of a self-penned composition entitled \"My Man\" and were looking for female vocalists. They recruited three young women (Jos\u00e9 Hoebee, Marga Scheide and Patty Brard) to form the girl group Luv'. The lyrics of this ABBA-esque track dealt with a railroad man who was shot and died. It was a coincidence that around the time of its release, a taking of hostages happened in a train in De Punt in late May/early June 1977. ==Track listing and release== 7\" VinylRelease information on Rate your music website Accessed: February 11, 2011 * a. \"My Man\" * b. \"Don't Let Me Down\" {|class=\"wikitable\" !
