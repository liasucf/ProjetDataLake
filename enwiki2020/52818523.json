Mike Clark unexpectedly died in his sleep in the early morning of October 16, 2018 at the age of 63 following a long hiatus from the podcast due to vocal cord paralysis. Drew and the rest of his crew continue to do the show under the \"Drew & Mike\" banner, choosing to keep Clark's name in the title to honor his integral part of the show's past.
