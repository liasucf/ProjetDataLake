He was best known for producing the cult film Carnival Magic, for his role in a landmark copyright infringement decision v. Columbia Television, and as the owner of a significant private film collection. ==Career== Feltner's lengthy career in telecommunications and film began as an instructor at The RCA Institute For TV Production in New York City.Miller, Jeff \u2013 History of Broadcasting in West Virginia \"WHIS-TV/WVVA-TV\" He later founded Krypton International Corp, which owned/operated independent television stations in the southeastern United States.Altaner, David \u2013 Sun Sentinel (September 28, 1990) \"New Owner Buyer Plans For WTVX to Join Chain of National Independents\" He spent decades amassing one of the larger known independent film collections in the world. \"I've been buying up rights to films for 22 years,\" he told Inc Magazine in 1985.\"Family Fare\" Fenn, Donna \u2013 Inc Magazine (February 1, 1985) (The collection was recently \"rescued\" by the New York-based company Film Chest, according to a 2010 Boston Globe article.\"He's on The Hunt for Lost Movie Treasures\" Peary, Gerald \u2013 Boston Globe (October 10, 2010)) He served as Executive Producer of the 1964 film Teen-Age Strangler (aka Terror in the Night), and producer of the 1981 children's movie and cult favorite Carnival Magic.Internet Movie Database \u2013 Elvin Feltner profile He is the author of the self-help book Winning Is Everything, Losing is Nothing: For Nice Folks Who Want To Finish First, published in 1981 by Chelsea House.; Amazon.com \u2013 Product description page Winning is Everything He provided the seed capital for the RFD-TV Network, was a partner in Palm Beach Films, Inc, and is a former owner of the United States Basketball League team The Palm Beach Stingrays.\"Stingrays Change to Palm Beach\" Sun Sentinel (May 3, 1988) ==Lawsuit== In 1991, Feltner was a defendant in a lawsuit v. Columbia Pictures Television, Inc, for copyright infringement. The case, which spent seven years in the courts and went as high as the Supreme Court, became notable for two reasons: 1) Feltner asserted that Columbia was not the exclusive licensee of the series in question at the time they filed the lawsuit (and therefore lacked standing under the Copyright Act);\"Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., Plaintiff-appellee, v. C. Elvin Feltner, Jr., Defendant-appellant, Krypton Broadcasting of Birmingham, Inc\" Justia.com (July 9, 2001) and 2) following the District Court's decision in favor of Columbia, Feltner appealed the decision, insisting that a jury should decide the amount of the damages assessed instead.Cornell University School of Law \u2013 Legal Information Institute \"Feltner v. Columbia Television Pictures, Inc.\" Eventually, The Supreme Court reversed the District Court's decision, holding that the Seventh Amendment guaranteed Feltner the right to a jury trial \"on all issues pertinent to an award of statutory damages under \u00a7\u00a7 504(c) of the Copyright Act, including the amount itself.\" The decision ultimately backfired on Feltner, however, as the jury awarded damages to Columbia in an amount that was almost four times greater than the initial award. In both cases, it was the largest statutory damages verdict in history.\"Guardrail to Guardrail: Statutory Damage Awards in Copyright Infringement Litigation\" McKinney, R.
