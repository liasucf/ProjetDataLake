Because the wet ground of the marsh made it accessible from only one side, the manor was also known as Za blatom (literally, 'behind the mud', also Zaplata) in Slovene, or Moosthal in German. It was first owned by the Mavri\u010d family, later by the Gallen family, and from 1663 to 1826 by the barons of the Kuschlan family. It was considerably damaged by the 1895 Ljubljana earthquake. ==References== ==External links== * *Podple\u0161ivica on Geopedia Category:Populated places in the Municipality of Brezovica ",
