The final climb is made easy by the iron ladders constructed by the forest department. The local villagers on weekends, erect small shacks on the way to provide tea and snacks for the trekkers. Some villagers provide food and snacks on the fort cave also. The trek route from village Samrad is quite difficult one, it passes over the narrow spur and finally reaches the Trymbak darwaja. The entire fort can be seen by taking a path which moves around the ridge of the fort. A small group of people can make an overnight stay in the cave on the fort. ==Image gallery== Image:Ladder Trail.jpg|The two ladders that have to be crossed to reach the main fort area Image:The Nedhe.jpg|Nedhe (or eye of the needle) Image:Tryambak darwaza.jpg|Tryambak Darwaza - The main entrance to Ratangad fort Image:The way down.jpg|The way down from the Tryambak Darwaza Image:Ratangad entrance.jpg|Another entrance to Ratangad Fort Image:Chor Darwaza.jpg|The remains of a smaller entrance to the fort - the Thieves entrance or Chor Darwaza Image:Amriteshwar_temple.jpg|Amruteshwar temple, Ratangad built in the Hemadpanthi style Click here to see its photosphere Image:Tank.jpg|Vishnutirth Image:Fort sentry.jpg| An old structure at the fort Image:Ratangad nedhe.jpg| Ratangad with Ratangad peak(Khutta) at right Image:Ratangad Flowers.jpg| Strobilanthe callosa\u2014Karavy Image:Ratangad Flowers1.jpg| Impatiens balsamina\u2014Terada Image:Ratangad Flowers2.jpg| Smithia purpurea\u2014Barka Image:Ratangad Flowers3.jpg| Senecio bombayensis---Sonki Image:Ratangad Flowers4.jpg| Walking along eastern ridge ==References== 2\\.
