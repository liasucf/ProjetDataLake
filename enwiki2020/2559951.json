    "text": "And in This Corner\u2026 is the third studio album released by MC/DJ duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince. The album was released in October 1989, reaching #39 on the US Billboard 200 albums chart. The album was not released on Compact Disc in the UK. However, it was available on this format in most of Europe. For the album, the duo took influence from jazz and funk alongside their typical repertoire. They utilized trumpets, saxes, and flutes. Lyrical concepts are fully developed, and set between the comical and crowd concepts. Upon its release, the album was a commercial success as it sold over half a million copies, and was certified Gold by the RIAA. However, compared to the duo's previous work, the album was considered a letdown, only selling half as many copies. Nevertheless, the album received two Grammy Awards nominations including Best Rap Performance for their first single \"I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson\" in 1990 (which lost to Young MC's \"Bust a Move\") and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for the album itself in 1991 (which lost to Quincy Jones, Big Daddy Kane, Ice-T, Kool Moe Dee, Melle Mel & Quincy Jones III's \"Back on the Block\"). == Track listing == # \"Then She Bit Me\" - 3:35 # \"I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson\" - 4:49 # \"Jazzy's Groove\" - 3:43 # \"Everything That Glitters (Ain't Always Gold)\" - 4:17 # \"You Got It (Donut)\" - 4:56 # \"The Girlie Had a Mustache\" - 4:32 # \"The Reverend\" - 4:31 # \"Who Stole My Car?\" - 4:57 # \"The Men of Your Dreams\" - 4:52 # \"Numero Uno\" - 4:08 # \"Too Damn Hype\" - 5:41 # \"Jeff Waz on the Beat Box\" - 5:42 ==Samples== Jazzy's Groove *\"The Champ\" by The Mohawks *\"Funky Drummer\" by James Brown *\"Synthetic Substitution\" by Melvin Bliss *\"Nautilus\" by Bob James *\"Saturday Night Style\" by Mikey Dread *\"Eric B.
