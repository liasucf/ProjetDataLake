Salvador was promoted to the first team ahead of the 2012\u201313 season, and began to appear more regularly in the following campaigns. He scored his first senior goal on 5 January 2014, netting the equalizer in a 1\u20131 home draw against CD Guijuelo. On 31 July 2015, after Zamora's relegation, Salvador joined fellow third-tier club CD Lealtad.

On 28 July 2016 Salvador moved to Sporting de Gij\u00f3n, being initially assigned to the reserves in Tercera Divisi\u00f3n. He made his first team debut on 21 December, coming on as a late substitute for Nacho Cases in a 1\u20133 away loss against SD Eibar for the season's Copa del Rey.
