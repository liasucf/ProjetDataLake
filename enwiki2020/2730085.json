    "text": "Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends is a children's television series about the engines and other characters working on the railways of the Island of Sodor, and is based on The Railway Series books written by the Reverend W. Awdry. This article lists and details episodes from the fifth series of the show, which was first broadcast in 1998. This series is narrated by Michael Angelis for the United Kingdom audiences, while Alec Baldwin narrated the episodes for the United States audiences. In the United States, this season was aired in 1999 on Fox Family. This is the first season of the series that was not aired on PBS. This is the first season which uses digital filming, and the last produced by Britt Alcroft Productions and Brittwood Productions. ==Production== ===Stories=== The show's staff had decided since Series 3 that most of the best stories of The Railway Series had been adapted, the rest involving too many new characters or closely resembling previous stories.http://www.sodor-island.net/steveasquithinterview.html With Series 5, the decision was made to write a full series of original, staff-written stories. One reason for this was producer Britt Allcroft's desire to create a theatrical Thomas the Tank Engine movie, and requested that director David Mitton show off his modelling skills.http://www.sodor- island.net/interviews.html Series 5 aired in 1998, and the movie Thomas and the Magic Railroad was released 2 years later. Some inspiration for the stories came from a former LMR manager named David Maidment. In 1997, Maidment met with Steven Wright about the possibility of supporting the Railway Children charity, and while Wright told him the series' staff commonly received such requests, they would consider. During their meeting, Maidment relayed stories about his railway experiences working in South Wales and as the manager at station. Days later, Maidment received a call asking if he would allow some of his stories to be used as material \u2013 the stories from The Railway Series were frequently based on true events, and Allcroft and Mitton preferred this. Maidment agreed, and was also asked to review each story to make sure that the railway in the show operated realistically. As a result, Maidment received writing credit alongside Allcroft and Mitton. 10,000 pounds ($14,406 in U.S. money) was donated to the Railway Children for his work. These stories are amongst those adapted: * \"A Better View for Gordon\" - the Granville-Paris Express ran through the buffer stop, across the station concourse, and crashed through the station wall; landing in the Place de Rennes below. * \"Baa!\" \u2013 a ram invades a railway station and attacks some vandals; additionally, the idea of a \"Best Kept Station\" competition. * \"James and the Trouble with Trees\" \u2013 rain erodes an embankment, causing a tree to slide down and stand upright on the tracks. * \"Double Teething Troubles\" \u2013 a British Rail Class 17 diesel stalls while banking a train. * \"A Surprise for Percy\" - a runaway in the Garw Valley that occurred during David Maidment's time as Area Manager at Bridgend. * \"Busy Going Backwards\" - a couple of \"hair-raising\" runaway trains in the Tondu valleys that occurred during David Maidment's time as Area Manager in South Wales. * \"Gordon and the Gremlin\" \u2013 bathwater in a luxury coach splashes around the compartment. The design for each new character would be chosen by David Eves, and given to David Mitton for approval. ===Filming=== Mitton shot 2,700 slates for Series 5, the most of any of the series he shot for Thomas. Stock Footage Theme Music From Season 3 and 4. ===Broadcast=== Previously Thomas had only appeared in the US as a segment on the TV show Shining Time Station, but Series 5 aired in the US as part of the half-hour Storytime with Thomas program. Each episode would include a new Series 5 episode, an episode of Britt Allcroft's Magic Adventures of Mumfie, and a Series 4 episode narrated by George Carlin, with music videos and footage of Day out with Thomas in between. ==Episodes== ==Characters== ===Introduced=== * Cranky the Crane (\"Cranky Bugs\") * Horrid Lorries (\"Horrid Lorry\") * Butch the Breakdown Vehicle (\"Cranky Bugs\" / \"Horrid Lorry\" ) * Old Bailey (\"Haunted Henry\") * Derek (\"Double Teething Troubles\" ) * 'Arry and Bert (\"Stepney Gets Lost\" ) * Bertram the Old Warrior (\"Toby's Discovery\" ) * Old Slow Coach (\"Thomas, Percy and Old Slow Coach\") * Tiger Moth (\"Sir Topham Hatt's Holiday\") * Thumper (\"Rusty and the Boulder\" ) * Dowager Hatt (\"Gordon and the Gremlin\" ) ===Recurring character cast=== * Thomas * Edward * Henry * Gordon * James * Percy * Toby * Duck * Donald (music video cameo) * Oliver * Bill and Ben * BoCo * Mavis * Stepney * Skarloey * Rheneas * Peter Sam (does not speak) * Rusty * Duncan * Annie and Clarabel * Henrietta (does not speak) * Toad * Bertie * Terence * Trevor * Harold * George the Steam Roller * Caroline * The Fat Controller * Lady Hatt * Stephen Hatt * Bridget Hatt * Mrs. Kyndley * Jem Cole (cameo) ==References== Category:1998 British television seasons Category:Thomas & Friends seasons ",
