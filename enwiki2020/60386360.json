Her second Japanese single release, \"Ame no Airport\" (Rainy airport), reached the No. 4 position on the Oricon charts and sold nearly 400,000 copies. The song won her the Grand Prize at the 5th Japan Cable Awards. In 1982, Ouyang released \"Love Is Over\" as a single in Japan. It had first been released as the B-side to her single \"Uwasa no Disco Queen\" (Disco Queen rumors), which only sold about 3,000 units. \"Love Is Over\" reached the No. 1 position on the Oricon charts, selling over half a million units. At the 25th edition of the Japan Record Awards, \"Love Is Over\" won her the Long Seller prize. Ouyang appeared three times on K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen.
