    "text": "Simson Shituwa (b. Oukwanyama) was one of the first seven Ovambo pastors, whom the director of the Finnish Missionary Society, Matti Tarkkanen ordained into priesthood in Oniipa, Ovamboland, on 27 September 1925, with a permission granted by the Bishop of Tampere, Jaakko Gummerus.Peltola 1958, p. 212. Shituwa was a local man of great influence in Oukwanyama, and many government officials in South West Africa consulted him on a number of occasions. He seems to have converted into Christianity in Ondjiva, as the result of the missionary work of the German Rhenish Missionary Society. Shituwa was a cripple, but even as such, it was said that he was \u201cstronger than his ancient namesake. This Samson did not have his power in his hair or his muscles, but in his heart, in which God dwelled.\u201dPeltola 1958, p. 195\u2013196. When the Germans had to leave their missions in Angola as the result of World War I, Shituwa moved to South West Africa. From that time on, even before he was ordained, he was one of the pillars of the church in Oukwanyama. Shituwa took care of the western parts of southern Oukwanyama, while Wilhelm Kafita took care of the eastern parts. Apparently they worked on both sides of the international border. The Finnish Missionary Society founded its first mission station, Engela, in this area only in 1921. In 1918 Shituwa met a Roman Catholic missionary in Omafo near the border. The priest had appeared there and wanted to baptize people. Shituwa was hesitant, and when the Catholic father wanted a pound for each person baptized, it was easy for Shituwa to reject the proposal. The father had to move on, empty handed.Peltola 1958, p. 196. In 1921 Shituwa assisted the Finnish missionary August H\u00e4nninen in the founding of the Engela mission station. He showed the place for the mission station a couple of kilometres west of Omafo, on the western bank of an oshana, in a place that was a bit higher than the surrounding landscape.Pentti (ed.) 1958, p. 95. In 1922, Shituwa started his studies in the Oniipa seminary, in the class for theological studies. When he had been ordained, he worked as a pastor in his home area in Endola, which formed a subordinate parish within the Engela parish, 30 km to the south-east of Engela. A church was built there in 1927. The parish register,however, remained in Engela.Peltola 1958, p. 231. In the late 1950s, Shituwa was still alive, and \u201cdespite his advanced age he had remained surprisingly active and still had a burning desire to serve the cause of the Gospel,\u201d wrote Elias Pentti of him in 1958.Pentti (ed.) 1958, p. 114. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:Namibian Lutheran clergy Category:Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Mission ",
