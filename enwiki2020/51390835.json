In 2011, he ran as a DA mayoral candidate for Johannesburg before a panel of 30 people, including party leader and Premier of the Western Cape Helen Zille, but was defeated by Mmusi Maimane. Following Maimane's departure to the National Assembly in 2014, Da Gama was appointed leader of the DA's caucus, a position he had previously held. In August 2016, Da Gama was elected council speaker. He was removed as speaker in December 2019 and replaced with the ANC's Nonceba Molwele. == References == Category:Democratic Alliance (South Africa) politicians Category:Coloured South African people Category:People from Louis Trichardt Category:People from Alexandra, Gauteng Category:People from Johannesburg Category:1959 births Category:Living people ",
