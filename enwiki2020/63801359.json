    "text": "Jelili Atiku is a multimedia performance artist and sculptor from Lagos, Nigeria. His performance with drawing, photography, installation sculpture, video and live performance have made him one of the most recognized performance artists from Nigeria around the world. His work is said to have a power which \"lies in his use of Yoruba symbols and traditions of his local community\" and he has been called \"the father of Nigerian contemporary performance art.\" == Biography == Atiku was born on 27 September 1968 in Ejigbo, a town in Lagos State of Nigeria. He got his Bachelor of Arts degree in fine arts from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in 1998 and a Master of Arts in visual arts from the University of Lagos, Nigeria, in 2006. In 1998, taught fine arts at the Federal Government College, Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom, Nigeria. From 2004 to 2005, he was a graduate assistant lecturer, Department of Visual Arts, University of Lagos. From 2011 to 2013 he was a part\u2010time lecturer of Arts and Industrial Designs Department, Lagos State Polytechnic, Ikorodu, Lagos. In 2018, he became an assistant professor at the Department of Africana Studies/Rite and Reason, Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. == Career == Atiku's work focuses on human rights and social justice issues, which have oftentimes brought him in conflict with agents of state. After a performance in his hometown of Ejigbo on the 18th of January, he was arrested and charged to court. The performance, titled Aragamago Must Rid This Land of Terrorism was motivated by a brutal attack on some three women in Ejigbo which he believed was \"an abomination\" for which the king must perform a public ritual. He was eventually cleared of wrongdoing in the case after pressure was mounted by local and foreign artists and organisations. In 2012, Atiku collaborated with Helene Aurell (Swedish artist), Nigel Wells (UK/Swedish artist) and P\u00e5lGunn\u00e4s (Norwegian artist) at a performance he titled, \u201cIn (ut) Fl\u00f6de\u201d. He also had collaborations with other artists like Graham Martin at Scarborough, York (United Kingdom); and TOGYG, an artists group run by Bangor Greadigol, based in North Wales. In 2015, he won the prestigious Prince Claus Award. In 2017, he was one of the artists representing Nigeria at the Venice Biennale, in Italy. == Notable exhibitions/performances == Ar\u00e1f\u1eb9\u0301rak\u00f9 (2013). This exhibition focused on Atiku's meditation on the loss of a father he never met. The word \"Ar\u00e1f\u1eb9\u0301rak\u00f9\" in Yoruba means \"a part of me is missing.\" The performance took place in an empty space that was covered with wallpaper and a photograph of Atiku's father. \"Alone throughout most of the 44 hours representing an hour for each year of his life, the only person that is allowed\u2014albeit briefly\u2014to share in the moment is his mother, creating a trilogy that is almost transcendental.\" This was followed by a public-facing performance that mimics a Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 burial ceremony \"blurring the boundaries between reality and fiction as an attempt is made to attain a state of closure through the public depiction of a universal emotion\" == Others == * 2020 Nobody Is Born Wise, durational performance (14 Hours) at India Art Fair, NSIC Exhibition Grounds, Okhla Industrial Estate, New Delhi, India (Friday 31 January \u2013 Sunday February 2). * 2020 The Night Has Ears, performance with 64 persons at Martin-Gropius-Bau, Berlin, Germany (Saturday January 18). * 2019 En\u00edtere \u00c8jitere (Iponri I), Performance at Paris Square, Haifa, Israel (Sunday, December 29, 2019). * 2019 E Don Tey Wey We Dey, Performance at 21st Lagos Book and Arts Festival, Freedom Park, Broad Street, Ganiyu Smith Road and Campbell Street, Lagos, Nigeria (Saturday November 9, 2019). * 2019 En\u00edtere \u00c8jitere (Iponri I), Performance at Institute for African and Diaspora Studies, University of Lagos, Nigeria (Wednesday November 6, 2019). * 2019 \u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301m\u1ecdy\u1ecdy\u1ecd, performance with Aweni Kudirat Apata, Barbara M.
