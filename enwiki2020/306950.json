    "text": "San Jos\u00e9 del Monte, officially the City of San Jos\u00e9 del Monte, often called as SJDM or CSJDM (; ), is a first-class component city in the province of Bulacan, Central Luzon. According to the 2007 Census, it has a population of 439,090 people, making it the largest local government unit within the province of Bulacan and Central Luzon and the 18th most populated city in the Philippines. Located in the southeast of the province, it is bordered by the cities of Caloocan and Quez\u00f3n of Metro Manila in the south, by the town of Rodr\u00edguez, Rizal in the east, the towns of Santa Mar\u00eda and Marilao in the west and Norzagaray in the north. The city is home to some of the biggest resettlement areas in the Philippines like the Sapang Palay resettlement area spread over 36 barangays, Pabahay 2000 in Barangay Muzon and Towerville in Barangay Minuyan Proper. Most of the city's population come from former informal settlers along the creeks, esteros, riverbanks and railway tracks of Metro Manila. == History == Early accounts on the founding of the city, as gathered from the old people, contend that it was formerly a part of the town of Meycauayan. This is supported by a decree from the Archbishop of Manila dated March 1750 on the creation of new municipalities. The municipality of San Jose del Monte was then officially founded on 2 March 1752. The decree included the list of families who volunteered to be relocated. These families, most if not all from Lagulo (now Malhacan) in Meycauayan, brought with them rice, wine, nganga and salt from in exchange for the wild pigs, deer, yantok and almasigan of the Itas and Dumagats, the native inhabitants of the area. Solares, including intended lots for main roads, were peacefully distributed to the new occupants after being measured and surveyed. The town reportedly got its name from Saint Joseph whose statue was found in a veritable forest; the hunters called it \u201cSan Jos\u00e9 del Monte\u201d ( \u201cSaint Joseph of the Mountain\u201d). In all probability, the hunters reported their find to the parish priest of Meycauayan. It was said that the priest built a stone church at the site where the town proper is now located. The statue was installed in the new church. Extant Catholic Church records reveal that the first parish priest was Father Antonio de Moral. He took charge of the parish in 1845. During the revolt against Spain, the town became a battleground between the Katipuneros and the Spanish forces. The revolutionaries lost and the vengeful Spanish soldiers burned down the settlement. The town people fled for their lives to nearby towns. At the advent of the American rule, it was made a part of Santa Maria until 1918 when the town was recreated and Ciriaco Gallardo appointed the first municipal president. Public schools were opened at the start of the American regime but due to the scarcity of the population, the highest grade organized was at the fourth grade. During the Japanese occupation, the town became an ideal hiding place of the local recognized guerrillas because of the town's hilly and wooden terrain. The Japanese Imperial Army took over the local government of San Jose del Monte from 1942 to 1943. In resistance, the municipality formed its own guerrilla unit. San Jose del Monte experienced large casualties when the Americans bombed the town center on 11 January 1945 and again on 14 January 1945. When the combined Filipino and American troops came, peace reigned but not for long. At the height of the Hukbalahap Rebellion, the town was raided on October 10, 1950. The Huks burned down the town hall. The town was raided for the second time on 21 March 1951. The Huks did not succeed because of the precautionary measures instituted by the town officials after which the Huks were gradually eliminated. On 10 September, 2000, San Jose del Monte was proclaimed as a Component City under Republic Act No. 8797. It became the first city in the province of Bulac\u00e1n and recorded as the 86th chartered city of the Philippines. On 18 December 2003, the City of San Jos\u00e9 del Monte became the 1st Lone Congressional District in Bulac\u00e1n. == Geography == The elevation of the city ranges from approximately 40\u2013900 meters above sea level; the relief transitions from warm lowland to cool upland as one goes eastward. This is because the city is part of the Sierra Madre mountain range. Plains and river valley flats characterize the western and southwestern quadrant. The central portion and much of its eastern section is made up of undulating hills with low relief. High relief areas moderate slopes best describe its extreme eastern and northwestern quadrant. Slopes of 3%-8% are extensively found in the city, particularly on the western half. Slopes of 30%-50% comprise the smallest portion of the total land area. The rivers and creeks that flow in San Jose del Monte are direct tributaries of Angat River, which flows from the Angat Reservoir. Major natural waterways of San Jose del Monte are the Kipungok, Santo Cristo and Santa Maria river systems. Kipungok River separates San Jose del Monte from Caloocan City and Quezon City. It is directly connected to Marilao River, which flows downwards to Manila bay. Draining to these rivers are creeks and streams, which act as catchment areas for the surface water runoff of the city. Among these are the Bigte, Kantulot, Katinga and Salamin creeks. ===General land use=== Growing commercial, residential, and light industrial areas, are found all over the city at major road intersections and along major thoroughfares. However, the bulk of the San Jose del Monte's built-up areas are mostly west of Quirino Highway at the primary level to gently sloping 8% terrain, dividing the city into a heavily built-up western section and the largely agricultural eastern section. Most of the city's schools, government institutions, commercial developments, industries, and other urban amenities are in this section. The largest contiguous built-up area is at Sapang Palay Resettlement Project area, followed by the conurbation in Tungkong Mangga and Muzon. The developments east of the Quirino Highway are mostly scattered residential areas and agricultural lands. However, there are a few subdivisions that are some distance away from Ciudad Real and take advantage of its secluded and rural atmosphere. These are the Blessed Sacrament Seminary and an Augustinian convent. In between the built-up clusters are pockets of agricultural lands, which are continuously converted into built-up uses. Planted in these lands are crops such as rice and corn. The clustering pattern for both built-up and agricultural uses is partly due to the decisions made by settlers with regard to the hilly conditions that dominate the topography. Most of households in the western half of San Jose del Monte opted to convert their lands to residential uses while other maintained the farms. This left upland uses, such as those pertaining to forest use, more common towards the easternmost zones. Most vegetative outgrowths are in areas that are difficult to build on. But there are instances when these outgrowths are integrated in the built-up areas, usually found in the west: a number of heavily vegetated areas. Supplementing these are mini forest projects of the city government. The City Agriculture Office maintains a 1.65-hectare Mini Forest Project in Barangay Muzon along the San Jose del Monte-Marilao Provincial Road and a mahogany planting site. ===Climate=== ===Barangays=== The city is divided into 59 barangays, which handle governance in a much smaller area. These barangays are grouped into two districts, 23 barangays comprise the first district while 36 compose the second commonly known as Sapang Palay, and the city has Lone District, which is represented by a congressman in the country's House of Representatives. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !No. !Barangay !District !Postal code !Population 01-May-00 !Population 2012 !Population growth rate |- | 1 || Ciudad Real || 1st || 3023 || 1,935 || 3,070 || -7.08% |- | 2 || Dulong Bayan || 1st || 3023 || 5,440 || 8,774 || 34.71% |- | 3 || Francisco Homes-Guijo || 1st || 3023 || 5,242 || 5,635 || 2.71% |- | 4 || Francisco Homes-Mulawin || 1st || 3023 || 9,263 || 11,888 || 15.27% |- | 5 || Francisco Homes-Narra || 1st || 3023 || 5,425 || 7,269 || 36.02% |- | 6 || Francisco Homes-Yakal || 1st || 3023 || 2,875 || 3,903 || 15.79% |- | 7 || Gaya-Gaya || 1st || 3023 || 7,148 || 18,737 || 38.51% |- | 8 || Graceville || 1st || 3023 || 22,671 || 44,514 || 44.10% |- | 9 || Gumaoc - Central || 1st || 3023 || 2,704 || 3,484 || 26.11% |- | 10 || Gumaoc - East || 1st || 3023 || 3,854 || 5,237 || 36.53% |- | 11 || Gumaoc - West || 1st || 3023 || 5,288 || 8,785 || 35.89% |- | 12 || Kaybanban || 1st || 3023 || 1,643 || 2,970 || 47.05% |- | 13 || Kaypian || 1st || 3023 || 18,530 || 30,105 || 41.98% |- | 14 || Maharlika || 1st || 3023 || 2,793 || 3,210 || 11.71% |- | 15 || Muzon || 1st || 3023 || 47,010 || 103,000 || 76.24% |- | 16 || Paradise III || 1st || 3023 || 2,186 || 3,907 || 47.35% |- | 17 || Poblacion || 1st || 3023 || 1,886 || 2,360 || 15.22% |- | 18 || Poblacion I || 1st || 3023 || 2,882 || 4,117 || 38.03% |- | 19 || San Isidro || 1st || 3023 || 1,811 || 3,367 || 27.06% |- | 20 || San Manuel || 1st || 3023 || 8,107 || 14,122 || 27.82% |- | 21 || San Roque || 1st || 3023 || 1,000 || 1,711 || 31.90% |- | 22 || Santo Cristo || 1st || 3023 || 17,840 || 33,400 || 43.88% |- | 23 || Tungkong Mangga || 1st || 3023 || 6,097 || 19,491 || 34.64% |- | 24 || Minuyan I || 2nd || 3024 || 3,079 || 3,807 || 10.72% |- | 25 || Minuyan II || 2nd || 3024 || 4,532 || 6,146 || 4.72% |- | 26 || Minuyan III || 2nd || 3024 || 2,327 || 3,328 || 18.22% |- | 27 || Minuyan IV || 2nd || 3024 || 3,492 || 4,722 || 24.03% |- | 28 || Minuyan V || 2nd || 3024 || 2,535 || 2,724 || 9.75% |- | 29 || Bagong Buhay I || 2nd || 3024 || 5,621 || 6,888 || 20.44% |- | 30 || Bagong Buhay II || 2nd || 3024 || 3,521 || 5,910 || 19.31% |- | 31 || Bagong Buhay III || 2nd || 3024 || 3,903 || 4,757 || 19.83% |- | 32 || San Martin I || 2nd || 3024 || 3,207 || 4,049 || 25.54% |-26 | 33 || San Martin II || 2nd || 3024 || 2,771 || 3,419 || 19.31% |- | 34 || San Martin III || 2nd || 3024 || 2,609 || 3,382 || 13.91% |- | 35 || San Martin IV || 2nd || 3024 || 2,939 || 3,894 || 28.10% |- | 36 || Santa Cruz I || 2nd || 3024 || 2,997 || 2,414 || 7.5% |- | 37 || Santa Cruz II || 2nd || 3024 || 2,798 || 3,744 || 10.51% |- | 38 || Santa Cruz III || 2nd || 3024 || 2,058 || 2,432 || 19.68% |- | 39 || Santa Cruz IV || 2nd || 3024 || 2,623 || 2,706 || 23.83% |- | 40 || Santa Cruz V || 2nd || 3024 || 3,128 || 4,143 || 16.78% |- | 41 || Fatima I || 2nd || 3024 || 2,850 || 3,034 || 9.75% |- | 42 || Fatima II || 2nd || 3024 || 1,785 || 2,116 || 11.82% |- | 43 || Fatima III || 2nd || 3024 || 1,461 || 1,861 || 23.20% |- | 44 || Fatima IV || 2nd || 3024 || 1,837 || 2,294 || 16.93% |- | 45 || Fatima V || 2nd || 3024 || 2,029 || 2,937 || 33.91% |- | 46 || San Pedro || 2nd || 3024 || 12,096 || 14,833 || 13% |- | 47 || Citrus || 2nd || 3024 || 13,066 || 23,970 || 45.75% |- | 48 || San Rafael I || 2nd || 3024 || 6,080 || 9,413 || 28.39% |- | 49 || San Rafael II || 2nd || 3024 || 3,457 || 3,699 || -1.91% |- | 50 || San Rafael III || 2nd || 3024 || 3,112 || 3,248 || -5.49% |- | 51 || San Rafael IV || 2nd || 3024 || 5,308 || 6,695 || 2.60% |- | 52 || San Rafael V || 2nd || 3024 || 2,544 || 3,091 || 9.87% |- | 53 || Assumption || 2nd || 3024 || 3,424 || 4,560 || 14.75% |- | 54 || Lawang Pare || 2nd || 3024 || 3,264 || 4,284 || 28.16% |- | 55 || Santo Ni\u00f1o I || 2nd || 3024 || 2,363 || 3,068 || -1.02% |- | 56 || Santo Ni\u00f1o II || 2nd || 3024 || 2807 || 3,478 || 3.06% |- | 57 || St. Martin de Porres || 2nd || 3024 || 2,050 || 2,775 || 25.46% |- | 58 || Sapang Palay Proper || 2nd|| 3024 || 3,576 || 5,538 || 24.89% |- | 59 || Minuyan Proper || 2nd || 3024 || 4,928 || 26,300 || 344.64% |} Of the 3,102 barangays in Region III, the largest in terms of population size is Muzon in the City of San Jose del Monte, Bulacan with 106,603 people. ==Demographics== In the , the population of San Jose del Monte was people, with a density of . This makes it the largest local government unit in Bulacan province. It is also the largest city in Central Luzon (Region III). With the coming of settlers to San Jose Del Monte, its population increased tremendously. Its population increased dramatically since the 1950s as the population tended to move from rural areas to towns and cities. Its proximity to Manila allowed it to accommodate its spillover population. This is further hastened by the development of nearby Quezon City and the accompanying increase in population and infrastructure. Forced relocation of informal settlers and the lure of government to provide them their own homes allowed the town to continue to grow despite the lack of government facilities then. As such, San Jose del Monte exhibited an increasing percentage share to the provincial population from as low as 2% in 1960 to 9% in 1990 and then to 17% in 2015. The town surpassed the population of Meycauayan in 1980 census and Malolos in the 1990 census, then the largest towns of Bulacan. By 2015, it has more than two times the population of the now second place Santa Maria town (256,454 people in the 2015 Census).
