The attacks took place in Chirang, Sonitpur and Kokrajhar districts on 23 December 2014. They have been attributed to the Songbijit faction of National Democratic Front of Bodoland, also known as NDFB(S). The tribal people are mostly work in tea plantations. Some of them are the descendants of labourers brought to Assam by the British colonial rulers, while others are relatively recent migrants from other parts of India. The NDFB claims to represent the Bodo people, who are native to Assam. It has fought a secessionist war with the government for the establishment of a sovereign Bodoland. Although a number of NDFB militants had agreed to ceasefire and peace talks in the 2000s, the NDFB(S) faction led by I. K. Songbijit has refused to give up their militancy. In May, the government had attributed a similar attack on Muslim migrants to NDFB(S). The December attacks, described as one of the worst massacres in the history of North-East India, led to widespread protests by tribal people. The protests turned violent leading to three more deaths in the hands of the police. The tribal people also killed fourteen Bodos in retaliation. On 26 December, the Government of India declared the launch of Operation All Out to eliminate the Bodo militants and deployed as many as 9,000 soldiers of the Indian Army and the Central Reserve Police Force. == Education == The area is fairly occupied by educational institutions. There is a college for Science, Arts and Commerce streams for higher secondary and degree courses as well. Junior colleges have been recently set up near its vicinity as of 2018. Tutorial homes and coaching centres for clearing entrances are rapidly increasing in number. Compared to Science and Commerce streams, the Arts stream is preferred by the students and is therefore much more heavily populated. This is completely a matter of the students' personal preference and has nothing to do with the facilities available. Contrarily, the Science stream in LOKD College is government funded and well-maintained with labs and has a strong faculty. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Name of Institution !Head of Institution !Address !Type !Medium of Instruction |- |Dhekiajuli Boys High School | |Ward No. 8, Dhekiajuli, Assam |Govt.
