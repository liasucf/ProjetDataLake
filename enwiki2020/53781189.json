    "text": "Invader Zim is an ongoing American comic book series created by Jhonen Vasquez. It is a continuation of the animated television series of the same name that originally aired on Nickelodeon. In February 2015, Oni Press announced that a comic book series based on the show, in collaboration with Jhonen Vasquez and Nickelodeon, was being released as the continuation of the series. Vasquez said about the show: \"I'm always confused when people say how much they miss Invader Zim because the show never stopped running in my head, and then I remember everyone else isn't in my head\". A pre-issue #0 was released on May 23, 2015 as a zine and foreshadow to the comic book series. The first issue was released on July 8, 2015, launching a monthly run that continued until issue #50. On February 11, 2020, it was announced that the monthly Invader Zim comic would end with issue #50, released in March 2020, and a new comic series titled Invader Zim Quarterly would begin April 2020, releasing on a quarterly schedule. However, due to comic publishers halting the release of new issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, this was postponed until June 2020. Additionally, in July 2020, Oni Press will launch a new \"Best of...\" trade paperback collections, which will collect a selection of stories from Oni Press's monthly Invader Zim comic series. ==Issues== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !colspan=6|MONTHLY |- !Issue !Release date !Story !Art !Colors !Summary |- |0 |May 23, 2015 |Jhonen Vasquez Aaron Alexovich Rikki Simons Eric Trueheart |Pencils/typesetting: Aaron Alexovich Inks: Megan Lawton |Rikki Simons |\u201cTruth Shrieker Magazine\u201d Featuring \u201cWhere Is Invader Zim?\u201d by Dib Membrane |- |1 |July 8, 2015 |Jhonen Vasquez |rowspan=5|Pencils: Aaron Alexovich Inks: Megan Lawton |rowspan=2|Simon \"Hutt\" Troussellier |\u201cThe Returnening \u2013 Part 1\u201d Dib discovers Zim has a new evil plan and Zim escapes into space with GIR to complete the plan. |- |2 |August 19, 2015 |Eric Trueheart Jhonen Vasquez |\u201cThe Returnening \u2013 Part 2\u201d Dib tracks Zim down in space to stop him from using the Gargantis Array before it is too late. |- |3 |September 16, 2015 |rowspan=2|Eric Trueheart |Rikki Simons |\u201cStar Donkey\u201d Zim summons the Star Donkey in an attempt to destroy Earth. |- |4 |October 21, 2015 |Mildred Louis |\u201cMunchitronic Deathskrang\u201d The Almighty Tallest send Zim a \"secret weapon\" and Zim has to charge it by completing a series of tasks. |- |5 |November 11, 2015 |Jhonen Vasquez |Cassie Kelly |\u201cThe Humble Bundle of Horrors\u201d Gaz punishes Dib for interrupting her game by forcing him to become a NPC in an alternate universe. |- |6 |January 6, 2016 |colspan=2|K.C.
