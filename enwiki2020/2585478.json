The Yankees will share this ballpark with the Mets for the 1974 and seasons, while Yankee Stadium is being re-furbished. *April 8 \u2013 Hank Aaron hits home run number 715, finally breaking Babe Ruth's lifetime home run record. Two fans run onto the field and congratulate him on the record breaking achievement as Hank moves past second base. *April 10 - The 1973 National League pennant is raised before the home opener in which The New York Mets defeat The St. Louis Cardinals, 3-2 in front of only 17,154 fans at Shea Stadium. Jerry Grote of the Mets homered in that game. *April 14 \u2013 Graig Nettles of the New York Yankees hits four home runs during a doubleheader split against his former team, the Cleveland Indians. The Yankees win 9\u20135, then lose 6\u20139. Nettles will go on to tie a major league record with 11 home runs in the month of April. *April 17 - The Chicago Cubs new catcher George Mitterwald hit three home runs and drove in eight runs as the Cubs slaughter The Pittsburgh Pirates 16-9.

The Braves go on to beat the Cubs, 9-3. *April 30 \u2013 At Fenway Park, Nolan Ryan of the Angels strikes out 19 Red Sox batters in a 4-2 victory.

Only Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron and Willie Mays are ahead of Oh among U.S. players at this time, but he will surpass them all. *June 4 \u2013 The Cleveland Indians attempt an ill-advised ten cent beer promotion for a game against the Texas Rangers at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. Cleveland forfeits 9-0 after alcohol-fueled mayhem and violence spreads from the stands onto the field. *June 5 \u2013 Hank Aaron hits his 16th career grand slam homer as the Braves top the Phillies, 7-3, in Philadelphia. *June 10 \u2013 The Philadelphia Phillies Mike Schmidt hits the ball off the speaker at the Houston Astrodome, turning a sure homer into one of the longest singles hit in a 12-0 Phillies victory over the Houston Astros. *June 11 \u2013 Mel Stottlemyre of the New York Yankees makes his 272nd consecutive start, with no relief appearances, to set an American League record. *June 14- California Angels pitcher Nolan Ryan pitches 13 innings, and strikes out 19 batters, including Red Sox first baseman Cecil Cooper, who alone struck out six straight times. The Angels defeated Boston 4-3 in 15 innings. *June 19 \u2013 George Scott, who walks to lead off the second inning, is the Brewers' only base runner as Steve Busby of the Kansas City Royals hurls a 2\u20130 no-hitter.

The Royals lose, however, 3\u20131 to the Chicago White Sox. ===July\u2013September=== *July 11 \u2013 The San Diego Padres release outfielder Matty Alou.

Younger brother Jes\u00fas keeps the Alou name alive in the majors, playing for the Oakland Athletics. *July 14 \u2013 In a doubleheader with the Brewers, the Rangers' Billy Martin is the first American League manager to be removed by umpires from two games in one day. *July 17: **Bob Gibson of the St. Louis Cardinals strikes out C\u00e9sar Ger\u00f3nimo of the Cincinnati Reds to become the second pitcher to strike out 3,000 batters in the majors. Ger\u00f3nimo will become Nolan Ryan's 3,000th strikeout victim six years later. **Milwaukee third baseman Don Money commits a first-inning error in a 10\u20135 loss to Minnesota, ending his perfect defensive season after 86 games and 257 chances. He will end the season with just five errors, breaking George Kell's record set in 1950. Money also holds the National League record with just 10 errors, set with the Phillies in 1972, and holds both the National League and American League records for most consecutive chances without an error in a season. **Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tommy John, who started the season 13-3, has his season come to an abrupt end when he tears a ligament in his pitching elbow in the Dodgers 5\u20134 loss to the Montreal Expos. *July 19 \u2013 Dick Bosman of the Cleveland Indians no-hits the Oakland Athletics 4\u20130. Bosman has no one but himself to blame for not picking up a rare perfect game. His throwing error in the fourth inning puts the only A's runner (Sal Bando) on base. The two clubs combine to set an American League record with two runners left on base. *July 23 \u2013 The National League triumphs in the All-Star Game at Pittsburgh, winning 7\u20132 over the American League. Steve Garvey is named the MVP. *July 25 \u2013 Carl Yastrzemski hits his 300th career home run helping the Boston Red Sox beat the Detroit Tigers 12-4. *August 6 \u2013 Johnny Bench hits his 200th career home run helping the Cincinnati Reds beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-3. *August 12 \u2013 Nolan Ryan of the California Angels strikes out 19 in a 4-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox. *August 20 \u2013 Davey Lopes sets a Dodgers record when he totals 15 bases against the Cubs in an 18\u20138 drubbing at Wrigley Field.

The Dodgers totaled 48 bases in the game, a team record. *August 27 \u2013 Hal McRae of the Kansas City Royals ties a Major League record with six extra base hits (five doubles and a home run). *September 3 \u2013 In an amazing performance, SF Giants' John Montefusco makes his major league debut, hits a home run in his first official time at bat off Charlie Hough, and pitches nine innings of relief to earn a 9\u20135 victory over the Dodgers. *September 4 \u2013 Pitcher Don Wilson has a no-hitter through eight innings, but is pulled from the game by Houston Astros manager Preston G\u00f3mez. Reliever Mike Cosgrove gives up a leadoff single to Tony P\u00e9rez, and the Astros lose to the Cincinnati Reds, 2\u20131. Gomez made the same mistake in San Diego on July 21, 1970. Clay Kirby had a no-hitter going for eight innings, but with two outs in the 8th and trailing 1\u20130, Gomez lifted him for pinch hitter Cito Gaston. Gaston failed to get a hit, and reliever Jack Baldschun gave up two runs in the 9th. The Padres lost 3\u20130. *September 7 \u2013 During a 3\u20131 win over the Chicago White Sox, Nolan Ryan of the California Angels has a fastball clocked at 100.8 miles per hour (161.28 kilometres per hours) \u2014 the fastest pitch recorded. *September 8 \u2013 Pat Pieper ends 59-year career as public address announcer for the Chicago Cubs. *September 10 \u2013 Cardinal Lou Brock breaks Maury Wills' major league record by stealing his 104th and 105th bases of the season.

The Cardinals, trailing 3-1 with two out in the ninth, tie the score on Ken Reitz' two-run home run off Jerry Koosman, sending the game into extra innings. Two Mets errors lead to the Cardinals' winning run, starting with an errant pickoff throw that allows Bake McBride to scamper all the way around from first. St. Louis wins, 4\u20133. The Mets go to the plate 103 times, the only time the century mark has been reached in a major league game; the Cards are not far behind with 99 plate appearances. All told, a record 175 official at-bats are recorded, with a major-league record 45 runners stranded. Only a thousand fans are on hand when the game ends at 3:13 a.m. *September 12 \u2013 Tigers pitcher John Hiller picks up his 17th victory in relief, an American League record, as he beats the Brewers, 9\u20137. *September 24: **Al Kaline of the Detroit Tigers doubles off Dave McNally for his 3,000th career hit, as the Tigers lose to the Orioles 5\u20134. **Clarence Jones of the Kintetsu Buffaloes hits his 38th home run to become the first foreign player to win a home run title in Nippon Professional Baseball, topping the Pacific League. Sadaharu Oh will lead the Central League with 49 homers. Jones will lead the Pacific League again with 36 HR in 1976. *September 25 \u2013 Dodgers pitcher Tommy John undergoes surgery to repair the ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow. The surgery, performed by Frank Jobe is now named after the pitcher. *September 28: **In his last start of the year, Nolan Ryan of the California Angels pitches his third career no- hitter, victimizing the Minnesota Twins, 4\u20130. In the process, Ryan strikes out 15 batters for the sixth time this season. He also walks eight to run his season total to 202 bases on balls, joining Bob Feller in 1938 as the only pitcher to walk more than 200 in a season. Ryan will set a personal high issuing 204 walks in 1977. **Don Wilson of the Houston Astros throws a 5\u20130, two-hit shutout against the Braves. It would be Wilson's last major league game, followed barely three months later by his accidental death. ===October\u2013December=== *October 3 \u2013 Frank Robinson becomes the first black manager in major league history, as the Cleveland Indians name him to replace Ken Aspromonte for the 1975 season. *October 17 \u2013 At the Oakland Coliseum, the Oakland Athletics win the World Series over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game Five, clinching a third straight World Championship.

Aaron wins 10\u20139. *November 20 \u2013 Texas Rangers right fielder Jeff Burroughs, who batted .301 with 25 home runs and a league- leading 118 RBI, wins the American League MVP Award. Oakland teammates Joe Rudi, Sal Bando and Reggie Jackson are the runners-up. *November 25 \u2013 Texas Rangers first baseman Mike Hargrove, who hit .323 with 66 RBI and a .395 OBP, is voted American League Rookie of the Year with 16 of 23 first place votes, with the others going to Bucky Dent (3), George Brett (2), Rick Burleson (1) and Jim Sundberg (1). *November 27: **St. Louis Cardinals CF Bake McBride, who hit .309 with six home runs and 56 RBI, wins the National League Rookie of the Year Award over Houston Astros RF Greg Gross (.314, 21 2B, 36 RBI) and Chicago Cubs 3B Bill Madlock (.313, 9 HR, 54 RBI). **Commissioner Bowie Kuhn suspends New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner for two years as a result of Steinbrenner's conviction for illegal campaign contributions to Richard Nixon and other politicians. *December 2 \u2013 The Boston Red Sox trade speedy outfielder Tommy Harper to the California Angels for infielder Bob Heise. *December 3 \u2013 The New York Mets trade ace reliever and Shea Stadium favorite Tug McGraw to the Philadelphia Phillies along with Don Hahn and Dave Schneck. New York receives outfielder Del Unser, pitcher Mac Scarce and catcher John Stearns, whom the Phillies had drafted #2 overall in the 1973 Major League Baseball draft. *December 26 \u2013 The Little League is officially opened to girls as President Gerald Ford signs legislation amending the charter of the organization.
