The courthouse sits on a stone foundation. Arched windows and doorways with brown sandstone sills lend distinction. The eaves were built with unusual corbelled brick and the corners of the tower are decorated with tourelles. Hardwood floors and oak balusters lead to the second-floor courtrooms. Charles Skoglund built the building in 1894 for $7,200. It was designed by architects Buechner and Jacobson. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Kanabec County, Minnesota Category:County courthouses in Minnesota Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Government buildings completed in 1894 Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Kanabec County, Minnesota ",
