He had his career breakthrough in FTV's 2011 series Rookies' Diary, which received high ratings. The production costs for the series was said to be up to two million TWD, and it also received strong support from the Ministry of Justice. Due to the high expectations, each cast member received training in taekwondo, kendo, and self-defense before shooting began in July. During filming, they were always exposed to the sun, causing sunburn and peeling, and did not wear any make up. Despite the heat, they made an effort to do comedy-style acting; Yao said that there was a lot of nonsense humor and they also did improvisation. Two years after Rookies' Diary, he starred opposite Cheryl Yang in Big Red Riding Hood. Screenwriter Su Limei (\u8607\u9e97\u5a9a) asked him to cut his hair similar to her favorite character in the Japanese manga Musashi no Ken, which would make him look more humorous. In 2013, Yao starred in five television series, in four of which he portrayed \"rich, handsome men\".Translated from the Chinese language: \u96d6\u7136\u90fd\u662f\u6f14\u9ad8\u5bcc\u5e25\uff0c\u4f46\u6bcf\u90e8\u6232\u90fd\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u8a6e\u91cb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u66f4\u80fd\u8b93\u81ea\u5df1\u63e3\u6469\u4e0d\u4e00\u6a23\u7684\u6f14\u51fa\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002 For the Deja Vu TV series with Mandy Wei, both Hao and Wei trained in ballet for their roles. For Three Exits To Love, he once again needed to learn basic dancing with an instructor. He said that the biggest challenge in his 2014 Lion Dancing film was performing the lion dance. ==Personal life== Yao enjoys skateboarding, surfing, and extreme sports. He usually joins race marathons, including a 42-km marathon during the 'Tokyo Marathon' in February 2013; he was a sports brand ambassador at that time. He also entered the 2013 Taiwan International Surfing Competition. He was the first Taiwanese artist to compete and finish the competition despite spraining his legs during the run. ==Philanthropy== In December 2011, he became the ambassador for the Independent Department of Justice held at the '1209 International Anti-Corruption Day', calling people together for the anti-corruption efforts to improve Taiwan. He also became a charity ambassador in Taiwan township schools, promoting traditional Chinese culture to children. In 2015 he volunteered to sell chocolates to raise money for young kids who have brain tumors. ==Filmography== ===Television series=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\" !Year !!English Title !!Original title !!Character/Role |- |1999|| ||\u5f37\u76dc\u8207\u5929\u4f7f\uff0d\u5433\u5ff5\u771f||??? |- |rowspan=2|2002||Toast Boy's Kiss II The Ability of Love ||\u5410\u53f8\u7537\u4e4b\u543b\u2161\u611b\u60c5\u672c\u4e8b|| Lin Yuanhao |- | Sweet Lemon||\u751c\u6ab8\u6aac\u4e4b\u6200||Hao Hao |- |2003|| ||\u719f\u5973\u617e\u671b\u65e5\u8a18 ||\u674e\u7dad |- |rowspan=2|2004 || ||\u8001\u5a46\u5927\u4eba ||\u4e09\u5f1f\uff0d\u8d99\u5927\u5f37 |- | ||\u5a46\u5ab3\u904e\u62db\u5343\u767e\u56de || Haotian (cameo) |- |2005||Qingchun da zhen||\u9752\u6625\u9054\u9663||He Shijie (\u4f55\u4e16\u5091) |- |2006|| ||\u827e\u66fc\u7d10\u8981\u600e\u6a23||Jason (cameo) |- |rowspan=3|2007||Love Queen||\u6200\u611b\u5973\u738b||Rayman (cameo) |- | The Sun's Daughter||\u592a\u967d\u7684\u5973\u5152||Zhang Junwei |- |Just Give Me a Call||\u9ebb\u96c0\u611b\u4e0a\u9cf3\u51f0||Larry |- |rowspan=2|2008||Love Catcher||\u5e78\u798f\u6355\u624b||Guang Qun (\u5149\u7fa4) |- |Your Home is My Home ||\u6b61\u559c\u4f86\u9017\u9663||George (cameo) |- |2009||PTV's Bolang ||\u640f\u6d6a||He Haoyang (\u4f55\u6d69\u967d) |- |2010 ||Rookies' Diary ||\u65b0\u5175\u65e5\u8a18 || Sun An Bang (\u5b6b\u5b89\u90a6) |- |2011 || Justice Heroes ||\u5ec9\u653f\u82f1\u96c4 ||\u59da\u9806\u98a8 |- |2012 ||Mulan On The RunBegan filming in 2009.||\u6728\u862d\u82b1||Jiang Jie (\u6c5f\u6770) |- |rowspan=5|2013 ||Big Red Riding Hood||\u5927\u7d05\u5e3d\u8207\u5c0f\u91ce\u72fc||An De Feng (\u5b89\u5fb7\u98a8) |- |Flowers in Fog||\u82b1\u975e\u82b1\u96fe\u975e\u96fe||Geng Ruo Chen |- |The Diamond's Dream||\u4e00\u514b\u62c9\u68a6\u60f3||Zhou Xuan (\u5468\u65cb) |- |Deja Vu||\u56de\u5230\u611b\u4ee5\u524d||Lu Xi Wei (\u9678\u5e0c\u552f) |- |Three Exits To Love||\u5e78\u798f\u8857\u7b2c3\u865f\u51fa\u53e3||Xu Li Yang |- |2015||Youth Power||\u54c7\uff01\u9673\u6021\u541b||Jiang Ye Qing (\u6c5f\u4e5f\u6674) |- |} ===Films=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\" !Year !!English Title !!Original title !!Character/Role |- |1999|| Darkness and Light||\u9ed1\u6697\u4e4b\u5149|| |- |2000|| ||\u6674\u5929\u5a03\u5a03 || |- |2002||The Best of Times || \u7f8e\u9e97\u6642\u5149|| |- |2009|| Strike Out||\u4e09\u632f || |- |2014||Lion Dancing ||\u9435\u7345\u7389\u73b2\u74cf ||Lin Shangzhi (\u6797\u5c1a\u667a) |- |} ===Television hosting=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\" !Year !!Network !!Title |- | || ||\u5b57\u8ecd\u6771\u5f81 |- | ||CTV ||\u559c\u5f9e\u5929\u964d |- |2003||EBC || \u98df\u5168\u98df\u7f8e |- |2004||STV||\u5a1b\u6a02\u661f\u65b0\u805e |- |2005||CTV ||MIT\u53f0\u7063\u8a8c (Make In Taiwan) |- |2007||FTV||\u6c7a\u6230\u885d\u6d6a\u52dd\u5730 |- |2010||FTV||Rookies' Show (\u65b0\u5175\u9032\u884c\u66f2) |- |rowspan=3|2014||CTV||Show Winner (\u842c\u79c0\u5927\u52dd\u5229) |- |PTV||Love Travel & Life (\u5143\u5473\u597d\u751f\u6d3b) |- |TVB||Feastival a la Stars (\u660e\u661f\u611b\u5eda\u623f) |- |} ===Music video appearances=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\" |- !Year !!Title !!
