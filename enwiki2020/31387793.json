    "text": "Pirate studies is an interdisciplinary field of academic study typically using historical and literary techniques to understand piracy and its cultural connotations.Jowitt, C., (2003) 'Parrots and pieces of eight': recent trends in pirate studies. Literature Compass, 1, pp. 18-37. Vol. 1 C.R. Pennell in Who Needs Pirate Heroes? documents the evolution of Pirate Studies. He argues that the first academic historians using properly historical techniques such as archival sources began to examine piracy around the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In this context Penell mentions two works: Stanley Lane-Poole's The Barbary Corsairs (1890) and C.H. Haring's Buccaneers in the West Indies in the Seventeenth Century (1910). But the growth and respectability of the academic study was significantly aided by the work of Professor John Bromley, the British maritime historian. A collection of this work was published as J.S. Bromley, Corsairs and Navies, 1660\u20131760 (1987). By the end of 1990s much of the work in Pirate studies, Pennell notes, could be grouped under three headings: the economics of piracy, the political and ideological importance of piracy, and women pirates.http://www.cnrs- scrn.org/northern_mariner/vol08/nm_8_2_61-79.pdf Pennell, C.R. (1998) Who Needs Pirate Heroes? The Northern Mariner Vol. 8 No. 2 61-79 Canadian Nautical Research Society ==Economics of piracy== Key sources on the economics of piracy, documented by Pennell (1998) include the following. An early study by Cyrus Karraker ((1953) Piracy was a Business) where Karraker discusses pirates in terms of contemporary racketeering. Patrick Crowhurst who documented French piracy and David Starkey who discussed British 18th century piracy. === Piracy and Entrepreneurship === Recent research ventures embarked on links between entrepreneurship and piracy. In this context, the claim is made for a nonmoral approach to piracy as a source of inspiration for entrepreneurship research in generalRoth, S.

Rosenthal reports that Pirate studies have been found \"to be unsystematic or even anti-systematic\". In Pirate studies the Pirates \"stumble across genres and straddle multiple ideological possibilities\", they lack \"stable meaning, but suggest different possibilities at different moments\".Rosenthal, Laura (2011) Pirate Studies and the End of the Humanities, The Long Eighteenth: For anyone interested in the long 18th century ==Key sources== * Bromley, John S.
