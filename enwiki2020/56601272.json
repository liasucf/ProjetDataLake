    "text": "Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress is a 2018 book written by Canadian-American cognitive scientist Steven Pinker. It argues that the Enlightenment values of reason, science, and humanism have brought progress; shows our progress with data that health, prosperity, safety, peace, and happiness have tended to rise worldwide; and explains the cognitive science of why this progress should be appreciated. It is a follow- up to Pinker's 2011 book, The Better Angels of Our Nature. ==Thesis== A commonly-held lay public perception holds that the world is in terrible shape; for some, 2016 was the \"worst year ever\" and the death of liberalism. In contrast, Pinker argues that life has been getting better for most people. He sets out 15 different measures of human wellbeing to support this argument, with the most obvious being the uncontroversial fact that, statistically, people live longer and healthier lives on average than ever before. As another example, while fears of terrorism are often voiced in U.S. opinion polls, Pinker shows that an American is 3,000 times more likely to die in an accident than in a terrorist attack. As in Pinker's previous The Better Angels of Our Nature, Pinker ascribes modern improvements to trends of liberal humanism and scientific rationality that first took root in Europe around the 17th and 18th centuries. Pinker argues that economic inequality \"is not itself a dimension of human wellbeing\" and cites a study that finds inequality is not linked to unhappiness, at least in poorer societies. He also points out that the world as a whole is becoming more equal, and states that even within increasingly unequal areas, the poor are still getting wealth and benefit from technological innovations. For example, it is clear to Pinker that an innovation that makes the poor slightly richer and the rich massively richer is a positive rather than a negative achievement. In contrast, critics hold that enhancing social mobility and combating \"inequality as a result of unfairness\" are important legitimate ends in and of themselves, beyond any effects of reducing poverty. On topics such as nuclear weaponry, Pinker places the blame on anti-Enlightenment forces. Scientists working on the Manhattan Project to develop the first nuclear weapons did so because they needed to beat Hitler; Pinker states \"Quite possibly, had there been no Nazis, there would be no nukes.\" In contrast, critics point out that science lacks any ethical logic of its own. They argue that scientific progress is liberating but also threatening, and can present dangers precisely because of how hugely it expands human power. Pinker expresses concerns about potential human extinction from nuclear weapons or from global warming, but categorizes existential risks overall as a \"useless category\", stating that \"Sowing fear about hypothetical disasters, far from safeguarding the future of humanity, can endanger it\". In particular, Pinker departs from scholars such as Nick Bostrom regarding the possibility of accidental existential risk from artificial general intelligence, and makes a controversial reductio ad absurdum argument that self-driving cars provide evidence that artificial general intelligence will pose no accidental existential risk. The book concludes with three chapters defending what Pinker sees as Enlightenment values: reason, science, and humanism.Can Science Justify Itself? Ada Palmer. Harvard Magazine, March\u2013April 2018. Pinker argues that these values are under threat from modern trends such as religious fundamentalism, political correctness, and postmodernism.ENLIGHTENMENT NOW: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress. (2017). Kirkus Reviews, 85(24), 1. In an interview about the book published in Scientific American, Pinker has clarified that his book is not merely an expression of hope\u2014it is a documentation of how much we have gained as a result of Enlightenment values, and how much we have to lose if those values are abandoned.The Secret behind One of the Greatest Success Stories in All of History. Gareth Cook. Scientific American, February 15, 2018. ==Marketing== In January 2018 Bill Gates tweeted praise for Enlightenment Now, calling it \"my new favorite book\". Gates stated he agreed overall with the techno-optimism of the book, but cautioned that Pinker is too \"quick to dismiss\" the idea that artificial superintelligence could someday lead to human extinction. Citing reader interest due to Gates' endorsement, Viking Press moved the publication date from 27 February 2018 to 13 February 2018. ==Reception== Publishers Weekly gave the book a glowing review, concluding that \"In an era of increasingly 'dystopian rhetoric,' Pinker\u2019s sober, lucid, and meticulously researched vision of human progress is heartening and important.\"\"Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress\". (2018). Publishers Weekly, (51). 157. The Times also gave the book a positive review, stating that Pinker's arguments and evidence are \"as entertaining as they are important\", and expressing hope that Pinker's defense of the forces that have produced progress will be successful.Aaronovitch, David. \"Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker \u2014 don\u2019t believe the false doom-mongers\". The Times, February 17, 2018. The New York Times described the book as \"an excellent book, lucidly written, timely, rich in data and eloquent in its championing of a rational humanism that is \u2014 it turns out \u2014 really quite cool.\" The Economist agreed with Pinker that \"barring a cataclysmic asteroid strike or nuclear war, it is likely that (the world) will continue to get better\". In Skeptical Inquirer Kendrick Frazier concurs that Pinker \"argues [his] case eloquently and ... effectively, drawing on both the demographic data and our improved understanding of human biases that get in our way of seeing the truth.\" Kirkus Reviews called it \"overstuffed\", and noted though Pinker is progressive, \"the academically orthodox will find him an apostate\". The Guardian and The Financial Times dismissed Pinker's contention that the left is partly to blame for anti-reason rhetoric and objected to Pinker's criticism of groups such as postmodernists, de-growth environmentalists, and people whom Pinker deems to be \"social justice warriors\". British philosopher John Gray criticized Pinker as promoting scientism and discussed historical examples of strong desire for human progress leading to the misuse of science for immoral policies. Gray also argued that Pinker had misunderstood Friedrich Nietzsche. Some reviewers disagreed with Pinker's quantitative approach to assessing progress. Booklist stated that \"(Pinker's) seemingly casual dismissal of ethics concerns surrounding the Tuskegee experiment is troubling to say the least.\"Mondor, C. (2018). Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress. Booklist, (9-10). 20. Pinker had written that the Tuskegee experiment \"was patently unethical by today\u2019s standards, though it\u2019s often misreported to pile up the indictment,\" and when properly reported, \"when the study began, it may even have been defensible by the standards of the day.\" In Nature, Ian Goldin wrote that Pinker should have focused more on future risks, although Pinker did devote a chapter to existential threats, and concludes with \"But for the many overwhelmed by gloom, it is a welcome antidote.\" A review in the London Evening Standard agrees with Pinker's summary of how rationality has improved the world, and state \"On Islamism, where his optimism falters, we have the interesting phenomenon of Muslim youth \u2014 not least in countries like Afghanistan \u2014 becoming less liberal than their parents\"McDonagh, Melanie. \"Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker - review: 'The human condition is a little more complex than Mr Cheerful makes out'\" Evening Standard, February 15, 2018. although they do not provide a source for this claim. Writing in the democratic socialist Jacobin, Landon Frim and Harrison Fluss posit that Pinker's Enlightenment \"is shorn of its most egalitarian and democratic elements \u2014 it no longer resembles the intellectual ferment of the French Revolution. Instead, Pinker\u2019s 'Enlightenment' mimics the hierarchy, conservatism, and authoritarianism of the ancien r\u00e9gime \u2014 that historical enemy of Radical Enlightenment.\" In Quillette, the behavioral geneticist Saloni Dattani writes that the book's critics \"are eager to flaunt their aversion to the very values Pinker sets out to defend \u2013 reason, science, humanism, and progress \u2013 and that their critiques display the traits and tics of exactly the kind of counter-Enlightenment thinking he attacks,\" and summarizes the book's case as \"a refutation of the arguments of the counter- Enlightenment which, it turns out, have been wrong all along.\" In the Los Angeles Review of Books, Stanford University historian Jessica Riskin summarizes the book as \"a knot of Orwellian contradictions\". She states that Pinker believes that skepticism is a negative influence on society, and objects that the very Enlightenment heroes Pinker praises, such as Immanuel Kant, David Hume, Denis Diderot and Adam Smith, were all advocates of skepticism. She concludes, \"What we need in this time of political, environmental, and cultural crisis is precisely the value Pinker rejects but that his Enlightenment heroes embraced, whatever their differences of opinion on other matters: skepticism, and an attendant spirit of informed criticism.\" ==References== ==External links== *Enlightenment Now on stevenpinker.com Category:Works by Steven Pinker Category:2018 non-fiction books Category:English-language books ",
