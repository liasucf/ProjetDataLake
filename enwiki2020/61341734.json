Newton was a 26-year-old father of two who had served as a Border Patrol agent for a year, and Azrak was a 22-year-old trainee. They were the 46th and 47th Border Patrol agents to die in the line of duty in the history of the USBP. The 45th casualty dated back to 1952. The two criminals in the first car were arrested in Los Angeles on July 16, 1967, and convicted and sentenced to life in prison. The two men in the second car were arrested in Sonora, Mexico, and given thirty-year sentences for second-degree murder.
