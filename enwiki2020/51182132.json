He made his team debut as well as Albanian Superliga debut on 2 October in the 3\u20132 away win over Teuta Durr\u00ebs. On 27 December, following the end of the first part of the season, Zguro was released from his contract, ending his cooperation with the club, becoming a free agent in the process. ===Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr=== Within a day after his release, Zguro joined fellow Albanian Superliga side Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr on a free transfer.

After penning the contract, he then flew out to Antalya, Turkey to link up with the rest of the squad on their winter training camp.

Zguro made his first Kamza appearance on 26 January in the home match versus La\u00e7i, receiving a yellow card in 49th minute as the team won 3\u20131. He scored his maiden goal for the club, also his first in two years, on 14 April in the 3\u20132 loss to Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb, netting the temporarily equalizer with a free kick. Zguro played 16 times in the second part of 2017\u201318 season, as Kazma narrowly escaped relegation by winning in the final match versus Partizani Tirana. ===Kuk\u00ebsi=== On 17 June 2018, Kuk\u00ebsi announced to have signed Zguro on a one-year contract, with the defender taking squad number 8. ===Chattanooga Red Wolves=== On 2 January 2019, Zguro joined USL League One side Chattanooga Red Wolves ahead of their inaugural 2019 season. ===FC Tulsa=== On 23 December 2019, Zguro moved up to the USL Championship, joining FC Tulsa ahead of their 2020 season. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Pogradeci |2011\u201312 |rowspan=\"4\"|Albanian First Division |?||?||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0 |- |2012\u201313 |27||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||27||2 |- |2013\u201314 |25||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||2 |- |2014\u201315 |4||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !56!!4!!2!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!58!!4 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Butrinti Sarand\u00eb |2014\u201315 |rowspan=\"1\"|Albanian First Division |9||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9||2 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Pogradeci |2015\u201316 |rowspan=\"1\"|Albanian First Division |20||3||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||21||3 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Korabi Peshkopi |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"1\"|Albanian Superliga |10||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||11||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"2\"|Albanian Superliga |15||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||15||0 |- |2017\u201318 |10||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||11||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !25!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!26!!0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Kamza |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"1\"|Albanian Superliga |16||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||1 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Kuk\u00ebsi |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1\"|Albanian Superliga |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !136!!10!!5!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!141!!10 |} ==References== ==External links== * * FSHF profile * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from Pogradec Category:People from Kor\u00e7\u00eb County Category:Association football midfielders Category:Albanian footballers Category:KS Pogradeci players Category:KF Butrinti players Category:KF Korabi Peshkopi players Category:Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr players Category:FC Kamza players Category:FK Kuk\u00ebsi players Category:Chattanooga Red Wolves SC players Category:FC Tulsa players Category:Albanian Superliga players Category:Albanian First Division players Category:USL League One players Category:Albanian expatriate footballers Category:Albanian expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States ",
