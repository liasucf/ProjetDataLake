According to tradition, while he was serving as Vizier to caliph Al-Walid I, he was falsely accused of treachery and his hand was cut off.Three Handed Virgin Icon at CatholicMax.com The accusation was, allegedly, made by Byzantine Iconoclast emperor Leo the Isaurian, who was indeed a great opponent of St John, and friend of Al-Walid I. Upon praying in front of an icon of the Theotokos, allegedly, his hand was miraculously restored. In thanksgiving, he had a silver replica of his hand fashioned and attached it to the icon. After this, the icon became known as \"three-handed\" (Tricherousa), because it had three hands (two of Theotokos plus one more). John Damascene became a monk at Mar Sabbas monastery outside of Jerusalem and gave the icon to the monastic community there. Later the icon was given as a present to St. Sava when he visited the monastery, together with another icon of Theothokos in the style of Nursing Madonna, and with the crosier of Sabbas the Sanctified, the founder of the monastery. Sava brought the icon to Hilandar monastery where he lived. It remained there until 1347 when it was taken by Du\u0161an of Serbia during his visit to Hilandar and brought with him to Serbia. At the end of the 14th century, the icon was in the possession of the Studenica monastery. In the early 15th century, Trojeru\u010dica was back in Hilandar. Until very recently the icon was formally the abbot of Hilandar, with monks elected to serve as its deputy.Hilandar Research Library: \"Hilandar 800&20\" - Exhibit Catalog , 1998 This icon has two feast days: and . Art historians think the style of the icon is more likely from the 14th century, and that it may be a copy or re-painting of an earlier prototype. Another version brought to Moscow in 1661 became famous, and resulted in many Russian copies.Ikon Copies: MOTHER OF GOD THREE HANDED Slava Gallery, LLC: Online Catalog == Gallery == File:Troeruchitsa_(Ferapontov).jpg|Trojeru\u010dica copy, 19 century, Ferapontov Monastery, Vologda region, Russia File:Three_Handed_Virgin_of_Troyan_Monastery.JPG|Trojeru\u010dica copy, Troyan Monastery, Bulgaria File:\u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0430_\u0422\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0430_\u0432\u043e_\u041b\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e.jpg|Trojeru\u010dica, Lesnovo monastery, North Macedonia File:Grgeteg_monastery_12.jpg|The third made copy of the original icon from the Hilandar, Grgeteg Monastery, Vojvodina province, Serbia File:Crkva Sv.
