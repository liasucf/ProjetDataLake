Its independent existence has its origins in the frontier nature of the dukedom in Merovingian Gaul. In this position, influenced and affected by several different cultures on different sides, the Proven\u00e7als maintained a unity which was reinforced when it was created a separate kingdom in the Carolingian decline of the later ninth century. Provence was eventually joined to the other Burgundian kingdom, but it remained ruled by its own powerful, and largely independent, counts. In the eleventh century, Provence became disputed between the traditional line and the counts of Toulouse, who claimed the title of \"Margrave of Provence\". In the High Middle Ages, the title of Count of Provence belonged to local families of Frankish origin, to the House of Barcelona, to the House of Anjou and to a cadet branch of the House of Valois. After 1032, the county was part of the Holy Roman Empire. It was inherited by King Louis XI of France in 1481, and definitively incorporated into the French royal domain by his son Charles VIII in 1484. ==Merovingian dukes and patricians== During the period of the Merovingian dynasty in Gaul, Provence was a province ruled by duces (dukes), military leaders and district commanders who served as defenders of the frontiers of the kingdom and ruled over vast territories as opposed to the comites (counts), who ruled the cities and their environs. Provence was usually a part of the division of the Frankish realm known as the Kingdom of Burgundy, which was treated as its own kingdom. Their title sometimes appears as rector Provinciae. This is an incomplete list of the known Merovingian-appointed dukes of Provence. *Gondulf (fl. c. 491) *Liberius (until 534), Ostrogothic appointee *Namatius (bef. 552), Frankish appointee *Bodegisel (fl. c. 566) *Adovarius (561\u2013569) *Lupus (569\u2013570) *Jovin (570\u2013573) *Albin (573\u2013575) *Dinamius (from 575) *Leudegisel (fl. c. 585), of Burgundian Provence *Nicetas (from 587) *Babo (fl. c. 600) *Aegyla (fl. c. 602) *Bado (634\u2013641) *Willibad (641\u2013643), of Burgundian Provence *Hector (fl. c. 679) *Nemfidius (fl. c. 700) *Antenor (fl. c. 697) *Metrannus (fl. c. 700) *Maurontus (c. 720 \u2013 739) *Abbo (fl. c. 739) ==Carolingian dukes and margraves== Provence was ruled by a poorly known series of dukes during the period of general Carolingian unity until the Treaty of Verdun (843). *Leibulf (until c. 829) *Guerin (c. 829 \u2013 845) *Fulcrad (845 \u2013 c. 860) ==Carolingian kings== After the division of the Carolingian Empire by the Treaty of Verdun (843), the first of the fraternal rulers of the three kingdoms to die was Lothair I, who divided his middle kingdom in accordance with the custom of the Franks between his three sons. Out of this division came the Kingdom of Provence, given to Lothair's youngest son, Charles. A heritage of royal rule was thus inaugurated in Provence that, though it was often subsumed into one of its larger neighbouring kingdoms, it was just as often proclaiming its own sovereigns. The kingdom of Provence was also known as Lower Burgundy (or Cisjurane Burgundy). Its capital was first Vienne then Arles and it is therefore sometimes known as Arelate. *Charles (855\u2013863) :Provence divided between surviving brothers, Lothair II and the Emperor Louis II. The bulk goes to Louis. *Louis II (863\u2013875), also Holy Roman Emperor from 855 :As with his Kingdom of Italy, Louis's Provence goes to his uncle on his death. *Charles the Bald (875\u2013877), also Holy Roman Emperor from 875 *Louis the Stammerer (877\u2013879) :With the death of Louis, Charles' successor, Provence refused to elect his two sons and instead elected one of their own as king. Boso married Ermengard, daughter of Louis II, to strengthen his and his son's claim. *Boso (879\u2013887) *Louis the Blind (887\u2013928), also Holy Roman Emperor from 901 to 905 :Louis's kingdom did not pass to his heirs, but instead to his brother-in-law, the husband of his sister, Hugh, who had acted as his regent since 905. Hugh never used the royal title in Provence. *Hugh (911\u2013933) :In 933, Provence ceases to be a separate kingdom as Hugh exchanged it with Rudolph II of Upper Burgundy for the Iron Crown of Lombardy, that is, rule of Italy. ==Counts and Margraves, within the Empire== In the aftermath of the death of Louis the Blind that Provence began to be ruled by local counts placed under the authority of a margrave. Firstly, Hugh of Arles served as duke and regent during Louis' long blindness. Secondly, Hugh gave the march of Vienne and duchy of Provence to Rudolf II of Burgundy in a treaty of 933. Rudolf was never recognised by the nobles of the country and appointed Hugh, Duke of Burgundy, its first margrave. At the time, the premier counts in the region were the counts of Arles and those of Avignon. Those who would first bear the title comes Provinciae or \"count of Provence\" descended from one Rotbold of Arles. William I and Rotbold I did not divide their father's domains and this indivisibility was maintained by their respective descendants. It is thus impossible to ascertain who succeeded whom in the county as various reigns overlap. By his marriage to Emma of Provence, daughter of Rotbold II, William III, Count of Toulouse inherited lands and castles in Provence. Emma inherited the title Margrave of Provence on her elder brother's death in 1037. Her son Pons by William III did not survive her, but her grandson did and claimed her title in opposition to the younger line of counts of Provence. ===Bosonid dynasty=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\" ! !

They coveted the region between the C\u00e9vennes and the Rh\u00f4ne, then under the control of Toulouse. In 1112, the count of Barcelona, Ramon Berenguer III, married the heiress of Provence, Douce, who was the daughter of the Countess Gerberga of Provence, G\u00e9vaudan, Carladais, and part of Rodez. The marriage was probably taken at the urging of the church, which was then in conflict with house of Toulouse. In 1076, Count Raymond IV was excommunicated, but he still lent his support to Aicard, the deposed archbishop of Arles (since 1080). With the count away on the First Crusade, the church took the opportunity to seize the balance of power in the region. This marriage effectively put Provence under Catalan control. To accommodate the longstanding claims of the count of Toulouse, in 1125, Raymond's heir, Alfonso Jordan, signed a treaty whereby his family's traditional claim to the title of \"Margrave of Provence\" was recognised and the march of Provence was defined as the region north of the lower Durance and on the right of the Rh\u00f4ne, including the castles of Beaucaire, Vallabr\u00e8gues, and Argence. The region between the Durance, the Rh\u00f4ne, the Alps, and the sea was that of the county and belonged to the house of Barcelona. Avignon, Pont de Sorgues, Caumont and Le Thor remained undivided. Internally, Provence was racked by uncertainties over rights of succession. Douce and Ramon Berenguer signed all charters jointly until her death in 1127, after which he alone appears as count in all charters until his death in 1131. At that time, Douce's younger sister, Stephanie was married to Raymond of Baux, who promptly laid claim to the inheritance of her mother, even though Provence had peacefully passed into the hands of her nephew, Berenguer Ramon I. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\" ! !
