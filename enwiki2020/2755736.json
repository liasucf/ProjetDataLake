Until April 2015, he was a Fellow at the Centre for Policy Development.Statement on resignation from CPD and alternative: public statement by Mark Bahnisch, Eva Cox and John Quiggin, (24 April 2015), The New Social Democrat accessed 24 April 2015 He was an opinion columnist for the Australian Financial Review from 1996 until March 2012. As of 2015, Quiggin opposed Bitcoin, calling it a \"delusion\" that would lead to \"environmental disaster\" due to the \"ever- increasing environmental damage from the electricity used in the 'mining' of Bitcoins\" and that \"The sooner this collective delusion comes to an end, the better.\" http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-06/quiggin-bitcoins-are-a-waste- of-energy/6827940 He also proposed that the value of Bitcoin was a refutation of the efficient market hypothesis: \"The EMH states that the market value of an asset is equal to the best available estimate of the value of the services or income flows it will generate. In the case of a company stock, this is the discounted value of future earnings. Since Bitcoins do not generate any actual earnings, they must appreciate in value to ensure that people are willing to hold them. But an endless appreciation, with no flow of earnings or liquidation value, is precisely the kind of bubble the EMH says can\u2019t happen.\" His most recent book, Zombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk among Us, was published in October 2010 from Princeton University Press.\"Zombie Economics: How Dead Ideas Still Walk among Us\" He was appointed in 2012 to the Board of the Climate Change Authority of the Australian Government. With reference to the pro-nuclear film Pandora's Promise, Quiggin comments that it presents the environmental rationale for nuclear power, but that reviving nuclear power debates is a distraction, and the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically-viable. Quiggin says that we need more efficient energy use and more renewable energy commercialisation. ==Awards== Quiggin is one of the most prolific economists in Australia, illustrated by his output over diverse, high-quality journalsPer a Google Scholar search of \"John Quiggin\". and by citation frequencies in the period 1988\u20132000.Sinha, Dipendra & Macri, Joseph, He has been placed in the top 5% economists in the world according to IDEAS/RePEc since its monthly aggregate rankings began in 2004.Top 10% Authors, Current Monthly Rankings at RePEc (Research Papers in Economics)Aggregate rankings of Economists Commences July 2004 at RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) Full list of Historical Monthly RePec Rankings (Research Papers in Economics) Quiggin has frequently been awarded and recognised for his research, including twice receiving Federation Fellowships from the Australian Research Council.Federation Fellows 2007 He was awarded the Australian Social Science Academy Medal in 1993 and a Fellowship in 1996, received the 1997 and 2000 Sam Richardson of the Institute of Public Administration, Australia, received the 2001 Editors Prize of the Australian Journal of Agricultural Economics, a Fellowship of the Australian Institute of Company Directors in 2002, and a Distinguished Fellowship of the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society in 2004.
