There he built a house for his family. Remnants of the original building still exist in the inscribed stonework of the present building, which is inscribed with the date \u201c1735\".RootsWeb: Rhoad\u2019s Burying Grounds Based on the inscribed date, 1735 is considered the date of the founding of the Vincent Mennonite Congregation.History of the Mennonites of the Franconia Conference, John C. Wagner, 1938 The first use of the original building as a community meetinghouse dates to 1750. This is recorded by Frederick Sheeder in his 1845 Sketch of Vincent Township, stating: \"the meeting house that has allways whent by the name of Rohd\u2019s this meeting house was built in 1750 [for use by] the old Germans nearly all in the neighborhood.\"Sketch of Vincent Township (PMHB, Vol. XXXIV (1910), January, April & July editions), Frederick Sheender, 1845 ===Middle: 1798-1974=== The transfer of the deed from the Rhoad family to the Vincent Mennonite Congregation was not made until 12 June 1798. John Rhoad sold the property and grounds to Henry Acker, Sr., and Jacob Finkbiner, who acted on behalf of the Vincent Mennonite Church, the deed stating: \u201ca lot or piece of land situated in the said Township of Vincent, bounded by lands of John Rhoades, containing two acres more or less\u2026for the sum of five shillings.\u201dChester County, Pennsylvania Deed Bk. Q-2:219 The pre-Revolutionary building was razed in 1889, and was replaced the same year by the current building, a stone-and-stucco church re-built just east of the original building. The Mennonite meetinghouse served as a place of worship and sanctuary, and as a school for the education of Christian youths for the Vincent Mennonite Congregation. They met in the original building from 1750 until 1889, and in the current building from 1889 until 1974, a total of 224 years. In 1969, the congregation began planning to build a new church. In 1974, the new church was built nearby on Seven Stars Road in East Vincent Township where the congregation worships currently. ===Late: 1974-Today=== The 1889 building is located on a rise at the intersection of two historic roads: Mennonite Church Road and Schuylkill Road (PA Route 724). Since June 1974, the building has served as a law office.East Vincent News, Volume 6 Issue 2, \u201cThe Meetinghouse Law Office Building,\u201d pg. 2, May 2009 (https://archive.org/details/EastVincentNews) The building retains the original large internal open space, 33 ft x 53 ft, \u2014free from any visible support beams\u2014as well as the original tin roof and ceiling, and the original doors and entrance.
