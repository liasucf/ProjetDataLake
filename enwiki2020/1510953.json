A lesser-known contemporary of Ghalib and Zauq, he used \"Momin\" as his nom de plume. His grave is located near the parking area of Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi. ==Life== Momin Khan 'Momin' was born in Delhi into a Muslim family of Kashmiri origin.Abida Samiuddin, Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Urdu Literature, Global Vision Publishing House (2007), p. 342Kuldip Salill, A Treasury Of Urdu Poetry, Rajpal & Sons (2009), p.72 His father, Ghulam Nabi Khan, was a Hakeem (physician of traditional/Unani medicine). Momin Khan received training in the family profession from a young age and himself became a hakim, due to which he is often referred to in contemporary accounts as \"Hakeem Khan,\" Hakeem being the Urdu word for physician. However, his bent was for poetry and he soon became known more as an accomplished poet. His interest received a fillip due to the associations he unwittingly gained through marriage. In 1823, Momin married to a girl belonged to the family of zamindar (land owner). The marriage became unsuccessful, and he separated from his wife. He later married Anjuman-un-Nisa Begum, a relative of Urdu poet and Sufi saint Khwaja Mir Dard. They had a son, Ahmad Nasir Khan, and a daughter, Muhammadi Begum. Momin died after accidentally falling from the roof of his house on 24 Rajab 1268 Hijri (14 May 1852) at the age of 52.Diwan-e-Ghalib, compiled by Kalidas Gupta Riza, pg 90, Anjuman-i Taraqqi-i Urdu, Karachi (1997) Momin was something of a polymath, with several interests apart from medicine and poetry. He was also competent in mathematics, geomancy, astrology, chess and Hindustani music.K.C.

Matthews, Urdu Literature, South Asia Books (1985), p. 86 ==Works== Momin Khan Momin's famous ghazal in Devnagri script. Momin is known for his particular Persianized style and the beautiful use of his 'takhallus'. According to legend, Mirza Ghalib (his contemporary and also a rival) offered Momin his entire diwan (collection of poetry) in exchange for a particular verse of Momin. However, most modern poets believe this claim as an 'exaggeration' which poets commonly indulged in at that time. This exaggeration was usually done to emphasise some thing. The couplet in question was: :: : :\"Tum m\u0113r\u0113 p\u0101s h\u014dt\u0113 h\u014d g\u014dy\u0101'' ::Jab k\u014d'\u012b d\u016bsr\u0101 nah\u012b\u207f\u02e1 hot\u0101\" which translates to: :You are close to me [as if] ::When no one else is. This couplet's beauty is in its succinctness and multiple layers of meaning. One of the meanings is When you're with me(on my mind), no-one else is and a second meaning/interpretation is You are with me (on my side), when no-one else is. The two meanings emerge by the use of words g\u014dy\u0101 and jab (when).\" One of his very famous ghazals starts with the following matla (the first line of the opening couplet of a ghazal). :Woh j\u014d ham m\u0113\u207f tum m\u0113\u207f qar\u0101r t\u1e23\u0101; tumh\u0113\u207f y\u0101d h\u014d, keh nah y\u0101d h\u014d: ::Woh\u012b, ya\u02bfn\u012b wa\u02bfdah nib\u0101h k\u0101; tumh\u0113\u207f y\u0101d h\u014d, keh nah y\u0101d h\u014d :: : :That understanding which we had between us... whether you remember it or not... ::That promise of trust and faithfulness...whether you remember it or not...Profile of Momin Khan Momin on urduadab.com website Retrieved 20 May 2018 ==References== ==External links== *Filmography of Momin Khan Momin on IMDb website * *Momin Khan Momin at Urdu Poetry Archive *Momin Khan Momin at Kavita Kosh Category:Kashmiri people Category:1800 births Category:1852 deaths Category:Urdu poets from India Category:Indian male poets Category:Poets from Delhi Category:Indian Sufi saints Category:19th-century Indian poets Category:19th-century male writers ",
