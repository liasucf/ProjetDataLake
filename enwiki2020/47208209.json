He is married to Nan Than Htwe, the niece of Win Myint, a former SPDC official. In January 2000, Kanbawza was awarded a banking license to operate Kanbawza Bank, which was first established in Taunggyi. ==Controversy== In 2017, the Burmese military launched a fundraising campaign to fund \"clearance operations\" in northern Rakhine State, as part of the broader Rohingya conflict. In response, KBZ Group's Brighter Future Foundation donated over 3.469 billion kyats (approximately US$2.48 million) to the armed forces. ==Subsidiaries== *Air KBZ *Myanmar Airways International *Kanbawza Bank *IKBZ Insurance Company *KBZ Life Insurance ==References== Category:Conglomerate companies of Myanmar Category:Holding companies established in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in Myanmar ",
