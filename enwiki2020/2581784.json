    "text": "Bardia Barracks, part of the historic Ingleburn Army Camp Ingleburn is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 40 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of City of Campbelltown. It is part of the Macarthur region. Ingleburn is located approximately halfway between the two commercial centres of Liverpool and Campbelltown. == History == The land in the Ingleburn area was originally inhabited by the Tharawal people prior to the arrival of settlers from the First Fleet in 1788. The first land grants in the area were made in 1809 to William Hall, William Neale, Joshua Alliot and Timothy Loughlin, all previously soldiers in the NSW Corps. As such, the area became known as \"Soldier Flat\". In 1869, a rail platform was built on the old Neale grant and given the name Macquarie Fields Station after a property to the north. However, in 1881 the Macquarie Fields estate subdivided to become the new village of Macquarie Fields. The fact that the station was a long way from the village caused confusion so a new name was sought for the station and Ingleburn was chosen in 1883. One theory has it was named after a local house formerly owned by Mary Ruse, daughter of pioneer James Ruse. Other records indicate it was named after a British town although the corresponding town hasn't been identified. Ingleburn is Scottish for \"bend in the river\", referring to the significant bend in the nearby Georges River. The village of Ingleburn was established in 1885 when the land owned by a developer called FitzStubbs was subdivided. A public school was opened in 1887. Ingleburn Post Office opened on 15 November 1886. By 1896, the town was large enough to have its own municipal council. Town improvements such as street lights and water did not arrive until after World War I. In 1948 the Council was merged with the City of Campbelltown Council. In 1969, a large area west of the railway line was rezoned to become an industrial estate. Protests from local residents saw the plan halted temporarily but within ten years, the west side of the town had become largely industrial and remains so to this day. More housing subdivisions were made on the outskirts of town in the 1970s including Housing Commission developments. == Heritage listings == Ingleburn has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Campbelltown Road: Ingleburn Military Heritage Precinct and Mont St Quentin Oval * 196 Campbelltown Road: Robin Hood Farm == Commercial areas == Ingleburn's central business district is adjacent to the railway station and includes two shopping centres called Ingleburn Fair and Ingleburn Town Centre as well as a small shopping area on Lagonda Drive.
