The addition of a religious symbol to a stone used to prepare food is also recorded for quern stones as one was discovered at Dunadd in Scotland which has a cross carved into the upper stone. This example has a high quality of finishing which reflects its 'cost' and enhances its symbolic value and social significance. The cross is likely to have 'protected' the cereal and the resultant flour from evil, such as fungal rust or ergot. The religious association with knocking stones may be that the process of making bread produces the staple of life.Ewan Campbell, A cross- marked quern from Dunadd and other evidence for relations between Dunass and Iona, Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol. 5, no. 117 (1987), pp. 105 \u2013 117.
