    "text": "The Triolas The triola (11px listen) is a children's musical instrument, a hand-tuned single-tone wind harmonica. Triolas are manufactured by C. A. Seydel S\u00f6hne in Klingenthal, Germany. The triola is designed to teach children from the age of two and above how to read and play music. It works by blowing into the instrument and pressing the coloured keys. The coloured keys correspond with the coloured notes on the music. It is available in two sizes: a model with 12 notes from G to D, in length and a model with eight notes (an octave) from middle C to C, in length. ==See also== *Melodica ==External links== *Triolas in schools Category:Free reed aerophones ",
