    "text": "KJBN (1050 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station in Little Rock, Arkansas. The station is currently owned by Joshua Ministries & Community Development Corp. and it airs an urban gospel radio format including some Christian talk and teaching programs. Hosts pay the station for their time on the air, and may ask for donations during their programs. KJBN broadcasts at 1,000 watts by day. But because AM 1050 is a Mexican clear channel frequency, it must greatly reduce power at night to 19 watts to avoid interfering with other stations on its frequency. ==History== KJBN first signed on in 1948 as KVLC.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 76 It was owned by the Southwest Broadcasting Company. The following year it put an FM radio station on the air, 94.1 KVLC-FM (today KKPT). ==References== ==External links== *KJBN website *FCC History Cards for KJBN JBN Category:Contemporary Christian radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1977 JBN ",
