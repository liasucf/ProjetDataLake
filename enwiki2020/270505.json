They vary greatly in size, form, and material of construction, and have been in use since ancient times throughout the world. They may consist of simple earthenware bowls or fire pots to intricately carved silver or gold vessels, small table top objects a few centimetres tall to as many as several metres high. Many designs use openwork to allow a flow of air. In many cultures, burning incense has spiritual and religious connotations, and this influences the design and decoration of the censer. Often, especially in Western contexts, \"censer\" is used for pieces made for religious use, especially those on chains that are swung through the air to spread the incense smoke widely, while \"perfume burner\" is used for objects made for secular use. The original meaning of pastille was a small compressed mixture of aromatic plant material and charcoal that was lit to release the odour, and pastille-burners were designed for this, for use in the home. Pastilles were made at home until their heyday in the early 19th century, and the burners are often made in pottery or porcelain.The Regency Redingote, October, 2013 Some types could also be used as pomanders, where the perfume diffuses slowly by evaporation rather than burning.Piotrovsky M.B. and Rogers, J.M. (eds), Heaven on Earth: Art from Islamic Lands, p. 87, 2004, Prestel, ==Use== Russian church, late 15th-early 16th century, silver, total height: 27.5 cm, width: 10.5 cm, the Moscow Kremlin Museums (Moscow, Russia) For direct-burning incense, pieces of the incense are burned by placing them directly on top of a heat source or on a hot metal plate in a censer or thurible. Indirect-burning incense, also called \"non-combustible incense\", is a combination of aromatic ingredients that are not prepared in any particular way or encouraged into any particular form, leaving it mostly unsuitable for direct combustion. The use of this class of incense requires a separate heat source since it does not generally kindle a fire capable of burning itself and may not ignite at all under normal conditions. This incense can vary in the duration of its burning with the texture of the material. Finer ingredients tend to burn more rapidly, while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually as they have less total surface area. The heat is traditionally provided by charcoal or glowing embers. For home use of granulated incense, small, concave charcoal briquettes are sold. One lights the corner of the briquette on fire, then places it in the censer and extinguishes the flame. After the glowing sparks traverse the entire briquette, it is ready to have incense placed on it. For direct-burning incense, the tip or end of the incense is ignited with a flame or other heat source until the incense begins to turn into ash at the burning end. Flames on the incense are then fanned or blown out, with the incense continuing to burn without a flame on its own. Censers made for stick incense are also available; these are simply a long, thin plate of wood, metal, or ceramic, bent up and perforated at one end to hold the incense. They serve to catch the ash of the burning incense stick. In Taoist and Buddhist temples, the inner spaces are scented with thick coiled incense, which are either hung from the ceiling or on special stands. Worshipers at the temples light and burn sticks of incense. Individual sticks of incense are then vertically placed into individual censers. ==Chinese use== A Qing Dynasty qilin-shaped incense burner Incense burner set from Japan's Edo period, 17th century Kakiemon ware, Walters Art Museum The earliest vessels identified as censers date to the mid-fifth to late fourth centuries BCE during the Warring States period. The modern Chinese term for \"censer,\" xianglu (\u9999\u7210, \"incense burner\"), is a compound of xiang (\"incense, aromatics\") and lu (\u7210, \"brazier; stove; furnace\"). Another common term is xunlu (\u718f\u7210, \"a brazier for fumigating and perfuming\"). Early Chinese censer designs, often crafted as a round, single-footed stemmed basin, are believed to have derived from earlier ritual bronzes, such as the dou \u8c46 sacrificial chalice. Among the most celebrated early incense burner designs is the hill censer (boshanlu \u535a\u5c71\u7210), a form that became popular during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141\u201387 BCE). Some scholars believe hill censers depict a sacred mountain, such as Mount Kunlun or Mount Penglai. These elaborate vessels were designed with apertures that made rising incense smoke appear like clouds or mist swirling around a mountain peak.Erickson, Susan N. (1992). \"Boshanlu: Mountain Censers of the Western Han Period: A Typological and Iconological Analysis\", Archives of Asian Art 45:6-28. The Han Dynasty scholar Liu Xiang (77\u20136 BCE) composed an inscription describing a hill censer: > I value this perfect utensil, lofty and steep as a mountain! Its top is like > Hua Shan in yet its foot is a bronze plate. It contains rare perfumes, red > flames and green smoke; densely ornamented are its sides, and its summit > joins azure heaven. A myriad animals are depicted on it. Ah, from it sides I > can see ever further than Li Lou [who had legendary eyesight].Needham, > Joseph and Lu Gwei-Djen (1974). Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, > Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 2, Spagyrical Discovery and > Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality. Cambridge University Press. > p. 133. Another popular design was the small \"scenting globe\" (xiangqiu \u9999\u7403), a device similar to a pomander, but used for burning incense. The famed inventor and craftsmen, Ding Huan (1st c. BCE), is believed to have made these with gimbal supports so the censer could easily be used to fumigate or scent garments. This is described by Edward H. Schafer: > \"Censing baskets\" were globes of hollow metal, pierced with intricate floral > or animal designs; within the globe, an iron cup, suspended on gimbals, > contained the burning incense. They were used to perfume garments and > bedclothes, and even to kill insects.Schafer, Edward H. (1963). The Golden > Peaches of Samarkand, a Study of T'ang Exotics. University of California > Press. p. 155. Other Chinese censers are shaped like birds or animals, sometimes designed so that the incense smoke would issue from the mouth. During the medieval period when censers were more commonly used in Buddhist and Daoist rituals, hand-held censers (shoulu \u624b\u7210) fashioned with long handles were developed. Archeologists have excavated several censers from Han era tombs that contained aromatics or ashen remains. Some of these aromatic plants have been identified as maoxiang (\u8305\u9999 \"Imperata cylindrica, thatch grass\"), gaoliangjiang (\u9ad8\u826f\u8591 \"Galangal\"), xinyi (\u8f9b\u5937 \"Magnolia liliiflora, Mulan magnolia), and gaoben (\u85c1\u672c\"Ligusticum sinense, Chinese lovage\"). Scholars speculate burning these grasses \"may have facilitated communication with spirits\" during funeral ceremonies.Erickson (1992), p. 15. According to the Sinologist and historian Joseph Needham, some early Daoists adapted censers for the religious and spiritual use of cannabis. The Daoist encyclopedia Wushang Biyao (\u7121\u4e0a\u79d8\u8981 \"Supreme Secret Essentials\", ca. 570 CE), recorded adding cannabis into ritual censers.Needham and Lu (1974), p. 150. The Shangqing School of Daoism provides a good example. The Shangqing scriptures were written by Yang Xi (330\u2013 c. 386 CE) during alleged visitations by Daoist \"immortals\", and Needham believed Yang was \"aided almost certainly by cannabis\".Needham and Lu (1974), p. 151. Tao Hongjing (456-536 CE), who edited the official Shangqing canon, also compiled the Mingyi bielu (\u540d\u91ab\u5225\u9304 \"Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians\"). It noted that mabo (\u9ebb\u52c3 \"cannabis flowers\"), \"are very little used in medicine, but the magician- technicians ([shujia] \u8853\u5bb6) say that if one consumes them with ginseng it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future.\" Needham concluded, > Thus all in all there is much reason for thinking that the ancient Taoists > experimented systematically with hallucinogenic smokes, using techniques > which arose directly out of liturgical observance. \u2026 At all events the > incense-burner remained the centre of changes and transformations associated > with worship, sacrifice, ascending perfume of sweet savour, fire, > combustion, disintegration, transformation, vision, communication with > spiritual beings, and assurances of immortality. Wai tan and nei tan met > around the incense-burner. Might one not indeed think of it as their point > of origin?Needham and Lu (1974), p. 154. These Waidan (\u5916\u4e39 \"outer alchemy\") and neidan (\u5167\u4e39 \"inner alchemy\") are the primary divisions of Chinese alchemy. During the T\u2019ang period, incense was used by upper class people for personal hygiene, romantic rendezvous, and deodorizing the interior of edifices. These included places of worship, dwellings, and work-spaces. Dating back to the seventh century AD, the kuanhuo(changing of fire) ceremony took place, where people would cleanse their homes with incense. However, in some parts of East Asia, incense burners were used as a way to tell time In the Far East, incense was used as a way to tell time because it was a simple mechanism and generally not a fire hazard. Time increments were marked off on each incense stick to show how much time had passed, then placed in a ritual tripod vessel known as a ting. During imperial coronations, incense sticks would be used to tell how long the ceremony was. Other variations of incense is the spiral incense coil. The spiral incense coil was used to measure time for longer durations. One spiral equated to one night. This type of incense was mainly used by the five \u2018night watches\u2019 of the community. The length of their shifts and breaks were determined by the time increments marked off on the spirals.Bedini, Silvio A. The Trail of Time = Shih-Chien Ti Tsu-Chi : Time Measurement with Incense in East Asia . Cambridge ;: Cambridge University Press, 1994. Print. ==Middle East== Khorasan or Central Asia Incense burners (miqtarah in Arabic) were used in both religious and secular contexts, but were more widely utilized in palaces and houses. The earliest known examples of dish-shaped incense burners with zoomorphic designs were excavated in Ghanza, while the earliest examples of zoomorphic incense burners are from 11th-century Tajikistan.Piotrovsky M.B. and Rogers, J.M. (eds), Heaven on Earth: Art from Islamic Lands, pp 86-87, 2004, Prestel, It is most likely that this practice was inspired by Hellenistic style incense burners as well as the frankincense trade present in the Arabian peninsula since the 8th century BCE. Incense Burner of Amir Saif al-Dunya wa\u2019l-Din ibn Muhammad al-Mawardi, 12th century, alt=Source of photo: The Metropolitan Museum of Art A wide variety of designs were used at different times and in different areas. Pottery and stone incense burners were the most common while those made of metals were reserved for the wealthy. Artisans created these incense burners with moulds or the lost-wax method. Openwork zoomorphic incense burners with lynx or lion designs were popular in the Islamic world; bronze or brass examples are found from the 11th-century until the Mongol conquests of the 13th-century. These were especially popular during the Seljuq period. The extensive use of lynx shape incense burners was due to the animals popularity as a hunting animal and as pet in Muslim courts. The complexity of the piece would also make it fit into a palatial setting. This style of incense burners could measure about 22 cm; others like an example in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York measures 85 cm. The surface of the object would be decorated with bands of Arabic calligraphy which would imitate a tiraz. This bands of text could include the name of the artist and the patron as well as prayers and good wishes for the owner. To insert coals and incense the head would be removed; the openwork geometric design would then allow the scented smoke to escape. Depending on the size, the incense burner could be either carried on a tray or carried by using the tail as a handle. In mosques, incense burners do not have a liturgical use or a specific design denoted for religious context. However, they are still an important part of rituals and weddings. Other religious groups in Middle East such as the Copts do have ceremonial uses for incense burners. ==Japan== Koro (Japanese: \u9999\u7089, k\u014dro), also a Chinese term, is a Japanese censer often used in Japanese tea ceremonies. Examples are usually of globular form with three feet, made in pottery, Imari porcelain, Kutani ware, Kakiemon, Satsuma, enamel or bronze. In Japan a similar censer called a is used by several Buddhist sects. The eg\u014dro is usually made of brass with a long handle and no chain. Instead of charcoal, makk\u014d powder is poured into a depression made in a bed of ash. The makk\u014d is lit and the incense mixture is burned on top. This method is known as Sonae-k\u014d (Religious Burning). ==Mesoamerica== Teotihuacan censer lid. Museo de Am\u00e9rica, Madrid Used domestically and ceremonially in Mesoamerica, particularly in the large Central-Mexican city of Teotihuacan (100\u2013600 AD) and in the many kingdoms belonging to the Maya civilization, were ceramic incense burners. The most common materials for construction were Adobe, plumbate,Bruhns, Karen Olsen. \u201cPlumbate Origins Revisited.\u201d American Antiquity, vol. 45, no. 04, 1980, pp. 845\u2013848., doi:10.2307/280154. and earthenware. These materials can be dried by the sun and were locally sourced, making them the perfect material for a Mayan craftsman. Censers vary in decoration. Some are painted using a fresco style technique or decorated with adornos,Feinman, Gary M., and Dorie Reents-Budet. \"Painting the Maya Universe: Royal Ceramics of the Classic Period.\" The Hispanic American Historical Review 75, no. 3 (1995): 457. doi:10.2307/2517243. or small ceramic ornaments. These decorations usually depicted shells, beads, butterflies, flowers, and other symbols with religious significance that could to increase rainfall, agricultural abundance, fertility, wealth, good fortune or ease the transition of souls into the underworld.Morehart, Christopher T., Abigail Meza Pe\u00f1aloza, Carlos Serrano S\u00e1nchez, Emily Mcclung De Tapia, and Emilio Ibarra Morales. \"Human Sacrifice During the Epiclassic Period in the Northern Basin of Mexico.\" Latin American Antiquity 23, no. 04 (2012): 426-48. doi:10.7183/1045-6635.23.4.426. To identify precious materials such as jadeite and quetzal feathers, important visual markers of status,Feinman, Gary M., and Dorie Reents-Budet. \"Painting the Maya Universe: Royal Ceramics of the Classic Period.\" The Hispanic American Historical Review 75, no. 3 (1995): 457. doi:10.2307/2517243. artists used colorful paints. Used to communicate with the Gods, these censers functioned for acts of religious purification. Incense would be presented to the divine being. In fact, some people were appointed the position of fire priest. Fire priests dealt with most tasks related to incense burning. Some rituals involved a feast, which would be followed by the fire priest igniting a sacred brazier in the temples. It was given to the divine beings and deities as offerings on a daily basis. The practice would end at the sound of a trumpet made from a conch shell. Another function of incense was to heal the sick. Once recuperated, the diseased would present some incense to the appropriate gods to repay them for being cured.Culler, Judith L. Incense Burners. Gettysburg Pa: Gettysburg College/Gettysburg Pa., 1961. Print.Made up of copal (tree resin), rubber, pine, herbs, myrrh, and chewing gum, the incense produced what was described as \"the odor of the center of heaven.\"Coe, Michael D. The Maya, Seventh Edition. 2005. The shape of incense burners in the Maya southern lowlands reflected religious and cultural changes over time. Some censers were used in funerals and funerary rituals, such as those depicting the Underworld Jaguar or the Night Sun God. When a king would die, \u2018termination rituals\u2019 were practiced. During these rituals, incensarios would be smashed and older temples were replaced with new ones.Rice, P.M. 1999, \u2018Rethinking Classic lowland Maya pottery censers\u2019, Ancient Mesoamerica, vol. 10, no.1, pp.25-50.Mayan censers, which had a reservoir for incense on top of a vertical shaft were highly elaborate during the Classic period (600\u2013900 AD), particularly in the kingdom of Palenque, and usually show the head of a Mayan deity. In Post-Classic Yucat\u00e1n, particularly in the capital of the kingdom of Mayapan, censers were found in great numbers, often shaped as an aged priest or deity. Craftsmen produced Mayan censers in many sizes, some just a few inches in height, others, several feet tall. ==Christian use== Orthodox priest with hand censer ===Eastern churches=== ====Chain censer==== In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches, censers (Greek: thymiateria) are similar in design to the Western thurible. This fourth chain passes through a hole the hasp and slides in order to easily raise the lid. There will often be 12 small bells attached to the chains, symbolising the preaching of the Twelve Apostles, where one of the bells has been silenced to symbolize the rebel Judas.Herrera, Matthew D. Holy Smoke: The Use of Incense in the Catholic Church . San Luis Obispo: Tixlini Scriptorium, 2011. In some traditions the censer with bells is normally used only by a bishop. Before a deacon begins a censing, he will take the censer to the priest (or the bishop, if he is present) for a blessing. The censers, charcoal and incense are kept in the diaconicon (sacristy) Entrance with the censer at Great Vespers. The censer is used much more frequently in the Eastern churches: typically at every vespers, matins, and Divine Liturgy, as well as pannikhidas (memorial services), and other occasional offices. If a deacon is present, he typically does much of the censing; otherwise, the priest will perform the censing. Unordained servers or acolytes are permitted to prepare and carry the censer, but may not swing it during prayers. Liturgical Censing is the practice of swinging a censer suspended from chains towards something or someone, typically an icon or person, so that smoke from the burning incense travels in that direction. Burning incense represents the prayers of the church rising towards Heaven. One commonly sung psalm during the censing is \"Let my prayer arise in Thy sight as incense, and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.\"Psalm 141:2, New International Version When a deacon or priest performs a full censing of the temple (church building), he will often say Psalm 51 quietly to himself. ====Hand censer==== In addition to the chain censer described above, a \"hand censer\" (Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03af katzi or katzion) is used on certain occasions. This device has no chains and consists of a bowl attached to a handle, often with bells attached. The lid is normally attached to the bowl with a hinge. In Greek practice, particularly as observed on Mount Athos, during the portion of Vespers known as \"Lord, I cry unto Thee\" the ecclesiarch (sacristan) and his assistant will perform a full censing of the temple and people using hand censers. Some churches have the practice of not using the chain censer during Holy Week, even by a priest or bishop, substituting for it the hand censer as a sign of humility, repentance and mourning over the Passion of Christ. They return to using the chain censer just before the Gospel reading at the Divine Liturgy on Great Saturday. Some Orthodox Christians use a standing censer on their icon corner (home altar). ===Western churches=== Censer used during Mass In the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church and some other groups, the censer is often called a thurible, and used during important offices (benedictions, processions, and important Masses). A common design for a thurible is a metal container, about the size and shape of a coffee-pot, suspended on chains. The bowl contains hot coals, and the incense is placed on top of these. The thurible is then swung back and forth on its chains, spreading the fragrant smoke. A famous thurible is the Botafumeiro, in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Suspended from the ceiling of the cathedral, the swinging of this high, 55 kilogram silver vessel is an impressive sight. One of the explanations for the great size of the Botafumeiro is that in the early days it was used to freshen the air in the cathedral after being visited by droves of travel-weary pilgrims. It was also once believed that the incense smoke guarded against contracting the many diseases that plagued the populace in past centuries. Some thuribles were based on an architectural motif, for example the Gozbert Censer from the Cathedral of Trier inspired by the Temple of Solomon. == Hindu use == Hindus have traditionally used an earthen censer called a Dhunachi for burning incense with coal, though coconut husk is also used. The vessel has a flared shape with a curved handle and an open top. There are also brass and silver versions. == Gallery == File:Incense burner from Assur, Iraq. Circa 2400 BC.
