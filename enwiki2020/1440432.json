Retrieved February 23, 2014 ==Career== ===Dolemite records and wider acclaim=== By his own account, he was working at the world famous Dolphin's of Hollywood record store in Los Angeles, California in 1970 when he began hearing obscene stories of \"Dolemite\" recounted by a local man named Rico. Moore recorded a number of street poets, including Big Brown who, before he moved to Los Angeles, had been an influence on Bob Dylan, among other artists, while living in Greenwich Village. (Dylan said Brown's poetry was the best poetry he had ever heard.) In 1973, Moore produced Brown's album, The First Man of Poetry, Big Brown: Between Heaven and Hell. According to Moore, there was a wino named Rico, and Moore heard him on the street corner doing all these raps and rhymes:Interview with Moore on DVD \"The Legend of Dolemite: Bigger and Badder\" Moore began recording the stories, and assumed the role of \"Dolemite\" in his club act and on recordings.Jocelyn Y Stewart, \"Obituary: Rudy Ray Moore\", Los Angeles Times, 21 October 2008. Retrieved February 23, 2014 In 1970\u201371 he recorded three albums of material, Eat Out More Often, This Pussy Belongs To Me, and The Dirty Dozens, where \"with jazz and R&B; musicians playing in the background, [Moore] would recite raunchy, sexually explicit rhymes that often had to do with pimps, prostitutes, players, and hustlers.\"Alex Henderson, Review of This Pussy Belongs To Me at Allmusic.com. Retrieved February 23, 2014 Moore was influenced by more mainstream comedians such as Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor, as well as by traditions such as the Dozens. The recordings were usually made in Moore's own house, with friends in attendance to give a party atmosphere. The album covers and contents were often too racy to be put on display in record stores, but the records became popular through word of mouth and were highly successful in Black American communities, where his \"warped wit and anti-establishment outlook\" were embraced. ===Dolemite movie and later success=== Moore spent most of his earnings from the records to finance the movie Dolemite, which appeared in 1975 and has been described as \"one of the great blaxploitation movies\" of the 1970s. The character was \"the ultimate ghetto hero: a bad dude, profane, skilled at kung-fu, dressed to kill and hell-bent on protecting the community from evil menaces. He was a pimp with a kung-fu-fighting clique of prostitutes and he was known for his sexual prowess.\" The film was successful and was followed by The Human Tornado, The Monkey Hustle, and Petey Wheatstraw: The Devil's Son-in-Law. Moore continued to release albums that appealed to his enduring fanbase through the 1970s and 1980s, but little of his work reached the mainstream white audience. His \"rapid-fire rhyming salaciousness exceeded the wildest excesses\" of Foxx and Pryor, and his highly explicit style kept him off television and major films. At the same time, Moore often spoke in his church and regularly took his mother to the National Baptist Convention. He said that: \"I wasn't saying dirty words just to say them... It was a form of art, sketches in which I developed ghetto characters who cursed. I don't want to be referred to as a dirty old man, rather a ghetto expressionist.\" ===Later career=== In 1990, Moore appeared on Big Daddy Kane's album Taste of Chocolate. In 1994, Moore appeared 2 Live Crew's album Back at Your Ass for the Nine-4. In 1995, Moore appeared in an episode of Martin titled \"The Players Came Home\". In 1997, Moore reprised his Dolemite character for a voiceover in the intro of Busta Rhymes' platinum album When Disaster Strikes.... In 1999, Moore reprised his Dolemite character in an appearance on Snoop Dogg's album No Limit Top Dogg. In 2000, Moore starred in Big Money Hustlas, a movie created by and starring the hip hop group Insane Clown Posse, in which he played Dolemite for the first time in over 20 years. In 2001, Moore was a featured guest in the intro of Busta Rhymes' platinum selling album Genesis. In 2006, Moore voice-acted in the show Sons of Butcher, as Rudy in season 2. In 2008, Moore reprised the character Petey Wheatstraw on the song \"I Live for the Funk\", which featured Blowfly and Daniel Jordan. It marked the first time Blowfly and Moore collaborated on the same record together, as well as the 30-year anniversary of the movie Petey Wheatstraw; it was also the final recording Moore made before his death.I Live 4 The Funk \u2013 Analog Medium == Death == On October 19, 2008, Moore died in Akron, Ohio, of complications from diabetes. He was never married. His mother, two brothers and a sister, a daughter, and grandchildren survived him. ==Legacy== He came to be regarded as a major influence by many later rap stars. Snoop Dogg said that \"without Rudy Ray Moore, there would be no Snoop Dogg, and that's for real.\" On June 7, 2018, it was announced that Craig Brewer would direct Dolemite Is My Name from a script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski with Netflix producing and distributing and Eddie Murphy starring as Moore.
