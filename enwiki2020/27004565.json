    "text": "Phrontis vibex, common name the bruised nassa, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Nassariidae, the Nassa mud snails or dog whelks.Marshall, B. (2016). Phrontis vibex (Say, 1822). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=877061 on 2016-05-20 ==Description== The length of the shell varies from 10 mm to 20 mm. The shell is ovate and conical. The spire is composed of six or seven indistinct whorls, subconvex, plaited throughout their whole length, crossed by fine and very close transverse striae. Those of the base are more prominent. The longitudinal folds disappear insensibly upon the right side of the body whorl, at the upper part of which we find merely nodosities. The whitish aperture is rounded. The cavity has a brown color, and is marked by transverse bands. The outer lip is bordered externally, and ornamented internally, with small, fine striae. The columella is arcuated and is covered with a fairly wide callosity, brown at its upper part, and white towards the base, which is adorned with small guttules. The coloring of the shell is olive, with a white or yellowish band. Upon the top of the body whorl, the folds and the tubercles are sometimes whitish.Kiener (1840).
