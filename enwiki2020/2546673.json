    "text": "Tvind is the informal name of a confederation of private schools, humanitarian organizations, and businesses, founded as an alternative education school in Denmark circa 1970. The organization is controversial in Denmark, where it runs a number of schools primarily for troubled youth. Some former students and employees have described the organization and its controlling body, the Teachers Group, as a political cult. Investigations by journalists and law- enforcement agencies have suggested the presence of an extensive money- laundering network within the group's commercial and non-profit ventures, wherein charitable funds are diverted to private businesses and individuals, including several of the group's leaders. In 2013, several of Tvind's senior members were sentenced in absentia to prison in Denmark for suspected tax evasion and embezzlement, after an earlier acquittal. , the defendants, who are wanted by Interpol, are believed to be hiding in Mexico. ==Overview== Following a provision of the Danish constitution that allows any group to form a school and receive government funding, Tvind has founded numerous private schools across Denmark. According to The Copenhagen Post, Over time, the group's financial dealings grew to encompass various non-profit and commercial enterprises such as African AIDS work, South American plantations and second- hand clothing dealers. Some former members of the group have made allegations that Tvind is run as an authoritarian cult, controlled by an inner circle known as the \"Teachers Group\". Its purported leader, Mogens Amdi Petersen, born 9 January 1939 in T\u00f8nder, had been in hiding since the 1970s and reappeared in 2002 when apprehended on charges of fraud and tax evasion. , Petersen and a group of the organization's leaders are facing charges of fraud in Denmark. ==History== Tvind School Center in Ulfborg seen from a hot air balloon. Tvind was founded c. 1970 by Petersen, then a young, radical idealist. Petersen is said to have collected about 40 followers and established a government-funded alternative school system for troubled youth in Denmark. In 1972 the Tvind base was founded in West Jutland on a plot of farming land called Tvind, where several schools were built as well as a teachers training college. At that time, all of Tvind's schools received public subsidies in accordance with the very liberal education laws in Denmark. It is located in the countryside near Ulfborg in Western Jutland, Denmark - 12 km from the North Sea. ===1970s and 1980s=== More 'Tvind Schools' began to emerge and after 25 years more than 30 schools have been established all over Denmark and some abroad. An estimated 40,000 children and adults have attended Tvind Schools since the first school was established in 1970. Tvind soon became a popular center for youth counter culture in the 1970s and 1980s. The world's largest electricity producing turbine, known as Tvindkraft or Tvind Power, was constructed on the school grounds in Tvind in the mid 1970s in a collaboration between volunteers, teachers and students. In 2008, The European Association for Renewable Energy awarded Tvind the European Solar Prize for education, in recognition of the effort of planning and building the turbine in the 1970s.\"Appreciation Tvind School\". eurosolar.de. Retrieved October 2015. The wind turbine at Tvind Tvindkraft has since supplied the energy needed for the schools in Tvind. The building of Tvindkraft inspired and gave rise to a growing wind mill industry in Denmark. ===Danish government subsidies, Special Act and Danish Supreme Court decision=== From 1970 to 1996, the Tvind schools received government financial support and supervision in accordance with Danish laws for private schools. Official support of The Necessary Teacher Training College, Tvind's volunteer training school in Denmark, had ended four years earlier, in 1992.Explanatory note to Bill No. 506 (Official report of Parliamentary Proceedings 1995/1996) read by Danish Parliament Folketinget, under the heading \"\u00d8konomiske og administrative konsekvenser\" shows a grant of 103 million DKK (app. 17 million USD) from the Ministry of Education to 31 Tvind Schools for the year of 1995 only. A Special Act passed in 1996 by the Danish Parliament discontinued the official support beginning January 1, 1997. This act prevented the Tvind schools from receiving such support under the general rules, which they otherwise would have been entitled to.The Supreme Courts Judgement of 19 of February 1999 in . A summary can be found in the Venice Commissions database CODICES: DEN-1999-2-005 In 1999, the Danish Supreme Court \u2014 in a unanimous, 11 judge ruling \u2014 set aside the Special Act on the grounds that it had circumvented the Danish Constitution. The controversial decision was the first time in the history of Denmark's Constitution that the Supreme Court had ever discarded an act as being unconstitutional. Despite the Court's ruling, the Tvind schools never regained financial support from the Danish government.\"Tvinds socialp\u00e6dagogik\" (7 October 1999) Aktuelt (Copenhagen). p. 10.Dahlin, Ulrik (21 March 2002). \"Tvinds 'fodringsmaskine'\".

In the schools for children and youngsters the student base was shifted so that the focus is now on students who have been subjected to abuse, involved with alcohol abuse or other drug abuse, being from immigrant or refugee families with conflict ridden background or being orphans, etc. Financial support for training and education of such young people are available from the social services of the municipalities in Denmark, which are now providing the funds for the school fees and boarding fees. Those schools were named \"The Small Schools\" because of many smaller units with different programs.\"Tvind trives\" (2 February 1998).

Aktuelt (Copenhagen). ==Schools== ===The Travelling Folk High Schools=== One type of Tvind institution, the \"travelling folk high schools\", were created to send teachers and students together to Third World countries with the ambition of improving living standards of the poor. Now collectively known as the \"DRH Movement\" (Den Rejsende H\u00f8jskole in Danish), these schools train volunteers for humanitarian work overseas. Some former DRH Movement students say that even after paying tuition of several thousand dollars, they were required to spend much of their time trying to raise yet more money by what some of them call begging in the streets. Students also complain that the training they received is not recognised by governments or aid agencies.Murphy, Paul (22 August 2008). \"Concerns raised over college\", Look North (BBC).

Special programs were established in the late 1970s and the beginning 1980s for young people from the so-called Frontline States in Southern Africa. The programs emphasized on vocational skills. Students from Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique, Angola, Namibia and Guinea Bissau completed such programs. ===Necessary Teachers Training College=== The Necessary Teachers Training College (Det N\u00f8dvendige Seminarium or DNS) was established in 1972. The training leads to a diploma in primary and secondary school teaching. ===The Continuation Schools and the Free Schools=== The first Continuation School for students from 14\u201318 years old was established in Tvind in 1974 and was followed by 6 other continuation schools and 6 international continuation schools with government financial support and supervision. The first International Continuation School received financial support from the EU Commission as well. The First Free School for pupils from 7\u201316 years old was established in 1976 and was followed by 6 other Free Schools, 5 of them boarding schools. These two school types were discontinued after the Government withdrew its financial support from 1997. ===The Small Schools and The Second Generation School Cooperation=== In 1979, the Small Schools started operations. Many of the students have experienced neglect and other difficult circumstances such as physical abuse and parental alcoholism. Many are \"runaways\".Tvinds sm\u00e5skoler\u2014redningsplanke eller skraldespand?\" (20 March 1996). Ritzaus (Denmark). The Small School at Red House near Buxton operated from 1984 to 1998 with local councils paying 700 pounds a week for the school to house troubled youngsters. More than a dozen former pupils have alleged that they were sexually and physically abused at the school and have even provided photographic evidence. A former Tvind head teacher described the English Small Schools as a \u201cmoney machine\u201d and alleged that Tvind used the schools to funnel money out of the UK to fund the extravagant lifestyles of Tvind\u2019s leaders. The English Small Schools were closed by inspectors after a 1997 Charity Commission report exposed the financial malfeasance that was taking place. In 2001 a former student successfully sued his child services department for sending him to a Small School and another abusive children\u2019s home. ==Humana People to People== In 1977, Tvind members founded the International Humana People to People Movement to oversee several self- described humanitarian aid projects in the Third World. In Scandinavia the group is known as \"Ulandshj\u00e6lp fra Folk til Folk\" (UFF). Headquartered in Zimbabwe, Humana People to People claims on its website to be a \"network of non-profit aid organizations in Europe, North America, Africa, Asia and Latin America, all working in the field of international solidarity, cooperation and development.\"\"About Us\"., Humana People to People. Retrieved June 2011.

This practice has caused UNICEF to pull all funding from Humana project. High ranking positions within Humana People to People are reserved for Teachers Group members. Tvind has also been linked to the College for International Co-operation and Development (CICD), located in Hull, East Yorkshire, England. Part of Tvind's \"DRH Movement,\" this residential college advertises widely on the Internet as providing training for young people wishing to volunteer in Africa. However, many former CICD students have complained about poor teaching, low-grade facilities, and being obliged to work long, unpaid hours collecting and sorting used clothes for commercial companies allegedly owned by Tvind. CICD has hundreds of clothes collection boxes across Northern England.Durham, Michael (2 May 2000). \"Cruel Mind Games\u2014Inside the Secret World of a Cult\", The Times (UK). Retrieved April 2013. === Used clothes collection === Tvind and Humana People to People are alleged to be behind a group of similar organisations that have placed tens of thousands of used clothes collection bins throughout the United States and Western Europe. Advertised as supporting environmental causes, the organizations behind the bins instead sell the clothes and channel the profits to a small circle of Tvind leaders, say investigators. Humana People-to- People's donation bins can be found in many European countries except in Scandinavia, where clothes are collected under the name UFF. In the UK, clothes collection organisations said to be tied to Tvind include the for- profit companies Green World Recycling, Planet Aid UK and Development Aid from People to People UK (DAPP-UK).Durham, Michael (17 December 2000). \"Charity's recycling claims mislead public\", The Independent (UK).

DAPP has been paid millions by the UK and US government for its work in Africa. An August 2016 report by the BBC, in partnership with the Center for Investigative Reporting, led the United Kingdom Department for International Development to suspend payments as well. In the United States, the non-profits Planet Aid and Gaia Movement Living Earth Green World Action and the for- profit company USAgain, which have each placed thousands of clothes drop-off bins nationwide, have attracted both favorable and unfavourable publicity over their business. Planet Aid is a member of the Humana People to People Federation and has supported these projects economically.

There are three other alleged Tvind-run clothes-collecting groups in the U.S., two of which are DRH Movement schools claiming to train volunteers for related humanitarian projects overseas through the Institute for International Cooperation and Development (IICD), located in Williamstown, Massachusetts and in Dowagiac, Michigan. Former students of IICD have reported being obliged to endure substandard living conditions, unreasonable work hours, bullying, and a \"cult-like\" atmosphere. Volunteers have also reported that they received little to no training, being instead required to solicit donations door-to- door, sell postcards on the street, and provide labour to Tvind-owned businesses under the guise of raising funds to support their overseas projects. Others recalled the aid programs themselves being fraught with mismanagement and even disastrous results.Willis, Jessica (11 February 2007). \"Questions in Williamstown\", The Berkshire Eagle (Pittsfield, Massachusetts).

Minister of Education Ole Vig and the Parliament attempted to tighten the legislation in order to prevent the Tvind Schools from receiving public funds. The Danish Supreme Court declared such attempts as contrary to the Danish Constitution. Vig was advised by the National Audit Office and the Parliament\u2019s Barrister (Kammeradvokaten) to raise the case accusing Tvind School Center of fraud. Around two years later, the Public Prosecutor in Aalborg dismissed the case - the materials did not contain sufficient evidence for prosecution. According to a 2001 case summary by Danish police and Denmark's Public Prosecutor for Serious Economic Crime, Tvind's scope had by 1992 \"expanded far beyond pure school activities\". Such activities were said to include the ownership of Third World fruit plantations, farms, shoe factories and sawmills, aid agencies, used clothing shops as well as the leasing of property, ships and containers.The Chief Constable in Holstebro and The Public Prosecutor for Serious Economic Crime (Denmark) (1 November 2001). \"Case Summary: The Public Prosecutor v.

Annually, alleged Tvind-run non-profit companies in the United States, Europe and elsewhere receive millions of dollars in governmental and private-sector funding intended for Tvind-related humanitarian programmes in Africa and other areas of the Third World. Danish prosecutors have claimed that Tvind members instead channelled a portion of funds earmarked for charitable use into purchases of property and luxury items, offshore tax havens and private business investments, all controlled by Tvind's top leaders.Durham, Michael (9 June 2003). \"Enigma of The Leader\", The Guardian (UK). Retrieved June 2011. An FBI investigation into Tvind stated that \"Tvind derives income from the creation of developmental aid organizations. Money is raised by the collection of used clothes. The clothes are recycled and sold in third world countries. The proceeds are sent to charitable trust funds established in off shore tax havens. [...] In each of these organizations the funds are ultimately controlled by captioned subjects who divert the money for personal use. Little to no money goes to the charities\". Danish media begun to air stories accusing Tvind of fraud as early as the late 1970s. Petersen, claiming to be a target for the SIS and the CIA, disappeared in 1979, and was not seen again for the next 22 years. He is alleged to have continued to covertly run his organisation from various locations, subverting Tvind's original humanitarian mission to create a lucrative financial web by diverting charitable funds into private coffers. Petersen's network soon became a business empire based on property and used clothes collection. Tvind has since then grown into a global conglomerate with numerous profit-motivated enterprises reportedly worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Its interests range from farming and timber to property, retail clothing and furniture, with businesses in Europe, the United States, Brazil, Belize, Ecuador, Malaysia and China. Mogens Amdi Petersen in 2002 In February 2002, FBI agents in the U.S. arrested Amdi Petersen between international flights at Los Angeles International Airport. An arrest warrant for Petersen had been issued in 2000 by the international police agency Interpol.

Three years later, on August 31, 2006, Petersen, Tvind spokesperson Poul J\u00f8rgensen, top aides Kirsten Larsen and Ruth Sejer\u00f8e-Olsen, former chairperson for Tvind's 'Humanitarian Foundation' Bodil Ross S\u00f8rensen, financial director Marlene Gunst, and lawyer Kirsten Fuglsbjerg (aka 'Christie Pipps') were all acquitted of charges. However, another former chairperson of Tvind's Humanitarian Foundation, Sten Byrner, was found guilty of fraud and given a one-year conditional sentence. The Public Prosecutor in Denmark immediately appealed the verdict to a higher court. Petersen and four of his co-defendants fled Denmark shortly after being acquitted by the lower court. Poul J\u00f8rgensen, who had remained in Denmark for the appeal trial, was found guilty of tax fraud and embezzlement in January 2009, and sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. According to Danish prosecutors, J\u00f8rgensen diverted millions of dollars earmarked for charitable use into private businesses owned by Tvind leaders. In 2013, Petersen and four others were sentenced in absentia to a year in prison for their suspected role in embezzling millions of Danish kroner from the Tvind Humanitarian Fund, an outgrowth of the Tvind schools. Danish police then instituted procedures for issuing an international arrest warrant, according to Jens Madsen, head of \"Bagmandspolitiet\", the Danish national financial crimes division.\"\u2018Cult school\u2019 leader sentenced to prison\" (30 August 2013).
