    "text": "The Solomon Roadhouse, also known as the Curran's Roadhouse, is a historic travel accommodation in northwestern Arctic Alaska. It is a two-story frame building located a short way north of the small community of Solomon, which is at the mouth of the Solomon River about east of Nome on the Nome-Council Highway. The roadhouse was built in 1904, during the days of the Nome Gold Rush, which brought many miners to the Solomon River as well, resulting in the establishment of the communities of Solomon and Dickson, and the construction of a railroad. After the gold rush declined and the communities were devastated by storms and floods, the roadhouse and other buildings were relocated about a mile north of the coast in the 1930s. The roadhouse operated until the 1970s. The roadhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Nome Census Area, Alaska ==References== Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Alaska Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1939 Category:Buildings and structures in Nome Census Area, Alaska Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Nome Census Area, Alaska Category:Relocated buildings and structures in Alaska ",
