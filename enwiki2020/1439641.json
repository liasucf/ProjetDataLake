    "text": "College rugby, more specifically rugby union, is played throughout universities in the United States of America. Men's college rugby is governed by USA Rugby, and does not fall under the auspices of the NCAA with the exception of 21 NCAA women's programs. Women's Rugby has been classified as an NCAA Emerging Sport since 2002. College rugby is the fastest growing college sport in the USA. Rugby union is also the fastest growing sport in the USA in general.\"Sold-Out Chicago Match Marks Rugby\u2019s Rising Popularity\" , Bloomberg, October 31, 2014. Major League Rugby implemented its first collegiate MLR Draft in 2020. Players are eligible for draft after 3 years in college at 21 years old. Free agents can try to join teams at 18 years old. There are over 900 college teams\u2014male and female\u2014registered with USA Rugby.Forbes, \"Why Pro Rugby Could Win In The United States\", February 25, 2011. There are over 32,000 college players registered with USA Rugby, making college rugby the largest section of USA Rugby's membership.USA Rugby, \"Membership Statistics, 2010-2011\". Rugby has been played in universities since as early as the 1800s, but it was the 1960s when rugby really found a foothold in colleges, led by the Catholic colleges such as Notre Dame and particularly the Jesuit universities such as Boston College and St. Joseph's in Philadelphia.Delco Times, \"Notre Dame and Boston College to Represent Catholic College Rugby in National Sevens Championship\", June 2, 2011. Today, college rugby continues to grow in popularity, and rugby is one of the fastest growing club sports across college campuses. The 32,000 registered college players in 2010 marked a 14% increase from 28,000 college players in 2008.Florida Rugby Union, \"Latest stats from USAR membership\", May 7, 2009.

The National Small College Rugby Organization grew from 85 teams in 2007 to 151 teams in 2011 and to over 200 men's teams for 2012.Gainline.usRugby Rugby, \"NSCRO Changes D3 Reference to Small College Rugby\", August 24, 2012. Several schools have increased their investments in men's and women's rugby programs, by creating rugby programs with varsity or quasi-varsity status and funding for scholarships,WV Metro News \u2013 Sports and Notre Dame and Texas have upgraded their rugby programs from \"club\" status to \"Olympic\" status. There has been increased interest in college rugby (particularly in rugby sevens) from TV since the International Olympic Committee's announcement in 2009 that rugby would return to the Summer Olympics in 2016. The highest profile college rugby sevens competition is the Collegiate Rugby Championship (CRC), which began in 2010. The CRC, which is played every June at Subaru Park in Philadelphia, is televised live by NBC Sports and regularly draws attendances of 18,000.Bleacher Report, \"Rugby: NBC's Collegiate Sevens Championship Preview\".2011 USA Sevens Collegiate Rugby Championship In 2015, the CRC set a new attendance record with over 24,000 spectators. Several top schools started a competition in 2013 called the Varsity Cup, with the 2014 Varsity Cup final broadcast live on NBC Sports. College club rugby includes a national championship competition (since 1980). California has won the majority of titles, with Air Force and BYU also winning multiple championships. In 2011 a new Division 1-A was created with approximately 30 schools forming the new division.Royall Rugby, \"College Premier Division Set to Launch\" . Boston College home match. ==Governance== In the United States, college rugby is governed by (in descending order of authority): USA Rugby, geographical unions (GUs) and local area unions (LAUs) (e.g., NERFU). USA Rugby has established a College Management Committee and a collegiate director, Rich Cortez, to oversee college rugby.College Contacts , USA Rugby. The NCAA has no authority over college rugby. Often called a club sport, each college team is administered by either the athletic department or the student club department. In 2011, USA Rugby continued to urge college rugby programs to adopt new conference structures similar to the conferences used by their other athletic programs. The highest profile example was the formation of the Ivy Rugby Conference in 2009.About Ivy Rugby, Ivy Rugby Conference. This move signals a shift away from the LAUs and TUs as the governing bodies for regional college rugby. Lynchburg College team photo after defeating Emory & Henry College, 35-15. Fall 2015 ==Play and participation== Winter and spring are the primary seasons for conferences in the pacific, northwest and south regions (e.g., PAC, Southeastern); the fall is the primary season for conferences in the northeast, mid-atlantic and upper midwest regions (e.g., Big Ten, Atlantic Coast). Conferences establish playing schedules in the primary season, while in the secondary season the teams often set up friendly matches or focus on playing rugby sevens. USA Rugby maintains player eligibility guidelines, administered by the local area unions. College players generally have five years of rugby eligibility from the time they graduate high school. On-field disciplinary issues are generally handled by the local area unions, while off-field disciplinary issues are governed by the academic institution and the local area union. USA Rugby's CIPP insurance program provides liability insurance to players, teams, administrators and pitch hosts in exchange for an annual dues payment. Roughly one quarter of college rugby programs offer financial aid to their players. Outstanding college rugby players are recognized as All-Americans.USA Rugby, College Qualified All-Americans can represent the United States in international tournaments by playing on the United States national under-20 rugby union team or the All Americans rugby union team. ==Divisions== College rugby competition in the USA is divided into several tiers: *The highest is Division I-A, formerly known as the College Premier Division *Division I-AA *Division II *Small College, formerly known as Divisions III and IV. USA Rugby generally allows colleges to select the division in which the college thinks it would fit best. Most schools remain in the same division from year-to-year, but there are exceptions. Schools that have been successful in a particular division may move up but are not required to do so; likewise, poorly performing schools may move down a division, but are not required to. Successful schools may have varied reasons for declining promotion. For example, a school may prefer to remain in its current conference against traditional rivals, or a school with a small budget might resist the additional travel expense that might come from switching divisions and conferences. The most recent significant movement across divisions occurred in 2011 when USA Rugby separated Division I into Division I-A and I-AA.\"USA Rugby: 'What BYU won ... was a mythical championship'\", Deseret News, May 17, 2013. This new arrangement caused Division I schools to choose one or the other, with 31 schools joining Division I-A and the majority of Division I schools joining Division I-AA. Additionally, the creation of Division I-AA caused several successful Division II schools to move up to Division I-A. The evolving division structures, caused significant shifts in schools between Divisions I-A and I-AA in the following years, with half of the original 31 D I-A members leaving by the end of 2013, and new schools from lower divisions taking their place. ==Varsity programs== ===Men's varsity=== Majority of colleges classify their rugby programs as club sports rather than varsity sports. A small but growing number of universities, however, have begun labeling rugby as a varsity sport, realizing that rugby can be profitable, as a successful rugby program can result in national championships and increased marketability.Rugby Mag, College Rugby State of the Union: Part Deux, Oct. 12, 2011, http://rugbymag.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=2303:college- rugby-state-of-the-union-part-deux&catid;=101:op-eds&Itemid;=302 {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:95%;\" |- |+Men's College Varsity Programs (arranged by date) |- !width=25%|College !width=14%|Athletic Affiliation !width=15%|Metro area !width=9%|Varsity since !width=40%|National achievements |- |California (Berkeley)\"Three UC Berkeley athletic teams to be preserved\", Berkeley News, February 11, 2011. | |Berkeley, CA |align=\"center\"|1882 |26 national championships since 1980, 5 CRC 7s championships |- |Paul Smiths College | |Paul Smiths, NY | align=\"center\" |2000 |2013 and 2017 ~ NSCRO Ranked Top 40 |- |Cal Maritime | |Vallejo, CA | align=\"center\" |2001 | NSCRO rank #1 (2009, 2010); runner up (2012)Cal Maritime, Cal Maritime's Highly Successful Rugby Coach Announces Departure, August 25, 2010, http://www.csum.edu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=1a48d66d-7506-4e55-aec4-88776bcd4a14&groupId;=61902 |- |Franciscan University | |Steubenville, OH | align=\"center\" |2001 |NSCRO Ranked #1 (2012); 3rd at Nationals |- |Norwich | |Northfield, VT | align=\"center\" |2008 | D2 national playoffs (2013) |- |American International CollegeAIC Rugby .

These women's rugby programs have received sanctioning by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The NCAA has identified women's rugby as an NCAA Emerging Sports for Women. An \"Emerging Sport\" must gain championship status (minimum 40 varsity programs for team sports, except 28 for Division III) within 10 years, or show steady progress toward that goal to remain on the list. Until then, it is under the auspices of the NCAA and its respective institutions. Emerging Sport status allows for competition to include club teams to satisfy the minimum number of competitions bylaw established by the NCAA. The NCAA identified women's rugby as an \"Emerging Sport\" in 2002 in light of the fact that nearly 350 collegiate women's rugby clubs were active.NCAA News Archive, Rugby advocates work to emerge from scrummage, July 2, 2007, http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/NCAANewsArchive/2007/Association- wide/rugby+advocates+work+to+emerge+from+scrummage+-+07-02-07+ncaa+news.html Growth was initially slow, with only 3 women's varsity programs forming within the first few years. The push for varsity rugby status received a boost in 2009 when the International Olympic Committee announced that rugby would return to the Summer Olympics in 2016. Although NCAA Division I programs dropped 72 women's varsity sports during 2008\u20132012 due to the economic recession,Washington Post, Maryland athletics' financial woes reveal a broken college sports revenue model, June 28, 2012, https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-06-28/sports/35459616_1_college- sports-maryland-athletics-public-universities women's rugby programs grew in number during that time frame. As of the fall of 2019, the NCAA has sanctioned rugby for 21 schools: eight in Division I, seven in Division II, and 6 in Division III.

In the past, college rugby competitions have been governed by local unions. The structure of the college game has evolved significantly in recent years. In an effort to increase the marketability of the game, many traditional rivals have been consolidated into conferences resembling major NCAA conferences such as the Pac-12 and Big Ten.Cal superleague exit spurs conference gains - Gainline.usACC launch unveiled, national league gains steam - Gainline.usRugby, Rugby, The Future of D1-A Rugby, May 22, 2012, http://www.rugbyrugby.com/news/features/this_is_american_rugby/7003152/the_future_of_di_a_rugby ==Conferences and conference tournaments== Beginning around 2010, college rugby programs began realigning into conference structures that mirror the traditional NCAA conferences used by the member schools' other athletic programs. The first high-profile example was the formation of the Ivy League Rugby Conference in 2010. Following the organization of the Ivy League schools, the members of the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Southeastern Conference followed suit in 2010. ===Ivy Rugby Conference=== The Ivy Rugby Conference was formed and had its first full season in 2009.Ivy Rugby Conference, About Ivy Rugby, http://www.ivyrugby.com/about-ivy-rugby The IRC was formed to foster better competition among rugby teams from the Ivy League schools and to raise the quality of play.Ivy Rugby, http://www.ivyrugby.com/about-ivy-rugby The IRC has had consistent success in attracting commercial interests. The IRC formed committees to manage the league, independently of the LAUs and TUs. Prior to formation of the IRC, clubs from the eight Ivy League schools had competed in the Ivy Rugby Championship Tournament since 1969. ===Atlantic Coast Rugby League=== The formation of the Atlantic Coast Rugby League was announced in March 2010, beginning play in the spring 2011 season. The purpose behind the formation of the ACRL was for the Atlantic Coast schools to schedule rugby union matches against other regional schools, which would both reduce travel and create more competitive matchups with traditional college rivalries.ACI Rugby, University Men's Rugby Clubs Form New Atlantic Coast Rugby League, March 17, 2010, Maryland won the 2011 inaugural ACRL, defeating North Carolina in the title match.The Atlantic Coast Rugby League, 2011 All ACRL Teams announced, April 21, 2011, http://www.atlanticcoastrugby.com/1/post/2011/4/2011-all-acrl-teams- announced.html The Atlantic Coast Rugby League schools started moving in the direction of setting up their own conference in 2008, beginning with the Atlantic Coast Invitational (ACI) tournament. The ACI tournament changed to a sevens format in 2010. N.C. State won the 2010 tournament. Beginning in 2011, the winner of the Atlantic Coast Invitational has advanced to the USA Rugby National Championship.ACI Rugby, Winner of Atlantic Coast Invitational Will Advance to USA Rugby Men's Collegiate Sevens Championship, March 17, 2010, N.C.

By April 2010 the SCRC had expanded to 11 schools, comprising the entire membership of the NCAA's Southeastern Conference (SEC) at that time except for Arkansas. Tennessee won the 2010 Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Sevens Championship beating LSU 19-17, and repeated in the 2011 SCRC Olympic Sevens Championship, beating Florida 26-14 in the final. Similar to other conferences, the SCRC has also enjoyed commercial success, announcing in fall 2010 that the SCRC had formed commercial partnership agreements with Adidas and the World Rugby Shop.Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference, The Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference, formed by the aforementioned 11 SEC schools, was created in late 2010 and began play in the 2011\u201312 season. Florida won the conference title in the inaugural season, defeating Tennessee in the championship match. Although the SEC has since expanded to 14 schools, the SCRC membership remains at 11. ===Pacific Athletic Conference=== Several members of the Pac-12 conference agreed in spring 2012 to form a conference beginning play in the 2012\u201313 season.Rugby Mag, Pac-12 Rugby On the Horizon, May 27, 2012, ===Other conferences=== Nine D1A rugby programs currently compete in the Big Ten Universities conference, which was founded in 2012. The Red River Conference, which replaced the Allied Rugby Conference in 2014\u201315, is composed mostly of teams from what had been the Big 12 South from 1996 to 2011. The Southwest Conference (SWC) was created in 2011 with the charter members from seven Texas schools. University of Texas was immediately added, and Texas won the conference in the inaugural 2011\u201312 season. ==Other competitions: rivalry trophies== College rugby includes rivalry trophies such as the World Cup between the University of California, Berkeley and the University of British Columbia (Canada),http://www.wearerugby.com/news/articles/cal-retains-world- cup the Wasatch Cup between BYU and Utah,The Wasatch Cup-College Rugby's Rivalry the University Cup between Texas and Texas A&M;,Texas And A&M; Go All Rivalry On Us \u00bb Rugby In Texas the Koranda Cup between Yale and Princeton, and the Common Wealth Shield between Virginia and Virginia Tech. ==Other competitions: Bowl Series== The ACRC Bowl Series annual championship 15s tournament takes place in November. College conference champions and select elite sides participate. The tournament provides an opportunity for teams to play outside of their conferences, and is therefore important to establishing final fall 15s college rankings. == Division II == Division II is governed by USA Rugby. ===Men=== *1995 \u2013 Lock Haven University *1996 \u2013 Salisbury *1997 \u2013 Salisbury *1998 \u2013 UC San Diego; runner-up \u2013 Univ. of Oregonhttps://174.132.42.136/past-champions/216-past-champions-men.html *1999 \u2013 UC San Diego 21 \u2013 Chico St. 18 *2000 \u2013 Sacramento State 49, Claremont 3 *2001 \u2013 Baylor 29, Arkansas State 16 *2002 \u2013 Stanford 26, Northern Iowa 15 *2003 \u2013 Radford 32, Northern Colorado 22 *2004 \u2013 Salisbury 43, Arkansas State 24 *2005 \u2013 Northern Colorado 24, Humboldt State 22 *2006 \u2013 Coast Guard 17, Northern Colorado 12 *2007 \u2013 Middlebury 38, Arkansas State 22 *2008 \u2013 Radford 25, Utah Valley State 14 *2009 \u2013 Middlebury 27, Wisconsin 11 *2010 \u2013 Claremont 25, Temple 19 (Claremont promoted to Div. 1) *2011 \u2013 UW-Whitewater 7, Middlebury 3 *2012 \u2013 Lindenwood 50, Salisbury 12 (Lindenwood promoted to Div. 1-AA) *2013 (Spring) \u2013 Salisbury 34, Minnesota-Duluth 17Rugby Mag, Salisbury Stonewalls Duluth, Wins DII, May 12, 2013, http://www.rugbymag.com/men's-dii- college-/8022-salisbury-stonewalls-duluth-wins-dii.html * 2013 (Fall) \u2013 Minnesota-Duluth 31, Salisbury 7http://usarugby.org/college- news/item/minnesota-duluth-gains-redemption-wins-division-ii-championship * 2014 \u2013 Minnesota-Duluth 24, UW-Whitewater 14 * 2015 \u2013 Minnesota-Duluth 25, UW- Whitewater 19 * 2016 \u2013 UW-Whitewater 29, Furman 13 * 2017 \u2013 UW-Whitewater 34, VMI 27 * 2018 \u2013 North Carolina State University 52, UW-Whitewater 17https://www.florugby.com/articles/6276873-nc-state-slams-whitewater- takes-d2-title ===Women=== *2000 \u2013 Plymouth State, runner-up East Stroudsburg *2001 \u2013 Northern Iowa, runner-up Nevada-Reno *2002 \u2013 Northern Iowa, runner-up Minnesota *2003 \u2013 Dayton, runner-up Northern Iowa *2004 \u2013 Temple 17, Providence 7 *2005 \u2013 Providence 15, Temple 10 *2006 \u2013 UC Santa Cruz 22, Plymouth State 10 *2007 \u2013 Iowa State 26, UC Santa Cruz 19 *2008 \u2013 Shippensburg 47, Minnesota-Duluth 0 *2009 \u2013 Shippensburg 29, Stonehill 5 *2010 \u2013 Washington State 37, Temple 0 *2011 \u2013 Radcliffe 22, University of Notre Dame (South Bend, IN) 10 *2012 \u2013 Norwich 82, Winona State 12Norwich : Women's Rugby: Norwich claims USA Rugby DII title *2013 \u2013 Washington State 60, Winona State 5USA Rugby: Women's Division II *2014 \u2013 Mary Washington 36, Cal State, Northridge 22Mary Washington finishes Women's Division II National Championship run with defeat of Cal State Northridge *2015 \u2013 Notre Dame College 69, UC-Riverside 10 *2016 \u2013 Davenport 61, USC 0 *2017 \u2013 Davenport 71, Kennesaw State 5 *2017\u201318 (fall) Winona State 38, Vassar 36 :(spring) Tulane 31, Claremont 14 ===Division II Sevens=== ;USA Rugby ;Men *2013: Principia def.
