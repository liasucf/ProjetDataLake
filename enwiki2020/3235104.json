    "text": "The Bupa Cromwell Hospital is a private sector hospital located in the South Kensington area of London. ==History== The hospital, which was designed by Holder Mathias, was established by Bank of Credit and Commerce International to provide healthcare for the Abu Dhabi royal family in April 1981. The finance for the construction of this purpose-built facility was arranged by Pakistani banker and philanthropist Agha Hasan Abedi. The hospital was bought by the private health and care specialist Bupa and renamed as the \"Bupa Cromwell Hospital\" in 2008. Bupa marketed the hospital as a health destination for patients from the Middle East. In 2011, it was reported that almost half of the hospital's patients were from the Middle East and in 2015 about 40% of its earnings came from overseas patients. ==Famous patients== The hospital has established an international reputation for treating liver and kidney infections. In 1987, two Rover SD1s of the Metropolitan Police Service set a record by transporting a liver transplant from London Stansted Airport to the hospital, completing the 27 mile journey in under 30 minutes, to save the life of Ms Aliza Hillel in a journey subsequently nick-named the Liver Run. Patients have included: *The Nigerian musician and playwright Chief Hubert Ogunde, who died at the hospital in April 1990 *The English actress Margaret Lockwood, who died from liver disease in the hospital in July 1990 *The Pakistani musician Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, who died from a cardiac arrest at the hospital in August 1997 *The former footballer George Best, who died from multiple organ failure at the hospital in November 2005 *The former First Lady of Kenya Lucy Kibaki, who died of a heart attack at the hospital in April 2016 == See also == * Healthcare in London * List of hospitals in England *Hashim U.
