    "text": "North Lathrop is a future Altamont Corridor Express station in Lathrop, California \u2013 the second to be constructed in the city. Whereas the original Lathrop/Manteca station was sited as a compromise to draw commuters from both cities, this station is located closer to residential areas. North Lathrop is designed as a transfer station to allow passengers from San Joaquin Valley shuttle trains to transfer to services bound for San Jose. It is expected to open to revenue service in 2023 as part of the first phase of ACE's expansion to Merced. The station is also planned to serve as the first phase northern terminus of Valley Link, a project by the Tri-Valley-San Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority to build a rail connection to Bay Area Rapid Transit's Dublin/Pleasanton station. ==References== Category:Lathrop, California Category:Future Altamont Corridor Express stations Category:Altamont Corridor Express stations in San Joaquin County, California Category:Railway stations scheduled to open in 2023 ",
