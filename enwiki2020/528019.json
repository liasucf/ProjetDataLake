    "text": "Playing It Straight is a 2004 American reality show in which one woman spent time on a ranch with a group of men in an attempt to discern which of them were gay and which of them were straight. All of the gay men pretended to be straight. The woman went on individual dates with the men, in addition to engaging in group activities with them. Over the course of the episodes, she voted to eliminate the men she believed to be gay. At the end of the show, the woman had to choose one man. If he was straight, the man and woman would split the prize money, but if he was gay, then he would receive all the money and the woman would receive nothing. ==Fox== The show was first broadcast in the United States on the Fox Network and premiered on March 12, 2004. The program was set on a Nevada ranch, and featured Jackie, a college student. Jackie spent time with 14 men (some gay, some straight) with a chance to win $1 million. If Jackie picked a straight man, they would both split the money, but if she picked a gay man, he would win the entire $1 million. Fox aired only three episodes before pulling the show from its schedule.https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2004/03/fox- fox_pulls_playing/ ===Contestants=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
