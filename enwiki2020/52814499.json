    "text": "Rainy Wednesday Records was a record label created by novelty artist Dickie Goodman in 1973. ==Creation== \"Energy Crisis '74\" was a Top 40 hit in 1974In his long career an artist and producer, Goodman released records under a slew of label names, including Luniverse (as Buchanan and Goodman in the late 50s), Rori, Mark-X, 20th Century and Cotique. In 1973, Goodman met the label's co- founder on a rainy Wednesday in New York, providing its name. Goodman started the label number at 201, the area code of his New Jersey residence at the time. All but one of Rainy Wednesday's releases were in Goodman's standard \"break-in\" style, in which an interviewer asks a question, only to have it \"answered\" with a snippet of a current hit record. (The only non-\"break in\" recording released was a straight cover of Sheb Wooley's \"The Purple People Eater\", a #1 hit from 1958.) Goodman himself and John & Ernest (a black duo whose records consisted of soul-oriented snippets and the original funk tune \"Crossover\" on one the flip sides) were the only two artists to appear on Rainy Wednesday. ==Discography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
