    "text": "George Brown (27 April 1783 \u2013 25 June 1857) was an English professional cricketer who played first-class cricket from 1819 to 1838. A right-handed batsman and fast underarm bowler who played for Hampshire and Sussex, he made 51 known appearances in first-class matches. He represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series. Brown was credited with 89 wickets in his career (i.e., bowled only) with a best return of six in one innings. He had a reputation for extreme pace and was widely known as \"Brown of Brighton\". He is said, though the story may be apocryphal, to have once killed a dog when a ball he had bowled went past the stumps and through a coat held by the longstop, hitting the dog which was behind the coat.Altham, p. 57. Another of his longstops, a man called Dench, insisted on fielding with a sack of straw tied to his chest for protection.Frith, p.28. E H Budd played against both Brown and Walter Marcon, who had a similar reputation, and Budd said that \"Brown was not more terrific in his speed than Marcon\", an elaborate way of saying that they were both extremely fast.Frith, p.41. Brown was a useful batsman and made 1053 runs at 11.44 with a top score of 70 which he scored during the first of the three roundarm trial matches. He died in Winchester, Hampshire. ==References== Category:1783 births Category:1857 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1787 to 1825 Category:English cricketers of 1826 to 1863 Category:Players cricketers Category:Hampshire cricketers Category:Sussex cricketers Category:People from Chichester District Category:Left-Handed v Right-Handed cricketers Category:The Bs cricketers Category:Non-international England cricketers ",
