Despite not starting, Daum averaged 15.2 points and 6.2 rebounds per game and was named the Summit League's Sixth Man of the Year and first-team all-conference.

After averaging 25.1 points and 8.1 rebounds per game, Daum made good on this prediction by winning the conference Player of the Year award at the conclusion of the season.
