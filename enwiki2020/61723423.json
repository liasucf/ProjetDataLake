    "text": "A rainbow baby is a term for a child born to a family who have previously lost a child due to miscarriage, stillbirth or death during infancy. These subsequent pregnancies can bring \"strong feelings of anxiety, guilt, and even fear\" but also \"immense joy, reflection, healing, and mixed emotions\". The term \"rainbow\" is symbolic of the hope brought by the child after the storm of the previous loss. Research conducted at the University of Michigan establishes that \"parental relationships have a higher risk of dissolving after a miscarriage or stillbirth, compared with a live birth\", and that the risk is highest for those couples who have experienced a stillbirth. In the 21st century, such parents seeking to have another child often turn to online support groups for information and encouragement. According to physician Jennifer Kulp-Makarov, \"It is an extremely emotional and devastating experience to lose a pregnancy or baby. To create a life or bring a baby into the world after such a loss is amazing like a miracle for these parents\u201d. Those interested in supporting such families have designated August 22 each year as \"National Rainbow Baby Day\". Some professional photographers volunteer to take free photos of these babies. In some cases, these are group photographs. == References == Category:Family Category:Childbirth Category:Stillbirth Category:Miscarriage Category:Grief ",
