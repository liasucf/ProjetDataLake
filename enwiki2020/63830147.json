She left Rio de Janeiro on 12 December 1782 and was never seen again. Stores identified as belonging to Cato were later seen on vessels trading in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea. The English captain of a vessel belonging to Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah, the Nawab of Arcot, reported in 1791 that he had seen stores that had come from Cato on a Malay boat at Mecca. The Malay on the boat stated that a large ship had wrecked some years earlier on the Malabar Coast. The Malay believed that most of those aboard her had gotten safely ashore but that the Malay king there had most of them put to death immediately.Naval Chronicle Vol.3, pp.40\u201341. ==Citations and references== Citations References * * Category:1782 ships Category:Ships built in England Category:Ships of the Royal Navy Category:Maritime incidents in 1783 Category:Missing ships Category:Ships lost with all hands ",
