Peking Duck) is an eminent Serbian and former Yugoslav punk rock band from Novi Sad. Their debut album, Plitka poezija, released in 1980, is considered the first punk rock album by a band coming from Serbia. Being one of the first punk acts in Yugoslavia, they played a major role in opening doors for many bands that came after. On their second and last album, Strah od monotonije, released in 1981, they turned towards post-punk and darkwave sound, disbanding during the same year. In 2008, the band reunited to perform on the main stage of Exit Festival alongside Sex Pistols, and in 2010, they reunited once again, continuing their activity. == History == === Trafo, Caf\u00e9 Express, band formation === Pekin\u0161ka Patka's roots are found in Trafo, a short-lived cover band formed in 1976 by electric guitarist Sreten Kova\u010devi\u0107 with Neboj\u0161a \u010conki\u0107 providing the vocals. Further featuring \u0160trc on bass and Zare on drums, the band performed rock standards covers of The Rolling Stones, Santana, Deep Purple, etc. The following year, Kova\u010devi\u0107 formed Caf\u00e9 Express, a pop band featuring \u010conki\u0107 as guest vocalist in addition to Boba Mama on guitar, Aleksandar \u010cerevicki on keyboards, Aleksandar Kravi\u0107 on bass, Laslo \"Cila\" Pihler (Shital Puri) on drums, and vocalist Aleksandar Krsti\u0107. During early summer 1978, \u010conki\u0107 (nicknamed Profesor \u010conta), at the time 25-year-old teacher at Mihajlo Pupin High School in Novi Sad, visited London where, among various acts, he saw The Clash, The Specials, Midge Ure, Glen Matlock's Rich Kids, The Skids, and Magazine perform live, before returning home to Yugoslavia full of impressions and ideas about putting together a band with a new sound. In July 1978, Kova\u010devi\u0107, drummer Laslo \"Cila\" Pihler, and \u010conki\u0107 decided to form a punk rock group inspired by the British punk bands. The first lineup also featured bass guitarist Milo\u0161 \"\u017dure\" \u017duri\u0107. The band held rehearsals at the University of Novi Sad's Faculty of Mechanical Engineering building where their first live performance took place. Four people attended the gig, all of them friends of the band members. After that, \u010conki\u0107 and Kova\u010devi\u0107 started working on new material, mainly in Serbian language. Soon, Srbislav \"Srba\" Dobanova\u010dki became the new bass guitarist. === Local prominence in Novi Sad === The band's first official live appearance took place in December 1978 at Novi Sad's Klub 24 venue and immediately got the local public talking due to the commotion it raised among the club's staff who were sufficiently shocked by the performance that they decided to put a stop to it, sending the crowd of about 200 youngsters home. The immediate reason was the band's performance of an impromptu vulgar punk cover of a communist youth work action song featuring the modified lyrics \"Bri\u017eit Bardo bere \u010di\u010dke; Vidi joj se pola pi\u010dke\" (\"Brigitte Bardot is picking thistles; half of her pussy is hanging out\"). The band based their act on melodic punk and vivid public image with high-energy live shows featuring constant jumping and gyrating that had a strong effect on the young crowds. Being one of the first groups in the country with this kind of sound and performing style, they attracted media interest before releasing any material. \u010conki\u0107 often used those media appearances for self-promotion, delivering sweeping statements like: \"We're the first important thing to happen to Yugoslav rock since the days of Ivo Robi\u0107 and Marko Novoseli\u0107\". He also purposely courted controversy with soundbites such as referring to his group as the \"first Orthodox punk band\", which went against the doctrine of the ruling Communist League (SKJ) that very much promoted atheism in Yugoslav society. The band quickly developed a cult following among the sections of Novi Sad youth who expressed their devotion by spraying \"\u010conta je Bog\" (\"\u010conta is God\") graffiti throughout the city. All of this unconventionality also got the band plenty of attention from local communist authorities who saw subversive and incendiary potential in their sound and appearance. As a result, despite generating a lot of interest, not only in the city but also throughout other parts of Vojvodina, the band experienced problems with live performances, many of which would get canceled on the day of the show on suggestions from the authorities. In December 1978, the band played the last BOOM Festival, which was being held in their hometown that year. === Wider popularity and first releases === The band appeared at the Festival Omladina with the song \"Bela \u0161ljiva\". Vesna Vrande\u010di\u0107 (later to join Xenia) won the festival's main award, but Pekin\u0161ka Patka got the Audience Award. Their whole performance was broadcast on national television which was the first TV appearance of any punk band in Yugoslavia. This raised their profile as far as Yugoslav recording companies were concerned; they started negotiating with PGP-RTB label about a debut album, but ultimately could not reach a deal. The band continued playing and soon developed a wider following in bigger Yugoslav cities: Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb. They eventually signed with Jugoton after its representatives saw them perform at Zagreb's Kulu\u0161i\u0107 club. The first Pekin\u0161ka Patka release became a vinyl 7-inch single (2-side) \"Bela \u0161ljiva\" / \"Biti ru\u017ean, pametan i mlad\" produced by Slobodan Konjovi\u0107. Relatively good reception of that single, with 35,000 copies sold, paved the way for them to begin recording a full-length debut album. In October 1979, the band was invited to perform in the village of Stepanovi\u0107evo at the anniversary celebration of the end of World War II. The band performed their standard set- list and the show also featured blowing of condoms and throwing them to the audience as well as swearing on stage that was met with a mixture of shock and delight by the audience. Another punk rock band, Gomila G (a censored version of their original name Gomila Govana, trans. Pile of Shit), which played as the opening act, performed the song \"God save Martin Bormann\", which was also the reason why the authorities and the media turned against the two bands. Soon after the show, Gomila G bassist Borislav \"Bora\" Oslov\u010dan joined Pekin\u0161ka Patka as replacement for Dobanova\u010dki. Together they recorded a demo, consisting of seven tracks, which was unofficially released during the 1990s. The new lineup also performed at the Leto na Adi manifestation, which was held at a luxurious raft at Ada Ciganlija, with the song \"Poderimo rock\". Since the crowd rushed to the stage and jumped around, the raft almost sank. The album Plitka poezija (Shallow Poetry), a punk rock material with occasional ska elements and humorous lyrics, was completed by fall 1979, but Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito's illness postponed the release until summer 1980. It was ushered in by another 7-inch single, \"Bolje da nosim kratku kosu\" / \"Ori, ori\". The whole material was recorded in the Boris Kova\u010d studio, outside Novi Sad, and was produced by Slobodan Konjovi\u0107, well known disc jockey from Studio B radio station. Eventually, their debut album was released in 1980 and sold about 15,000 copies, which Jugoton considered a failure. One of the first live presentations of the new material was at the Split festival with the band Azra. Several thousand people attended the concert. The relations within the band were somewhat strained at this gig. Dissatisfied with the band's decision to go on tour of Bosnia and Herzegovina, bassist Oslov\u010dan played with his back turned to the crowd, while actively sabotaging the proceedings by purposely making the band sound as bad as possible. === Lineup changes, post-punk period === Following the debut album release, the band went through some personnel changes with some members changing instruments and others leaving altogether. Guitarist Kova\u010devi\u0107 expressed a desire to play saxophone so he moved to that instrument while new member Zoran \"Bale\" Bulatovi\u0107, a 17-year-old Pe\u010dat member, took over the vacated guitar spot. Second guitarist Prosenica, and bassist Oslov\u010dan also left the band. Oslov\u010dan was first replaced by Aleksandar \"Caki\" Kravi\u0107 and then the former bassist Srba Dobanova\u010dki until Marinko Vukmanovi\u0107 joined the band. Prosenica's spot stayed vacant as the band continued with only one guitar. That lineup did not last long as Kova\u010devi\u0107 left the group during fall 1980 to form his own band, Kontraritam. The new lineup went on the successful Bosnia and Herzegovina tour, ending with a sold- out show at Sarajevo's Skenderija Hall. The band recorded the cover of the popular Dragan Stojni\u0107 chanson \"Bila je tako lijepa\", with altered lyrics, and released it on single with \"Buba-rumba\" as the B-side. Another cover version, this time The Hollies' hit \"Stop! Stop! Stop!\", appeared on the \"Rokenroler\" show broadcast on TV Belgrade. The song was used by JRT (Yugoslav Radio Television) station for representing Yugoslavia at the Montreux Rose d'Or festival. \u010conki\u0107 also planned to cover the \"Hymn to Saint Sava\", which was not approved by the rest of the band. During December 1980, the band performed at the Grok festival held at the Novi Sad Fair. The band left a good impression, but also caused an uproar by burning a copy of the Borba newspaper. During the intro for the song \"Biti ru\u017ean, pametan i mlad\", \u010conki\u0107 said that the song was dedicated to Bijelo Dugme leader Goran Bregovi\u0107. Soon after the show, Dnevnik journalist Bogdan \u010cetnik wrote an article demanding the band to be completely banned. From October 1980 until March 1981 the band prepared new material inspired by Joy Division, The Stranglers, The Cure and Magazine. The band changed the style to post-punk and dark wave, presenting a different sound and image, which mostly failed to connect with the audiences the way their debut did. The album Strah od monotonije (Fear of Monotony), released in May 1981, was sold in about 8,000 copies. The band performed rarely and their last notable shows were at a large concert at Zagreb Velesajam (performing with Riblja \u010corba, Haustor, Film, Prljavo kazali\u0161te, Leb i Sol, Parni Valjak, and other bands) and the Kalemegdan park which was their last concert, During the summer, \u010conki\u0107 went to serve the Yugoslav People's Army and by the time he returned, Bulatovi\u0107 was already the member of Luna and Vukmanovi\u0107 formed the pop band Primavera. === Post-breakup and reunions === In 1994, \u010conki\u0107 emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada with his family and, after working as a pizza deliverer and computer programmer at Canada's state broadcaster CBC, he got a job as lecturer at Seneca College in Toronto. Bulatovi\u0107 moved to New York City during the 1990s. In 1997, their complete discography, including singles and albums, was re-released on CD format by Croatia Records (legal successor of Jugoton). Then on July 5, 2006, the same was done by Serbian Multimedia Records at which time the band got a significant promotional push from Serbian web magazine Popboks. On May 28, 2008, it was announced that Pekin\u0161ka Patka would be reuniting to perform at the 2008 EXIT festival. Their performance took place on EXIT main stage on Sunday July 13, 2008 - the festival's closing night - together with Sex Pistols, The Hives, and Ministry.Pekin\u0161ka Patka: Stari pankeri bez sakoa, Popboks, July 14, 2008 Pekin\u0161ka Patka played a 40-minute set consisting of old favorites. In the interviews immediately after the reunion performance, \u010conki\u0107 left the door open for a full comeback.\u201eSex Pistols\u201c iz temelja drmali Tvr\u0111avu, Blic, July 14, 2008 After pulling out of a Novi Sad performance for New Year's 2010, the band decided to reconvene again for a show on 21 May 2010 at Belgrade's SKC\u201ePekin\u0161ka patka\u201c 21. maja u SKC; Blic, 28 April 2010 in order to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the \"Bila je tako lijepa\" single release. The band reunited in the lineup which recorded the single and the second studio album, Strah od monotonije, and after the Belgrade performance, they played at the Zagreb Boogaloo club. On May 5, at a press conference, the band announced the release of a cover album, featuring songs performed at the Yugoslav 1960s pop festivals such as the Opatija, Beogradsko Prole\u0107e and Va\u0161 \u0160lager Sezone.\"Povratak iz istorije Pekin\u0161ke patke\", Popboks.com A few days before the upcoming concert in Belgrade, the first lineup guitarist, and the co- founding member of the band, Sreten Kova\u010devi\u0107, announced suing the band over the usage of the name Pekin\u0161ka Patka as well as the performance of the songs from the Plitka poezija album for which he is credited as author in SOKOJ (The Serbian Copyright Protection Organization).\"\u010cija je Patka?\", Popboks.com In the response to the announcement, the band responded at the Long Play record label official site with the explanation that \u010conki\u0107 has the right to the band name, and that in July 1980, without previously informing the rest of the band, Kova\u010devi\u0107 had signed co-authorship to the debut album tracks at SOKOJ, thus the information on the authorship and at SOKOJ mismatch.Pekin\u0161ka Patka announcement at longplay.rs Both the Belgrade and Zagreb performances featured the band playing most of the tracks from Plitka poezija, with the exception of the song \"Bolje da nosim kratku kosu\" written by Kova\u010devi\u0107 according to SOKOJ, the upcoming single, the cover version of Luz Casal song \"Un a\u00f1o de amor\", and the song \"Neko\", from the second album Strah od monotonije.\"PEKIN\u0160KA PATKA U SKC-u: Novi sako za pankera\", Popboks.com\"Patke i dalje lete kontra glavne struje\", Muzika.hr However, the Belgrade performance did not feature Pihler on drums, and the substitute drummer was Veliki Prezir drummer Robert Radi\u0107.
