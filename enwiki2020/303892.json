    "text": "Enrique Miguel Iglesias Preysler (; born 8 May 1975) is a Spanish singer, songwriter, actor, and record producer who is known as the King of Latin Pop. He began his career during the mid-1990s on American Spanish-language record label Fonovisa Records under the stage name Enrique Martinez, before switching to his notable surname Iglesias. His father Julio Iglesias was a very successful singer and Iglesias wanted to make it on his own without receiving benefits from his family name. By the turn of the millennium, after becoming one of the biggest stars in Latin America and the Hispanic market in the United States, he made a successful crossover into the US mainstream market. He signed a multi-album deal with Universal Music Group for US$68 million with Universal Music Latino to release his Spanish albums and Interscope Records to release English albums. In 2010, Iglesias parted with Interscope Records and signed with another Universal Music Group label, Republic Records, to release bilingual albums. In 2015, he parted ways with Universal Music Group after being there for over a decade. He signed with Sony Music and his subsequent albums were to be released by Sony Music Latin in Spanish and RCA Records in English. Iglesias is one of the best-selling Latin music artists with estimated sales of over 70 million records worldwide. He has had five Billboard Hot 100 top five singles, including two number-ones, and holds the record for producing 27 number-one Spanish-language singles on the Billboards Hot Latin Tracks. As of October 2020, Iglesias holds the number-one position on the Greatest of All-Latin Artists charts. Iglesias also has 14 number-ones on Billboards Dance charts, more than any other male artist. In December 2016, Billboard magazine named him the 14th most successful and top male dance club artist of all time. ==Early life and family== Iglesias was born in Madrid, Spain, and is the third and youngest child of Spanish singer Julio Iglesias and Filipina socialite and magazine journalist Isabel Preysler. His father Julio is recognized as the most commercially successful continental European singer in the world. Iglesias was raised with two older siblings, Ch\u00e1beli and Julio Jr. One of his mother's aunts is actress Neile Adams, the first wife of American actor Steve McQueen, mother of actor Chad McQueen, and grandmother of actor Steven R. McQueen. His father\u2018s family is from Galicia and Andalusia; his father also claims some Jewish and Puerto Rican ancestry on his mother's side. Iglesias found out later in life that he was born with a rare congenital condition known as situs inversus where some of the body's major organs, such as the heart, are situated on the opposite side of the body from normal. At first, Iglesias and his two siblings stayed with their mother, but in December 1981, Iglesias' grandfather, Dr. Julio Iglesias Puga, was kidnapped by the armed Basque group ETA. For their safety, Enrique and his brother Julio were sent to live with their father and his girlfriend at the moment, Venezuelan top model Virginia Sipli, in Miami. There, they were brought up mostly by the nanny, Elvira Olivares, to whom Enrique later dedicated his first album. As his father's career kept him on the road, the young Iglesias was raised by the family nanny. He attended the prestigious Gulliver Preparatory School and later went on to study business at the University of Miami. Iglesias did not want his father to know about his plans for a musical career and did not want his famous surname to help advance his career. He borrowed money from his family nanny and recorded a demo cassette tape which consisted of a Spanish song and two English songs. Approaching his father's former publicist, Fern\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, the two promoted the songs under the stage name 'Enrique Mart\u00ednez', with the backstory of being a singer from Guatemala. Iglesias was signed on to Fonovisa Records. After dropping out of college, he traveled to Toronto to record his first album. ==Music career== ===1995\u20131996: Enrique Iglesias=== On 12 July 1995, Iglesias released Enrique Iglesias, a collection of light rock ballads, including hits such as \"Si T\u00fa Te Vas\". This album, along with Iglesias' next two, was released by the Mexican label Fonovisa. The record sold half a million copies in its first week, a rare accomplishment then for an album recorded in a language other than English, going Gold in Portugal within the first week of release, and sold over a million copies in the next three months. His song \"Por Amarte\" was included in Televisa's telenovela Marisol, but with a twist: instead of Por amarte dar\u00eda mi vida (To love you, I'd give my life), the words were Por amarte Marisol, morir\u00eda (To love you, Marisol, I'd die). The CD also yielded Italian and Portuguese editions, with most of the songs translated into those languages. Five singles were released from the album, such as \"Por Amarte\", \"No Llores Por M\u00ed\", and \"Trapecista\", which topped the Billboards Latin charts. The album went on to win Iglesias the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Performance. ===1997\u20131998: Vivir and Cosas del Amor=== In 1997, Iglesias' stardom continued to rise with the release of Vivir (To Live), which put him up with other English-language music superstars in sales for that year. The album also included a cover version of the Yazoo song \"Only You\", translated into Spanish as \"Solo en T\u00ed\". Three singles were released from Vivir: \"Enamorado Por Primera Vez\", \"S\u00f3lo en Ti\", and \"Miente\", which topped the Latin singles chart as well as those in several Spanish- speaking countries. Along with his father and Luis Miguel, Iglesias was nominated for an American Music Award in the first-ever awarded category of Favorite Latin Artist. Iglesias lost out to his father, but performed the song \"Lluvia Cae\" at the event. Insisting on playing stadiums for his first concert tour, that summer, Iglesias, backed by sidemen for Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, and Billy Joel, played to sold-out audiences in sixteen countries. Beginning in Odessa, Texas, the tour went on to play three consecutive nights in Mexico's Plaza de Toros, two consecutive nights at Monterrey's Auditorio Coca-Cola, and two at the Estadio River Plate in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to over 130,000 people, as well as 19 arenas in the U.S. In 1998, Iglesias released his third album Cosas del Amor (Things of Love). Taking a more mature musical direction, the album, aided by the popular singles \"Esperanza\" and \"Nunca Te Olvidar\u00e9\", both of which topped the Latin singles chart, helped cement his status in the Latin music scene. Iglesias did a short tour of smaller venues to accompany the release of the album, with one show being televised from Acapulco, Mexico. This was followed by a larger world tour of over eighty shows in even bigger venues. The Cosas del Amor Tour was the first ever concert tour sponsored by McDonald's. He won an American Music Award in the category of Favorite Latin Artist against Ricky Martin and Chayanne. The song \"Nunca te Olvidar\u00e9\" was also used as the theme music for a Spanish soap opera of the same name and he sang the song himself on the last episode of the series. ===1999\u20132001: Enrique and Escape=== By 1999, Iglesias had begun a successful crossover career into the English-language music market. Thanks to other successful crossover acts, most notably Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan, Latino artists and music had a great surge in popularity in mainstream music. After attending one of his concerts in March 1999, Will Smith asked Iglesias to contribute to the soundtrack of his movie Wild Wild West. His contribution \"Bailamos\" was released as a single and became a number one hit in the US. After the success of \"Bailamos\", several mainstream record labels were eager to sign Iglesias. Signing a multi-album deal after weeks of negotiations with Interscope, Iglesias recorded and released his first full CD in English, Enrique. The pop album, with some Latin influences, took two months to complete. It contained the song \"Rhythm Divine\", a duet with Whitney Houston entitled \"Could I Have This Kiss Forever\", and a cover of the Bruce Springsteen song \"Sad Eyes\". In 2000, Iglesias performed at the Super Bowl XXXIV halftime show alongside Christina Aguilera and Phil Collins. Shock jock Howard Stern repeatedly played a tape of a supposedly very off-key Iglesias on his radio show and accused him of not being able to sing live. On 8 June 2000, Iglesias sang the song live on Stern's show with just a guitar accompanying him. After the performance, Stern remarked, \"I respect you for coming in here; you really can sing\". Iglesias noted that the recording could have been him, but that it was probably a recording made during a television taping where he was required to lip sync and not sing properly. He would remark that the controversy was the best promotion he could have. The album's single \"Be with You\" became Iglesias' second number-one single on Billboards Hot 100. In 2001, Iglesias released his second English-language album Escape.\"ENRIQUE IGLESIAS Escape\". Chart Attack, Review by Brian Pascual, 6 November 2001. Where most of the Latin crossover acts of the previous year experienced some difficulty matching the record sales of their first English-language albums, Iglesias actually went on to sell even more. The album's first single, \"Hero\", became a number-one hit in the United Kingdom, and in many other countries. The entire album was co-written by Iglesias. Escape is his biggest commercial success to date. The singles \"Escape\" and \"Don't Turn Off the Lights\" became radio staples, placing highly or topping various charts both in North America and elsewhere. A second edition of the album was released internationally and contained a new version of one of Iglesias' favorite tracks, \"Maybe\", as well as a duet with Lionel Richie called \"To Love a Woman\". Iglesias capitalized on the album's success with his \"One-Night Stand World Tour\" consisting of fifty sold-out shows in sixteen countries. Including Radio City Music Hall and three consecutive nights in London's Royal Albert Hall, the tour ended with a big show at Lia Manoliu Stadium in Bucharest, Romania. The concert launched MTV Romania, with the video for \"Love to See You Cry\" being the first to be shown on the channel. The second leg of the tour, \"Don't Turn Off the Lights\", was completed in the summer of 2002, with two sold-out nights in Madison Square Garden and another two in Mexico's National Auditorium. The tour finished with a single show in the Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan, Puerto Rico. ===2002\u20132004: Quiz\u00e1s and 7=== Enrique Iglesias, Vilnius, Lithuania In 2002, Iglesias decided to release a fourth Spanish-language album titled Quiz\u00e1s (Perhaps). A more polished musical production than his previous Spanish albums and containing more introspective songs, the album's title track is a song about the strained relationship Iglesias has with his famous father. The album debuted at number twelve on the Billboard 200 albums chart, the highest placement of a Spanish-language album on the chart at that period. Quiz\u00e1s sold a million copies in a week, making it the fastest-selling album in Spanish in five years. The three singles released from the album all ended up topping the Latin chart, giving Iglesias a total of sixteen number ones on the chart. He currently holds the record for the most number-one singles on Billboards Latin Chart. His last single from the album, \"Para Qu\u00e9 La Vida\", reached a million spins on U.S. radio, the only Spanish-language song to do so. The video to the song \"Quiz\u00e1s\" was the first Spanish-language music video to be added to the selection on one of MTV's popular shows Total Request Live. Iglesias performed the song on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, becoming the first to sing a Spanish song on the show, and opening doors for other artists such as Ricky Martin, Juanes, and Jorge Drexler to perform their Spanish material. Iglesias included songs from Quiz\u00e1s in his \"Don't Turn Off the Lights Tour\", and the album went on to win the Latin Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. By 2003, Iglesias released his seventh album, which he called 7, the second to be co- written by him. Among its more 1980s-inspired material, it features the song \"Roamer\", which he wrote with his friend and longtime guitarist Tony Bruno. The CD also contained the song \"Be Yourself\", a song about independence; the chorus talks about how Iglesias' own parents did not believe he'd ever succeed in his singing career. The first single was the song \"Addicted\", and was followed closely by a remix of the song \"Not in Love\", featuring Kelis. With this album, Iglesias went on his biggest world tour to date. The highly publicised tour started with twelve shows in the United States ending with Iglesias playing at Houston Rodeo, and continued on to several countries, most of which he'd never previously visited, playing to sold-out arenas and stadiums in Australia, India, Egypt, and Singapore, before ending his tour in South Africa. ===2007\u20132009: Insomniac, 95/08 \u00c9xitos and Greatest Hits=== After a two-year hiatus, Iglesias released his new album Insomniac on 12 June 2007. The album was so named due to it being recorded mainly at night. The record had a more contemporary pop style than that of his previous albums. Its highlights include the songs \"Push\", with rapper Lil Wayne, as well as \"Ring My Bells\" and a cover of Ringside's \"Tired of Being Sorry\". The album's first single, \"Do You Know? (The Ping Pong Song)\", was released on 10 April 2007. It was Iglesias's highest-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100 since \"Escape\". The song was also a hit throughout Europe, peaking in the top 10 in many countries. The Spanish version of the song, entitled \"D\u00edmelo\", was number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart for eleven weeks, becoming his second best performing song on that chart at the time. Iglesias followed up with the ballad \"Somebody's Me\", which was released as a single in North America. The song was played extensively on AC radio and peaked high on Billboards Hot AC. In Europe, the second single was \"Tired of Being Sorry\", which performed well in many countries; he recorded a version of the song with French singer N\u00e2diya, which was number one in France for eleven weeks. On 4 July 2007, Enrique Iglesias became the first Western artist to play a concert in Syria in three decades when he performed for a sold-out crowd of ten thousand in the capital Damascus, and in the same week, he performed on Live Earth in Hamburg. The Insomniac World Tour was launched at the Coca-Cola Dome in Johannesburg, South Africa, the same venue he ended his last world tour, and took him to sold-out arenas throughout Europe. It was his first arena tour of the UK, with him playing venues such as Manchester's MEN Arena and Wembley Arena. The tour ended with Iglesias performing at the newly opened L.A. Live. A second leg of the tour took him throughout Latin America, from Mexico to Argentina. A solo version of \"Push\" was added to the soundtrack of the movie Step Up 2 the Streets. The song was regarded as the third single from the album. A music video was shot, which features the film's lead actors. Despite never being officially added to radio, the song has charted in several countries and is one of his most highly rated songs amongst fans. Iglesias's song \"Can You Hear Me\" was chosen as the official song of the UEFA Euro 2008 football tournament. He performed the song live at the 29 June 2008 final in Vienna, Austria. The song featured on a re-issue of Insomniac, which was released in certain countries. Iglesias in 2007 Iglesias released a Spanish greatest hits album named 95/08 \u00c9xitos on 25 March 2008, which included his seventeen number-one songs on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart plus two new songs. The first single was the song \"\u00bfD\u00f3nde Est\u00e1n Coraz\u00f3n?\", which was written by Argentine star Coti, and became Iglesias's eighteenth number-one single on Billboards Hot Latin Songs. The album debuted at number one on Billboards Top Latin Albums chart and number eighteen on the overall Billboard 200 albums chart. It was Iglesias's second Spanish album to debut in the top 20 of the Billboard 200 (Quiz\u00e1s debuted at number twelve in 2002). The album was certified double Platinum (Latin field) in the U.S. and in some Latin American countries. The record's second single, \"Lloro Por Ti\", also reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart and had an official remix featuring Wisin & Yandel. Iglesias did a tour of the US to promote the compilation. Beginning in Laredo, Texas, and ending at the Izod Center in New Jersey, he was accompanied through most of the tour with bachata band Aventura, who also performed \"Lloro Por Ti\" with him at the 2008 Premios Juventud. Iglesias was a surprise performer at the 2008 Lo Nuestro Awards, opening the show with a medley of \"\u00bfD\u00f3nde Est\u00e1n Coraz\u00f3n?\" and \"D\u00edmelo\". He also performed at the Billboard Latin Music Awards, where he received a special award. After the success of his Spanish greatest hits compilation, Iglesias released a compilation of his English-language hits on 11 November. The album includes \"Can You Hear Me\" as well as two new songs. The first single, \"Away\", features Sean Garrett, and was followed by \"Takin' Back My Love\", featuring Ciara.
