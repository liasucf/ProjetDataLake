Pal, along with Ranen Ganguly, a member of Atmonnati Samiti, succeed in the mission. They killed Nandalal on November 9, 1908 in Serpentine Lane, Kolkata and fled. == Rodda arms robbery == Shrish Pal took active participation in the Rodda company arms heist case. On 26 August 1914, a group of Bengali revolutionaries stole many Mauser pistols and cartridges from the Kidderpore Dock area. The whole operation was led by Shrish Chandra Mitra, alias Habu. Pal, Khagendra Nath Das, and Haridas Dutta kept the arms safe place in a hilarious way. Finally, the police arrested Shrish Pal in 1916 but could not prove his involvement in the Nandalal murder case.
