The homestead is now considered a potential archaeological site. He was an Onondaga County, New York, doctor after 1823 and in 1865 an officer in the county medical society.* Joslyn was a founding member of the Liberty Party, an early advocate of abolitionism founded in the 1840s. His daughter Matilda Joslyn Gage was a suffragist as well as a prominent abolitionist. Their home in Fayetteville, New York, where Hezekiah died, was a station on the Underground Railroad. His tombstone near his former home in Cicero reads \"AN EARLY ABOLITIONIST\". Hezekiah was the grandfather and Matilda mother of L. Frank Baum, author of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * * * Category:American abolitionists Category:American people of Scottish descent Category:Physicians from New York (state) Category:People from Cicero, New York Category:19th-century American physicians Category:Liberty Party (United States, 1840) politicians Category:1797 births Category:1865 deaths Category:Underground Railroad people ",
