The blaze, dubbed the Tenaja fire after igniting along Tenaja Road and Clinton Keith Road in La Cresta, forced the evacuation of over 1,200 people and lead to the closure of multiple school districts in the Murrieta, Perris and Lake Elsinore area due to the poor air quality.

Those evacuations included homes on The Trails Circle in La Cresta and the Santa Rosa Plateau Visitor Center.

The following day, the fire was reported to be 10% contained. Although the fire had remained calm throughout the early morning hours of Thursday, by the afternoon, the fire had flared up on several separate fronts and was expanding through Copper Canyon, where strong winds sent the fire line directly towards homes spurring additional evacuations along Montanya, Botanica and Belcara places and Lone Oak Way in Murrieta. It was at this time that two homes received minor damage from the fire. However, by 2:30 pm, fire activity had subsided considerably. By early Friday, September 6, the acreage of the fire was reported to have stagnated at and containment had increased to 20%.
