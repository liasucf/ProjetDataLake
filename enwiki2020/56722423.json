    "text": "Sigma (Science in General Management) was a limited company established by Henry Novy, Stafford Beer and Roger Eddison in 1961. It sold operational research OR in the United Kingdom and overseas. Beer was responsible for the cybernetic models of organisation and corporate planning which were the firm's specially. Eddison was the Operations Director. The consultancy arose following discussions between the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9conomie et de Math\u00e9matiques Appliqu\u00e9es (SEMA) and Martech Consultants Limited. Novy, who ran Maretch, was given the job of selecting the people to run the company, inviting several OR practitioners to come to Paris for an interview. After he selected Beer, Beer only agreed if Eddison would also join him. This was arranged and the company was launched with a reception at the Connaught Hotel in October 1961. Over the next five years Sigma developed into a substantial organisation providing services to several leading companies across the UK as well as for six government departments. It also took on contracts in the United States and several developing countries. Amongst the diverse areas it worked in were energy, for the Gas Council, transportation, for British Rail and the Port of London Authority, shipbuilding, for the Geddes Committee, education for Yugoslavia, tourism, for Israel, nationalised industry in South America, and distribution for a variety of industrial firms. Sigma, Martech, and Proplan were amalgamated to form what afterwards became the Metra Consulting Group in the United Kingdom. ==References== Category:Operations research ",
