He was made Master of the Royal Household of James IV of Scotland on 24 March 1495.Macdougall, Norman, James IV, Tuckwell (1997), 107, citing Register of the Great Seal, vol. 2, no. 2240. After a crisis of law and order in the west of Scotland, Argyll was made governor of Tarbert Castle and Baillie of Knapdale, and this was followed by an appointment as Royal Lieutenant in the former Lordship of the Isles on 22 April 1500.Macdougall, Norman, James IV, Tuckwell (1997), 178, citing Register of the Privy Seal, vol. 1, nos. 413, 513, 520. Argyll eventually rose to the position of Lord High Chancellor of Scotland. His \"clan\" was rivalled only by Clan Gordon. The Earls of Argyll were hereditary Sheriffs of Lorne and Argyll. However, a draft record of the 1504 Parliament of Scotland records a move to request Argyll to hold his Sherriff Court at Perth, where the King and his council could more easily oversee proceedings, if the Earl was found at fault. The historian Norman Macdougall suggests this clause may have been provoked by Argyll's kinship with Torquil MacLeod and MacLean of Duart.MacDougall, Norman, James IV, Tuckwell (1997), 184-5, citing Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol. 2, (1814), 241. These western chiefs supported the suppressed Lordship of the Isles. The Earl of Argyll was killed at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, with the king and many others. He is buried at Kilmun Parish Church. ==Family== By his wife Elizabeth, a daughter of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox, Argyll had issue:James Balfour Paul, Scots Peerage, vol i, pp 335-337 * Colin Campbell * Archibald Campbell of Skipness (d 1537 escaping from Edinburgh Castle), second husband of Janet Douglas, Lady Glamis * Sir John Campbell of Calder (d.1546) ancestor of the Earls Cawdor * Donald Campbell the Abbot of Coupar Angus * Margaret Campbell, who married John Erskine, 5th Lord Erskine * Isabel Campbell, married Gilbert Kennedy, 2nd Earl of Cassilis * Janet Campbell, married John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl * Jean Campbell, married Sir John Lamont of that ilk, son Duncan Lamont * Catherine Campbell, married Lachlan Cattanach Maclean, 11th Chief of Duart, secondly to Archibald Campbell of Auchinbreck * Marion Campbell, married Sir Robert Menzies of that ilk * Elen Campbell, married Sir Gavin Kennedy of Blairquhan * Mary Campbell, married James Stewart, 4th Earl of Bute ==References== Category:Lord Chancellors of Scotland 2 Category:Deaths at the Battle of Flodden Category:15th-century births Category:1513 deaths Category:Court of James IV of Scotland Category:Scottish landowners Category:Burials at the Argyll Mausoleum Category:15th-century Scottish peers Category:16th-century Scottish peers ",
