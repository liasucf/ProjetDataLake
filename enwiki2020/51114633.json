This building was demolished in 1947 to give space to a much larger church, designed by the architect Salvador Figueras, which opened in 1951. The church became a cathedral in 1996 as the seat of the newly-created Diocese of Ciego de \u00c1vila. The church's most distinctive feature is its facade. ==See also== *Roman Catholicism in Cuba ==References== Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Cuba Category:Buildings and structures in Ciego de \u00c1vila Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1951 ",
