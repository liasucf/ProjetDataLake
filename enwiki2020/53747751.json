    "text": "Sitona lineatus, commonly known as the pea leaf weevil is a species of weevil with a Palearctic distribution. It is a common pest of beans, peas, and other plants in the family Fabaceae. ==Description== Adult beetles of S. lineatus measure 3.4-5.3 mm in length. They are characterised by a series of coloured scales arranged in alternating lines (striae) on the elytra; it is from this characteristic where the species gets its name lineatus meaning 'lined' or 'striped'. The head and pronotum also have fine pointed setae amongst the scales. The antennae are clubbed, pointed and preceded by 7 segments. The femora is dark, but tibiae and tarsi are red. ==Behaviour and ecology== Adults may be abundant on peas, clovers, and other legumes in the spring and autumn. Adults hibernate over winter, emerging in the spring to breed and eat the leaf margins of host plants leaving them with notched edges. Larvae feed in root nodules of host plants. ==References== Category:Entiminae Category:Agricultural pest insects Category:Beetles described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
