The USA next faced undefeated Russia, and fell behind by twelve points at halftime, but came back and won the game 79\u201368. The USA fell behind in their next game against undefeated China, but rallied and went on to win 89\u201378. The USA then beat Brazil to advance to the semi-final, where they faced Lithuania.

Walker was the leading scorer and rebounder for the USA team with 15.4 points and 8.6 rebounds per game. ==Head coaching record== Drake was awarded a forfeit victory over Valparaiso during the 1995\u201396 season due to Valparaiso's use of an ineligible player. Drake originally lost that game 79\u201380. Drake recognizes that game as a victory, but the NCAA does not, thus the NCAA statistics database includes a record of 15\u20134 for that year. ==References== Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:American women's basketball coaches Category:Basketball coaches from Iowa Category:Basketball players from Iowa Category:Drake Bulldogs women's basketball coaches Category:Iowa Hawkeyes women's basketball coaches Category:Northern Iowa Panthers women's basketball players Category:People from Marion, Iowa Category:Linn-Mar High School alumni ",
