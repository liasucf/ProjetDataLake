In conjunction with the release, she had contributed the theme song to the Japanese romantic movie \"Koisuru Vampire\" titled \"Colony\". The song was included as a B-side to the said single. In September 2015, Mito released her second single, \"8-bit Boy\", which was used as the main theme to the Japanese premiere of the American movie Pixels. Its B-side track, \"Watashi wo Fes ni Tsuretette\", was released as a separate digital single and has received a music video. On April 6, 2016, Mito's third single, \"I'll do my best\", was released.
