She designed numerous notable buildings throughout the country and was the recipient of several national prizes for her work. ==Early life== Anna Tigranovna Ter-Avetikian was born on 23 October 1908 in Yerevan, which at the time was in the Erivan Governorate of the Russian Empire. At the time that Armenia was annexed to Russia from the Ottoman Empire, her ancestors were granted a noble title from Nicholas I of Russia for providing assistance and medical supplies to General Ivan Paskevich's troops. She came from a family of architects and city developers who were noted for creating such works as the first drinking water system of Yerevan, the first hospital of the city, as well as other landmarks. Her father, Tigran Ter-Avetikian and his brother, Yervand, created the Philharmonic Hall of Yerevan, the City Council building on Shahumyan Square, and other noted works. After completing her high school studies, in 1924, Ter-Avetikian enrolled in the Technical School of Yerevan State University (YSU) to study architecture. In 1926, simultaneously with her studies, she started working for and Alexander Tamanian, noted architects who designed the master plan of the city of Yerevan and many of its buildings. Her schedule at this time was to go to school in the mornings, in the afternoon work in Buniatian's workshop, and then work with Tamanian in the evenings. Ter-Avetikian graduated in 1930 and shortly thereafter, married fellow architect, , who had attended YSU and was also employed with Buniatian and Tamanian. ==Career== Ponchikanots building at the corner of Mashtots Avenue and Koryun Street Together with her husband, Ter-Avetikian designed the fire and police stations in Yerevan and the \"Sasuntsi Tavit\" cinema, though the cinema was later destroyed.
