    "text": "Kathryn Wylde is an American not-for-profit executive. She is currently President and CEO (a position she has held since 2001) of the Partnership for New York City, a not for profit that works with the City's business leaders, government, labor, and the civic sector to make a better New York. The group focuses on the economy, education, and infrastructure. == Biography == Prior to becoming the leader of the Partnership, Wylde was the founding CEO of both the Partnership's housing and investment fund affiliates. She serves on a number of boards and advisory groups, such as the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the Fund for Public Schools, the Manhattan Institute, Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, and the Governor's NYC Regional Economic Development Council. Wylde has also served as director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In 2018, City and State magazine considered her to be the third most important person in New York City and State, after Michael Bloomberg and Stephen M. Ross. Crains New York Business listed her among the 50 most powerful women in New York City in 2017. Her Sunday routine was profiled in 2011 by The New York Times. == Views == According to The New York Times Wylde was among a number of prominent New Yorkers (and one of the primary movers) authoring a follow-up letter to Amazon, asking it to reconsider its decision to not build Amazon HQ2 in New York City. Her group also paid for a follow-up ad in the Times. She felt that the handling of the Amazon HQ2 situation had tarnished NYC's reputation as a place to do business. In reference to New York City's proposed \u2018Pied-\u00e0-Terre\u2019 Tax on Multimillion- Dollar Second Homes, Wylde has indicated that she does not think the proposed tax will be well received by the business community, suggesting that such a tax \u2014 combined with the recent tax code change that capped the amount of local income taxes that can be deducted on federal income taxes \u2014 might push the wealthy to reconsider living in NYC. In response to Mayor Bill de Blasio announcement of a new paid vacation day requirement, Wylde commented: \u201cThe New York business community got no heads-up on this \u2018national first\u2019 announcement, so apparently we are not the audience being addressed, although local entrepreneurs will certainly be the victims\u201d ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
