It is the 82nd largest island on earth. About 65% of the island is covered with glaciers. ==Geography== Komsomolets Island is separated from October Revolution Island in the south by the Red Army Strait and from Pioneer Island in the southwest by the Yuny Strait. The northernmost point of the island is the Arctic Cape, the launching point for many Arctic expeditions. Practically the whole of the central and southern part of the island is covered by the massive Academy of Sciences Glacier, between Krenkel Bay in the east and Zhuravlev Bay in the west. The northern part is largely unglaciated. The area of this island has been estimated at 9,006 km\u00b2. It rises to a height of 780 m. Komsomolets Island is home to the largest ice cap in Russia, the Academy of Sciences Ice Cap. ==Geology== The soil of the island is mostly composed of loose loam and sands, a tundra desert scattered with mosses and lichens.https://web.archive.org/web/20101223015139/http://www.oceandots.com/arctic/severnaya- zemlya Russian Arctic - Severnaya Zemlya ==History== The island was discovered by Boris Vilkitsky in 1913, but its insularity wasn't proven until 1931, when Georgy Ushakov and Nikolay Urvantsev charted the archipelago during their 1930\u201332 expedition. They also named it. In keeping with their scheme of naming the islands after events and movements of the Russian Revolution, this island was named in honour of the members of the Komsomol, the \"Communist Union of Youth.\" ==Photo gallery== File:Krenkel-Bucht 1 2014-08-31.jpg|Krenkel Bay, northeastern coast of Komsomolets Island (80\u00b040\u2019N, 97\u00b030\u2018O) File:Krenkel-Bucht 2 2014-08-31.jpg|Krenkel Bay File:Polarstation Izluchina 2014-08-31.jpg|Abandoned Russian polar station Izluchina (Northeast coast of Komsomolets Island; 81\u00b0N, 96\u00b033\u2019E).
