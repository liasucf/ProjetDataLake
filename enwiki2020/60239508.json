    "text": "Andrew K\u0151szegi (; died May/December 1324) was a Hungarian lord in the early 14th century, who was a member of the powerful K\u0151szegi family. His failed rebellion against Charles I of Hungary in 1317 contributed to the gradual collapse of the family's rule in Transdanubia. ==Family== Andrew originated from the Transdanubian branch of the powerful and wealthy K\u0151szegi family.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus H\u00e9der 4. K\u0151szegi [and Rohonci] branch) He was born around 1295, not long before the death of his father Gregory, who was killed by a lightning strike in 1297. Andrew was still referred to as \"iuvenis\" (\"young\") in spring 1315, who had just reached adulthood. Andrew had an elder brother Nicholas III, both of them were grandsons and heirs of the influential lord Ivan K\u0151szegi, who had established a province in Western Transdanubia independently of the royal power in the previous decades. Nicholas inherited Ivan's power and landholdings in 1308. Andrew was first mentioned by contemporary records in January 1312, when Nicholas confirmed his previously concluded alliance with the House of Habsburg in F\u00fcrstenfeld (), beyond his own person, on behalf of his brother Andrew, his uncle Bishop Nicholas of Gy\u0151r and the sons of the late Henry, John and Peter the \"Duke\". ==Rebellions against Charles== Nicholas died in early 1314. He was succeeded by Andrew, who clearly stated in one of his charters that he inherited the province from his grandfather then brother \"by law\". Accordingly, Andrew became hereditary isp\u00e1n of Vas, Sopron, Zala \u2013 and possibly Moson and Gy\u0151r \u2013 counties until his death. He owned various castles in the region, for instance K\u0151szeg, \u00d3v\u00e1r, Borosty\u00e1nk\u0151 (today Bernstein, Austria), S\u00e1rv\u00e1r, T\u00e1tika and Kabold (today Kobersdorf, Austria), in addition to the Pannonhalma Archabbey. Initially, Andrew remained neutral during the unification war of King Charles I of Hungary against the oligarchs, continuing his brother's policy, who abandoned their grandfather's aggressive anti-royal behavior. According to his own document, Andrew intended to visit the royal court in the summer of 1314, but there is no record about the event. S\u00e1rv\u00e1r Castle was the permanent residence of Andrew K\u0151szegi until his death However, soon, Andrew returned to the late Ivan's harsh expansionist policy and plundered his neighbors' landholdings, in order to integrate the some remaining independent lords to his Western Transdanubian province. For instance, his familiaris Solomon the Red destroyed the castle of Resznek, owned by Herbord Reszneki. Andrew seized Szentgy\u00f6rgy (also called B\u00e9kav\u00e1r, lit. \"Frog's Castle\") from Joachim P\u00e9c around the same time. He even extended his influence over some portions of Veszpr\u00e9m County by early 1315. For instance, he arbitrarily occupied the fort of Ugod from the Cs\u00e1ks. When Charles I launched a royal campaign against John and Peter, the late Henry's sons, who governed their province in Southern Transdanubia, Andrew sent his auxiliary troops in order to provide assistance to his second uncles. Charles waged war with the southern K\u0151szegi dominion again in the first half of 1316, which also affected heavily Andrew's territory. He was unable to help his relatives, because his several familiares pledged allegiance to the king and left his army in the same time, including Alexander K\u00f6cski and his kinship, the N\u00e1dasd clan. Andrew sent his soldier Solomon the Red with a marauding army to Gerse, where K\u00f6cski's brother-in-law Ladislaus N\u00e1dasd and his family were brutally massacred. In the same time, K\u00f6cski's lands and mills were also plundered and destroyed. K\u0151szeg Castle, owned by Andrew K\u0151szegi When Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin invaded the Syrmia, Charles I launched a counter-campaign across the river Sz\u00e1va and seized the fortress of Macs\u00f3 (present-day Ma\u010dva, Serbia) in the winter of 1317. Taking advantage of the king's absent, Andrew K\u0151szegi attacked the towns of Sopron and Gy\u0151r, which refused to acknowledge his supremacy, but the burghers successfully repelled the offense with the assistance of the troops of his former familiares, Paul and Lawrence Nagymartoni. Simultaneously Andrew unsuccessfully besieged L\u00e9ka and Rohonc (present-day Lockenhaus and Rechnitz in Austria, respectively), the castles of his royalist relative Nicholas II K\u0151szegi, who also participated in the Serbian campaign. Contemporary records and charters in the following period referred to Andrew's forces as \"Germans\", which implies that he hired number of mercenaries from Austria and Styria. In retaliation, Charles launched a punitive expedition against his territory in the summer of 1317, while Austrian duke Frederick the Fair also attacked from the borderlands. Andrew's dominion collapsed within months (the details of the clashes are unknown); he surrendered to Charles in the royal camp at Kom\u00e1rom in October 1317 (at that moment, the king besieged Matthew Cs\u00e1k's fortress). Charles' cease-fire conditions resulted the dissolution of the extended K\u0151szegi province in Western Transdanubia; the family was able to retain only Vas and Zala counties, its revenues were handed over to Nicholas II K\u0151szegi, while royal isp\u00e1ns were appointed to the other counties, where Andrew lost all of his castles (for instance, Pannonhalma, Kapuv\u00e1r and \u00d3v\u00e1r). In contrary to P\u00e1l Engel's conclusion, historian Gyula Krist\u00f3 considered that Andrew's unsuccessful attack against Sopron took place in the summer of 1317, and there were no subsequent clashes between the royal army and Andrew's troops. Krist\u00f3 argued there is no evidence that Andrew ever held the aforementioned isp\u00e1nates. In November 1317, King Frederick instructed Austrian noble and isp\u00e1n of Sopron County Rudolf von Pottendorf, to suspend attacks against Andrew's landholdings. After his failed insurrection in 1317, Andrew K\u0151szegi withdrew to the western border. For unknown reasons, he rebelled against Charles I again in the spring of 1319. Thereafter, Alexander K\u00f6cski and Nicholas Fels\u0151lendvai led a royal campaign against his remaining dominion. Fulfilling his vengeance, K\u00f6cski seized the K\u0151szegis' six fortresses within months; he overcame Andrew K\u0151szegi's army at Szalaf\u0151, also defeating the Austrian auxiliary troops, thereafter besieged and captured the forts of K\u0151szeg and Kapronca (present-day Koprivnica, Croatia). According to a royal charter, Nicholas Fels\u0151lendvai captured six Austrian robber barons, who served in Andrew's army. According to historian Ren\u00e1ta Skorka, these events also occurred during Andrew's rebellion in 1317. After that Andrew K\u0151szegi surrendered to the royal armies and never rebelled again. Charles I did not fully punish him for unknown reasons, for instance, he also returned the castle of K\u0151szeg to him. When the king crushed the power of Nicholas II K\u0151szegi in 1321, he appointed Andrew as the new isp\u00e1n of Vas County. He died in the second half of 1324. His castles and lands were inherited by his much younger uncle, John the \"Wolf\". == References == == Sources == * * * * * * |- |- |- |- |- |- |- Category:1290s births Category:1324 deaths Andrew Category:13th-century Hungarian people Category:14th-century Hungarian people ",
