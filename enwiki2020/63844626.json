    "text": "Thomas Jackson (1783\u20131873), was an English Wesleyan minister and writer, former chair of divinity of the Richmond Theological College and president of the Methodist Conference. == Biography == Thomas Jackson, the second son of Thomas and Mary Jackson, was born at Sancton, a small village in the East Riding of Yorkshire, on 12 December 1783. His father was an agricultural labourer. Three of the sons, Robert, Samuel, and Thomas, became ministers in the Wesleyan Methodist Church. Thomas was mainly self-taught, leaving school at the age of twelve to work on a farm. Three years later he was apprenticed to a carpenter at Shipton, a neighbouring village. At every available moment he read and studied, and in July 1801 joined the Methodist society and threw his energies into biblical study and religious work. In September 1804 he was sent by the Wesleyan conference as an itinerant preacher into the Spilsby circuit. For twenty years he laboured in the Wesleyan Methodist Church in the same capacity, occupying some of the most important circuits, such as Preston and Wakefield, Manchester, Lincoln, Leeds, and London. His position and influence grew rapidly. From 1824 to 1842 he was editor of the Wesleyan Methodist magazines, and, despite his lack of a liberal education in youth, he performed his duties with marked success. The conference elected him in 1842 to the chair of divinity in the Theological College at Richmond, Surrey, where he remained until 1861. In 1838 Jackson was chosen as president of the Wesleyan Methodist Conference. A hundred years had just passed since the formation of the first Methodist Society by the Wesley brothers, and Jackson prepared a centenary volume describing the origin and growth of methodism, and the benefits springing from it (1839). In the centenary celebrations he played a leading part, and preached before the conference in Brunswick Chapel, Liverpool, the official sermon, which occupied nearly three hours in delivery. The sermon was published, and had a very large circulation. Jackson was re- elected president in 1849, when the Methodist community was agitated by the so-called reform movement and the expulsion of James Everett, Samuel Dunn, and Griffiths. Jackson throughout the crisis showed great tact and dignity. He retired from Richmond College and from full work as a Wesleyan minister in 1861. At the same time his private library was bought by James Heald for 1,000\u00a3 and given to Richmond College. After leaving Richmond he resided with his daughter, Mrs. Marzials, first in Bloomsbury, and afterwards in Shepherd's Bush, where he died on 10 March 1873. In 1809 Jackson married Ann, daughter of Thomas Hollinshead of Horncastle. She died on 24 September 1854, aged 69. His son was the Rev. Thomas Jackson, M.A.. Samuel Jackson (1785\u20131861), Thomas Jackson's younger brother, was president of the Methodist Conference at Liverpool in 1847, and died at Newcastle_upon_Tyne during the session of the conference there in August 1861. Jackson's style as a preacher was simple and lucid. As a theologian he belonged to the school of John Wesley and Fletcher of Madeley. == Works == Besides occasional sermons and pamphlets he wrote: # \u2018Life of John Goodwin, A.M., comprising an Account of his Opinions and Writings,\u2019 8vo, London, 1822; new edition, 8vo, 1872. # \u2018Memoirs of the Life and Writings of the Rev.
