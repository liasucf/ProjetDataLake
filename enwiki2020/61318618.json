    "text": "Mtori is a popular Tanzanian stew made of bananas and meat, but it contain other ingredients (e.g. potatoes, milk or cream). The soup originated in the Kilimanjaro area of Tanzania, specifically the Moshi-Arusha region. Plantains/green bananas are often eaten in this region as the main source of starch. It has since spread to other areas throughout Tanzania. A special stick is traditionally used to mash the bananas. Mtori is often eaten by Maasai women during a three-month period postpartum confinement for nutrition. During this postpartum period, women are given mainly soft foods (laini) to eat like mtori. Because it is a thick stew, it can be served as a main course. It can be eaten during breakfast, lunch, or dinner. ==See also== * List of African dishes ==References== Category:African cuisine ",
