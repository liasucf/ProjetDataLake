This controversial \"bathroom bill\" legislation restricted transgender individuals from using gender- segregated public facilities, other than those identified for use by their biological sex as defined on their birth certificates. The bill, signed into law by Republican Governor Pat McCrory, also invalidated a local nondiscrimination law passed by the Charlotte City Council and prohibited any local government in North Carolina from enacting new protections for gay, lesbian, or transgender individuals. Bishop used his sponsorship of HB2 in fundraising emails, stating that he stood up to the \"radical transgender agenda.\" Bishop's role in promoting HB2 raised the profile of the freshman state senator.
