Had\u017ei-Vasiljevi\u0107 was born in Vranje, at the time part of the Sanjak of Ni\u0161 of the Ottoman Empire until it was captured by the Serbian Army in 1878. His father was Had\u017ei Vasilije of the Poga\u010darevi\u0107 family, and his mother Katerina was the daughter of the churchwarden (ikonom) of Kumanovo, Dimitrije Mladenovi\u0107 (1794\u20131880). The Poga\u010darevi\u0107 family (also known as Poga\u010darci) hailed from Rakovac, having settled in Vranje at the end of the 18th century. He finished primary school in Vranje, gymnasium in Vranje and Ni\u0161, and the Great School in Belgrade at the History and Philology faculties. He received his Philosophy doctorate at the University of Vienna in 1898. As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs he served from 1898 to 1904 in Bitola, Skopje and Belgrade. After he left the civil service in 1904, he was the secretary of the Society of Saint Sava until 1940. Throughout his life he worked for the national enlightenment of Serbs in the Ottoman Empire. He participated in the Balkan Wars and the First World War. He retreated with the Second Morava Division through Albania, which he described.
