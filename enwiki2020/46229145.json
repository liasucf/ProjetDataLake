Most of the Egyptians hold up posters that say words such as \"vote\", \"get out there\", and \"your voice counts\". The video was filmed in eight Egyptian provinces by eight different cameras and was put together in less than a day. The creator of the song planned on singing it himself but found out that Hussain Al Jasmi was coming to Egypt, and offered to sing the song himself to show his love for Egypt. In July 2013, the Egyptian presidency was vacated following removal from office of the president Mohamed Morsi after protests, after only a single year in power. Despite claims from the ousted Muslim Brotherhood indicating that Egyptians did not participate in large numbers in the elections of 2014, independent reports indicate that 47.14% of eligible voters participated in the ballot; this is comparable to the 49.62% who turned out in the 2012 election that elevated Mohammed Morsi to power. ==Video== On May 16, a 3-minute video was published, showing the diversity of the people across Egypt as they dance and hold cards with different Arabic words on them to encourage people to vote. A caption in the video says \"Dedicated to all EGYPTIANS\" in English. The video itself is sung by an Emirati singer, popular in the Middle East, named Hussain Al Jasmi; when asked why he sang the song, he replied that he wanted to show his great love for the Egyptian People. ==Popularity== The video as of 7 February 2019, has received more than 350 million views and has garnered international parodies, mixes, and imitations. The video gained popularity in the Arab world with copies being made about Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine, respectively. There are many videos worldwide from people who dance to the song and post their videos. The video received more than 5 million views on the day of its release, and was ranked among the top 100 songs internationally. In a televised speech, Ayman, the writer of the song, said that the song took him one day to write and that it took only 48 hours to put together all the pieces and produce the whole video. The video was funded by CBC, a Middle Eastern channel with the rights to the song. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Egyptian songs Category:2014 YouTube videos Category:2014 songs ",
