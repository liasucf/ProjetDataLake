    "text": "Vehicle registration plates of Vietnam generally take the form DDL-DDDDD for vehicles. Standard license plates have black characters on white background. Front plates measure 47 \u00d7 11 cm, rear ones are 27 \u00d7 20. The current scheme for civilian vehicles omits the letters I, J, O, Q and W, with the letter R reserved for trailers, and includes the Vietnamese \u0110. Vietnamese plate example (1975\u20131995) ==History== ===French protectorate=== In French Indochina, license plates were white-on-black on XXX1111 type, XXX is location code. 1111 can be anything (serial numbers). ===1978\u20131984=== Vietnamese plates in 1978\u20131984 were white-on-black and similar to previous one, but had 4 digits then 3 letters. 3 letters are city name, but based on Vietnamese language. ===1984\u20132003=== From 1984 to 2003 (current version) is black-on-white, then later green-on-white, with city name. Plates were A 1111 format, then 1A 1111 format, then AA 1111 format, then was going to switch to AAA 111 format, but the plan was cancelled. The leading two symbols are two digits, representing the province/municipality. The exact date of format changing is unknown. In 2012 a blue strip with a \"VN\" will be added on the left-hand side of the plates, as required by the new ASEAN licensing agreement. The leading two numerals refer to the various provinces and major municipalities of Vietnam, unless they are letters (AA, AB, AC, and so on) which signify that the car belongs to the Ministry of Defence - in which case the plate will be red. Some plates also carry a red two-letter code following the provincial numerals, with \"NG\" (for ngo\u1ea1i giao) used for a diplomatic or NGO plate and \"LD\" for a vehicle belonging to a company which is 100% foreign-owned. If a colored letter (A, B, or C) follows the province code, the vehicle belongs to the local government). ==== Colors ==== Vietnamese plate for Central Government's * President's cars, Central Government's cars - White on blue * Private vehicles - Black on white * Commercial vehicle, construction vehicles - Black on yellowhttps://tuoitre.vn/1-6-trieu-xe-kinh-doanh-van-tai-phai-doi-sang-bien- so-mau-vang-20200708073940211.htm * Military's cars - White on red * Diplomat's cars - Black on white with red NG code * Foreigner-owned cars - Black on white with black NN code == Formats == === Regular plates === Vietnamese private vehicle plate.
