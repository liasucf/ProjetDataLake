The headquarters of the district is Erode. It is divided into two revenue divisions, Erode and Gobichettipalayam, and is further subdivided into 10 taluks.

It covers an area of , and as of 2011, had a population of 2,251,744 . ==History== The region belonging to present-day Erode District was ruled successively by several South Indian dynasties, including the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas. During the first millennium, it was under the rule of the Chera Dynasty and various other rulers. Between the 10th to 12th centuries, the region was part of the larger Chola Empire. The region became part of Vijayanagara empire in the 14th century, then under the Nayaks of Madurai until the 17th century. Under the Madurai Nayaks, the Polygar system of administration was established. The Polygar system continued after the region became part of the Kingdom of Mysore in the mid-17th century. The Polygar chieftain Dheeran Chinnamalai, a governor of the region, played a major role in the early struggle for Indian Independence in the late 18th-century Polygar Wars against the British East India Company. After the Polygar and Mysore Wars in the late 18th century, the area came under the control of the British until the achievement of Indian independence in 1947. It was a part of the erstwhile Coimbatore district until its split in 1979. ==Demographics== According to the 2011 census, Erode District had a population of 2,251,744 with a sex-ratio of 993 females for every 1,000 males, above the national average of 929.

To the east, across the Kaveri River, lies Salem and Namakkal districts. To the southeast lies Karur district. Tirupur District lies immediately to the south. Coimbatore and Nilgiris districts lie to the west. Erode District is landlocked, and is situated at between latitude 10 36\" and 11 58\" north and between longitude 76 49\" and 77 58\" east. The district forms the meeting point of the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats mountain ranges, separated by the Bhavani River. The district comprises a long undulating plain, sloping gently towards the Kaveri River in the south-east. The three major tributaries of the Kaveri, the Bhavani, Noyyal and Amaravati, run across the long stretch of mountains in the north. In combination with these rivers, numerous canals, the Bhavanisagar Dam and the Kodiveri Dam provide irrigation and drainage for Erode. Bhavanisagar Dam across Bhavani River Kaveri River at Erode === Bhavani River === The Bhavani River rises in the Western Ghats of the Silent Valley National Park in the Palakkad District of Kerala. It is joined by the Siruvani River, a perennial stream of Coimbatore District, and is joined by the Kundha River before entering Erode District in Sathyamangalam. The Bhavani is perennial river, mostly fed by the southwest monsoon but also supplemented by the northeast monsoon. It runs for over one hundred miles through Erode District, crossing Bhavani and Gobichettipalayam taluks. Near Gobichettipalayam lies the Kodiveri Dam, a mini-dam constructed for agricultural purposes. The river eventually feeds the Bhavanisagar reservoir, and then takes an easterly course after crossing Sathyamangalam taluk. Along with another tributary, the Amutha Nathi River, the Bhavani River ultimately joins the Kaveri River in Bhavani, Tamil Nadu. A confluence of three rivers, such as this one, is known as a Triveni Sangam in Hindu belief. The place where the Bhavani River joins with the Kaveri River is famous for the Sri Sangameshwara Temple of Lord Shiva, where, in accordance to Hindu customs, people perform the last rites for deceased friends and family. === Kaveri River === The Kaveri River rises in the Western Ghats of Kodagu (Coorg) District in Karnataka, and is joined by many small tributaries. It runs eastward through Karnataka, and is joined by its main tributary, the Kabini River, before taking a sharp southbound turn at Hogenakkal Falls. From here, it runs towards the southeast, forming the boundary between Bhavani taluk of Erode District and Tiruchengode taluk of the neighbouring Namakkal District. The Bhavani River joins the Kaveri River at the town of Bhavani. ==Climate== Western Ghats as seen from Gobichettipalayam Unlike nearby Coimbatore District, Erode District's climate is characterized by dry weather throughout the year, except during the monsoons, when it receives high rainfall. The cool, moist wind that passes through the Palghat Gap in the Western Ghats has a moderating effect on the climate of neighbouring Coimbatore district, but the air loses its coolness and becomes dry by the time it reaches Erode. Generally, the first two months of the year are pleasant, but in March the temperature begins to rise, which persists until the end of May, when the highest temperatures are normally recorded. The few rain showers during this period do not provide much relief from the heat. However, the temperature reverses its rising trend during the pre-monsoon period, between June and August. By September, the monsoon rains begin to fall. The northeast monsoon sets in vigorously during October\u2013November. By December, the rains end, returning the climate to its dry and cold state. ==Administration== Erode District Collector's Office For administrative purposes, Erode District is divided into ten taluks under two revenue divisions. * Erode division : Erode taluk, Kodumudi taluk, Modakurichi taluk, Perundurai taluk * Gobichettipalayam division : Anthiyur taluk, Bhavani taluk, Gobichettipalayam taluk, Sathyamangalam taluk, Nambiyur taluk, Thalavadi taluk Erode District consists of one municipal corporation and four other municipalities: * Erode Municipal Corporation * Gobichettipalayam Selection Grade Municipality * Sathyamangalam Grade-I municipality * Bhavani Grade-II municipality * Punjai Puliampatti Grade-II municipality ==Politics== Erode District is divided into 3 Parliamentary Constituencies of the Lok Sabha: Erode, Nilgiris and Tirupur.
