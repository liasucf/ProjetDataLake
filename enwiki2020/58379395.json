The team was founded as \u0218antierul Naval Olteni\u021ba in 1948 and played between 1965 and 1992 in the Liga II and Liga III. After 1992 the team had only sporadic appearances in the third league, before being declared bankrupt at the end of the 2004\u201305 season. For 7 years football has disappeared from the city, and the stadium has also become a ruin. In 2011 the renovations of the stadium started and after one year the club was re-founded, this time as CSM Olteni\u021ba. ==History== CSM Olteni\u021ba was founded in 1948 as \u0218antierul Naval Olteni\u021ba (also known as \u0218N Olteni\u021ba or SNO). The team was first promoted to the Divizia C at the end of the 1964\u201365 season. \u0218N Olteni\u021ba played at this level for five years before advancing to the Divizia B at the end of the 1969\u201370 season. The club was strongly supported by the Olteni\u021ba shipyard and they had good results and at the end of the 1971\u201372 season occupied the 3rd place (best ranking in its entire history). In the following seasons the club no longer succeeded in approaching this performance: 1972\u201373 \u2013 6th, 1973\u201374 \u2013 13th, 1974\u201375 \u2013 9th, 1975\u201376 \u2013 13th, then culminating with a 17th place and a relegation at the end of the 1976\u201377 season. After one season, the club from the left bank of the Arge\u0219 River promoted again, but it would only last a season before returning to the third league, where it would remain. In 1992 after the Romanian Revolution and fall of the communism in Romania, Olteni\u021ba shipyard, which was an institution of the state, has begun to face growing financial problems, which has also shifted to the football team. In 1992 Unirea Tricolor Bucure\u0219ti (not to be confused with the original club Unirea Tricolor Bucure\u0219ti, which was dissolved in 1958) was moved from Bucharest to Olteni\u021ba and merged with ISCIP Ulmeni and \u0218N Olteni\u021ba. The new entity was named Unirea Tricolor Olteni\u021ba, then Navol Unirea Olteni\u021ba. After two seasons, Unirea Tricolor and \u0218N Olteni\u021ba split up, Unirea Tricolor moved back to Bucharest and maintained the Divizia C place while \u0218N Olteni\u021ba was renamed as Navol Olteni\u021ba (the new name of the Olteni\u021ba shipyard) and enrolled in the Divizia D. Navol promoted after only one season and remained in the Divizia C until 1999, then promoting again only in 2004. As the shipyard's support had disappeared because of the serious problems it faced, Navol has withdrawn at the end of the season due to lack of funds, the shipyard was declared bankrupt a year later. After this followed the darkest period in the history of football from Olteni\u021ba, a period of seven years in which the club remained just a memory and the stadium has become a ruin. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\" align=\"right\" |- | style=\"background:#01a0e2;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #c91d27\" | Name | style=\"background:#01a0e2;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #c91d27\" | Period |- | \u0218antierul Naval Olteni\u021ba || 1948\u20131992 |- | Unirea Tricolor Olteni\u021ba || 1992\u20131993 |- | Navol Unirea Olteni\u021ba || 1993\u20131994 |- | Navol Olteni\u021ba || 1994\u20132005 |- | CSM Olteni\u021ba || 2012\u2013present |} In 2011 the stadium was renovated and in 2012 the football club was refounded as CSM Olteni\u021ba. The team returned to the Liga III at the end of the 2014\u201315 season after winning the Liga IV, C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i County group. ==Ground== CSM Olteni\u021ba plays its home matches on the 2,500-seat Stadionul Municipal from Olteni\u021ba. In the past the stadium could fit 10,000 people, but the capacity was reduced by the irreparable damage suffered during the period in which it was abandoned. In 2011 the stadium was revived, but the capacity was reduced at only 2,500 and from 2014 was also bought by Municipality of Olteni\u021ba from the company that took over the assets of the Olteni\u021ba shipyard after its bankruptcy. ==Honours== *Liga III **Winners (2): 1969\u201370, 1977\u201378 **Runners-up (1): 1982\u201383 *Liga IV \u2013 C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i County **Winners (4): 1964\u201365, 1995\u201396, 2000\u201301, 2014\u201315 === Other performances === *Appearances in Liga II: 8 *Best finish in Liga II: 3rd place in the 1971\u201372 ==Current squad== ==Club officials== ===Board of directors=== {| class=\"toccolours\" |- ! style=\"background:#01a0e2;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #c91d27\" |Role ! style=\"background:#01a0e2;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #c91d27\" |Name |- | Owner | Olteni\u021ba Municipality |- | President | Iulian Cudalbu |} ===Current technical staff=== {| class=\"toccolours\" |- ! style=\"background:#01a0e2;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #c91d27\" |Role ! style=\"background:#01a0e2;color:#FFFFFF;border:1px solid #c91d27\" |Name |- | Manager | R\u0103zvan Huzuneanu |} ==League history== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\" !
