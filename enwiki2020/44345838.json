The memorial was unveiled on 26 March 1921. The township of Forest Hill developed during the 1890s, following the repurchase by the Queensland Government of from the Rosewood station. Although the Ipswich to Toowoomba railway had been surveyed between Laidley and Gatton in 1865, it was not until that a siding was established in the Forest Hill area. Originally known as Boyd's siding, it was shifted to the site of the present Forest Hill railway station . As the surrounding country was progressively opened and settled by farmers, Forest Hill became a busy transport centre for agricultural produce, often requiring special trains to be run from Forest Hill. The masons for the monument were PJ Lowther and Sons of Brisbane, who were also responsible for memorials in Brisbane (the pedestal for the South African memorial), Blackbutt, Murgon, Goodna, Mount Perry and Tiaro. It is possible that the monument was actually carved by Charles Lowther, sculptor son of this Brisbane masonry family, and an ex-serviceman who fought with the Australian Light Horse in the First World War. The monument cost , and was unveiled by five mothers of fallen soldiers. A plate with the names of World War II servicemen was added at a later stage. == Description == Forest Hill War Memorial The Forest Hill War Memorial is located in a small park at the end of Victoria Street, completing a vista down the town's main street.
