Their only serious rivals were the K\u0119sgailos, and from the end of the 15th century the fast rising in power and influence Radvila family clan. It appears from the Latin original spelling of their name Gastoldus which is a variation of castaldius that they had been close to the Grand Dukes and that their function was to oversee ducal demesne. Most power family gained during the reign of Casimir Jagiellon. The castaldius of Vytautas, Andrius Go\u0161tautas might have been a voivode of Vilnius and Kreva, and father of Jonas, appears to have been the precursor of the family growth. The majority of the family's possessions (lands) were in the western part of the Duchy and eastern ethnic Lithuania. After the death of the last scion of the family, Stanislovas Go\u0161tautas, the Polish King and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund II Augustus inherited his possessions as a matter of right, per Grand Duchy of Lithuania law. ==Name== The Go\u0161tautai family name may be found in numerous renderings: Gasztold, Gaszto\u0142d, Gaszto\u0142t, Gashtold, Gastoldus, Gastold, Gasto\u0142d, Gosztold, Gosztowd, Gosztowt, Gosztowtt, Gochtovtt, Gasztowt, Gaszdtowt, Gasztowtt, Gasthawdus, Gostautas and Go\u0161tautas; these are all different renderings of the same distorted pagan given name of Go\u0161tautai's ancestor, mentioned in written sources as Johann Gastawd.Regesten und Texte zur Geschichte Preu\u00dfens und des Deutschen Ordens Upon the baptism he retained his pagan Lithuanian name (which may be reconstructed as *G\u0101sta\u016dtas) and passed it on to his descendants; that was a common practice of the rising Lithuanian nobility subsequent to the Christianization of Lithuania. Hence at first such names were used much like patronymics rather than surnames in a modern sense.

In Lithuanian the name of the clan is rendered Go\u0161tautai or Gostautai (singular, Go\u0161tautas or Gostautas); in Polish language the forms Gastold or Gaszto\u0142d are used. Contemporary written sources use different forms of the name; latest English sources use both forms, Polish Gasztold and Lithuanian Gostautas.Lithuania Ascending\u2013 A Pagan Empire Within East-central Europe, 1295-1345 S.
