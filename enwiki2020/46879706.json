    "text": "This is a list of former high school athletic conferences in the Central Region of Ohio, as designated by the OHSAA. If a conference had members that span multiple regions, the conference is placed in the article of the region most of its former members hail from. Because the names of localities and their corresponding high schools do not always match and because there is often a possibility of ambiguity with respect to either the name of a locality or the name of a high school, the following table gives both in every case, with the locality name first, in plain type, and the high school name second in boldface type. The school's team nickname is given last. ==Buckeye Athletic Conference== * Bexley Lions (1991-2003, to Mid-State) * Sunbury Big Walnut Golden Eagles (1991\u201397, to Ohio Capital) * Grandview Heights Bobcats (1991-2003, to Mid-State) * Plain City Jonathan Alder Pioneers (1991-2003, to Mid-Ohio in 2013) * Johnstown-Monroe Johnnies (1991\u201394, to Mid-Buckeye) * Hebron Lakewood Lancers (1991-2003, to Mid-State) * Newark Licking Valley Panthers (1991-2003, to Mid-State) * London Red Raiders (1991-2003, to South Central Ohio) * London Madison-Plains Golden Eagles (1991\u201393, 1997-2003, to South Central Ohio) * Lewis Center Olentangy Braves (1991\u201397, to Ohio Capital) * Utica Redskins (1991\u201399, to Mid-Buckeye) * West Jefferson Roughriders (1991-2003 to Mid-State in 2006) * Washington Court House Washington Blue Lions (1993-2003, to South Central Ohio) * Greenfield McClain Tigers (1999-2001, to Southern Buckeye) * Gahanna Columbus Academy Vikings (2001\u201303, to Mid-State) * Milford Center Fairbanks Panthers (2001\u201303, to Northwest Central) * Washington Court House Miami Trace Panthers (2001\u201303, to South Central Ohio) * Whitehall-Yearling Rams (2001\u201303, to Mid-State) {| class=\"wikitable\" |+align=bottom style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- style=\"background:#ccf;\" ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Buckeye Athletic Conference Divisions (1991-94, unless noted) |- ! ! |- | Bexley (1991-93) | Bexley (1993-94) |- | Big Walnut | Grandview Heights |- | Johnstown-Monroe (1993-94) | Johnstown-Monroe (1991-93) |- | Lakewood | Jonathan Alder |- | Licking Valley | London |- | Olentangy | Madison Plains (1991-93) |- | Utica | West Jefferson |- | | Washington (1993-94) |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+align=bottom style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- style=\"background:#ccf;\" ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Buckeye Athletic Conference Divisions (1994-2003, unless noted) |- ! ! |- | Bexley | Columbus Academy (2001-03) |- | Big Walnut (1994-97) | Fairbanks (2001-03) |- | Lakewood | Grandview Heights |- | Licking Valley (1997-2003) | Jonathan Alder |- | London | Licking Valley (1994-97) |- | Miami Trace (2001-03) | Madison Plains (1997-2003) |- | McClain (1999-2001) | Utica (1994-97) |- | Olentagy (1994-97) | Washington (1997-2003) |- | Utica (1997-99) | West Jefferson |- | Washington (1994-97) | |- | Whitehall-Yearling (2001-03) | |} ==Buckeye Central Conference== * Findlay Trojans (1987\u20131995, to Great Lakes League) * Fremont Ross Little Giants (1987\u20131991, to Great Lakes League) * Lancaster Golden Gales (1987\u20131995, to Ohio Capital Conference 1997) * Newark Wildcats (1987\u20131995, to Ohio Capital Conference) * Zanesville Blue Devils (1987\u20131995, to Ohio Valley Athletic Conference) The league was created after the Buckeye Conference folded. The league was an unideal resort for member schools that had to bear extensive travel. Fremont Ross was able to gain membership in the now-defunct Great Lakes League in 1991, leaving the four schools to struggle on. Findlay eventually gained membership in the GLL as Zanesville left for the closer OVAC confederation, effectively ending competition. Lancaster and Newark would end up going from leagues struggling to retain members to joining the Ohio Capital Conference, which is the largest proper conference in the state. ==Central Buckeye League== There were two versions of the CBL. The first ran from 1929 to 1966. The second version ran from 1976 to 1991, where after joining with schools from the Licking County League, it was rebranded as the Buckeye Athletic Conference (BAC).

The league was one that was directly hindered by the creation of the Ohio Capital Conference, as two of its five remaining members left for the league in 1968, and the other schools left to fill in spots in other conferences. * Bexley Lions (1922-29, to Central Buckeye League, 1966\u201368, to Mid-8 League) * Gahanna Columbus Academy Vikings (1922-49, to Mid-State, 1957-66, to Mid-Buckeye) * Canal Winchester Indians (1922-57, to Mid-State League, 1964\u201366, to Mid-State League) * Dublin Shamrocks (1922-68, to Metropolitan League) * Columbus Franklin Heights Falcons (1922-58, to South Central Ohio League) * Grandview Heights Bobcats (1922-29, to Central Buckeye League, 1966\u201368, to Mid-8 League) * Grove City Greyhounds (1922-50, to Mid-6 League) * Groveport-Madison Cruisers (1922-58, to Mid-8 League) * Columbus Hamilton Township Rangers (1922-64, to South Suburban League) * Hilliards Wildcats (1922-50, to Mid-6 League) * Gahanna Lincoln Golden Lions (1922-58, to Mid-8 League) * Columbus Mifflin Cowpunchers (1922-58, to Mid-8 League) * New Albany Eagles (1922-65, to Mid-Buckeye League) * Reynoldsburg Raiders (1922-66, to Metropolitan League) * Upper Arlington Golden Bears (1922-39, to Central Buckeye League, 1966\u201368, to Ohio Capital Conference) * Westerville Wildcats (1922-26, to Central Ohio League) * Whitehall-Yearling Rams (1922-58, to Central Buckeye League) * Worthington Cardinals (1922-39, to Central Buckeye League, 1945\u201350, to Mid-6 League, 1966-68, to Ohio Capital Conference) * West Jefferson Roughriders (1963\u201368, to Metropolitan League) ==Knox County League== * Amity Aces2 (192?-58, consolidated into Mount Vernon) * Bladensburg Blades3 (192?-61, to Knox-Morrow) * Centerburg Trojans (192?-48, to Mid- Buckeye League) * Danville1 Blue Devils (192?-55, to Mid-Buckeye League) * Fredericktown Freddies (192?-61, to Johnny Appleseed) * Gambier Pirates2 (192?-58, consolidated into Mount Vernon) * Howard Bulldogs3 (192?-61, to Knox-Morrow) # Concurrent with Mid-Buckeye League 1954-55. # Concurrent with Knox-Morrow League 1955-58. # Concurrent with Knox-Morrow League 1955-61. ==Knox-Morrow League== Formed in 1955, this league was formed by smaller schools in the two counties to solve scheduling issues with their dwindling county leagues (which all remained in).
