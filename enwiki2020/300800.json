    "text": "The Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley is a metropolitan borough of Merseyside, England. It comprises the towns and districts of Kirkby, Prescot, Huyton, Whiston, Halewood, Cronton and Stockbridge Village; Kirkby, Huyton, and Prescot being the major commercial centres. It takes its name from the village of Knowsley, though its headquarters are in Huyton. It forms part of the wider Liverpool City Region. The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of Huyton-with-Roby Urban District, Kirkby Urban District and Prescot Urban District, along with most of Whiston Rural District and a small part of West Lancashire Rural District, all from the administrative county of Lancashire. It is known for Knowsley Hall and Knowsley Safari Park. ==History== Knowsley was formerly a collection of villages, some dating back to 650 AD.Knowsley Council (2015). Knowsley Metropolitan Borough \u2013 An Introduction: History, Geography, Population and Economy. p. 2. The Earls of Derby have their ancestral home in the borough at Knowsley Hall, the surroundings of which today house the popular visitor attraction of Knowsley Safari Park. Knowsley experienced rapid population expansion in the 1950s and 1960s, resulting from the combination of industrialisation and migration, including a significant amount of overspill development from Liverpool. By 1971, some 194,600 lived within the area which would become Knowsley.Knowsley District, A Vision of Britain Through Time, 23 December 2016 However, over the next two decades general economic decline \u2013 particularly in manufacturing \u2013 contributed to a significant fall in population to around 154,600 by 1994. Subsequently, a population stabilisation strategy helped to stem this decline. The strategy was focused on house building and marketing the borough to secure inward investment.Knowsley Council (2015). Knowsley Metropolitan Borough \u2013 An Introduction: History, Geography, Population and Economy. p. 2. Record house building and strong growth in inward investment yielded the borough's first small rise in population in over 25 years in 1995. The population stabilised at over 154,000 for most of the rest of the 1990s.Knowsley District, A Vision of Britain Through Time, 23 December 2016 ==Geography== Knowsley Metropolitan Borough covers an area of 33.40 square miles (86.50 km\u00b2) and is the smallest metropolitan borough of Merseyside.
