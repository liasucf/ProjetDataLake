    "text": "The Australia-China Council (ACC) is a long-standing institution in the Australia-China bilateral relationship. ACC was established by the Australian Government in 1978 to promote mutual understanding and foster people-to-people relations between Australia and China. ACC combines the cross-sectoral bilateral expertise and advisory capacity of an independent Board appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs with the policy-making and management base in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. By the time of the ACC's fortieth anniversary in 2018, it had \"funded over 2,600 projects at a value of more than $23 million\". ==History== The concept of the Australia-China Council was borne out of discussions in 1975 between Australia's first ambassador to China, Dr Stephen Fitzgerald, and Jocelyn CheyAustralia--China Council Retrospective Author(s): Jocelyn Chey Source: The Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs, No. 7 (Jan., 1982), pp. 137-140 Published by: The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the College of Asia and the Pacific, The Australian National University Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2158827 Accessed: 02/10/2014 who was a counsellor at the Australian Embassy in Beijing and later became the first head of the council's secretariat. On 11 May 1976, Dr Stephen Fitzgerald wrote a letter to the then Foreign Affairs Minister, Andrew Peacock. He said: \"China is not a habit of mind for Australians. The spread of Chinese influence is a process we do not understand. There is, of course, intrinsic worth in the understanding of Chinese culture for its own value. But the purpose of this dispatch is to suggest that there is a very specific Australian interest in the promotion of what is broadly described in China as cultural exchange. Without this, our relations with China will never be more than superficial, and we will be damagingly ill-equipped to adjust to a China dominant in our region.\" This letter led to the establishment of the Australia-China Council in 1978 by the Orders-In-Council. When Stephen FitzGerald returned to Australia, he convened a working group which presented a report to Andrew Peacock recommending the establishment of an advisory body which would make recommendations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the ways to develop and strengthen relations with China and which, under ministerial supervision, administers funding to support programs which will advance the bilateral relationship. The council would have an independent board representing, on a rotating basis, all major sectors and stakeholder groups involved in Australia-China relations. The board would be supported by a small secretariat in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The model has proved to be highly successful and effective and was later replicated with other bilateral foundations, councils and institutes in DFAT. This structure has remained largely unchanged to this day. Initially, sixteen council members were appointed under the chairmanship of Professor Geoffrey Blainey, former chairman of the Australia Council. ==Board members== The Australia-China Council Chair's commitment, guidance and leadership has been invaluable in developing, furthering and maintaining the successful bilateral relationship that Australia and China hold today. ===Current board members=== * The Hon Warwick Smith AM, Chair - Chairman, Advisory Board Australian Capital Equity; Chairman, Senior Managing Director and Chairman for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (NSW & ACT) * Ms Anne-Marie Schwirtlich AM - Director General of the National Library of Australia * Ms Margaret Jack - President of the China Advisory Board of the Adecco Group * Ms Carolyn Kay - member of The Future Fund Board of Guardians, a non-executive director of Brambles, John Swire and Sons P/L and Scentre Group and an external Board Member of Allens Linklaters * Professor Michael Wesley - Dean College of Asia at the Australian National University and the Pacific * Mr Dan Ryan - a commercial and technology lawyer * Mr Harold Weldon - is a writer, publisher, filmmaker and China advisor * Ex-officio member - deputy secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade responsible for North Asia; represents the department on the ACC Board ===Former ACC chairs=== * Emeritus Professor Mark Wainwright AM FTSE: 2006\u20132011 * Dr John Yu AC: 2000\u20132006 * Mr Stuart Simson: 1997\u20132000 * Professor Stuart Harris AO: 1991\u20131996 * Hon.
