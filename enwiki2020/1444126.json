The list is organized by broad geographical sections within the city. While there is no official list of neighborhoods, districts, and places, this list was compiled from the sources listed in the References and External links sections, as well as from published information from secondary sources. Common usage for Philadelphia's neighborhood names does not respect \"official\" borders used by the city's police, planning commission or other entities. Therefore, some of the places listed here may overlap geographically, and residents do not always agree where one neighborhood ends and another begins. Philadelphia has 41 ZIP codes, which are often used for neighborhood analysis. Historically, many neighborhoods were defined by incorporated townships (Blockley, Roxborough), districts (Belmont, Kensington, Moyamensing, Richmond), or boroughs (Bridesburg, Frankford, Germantown, Manayunk) before being incorporated into the city with the Act of Consolidation of 1854.The Political and Community Service Boundaries of Philadelphia, Philadelphia City Planning Commission, June 2004. Adding further complication is the fact that in some parts of Philadelphia, especially the central areas of North, West, and South Philadelphia, residents have long been more likely to identify with the name of their section of the city than with any specific neighborhood name. Today, community development corporations, neighborhood watches, and other civic organizations are influential in shaping the use of neighborhood names and approximate boundaries. For planning purposes, the city is divided into 12 Planning Analysis Sections, which are Center City; South Philadelphia; Southwest Philadelphia; West Philadelphia; Lower North Philadelphia; Upper North Philadelphia; Bridesburg-Kensington-Port Richmond; Roxborough-Manayunk; Germantown-Chestnut Hill; Olney-Oak Lane; Near Northeast Philadelphia; and Far Northeast Philadelphia. ==Center City== The Philadelphia City Hall in Center City The Center City Planning Analysis Section extends from South Street on the south to Vine Street on the north, and from the Delaware River on the east to the Schuylkill River on the west. ==South Philadelphia== The South Philadelphia Planning Analysis Section is bounded by South Street on the north and the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers to their confluence. ==Southwest Philadelphia== Philadelphia International Airport is located in Southwest Philadelphia Southwest Philadelphia (formerly Kingsessing Township) is a section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that can be described as extending from the western side of the Schuylkill River to the city line, with the northern border defined by the Philadelphia City Planning Commission as east from the city line along Baltimore Avenue moving south along 51st Street to Springfield Ave. It follows the train tracks until 49th Street.

The area generally served as a gateway between Philadelphia and the nearby farmlands. During the American Revolutionary War era (late 18th century), the area was one of many summer vacation spots due to its higher elevation, 400\u2013500 feet (120 to 150 m) above sea level, and cooler temperatures than the historic Center City.
