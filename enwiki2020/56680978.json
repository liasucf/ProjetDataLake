On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an 80% approval rating, with an average rating of 6 out of 10 based on 10 reviews. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 64 out of 100 based on 6 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" In a positive review, Los Angeles Timess Robert Lloyd praised the series saying, \"The excellence of the acting and the admirable, one might almost say English naturalism of the production balance the sometimes improbable, even implausible action and the occasional sacrifice of sense to drama; it is true that in life, people do not act sensibly, but fictional characters should be held to a higher standard of consistency. Still, the writing gives the actors a lot to play with.\" In a more mixed critique, TV Guides Liam Mathews discussed the show's various sub- plots saying, \"They writers are much more interested in the vignettes that build out the town...These smaller side stories give the show an indie movie- like texture about people trying to make it in America. They're sort of like short films within the bigger show, and they contain much of the show's best writing and acting. They would be better if they didn't have the unnecessary dollar bill gimmick connecting them all, but it's not that distracting.\" In an outright negative assessment, The Hollywood Reporters Tim Goodman criticized the series saying, \"There's not enough good writing here, not enough motivation to follow characters that are either intentionally half-baked or are merely uninteresting. Characters have quirks, but the quirks prove there's not much else there. Smart people eventually do exceptionally dumb things.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010s American drama television series Category:2018 American television series debuts Category:2018 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:CBS All Access original programming Category:Television series by Anonymous Content Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios Category:Mystery drama web series Category:Thriller web series Category:Television shows filmed in Pennsylvania Category:Television shows filmed in Pittsburgh ",
