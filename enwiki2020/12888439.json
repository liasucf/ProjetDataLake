It was abandoned in the Middle Ages for the more secure site of the present Entrevaux. Only the chevet remains, which has been converted into a chapel. The cathedral is a national monument of France. Ancienne cath\u00e9drale de Gland\u00e8ves, Notre-Dame de la Sed, dite aussi chapelle de l'H\u00f4pital ==History== The chevet of the former cathedral, converted to a chapel The ancient town of Gland\u00e8ves occupied an exposed site that was frequently attacked and pillaged. In the 11th century the inhabitants moved to a more secure and defensible settlement at Entrevaux, although the Bishop of Gland\u00e8ves remained seated at the cathedral on the old site. Frontage of the converted chapel Between 1609 and 1624 a new cathedral (Entrevaux Cathedral, or the Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame- de-l'Assomption d'Entrevaux)the new cathedral was also known as Gland\u00e8ves Cathedral, from the name of the diocese. was built in Entrevaux, which became the seat of the diocese at its completion. The Diocese of Gland\u00e8ves ceased to exist in the Concordat of 1801 which reformed the ecclesiastical structure of France following the French Revolution, and its territory was divided between the Diocese of Digne and the Diocese of Nice. The old cathedral and the adjoining episcopal palace buildings were sold during the Revolution and subsequently used as a boarding house and a hospital, whence the alternative name for the present chapel as the Chapelle de l'H\u00f4pital. The remaining structure dates from the 12th century, with some work from the later 16th century. The conversion to the chapel is modern. ==Notes and references== ==External links== * Catholic Hierarchy: Diocese of Gland\u00e8ves Category:Former cathedrals in France Category:Churches in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence Category:Monuments historiques of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur ",
