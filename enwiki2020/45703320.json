    "text": "Eloquence is an album composed of songs played by jazz musicians Bill Evans and Eddie Gomez between the years of 1973 and 1975. It was released posthumously in 1982 on Fantasy Records.McDonohugh, Jack (9 October 1982). \"Fantasy mines a classic catalog\". Billboard, p. 36. ==Background and reception== The album consists of four duets with Eddie Gomez and four solo pieces. Four songs (\"Gone With The Wind\", \"Saudade Do Brasil\", \"All Of You\" and \"Since We Met\") and the medley (\"But Not For Me\" / \"Isn't It Romantic\" / \"The Opener\") were recorded while rehearsing in the Fantasy Records studio in Berkeley in 1974\u201375. The last piece is a brief medley of two Cy Coleman tunes: \"When In Rome\" and \"It Amazes Me\". They were recorded live in 1973 at one of Evans's favorite West Coast venues, Shelly's Manne-Hole jazz club in Hollywood. The remaining songs, \"In A Sentimental Mood\" and \"But Beautiful\" were recorded live at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1975. Scott Yanow wrote of the album: \"Being a musical perfectionist, it is a bit doubtful if he would have wanted this music to be released although longtime Bill Evans collectors will find the explorations to be intriguing\" According to the French jazz critic Alain Gerber, in \"Saudade Do Brasil\", Gomez used \"new technical advances in amplification to exploit the upper range and harmonics\" of the double bass.Quoted in Suddarth, Roscoe Seldon (2008).
