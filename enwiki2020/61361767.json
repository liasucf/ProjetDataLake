    "text": "Illustrated Police News, London, 21 February 1885 Dynamitard was a predominantly nineteenth century expression for a person who used explosives for violence against the State, and is a niche metaphor for a revolutionary in politics, culture or social affairs. ==Bombers== First appearing in English language newspapers in 1882, the word was understood to be a French expression applied to political terrorists in France. (\"Dynamitard\" is not a formal French word: French newspapers had coined it as a disdainful variant of dynamiteur.) It was soon applied to Burton and Cunningham, Irish-Americans who had planted explosives in London.. \"A term of opprobrium for some and endearment for others, the dynamitard was technically a political dynamiter, of the kind that bombed railway carriages and exploded devices in the House of Commons in the name of Irish freedom, chiefly in the early 1880s.\" ==Metaphorical sense== In nineteenth century politics the term came to be used, particularly by George Bernard Shaw, as metonymy for those who chose violent struggle \u2014 as opposed to gradual means \u2014 for achieving social revolution: a dynamitard was contrasted with a Fabian.. However, Shaw himself was described, metaphorically, as \"a dynamitard among music and drama critics\". ==In popular culture== Between 1889 and 1903 Stevenston Thistle, who played in the Ayrshire Football League and elsewhere, were known as The Dynamitards. They did not live up to their name, however, losing 7-2 to Clyde F.C. in the first round of the 1894\u201395 Scottish Cup. ==In high culture== Mocked as a neologism by Robert Louis and Fanny van de Grift Stevenson (\"Any writard who writes dynamitard shall find in me a never-resting fightard\"), its presence in dictionaries regretted by purists, there it has remained. ==References== ==Sources== ===Books, journals and theses=== * * * * * * * ===Newspaper reports and websites=== * * * * * * * * * * Category:Political terminology Category:Terrorism Category:Words coined in the 1880s Category:Football in Scotland ",
