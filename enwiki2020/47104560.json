    "text": "Reality is the 39th studio album by American musician James Brown. The album was released in 1974, by Polydor Records. ==Release== Reality was released in late 1974. It charted on the Billboard 200 for 10 weeks, peaking at number 56. ==Reception== In a contemporary review, the NME reviewed both Reality and Breakin' Bread, stating that the album were \"pretty much up to the standard of his last few [records].\" which he found was both positive and negative noting that there has been no major progression in his music since 1972. The review concluded that both albums were \"very well produced, exceedingly exciting and irresistible for dancing, but who needs James Brown & The J.B.'s when you can have The Fatback Band or B.T. Express?\" AllMusic gave the album a negative review, noting that Brown's \"insane schedule was catching up to him\" and that it found him \"at an artistic impasse.\" The reviewer noted that \"it was foolish to expect a \"fun\" album from Brown during this time. He seemed to view America as a doomed nation, and considered the gas shortage, Watergate, and unemployment lines as signs of the coming apocalypse. A hint of sadness and ennui cloaks over the album.\" The review critiqued \"The Twist\" as Brown hitting a writer's block and that the cover of \"Don't Fence Me In\" was another sign of his \"desperation\". The review noted that the album contained \"his worst ballads on record\". ==Track listing== Track listing adapted from vinyl of Reality. ==Credits== Credits adapted from back cover of Reality. *James Brown \u2013 producer, arrangements *Fred Wesley \u2013 arrangements, production supervisor *Dave Matthews \u2013 arrangements on \"The Twist\" *Bob Both \u2013 engineer, production supervisor *David Stone \u2013 assistant engineer *Major \u2013 assistant engineer *Don Brautigam \u2013 illustration ==References== Category:1974 albums Category:James Brown albums Category:Albums produced by James Brown Category:Polydor Records albums ",
