    "text": "In abstract algebra, a decomposition of a module is a way to write a module as a direct sum of modules. A type of a decomposition is often used to define or characterize modules: for example, a semisimple module is a module that has a decomposition into simple modules. Given a ring, the types of decomposition of modules over the ring can also be used to define or characterize the ring: a ring is semisimple if and only if every module over it is a semisimple module. An indecomposable module is a module that is not a direct sum of two nonzero submodules. Azumaya's theorem states that if a module has an decomposition into modules with local endomorphism rings, then all decompositions into indecomposable modules are equivalent to each other; a special case of this, especially in group theory, is known as the Krull\u2013Schmidt theorem. A special case of a decomposition of a module is a decomposition of a ring: for example, a ring is semisimple if and only if it is a direct sum (in fact a product) of matrix rings over division rings (this observation is known as the Artin\u2013Wedderburn theorem). == Idempotents and decompositions == To give a direct sum decomposition of a module into submodules is the same as to give orthogonal idempotents in the endomorphism ring of the module that sum up to the identity map. Indeed, if M = \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} M_i, then, for each i \\in I, the linear endomorphism e_i : M \\to M_i \\hookrightarrow M given by the natural projection followed by the natural inclusion is an idempotent. They are clearly orthogonal to each other (e_i e_j = 0 for i e j) and they sum up: :1_{\\operatorname{M}} = \\sum_{i \\in I} e_i as endomorphisms (here the summation is well-defined since it is a finite sum at each element of the module). Conversely, each set of orthogonal idempotents \\\\{ e_i \\\\}_{i \\in I} such that only finitely many e_i(x) are nonzero for each x \\in M and 1_R = \\sum_{a \\in A} e_a \\in \\bigoplus_{a \\in A} I_a, which is necessarily a finite sum; in particular, A must be a finite set. For example, take R = \\mathsf{M}_n(D), the ring of n-by-n matrices over a division ring D. Then {}_R R is the direct sum of n copies of D^n, the columns; each column is a simple left R-submodule or, in other words, a minimal left ideal. Let R be a ring. Suppose there is a (necessarily finite) decomposition of it as a left module over itself :{}_R R = R_1 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus R_n into two-sided ideals R_i of R. As above, R_i = R e_i for some orthogonal idempotents e_i such that 1 = \\sum_1^n e_i. Since R_i is an ideal, e_i R \\subset R_i and so e_i R e_j \\subset R_i \\cap R_j = 0 for i e j. Then, for each i, :e_i r = \\sum_j e_j r e_i = \\sum_j e_i r e_j = r e_i. That is, e_i are in the center; i.e., they are central idempotents. Clearly, the argument can be reversed and so there is a one-to-one correspondence between the direct sum decomposition into ideals and the orthogonal central idempotents summing up to the unity 1. Also, each R_i itself is a ring on its own right, the unity given by e_i, and, as a ring, R is the product ring R_1 \\times \\cdots \\times R_n. For example, again take R = \\mathsf{M}_n(D). This ring is a simple ring; in particular, it has no nontrivial decomposition into two-sided ideals. == Types of decomposition == There are several types of direct sum decompositions that have been studied: *Semisimple decomposition: a direct sum of simple modules. *Indecomposable decomposition: a direct sum of indecomposable modules. *A decomposition with local endomorphism rings calls a module strongly indecomposable if nonzero and has local endomorphism ring. (cf. #Azumaya's theorem): a direct sum of modules whose endomorphism rings are local rings (a ring is local if for each element x, either x or 1 - x is a unit element). *Serial decomposition: a direct sum of uniserial modules (a module is uniserial if the lattice of submodules is a finite chain). Since a simple module is indecomposable, a semisimple decomposition is an indecomposable decomposition (but not conversely). If the endomorphism ring of a module is local, then, in particular, it cannot have a nontrivial idempotent: the module is indecomposable. Thus, a decomposition with local endomorphism rings is an indecomposable decomposition. A direct summand is said to be maximal if it admits an indecomposable complement. A decomposition M = \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} M_i is said to complement maximal direct summands if for each maximal direct summand L of M, there exists a subset J \\subset I such that :M = \\left(\\bigoplus_{j \\in J} M_j \\right) \\bigoplus L. Two decompositions M = \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} M_i = \\bigoplus_{j \\in J} N_j are said to be equivalent if there is a bijection \\varphi : I \\overset{\\sim}\\to J such that for each i \\in I, M_i \\simeq N_{\\varphi(i)}. If a module admits an indecomposable decomposition complementing maximal direct summands, then any two indecomposable decompositions of the module are equivalent. == Azumaya's theorem == In the simplest form, Azumaya's theorem states: given a decomposition M = \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} M_i such that the endomorphism ring of each M_i is local (so the decomposition is indecomposable), each indecomposable decomposition of M is equivalent to this given decomposition. The more precise version of the theorem states: still given such a decomposition, if M = N \\oplus K, then # if nonzero, N contains an indecomposable direct summand, # if N is indecomposable, the endomorphism ring of it is local and K is complemented by the given decomposition: #:M = M_j \\oplus K and so M_j \\simeq N for some j \\in I, # for each i \\in I, there exist direct summands N' of N and K' of K such that M = M_i \\oplus N' \\oplus K'. The endomorphism ring of an indecomposable module of finite length is local (e.g., by Fitting's lemma) and thus Azumaya's theorem applies to the setup of the Krull\u2013Schmidt theorem. Indeed, if M is a module of finite length, then, by induction on length, it has a finite indecomposable decomposition M = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n M_i, which is a decomposition with local endomorphism rings. Now, suppose we are given an indecomposable decomposition M = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^m N_i. Then it must be equivalent to the first one: so m = n and M_i \\simeq N_{\\sigma(i)} for some permutation \\sigma of \\\\{ 1, \\dots, n \\\\}. More precisely, since N_1 is indecomposable, M = M_{i_1} \\bigoplus (\\bigoplus_{i=2}^n N_i) for some i_1. Then, since N_2 is indecomposable, M = M_{i_1} \\bigoplus M_{i_2} \\bigoplus (\\bigoplus_{i=3}^n N_i) and so on; i.e., complements to each sum \\bigoplus_{i=l}^n N_i can be taken to be direct sums of some M_i's. Another application is the following statement (which is a key step in the proof of Kaplansky's theorem on projective modules): *Given an element x \\in N, there exist a direct summand H of N and a subset J \\subset I such that x \\in H and H \\simeq \\bigoplus_{j \\in J} M_j. To see this, choose a finite set F \\subset I such that x \\in \\bigoplus_{j \\in F} M_j. Then, writing M = N \\oplus L, by Azumaya's theorem, M = (\\oplus_{j \\in F} M_j) \\oplus N_1 \\oplus L_1 with some direct summands N_1, L_1 of N, L and then, by modular law, N = H \\oplus N_1 with H = (\\oplus_{j \\in F} M_j \\oplus L_1) \\cap N. Then, since L_1 is a direct summand of L, we can write L = L_1 \\oplus L_1' and then \\oplus_{j \\in F} M_j \\simeq H \\oplus L_1', which implies, since F is finite, that H \\simeq \\oplus_{j \\in J} M_j for some J by a repeated application of Azumaya's theorem. In the setup of Azumaya's theorem, if, in addition, each M_i is countably generated, then there is the following refinement (due originally to Crawley\u2013J\u00f3nsson and later to Warfield): N is isomorphic to \\bigoplus_{j \\in J} M_j for some subset J \\subset I. (In a sense, this is an extension of Kaplansky's theorem and is proved by the two lemmas used in the proof of the theorem.) According to , it is not known whether the assumption \"M_i countably generated\" can be dropped; i.e., this refined version is true in general. == Decomposition of a ring == On the decomposition of a ring, the most basic but still important observation, known as the Artin\u2013Wedderburn theorem is this: given a ring R, the following are equivalent: # R is a semisimple ring; i.e., {}_R R is a semisimple left module. # R \\simeq \\prod_{i=1}^r \\mathsf{M}_{m_i}(D_i) where \\mathsf{M}_n(D) denotes the ring of n-by-n matrices and the positive integers r, m_1, \\dots, m_r are determined by R (but D_i's are not determined by R). # Every left module over R is semisimple. To see the equivalence of the first two, note: if {}_R R \\simeq \\bigoplus_{i=1}^r I_i^{\\oplus m_i} where I_i are mutually non-isomorphic left minimal ideals, then, with the view that endomorphisms act from the right, :R \\simeq \\operatorname{End}({}_R R) \\simeq \\bigoplus_{i=1}^r \\operatorname{End}(I_i^{\\oplus m_i}) where each \\operatorname{End}(I_i^{\\oplus m_i}) can be viewed as the matrix ring over the division ring D_i = \\operatorname{End}(I_i). (The converse is because the decomposition of 2. is equivalent to a decomposition into minimal left ideals = simple left submodules.) The equivalence 1. \\Leftrightarrow 3\\. is because every module is a quotient of a free module and a quotient of a semisimple module is clearly semisimple. == See also == *pure-injective module == Notes == == References == * *Frank W.
