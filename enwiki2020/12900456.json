Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican Publishing Company, 2002. In common usage, a somewhat larger area surrounding these borders is often also referred to as part of Mid-City. ==Geography== Mid-City is located at and has an elevation of . According to the United States Census Bureau, the district has a total area of , all land. Mid-City is located, as the name indicates, in the middle of New Orleans on what was once the backslope of the Mississippi River natural levee, a gradually declining section of the river's flood plain. As such, it was not settled as early as adjacent neighborhoods and was called the \"back of town\"\u2014the city ended at the swamp, unlike today, when the city reaches the lake. The Esplanade Ridge and the adjoining Metairie Ridge formed a natural spur from the River; but what is now Mid-City, surrounded by these higher- elevated sections, was part of the \"backswamp\" until development in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Neighborhood organization's statistics ===Adjacent neighborhoods=== * Navarre (north) * City Park (north) * Bayou St. John (north) * Tulane/Gravier (east) * Gert Town (south) * Dixon (west) * Lakewood (west) ===Boundaries=== The City Planning Commission defines the boundaries of Mid-City as these streets: City Park Avenue, Toulouse Street, North Carrollton Avenue, Orleans Avenues, Bayou St. John, St. Louis Street, North Broad Street and the Pontchartrain Expressway. ==Demographics== As of the census of 2000, there were 19,909 people, 5,830 households, and 2,939 families residing in the neighborhood. The population density was 11,993 /mi\u00b2 (4,630 /km\u00b2). As of the census of 2010, there were 14,633 people, 5,258 households, and 2,318 families residing in the neighborhood. Mid-City is one of New Orleans most racially diverse neighborhoods with its proximity to uptown, downtown and the suburbs contributing to its integrated diversity. ==Landmarks== Mid-City is the home of a number of city landmarks. Canal Street, one of the most important thoroughfares of the city, bisects the neighborhood down the middle; the streetcar route follows Canal to Carrollton Avenue, another prominent New Orleans street that passes through Mid-City. Tulane Avenue, which is the terminus of U.S. Route 61, also runs just upriver from Canal Street; before the interstate highway system, this was the primary route into New Orleans from Baton Rouge. An important cross-street is Jefferson Davis Parkway, named for the president of the Confederate States of America, who died in New Orleans's Garden District during an 1889 visit. The Orleans Parish Criminal Court, the Dixie Brewery, Jesuit High School, Warren Easton High School, and the Falstaff Brewery (now converted to apartments) are physically among the most prominent buildings scattered across Mid-City, in addition to a number of churches and large houses along Canal Street. Tulane Avenue in particular shows some remnants of the area's industrial past. However, more characteristic of Mid-City today are the many shotgun houses and larger houses that make up most of this primarily residential neighborhood. ==Culture== Running around the New Year bonfire in Mid-City New Orleans (2006) Mid-City is a generally local, middle-class neighborhood in that it contains fewer tourist destinations than other parts of the city. Restaurants and bars rely heavily on local clientele, giving the area a quirky local flavor. In the period before Hurricane Katrina on New Year's Eve, residents of Mid-City placed their Christmas trees in an area in Orleans Avenue and created a bonfire with the trees. They then threw fireworks into the bonfire.
