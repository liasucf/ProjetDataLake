    "text": "Sodium hydroselenide is a chemical compound, an inorganic salt; each unit consists of one sodium, one selenium, and one hydrogen atom. ==Production== Sodium hydroselenide can be made by reducing selenium with sodium borohydride: : Se + NaBH4 \u2192 NaSeH + BH3(g) Alternatively it can be made from sodium ethoxide exposed to hydrogen selenide: : NaOEt + H2Se \u2192 NaSeH + HOEt Sodium hydroselenide is not made for storage, instead it is used immediately after production in a fume hood thanks to the appalling odour of hydrogen selenide. ==Properties== Sodium hydroselenide dissolves in water or ethanol. In humid air sodium hydroselenide is changed to sodium polyselenide and elemental selenium. Sodium hydroselenide is slightly reducing. ==Use== In organic synthesis, hydrogen sodium hydroselenide is a nucleophillic agent for insertion of selenium. ==References== Category:Sodium compounds Category:Selenides ",
