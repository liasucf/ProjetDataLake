    "text": "Wangen im Allg\u00e4u is a historic city in southeast Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany. It lies north-east of Lake Constance in the Westallg\u00e4u. It is the second- largest city (Population: 27,157 in 2005) in the Ravensburg district and is a nexus for the surrounding communities. From 1938 to 1972, Wangen was the county seat of the Wangen rural district. ==Geography== Wangen in Allg\u00e4u lies on the north bank of the Obere Argen. The Untere Argen flows past northwest Wangen and unites southwest of the city with the Obere Argen. The city today is shaped by its historical town center as well as by numerous nearby districts. ===Neighboring municipalities=== Several settlements border Wangen. Their names are as follows: Amtzell, Vogt, Ki\u00dflegg, Argenb\u00fchl, and Achberg (Ravensburg district), Hergatz and Hergensweiler (Lindau district), and Neukirch (Bodensee district). ==History== The city was first mentioned in 815 under the name \"Wangun\" in a monastery document. In 1217, Emperor Fredrick II declared in a document that Wangen should remain in royal hands. In 1286, King Rudolph I granted Wangen the status of free imperial city. During the late Middle Ages, the city's growth was amplified by its central location at the crossroads between Ravensburg, Lindau, Leutkirch, and Isny and the growing trade through the Alps. A picture of Wangen during the 17th century The Ravensburg Gate Wangen's production and export of manufactured goods, particularly scythes and canvas, gave the city a tremendous positive trade balance. This surplus money was used to acquire lands outside of the city walls, thus giving Wangen a safeguard against economic fluctuations. During the German Mediatisation, in 1802, Wangen lost its status as a Free City and was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bavaria; it later changed hands in 1810 to the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg. In 1936, the city was officially named \"Wangen in Allg\u00e4u\". From 1938 up unto its dissolution and integration into the Ravensburg district in 1972, Wangen was the capital of the Wangen rural district. In 1973, Wangen was officially designated by the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state government to Gro\u00dfen Kreisstadt (large district town) due to its population having reached 20,000. In 1999, the largest flood in the most recent 50 years of Wangen's history completely flooded the lower city. The city was again flooded in 2006 by the Obere Argen. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the national team of Togo stayed in Wangen. ==Main sights== Despite several major fires in 1539, 1793, and 1858, the old part of the town remains a juxtaposition of architectural elements ranging from those of the early middle ages to those of the late baroque era. The Oberstadtkirche St. Martin (\"St Martin's Upper City Church\") is one of Wangen's oldest buildings. The church was already present in the 9th century; it was renovated numerous times in the following years. It contains both Romanesque and Gothic architecture. The Ravensburg Gate is the city's prime landmark. It was first mentioned in 1472, but was probably changed to its current appearance in 1608. The building is decorated with Renaissance-era artwork. Similarly aged relics of the old city include the Lindau Gate and the Pfaffenturm tower. The local history museum, Heimatmuseum in der Eselm\u00fchle, was opened in 1974 in a former mill acquired by the city in 1969. The museum displays the original mechanisms of the mill in addition to a collections from various spans of the city's history. ===Population growth=== {| | valign=\"top\" | {|class=\"wikitable\" !
