    "text": "\"Site of Mark's Hall\" shown on a late 19th century Ordnance Survey map Marks (or Mark's Hall) was a manor house located near Marks Gate at the northern tip of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham in London, England, the house standing on what is now Warren Hall Farm. The name Marks (historically Markes) is believed to have been derived from the de Merk family who build the original manor in the 14th Century. The manor house was demolished in 1808. ==History== The Manor lay partly in the parish of Dagenham and partly in the Liberty of Havering with notable burials and marriages being carried out in the parish church in Romford, located in the market place. The origins of the manor can be traced back to the De Merk family, with Simon de Merk recorded in 1330 and Robert de Merk in 1352, although the first record of a house on this site is in 1386. While originally constructed by the De Merk family, by 1488 the manor was owned by the Heton Family and was still in the same family in 1556 when the manor was described as having 3 messuages, 300 acres land, 80 acres meadow, 200 acres pasture, 60 acres wood located variously in the parishes of Havering, Hornchurch, Dagenham and Barking. The owners, Thomas and Elizabeth Hales, sold the manor in 1557 to James Bacon and in 1584 it was claimed by Lady Anne Bacon and granted by her to her son Francis Bacon. However a survey made for him soon after this describes the building as a great house in decay and there does not seem to be any evidence that Francis Bacon ever resided at Marks, so that by 1589 George Hervey had been installed as tenant, going on to purchase the manor outright in 1596 for \u00a31500. On his death in 1605 Sir George Hervey bequeathed 'the Manor of marks in Hornchurch in the Liberty of Havering-atte-Bower held freehold' to his son Sir Gawyn Hervie, Knight who lived there until his death in 1627. An illustration titled 'Marks House' showing a moated Elizabethan house probably dates from around this time, and a map dated 1618 shows Marks house as being just within the Liberty of Havering with a windmill nearby to the East. Gawen Hervey left the manor to his nephew Carew Hervey Mildmay, and as he was a Parliamentary commander in the Civil War Marks was attacked in June 1648 by Royalists on their way to Chelmsford, although the house appears to have remained in the family as a document of 1652 is signed by Carew Mildmay of Marks.. In 1666 the manor consisted of the main manor house with outbuildings, a yard, gardens and an orchard. An extensive collection of archives of the estate is held by the National Archives. ==References== Category:Manor houses in England Category:Demolished buildings and structures in England Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1808 ",
