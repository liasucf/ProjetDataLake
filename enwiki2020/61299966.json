    "text": "Demetrius Vicsadoli (; died after 1351) was a Hungarian clergyman in the first half of the 14th century, who was elected Archbishop of Kalocsa by the cathedral chapter in 1311, but Pope John XXII decreed that the election would be annulled and appointed Ladislaus J\u00e1nki instead. ==Background== His origin is uncertain. He owned a portion of land along the fort of Vicsadol in Valk\u00f3 County, near present-day Vu\u010dedol (\"Wolf's Valley\"), located six kilometers downstream from the town of Vukovar, Croatia. Vicsadoli served as provost of the cathedral chapter of Kalocsa at least from 1309 to 1351. He was a well- educated cleric, skilled in canon law. ==Archbishop-elect== After the death of Vincent in the summer of 1311, Vicsadoli was elected as his successor by the joint session of the cathedral chapter of Kalocsa and the collegiate chapter of B\u00e1cs (today Ba\u010d, Serbia). He requested papal legate, Gentile Portino da Montefiore to confirm his election and even paid a procuratio of 18 marks to the papal legate. However, Gentile was recalled to the Roman Curia by Pope Clement V in order to participate in the Council of Vienne. Gentile left Hungary on 10 September 1311. Pope Clement required a personal appearance of Vicsadoli before the Holy See, but the archbishop-elect was unable to travel to Avignon, because the lands of his archdiocese was threatened and seized by the Serbian troops of Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin. Vicsadoli sent his envoys to the Council of Vienne, but the pope refused to meet the delegation, which then continued to travel to Malause in the Diocese of Vaison, but the audience did not happen here either. There, Pope Clement commissioned cardinal Pietro Colonna studying the case. The pope called on the archbishop-elect to visit the court personally on 29 December 1312. It is not known whether the trip has been occurred or not. Despite the lack of confirmation of his election, Vicsadoli functioned as apostolic administrator of the archdiocese. Pope Clement V died in April 1314, and his successor, Pope John XXII was elected only after a two-year period of election procedure and took office in August 1316. The new pope established a committee of cardinals in order to fill the position of Archbishop of Kalocsa. After hearing its report, Pope John decreed that the election of Vicsadoli would be annulled for \"some reason\", as his charter indicated. Historian Menyh\u00e9rt \u00c9rd\u00fajhelyi considered Vicsadoli was a domestic opponent to the ruling Capetian House of Anjou or he was not a favored subject in the royal court. Charles I of Hungary proposed his protege and personal confessor Ladislaus J\u00e1nki to become the new archbishop. Pope John appointed J\u00e1nki as Archbishop of Kalocsa on 3 July 1317. == References == == Sources == * * Category:Archbishops of Kalocsa Category:13th-century Hungarian people Category:14th-century Hungarian people ",
