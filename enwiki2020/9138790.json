In 1826, he presented his work to Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich of Russia, who accepted the young man under her patronage and entered him into the St. Petersburg Academy of Fine Arts. After obtaining two silver medals, Zhivago finished his formation and soon left for his own calculation, into Italy, where he painted copies of famous Italian paintings for a living. For these works, on his return to Saint Petersburg, in 1839, it was acknowledged as an academician.\u0416\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0433\u043e \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0451\u043d \u0410\u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0441\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 In 1842, he obtained the title of professor.
