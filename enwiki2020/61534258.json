Should spread like wild fire in > the days to come. Flip's a fetching thump-a-rhythm entry that highlites a > delightful vocal duet by Ike & Tina. == Track listing == == Chart performance == ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1962) !Peak position |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | align=\"center\" |38 |- |US Billboard Hot R&B; Sides | align=\"center\" |4 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 | align=\"center\" |23 |- |US Cash Box Top 50 R&B; | align=\"center\" |5 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1962) !Rank |- |US Cash Box Top R&B; Records |align=\"center\"|17 |} == References == Category:1961 singles Category:1961 songs Category:Ike & Tina Turner songs Category:Songs written by Ike Turner Category:Song recordings produced by Ike Turner Category:Sue Records singles ",
