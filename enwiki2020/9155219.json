As she moved north he harried the Lancastrian rear and captured some weapons on the road to Tewkesbury. He fought at the battle of Tewkesbury and was knighted. Soon after, his adulterous wife, Elizabeth, was accused of conspiring his death, with her relation and Beauchamp's litigious neighbour, Thomas Burdet. John Stacey and Thomas Blake were also involved and all three were later accused of imagining the King's death. Burdet and Stacey were hanged at Tyburn. Blake was pardoned. ==Family== On 27 January 1447 in his private chapel at Beauchamp's Court, Alcester, Warwickshire he married Elizabeth, daughter of Humphrey Stafford of Grafton by special licence.Douglas Richardson: Magna Carta Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, 2nd Edition 2011 Their children were: * Sir John, died young * Elizabeth (d.1503), married, Robert Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby de Broke (d. 1521),John Britton: The Beauties of Wiltshire: Volume 3 p.399 * Anne, married, Richard Lygon, of Madresfield, Worcs * Margaret, married, William Rede of Gloucester (father of Richard Rede/Reade).Plantagenet Ancestry of Seventeenth-Century Colonists 2nd Ed. by David Faris Beauchamp died on 19 January 1502/1503, at BroomhillDouglas Richardson: Magna Carta Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, 2nd Edition 2011 when the Barony expired.
