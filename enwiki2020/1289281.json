Moses de Le\u00f3n (c. 1240 - 1305), known in Hebrew as Moshe ben Shem-Tov (), was a Spanish rabbi and Kabbalist who is considered the composer or redactor of the Zohar. It is a matter of controversyThe Jewish Encyclopedia if the Zohar is his own work, or if he took traditions going back to Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai and committed them to writing. His other works include Sefer ha-Rimon, written in Hebrew. ==Life== He was born in Le\u00f3n, Spain, Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, then united with the Crown of Castile. He might have been born in Guadalajara and his surname, then, comes from his father, Shem-Tov de Le\u00f3n. He spent 30 years in Guadalajara and Valladolid before moving to \u00c1vila, where he spent the rest of his life. He died at Ar\u00e9valo in 1305 while returning to his home. ==References== ==Resources== :*Kohler, Kaufmann et al. Leon, Moses (Ben Shem-Tob) de.\" Jewish Encyclopedia.
