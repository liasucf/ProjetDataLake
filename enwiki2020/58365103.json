    "text": "Big Mother Gig is an alternative rock band originally founded in Milwaukee, WI and currently based in Los Angeles, CA, founded by Richard Jankovich. While attending Marquette University in Milwaukee in the 1990s, Richard Jankovich formed Big Mother Gig with Rob Due, Jason Borkowicz and Charles Watson. In 1993, they released \"My Social Commentary.\" In 1994, Rob Due was replaced by Riz Rashid and they released \"Transition EP.\" Borkowicz and Watson left in 1995 and we're ultimately replaced by Brady Roehl (drums) and Matt Deede (bass.) In 1996, Big Mother Gig released \"Smiling Politely\" and broke up when Jankovich moved to New York City. From 1992 to 1996, Big Mother Gig played over 150 concerts around the Midwest. Other prior members include Joe Neumann and Brian Rutkowski. In 2016, Big Mother Gig released their entire discography digitally for the first time and announced a new EP as well as a reunion show in Milwaukee featuring 3/4s of the classic 1996 line-up. Almost Primed, their first new music in over 20 years, was released in March 2017. The band, now based in Los Angeles with Jankovich, Mike Datz (guitar), Micah Lopez (bass) and Albert Kurniawan (drums), continued to drop a series of singles through 2017 and 2018 including \"Nametag\", \"The Great Heist\", \"(Let's Make) Compelling Content\", and \"Obliterate\". On October 12, 2018, they released \"No More Questions\" which collected tracks from the EP, the singles they had released throughout 2018 and brand new songs including \"Low Payout\" featuring Dicky Barrett (The Mighty Mighty Bosstones) and \"Our Cover's Blown\" featuring Britta Phillips (Luna) and co-written with author Rick Moody. Their post-reunion work has been praised by Alternative Press, Paste, Under The Radar, New Noise, Impose, AllThingsGo, Substream, and PureGrainAudio. \"(Let's Make) Compelling Content\" was Song Of The Day on NPR/The Current and appeared twice on the Submodern Radio Chart. The music video for \"Obliterate\" stars Michael Ornstein from Sons Of Anarchy. Their recent recordings were recorded with Jeff Hamilton (Violent Femmes) and Dan Long (Spiral Stairs), and mastered by Kramer. Now based in Los Angeles, Big Mother Gig has played shows around the Midwest and California with Luna, Soccer Mommy, Gin Blossoms, Peelander-Z, and many more. == Discography == * 2018: No More Questions (LP) * 2017: Almost Primed (EP) * 2016: Quintessentially Average: 92-96 (LP) * 1996: Smiling Politely (LP) * 1994: Transition (EP) * 1993: My Social Commentary (LP) ==References== Category:Alternative rock groups from Wisconsin ",
