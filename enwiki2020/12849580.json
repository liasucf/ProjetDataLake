It was written and produced by both Babyface and Daryl Simmons for the band's fourth studio album, 3D (2002), and released as the album's second single following \"Girl Talk\" in the United States in November 2002. A minor commercial success, the sensual mid- tempo song became the band's first single release to neither enter the US Billboard Hot 100 nor the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks component chart. It however reached the top thirty on the Billboard Hot Singles Sales chart. Released to positive reviews, \"Hands Up\" garnered TLC a nomination at the 2004 Grammy Awards for Best R&B; Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. An accompanying music video, directed by Matthew Rolston, features a cameo appearance by Countess Vaughn. A remix featuring Jermaine Dupri and The Kid Slim was recorded, containing interpolations of \"Nasty Boy\" by The Notorious B.I.G.. ==Music video== The video was shot on January 10, 2003. TLC is reunited with Matthew Rolston, director of their videos for \"Creep\" and \"Red Light Special\", for the music video of the song. In it, band members T-Boz and Chilli are at a futuristic strip club where several of the male strippers have tattoos of UPCs and they are scanning them. A behind-the-scenes footage was shown on BET's Access Granted. The video was released as a DVD single along with the video for \"Girl Talk\". ==Track listing== ;US 12\" single # \"Hands Up\" \u2013 4:16 # \"Hands Up\" \u2013 4:16 # \"Hands Up\" \u2013 4:14 # \"Hands Up\" \u2013 3:48 # \"Hands Up\" \u2013 3:48 ;US DVD single # \"Hands Up\" \u2013 4:03 # \"Girl Talk\" \u2013 3:52 # Photo gallery slideshow \u2013 0:32 == Personnel and credits == Album version: credits adapted from CD liner notes.TLC \u2013 3D (CD liner notes) \u2013 Arista Records 74321-95937-2 * TLC: vocals * Babyface: writer, producer, all keyboards, drum programming, electric and acoustic guitars * Daryl Simmons: writer, producer * Debra Killings and Tavia Ivey: background vocals * Paul Boutin: recording * Craig Taylor: assistant engineer * Serban Ghenea: mixing * Tim Roberts: assistant mix engineer * John Hanes: Pro Tools engineer * Ivy Skoff: production coordinator ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2003) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles (OCC) | 109 |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2002 songs Category:2003 singles Category:Arista Records singles Category:Music videos directed by Matthew Rolston Category:TLC (group) songs Category:Songs about sexuality Category:Songs written by Babyface (musician) Category:Songs written by Daryl Simmons ",
