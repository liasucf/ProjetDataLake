In the same year, Jaro International started services to JFK International Airport, being the first Romanian airline apart from TAROM to fly over the Atlantic. In July 1997, the airline introduced weekly flights between Aurel Vlaicu and Montreal-Mirabel International Airport and Aurel Vlaicu and Toronto Pearson International Airport, where they stayed until 2000. These routes were abandoned because of the high competition from Tarom which was operating at Dorval and Pearson. In September 2001, the airline declared bankruptcy and made its last long haul flight and its last one from New York City. ==Services== In July 1997, Jaro was flying to three intercontinental and 17 European destinations: North America: Montreal, New York City and Toronto Europe: Bucharest, D\u00fcsseldorf, Vienna, Frankfurt, Girona, Hanover, London, Ostend (cargo only), Hamburg, Skopje, Palma de Mallorca, Berlin, Malta, Cologne, Southend (cargo only), Stockholm ==Fleet== Jaro BAC 1-11 at D\u00fcsseldorf in 1996(at July 2000) *3 Boeing 707 (one cargo) *2 BAC 1-11 *1 Yakovlev Yak-42 ==External links== *Photos on airliners.net ==References== Category:Defunct airlines of Romania Category:Airlines established in 1991 Category:Airlines disestablished in 2001 Category:Romanian companies established in 1991 ",
