Miriello is the director ofhttp://miriellografico.com/mg/ Miriello Grafico and a founding member of the San Diego Chapter of the American Institute of Graphic Arts. In 2008, he was recognized as an AIGA national fellow. == Biography == Miriello studied at Colorado State University and completed his design degree in Italy at La Poggerina, operated by the University of Texas. In 1989, Miriello was instrumental in acquiring an important collection of 300 historical graphic posters from the government of the Soviet Union that depicted contemporary Soviet life in the periods during Perestroika and Glasnost. Working with members of the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) San Diego chapter, this exhibition was supported by a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts. The rare collection of posters held at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, showcased political themes, social issues and the arts. The collection then traveled to a variety of U.S. locations, after the fall of the Soviet Union. The posters were designed between 1986 and 1989 by the Union of Soviet Artists members. The original posters were collected and curated by Oleg Savostiuk, Secretary to the Union of Soviet Artists and he attended the original opening in La Jolla. In March 2013, the Soviet Poster Show collection was uncrated at the City Gallery in a new exhibition called Dialogues in downtown San Diego. The Soviet historical posters were featured alongside new works created by contemporary artists, designers and illustrators including Sean Adams, Rafael L\u00f3pez, Joel Nakamura and Michael Osborne, among others. To complement their historical counterparts the new posters featured political, social and arts themes as well as a visual or conceptual reference to Soviet culture. Ron Miriello served on the Design Innovation Institute advisory board, the San Diego Center City Advisory Council, Business Roundtable for Education,http://www.sandiego.gov/arts-culture/ Commission for Arts and Culture/San Diego Advisory board member for thehttp://www.sandiegoitalianfilmfestival.com/index.php San Diego Italian Film Festival. In 2008, Ron Miriello, Margo Chase, Rian Hughes and Alex White co- authored the book Really Good Logos Explained critiquing the logo work of top designers. In the text, Miriello discusses how working designers must keep their thinking elastic and pliable and how this requires both right and left brain thinking at the same time. As a child, Miriello was fascinated with globes. A sculptor, he produced 100 sculptures inspired by the metaphor of the world globe which culminated in the 100 Worlds Project exhibit. The exhibit incorporated craftspeople and makers as collaborators, reconnecting the arts with the guild tradition of craft. For this exhibition Miriello produced fifty interpreted globes, using a variety of materials that included antique pipe wrenches, bowling balls, the propellers of boats and corrugated cardboard. The globes were then given to forty San Diego based photographers who spent a week with each sculpture and documented it through personal photography. Their original photographic prints were displayed at the Jett Gallery and included in an exhibition book. In 2016 the globes were exhibited at San Diego's Lindbergh field in Terminal 2. In 2016 he started a bicycle event, 100Miglia, making it possible for cyclists to explore one hundred miles of farm routes and old castles. ==Books== * * * * * ==References== ==External links== *Miriello Grafico *AIGA San Diego Chapter *Design Innovation Institute *Colorado State University *100 Worlds Project *Lancia Trendvisions *Where We Work Category:1953 births Category:American graphic designers Category:Living people Category:People from Cranford, New Jersey ",
