The press release announced that each member franchise would play year round, in both indoor and outdoor professional leagues. ===2007 season=== For 2007, the CMISL played a \"Showcase Season\" or an exhibition schedule to create interest and test the markets.

Unlike previous years, all goals are worth one point. Teams consist of six players, including the goalkeeper, on the floor at any one time. The players are changed on the fly, like in hockey. Also like hockey, at times teams will be required to play one or even two players short. These situations, are a result of a player being shown a blue card. A blue card requires the offending player to serve a two- or four-minute penalty depending on the severity of the offense. A single game is composed of four 15-minute quarters. In the few instances where doubleheaders are scheduled, the games will then be shortened to two 20-minute halves. During exhibition matches if the teams are tied at the end of the regulation time, a penalty shootout will occur to determine the winner. ==References== ==External links== * PASL * CMISL * Calgary United FC * Edmonton Drillers * Saskatoon Accelerators * Winnipeg Alliance FC * Prince George Fury Category:Indoor soccer competitions Category:Professional Arena Soccer League Category:Indoor soccer in Canada Category:Defunct soccer leagues in Canada Category:Sports leagues established in 2007 Category:2007 establishments in Canada Category:2012 disestablishments in Canada ",
