    "text": "The River Road Wine Trail is a Salinas Valley roadway trail for wine-tasting following the River Road along the western banks of the Salinas River (California). It is not to be confused with the Great River Road Wine Trail that follows along the banks of the Mississippi River. It is notably referenced in numerous books and magazines. ==History== The River Road (Monterey County, California G-17) follows along the banks of the Salinas River and predates the wineries by many decades. It runs along the length of the Santa Lucia Highlands AVA. The earliest grape plantings, however, were in the 1790s, with the arrival of the Spanish missions in California. The arrival of commercial wineries (and wine-tasting), began in the early 1970s, with initial plantings by Smith at Paraiso, by McFarland at Sleepy Hollow, by Johnson at La Estancia, and by Hahn at Smith & Hook. The hot days of the Salinas Valley make for good Syrahs, and the cool foggy nights are ideal for Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and other cool-climate varieties. Currently there are at least 24 wineries in the Salinas Valley with at least 13 tasting rooms lining River Road, going from Salinas, California south to Greenfield, California. They are perched on the Santa Lucia Highlands, and present great views of the rich farmlands below. The Salinas River Wine Trail was named by Wine Enthusiast Magazine in the top ten wine travel destinations in the world, with only two other locations (New York and Oregon) from North America. ==Distance to wine-tasting facilities== The Wine-Tasting Facilities are usually encountered driving south from Highway 68 where it crosses the Salinas River. Using that as a starting point, the Wine-Tasting distances are tabulated below: 1\\. Odonata Wines South \u2022 645 River Road, Salinas \u2013 7 mi. 2\\. Pessagno Winery \u2022 1645 River Rd, Salinas \u2013 16 mi. 3\\. Manzoni Vineyards \u2022 30981 River Road, Soledad \u2013 17 mi. 4\\. Puma Road Winery \u2022 32720 River Road, Soledad \u2013 23 mi. 5\\. Wrath Wines \u2022 35801 Foothill Road, Soledad \u2013 24 mi. 6\\. Hahn Family \u2022 37700 Foothill Road, Soledad \u2013 26 mi. 7\\. Smith Family Wines \u2022 38060 Paraiso Springs Road, Soledad \u2013 31 mi. 8\\. Ventana Vineyards \u2022 38740 Los Coches Road, Soledad \u2013 35 mi. ==Nearby wine trail== At the end of the River Road Wine Trail is the start of another wine trail. At Greenfield, if one takes the Arroyo Seco Road westward, it branches into the Carmel Valley Road from which one can then take the Carmel Valley Wine Trail northwards, passing Carmel Valley Village, California and ending up in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. ==References== ==External links== * River Road Wine Trail * Manzoni Wines * Scheid Vineyards * Smith Family Wines * Hahn Wines * Pessagno Wines * Wrath Wines * Talbott Vineyards * Boekenoogen Wines * McIntyre Vineyards * Map of Wineries Category:Salinas, California Category:Trails ",
