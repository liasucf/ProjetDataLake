Musselburgh: Goblinshead. p. 65 ==History== The Dunbars of Westfield owned the property for almost three centuries from 1533-4. It was a gift from King James V to Archibald Duncan. ==Structure== Little remains of the castle: only a length of the south wall with the springing of at least three walls on its north face, and the remains of an entrance gateway lying to the north. The gateway dates from the 17th century, and are described as a good example of Renaissance work.Baldoon Castle The gate piers which were part of the entrance to the castle with bands of stylised rock-faced rustication alternating with lozenges. They are topped by cornices and moulded scroll caps. The gate piers are registered as a Category A Listed Building. ==Tradition== It is said that the ghost of Janet Dalrymple of Carscreugh haunts the ruin, in a bloodied wedding dress. Janet was forced to marry Sir David Dunbar of Carscreugh Castle although she had fallen in love with another man, the impoverished Archibald 3rd Lord Rutherfurd. She either was murdered on her wedding night or died insane shortly afterward. The story is the basis for both Sir Walter Scott\u2019s The Bride of Lammermoor and Gaetano Donizetti\u2019s opera Lucia di Lammermoor.The Douglas Archives The Douglas Archives ==References== Category:Castles in Dumfries and Galloway Category:Category A listed buildings in Dumfries and Galloway ",
