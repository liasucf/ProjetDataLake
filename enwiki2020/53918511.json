The tank landing ship was decommissioned and returned to United States Navy custody on 4 May 1946, and struck from the Navy list on 19 June 1946. On 5 December 1947, LST-408 was sold to Bosey, Philippines, and subsequently scrapped. == See also == * List of United States Navy LSTs == Notes == ;Citations == Bibliography == Online resources * * * ==External links== * Category:Ships built in Baltimore Category:1942 ships Category:LST-1-class tank landing ships of the Royal Navy Category:World War II amphibious warfare vessels of the United Kingdom Category:S3-M2-K2 ships ",
