    "text": "Crimson White & Indigo is a live album by the American rock band the Grateful Dead. It contains the complete concert recorded at John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia on July 7, 1989. The album consists of three CDs, plus a video recording of the same show on one DVD. It was released on April 20, 2010. The Video was Produced and Directed by Len Dell'Amico. This concert was the last event held at JFK Stadium, which was condemned by the city six days later and would be demolished in 1992. One track from this concert, \"Blow Away\", had been previously released as a bonus track on the expanded version of the Grateful Dead's last studio album, Built To Last. The previous concert in this tour, performed at Rich Stadium in Buffalo, New York, on July 4, 1989, was released in 2005 as the album Truckin' Up to Buffalo. That title also was produced on both CD and DVD, but separately rather than together in the same package. The name Crimson White & Indigo is taken from the lyrics of the song \"Standing on the Moon\", which the Dead first performed earlier in 1989. The version of this song featured in this release is considered an exceptional performance by fans, with an extended ending improvisation. ==Track listing== ===Disc one=== First set: #\"Hell In A Bucket\" (Bob Weir, John Barlow) \u2013 6:49 #\"Iko Iko\" (James \"Sugar Boy\" Crawford) \u2013 7:46 #\"Little Red Rooster\" (Willie Dixon) \u2013 9:32 #\"Ramble On Rose\" (Jerry Garcia, Robert Hunter) \u2013 7:35 #\"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\" (Bob Dylan) \u2013 9:17 #\"Loser\" > (Garcia, Hunter) \u2013 7:15 #\"Let It Grow\" > (Weir, Barlow) \u2013 12:42 #\"Blow Away\" (Brent Mydland, Barlow) \u2013 12:28 ===Disc two=== Second set: #\"Box of Rain\" (Phil Lesh, Hunter) \u2013 4:46 #\"Scarlet Begonias\" > (Garcia, Hunter) \u2013 9:58 #\"Fire on the Mountain\" (Mickey Hart, Hunter) \u2013 13:42 #\"Estimated Prophet\" > (Weir, Barlow) \u2013 9:12 #\"Standing on the Moon\" > (Garcia, Hunter) \u2013 8:19 #\"Rhythm Devils\" > (Hart, Bill Kreutzmann) \u2013 10:08 ===Disc three=== #\"Space\" > (Garcia, Lesh, Weir) \u2013 10:09 #\"The Other One\" > (Weir, Kreutzmann) \u2013 7:47 #\"Wharf Rat\" > (Garcia, Hunter) \u2013 10:32 #\"Turn On Your Love Light\" (Joseph Scott, Deadric Malone) \u2013 8:20 Encore: # * \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" (Dylan) \u2013 8:41 ==Personnel== ===Grateful Dead=== *Jerry Garcia \u2013 guitar, vocals *Mickey Hart \u2013 drums, percussion *Bill Kreutzmann \u2013 drums, percussion *Phil Lesh \u2013 electric bass, vocals *Brent Mydland \u2013 keyboards, Hammond B3, vocals *Bob Weir \u2013 guitar, vocals ===Production=== *Producer \u2013 David Lemieux *Video Director - Len Dell'Amico *Recording \u2013 John Cutler *Stereo and 5.1 Mix \u2013 Michael McGinn *5.1 Stereo Mastering for CD and DVD \u2013 David Glasser at Airshow Mastering, Boulder, Colorado *Video Editing, DVD Production and Authoring \u2013 Video Arts, San Francisco *Video Producer \u2013 Len Dell'Amico *Cover Art \u2013 Scott McDougall *Art Direction and Design \u2013 Steve Vance *Photography \u2013 Robert Minkin *Essay \u2013 Steve Silberman ==Notes== Category:Grateful Dead live albums Category:2010 live albums Category:Grateful Dead Records live albums ",
