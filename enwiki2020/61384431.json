    "text": "Roland Juno-D is a polyphonic synthesizer introduced in 2005 by Roland Corporation. It is based on the Fantom-X series, having a vintage design that resembles the previous Juno synthesizers, such as the Juno-106. Despite having similar names and introductions, the Juno-D was not intended to be succeeded by the Juno-G synthesizer, for they were both released concurrently. A Limited Edition was released. ==Features== Apart from the Juno name, the Juno-D carries distinctions from the other Juno installments, for the synthesizer has connection to Roland's RS PCM machines. The synthesizer utilizes General MIDI 2 (GM2), D-Beam control, and two optional pedal inputs. 768 Patch locations (128 user-programmable) are available for use, plus 22 Rhythm sets and 40 Performance memories. Of the preset patches, 384 are described as \"Juno-D original\" and 256 conform to the GM2 spec. ==References== ==External links== * Roland Synth Chronicle: 1973\u20132014 * Roland - Roland US official site * - Official Limited Edition Roland Page * Musician's Friend review for JUNO-Gi by Jim Bybee (archive.org) * Synthblock - another review * Juno-G details and resources at Roland Clan Juno-D Category:Polyphonic synthesizers Category:Digital synthesizers Category:D-Beam ",
