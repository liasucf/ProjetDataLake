    "text": "''''' (, also ,\"kapellmeister\" (US) and ) is a German word designating a person in charge of music-making. The word is a compound, consisting of the roots ' (\"choir\", \"orchestra\" or, originally, \"chapel\") and ' (\"master\"). Originally used to refer to somebody in charge of music in a chapel, the term has evolved considerably in its meaning in response to changes in the musical profession. ==Historical usage== In German-speaking countries during the approximate period 1500\u20131800, the word Kapellmeister often designated the director of music for a monarch or nobleman. For English speakers, it is this sense of the term that is most often encountered, since it appears frequently in biographical writing about composers who worked in German-speaking countries. A Kapellmeister position was a senior one and involved supervision of other musicians. Johann Sebastian Bach worked from 1717 to 1723 as Kapellmeister for Prince Leopold of Anhalt-C\u00f6then. Joseph Haydn worked for many years as Kapellmeister for the Esterh\u00e1zy family, a high-ranking noble family of the Austrian Empire. George Frideric Handel served as Kapellmeister for George, Elector of Hanover (who eventually became King George I of Great Britain). A Kapellmeister might also be the director of music for a church. Thus, Georg Reutter was the Kapellmeister at St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, where his young choristers included both Joseph and Michael Haydn. Becoming a Kapellmeister was a mark of success for professional musicians. For instance, Joseph Haydn once remarked that he was glad his father (a wheelwright) had lived long enough to see his son become a Kapellmeister.Griesinger 1810, 16 The term also implied the possession of considerable musical skill. When the 18th century actor and musician Joachim Daniel Preisler heard the famous soprano Aloysia Weber (Mozart's sister-in-law) perform in her home, he paid her the following compliment in his diary: > The well-known Mozardt is her brother-in-law, and has taught her so well > that she accompanies from a score and plays interludes like a > Kapellmeister.Deutsch (1965, 324). Preisler's assumption that Weber's skills > came from Mozart's training is not specifically supported by modern > scholarship. By the end of the 18th century, many of the nobility had declined in their economic power relative to the newly prosperous middle class. Eventually, the maintenance of a ' became too expensive for most nobles, which led to a decline in the number of Kapellmeister positions. A well-known instance occurred in 1790, when Prince Anton Esterh\u00e1zy succeeded his father Nikolaus and dismissed almost all of the latter's extensive musical establishment.Haydn himself was retained in an essentially honorary role, but was free to pursue independent plans, his journeys to England; for details see Anton I, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy. But Prince Anton was hardly alone in doing this; during this same period, \"the steady decline in the number of orchestras supported by aristocratic families represented a ... change that affected all composers and their works.\"Jones (2009:324) This was a difficult time for musicians, who needed to find new ways to support themselves. For instance, Ludwig van Beethoven (1770\u20131827) never worked as a Kapellmeister, but was supported by a somewhat unreliable combination of noble patronage, publication, and concert income. ===The case of Mozart=== Mozart never was a Kapellmeister in the sense given above. In 1787, he was given a paid position in the court of the Austrian Emperor, as ' (\"chamber composer\"), but authority in matters musical at the court was exercised primarily by Antonio Salieri. In reviews, diaries, and advertising, Mozart was commonly referred to as \"\". It seems that Mozart's prestige, along with the fact that he frequently appeared in public directing other musicians, led to the use of \"Kapellmeister\" as a term of respect.For extensive discussion of the use of \"Kapellmeister\" to describe Mozart, see Deutsch 1965, 306\u2013307. In April 1791, Mozart applied to become the Kapellmeister at St. Stephen's Cathedral, and was designated by the City Council to take over this job following the death of the then-ailing incumbent, Leopold Hofmann. This never took place, since Mozart died (December 1791) before Hofmann did (1793).Deutsch 1965, 393\u2013395 ==Similar terms and equivalents== Variant spellings capellmeister and capelle, to refer to the orchestra or choir, are sometimes encountered in English language works about composers who held the title. The word ' specified that the Kapellmeister worked at a nobleman's court ('); a ' held a somewhat less senior position.Peter Terrell, ed. Collins German\u2013English, English\u2013German dictionary. 2nd edition, pp.356, 405. Equivalent positions existed in other European countries and were referred to with equivalent names. In Finnish kapellimestari is still the primary word used of conductors. ==Composers who held the post of Kapellmeister== (listed chronologically by date of birth) * Arnold von Bruck ( 1500\u20131554) was Kapellmeister in Vienna for Ferdinand I, King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia from 1527 to 1545. * Mattheus Le Maistre (c. 1505\u20131577) was Kapellmeister at the court of the Electors of Saxony in Dresden from 1554 to 1568. * Antonio Scandello (1517\u20131580) was Kapellmeister at the court of the Electors of Saxony in Dresden from 1568. * Jacob Regnart (1540s\u20131599) was Kapellmeister at Innsbruck from 1585 to about 1596. * Michael Praetorius (1571\u20131621) was Kapellmeister at Wolfenb\u00fcttel from 1604. * Heinrich Sch\u00fctz (1585\u20131673) was Kapellmeister to John George I, Elector of Saxony from 1619. * Samuel Scheidt (1587\u20131653) was Kapellmeister to the Margrave of Brandenburg. * Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber (1644\u20131704) was Kapellmeister in Salzburg from 1684. * Georg Muffat (1653\u20131704) was Kapellmeister to the bishop of Passau from 1690 to his death. * Agostino Steffani (1653\u20131728) was Kapellmeister from 1688 to 1698 at the court of Hanover. * Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer (died 1746) was Kapellmeister to Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, from at least 1695. * Johann Ludwig Bach (1677\u20131731), a second cousin of J.

When used today it designates the director or chief conductor of an orchestra or choir. It suggests involvement in orchestra or choir policy (for example, selecting repertoire, concert schedules, and guest conductors) as well as conducting. In military settings it refers to a bandmaster.Peter Terrell, ed. Collins German\u2013English, English\u2013German dictionary. 2nd edition, pp.380. The music director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra traditionally holds the old- fashioned title '. In other German opera houses, the term generally refers to a deputy conductor reporting to the ' (\"General Music Director\", usually also the chief conductor). An opera company may have several Kapellmeisters, ranked as ' (First...), ' (Second...), etc. The conductor Christian Thielemann has offered a nuanced account of the \"Dirigent\"/\"Kapellmeister\" distinction in contemporary usage. He suggests that \"Kapellmeister\" has unfairly acquired a sense of routine, or failure to project glamor: \"a Kapellmeister now describes a pale, meek figure beating time. A policeman on duty at the podium directing the musical traffic, no more.\" In fact, Thielemann, who is fully aware of the historical usage of the term, would himself prefer to be called a \"Kapellmeister\": \"it implies such virtues as knowledge of a work, great ability, and dedication to the cause of music\".Thielemann (2016: unpaginated) The term \"Kapellmeister Tradition\" is commonly used to describe these qualities, as exemplified by such historically important conductors as Otto Klemperer, Klemens Krauss, and Erich Kleiber, in the sense that they have \"paid their dues\" on their way to international fame.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/otmar-suitner-conductor- who-was-the-last-surviving-product-of-germanys-kapellmeister- tradition-1903928.html ==See also== * Cantor (Christianity) * * Composer * Music Bureau * Master of the Queen's Music, approximate British equivalent to royal and noble Kapellmeisters of Germany ==Notes== ==References== *Deutsch, Otto Erich (1965) Mozart: A Documentary Biography.
