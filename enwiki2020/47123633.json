    "text": "The NSW Aboriginal Land Council (NSWALC) is the peak representative body of Aboriginal Australians in New South Wales. It has the mandate, under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW), to develop land rights among Aboriginal people in New South Wales through its network of 120 Local Aboriginal Land Councils (LALC). Its functions include the creation of an economic base for Aboriginal communities, as well as the continued passing and enhancement of Aboriginal culture, identity and heritage through the management of traditional sites and other cultural materials within NSW. It acts as an advisor to governments and others to ensure the preservation of Aboriginal land rights. ==History== NSWALC was founded in 1977 to assist in the protests by Aboriginal people for their land rights. It submitted ten land claims to the government from 1977 to 1981, the first being the Terry Hie Hie claim in northwestern NSW. The claims also called for compensation for the damage to their livelihood and loss of land. A Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly upon Aborigines was formed in November 1978, chaired by Maurice Keane. The select committee proposed the formation of an Aboriginal Heritage Commission charged with the protection of sacred sites. It also proposed the formation of a land rights system centered on local Community Councils, backed by Aboriginal Regional Land Councils, and finally an Aboriginal Land Development Commission. ==Governance and functions== The NSWALC is an independent statutory corporation constituted under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (ALRA). Nine councillors, representing nine regional areas, are elected every four years. Its statutory functions include compliance with the regulations as well as financial management of New South Wales' network of land councils. There is an administrative section, overseen by a Chief Executive Officer. The head office is located in Parramatta, and there are five regional branch offices. Its mandate includes developing land rights among Aboriginal people in New South Wales, via its network of Local Aboriginal Land Councils, through land acquisition, by land claim or purchase, establishment of commercial businesses and community schemes to create an economic base for Aboriginal communities, as well as the continued passing and enhancement of Aboriginal culture, identity and heritage through the management of traditional sites and other cultural materials within NSW. The NSWALC's function includes advocacy for policies which benefit of the Aboriginal peoples of New South Wales, including representing them at the United Nations. ==Local Aboriginal Land Councils== NSWALC oversees a network of 120 Local Aboriginal Land Councils (LALCs), split into nine regions. ===Cummeragunja=== Cummeragunja, in the Wiradjuri region, is owned and managed by the Cummeragunja Local Aboriginal Land Council, having taken over from the Yorta Yorta Local Aboriginal Land Council since ownership was passed to it in 1984. ==Advocacy== After the new targets were announced by the federal government for its new Closing the Gap strategy, NSWALC chief executive James Christian said that the targets were not ambitious enough, in particular the justice goals. ==References== Category:Aboriginal land councils ",
