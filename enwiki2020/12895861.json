Here it grows in forests mostly along the coast, or elsewhere deeper inland where there is old secondary forest. Its natural habitat is gradually disappearing as forest is felled and land is cleared for human settlement. ==References== dardanoi Category:Plants described in 1950 Category:Endangered plants Category:Flora of Brazil Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
