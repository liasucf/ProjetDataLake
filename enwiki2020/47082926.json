Founded in 1994, the journal primarily covers environmental law and policy and related subjects with a regional focus in California, the Pacific Northwest, Alaska and Hawai'i.Journal Information, 21 vii (2015). == History and overview == The journal was established in 1994 as a regional journal \"that would contribute to an integrated understanding of environmental and natural resources policy.\"Brian E. Gray, Dedication, 14 29 (2008). The founding editors had the goal of establishing an \"interdisciplinary journal\" that would feature \"articles by legal scholars, practicing lawyers, biologists, economists, engineers, historians, hydrologists, land and resource managers, and other professionals.\" It is among several regional environmental law journals to focus specifically on issues related to California and the Pacific Northwest., Online Legal Publications: Hastings West-Northwest Journal of Environmental Law and Policy; see also Introduction, 3 xi (1995-1996). Although the journal primarily covers environmental law and policy, it includes complementary fields, such as economics, anthropology, regional planning, engineering, biology, and Earth sciences. The journal also features photography and other artwork relating to nature and the environment in California, Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and Hawai'i, .Brian King & Michael Linder, Introduction, 20 iii (2014).
