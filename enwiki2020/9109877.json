    "text": "Live from Austin, TX is an album by Waylon Jennings, released on New West Records in 2006. As part of New West's series of albums featuring individual artists' performances on Austin City Limits, it was recorded on April 1, 1989, several months after the release of Full Circle, Jennings' last album for MCA Records, and a year before the singer's move to Epic Records would yield The Eagle. The songs themselves primarily include popular selections from Jennings' own catalog: \"I'm a Ramblin' Man\", \"America\", \"Theme from The Dukes of Hazzard (Good Ol' Boys)\", \"Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)\" and \"Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\", among others.
