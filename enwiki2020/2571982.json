Craven's second feature, the live action short Bravery in the Field was nominated for an Academy Award. The next few years saw Craven starring in several comedy pilots. His first major dramatic film was the drama/horror/mystery cult favorite Jacob's Ladder which follows a haunted Vietnam vet as he attempts to discover his past while suffering from a severe case of dissociation. Craven starred as Michael, a chemist in the Army's chemical warfare division where he worked on a drug that was secretly given to the veteran's unit.
