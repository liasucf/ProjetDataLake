The seal itself was given to Haakon as a gift from Henry III of England in 1236 H\u00e1konar saga H\u00e1konarsonar (The Saga of Haakon Haakonarson) or H\u00e1konar saga gamla H\u00e1konarsonar is an Old Norse Kings' Saga, telling the story of the life and reign of King Haakon Haakonarson of Norway. ==Content and style== The circumstances of the saga's composition are exceptionally well understood, as they are recorded in some detail in Sturlunga saga (particularly Sturlu \u00fe\u00e1ttr): the saga was written in the 1260s (apparently 1264-65) by the Icelandic historian and chieftain Sturla \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson (nephew of the noted historian Snorri Sturluson). Sturla \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson was at the court of Haakon's son Magnus Lagab\u00f8te when Magnus learned of his father's death in Kirkwall in Orkney. Magnus is said to have immediately commissioned Sturla to write his father's saga. This was awkward for Sturla: 'King H\u00e1kon had instigated the death of Sturla's uncle, Snorri Sturluson, in 1241. Sturla rightly regarded H\u00e1kon as his most dangerous enemy, for he had steadfastly resisted the king's subjugation of Iceland to Norway, which was accomplished in 1262-1264. Sk\u00fali B\u00e1r\u00f0arson (d. 1240), H\u00e1kon's most dangerous rival for royal power, was the maternal grandfather of Magn\u00fas, who supervised the composition of his father's biography, much as King Sverrir is said to have \"sat over\" Karl J\u00f3nsson as the Icelandic abbot wrote Sverrir's biography'.Paul Schach, 'H\u00e1konar saga gamla H\u00e1konarsonar', in Pulsiano, Phillip (ed.), Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 259-60 (p. 259). ==Manuscripts and transmission== The saga survives in three main redactions, preserved primarily in the manuscripts Eirspennill, Codex Frisianus, and Flateyjarb\u00f3k.Paul Schach, 'H\u00e1konar saga gamla H\u00e1konarsonar', in Pulsiano, Phillip (ed.), Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 259-60 (p. 260). However, there is not yet a satisfactory stemma of the saga, as the relationships between its manuscripts are complex.H\u00e1konar saga H\u00e1konarsonar, etter Sth. 8 fol., AM 325 VIII 4to og AM 304 4to, ed. by Marina Mundt, Norsk historisk kjeldeskrift-institutt: Norr\u00f8ne tekster, 2 (Oslo: Norsk historisk kjeldeskrift-institutt i kommisjon hos Forlagsentralen, 1977), pp. xii-xiii.
