    "text": "A doomer is someone who believes in doomerism, a philosophy and mindset that believes global problems\u2014including but not limited to ecological exhaustion, such as overpopulation, peak oil, climate change, and pollution\u2014will inevitably cause the collapse of civilization, significant losses in human population, and potentially lead to eventual human extinction. The ideology is defined in opposition to more optimistic outlooks on life. Doomers believe that government corruption, civilian apathy, and/or structural oppression are unfixable. ==Common themes== Doomers tend to express feelings of despair and hopelessness about their own lives. The subreddit r/doomer was created in 2009 as a place for doomers to express their feelings and thoughts. A post written by Redditor u/newdoomr on 18 January 2020 titled \"notes from a doomer\" lists the doomer frustrations to the public at-large, questioning how they \"are not all walking around in a state of pure unquellable panic.\" Expressed within the text of the post is a determination that doomers are \"awake\" to the knowledge that the world is a cruel, sick, and meaningless place, that humans are only capable of destroying the natural world, and that even if doomers could \"ascend\" past their anxieties, it would be pointless, as the world is faced with inevitable collapse. The moderators of r/doomer pinned the post, and as of 8 August 2020, it had received 207 upvotes. == History == ===Peaknik Subculture=== The term \"doomer\" was reported in 2008 as being used in early internet peaknik communities, notably on internet forums where members discussed the theorized point in time when oil extraction would stop due to lack of resources, followed by societal collapse. Doomers of the mid-aughts subscribed to various ideas on how to face this impending collapse, including doomsday prepping, as well as more contemporary feelings of resignation and defeat. Canadian Doomer Paul Chefurka hosted a website where he encouraged his readers to eat lower on the food chain, modify their homes for the apocalypse, and to consider not to bring children into the world. Notably, unlike modern doomers, some of these peaknik doomers did not subscribe to such fatalist strategies. U.S. Army Ranger Chris Lake, when writing recommendations on how to survive the societal collapse, suggested that doomers \"adopt a positive attitude,\" because, as he put it, \"Hard times don't last, hard people do.\" ===Wojak \"Doomer\" internet meme=== By 2018, 4chan users had begun creating Wojak caricatures with the -oomer suffix to mock various groups online, the first of which was titled the \"30-year-old Boomer,\" a criticism of Millennials who had a similar outlook and ideas as Baby Boomers. This is the same trend that popularized the term \"Zoomer\" when referring to members of Generation Z. Three of these caricatures were referred to as \"Bloomers\", \"Gloomers\" and \"Doomers\". All three of these characters were created as gradients of the same 20-something Zoomer. \"Bloomers\", in this context, are Zoomers who are well-adjusted adults, \"Gloomers\" are Zoomers who are depressed because they aren't as well-adjusted. Doomers, in contrast, were Zoomers who \"simply stopped trying\". As Kaitlyn Tiffany, a social media journalist from The Atlantic observed, 2018 Doomers were \"no longer pursuing friendships or relationships, and get no joy from anything because they know that the world is coming to an end.\" ===Use in Media=== The term \"doomer\" was later brought into popular use in the commentary surrounding Jonathan Franzen's 2019 essay in The New Yorker titled \"What if We Stopped Pretending\". The piece made an argument against the possibility of averting climatic catastrophe. In addition to popularizing the term among general audiences, Franzen's piece was highly popular among online Doomer communities, including the Facebook groups Near Term Human Extinction Support Group and Abrupt Climate Change. In an article in the BBC, Jem Bendell's self-published paper Deep Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy was described as \"the closest thing to a manifesto for a generation of self-described 'climate doomers'\". As of March 2020, the paper had been a downloaded more than a half million times. In it, Bendell claims there is no chance to avert a near-term breakdown in human civilization. As the BBC review also noted, \"Prof Michael Mann, one of the world's most renowned [climate scientists], describes Bendell's paper as 'pseudo-scientific nonsense'\". The New York Times notes that supporters of Uncivilization: The Dark Mountain Manifesto have been described as \"doomers\" for the reckless nature of the text's message. The manifesto critiques the idea of progress, having been published by Paul Kingsnorth and Dougald Hine to signal the beginning of the artists' group the Dark Mountain Project. In February 2020, Kate Knibbs of Wired noted the development of a popular and growing strain of \"doomer\" climate fiction, in contrast to the typically optimistic undertones of the genre. In addition, Amy Brady, a climate fiction columnist for the Chicago Review of Books, notes that the genre has moved from future scenarios to near-past and present stories. == Criticism == Climate scientist Michael Mann sees doomerism as a \"dangerous new strain of crypto- denialism\", stating that the doomer ideas \"will lead us down the very same path of inaction as outright climate change denial. Fossil fuel interests love this framing.\" A critique of Deep Adaptation in OpenDemocracy argues that \"[Bendell's] claim that runaway climate change has made societal collapse inevitable is not only wrong, but that it undermines the cause of the climate movement.\" It instead argues that whilst \"there are real reasons for despair\", \"the choice to believe in an inevitable collapse is itself a luxury, a form of escapism only available to those with the time and resources to plan for its consequences.\" ==See also== *Ecological grief *Climate grief *Anarcho- primitivism *Deindustrialization *Apocalypse *Human overpopulation *Millenarianism *Myth of Progress *Overshoot (population) *Pessimism#Technological and environmental *Societal collapse *What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire ==References== ==External links== * Doomsters(sic) - A journal article discussing peak oil and \"Doomsters\" Category:Survivalism Category:Nihilism Category:Internet memes introduced in 2018 ",
