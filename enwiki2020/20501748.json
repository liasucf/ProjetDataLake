    "text": "Kennet Island is a large neighbourhood of over 1,350 new homes and apartments in Reading, Berkshire, England. It has been constructed on open fields, commencing in 2005 by The Berkeley Homes Group with completion in 2019. Located halfway between Reading town centre and the M4 motorway. It incorporated watercourses for aesthetics by engineering new channels for the canalised Kennet which has its catchment in rural south-west Berkshire and east Wiltshire. ==History== Kennet Island's homes developed by St James' Homes, part of Berkeley Group and the first properties were sold early 2007. Plans included a traffic circle allowing easier access from the A33 dual- carriageway onto the estate itself. The Kennet Island development continued to be financially successful for Berkeley Group during the 2008 recession. The development saw three phases, the last coinciding with an expansion of Prudential plc building offices in a nearby estate. Many homes have been available under a Government-backed initiative: My Choice Homebuy and Part Ownership Scheme aimed at giving first-time buyers a chance to get on the property ladder. There are three Housing Associations managing the social housing and part ownership housing in the Kennet Island Development; Radian, Metropolitan Thames Valley & Sovereign. ==Amenities== Kennet Island has a central Piazza, including social meeting locations, seating and water features. Located around the Central Piazza are a range of local businesses, including; Fidget & Bob a locally run cafe and bar, a local shop and convenience store, Hallmark Property Management's office for the management of the Kennet Island Development, a Little Kingdom child day care and nursery and meeting point room. Kennet Island is also home to larger businesses, including; Hilton international chain hotel and The Circle Hospital a predominantly private hospital, however they do accept NHS referrals, and finally the Cooper BMW offices and dealership. Adjoining Kennet Island, as part of the landscaping of the development, is a series of ponds & a Nature Reserve with viewing pier and the Kennet Valley path leading into the Reading town centre along the river side.www.kennetislandreading.co.uk ==Governance== The estate's local government authority is Reading Borough Council and forms part of the electoral ward of Whitley and is separated from the bulk of Whitley by a green buffer. It is not an island. In national politics this ward is part of Reading West (UK Parliament constituency). ==References== ==External links== * *Kennet Island Residents Management Company / Residents association steering group - www.kennetislandreading.co.uk Category:Housing estates in England Category:Suburbs of Reading, Berkshire ",
