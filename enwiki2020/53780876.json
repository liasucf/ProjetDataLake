Most fall on the wrong side.Robert Iscove\u2019s direction is crisp and straightforward; Linda Burton\u2019s production design and Francis Kenny\u2019s camera make good use of the flavor of the city.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * Dark An gel at TCM Category:1996 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American television films Category:Films directed by Robert Iscove ",
