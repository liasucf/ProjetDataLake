This hybrid organization was set up mainly to address the challenges of poverty in low income rural communities in Nigeria. The institution mobilizes capital from the public and private sectors to invest in projects, businesses and social enterprises with the intention to generate good financial returns and measurable positive social-environmental impact, as well as act as a champion to help increase awareness and confidence on the advantages of impact investing. Furthermore, NCDF works towards actualizing the seventeen (17) United Nations Sustainable Development Goalshttps://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ which include poverty alleviation; improved education; access to clean water, sanitation, clean energy and good infrastructure; gender and economic equality in Nigeria. To ensure the implementation of these goals, NCDF operates projects in the housing, capacity development, agriculture, finance, environmental and hospitality sectors of the Nigerian economy. NCDF is managed by a team of commercial and social enterprise professionals. == History == NCDF, Old Logo Following extensive studies on the need to support the Nigerian government in achieving sustainable developmental objectives, NCDF was endorsed in 2009 by the former President of Nigeria, Late Alhaji Umaru Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua (deceased) and was incorporated in 2010 as a Limited by Guarantee entity under the law of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Yar\u2019Adua believed that the access to affordable basic social needs by low income earners and grassroot communities is the key opportunity to unlocking poverty in the Nigerian society. In 2011, Nigerian Capital Development Fund commissioned a corporation-NCDF Investment Limited, licensed by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission as the Fund Manager for Nigerian Capital Development Fund. == Partnerships == The partners and supporters of NCDF include the Federal Government of Nigeria, World Bank, The Central Bank of Nigeria, NERFUND, African Housing Group, National Directorate of Employment, First Bank, Commonwealth Telecommunication Organization (United Kingdom), Copernicus International Consulting (United Kingdom), Governments of Lagos State, Cross River State, Benue State, Imo State, Niger State, Jigawa State and the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja, Nigeria. == Mode of Operation == NCDF is governed by the social mission to reinvest the majority of any surplus generated into socially impacting projects.
