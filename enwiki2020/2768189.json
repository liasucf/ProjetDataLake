The strip's publication began in Kodansha's Sh\u014dnen Kurabu in 1931, and was based on the Imperial Japanese Army of the time; the manga artist, Suih\u014d Tagawa, had served in the Imperial Army from 1919 to 1922.

Pre-war animated films based on the military Norakuro, and two post-war animated series of Norakuro, in 1970 and 1987, have also been produced.

During the 1980s and early 1990s Norakuro was the mascot of the Physical Training School (Tai-Iku Gakko) of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. ==References== ==External links== * Norakuro-kun at Studio Pierrot * Norakuro-kun at Studio Pierrot * * * Category:1930s animated short films Category:1931 manga Category:1933 anime films Category:1933 films Category:1934 anime films Category:1934 films Category:1935 anime films Category:1935 films Category:1938 anime films Category:1938 films Category:1970 anime television series Category:1971 Japanese television series endings Category:1987 anime television series Category:1988 Japanese television series endings Category:Anime series based on manga Category:Anime and manga featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Anime short films Category:Comics characters introduced in 1931 Category:Eiken (studio) Category:Animated television series about dogs Category:Fuji TV original programming Category:Kodansha manga Category:Manga adapted into films Category:Pierrot (company) Category:Sh\u014dnen manga ",
