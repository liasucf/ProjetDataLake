    "text": "Allen Austin Bartholomew (23 October 1925 \u2013 19 June 2004) was an Australian forensic psychologist and criminologist who played a major role in developing criminology in Australia. For example, he negotiated with the University of Melbourne to establish both the Australian and New Zealand Society of Criminology (ANZSOC) and its official journal, the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology, in 1967. He went on to serve as the journal's first editor-in-chief from 1968 to 1980. In his honor, the ANZSOC and SAGE Publications jointly honor the best article published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology in a given year with the Allen Austin Bartholomew Award. ==References== ==External links== *Biography at ANZSOC website Category:1925 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Australian criminologists Category:People educated at Caterham School Category:Forensic psychiatrists Category:Australian psychiatrists Category:Monash University faculty Category:University of Melbourne faculty Category:Academic journal editors ",
