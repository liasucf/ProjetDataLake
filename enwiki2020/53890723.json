He was later approached by Robin Carolan to release a full album through his UK/US label Tri Angle, which resulted in Runge gathering tracks mainly created during 2011 to 2012 to form his 2014 debut album That's Harakiri. This release gained him a wider audience including reviews from Pitchfork, Resident Advisor, and The Quietus. This album covered many different genres, but was described variously as experimental grime and bass music.Patrin, Nate (20114-05-01). Sd Laika That's Harakiri. Pitchfork.
