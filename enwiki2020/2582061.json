Naik, is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist and the Group Chairman of Larsen & Toubro Limited, an Indian engineering conglomerate, and since 2018, the Chairman of the National Skill Development Corporation.

Naik is also the recipient of the 'Economic Times - Business Leader of the Year Award, for the year 2008. ==Early life == Naik is a Gujarati. He was born to a family of teachers in Gujarat, also referred to as Master Kutumb in Gujarati language. His father, who used to teach at a public school in Mumbai, heeded Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s call to revitalise India's villages, and decided to return to his native village along with his family. Young Anil's early schooling therefore was in Endhal and the neighbouring village of Kharel. In June 1958, Naik enrolled at V.P. Science College in Vallabh Vidyanagar, where he would prepare for a year for admission to an engineering college. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidyalaya Engineering college in Vallabh Vidyanagar in Gujarat. Young Anil with parents and sisters After graduation, he went to Mumbai with a note from his father introducing him to Viren J. Shah working in Mukand Iron & Steel Works Limited to apply for its engineering programme. Due to his lack of proficiency in English, the personnel manager had asked him to improve his English. So Naik started working on his English skills. In the meantime, he joined Nestor Boilers, which was a Parsi-owned firm. Changes in ownership and management style at Nestor Boilers prompted Naik to turn to L&T.; == Career at L&T; == On 15 March 1965, Naik joined L&T;, as a junior engineer. A rapid rise followed. He was appointed Assistant Manager within three years and 15 days of joining \u2013 a record at L&T.; He was promoted as General Manager in 1986. He became Member of board of L&T; Limited on 23 November 1989. In 1999, he took over as the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director. In 2003, he became the Chairman of Larsen & Toubro, the first employee in the Company's history to be elevated to this post. At the helm, Naik initiated the transformation process that made L&T; into a more entrepreneurial organisation with increased emphasis on wealth creation for all stakeholders. In an interview to McKinsey, Naik explained his reasons for the portfolio rationalisation that he undertook. In 2017, he stepped aside from executive responsibilities, and took over as Group Chairman. Mr. A.M.Naik at L&T;'s Heavy Engineering workshop. === Ring fencing L&T; === In the late 1980s, L&T; encountered a take over attempt as a large business group seized substantial stake in the company. Matters came to a head in 2002, when the group's entire holding was transferred en bloc to yet another family-owned business house. The way in which Naik thwarted the take- over and fortified L&T; against such threats has been widely covered in the media. It ended in a \u2018win-win\u2019, with all parties concerned being happy with the outcome. S. Gurumurthy, currently on the Board of the Reserve Bank of India described the events as a \u2018security threat for L&T; being converted into a security ring.\u2019 The Employee Stock Options which emanated from the successful resolution of the issue gave financial security to a large section of employees, and allowed them to share in the Company's growth. === Shaping L&T; into a \u2018Nation Builder\u2019 === Naik's stewardship of L&T; is characterised by a sharper focus on sectors of national significance - defence, nuclear, aerospace, infrastructure, oil & gas and power. He has been instrumental in imparting a strong, nationalistic orientation to the Company's products, offerings and capabilities, giving rise to its description as \u2018the company that is building 21st Century India\u2019. == Chairman \u2013 NSDC == In 2018, the Government of India appointed Naik the Chairman of the National Skill Development Corporation \u2013 the apex body to promote skilling and part of the Skill India mission of the Prime Minister. Making the announcement, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said under Naik's leadership, the corporation apart from its engagement in executing skilling modules, should also be a think-tank providing direction and necessary guidance for creating a demand-based skilling ecosystem in the country. Naik said NSDC has developed a unique model combining skill development with strong industry partnerships. NSDC, under the ministry, aims to promote skill development by catalysing creation of large, quality and for-profit vocational institutions. The organisation provides funding to build scalable and profitable vocational training initiatives. == Philanthropy == In his personal capacity, Naik is a philanthropist who is committed to securing positive outcomes on his initiatives in healthcare, education and skill-building.
