    "text": "Spencer Hawk (born March 26, 1999), also known by his stage name, Gupi (stylized as gupi), is an American electronic musician. ==Biography== Spencer is the son of world-famous American skateboarder Tony Hawk. As a child, Hawk's mother encouraged him to learn the guitar, which started his interest in music. In school, he played in a rock band with several of his friends. When he discovered artists like Skrillex and Deadmau5, Hawk decided to pursue electronic music instead. He worked on electronic music throughout high school and middle school, and connected with other producers through SoundCloud. Hawk originally made music under the name W3N, but began releasing music as Gupi in 2016, when only 17. In 2018, Hawk released his second EP, All, through the record label RORA Team. Charli XCX heard his EP and asked him to do a session with her for her 2019 album, Charli. The work that they did was not released on her album, but Hawk had the opportunity to meet and work alongside A. G. Cook and Dylan Brady. In 2020, Hawk released his debut album, None, through Dog Show Records, a record label owned by Brady. Hawk is the son of skateboarder Tony Hawk and the brother of Riley Hawk. Though his father is supportive of his work, Hawk says that he \"[tries] to make a very large point of not at all involving [his] dad\" so that his accomplishments are considered to be his own. Hawk is currently pursuing a degree in electronic production at Berklee. ==Artistry== Ben Mangelsdorf of Underground Underdogs describes Gupi's music as experimental pop and compares it to the music of Sophie and Skrillex. Kyle Whiting of 34th Street Magazine calls Gupi's album None an \"exhilarating thrillride of maximalist club tracks\" that draw elements from genres like bubblegum bass, house, and dubstep. Matt Moen of Paper notes that the lead single from None, \"Thos Moser\", includes lyrics with multiple \"irreverent non-sequiturs and pop culture shout outs\". Hawk states his musical influences as PC Music, System of a Down, Britney Spears, and a picture of Sonic the Hedgehog. He makes all of his release artwork in the default Mac application Preview. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *None (Dog Show Records, 2020) ===EPs=== * Company (RORA Team, 2017) * All (RORA Team, 2018) ===Singles=== {|class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\"|Year !Title !Album |- |align=\"center\"|2020 |\"Thos Moser\" |None |} ==References== ==External links== * Gupi's website * Gupi's Soundcloud * Gupi - Company EP on the RORA Team Soundcloud Category:Living people Category:American electronic musicians Category:1999 births ",
