    "text": "MFO, 2015 Gitta Kutyniok (born 1972) is a German applied mathematician known for her research in harmonic analysis, compressed sensing, and image processing. She is Einstein Professor of Mathematics and a professor of computer science and electrical engineering at the Technical University of Berlin. ==Education and career== Kutyniok was educated in Detmold, and in 1996 earned a diploma in mathematics and computer science at Paderborn University. She completed her doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) at Paderborn in 2000. Her dissertation, Time-Frequency Analysis on Locally Compact Groups, was supervised by Eberhard Kaniuth. From 2000 to 2008 she held short term positions at Paderborn University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Giessen, Washington University in St. Louis, Princeton University, Stanford University, and Yale University. In 2006 she earned her habilitation in Giessen, in 2008 she became a full professor at Osnabr\u00fcck University, and in 2011 she was given the Einstein Chair at the Technical University of Berlin. In 2018 she added courtesy affiliations with computer science and electrical engineering at TU Berlin. Since taking her position in Berlin she has also visited ETH Z\u00fcrich, and taken an adjunct faculty position at the University of Troms\u00f8. ==Books== Kutyniok is the author of the book Affine Density in Wavelet Analysis (Springer, 2007). She has also edited or co-edited several other books. ==Recognition== Kutyniok became a member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 2016. In 2019 she was named a SIAM Fellow \"for contributions to applied harmonic analysis, compressed sensing, and imaging sciences\". She was the Emmy-Noether Lecturer of the German Mathematical Society in 2013, and has been selected as a plenary speaker at the eighth European Congress of Mathematics, in 2020. ==References== ==External links== *Home page * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Czech women computer scientists Category:21st- century German mathematicians Category:German women mathematicians Category:Paderborn University alumni Category:Osnabr\u00fcck University faculty Category:Technical University of Berlin faculty Category:Washington University in St. Louis mathematicians Category:People from Detmold ",
