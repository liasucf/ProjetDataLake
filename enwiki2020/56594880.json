    "text": "Julian Marc Dunkerton (born March 1965) is a British businessman, and the co- founder of the fashion label Superdry. ==Early life== Dunkerton's father Ivor and stepmother Susie founded and ran Dunkertons Organic Cider. Dunkerton moved to Herefordshire from London at the age of 14. He was educated at Ibstock Place School, London, Orleans Park School, Twickenham, from 11 to 14, and then the Minster School, Herefordshire. ==Career== At the age of 19, Dunkerton, along with his then business partner Ian Hibbs, founded the fashion retail chain Cult Clothing Co with a \u00a32,000 loan. In 2014, Dunkerton took control of his family's cider company, and brought in business partner Jeremy Benson (aka Bean), to work alongside his father Ivor, developing his palate and learning the craft of organic cider and perry making. In 2016, Dunkertons Organic Cider was moved from Herefordshire to a brand new cidery at the 250-acre Dowdeswell Park, near Cheltenham in Gloucestershire. In 2015, Dunkerton stepped down as chief executive of Superdry and was replaced by Euan Sutherland. Dunkerton left Superdry in April 2018 to concentrate on his other business interests. He owns The Lucky Onion group, which operates a small group of hotels, restaurants and pubs in the Cotswolds, England. In April 2019, Sutherland resigned as CEO of SuperGroup plc after Dunkerton won a bid to be reinstated to the SuperGroup plc board. ==Political activism== In the early 1990s, Dunkerton stood three times as a Labour Party candidate in the Cheltenham Borough Council elections. He stood in the St. Peter's ward in 1990, and in the Park ward in 1991 and 1992. In August 2018, Dunkerton donated \u00a31 million to People's Vote, a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union. He believes that the success of the Superdry business could not have occurred if Britain had been outside the European Union at the time. In the 2019 general election, he voted for the Liberal Democrats. ==Personal life== Dunkerton lives in Cheltenham. In February 2016, he sold just under \u00a350 million of shares to fund his divorce settlement with his wife, Charlotte Abbot. He has two children, one stepdaughter and one daughter. In August 2018, Dunkerton married fashion designer Jade Holland Cooper. He owns a private jet, which he describes as \"a tool rather than an indulgence\". == References == Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:British company founders Category:Labour Party (UK) politicians Category:People from Cheltenham Category:People educated at Ibstock Place School Category:People educated at Orleans Park School ",
