    "text": "\"Leaving New York\" is a song recorded by the American alternative rock band R.E.M.. It was released as the lead single from the band's 13th studio album, Around the Sun (2004). Although it was not as heavily promoted as earlier singles, it reached as high as number 5 on the UK Singles Chart. However, the song failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the only lead US single from an R.E.M. studio album not to chart on the US Hot 100 besides \"Cant Get There from Here\" from Fables of the Reconstruction in 1985. In early live performances of the song (September 2004), the band would play Michael Stipe's \"It's pulling me apart. Change.\" album backing vocal during the chorus and bridge of live performances. As early as February 2005, however, as evidenced on the R.E.M. Live disc, the band worked up an alternative whereby the backing vocals would be shared amongst Mike Mills, Scott McCaughey and Ken Stringfellow in order to make the song flow more smoothly. ==Background == As Stipe stated in interviews, the tune is a love song to the city. Stipe regards New York as his second hometown. Stipe stated that once, flying out of the city and seeing it from above, he was overwhelmed by its beauty and wrote the song right there on the plane.REM: Why there's life in the old dogs yet | Daily Mail, London, England | October 8, 2004 | findarticles.com The music video was shot with real friends of the band members, throwing a party, and snapshots of Stipe in different places of the city, giving the video a spontaneous and private atmosphere. ==Track listing== All tracks by Peter Buck, Mike Mills, and Michael Stipe unless otherwise stated. ===CD1=== #\"Leaving New York\" (single edit) \u2013 4:43 #\"(Don't Go Back To) Rockville\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (Live, Oslo October 25, 2003) \u2013 4:35 ===CD2=== #\"Leaving New York\" (single edit) \u2013 4:43 #\"You Are the Everything\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (Live, Raleigh, North Carolina \u2013 Soundcheck, October 10, 2003) \u2013 3:30 #\"These Days\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (Live, Toronto, Ontario, September 30, 2003) \u2013 3:27 ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2004) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |57 |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Rock Top 30 (Radio & Records) |19 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |4 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Greece (IFPI) |19 |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Poland (LP3) |1 |- !scope=\"row\"|Romania (Romanian Top 100) |60 |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2004 singles Category:R.E.M. songs Category:Warner Records singles Category:Songs written by Peter Buck Category:Songs written by Mike Mills Category:Songs written by Michael Stipe Category:Song recordings produced by Pat McCarthy (record producer) Category:Song recordings produced by Michael Stipe Category:Song recordings produced by Mike Mills Category:Song recordings produced by Peter Buck Category:Songs about New York City Category:Songs based on actual events Category:New York City in fiction Category:2004 songs Category:Rock ballads ",
