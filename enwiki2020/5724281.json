The site is a multicomponent site; however, the mounds were constructed during the Middle Woodland and are associated with the Havana Hopewell culture. The mound center has two identified mounds.Maruszak, Kathleen. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Mound House Site. National Park Service, 1977-07, 4. The site received its name because the previous landowner, a farmer, built a house on Mound 1, the largest mound. Since then the house has been removed and the land is owned by the Center for American Archeology. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 1, 1978. ==See also== *List of archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois ==References== Category:Havana Hopewell culture Category:Buildings and structures in Greene County, Illinois Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Mounds in Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in Greene County, Illinois ",
