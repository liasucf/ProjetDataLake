    "text": "Fjelberg\u00f8ya is an island in Kvinnherad Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. The island lies on the south side of the Hardangerfjorden, between the islands of Borgund\u00f8ya (to the south) and Halsn\u00f8ya (to the northeast). These three neighboring islands are located very close together, only a few hundred meters separate them at certain points. Historically, this island was the centre of the old municipality of Fjelberg. Today, the islands of Fjelberg\u00f8ya and Borgund\u00f8ya are still often referred to as Fjelberg. The island is only accessible by the sea, either using ferries or personal boats. There are regular ferry routes from Leirvik-Borgund\u00f8ya-Fjelberg\u00f8ya-Halsn\u00f8y-Utbjoa, connecting several islands to the mainland in Vindafjord at Utbjoa. Today, the island has about 16 full-time inhabitants (in 2015), but more than 100 seasonal inhabitants who stay there for longer periods during the summer. Most of the homes are in a small village area on the south side of the island near where Fjelberg Church is located. ==See also== *List of islands of Norway ==References== Category:Islands of Vestland Category:Kvinnherad ",
