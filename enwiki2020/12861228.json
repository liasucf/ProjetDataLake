In a way, it's a kind of sad break-up song like > 'My Interpretation.' But, at the same time, it's about a lot of other > things. I'll never forget when I was actually recording this song in Los > Angeles, I would take this drive from where I was staying to the studio, > which wasn't in the city and the amount of homeless people I saw on the way > was absolutely shocking. Those horrible images of homelessness that I would > see every morning really connected with that song. So it just comes to show > you that a bright song in a certain mindset had a meaning that really > evolves and changes as time goes by. I think that it is very important that > other listeners find their own meaning to songs. So many people are very > openly suggestive to the point of being abstract. It's the most powerful > thing when that becomes the song.\" The woman singing with Mika in \u201cHappy Ending\u201d on the album is Ida Falk Winland, an opera singer and former classmate of Mika from the Royal College of Music.http://www.last.fm/music/Mika/_/Happy+Ending == Critical reception == The song received critical acclaim.
