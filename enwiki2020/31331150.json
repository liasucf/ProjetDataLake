    "text": "Peter Onumanyi is a Nigerian mathematician. He was born in 1951 in Okene, Nigeria. A graduate of the University of Ibadan and Imperial College, London, he is a fellow and past president of the Mathematical Association of Nigeria. Onumanyi has served as the Head of the Mathematics department, Dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences, and Deputy Vice-chancellor (Academic) of the University of Jos. ==Early life and education== He was born in 1951 in Okene town of Kogi State of Nigeria. He attended the RCM primary school, Okene-South and had his secondary education at Government Secondary School, Dekina from where he obtained a division-one in the 1968 West African School Certificate Examination. He proceeded to Titcombe College, Egbe, Kogi State for the Higher School Certificate course in 1969. Onumanyi later attended the University of Ibadan, where he graduated in Mathematics in 1975 with the B.Sc. Hons. Degree. Thereafter, he obtained the M.Sc. and Ph.D (Numerical Analysis) degrees from the Imperial College of Science and Technology, University of London in 1979 and 1981, respectively. He obtained his M.Sc. degree with \u201ca mark of distinction\u201d at the Imperial College, London. ==Academic career and PhD supervision== Onumanyi has taught and carried out research in Mathematics at the department of Mathematics, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Kwara State of Nigeria (1982\u20131992), University of Jos, Jos, Plateau State of Nigeria (1992\u20132004). He has supervised eight students that have obtained Ph.D degree in Numerical Analysis and over twenty-five for the M.Sc. degree in Numerical Analysis. The University of Jos appointed a Senior Lecturer in 1992 and a Professor of Mathematics in 1993 and he is still very active in research and paper writing. He has forty scientific publications in Journals across Africa, Europe, Japan and USA. ==Scholarly journal and professional assessment work== Onumanyi has assessed many of his academic colleagues\u2019 papers for professorship appointments. He has served and still serving as external examiner to many Nigerian Universities and Polytechnics. He has served in many editorial boards of academic journals and mathematical abstracts reviews both in Nigeria and overseas. They include: * Mathematical Abstracts reviewers for Zentrablatt for Mathematic, West Germany (1983\u20131993), * Editor-in-chief of Abacus, Journal of Mathematical Association of Nigeria (MAN) (1989\u20131994), * Member, Editorial board of Abacus (1994\u20132004). ==Convocational service== Onumanyi has served on many important committees as chairman or member within and outside the University Communities of University of Jos and University of Ilorin. He has served as the National President of the Mathematical Association of Nigeria (MAN) (1998\u20132000). He is a life member of the Association and awarded the highest honour of the Association Fellow of MAN (FMAN) in 2001. He has held the following positions in the University of Jos: * Head of Department of Mathematics (1993\u20131995) * Dean, Faculty of Natural Sciences (1995\u20131998), * Chairman, Committee of Deans (1997\u20131998), elected representative of the congregation to the University Governing Council (1997\u20132000) * Deputy Vice-chancellor (Academic) (1998\u20132000). ==Personal life== Professor Onumanyi is married and has six children. ==Selected Publications== * P.
