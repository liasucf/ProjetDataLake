    "text": "15 Leonis Minoris is the Flamsteed designation for a single star in the northern constellation of Ursa Major. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 5.12, making it a fifth magnitude star that is visible to the naked eye. The star has been examined for an infrared excess, but none was detected. This star has a stellar classification of G0 IV-V with an age of about 9.3 billion years, which suggests that it is an older G-type main sequence star that may be evolving into a subgiant as the hydrogen at its core runs out. The disk of the star has an angular diameter of mas. At an estimated distance of based on parallax measurements, this yields a physical size of about 1.6 times the radius of the Sun. The estimated mass of the star is 15% greater than the Sun's mass. The effective temperature of the stellar atmosphere is around 5,859 K, giving it the yellow-hued glow of a G-type star. == References == {0.0046491\\ \\text{AU}/R_{\\bigodot}} \\\\\\ & \\approx 3.2\\cdot R_{\\bigodot} \\end{align} }} Category:Ursa Major (constellation) Leo Minoris, 15 Category:G-type main-sequence stars 048113 3881 0368 084737 Category:G-type subgiants BD+46 1551 ",
