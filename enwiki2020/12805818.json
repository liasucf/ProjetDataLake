The hamlet of Bluestone is named after a granite boulder glacial deposit situated near the Burford crossroads in Acton civil parish, which was unearthed during road building and is believed to originate from Cumbria. The name is thought to derive from blue porphyritic crystals, which are no longer visible. A local legend suggests that the boulder was thrown at Acton church from Bickerton Hill by the Devil.Latham, p. 11, endpaper map The Battle of Nantwich of 1644 took place partly in Henhull, on the site of the present Nantwich Marina.
