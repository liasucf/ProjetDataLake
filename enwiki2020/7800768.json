It is a short and narrow open laneway, running between Bourke Street Mall and Little Collins Street between Elizabeth Street and Swanston Street in the central business district of Melbourne. Located in the heart of the shopping precinct, the Causeway is currently flanked by some small boutique shops, indoor and outdoor cafes and sushi bars. The lane is notable for the heritage listed former Union Bank a tall curved palazzo styled building constructed in the 1920s which has a mezzanine entrance at the corner of the lane. The building is now occupied by Laurent, an upmarket French patisserie. The lane is bitumen and lined by the plain sides of some heritage buildings. It is closed to all vehicular traffic. A vista is created at either end by the Myer Emporium on Bourke Street Mall and at the other by the postmodern facade of the Novotel on Collins. ==See also== Category:Melbourne City Centre Category:Streets in Melbourne ",
