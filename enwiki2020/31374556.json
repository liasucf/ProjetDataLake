The Heroes' Monument of the Red Army in Vienna was built to commemorate 17,000 Soviet soldiers who were killed in action during the Vienna Offensive in World War II. ==Background== Near the end of World War II, Soviet forces of the 3rd Ukrainian Front were ordered by Joseph Stalin to capture Vienna, both for strategic military purposes and for use as a post-war bargaining chip with the Allies.Glantz, David, The Soviet-German War 1941-1945 Clemson University, October 11, 2001. Retrieved April 2, 2011. After intense urban fighting, Vienna was captured by the Soviet Forces on 14 April 1945. == Construction and Austrian perception == The creation of an Allied Commission for Austria was envisaged by Allied leaders at the various sessions of the European Advisory Commission and established by the Agreement on control machinery in Austria in London on July 4, 1945. The agreement mandated the creation of four occupation zones (American, British, French and Soviet) in Vienna, similar to Berlin.Grew, Joseph C., Foreign Relations of the United States, 1945, vol. III, May 7, 1945. Perhaps not coincidentally, although several sites were considered for the Soviet memorial, ultimately a prominent location in the 3rd district near the Palais Schwarzenberg was chosen, imposingly within sight of the location used by the four allies to govern Vienna. German prisoners of war and Austrian construction workers were used to build the site.Czeike, Felix, Historisches Lexikon Wien, Band 5, Kremayr & Scheriau, Wien 1997, , page 311. The memorial includes a triumphal arch and is dominated by the figure of a soldier with a PPSh-41 submachine gun on his chest. The soldier wears a golden helmet and holds a Soviet flag and a golden Soviet coat of arms.Chernov, Sergey, \"Austrian Capital Preserves Imperial Ambience\", The St. Petersburg Times, January 26, 2010, Retrieved April 3, 2011. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the memorial in 2007 to lay flowers and specifically give thanks to Austria for maintaining it. Putin verabschiedet sich, DiePresse.com, May 24, 2007, Retrieved April 3, 2011. The city paid to refurbish the memorial, 3D-Vermessung des Heldendenkmals der Roten Armee, www.netzundplan.at, (refurbishment contractor), Retrieved April 3, 2011. despite objections from certain members of the local press.
