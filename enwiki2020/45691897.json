    "text": "Rakuten Rewards (), formerly known as Ebates, is a cash-back and shopping rewards company headquartered in San Mateo, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. Rakuten Rewards' revenue comes from affiliate network links. Members of the site click through affiliate links before shopping at a retailer's site. Once the member makes a purchase, Rakuten Rewards receives an affiliate commission from the retailer which is then shared with the member. The company publishes links both on their website and through a browser extension as well as mobile app. Rakuten Rewards frequently appears on lists of best cash-back sites. ==History== Rakuten Rewards was founded as Ebates in 1998 in Menlo Park, CA by two former deputy district attorneys, Alessandro Isolani and Paul Wasserman. Funded by venture capital firm Foundation Capital, Ebates.com launched on May 3, 1999 offering up to 25% cash back from about 40 online retailers. In September 2014, Ebates was acquired by Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten for US$1 billion. In 2019, the Ebates brand was phased out and replaced with Rakuten Rewards. == Acquisitions == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Number !Date !Company !Business !Country !References |- |1 |9/8/2011 |FatWallet |Comparison shopping site |United States | |- |2 |8/9/2012 |BFAds |Coupons site |United States | |- |3 |9/8/2012 |AnyCoupons |Coupons site |United States | |- |4 |6/22/2012 |OneReceipt |Receipt digitization service |United States | |- |5 |10/12/2012 |PushPins |Coupons mobile site |United States | |- |6 |6/25/2013, sold 12/6/2017 |Extrabux |Comparison shopping site |United States | |- |7 |3/7/2016 |Shopular |Product discovery mobile app |United States | |- |8 |1/23/2017 |Cartera Commerce |Rewards program provider |United States | |- |9 |4/3/2017 |ShopStyle (and Cosmic Cart) |Fashion discovery site |United States | |} == Services/Tools == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Name !Description !Website !References |- |Mobile App |Free application for Android and iOS allows users to shop and earn cash back on mobile devices |https://www.rakuten.com/mobile.htm | |- |Hotels |Users can book hotels to earn cash back.
