It was built using the remains of a Roman fortification situated not on the site of today's building but in the adjoining orchard. ==History== The first written mention about Br\u00e2ncovene\u0219ti was almost eight centuries ago. In this village on the right bank of the Mure\u015f River, on the top of the hill they built a small fort already in Roman times which was destroyed during the migrations. Its name according to inscribed stones which were found in the ground was: Ala Nova Illiricorum. Its few remnants can be seen in the current castle`s former orchard. The castle was built from Roman stones at the beginning of the 13th century, when the territory belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary. The earliest remaining document from 1228 gives its name as castrum Wecheu, when King Andrew II of Hungary took it from Simon Kacsics and gave it to Denis Tomaj. The ancestors of the B\u00e1nffy de Losoncz noble family inherited from them and held it for one and a half centuries. In 1467 the family took part in the rebellion against King Matthias, and thereby they lost their possession. The king gave it to one of his relatives from Hunyad County, John Ongor. It subsequently became the property of the wealthy and influential Michael Szobi. After his death, John Szapolyai gave all the Szobi properties to Stephen Werb\u0151czy. In the following years the castle changed its owners many times. The sequence began with Ferenc Kendi, one of the leading figures of the time, then Sigismund B\u00e1thory left it to his uncle, Bocskai Istv\u00e1n. Around 1612 the castle became the property of Istv\u00e1n Wessel\u00e9nyi. The castle was also owned by Gabriel Bethlen, who passed it on to Peter Bethlen, but after his death it went to George I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi. In that period, the castle owned seven villages: Br\u020bncovene\u015fti, S\u0103calu de P\u0103dure, Luieriu, V\u0103tava, Ideciu de Jos si Ideciu de Sus, Cuie\u0219d, and one part of Suseni. George I R\u00e1k\u00f3czi meant to give the castle to John Kem\u00e9ny, but only his son George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi managed to do it. On 28 November 1648 the castle together with five villages was donated to John Kem\u00e9ny and his descendants. From this moment Br\u020bncovene\u015fti became John Kem\u00e9ny's property for three hundred years. From the summer of 1926 on, writers of the \"Erd\u00e9lyi Helikon\" had their annual meeting in the Castle. At the end of World War II the local population completely ransacked the building, all the valuables were taken. Following its earlier nationalization, it became a reformatory, and it was then converted into a home for women and children with disabilities. As a result, the building was not open for a long time. On 8 November 2014, the Kem\u00e9ny Castle from Br\u00e2ncovene\u0219ti was opened for visitors. Once again, the property has been returned to the Kem\u00e9ny family after a period of 70 years. ==Description== The castle has a square-shaped plan, courtyard and corner towers, two larger and two smaller. Several windows have frames in Renaissance style. Built above the entrance is a picturesque stone balcony on consoles. The consoles can be seen at the floors of the towers. The entrance is on the north side, on a bridge over the outside ditch of the castle. Old documents show that the former citadel (13th century) was protected by moats, walls and towers positioned below the plateau on which the castle was built. These were destroyed during post-war reconstruction work. ==References== ==External links== * http://www.kemenyinfo.hu Category:Houses completed in the 16th century Category:Historic monuments in Mure\u0219 County Category:Castles in Romania ",
