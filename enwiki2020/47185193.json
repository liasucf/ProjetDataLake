Mothership: Program Note. Retrieved July 8, 2015. The premiere was broadcast live on YouTube and garnered nearly two million viewers. ==Composition== Bates discussed the composition in the score program notes, writing, \"This energetic opener imagines the orchestra as a mothership that is \u2018docked\u2019 by several visiting soloists, who offer brief but virtuosic riffs on the work's thematic material over action-packed electro-acoustic orchestral figuration.\" He continued: ===Instrumentation=== The original orchestral arrangement of Mothership is scored for three flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), E-flat clarinet, two clarinets (both doubling bass clarinet), three oboes (3rd doubling English horn), two bassoons, contrabassoon, four French horns, three trumpets, two trombones, bass trombone, tuba, three percussionists, laptop, timpani, harp, piano, and strings. A subsequent wind ensemble arrangement of the piece by Bates is scored for four flutes (1st and 2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes (2nd doubling English horn), two bassoons, contrabassoon, E-flat clarinet, four clarinets, two bass clarinets, soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, four C trumpets, four French horns, two trombones, bass trombone, euphonium, tuba, harp, piano, four percussionists, laptop, timpani, and double bass. ==Reception== Andrew Druckenbrod of the Pittsburgh Post- Gazette conceded that the piece is likely not Bates's best work, but that \"it showcases the orchestra's ability to be inclusive.\" Druckenbrod added, \"Mothership is fun, and there is nothing wrong with that!\" ==References== Category:Compositions by Mason Bates Category:2011 compositions Category:Compositions for symphony orchestra Category:Concert band pieces Category:21st-century classical music Category:YouTube ",
