    "text": "Cowan is a small town and suburb near Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia, approximately north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Hornsby Shire. Cowan shares the postcode of 2081 with Berowra. Brooklyn, which lies to the north-east of Cowan, is considered the northernmost suburb of the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area. ==History== The town takes its name from an Aboriginal word meaning big water. The 1828 census lists two convicts called Cowan, and it is also thought possible that Cowan was named after one of them. Still another suggestion is that it was named after a small town in Scotland. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike Generic 2.0 license. Besides the English botanist George Caley, who explored the area in 1805, the first Europeans to visit the area were timber-getters. The timber from Cowan was used for coach building, one of the first industries in the area. The railway stop at Cowan was originally a crossing loop to allow trains on the single-line north track to pass each other, and it was also the point at which auxiliary steam engines, connected to the trains at Hawkesbury River station (Brooklyn), were disconnected after the steep haul to the top of the plateau. A station and platform were constructed in 1901. With the coming of the railway, Cowan become a popular holiday spot and a regular starting point for bushwalkers. Cowan Public School opened in 1939. In 1958, the rail line was electrified, and this also increased the number of people visiting the area, with families moving into the suburb, particularly those wanting to raise children in a bushland setting but near the city. There has been little change in Cowan village since it was first laid out as a crown subdivision in 1910. Lots ranged from 1,500 to 4,500 square metres. The predominance of freestanding three-bedroom houses set in gardens provides a sense of openness, and creates a pleasant transition to the bushland which surrounds the town. ==Population== In the 2016 Census, there were 649 people in Cowan. 86.2% of people were born in Australia and 91.0% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 37.5% and Anglican 20.1%. ==Transport== Access by road to Cowan is via the Pacific Highway which traverses Cowan north to south.

A notable landmark of the Cowan area is the \"Pie In The Sky\" pie shop located approximately one kilometre north of Cowan on the Pacific Highway.Not Quite Nigella Pie In The Sky was featured in the Australian film Lantana, and is a frequent stop for day-trippers, bicycle riders and motorcycle/motor-scooter enthusiasts on weekends. ==Facilities== Cowan Community Hall is a service provided by Hornsby Shire Council.
