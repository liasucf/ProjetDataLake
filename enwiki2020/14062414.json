Instead, the group was assigned directly to Eighteenth Air Force, but attached to the 64th Troop Carrier Wing, which was stationed at Donaldson.Ravenstein, pp. 102\u2013103 In August, the group was finally assigned the 465th Wing, but it remained attached to the 64th Wing.Ravenstein, pp. 260\u2013261 Squadrons assigned to the group were the 780th, 781st and 782d Troop Carrier Squadrons. The 443d Group was in the process of converting to the Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar from the Curtiss C-46 Commando it was flying when mobilized when it was replaced by the 465th.McAuliffe, pp. 395\u2013396 In October, the group's attachment changed to the 63d Troop Carrier Wing, which was also located at Donaldson and it became operational with the Flying Boxcar.Ravenstein, pp. 100\u2013102 In November, the group moved overseas to Toul- Rosi\u00e8res Air Base, France, with the ground echelon sailing on the , while the air echelon departed Donaldson with their C-119s at the beginning of December. At Toul, it became part of Twelfth Air Force. Although a reconnaissance wing had been located at Toul earlier in the year, construction of the base was still underway, so the 781st Squadron was located at Wiesbaden Air Base, Germany and the 782d Squadron was at Neubiberg Air Base, Germany.Maurer, Combat Squadrons. p. 753Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 754 The group was still assigned to the 465th Wing, which remained in the United States until late December, when it became clear that the wing's deployment to Europe would be delayed, and the group was assigned to Twelfth Air Force. The squadron participated in airlift operations, tests and exercises in Europe. Although the group mission was troop carrier, there were few American airborne troops in Europe, and the group's missions focused on theater airlift flights, particularly supporting fighter units deploying to Wheelus Air Base for training at the ranges there. Construction progressed and on 1 April 1954, the 465th Wing finally moved to Toul and by the start of the following month the 781st and 782d Squadrons also joined the group. In late May 1955, the group moved to \u00c9vreux-Fauville Air Base, France, becoming the first USAF tactical unit on the base. Evreaux had been the wing's intended base in France, but construction had been delayed and it was not able to house the group until 1954.McAuliffe, p. 311 The group became non-operational in March 1956 when the 465th Wing began to transition to the dual deputy organization structure. Its operational squadrons were attached to the wing until the group was inactivated in March 1957.See Ravenstein, pp. 260\u2013261 (end of assignment) ==Lineage== * Constituted as the 465th Bombardment Group (Heavy) on 19 May 1943 : Activated on 1 August 1943 : Redesignated 465th Bombardment Group, Heavy c. 25 January 1944 : Inactivated on 31 July 1945 * Redesignated 465th Troop Carrier Group, Medium and activated on 1 February 1953Lineage through 1956 in Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 340\u2013341 : Inactivated on 12 March 1957 * Redesignated 465th Bombardment Group, Heavy on 31 July 1985 (remained inactive) ===Assignments=== * II Bomber Command, 1 August 1943 \u2013 1 February 1944 * 55th Bombardment Wing, April 1944 * Caribbean Wing, Air Transport Command, 15 June \u2013 31 July 1945 * Eighteenth Air Force, 1 February 1953 (attached to 64th Troop Carrier Wing) * 465th Troop Carrier Wing, 25 August 1953 (attached to 64th Troop Carrier Wing until October 1953, attached to 63d Troop Carrier Wing until 30 November 1953) * Twelfth Air Force, 26 December 1953 * 465th Troop Carrier Wing 1 April 1954 \u2013 12 March 1957 (not operational after 1 March 1956) ===Components=== * 780th Bombardment Squadron (later Troop Carrier Squadron): 1 August 1943 \u2013 31 July 1945, 1 February 1953 \u2013 12 March 1957Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 752\u2013753 * 781st Bombardment Squadron (later Troop Carrier Squadron): 1 August 1943 \u2013 31 July 1945, 1 February 1953 \u2013 12 March 1957 * 782d Bombardment Squadron (later Troop Carrier Squadron): 1 August 1943 \u2013 31 July 1945, 1 February 1953 \u2013 12 March 1957 * 783d Bombardment Squadron: 1 August 1943 \u2013 31 July 1945 ===Stations=== * Alamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico, 1 August 1943 * Kearns Army Air Base, Utah, September 1943 * McCook Army Airfield, Nebraska, c. 5 October 1943 \u2013 1 February 1944 * Pantanella Airfield, Italy April 1944 \u2013 June 1945 * Waller Field, Trinidad, 15 June \u2013 31 July 1945 * Donaldson Air Force Base, South Carolina, 25 August 1953 \u2013 30 November 1953 * Toul-Rosi\u00e8res Air Base, France, December 1953 * \u00c9vreux- Fauville Air Base, France, 23 May 1955 \u2013 8 July 1957 ===Aircraft flown=== * Consolidated B-24 Liberator, 1943\u20131945 * Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar, 1953, 1954\u20131957 * Boeing B-52G Stratofortress, 1963\u20131968 * Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, 1963\u20131968. ==See also== * 518th Air Service Group Support unit for the group in World War II ==References== ; Notes ; Citations ===Bibliography=== * * * * ==External links== * 465th Bombardment Wing @ strategic-air-command.com Category:Military units and formations established in 1943 Category:Bombardment groups of the United States Army Air Forces Category:Military units and formations in British Guiana in World War II Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1945 Category:Military units and formations established in 1953 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1957 ",
