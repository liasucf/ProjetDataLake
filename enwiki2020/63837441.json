On this occasion, he was attached by Sir Francis Clerke to the 9th Regiment, which was then advancing. He was also present at the disastrous affair of 7 October, after which the army retired to Saratoga. Near Fort Hardy, he was wounded. At this time also, General John Burgoyne, the commander-in-chief, was captured by the enemy while trying to secure provisions for the British army. Gonville Bromhead volunteered to go get the provisions after Burgoyne's failure. He succeeded by cutting the cables of the bateaux, which drifted down with a large quantity of provisions to the British army. Because of this, Bromhead was honoured with his Excellency's thanks.
