    "text": "In Norse mythology, Meili (Old Norse \"the lovely one\"Simek (2007:210).) is a god, son of the god Odin and brother of the god Thor. Meili is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Other than Meili's relation to Odin and Thor, no additional information is provided about the deity in either source. ==Attestations== In the Poetic Edda poem H\u00e1rbar\u00f0slj\u00f3\u00f0, Meili receives a single mention; the god Thor declares that, even if he were an outlaw, he would reveal his name and his homeland, for he is the son of Odin, the brother of Meili, and the father of Magni.Larrington (1999:70). Meili receives four mentions in the Prose Edda book Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l. In chapter 17, verses from the poem Haustl\u00f6ng (attributed to the 10th century skald \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr of Hvinir) are provided, where Thor is referred to as \"Meili's brother.\"Faulkes (1995:80). In chapter 22, additional quotes from Haustl\u00f6ng are provided where a kenning is employed for the god H\u0153nir that refers to Meili (\"step-Meili\").Faulkes (1995:87). In chapter 23, a quote by a work from the skald \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr of Hvinir is provided that refers to Thor as \"Meili's brother\".Faulkes (1999:89). In chapter 75, Meili is listed among names of the \u00c6sir and as a son of Odin (between the god Baldr and the god V\u00ed\u00f0arr).Faulkes (1995:156). ==Theories== Some 19th-century scholars theorized that Meili's mother is J\u00f6r\u00f0, a goddess and the personified Earth.Examples include Pierer (1844:204), Barth (1846:396), and Uhland (1868:18). Also during the 19th century, Viktor Rydberg theorized that Baldr and Meili are one and the same.Rydberg (2003:191). ==Notes== ==References== * Barth, Christian K. (1846).
