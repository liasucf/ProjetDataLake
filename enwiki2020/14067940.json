    "text": "The Silver City Comet was a train service that operated from September 1937 until November 1989 between Parkes and Broken Hill in western New South Wales.Railway Service Provision New South Wales Government Archives It was the first air-conditioned train in Australia. ==Design== The original engines were built in Belfast by Harland & Wolff under licence from Burmeister & Wain known as the \"Harlandic\" type. An eight cylinder in line uniflow two-stroke engines with blower scavenging which developed at 1200 rpm. The transmission was a Voith-Sinclair torque converter design with two final drive gear ratios, geared for 0r . Two \"National\" diesel generator sets producing DC power for train lighting and air conditioning. In 1953 spare parts supply difficulties and engine age prompted the NSWGR to re-engine the fleet with four 6\u2013110 GM diesel engines rated at at 1800 rpm coupled in pairs driving Allison torque converters to the inner axle of each bogie. These are coupled in pairs through a GM Model TCLA 965 torque converter to gear boxes connected to each of the bogies. A Standard Waygood GM 120 volt, , generator set for power requirements including train lighting, cooking and air conditioning. The power van was re- classed 'DP', tare weight was . ==Service== Broken Hill had two tramways which were established by the early 1900s. One was closed in 1926 due to being unprofitable while the other was converted to standard gauge rail in 1919 and eventually connected to Sydney via the Broken Hill line in 1927. When the rolling stock was ordered, it was planned that they would be utilised on both the Parkes to Broken Hill and Dubbo to Bourke services. In September 1937 the Silver City Comet commenced operating three times a week between Parkes and Broken Hill connecting with the Western Mail from Sydney. This was increased to daily from May 1938 before reverting to thrice weekly in October 1939. This released some stock for transfer to Sydney to operate Federal City Express services to Canberra from October 1939 until November 1945. In April 1940 the remaining stock was also transferred to Sydney to operate Newcastle Flyer services for a few months. From January 1957, Silver City Comet stock operated a three times per week service from Parkes to Orange and Dubbo. Following the introduction of the Central West XPT service to Dubbo, in April 1982 this was cut back to Orange, but was extended to start at Forbes.. By 1983, the Parkes - Forbes section was by bus. By 1986, the mail was withdrawn. Silver City Comet was retimed to connect with Central West XPT, three days per week each way. The Orange - Forbes connection on the other four days was now by airconditioned bus. ==Rolling stock== The New South Wales Government Railways placed orders for five diesel power vans with Eveleigh Carriage Workshops and 12 trailer cars with Ritchie Brothers, Auburn in the mid-1930s. The double ended power cars were each fitted with two Harland & Wolff Hardlandic diesel engines. PH 105 was destroyed by fire at Ivanhoe in January 1950 with the remaining four repowered with General Motors 6\u2013110 engines between 1952 and 1957. DP 102 was withdrawn after being struck at a level crossing at Forbes in August 1982. The carriages were the first in Australia to feature air- conditioning.Comets of the Silver City Railpix Originally painted silver with blue lining, in the 1950s they were repainted in the standard tuscan and russet livery. By the 1970s they had returned to their original livery. In the 1980s they were repainted into the State Rail Authority's candy colours before once again being returned to their original livery in time for their 50th anniversary in 1987.\"Happy Birthday Silver City Comet\" Railway Digest September 1987 page 278 In its twilight years the Silver City Comet became a popular train for enthusiast tours including operating to Melbourne (Vic.) in February 1983, up the North Coast line to Brisbane in April 1986 and the Main Northern line to Tenterfield in October 1989.\"Another Comet Passes By\" Railway Digest July 1986 page 199\"By Comet to (Almost) Wallangarra\" Railway Digest December 1989 page 415 In September 1987, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their entry into service, a set operated tours from Sydney to Canberra and Kiama.\"Silver City Comet \u2013 50th Anniversary\" Railway Digest November 1987 page 347 ==Trailer Cars== Along with the power cars, 12 air-conditioned passenger trailers were ordered from Ritchie Brothers of Auburn NSW. The trailers were built in three configurations \u2013 four First Class sitting cars (coded BT 201\u2013204), four Second Class sitting cars with buffet (coded RFT 205\u2013208) and four Second Class sitting cars (coded FT 209\u2013212). Two additional parcel trailers (coded HT 301\u2013302) were also constructed by NSWGR Carriage Works at Eveleigh, NSW. The passenger trailers were each 55 feet long while the parcel trailers were 42 feet long. All cars featured a full-length side skirt below the floor level, partially covering the bogies and underfloor equipment. They were all painted in the same silver and blue livery as the power cars. The trailers were constructed principally of aluminium alloy on a steel underframe. The cars were arranged internally with two saloons separated by male and female toilets. Entrance doors and vestibules were provided at each end. The trailers were refurbished in the early 1950s to bring them up to the same standard as the new air-conditioned HUB and RUB daylight express carriages. The original First Class seating was retained and reclassified as Second Class, while new First Class seating was installed. Two buffet cars (DR 205 and 207) were also converted into full dining cars. FT 212 was converted to a relief parcel trailer in 1953 and was condemned following a shunting accident in 1968. Following the demise of DEH 212 an Emergency Parcel Trailer {ETP 1475) was converted to operate with the Comet and renumbered EDH 320. This vehicle was condemned in 1981. To fulfil the luggage and parcel loading requirements on Comet services following the withdrawal of DH 301 and 302 and EDH 320, two surplus 500 Class trailer cars (HCT 504 and 508) were converted into Comet parcels trailers in 1985. ==Demise and Preservation== On 3 November 1989 the final Silver City Comet ran with road transport taking over the service.\"The Official Last Comet\" Railway Digest February 1990 page 55 Following their withdrawal in November 1989 the rolling stock was disposed of by auction at Parkes on 22 December 1989. The State Rail Authority donated a power van and four carriages to the City of Broken Hill that was placed on display at the Sulphide Street Railway Museum, and a carriage to the City of Parkes. The Dorrigo Steam Railway & Museum and New South Wales Rail Transport Museum each purchased a power van and four carriages respectively.\"Comet sets sold at auction\" Railway Digest February 1990 page 47 These latter two sets both moved to the Rail Motor Society, Paterson in April 1990.\"Is this the way to Parkes?\" Railway Digest July 1990 page 254 Dorrigo's stock was moved to Kooragang Island in May 1994\"Paterson\" Railway Digest July 1994 page 35 and subsequently to Dorrigo, while the Rail Transport Museum's stock moved to Thirlmere in April 1999.Preservation & Tourist\" Railway Digest June 1999 page 43 ==Power Car Roster== {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width: 100%; font- size:95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"silver\" | Power Vans |- !No!!Entered service!!Rebuild!!Organisation!!Location!!Status |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | PH 101||September 1937||DP 101||Sulphide Street Railway & Historical Museum||Broken Hill||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | PH 102||August 1937||DP 102||||||condemned after accident August 1982, scrapped|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | PH 103||January 1938||DP 103|| Dorrigo Steam Railway & Museum|| Dorrigo|||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | PH 104||May 1938||DP 104|| New South Wales Rail Transport Museum ||Thirlmere||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | PH 105||September 1938||||||||destroyed by fire January 1950, scrapped|| |} ==Trailer Car Roster== {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width: 100%; font- size:95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"silver\" | Trailer Cars |- !No!!Entered service!!Rebuild!!Organisation!!Location!!Status |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | BT 201||September 1937||DB 201||Dorrigo Steam Railway & Museum||Dorrigo|||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | BT 202||September 1937||DC 202||Sulphide Street Railway & Historical Museum||Broken Hill||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | BT 203||January 1938||DC 203||Parkes City Council||Parkes|||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | BT 204||September 1937||DF/DZF 204||Dorrigo Steam Railway & Museum||Dorrigo|||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | RFT 205||September 1937||DR 205||New South Wales Rail Transport Museum||Thirlmere||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | RFT 206||September 1937||DB 206||Dorrigo Steam Railway & Museum||Dorrigo|||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | RFT 207||January 1938||DR 207||Sulphide Street Railway & Historical Museum||Broken Hill||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | RFT 208||September 1937||HFT 208||New South Wales Rail Transport Museum||Thirlmere||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | FT 209||August 1941||HFT 209||Sulphide Street Railway & Historical Museum||Broken Hill||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | FT 210||October 1938||DB 210||New South Wales Rail Transport Museum||Thirlmere||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | FT 211||May 1941||DF/DZF 211||New South Wales Rail Transport Museum||Thirlmere||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | FT 212||July 1941||DEH 212|||||||condemned after accident December 1968, scrapped|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | HT 301||September 1937||DH 301|||||||condemned April 1983, scrapped|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | HT 302||March 1938||DH 302|||||||condemned April 1983, scrapped|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | EDH 320||November 1970|||||||||condemned December 1981, scrapped|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | PT 504||September 1985||||Sulphide Street Railway & Historical Museum||Broken Hill||static exhibit|| |--style=\"background:#E5E5FF\" | PT 508||September 1985|||||Dorrigo Steam Railway & Museum||Dorrigo|||static exhibit|| |} ==Gallery== Image:broken_hill_silver_city_comet.jpg|Power van DP 101 Image:Silvercom.jpg|Power van DP 104 Image:DR 205 Buffet Area.JPG|Buffet kitchen area trailer car DR 205 Image:DR 205 Dining Area.JPG|Dining Area trailer car DR 205 ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Broken Hill, New South Wales Category:Named passenger trains of New South Wales Category:Passenger rail transport in New South Wales Category:Railway services introduced in 1937 Category:Railway services discontinued in 1989 Category:1937 establishments in Australia Category:1989 disestablishments in Australia Category:Discontinued railway services in Australia http://www.railmotorsociety.org.au/rm_home_master_frame.htm, then via the index to the two Silver City Comet sets.
