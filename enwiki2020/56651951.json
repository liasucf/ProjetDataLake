The book features contributions from many friends and family members of Barker, including members of Blink-182, Transplants and The Aquabats. ==Summary and themes== Barker dedicated the book to his family and opened with a first-hand account of surviving his 2008 plane crash before discussing his early life. The book chronicles Barker's childhood, vegan diet and early love of drumming as well as the formation of his companies Famous Stars and Straps and LaSalle Records. He also discusses the break-ups of Blink-182 and the Meet The Barkers reality show. Barker also relates his marriages to Melissa Kennedy and Shanna Moakler and his relationship with Paris Hilton, and claims to be a sex addict. He also discusses his battle with drug addiction, his fear of flying and his friendship with and the death of Adam Goldstein, which he describes as having a profound effect on him. ==Release and reception== William Morrow released an initial hardcover printing of 100,000 copies October 20, 2015. with paperback version released on September 6, 2016. An audiobook narrated by Cary Hite and produced by Buck 50 Productions came out on September 15, 2016. Billboard called the book, \"(A) riveting, brutally honest memoir\" while Rolling Stone called it, \"a fascinating look into the life of a talented, hard-partying musician who has beaten the odds several times.\" Not all reviews were positive, however, with New Noise Magazine reviewer John B. Moore complaining writing, \"Is the book honest? I guess; is it salacious? You bet; is it worth more the read? Not if you\u2019ve evolved past dick jokes.\" Barker said it was hard doing the press for the book due to frequently being asked to comment on the plane crash and his addiction problems on talk shows and said was disappointed by the headlines of articles about the book focussing on his relationships and the more outrageous parts of the memoir. However, Barker told The Toronto Sun that he was happy with how honest the book was saying, \"Some of the stuff in the book makes my skin crawl with shame. But it was important to say it.\" ==References== ==External links== * Official Page on HarperCollins Category:2015 non-fiction books Category:Books about rock musicians Category:American autobiographies Category:Music autobiographies Category:HarperCollins books ",
