On December 13, 1774, the Crown Prince Hetman of Poland Franciszek Ksawery Branicki received land from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Ksawery Branicki received these lands as a reward for the suppression of Cretaceous-Cossack uprisings at Koliivshchyna. His new possessions included the cities of Bila Tserkva and Skvyra, including 134 villages with a population of over 40 thousand people. Since then, the Bila Tserkva has become the private property of the Branicki Counts. Branicki wintered at the court of Catherine II in Saint Petersburg. In summer they moved to their estates in Ukraine, most often to White Church. In 1784, Branitskaya received this estate as a gift from her husband and began to put it in order. The name of the park was given in his honor - \"Alexandria\", today Oleksandriya. French architect Muffo was the author of the master plan for the park. Later, architects and gardeners Botani, Stange, Bartetsky, Witt, Jens worked there. They implemented the plan and laid the foundation of park compositions. The park's alleys were decorated with bronze and marble sculptures, vases. In the middle of the nineteenth century the park \"Alexandria\" was visited by Gavrila Derzhavin, Alexander Pushkin, Taras Shevchenko.
