    "text": "APC (formerly known as Australian Personal Computer) is a computer magazine in Australia. It is published monthly and comes with a cover-mounted DVD of software. It is published by Future Australia. According to the former editor, Tony Sarno, APC remains the personal computing magazine of choice for IT professionals and \"power-users\" (APC, June 2004, P10). The tagline on the front of the magazine is \"high performance personal computing\" which APC uses as its point of distinction from other computing titles published in Australia, such as PC User which targets beginner-medium users, and Atomic which targets gamers/modders. APC was first published in May 1980 by Sean Howard and is the longest running computer-magazine in Australia. The magazine also has a website, which publishes daily technology news (separate to what's in the printed magazine, with very few exceptions). The magazine was bought from Bauer Media Group in 2013 by Future.Future Acquires Leading Technology Brands APC and TechLife in Australia: PR Newswire, 16 August 2013 Future subsequently incorporated PC & Tech Authority into APC after acquiring it (along with other computing assets) from nextmedia in 2018. == Staff == APC's staff journalists are: * Melanie Farr (Deputy Editor) * Peter Dockrill (Web Editor) * Conrad Bem (Notebook Hunter Editor) * Nick Race (Reviews Editor) * Troy Coleman (Art Director and Journalist) Editors of APC: * Ben Mansill (2018\u2013current) * Dan Gardiner (2013\u20132018) * Tony Sarno (2004\u20132013) * David Flynn (2001\u20132004) * Nathan Taylor (2000) * Helen Dancer (1999\u20132000) * Steven Fear (1998\u20131999) * Jeremy White (1994\u20131998) * Maryanne Phillips (1992\u20131994) * Cathy Kennedy (1989\u20131992) * Jeremy Horey (1985\u20131989) * Sean Howard (1980\u20131985) == Cover disc == APC has a cover-mounted DVD each month containing a variety of software, which typically includes sample code, programs demonstrated in the magazine's Workshop pages, instructional videos, trial versions of new software and game releases and three to four \"full-working versions\" of programs that are no longer current editions.
