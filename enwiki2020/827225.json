    "text": "The BMW Z3 is a range of two-seater sports cars which was produced from 1995 to 2002. The body styles of the range are: * 2-door roadster (E36/7 model code) * 2-door coup\u00e9 (E36/8 model code) The Z3 was based on the E36 3 Series platform, while using the rear semi-trailing arm suspension design of the older E30 3 Series. It is the first mass-produced Z Series car. Z3M models were introduced in 1998 in roadster and coup\u00e9 body styles and were powered by the S50, S52, or S54 straight-six engine depending on country and model year. The Z3M models came with a 5-speed manual transmission. Production ended on June 28, 2002, with the Z3 line replaced by the E85 Z4. == Development and launch == Development on the roadster began in 1991 and was led by Burkhard G\u00f6schel. The exterior was designed by Joji Nagashima, being completed in mid-1992 at 39 months before production and the design was frozen in 1993. Design patents were filed on April 2, 1994 in Germany and on September 27, 1994 in the US. The Z3 was introduced via video press release by BMW North America on June 12, 1995. Production began on September 20, 1995.http://www.autonews.com/article/19950814/ANA/508140731/bmw- sets-z3-job-1-for-september Development on the coup\u00e9 model was run by a group of BMW engineers outside of work in their own time. The Z3 Coup\u00e9 shares the same platform and parts with the roadster, but features a chassis-stiffening hatch area and is 2.7 times stiffer in comparison. The Z3 Coup\u00e9 was unveiled at the 1997 Frankfurt Motor Show. The Z3 was the first BMW model to be solely manufactured outside of Germany. It was manufactured in Greer, South Carolina. == Body styles == File:1996-1998 BMW Z3 Roadster.jpg|E36/7 roadster (Pre- facelift) File:1998 BMW Z3 1.9 Rear.jpg|E36/7 roadster (Pre-facelift) File:2001 BMW Z3 Roadster Automatic 2.2 Rear.jpg|E36/7 roadster (Facelift) File:BMW Z3 Coupe 1Y7A6188.jpg|E36/8 coup\u00e9 === Roadster (E36/7) === Roadster models entered production in September 1995, powered by 4-cylinder engines on launch. 6-cylinder engines were later introduced in 1996. A removable hardtop roof was available as an optional accessory. === Coup\u00e9 (E36/8) === Coup\u00e9 models entered production in September 1998. The unusual side profile has been given nicknames such as \"clown shoe\" and \"bread van\" by critics. In Germany, it has been referred to as a \"turnschuh\" (sports shoe). The coup\u00e9 body style was only produced with six-cylinder engines (2.8, 3.0i, and M Coup\u00e9 models). == Transmissions == The available transmissions are: * 5-speed ZF S5-31 manual (Z3 2.8 / 3.0i / Z3M) * 5-speed Getrag 250 manual (Z3 1.8 / 1.9i / 2.0 / 2.2i / 2.5) * 4-speed GM 4L30-E automatic (Z3 1.9 / 2.0 / 2.5 / 2.8) * 5-speed ZF 5HP19 automatic (Z3 3.0i) * 5-speed GM 5L40-E automatic (Z3 2.2i / 2.5) == Models == The 4-cylinder models feature a single tailpipe, while 6-cylinder models have dual tailpipes, wheelarch flares (for pre-facelift models), and a revised front bumper. The 2.3 and 2.5 models were sold exclusively in the United States, while the 1.8, 2.0, and 2.2i models were not sold there. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! Model !!

European models were initially powered by the S50 inline-six engine, while North American models were powered by the less powerful S52 inline-six engine. In 2001 both the European and North American models switched to the new S54 engine. The Z3M was only available with a 5-speed manual transmission. Compared to the standard Z3, M models featured a limited slip differential, a wider rear track, and larger brakes (that are shared with the E36 M3). Z3M models were available in M-specific colors, they feature more aerodynamic wing-mirrors as well as redesigned front and rear bumpers and bespoke \"Roadstar\" Style 40 wheels, revised side gill and quad exhausts. The interior can also be differentiated by the voltmeter, clock and oil temperature gauges in the center console, leather-wrapped center console and door pulls, as well as unique M-styled seats and interior color options. Unlike the rest of the Z3 range, the Z3M did not receive cosmetic changes during the facelift in 2000.

The James Bond Edition was sold in 1996 for . BMW and Neiman Marcus had originally set a 20-unit sales goal, but this was later increased to 100 units after receiving a high level of interest from customers. The James Bond Edition was based on the Z3 1.9i and included a 007 dash plaque, 007 Bond floor mats, unique wheels, and chrome exterior trim. The colour scheme was an \"Atlantic blue\" exterior with beige leather interior, matching the Z3 which appeared in GoldenEye. === V12 prototype === In 1999, the BMW M division produced a single prototype Z3 powered by the 5.4 L M73 V12 engine, in order to test the space efficiency of the engine bay. It is based on the Z3 roadster, has 17 inch wheels with 225/45 tires up front and 245/40 at the rear, and is painted in a shade of orange. The V12 was rated at at 5,000 rpm and of torque at 3,900 rpm, and power is sent through a 6-speed manual transmission. The concept is much heavier than the standard Z3 at , giving it 70/30 weight distribution. The concept was only shown once, which was in 1999 to the motoring magazine Autozeitung. Their tests revealed a time of 5.5 seconds, a standing kilometer () in 24.4 seconds, and a top speed of . === Z3M Coup\u00e9 Safety Car === A safety car variant of the Z3M Coup\u00e9 was produced by the BMW M division for MotoGP and used in the 2000 season. == Model year changes == === 1997 === * M Roadster and M Coup\u00e9 models introduced to the public. * BMW Individual introduced to Z3 models. === 1998 === * Coup\u00e9 models introduced. * Wood trim and a power soft top were added as options. * Rollover hoops introduced. * Automatic stability control (ASC) became standard equipment on 1.9 models. * Hardtop shell option for Z3 models introduced. === 1999 facelift === In April 1999, the facelift (LCI) versions of the Z3 began production. Major changes include: * The Z3 2.0 model was replaced by the Z3 2.2i and the Z3 2.8 model was replaced by the Z3 3.0i, as the inline-six engines were upgraded from the M52 to the M54 (the addition of the \"i\" to the model names is not significant, since all engines use electronic fuel injection). In the United States, the Z3 2.3 model was replaced by the Z3 2.5. * Exterior design changes including redesigned chrome ring headlights and L-shaped taillights, wider rear track by 2.5 in (64mm) (now the same across 4 and 6-cylinder models), model designation badges, finger indent for trunk release button, integrated third brake light (with silver lights on 2.8 and 3.0i models), chrome exhaust tips, and new wheel designs. The Z3M models did not receive the these exterior changes. * Interior design changes including redesigned centre console buttons with a clock in the middle and a new three- spoke steering wheel design. * Electronic stability control upgraded from ASC to new DSC system. * New three-layer insulation convertible roof with headlining. * Dual-stage side airbags introduced. === 2000 === * DSC now integrated with Dynamic Brake Control (DBC) and Automatic Differential Brake (ADB) functions. === 2001 === * Z3M models switched from the BMW S50 (Euro spec) and BMW S52 (U.S. spec) inline-six engines to the BMW S54 inline-six engine. == Production volumes == One source provides the data below for production figures.

The Z3 is one of few non-British production cars to be driven by James Bond in a movie, and the first of three James Bond films featuring a BMW car. The Z3 in GoldenEye features stinger missiles hidden behind the headlights, an emergency parachute braking system and a radar scanner in the form of a LCD screen in the dashboard. It is also noted during the briefing scene, that the car contains a passenger ejector seat and a self-destruct system. Two blue prototypes were provided in January 1995 for filming at the Leavesden Aerodrome. The agreement between BMW and Eon Productions was for cross-promotion of the car and the film, and no money changed hands. Sales of the Z3 spiked as the film sat at number one at the box office. In the 1996 production run, more than 15,000 roadsters were sold out by the time the car was introduced. == Awards == * 1995 \"Super Reggie\" Best- of-show award for the GoldenEye marketing campaign * 1999 Edmunds' Most Wanted Convertible $25,001-$40,000 for the Z3 2.8 * 1999 Car and Driver \"Ten Best\" for M Coup\u00e9 / M Roadster * 1999 Automobile Magazine \"Design of the Year\" award for the M Coup\u00e9 * 1999 Automobile Magazine \"Best Sports Car\" award for the M Coup\u00e9 * 2000 Intellichoice \"Best Overall Value of the Year\" - \"Base Sport\" for the Z3 Roadster 2.3 * 2000 Top Gear (TV show) \"Driver's Car of the Year\" for the M Coup\u00e9 * 2009 Jalopnik \"Best 10 Cars of the Decade\" feature for the M Coup\u00e9 * 2011 Top Gear \"Hammond's Icons\" for the M Coup\u00e9 ==References== Z3 Category:Roadsters Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:2000s cars Category:Cars introduced in 1995 Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States Category:Touring cars ",
