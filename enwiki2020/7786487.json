In 2001 they collaborated with many other artists such as Nokaut, 187 Clan, DJ Ivo Glavata, Scum, Naste, Kaska, Dani, and Juliana to produce their first album, \"Urok #1\" (Lesson #1). It was very well received on the Bulgarian hip-hop scene. Due to the diversity of the artists involved in its creation, the album has tracks with jamaican (Raggaskit I and II), hardcore (Nokautskit), and pop (Julianaskit) sound, apart from the traditional hip-hop sound of the group. The constant members of the group are Ndoe and Mytag. In 1994 they formed \"Amnistia\" and released two albums with that group.
