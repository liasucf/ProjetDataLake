    "text": "Farhad Beg Cherkes (died 1614) was a Circassian favourite at the Safavid court of king (shah) Abbas I (r. 1588-1629). Having risen through the gholam ranks, he enjoyed a high position in the royal court, until he was executed following a court intrigue in 1614. ==Biography== Farhad Beg started his career as a regular falconer (qushchi) at the Safavid court, until he was promoted to the office of \u201cmaster of the hunt\u201d (m\u012br shek\u0101r-b\u0101shi) in 1614. Shortly after, he was suspected of forming a subversive relationship with the crown prince, Mohammad Baqer Mirza, whose mother was one of Abbas' Circassian wives. Based on this suspicion, in the same year, Abbas handed Farhad Beg to the prince, who, to show his fidelity to his father and the king of the empire, gave immediate orders for Farhad Beg Cherkes' execution and the confiscation of his property. At that time, the Royal camp was situated in Karabagh. Shortly after, fearing the crown prince's popularity, king Abbas ordered another Circassian, Behbud Beg, to murder the crown prince. ==References== == Sources == * * * Category:16th-century Iranian people Category:16th-century people of the Safavid Empire Category:Iranian people of Circassian descent Category:1614 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Ghilman Category:Masters of the hunt of the Safavid Empire Category:17th-century people of the Safavid Empire ",
