The wine produced here was classified as one of ten Quatri\u00e8mes Crus (Fourth Growths) in the historic Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. MacNeil, Karen, (2001). The Wine Bible, Workman Publishing, p. 885, Fran\u00e7ois-Antoine Pouget inherited Ch\u00e2teau Pouget in 1748. His daughter Claire married Pierre-Antoine de Chavailles in 1771. Over one and a half centuries, the Pouget de Chavailles family was in charge of Ch\u00e2teau Pouget. They had sometimes to face difficulties, as when, during the French Revolution, their properties were requisitioned, but they also met with great success, as Ch\u00e2teau Pouget was classified as a fourth Cru Class\u00e9 in 1855. The ch\u00e2teau itself used to be a cellar, its front portion was turned into a house during the second half of the 19th century. Two marble medaillons on the frontage of the house commemorate the different classifications of Ch\u00e2teau Pouget. == References == == External links == *Ch\u00e2teau Pouget official site Category:Bordeaux wine producers ",
