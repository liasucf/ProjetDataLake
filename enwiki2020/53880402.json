To accommodate the growing business, Magid added manufacturing facility in the Philippines and a distribution center and sales office in Mexico. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company volunteered to test disposable respirator masks against false promises of protection for first responders, health care workers, federal, state and local municipalities, and companies seeking to protect their workers. ==Notes== Category:Companies based in Will County, Illinois Category:Industrial supply companies Category:Romeoville, Illinois Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1946 Category:Manufacturing companies of the United States Category:1946 establishments in Illinois ",
