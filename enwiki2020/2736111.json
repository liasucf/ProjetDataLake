The CSIRO further used the site for pioneering experimentation in radio astronomy related to galactic radio emissions, with a team including John Gatenby Bolton first observing solar emissions in 1945. The site primarily made use of Yagi antennas. The first radio source they identified with something that could be seen was in the constellation Taurus, and named Taurus A, which is in fact the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant (the remains of an exploding star) first reported by Chinese astronomers in the year 1054. ==References== *The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia ==Further reading== * Bolton, J. \"Radio astronomy at Dover Heights,\" Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of Australia, 4, 349-358 (1982). * CSIRO, \"Radio astronomy at Dover Heights\" * Orchiston, W. & B.
