    "text": "Portrait of Edmond Albius, circa 1863 Edmond Albius (1829 \u2013 9 August 1880) was a horticulturalist from R\u00e9union. Born into slavery, Albius became an important figure in the cultivation of vanilla. At the age of 12, he invented a technique for pollinating vanilla orchids quickly and profitably. Albius' technique revolutionized the cultivation of vanilla and made it possible to profitably grow vanilla beans away from their native Mexico. ==Early life== Albius was born in St. Suzanne, R\u00e9union. His mother, a slave, died during his birth. The colonist keeping Edmond in slavery was F\u00e9r\u00e9ol Bellier Beaumont. ==Vanilla pollination== French colonists brought vanilla beans to R\u00e9union and nearby Mauritius in the 1820s with the hope of starting production there. However, the vines were sterile because no insect would pollinate them. In the 1830s, Charles Morren, a professor of botany at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, developed a method of hand-pollinating vanilla, but his technique was slow and required too much effort to make cultivating vanilla a moneymaking proposition.Hazen J (1995) Vanilla. Chronicle Books. San Francisco, CA. In 1841, Albius invented a method to quickly pollinate the vanilla orchid using a thin stick or blade of grass and a simple thumb gesture. Using the stick or grass blade, field hands lift the rostellum, the flap that separates the male anther from the female stigma, and then, with their thumbs, smear the sticky pollen from the anther over the stigma. Albius\u2019 manual pollination method is still used today, as nearly all vanilla is pollinated by hand. After Albius\u2019s discovery, R\u00e9union became for a time the world's largest supplier of vanilla. French colonists used Albius' technique in Madagascar to cultivate vanilla, and Madagascar remains the world's chief vanilla producer.Rain P (1986) The Vanilla Cookbook. Celestial Arts. Berkeley, CA. ==Later life== In 1848, France outlawed slavery in its colonies, and Albius left the plantation for St. Denis, where he worked as a kitchen servant. He was convicted of stealing jewelry and sentenced to ten years in prison, but the sentence was commuted after five years when the governor granted him clemency in light of his enormous contribution to vanilla production in R\u00e9union. Albius died in poverty in St. Suzanne in 1880. ==References== Category:Vanilla Category:People of African descent from R\u00e9union Category:Slaves from R\u00e9union Category:Horticulturists from R\u00e9union Category:1829 births Category:1880 deaths Category:19th-century slaves ",
