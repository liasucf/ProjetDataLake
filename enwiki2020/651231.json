According to Karl Marx, human beings enter into certain productive, or economic, relations and these relations lead to a form of social consciousness. Marx said: \"In the social production of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will; these relations of production correspond to a definite stage of development of their material forces of production. The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society \u2014 the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life determines the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.\"Marx, Karl. (1859) \"Preface\" in A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. More recently, social consciousness is linked to the collective self-awareness and experience of collectively shared social identity. From this viewpoint, social consciousness denotes conscious awareness of being part of an interrelated community of others. The \u201cwe feeling\u201d or the \u201csense of us\u201d may be experienced in members of various cultures and social groups. By the experience of collectively shared social identity, individuals may experience social unity. Social consciousness may also stimulate working towards a common goal. == See also == *Class consciousness *Collective consciousness *Consciousness raising *Social conscience *Social intelligence == References == ==Further reading== *Awakening to Race: Individualism and Social Consciousness in America *Children's Social Consciousness and the Development of Social Responsibility *Class Structure in the Social Consciousness, Volume 102 *Language, ideology and social consciousness: developing a sociohistorical approach *Literature, social consciousness, and polity *Theology and the social consciousness: a study of the relations of the social consciousness to theology Category:Sociological terminology Category:Marxist terminology Category:Marxism Category:Historical materialism ",
