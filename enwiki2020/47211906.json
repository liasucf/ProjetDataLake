    "text": "Ford Tractor Company was a Minneapolis-based company active from 1916 to 1917, that built tractors to facilitate \"horseless farming\". == History == Share of the Ford Tractor Company, issued 12. June 1917 Ford Tractor Company was incorporated on March 15, 1915 by W. Baer Ewing and Paul W. Ford. Prior to founding the company, Ewing worked in the insurance business. The choice of name has been assessed as deceptive by later commentators. Businessman W. Baer Ewing had hired tractor designer Robert Kinkaid to develop his product line, but named the company after one Paul Ford, a local hardware clerk Ewing had hired, allegedly to leverage the Ford name to take advantage of customer confusion with Henry Ford. The company may have hoped for a quick settlement with Henry Ford to acquire the name, but instead Henry Ford marketed his own line of tractors, beginning in 1916, under the brand name Fordson. On, June 19,1916, Paul Ford was relieved of his duties with the company but still continued to receive compensation. === Documentary === The company is the subject of a silent educational documentary produced in 1917, Horseless Farming With Ford Tractors.Farming With Ford Tractors - 1917 Educational Documentary ==References== Category:Tractor manufacturers of the United States Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1916 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1918 Category:1916 establishments in Minnesota Category:1918 disestablishments in Minnesota ",
