He started busking in Durban's beach front at the age of 7 with a self made cooking oil tin guitar. His music is influenced by his upbringing and the history of apartheid system which saw him being a victim of forced removal as a young person. Kunene was discovered by Sipho Gumede and brought him to Johannesburg where he shared the stage with world renowned musicians such as Hugh Masekela, Winston Mankunku Ngozi and Busi Mhlongo. ==References== Category:South African jazz guitarists Category:South African musicians Category:1951 births Category:Living people ",
