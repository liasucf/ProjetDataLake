    "text": "Diabolus Arcanium was an Indian black metal band that was formed in 2011.The band is a result of Hex's interest in darker music, and not being able to do that with Fortified Destruction he renamed the band to Diabolus arcanium. The band combines elements of black metal (screeching vocals, keyboards/orchestra) with some neo-classical guitar influences. Lyrical themes vary, either about Satanism, death, war, lost love, Satanic or otherwise anti-religious themes (common in black metal), or combinations. The band after the new name and line up got signed to Haught records (USA) and released their demo album \"Spellbound\" to mostly good review. They have released their demo album, Spellbound in 2014. The band is set to release their debut full-length album titled \"Path of ascension\" with a partially live recorded orchestra. http://themetalden.com/?p=41592 The band recently released a single paying a tribute to the legendary Emperor with a cover of \"I Am The Black Wizards,\" taken off the iconic \"In The Nightside Eclipse\" album. http://bravewords.com/news/diabolus-arcanium-pay-tribute-to-emperor-i-am-the- black-wizards-cover-released-streaming http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=109386 ==Path of ascension 2015== The band fired their previous members Nero, Solas and Astaroth due to some internal issues while their album \"Path of ascension\" was in post-production.
