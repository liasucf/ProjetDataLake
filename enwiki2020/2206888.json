    "text": "Kai Tracid (born as Kai Franz on 17 January 1972 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany) is a trance DJ and producer. The name Tracid originates from the combination of the two electronic music styles Trance and Acid. In 2009 he stopped making music and co-founded a yoga centre Balance Yoga. In Germany he became famous with his first single, \"Your Own Reality\". In 1998 he gained worldwide fame with Liquid Skies. In November 2001 he got his first Top-10 hit in the German single charts. In February 2020, Tracid announced his return to the scene with the release of his new single \"DT64\", a collaboration with Moguai. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Skywalker 1999 (1999) * Trance & Acid (2002) * Contemplate (The Reason You Exist) (2003) ===Remix Albums=== * Remix Collection (2012) ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\"| Single ! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! width=\"35\" | GER ! width=\"35\" | AUT ! width=\"35\" | SUI |- | rowspan=\"1\"| 1996 | align=\"left\"| \"So Simple\" | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"|Singles only |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 1997 | align=\"left\"| \"Makin' Friends\" | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- | align=\"left\"| \"Your Own Reality\" | 22 | \u2014 | \u2014 |align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"|Skywalker 1999 |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| 1998 | align=\"left\"| \"Dance For Eternity\" | 26 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- | align=\"left\"| \"Liquid Skies\" | 31 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"| 1999 | align=\"left\"| \"Destiny's Path\" | 29 | \u2014 | 75 |align=\"left\" rowspan=\"5\"|Trance & Acid |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"| 2000 | align=\"left\"| \"Tiefenrausch (The Deep Blue)\" | 41 | \u2014 | 77 |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2001 | align=\"left\"| \"Too Many Times\" | 24 | \u2014 | 73 |- | align=\"left\"| \"Life Is Too Short\" | 9 | 32 | 49 |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2002 | align=\"left\"| \"Trance & Acid\" | 37 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- | align=\"left\"| \"4 Just 1 Day\" | 12 | 38 | \u2014 |align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\"|Contemplate (The Reason You Exist) |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"| 2003 | align=\"left\"| \"Conscious\" | 44 | \u2014 | \u2014 |align=\"left\" rowspan=\"5\"| Singles only |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2007 | align=\"left\"| \"Inflator/Aural Border\" | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- | align=\"left\"| \"Depressive Mood/Discreet Charm\" | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2020 | align=\"left\"| \"DT64\" (with Moguai) | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- | align=\"left\"| \"Freedom Of Expression\" (with A*S*Y*S) | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- | colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:85%\"| \"\u2014\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released. |} == Early works== *Radon (1996) As Mac Acid II *Waveshaper (1999) As K *Only The Strong (1996) As K == References == == External links == * * Russian Kai Tracid Web * Tracid Traxxx * Got on position 41 in DJ Mag poll 2005 * Kai Tracid * A Dose of Trance and Acid \u2013 5 minutes with Kai Tracid, Interview in ResidentAdvisor.net, Australia, 2005 Category:German trance musicians Category:Club DJs Category:German DJs Category:Living people Category:1972 births Category:Electronic dance music DJs ",
