His early education, young Rylsky received at home. In 1908 he entered the 3rd grade of the Kyiv Private Gymnasium of Volodymyr Naumenko. During his gymnasium period Rylsky befriended with families of Mykola Lysenko and Oleksandr Rusov. In 1915-17 he studied at medical faculty of Kyiv University, with creation of Ukrainian People's University in October 1917, Rylsky transferred to its history and philology faculty. Due to the Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War, Rylsky left Kyiv in late 1917 and with his brother Ivan worked at food administration in the city of Skvyra, later worked as a rural teacher in villages nearby. In 1918 Bolshevik sympathizers in Romanivka drove Rylsky from his family house, robbed it, destroyed invaluable archive and library of his father. Rylsky returned to Kyiv only in 1923 where at first he was earning money as a teacher. ==Works== He began writing poems early. His first poem was published in 1907 in a newspaper \"Rada\", his first collection \"At white isles\" () saw the world in 1910. Already in 1918 his poems \"Tsarevna\", \"On the edge of the forest\", collection \"Beneath autumn stars\" showed that period of internship and \"voice sampling\" has passed, and his 1922 collection \"Blue distance\" confirmed it for sure. The 1920s were marked by the poet's creative flourishing: his collections \"Through storm and snow\" (1925), \"The 13th spring\" (1926), \"Where roads meet\", \"Hum and rumbling\" (both 1929). In the last of those collections Rylsky arose also as a gifted translator of world poetry i.e. works of Paul Verlaine, Valery Bryusov, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Maurice Maeterlinck, and others. The event of cultural and artistic life became a translation of \"Pan Tadeusz\" of Adam Mickiewicz. As a representative of the \"pure art\" doctrine, during the years when the Stalinists adopted the official doctrine of \"socialist realism\". In 1937 he was involved in rewriting the libretto of Mykola Lysenko's opera Taras Bulba, returning later to neo-classical forms. Maksym Rylsky is one of the most outstanding Ukrainian poets of the 20th century and master of the genres of the modern sonnet and the long narrative poem. He was closely associated with the Neoclassicist group of Ukrainian poets, who employed traditional poetic forms with rhyme and meter, wrote in a clear and accessible contemporary idiom, and often referenced Ancient Greek and Roman mythology as well as numerous other authors from world literature in their poetry. During the wartime period he wrote two masterful long poems that deviated from socialist realism\u2014\"Thirst\" (1942) and \"Journey to Youth\" (1941-4), for which he was again publicly chastised. In 1942 he became Director of the Institute of Fine Arts, Folklore and Ethnography in Kyiv, a post that he held until his death in 1964. The Institute now bears his name. He published some 30 collections of original poetry during his lifetime as well as numerous translations and scholarly works. By 1974 almost five million copies of his works in the original or in translation had appeared in the USSR. Rylsky joined Communist party in 1943 and was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1946. ==Awards== ===Prizes=== * Lenin Prize, 1960 \u2013 for his collections of poems \"Daleki neboskhyly\" (1959) and \"Troyandy j vynohrad\" (1957) * Stalin Prize, 1943 \u2013 for his collections of poems \"Slovo pro ridnu matir\", \"Svitova zorya\", \"Svitla zbroya\", \"Mandrivka v molodist\" * Stalin Prize, 1950 \u2013 translation into Ukrainian a poem \"Pan Tadeusz\" by Adam Mickiewicz ==See also== * Rylsky Institute of Art Studies, Folklore and Ethnology ==References== ==External links== *Rylsky's works in Ukrainian *Koshelivets, I.
