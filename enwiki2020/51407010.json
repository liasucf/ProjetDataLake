He has won the Icelandic championship eight times and the Icelandic Basketball Cup three times with KR and is the club's all-time leader in scoring and games played. ==College== Brynjar played for Francis Marion University from 2008 to 2009. He left the school in January 2009. ==Playing career== Brynjar has spent the majority of his playing career with KR and is its all-time leader in games played. In the fifth and deciding game of the 2007 \u00darvalsdeild Finals against Sn\u00e6fell, Brynjar made a three-point shot with 3 seconds left in regulation to tie the game at 68\u201368 and send it to overtime. KR prevailed in overtime, winning the game 76\u201374 and its tenth national championship. Brynjar joined J\u00e4mtland Basket of the Swedish Basketligan in 2011 and for the season he averaged 10.4 points per game and made 40.8 percent of his three point shots. He rejoined KR in 2012 and helped the club win the national championship four times in a row, from 2014 to 2017. He resigned with KR in 2017 after contemplating a move to \u00de\u00f3r Akureyri. On November 10, 2017, Brynjar became KR's all-time leading scorer in the \u00darvalsdeild, surpassing Gu\u00f0ni \u00d3lafur Gu\u00f0nason who scored 3144 points for KR. On March 12, 2018, Brynjar broke a finger on practice and was expected to miss KR's first round playoff series against Njar\u00f0v\u00edk. On April 25, 2018, Brynjar scored a buzzer beater to give KR a 75\u201377 victory against Tindast\u00f3ll and a 2\u20131 lead in the \u00darvalsdeild finals series. On April 28, he won his eight Icelandic championship after KR defeated Tindast\u00f3ll in the fourth game of the series. On June 8, 2018, Brynjar left KR and signed with rivals Tindast\u00f3ll. On 30 September, he won the Icelandic Super Cup after Tindast\u00f3ll beat KR, 103\u201372. On December 9, Brynjar set the \u00darvalsdeild record for most three-pointers made in a game when he made 16 of 31 three-point shots, on his way to 48 points, in a victory against Brei\u00f0ablik, breaking Frank Booker's 27-year-old record. In April 2019, Tindast\u00f3ll agreed to release him from his contract following the team's first round exit in the \u00darvalsdeild playoffs. On 29 June 2019, Brynjar returned to KR. On 5 March 2020 he announced he would not play in KR's upcoming game against Stjarnan due to the coronavirus pandemic in Iceland without consulting the team first. Shortly later, on 13 March 2020 with each team having one game left, the season was postponed, and later canceled due to the pandemic. ==Icelandic national team== From 2007 to 2017, Brynjar played 68 games for the Icelandic national team.
