Montr\u00e9alone parent compound == Structure == The montr\u00e9alone parent compound has been studied theoretically,Krenske, E. H.; Houk, K. N.; Arndtsen, B. A.; St. Cyr, D.

() Substituted montr\u00e9alones with a balance of stability and reactivity have been used as reaction intermediates in the synthesis of other heterocycles. A substituted montr\u00e9alone Theoretical and experimental analysis of stable montr\u00e9alones reveals overlapping azomethine ylide and Wittig-type moieties within the unsaturated 5-membered organophosphorus ring system. Depending on the phosphorus substituents, ring-chain valence tautomerism allows montr\u00e9alones to display variable degrees of equilibrium and structural blending with N-acyl amino phosphonium ylide forms. The cyclic 1,3-dipolar form is detectably or exclusively formed with phosphite and phosphonite-based analogs. Triphenylphosphine-based variants lack sufficient tendency for intramolecular cyclization, and exist as acyclic phosphonium ylides.St. Cyr, D. J.; Arndtsen, B.

() center == Synthesis == Montr\u00e9alones are related to Wittig reagents and can be generated in a similar fashion. Reaction of organophosphorus(III) compounds with N-acyliminium ions affords phosphonium salt intermediates which are deprotonated using non-nucleophilic bases (e.g. DBU, LiHMDS). N-Acyliminium ions are generated in situ from acid chlorides and imines such that the '1,3-dipole' itself is generated in a multi-component reaction. The most efficient phosphorus(III) precursor for dipole synthesis is 2-phenylbenzo[d][1,3,2]dioxaphosphole [PhP(catechyl)] owing to the balance of nucleophilicity and electrophilicity that it affords. center == Reactions == Montr\u00e9alones participate in 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions with dipolarophiles such as imines, alkenes, and alkynes to respectively afford imidazoles,Aly, S.; Romashko, M.; Arndtsen, B.

() and pyrroles.Organic Chemistry Portal pyrrole synthesis abstract: The latter heterocyclic products were obtained by multi-component reactions involving in situ-generation of montr\u00e9alones from imines, acid chlorides, and phosphonites prior to one-pot reactions with the dipolarophile. Moreover, conjugated poly(1,3-dipole) variants of montr\u00e9alones have been generated and used in the synthesis of polyheterocycles related to polypyrroles. Kayser, L.

() In contrast to related Diels-Alder reactions, rationalization of regioisomeric bias using conventional frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory fails. The complementary use of mont\u00e9alones and m\u00fcnchnones allows product mixtures to be avoided and highlights the need to consider transition-state geometrical changes (distortion) in the rationalization process.Morin, M.
