    "text": "Logo in 2004 The Wall Street Journal Europe was a daily English-language newspaper that covered global and regional business news for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Published by Dow Jones & Company (a News Corp company), it formed part of the business publication franchise which included The Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal Asia, and The Wall Street Journal Online (WSJ.com). The final print edition of the newspaper was published on 29 September 2017. Founded in 1983, The Wall Street Journal Europe was printed in nine locations throughout the region \u2013 Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the U.K. and Israel. The paper was distributed in more than 60 countries with almost 80% of its subscribers European citizens. The Wall Street Journal Europe drew on the Dow Jones network of more than 1,900 editors and reporters worldwide, including more than 400 in Europe alone, operating from 30 news bureaus across the EMEA region. Its website, offered news and analysis, opinion, market data and multimedia features tailored for a European audience by a London-based editorial team. Blogs include New Europe covering Eastern and Central Europe; Iain Martin's blog on U.K. Politics The Source; and Real Time Brussels, offering analysis on events through the European business day. Content was also available via mobile devices, including a Europe edition of the WSJ.com Blackberry Reader; and a mobile-optimized website which provided continually updated news, information and analysis from Europe.WSJ.com, via any web- enabled mobile device or smartphone. Growth figures for circulation of The Wall Street Journal Europe may not be directly comparable to that of other newspapers beginning January 2008 due to the Journal's contract with Executive Learning Partnership (ELP) of the Netherlands. This agreement involved ELP's purchasing copies of the newspaper at between 1\u00a2 and 5\u00a2 cents a copy, well below normal market price. These copies, given at no cost to students, represented 41% of The Wall Street Journal Europe circulation by 2010. Since ELP received payments from the Journal through intermediary companies, some journalists and a whistleblower then employed by the Journal alleged that the newspaper was secretly boosting circulation figures by buying its own papers. This could have had a positive impact on the newspaper's advertising revenues. The contract also committed the Journal to publishing articles that reportedly promoted ELP's activities. While maintaining that the arrangement was legitimate and appropriate, the European managing director of the Journal's parent Dow Jones & Company, Andrew Langhoff, resigned in October 2011. Les Hinton, who was chief executive officer of Dow Jones & Company and who was reportedly advised of the arrangement with ELP, resigned July 2011 in conjunction with the unrelated News International phone hacking scandal. ==References== ==External links== * Europe Category:Business newspapers Category:International newspapers Category:Newspapers published in Europe Category:Publications established in 1983 Category:1983 establishments in Europe Category:Business in Europe ",
