The Canal de la Meuse is the current name of what used to be the northern branch of the Canal de l'Est (French: \"canal of the east\"). It is a canal in northeastern France, predominantly made up of the canalised river Meuse. The Canal de l'Est was built from 1874 to 1887 to provide a waterway inside the new border with Prussia after the Franco-Prussian War, Overall, the canal had a total length of . In 2003, the northern and southern branches were officially renamed Canal de la Meuse and Canal des Vosges respectively.Canal de l'Est in Dictionnaire des rivi\u00e8res et canaux de France == Canal de la Meuse (formerly Canal de l'Est, northern branch) == Mouzon The Canal de la Meuse starts at Givet in the Ardennes d\u00e9partement. It follows the Meuse upstream, passing through Mouzon, Fumay, Revin, Nouzonville, Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, Sedan, Stenay, Verdun, Saint-Mihiel and Commercy, and joins the Canal de la Marne au Rhin at Troussey. This canal is long. For most of its length, the canal is the canalised river Meuse. == Canal des Vosges (formerly southern branch) == Canal des Vosges at Golbey Originally, the southern branch of the Canal de l'Est started at Toul, where it branched off the Canal de la Marne au Rhin. Since the Moselle has been made navigable for high-capacity barges up to Neuves- Maisons, the part of the Canal de l'Est between Toul and Neuves-Maisons is considered part of the Moselle. The canal follows the Moselle upstream through Charmes and Thaon-les-Vosges until Golbey, north of \u00c9pinal, where it leaves the Moselle valley. It passes through Les Forges and enters the valley of the C\u00f4ney near Uzemain. It follows the C\u00f4ney downstream until its confluence with the Sa\u00f4ne at Corre in the Haute-Sa\u00f4ne department, the southern end of the Canal de l'Est. This branch of the canal is long. ==Geographic latitude and longitude== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! branch ! commune ! latitude and longitude |- | northern | Givet | |- | northern | Fumay | |- | northern | Revin | |- | northern | Nouzonville | |- | northern | Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res | |- | northern | Sedan | |- | northern | Mouzon | |- | northern | Stenay | |- | northern | Verdun | |- | northern | Saint-Mihiel | |- | northern | Commercy | |- | northern | Troussey | |- | southern | Toul | |- | southern | Neuves- Maisons | |- | southern | Charmes | |- | southern | Thaon-les-Vosges | |- | southern | Golbey | |- | southern | Les Forges | |- | southern | Uzemain | |- | southern | Corre | |} ==See also== * List of canals in France ==References== == External links == * Canal de la Meuse navigation guide; places, ports and moorings on the canal, by the author of Inland Waterways of France, Imray * Canal des Vosges navigation guide; places, ports and moorings on the canal, by the author of Inland Waterways of France, Imray * Navigation details for 80 French rivers and canals (French waterways website section) *G\u00e9oportail *, hydrological and Meuse catchment area data Est Category:Canals opened in 1887 ",
