    "text": "is a Japanese light novel series written by FUNA and illustrated by Itsuki Akata. A manga adaptation by Neko Mint began serialization in 2016. Both the light novel and manga have been licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment. An anime television series adaptation by Project No.9 aired from October 7 to December 23, 2019. ==Plot== Misato Kurihara, a genius girl who couldn't make any friends due to her exceptional abilities, is killed after being run over while protecting a young girl. Offered the chance to be reborn into a fantasy world, Misato asks that she simply be reincarnated with average abilities. Reborn as the noble Adele von Ascham, she soon discovers that \"average\" in this new world takes into account the power of the absolute strongest and the absolute weakest magical creatures, resulting in her physical and magical abilities being 6,800 times stronger than that of a typical human, which is half of that of the strongest ancient dragon (the strongest of all the magical creatures). Attending Hunter's Prep School alongside her classmates Mavis, Reina, and Pauline, Adele tries her best to live her life as normally as possible, which does not prove to be an easy feat. ==Characters== ; / : : The central character, Adele is a twelve-year-old girl with long silver hair. She was originally an intelligent Japanese girl named , who was unable to make friends due to the expectations placed upon her. After losing her life while saving a girl from an oncoming truck, she was offered the chance to be reincarnated into a fantasy world, asking only that she would be given \"average\" abilities so she can live a normal life. After regaining her memories at the age of ten, Adele discovered that her abilities, which are the average of all magical creatures in the world, are 6,800 times more powerful than an average human, giving her excessive physical strength and powerful magic. After failing to hide her abilities at Eckland Academy, she left her home country and took on the alias of \"Mile\" to attend Hunter's Prep School, where she forms a party named . She loves anime, manga, and video games, the knowledge of which she uses in her new life in very interesting ways. She has a boob complex, which provokes her anger when someone points it out. ; : : Also known as Crimson Reina, she is a mage specializing in fire magic. She was born to a traveling merchant, and became a Hunter at an early age, giving her the most practical knowledge and experience amongst the Crimson Vow party members. She has a signature fire spell called Crimson Hellfire, and has a particular hatred for bandits after both her father and a Hunter group who had taken her in after his death were killed by such brigands. Despite being fifteen years old at the start of the series, she is assumed to be a similar age to Mile, the youngest member of their group, due to her height and appearance which is a source of annoyance for her. ; : : The official leader of the Crimson Vow (although it is always Reina that does the actual \"leading\"), Mavis is a 17-year-old swordswoman of noble birth. After running away from home in the hopes of becoming a knight, she met the other members of the Crimson Vow at the Hunters' Prep School and helped to form the party. She is tall and has an androgynous appearance, making her popular with other girls. She is a softie for sappy and sad stories, especially the backstories behind each of her friends. ; : : A 14-year-old mage specializing in healing and water magic, she is the daughter of a merchant and the resident bookkeeper of the Crimson Vow. Despite her miserly manner, she typically has a gentle appearance and demeanor but is known to show fits of ruthlessness when called for. Her family's company is called the Beckett Company, although whether Pauline's surname is the same has not been confirmed. ; : :A mysterious creature which only shows itself to Adele. It watches over the nanomachines that make up people's magic in the other world, the remnants of a vastly advanced, now lost civilization. In the manga, it appears as a tiny, sphere-bodied robot, while in the anime it looks like a young cat. ; : :The daughter of a family managing the inn where Mile and later the whole of Crimson Vow take up residence ; : : The third daughter of a baron and a friend of Adele's. At first highly jealous of the attention Adele received for her abilities, she and her friends softened up on her after learning of her tragic family past and sincere personality. ; : : The daughter of a merchant and a friend of Adele's. ; : : A commoner attending Eckland Academy on scholarship and a friend of Adele's. ; : A young man who Misato met after her death, who claims to have a role similar to \"God\". As thanks to Misato for saving a girl he had chosen to be mankind's future savior, he grants her a reincarnation into a fantasy world with average abilities, as requested. However, since he measured the term \"average\" using the new world's most powerful creature - an ancient dragon - as a template, Misato's reincarnation has been granted powers far beyond what she actually wanted. ; : : Misato's younger sister. Although she loves her family, she is not a hardcore otaku like the rest of them. ==Media== ===Web novel=== FUNA began serializing the story as a web novel on the user-generated novel publishing website Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d on January 14, 2016. , 289 chapters of the web novel have been published. ===Light novels=== The series was acquired for print publication by Taibundo and Earth Star Entertainment, who published the first light novel, with illustrations by Itsuki Akata, in May 2016 under their Earth Star Novel imprint.
