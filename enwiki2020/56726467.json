He also published 4 volumes of poetry which are no longer extant. Toqto'a et al. Song Shi, Ch. 208. ==Biography== Wang Cheng's ancestral home was Mei Prefecture, but since his father Wang Shang (\u738b\u8cde) and grandfather Wang Huai (\u738b\u6dee) were both officials, it's unlikely Wang Cheng was born there. His father Wang Shang worked in the editorial office for the Veritable Records in 1142\u20131143 and had access to a lot of government information, which was an important source for Wang Cheng's Dongdu Shil\u00fce. In 1178, historian Hong Mai submitted a memorial to Emperor Xiaozong in which he recommended Dongdu Shil\u00fce as highly valuable for his compilation of the National History of Four Emperors (\u56db\u671d\u570b\u53f2). Emperor Xiaozong then granted Wang Cheng an office in Long Prefecture as a Gentleman for Discussion (\u627f\u8b70\u90ce). Wang Cheng, Dongdu Shil\u00fce, Preface. ==References== * * Category:Song dynasty historians Category:12th-century Chinese historians ",
