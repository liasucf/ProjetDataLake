Twenty-one All-Star Games have been held since the Tampa Bay Lightning entered the league in 1992, with at least one player chosen to represent the Lightning in each year except 1998. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, and 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games. Tampa Bay has hosted two All-Star games. The first was the 49th, which took place at the Ice Palace Arena. The second was the 63rd National Hockey League All-Star Game, which took place at Amalie Arena. * Selected by fan vote {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Tampa Bay Lightning players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game |- !scope=\"col\" | Game !scope=\"col\" | Year !scope=\"col\" | Name !scope=\"col\" | Position !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References |- ! scope=\"row\" | 44th |1993 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 45th |1994 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 46th |1996 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 47th |1997 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 48th |1998 |No Lightning selected |\u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 49th | 1999 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 50th |2000 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 51st |2001 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 52nd |2002 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 53rd |rowspan=\"3\" |2003 | | |rowspan=\"3\" | |- | | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 54th | rowspan=\"2\"|2004 | | | rowspan=\"2\"| |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 55th |rowspan=\"2\" |2007 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 56th |rowspan=\"2\" |2008 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 57th |rowspan=\"2\" |2009 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 58th |rowspan=\"2\" |2011 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 59th |2012 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 60th |rowspan=\"2\" |2015 | (Did not play) | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 61st |rowspan=\"2\" |2016 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 62nd |rowspan=\"2\" |2017 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"6\" | 63rd |rowspan=\"6\" |2018 | | |rowspan=\"6\" | |- | (Did not play) | |- | | |- | (Replaced Hedman) | |- | | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 64th |rowspan=\"4\" |2019 | | |rowspan=\"4\" | |- | | |- | | |- | (Replaced Carey Price) | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 65th |rowspan=\"2\" |2020 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | (Replaced Tuukka Rask) | |} ==Career achievements== ===Hockey Hall of Fame=== The following is a list of Tampa Bay Lightning who have been enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Tampa Bay Lightning inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame ! scope=\"col\" |Individual ! scope=\"col\" |Category ! scope=\"col\" |Year inducted ! scope=\"col\" |Years with Lightning in category ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References |- ! scope=\"row\" |'''''' |Player |2017 |2001\u20132006 |, retrieved November 16, 2017 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2010 |1996\u20131998 |, retrieved June 30, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2017 |2008\u20132009 |, retrieved November 16, 2017 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2000 |1993\u20131995 |, retrieved June 30, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" |'''''' |Player |2018 |2000\u20132014 | |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Members of the Tampa Bay Lightning to receive other recognition from Hockey Hall of Fame ! scope=\"col\" |Individual ! scope=\"col\" |Award ! scope=\"col\" |Year awarded ! scope=\"col\" |Years with franchise ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References |- ! scope=\"row\" |Rick Peckham |Foster Hewitt Memorial Award |2020 |1995\u20132020 | |} ===United States Hockey Hall of Fame=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Members of the Tampa Bay Lightning inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame ! scope=\"col\" |Individual ! scope=\"col\" |Year inducted ! scope=\"col\" |Years with franchise ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References |- ! scope=\"row\" | |2016 |1998\u20131999 | |} ===Retired numbers=== The Tampa Bay Lightning have retired two numbers, which means that no player can use those uniform numbers again while part of the team. The most recently retired number is that of Vincent Lecavalier, whose number was retired on February 10, 2018. Also out of circulation is the number 99 which was retired league-wide for Wayne Gretzky on February 6, 2000. Gretzky did not play for the Lightning during his 20-year NHL career and no Lightning player had ever worn the number 99 prior to its retirement. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+ Tampa Bay Lightning retired numbers ! scope=\"col\" |Number ! scope=\"col\" |Player ! scope=\"col\" |Position ! scope=\"col\" |Years with Lightning as a player ! scope=\"col\" |Date of retirement ceremony ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References |- ! scope=\"row\" |4 | | |1998\u20132013 |February 10, 2018 | |- ! scope=\"row\" |26 | | |2000\u20132014 |January 13, 2017 | |} ==Other awards== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+ Tampa Bay Lightning franchise players who have received non-NHL awards ! scope=\"col\" |Award ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |Description ! scope=\"col\" |Winner ! scope=\"col\" |Season ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References |- ! scope=\"row\" |Guldpucken |The ice hockey player of the year in Sweden | | |Normally the Guldpucken is awarded to a player in Sweden, but Hedman won the award for his play in the NHL. |} ==See also== *List of National Hockey League awards ==Notes== ==References== Tampa Bay Lightning award ",
