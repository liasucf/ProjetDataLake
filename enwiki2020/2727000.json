She studied sculpture under her father, and exhibited her works at the Royal Academy of Arts at age 21. In 1840, she married Thomas Thornycroft, a student of her father. The couple travelled to Italy and lived and worked for a time in Rome. While in Rome, Mary Thornycroft became friends with the sculptors Bertel Thorvaldsen and John Gibson. On her return to London, Gibson recommended her services to Queen Victoria. Moreover, Gibson\u2019s recommendation of Mary is what marked the beginning of her sequence of royal commissions lasting from 1844-1877. Thornycroft created numerous busts and statues for the Queen, chiefly of the royal children. The drawing-room at Osborne House contained nine life-size marble statues of the young princes and princesses that were modeled by Thornycroft. She also executed a number of busts of private individuals, as well as a few ideal statues. Among the latter is her well- known figure of a \u2018Skipping Girl\u2019.'The Skipping Girl', Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951, University of Glasgow History of Art and HATII, online database 2011, accessed 2 Aug 2011 Most of her works were portraits of the royal children that were commissioned by Queen Victoria. Thornycroft gave sculpting lessons to Princess Louise who was one of Queen Victoria\u2019s daughters, she eventually became a sculptor herself. Thornycroft died on February 1st, 1895.[1] ==Family== The Thornycrofts had six children who grew to adulthood, two sons (Hamo and John Isaac), and four daughters (Alyce, Theresa, Helen and Frances). Hamo Thornycroft became a sculptor while daughters Alyce, Theresa Thornycroft, and Helen Thornycroft became artists. John Isaac Thornycroft became a marine engineer. The Thornycrofts were the grandparents of Siegfried Sassoon, the war poet, through their daughter Theresa, who married Alfred Ezra Sassoon. == Artworks == === Early work === Mary Thornycroft was hired as a sculptor by Queen Victoria. Thornycroft sculpted many different busts,fragments, and sculptures that are now within the Royal Collection. Her first ever sculpture that was exhibited in the Royal Collection was a bust of her father in 1835. As a woman, she had a limited choice of commissions, but she took the opportunity to choose infants and children as her subjects. One specific collection called \"The Four Seasons\" was intended to be carried out by John Gibson; however, he was unavailable for the commission and referred Thornycroft for the job. Her work on the \"Four Seasons\" collection launched her career as an artist. Through this opportunity she became a significant commissioner for the Royal Collection from years 1844 to 1877. === The Four Seasons === * Victoria (1840-1901), Princess Royal as 'Summer' c.1850-70 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/25/collection/53263/victoria-1840-1901-princess- royal-as-summer * Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (1841-1910) as 'Winter' c. 1850 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/28/collection/53090/albert- edward-prince-of-wales-1841-1910-as-winter * Prince Alfred (1844-1900) as 'Autumn' c.1847 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/13/collection/34682/prince- alfred-1844-1900-as-autumn * Victoria (1840-1901), Princess Royal, as 'Summer' signed & dated 1847 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/14/collection/1565/victoria-1840-1901-princess- royal-as-summer * Albert Edward (1841-1910), Prince of Wales, as 'Winter'. c.1847 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/16/collection/1567/albert- edward-1841-1910-prince-of-wales-as-winter * Prince Alfred (1844-1900) as 'Autumn' 1847 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/15/collection/1566/prince- alfred-1844-1900-as-autumn * Princess Alice (1843-1878) as 'Spring' c.1850-70 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/47/collection/53097/princess- alice-1843-1878-as-spring === Primary Style === Mary Thornycroft's primary artistic practice was sculpture. Three main categories of her practice were busts, fragments, and full body compositions. The materials she specialized with were marble and sometimes bronze. Thornycroft's style was naturalistic and she could execute the age of the subject very well. The details that she accomplished in her sculptures actively displayed personalized expressions of each subject she sculpted. Due to her being a woman her commissions were limited therefore, she capitalized on her craft on subjects that were easily reachable for her to study these subjects being infants and children. This was an advantage because this is how she gained these notable commissions. She was well known for her commission of Four Seasons as well as, her sculpture Skipping Girl and Skipping Rope. Her fragment sculptures are interesting and were requested upon Queen Victoria. These fragments were to capture the likeness and act of souvenirs of her children. These are interesting due to them being made of marble, which is associated with funerary ideas, however none of Queen Victoria\u2019s children died. The details that she accomplished in her sculptures actively displayed personalized expressions of each subject she sculpted. Her style of each sculpture evoke \"ideal\" figures. === Busts === * Prince Alfred: https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/30/collection/2112/prince- alfred-1844-1900 * Alexandria, Princess of Wales: https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/21/collection/2094/alexandra-princess- of-wales-1844-1925 * -Princess Alice https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/9/collection/2086/princess- alice-1843-1878-0 * -Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna, Duchess of Edinburgh: https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/3/collection/2092/grand-duchess-marie- alexandrovna-duchess-of-edinburgh-1853-1920 * -Albert, Duke of Schleswig- Holstein: https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/44/collection/2101/albert- duke-of-schleswig-holstein-1869-1931 * -Princess Helena: https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/53/collection/41292/princess- helena-1846-1923 * -Princess Louise: https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/54/collection/41293/princess- louise-1848-1939 === Fragments === * -Leg and Foot of Prince Alfred : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/5/collection/42012/leg-and-foot-of- prince-alfred * -Princess Helena : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/8/collection/42014/princess- helena-1846-1923 * -Princess Beatrice : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/6/collection/55236/princess- beatrice-1857-1944 * -Left arm and Hand of Princess Louise : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/2/collection/34578/left-arm-and-hand-of- princess-louise * -Prince Leopold : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/10/collection/34357/prince- leopold-1853-1884 * -Prince Alfred : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/58/collection/34581/prince- alfred-1844-1900 === Full Body Compositions === * Victoria (1868-1935) and Maud (1869-1938) of Wales signed & dated 1877 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/61/collection/2073/victoria-1868-1935-and- maud-1869-1938-of-wales * Louise of Wales (1867-1931) signed & dated 1877 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/60/collection/2072/louise-of- wales-1867-1931 * Princess Louise (1848-1939) as 'Plenty' c.1853-70 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/51/collection/53089/princess- louise-1848-1939-as-plenty * Princess Helena (1846-1923) as 'Peace' c.1850-70 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/46/collection/53096/princess- helena-1846-1923-as-peace * Prince Arthur (1850-1942) as a Hunter. c.1850-70 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/48/collection/53098/prince- arthur-1850-1942-as-a-hunter * Prince Leopold (1853-1884) as a Fisher Boy c.1860 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/44/collection/53088/prince- leopold-1853-1884-as-a-fisher-boy * Prince Leopold (1853-1884) as a Fisher Boy c.1858-60 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/42/collection/41290/prince- leopold-1853-1884-as-a-fisher-boy * Prince Arthur (1850-1942) as a Hunter 1859 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/41/collection/41285/prince- arthur-1850-1942-as-a-hunter * Princess Beatrice (1857-1944) in the Nautilus Shell signed & dated 1858 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/38/collection/41291/princess- beatrice-1857-1944-in-the-nautilus-shell * Princess Helena (1846-1923) as 'Peace' signed & dated 1856 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/34/collection/41295/princess- helena-1846-1923-as-peace * Princess Helena (1846-1923) as 'Peace' signed & dated 1857 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/35/collection/2170/princess- helena-1846-1923-as-peace * Princess Louise (1848-1939) as 'Plenty' signed & dated 1857 : https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/36/collection/2171/princess- louise-1848-1939-as-plenty ==Notes== ==External links== * ;Attribution Category:1809 births Category:1895 deaths Mary Category:19th-century British sculptors ",
