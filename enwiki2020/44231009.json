    "text": "Lecidea laboriosa is a species of lichen that grows inside solid rock (endolithic), with only the small black disc-like fruiting bodies (apothecia) visible above the rock surface.Field Guide to California Lichens, Stephen Sharnoff, Yale University Press, 2014, Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert Region. Vol 2, Nash, T.H., Ryan, B.D., Gries, C., Bugartz, F., (eds.) 2001, Unlike other members of the genus Lecidea, the apothecia are not lecideine in that they either lack black margins (exciples) or have gray vertically striated margins. It grows all over the world in all climates. It might be the most common endolithic lichen in California. It is similar in appearance to Catillaria lenticularis, Polyspora simplex, and Sarcogyne clavus. It is negative to lichen spot tests, K-, P-, C-. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Fungi described in 1874 Category:Lichens Category:Lecanoromycetes Category:Fungi of the United States ",
