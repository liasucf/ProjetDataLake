Along with St. Mary\u2019s hospital that was designated as a U.S. Army General Hospital, the City Hospital\u2019s first major challenge was the treatment of 448 Union soldiers in the next two years. In the post-war years, the Hospital rapidly grew, embracing the advancement of medical technology, and becoming a leader in surgery and nursing. The Rochester City Hospital School of Nursing was established in 1880 and became the 12th nursing training program in the nation and the 3rd in New York State. Many graduates from the school would later have distinguished careers in nursing and as administrators and physicians. Rochester City Hospital in 1864. To reflect its all-encompassing mission, the hospital\u2019s name changed to Rochester General Hospital in 1911. In the early years of the twentieth-century members of the medical staff responded to the Spanish influenza epidemic of 1918-1919 and became the nucleus of the organized military hospitals, Base Hospital 19 in the First World War and the 19th General Hospital later on in Second World War. The post Second World War years reflected a period of rapid growth and technological advancement. The hospital led the region by opening the first Premature Infant Nursery in Western New York in 1951. The absence of a hospital in the northern sections of the city prompted the establishment in 1956 of the new Rochester General Hospital Northside campus on Portland Avenue. While maintaining both the new \u201cNorthside\u201d campus and the original, now designated \u201cWestside\u201d campus, the hospital continued to embrace the leading advancements in medical technology. The Westside campus closed in 1966 leaving Northside as the Rochester General Hospital. The forerunner to the present Rochester Heart Institute, the Cardio- Pulmonary Laboratory opened in 1959 and installed the first pacemaker in 1963 closely followed by the first open-heart surgery the following year. Through the 1970s and 1980s the hospital continued to expand to serve the needs of the community. In response to evolving health care industry in 1984, Rochester General Hospital, along with its affiliates, combined with the Genesee Hospital, Newark-Wayne Community Hospital, and the Continuing Care Network to form the Greater Rochester Health system (GRHS.) In 1997 the Rochester General Hospital celebrated its 150th anniversary. This year also saw the system change its name to ViaHealth, which comprised the Rochester General Hospital, The Genesee Hospital, Newark-Wayne Community Hospital, The Behavioral Health Network and the Continuing Care network of long-term care providers. The organization again changed its branding name from Viahealth to the Rochester General Health System in 2008 to closer reflect its long history of commitment and service to the Rochester community. ==Services== * Bariatric Surgery * Breast Center * Cancer * Cardiology * Cardiothoracic Surgery * Childbirth * Dentistry * Emergency Medicine * Joint Replacement * Ophthalmology * Pediatrics * Residency Training Programs * Stroke Center ==Facilities and current operations== Rochester General Hospital has 528 beds and is served by more than 1,500 medical and dental staff members and more than 7,500 employees.
