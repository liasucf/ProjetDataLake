    "text": "The 1981 Arizona Wildcats football team represented the University of Arizona in the Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10) during the 1981 NCAA Division I-A football season. In their second season under head coach Larry Smith, the Wildcats compiled a 6\u20135 record (4\u20134 against Pac-10 opponents), finished in a tie for sixth place in the Pac-10, and outscored their opponents, 253 to 205. The team played its home games in Arizona Stadium in Tucson, Arizona. A memorable highlight of the season occurred in October when Arizona upset #1 USC, which was Arizona\u2019s first win over a top-ranked opponent in school history. It was also the Wildcats\u2019 first win over the Trojans in program history. Losses to UCLA and Arizona State may have prevented the Wildcats from going to a bowl game. The team's statistical leaders included Tom Tunnicliffe with 1,420 passing yards, Vance Johnson with 654 rushing yards, and Bob Carter with 427 receiving yards. Linebacker Ricky Hunley led the team with 121 total tackles.2016 Media Guide, p. 86. ==Schedule== ==Game summaries== ===at USC=== Arizona upset top-ranked USC for their biggest win since joining the Pac-10 in 1978. ===Arizona State=== Arizona lost to ASU yet again, perhaps denying the Wildcats a chance to earn a bowl bid. ==Season notes== *Arizona returned to wearing white helmets and blue jerseys at home full-time.
