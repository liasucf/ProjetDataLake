    "text": "The Lao Wiang (, ), sometimes also referred to as Lao Wieng, are a Tai sub- ethnic group of the Isan region. Approximately 50,000Joshua Project - Lao Wieng Ethnic People in all Countries self-proclaimed Lao Wiang live in villages throughout Thailand, especially the provinces of Prachinburi, Udon Thani, Nakhon Pathom, Chai Nat, Lopburi, Saraburi, Phetchaburi, and Roi Et with a significant number in Bangkok. ==Alternate names== The Lao Wiang are also referred to as Tai Wiang (\u0e44\u0e17\u0e40\u0e27\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07), Lao Vientiane (\u0e25\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e27\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e19\u0e4c), Tai Vientiane (\u0e44\u0e17\u0e40\u0e27\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e19\u0e4c) or simply as Wiang (\u0e40\u0e27\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07). These names are also used in Laos to refer to the inhabitants of Vientiane or its descendants in Thailand. Many who are in fact Lao Wiang may only consider themselves Isan or Lao. ==History== The Lao Wiang, as their name suggests, are descendants of Lao people from the Vientiane (Wiang Chan) region (Thai: \u0e40\u0e27\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e19\u0e4c) in modern- day Laos. After the fall of Lanxang, the three successor kingdoms were overrun by Siam and forced population transfers by the Siamese into Isan were undertaken. Much of Isan was settled this way, and is one of the main reasons for the shared Lao culture of Laos and Isan.Setthakan, Krasuand. (1930). Siam: Nature and Industry. Bangkok: Bangkok Times Press, Ltd. Originally slaves and forced into providing corv\u00e9e labour, the Lao Wiang were freed and integrated into the general Isan population. ==Culture== The Lao Wiang are a sub-group of the general Isan (ethnic Lao of northeastern Thailand) distinguished from other Isan people by the location of their ancestors. Most have assumed either Thai or Isan identity, but some maintain their distinctiveness. Like their neighbours, they share Theravada Buddhism, Isan language, and rice farming, with only slight differences in traditional clothing and dialect.Hattaway, Paul. (2004).
