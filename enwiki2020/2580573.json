    "text": "Trebizon is a series of school story novels by Anne Digby set in the fictional school of that name. The fourteen novels were published between 1978 and 1994. Like Enid Blyton's much earlier creation, Malory Towers, Trebizon is located in Cornwall. The novels follow the protagonist Rebecca Mason from when she joins the school in the second form through to the end of her fifth year. A major theme throughout the series is Rebecca's burgeoning talent for tennis. Other major characters include Rebecca's two best friends, Tish Anderson and Susan Murdoch, and her boyfriend Robbie Anderson. The series is now being reprinted by Egmont, with illustrations from Lucy Truman. The first seven books were published in 2016, with more to come in 2017. Additionally, all fourteen titles are widely available as ebooks. ==Series details== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Book!!Title!!Publisher!!Date!!ISBN |- !1 |First Term at Trebizon||rowspan=\"3\"|W. H.
