    "text": "The 2020\u201321 UEFA Futsal Champions League will be the 35th edition of Europe's premier club futsal tournament, and the 20th edition organized by UEFA. It will also be the third edition since the tournament was rebranded from \"UEFA Futsal Cup\" to \"UEFA Futsal Champions League\". The final tournament will be held at the Minsk Arena in Minsk, Belarus. The venue was originally appointed to host the 2020 final tournament, but on 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee chose to relocate the 2020 finals to Palau Blaugrana, Barcelona, Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, and Minsk will instead host the following season's finals in April 2021. Due to the continuing pandemic in Europe, the format of the competition was changed, with all qualifying matches played as single leg matches, and the final tournament consisting of eight instead of four teams. Barcelona are the defending champions. ==Association team allocation== The association ranking based on the UEFA futsal national team coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association: *The top three-ranked associations can enter two teams. *The winners of the 2019\u201320 UEFA Futsal Champions League qualify automatically, and thus their association can also enter a second team. If they are from the top three-ranked associations, the fourth-ranked association can also enter two teams. *All other associations can enter one team (the winners of their regular top domestic futsal league, or in special circumstances, the runners- up). For this season, the top three-ranked associations, Spain, Portugal and Russia, can enter two teams. As the title holders are from Spain, the fourth- ranked association, Kazakhstan, can also enter two teams. ===Distribution=== Teams are ranked according to their UEFA futsal club coefficients, computed based on results of the last three seasons, to decide on the round they enter, as well as their seeding in draws. The following is the access list for this season under the revised format. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Access list for 2020\u201321 UEFA Futsal Champions League |- ! !Teams entering in this round !Teams advancing from previous round |- !Preliminary round (46 teams) | *46 teams ranked 9\u201354 | |- !Round of 32 (32 teams) | *Title holders *8 teams ranked 1\u20138 | *23 winners from preliminary round |- !Round of 16 (16 teams) | | *16 winners from round of 32 |- !Final tournament (8 teams) | | *8 winners from round of 16 |} ===Teams=== In early April 2020, UEFA announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the deadline for entering the tournament had been postponed until further notice. A total of 55 teams from 51 of the 55 UEFA member associations participate in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Futsal Champions League. All teams in italics are declared champions or selected to play by the national association following an abandoned season due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, and are subject to approval by UEFA as per the guidelines for entry to European competitions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ;Legend *TH: Title holders {| |+Qualified teams for 2020\u201321 UEFA Futsal Champions League |-valign=top | {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Teams entering round of 32 |- !Rank !width=190|Association !width=200|Team ! |- !TH | |Barcelona |align=right|69.001 |- !1 | |Inter FS |align=right|60.667 |- !2 | |Sporting CP |align=right|57.999 |- !3 | |Kairat |align=right|35.667 |- !4 | |Benfica |align=right|33.332 |- !5 | |KPRF |align=right|24.000 |- !6 | |Gazprom-Ugra Yugorsk |align=right|20.333 |- !7 | |Aktobe |align=right|16.000 |- !8 | |Dobovec |align=right|14.501 |} | {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Teams entering preliminary round |- !Rank !width=150|Association !width=200|Team ! |- !9 | |Pesaro |align=right|14.167 |- !10 | |Prodexim Kherson |align=right|14.000 |- !11 | |Rekord Bielsko-Bia\u0142a |align=right|10.502 |- !12 | |Chrudim |align=right|10.333 |- !13 | |Vytis |align=right|7.749 |- !14 | |Leo |align=right|7.500 |- !15 | |Araz Nax\u00e7ivan |align=right|6.999 |- !16 | |Olmissum |align=right|6.834 |- !17 | |MVFC Beretty\u00f3\u00fajfalu |align=right|6.500 |- !18 | |Charleroi |align=right|6.000 |- !19 | |Viten Orsha |align=right|5.501 |- !20 | |Luxol St Andrews |align=right|5.167 |- !21 | |MIMEL Lu\u010denec |align=right|4.916 |- !22 | |Red Star Belgrade |align=right|4.667 |- !23 | |Hovocubo |align=right|4.667 |- !24 | |Hohenstein- Ernstthal |align=right|3.833 |- !25 | |Shkupi |align=right|3.833 |- !26 | |United Gala\u0163i |align=right|3.667 |- !27 | |Minerva |align=right|3.376 |- !28 | |Salines |align=right|2.834 |- !29 | |Omonia |align=right|2.417 |- !30 | |Prishtina |align=right|2.334 |- !31 | |Helvecia |align=right|2.168 |- !32 | |ACCS |align=right|2.084 |- !33 | |Gentofte |align=right|2.084 |- !34 | |Tbilisi State University |align=right|2.000 |- !35 | |Allstars |align=right|2.000 |- !36 | |Hammarby IF |align=right|1.667 |- !37 | |Petrow |align=right|1.667 |- !38 | |Viimsi Smsraha |align=right|1.583 |- !39 | |Akaa |align=right|1.333 |- !40 | |Titograd |align=right|1.167 |- !41 | |Lynx |align=right|1.001 |- !42 | |AEK |align=right|0.750 |- !43 | |Tirana |align=right|0.750 |- !44 | |Piyalepa\u015fa |align=right|0.667 |- !45 | |Utleira |align=right|0.667 |- !46 | |Ashdod Dolphins |align=right|0.583 |- !47 | |Differdange 03 |align=right|0.583 |- !48 | |Blue Magic |align=right|0.583 |- !49 | |Cherno More |align=right|0.500 |- !50 | |PYF Saltires |align=right|0.500 |- !51 | |Swansea University |align=right|0.250 |- !52 | |Encamp |align=right|0.250 |- !53 | |Fiorentino |align=right|0.084 |- !54 | |Rosario |align=right|0.000 |} |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Associations which did not enter |- | | | | |} ;Notes ==Schedule== The schedule of the competition is as follows (all draws are held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).
