    "text": "Research Synthesis Methods is a quarterly peer-reviewed multidisciplinary scientific journal covering all aspects of research methods as they have been applied to research synthesis. It was established in 2010 and is published by John Wiley & Sons on behalf of the Society for Research Synthesis Methodology, of which it is the official journal. The founding editors-in-chief were Christopher Schmid (Brown University) and Mark Lipsey (Vanderbilt University), and the current ones are Gerta R\u00fccker (Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg) (Germany) and Ian Shrier (Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research). According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2017 impact factor of 3.218, ranking it 7th out of 59 journals in the category \"Mathematical & Computational Biology\" and 14th out of 64 journals in the category \"Multidisciplinary Sciences\". Despite the journal's stated inclusive disciplinary scope, commentators have noted that articles published in the journal tend to be focused on quantitative forms of research synthesis, such as meta-analysis, and to adopt a positivist perspective on the practice of research synthesis. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Publications established in 2010 Category:Wiley (publisher) academic journals Category:Quarterly journals Category:Research methods journals Category:Multidisciplinary scientific journals Category:English-language journals Category:Statistics journals Category:Academic journals associated with international learned and professional societies ",
