    "text": "Diamond Head is a volcanic tuff cone on the Hawaiian island of Oahu and known to Hawaiians as L\u0113ahi. The Hawaiian name is most likely derived from lae (browridge, promontory) plus ahi (tuna) because the shape of the ridgeline resembles the shape of a tuna's dorsal fin.Mary Kawena Pukui, Samuel H. Elbert, Esther K. Mookini, eds. (1964). Place Names of Hawaii, revised and expanded edition. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. . Its English name was given by British sailors in the 19th century, who mistook calcite crystals on the adjacent beach for diamonds. == Geology == Diamond Head is part of the system of cones, vents, and their associated eruption flows that are collectively known to geologists as the Honolulu Volcanic Series, eruptions from the Koolau Volcano that took place long after the volcano formed and had gone dormant. These eruptive events created many of Oahu's well-known landmarks, including Punchbowl Crater, Hanauma Bay, Koko Head, and M\u0101nana Island in addition to Diamond Head. Diamond Head, like the rest of the Honolulu Volcanic Series, is much younger than the main mass of the Koolau Mountain Range. While the Koolau Range is about 2.6 million years old, Diamond Head is estimated to be about 500,000 to 400,000 years old. pillbox at the peak (middle) == History == Known as L\u0113\u02bbahi in Hawaiian, the mountain in 1825 was given the name Diamond Hill by British sailors who discovered sparkling volcanic calcite crystals in the sand and mistook them for diamonds. This is reflected in another local name, Kaimana Hila. The name later became Diamond Head, with head being shortened from headland. The interior and adjacent exterior areas were the home to Fort Ruger, the first United States military reservation on Hawaii. Alt URL Only Battery 407, a National Guard emergency operations center, and Birkhimer Tunnel, the Hawaii State Civil Defense Headquarters (HI-EMA), remain in use in the crater. An FAA air traffic control center was in operation from 1963 to 2007.FAA presence inside Diamond Head vanishes, Suzanne Roig, Honolulu Advertiser, September 28, 2001. == Tourism == Diamond Head is a defining feature of the view known to residents and tourists of Waik\u012bk\u012b, and also a U.S. National Natural Monument. The volcanic tuff cone is a State Monument. While part of it is closed to the public and serves as a platform for antennas used by the U.S. government, the crater's proximity to Honolulu's resort hotels and beaches makes the rest of it a popular destination. == National Natural Landmark == In 1968, Diamond Head was declared a National Natural Landmark. The crater, also called Diamond Head Lookout, was used as a strategic military lookout in the early 1900s. Spanning over 475 acres (190 ha) (including the crater's interior and outer slopes), it served as an effective defensive lookout because it provides panoramic views of Waik\u012bk\u012b and the south shore of Oahu. The Diamond Head Lighthouse, a navigational lighthouse built in 1917 is directly adjacent to the crater's slopes. In addition, a few pillboxes are located on Diamond Head's summit. == In popular culture == Diamond Head appears on an 80-cent air mail stamp issued in 1952 to pay for shipping orchids to the mainland of the U.S.US Airmail Stamps 1941-1961 A 1975 televised game show, The Diamond Head Game was set at Diamond Head.\"The Diamond Head Game\" (1975) The Crater was the location of several concerts in the 1960s and 1970s. First held on New Year's Day, 1969, and often known as Hawaiian Woodstock, Diamond Head Crater Festivals, sometimes called Sunshine Festivals, were all-day music celebrations held in the '60's & '70's attracting over 75,000 in attendance for performances of the Grateful Dead, Santana, America, Styx, Journey, War, and Tower of Power, alongside Hawaii talent like Cecilio & Kapono and the Mackey Feary Band. These one day festivals became two day events in 1976 and 1977, but were cancelled by the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources because of community noise and environmental impact concerns. Many items from the bands were brought into and out of the Crater by helicopter.
