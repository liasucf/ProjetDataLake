    "text": "Wagner College Stadium is a 3,500-seat multi-purpose stadium located on the campus of Wagner College in Staten Island, New York. Opened in 1967, the stadium is used for football, men's lacrosse, women's lacrosse, and track & field. Hameline Field has 400 premium seat back chairs located at midfield. Below the stadium is a field house featuring several locker rooms, a training room, an equipment room, and public facilities. Surrounding the field is a six-lane synthetic track, allowing the college to play host to many major track & field events. The stadium was renovated as part of a $13 million addition to the campus facilities in 1998. In 2006, the stadium's natural grass field was replaced with state-of-the-art FieldTurf, a synthetic grass playing surface. In 2012, the playing surface was named Hameline Field in honor of long-time athletic director and head football coach Walt Hameline. In 2013, lights were added to the stadium, and the football and women's soccer teams played home night games for the first time. ==See also== * List of NCAA Division I FCS football stadiums ==References== ==External links== *Wagner College Stadium Category:American football venues in New York City Category:Athletics (track and field) venues in New York City Category:College football venues Category:College lacrosse venues in the United States Category:College track and field venues in the United States Category:College soccer venues in the United States Category:Lacrosse venues in New York (state) Category:Multi-purpose stadiums in the United States Category:Soccer venues in New York City Category:Sports venues in Staten Island Category:Sports venues completed in 1967 Category:1998 Goodwill Games venues Category:1967 establishments in New York (state) ",
