It was hosted by Katy Perry. The 34th annual award show aired live from the venue for the second time in its history. The music video for Taylor Swift's song \"Look What You Made Me Do\" premiered during the broadcast. Lil Yachty co-hosted the pre-show with Terrence J, Charlamagne Tha God, and MTV News' Gaby Wilson, while Gabbie Hanna hosted backstage for the show.http://www.mtv.com/news/3029686/mtv-vmas-2017-everything-need-to-know/ It was broadcast across various Viacom networks and their related apps. Compared to the previous year, viewership was down from 6.5 million to 5.68 million viewers, making it the lowest viewed show since 1994. A combination of having to compete with the season finale of HBO's Game of Thrones, which drew over 12.07 million viewers, and the ability to now stream the award show online is said to account for the drop in viewership. ==Performances== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+ List of musical performances |- ! scope=\"col\" | Artist(s) ! scope=\"col\" | Song(s) |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Pre-show |- |Cardi B |\"Bodak Yellow\" |- |Bleachers |\"Don't Take the Money\" |- |Khalid |\"Location\" \"Young Dumb & Broke\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Main show |- |Kendrick Lamar |\"DNA\" \"Humble\" |- |Ed Sheeran Lil Uzi Vert |\"Shape of You\" \"XO Tour Llif3\" |- |Julia Michaels |\"Issues\" |- |Shawn Mendes |\"There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back\" |- |Lorde |\"Homemade Dynamite\" |- |Fifth Harmony Gucci Mane |\"Angel\" \"Down\" |- |Miley Cyrus |\"Younger Now\" |- |Demi Lovato |\"Sorry Not Sorry\" (Pre-Taped from the Palms Casino in Las Vegas) |- |Pink |Medley \"Get the Party Started\" \"Raise Your Glass\" \"So What\" \"Fuckin' Perfect\" \"Just Give Me a Reason\" \"Don't Let Me Get Me\" \"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\" \"What About Us\" |- |Kyle |\"iSpy\" |- |James Arthur |\"Say You Won't Let Go\" (Part of a Commercial) |- |Alessia Cara |\"Scars to Your Beautiful\" |- |Logic Khalid Alessia Cara |\"1-800-273-8255\" |- |Thirty Seconds to Mars Travis Scott |\"Walk on Water\" \"Butterfly Effect\" |- |Rod Stewart DNCE |\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" (Pre-Taped from the Palms Casino in Las Vegas) |- |Katy Perry Nicki Minaj |\"Swish Swish\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" | After-show (only web) |- |Demi Lovato |\"Cool for the Summer\" |- |} Source:https://twitter.com/s/status/899693982619377665https://twitter.com/s/status/900432787349438464http://www.mtv.com/news/3032003/demi- lovato-dnce-rod-stewart-perform--s/http://www.mtv.com/news/3032195/alessia- cara-kyle-perform--s/ ==Appearances== ===Pre-show=== * Gaby Wilson \u2014 announced the winners of Best Choreography and Song of the Summer ===Main show=== * Jack McBrayer, Buzz Aldrin, Peggy Whitson, Abbi Jacobson, Kathryn Hahn and Kevin Bacon \u2014 appeared in a skit with host Katy Perry * Paris Jackson \u2014 presented Best Pop Video * Hailee Steinfeld \u2014 introduced Julia Michaels * Yara Shahidi \u2014 introduced Shawn Mendes * Jack Antonoff and Alessandra Ambrosio \u2014 introduced Lorde * Teyana Taylor and Pete Wentz \u2014 presented Best Dance Video * Fred Armisen \u2014 appeared in a skit with host Katy Perry * DJ Khaled \u2014 introduced Fifth Harmony * Ludacris and Olivia Munn \u2014 presented Best Collaboration * Jared Leto \u2014 paid tribute to Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell and introduced a clip of Linkin Park's 2010 VMA performance * Billy Eichner \u2014 appeared in a skit with host Katy Perry * Pete Davidson and Tiffany Haddish \u2014 presented Best Hip Hop Video * Cardi B \u2014 introduced Demi Lovato * Ellen DeGeneres \u2014 presented the Video Vanguard Award * Millie Bobby Brown \u2014 presented Artist of the Year * Vanessa Hudgens \u2014 introduced Alessia Cara * Kesha \u2014 introduced Logic, Khalid and Alessia Cara * Bebe Rexha and The Chainsmokers \u2014 presented Best New Artist * Lil Yachty \u2014 introduced Thirty Seconds to Mars * Rev.
