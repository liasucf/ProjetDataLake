Cash coins were introduced to Japan in the century inspired by the Chinese Kaigen Ts\u016bh\u014d (\u958b\u5143\u901a\u5bf3) cash coins from the Tang dynasty. Chinese cash coins also circulated in other countries and inspired similar currencies such as the Korean mun, Ryukyuan mon, Vietnamese v\u0103n, while they also circulated as far south as Indonesia. Because these currencies were so similar cash coins around the Far East were interchangeable and Japanese cash coins circulated in other countries while foreign cash coins also circulated in Japan.Cocolog \u96d1\u8a18\uff20\u53f2\u83ef\u5802 \u300c\u4e2d\u5c71\u901a\u5b9d\u300d\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u3002 (in Japanese) Published: 8 February 2013 Retrieved: 9 June 2017. The first Japanese cash coins were the Wad\u014dkaichin (\u548c\u540c\u958b\u73ce) which were produced from 29 August 708..Brown, Delmer et al. (1979). Gukansh\u014d, p. 271,Varley, H. Paul. (1980). Jinn\u014d Sh\u014dt\u014dki. p. 140. In 760 Japanese currency was reformed and gold and silver cash coins were introduced, however by the end of the 10th century the value of Japanese coinage had severely fallen combined with a weak central government lead the Japanese to return to barter. From the 12th century onwards the Japanese started importing Chinese currency again even while the Southern Song dynasty banned the export of its coinage, while the import of Chinese cash coins surged again during the Ming dynasty era when large amounts of Ming Chinese cash coins were imported. The Japanese started locally imitating Chinese cash coins, which were known as Shich\u016bsen (\u79c1\u92f3\u92ad). But the quality of these cash coins varied severely depending on the mint. As many cash coins circulated in the market for a long time their quality diminished over time becoming known as Bitasen (\u941a\u92ad, \"bad metal money\").Masuo Tomifusa, Honpou bitasen zufu, (Anasendou 1982). (in Japanese) After the Tokugawa shogunate banned Bitasen in 1608 they started producing their own coinage and after 1859 provincial authorities were allowed to mint their own coinages. Japanese cash coins were officially demonetised in 1891 after officially circulating as a division of the Japanese yen with an exchange rate of 10.000 mon for 1 yen.Aila de la Rive, \u00a9 MoneyMuseum Money in the Land of the Rising Sun I: The Copper Coins of Ancient Japan.

An entry of the Nihon Shoki dated April 15, 683 mentions: \"From now on, copper coins should be used, but silver coins should not be used\", which is thought to order the adoption of the Tomimotosen copper coins. The first official cash coinage was struck in 708. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Inscription !! Kanji !!

It was exemplified by the adoption of Japan's first official coin type, the Wad\u014dkaichin.The Cambridge history of Japan: Heian Japan John Whitney Hall, Donald H.

It was first minted in 708 CE on order of Empress Genmei, Japan's 43rd Imperial ruler. \"Wad\u014dkaichin\" is the reading of the four characters printed on the coin, and is thought to be composed of the era name Wad\u014d (\u548c\u9285, \"Japanese copper\"), which could alternatively mean \"happiness\", and \"Kaichin\", thought to be related to \"Currency\". {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

By the middle of the 9th century, the value of a coin in rice had fallen to 1/150th of its value of the early 8th century. By the end of the 10th century, compounded with weaknesses in the political system, this led to the abandonment of the national currency, with the return to rice as a currency medium. The last official Japanese coin emission occurred in 958, with very low quality coins called Kangen Daih\u014d (\u4e7e\u5143\u5927\u5bf6), which soon fell into disuse. The last K\u014dch\u014dsen coins produced after the Wad\u014dkaichin was debased include: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Inscription !! Ky\u016bjitai !! Shinjitai !!
