    "text": "\"How Many Times\" is the third single by DJ Khaled, featuring Chris Brown, Lil Wayne and Big Sean from Khaled's eighth studio album I Changed a Lot. It was released on May 12, 2015, as the third single from Khaled's eighth studio album, I Changed a Lot (2015). ==Music video== A music video for the song was released on May 11, 2015. This video was famously known for featuring Khaled saying \"Another one!\" when demanding another kiss from a woman in the video. Ace Hood makes a cameo. This quote would then quickly evolve into a meme and has since then been featured in many of Khaled's later singles, most notably For Free, which features Canadian entertainer Drake, and in Do You Mind, which features Nicki Minaj, Chris Brown, August Alsina, Jeremih, Future, and Rick Ross. ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !
