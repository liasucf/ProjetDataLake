    "text": "Jerry Lee Wells (January 18, 1944 \u2013 May 26, 2014) was an American professional basketball player. He played at Ralph Bunche High School in his hometown of Glasgow, Kentucky, and committed to play for the Oklahoma City Chiefs alongside high school teammate Charlie Hunter as the first two African- Americans to play for the Chiefs basketball team. Wells' scoring ability helped take the Stars to three consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances. He led the Chiefs in scoring during his junior and senior seasons. Chiefs head coach Abe Lemons stated that, \"for his size, [Wells was] as good as a player I've had in 10 years at OCU\" and \"an All-American if there ever was one\". Wells was selected by the Cincinnati Royals as the 16th overall pick in the 1966 NBA draft but he never played in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1966. Wells played for the Muskegon Panthers of the North American Basketball League (NABL) from 1966 until the team folded five games into the 1967\u201368 season. Wells was inducted into the Oklahoma City Stars Hall of Fame in 1986. ==References== ==External links== *College statistics Category:1944 births Category:2014 deaths Category:African-American basketball players Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Kentucky Category:Cincinnati Royals draft picks Category:Guards (basketball) Category:Oklahoma City Stars men's basketball players Category:People from Glasgow, Kentucky ",
