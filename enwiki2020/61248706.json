    "text": "Paolo Piccione (born 24 April 1964) is an Italian mathematician working in differential geometry, Riemannian geometry and analysis. He is professor at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo since 1996 and president of the Brazilian Mathematical Society since 2017. == Biography == Piccione was born in Rome on April 24, 1964, in a genuinely Italian family \u2013 his paternal grandfather was from Sicily; and the maternal one of central Italy \u2013 of a social class \"without any particular prominence\", although he enjoyed the important advances of Italian society in the postwar period, Piccione achieved an education in high-level public schools. Like his parents, three decades before him, he graduated from the same Sapienza University of Rome, in Rome, where he obtained Laurea in Matematica and Master degree in 1987 supervisor by Alessandro Fig\u00e0 Talamanca. He received his a PhD in Mathematics degree from the Pennsylvania State University in 1994 advisor by Adrian Ocneanu. He is currently a full professor at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, where he teaches since 1996 and completed his livre doc\u00eancia (Doctor of Law's USP). == Work == He has experience in mathematics, with emphasis on differential geometry, working mainly on the following topics: calculus of variations and variational geometric problems, Riemannian and global Lorentzian geometry, Morse theory, symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian systems. Piccione develops research that deals with topics with possible applications to physics. The main results achieved in the area of Lorentzian geometry have an interpretation within General Relativity. ==Awards and honors== * Brazilian Academy of Sciences, Member (2012) * Brazilian Mathematical Society, President (2017-) * National Order of Scientific Merit, Commander (2018) == Selected publications == * jointly with GIAMBO, R. ; MAGLI, G. , \"Naked Singularities Formation in the Gravitational Collapse of Barotropic Spherical Fluids.\".
