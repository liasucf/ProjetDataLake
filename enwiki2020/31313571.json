At age eleven he branched out to play drums, bass, guitar and sax. At age eighteen he attended the prestigious CIAM School of Music in Bordeaux, France. == Career == After graduating, dbClifford played in a British band where he met the fellow musician with whom he recorded his first demo album in 2000, Supernova. After a short stint in L.A, he moved to Victoria, British Columbia, where he settled. The death of his mother saw him move back to France in 2003. By January 2004 he had written ten songs in his father\u2019s house in the P\u00e9rigord region. Shortly thereafter he returned to Victoria where he recorded the album. He produced and played all of the instruments on the album Recyclable, including piano, drums, bass, guitar, vocals and backing vocals. The Vancouver Sun described the album as having \"a bit of R&B;, a lot of happy piano pop, and even a taste of funk\". The Province called it \"optimistic, catchy stuff\". The single \"Simple Things\" was a number- one hit in Japan. The second single from the album was \"Don't Wanna\". By the end of 2005 he signed with Nettwerk Management and Nettwerk One (Publishing).
