    "text": "The sulfur oxoacids are chemical compounds that contain sulfur, oxygen, and hydrogen. The best known and most important industrially used is sulfuric acid. Sulfur has several oxoacids; however, some of these are known only from their salts (these are shown in italics in the table below). The acids that have been characterised contain a variety of structural features, for example: *tetrahedral sulfur when coordinated to oxygen *terminal and bridging oxygen atoms *terminal peroxo groups *terminal S=S *chains of (\u2212S\u2212)n {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
