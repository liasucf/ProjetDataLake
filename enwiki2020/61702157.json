She wrote three other mystery novels and contributed short stories to anthologies and periodicals, including Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. Her novels are set in Mexico and feature characters who suffer from a sense of isolation, according to Jane S. Bakerman in Twentieth Century Crime and Mystery Writers. Bakerman describes Blanc as \"a good writer whose canon, though slender, is strong.\" Of The Green Stone, Kirkus Reviews said, \"Atmosphere, incidents and personalities persuasively combined.\" ==Bibliography== * The Green Stone (1961) * The Yellow Villa (1964) * The Rose Window (1967) * The Sea Troll (1969) ==References== Category:1915 births Category:1999 deaths Category:20th-century American women writers Category:American mystery writers Category:Grand Prix de Litt\u00e9rature Polici\u00e8re winners Category:Edgar Award winners ",
