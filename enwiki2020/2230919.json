    "text": "is a Japanese animated television series co-produced by Tsuburaya Production and Tokyo Broadcasting System. The series aired on TBS Television affiliates on the Wednesday 7:00 PM time slot from April 4, 1979 to March 26, 1980, lasting a total of 50 episodes. It was the eighth installment in the Ultra Series and began airing four years after the end of Ultraman Leo. The show was the first animated incarnation of Tsuburaya's iconic superhero Ultraman, as well as one of the earliest works of anime studio Nippon Sunrise (now known simply as Sunrise), who also worked on their now-iconic mecha series Mobile Suit Gundam during the same year. ==Story== In the 21st century, various mysterious events occur on Earth, causing monsters to appear all of a sudden. EGG3 officer Ch\u014dichir\u014d Hikari was scouted to join the Science Guard on Earth but while on his way back, he was bonded to Ultraman Joneus, an Ultra Person of U40 who was sent by his brethren to fight against the monster threats and alien invasions. This allows the youth to become an Ultraman against countless enemies while keeping his identity a secret from his fellow members. Almost in the middle of the series, both Hikari and Joneus lost their lives from fighting the Spirit Parasite. They were spirited to the Ultra Planet U40 by Elek, and discovered the Ultra People's connection to the Earth in the past. Hikari and Joneus were revived in said planet and helped foiled the invaders Badel Tribe to reclaim the stolen Ultra Mind. Starting from episode 28, Daisuke Gond\u014d becomes a new captain to the Science Guard. Despite their rocky start, the team learn to accept him due to his great intuition and brotherly instinct. Amia would return to Earth to warn Hikari and the Science Guard of the invasion of Heller Empire, a renegade faction of Ultra People that invaded their home world and saw Earth as their next target due to Joneus' involvement. The Heller Empire was led by Heller, who was banished due to his misuse of the Ultra Mind for immortality. The Science Guard were given the Ultria, an ancient battleship made by the Ultra People to counter invasion attempts made by the Heller Army. In the four final episodes, Heller sent a full-scale invasion on Earth to wipe humanity after fearing that they would cooperate with the remaining Ultra People. The Science Guard disobeyed the Earth Self Defense Army to go into space, joining forces with the remaining U40 resistances to form the U Fleet and attacked the Titan Base on Saturn to prevent more invasion forces from coming to Earth. On U40, the Science Guard made a risky attempt to sneak into the Heller City to weaken its defense as the U Fleet attacked Heller's forces in the planet's outer atmosphere. When the Science Guard were about to be killed by Mac Datar, Hikari's secret was exposed to save his comrades before joining the remaining seven Ultras in foiling Heller's attempts to escape. With Amia and the Great Sage being rescued, Heller died in the ensuing explosion as U40 celebrated their victory. Joneus finally separated from Hikari and spent several months to observe Earth with his sister Amia. Once assuring that peace had returned, they bid farewell to the Science Guard and promised to return when the Earth's safety is threatened once more. == Staff == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Opening Credits !Producers |Noboru Tsuburaya, Kazuho Mitsuda, Masaru Tadakuma |- !Music by |Kunio Miyauchi & Toru Fuyuki |- !Lyrics |Yu Aku |- !Theme Song Performed by |Isao Sasaki |- !Published in |Shogakukan's \"Tv-Kun\" and Other Learning Magazines Kodansha's \"Tv Magazine\" and Other Learning Magazines |- !Animation Supervision & Character Design |Tsuneo Ninomiya |- !Designers / Monster Concept |Akihiko Takahashi & Osamu Yamaguchi |- !Chief Directors / Storyboarding |Hisayuki Toriumi, Takeyuki Kanda |- !Production Producer |Yasuo Shibue |- !Animation Produced by |Logi Studio |- !Produced by |Tsuburaya Productions, Tokyo Broadcasting System |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ End Credits !Written by |Keiichi Abe, Soji Yoshikawa, Hiroyuki Hoshiyama Bunzo Wakatsuki, Yoshihisa Araki, Keisuke Fujikawa Yasushi Hirano, Shiro Azusazawa, Yuki Miyata |- !Directed by |Masahisa Ishida, Junyasu Furukawa, Takao Shitsuji, Hideyoshi Oshika, Takashi Ano, Katsuyuki Tsuji, Masami Yagioka, Hiromichi Matano, Osamu Sekita |- !Storyboard |Yuji Nunokawa, Kazuo Terada, Asahi Yahiro Seiji Okuda, Soji Yoshikawa, Motosuke Takahashi Kohei Matsuura, Noboru Ishiguro, Toru Sakata Mitsuru Hikita, Takeshi Shirato, Tsutomu Yamaguchi Kazuho Mitsuda, Masaoka Fujioka, Toru Yoshida Kazuo Yamazaki, Ryosuke Takahashi, Yoshiyuki Tomino |- !In Charge of Literature |Kazuichi Tsurumi |- !Mechanical Design |Kunio Okakawa, Studio Nue |- !Art |Mitsuaki Nakamura, Nobuto Sakamoto, Kazuo Miyagawa, Shin Sato, Torio Arai |- !Director of Animation |Kazuo Nakamura |- !Animation by |Sunrise Studio, Waap, Green Box, Anime R, Tiger & Nakamura Productions |- !Monster Concept |Minoru Kujirai, Fumio Ogawa, Yoshio Tsuburaya, Yasumi Asahi, Seiichi Saito, Masahiko Watanabe |- !Color Designation |Hiroshi Wakao, Atsuko Oikawa, Shinichi Hatori, Kazumi Matsui, Hiroshi Hasegawa, Sachiyo Osawa, Yayoi Suzuki |- !Ink And Paint |Shaft, Green BOX, Studio Deen, Kuma Productions, Studio Juffs |- !Backgrounds |Mascot, Production Eye, Big Studios, Artland, Art Take 1, Magic House, Baku Productions, Studio Apple |- !Special Effects |Michiaki Doi, Masanori Yamazaki, Green Box, Takao Tanaka, Hiroshi Kazao |- !Rostrum Camera |Asahi Productions and Zenji Furukawa |- !Editing by |Tomoaki Tsurubuchi, Fumio Otachi, Tsurubuchi Films, Yukio Watanabe, Fumiei Kataishi |- !Titles |Studio Try |- !Film Processing |Tokyo Laboratories |- !Audio Director |Toshimi Toriumi |- !Mixing |Manji Nanbu |- !Production Coordinator |Hisayoshi Takahashi |- !Recorded at |Niisaka Recording |- !Production Managers |Noboru Mano, Keiichi Kobayashi, Akira Machida, Yoshihide Fujita, Eiichi Endo, Hideo Hayashi, Masahiko Matsuo, Eizo Takahashi, Masami Yagioka, Mashiro Ueda, Tadayoshi Kusari, Setsuo Fukada, Katsushi Kaniyama |- !Desk |Yoshiyuki Yoshina, Noboru Mano |- !Planning Desk |Naoyuki Eto |- !In Charge of Production |Yoshikazu Tochihira |} == English Dubbing Staff == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+A New Hero is Born!! ~ Chase The Mysterious Red Cloud!! ! colspan=\"2\" |Staff |- !Executive Producer |Mark Cohen |- !Produced by |Sydney L.

The movie is composed of edited footage from several episodes of the series. The storyline was rewritten for this adaptation with a new script by Jeff Segal and music composed by Mark McKinniss. *Ultraman II: The Further Adventures of Ultraman (1983), a dub of the first four episodes co-produced by Tsuburaya Productions and Associates Entertainment International. Despite the title, it has no continuity with the previous English dub of the series.

The order of the third and fourth episodes were also switched. ===Television releases=== *On April 5, 1980, episode 14 of The Ultraman aired on U.S. national television when New York superstation WOR-TV Channel 9 (now WWOR) aired it as the first part of \"Japan Tonight!\", a special seven-hour block of programming from TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System), hosted by actor Telly Savalas. Japanese actress/author/talk show host Tetsuko Kuroyanagi introduced the episode surrounded by assorted Ultraman toys and merchandise while explaining to the American audience just who Ultraman is, \"It's very, very popular in Japan - He's like your Superman\". The episode was dubbed into English by William Ross (Frontier Enterprises) in Japan and was sponsored by Bandai America. *In April 2017, the television network TOKU announced that they would release the series in the United States in the near future. Months later, it was confirmed that the series would be released in Japanese with English subtitles in the channel starting January 29, 2018. ==Other appearances== * Ultraman: Great Monster Decisive Battle * Ultraman Zoffy: Ultra Warriors vs. the Giant Monster Army ==References== ==External links== *The Ultraman (TV) from Anime News Network website Category:1979 anime television series Category:Action anime and manga Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Sunrise (company) Category:Tokyo Broadcasting System original programming Category:Ultra television series Category:Extraterrestrials in anime and manga ",
