It was the first time that the United Arab Emirates played a Full Member side in a bilateral series. Ahead of the tour, Zimbabwe named a 27-man training squad. Zimbabwe's regular captain, Hamilton Masakadza, was ruled out of the tour due to injury, with Peter Moor named as the ODI captain in his place. Also missing for Zimbabwe was experienced batsman Brendan Taylor, who was ruled out due to a calf muscle tear. Zimbabwe Cricket announced that the profits from the third ODI match of the tour would go to the Cyclone Idai relief efforts.
