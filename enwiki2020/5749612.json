    "text": "\"Jet\" is a song by Paul McCartney and Wings from their third studio album Band on the Run (1973). It was the first British and American single to be released from the album. The song's title was inspired by McCartney's black Labrador named Jet. The song peaked at number 7 on both the British and American charts on 30 March 1974, also charting in multiple countries in Europe. It has since been released on numerous compilation albums, and has since become one of the band's best-known tracks. ==Background== Reviewers have reported that the song's title was inspired by the McCartney's Labrador Retriever dog named \"Jet\".Wingspan McCartney has also substantiated this claim. Also confirmed by an interview with Paul Gambaccini, broadcast on BBC Radio in December 1978,\"Paul McCartney in conversation with Paul Gambaccini\", a \"Rock-On\" Special discussing tracks from the Album \"Wings Greatest\"., BBC Radio 2, December 1978. However, in a 2010 interview on the UK television channel ITV1 for the programme Wings: Band on the Run (to promote the November 2010 CD/DVD re-release of the album) McCartney explained that Jet was the name of a pony he had owned, although many of the lyrics bore little relation to the subject; indeed, the true meaning of the lyrics has defied all attempts at decryption. The song's use of the word \"suffragette\" was described by McCartney as \"crazy\" and \"silly\", not having any deep inspiration. In a 2017 interview on Australian radio station Triple J for the segment Take 5, McCartney explained that the song was actually about his experience meeting Linda's father. ==Recording== Whereas most of the Band on the Run album was recorded in Lagos, Nigeria, \"Jet\" was recorded entirely at Abbey Road Studios in London after the group's return (according to engineer Geoff Emerick in his book Here There and Everywhere). Instrumentation used in the song includes electric guitars, bass, Moog, drums, piano, horns and strings. A closer listening reveals the Moog is used for the bass line during the verse and is simply Linda holding the root note.Luca Perasi, Paul McCartney: Recording Sessions (1969\u20132013), L.I.L.Y. Publishing, 2013, , p. 113. ==Release and reception== \"Jet\" was released as the debut single from Band on the Run in January 1974 (although in some countries, the Non-UK/US single \"Mrs. Vandebilt\" was released first). The single was a Top 10 hit for Paul McCartney and Wings, peaking at number 7 in both America and Britain. The single was backed with \"Let Me Roll It\" in Britain. When first released, in America the single's B-side was \"Mamunia\", another track from Band on the Run, but it was soon replaced with the British B-side. The song peaked at number 7 on both the British and American charts on 30 March 1974, also charting in multiple countries in Europe. \"Jet\" has since been released on multiple compilation albums, including Wings Greatest (1978), All the Best! (1987), Wingspan: Hits and History (2001) and Pure McCartney (2016). Prominent music critic Dave Marsh named the song number 793 in his list of the 1001 greatest singles ever made. He referred to it as a \"grand pop confection\" that represented the only time McCartney approached the \"drive and density\" of his tenure with the Beatles. Writer Graham Reid has described it as a power pop \"gem\". Billboard said that the \"guitar energy\" and vocal performances generate \"an outstanding production.\" Paul McCartney has said that the soft rock band The Carpenters were fans of \"Jet\". The Australian rock band Jet drew their name from the song title.Maybe, Brad. \"Clear For Takeoff: Jet Gets Ready To Get Born\" CMJ New Music Report 8 September 2003: 7 ==Personnel== *Paul McCartney \u2013 lead vocals, guitar, bass guitar, drums *Linda McCartney \u2013 backing vocals, keyboards *Denny Laine \u2013 backing vocals, guitar *Howie Casey \u2013 saxophone ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1974) !Peak position |- |Belgium (Ultratop) | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 26 |- |Canada (RPM 100 Top Singles) | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 5 |- |Germany (Media Control) | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 6 |- |Japan (Oricon) | style=\"text- align:center;\" | 39 |- |Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) | style=\"text- align:center;\" | 10 |- |New Zealand (Listener)Flavour of New Zealand, 4 May 1974 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |Norway | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 9 |- |South Africa (Springbok) |align=\"center\"|8 |- |UK Singles (Official Charts Company) | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 7 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 7 |- |US Cash Box Top 100Cash Box Top 100 Singles, March 23, 1974 | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 5 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1974) !Position |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|38 |- |US Billboard Hot 100Musicoutfitters.com | style=\"text-align:center;\"|77 |- |US Cash Box | style=\"text-align:center;\"|77 |} ==Cover versions== Japanese pop power trio Shonen Knife's cover of this song is the last track on their 2008 album Super Group.
