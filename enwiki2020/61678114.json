Occupying adjacent lots with a shared parking area and landscaping, the two buildings are both single-story brick structures, designed by George Tschiemer & Associates and built in the early 1960s. The buildings were listed as a pair on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018, for the role of the Arkansas Teachers Association, an association of African-American educators, in its work during the Civil Rights Era of the 1960s to end segregation in the state. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Little Rock, Arkansas ==References== Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1962 Category:Buildings and structures in Little Rock, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Little Rock, Arkansas ",
