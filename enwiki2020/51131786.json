It was built in 1774. ==History== The square was named for Henri-C\u00e9sar de Castellane-Majastre, an aristocrat who donated the land for its construction in 1774. A fountain with an obelisk used as a lavoir was built in the middle of the square in 1798. In 1911, the obelisk was relocated to Mazargues. Meanwhile, Jules Cantini donated a new fountain, which was designed by sculptor Andr\u00e9-Joseph Allar. The fountain, completed in 1913, represents three Proven\u00e7al rivers: the Durance, the Gardon, and the Rh\u00f4ne. The square, with the original obelisk, is mentioned by Joseph Conrad in his 1919 novel entitled The Arrow of Gold. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1774 Category:1774 establishments in France Category:Buildings and structures in Marseille ",
