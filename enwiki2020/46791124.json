The mall is anchored by Nordstrom, Macy's, and Neiman Marcus. The plaza features a mix of retailers and restaurants, including Tesla Motors, Athleta, Kate Spade New York, P.F. Chang's China Bistro, and Amazon Books. ==History== Broadway Plaza opened on October 18, 1951 with 38 stores. JCPenney, Sears, Woolworths, Joseph Magnin (later I. Magnin), and a Lucky Supermarket were the mall's original anchors. In 1954, Oakland-based department store Capwell's opened as the center's fifth anchor. Lucky was replaced by Northern California's second Bullock's department store in 1973, which was in turn converted to Nordstrom in 1984. Capwell's became Emporium- Capwell in 1979, and was converted to Macy's in 1995; while I.Magnin was converted to a separate Macy's Men's store that same year. Neiman Marcus joined Broadway Plaza in March 2012, as the beginning of several major changes to the shopping center. Plans for an extensive renovation of the mall, including the addition of of new retail space, were approved in December 2013. The expansion merged the two Macy's stores into an expanded single building, replaced existing parking garages with modern structures, and added a new two- level retail building between the existing Macy's and Nordstrom stores. The first tenants in the expansion opened in September 2016, while additional tenants and a two-level Zara store in place of the former Macy's Men's store opened for business during the Christmas shopping season. An additional phase, replacing two multi-tenant buildings with a landmark Apple store, commenced construction in early 2017, and opened in late 2018.http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/06/13/walnut-creek-state-of-the-art- store-planned-for-broadway-plaza-entrance/ On August 29, 2020, it was announced that Neiman Marcus would be closing as part of a plan to close 24 stores nationwide.https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2020/08/29/neiman- marcus-adds-two-more-stores-to-its-closing-list/ ==References== ===External links=== * Broadway Plaza Homepage Category:Contra Costa County, California Category:Macerich Category:Walnut Creek, California Category:Shopping malls in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Shopping malls established in 1951 Category:1951 establishments in California ",
