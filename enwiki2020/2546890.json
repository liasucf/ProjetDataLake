    "text": "A World Apart is a 1988 anti-apartheid drama film and directed by Chris Menges and starring Barbara Hershey, David Suchet, Jeroen Krabb\u00e9, Paul Freeman, Tim Roth, and Jodhi May. Written by Shawn Slovo, it is based on the lives of Slovo's parents, Ruth First and Joe Slovo. The film was a co-production between companies from the UK and Zimbabwe, where it was filmed. It features Hans Zimmer's first non-collaborative film score. ==Plot== Set in Johannesburg in 1963, the film examines the abrupt ending of 13-year-old Molly's blithe childhood when her father, a member of the South African Communist Party, flees into exile. Ostracised by her peers, Molly draws closer to her mother who is part of the campaign against apartheid. Their relationship is challenged by hardship, political intimidation, and the mother's eventual arrest. The film title references both the gap between the mother and her teenage girl, who fails to grasp why their family is so fixated with events beyond their comfortable white suburb, and another separating this world from that of South Africa's poverty-stricken black townships. Essentially, the film is a tribute to Ruth First by her daughter and concludes in a moment of epiphany as Molly comes to terms with her mother's activism and understands that she too must play a part in the struggle against racial injustice. ==Cast== *Jodhi May \u2013 Molly Roth *Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 \u2013 Gus Roth *Barbara Hershey \u2013 Diana Roth *Linda Mvusi \u2013 Elsie *Nadine Chalmers \u2013 Yvonne Abelson *Kate Fitzpatrick \u2013 June Abelson *Tim Roth \u2013 Harold *Carolyn Clayton-Cragg \u2013 Myriam Roth *Yvonne Bryceland \u2013 Bertha *Merav Gruer \u2013 Jude Roth *Paul Freeman \u2013 Kruger *Rosalie Crutchley \u2013 Mrs. Harris *Adrian Dunbar \u2013 Le Roux *David Suchet \u2013 Muller *Jude Akuwudike \u2013 Priest *Nomaziko Zondo \u2013 Thandile ==Reception== A World Apart has an overall approval rating of 89% on Rotten Tomatoes from 9 critics.
