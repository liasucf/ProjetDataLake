    "text": "The Port of Key West is a port in Key West, Florida. Cruise ships dock at all three of its piers. ==History== The first cruise ship to adopt the port was the Sunward in 1969, which docked at the Navy\u2019s pier in the Truman Annex or the privately owned Pier B. The Navy's pier is called the Navy mole. In 1984, the city opened a pier right on Mallory Square. The decision was met with opponents who claimed that it would disrupt the tradition of watching the sunset at Mallory Square. ==Services== The port includes docks at Mallory Square, the Navy's Outer Mole Pier and Pier B near the Weston Resort. A domestic ferry port operates near the Bight of Key West. The port is among the busiest passenger ports in the United States and one of Florida's most important and oldest ferry ports. The port conducts passenger ferry and cruise service to and from Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville, Fort Myers, Port Everglades, Cape Canaveral, and Marco Island, Florida. This allows passengers to travel to Key West without using the busy U.S. 1 Overseas Highway Corridor. ==Impacts== ===Environmental=== A United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation issued a Finding of No Significant Impact. A proposed plan to widen the canal was criticized because it would require dredging in the canal and in the surrounding area with possible silting and related damage to sea life, which could affect Key West's seafood industry. ===Economy=== The cruise ship industry delivers people to the city, where they contribute to the economy by spending at local businesses. This adds about $85 million to business revenues. The port contributes 1,260 jobs. These figures are a significant fraction of the city's economy. ==References== Category:Key West, Florida Category:Ports and harbors of the Florida Atlantic coast Category:Transportation in Key West, Florida ",
