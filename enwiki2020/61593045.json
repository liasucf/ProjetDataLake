He produced films under the studios Rowther Films, Tamilannai Cine Creation and IV Cine International. ==Career== Ibrahim Rowther launched his first film, Uzhavan Magan in 1987 to promote his friend Vijayakanth as an actor in the Tamil film industry.

Panneer's Enakkoru Snehithi featuring Hamsavardhan and Rishi; A. R. Ramesh's Daddy featuring Raghuvaran; and R. Aravindraj's Pesum Vizhigal.
