    "text": "The Beacon Lodge is a unique apartment building in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Located at 30 Douglas Street, the building is directly across from the start of the Trans-Canada Highway, and just down the street from the famous Beacon Drive In. The building has 59 rental suites located on 4 separate floors, with the majority of them being small bachelors and a few one bedrooms. Many suites have views of the Olympic Mountains across the Juan de Fuca Strait in the Pacific Ocean and Beacon Hill Park. All suites come fully furnished, a niche that has made renting the suites much more appealing. == History == In 1945 Henri C\u00f4t\u00e9 and his wife Anne Marie, along with his parents, Joseph and Ida C\u00f4t\u00e9, moved to Victoria from Edmonton, Alberta. Joseph C\u00f4t\u00e9 purchased the Beacon Cottage, an old historic building built in 1883. Being contractors by profession, both father and son renovated the building, converting it into a motel and renaming it the Tourist Lodge. They opened for business in 1946.

The architect behind the Beacon Lodge, Henri C\u00f4t\u00e9, taken sometime in the 1960s. The Tourist Lodge was a haven for many traveler's looking for a peaceful retreat, especially those from the Canadian Prairies who were looking to get away from the harsh long winters. As the C\u00f4t\u00e9's began to take root in the city, Henri C\u00f4t\u00e9 felt it was time to expand the business. Over the course of a year, the Beacon Lodge Motel was built. The building was built in front and attached to the existing Tourist Lodge and on September 15, 1949 was officially open for business. Two years later Joseph C\u00f4t\u00e9 died suddenly, and in his honour Cote Enterprises Ltd was formed in 1952. For the next several decades the Beacon Lodge operated as a successful motel, housing hundreds of guests each year. Its Art Deco and Streamline Moderne architecture, both inside and out, made it very trendy for guests during that time. The building included octagonal windows, a signature of Henri C\u00f4t\u00e9, which he used on other projects he helped build in Victoria during that time. In 1962, an additional renovation was conducted under Henri C\u00f4t\u00e9's supervision. A fourth floor was added and an additional wing was constructed and attached to the southern back part of the Beacon Lodge. This final renovation brought the building up to its current specifications. A miniature lighthouse was erected on the northern part of the property by Henri C\u00f4t\u00e9. Over the years, the lighthouse became a symbol to the many residents, giving them a sense of home and warmth offered by the C\u00f4t\u00e9 family. The Beacon Lodge continued to operate as a motel until in the early 1970s when Henri C\u00f4t\u00e9's youngest son, Bernie, joined the family business. Bernie persuaded to have the Lodge operate as an apartment building instead. 2020 marks 74 years the C\u00f4t\u00e9 family have run the property. A miniature lighthouse built in 1962.

From left to right: Bernie, Henri, Raymond, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, Richard, Robert, Lorraine and Marie C\u00f4t\u00e9. In 1977 Henri and Marie C\u00f4t\u00e9 started a non-profit foundation called the Ray C\u00f4t\u00e9 Memorial Foundation in memory of their son Raymond who died of cancer in 1967 at the young age of 28. Their daughter Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was sponsoring a boy in India and gave Henri the idea of a foundation to honour Ray who was so aware of the needs of others. As a result, on August 15, 1977 the Ray C\u00f4t\u00e9 Memorial Foundation was started as a registered charity. In order to raise money to invest for the charity a large puzzle was purchased showing two men (who bore an uncanny resemblance to Ray and brother Robert). Each puzzle piece purchased added $13.33 towards the goal of $10,000, which once achieved be invested and the proceeds distributed to \"help alleviate the suffering of the poor\". Henri and Marie, along with other immediate family members invested a significant amount and eventually this goal was met. Registered charities were chosen for distribution of the interest earned each year. In 1987 another son (Robert) died and Henri conceived the idea of changing the name of the foundation to the C\u00f4t\u00e9 Family Memorial Foundation. In the years since, Henri as well as Marie and a third son (Richard) have died. The C\u00f4t\u00e9 Family Memorial Foundation strives primarily to help charities that do not have large budgets to solicit funds. In the 40 years since its inception, the C\u00f4t\u00e9 Family Memorial Foundation has successfully donated over $152,000 to the needs of individuals around the world, however most of the charities receiving help operate in the Victoria area. The directors discuss the needs of those asking for assistance and try to focus on groups who help individuals to help themselves. Over the years the Foundation has grown thanks to the dedication of the family members/directors who have been proud to carry on with Henri and Marie's generous philosophy that \"when much is received much should be given\". In that spirit the Foundation currently has two of the family's third generation working to ensure its continuation of helping others. August 15, 2017 marked their 40th anniversary. == Honours == http://www.vicnews.com/news/118402504.html In March 2011 the Government of British Columbia recognized the C\u00f4t\u00e9 family for their contributions to the Francophone community in Victoria over the course of many decades. Henri C\u00f4t\u00e9's youngest daughter, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (C\u00f4t\u00e9) Gerein received the honour on behalf of the family. A plaque was issued and placed in front of the Beacon Lodge. == References == == External links == * https://web.archive.org/web/20110319092911/http://www2.news.gov.bc.ca/news_releases_2009-2013/2011IGR0001-000271.htm * http://www.newsroom.gov.bc.ca/2011/03/francophone-day-highlights-community- legacy.html * http://www.vicnews.com/news/118402504.html * https://www.facebook.com/BeaconLodgeApartments * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bNIxxBIvQo&index;=5&list;=FLtBaGqvaActf- OswUcje8_Q * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfwV0AE-7hw&list;=FLtBaGqvaActf- OswUcje8_Q&index;=6 Category:Apartment buildings in Canada Category:Buildings and structures in Victoria, British Columbia ",
