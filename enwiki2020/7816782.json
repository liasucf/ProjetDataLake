    "text": "{| |} The Arado E.555 was a long range strategic bomber proposed by the German Arado company during World War II in response to the RLM's Amerikabomber project. The E.555 designation was applied to a series of long range jet bomber designs of various sizes, powerplant, crew and weapon load configurations. As design studies only, no aircraft were developed or constructed and the entire E.555 project was cancelled at the end of 1944. ==Project request== In 1942, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (Reich Air Ministry), RLM put forward an initiative to obtain a long-range bomber for the Luftwaffe that would be capable of striking the continental United States from Germany. Requests for designs were made to the major German aircraft manufacturers early in World War II, long before the U.S. had entered the war. Arado had begun its own independent project design work for a future jet flying wing bomber in late 1943; up until that time other manufacturers such as Heinkel (by the February 1943 timeframe), Messerschmitt, Focke-Wulf and Junkers had piston-engined intercontinental bomber designs under various stages of consideration and initial prototype testing per the RLM's request. Arado had also developed its own small, shorter-range jet bomber, the Ar 234 Blitz which first flew in June 1943. By early 1944, Arado was asked to compile design studies for a long range jet-powered bomber. ==Designs== Several different E.555 design configurations were proposed and considered; the Arado team's overall goal for the project was an aircraft with high speed, long range and capable of carrying a four-ton (4,000 kg) bomb load. Perhaps the most striking was the E.555 I, a six-jet, angular flying wing design with remotely-operated defensive turrets. The trijet E.555 VI had the longest wingspan of all the proposals at and range (carrying supplementary fuel tanks) of . The aircraft were to be powered using a jet engine which had not completed development as of 1944, the thrust BMW 018; from two to six of these powerplants in each of the proposed E.555 designs. All of the E.555 projects were abandoned, following a 22 December 1944 order by the Reich Air Ministry. ;Arado E.555 I :Six-engine flying wing bomber ;Arado E.555 II :Four-engine flying wing bomber ;Arado E.555 III :Twin-engine flying wing bomber ;Arado E.555 IV :Three-engine flying wing bomber ;Arado E.555 VI :Three-engine flying wing bomber ;Arado E.555 VII :Three-engine flying wing bomber ;Arado E.555 VIII :Three-engine flying wing bomber ;Arado E.555 IX :Three-engine flying wing bomber ;Arado E.555 X :Three-engine flying wing bomber ;Arado E.555 XI :Four-engine bomber ==Specifications (E.555-6)== ==References== ==External links== * Arado E 555-10 * The flying wing of the Luftwaffe E.555 Category:Abandoned military aircraft projects of Germany Category:Flying wings Category:1940s German bomber aircraft ",
