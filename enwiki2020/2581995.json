It was called Abetune in the Domesday Book of 1086, when it comprised nine households, and was recorded as Ab(b)eton from about 1200 to 1504, Abbedon in 1301 and Abdon from 1503. The village had at least 11 households in 1642, 20 that paid hearth tax in 1662 and in 1793, there were 30 houses in the parish.A P Baggs, G C Baugh, D C Cox, Jessie McFall and P A Stamper, 'Abdon', in A History of the County of Shropshire: Volume 10, Munslow Hundred (Part), the Liberty and Borough of Wenlock, ed.

The population currently stands at approx. 28 dwellings. The hamlet includes a parish church (St Margaret's), a village hall and the remains of a deserted medieval village. The hamlet is very close to the remains of an Iron Age hill fort now known as Nordy Bank, situated on the southern end of the Brown Clee.

The civil parish was abolished in 1 April 2017 and merged with Heath to form Abdon and Heath. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Abdon, Shropshire ==References== 'Abdon' in A History of the County of Shropshire.
