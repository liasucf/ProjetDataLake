    "text": "The gens Luscia was a minor family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned in the early part of the second century BC. They were of senatorial rank, but few of them achieved the higher offices of the Roman state. The only known consul of this gens was Lucius Luscius Ocrea, during the Flavian dynasty. ==Origin== The nomen Luscia appears to be formed from the cognomen Luscus, referring to someone with but one eye.Chase, p. 109. ==Branches and cognomina== The only cognomen known to have been borne by this family was Ocrea, which appears from Cicero's time to the late first century AD. ==Members== * Lavinius Luscius, a comic poet, and a contemporary of Terence.Terence, Eunuchus, prologue 7; Heuton Timorumenus, prologue 30; Phormio, prologue 4.Aulus Gellius, xv. 24. * Lucius Luscius, a centurion in the years following Sulla's return to Rome.
