    "text": "D\u00edas y Flores is the debut studio album by Cuban singer-songwriter Silvio Rodr\u00edguez, released in 1975. ==Content== The album was censored in Francoist Spain. The track list was altered and the album was renamed to Te Doy una Canci\u00f3n. The songs Santiago de Chile and the title track D\u00edas y Flores were omitted and were replaced by Madre and Te Doy una Canci\u00f3n. With the end of the dictatorship, the two songs were added again, the new editions in Spain have thirteen songs. Similarly, the album was also censored in Chile, due to the regime of Augusto Pinochet. A cassette titled Te Doy una Canci\u00f3n circulated, which did not contain the songs Santiago de Chile, Playa Gir\u00f3n, Como esperando abril and Peque\u00f1a Serenata Diurna, however it did includeTe Doy una Canci\u00f3n and a live version of Mariposas. There is also a CD like the Spanish version, which adds Madre after Santiago de Chile, and changes D\u00edas y flores for Te Doy una Canci\u00f3n. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== === Musicians === * Silvio Rodr\u00edguez \u2013 guitar, vocals * Emiliano Salvador \u2013 piano * Frank Fern\u00e1ndez \u2013 keyboards * Eduardo Ramos \u2013 bass * Pancho Amat \u2013 guitar, tres * Pablo Men\u00e9ndez \u2013 guitar, tres, electric guitar * Daniel Aldama \u2013 percussion * Ignacio Berroa \u2013 drums, percussion * Leoginaldo Pimentel \u2013 drums, percussion * Norberto Carrillo \u2013 percussion * Luis Ballard \u2013 flute * Orlando Valera \u2013 saxophone on Peque\u00f1a Serenata Diurna === Production === * Jerzy Belc \u2013 engineer == References == Category:1975 albums Category:Silvio Rodr\u00edguez albums ",
