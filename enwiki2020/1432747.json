    "text": "Archaeoglobaceae are a family of the Archaeoglobales.See the NCBI webpage on Archaeoglobaceae. Data extracted from the All known genera within the Archaeoglobaceae are hyperthermophilic and can be found near undersea hydrothermal vents. Archaeoglobaceae are the only family in the order Archaeoglobales, which is the only order in the class Archaeoglobi. == Mode of metabolism == While all genera within the Archaeoglobaceae are related to each other phylogenetically, the mode of metabolism used by each of these organisms is unique. Archaeoglobus are chemoorganotrophic sulfate-reducing archaea, the only known member of the Archaea that possesses this type of metabolism. Ferroglobus, in contrast, are chemolithotrophic organisms that couple the oxidation of ferrous iron to the reduction of nitrate. Geoglobus are iron reducing-archaea that use hydrogen gas or organic compounds as energy sources.* ==Phylogeny== The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA- based LTP release 106 by 'The All-Species Living Tree' Project.'The All- Species Living Tree' Project.
