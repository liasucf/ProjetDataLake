Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Moncada Tapia (8 December 1870 \u2013 23 February 1945) was the President of Nicaragua from 1 January 1929 to 1 January 1933. == Political career == Moncada was a member of the Liberal Party. In 1910 Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya from the Liberal Party stepped down from government. In 1925 his continuing opposition to Conservative control of the Nicaraguan government forced him to flee to Costa Rica, where he continued to build support for a return of the Liberals to power. After President Adolfo D\u00edaz was re-elected in 1926, a coup by General Emiliano Chamorro (following the withdrawal of the Marines) failed to win U.S. support, Liberal forces rebelled in an attempt to overthrow D\u00edaz's government. Moncada was one of the leaders, together with Juan Bautista Sacasa and Augusto C\u00e9sar Sandino. The United States provided military support for the D\u00edaz government and the Liberal forces were on the verge of seizing Managua when the U.S. forced the warring parties to accept a power-sharing agreement, the Espino Negro accord. Moncada and Sacasa made peace, but Sandino refused and continued the fight and waged a guerrilla war against the U.S. Marines. But in 1928, after elections supervised by the Marines, D\u00edaz was replaced as president by Moncada. == Nicaraguan Constitutional War (1926-1927) == === Background === For many years, conflict brewed between the Liberal and Conservative Parties in Nicaragua. The Liberal Party, which \u201cadvocated manhood suffrage, separation of Church and State, and the advancement of the material wealth of the country\u201d,A Friend of Justice. \"Our Policy in Nicaragua and the Recent Revolutions.\" The North American Review 197, no. 686 (1913): 50-61. http://www.jstor.org/stable/25119915. held power between 1893 and 1909 under the control of President Jos\u00e9 Santos Zelaya. In 1909, the Conservative Party launched a US-supported revolution, with most Americans \u201caid[ing] the revolutionary party because of Zelaya\u2019s oppressive acts\u201d and a \u201c[desire] to see the concessions cancelled so that they could get in on the lands and make \u2018denouncements\u2019 for mining and agricultural purposes\u2019\u201d.A Friend of Justice. \"Our Policy in Nicaragua and the Recent Revolutions.\" The North American Review 197, no. 686 (1913): 50-61. http://www.jstor.org/stable/25119915. Further American intervention led to the deployment of US troops in Nicaragua from 1909-1933, with a brief exception during 1925 that set the stage for the Nicaraguan Civil War. === Actions before and after the Nicaraguan Constitutional War (1926-1927) === The U.S. Marines withdrew their forces from Nicaragua in 1925, prompting General Emiliano Chamorro to rise \u201cin rebellion against a new regime\u201d. He successfully installed himself as president, but the United States refused to recognize his regime. Although Chamorro offered to resign in favor of a designated successor, the U.S. State Department \u201cinsisted upon the selection of its favorite, Adolfo D\u00edaz, as provisional president\u201d.Baylen, Joseph O. \"Sandino: Patriot or Bandit?\" The Hispanic American Historical Review 31, no. 3 (1951): 394-419. doi:10.2307/2509399. Former President Adolfo D\u00edaz assumed the presidency after Chamorro\u2019s resignation, spurring several Liberal leaders, including Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Moncada to rebel. In response, the United States sent troops in 1926 to force an armistice and eventual resolution to the conflict. Emiliano Chamorro and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Moncada agreed to the armistice, but \u201cthe peace talks failed because of the refusal of the Liberals to accept a compromise government\u201d.Baylen, Joseph O. \"Sandino: Patriot or Bandit?\" The Hispanic American Historical Review 31, no. 3 (1951): 394-419. doi:10.2307/2509399. Incensed by the collaboration between the Conservative Party\u2019s leadership and the US government, Moncada refused to recognize the new D\u00edaz government. On December 1, 1926, he initiated a new Liberal offensive at Puerto Cabezas. The U.S. responded by \u201ccreating six neutral zones along the east coast, [expelling] the Liberal government from Puerto Cabezas, and dumping Liberal munitions into the harbor\u201d.Baylen, Joseph O. \"Sandino: Patriot or Bandit?\" The Hispanic American Historical Review 31, no. 3 (1951): 394-419. doi:10.2307/2509399. Augusto Sandino, an ally of the Liberal Party, proposed the creation of a revolutionary force that would continue the struggle against the U.S.-Conservative coalition. He was unable to impress Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Moncada, who was \u201creluctant to turn over precious arms and munitions to [an] unknown guerrilla\u201d.Baylen, Joseph O. \"Sandino: Patriot or Bandit?\" The Hispanic American Historical Review 31, no. 3 (1951): 394-419. doi:10.2307/2509399. Despite rejection by the Liberal leadership, \u201cthe rank and file among the Liberals were more sympathetic\u201dBaylen, Joseph O. \"Sandino: Patriot or Bandit?\" The Hispanic American Historical Review 31, no. 3 (1951): 394-419. doi:10.2307/2509399. and Sandino would go on to establish a revolutionary force after the compromise between the Liberal and Conservative Parties. By 1928, US Secretary of State Henry Stimson had become involved in the conflict. The American public was growing weary of the presence of US Marines in Nicaragua and the US government was looking for ways to quickly withdraw its forces. Given the Liberal Party\u2019s inability to achieve electoral victories under the previous system, Stimson approached Moncada \u201cwith a plan designed to permit Liberal success at the polls\u201d.Bouvier, Virginia Marie.

Moncada accepted, telling Stimson that \u201cwhile there will probably be resistance by small irreconcilable groups and scattered bandits, [he believed] that there will be no organized resistance to our action\u201d.Bouvier, Virginia Marie. The globalization of U.S.-Latin American relations: democracy, intervention, and human rights. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2002 Eleven of the twelve lieutenants under Moncada accepted Stimson\u2019s plan.

Nicaraguans were provided the opportunity to vote and, after the Liberal Party\u2019s electoral victory, \u201cJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Moncada was installed as Nicaragua\u2019s president\u201d.Bouvier, Virginia Marie.

Moncada\u2019s victory surprised many Nicaraguans since his opponent, Adolfo D\u00edaz of the Conservative Party, was a close ally of the US who \u201cowed [it] his entire political career\u201d.Lowenthal, Abraham F.

Exporting democracy: the United States and Latin America ; case studies. Baltimore u.a.: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press. Stimson\u2019s negotiations recognized that the Liberals would not accept anything less than success and, in order to reach a quick result that would allow the US to leave Nicaragua, assisted his victory. Sandino\u2019s violent response to the election of Moncada, however, ensured that US Marines would remain in the country for the foreseeable future since the \u201c1927 Stimson ultimatum had disbanded Nicaragua\u2019s partisan armed forces\u201d.Bouvier, Virginia Marie. The globalization of U.S.-Latin American relations: democracy, intervention, and human rights. Westport, CT: Praeger, 2002. To create a force that could maintain stability in Nicaragua, the United States created the Nicaraguan National Guard and \u201cprovided it with arms and training, while at the same time continuing the fight against Sandino\u2019s rebels\u201d.Bouvier, Virginia Marie.

Moncada asked the US for assistance in stabilizing the country throughout his presidency. The 1929 Stock Market Crash increased President Herbert Hoover\u2019s \u201cdesire to remove the remaining US troops from Nicaragua\u201d.Bouvier, Virginia Marie.

Despite President Hoover's reluctance to intervene in Nicaragua, Moncada succeeded in requesting that \u201cthe United States supervise Nicaragua\u2019s 1930 non-presidential elections\u201dBouvier, Virginia Marie.

Westport, CT: Praeger, 2002. thus ensuring that Juan Sacasa, another Liberal politician, would win the 1932 election. Moncada was the president of the upper chamber of National Congress of Nicaragua 1942-1943. == Descendants == General, then President Moncada's first marriage was to Ms. Margarita Carranza, their children being Elsa, Aquiles, Elio, Hernaldo, Lesbia and Alba Moncada Carranza. One the latter's grand-daughters, Maria Elena Amador Valerio, married Guillermo F. P\u00e9rez-Arg\u00fcello, the oldest great-grand son of Do\u00f1a Ang\u00e9lica Balladares de Arg\u00fcello (1872-1973), who was Pres. Moncada's close friend, comrade and one of his most assiduous political allies in the 1920s and 30s and until his death. It was during his triumphant entrance to Granada, in June of 1927, that the then General Moncada demanded she be accorded the appellation of \"Liberal Heroine\" as a result of what he termed \"her colossal struggles during the Nicaraguan Constitutional War\". From an historical perspective, and as this was reported in various newspapers, most notably in the front page of the Diario Moderno's June 14, 1927 edition, it was thus as of that date, which continued up to her own death at the age of 101, that she, a descendant of the Western Hemisphere's branch of the House of Plantagenet and its most celebrated Nicaraguan female member, became known as the \"1st Lady of Liberalism\" . From his second marriage to Ms. Josefa Reyes Gadea, his children were Leda Maria, Omar and the late \u00d3scar Moncada Reyes, who served as President of the National Assembly of Nicaragua from 1999 until 2001. ==References== ==External links== * *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica online \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Moncada (president of Nicaragua) *Biografia de Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Moncada (Spanish) == Selected works == *Moncada, J.
