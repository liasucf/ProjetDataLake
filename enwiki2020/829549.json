    "text": "Blomberg is a town in the Lippe district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, with c. 15,200 inhabitants (2018). == Geography == Blomberg is 45 km south east of Bielefeld, 20 km east of Detmold and 17 km south west towards Bad Pyrmont. The district is located in the southern foothills of the Lippe mountain range and in the area of Blomberger and Schwalenberger Heights. The core city is located in the center of the so-called Blomberger basin, which lies about 150 m above sea level and clearly separates itself from the surrounding area. The hem of the basin to the north and east are the approximately 400 m high wooded ridges of Barntruper and Blomberger Stadtwald with the Dicker, Becker and Winterberg. To the west are the H\u00f6rntruper Berg, the Meierberg, the Mossenberg (228 m) and the P\u00fcllenberg (261 m), while the border in the south of Nessenberg (235 m), Spielberg (239 m) and Steinberg (342 m) is formed. The drainage of the eastern part of the Blomberger basin is made by the Diestel, a left tributary of the Emmer. Between the districts Istrup and Gro\u00dfenmarpe a watershed has formed. For this reason, the western part of the Blomberg basin is drained via the Marpe and its tributaries towards Bega / Werre. The lowest point of the municipality is at 139 m, the highest is the summit of the winter mountain at 429 m. == Geology == The municipality is located on the southern flank of the Pyrmont-Piesberger axis, there are almost exclusively rocks of the Middle (Km) and Upper Keupers (Ko) open-minded. The rock strata, which were once stored horizontally in the Middle Ages, were raised in the Tertiary around 30 million years ago and formed the Blomberger Sattel. By erosion in the center of the saddle the older gray and red marl of the Middle Keuper (Km1) were uncovered, which is also called Gipskeuper because of switched-on layers of gypsum. The result was the clearly recognizable pelvic structure, this phenomenon is called relief reversal. The reed sandstone (Km2) then forms a first striking terrain level. The city itself is located on the western edge of this steep step. The reed sandstone was obtained in small quarries as quarry stone for construction purposes. The marls of the so-called Red Wall (Km3) are susceptible to weathering, only the following harder stone marls (Km4) give rise to another stage in the terrain. The outermost edge of the basin structure consists of harder rock layers of the Upper Keuper (Ko) R\u00e4tkeuper. In the Tertiary it came in the inner basin edges consisting of gypsum Keuper to the dissolution of plaster layers. Through this process, also called subrosion, formed hollows. These were backfilled with the weathering marls from the immediate area. Because of their high clay content, these sediments formed the raw material basis for some brickworks. In the basin itself, loess has deposited in the course of the last ice age and weathered to loess clay. The amount of deposits is up to 150 cm and is responsible for the good to very good quality of arable land. The old Kleinstadt, classified district, covers an area of 99.12 km\u00b2. The municipality has a maximum extent in east-west direction of about 12\u00bd km and in north-south direction of about 15\u00bd km. The vast majority of the land is used by agriculture, in the area of wet creek lowlands mainly as grassland and pastures. The forest on the surrounding mountains consists of three quarters of deciduous trees, mostly beech, while on the R\u00e4tkeuper spruce cultures thrive. In comparison to the NRW state average of 49.4%, the agricultural area in Blomberg is 60%, while the forest area is 25.4% (NRW) and 26.5% (Blomberg). Extensive areas of the Blomberg urban area are good to very good for the use of geothermal heat sources using geothermal probes and heat generated by heat pump. In the central and southern urban area, however, the suitability is rather mediocre, and in some cases poor (see the adjacent map). == Neighbouring communities == The neighbouring committees are Bad Pyrmont, (in Landkreis Hameln-Pyrmont, Niedersachsen), L\u00fcgde, Schieder-Schwalenberg, Horn- Bad Meinberg, Detmold, Lemgo, D\u00f6rentrup and Barntrup (all in Kreis Lippe). == Villages == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\" !
