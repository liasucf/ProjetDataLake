    "text": "A unary function is a function that takes one argument. A unary operator belongs to a subset of unary functions, in that its range coincides with its domain. == Examples == The successor function, denoted \\operatorname{succ}, is a unary operator. Its domain and codomain are the natural numbers, its definition is as follows: : \\begin{align} \\operatorname{succ} : \\quad & \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N} \\\\\\ & n \\mapsto (n + 1) \\end{align} In many programming languages such as C, executing this operation is denoted by postfixing \\mathrel{+{+}} to the operand, i.e. the use of n\\mathrel{+{+}} is equivalent to executing the assignment n:= \\operatorname{succ}(n). Many of the elementary functions are unary functions, in particular the trigonometric functions, logarithm with a pre-specified base, exponentiation to a pre- specified power or of a pre-specified base, and hyperbolic functions are unary. ==See also== *Arity *Binary function *Binary operator *List of mathematical functions *Ternary operation *Unary operation ==References== * Foundations of Genetic Programming Category:Functions and mappings Category:Types of functions * ",
