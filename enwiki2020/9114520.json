There is little in terms of employment in the parish, with residents travelling to nearby towns and cities. ==History== The name Kinlet, a combination of Kin (royal) and Lett (district), comes from the time of Queen Edith of Wessex, wife of Edward the confessor, who held the knoll at Kinlet. The earliest known human activity was the scatter of flints near Catsley in the centre of the parish, south of Kinlet village. The parish as it is today, was once two smaller parishes, Kinlet in the north and Earnwood in the south. Queen Edith had inherited Kinlet and Cleobury Mortimer from the late Edward the Confessor, at the time of the Domesday Book. Kinlet was then given to Ranulph de Mortimer, who subsequently passed it down to his son, Hugh de Mortimer. The Mortimers were passionate about hunting and used Earnwood as a private hunting ground. The Mortimers were succeeded by Bryan de Brampton in 1176. The De Bramptons gave significant gifts of land in Kinlet to Wigmore Abbey and other religious institutes. This was intended to encourage woodland clearance and increase production. Kinlet was passed through the Cornwalls, to Sir John Cornwall on the death of his father, Sir Brian Cornwall in 1391. His only surviving daughter, Elizabeth, inherited Kinlet in 1414, before marrying Sir William Lichefeld. Sir William Lichefeld held Kinlet until his death in 1446, Kinlet was then passed down to Isabel, sister of Sir John Cornwall and second wife of Sir John Blount II. Sir John Blount II had a son with Isabel, also named John. John inherited Kinlet after his father's death. The estate was passed onto Humphery Blount (grandson of Sir John Blount and his marriage with Isabel) in 1453. Sir George Blount inherited Kinlet in 1531, on the death of his father, John. In 1581, Sir George Blount gave Kinlet to Rowland Lacon, son of his eldest sister Agnes, married to Sir Richard Lacon, instead of his only surviving child, Dorothy. At his death, Rowland Lacon was succeeded by his son, Sir Francis Lacon, who married Jane, daughter of the Viscount of Montague in 1589. The marriage of Ann Lacon to Sir William Childe in 1640, bought the Childe family to Shropshire. Their eldest son, Sir Lacon Childe, was left the lordship at Kinlet and Cleobury Mortimer, whilst their younger two sons, Thomas and William, were left the manor of Earnwood. After the death of Sir Lacon Childe, Kinlet was held by his nephew, William Lacon Childe. He rebuilt Kinlet Hall in 1729. The surrounding village is likely to have been cleared at this time, with the building of the village school in its current location, establishing this as the centre of the village. He also earned substantial revenue from the Kinlet estate. This included sales of produce, bark and rent payments. His daughter inherited Kinlet and married Charles Baldwyn. In 1919, much of the Kinlet estate was put up for sale. ==The Village== The centre of the village is located at the meeting of the roads, B4363 and B4194.
