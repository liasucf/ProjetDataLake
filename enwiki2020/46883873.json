    "text": "\"Against the Wind\" is a song by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler from her 1991 eighth studio album Bitterblue. It was written by Dieter Bohlen, who produced the song with Luis Rodr\u00edguez. The song was released by Hansa Records in 1991 as the second single, after the title track of the album. The song is a soft pop ballad with the lyrics depicting Tyler asking a lover not to break her heart. \"Against the Wind\" was a commercial success in Europe, entering the Top 40 in Germany and Austria. == Composition == \"Against the Wind\" was written by Dieter Bohlen. Inspired by Rod Stewart's commercial success with \"Rhythm of My Heart\" in early 1991, Bohlen approached Tyler to record an album with elements of Scottish folk music, including instruments such as bagpipes and accordion.Bohlen, Bonnie. Oder: Keiner singt geiler als die Tyler, p. 204. Initially, Tyler was reluctant to record Bohlen's music, though he argued, \"you just have to be a bit more commercial.\" == Chart performance == The song entered the Austrian singles chart on 2 February 1992 at number 19, remaining in the Top 40 for a total of twelve weeks. It peaked at number 13 on its third week before falling through the following three weeks. It rose again to number 14 on 15 March before gradually falling again. The previous single, \"Bitterblue\", had already entered the Austrian chart in December 1991, and was in its sixth week running when \"Against the Wind\" debuted. Both songs reached their peak in the same week, though \"Bitterblue\" reached number 5. \"Against the Wind\" also reached the Top 40 in Germany, though only peaking at number 36, remaining on the charts for a total of seven weeks. ==Track listing== *;7\" single #\"Against the Wind\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 3:37 #\"Against the Wind\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:37 *;CD / 12\" single #\"Against the Wind\" (Radio Mix) \u2013 3:41 #\"Against the Wind\" (Long Version) \u2013 5:07 #\"Against the Wind\" (Instrumental) \u2013 3:41 == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from AllMusic: *Bonnie Tyler \u2013 lead vocals *Dieter Bohlen \u2013 producer, writer, engineering *Luis Rodr\u00edguez \u2013 producer *Kenny Aronoff \u2013 drums *Roy Bittan \u2013 keyboards *Richard Gottle \u2013 keyboards *Randy Jackson \u2013 bass guitar *John Pierce \u2013 guitar *Tim Pierce \u2013 acoustic guitar *Waddy Wachtel \u2013 guitar == Charts == {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1992) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Eurocharts European Hot 100 Singles |align=\"center\"|86 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Swiss Airplay Swiss Charts |align=\"center\"|15 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Norway Airplay VG-lista |align=\"center\"|11 |- |} ==References== == Bibliography == * Category:1991 songs Category:Bonnie Tyler songs Category:Songs written by Dieter Bohlen Category:Hansa Records singles ",
