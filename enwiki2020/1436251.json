    "text": "The edge of the Dotson Ice Shelf in November 2016 Dotson Ice Shelf is an ice shelf about wide between Martin Peninsula and Bear Peninsula on the coast of Marie Byrd Land in Antarctica. It was first mapped by the U.S. Geological Survey from air photos obtained by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump in January 1947, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for Lieutenant William A. Dotson, US Navy, formerly Officer in Charge of the Ice Reconnaissance Unit of the Naval Oceanographic Office, killed in a plane crash in Alaska in November 1964 while on an ice reconnaissance mission. ==See also== * List of glaciers * List of Antarctic ice shelves == Further reading == \u2022 David A.
