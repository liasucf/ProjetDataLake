Manoharan, who had been running for everything in the country since ancient times, had to be a wedding broker in a special situation twenty-two years ago. The humiliation of the loss of his sister at the wedding, and the grief of her father's heart attack, have made Manoharan a love interest. Ever since Manoharan became a broker, no one ever has fled from mullurkara. In the meantime, he is given the task to marry off his ex-girlfriend's daughter, Aswathi (Anaswara Rajan), the granddaughter of a teacher couple who looked her after just like her parents. He confirms Achu's marriage with Kunjumon (Aju Varghese), a small local businessman.
