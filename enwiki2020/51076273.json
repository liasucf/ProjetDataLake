Ltd. shipyard in Dundee, United Kingdom in 1909. She was launched and completed that same year. The ship was long, had a beam of and had a depth of . She was assessed at and had a triple expansion engine driving a screw propeller. The ship could reach a maximum speed of 12.5 knots. == Early career == The SS Ardmore made her maiden voyage from London to Cork in 1909 and kept sailing on that line, even after the outbreak of the First World War. She had a stationary crew of 27 and was under the command of Captain Richard Murray. She mainly transported general cargo. == Sinking == SS Ardmore left London and set sail for Cork on 13 November 1917 with a crew of 27 and general cargo on board. Before the ship left London, her crew were informed to be extra careful during the voyage as a large amount of U-boat activity was reported with several ships being sunk in the area only days before. The crew were given specific instructions when they started their voyage and were instructed to sail to Milford Haven first and wait until it became night so the Ardmore could cross the Irish Channel under the protection of the darkness of night. A few hours after the ship left Milford Haven while a small fog was rising over the water, when it was around 10:00 pm and the ship was about off the Coningbeg Lightship, a challenge was flashed out by morse signal asking: \u201cWhat ship is that, where bound?\u201d. Captain Murray, in accordance with sailing instructions ordering him to answer challenges, replied: \u201cArdmore, London to Cork.\u201d. The crew was not sure which ship sent the message as nobody could see any ships who were at a great distance in the dark. A crew member did finally spot the outline of a ship which they believed must have been of a patrol boat. It was however not a patrol boat but the German submarine SM U-95 who was patrolling the area that night. At about 10:30 pm, Captain Murray was on the bridge with his Chief officer, a carpenter and two seamen discussing about the mystery ship, when a deafening explosion occurred on the starboard side, just forward of the bridge. The explosion shook the ship from stem to stern and blew out all the windows of the wheel-house. The Captain ordered the lifeboats to be launched immediately and assisted the chief officer in lowering the forward starboard lifeboat which already had some of the crew in it. The ship only remained upright for a very short time when she suddenly plunged bow forwards into the depths of the nightly sea, taking everything and everyone still on board down with her. Captain Murray was dragged down with the ship, but managed to resurface and get hold of a piece of wreckage, to which he clung for some time while being nearly completely hidden in the fog. After clinging to the wreckage for about an hour, he was picked up by two sailors of his crew in a lifeboat. The lifeboat was badly damaged and taking on water, either by the explosion or by striking against the ship\u2019s side when she went down. Shortly after the fog cleared, the Coningbeg Lightship could be seen to the East, just on the horizon. The survivors tried to row to the Lightship, but made little progress. The cold was intense, in addition to which they were waist-high in the water. It wouldn't better for the survivors as the waves frequently rolled into the boat, drenching them again and again. When it was around midnight, the survivors could see a steamer\u2019s hull approaching out of the darkness and as the ship passed close by, the lifeboats occupants hailed her and those on board answered. But luck was not on the survivors side that night as the ship could not stop in time and disappeared again into the dense fog which had been rising again over the cold and dark sea. The ship however did pick up a lone survivor of the Ardmore, who was clinging onto a piece of wreckage. Those in the lifeboat had no other change than to wait for dawn, hoping that they would make it through the night alive. When not a vestige of a vessel was to be seen and their chance of rescue seemed hopeless, the lifeboat occupants were surprised when they saw smoke on the horizon which later came closer and revealed masts and funnels of a steamer. This time there was nothing that could prevent the survivors of being rescued as the ship headed straight for the lifeboat and in a short time arrived on the scene and finally rescued the six survivors at 8:00 am. The rescue ship was a Patrol Boat called Au Breitia. After the rescue, a red flare was seen in the sky. The Au Breitia immediately set course to the source of the flare and the survivors from the Ardmore expected to find all of their 21 missing fellow crewmen when they would arrive. A lifeboat was spotted in the water when the ship arrived on the scene, however there was only one man standing in the boat. He was the only occupant of the boat and was picked up by the rescue vessel, the man turned out to be the Second officer of the Ardmore. He was asked if he had seen any other crewmen in the water or in the area to which he replied no. The rescue ship still searched the area, but only found debris. After the search the Au Breitia sailed to Cork and landed the survivors, who were all suffering from Hypothermia. Once at shore, the crew learned that another crew member also survived the sinking. He was picked up by the I.H. Lookingback, which was the same ship that had barely missed the lifeboat back at midnight. The Captain counted his men and came to the realisation that only 8 of his 27 counting crew survived the tragedy. The 19 men that perished included the Chief Officer and the First engineer, the victims either died from the explosion of the torpedo or by hypothermia if not drowning before it could even set in. The survivors later testified that there was no warning before the attack and that the ship sank a mere three minutes after being hit, which contributed to the number of victims. == Crew == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
