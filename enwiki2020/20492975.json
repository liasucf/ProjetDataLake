They argued that Item 32 of Law no. 15/1979 has denied the country services of able and intelligent academicians by restricting retirement age of Kuwaitis to 65 years. They recommended that a clause be added to the law such that the retirement age can become 70 years and can further be extended to 75 years. ==References== Category:Kuwaiti people of Arab descent Category:Members of the National Assembly of Kuwait Category:Living people Category:1952 births Category:Popular Action Bloc politicians ",
