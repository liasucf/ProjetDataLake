    "text": "Sokndal Church () is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Sokndal Municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. It is located in the village of Hauge. It is the main church for the Sokndal parish which is part of the Dalane prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Stavanger. The white, wooden church was built in a cruciform design and in a Louis XVI style in 1803 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 800 people. ==History== The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1307, but the church was not new at that time. Records from the 1600s refer to the church as , so it was likely dedicated to Saint Jacob. The medieval church stood on the site for centuries and over time it was renovated, repaired, and rebuilt. Records show that from 1734-1740, the church underwent an extensive renovation project to repair the very old church. It is likely that by then the church bared little resemblance to the original church but rather looked like a patchwork of old an old stave church and newer timber-framed construction. Around the turn of the 19th century, the old church was torn down and a new building was constructed on the same site. The new cruciform church was partially completed in 1803 when it was put into use. It was finished over the next four years and it was consecrated on 8 July 1807. ==Media gallery== Sokndal kirkested.jpg Sokndal kirke.JPG Sokndal kirke, Rogaland - Riksantikvaren-T220 01 0092.jpg Sokndal kirke, Rogaland - Riksantikvaren-T220 01 0091.jpg Hauge i Sokndal. - no-nb digifoto 20151113 00210 NB MIT FNR 12849.jpg ==See also== *List of churches in Rogaland ==References== Category:Sokndal Category:Churches in Rogaland Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:19th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1803 Category:13th-century establishments in Norway ",
