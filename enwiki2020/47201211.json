Filled with a defiant energy and ambition for a better life, Frank starts The Sunshine Club, a place where black and white can meet and, most importantly, dance. Here he dreams of a future where he can dance in step with Rose, the girl next door, the girl of his dreams. ==Development and production== The Sunshine Club was commissioned by the Queensland Theatre Company and the work had a three-year development period.
