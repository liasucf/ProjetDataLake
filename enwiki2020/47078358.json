More recently investigated the relationship between technology and commons, and the links between new and old estates. The interest in the commons has led him to study the problems of expansion of intellectual property rights in science, as well as the analysis of the implications of the concepts of governance, open knowledge, participation, technical democracy, biz science and scientific culture. Manager since its inception in 2007, the Laboratory MediaLab-Prado in Madrid, where he shares his theoretical contributions in the study of the commons among which have formalized the theory of the four consistent entornos5 in the body, nature The city and the digital environment. Examples of the commons in each environment we can cite: the body, the DNA; in nature, clean air, outer space, fishing spots, forests and the sea; in the city, the sewage system, the activities born in urban life such as waltz, play football or paint graffiti; in digital, the Internet Protocol Suite, free software, Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap.
