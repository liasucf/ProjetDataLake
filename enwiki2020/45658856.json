    "text": "The Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) is a standardized test consortium. It creates Common Core State Standards-aligned tests (\"adaptive online exams\") to be used in several states. It uses automated essay scoring. Its counterpart in the effort to become a leading multi-state test provider is the Partnership for the Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC). In 2010, the consortium was created. The Amplify technology company provides the digital technology for the tests. SBAC signed a contract with Amplify to create a digital library of formative assessment professional learning tools designed for Common Core State Standards teachers. Amplify also signed a contract with Smarter Balanced before its purchase by News Corp to develop reporting tools for teacher assessment.Dian Schaffhauser. \"Amplify Insight Creating Digital Library of Assessment Tools for Smarter Balanced\".
