It is an institution that aims to defend, study and disseminate everything that relates to African-Brazilian themes. To this end, it features a collection of original or African-inspired exhibits, due either to work and technology or the arts and religions. In this field, there is also an exhibit of Brazilian-created objects related to the African-Brazilian religion in Bahia. ==References== ==External links== * Website * Visit in 2011 Category:Museums of the African diaspora Category:Museums in Salvador, Bahia Category:Afro-Brazilian culture Category:Ethnic museums in Brazil ",
