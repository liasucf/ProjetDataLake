    "text": "Boronia inflexa is a plant in the citrus family Rutaceae and is endemic to tablelands near the New South Wales - Queensland border in Australia. It is an erect, woody shrub with pinnate leaves and up to seven white to pink four- petalled flowers in the leaf axils. Boronia bipinnata is similar but has larger, bipinnate or tripinnate leaves and smaller sepals and petals. ==Description== Boronia inflexa is an erect, woody shrub that grows to a height of about and a width of about . The leaves are pinnate, long and wide in outline on a petiole long. The end leaflet is linear, long and wide, the side leaflets similar or longer. Up to three, sometimes up to seven white to pink flowers are arranged on a stalk long. The four sepals are triangular, mostly glabrous, long and wide. The four petals are long, sometimes with a few hairs. The eight stamens are hairy and the stigma is about the same width as the style. Flowering occurs from June to December and the fruit are long and wide. ==Taxonomy and naming== Boronia inflexa was first formally described in 2003 by Marco F. Duretto and the description was published in the journal Muelleria from a specimen collected in the Girraween National Park. The specific epithet (inflexa) is a Latin word referring to the edges of the sepals, near their tip. In the same paper, Duretto described four new subspecies: * Boronia inflexa subsp. inflexa that has its branches and leaves covered with minute, soft hairs, and petals long; * Boronia inflexa subsp. montiazura that is glabrous with the end leaflet long and wide; * Boronia inflexa subsp. grandiflora that has its branches and leaves covered with minute, soft hairs, and petals long; * Boronia inflexa subsp. torringtonensis that is glabrous with the end leaflet long and wide. ==Distribution and habitat== This boronia grows in heath, woodland and forest on granite and in soils derived from granite. Subspecies inflexa occurs between Stanthorpe and the Girraween National Park and disjunctly in the Gibraltar Range National Park and subspecies on a small hill near Applethorpe north of Stanthorpe. Subspecies grandiflora occurs near Amiens amd Lyra and subspecies torringtonensis is restricted to the Torrington area in New South Wales. ==Conservation== Boronia inflexa subsp. montiazura is classed as \"least concern\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. == References == inflexa Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Plants described in 2003 Category:Taxa named by Marco Duretto ",
