They are part of Comond\u00fa municipality of the Mexican state of Baja California Sur, and situated about west of the mainland. The total surface area is less than . The official area figure of . The group consists of three principal rocks and numerous smaller ones. South Rock, the largest of the group, is high, with a diameter of only (position ). Middle Rock is high and about in diameter. North Rock, north of South Rock, is high, with a diameter of . The rocks in between those are either submerged or so low that they are barely visible among the heavily breaking waves. The rocks seem to be known since the early Spanish history of Mexico; they can be found on a map from 1598. The first description is from 1704, by pirate John Clipperton. But only in 1791 the first exact description was made by a Spanish sailor. South Rock was climbed for the first time in 1990 by an expedition (October 31 through November 7, 1990) under the leadership of Robert Schmieder, who edited a monograph about the rocks. The group is located at the transition zone between two major biologic provinces, at a latitude where the Pacific Current turns westward to form the North Pacific trans-oceanic current. The rocks are nesting sites of many seabirds. The two other Mexican island groups in the Pacific Ocean that are not on the continental shelf are Guadalupe Island and Revillagigedo Islands. ==Fauna== The breeding marine avifauna of Alijos Rocks currently consists of Leach's storm-petrel (a presumed breeder, probably a few pairs), red-billed tropicbird (14 birds), masked booby (100), and sooty tern (250). The magnificent frigatebird is a regular winter visitor but probably does not breed. The Laysan albatross is currently an annual visitor to Alijos Rocks during its winter breeding season, and may start to nest there in the near future. ==References== ==External links== *Radio enthusiast's description *more detailed description in German *sailing directions *Rocas Alijos: Scientific Results from the Cordell Expeditions *The Marine Birds of Alijos Rocks, Mexico *Cordell Expeditions Homepage *Rocas Alijos part of Comond\u00fa municipality *Video: Tuna fishing beginning at Alijos Rocks, October 2005 ===Literature=== *Robert W.
