    "text": "The Attributes of Civilian Music The Attributes of Military Music The Attributes of Civilian Music and The Attributes of Military Music are a pair of paintings by Jean Sim\u00e9on Chardin, commissioned in 1766 by Charles-Nicolas Cochin for the pediments above the doors to the music room in his Ch\u00e2teau de Bellevue at Meudon (Hauts-de-Seine). They were exhibited at the Salon in 1767 and installed in the Ch\u00e2teau the following year. The Ch\u00e2teau's goods were later confiscated by the state and the paintings were sold at auction. They were acquired by the portrait painter Jean-S\u00e9bastien Rouillard, then by Fran\u00e7ois Marcille and his son Eudoxe. Via a gift from Eudoxe's descendants and from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des amis du Louvre, the Louvre Museum was able to purchase them in 2010. ==External links== *http://cartelfr.louvre.fr/cartelfr/visite?srv=car_not_frame&idNotice;=32227 *http://cartelfr.louvre.fr/cartelfr/visite?srv=car_not_frame&idNotice;=32228 category:1767 paintings Category:Paintings by Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin category:Paintings of the Louvre by French artists Category:Musical instruments in art ",
