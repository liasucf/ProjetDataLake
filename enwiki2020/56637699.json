    "text": "The Gleneagles Medical Centre is a 360-bed private hospital in the city of George Town in Penang, Malaysia. Founded in 1973 as the Penang Medical Centre, it was renamed after its acquisition by Parkway Pantai, a Singapore-based healthcare conglomerate. The hospital now consists of a 19-storey annexe, along with its original six-storey building. == History == The Penang Medical Centre was established in 1973 and was originally a three-storey hospital with 70 beds. It was the brainchild of local, Penang-born tycoons, including Loh Boon Siew, who persuaded senior consultants from the Penang General Hospital to start a new private hospital. The hospital was subsequently expanded to six floors in 1977. In 1989, Parkway Pantai, a Singapore-listed healthcare firm, acquired the majority control of the hospital, which was then renamed the Gleneagles Medical Centre. The hospital was expanded once again in 2013, with the completion of a 19-storey annexe. == Services == Among the services provided by the hospital are as follows. * Cardiac catheterisation * Angiography * Valvuloplasty * CT scanning * Magnetic resonance imaging * Mammography * Radiotherapy * Pediatrics * Nursery * General Surgery * Haemodialysis * Haematology * Neurophysiology * Oncology * Extracorporeal shockwave therapy * Electroencephalography * Bronchoscopy * Cystoscopy * Endoscopy * Minimally invasive procedures == See also == * List of hospitals in Malaysia == References == Category:Hospitals in Penang __INDEX__ Category:Hospitals established in 1973 ",
