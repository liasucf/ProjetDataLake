    "text": "Forecastfox Weather was a Firefox browser extension created by Ensolis that displays a summary of weather forecast for a given location in the status bar, menu bar or toolbar. The summary takes the form of icons alongside text labels, depicting sun, clouds or rain for one or more days ahead. Hovering over the icons shows more information such as temperature and wind speed. , the extension is no longer being updated. Current Firefox browsers indicate the downloads linked from www.getforecastfox.com (version 2.2.2) as not compatible with Firefox 31 or later, an obstacle to deployment. Firefox 28 is supported. Third-party sources have versions which work with current browsers, and some of them may still rely on the getforecastfox.com website to serve the extension's configuration page. If that domain were to stop functioning, there is a strong risk that those versions of Forecastfox would no longer be installable. However, some versions, such as Forecastfox for Pale Moon, use a local configuration page. There is also a version of the extension for Google Chrome. Forecast information is provided by AccuWeather. Previously, the feed was provided by Weather.com but the terms of service became too restrictive. ==Reception== It has been reviewed by Mike Williams at Macworld, PC World, and makeuseof.com. ==References== ==External links== *Forecastfox Weather at addons.mozilla.org Category:Firefox add-ons Category:Discontinued Firefox add- ons ",
