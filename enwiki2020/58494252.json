    "text": "\"Bongcheon-Dong Ghost\" () is a short South Korean horror webtoon created by Horang in 2011. Part of the Chiller series, \"Bongcheon-Dong Ghost\" is an urban ghost story that implements Web animation to deliver jump scares. The webcomic went viral shortly after its release. ==Background== In July 2011, artist Horang published the short webtoon \"Ok-su Station Ghost\" on Naver Webtoon as part of his Chiller series. This webtoon included 3D-like effects, including in a scene in which a ghost's hand appears to jump out of the screen as if to grab the viewer. Horang followed this webcomic up with \"Bongcheon-Dong Ghost\" later that month. An English fan translation and video dub were created in August, as the webcomic quickly went viral internationally. An official English translation was published on September 17. ==Synopsis== Set in Bongcheon-dong, Seoul, the webcomic shows a student walking home from school late at night meeting a female ghost who is apparently looking for her baby. The frightened student points in a random direction just to create distance between her and the ghost. However, as she starts to leave, the ghost rapidly chases her and quickly catches up with her, at which point she faints. When she is woken up by a neighbour the next day, she finds out that a woman in her district had committed suicide the previous night after losing custody of her child. ==Animation== Horang implemented sudden animations in his webcomic, intended to deliver jump scares. The ghost's head suddenly rotates 180 degrees when the student first approaches her, and the rapid attack of the ghost is similarly animated. Horang composed sound effects to go alongside the work. \"Bongcheon-Dong Ghost\" comes with a warning, stating \"Reader discretion is advised for pregnant women, the elderly, and those suffering from serious medical conditions.\" ==Impact== \"Bongcheon-Dong Ghost\" was popularized in part for English-speaking audiences by YouTuber PewDiePie. \"Bongcheon-Dong Ghost\" served as an inspiration for the 2017 horror visual novel The Letter, alongside various Japanese horror works. The webtoon similarly influenced Cameron Lucente in creating his webcomic RoomZero. Horang has continued creating horror webtoons: he has released a large number of short animated webcomics as part of his Chiller series since 2007. In 2013, Horang posted \"Ghost in the Masung Tunnel\", which similarly used 3D animation and programming to set a mood and deliver jump scares. ==References== ==External links== *\"Bongcheon-Dong Ghost\" on comic.naver.com *\"Bongcheon-Dong Ghost\" on webtoons.com Category:2011 webcomic debuts Category:Comics set in South Korea Category:Horror webtoons Category:South Korean webtoons ",
