    "text": "Klinika was a squatted self-managed social centre in \u017di\u017ekov, Prague, from 2014 until 2019. It followed in the tradition of anarchist projects such as Ladronka and Milada. ==Occupation== The building was first occupied in 2014 as part of a housing rights demonstration. It was quickly evicted. A campaign then began which resulted in the Finance Minister offering a one year rent- free contract, which began on March 2, 2015. When the contract was not prolonged, the centre simply reverted to being squatted again after a solidarity demonstration of 2,000 people. It then emerged that the owner, the Office for Government Representation in Property Affairs (\u00da\u0159ad pro zastupov\u00e1n\u00ed st\u00e1tu ve v\u011bcech majetkov\u00fdch \u2013 \u00daZSVM), was claiming the centre needed to be evicted because it was required for a different use, although no permits had been issued. ==Activities== Klinika was used by many different groups. It had a concert space, infoshop, library, bar and a large garden. Regular events included a community laundry, a creche, language lessons and solidarity events. ==Temporary closure== After demonstrations both for and against migration on February 6 2016, Klinika was attacked by a group of neo-Nazis. The next day there was a solidarity demonstration attended by 400 people. A spokesperson for the project said \u201cWe sent 150 carloads of clothes and other things to Hungary, Croatia, Serbia \u2013 wherever we could help. We don\u2019t have many refugees in the Czech Republic, so Klinika acts as a lightning rod for the anger in Czech society towards them.\u201d A court ruling then closed the centre but on appeal it was reopened again after a few weeks. ==Eviction== The centre was evicted in January 2019, despite the political support of Czech Young Greens and Democracy in Europe Movement 2025. Unlike previous evictions, this time the building was then secured and not resquatted. The authorities calculated the cost of the eviction as 1,640,000 Czech crowns (64,400 euros) and are attempting to recover the money from a member of the collective. ==References== Category:Anarchism in the Czech Republic Category:Social centres Category:Infoshops Category:Evicted squats Category:Squats in Czech Republic Category:\u017di\u017ekov ",
