Her next major competition was at the 2012 Gymnastics Olympic Test Event, held in the same location as the Olympics. MacLennan won that event against some of the Olympic competitors that she would later face. In May 2012 she suffered a concussion and had to be cautious in her training, missing the 2012 Canadian Trampoline Championships. However at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, she put on her best performance ever with a finals routine of 57.305, which was the gold-medal winning score for Canada. This was the first and only gold medal for Canada at these games and the first Canadian trampoline gold medal ever. She commented on her gold medal performance: \"I was shocked. It's the biggest score that I've ever gotten and I knew that it would be a tough one to catch. But you never want to get ahead of yourself, you want to wait until all the competitors are done.\" There were three competitors left to compete. The two Chinese competitors were both considered good gold medal prospects, but neither managed to beat her score, confirming the gold for MacLennan. China's He Wenna fell at the end of her performance but narrowly beat out MacLennan's Canadian teammate Karen Cockburn for the bronze medal. MacLennan's result as Canada's only gold-medal winner brought out support in Canada for her to be the nation's flagbearer for the closing ceremony; however, soccer player Christine Sinclair was eventually given the honour, to a little controversy.
