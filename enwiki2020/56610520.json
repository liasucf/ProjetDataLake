    "text": "The Miracle Season is a 2018 American drama film directed by Sean McNamara and starring Erin Moriarty, Helen Hunt, William Hurt, and Danika Yarosh. The film is based on the true story of the Iowa City West High School volleyball team after the sudden death of the team's heart and leader, Caroline Found, in 2011. It was released in the United States on April 6, 2018. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $10 million worldwide. ==Plot== Caroline \"Line\" Found is the star volleyball player on the Iowa City West High School Volleyball Team and well-loved by members of the community. With Line as the captain, the Trojans have been undefeated and everyone has high hopes for West to win the championship again after the previous year, especially against their long-time rival, City High. During a party at her house, Line decides to secretly sneak away to visit her mother Ellyn at the hospital, where she is being treated for cancer. That night, Line herself is killed in a moped accident, leaving the entire community in mourning. Despite the school and community still in shock over Line's death, the Trojans' coach, Kathy Bresnahan continues to hold volleyball practice. She directly approaches Line's best friend, Kelley, encouraging her to return because Line would have wanted them to continue. Kelley refuses, but Bresnahan persists until Kelley agrees. After it is revealed that the Trojans lost their most recent match due to forfeit, Kelley encourages the entire school that they need to continue for Line's sake. West High struggles in practice and loses their first game badly, still discouraged from Line's death. Bresnahan begins to run the team through grueling drills until a teammate can serve to spot one. When Kelley succeeds, Bresnahan names her the new captain of the team. As the weeks go by, the team begins to win and becomes motivated to win the state championship for Line. Bresnahan informs the team they need to win all of their remaining games to be eligible for the state championship. The Trojans win their next fourteen games, giving them a chance to win the championship. Before the state tournament begins, Kelley finds a gift from Line's father, Ernie, that encourages her not to play for Line or to win for her, but to \"Live Like Line.\" At the state tournament, the Trojans win the quarter-final game with ease, but struggle to win their semi-final game. They move on to the championship, and have to go up against City High, who are heavily favored to win. City takes the lead early in the match, but West manages to tie the score and force the fifth and final game. The Trojans go on to win and capture the state championship again. As the crowd cheers, \"Sweet Caroline\" plays in honor of Line and Kelley holds Line's picture up high and proud. == Cast == * Erin Moriarty as Kelley Fliehler, Caroline's best friend * Danika Yarosh as Caroline \"Line\" Found * Helen Hunt as Kathy Bresnahan, volleyball coach * William Hurt as Dr. Ernie Found, Caroline's father and Ellyn's husband * Garry Chalk as Principal Shaw * Tiera Skovbye as Brie == Production == The film was originally titled Live Like Line.
