    "text": "The North American Society of Adlerian Psychology (NASAP) is the primary organization in the United States for the promotion of the psychological and philosophical theories of Alfred Adler, known as individual psychology. Adler was a one-time collaborator with Sigmund Freud in the early days of the psychoanalytic movement who split with Freud to develop his own theories of psychology and human functioning. In the late 1940s a group of psychiatrists and psychologists in Chicago, under the leadership of Rudolf Dreikurs, among others, founded an informal group to carry on discussion and teaching of the theories and techniques of Adler.Dreikurs, R. (1953). Fundamentals of Adlerian Psychology. Chicago, IL: Alfred Adler Institute. This early Adlerian organization became the Individual Psychology Association of Chicago, which quickly grew until it became the North American Society of Adlerian Psychology. The current headquarters of the organization is in Fort Wayne, IN. Members are students and practitioners of Adlerian psychology (or individual psychology). Members are primarily concentrated in the United States and Canada, but there are also members from Uruguay, Brazil, Mexico, and countries in Europe, the Middle East (esp. Israel), and Japan. The Society holds annual conventions at cities in North America where practitioners share techniques and experiences. == Publications == The principal publication of the Society is the Journal of Individual Psychology. This publication traces its root back to Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Individualpsychologie, a journal founded by Alfred Adler in 1914. Jon Sperry and Len Sperry are the current co-editors of the journal and the editorial team is located at Lynn University. It was known under several different titles, and incorporated the Individual Psychologist journal, also published by the Society. == References == == External links == * Category:Adlerian psychology Category:Mental health organizations in Indiana Category:Academic organizations based in the United States Category:Psychoanalysis journals Category:Psychology organizations based in the United States ",
