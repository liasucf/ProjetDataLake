    "text": "Simone Sch\u00fcrle-Finke, born April 16th, 1985 in Ulm, is a German biomedical engineer and Assistant Professor and Principal Investigator for the Responsive Biomedical Systems Laboratory within the Department of Health Sciences and Technology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland. Sch\u00fcrle is a pioneer in nanorobotic and magnetic servoing technologies. Her research program is aimed at understanding cellular mechanisms of disease and then subsequently innovating minimally invasive nano- and micro-scale therapeutic and diagnostic technologies for these diseases. == Early life and education == Sch\u00fcrle was born in Ulm, Germany. In 2003, Sch\u00fcrle pursued her post-secondary academic studies at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Karlsruhe, Germany. During her studies, Sch\u00fcrle travelled abroad to learn techniques and apply her expertise in engineering at two international institutes, funded by the Heinrich Hertz Fellowship and a German State scholarship. Sch\u00fcrle first conducted research in bioengineering at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. She studied automated drug infusion and control, completing her project in 2006. She then travelled to Kyoto University in Japan in where she worked in the Nano/Micro System Laboratory learning the fundamentals of building and applying carbon nanotube based sensors to biomedical application. After completing her studies in Japan in 2008, Sch\u00fcrle returned to Germany to complete additional courses and research and received her M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering and Management from KIT by 2009. Following her Master's, Sch\u00fcrle pursued her Ph.D. at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in Zurich (ETHZ) within the Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems. While at ETHZ, Sch\u00fcrle explored the use of magnetic manipulation as a means to control wireless, nanoscale robots for biomedical diagnostic and therapeutic tools and devices. Sch\u00fcrle completed her PhD work in 2014, receiving immense recognition for her innovative thesis work on magnetic manipulation techniques. To better develop the knowledge and skills necessary to apply her techniques in cancer therapy, Sch\u00fcrle pursued postdoctoral studies at the Koch Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. While at the Koch, Sch\u00fcrle explored the use of nanosensors in tumor profiling and drug transport to tumors. Sch\u00fcrle completed her postdoctoral work in 2017. === Magnetic control methods and microstructure design === In her graduate work, Sch\u00fcrle used her expertise from her undergraduate experience in Kyoto to fabricate innovative ways to mechanically characterize the properties of carbon nanotubes (CTN) and their interfaces with other substances. Since transmission electron microscopes (TEM) are often used to observe the characteristics of novel CNTs, Sch\u00fcrle and her colleagues designed a fabrication technique for TEM compatible devices with which to image CNT-metal contact strength. The device design allows them to observe failures in CNT technology, such as when the CNT-metal contacts slip, which will inform future fabrication of CNTs for use in miniaturized devices. Following this development, Sch\u00fcrle designed a method of servoing magnetic nanostructures through magnetic fields, essentially developing a magnet-based system that can control the pose and motion of objects at the nanoscale. Their system has critical applications to translational medicine as controlled servoing is critical to designing and implementing magnetic drug carrier technology and targeting it to cancer cells. Some major challenges engineers face in the design of these systems are inducing magnetic fields deep enough into tissue, through nested coils, to enable magnetic control of multiple degrees of positional and orientational freedom of nano-objects. The technology Sch\u00fcrle and her colleagues developed for magnetic manipulation of magnetic nano- objects, can fit on an inverted fluorescence microscope and enables magnetic control of 3 positional degrees of freedom and 2 orientational degrees of freedom. The ability to generate independent field and magnetic gradient vectors allows for the holonomic wireless manipulation of magnetic cylindrical nano-objects, similar to what might be used in targeted drug delivery or cell manipulation medical applications. After designing the system to magnetically control microstructure movement, Sch\u00fcrle and her team designed improved tubular and helical magnetic microstructures as applications for this system. Both tubular and helical structures can be oriented and moved magnetically and they have enhanced drug loading capabilities due to higher surface-to-volume ration than spheres, as well as tubules having an open inner cavity that could be filled with drugs. Further, due to shape anisotropy, tubular and helical structures exhibit larger magnetization and are more easily oriented in magnetic fields. Sch\u00fcrle based the design of her nanostructures on biological organisms, such that the motion of the microhelices was inspired by bacterial corkscrew swimming movement. Further, both the tubules and the helices were made rigid by creating them from phospholipid like monomers, such that the overall polymer could be manipulated by a magnetic field. In her doctoral thesis, Sch\u00fcrle used her previous findings and experience in CNT characterization, magnetic field-based servoing system, and maneuverable nanostructures to create NanoMag, a magnetic control system enabling the manipulation of microstructures that meets the needs of biological application. NanoMag was designed to allow magnetic control of spheres, cylinders, and helices, all potential drug-carrier structures. To complement this technology, Sch\u00fcrle also designed a method to create helical microswimmers based on a self-assembly mechanism similar to the phospholipid bilayer. Sch\u00fcrle further validated her technology's potential for targeted drug delivery by assessing its efficacy in living cells, specifically macrophages, to record the dynamics of nanoparticle uptake by living cells. Sch\u00fcrle measured the initial contact forces and monitor the motion of the probe, providing insight into the biophysical mechanisms of phagocytosis. Sch\u00fcrle then used a 3D tracking system to prove that micromanipulation of tissue is possible in both zebrafish and chick embryos, highlighting the flexibility of the system to various biological applications. == Career and research == In 2017, Sch\u00fcrle became a tenure track Assistant Professor at ETH Z\u00fcrich for Responsive Biomedical Systems. The Responsive Biomedical Systems Laboratory, which Sch\u00fcrle is the Principal Investigator of, is a part of the Institute of Translational Medicine which was founded in 2017 right before her arrival. The goal of the institute is to walk the line between the laboratory and the clinic to move science into treatments and diagnostics as quickly as possible. In the Responsive Biomedical Systems Lab, Sch\u00fcrle leads a research program with a goal of exploring the cellular basis of disease and designing innovative nano- and micro-scale tools to diagnose disease and target disease processes. Specifically, her team designs responsive nanorobotic tools which can detect the biological disease environment, through pH sensing or protein activity, and then be controlled through externally applied stimuli to release drugs or report specific characteristics of the diseased tissue to act as therapeutics or diagnostics. Overall, Sch\u00fcrle's research program addresses the current state of health by approaching disease diagnosis and intervention in innovative ways. As such, Sch\u00fcrle is a member of various initiatives to work towards healthcare innovation. Sch\u00fcrle is an Expert Advisory Board Member of the Singularity Group, directing investors towards the most promising future technologies. Sch\u00fcrle also serves on the Global Future Council on the Future of Human Enhancement for the World Economics Forum. Sch\u00fcrle is also an advocate for women in STEM and for improving the culture of academia. After the \u201cWe Scientists 2035\u201d workshop, Sch\u00fcrle and her colleagues deduced that pressure due to ever increasing expectations has created a toxic culture in academia and one that does not foster scientific integrity or the most effective innovation. Sch\u00fcrle suggests dividing tasks that normally all fall on the back of one researcher (such as teaching, grant writing, designing experiments, and more) across multiple specialists in each individual task so that each one can be accomplished with higher quality. She advocates for science to be done in multidisciplinary teams, not in individual silos. === Nano- and microscale sensors and robotics === While at M.I.T, Sch\u00fcrle worked towards designing in vivo nanotools that enabled diagnosis and characterization of the tumor microenvironment. Since the first step in targeted tumor treatment is a precise diagnosis of the specific biology of the tumor and is microenvironment, Sch\u00fcrle began designing a system that allowed specific control and delivery of protease-activity nanosensors via alternating magnetic fields. The nanosensors were delivered to the body, unveiled at the tumor site via heat activation, and the protein contents in the particle were dissipated leading to a reaction with a detectable by-product in the urine for quantification and diagnostic information. Sch\u00fcrle and her colleagues validated the technology in mouse models of human colorectal cancer to successfully assess tumor activity. Sch\u00fcrle and her colleagues then published a pivotal paper, highlighting their design of a robotic technology capable of measuring the mechanobiological properties of cellular behavior. They designed a microrobotic probe that mimicked bacteria, such that they could characterize the attack profiles of macrophages, phagocytic innate immune cells, as they hunt and engulf bacteria. Since Sch\u00fcrle and her colleagues were able to dynamically control the translational and rotational movements of the robots, they could assess how macrophage attack strategies differ for different translation and rotational prey dynamics. The 5-degree of freedom magnetic tweezer system allowed for the dynamic control of robotic movement. Sch\u00fcrle subsequently co-founded a company, called Magnebotix, based on this technology. Magnebotix develops a range of nanorobotic technologies for applications in biological systems such as crystal capture and dissection of the mechanobiology of various cells and tissues in vivo. Sch\u00fcrle continues to develop innovative robotic tools, based on biological systems, that enable targeted drug delivery. In 2019, Sch\u00fcrle and her colleagues created two new types of micropropellers that increase the ease of nanoparticles transport through blood vessels and into tissues. The first structure is an artificial bacterial flagellum and the second is a swarm of living magnetotactic bacteria to create a stream to ease nanoparticle transport. These innovative means of drug delivery, harnessing already established biological architecture and living biology, will dramatically enhance our progression towards effective targeted drug delivery platforms in patients. == Awards and honors == * 2020 KITE Award * 2016 Branco Weiss Fellowship - Society and Science * 2014 ETH Zurich Medal for distinguished doctoral thesis * 2014 Postdoctoral Research Fellowship from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) * 2014 Early Postdoctoral Mobility Fellowship from the Swiss National Science Foundation * 2014 Best Medical Paper Award, Co-Author, IEEE International Conference on Robot Automation * 2008 Heinrich-Hertz Research Scholarship, Germany * 2008 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg scholarship from the State B.-W.
