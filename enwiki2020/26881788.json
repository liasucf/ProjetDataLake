He is reportedly a member of the \"Kutaisi\" criminal gang.Georgia Times - \u201cTariel Oniani\u2019s case\u201d has united Moscow and Tbilisi, June 16th 2009 == Background and activity in Spain == Born in the mining town of Tkibuli in the former Georgian SSR, Oniani's father died while working in a mine, and Oniani turned to a life of crime. At the age of 17 he was convicted of armed robbery and served time in prison. It was here that he was initiated as a 'vor v zakone', or thief-in- law. By the 1980s he was one of the most prominent thieves-in-law of Moscow.Kommersant - \"Clean Villa\" Operation, June 22 2005 In the 1990s Oniani moved to Paris, where he was introduced to Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov. After being charged with several crimes, he moved on to Spain, where he owned stock in an airline and where he ran a construction business employing illegal Georgian immigrants, until in 2005 Spanish police conducted a large scale operation against his organization. Oniani was charged with money laundering, transferring illegal immigrants and organizing a criminal gang, but managed to avoid the sting, while 100 of his workers, 28 members of his gang, including business partner Zakhar KalashovPublico.es - Capo, preso y accionista de Lukoil (Spanish) and even his 12-year-old daughter Gvantsa were detained. It was at around this time he was put on Interpol's list of wanted criminals. == Return to Moscow and gang warfare == After the 2005 incident, Tariel Oniani moved back to Moscow, under the assumed identity of Tariel Mulukhov. Tensions grew between Oniani and rival crime boss and vor Aslan \"Grandpa Hassan\" Usoyan. Around 2007, members of Usoyan's gang started turning up dead, including Armenian national Alek Minalyan, who was allegedly in charge of extorting construction firms working on the 2014 Winter Olympics.TIME Magazine - Will Medvedev's New Laws Help Russia Take Down the Mafia? Oct. 13, 2009 In 2008, in response to the growing violence, a meeting was called on Oniani's private yacht in an attempt to make peace between the two factions. However, Russian authorities were notified of the meeting and used the opportunity to conduct a well-publicised raid and arrest dozens of gangsters.New York Times - In a River Raid, a Glimpse of Russia\u2019s Criminal Elite, July 30, 2008 The gangsters were paraded in front of media cameras by police before being detained. The yacht meeting did not break up the violence, and the mobsters turned to noted vor Vyacheslav Ivankov to act as a mediator. Ivankov ended up taking the side of the older and more experienced Usoyan, rather than Oniani, whom he saw as a younger upstart. In July 2009, Ivankov was shot by an assassin with a sniper rifle while leaving a restaurant, and died of his wounds a few months later. It is believed his murder was a result of his taking the side of Usoyan in the gangland dispute.The Times - Russia salutes its mafia as the good guys, October 25, 2009 In December 2011, Spanish newspapers reported that Tariel's mansion in Barcelona had been illegally occupied by squatters.
