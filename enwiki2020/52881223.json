Gr\u00fcner's mainstay burger (dubbed \"The Hamb\u00fcrger\") was thought by many to be Portland's best, and it was reintroduced at The Loyal Legion when the former Executive Chef of Gr\u00fcner took over that venue's bar. ==Kask== Gr\u00fcner's attached bar, Kask, was named one of the top five cocktail bars in the city by the Drink Spirits magazine, and remains open. Kask was given a four star rating by the Difford's Guide in 2014. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2009 establishments in Oregon Category:2015 disestablishments in Oregon Category:Austrian cuisine Category:Defunct restaurants in Portland, Oregon Category:German-American cuisine Category:Restaurants disestablished in 2015 Category:Restaurants established in 2009 Category:Southwest Portland, Oregon Category:Swiss-American cuisine ",
