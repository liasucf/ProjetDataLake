Porters restaurant was replaced by a chain-restaurant Carluccio's, which has since closed. Little Clarendon Street is a short shopping street in northwest Oxford, England. It runs east-west between the south end of Woodstock Road opposite St Giles' Church to the east, Somerville College to the north and Walton Street to the west. It forms one of three notable streets in North Oxford off the Woodstock Road where the variety of shops and caf\u00e9s make them particularly trendy and bohemian places, the other two being North Parade and South Parade. The street is sometimes nicknamed Little Trendy Street. Its trendiness was already apparent in the 1960s. ==Buildings== As of 2006, the following buildings can be found on the street (this list is not definitive): ;North side (east to west) *Taylor's Delicatessen (previously Lloyds Pharmacy (with Post Office; closed January 2009) *Carluccio's restaurant - closed January 2020 (previously Strada Italian restaurant, and before that Porter's, and numerous previous incarnations) *Richards' Group hairdresser's; *Elham's Lebanese Deli - closed 2018 (previously Martin's newsagent); *Oddbins wine merchants; *Duke of Cambridge cocktail bar; *Al-Andalus Tapas Bar; *Pierre Victoire Restaurant; *Caf\u00e9 Rouge Restaurant; *Margery Fry & Elizabeth Nuffield House, part of the graduate-student accommodation of Somerville College; *Uense (previously Demijohn \u2013 The Liquid Deli \\- closed 2018; and Sylvester's Art and Gifts - closed 2013); *Gail's Bakery (previously Mumu Cafe and Oxford City Barbers - both closed down 2016) *Sushi bar *Popham Hairdressing (previously Walton and Giles hairdresser, closed 2017) *Natural Bread Company (baker's and caf\u00e9) *Uncle Sam's Vintage American Clothing store (still present, but closed 2014); *Hobbs Clothing Store; *Inspires Art and Prints shop (closed); *Lacy's hair salon; *Posh Frocks clothing store; *Juice sandwich shop; *Oxford Wine Cafe (on corner with Walton Street).

The Porters Bar & Restaurant, formerly at 1\u20132 Little Clarendon Street, but frequently changing hands, and now occupied by Carluccio's, appeared in the BBC television programme The Restaurant. On the wall of Taylor's Delicatessen on the south- side of Little Clarendon Street, a miniature model door and window have been installed by Cambridge-based art project Dinky Doors. ==See also== * Great Clarendon Street, in the nearby Jericho district ==References== ==External links== * Little Clarendon Street Online * Dinky Doors - apparent creators of the Little Clarendon Street miniature door Category:Streets in Oxford Category:Shopping streets in Oxford Category:Restaurant districts and streets in England Category:Somerville College, Oxford ",
