Starting her career as a model and, later, as a television actress, she currently works mostly in Bangladeshi and Indian Bengali films. She won Bangladesh National Film Award for Best Actress four times for her performance in the films Guerrilla (2011), Chorabali (2012), Zero Degree (2015) and Debi (2018) and many other national and international awards. == Early life == Ahsan was born to A. S. Maswood (d. 2012) and Rehana Maswood in Dhaka, Bangladesh. She has a younger sister and brother. Along with her formal education, she took a diploma course in Rabindra Sangeet and training in classical music. She first appeared on television when she performed in the teledrama Panchami.
