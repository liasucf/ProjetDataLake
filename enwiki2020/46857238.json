    "text": "A semi-automatic box sealing machine. A large roll of box-sealing tape in the tape head of a case-sealing machine. A case sealer or box sealer is a piece of equipment used for closing or sealing corrugated boxes. It is most commonly used for regular slotted containers (RSC) and can involve adhesive (cold water-borne or hot melt adhesive), box sealing tape, or Gummed (water activated) tape. By contrast, a case erector is equipment for setting-up flat (knocked-down) corrugated boxes and applying a closure to the bottom flaps. ==Semi-automated == With semi automatic equipment, the operator typically fills and loads a box at the entrance to the case sealer; the box may or may not have the bottom flaps previously closed. The operator closes the top flaps and feeds the box in or through a machine which automatically applies the closure. This helps save time and controls the application of the closure materials such as box sealing tape ==Fully automated== Fully automatic equipment is available which does not require an operator. All functions, including closing the flaps, can be automated. ==Other== Case sealers can also be categorized as either adjustable to fit production runs of a uniform box size or random, capable of handling a mixed variety of box sizes without machine adjustment. Several machine design options have been developed. ==See also== * Box-sealing tape * Automation ==Notes== ==References== * Yam, K.L., \"Encyclopedia of Packaging Technology\", John Wiley & Sons, 2009, Category:Packaging machinery Category:Industrial equipment ",
