    "text": "The Tester is a serialized reality program created by Sony Computer Entertainment and produced by 51 Minds.\"Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. Broadens Original Content on PlayStation(R)Network with First-Ever PlayStation(R) Exclusive Reality Series\" PR Newswire. February 1, 2010. Notable as the first original live-action series distributed on a video game console, it features eleven or twelve contestants, selected from thousands of applicants, competing in a variety of challenges to win a job at Sony Computer Entertainment in quality assurance as a game tester with a $5,000 signing bonus and a PlayStation 3 video game console. The winner of the third season also earned an opportunity to work at SCE Santa Monica Studio as a Production Associate on an unnamed PlayStation 3 title, a two-year lease on a 2012 Ford Focus Titanium edition and a Sony BRAVIA 3D Television. The first season launched in North America on February 18, 2010 and new episodes were released weekly until the finale aired on April 8, 2010. In its third season, the program is available as a free download exclusively on the PlayStation Network. Full seasons can also be streamed from the PlayStation website. ==Format== The host, Meredith Molinari, guides the contestants through physical challenges based on skills required of game testers, such as a critical eye for detail and effective communication. Each week, with the exception of the finale, at least one contestant is eliminated by a panel of three judges: release manager for Sony first-party quality assurance Brent Gocke, American model Adrianne Curry (Hal Sparks in season 1), and a special guest judge. Eliminations are based on performance in the weekly challenges. The show is notable, however, for occasionally breaking its own rules during these eliminations. For instance, in the first episode of Season 3, instead of eliminating 2 contestants, as planned, only one was voted out. For the finale, the three remaining contestants race each other in a final challenge with multiple chapters with the first contestant to complete all chapters crowned \"the tester.\" The show has since produced three winners: Will \"Cyrus\" Powers from season 1, Matthew \"Gaymer\" Brown from season 2, and Wilson \"AkilleezMight\" Santiago from season 3.\"A winner crowned on Sony PlayStation Network's reality show 'The Tester'\" USA Today. April 9, 2010.\"And the winner of The Tester Season 2 is...\" Destructoid. Retrieved December 28, 2010. ==Casting== After commenting on the success of the first season, Sony Computer Entertainment America President and CEO Jack Tretton announced a second season on June 14, 2010 at Sony's keynote address at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010.\"Sony E3 2010 keynote, live from the Shrine Auditorium\" Joystiq.
