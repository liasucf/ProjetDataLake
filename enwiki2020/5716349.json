    "text": "The Greater Sudbury Public Library is a public library system in Sudbury, Ontario. The library system has 13 branches throughout the city. The main branch is called \"Mackenzie\" and it is located on Mackenzie Street in the city's downtown core. Additional branches are located in the communities of Azilda, Capreol, Chelmsford, Coniston, Copper Cliff, Dowling, Garson, Hanmer, Lively, Lo-Ellen, New Sudbury and Onaping. A non-lending reference branch was formerly also located at Tom Davies Square, but this moved back to the Mackenzie location in 1998 after renovations expanded the Mackenzie building. The largest library in the City of Greater Sudbury is the Mackenzie Library Main Branch. It provides access to bilingual business directories, phone books, maps, government publications, and a vast selection of books. The Reference Collection also has three special collections in its lower level: Genealogy, the Mary C. Shantz Local History Collection, and Canadian Legal Materials. The Makerspace located in the Mackenzie Library Main Branch offers sewing machines, 3D printers, and other tools for public use. The South End Library branch was demolished in 2009 after a broken sewer lead to sections of the building's floor sinking by over 35cm and the building was declared unsafe. A new branch, designed by Yallowega B\u00e9langer Salach Architecture, was built in the same location with a $4.9 million budget and opened in 2012. The new building includes outdoor reading and performance areas, spaces for children and teens, and meeting rooms. ==Branches== South End branch of the Greater Sudbury Public Library {|class=\"wikitable\" |- |Branch |Community |Address |Coordinates |- |Main Library |Downtown Sudbury |74 Mackenzie Street | |- |Azilda Gilles Pelland Library |Azilda |120 Saint Agnes Street | |- |Capreol Library & Citizen Service Centre |Capreol |9 Morin Street | |- |Chelmsford Library & Citizen Service Centre |Chelmsford |3502 Errington Avenue | |- |Coniston Library |Coniston |30 Second Avenue | |- |Copper Cliff Library |Copper Cliff |11 Balsam Street | |- |Dowling Library & Citizen Service Centre |Dowling |79 Main Street West | |- |Garson Library & Citizen Service Centre |Garson |214 Orell Street | |- |Levack / Onaping Library |Onaping |1 Hillside Avenue | |- |Lively Library & Citizen Service Centre |Lively |15 Kin Drive | |- |New Sudbury Library |Sudbury |1346 Lasalle Boulevard | |- |South End Library |Sudbury |1991 Regent Street | |- |Valley East Library & Citizen Service Centre |Hanmer |4100 Elmview Drive | |} ==See also== *Ontario Public Libraries *Ask Ontario ==References== ==External links== * Greater Sudbury Public Library Category:Culture of Greater Sudbury Category:Public libraries in Ontario Category:Education in Greater Sudbury ",
