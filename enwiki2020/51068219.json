    "text": "The obelisk at Prague Castle is a granite monolith and World War I memorial designed by Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik, installed at Prague Castle in Prague, Czech Republic. It stands 16 meters high. It is located in the Third Castle Courtyard. The obelisk was donated by Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk. It was erected in late 1928 to mark the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the First Czechoslovak Republic. The obelisk was originally to have been much larger, but while it was being transported to its intended location in 1928, it broke in two, and only part could be salvaged. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Granite sculptures Category:Monuments and memorials in Prague Category:Obelisks Category:Outdoor sculptures in Prague Category:Prague Castle Category:World War I memorials ",
