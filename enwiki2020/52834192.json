Kenny Barron Discography, accessed January 20, 2019 == Reception == In his review on Allmusic, Ken Dryden stated: \"Kenny Barron's star began to rise rapidly in the 1980s, though trio dates such as this live set from Imo House in Tokyo ... the pianist pulls all stops in this outstanding date. Barron is known for playing lengthy (yet never overly long) numbers in front of audiences; this evening is no exception, as the tunes average around 14 minutes each ... fans of the amazing Kenny Barron should make every effort to acquire it\" == Track listing == # \"And Then Again\" (Kenny Barron) \u2013 12:08 # \"Manh\u00e3 de Carnaval\" (Luiz Bonf\u00e1, Ant\u00f4nio Maria) \u2013 14:20 # \"Rhythm-a-Ning\" (Thelonious Monk) \u2013 14:17 # \"Someday My Prince Will Come\" (Frank Churchill, Larry Morey) \u2013 13:43 (313) 314-2863(313) 314-2863bcxAs == References == Category:Kenny Barron live albums Category:1982 live albums Category:Whynot Records live albums Category:Candid Records live albums ",
