    "text": "\"God Bless Our Homeland Ghana\" is the national anthem of Ghana; it was adopted in 1957. ==History== Universal Newsreel about the establishment of Ghana in 1957 The music for the national anthem was originally composed by Philip Gbeho and sung to lyrics written by Emmanuel Pappoe-Thompson. However the words were revised by a literary committee in the Office of the then head of state, Kwame Nkrumah. Michael Kwame Gbordzoe has made claims to the current lyrics being used saying that it was written by him after the overthrow of President Nkrumah. A competition was held and Kwame Gbordzoe, who was then a student at Bishop Herman College, presented the current lyrics which was chosen to replace \"Lift High The Flag Of Ghana\" which had been officially adopted after independence and used as Ghana's National Anthem during Nkrumah's regime. == Lyrics == === Original lyrics === The current text was chosen some time after the 1966 coup in Ghana. Philip Gbeho\u2019s text that was discarded at that time started with: Lord God our Father we pray thee, Be thou our guide in all our ways, May we unite together, proclaim the dawn of our new day! Children of Ghana arise and uphold your cause And blaze the trail of freedom far and wide, O God our Father harken to our call and bring us peace here in our fatherland. === Current lyrics === The current lyrics of the \"God Bless Our Homeland Ghana\" national anthem that has been in use since the 1970s were written by Michael Kwame Gbordzoe while a student within the framework of a national competition, and is accompanied by Ghana's national pledge. Thus, the officially current lyrics of \"God Bless Our Homeland Ghana\" are as follows: {|class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"10\" rules=\"cols\" width=30% |- ! bgcolor=\"red\" |First stanza |- | width=\"5%\" | :God bless our homeland Ghana :And make our nation great and strong, :Bold to defend forever :The cause of Freedom and of Right; :Fill our hearts with true humility, :Make us cherish fearless honesty, :\ud834\udd06 And help us to resist oppressors' rule :With all our will and might for evermore. \ud834\udd07 |- ! bgcolor=\"gold\" |Second stanza |- | width=\"5%\" | :Hail to thy name, O Ghana, :To thee we make our solemn vow: :Steadfast to build together :A nation strong in Unity; :With our gifts of mind and strength of arm, :Whether night or day, in the midst of storm, :\ud834\udd06 In every need, whate'er the call may be, :To serve thee, Ghana, now and for evermore. \ud834\udd07 |- ! bgcolor=\"green\" |Third stanza |- | width=\"5%\" | :Raise high the flag of Ghana :and one with Africa advance; :Black star of hope and honour :To all who thirst for liberty; :Where the banner of Ghana freely flies, :May the way to freedom truly lie; :\ud834\udd06 Arise, arise, O sons of Ghana land, :And under God march on for evermore! \ud834\udd07 |} Thus, although Philip Gbeho\u2019s composition is still being used, the current lyrics beginning \"God Bless our Homeland Ghana\" do not originate from him. Michael Kwame Gbordzoe, who became a scientist by profession, has drawn the attention of the Ghana Government to the fact that although his lyrics have been adopted for the country\u2019s national anthem since the 1970s, there has so far been no official Ghana Government recognition for his work, which may be attributed to the abrupt changes in regimes in Ghana in the past.\"Who Owns The Ghana National Anthem\", GhanaWeb, 18 August 2009.\"German-based Ghanaian says he wrote lyrics of anthem and pledge\", Modern Ghana, 4 April 2009. Messages were sent to various Ghanaian government agencies, and was also discussed on air at the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation (GBC), Uniiq FM programme PTGlive, on 9 March 2008. ===National Pledge of Ghana=== I promise on my honour To be faithful and loyal to Ghana my motherland. I pledge myself to the service of Ghana With all my strength and with all my heart. I promise to hold in high esteem. Our heritage, won for us through the blood and toil of our fathers; and I pledge myself in All things to uphold and defend the good name of Ghana. So help me God. The National Pledge of Ghana is recited immediately after \"God Bless Our Homeland Ghana\". ==References== ==External links== * Ghana: \"God Bless Our Homeland Ghana\" - audio of the national anthem of Ghana, with information and lyrics *Ghana national anthem, instrumental version *Ghana national anthem, vocal version *\"Hail the name of Ghana\" - MIDI Instrumental Category:African anthems Category:Ghanaian music Category:National symbols of Ghana Category:Articles containing video clips Category:National anthem compositions in A-flat major ",
