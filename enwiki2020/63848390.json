    "text": "Cracking along the road axis possibly due to poor construction and formation of a cold joint Alligator cracking Pavement crack refers to a variety of types of pavement distresses that occur on the surface of pavements. Different types of pavements develop different cracks. Type of cracking is also correlated with the type of climate and traffic. Sometimes the cracks are aggregated using an index such as Crack Index, and sometimes they are merged with other distresses and form Pavement Condition Index. == Types of cracking == Some of the most important types of crack are as follows. * Crocodile cracking also known as alligator cracking and fatigue cracking * Block Cracking * Longitudinal Cracking\u2014Wheel Path * Longitudinal Cracking\u2014Non-Wheel Path * Transverse Cracking * Reflection Cracking at Joints * Edge Cracking *Slippage cracking == References == Category:Pavement distress Category:Pavements Category:Pavement engineering ",
