Football was not played at his school. Dave joined Barnsley and made his first team debut at 19 years of age at left back where he played most of his career. He was later signed by Laurie McMenemy, later of Southampton and the England coaching staff, who was then manager of Grimsby Town. ==Managerial career== David Booth became manager of Grimsby Town in January 1982 with the club at the bottom of the Second Division, following the dismissal of George Kerr. A late upturn in form enabled Grimsby to escape relegation, and good form continued into the 1982\u201383 season with Grimsby as high as 4th after two- thirds of the season. However, failure to win their last 14 games meant that Grimsby only narrowly avoided relegation. The 1983\u201384 season, however, would see Grimsby emerge as serious promotion contenders for the majority of the season. They were third in the table at the end of February 1984, but a late dip in form meant they finished in fifth place and ten points off the top three, but it was and remains their highest finish in the league since relegation from the First Division in 1948. Good form continued the following season with a tenth-place finish, and disposing Everton from the League Cup, but Booth resigned in November 1985 to participate in a property developing venture abroad, and was replaced by Mick Lyons. He later managed Darlington but could not prevent relegation from the Third Division. The initial challenge for promotion was not sustained and the side was facing relegation from the League when Booth was sacked in February 1989. Following this he became Assistant Manager and latterly Caretaker Manager at Peterborough United after the sacking of Mark Lawrenson. He was sacked after a brief spell and some poor performances with Chris Turner becoming manager who earned successive promotions to the second division. In 1991 Booth moved to Ghana first coached at Obuasi Ashanti Gold and led them to the championship. He was recommended by Bobby Charlton when Charlton's company, BCI, worked as consultants for the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation who funded the football club. 'I had never been to Africa before I took a short-term contract at Obuasi and I treated it like an adventure,' said Booth. He signed up for four weeks and stayed for four years; moved on to Brunei, then moved back after Ghana after long time Asante Kotoko S.C. as a technical director. He moved to India in 2003 to manage Mumbai-based club Mahindra United guiding them to win Federation Cup, Super Cup and the Mumbai League. But then there was an apparent falling out with Chairman Alan Durante, and he departed for South- East Asia. In South East Asia, he was the coach of the Myanmar national football team in 2003 guiding them to the semi-finals of the 2003 SEA Games. Upon returning to India with newly formed Mumbai FC to join his friends Henry Menezes and Arshad, he promoted the club from second division and ensured Mumbai FC as a mid-table I-League club. With the relative success of Booth, Menezes and Arshad, Mahindra United was quick to offer better contracts to the trio. with Booth signing a 3-year deal with Mahindra United starting from August 2009. After his brief successful spell in India, he was appointed coach of Laos national football team from July 2010 till December 2010. He also had a small stint in Sisaket F.C. of Thai Premier League. He then moved to Phnom Penh Crown FC in the Cambodian League from 2011 to 2012 winning Cambodian League, also becoming runner's up in 2011 AFC President's Cup. He again returned to India and had a one-year stint at Salgaocar F.C. between 2012\u201313. After his unsuccessful return to India, he was again appointed as Laos national football team from August 2014. On 1 November 2017 he was appointed as the head coach of I-League 2nd Division side Ozone. The club won 2017\u201318 Bangalore Super Division under his coaching. ==Honours== === As a manager=== Grimsby Town * Lincolnshire Senior Cup: 1983\u201384 Peterborough * Football League Third Division (Play-off Winners): 1991\u201392 Ashanti Gold S.C. *Ghana Premier League:1993\u201394 Mahindra United *Federation Cup: 2003 *The Mumbai League: 2002-03 Mumbai FC *2008 I-League 2nd Division winner: 2007-08 Phnom Penh Crown FC *Cambodian League winner: 2011 *2011 AFC President's Cup Runner-up: 2011 Lao Toyota FC *Lao Premier League winner: 2015 *Lao Premier League Runner-up 2014 *Lao FF Cup Runner-up: 2014 Ozone FC *Bangalore Super Division: 2017\u201318 ==Managerial stats== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|Nat !rowspan=\"2\"|From !rowspan=\"2\"|To !colspan=\"5\"|Record |- !G!!W!!L!!D!!Win % |- | align=left|Grimsby Town | | align=left|January 1982 | align=left|October 1985 ||177||64||63||50||36.2 |- | align=left|Darlington | | align=left|March 1987 | align=left|February 1989 ||101||25||46||30||24.8 |- | align=left|Mahindra United | | align=left|2003 | align=left|2004 ||||||||| |- | align=left|Mumbai FC | | align=left|2007 | align=left|2009 ||32||12||10||10||37.5 |- | align=left|Mahindra United | | align=left|2009 | align=left|2010 ||10||4||0||6||40.0 |- |- | align=left|Laos national football team | | align=left|2010 | align=left|2010 ||6||1||3||2||40.5 |- |- | align=left|Sisaket | | align=left|2011 | align=left|2011 |||||||||| |- | align=left|Phnom Penh Crown | | align=left|2011 | align=left|2012 ||36||22||8||6|| |- |- | align=left|Salgaocar | | align=left|2012 | align=left|2013 ||10||2||2||6||20.0 |- |- | align=left|Lao Toyota FC | | align=left|2014 | align=left|2015 ||17||12||3||3|| |- |- | align=left|Laos national football team | | align=left|2014 | align=left|2015 |||||||||| |- | align=left|Khon Kaen United | | align=left|2016 | align=left|2016 ||2||0||0||2||0 |- | align=left|Lanexang United | | align=left|2016 | align=left|2016 |||||||||| |- |} ==References== ==External links== * *Dave Booth - Post War English & Scottish Football League A - Z Player's Transfer Database Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Barnsley F.C. players Category:Grimsby Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:English football managers Category:Grimsby Town F.C. managers Category:Darlington F.C. managers Category:Brunei national football team managers Category:Myanmar national football team managers Category:Police Tero F.C. managers Category:Mumbai F.C. managers Category:Laos national football team managers Category:Sisaket F.C. managers Category:Salgaocar F.C. managers Category:Lao Toyota F.C. players Category:English Football League managers Category:I-League managers Category:Thai League 1 managers Category:English expatriate football managers Category:English expatriate sportspeople in Brunei Category:English expatriate sportspeople in Myanmar Category:English expatriate sportspeople in Laos Category:English expatriate sportspeople in India Category:English expatriate sportspeople in Thailand Category:English expatriate sportspeople in the Maldives Category:English expatriate sportspeople in Cambodia Category:Expatriate football managers in Brunei Category:Expatriate football managers in Myanmar Category:Expatriate football managers in Laos Category:Expatriate football managers in India Category:Expatriate football managers in Thailand Category:Expatriate football managers in the Maldives Category:Expatriate football managers in Cambodia ",
