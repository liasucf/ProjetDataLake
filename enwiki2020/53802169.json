    "text": "Disney Illuminations is a nighttime spectacular at Disneyland Park in Disneyland Paris. It opened on March 26, 2017 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the park and replaced Disney Dreams! Based on the Ignite the Dream nighttime spectacular at Shanghai Disneyland Park, the show features projection mapping onto the park's castle, fireworks, water fountains, fire, music, lasers, searchlights, mist screens and other special effects. The music played in the finale is \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes\" from Cinderella, and is performed by Heather Headley. In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Disneyland Paris debuted a new video series called \"Disneyland Paris Watch Parties\", starting with a full video of Disney Illuminations. == Opening == The show starts with a voice-over, inviting all guests to release their inner child and dream: > Within each of us is a dreamer, just waiting to be awakened. > We all have the magic to unlock this inner child. > But sometimes, that inner child needs an invitation to come out and play. > This is your invitation... to dream. == Music == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=\"30%\" |+ Featured Songs ! rowspan=\"1\" | Music ! rowspan=\"1\" | Film/Artist |- ! scope=\"row\" |Real Gone | Cars |- ! scope=\"row\" | Circle Of Life | The Lion King |- ! scope=\"row\" |Can You Feel The Love Tonight | The Lion King |- ! scope=\"row\" |Part Of Your World |The Little Mermaid |- ! scope=\"row\" |Into the Unknown |Frozen 2 |- ! scope=\"row\" |He's a Pirate |Pirates of the Caribbean |- ! scope=\"row\" |How Does A Moment Last Forever |Beauty and the Beast |- ! scope=\"row\" |Star Wars Theme |Star Wars |- !March of the Resistance |Star Wars |- ! scope=\"row\" |Let It Go |Frozen |- ! scope=\"row\" |For the First Time in Forever (Reprise) |Frozen |- ! scope=\"row\" |Vuelie |Frozen |- ! scope=\"row\" |A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes | Cinderella |- ! scope=\"row\" |If You Can Dream | Disney Princess |} == Technology == The show is known to use a large amount of audio-visual, lighting, pyrotechnic and hydrotechnic technology mostly installed for the preceding Disney Dreams! show. === Projection === The castle is covered with projectors, and uses a much wider area than the previous Disney Dreams!, utilizing the hills around the castle as well as the castle itself. == See also == * Disney Dreams! * Celebrate the Magic * Celebrate!
