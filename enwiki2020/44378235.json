Hawley was a professor at the University of Missouri. Wolfe wrote in a January 19 email: \"Schaefer had several meetings with me pressuring me to take away Josh Hawley's right to run for Attorney General by taking away an employee's right to ask for an unpaid leave of absence when running for public office.\" The email went on to say he was worried that Schaefer might influence cuts in the university's budget due to political fall out if he did not do as Schaefer asked. ===Endorsements=== ===Polling=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- valign= bottom !
