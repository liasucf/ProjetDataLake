Completed in 2007, the stadium is used mostly for football and field hockey. It is also the home stadium of ADO Den Haag. It has a capacity of 15,000 people, and replaced ADO's former stadium Zuiderpark which was considerably smaller. Due to UEFA's sponsorship regulations, the stadium is named ADO Den Haag Stadium on European matches. Despite being one of the three largest cities in the Netherlands, the clubs attendances have been traditionally smaller than their rivals Ajax, Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven. It was the venue for the 2014 Hockey World Cup. For the last five months of 2019 it also served as the home of AZ Alkmaar, whose AFAS Stadion was undergoing major renovation after a roof collapse. ==Opening== The stadium was opened on 28 July 2007. In June 2010 ADO Den Haag made a naming rights agreement with the Japanese multinational Kyocera to change the name of the stadium to Kyocera Stadion ().Stadion vanaf nu: Kyocera Stadion Security: Happy Crowd Control Wim Deetman, the then-Mayor of The Hague, said that this stadium is the most secure stadium in Europe.
