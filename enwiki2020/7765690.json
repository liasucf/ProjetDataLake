    "text": "Dusty is the second album of singer Dusty Springfield to be released in the USA. It was issued on the Philips Records label in 1964 and includes Springfield's hit singles \"All Cried Out\", \"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\" and the double A-side \"Guess Who?\"/\"Live It Up\". ==Background== Just like the preceding Stay Awhile/I Only Want to Be with You, Dusty comprises tracks from Springfield's UK debut album A Girl Called Dusty (from which this album borrows the cover photo) as well as recordings from UK singles and EP's. The album also includes tracks from the very first recordings Springfield made in the United States as a solo performer. A total of eight tracks were recorded in New York in September 1964, produced by Shelby Singleton Jr., some of which were first issued in the UK on the 1965 EP Dusty in New York, others as single B-sides, while some in fact would remain unreleased in Springfield's native Britain for more than thirty years, until they had their debut as bonus tracks on the digitally remastered edition of the 1965 UK album Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty \u2013 issued in 1998. Dusty combined with Stay Awhile/I Only Want to Be With You was first released on CD as a single-disc compilation by the minor label Taragon Records in 1997 with stereo mixes created by Eliot Goshman. In 1999 the album was digitally remastered and re-issued by Mercury Records/Universal Music, then as a separate album and featuring three bonus tracks. One of these tracks is 'I'm Gonna Leave You', which features a similar verse melody to Ain't No Mountain High Enough, a song she wanted to record first. ==Track listing== ;Side A #\"All Cried Out\" (Buddy Kaye, Phil Springer) \u2013 3:04 #* First release: Philips UK EP Dusty, BE 12564, 4 September 1964 #\"I Wish I'd Never Loved You\" (Mike Hawker) \u2013 3:38 #* First release: Philips UK EP Dusty #\"Can I Get a Witness\" (Lamont Dozier, Brian Holland, Edward Holland Jr.) \u2013 2:45 #* First release: Philips UK EP Dusty #\"Summer is Over\" (Tom Springfield, Clive Westlake) \u2013 3:45 #* First release: Philips UK single BF 1369 (B-side of \"Losing You\"), 16 October 1964 #\"Don't Say It Baby\" (Ted Daryll, Chip Taylor) \u2013 2:25 #* Recorded in New York, September 1964.
