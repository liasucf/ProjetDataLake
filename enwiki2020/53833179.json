    "text": "The Mother of All Marches (), also known as the Mother of All Protests, was a day of protests held on April 19, 2017 in Venezuela against the Chavista government of president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The protests began after the Supreme Tribunal of Justice dissolved the National Assembly and took over its legislative powers March 29, 2017 in what was called a self-coup. * * * * * The dissolution of the National Assembly was reversed shortly thereafter on April 1, 2017. Opposition protesters originally marched peacefully until their path was blocked by Venezuelan authorities, with some looting and clashes resulting following the confrontation. By the end of that day, three Venezuelans were killed, two protesters and one National Guardsman, and over 500 were arrested. ==Background== Following the death of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela faced a severe socioeconomic crisis during the presidency of his successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, as a result of Ch\u00e1vez's policies and Maduro's continuation of them. Protests in Venezuela originally began in February 2014 when hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans protested due to high levels of criminal violence, inflation, and chronic scarcity of basic goods because of policies created by the Venezuelan government Protests then occurred over the years, with demonstrations occurring in various intensities depending on the crises Venezuelans were facing at the time and the perceived threat of being repressed by authorities. Students protesting against rulings outside of the TSJ on 31 March 2017. Concentration on protests subsided in the first months of 2017 until the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis occurred when the pro- government Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela attempted to assume the opposition-led National Assembly by removing their immunity. Though the move was reversed days later, demonstrations grew \"into the most combative since a wave of unrest in 2014\". Protests following the crisis persisted for four weeks before the \"Mother of All Marches\", with 5 protesters dying in the preceding weeks. By April 14, 2017, the opposition formally announced plans for the \"Grand March and Great Taking in All States\" march to take place on 19 April to \"overflow\" Caracas. The next day, President Maduro announced that over 2,000 security checkpoints would be established throughout Venezuela prior to the April 19 \"mega march\", which was said to have nearly 200,000 Venezuelan authorities participating.

Two days before the march on 17 April, President Maduro ordered the expansion of the Venezuelan National Militia to involve 500,000 loyal Venezuelans, stating that each would be armed with a rifle and demanded the prevention of another event similar to the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'\u00e9tat attempt. Diosdado Cabello, a high-level PSUV official loyal to the Bolivarian government, stated that 60,000 motorized colectivos and the National Militia would be spread throughout Caracas on 19 April \"until necessary\" to deter the opposition's \"megamarch\", calling their actions \"terrorism\". ==Protests== Altamira Square, one of the meeting points of the 19 April 2017 march. The day began with demonstrators gathering around the country at about 10:30am, with Caracas having 26 different routes for the main march to head to the office of the Ombudsman Tarek William Saab to demonstrate. As the march progressed through Caracas, the National Guard began to block routes and fire tear gas at marchers at 11:50am, with the demonstrators refusing to leave despite the use of force. At about 12:30pm, demonstrations by both opposition and pro-government Venezuelans fill Caracas' avenues. Shortly after 12:45pm, protesters on the Francisco Fajardo Freeway near Bello Monte begin to flee the area after enduring over an hour of tear gas from authorities, with many leaping into the Guaire River, which is used for sewage drainage, to avoid the gas.

In messages between a Twitter user and PSUV minister and former head of Caracas' Capital District, Jacqueline Far\u00eda, the user asked where the $1.4 billion supposedly invested into the Guaire River went, with Far\u00eda stating \"They were completely invested, but ask your people who had a yummy bath!\" The following day on 20 April, Venezuelans were once again called to the streets to protest peacefully, with many thousands participating.

On 21 April during the funeral of Paola Ram\u00edrez, her parents were taken by CICPC and interrogated following their comments that she had called them minutes before her death, stating that colectivos were pursuing her. Their story contrasted Interior Minister N\u00e9stor Reverol's statement, who said that a member of an opposition party killed Ram\u00edrez. ===\"Tank Woman\"=== The \"Tank Woman\" Images of an elderly woman blocking a VN-4 riot vehicle was compared to images of the Tank Man during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and became a symbol of the protest.
