    "text": "Mehidy Hasan Miraz (born 25 October 1997) is a Bangladeshi international cricketer who plays Tests and One Day Internationals (ODIs) for the Bangladesh national team. A bowling-all-rounder, he is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off break bowler. In November 2018, against the West Indies, he took the best match figures for a Bangladesh bowler in a Test match. == Early and personal life == Miraz was born in Khulna and grew up in Khalishpur of Khulna city and started playing cricket when he was 8. He went to Kashipur Cricket Academy from where he was first selected for the under 14 National Cricket Tournament. On 15 March 2019, along with several members of the Bangladesh test team, he was moments from entering the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand when a terrorist attack began. All members of the team were \"deeply affected\". Miraz decided to marry his long-time fianc\u00e9e Rabeya Akhter Priti on 21 March 2019 in order to overcome the shock of the \"terror attack\". ==2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup== In December 2015 he was named as the captain of Bangladesh's squad for the 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. Miraz managed to take his team into semifinal but lost to West Indies. In third place play-off, Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka by three wickets. Mehidy Hasan Miraz is named Player of the Tournament for his all round performance. He scored 242 runs and took 12 wickets in 6 matches. ==Domestic career== Miraz made his first-class debut against Rajshahi Division cricket team on 16 February 2015. On his debutante matches he made 51 run (he batted only first innings) and took four wickets. He made his Twenty20 (T20) debut on 9 November 2016 playing for Rajshahi Kings in the 2016\u201317 Bangladesh Premier League. In October 2018, he was named in the squad for the Rajshahi Kings team, following the draft for the 2018\u201319 Bangladesh Premier League. In November 2019, he was selected to play for the Khulna Tigers in the 2019\u201320 Bangladesh Premier League. ==International career== ===Test cricket=== Mehidy had a dream debut series as a Test player. After the remarkable 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup there was never any doubt in the team management's mind that they had found themselves an exceptional talent - in fact, in an echo of Australia's unveiling of Shane Warne on the 1993 Ashes tour. He was expected to debut a month ago for Afghanistan ODIs but was deliberately omitted to keep him as a secret from England. On 20 October 2016, Mehidy made his Test debut against England. Even though he is an off break bowler, he opened the bowling in his maiden Test innings. Ben Duckett, another debutant in the same Test match, became Mehidy's first Test wicket. In the same match he also became the seventh and youngest Bangladesh player to take a five-wicket haul on debut in a Test. In his 2nd Test match he became the sixth bowler to take three five-for in his first two Tests and took 19 wickets in the Test series and became the 9th player overall and 1st from Bangladesh to win the man-of-the-series award in debut Test series. Even though he had a horrible series as a batsman scored only 5 runs in 4 innings at an average of 1.25, Mushfiqur Rahim lauded the performances of the 19-year-old, and insisted Mehidy still has much more to offer. He said \" Mehidyi is a good batsman also. He didn't show that now, but hopefully in future he will be a great all-rounder for Bangladesh\". For his sensational debut series against England a new house from Bangladesh's prime minister was gifted to him. In November 2018, in the second Test against the West Indies, Hasan took the best match figures by a Bangladesh bowler in Tests, finishing with twelve wickets for 117 runs. ===One Day International cricket=== In December 2016 he was named in Bangladesh's One Day International (ODI) squad for their series against New Zealand, although he did not play. In March 2017, he was added to Bangladesh's ODI squad for their series against Sri Lanka. He made his ODI debut in the first match of the series on 25 March 2017 at Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium. He took his maiden ODI wicket by dismissing Kusal Mendis for 4 runs. By the end of the match, he had picked up 2 wickets for just 43 runs in his quota of 10 overs \u2013 his second wicket being Dinesh Chandimal. He surprised everyone with his magnificent bowling. Many said, \"He didn't look like a bowler bowling in his first match.\" He picked 4\u201329 in 3rd odi vs West Indies in 2018 and helped Bangladesh win series 2\u20131. In April 2019, he was named in Bangladesh's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. He took 6 wickets and, at an economy rate of 5.08, was Bangladesh's most economical bowler at the tournament. ===Twenty20 International cricket=== In April 2017, he was named in Bangladesh's Twenty20 International (T20I) squad for their series against Sri Lanka. He made his T20I debut for Bangladesh against Sri Lanka on 6 April 2017. In April 2018, he was one of ten cricketers to be awarded a central contract by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) ahead of the 2018 season. == References == ==External links== * * Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Bangladeshi cricketers Category:Bangladesh Test cricketers Category:Bangladesh One Day International cricketers Category:Bangladesh Twenty20 International cricketers Category:Cricketers who have taken five wickets on Test debut Category:Kala Bagan Cricket Academy cricketers Category:Bangladesh South Zone cricketers Category:People from Khulna Category:People from Khulna District Category:Khulna Division cricketers Category:Bangladesh under-19 cricketers Category:Rajshahi Kings cricketers ",
