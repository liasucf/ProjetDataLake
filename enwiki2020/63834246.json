    "text": "Former head office building from 1908 in Besigheim Oberamt was the designation of an administrative division of W\u00fcrttemberg's administrative unit introduced in 1758 instead of Amt, which was in use until 1934. After the seizure of power the upper offices were renamed with the Kreisordnung of W\u00fcrttemberg to Kreise and their number was considerably reduced by mergers in 1938. == History == === Duchy === The subdivision of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg (until 1495 county) into public administration called \u00c4mter reflected in its diversity the gradual growth of the territory. In addition to the secular offices, which made up the largest part of the state, there were monastic, rentier and chamber offices. Usually, a secular office consisted of the eponymous town and the surrounding villages as Amtsorten or Amtsflecken, but the districts differed considerably in area and population, and complicated borderlines with many exclaves marked the map. Some larger offices, such as the Amt Urach, were divided into several sub-offices. For clarification, the offices themselves were called Oberamt from 1758 on, without structural reforms being connected with this renaming. The ducal civil servant, who was traditionally called Vogt and who managed the administrative affairs at the official level, held the title Oberamtmann from 1759. From that day on, all and every secondary title with the bailiff's word was to cease immediately and only the Oberamtsmannsmann name was to be valid.|Author=Herzog Karl von W\u00fcrttemberg|Title=General Rescript concerning the title and rank of the Oberamtm\u00e4nner from Febr. 1. 1759|Hrsg=Zeller|Sammelwerk=Sammlung der w\u00fcrttembergischen Regierungsgesetze|Band=III|Ort=T\u00fcbingen|Datum=1843|Seiten=778}} He was responsible for the implementation of government measures in his bailiwick, for example by publishing new laws, receiving complaints from subjects and forwarding them to the appropriate higher authorities. He also warned persons who only slightly violated laws. In the Amtsversammlung representatives of the official town and places of office discussed common matters. For example, it was decided here how the road construction in the district was to be financed. The official assembly also elected its representatives for the so-called \"Landschaft\". === Kingdom === After the areas that had been assigned to the House of W\u00fcrttemberg as a result of the upheavals of the Napoleonic era since 1803 were initially administered separately as \"Neuw\u00fcrttemberg\", the organisational edict of 1806 - W\u00fcrttemberg had in the meantime risen to become the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg - initiated the creation of uniform structures. In the following years the declaration of intent \"An expedient division and merger of the senior and staff offices will be made gradually. and the whole country, regardless of historical and denominational circumstances, will be newly divided into approximately equal senior offices, the number of which was reduced to 64 by 1810 and to 63 by 1819 with the abolition of the Albeck senior office.K\u00f6nigliches Manifest, die neue Eintheilung des K\u00f6nigreichs betreffend, vom 27. Oktober 1810 (PDF; 2,9 MB) A special role was played by the Residence City Stuttgart, where the Stadtdirektion fulfilled the corresponding tasks. The higher offices were subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior and were responsible for all essential areas of state administration, only the financial system was in the hands of the Kameral\u00e4mter since 1806. Since 1814Title=General Ordinance concerning the Organization of the Medical Constitution in the Kingdoms of March 14/22, 1814,|Hrsg=K\u00f6niglich W\u00fcrttembergisches Staats- und Regierungsblatt|Location=Stuttgart| every senior office received a public health officer under the title Oberamtsarzt (senior physician). |Author=Zoeppritz|Title=Das Oberamtsgesetz von 1912|Sammelwerk=Medizinisches Correspondenzblatt f\u00fcr W\u00fcrttemberg|Band=25|Ort=Stuttgart|Datum=1925|Seiten=377 According to the understanding of the state at that time, administration and jurisdiction were not separate: the senior civil servant presided over the High Court in personal union. Municipal self-administration and the right to a say of the estates, which had already been temporarily restricted under Duke Carl Eugen, was suspended by King Friedrich. King Wilhelm I. took over the government in 1816 and immediately began comprehensive reforms, which led to the constitution of 1819 and thus changed W\u00fcrttemberg from an absolute to a constitutional Monarchy. The edicts issued on 31 December 1818 regulated various aspects of the restored local self-government: * The sheriff's offices became Selbstverwaltungsk\u00f6rper. * The municipalities of a supreme office together formed the Amtsk\u00f6rperschaft, a territorial authority with its own parliament (Amtsversammlung) and its own assets (Amtspflege). * This resulted in a double function of the senior civil servant, who was not only a civil servant as before, but also functioned as organ of the official authority. * Administration and justice were separated from each other at the senior office level. Chapter V of the Constitution contained detailed information on the administrative structure and rights of municipalities and official bodies. In particular, \u00a7 64 provided that upper office limits could only be changed by law, i.e. with the consent of parliament. This possibility was only used very sparingly; only in 1842 were major changes made, affecting around thirty municipalities.Law, concerning changes in the boundaries of the upper administrative districts of July 6, 1842, effective September 1, 1842 (RegBl 1842/385) A bill introduced by the government in 1911 to simplify administration in the sense of cost savings provided for only 42 senior offices, but was rejected by the Chamber of Deputies. === People's state === In 1919, renewed consideration was given to reducing the number of senior offices and restoring the uniformity lost due to the different population trends. After the Landtag had agreed to the abolition of the Cannstatt Superior Office on 1 October 1923,Law, concerning the division of the Cannstatt Superior Office District (RegBl 1923/385), the government attempted to dissolve the Blaubeuren, Brackenheim, Neresheim, Spaichingen, Sulz, Weinsberg and Welzheim Superior Offices on 1 April 1924 by emergency decree, covered by an enabling act. The protests caused by this led to the resignation of the government, the emergency decree was withdrawn and subsequently only the Weinsberg upper office was abolished (on 1 April 1926).<Gesetz, betreffend Aufteilung des Oberamtsbezirks Weinsberg (RegBl 1926/89) === Nazi dictatorship === In 1933, the organs of local self-government were dissolved. After the Oberamtmann had already been called Landrat since 1928 following the Prussian model, the Kreisordnung of 1934Kreisordnung of 29 January 1934 replaced the names Oberamt by Kreis and Amtsk\u00f6rperschaft by Kreisverband, but did not yet include a change of boundaries. Only with the administrative district reform of 1938 were 27 of the remaining 61 districts abolished. == Descriptions of the local authorities == From 1824 to 1886, all the higher offices were statistically processed and their history, communities, population figures and the characteristics of their inhabitants were described in detail. Many times characteristic is the description of the often mainly catholic new W\u00fcrttemberg areas, e.g. in Oberschwaben from the point of view of the old W\u00fcrttemberg/evangelically influenced Stuttgart bureaucracy (quote from the description of the Oberamts Ravensburg, p. 29: \"The character of the inhabitants is generally praised more than in other neighbouring districts, it is described as simple and trusting\"). The Oberamts descriptions have become sought-after and expensively paid collector's items; in the 1970s all volumes were therefore reprinted as reprints. Most of them are now also out of print again. All of them are now available in digital form, see Wikisource. == Today's traces of the Oberamts-ceilings == In the former W\u00fcrttemberg region Baden-W\u00fcrttembergs are often located in the former cities of the higher regional authorities. The ecclesiastical administrative structures of the Evangelical Regional Church in W\u00fcrttemberge also largely reflect the former higher offices. In most of the former cities of the Oberamtscities there is still the seat of a deanery, whose area of responsibility is the same as the former Oberamt. Deviations from this are mainly in the majority Catholic areas and where new deaneries were established due to an increase in members (e.g. Ditzingen or Bernhausen). == List of the W\u00fcrttemberg senior offices (1811 to 1934) == Map of the W\u00fcrttemberg senior offices, status 1926 {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | | Oberamt || since 1973 in Landkreis |- |1 | Aalen || Ostalbkreis |- |2 | Albeck1819 fusioniert mit dem Oberamt Ulm. || Alb-Donau- Kreis |- |3 | Backnang || Rems-Murr-Kreis |- |4 | Balingen || Zollernalbkreis |- |5 | Besigheim || Ludwigsburg, Heilbronn |- |6 | Biberach || Biberach, Alb- Donau-Kreis |- |7 | Blaubeuren || Alb-Donau-Kreis |- |8 | B\u00f6blingen || B\u00f6blingen |- |9 | Brackenheim || Heilbronn |- |10 | Calw || Calw, B\u00f6blingen |- |11 | Cannstatt || Stadtkreis Stuttgart, Rems-Murr-Kreis, Esslingen |- |12 | Crailsheim || Schw\u00e4bisch Hall |- |13 | Ehingen || Alb-Donau-Kreis, Biberach |- |14 | Ellwangen || Ostalbkreis, Schw\u00e4bisch Hall |- |15 | Esslingen || Esslingen |- |16 | Freudenstadt || Freudenstadt |- |17 | Gaildorf || Schw\u00e4bisch Hall, Ostalbkreis, Rems-Murr-Kreis |- |18 | Geislingen || G\u00f6ppingen, Alb-Donau-Kreis |- |19 | Gerabronn || Schw\u00e4bisch Hall |- |20 | Gm\u00fcnd || Ostalbkreis, G\u00f6ppingen |- |21 | G\u00f6ppingen || G\u00f6ppingen, Esslingen |- |22 | Hall || Schw\u00e4bisch Hall |- |23 | Heidenheim || Heidenheim |- |24 | Heilbronn || Heilbronn |- |25 | Herrenberg || B\u00f6blingen, T\u00fcbingen |- |26 | Horb || Freudenstadt, T\u00fcbingen, Calw |- |27 | Kirchheim || Esslingen, G\u00f6ppingen |- |28 | K\u00fcnzelsau || Hohenlohekreis, Schw\u00e4bisch Hall |- |29 | Laupheim || Biberach, Alb-Donau-Kreis, Stadtkreis Ulm |- |30 | Leonberg || B\u00f6blingen, Ludwigsburg, Enzkreis |- |31 | Leutkirch || Ravensburg, Biberach |- |32 | Lorch1819 in Oberamt Welzheim umbenannt. || Rems-Murr-Kreis, Ostalbkreis, G\u00f6ppingen |- |33 | LudwigsburgZuvor Amt Gr\u00fcningen (bis 1718 und von 1722 bis 1758), das ab 1758 mit reduziertem Amtsbezirk als Oberamt Markgr\u00f6ningen fortbestand und 1806 zwischen den Ober\u00e4mtern Ludwigsburg und Vaihingen an der Enz aufgeteilt wurde. || Ludwigsburg, Stadtkreis Stuttgart |- |34 | Marbach || Ludwigsburg, Rems-Murr-Kreis |- |35 | Maulbronn || Enzkreis, Ludwigsburg, Karlsruhe |- |36 | Mergentheim || Main-Tauber-Kreis |- |37 | M\u00fcnsingen || Reutlingen, Alb-Donau-Kreis |- |38 | Nagold || Calw, Freudenstadt |- |39 | Neckarsulm || Heilbronn |- |40 | Neresheim || Ostalbkreis, Heidenheim |- |41 | Neuenb\u00fcrg || Calw, Enzkreis, Rastatt |- |42 | N\u00fcrtingen || Esslingen, Reutlingen |- |43 | Oberndorf || Rottweil, Freudenstadt |- |44 | \u00d6hringen || Hohenlohekreis, Heilbronn, Schw\u00e4bisch Hall |- |45 | Ravensburg || Ravensburg |- |46 | Reutlingen || Reutlingen, Sigmaringen |- |47 | Riedlingen || Biberach, Sigmaringen, Reutlingen, Alb-Donau-Kreis |- |48 | Rottenburg || T\u00fcbingen |- |49 | Rottweil || Rottweil, Zollernalbkreis, Schwarzwald-Baar- Kreis |- |50 | Saulgau || Sigmaringen, Ravensburg, Biberach |- |51 | Schorndorf || Rems-Murr-Kreis, Esslingen, G\u00f6ppingen |- |52 | Spaichingen || Tuttlingen, Zollernalbkreis |- |53 | Stuttgart Amt || Stadtkreis Stuttgart, Esslingen, B\u00f6blingen |- |54 | Stuttgart Stadt || Stadtkreis Stuttgart |- |55 | Sulz || Rottweil, Zollernalbkreis, Freudenstadt |- |56 | Tettnang || Bodenseekreis, Ravensburg |- |57 | T\u00fcbingen || T\u00fcbingen, Reutlingen, Esslingen |- |58 | Tuttlingen || Tuttlingen, Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis |- |59 | Ulm || Alb- Donau-Kreis, Stadtkreis Ulm, Heidenheim |- |60 | Urach || Reutlingen, Esslingen |- |61 | Vaihingen || Ludwigsburg, B\u00f6blingen, Enzkreis |- |62 | Waiblingen || Rems-Murr-Kreis, Ludwigsburg |- |63 | Waldsee || Ravensburg, Biberach |- |64 | Wangen || Ravensburg |- |65 | Weinsberg || Heilbronn, Schw\u00e4bisch Hall, Hohenlohekreis |- |66 | Wiblingen1842 umbenannt in Oberamt Laupheim. || Biberach, Alb-Donau-Kreis, Stadtkreis Ulm |- |67 | Welzheim || Rems-Murr-Kreis, Ostalbkreis, G\u00f6ppingen |} ==References== == Literature == * Walter Grube: Vogteien, \u00c4mter, Landkreise in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.
