    "text": "Bhawal National Park () is a nature reserve and the national park of Bangladesh. == History == Bhawal National Park was established and maintained as a National Park in 1974; it was officially declared in 1982 under the Wildlife Act of 1974. By origin, it was the forest of Madhupur under the rule of Bhawal Estate. It is located in Gazipur, Dhaka Division of Bangladesh, approximately 40 km north of Dhaka city, only 20 km drive from Gazipur and 20 km from Kapasia. The core area of the park covers 940 hectares but extends to 5,022 ha of surrounding forest. Its purpose is to protect important habitats as well as to provide opportunities for recreation. It has been kept under IUCN Management Category V, as a protected landscape. The most common flora is the unique coppice sal forest. The area was noted for peacocks, tiger, leopard, black panther, elephant, clouded leopard and sambar deer. However much of the wildlife had disappeared and only a few species remain. Also, most of the forest has been denuded and is now occupied by forestry companies or displaced people. Most of this area was covered by forests fifty years ago and the dominant species was Sal (Shorea robusta). Illegal deforestation has left only 600 km\u00b2 of the forest and new trees and woodlands have been planted. == Ecology == The park has 345 plant species, including 152 different tree species, 53 shrubs, 106 herbs and 34 climber species. The wildlife in the park includes 13 mammals, 9 reptiles, 5 birds and 5 amphibians. In addition the Forest Department has recently introduced peacocks, deers, pythons, and cat fish. == Gallery == File:\u0997\u09c1\u0987\u09b8\u09be\u09aa.jpg File:Sal forest at Bhawal National Park.jpg File:The Cute Monkey.jpg File:The magnificent beauty of National Park.jpg File:View of river From valley.jpg ==See also== * Madhupur tract * List of protected areas of Bangladesh ==References== ==External links== * (PDF) Wildlife Biodiversity in Bhawal National Park * Reading tools - Indexing Metadata - Wildlife Biodiversity in Bhawal National Park * Nishorgo Biodiversity Program * Protected Areas in Bangladesh Category:National parks of Bangladesh Category:Forests of Bangladesh Category:Protected areas established in 1974 Category:1974 establishments in Bangladesh ",
