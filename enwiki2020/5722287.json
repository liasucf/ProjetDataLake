    "text": "An example of Benten-d\u014dIn Japanese a is a Buddhist temple dedicated to Benten or Benzaiten, goddess of wealth, happiness, wisdom and music. Many such temples exist all over Japan. Because the goddess was originally the personification of a river, Benten-d\u014d often stand next to some source of water, a river, pond, spring, or even the sea. The goddess is routinely believed to be essentially the same as kami Ugajin within the syncretism of Buddhism and local kami worship called shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d. For this reason, Benten-d\u014d can be found also at many Shinto shrines, despite use of the suffix -d\u014d, which is the traditional designation for a Buddhist \"hall\". In contrast, the halls of Shinto shrines use the esuffix -den, as in honden. An example of the syncretic association is the Kawahara Shrine in Nagoya. ==References== * Category:Buddhist temples in Japan ",
