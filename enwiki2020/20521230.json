    "text": "2 is a 2001 album recorded by French singer Florent Pagny. It was his seventh studio album and was released on December 17, 2001. It achieved success in France and Belgium (Wallonia), where it hit #3, and in Switzerland where it peaked at #8. This album is composed of cover versions of popular songs in French or English, and covers of Pagny's previous songs, but as the title suggests, these songs were overdubbed as duets with many notable artists such as David Hallyday, Calogero, Pascal Obispo and Patrick Bruel. It provided a sole single, \"L'air du temps\", recorded with C\u00e9cilia Cara, which was #20 in France and #19 in Belgium (Wallonia). ==Track listing== Source : Allmusic.2, track listing [ Allmusic.com] (December 2, 2008) ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2001-2003) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Belgian (Wallonia) Albums Chart2, Belgian (Wallonia) Albums Chart Ultratop.be (Retrieved December 2, 2008) |align=\"center\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|French SNEP Albums Chart2, French Albums Chart Lescharts.com (Retrieved December 2, 2008) |align=\"center\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|Swiss Albums Chart2, Swiss Albums Chart Hitparade.ch (Retrieved Avril 5, 2014) |align=\"center\"|8 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|End of year chart (2001) !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|French Albums Chart2001 French Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|52 |- !align=\"left\"|End of year chart (2002) !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|Belgian (Wallonia) Albums Chart2002 Belgian (Wallonia) Albums Chart Ultratop.be (Retrieved December 2, 2008) |align=\"center\"|56 |- |align=\"left\"|French Albums Chart2002 French Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|37 |- |align=\"left\"|Swiss Singles Chart2002 Swiss Singles Chart Hitparade.ch (Retrieved Avril 5, 2014) |align=\"center\"|84 |- |} ==Certifications== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! bgcolor=\"#ebf5ff\"|Country ! bgcolor=\"#ebf5ff\"|Certification ! bgcolor=\"#ebf5ff\"|Date ! bgcolor=\"#ebf5ff\"|Sales certified ! bgcolor=\"#ebf5ff\"|Physical sales |- |Belgium |align=\"center\"|Gold |align=\"center\"|2002 |align=\"center\"|25,000 |align=\"center\"| |- |FranceFrench certifications Disqueenfrance.com (Retrieved December 2, 2008) |align=\"center\"|2 x Gold |align=\"center\"|December 19, 2001 |align=\"center\"|200,000 |align=\"center\"|452,000Chart trajectories of various albums in France + sales Infodisc.fr (Retrieved December 2, 2008) |- |SwitzerlandSwiss certifications Swisscharts.com (Retrieved December 2, 2008) |align=\"center\"|Gold |align=\"center\"|2002 |align=\"center\"|20,000 |align=\"center\"| |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\" border=\"1\" !
