    "text": "Ogyen Trinley Dorje (, ; born 26 June 1985), also written as Urgyen Trinley Dorje (). Ogyen Trinley Dorje has been recognized and enthroned as the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa. The Karmapa is head of the Karma Kagyu school, the primary sub-school of the Kagyu school, one of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Ogyen Trinley Dorje left China in 1999, relocated to India in 2000, and is currently traveling and residing in the United States. == Biography == ===Birth=== Known as Apo Gaga, Ogyen Trinley Rinpoche was born in 1985 in Lhatok Township, Chamdo County, Tibet Autonomous Region, China, to nomadic parents. ===Prediction letter and recognition=== In March 1992, a prediction letter in verse written by the 16th Karmapa was located in an amulet given to Tai Situ Rinpoche. It said, \"In the east of the land of snow Is a country where divine thunder spontaneously blazes. In a beautiful nomad's place with the sign of a cow, The method is Dondrup and the wisdom is Lolaga. Born in the year of the one used for the earth.\" Afterwards, the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche was put in charge of the search committee that included Tai Situ Rinpoche, Gyaltsap Rinpoche, and Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche. On 26 April 1992, Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche died in a car crash in India. Shamar Rinpoche left for the United States, and Tai Situpa then led the search committee. A group of monks from Tsurphu Monastery was dispatched to eastern Tibet to search for a nomad child born in the year of the ox, whose parents were named Lolaga and Dondrup.Enlightened Heart, \"Tibet's Kagyu Buddhists face a leadership battle\", 24 March 1999, https://www.karmapa.org.nz/news/15/64/Tibet-s-Kagyu-Buddhists- face-a-leadership-battle/ On 07 June 1992, Ogyen Trinley Dorje was seven years old when his recognition was confirmed, after the monks found him and the 14th Dalai Lama was shown the prediction letter by Tai Situpa and Gyaltsap Rinpoche. On 17 June 1992, Shamar Rinpoche sent a letter from Sikkim in agreement with the Dalai Lama's recognition of Ogyen Trinley Rinpoche. Shamar Rinpoche also withdrew requests for examinations of the prophetic letter on 17 June and again on 18 July.The Karmapa, Kagyu Office, [1992 Shamar Rinpoche Letters], https://kagyuoffice.org/confirmation-by-the-dalai-lama/sharmar- rinpoche-letter/ The 14th Dalai Lama issued an official statement of recognition and confirmation of the 16th Karmapa's reincarnation as Ogyen Trinley Dorje, on 30 June 1992. Ogyen Trinley Dorje was enthroned as the 17th Karmapa on 27 September 1992 at Tsurphu Monastery (), the traditional seat of the Karmapa in Tibet. He received the official sanction of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, who declared him to be a \"living Buddha\", the first time People's Republic of China has officially confirmed a tulku. A year later, the Chinese announced during the UN World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna they would train him in Tsurphu for his future task as the successor of the Dalai Lama.\"Die Presse\", 17 June 1993, page 2: \"Am Rande der Konferenz\". ===Escape from Tibet=== In 1999, at the age of 14, the Karmapa escaped Chinese-controlled Tibet during the winter, traveling to India through Nepal, arriving at the Tibetan exile quarters at McLeod Ganj on 5 January 2000. Ogyen Trinley Dorje stated he was unable to obtain in China the specialized instruction he needed to complete his studies and to realize his full spiritual authority. He has reside at Gyuto Monastery in Sidhbari, near Dharamshala up to 2017.https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/dharamsala- monastery-of-karmapa-closed-due-to-coronavirus-threat-53079 ===First trip to the US=== From May 15-June 2, 2008, the Karmapa made his first trip to the US, visiting New York City, Boulder, Colorado, and Seattle and was formally enthroned in the North American seat of the Gyalwang Karmapa at Karma Triyana Dharmachakra monastery in Woodstock, New York. He gave multiple teachings on compassion and the environment, gave the reading transmission for a new form of ng\u00f6ndro, and bestowed several empowerments, including those of Avalokite\u015bvara and Padmasambhava. He also spoke about the special challenges of the rapid pace of modern society, and the virtues of the Internet as a tool for the study and practice of Buddhism. ===India denying permission to visit monasteries=== In July 2008, he requested permission to visit monasteries in Lahaul and Spiti district in Himachal Pradesh and in Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir. The Government of India initially refused to allow these visits without giving a reason. It was speculated it was because these areas are close to the border with China and that the 2008 Summer Olympics was approaching even though the Karmapa had made it clear that he does not promote Tibetan independence and has no political stance on China.Tibetan spiritual leader not allowed to go near China border India eventually allowed his tour, which began in Ladakh, followed by Lahaul and Spiti, including the Tabo Monastery. Ogyen Trinley Dorje at age 14 ===Revisiting United States and visiting Europe=== Requests to revisit the United States and to visit Europe in 2010 were denied by the Indian government. On 9 July 2011, Ogyen Trinley Dorje returned to the United States for his second visit. From 9 to 17 July, he participated in the Kalachakra initiation bestowed by the 14th Dalai Lama in Washington, D.C., then traveled by train to his seat at Karma Triyana Dharmachakra and also visited his centers in both New Jersey and at Hunter College in New York City, returning to India on 4 August. During his visit, he taught extensively on compassion, gave Refuge, and bestowed the empowerments of both the Four-Armed and Thousand-Armed forms of Avalokite\u015bvara. He also granted an interview with Laurie Goodstein of The New York Times, which was published on 28 July 2011. ===Residing in US and becoming citizen of a Caribbean nation=== , Ogyen Trinley Dorje was residing in the United States https://www.buddhistdoor.net/news/karmapa-extends-stay-in-us-health-concerns- cited and had been outside of India continuously since May 2017. In 2018, to facilitate travel abroad, he became a citizen of the Caribbean nation Dominica https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/karmapa-now-a-dominican- citizen/695631.html] through a provision widely used which allows citizenship through investment.[https://www.imidaily.com/caribbean/likely-successor-to- dalai-lama-gets-dominica-citizenship-by-investment/ == Reconciliation == === 2018=== On 10 and 11 Oct 2018, in rural France, Ogyen Trinley Dorje (OTD) and Trinley Thaye Dorje (TTD) met each other in person for the first time. Trinley Thaye Dorje had been recognized and enthroned in 1994 as the Karmapa in a separate ceremony, by Shamar Rinpoche, two years after Ogyen Trinley Dorje was enthroned as the Karmapa. A joint statement by OTD and TTD was released on 11 October 2018, via their respective websites, and was circulated using social media outlets. The event was reported by numerous Buddhist and secular media sources. The event prompted several reactions, including statements of support from Gyalwang Drukpa, Goshir Gyaltsap Rinpoche, Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, Beru Khyentse Rinpoche, and Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche. On 28 October 2018, during a webcasted video address, Ogyen Trinley Dorje gave a further explanation about his recent meetings with Trinley Thaye Dorje in France and his reason and motivation for doing so.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_E4X0sh2mQ&t;=1846 OTD expressed how the Karma Kamtsang forefathers and disciples maintained and propagated the teachings through study, teaching, and practice; thus, generations of disciples were ripened through their wisdom, love, and power. Furthermore, OTD emphasized that whether reconciliation goes well or not does not depend upon only the two claimants, OTD and TTD. It depends on all the followers and the whole community of the Karma Kamtsang. === 2019 === On 27 October 2019, Ogyen Trinley Dorje and Trinley Thaye Dorje released a co- authored long-life prayer for Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche\u2019s reincarnation. This composition was published on OTD's and TTD's respective websites, and circulated via various websites and social media outlets. The unprecedented joint composition was widely circulated, and garnered the support of various Kagyu teachers and communities, including Drikung Kyabgon, Rumtek Monastery, and Karma Drubdey Nunnery. === 2020=== In February 2020, the Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje issued a statement at the 37th Kagyu Monlam in Bodh Gaya on the joint effort to search for and recognize the reincarnation of Shamar Rinpoche: \"It is extremely important that Shamar Rinpoche\u2019s reincarnation be recognized without any mistake or confusion, without any 'our side' or 'their side'. Having a unanimous recognition is absolutely crucial for Buddhism in general and our lineage in particular, and with this in mind, Gyalwa Thaye Dorje and I intend to cooperate in the search and recognition\". The Karmapa added, \"I see the reincarnation of Shamar Rinpoche as a crucial point for bringing unity to the Kamtsang, and am putting effort into it. If the reincarnation of Shamar Rinpoche is disputed, in the future, all the Kamtsang high lamas will be disputed and the Kamtsang will be completely split\", and \"The attachment and hatred will be the same as in a feud that lasts for generations. If we fall under its power, all the majesty and power of over nine hundred years of history will be destroyed.\"Tenzin Dharpo, Phayul Newsdesk, 10 February 2020, \"Two claimants to Karmapa title to jointly search for reincarnation of Shamar Rinpoche\", http://www.phayul.com/2020/02/10/42570/ == Dharma digitization == The Gyalwang Karmapa has undertaken the important and long-term task of digitizing Buddhist texts so that as many scriptures, commentaries, etc. are available in digital format as possible for future generations, students, scholars and monasteries around the world. There are four main websites \u2013 https://dharma-treasure.org Dharma Treasure, https://adarsha.dharma- treasure.org Adarsha, https://digital-toolbox.dharma-treasure.org Ketaka, and http://dharmaebooks.org Dharma Ebooks \u2013 each one dealing with a different format, tool, or translation. Adarsha, for example, makes the Kangyur, Tengyur, and Tibetan masterpieces available in digital format and has been catalogued under the guidance of the Gyalwang Karmapa. ==Tibetan culture, unity, language and literacy == For many years Gyalwang Karmapa has emphasized the importance of preserving Tibetan culture, unity, language, and literacy; underlining the importance of sustaining written and spoken the Tibetan language, because it is the very root of the Dharma in Tibet and its culture. Tibetan language is the lifeline that links Tibetans to their culture, arts, and spirituality. Tibetan culture, he states, is the mind and life force of the Tibetan people. Stressing the importance of Tibetan harmony and unity, Gyalwang Karmapa has implored all Tibetans to exercise religious tolerance, stating that all Buddhist traditions in Tibet come from one source, the Buddha, so the differences between them are not great. He has warned that it is a huge mistake to inflate small distinctions into a basis for attachment and hatred, asserting one\u2019s own tradition to be better than another\u2019s. He has said that the reason for any future decline of the Buddha\u2019s Dharma would not come from outside, but from within, from disputes between the holders of his teachings. Therefore, Gyalwang Karmapa has reiterated time and time again that the differences between lineages and factions are minor in terms of view, meditation, and conduct, and has urged everyone to keep a broader non-partisan perspective in mind. === 108 Translations === 108 Translations was initiated in 2015 by H.H. Karmapa Orgyen Trinley Dorje. Born of a concept developed during a translators\u2019 workshop held at Latse and presided over by Gyalwang Karmapa, the aim of the 108 Translations project is to produce a needed body of reading material that can promote the reinvigoration of Tibetan language. Rather than focussing on translating a few famous works that match the interests of a small group of well-educated readers (which has been the case for translations into Tibetan up to the present), 108 Translations aims to provide a plethora of good and easily accessible reading materials for average Tibetan readers. In his Statement of Purpose, Gyalwang Karmapa expressed that we are currently inhabiting a time where there is great concern that the Tibetan language will go extinct. He has said that we have come to the point where we need to take responsibility for the survival of the Tibetan language, and we are in a situation where there is very little reading material that matches the interests of the ordinary Tibetan reader. The main criteria for the 108 Translations is that they don't lose the meaning and feeling (or \"flavour\") of the original, the translations must be easy to understand and pronounce in Tibetan, and the selected works need to meet the interests of the readership. For example, translations of famous literary works that have low readership are examples of unsuccessful translations. 108 Translations must not only consider how well known the works are, they must also examine how they have sold, how many other languages they have been translated into, and so forth. Works with low sales are not selected, even if they are renowned. Over time, the hope is that future translations will grow ever closer to the interests of the readership. 108 Translations aims to nurture literacy in the Tibetan language, while giving Tibetan readers greater access to world literature. It is a project of Latse and is managed by the 108 Translations Management Team, whose combined skills and experience ensure the highest quality of translation. This project is also generously supported by Dharma Treasure and the ebooks will be published on dharmaebooks.org as well latse.org/program/108-translations. == Supporting the female Buddhist community == The Karmapa has taken a deep interest in the welfare of the female Buddhist community, as well as being a voice that regularly encourages equal rights and opportunities for women practitioners. He has, in particular, taken the responsibility to restore full ordination for Tibetan nuns. Each year the Karmapa hosts the dharma winter gathering where nuns receive special teachings, instructions and gather to debate Buddhist philosophy so as to further increase their opportunities for a traditional education.Arya Kshema === 2013=== On 14 September 2013, at the International Buddhist Confederation in New Delhi, Gyalwang Karmapa participated in a discussions with the Full Nun\u2019s Ordination Working Group, joining Co-Chairs Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo, Abbess of Dongyu Gatsal Ling Nunnery in India, and Ven. Dhammananda, Abbess of Wat Songkhammakalayani Temple in Thailand. === 2015=== On 24 January 2015, during the Second Arya Kshema Winter Dharma Gathering the Gyalwang Karmapa made the historical announcement that beginning next year [which was later changed to 2017 for astrological reasons], he would take concrete stepsGyalwang Karmapa explained that: \"over the last ten or twenty years, led by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, many of the masters of Tibetan Buddhism, including many high lamas, geshes, and khenpos, have engaged in discussions with good intentions. There have been many discussions, and people have put great effort into this\u2014I have seen and experienced this for myself. We\u2019ve had a lot of talk and research into the words of the Buddha, the treatises by Indian masters, as well as the Tibetan scriptures. It sometimes seems that over the past twenty years we\u2019ve only had talk and research, but we haven\u2019t actually put anything into practice. It\u2019s been like this for a long time.\" towards restoring nuns\u2019 vows in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. === 2016 === 22 January 2016, during the eighth day of teaching at the Arya Kshema Winter Dharma Gathering, the Gyalwang Karmapa discussed questions related to giving bhikshuni ordination to nuns. === 2017=== In a video address, Gyalwang Karmapa gave a brief summary of the history of buddhist nuns' ordination and in particular in the Tibetan buddhist tradition. The talk was part of the 4th annual Arya Kshema which took place in Bodhgaya, India.video address 10 March 2017, at the Mahabodhi Stupa, Bodhgaya, Bihar, India, eighteen women took the shramaneri vows. One additional woman would take the vows several days later on the auspicious fifteenth day of the Month of Miracles. == Buddhist vegetarianism == \"Gyalwa Karmapa\" (Ogyen Trinley Dorje), by painter Claude-Max Lochu, exhibition for the project of Temple for Peace in France, 2008 On January 3, 2007, Ogyen Trinley Dorje mandated a purely vegetarian diet in all his monasteries and centers and strongly urged vegetarianism among all his students, saying that generally, in his view, it was very important in the Mahayana not to eat meat and that, even in Vajrayana, it is preferable for students and practitioners not to eat meat.Talk on Vegetarianism, by Orgyen Trinle Dorje, Karmapa XVII, As Translated Simultaneously by Ringu Tulku Rinpoche 3 January 2007, Full Moon Day, During the 24th annual Great Kagyu Monlam, Bodhgaya, India == Buddhist environmentalism == Commenting on the Buddhist tradition of life release, where animals destined for slaughter are bought, blessed and natively released, Orgyen Trinley Dorje said the meaning of this concept was broad and that practitioners should use their intelligence to expand the tradition. Similarly, when addressing the 2007 Kagyu Monlam Chenmo, he indicated that planting a single tree can be more beneficial than performing life release for many beings; recommending that monasteries should plant one to two thousand trees. In addition he urged monks to practise restraint when sponsors offer technology upgrades.kagyumonlam.org: Kagyu Monlam Chenmo -- Teachings -- More Words on the Environment (2007/12/27) On Earth Day, on 22 April 2009, Orgyen Trinley Dorje gave 108 instructions on protecting the environment. At the second conference on environmental protection (3 to 8 October 2009, Gyuto Monastery), he stated \"For too long, people have behaved thoughtlessly and ignored the damage to the environment that they are creating and, if this continued there was a great danger that it would be too late to do anything.\" On 24 October 2009, Ogyen Trinley Dorje supported international climate action day at a gathering at McLeod Ganj in northern India. In recent years, Khoryug, a network of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and centers that work on environmental protection in the Eastern Himalayas, was developed under the auspices of Ogyen Trinley Dorje as part of the World Wildlife Fund's Sacred Earth: Faiths for Conservation program. In his April 2015 interview with Yale Environment 360, he said, \"The environmental emergency that we face is not just a scientific issue, nor is it just a political issue, it is also a moral issue. And therefore all of us approaching this issue have to pick up our share of the responsibility to find and implement solutions. The scientific aspect of it, of course, is the supply of information \u2014 the creation of models and predictions and the introduction of techniques that we can use to remedy this. But our share of this responsibility is to take what scientists teach us to heart, so we actually transform our way of life into one that is sustainable.\u201d\"For Buddhist Leader, Religion And the Environment Are One\" Interview with H.H. The Karmapa by Roger Rohn, Yale Environment 360, 16 April 2015. == Controversy == Mipham Chokyi Lodro, 14th Shamarpa (the second-longest recognized tulku lineage in the Karma Kagyu tradition, and who in previous incarnations is said to have held and transmitted the Kagyu lineage between Karmapas, did not recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje and instead proclaimed Trinley Thaye Dorje (), whom he purportedly identified a few years earlier than the recognition of Orgyen Thrinley Dorje in a dream as the true Karmapa. Shamarpa's camp argue until the reincarnation line of the Shamarpas was forbidden by the government of the Dalai Lama,see: Shamarpa#Controversy the successive Shamarpas were the persons in charge to recognize the Karmapas, whereas the Dalai Lamas played no role in the recognition.Prof. Geoffrey Brian Samuel in: \u201cAffirmation of Geoffrey Brian Samuel,\u201d Lama vs. Hope and Ors, CIV-2004404-001363, High Court of New Zealand Auckland Registry, 11 November 2004. Many of the previous Karmapas have left a letter stating the details of their rebirth to assist in the recognition of their future incarnation, and thus the Shamarpa's recognition through a dream has come under scrutiny. Shamarpa questioned the authenticity of the \"prophecy letter\" which the 16th Karmapa allegedly had written, and asked Situ Rinpoche for a forensic test of the letter, which Situ Rinpoche refused. Ogyen Trinley Dorje is supported by the majority of the Kagyu hierarchy, including two lamas who have played a role in finding previous Karmapas: Tai Situpa and Goshir Gyaltsab. A fourth such lama, the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul, died early on during the controversy. Ogyen Trinley Dorje was enthroned at Tsurphu Monastery. Other high Kagyu lamas who support Ogyen Trinley Dorje include the 9th Thrangu Rinpoche; the 7th Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche and his Nalandabodhi organization; the 12th Surmang Choseng Trungpa; the 7th Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche; the 3rd Tenga Rinpoche; Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche (abbot of Karma Triyana Dharmachakra); Sakyong Mipham and his organization, Shambhala Buddhism; Drupon Rinpoche and Lama Norlha Rinpoche. He is also recognized as Karmapa by both the current 14th Dalai Lama and the government of China. === 2011 police raid === In January 2011, the Himachal Pradesh Police seized money in currencies of 25 countries including China, valued at over 60 million, during raids on the offices of a trust backed by Ogyen Trinley Dorje. They also seized several traveler's cheques and land deal documents, suspecting a hawala scam. Initially, the police suspected the money was being used to spread Chinese influence in India, and that the Karmapa was a Chinese agent helping the Chinese government control Buddhist monasteries in India. They said even if the Karmapa was able to explain the source of the money recovered, he might be held liable for violating the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. The Karmapa denied all the allegations and said the seized money came via the donations from his followers. A New York Times report on the matter noted an unnamed rival Karmapa candidate has \"close ties to Indian intelligence officials\". On 11 February 2011, it was reported the central Indian government had cleared the Karmapa of all charges, finding the money in question had been donated by followers.\"India: Tibetan Lama Cleared in Cash Inquiry, Report Says.\" The New York Times, 11 February 2011.

Indian Express, 9 December 2011. Indian police said on Tuesday 24 April 2012 that they had dropped all criminal charges against Ogyen Trinley Dorje. ====Criminal proceedings==== A judge at the Himachal Pradesh High Court issued an order for authorities to open criminal proceedings over the recovery of around in foreign currency during a raid on his Buddhist monastery.
