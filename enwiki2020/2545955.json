He also won three Olympic medals at the 1900 Summer Olympics (Paris) and the 1920 Summer Olympics (Antwerp), his only gold medal coming in the mixed doubles partnering French legend Suzanne Lenglen.Photo with LenglenHistorical Dictionary of the Olympic Movement Page 97 Bill Mallon, Jeroen Heijmans \u2013 2011 \"Max D\u00e9cugis was the winner of a record six Olympic medals (four gold, one silver, one bronze) for lawn tennis between \u2026 Although the Olympic tournaments during that era attracted many of the world's top players, D\u00e9cugis's greatest .\" ==Life== Decugis' father was a merchant at Les Halles, the company's name was Omer D\u00e9cugis et fils,Journal des tribunaux de commerce Volume 38 Auguste Fran\u00e7ois Teulet, Eug\u00e8ne Camberlin, Paul Camberlin \u2013 1889 OMER D\u00c9CUGIS et fils et Cie \u2013 M.

The origin of the family name D\u00e9cugis, spelled with accented \u00e9 in an 1842 source, is \"from Cuges-les-Pins.\"\u00c9tienne Michel Masse M\u00e9moire historique et statistique sur le canton de la Ciotat Page 147 1842 \"L'expression chemin carr\u00e9 ne doit pas \u00eatre rendue par chemin charretier ; il n'y avait pas de charrette en ces temps-l\u00e0 ; nous avons m\u00eame lu plusieurs proc\u00e8s- (1 ) Le nom de famille D\u00e9cugis si commun dans nos contr\u00e9es n'est que celui de Cuges \u00e0 l'ablatif latin avec la pr\u00e9position de ; De Cugis , venant de Cuges , sorti de Cuges.\" In 1905 he married Marie Flameng, the daughter of painter Fran\u00e7ois Flameng, in Paris. After the death of Marie in 1969, Max married Suzanne Louise Duval in October. ==Career== Max Decugis playing at the Margitsziget court in Budapest, Hungary in 1908 Decugis won the French Championships in 1903, 1904, 1907, 1908, 1909, 1912, 1913, and 1914 (also 14 times in doubles and seven times in mixed). The interruption of World War I denied Decugis the opportunity to defend his 1914 title. Decugis was also a four-time runner-up, having lost the final in 1902, 1906, 1920, and 1923. He won the International German Championship in 1901 and 1902. In major tournaments, Decugis reached the semifinals of both the 1911 and 1912 Wimbledon Championships and the 1913 and 1914 World Hard Court Championships (WHCC) and the final of the World Covered Court Championship (WCCC) in 1919. He won the mixed doubles title at the WHCC on four occasions (1912, 1913, 1914, 1921) and at the WCCC on two (1913, 1919). In May 1910, Decugis twice defeated Anthony Wilding at Wiesbaden, first in the final of the Wiesbaden Cup in four sets, followed by a victory in the final of the Wiesbaden Championship in three straight sets. A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph ranked Decugis as World No. 10 in both 1913 and 1914.United States Lawn Tennis Association (1972).
