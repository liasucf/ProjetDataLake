Semmes Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas. Bachrach is the author of the textbook Computational Organic Chemistry. == Education == Bachrach earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana and a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. == Career == Bachrach is an Organic Chemist specialising in computational organic chemistry and began his career at Northern Illinois University, where he earned a Professorship. He spent 17 years at Trinity University, holding positions including the Dr D. R. Semmes Distinguished Professor of Chemistry, Chair of the Department of Chemistry, and Assistant Vice-President for Special Projects. He took up the position of Dean of Science in 2016 at Monmouth University. == Computational organic chemistry == Bachrach's illustration of , the dication of hexamethylbenzene Bachrach has written a textbook about computational organic chemistry, the second edition of which was published by John Wiley and Sons in 2014. Bachrach maintains a blog to provide supplementary materials for the textbook. For example, following the publication of the structure of the dication of hexamethylbenzene, , in Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Bachrach discussed its pyramidal geometry and six-coordinate carbon moiety in a blog post, demonstrating it is not hypervalent and explaining its three-dimensional aromaticity. == See also == * Roman M.
