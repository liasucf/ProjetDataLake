Kenny Barron Discography, accessed January 20, 2019 == Reception == In his review on Allmusic, Ron Wynn called it a \"Solid 1980 session with the always vibrant, challenging pianist Kenny Barron and the underrated saxophonist John Stubblefield in fiery form\" In JazzTimes David Zych wrote \"Golden Lotus, vintage 1982, has Barron shunning the electrics, opting now to let his fingers control the touch and nuance of the tunes he's interpreting. All the tunes are his own, save for a wonderful \"Darn that Dream,\" where Barron bares his soul with a gorgeous solo rendition of the ballad\".Zych, D., JazzTimes Review, accessed January 9, 2017 == Track listing == All compositions by Kenny Barron except where noted. # \"Golden Lotus\" \u2013 5:57 # \"Dewdrop\" \u2013 6:38 # \"Cincero\" \u2013 8:57 # \"Darn That Dream\" (Jimmy Van Heusen, Eddie DeLange) \u2013 9:16 # \"Row House\" \u2013 10:42 *Recorded at Downtown Sound Studio, NYC on April 4, 1980 (track 4) and Sound Heights Studio, Brooklyn, NY on April 18, 1980 (tracks 1\u20133 & 5) == Personnel == *Kenny Barron \u2013 piano *John Stubblefield \u2013 tenor saxophone (tracks 1\u20133 & 5) *Steve Nelson \u2013 vibraphone (tracks 1\u20133 & 5) *Buster Williams \u2013 bass (tracks 1\u20133 & 5) *Ben Riley \u2013 drums (tracks 1\u20133 & 5) == References == Category:Kenny Barron albums Category:1982 albums Category:Muse Records albums Category:Albums produced by Michael Cuscuna ",
