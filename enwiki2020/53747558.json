    "text": "\"Blood\" (stylized as \"BLOOD.\") is a song by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, from his fourth studio album Damn, released on April 14, 2017. The opening track on the album (fourteenth and final on the Collector's Edition of Damn), the song was written by Lamar, Daniel Tannenbaum, and Anthony Tiffith, and produced by B\u0113kon and Tiffith. == Composition == The track consists of Lamar telling a story in which he is shot by a blind woman he's trying to help. According to '' Genius, the woman represents the consequences that leads to Damnation from the Book of Deuteronomy. The intro is followed by audio of Fox News' reporters criticizing Lamar. Lamar himself has stated the intro as a struggle between wickedness and weakness, essentially the battle between good and evil. == Samples == The track contains an excerpt from Fox News' The Five members Eric Bolling, Kimberly Guilfoyle, and Geraldo Rivera criticizing Lamar's performance of \"Alright\" at the 2015 BET Awards. Lamar would later call out Rivera and Fox News on the album's third track, \"Yah\". == Critical reception == According to rap-up.com, the song is enough for one to say \"DAMN.\" (a play on the title of the album), and begs the listener to \"further analyze the flawed system [the song] dissects.\" == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from the official Damn digital booklet. *Kendrick Lamar \u2013 songwriter *Daniel Tannenbaum \u2013 songwriter *Anthony Tiffith \u2013 songwriter, producer *B\u0113kon \u2013 producer, additional vocals *Derek Ali \u2013 mixing *Tyler Page \u2013 mix assistant *Cyrus Taghipour \u2013 mix assistant == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 41 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseekers (Recorded Music NZ) | 1 |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==Certifications== == References == == External links == * Category:2017 songs Category:Kendrick Lamar songs Category:Songs written by Kendrick Lamar Category:Songs written by Daniel Tannenbaum ",
