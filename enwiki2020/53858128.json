    "text": "Pavitra Lokesh (born 1979) is an Indian film and television actress. She appears primarily in Kannada and Telugu films playing supporting roles. The daughter of stage and film actor Mysore Lokesh, she made her film debut at 16 and has since appeared in over 150 Kannada films. At 5 feet 10 inches she was the tallest actress at that time, but managing to do several noteworthy roles even acting against very shorter heroes. For her performance in the Kannada film Naayi Neralu (2006), she was awarded the Karnataka State Film Award for Best Actress. Her brother Adi Lokesh and husband Suchendra Prasad are actors. ==Early life== Pavitra was born in Mysore. Her father, Lokesh, was an actor and her mother, a teacher. She has a younger brother, Adi Lokesh. Her father died when Pavitra was in Class nine. Upon securing 80 per cent in her matriculation examination, she aspired to become a civil servant. However, following her father's death, she decided to help her mother who she said was \"overburdened with family responsibilities\". Initially reluctant to follow her father's footsteps towards a career in acting, she completed her bachelor's degree in commerce from SBRR Mahajana First Grade College, Mysore, and appeared for the Civil Services Examination. After failing to clear the examination in her first attempt, she took to acting before moving to Bangalore. ==Career== ===Films=== Pavitra took to acting in 1994 on the advice of actor Ambareesh. She made her debut in Mister Abhishek that saw the latter play the lead role. In the same year, she appeared in Bangarada Kalasha. Having not gained recognition from these films, Pavitra completed her graduation and began working for a human resource consulting company. During the time, T. S. Nagabharana offered her a role in his film Janumada Jodi that released in 1996. Speaking about the phase in a 2006 interview with The Hindu, she said, \"I never felt comfortable. I felt lonely. But when Nagabharana insisted, I had to take a decision. I resolved to make films my career - no preparation. The only reason to take a plunge was my circumstances. It has been tough to keep it going without a godfather or a guide. So I just accepted every film that came my way.\" Not being offered lead roles due to her tallness, she continued playing supporting roles. In the comedy Ulta Palta (1997), she played a vamp. Pavitra received critical acclaim for her performance in Girish Kasaravalli's period drama Naayi Neralu, a film based on S. L. Bhyrappa's novel of the same name. Impressed by her performance in the television soap Guptagamini, Kasaravalli cast her as a widowed Venkatalakshmi, daughter-in-law and mother of two other characters; the film revolving around these three characters living under one roof, and projecting their own perspectives exposing generation gap in a conflict-ridden society. Her portrayal of a woman caught between tradition and desire won her the Karnataka State Film Award for Best Actress. ===Television=== In Nagabharana's television soap Jeevanmukhi, she was cast as a middle-aged widow, a role that was received well. She received recognition for her role in the soap Guptagamini that was aired in the early 2000s. \"She played a wife, a mother and a sister caught in the web of human emotions\". During the time, she also appeared in other soaps such as Gelathi, Neethi Chakra, Dharitri, Punarjanma and Eshwari. ==Partial filmography== ===Kannada=== * Mister Abhishek (1995) * Bangarada Kalasha (1995) * Janumada Jodi (1996) * Ulta Palta (1997) * Tavarina Theru (1997) * Mavana Magalu (1997) * Kurubana Rani (1998) * Jagath Kiladi (1998) * Yajamana (2000) * Amma (2001) * Huchcha (2001) * Mussanje (2001) * Namma Samsara Ananda Sagara (2001) * Shivappa Nayaka (2001) * Naanu Naane (2002) * Makeup (2002) * Border (2003) * Raja Narasimha (2003) * Ondagona Baa (2003) * Bala Shiva (2003) * Ree Swalpa Bartheera (2003) * Namma Preethiya Ramu (2003) * Excuse Me (2003) * Vijayasimha (2003) * Swathi Muthu (2003) * Malla (2004) * Monda (2004) * Nija (2004) * Love (2004) * Rakshasa (2005) * Aakash (2005) * Gowramma (2005) * Shubham (2006) * Pandavaru (2006) * Student (2006) * Ee Rajeev Gandhi Alla (2007) * Naayi Neralu (2007) as Venkatalakshmi * Ee Preethi Onthara (2007) * Masti (2007) * Manasugula Mathu Madhura (2008) * Satya in Love (2008) * Mr. Garagasa (2008) * Moggina Jade (2008) * Mandakini (2008) * Savaari (2009) * Hatrick Hodi Maga (2009) as Durgi * Anishchitha (2010) * Hoo (2010) as Doctor Pavithra * Holi (2010) * Kanasemba Kudureyaneri (2010) * Kalgejje (2011) * Hori (2011) * Dudde Doddappa (2011) * Aata (2011) * Bete (2011) * Prarthane (2012) as Shanti * Gandhi Smiles (2012) * Barfi (2013) * Sneha Yathre (2013) * Gharshane (2014) * Rose (2014) * Bahaddur (2014) * Neenade Naa (2014) * Chirayu (2014) * Endendigu (2015) * Lodde (2015) * Dove (2015) * Ganga (2015) as Ganga's sister * Naanu Mattu Varalakshmi (2016) * Apoorva (2016) * Dia (2020) - Dr. Lakshmi, Adi's mother ===Telugu=== * Dongodu (2003) * Aalayam (2008 film) (2008) * Prasthanam (2010) as Mitra's mother * Baava (2010) as Veerababu's mother * Orange (2010) as Jaanu's mother * Shakti (2011) as Aishwarya's mother * Race Gurram (2014) as Ram and Lucky's mother * Rough (2014) as Chandu's Mother * Current Theega (2014) as Parvati * Lakshmi Raave Maa Intiki (2014) * Pataas (2015) as Kalyan's mother * Malli Malli Idi Rani Roju (2015) as Parvati * Temper (2015) as Lakshmi's mother * Tungabhadra (film) (2015) as Gowri's mother * Yevade Subramanyam (2015) as Rishi's mother * S/O Satyamurthy (2015) as Sharadha Sathyamurthy * Bengal Tiger (2015) * Pandaga Chesko (2015) as Karthik's mother * Bruce Lee - The Fighter (2015) as Karthik's mother * Loafer (2015) as Mouni's mother * Krishnashtami (2016) * Dictator (2016) as Rajashekar's wife * Speedunnodu (2016) as Lakshmi * Katamarayudu (2017) as Pavitra * Duvvada Jagannadham (2017) as DJ's mother * Jai Lava Kusa (2017) as Jai,Lava,Kusa's mother * Raja The Great (2017) as Gayatri * MCA (Middle Class Abbayi) (2017) as Warangal Siva's mother * Agnyaathavaasi (2018) as Kumari * Jai Simha (2018) as Vasantha * Sammohanam (2018) as Vijay's mother * Pantham (2018) as Durgadevi Surana * Tej I Love You (2018) as Tej's aunt * Saakshyam (2018) as Viswa's adopted mother * Happy Wedding (2018) as Anand's mother * Mr. Majnu (2019) as Vicky's aunt * Chitralahari (2019) as Swetcha's mother * Evaru (2019) as Adarsh Varma's mother * Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy (2019) as Neelamma * Choosi Choodangaane (2020) as Siddu's mother * Entha Manchivaadavuraa (2020) as Gayatri * Ashwathama (2020) as Gana and Priya's mother * Red (2020) ===Tamil=== * Ayogya (2019) as Bhavani's mother * Ka Pae Ranasingam (2020) ==Television== * Jeevanmukhi * * Eshwari (2004) * Swabhimaana * Olave Namma Baduku (2007) * Punnaga (2017\u2013) * Aramane Gili (2019 - present) ==Awards and nominations== ;Karnataka State Film Awards * 2005\u201306: Karnataka State Film Award for Best Actress \u2014 Naayi Neralu ;Filmfare Awards South * 2015: Nominated, Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Telugu \u2014 Malli Malli Idi Rani Roju ;South Indian International Movie Awards * 2015: Nominated, Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Telugu) \u2014 Malli Malli Idi Rani Roju ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:Kannada people Category:Actresses from Mysore Category:20th-century Indian actresses Category:21st-century Indian actresses Category:Indian film actresses Category:Indian television actresses Category:Actresses in Kannada cinema Category:Actresses in Telugu cinema Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Actresses in Telugu television Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
