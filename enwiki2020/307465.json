    "text": "The Andean Community (, CAN) is a free trade area with the objective of creating a customs union comprising the South American countries of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. The trade bloc was called the Andean Pact until 1996 and came into existence when the Cartagena Agreement was signed in 1969. Its headquarters are in Lima, Peru. The Andean Community has 98 million inhabitants living in an area of 4,700,000 square kilometers, whose Gross Domestic Product amounted to US$745.3 billion in 2005, including Venezuela, who was a member at that time. Its estimated GDP PPP for 2011 amounts to US$902.86 billion, excluding Venezuela. ==Membership== Member states The original Andean Pact was founded in 1969 by Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. In 1973 the pact gained its sixth member, Venezuela. In 1976 however, its membership was again reduced to five when Chile withdrew. Venezuela announced its withdrawal in 2006, reducing the Andean Community to four member states. Recently, with the new cooperation agreement with Mercosur, the Andean Community gained four new associate members: Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. These four Mercosur members were granted associate membership by the Andean Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in an enlarged session with the Commission (of the Andean Community) on July 7, 2005. This moves reciprocates the actions of Mercosur which granted associate membership to all the Andean Community nations by virtue of the Economic Complementarity Agreements (Free Trade agreements) signed between the CAN and individual Mercosur members. * Current members: ** (1969) ** (1969) ** (1969) ** (1969) * Associate members:In the framework of the Union of South American Nations and/or Mercosur-CAN cooperation agreements ** (2005) ** (2005) ** (2005) ** (2005) ** (2006) * Observer countries: ** ** * Former full members: ** (1973\u20132006), joined Mercosur ** (full member 1969\u20131976, observer 1976\u20132006, associate member since 2006) == Relationship with other organizations == The Andean Community and Mercosur comprise the two main trading blocs of South America. In 1999, these organizations began negotiating a merger with a view to creating a \"South American Free Trade Area\" (SAFTA). On December 8, 2004, the Andean Community (CAN) signed a cooperation agreement with Mercosur and they published a joint letter of intention for future negotiations towards integrating all of South America in a Union of South American Nations (USAN), patterned after the European Union. It was formally established by the May 23, 2008, Constitutive Treaty of the USAN signed in Bras\u00edlia. During 2005, Venezuela decided to join Mercosur. Venezuela's official position first appeared to be that, by joining Mercosur, further steps could be taken towards integrating both trade blocs. CAN Secretary General Allan Wagner stated that the Venezuelan Foreign Minister Al\u00ed Rodr\u00edguez had declared that Venezuela did not intend to leave the CAN, and its simultaneous membership to both blocs marked the beginning of their integration. However some analysts interpreted that Venezuela might eventually leave the CAN in the process. As Colombia and Peru signed free trade agreements with the United States, in protest the Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez indeed announced in April 2006 his country's withdrawal from the CAN, stating that the Community is \"dead\". Officials in Colombia and Peru expressed their disagreement with this view, as did representatives from Venezuela's industrial sector (Conindustria). In spite of this announcement, Venezuela still had not formally completed all the necessary withdrawal procedures. According to Venezuela's Commerce Minister Mar\u00eda Cristina Iglesias, the entire process was going to take up five years. Until then, Venezuela and its partners would remain bound by the effects of the community's preexisting commercial agreements. Exclusive Economic Zones of the member states of the Andean Community. Considering them, the total area of the Andean Community reaches the 6 573 757 km\u00b2. During a visit to Colombia in August 2007, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was asked by the presidents of Ecuador and Bolivia to rejoin the Andean Community, and he responded that he would agree. Meanwhile, at that time the Mercosur's relations with Venezuela were weakening as Mercosur was not agreeing with some of the Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's proposals. Eventually Venezuela achieved the full membership of the Mercosur in 2012, making the Mercosur bigger in number of members than the CAN for the first time. In addition to CAN, Bolivia is also a member of the WTO, UNASUR, and ALBA. Its attitude is considered crucial to relations between UNASUR and ALBA specifically, says Marion H\u00f6rmann, since Bolivia is traditionally seen as a mediator between the Andean countries and the rest of South America.Marion H\u00f6rmann, \"Key Role for Bolivia \" D+C Development and Cooperation, German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2010/03, 103\u2013105. Furthermore, in December 7, 2012, the Bolivian nation was accepted by the Mercosur countries to start the incorporation protocols to achieve the Mercosur full membership in a matter of 4 years, receiving the proclamation of an accessing member, and further consolidating itself as a strategic geopolitical nation. == History == Secretariat of the Andean Community in Lima *The groundwork for the Community was established in 1969 in the Cartagena Agreement *In 1973 Venezuela joins Andean Pact *In 1976, Augusto Pinochet withdrew Chile from the Andean Community claiming economic incompatibilities *In 1979, the treaty creating the Court of Justice was signed and the Andean Parliament created and the Andean Council of Foreign Ministers were created *In 1983, the treaty creating the Court of Justice entered into effect *In 1991, the presidents approved the open skies policy and agree to intensify integration *In 1992, Peru temporarily suspended its obligations under the Liberalization Program *In 1993, the Free Trade Zone entered into full operation for Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela *In 1994, the Common External Tariff was approved *In 1996, the Cartagena Agreement Commission approved the regulatory context for the establishment, operation, and exploitation of the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Satellite System *In 1997, an agreement was reached for Peru's gradual incorporation into the Andean Free Trade Zone *In 1998, the Framework Agreement for the creation of a Free Trade Area between the Andean Community and the Mercosur was signed in Buenos Aires *In 2000, a meeting of the South American Presidents, at which the Andean Community Heads of State and Mercosur decide to launch negotiations for establishing a free trade area between the two blocs as rapidly as possible and by January 2002 at the latest *In August 2003, the Andean Community and Mercosur Foreign Ministers, during a meeting in Montevideo at which the CAN delivered a working proposal containing guidelines for the negotiation, reaffirmed their governments' political determination to move ahead with the negotiation of a free trade agreement between the two blocs *In April 2006 President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez announced that Venezuela would withdraw from the Andean Community, claiming the FTA agreements signed by Colombia and Peru with the United States caused irreparable damage to the community *On 23 March 2017, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Andean Community and the Eurasian Union *On 21 February 2020, disputed interim president of Venezuela Juan Guaid\u00f3 announced Venezuela's reentry into CAN ==Organization== * Andean Presidential Council * Andean Foreign Relations Ministers Council * Commission * Headquarters (Lima, Peru) * Andean Court of Justice * Andean Parliament (Bogot\u00e1, Colombia) * Latin American Reserve Fund * Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Andean University ==Secretaries-General== * Sebasti\u00e1n Alegrett (Venezuela) 1997-2002 * Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez de Soto (Colombia) 2002-2004 * Edward Allan Wagner Tiz\u00f3n (Peru) 2004-2006 * Alfredo Fuentes Hern\u00e1ndez (Colombia), interim 2006-2007 * Freddy Ehlers (Ecuador), 2007Andean Community of Nations, 18 Jan 2007, Ecuadorian Freddy Ehlers is elected CAN Secretary General -2010Andean Community of Nations, 20 Apr 2010, Freddy Ehlers renuncia a la Secretar\u00eda General de la CAN * Adalid Contreras Baspineiro (Bolivia), interim 2010-2011, 2011-2013 Andean Community of Nations, 19 Feb 2013, Boliviano Adalid Contreras concluye su gesti\u00f3n como Secretario General de la CAN con un llamado a fortalecer la integraci\u00f3n * Pablo Guzm\u00e1n Laugier (Bolivia), 2013-2016 Andean Community of Nations, 15 Jun 2013, * Walker San Miguel (Bolivia), 2016-present Andean Community of Nations, 11 Jan 2016, ==Free flow of people== Since January 1, 2005, the citizens of the member countries can enter the other Andean Community member states without the requirement of a visa.
