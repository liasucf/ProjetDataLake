On the east shore of the loch lies the remains of an old boatshed. An accompanying Loch Kennard Lodge, that was constructed in 1870 for wealthy fishing parties, was removed when Griffin Forest was planted. ==Island== Loch Kennard contains a small island, almost circular, measuring some 18m long, north to the south bearing, by 16m wide, and possibly artificial, although not a crannog. The island contains the ruins of a building measuring some 1.7m high, 6.3m long, on a bearing of east to west bearing, by 3.4m wide, with walls almost 0.7m thick. The purpose of the building is unknown. ==References== Kennard Kennard Category:Tay catchment ",
