Proclus states the followingThomas Taylor, The Philosophical and Mathematical Commentaries of Proclus on the First Book of Euclid's Elements Vol. 1 (1788) in his Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements: > But Neoclides was junior to Leodamas, and his disciple was Leon; who added > many things to those thought of by former geometricians. So that Leon also > constructed elements more accurate, both on account of their multitude, and > on account of the use which they exhibit: and besides this, he discovered a > method of determining when a problem, whose investigation is sought for, is > possible, and when it is impossible. ==References== ==External links== * Category:ancient Greek mathematicians ",
