Jonathanson was the author of Klei Shir, a collection of poems and epigrams. Aaron Jonathanson was the great-great grandson of Jonathan Eybeschutz. His son, Jonas Jonathanson, was a contributor to the Yiddish periodical press in New York City under the pen name \"Kal va-\u1e24omer\". ==References== Category:1815 births Category:1868 deaths Category:Russian Hebraists Category:Hebrew-language poets Category:Imperial Russian Jews Category:Lithuanian Jews ",
