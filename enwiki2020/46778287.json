It was established on 7 January 1912 to store frozen bait, and in the 1930s moved into freezing fish. In 1970 Gunnv\u00f6r hf. and Hr\u00f6nn hf. became the main shareholders of the company, and in 1994 Gunnv\u00f6r acquired almost all the shares of the company. In 1999 Gunnv\u00f6r hf. and Hra\u00f0fystih\u00fasi\u00f0 hf. in Hn\u00edfsdalur merged under the name Hra\u00f0frystih\u00fasi\u00f0 Gunnv\u00f6r hf., and \u00cdsh\u00fasf\u00e9lag \u00cdsfir\u00f0inga became part of that company. ==1911\u201312: Foundation== Shipowners in \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur began to discuss formation of a public company to build an ice house to freeze and store bait for the fishing fleet in the fall of 1911. A meeting was held on 7 January 1912 at which it was agreed that the company should be a joint venture. 30 shareholders subscribed a total of ISK 4,700 at the meeting, and a board of directors was appointed to supervise construction of the ice house according to plans reviewed at the meeting. Construction was to be accelerated so ice could be stored in this first winter. The main purpose was to freeze and store herring and other bait, as well as to store food for people of the town and other customers. The company was allocated a plot at Fjar\u00f0arstr\u00e6ti, where the ice house was soon built. ==1912\u201337: From frozen bait to frozen fish== In the first few years of operations, as soon as ice had formed in the ponds, rivers and streams the ice was cut and transported to the ice house in a so-called snow box. The company bought its first freezer in 1929. In 1934 a new limited liability cod and herring fishing company named Huginn was launched under the leadership of Bj\u00f6rgvin Bjarnason, with the participation of several fishing industry companies in \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, including \u00cdsh\u00fasf\u00e9lag \u00cdsfir\u00f0inga, \u00cdsh\u00fasf\u00e9lagi\u00f0 J\u00f6kul and V\u00e9lb\u00e1ta\u00e1byrg\u00f0arf\u00e9lag \u00cdsfir\u00f0inga. Huginn had three boats built in Denmark, Huginn I, II and III. The first two were delivered in 1934 and the third the next year. During the Great Depression there was a fall in Icelandic fish sales. The Fisheries Commission was created in 1934 to initiate innovation in the industry. The commission encouraged fishermen to start quick-freezing their catch and began to research the market for frozen fish. The salt fish markets in Spain closed during the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339). \u00cdsh\u00fasf\u00e9lag \u00cdsfir\u00f0inga refurbished and renovated its freezers in 1936, and the company began shipment of frozen fillets to the United States in 1936\u201340. Three ice houses, \u00cdsh\u00fasf\u00e9lag \u00cdsfir\u00f0inga, J\u00f6kull and Gl\u00e1ma, merged in 1937 under the name of the first and quickly established a fast freezing operation. The company changed from a medium-sized operation that mostly supplied frozen bait to the local fishing fleet to a larger company that prepared food for foreign markets. ==Later mergers and acquisitions== In 1943 a group led by Gu\u00f0j\u00f3ns E. J\u00f3nssonar, a bank branch manager, acquired the majority of the company's share capital, which they held for several years. B\u00f6\u00f0var Sveinbjarnarson and J\u00f3n Kjartansson then bought the company, which they managed until 1952, when it was sold to an \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur buyer. In 1957 five companies in the town each bought 1/6 of the company, leaving 1/6 with the former owner. These were Gunnv\u00f6r hf., Hr\u00f6nn hf., Samvinnuf\u00e9lag \u00cdsfir\u00f0inga, Magni hf. and Togara\u00fatger\u00f0 \u00cdsafjar\u00f0ar hf. The acquisition by dynamic fishing fleet owners marked a transformation of the fishing industry. A substantial new building at Eyrarg\u00f6tu was opened in 1962. The next year the output of the company increased significantly, and in the later 1960s was processing 4,000 to 6,000 tons of fish per year. About 1970 Gunnv\u00f6r hf. and Hr\u00f6nn hf. became the main owners of the company. Raw materials for processing came from these owners and from the trawlers of J\u00fal\u00edusin Geirmundssyni and Gu\u00f0bj\u00f6rgu. In the 1970s these rose to 8,000 to 12,000 tons of fish per year, and the freezer house was expanded considerably. A prototype sampling machine was tested by the company in the autumn of 1980, and production of the machine began in 1981. The company saw a steep drop in processing in the 1980s. In 1990 it produced about 3,000 tons of frozen fillets from 7,000\u20138,000 tons of raw materials. In April 1991 P\u00e1ll P\u00e9tursson of Coldwater gave a quality award to \u00cdsh\u00fasf\u00e9lag \u00cdsfir\u00f0inga. The plant was highly productive and also had high quality levels. It had made the ICELANDIC brand well known for quality. From the start of 1990 \u00cdsh\u00fasf\u00e9lagi\u00f0 began fishing in partnership with other Hafd\u00eds line boat partners. In 1994, Gunnv\u00f6r acquired almost all of the company's share capital. In December 1994 \u00cdsh\u00fasf\u00e9lag \u00cdsafjar\u00f0ar and three other fishing and fish processing companies bought the 292-ton trawler Klara Sveinsd\u00f3ttir SU 50, with a quota of about 1,400 tonnes. In April 1995 they sold it to a Chinese shipowner based in New Zealand. By the late 1990s the fishing industry had suffered further declines, and the \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, Nor\u00f0urtanginn and \u00cdsh\u00fasf\u00e9lag \u00cdsafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur freezing houses closed down. According to the Gunnv\u00f6r hf. 2000 news release on its 1999 operations, in 1998 the company had a profit of ISK 39 million, rising to ISK 54 million in 1999. In 1999 the company had good results in salmon and whales, and poor result in shrimping. About 190 people worked at the Gunnv\u00f6r hf. freezing station. The merger with Hra\u00f0frystih\u00fasin hf. to form Hra\u00f0frystih\u00fasi\u00f0 \u2013 Gunnv\u00f6r hf. was approved in September that year. \u00cdsh\u00fasf\u00e9lag \u00cdsfir\u00f0inga hf. was merged into the company in December 1999. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * * Category:Shipping companies of Iceland Category:Food and drink companies established in 1912 Category:1912 establishments in Iceland Category:Food and drink companies disestablished in 1999 Category:1999 disestablishments in Iceland ",
