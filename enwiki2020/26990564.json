    "text": "The Simsbury Railroad Depot is a historic railroad station at Railroad and Station Streets in the center of Simsbury, Connecticut. Built in 1875, it is a distinctive example of a railroad station with Italianate styling. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 26, 1976. Presently, it houses a restaurant, called \"Plan B\". ==Description and history== The former Simsbury Railroad Depot stands on the east side of Simsbury's downtown area, on the east side of Railroad Street between Station Street and Phelps Lane. It is a narrow rectangular single-story brick building, oriented north-south, with the road to the west and the former railroad right-of-way to the east. The street-facing facade is divided into six bays, each slightly recessed with a band of brick corbelling at the top, and brick pilasters between. As built, there were three window bays, two pedestrian entrances, and a freight door in these bays; they have since been altered for use by the restaurant. Simsbury was first served by the Farmington Canal in 1826. The canal failed in 1846, and its route was overbuilt by a railroad line in 1850. This line provided service between New Haven and points further north on the Connecticut River. A second line was run through the town in 1871, connecting Hartford with Albany, New York. A station is documented as standing on this site in 1873, but the records of the Connecticut Western Railway indicate the present building was constructed in 1875. The styling is particularly unusual for the period, as most stations built at the time were wood frame structures that had more Gothic Revival elements. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford County, Connecticut ==References== Category:Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Italianate architecture in Connecticut Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1875 Category:Stations along New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad lines Category:Railway stations in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Historic district contributing properties in Connecticut Category:1875 establishments in Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures in Simsbury, Connecticut Category:Former railway stations in Connecticut ",
