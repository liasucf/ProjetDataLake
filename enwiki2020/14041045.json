    "text": "The Gixxer Kart (GSXR) is a shifter kart chassis with an air-cooled Suzuki GSX-R1100 cc engine. The famous kart came to be known worldwide, with videos spawning all over the web. The Gixxer Kart has a very impressive power-to- weight ratio. Weighing in at , with an average driver the kart has to push only 4 pounds per horsepower. By comparison, it has a better power-to-weight ratio than a Mclaren F1. After the birth of the shifter kart in 2002, many people decided to build their own motorcycle powered karts. Anything from a Honda CBR to a Yamaha R1 engine is used. Motorcycle powered karts, such as the Gixxer Kart, should only be driven on a closed circuit race track by professional drivers. With no protection such as seatbelt or Safety cage, it can be extremely dangerous. With an acceleration of 0\u2013100 km/h in under 3 seconds, and a top speed depending on gearing, usually 200 km/h (120 mph), the kart is extremely quick and requires adequate stopping power. The Top Speed is limited by the tires. The Donor kart used for the original conversion had front disc brakes, however, karts with only one rear disc have been used by other builders. Karts are usually stretched to fit the large 4-cylinder power plant, and solid mounts are usually welded in. Because the tires on a race kart are usually a small diameter, much of the power supplied by the motorcycle engine does not go to the ground, therefore it is unlikely to bend the chassis or break engine mounts if the kart is built strong. Karts are usually made of Cromoly tubing, therefore it is extremely important that Cromoly tubing be used to extend the chassis and proper welding is a must. Built by Achim Korden Germany 2002/10.
