    "text": "Ratko Pare\u017eanin () was Austrian, Yugoslav, British and Western German writer and journalist of Serb ethnic origin. == Family == The father of Ratko Pare\u017eanin, Vidak Pare\u017eanin, was Serb Orthodox priest hanged by the Austrians during the WWI. His mother Mileva gave birth to Ratko in Konjic, then in Austria-Hungary, on 24 February 1898. == Early life == Pare\u017eanin was the youngest member of the Young Bosnia movement whose roommate in Belgrade in one period was Gavrilo Princip. After the Assassination of Ferdinand on 28 June 1914, Par\u017eanin, who was 16 at that time, was arrested and put into Arad prison. == During the WWI == == Interwar period == In period between 1929 and 1933, Pare\u017eanin was an attach\u00e9 for journalists at Yugoslav embassy in Wien. In 1934 Pare\u017eanin was responsible for scholarly profile of newly founded Institute for Balkan Studies. Pare\u017eanin was director of the Institute since its founding in 1934 until it was disbanded by German occupying authorities in 1941. == During the WWII == When German occupying authorities approved publishing of the new daily newspaper \"Our Struggle\" () on 25 August 1941, Pare\u017eanin was appointed as its editor. === Mission in Montenegro === In the end of 1944 Milan Nedi\u0107 and Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107 sent Pare\u017eanin and 30 members of his mission to visit Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 and convince him to retreat to Slovenia and to use the retreat of the German troops to do so. Pare\u017eanin left Belgrade on 4 October 1944. He travelled via Ra\u0161ka, Prizren and Skadar to reach \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107's headquarter in mid-October. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 refused Pare\u017eanins proposal because he believed that German troops will remain in Montenegro. For some time Pare\u017eanin and 32 members of his mission stayed with \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 in his headquarter in Donja Gorica near Podgorica. When in mid-November 1944 German troops began their retreat to Sarajevo via Kola\u0161in, Prijepolje and Vi\u0161egrad, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107s Chetniks were concerned because they perceived German units as their support against the Communist forces. On 27 November 1944 \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107s troops were informed about the order of Mihailovi\u0107 who requested that all Chetnik forces should concentrate on the line Vi\u0161egrad - Fo\u010da - Gora\u017ede - Kalinovik in Bosnia and wait for Allied forces who were expected to penetrate into Bosnia after invading of the Adriatic coast. On the other hand, Pare\u017eanin continued to follow the plan set by Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107, to gather all national forces in Slovenia and with help of the Allies liberate Yugoslavia from Communist forces. That is why Pare\u017eanin insisted that \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 and his troops retreat to Slovenia. Germans refused the proposal of \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 to retreat together. At the end \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 decided to refuse proposal of Pare\u017eanin and decided to follow orders of Mihailovi\u0107 to retreat to Bosnia and wait for Allied forces with other Chetnik forces. Pare\u017eanin and his mission stayed in Montenegro for more than two months. At the beginning January, when Pare\u017eanin realised that he failed to convince \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 to follow Ljoti\u0107s plan, he and members of his mission split with \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107s forces in Prijepolje and Pare\u017eanin and his mission reached Slovenia on 15 January 1945, after travelling through Sarajevo, Slavonski Brod and Zagreb. In Slovenia they joined forces of Ljoti\u0107 and Nedi\u0107. According to some sources, Germans selected five groups of men among national forces, each with ten to forty members. They sent them to training for terrorist actions to Kaiserwald and Nojshterlitz. Pare\u017eanin was leader of one the groups. In March 1945, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 regretted because he chose the wrong retreat route stating:\"If I have followed advice of Pare\u017eanin I would already been in Slovenia with my people, probably even before \u0110uji\u0107. == Bibliography == Bibliography of Ratko Pare\u017eanin includes: * * * * == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * * Category:1898 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Yugoslav writers Category:Young Bosnia ",
