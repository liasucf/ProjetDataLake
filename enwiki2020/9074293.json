    "text": "Gloucester College, Oxford, was a Benedictine institution of the University of Oxford in Oxford, England, from the late 13th century until the Dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century. It was never a typical college of the University, in that there was an internal division in the college, by staircase units, into parts where the monasteries sending monks had effective authority.David Knowles, The Religious Orders in England vol. II (1955) p.14 calls it 'something of a patchwork' and (p.17) 'a loose confederation of small groups rather than a college.' The overall head was a Prior.Appointed by the Abbot of Malmesbury, but there was a regent master appointed by the provincial Benedictine presidents. (Knowles p.14) It later became Gloucester Hall, an annexe of St John's College and was again refounded in 1714 as Worcester College by Sir Thomas Cookes. ==History== The initial foundation was from 1283. John Giffard gave a house, in Stockwell Street, Oxford.Stockwell Street no longer exists, but it \"ran northwards from the Castle along the line of the present Worcester and Walton Streets\" (Nicholas de Stockwell, Oxford History). There was early friction with the local Carmelites.This persisted into the 16th century.The House of White Friars, Victoria County History, 1907. This was a donation to the Benedictines of the province of Canterbury. Control of the 13 places for monks fell to the abbey of St. Peter, Gloucester.Houses of Benedictine monks: Gloucester College, Oxford', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 2 (1907), pp. 70\u201371 Date accessed: 23 January 2007. The first prior was Henry de Heliun. Pope Benedict XII in 1337 laid down, in the bull Pastor bonus, that 5% of Benedictine monks should be university students.Knowles p.15. But from the middle of the fourteenth century onwards there was an alternative, at the University of Cambridge.Knowles p.17. There were also the Benedictine Durham College, Oxford, and Canterbury College, Oxford. Even though the catchment area after 1337 included the Province of York, numbers of students were never high, one reason being the cost of living in Oxford (which the home monastery had to meet). After the Black Death, Gloucester College was closed for a time. In 1537 it was found to have 32 students. At the Dissolution the property passed to the English Crown, then to the Bishop of Oxford in 1542,Jericho Echo Online. who sold it to Sir Thomas White. White was the founder of St John's College, Oxford, and Gloucester Hall, as it then became, was treated as an Annexe to St John's College. The penultimate Principal of Gloucester Hall, Benjamin Woodroffe, established a 'Greek College' for Greek Orthodox students to come to Oxford, part of a scheme to make ecumenical links with the Church of England. This was active from 1699 to 1705, although only 15 Greeks are recorded as members. The status of Gloucester Hall changed in the 18th century, when it was refounded in 1714 by Sir Thomas Cookes as Worcester College, Oxford. Oxford's Gloucester Green, which was opposite the old College, and the Gloucester House building within the current college preserve the name. ==Principals of Gloucester Hall== *1560\u20131561 William Stocke *1561\u20131563 Richard Eden *1563\u20131564 Thomas Palmer *1564\u20131576 William Stocke *1576\u20131580 Henry Russell *1580\u20131581 Christopher Bagshawe *1581\u20131593 John Delabere *1593\u20131626 John Hawley *1626\u20131647 Degory Wheare *1647\u20131647 John Maplett *1647\u20131660 Tobias Garbrand *1660\u20131662 John Maplett *1662\u20131692 Byrom Eaton *1692\u20131711 Benjamin Woodroffe *1712\u20131714 Richard Blechynden.'Gloucester Hall and Worcester College', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 3: The University of Oxford (1954), pp. 298-309.
