According to family tradition, when working for a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania firm Felix Grimes identified potential for coal mining and limestone quarrying around what became Hawesville in Hancock County and around what became Cannelton in Perry County, Indiana, and led 40 coal miners into Kentucky by barge down the Ohio River to those areas. Also by family tradition, Felix Grimes and his cousin Patrick Grimes led construction of the Indiana Cotton Mill factory on the north bank of the Ohio River in Cannelton, and they also led construction of the Roman Catholic church on the hill overlooking the factory, both built of local stone.
