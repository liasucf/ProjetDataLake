    "text": "Microbunodon was a genus of extinct artiodactyl mammals in the family Anthracotheriidae. It lived between the upper Eocene and the lower Pliocene (about 35\u20135 million years ago). Its fossil remains have been found in Europe and Asia. ==Description== Microbunodon, unlike most of its close relatives, was small in size and with a slight build. Its weight did not exceed 20\u201325 kilograms and the skull was about 20\u201330 centimeters long. Microbunodon was slim with long legs and a short snout with long prominent canine teeth in males, similar to a saber-toothed cat. It was characterized by a fused mandibular symphysis, with a ventral ridge-like prominence. ==Classification== The genus Microbunodon was established by Deperet in 1908Dep\u00e9ret, C., 1908: L'histoire g\u00e9ologique et la phylog\u00e9nie des anthracoth\u00e9riid\u00e9s. Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des S\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, Paris, vol. 146, p. 158\u2013162. to accommodate a species previously described by Georges Cuvier in 1822 and attributed to the genus Anthracotherium, as A. minimum,Cuvier, G., 1822: Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles, o\u00f9 l'on r\u00e9tablit les caract\u00e8res de plusieurs animaux, dont les r\u00e9volutions du globe ont d\u00e9truit les esp\u00e8ces, 412 p. G. Dufour et E. d'Ocagne, Paris. from the Oligocene superior of France. The type species, Microbunodon minimum, lived in the Oligocene in Europe and is known in France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Turkey. Other species attributed to this genus are M. silistrensis (early and middle Miocene, Indian subcontinent and Indochina) and M. milaensis (late Miocene and early Pliocene, Indian subcontinent and Indochina). Other fossils attributed to this genus come from the upper Eocene of China and testify to an exceptional longevity of this evolutionary line (Tsubamoto, 2010). Microbunodon is an anthracothere, a group of artiodactyls usually considered similar to hippopotami. Microbunodon represents an aberrant morphology for this family, whose members usually have large, heavy shapes. Microbunodon and Anthracokeryx have been placed in a separate subfamily, Microbunodontinae.Lihoreau F, Ducrocq S. 2007. Family Anthracotheriidae. In: Prothero DR, Foss SE, editors. The evolution of artiodactyls. Baltimore(MD): The Johns Hopkins University Press; p. 89\u2013105. == Paleobiology== Analysis of dental wear of Microbunodon reveals that it probably had a diet based on leaves and fruit (Lihoreau, 2003). It likely lived in forest environments and had a lifestyle quite similar to that of musk deer and mouse deer. It is likely that it originated in Asia in the Eocene. At the end of the Oligocene, Microbunodon migrated to Europe and spread rapidly, along with other Artiodactyls. This event is known as the Microbunodon event, due to the significant impact that the invasion of these animals had on European fauna of the period (Scherler et al., 2013; Mennecart, 2015). ==References== *H\u00fcnermann, K.
