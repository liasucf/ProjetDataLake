    "text": "Princess Louise of Denmark and Norway (; ) (20 January 1750 \u2013 12 January 1831) was born to Frederick V of Denmark and Louise of Great Britain. Her eldest daughter, Marie of Hesse-Kassel, was the wife of Frederick VI of Denmark. == Life == Portrayed in 1772 She married Landgrave Charles of Hesse-Kassel on 30 August 1766 at Christiansborg Castle, in Copenhagen, with her brother King Christian VII's consent. This was despite advice given against it, due to many accusations of debauchery by Landgrave Charles and the poor influence he had on the King. This, however, did not last, as Christian VII's warm feelings for him soon evaporated, and in the spring 1767, the couple left Copenhagen to live in Hanau. She would have her first child in Hanau, Marie Sophie, Princess of Hesse on 20 October 1767 and then her second, Wilhelm, Prince of Hesse on 20 January 1769. The family would then move to Gottorp Castle after her spouse was appointed governor of Schleswig Holstein. In 1770, King Christian VII gave his sister a parish and land in G\u00fcby, Schleswig-Holstein, which was named Louisenlund in her honour. In the summer of 1770, Louise and Charles hosted the king and queen during their tour of the Duchies on their way to the German border.August Fjelstrup: Damerne ved Karoline Mathildes Hof, 1909. During their stay, rumors circulated about the affair between the queen and Struensee because of their manner, and it was observed that the queen was anxious not to be near Struensee in the presence of Louise. When the royal couple left, Louise was reportedly disappointed that she was not asked to accompany them on their journey. She would have her third child Prince Frederik of Hesse on 24 May 1771. Louisenlund Castle After the removal and execution of Johann Friedrich Struensee on 28 April 1772 her husband found favour with the King again and with it, he was appointed Governor of Norway in September 1772. It was said that Charles planned to raise support in Norway for a coup to take the regency power over the king from prince Frederick and queen dowager Juliana.Det gamle Christiania, 1624-1814 Louise did not initially accompany him there, but when he returned to Denmark in April 1773, she returned with him to Norway in June. They were very well received in Christiania, and upon their arrival in Trondhjem, one aristocrat, Nordahl Brun, welcomed them as the \"heavenly couple\", and greeted Louise with a poem.Det gamle Christiania, 1624-1814 In the Landgrave's own words, he became so popular that the Norwegians would gladly have him as King. This was clearly an illusion, and the people of Christiania soon found the cost of constantly entertaining the couple, a huge burden on town expenses. Expensive demands, such as new golden chairs to sit in during church service, and a triumphal arch for the official entry of Louise in to Christiania where examples of the standard the royal couple demanded for their standard during their stay and created antipathy among the population.Det gamle Christiania, 1624-1814 On 4 September, Louise and Charles hosted a ball and a court reception in honor of the birthday of queen Juliana Maria and departed on 8 September 1773.Det gamle Christiania, 1624-1814 With her husband's larger income, he had Hermann von Motz build Louisenlund Castle on the land in G\u00fcby as a summer residence for the couple. The Princess would have her fourth child Juliane, Princess of Hesse on 19 January 1773 before leaving Norway and moving into Louisenlund Castle in 1774. Her husband was also made Field Marshal the same year but would stay away from political circles and remain at Louisenlund till the 14th change of government in April 1784. The new change brought a close friendship with Crown Prince Frederik, who would also marry their daughter Princess, Marie Sophie. They would later become King Frederick VI of Denmark and Queen Marie Sophie of Denmark. Princess Louise would have two more children, Prince Christian of Hesse, born 14 August 1776 and Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel, born 28 September 1789. Her husband continued as Governor of Norway and Schleswig Holstein all her life. She died at Gottorp Castle on 12 January 1831 and was buried in Schleswig Cathedral. ==Ancestry== == Children == She had 6 children together with her husband, they are: # Marie Sophie, Princess of Hesse (20 October 1767 \u2013 21 March 1852), married on 31 July 1790 to the future King Frederik VI of Denmark # Wilhelm, Prince of Hesse (15 January 1769 \u2013 14 July 1772) # Prince Frederik of Hesse (24 May 1771 \u2013 24 February 1845) # Juliane, Princess of Hesse (19 January 1773 \u2013 11 March 1860), Protestant Abbess of Itzehoe # Prince Christian of Hesse (14 August 1776 \u2013 14 November 1814) # Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Kassel (28 September 1789 \u2013 13 March 1867), married on 28 January 1810 to Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg == References == == Sources == === Books === === Online === == External links == Category:House of Oldenburg Category:Danish princesses Category:Norwegian princesses Category:1750 births Category:1831 deaths Category:Landgravines of Hesse-Kassel Category:House of Hesse-Kassel ",
