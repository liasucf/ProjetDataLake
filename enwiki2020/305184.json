    "text": "In some operating systems, the null device is a device file that discards all data written to it but reports that the write operation succeeded. This device is called `/dev/null` on Unix and Unix-like systems, `NUL:` or `NUL` on CP/M and DOS (internally `\\DEV\\NUL`), `nul` on newer Windows systems (internally `\\Device\\Null` on Windows NT), `NIL:` on Amiga operating systems, and `NL:` on OpenVMS. In Windows Powershell, the equivalent is `$null`. It provides no data to any process that reads from it, yielding EOF immediately. In IBM DOS/360, OS/360 (MFT, MVT), OS/390 and z/OS operating systems, such files would be assigned in JCL to `DD DUMMY`. In programmer jargon, especially Unix jargon, it may also be called the bit bucket or black hole. ==History== According to the Berkeley UNIX man page, Version 4 Unix, which AT&T; released in 1973, included a null device. ==Usage== The null device is typically used for disposing of unwanted output streams of a process, or as a convenient empty file for input streams. This is usually done by redirection. The `/dev/null` device is a special file, not a directory, so one cannot move a whole file or directory into it with the Unix `mv` command. == References in computer culture == This entity is a common inspiration for technical jargon expressions and metaphors by Unix programmers, e.g. \"please send complaints to `/dev/null`\", \"my mail got archived in `/dev/null`\", and \"redirect to `/dev/null`\"\u2014being jocular ways of saying, respectively: \"don't bother sending complaints\", \"my mail was deleted\", and \"go away\". The iPhone Dev Team commonly uses the phrase \"send donations to `/dev/null`\", meaning they do not accept donations. The fictitious person name \"Dave (or Devin) Null\" is sometimes similarly used (e.g., \"send complaints to Dave Null\"). In 1996, Dev Null was an animated virtual reality character created by Leo Laporte for MSNBC's computer and technology TV series The Site. Dev/null is also the name of a vampire hacker in the computer game Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Redemption. A 2002 advertisement for the Titanium PowerBook G4 reads The Titanium Powerbook G4 Sends other UNIX boxes to /dev/null. The null device is also a favorite subject of technical jokes, such as warning users that the system's `/dev/null` is already 98% full. The April Fool's, 1995 issue of the German magazine c't reported on an enhanced `/dev/null` chip that would efficiently dispose of the incoming data by converting it to a flicker on an internal glowing LED. == See also == * Filesystem Hierarchy Standard * Memory hole * rm (Unix) * Standard streams * Unix philosophy * Write-only memory * * * == References == Category:CP/M technology Category:Unix file system technology Category:Device file Category:Computer humor ",
