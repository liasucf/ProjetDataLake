    "text": "Katherine Albrecht is a consumer privacy advocate and spokesperson against radio-frequency identification (RFID). Albrecht devised the term \"spy chips\" to describe RFID tags such as those embedded in passport cards and certain enhanced United States driver's licenses. Katherine Albrecht holds a Doctor of Education degree from Harvard University. She is a resident of Nashua, New Hampshire. Albrecht was interviewed about RFID chips in Aaron Russo's 2006 documentary America: From Freedom to Fascism. ==Publications== ===Books=== Albrecht and Liz McIntyre (CASPIAN's communications director) co-authored the book Spychips: How Major Corporations and Government Plan to Track Your Every Move, which won the November 2005 Lysander Spooner Award for advancing the literature of liberty. The book lays out the potential implications of RFID on privacy and civil liberties. RFID industry representatives have criticized it, claiming the authors exaggerate some RFID privacy threats. In a lengthy rebuttal, Albrecht asked why critics don't \"mention sworn patent documents from IBM describing ways to secretly follow innocent people in libraries, theaters, and public restrooms through the RFID tags in their clothes and belongings? Where is [\u2026] outrage over BellSouth's patent-pending plans to pick through our garbage and skim the data contained in the RFID tags we discard?\"Albrecht, Katherine, Dismantling the RFID Journal's critique of spychips , spychips.com, 14 November 2005, retrieved 21 January 2008 ===Articles and papers=== * Albrecht, Katherine. \"Supermarket Cards: The Tip of the Retail Surveillance Iceberg.\" Denver University Law Review, Volume 79, Issue 4, Summer 2002. pp. 534\u2013539 and 558\u2013565. * Position Paper on the Use of RFID in Consumer Products.
