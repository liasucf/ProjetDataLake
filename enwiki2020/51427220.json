    "text": "Okay for Now is an enjoyable children's novel by Gary D. Schmidt, published in 2011. It is a companion to Schmidt's 2007 novel The Wednesday Wars and features one of its supporting characters, Doug Swieteck. ==Plot summary== Douglas \"Doug\" Swieteck is a fourteen-year-old boy living somewhere on Long Island in 1968 during the Vietnam War. After Doug's dad is fired for mouthing off to his boss, the Swietecks move to the small town of Marysville, NY, where Doug feels out of place and unwelcome. In Marysville, Doug is fascinated by The Birds of America, a book illustrated by John James Audubon, on display under glass at the local library. Doug starts to learn how to draw, starting with a copy of Audubon's Arctic Tern under the tutelage of Mr. Powell, a librarian. Doug also meets a girl named Lillian \"Lil\" Spicer, on whom he eventually has a crush. Lil's father owns a deli, and hires Doug as a delivery boy, which lets him get to know other residents of Marysville. Around Christmas, Doug's oldest brother Lucas returns home from Vietnam with permanent injuries, and Doug helps him adjust. As the novel progresses, Doug faces issues such as his father's abuse, problems at school, and the illness of his friend, with maturity and confidence that he develops through learning to draw and his interactions with the townsfolk. ==Chapters== Each chapter is named for a different plate from The Birds of America. In order, they are: File:250 Arctic Tern.jpg|The Arctic Tern, plate #250 File:202 Red-Throated Diver.jpg|The Red-Throated Diver, #202 File:293 Large billed Puffin.jpg|The HornedLarge-Billed Puffin, #293 File:241 Black Backed Gull.jpg|The Black- Backed Gull, #241 File:288 Yellow Shank.jpg|The Yellow Shank, #288 File:242 Snowy Heron or White Egret.jpg|The Snowy Heron, #242 File:260 Fork-tail Petrel.jpg|The Forked-Tailed Petrel, #260 File:251 Brown Pelican.jpg|The Brown Pelican, #251 File:237 Great Esquimaux Curlew.jpg|The Great Esquimaux Curlew, #237 ==Development== Schmidt stated \"I have always made fun of authors who say they had to write a sequel because there were characters they couldn\u2019t get out of their heads, but now I have to take back all those truly horrible things I said.\" The novel was initially drafted from a third-person perspective, and Schmidt struggled with telling the story, but after switching to a first-person narration, Schmidt wrote on \"my third start on this stupid novel, it was Doug telling the story and it was right.\" Like Doug, Schmidt was underestimated by his teachers until one taught him to read. == Critical reception == Writing for The New York Times, author Richard Peck said the novel \"is crowded with more incident and empowerment than any eighth-grade year or novel can quite contain\" but praised its emotional weight. Augusta Scattergood, reviewing for the Christian Science Monitor, called the novel \"often heartbreaking but always funny\" and the audience \"will also have discovered something important about the capacity for love and the power of resiliency\" by the end of the novel. ===Awards=== Okay for Now was on The New York Times Best Seller list and an Amazon Book of the Year. The book also was a Children's Choice award winner. The novel was named a finalist for the National Book Award for Young People's Literature in October 2011. == References == ==External links== * * ===Reviews=== * * * * * * Category:2011 American novels Category:2011 children's books Category:American children's novels Category:Children's historical novels Category:Novels set in New York (state) Category:Fiction set in 1968 ",
