The D275 goes from the village south-east to Bergbieten. The commune is mostly farmland but with large forests north of the D75 in the west of the commune.Google Maps Le Schleithal river flows south through the forests in the west and continues south through the commune to join the Bruche at Dinsheim-sur-Bruche.

The church is very old. Inside it is a headstone from 1574 containing the remains of Jean de Mittelhausen and his wife Barbe Hufel. In the forests in the west of Balbronn there was once a village called Elbersforst which was in a large clearing in the forest where there is now the Auberge d'Elemerforst. A plaque indicates that the place is the property of the Notre Dame works. Stones from the old village can still be seen above the restaurant patio. These are the old foundations of several buildings of what was formerly called Elbersforst. Since 2007 this medieval town has been the subject of archaeological excavations. Elbersforst was part of Westhoffen which depended on Marmourtier Abbey. ===Heraldry=== ==Administration== List of Successive MayorsList of Mayors of France {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! From !! To !!

The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.At the beginning of the 21st century, the methods of identification have been modified by Law No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002 , the so-called \"law of local democracy\" and in particular Title V \"census operations\" allows, after a transitional period running from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts. For communes with a population greater than 10,000 inhabitants, a sample survey is conducted annually, the entire territory of these communes is taken into account at the end of the period of five years. The first \"legal population\" after 1999 under this new law came into force on 1 January 2009 and was based on the census of 2006. ==Culture and heritage== ===Civil heritage=== The commune has many buildings and sites that are registered as historical monuments: *A Jewish House (1628) at 47-48 Rue BalbachMinistry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e *Farmhouses (14th-19th century)Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e *A Chateau at Rue du Chateau (15th century)Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e *The Town Hall/School at 63 Place de la Mairie (1897)Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e *A Protestant School at 170 Place du Pasteur-Albert-Kiefer (1834)Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e *A Merchant's House at 29 Rue des Tonneliers (19th century)Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e *A Forester's House at Elmersforst (1755)Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e ===Religious heritage=== The commune has several religious buildings and structures that are registered as historical monuments: *A Synagogue (disused) at Rue des Femmes (1895)Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e *A Protestant Presbytery 173 Rue du Foss\u00e9 (1732).Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e The Presbytery contains 2 communion ewers (18th century) which are registered as an historical object.Ministry of Culture, Palissy *A Protestant Church at Place du Pasteur-Albert-Kiefer (12th century)Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e *The Parish Church of Saint-Catherine at Rue de Westhoffen (20th century)Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e The church contains many items that are registered as historical objects: **The Furniture in the ChurchMinistry of Culture, Palissy **A Chalice with Paten and Spoon (19th century)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **A Painting: Saint Catherine (19th century)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **A Eucharistic Cabinet (1453)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **A Baptismal font (1687)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **The main Altar (19th century)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **3 Stained glass windows (1905)Ministry of Culture, Palissy **A Monumental Cross (18th century)Ministry of Culture, Palissy *The Interdenominational Cemetery at Rue de Westhoffen (1882)Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e *The Church and Cemetery of Balbronn (12th century).Ministry of Culture, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e The Cemetery contains a Cemetery Cross (19th century) which is registered as an historical object.Ministry of Culture, Palissy ==Notable people linked to the commune== *Louis Albert Kiefer, pastor from 1873 to 1913, the date of his death, author of the book: Die geschichte balbronn, 1894. ==See also== *Communes of the Bas-Rhin department ===External links=== *Balbronn on the old National Geographic website *Regional Directorate of the Environment, Sustainable development, and Lodgings (DREAL) website *Balbronn official website *Balbronn on Lion1906 *Balbronn on G\u00e9oportail, National Geographic Institute (IGN) website *Balbronn on the 1750 Cassini Map ==Notes and references== ===Notes=== ===References=== Category:Communes of Bas-Rhin ",
