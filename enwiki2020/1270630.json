It is near the center of Vienna and was established as a district in 1850. Mariahilf is a heavily populated urban area with many residential buildings. Wien.gv.at webpage (see below: References). Vienna Districts data, wien.gv.at, 2008, webpage: [https://www.wien.gv.at/statistik/pdf/bezirksportraets08.pdf wien.gv.at- portraets08-PDF] . It has a population of 31,621 (as of 2016-01-01) within an area of . == Location== Mariahilf is located southwest of Vienna's centre (1st district). In the north, Mariahilfer Stra\u00dfe, Vienna's most important shopping street, is its border with Neubau, in the south, the valley of the Vienna River, in the west, the G\u00fcrtel beltway. It consists of the five neighbourhoods (historical Vorst\u00e4dte, i.e. towns): Mariahilf, Gumpendorf, Windm\u00fchle, Magdalenengrund and Laimgrube. == History == First settlements around the Roman roads of the area developed around the year 1000. In 1428, the name Im Sch\u00f6ff is mentioned for the first time, but this name was lost when the copy of a sacral painting from Passau was installed in a chapel of the graveyard, which came to be known as Mariahilf (\"Mary's help\"). More intensive settlement started only after the Second Turkish Siege of Vienna in 1683. The area was of some importance because the road to Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace led through it. Gumpendorf was mentioned in 1130 for the first time and developed from a Roman watchtower. It was subject to various feudal lords and was sold to the municipality of Vienna in 1798. Magdalenengrund was originally known as Im Saugraben an der Wien auf der Gst\u00e4tten (\"In the sow pit on the Wien on the meadow\") and consisted only of vineyards. In 1698, some plots were released for construction. The Laimgrube (clay pit) is probably the oldest part of Mariahilf. It was mentioned in 1291 for the first time, but has existed already since the 11th century. Its name is derived from the clay soil, which was used to produce bricks. Windm\u00fchle (windmill) developed from a feudal holding used by various monastic orders. In 1529 it was destroyed during the First Turkish Siege. Emperor Ferdinand I had the ownership transferred to Johann Francolin, subject to the condition that he should build windmills there. However, he had only one mill built. On March 6, 1850, the five Vorst\u00e4dte of Gumpendorf, Mariahilf, Windm\u00fchle, Magdalenengrund and Laimgrube became part of Vienna as the Fifth District, Mariahilf. When Wieden was split into two districts in 1861, it became the 6th District. In 1862, some areas north of Mariahilfer Stra\u00dfe were ceded to the 7th District (Neubau). Towards the end of the 19th century, Mariahilf had developed to become an important business district of Vienna. The Mariahilfer Strasse was a major shopping street; however, the big department stores were beyond the district boundary, over in the 7th District. The Mariahilfer area influenced the roads for mainly small and medium-sized businesses. Between 1890 and 1907, the Kaunitzgasse steam power plant became one of the first electricity works in Vienna. Following the acquisition of the originally privately operated power plant, by the municipality of Vienna, it was decommissioned and converted into a substation. \"Erinnern f\u00fcr die Zukunft\" (Remembrance for the Future) is a memorial project for the many residents of Mariahilf district who were murdered by the Nazi dictatorship in the 1938-1945 period. Mariahilf is home to many of Vienna's gay and lesbian residents and contains a sizable concentration of bars, clubs, restaurants and shops catering to the community, along with the Rosa Lila Villa community center. In the 1990s, there were two minor changes in the district boundaries: in 1995 in the area of the belt on the border at the 15th District, and 1996 in the Europe Square in front of the West Railway Station, where the 6th, 7th and 15th District meet. Both border changes affected mainly the transport structures. The district affiliation of residential areas did not change. == Population == {| Border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left: 1em;\" |- | Population Change Data from Statistik Austria # Source of data: Statistik Austria Colors = id:hellgrau value:gray(0.7) id:dunkelgrau value:gray(0.9) ImageSize = width:300 height:auto barincrement:27 PlotArea = left:40 right:20 bottom:25 top:10 AlignBars = justify DateFormat = yyyy Period = from:0 till:70000 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMajor = gridcolor:hellgrau unit:year increment:20000 start:0 ScaleMinor = gridcolor:dunkelgrau increment:5000 start:0 PlotData= color:skyblue width:20 shift:(20,-4) fontsize:S bar:1869 from:start till:67642 text:\"67,642\" bar:1880 from:start till:64535 text:\"64,535\" bar:1890 from:start till:64323 text:\"64,323\" bar:1900 from:start till:62212 text:\"62,212\" bar:1910 from:start till:64670 text:\"64,670\" bar:1923 from:start till:54540 text:\"54,540\" bar:1934 from:start till:49785 text:\"49,785\" bar:1939 from:start till:44866 text:\"44,866\" bar:1951 from:start till:46372 text:\"46,372\" bar:1961 from:start till:41216 text:\"41,216\" bar:1971 from:start till:33633 text:\"33,633\" bar:1981 from:start till:28771 text:\"28,771\" bar:1991 from:start till:30298 text:\"30,298\" bar:2001 from:start till:27867 text:\"27,867\" bar:2006 from:start till:29523 text:\"29,523\" |} === Population development === The Mariahilf District was already, after its 1850 founding, very densely populated.

While the \u00d6VP commanded the majority in the years after the Second World War until 1969, it lost the district to the SP\u00d6 in that year. After the SP\u00d6 lost the majority again in 1978, the \u00d6VP was able to dominate the following elections. When the Greens entered the district politics in the late 80s, the \u00d6VP and SP\u00d6 started to rapidly lose votes. The competition with the Liberal Forum (LIF) in 1996 had a similar effect. The \u00d6VP also lost heavily in the elections of 2001. The SP\u00d6, after the losses of 1996, was able to compensate for its former losses and reclaimed the majority in the district. In 2001 the Greens came in a close third to the \u00d6VP, whereas the Liberal Forum and the FP\u00d6 suffered heavy losses. In the 2005 elections, the trend continued: The FP\u00d6 lost heavily in the vote again and the Liberal Forum lost their seat on the district council, whereas the SP\u00d6 and the Greens gained more votes. In 2005 the Greens came in second for the first time and thus attained the office of deputy district director. In the elections of 2010, the Greens and the \u00d6VP suffered heavy losses, while the SP\u00d6, FP\u00d6 and BZ\u00d6 gained more votes. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=center style=\"margin-left:1em;\" |+ District Political Parties 1991-2010 Stadt Wien |- style=\"background-color:#F1D888\" |Jahr |SP\u00d6 |\u00d6VP |FP\u00d6 |Gr\u00fcne |LIF |BZ\u00d6 |Sonstige |- |align=\"center\"|1991 |align=\"center\"|30.2 |align=\"center\"|38.5 |align=\"center\"|15.2 |align=\"center\"|14.1 |align=\"center\"|-- |align=\"center\"|-- |align=\"center\"|2.0 |- |align=\"center\"|1996 |align=\"center\"|24.1 |align=\"center\"|34.2 |align=\"center\"|17.1 |align=\"center\"|15.0 |align=\"center\"|8.8 |align=\"center\"|-- |align=\"center\"|0.8 |- |align=\"center\"|2001 |align=\"center\"|30.7 |align=\"center\"|25.7 |align=\"center\"|13.7 |align=\"center\"|24.9 |align=\"center\"|4.1 |align=\"center\"|-- |align=\"center\"|0.9 |- |align=\"center\"|2005 |align=\"center\"|35.6 |align=\"center\"|25.4 |align=\"center\"|7.3 |align=\"center\"|28.9 |align=\"center\"|0.8 |align=\"center\"|0.7 |align=\"center\"|1.3 |- |align=\"center\"|2010 |align=\"center\"|37.1 |align=\"center\"|18.1 |align=\"center\"|11.1 |align=\"center\"|26.1 |align=\"center\"|1.6 |align=\"center\"|0.8 |align=\"center\"|3.4 |} == Education == Beside some buildings of the Vienna University of Technology, Mariahilf hosts the Franz Schubert Conservatory and the central vocational schools for electrical engineering, information technology, metallurgy, glass-ceramic, sanitary engineering, heating engineering and air conditioning technology. == Coat of arms == 140px The district's arms combine those of the five independent communities from which it was formed in 1850: * The inescutcheon (for Mariahilf) shows Don John of Austria standing in a ship flying the imperial banner.
