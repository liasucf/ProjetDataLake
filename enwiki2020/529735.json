It is approximately south of downtown Los Angeles and its primary tenant is the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer (MLS). The stadium is also home to the Los Angeles Wildcats of the XFL, and LA Galaxy II of USL Championship. Opened in 2003, the $150 million complex was developed and is operated by the Anschutz Entertainment Group. With a seating capacity of 27,000, it is the largest soccer-specific stadium in the U.S. and the second- largest among its kind in MLS, after Toronto FC's BMO Field in Ontario, Canada. In addition to hosting LA Galaxy games since its opening, the stadium also served as the home of the now-defunct Chivas USA MLS team from 2005 to 2014. The stadium is currently the temporary home of the San Diego State Aztecs football team from San Diego State University. The stadium was the temporary home of the Los Angeles Chargers from 2017 to 2019. It was the smallest NFL stadium over the course of those three seasons. While the Chargers played in the stadium, the facility was named ROKiT Field at StubHub Center; ROKiT's naming rights to the football field are part of a \"multi-year\" agreement. During its first decade, the stadium's sponsor was hardware retailer The Home Depot. In 2013, the title sponsor became the online ticket marketplace StubHub. In 2019, the name sponsor became healthcare provider Dignity Health. == History and facilities == Originally opened as Home Depot Center in 2003, it was renamed \"StubHub Center\" on June 1, 2013. It was renamed \"Dignity Health Sports Park\" on January 1, 2019, after Dignity Health signed a new naming rights agreement. The 27,000-seat main stadium was the second American sports arena designed specifically for soccer in the MLS era.

A new section of upper-level bleachers, which seat 330, were erected in the southeast corner of the stadium. Also, the luxury suites were renovated with new seats, furniture, community tables, and engineered hardwood floors and the press box underwent an upgrade with a third row added to the main box, boosting capacity from about 35 to 53. Floors were constructed on the roof of the luxury suites so an auxiliary press box could be built on both sides of the main box. Two new radio booths were built outside the south side of the press box, and a large new booth on the north side which serves as a security command post for police and NFL officials was constructed. Two booths were added on each side of the press box for the NFL- mandated 20-yard-line television cameras, and a stairway allowing access to the roof of the main box was built to accommodate the 50-yard-line camera. To accommodate 53-man NFL rosters, four small locker rooms were converted to two larger ones with 60 cubicles in each. Also added were small postgame news conference rooms for each team and rooms for game officials and the chain gang. After the Chargers left for Inglewood, the football facilities were taken over by the Wildcats when the XFL team began operations in 2020. == Tenants == Aside from being home to the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer, it was also home to two defunct clubs, the MLS team Chivas USA as well as Los Angeles Sol of the Women's Professional Soccer.
