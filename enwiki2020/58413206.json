    "text": "J Rabbit () is a South Korean acoustic pop female duo under the label friendz.net. They debuted on November 27, 2010 with the single \"Take One\". The group's name is derived from combining the letter \u2018J\u2019 from their matching surname \u2018Jung\u2019 and the year of the rabbit, 1987, which they were both born in. == Members == === Jung Hye-sun (\uc815\ud61c\uc120)=== * Birthdate: * Lead vocals * Graduate of Seoul Institute of the Arts === Jung Da-woon (\uc815\ub2e4\uc6b4)=== * Birthdate: * Instruments, songwriter * Graduate of Seoul Institute of the Arts == Artistry == J Rabbit has a unique style focusing on creating music for everyone no matter their age and aiming to console people with their music. Their songs are light hearted, relaxing, and up-beat while using unique instruments like bells, xylophones, violins, cellos, and melodeon accordions. An editor working with Seoulbeats, Leslie Tumbaco mentions \"They have such a keen understanding of the basics of music, which makes their stripped-down melodies so magnetic\". Along with the light hearted songs their performances are very light hearted and fun as well, drawing in audiences and attention with their personalities. == Discography == === Albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions |- !style=width:3em;font-size:90%|KOR * * * * |- ! scope=\"row\"| It's Spring | *Released: March 4, 2011 *Formats: CD, digital download | 46 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Looking Around | *Released: April 25, 2012 *Formats: CD, digital download | 47 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Merry Christmas From J Rabbit (Christmas Cover Album) | *Released: November 30, 2012 *Formats: digital download | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| Stop & Go | *Released: June 19, 2014 *Formats: CD, digital download | 38 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Growing Everyday | *Released: May 3, 2016 *Formats: CD, digital download | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| The Little Heroes | *Released: November 30, 2018 *Formats: CD, digital download | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| Dialogue on the Road | *Released: May 10, 2019 *Formats: CD, digital download | 70 |- |} === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album |- !style=width:3em;font- size:90%|KOR Gaon Weekly Digital Chart * * * |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Take One\" | rowspan=\"2\" | 2010 | \u2014 | It's Spring |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Christmas Live\" | \u2014 | rowspan=\"3\" | Non-album single |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Hcube wiv J Rabbit \u2013 aMorejo\" | rowspan=\"3\" | 2011 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Hcube wiv J Rabbit \u2013 R U tired?\" (\ud798\ub4e0\uac00\uc694?) | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Where the Wind Blows From\" (\ubc14\ub78c\uc774 \ubd88\uc5b4\uc624\ub294 \uacf3) | 53 | Kwang Seok, KIM Best album (\uba85\ubd88\ud5c8\uc804` \uae40\uad11\uc11d \ub2e4\uc2dc\ub4e3\uae30) |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Happy Things\" | 2012 | 96 | Looking Around |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"The Moon Embraces The Rabbit Volume 1\" (\ub2ec\uc744 \ud488\uc740 \ud1a0\ub07c Vol. 1) | rowspan=\"2\" | 2013 | \u2014 | rowspan=\"3\" | Non-album single |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"The Moon Embraces The Rabbit Volume 2\" (\ub2ec\uc744 \ud488\uc740 \ud1a0\ub07c Vol. 2) | 84 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Good Feeling\" (\uae30\ubd84 \uc88b\uc740 \ub290\ub08c) | 2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Growing Everyday\" | rowspan=\"2\" | 2016 | \u2014 | Growing Everyday |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Beautiful Life\" | \u2014 | Beautiful Life |- |} === Soundtracks === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !
