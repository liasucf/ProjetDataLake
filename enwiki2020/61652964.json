It is regarded as the third class of the royal temple, that was built during King Nangklao (Rama III)'s reign in 1848. The chief commander Chao Phraya Bodindecha had a great faith in Buddhism. After coming back with the victory from the war with Khmer and Annamese, he donated his house to build this temple. He named this temple Wat Chai Chana Songkhram, which means literally \"war victory temple\". This temple is also known informally as Wat Tuek (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e15\u0e36\u0e01), which means literally \"building temple\". Because it is strange from other temples at the same time, it was built with concrete and full of buildings and structures, such as main hall, st\u016bpas, sermon hall, monk's dwellings etc. The principal Buddha image named \"Singhamunin Thammabodin Lokanartthewanorachat Apiphuchani\" (\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e38\u0e19\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e42\u0e25\u0e01\u0e19\u0e32\u0e16\u0e40\u0e17\u0e27\u0e19\u0e23\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34 \u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e1b\u0e39\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e35\u0e22\u0e4c).
