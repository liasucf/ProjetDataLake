He was born in Carora in the state of Lara, and was the younger brother of pediatrics pioneer, Pastor Oropeza Riera. In his youth, he opposed the totalitarian regime of President Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez and became a member of the student-led movement called \"Generation of 1928\". He was imprisoned and eventually sent into exile with some of the other group members. In 1931, he worked as a correspondent for \u00c9lite Magazine in Madrid, Spain. Upon his return to Venezuela he became a founding member of Acci\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica, one of the two most prominent political parties in the nation's republican history, alongside such important figures as Luis Beltr\u00e1n Prieto Figueroa, Mariano Pic\u00f3n Salas and later Venezuelan President R\u00f3mulo Betancourt. In 1944, he married Venezuelan Alicia Sosa in the state of Sonora, Mexico, in 1944.

In the 1960s, he continued his duties as the Venezuelan ambassador in Paris for R\u00f3mulo Betancourt's administration. During that time, he was also chosen to represent Venezuela as its ambassador before UNESCO and, during Ra\u00fal Leoni's presidency, was assigned to the position of Venezuelan ambassador in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, the highest honor any Venezuelan diplomatic official can achieve.
