In the early hours of that morning, Clarkson had met Spector while working at the House of Blues in Los Angeles. After leaving in Spector's limousine, the two were driven to Spector's mansion and went inside while his driver waited in the car. About an hour later, the driver heard a gunshot before Spector exited his house through the back door with a gun. He was quoted as saying, according to affidavits, \"I think I just shot her.\" Spector later said Clarkson's death was an \"accidental suicide\" and that she \"kissed the gun\". Spector was tried for the murder of Clarkson in 2007. On September 26 of that year, a mistrial was declared due to a hung jury, with ten jurors of twelve favoring conviction. He was tried again for second-degree murder beginning on October 20, 2008. On April 13, 2009, the jury found Spector guilty of murdering Clarkson. On May 29, 2009, he was sentenced to nineteen years to life in state prison. ==Background== On February 3, 2003, actress Lana Clarkson was found dead in record producer Phil Spector's mansion, the Pyrenees Castle, in Alhambra, California.

Spector told Esquire magazine in July 2003 that Clarkson's death was an \"accidental suicide\" and that she \"kissed the gun\". The 9-1-1 call from Spector's home, made by his driver, Adriano de Souza, quotes Spector as saying, \"I think I've killed someone\". De Souza added that he saw Spector come out the back door of the house with a gun in his hand. Forensic examinations could not find Spector's fingerprints on the gun. According to the prosecution, Spector had previously pulled a gun on four women. In each case, he had been drinking and \"was romantically interested in the woman, but grew angry after the woman spurned him.\" The prosecution alleged that on each occasion, he pointed a gun at the woman to prevent her from walking out. The prosecution argued that the testimony of the other women was important to demonstrating a \"common plan or scheme.\" The defense sought to prevent the women from providing such testimony. Though the law generally forbids the introduction of evidence showing a defendant's previous transgressions, the judge ruled the testimony \"can be used to show lack of accident or mistake.\" == Trials == 2009 mug shot.
