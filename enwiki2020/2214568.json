The Trojan Shrine, the symbol of USC and popularly known as \"Tommy Trojan\", was originally supposed to be named \"The Spirit of Troy\". ==History== The TMB's first recorded performance was in November 1918 when, at the end of World War I, members of the TMB led a victory parade of America's returning servicemen in New York City. \"Fight On\", the fight song of the University was composed in 1922 and became a part of the TMB tradition. In 1923, the school's alma mater, \"All Hail\", was composed by a member of the TMB, Al Wesson. The TMB gave its first national radio concert on CBS on April 19, 1929. The band participated in the 1932 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, forming the Olympic Braid in the opening ceremonies in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (coincidentally USC's home stadium). After wearing various uniforms over the years, particularly those with a military-style, the band began using basic, unadorned Trojan-style helmets and uniforms in 1950. Three years later, the TMB adopted \"Conquest\", a song composed by Alfred Newman for the film Captain from Castile as a victory march. The TMB made its first trip outside of California in 1954, traveling to Portland, Oregon to play a USC-Oregon game that the Trojans would win, 24\u201314. During the Grammy Awards of 1966, TMB trumpet alumnus Herb Alpert won three Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year. Arthur Bartner took over the program in 1970, and began shaping the band into its current form. Women were allowed to join the band in 1972. After several more uniform changes, the TMB began using more elaborate Trojan helmets with brushes, visors, and ear flaps in 1972. In 1973 the TMB began its tradition of sending the full band to games at USC-Notre Dame rivalry games at Notre Dame Stadium. In 1979, the TMB was invited by Fleetwood Mac to perform and record \"Tusk\", the title song for the album Tusk. The album went double-platinum and was adopted as a part of the TMB's traditional selections.Gold and Platinum Searchable Database, RIAA.

During the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Bartner directed an 800-member All American College Marching Band, 125 of whom were members of the TMB. The year 1987 featured several significant moments for the band: the TMB trumpets performed the fanfare for Pope John Paul II in his visit to Los Angeles, the band performed during Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, and the band began its current streak of attending all USC home and away football games.
