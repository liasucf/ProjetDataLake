Walker, \u201cNew Philadelphia\u201d , Center for Heritage Resource Studies, University of Maryland, 2006, accessed 1 June 2009 The town site is at New Philadelphia, Illinois. This plot of land in Pike County, Illinois was the site of the first town platted and registered by an African American before the American Civil War. It had black and white residents, and an integrated school. As a railroad was built bordering a neighboring community, the New Philadelphia expansion seemed to come to a halt. By the early 20th century, only a few homes and families remained. Today only prairie remains with no evidence of a once-flourishing community. During the fall and spring of 2002 and 2003, Fennell and a team from University of Illinois, University of Maryland and other institutions used topographical and historical maps to find the exact location of the New Philadelphia Site. They found plots of land with artifacts such as nails, ceramic pieces, and shards of glass, showing obvious signs of a previous settlement. The archaeologists are working with the New Philadelphia Land Trust to excavate and preserve the site and its history. In 1999 and 2000, Fennell performed excavations and studies in the upper Potomac River and northern Shenandoah River region surrounding Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Included were an 18th-century house and St. Peter's Church and School in Harper\u2019s Valley. He examined three cultural processes: the formation and dissipation of social groups, the development of language and communication through material culture, and regional exchange systems. ==Books== *Crossroads and Cosmologies: Diasporas and Ethnogenesis in the New World (2008) (received award, see below) *African Diaspora Archaeology (2008) Society for Historical Archaeology. ==Awards== *2009 John L.
