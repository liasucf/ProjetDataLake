Once set up, these counters will be incremented by one every time the web page is accessed in a web browser. The number is usually displayed as an inline digital image or in plain text. Image rendering of digits may use a variety of fonts and styles; the classic example is the wheels of an odometer. The counter is often accompanied by the date it was set up or last reset, without which it becomes impossible to estimate within what time the number of page loads counted occurred. Some web counters were simply web bugs used by webmasters to track hits and included no visible on-page elements. Counters were popular in the 1990s, but were later replaced by other web traffic measures such as self- hosted scripts like Analog, and later on by remote systems that used JavaScript, like Google Analytics.
