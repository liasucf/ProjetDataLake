In Northeast India, they are present in all states except Arunachal Pradesh.

The origin of the word \"Kuki\" is uncertain,it is an exonym: it was not originally as a self-designation by the tribes that are now called Kukis. According to the colonial British writer Adam Scott Reid, the earliest reference to the word Kuki can be dated to 1777 CE, when it first appeared in British records. Ancient Sanskrit legendary literature mentions the Kirata people, which have been identified with tribes such as the Kuki. According to CA Soppit, the \"Old Kukis\" migrated to Manipur in the early 11th century, while the \"New Kukis\" migrated to Manipur during the first half of the 19th century. ===Contact with outside world and resistance=== Long ignored by the outside world, an important landmark in the history of the Kuki people was the arrival of missionaries and the spread of Christianity among them. Missionary activity had considerable social, cultural and political ramifications while the acceptance of Christianity marked a departure from the tradition religion of the Kuki peoples as well as both the Kuki peoples' ancestral customs and traditions. The spread of English education introduced the Kuki people to the \"modern era\". William Pettigrew, the first foreign missionary, came to Manipur on 6 February 1894 and was sponsored by the American Baptist Mission Union. He, together with Dr. Crozier, worked together in the North and the Northeast of Manipur. In the south, Watkins Robert of the Welsh Presbytery mission organised the Indo-Burma Thadou-Kuki Pioneer Mission in 1913. To have a broader scope, the mission's name was changed to North East India General Mission (NEIGM).T. Haokip, 'Kuki Churches Unification Movements', Journal of North East India Studies, Vol. 2(1), 2012, p. 35. The first resistance to British hegemony by the Kuki people was the Kuki Rebellion of 1917\u201319 after which their territory was subjugated by the British and divided between the administrations of British India and British Burma.Burma and Assam Frontier, \u2018Kuki rising, 1917\u20131919\u2019, L/PS/10/724, Oriental and India Office Collections (OIOC), British Library, London Up until their defeat in 1919, the Kukis had been an independent people ruled by their chieftains. The Dobashi, Lengjang Kuki was credited as responsible for preventing the Kukis of the Naga Hills from joining the Kuki Rebellion of Manipur. During World War II, seeing an opportunity to regain independence, the Kuki fought with the Imperial Japanese Army and the Indian National Army led by Subhas Chandra Bose but the success of the Allied forces over the Axis group dashed their hopes. ==Cultures and traditions== The land of the Kukis has a number of customs and traditions. ===Sawm=== Sawm, a community centre for boys \u2013 was the centre of learning in which the Sawm-upa (an elder) did the teaching, while Sawm-nu took care of chores, such as combing of the boy's hair, washing of the garments and making the beds. The best students were recommended to the King's or the Chief's service, and eventually would achieve the office of Semang and Pachong (ministers) in their courts, or gal \u2013lamkai (leaders, warriors) in the army.Paokhohao Haokp, \"Reinculcating Traditional Values of the Kukis with Special Reference to Lom and Som\", in T. Haokip (ed.). The Kukis of Northeast India: Politics and Culture. New Delhi: Bookwell, 2013, Chapter 11. ===Lawm=== Lawm (a traditional type of youth club) was an institution in which boys and girls engaged in social activities for the benefit of the individual and the community. It was also another learning institution. Every Lawm has a Lawm-upa (a senior member), a To\u2019llai-pao (an overseer or superintendent) and a Lawm- tangvo (assistant superintendent). Besides being a source of traditional learning, the institution of the Lawm also facilitated the transmission of both technical as well as practical knowledge to its members, especially with regard to particular methods of farming, hunting, fishing and sporting activities such as Kung\u2013Kal (high jump, especially over a choice mithun), Ka\u2019ng Ka\u2019p, Ka\u2019ngchoi Ka\u2019p (top game), Suhtumkhawh (javelin throw using the heavy wooden implement for pounding-de-husking-paddy) and So\u2019ngse (shot put). The Lawm was also a centre where young Kuki people learned discipline and social etiquette. After harvest season, the Lawm meet is celebrated with a Lawm-se\u2019l and, as a commemoration, a pillar is erected. The event is accompanied by dance and drinking rice-beer, which sometimes continues for days and nights. ==Laws and government== ===Governance=== With regard to governance, Semang (cabinet) is the annual assembly of a Kuki village community held at the Chief's residence represents the Inpi (Assembly). In such an assembly, the Chief and his Semang and Pachong (cabinet members and auxiliary of Inpi) and all the household heads of the village congregate to discuss and resolve matters relating to the village and the community.T. Lunkim, \"Traditional System of Kuki Administration\", in T. Haokip (ed.). The Kukis of Northeast India: Politics and Culture. New Delhi: Bookwell, 2013, Chapter 1. ===Religions=== The Bnei Menashe (, \"Sons of Menasseh\") are a small group within the indigenous people of India's North-Eastern border states of Manipur and Mizoram; since the late 20th century, they claim descent from one of the Lost Tribes of Israel and have adopted the practice of Judaism.Weil, Shalva. \"Double Conversion among the 'Children of Menasseh'\" in Georg Pfeffer and Deepak K. Behera (eds) Contemporary Society Tribal Studies, New Delhi: Concept, pp. 84\u2013102. 1996 Weil, Shalva. \"Lost Israelites from North-East India: Re-Traditionalisation and Conversion among the Shinlung from the Indo- Burmese Borderlands\", The Anthropologist, 2004. 6(3): 219\u2013233. The Bnei Menashe are made up of Mizo, Kuki and Chin peoples, who all speak Tibeto- Burman languages, and whose ancestors migrated into northeast India from Burma mostly in the 17th and 18th centuries. They are called Chin in Burma. In the late 20th century, an Israeli rabbi investigating their claims named them Bnei Menashe, based on their account of descent from Menasseh. Most of the peoples in these two northeast states, who number more than 3.7 million, do not identify with these claims. Some have supported other movements to separate from India. Prior to conversion in the 19th century to Christianity by Welsh Baptist missionaries, the Chin, Kuki, and Mizo peoples were animists; among their practices were ritual headhunting. Since the late 20th century, some of these peoples have begun following Messianic Judaism. The Bnei Menashe are a small group who started studying and practicing Judaism since the 1970s in a desire to return to what they believe is the religion of ancestors. The Bnei Menashe number below 9,000; several hundred have emigrated to Israel. The majority of Kukis are now Christians, with most belonging to Protestant denominations, especially Baptist.Chin Cultural Profile ==Notable people== * Gokhothang, Prince from Mualpi. * Laldenga, MNF Leader * Henry Van Thio, Burmese politician. * Thangkhopao Kipgen, IAS. *Zoramthanga, Burmese Indian boxer,first indian to win medal at Boxing World Cup. ==See also== * Zale'n-gam ==References== ==External links== Category:Ethnic groups in Bangladesh Category:Ethnic groups in Manipur Category:Ethnic groups in Tripura Category:Ethnic groups in Myanmar Category:Tribes of Assam Category:Kuki tribes Category:Headhunting Category:Scheduled Tribes of Nagaland Category:Scheduled Tribes of Assam Category:Scheduled Tribes of Mizoram Category:Scheduled Tribes of Meghalaya Category:Ethnic groups in Northeast India Category:Ethnic groups in South Asia ",
