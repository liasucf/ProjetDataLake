It is about a sexually frustrated housewife, Lisa (played by actress Lana Wood), who, having been distanced from her husband Carl (Don Galloway), begins having nightly trysts with an apparition that gradually takes on the form of a tall, dark stranger (played by Kabir Bedi of Octopussy) who turns out to be a ghost from the other side. The film gives higher screen credit to Britt Ekland, who had only a minor role but more star power. Lana Wood is known to many as Plenty O'Toole from the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever. The film was released the same year as the similarly themed The Entity, differing in that the sex in Satan's Mistress is consensual. The film has a cameo by veteran horror actor John Carradine as Father Stratten. ==Cast== *Britt Ekland - Ann-Marie *Lana Wood - Lisa *Kabir Bedi - the spirit *Don Galloway - Carl *John Carradine - Father Stratten *Sherry Scott - Michelle *Elise-Anne - Belline *Tom Hallick - Burt ==References== ==External links== * Category:1982 horror films Category:1982 films Category:1980s supernatural horror films ",
