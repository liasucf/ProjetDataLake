It was the first live album under distribution with Sanctuary Records and their subsidiary Metal-Is for North America and certain territories. The concert was filmed and has an accompanying live DVD called 25 & Alive Boneshaker, both of which are exactly the same recordings, but it was not released until 2005 due to mastering problems. Various guests made appearances on the night; \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke (ex-Mot\u00f6rhead), Queen's Brian May, Todd Campbell (Phil's son), Paul Inder (Lemmy's son), Whitfield Crane (ex-Ugly Kid Joe), Doro Pesch (ex-Warlock) and Ace (Skunk Anansie). ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted from the Live at Brixton Academy liner notes. * Lemmy \u2013 lead vocals, bass * Phil Campbell \u2013 lead guitar * Mikkey Dee \u2013 drums === Guests musicians === * Whitfield Crane on \"Born To Raise Hell\" * Doro Pesch on \"Born To Raise Hell\" * \"Fast\" Eddie on \"The Chase Is Better Than The Catch\" and \"Overkill\" * Todd Campbell (Psycho Squad) on \"Killed By Death\" * Paul Inder on \"Killed By Death\" * Brian May on \"Overkill\" * Ace on \"Overkill\" ===Production=== *Ian Kilmister \u2013 producer *Phil Campbell \u2013 producer * Mikkey Dee with SPV GmbH/Steamhammer \u2013 producer *Dave \"Hobbs\" Hilsden \u2013 tour manager, engineer *Tony Beeton \u2013 lighting director *Tim Butcher \u2013 bass tech *Roger De Souza \u2013 guitar tech *Alex Parmee \u2013 drum tech *Freddie Lind \u2013 production coordination ==References== Category:Mot\u00f6rhead live albums Category:2003 live albums Category:SPV/Steamhammer live albums Category:Albums recorded at the Brixton Academy ",
