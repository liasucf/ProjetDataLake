In 1927, she was lengthened by and converted into a motor fishing vessel. She was renamed Morgenster in 1959 and continued to be used as a fishing vessel until 1970. After a period of use for sport fishing and in the pirate radio business, she was acquired by her current owners for conversion back to a sailing vessel in 1983. She made her maiden voyage as a sail training ship in 2008, having been refitted as a brig. ==Gallery== File:The Tall Ships' Races - 02-05.07.2009, Gdynia - 05-07-2009 - 127 - cropped.jpg|Morgenster at Gdynia in 2009 File:Brest2012 parade nocturne (6).JPG|Morgenster at Brest in 2012 File:Morgenster (ship, 1919) in Gloucester Docks 07.JPG|Morgenster at Gloucester Docks in 2015 File:Vannes, semaine du golfe 2015 - Morgenster (8).JPG|Morgenster at Vannes in 2015 ==References== ==External links== * * The Morgenster's web site Category:Brigs Category:Sailing ships of the Netherlands Category:Training ships Category:1919 ships ",
