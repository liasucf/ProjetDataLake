    "text": "Presidential elections were held in Mali on 29 July 2018. In July 2018, the Constitutional Court approved the nomination of a total of 24 candidates in the election. As no candidate received more than 50% of the vote in the first round, a runoff was held on 12 August 2018 between the top two candidates, incumbent President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta of the Rally for Mali and Souma\u00efla Ciss\u00e9 of the Union for the Republic and Democracy. Ke\u00efta was subsequently re- elected with 67% of the vote. It was the first time in Malian history that a presidential election was forced into a runoff between incumbent and a challenger. == Background == In accordance with the 1992 constitution, presidential elections take place every five years. The previous elections, first scheduled for 13 May 2012, were delayed until 28 July 2013 due to the 2012 coup d'\u00e9tat that overthrew President Amadou Toumani Toure. A peace deal between Tuareg separatists and the government was signed in 2015 following negotiations through a diplomatic channel extended by the Malian government. The creation of the Macina Liberation Front in 2015, led by the preacher Amadou Koufa, has led to increased ethnic tensions and violence in the country. There has been little or no violence in Mali's past elections which have in previous years been conducted with no protests. ==Electoral system== The President of Mali is elected by absolute majority vote using the two-round system to serve a 5-year term. ==Pre-election== There was doubt as to the safety of the elections to be held and of the governments' ability to hold them. If held, the French diplomat Jean-Pierre Lacroix has said that \"the upcoming presidential elections will mark the beginning of a new chapter in the stabilization of Mali\". === Voter registration === As of July 24, there were 8,461,000 registered voters set to cast their vote 23,041 polling stations. Of the Malian refugees living in Mbera, Mauritania, 7,000 people registered to vote in the elections. === Candidates === There were 17 confirmed candidates and 13 more were pending as of late June. In the end, on July 5, the Constitutional Court approved the nomination of a total of 24 candidates in the election. Some of them include: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\" data-ve-attributes=\"{\"style\":\"text-align:left\"}\" !Candidate !Party |- |Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta (incumbent) |Rally for Mali |- |Mohamed Ali Bathily | |- |Souma\u00efla Ciss\u00e9 | |- |Modibo Kone | |- |Choguel Kokala Ma\u00efga | |- |Moussa Mara | |- |Oumar Mariko | African Solidarity for Democracy and Independence |- |Djeneba N\u2019Diaye | |- |Yeah Samake |Party for Civic and Patriotic Action |- |Harouna Sankar\u00e9 | |- |Kalifa Sanogo |Alliance for Democracy in Mali |- |Moussa Sinko Coulibaly | |- |Cheick Mohamed Abdoulaye Souad | |- |Hamadoun Toure | |- |Mountaga Tall | |} === Protests and violence === On 6 June, thousands gathered in the capital Bamako to protest against Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta. On 25 July, following a robbery at a pharmacy, protesters \"burned tyres and torched vehicles\" in Timbuktu in response to the deepening insecurity and alleged mistreatment by police. This precipitate a violent clash the following day involving about 100 people. On 31 July, gunmen attacked a convoy carrying election materials in the S\u00e9gou Region. This attack and the following shootout killed four soldiers and eight attackers. ==Results== cercle of Mali {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !rowspan=2|Candidate !rowspan=2|Party !colspan=2|First round !colspan=2|Second round |- !Votes !% !Votes !% |- |align=left|Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta||align=left|Rally for Mali||1,331,132||41.70||1,798,632||67.17 |- |align=left|Souma\u00efla Ciss\u00e9||align=left|Union for the Republic and Democracy||567,679||17.78||879,235||32.83 |- |align=left|Aliou Diallo||align=left| ||256,404||8.03||colspan=2 rowspan=22| |- |align=left|Cheick Modibo Diarra||align=left| ||236,025||7.39 |- |align=left|Housseini Amion Guindo||align=left|Convergence for the Development of Mali||124,506||3.90 |- |align=left|Oumar Mariko||align=left|African Solidarity for Democracy and Independence||74,300||2.33 |- |align=left|Modibo Kone||align=left| ||72,941||2.29 |- |align=left|Choguel Kokala Ma\u00efga||align=left| ||68,970||2.16 |- |align=left|Harouna Sankare||align=left| ||57,406||1.80 |- |align=left|Mamadou Oumar Sidibe||align=left| ||54,274||1.70 |- |align=left|Modibo Sidibe||align=left|Alternative Forces for Renewal and Emergence||45,453||1.42 |- |align=left|Kalfa Sanogo||align=left|Alliance for Democracy in Mali (not official)The party officially supports Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta: Pr\u00e9sidentielle 2018: l'Adema soutient le pr\u00e9sident IBK ||38,892||1.22 |- |align=left|Mamadou Diarra||align=left| ||36,124||1.13 |- |align=left|Modibo Kadjoke||align=left| ||30,479||0.95 |- |align=left|Moussa Sinko Coulibaly||align=left| ||30,232||0.95 |- |align=left|Adama Kane||align=left| ||26,084||0.82 |- |align=left|Daba Diawara||align=left| ||22,991||0.72 |- |align=left|Mountaga Tall||align=left| ||20,312||0.64 |- |align=left|Dramane Dembele||align=left|Alliance for Democracy in Mali (not official)||18,737||0.59 |- |align=left|Mohamed Ali Bathily||align=left| ||17,712||0.55 |- |align=left|Hamadoun Toure||align=left| ||17,087||0.54 |- |align=left|Yeah Samake||align=left| ||16,632||0.52 |- |align=left|Mamadou Traore||align=left| ||15,502||0.49 |- |align=left|Madame Djeneba N'diaye||align=left| ||12,275||0.38 |- |align=left colspan=2|Invalid/blank votes||224,069||\u2013||85,536||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=2|Total||3,416,218||100||2,763,339||100 |- |align=left colspan=2|Registered voters/turnout||8,000,462||42.70||8,000,462||34.54 |- |align=left colspan=6|Source: Constitutional Court, Government of Mali |} ==References== Category:2018 elections in Africa Category:2018 in Mali Category:July 2018 events in Africa Category:August 2018 events in Africa 2018 2018 ",
