    "text": "The Battle of Peshawar took place on May 6, 1834 between the Sikh Empire and the Afghans who were the successors to the Durrani Empire. Maharaj Ranjit Singh had previously won and lost the city of Peshawar twice, and sent General Hari Singh Nalwa to capture it. After brief fighting, Hari Singh Nalwa captured the city and took Sultan Mohammad Khan as a prisoner of war. The news of the capture of Peshawar and Sultan Mohammad Khan quickly reached Kabul. A large Afghan force under his brother, Dost Mohammad Khan, arrived in support of him, but withdrew. Hari Singh Nalwa then, as a gesture of goodwill, installed Sultan Mohammad Khan as governor of the city, and as a vassal to Maharaja Ranjit Singh. ==References== Peshawar 1834 Category:1834 in India 1834 Peshawar 1834 Peshawar 1834 Category:Ranjit Singh Category:1834 in Afghanistan Category:May 1834 events ",
