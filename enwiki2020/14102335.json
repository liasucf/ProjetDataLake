    "text": "Georg Jarno (3 June 1868, in Buda \u2013 25 May 1920, in Breslau) was a Hungarian composer, mainly of operettas. ==Biography== After he finished his studies in Budapest, he worked as Theaterkapellmeister in Bremen, Gera, Halle, Saxony- Anhalt, Metz, Liegnitz, Chemnitz and Magdeburg, and also as opera director in Bad Kissingen, before settling in Vienna as a freelance composer. Before 1903, Jarno's name was Gy\u00f6rgy Cohner. He is buried in the New Jewish Cemetery in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland. ==Career== Jarno's greatest successes were Die F\u00f6rsterchristl (1907) and Das Musikantenm\u00e4del (1910). His operettas Das Farmerm\u00e4dchen and Jungfer Sonnenschein were well received, whereas Die Marine-Gustl, Mein Annerl, Der Goldfisch and Die Csikosbaroness could muster only passing interest. Much of the success of his works was due to the distinguished presentation of their title roles by his brother's (Joseph Jarno) wife, the highly popular actress and soubrette Hansi Niese. He loved to introduce historically well known persons into his operettas; Kaiser Joseph II in Die F\u00f6rsterchristl, Prince Eugene of Savoy in Jungfer Sonnenschein, Joseph Haydn in Das Musikantenm\u00e4del. Before operettas, he wrote three operas: Die schwarze Kaschka (1895), Der Richter von Zalamea (1899) based on Calderon's El alcalde de Zalamea, and Der zerbrochne Krug (1903) based on Heinrich von Kleist's play; none prevailed. His main success, Die F\u00f6rsterchristl, had a run of 64 performances at Broadway's Herald Square Theatre in 1910/11 under the title The Girl and the Kaiser. ==Stage works== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Title !Libretto !colspan=\"2\"|Premiere |- |colspan=\"4\"|Operas |- |Der schwarze Kaschka Opera in 4 acts |Viktor Bl\u00fcthgen |12 May 1895 |Breslau |- |Der Richter von Zalamea Opera in 4 acts |Viktor Bl\u00fcthgen based on Calder\u00f3n |1899 |Breslau |- |Der zerbrochene Krug Comic opera in 3 acts revised as Johanniszauber |Heinrich Lee based on Kleist's The Broken Jug |1903 1911 |Hamburg Hamburg |- |colspan=\"4\"|Operettas |- |Der Goldfisch |Richard J\u00e4ger |1907 |Breslau |- |Die F\u00f6rsterchristl |Bernhard Buchbinder |17 December 1907 |Vienna Theater in der Josefstadt |- |Das Musikantenm\u00e4del |Bernhard Buchbinder |12 February 1910 |Vienna Theater in der Josefstadt |- |Die Marine-Gustl |Bernhard Buchbinder |1912 |Vienna |- |Das Farmerm\u00e4dchen |Georg Okonkowski |22 March 1913 |Berlin |- |Mein Annerl |Fritz Gr\u00fcnbaum/ |1916 |Vienna |- |Jungfer Sonnenschein |Bernhard Buchbinder |1918 |Hamburg |- |Die Csikosbarone\u00df |Fritz Gr\u00fcnbaum |1919 |Hamburg |} ==Bibliography== * ==References== * *Reclams Operettenf\u00fchrer, Anton W\u00fcrz (ed.), Stuttgart 1962 ==External links== Category:1868 births Category:1920 deaths Category:19th- century classical composers Category:20th-century classical composers Category:Hungarian classical composers Category:Hungarian expatriates in Austria Category:Hungarian expatriates in Germany Category:Hungarian opera composers Category:Hungarian male classical composers Category:Male opera composers Category:People from Buda Category:20th-century male musicians Category:19th-century male musicians ",
