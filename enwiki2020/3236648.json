The ridings that are entirely rural (e.g. Souris-Moose Mountain and Yorkton-Melville) are almost as conservative as ridings in rural Alberta, and are even more so now with issues like same-sex marriage being highly unpopular. The urban areas of Regina and Moose Jaw are traditionally more supportive of the New Democratic Party, but they were wiped out in three-way races in 2004, and were unable to recover in 2006 or 2008. The Liberals also has some support in Regina, but it really only translates into one seat - that of local born and raised veteran politician, former Finance Minister, former Public Safety Minister and former Liberal deputy leader Ralph Goodale. Like Saskatoon, Regina has double the population of a typical Canadian urban riding. However, until 2015 the surrounding areas were thought to be too thinly populated for ridings of their own. As a result, for almost two decades Regina's four federal ridings included large blocks of rural territory. The rural presence in the Regina area ridings largely neutralized the NDP and Liberal blocs after the end of vote-splitting on the right in 2004. With the 2015 redistribution, Regina is now split between three ridings\u2014one hybrid urban-rural riding and two located almost entirely within the city limits. Mirroring the split in the city as a whole, each major party took one seat each, with the NDP winning a seat here for the first time since 2000. In 2019, however, the entire province swung over dramatically to support Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who holds the hybrid urban-rural seat of Regina\u2014Qu'Appelle. The Tories swept the entire region, in the process unseating the Prairies' highest-profile minister, Goodale. This left Regina with no centre-left MPs for the first time since 1965. ==2015 - 42nd General Election== ==2011 - 41st General Election== ==2008 - 40th General Election== ==2006 - 39th General Election== ==2004 - 38th General Election== Key map #Cypress Hills-Grasslands #Palliser #Regina- Lumsden-Lake Centre #Regina-Qu'Appelle #Souris-Moose Mountain #Wascana #Yorkton-Melville Image:sscpc.PNG|Conservative Party of Canada Image:ssgpc.PNG|Green Party of Canada Image:sslpc.PNG|Liberal Party of Canada Image:ssndp.PNG|New Democratic Party ==2000 - 37th General Election== Saskatchewan, South Category:Elections in Saskatchewan ",
