    "text": "Benzylidene acetal of glucose. Benzylidene compounds are, formally speaking, derivatives of benzylidene, although few are prepared from the carbene. Benzylidene acetal is a protecting group in synthetic organic chemistry of the form PhCH(OR)2. For example, 4,6-O-benzylidene-glucopyranose is a glucose derivative. Benzylidene is an archaic term for compounds of the type PhCHX2 and PhCH= substituents (Ph = C6H5). For example, dibenzylideneacetone is (PhCH=CH)2CO. Benzal chloride, PhCHCl2, is alternatively named benzylidene chloride. Benzylidene is the molecule C6H5CH. It is a triplet carbene (CAS RN 3101-08-4). It is generated by irradiation of phenyldiazomethane. ==See also== * Aurone ==References== ==External links== * Category:Aromatic compounds ",
