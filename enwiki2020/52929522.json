    "text": "' is a centaur and Uranus co-orbital first observed on December 26, 2014, by the Pan-STARRS survey. It is the second known centaur on a tadpole orbit with Uranus, and the fourth Uranus co-orbital discovered after 83982 Crantor], and . Asteroid is a temporary trojan of Uranus, the second one ( was identified first) to be confirmed as currently trapped in such resonant state. This object may have remained as a Uranian Trojan for about 60,000 years and it can continue that way for another 80,000 years. Numerical integrations suggest that it may stay within Uranus\u2019 co-orbital zone for nearly one million years. Besides being a Uranian trojan, is trapped in the 7:20 mean motion resonance with Saturn as well; therefore, this minor body is currently subjected to a three-body resonance. The other known Uranian trojan, , is also in this resonant configuration. == See also == * * 83982 Crantor * == Notes == # Assuming an albedo from 0.05 (120 km) to 0.5 (40 km). == References == ==External links== * Far-off asteroid caught cohabiting with Uranus around the sun * Category:Uranus trojans Category:Centaurs (minor planets) Category:Co- orbital minor planets Category:Minor planet object articles (unnumbered) Category:Uranus 20141226 ",
