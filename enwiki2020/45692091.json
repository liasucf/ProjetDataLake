    "text": "2 Thessalonians 1 is the first chapter of the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. Traditionally, it is believed to be written for the church in Thessalonica by Apostle Paul, likely in Corinth shortly after the first epistle (which was written in about 50-51 CE),Best, E. (1972), A Commentary on the First and Second Epistles to the Thessalonians, Black's New Testament Commentaries (London: Adam \u00a3 Charles Black). p. 59; apud Esler 2007, p. 1213. Quote: 'to meet a new situation in respect of eschatology and a deteriorating situation in respect of idleness', although 'we do not know from where Paul received his information'. although there were debatable charges that it is the work of a secondary imitator after Paul's death (in 70s to 100 CE). This chapter contains the prescript, thanksgiving and encouragement for the recipients. ==Text== The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 12 verses. ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 30 (3rd century) *Codex Vaticanus (325\u2013350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330\u2013360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400\u2013440) *Codex Freerianus (~450; extant: verses 1\u20133, 10\u201311) *Codex Claromontanus (~550) ==Prescript (1:1\u20132)== As common in the letters of ancient Mediterranean, this epistle begins with a prescript comprising the names of the senders (Paul, Silvanus and Timothy), the addressees (the ekkl\u0113sia/church of the Thessalonians) and a brief greeting, which is identical to the prescript in 1 Thessalonians 1:1. ===Verse 1=== : Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, :: To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: NKJV ===Verse 2=== :Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. NKJV ==Thanksgiving and Encouragement (1:3-12)== Paul usually includes a thanksgiving after the prescript in his epistles (except in Galatians), where he mentions the good qualities of the recipients. ===Verse 7=== :and to give you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, NKJV * \"You who are troubled, rest with us\": For those persecuted for the sake of righteousness, \"rest\" is offered as a relaxation, at least for a while, as the churches in Judea, Samaria and Galilee had, after a wave of persecution since the death of Stephen () and as the Christians had during the destruction of Jerusalem. Although the time of destruction was a day of vengeance for the unbelieving Jews, it gives a relief to the believers from their Jewish persecutors. It could also refer to a rest to all eternity for the believers who are in the grave at the Lord's coming, when they rest from all their works, are delivered from sin, Satan's temptations, and persecutions of men (), and to have joy together with the apostles of Jesus Christ and other believers, to obtain 'heavenly glory, rest, and felicity', and have the same crown of glory. * \"When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven\": Jesus Christ has been hidden, since a cloud received him up to heaven out of the sight of the apostles, where he remains until the end of all things, and has not been seen with corporeal eyes by the people on earth since then, except by a very few, such as Stephen and Paul who have only seen him with an eye of faith. Jesus will be revealed at his second coming, and every eye shall see him, descending from heaven. * \"His mighty angels\": will add to the glory, majesty, and solemnity of Jesus' appearance. The words from the original text may be rendered, \"with the angels of his power\", as in the Latin Vulgate, Arabic, and Ethiopian versions. The Syriac version reads, \"with the power of his angels\". They are called his angels, because he created them, and becomes the object of their worship, as he is the Lord of them, and they are ministering spirits to him and his people. They are \"mighty\" angels, because their strength is above all other creatures, as shown in (), that they will be the ministers of Christ's power in gathering the elect from the four winds, and all nations, to come before Christ; and in taking all offenders out of his kingdom, severing the believers from the wicked; and casting the latter into the furnace of fire.John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible \u2013 2 Thessalonians 1:7 ==See also== * Jesus Christ * Paul of Tarsus * Silvanus * Thessalonica * Timothy * Related Bible parts: 1 Thessalonians 1, Revelation 6, Revelation 19 ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== * King James Bible - Wikisource *English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate *Online Bible at GospelHall.org (ESV, KJV, Darby, American Standard Version, Bible in Basic English) *Multiple bible versions at Bible Gateway (NKJV, NIV, NRSV etc.) 01 ",
