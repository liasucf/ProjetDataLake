Baloo was named as one of the top 100 CISO's in 2017, and one of Forbes 100 Women Founders in Europe To Follow in 2018. == Life and career == Baloo studied at Tufts University between 1991\u20131995. She was inspired to study computers after receiving one for Christmas at the age of nine. Baloo's first job was working at a bank dealing with export cryptography problems. She was surprised how cryptography was treated as a \"weapon\", with the USA hiding their security advances from the rest of the world. She had an interest in understanding the difference between mistakes in programming and malicious activity. After graduating Baloo became a network services engineer and consultant at KPN International Consultancy before specialising in fraud and revenue assurance for France Telecom between 2005\u20132009. Baloo then worked at Verizon for nearly 4 years. Baloo believes that the goal of telecommunication attackers is not to bring down services but to shape and intercept traffic without discovery, notably different that attacks on other critical infrastructure like energy or water. In 2012 Baloo became the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at KPN Telecom, a Dutch internet service provider, in the same year that KPN was hacked. During this time Baloo was chairman of the Dutch Continuity Board, which is a collaboration tackling denial-of-service (DDos) cyberthreats through exchanging live attack information between competitors. In an interview with the podcast Cyber Security Dispatch, it was highlighted that Baloo's length of tenure at KPN was considerably longer than the 18-month to 2 year average. She was named as one of the top 100 CISO's in 2017, with only 9 other women named. In 2018, Forbes named Baloo as one of 100 Women Founders in Europe To Follow. In October 2019 Baloo took on her current role as CISO for Avast. One reason why she joined Avast is her love of their mission to ensure \"that cybersecurity is a fundamental right. It\u2019s not just for people who can afford to pay for a product \u2013 it's for everyone\". Baloo holds a faculty position at the Singularity University. She is also a quantum ambassador of KPN Telecom and Vice Chair of the Quantum Flagship Strategic Advisory Board of the EU Commission. She considers quantum computers as inevitable tools that will disrupt current computing architectures, recommending that businesses and organisations prepare themselves for the impact of new quantum protocols. Among her recommendations are to increase key length of current algorithms, use quantum key distribution in niche part of the network, and look at post quantum cryptographic algorithms. Baloo projects that the most exciting development in quantum communication will be beyond the current point-to-point into many-to-many, on demand, instantly. This requires quantum repeaters and other architecture in a managed service, which Baloo predicts could be achieved in 5\u201310 years' time. Baloo is interested in the future of cyber security and how quantum computing may impact privacy. She is an expert in network architecture, security weaknesses in mobile and voice-over-IP, cyrotography, and quantum communication networks. In 2019, the non-profit Inspiring Fifty selected Baloo as one of the fifty most inspiring women in the Netherlands. Baloo considers inequality and distribution of assets as one of the biggest global cyberthreats, with only a handful of countries able to detect, respond or defend against threats. On quantum computing, Baloo comments: > \"You see that happening at Microsoft, at Google, at IBM, the United States > is investing heavily in it [quantum computing], China has billions of > dollars in it...But the rest of the world certainly doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re not > hearing of a quantum computer or post quantum cryptography being developed > in Brazil or in Kenya. What I\u2019m worried about from an infosec point of view, > is that when we have a quantum computer, it\u2019s going to effectively render > our current encryption schemes for public key cryptography moot....So if we > see an evolution where only certain countries will be able to possess this > kind of technology, all of the other countries will be in this \u2018digital > divide\u2019 that the UN always talks about.\" Baloo's advice for women in cybersecurity is to \"Hold onto your passion, and don't shut yourself down. We need you in this industry. Help us keep the world safe\". Baloo has three children. In her spare time she enjoys diving, having dived at the Great Barrier Reef and in the Bahamas, and would consider becoming a diving instructor as an alternative occupation. Baloo is also training for a pilot license. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Baloo has been providing tips for best home working practices on behalf of Avast. == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Computer security specialists Category:Tufts University alumni ",
