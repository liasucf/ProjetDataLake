    "text": "300px Three Bathers (French: Trois Baigneuses) is an 1879-1882 painting by Paul C\u00e9zanne, now in the Petit Palais in Paris. It shows three bathing female nudes framed in an arch formed by two trees. Executed in a typically Impressionist style with short heavy brushstrokes and strong colours, pictorial accuracy and subtlety takes second place to composition and colour. Fellow artist Henri Matisse acquired the work via Ambroise Vollard in 1899 and donated it to the Petit Palais in 1936.. ==References== category:Nude art Category:Paintings of the Petit Palais category:Paintings by Paul C\u00e9zanne category:1882 paintings Category:Bathing in art ",
