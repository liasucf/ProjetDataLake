In 2007, the School District bought land for a new building to house the freshman class to relieve overcrowding at SLHS. This move has met with some opposition due to the separation of the freshman class from the rest of the school. The freshman (9th grade) campus is named the \"Fred T. Korematsu Campus\", after civil rights activist Fred Korematsu who had significant connections to San Leandro. As of the 2017-2018 school year, the campus had its status removed as a 9th grade only campus and now houses the math and foreign language department for all grade levels, with some exceptions. ==Academics== San Leandro High School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges..
