He is the founder of the marketing agency, Livity. Conniff's agency work has led him to receive an entrepreneurial award from Ernst & Young and also collaborate with Google on a major training initiative in Africa. His agency Livity also founded Live magazine, aimed at Millennials. Conniff's agency work and focusing on helping young people led him and his agency to be the recipients of a number of major awards in the UK. These included a Queen's Award for Enterprise, Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year, and a Big Society Award from then Prime Minister, David Cameron. As an author, Conniff released the book Be More Pirate in 2018 with Penguin Random House. ==Early life== Conniff was raised in Croydon, South London. He attended Stanley technical high school up to the age of 16. Conniff then began to study for his A-levels at John Ruskin College, before leaving at 17 to join an outdoor clothing company. In 1995, he moved away from retail to become a chef in nearby Dulwich. While working as a chef, he moved to Interlude De Chavot restaurant, ran by Marco Pierre White. Conniff's final career move was into cosmetics sales, where he spent two years working for Aveda. ==Agency career== He started working for himself in the mid-1990s, starting his first business Supernature. In 1998, he founded a promotions business named Don't Panic. After a couple of years, Conniff made the decision to focus on his new marketing agency, Livity. He officially founded Livity in 2001, the agency was founded after Conniff wanted to bring about what he called \"social change,\" with a focus on young people. Over the next decade, Conniff began to work with numerous companies including Channel 4, Google, and Barclays. Livity and Conniff launched Live magazine, which circulated originally in South and East London. By 2010, the circulation had grown to 35,000 and Conniff announced plans to expand the publication to Glasgow and South Africa. The move into South Africa led to the creation of Livity Africa. Over the years, the magazine has had many notable alumni, who have gone onto work in major roles in media. These have included Jordan Jarrett-Bryan and Julie Adenuga. The agency collaborated with Google to provide training to young Africans, with plans for nearly a million Millennials across the content to receive free training. The success of Livity meant that Conniff was recognized by Ernst & Young, winning the EY social enterprise entrepreneur of the year award in 2011. Around the same time, the UK government named Conniff as an ambassador for social enterprise and then Prime Minister, David Cameron, awarded Livity with its Big Society Award.v He was also recognised in 2013 as part of the Queen's Awards for Enterprise and in 2015 at the National Business Awards. ==Be More Pirate== In 2018, Conniff released his first book, Be More Pirate. The book was published with Penguin Random House. Prior to its release, Conniff learned there was only a small budget to promote his book. He, therefore, flyposted Penguin Random House without their permission to gain publicity for the book. The book follows the premise that rulebreakers, such as pirates of the 1700s, often rewrite the rules that govern society. The book is aimed at millennials, who Conniff believes society has shifted and we are seeing more people not taking traditional rules socially or in their work lives. He stated in an interview with Evening Standard, \"Everyone is taking matters into their own hands. I haven\u2019t met a twentysomething who hasn\u2019t got a hustle or a side-hustle going on. It has become an aspiration in itself.\u201d The success of the book led it to get picked up by a US publisher. Conniff again used creative advertising methods to publicize the book, projecting a message to then Prime Minister Theresa May and President Donald Trump onto the side of the Houses of Parliament. ==Other achievements== While running his agency Livity, Conniff worked as Executive Producer for the TV series, Dubplate Drama. ==References== Category: Living people Category:British non-fiction writers Category:British male writers ",
