The battleship Tirpitz had served as one of the main threats against supply convoys sailing to Murmansk. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, a German naval base was established in Altafjord to prevent convoys from the Western Allies from delivering supplies to the Soviet Union. These supplies were deemed critical to the outcome of the war on the Eastern Front. The Alta area was one of Germany's largest naval bases during the war. Tirpitz, which was one of the world's largest and most powerful battleships, was anchored for nearly two years in K\u00e5fjord. Altafjord was also a base for many other German warships among them the battleship and the heavy cruiser as well as dozens of German destroyers and supply ships. On 12 November 1944, Tirpitz was hit by bombs and the ship capsized in the bay outside of Troms\u00f8. The timber building that the Tirpitz Museum is located in dates from approximately 1880. It was originally built in Lillehammer. It was taken down and sent to Alta in 1946 as part of the effort to help rebuild the war-ravaged region. Initially the building served as the first nursing home in Finnmark. It remained in use until the new nursing home in K\u00e5fjord was built in 1961. ==See also== * List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz ==References== ==Other sources== *Brown, David (1977) Tirpitz: the floating fortress (Naval Institute Press) *Kennedy, Ludovic Henry Coverley (1979) The death of the Tirpitz (Little Brown) *Peillard, Leonce (1983) Sink the Tirpitz!
