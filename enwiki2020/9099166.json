    "text": "The Cookie Jar Kids Network (formerly DIC Kids Network) was a syndicated children's programming block that airs selected Cookie Jar Group shows on local Fox, MyNetworkTV, and independent stations to provide them with a source of E/I programming required by federal law. The block is known on air as simply Cookie Jar. It was first formed in 2003 as the DIC Kids Network, and was syndicated by Tribune Entertainment from 2003 to 2008, and then by Ascent Media. In early 2008, the group announced that they would renew the focus of the block with an emphasis on offering DIC Entertainment programming to additional digital subchannels to meet their E/I needs.DIC E/I Block is Back! 2/17/09 On June 20, 2008, it has been announced that DIC Entertainment would be acquired by Canada-based Cookie Jar Group. On July 23, 2008, the deal was completed, and the block was later relaunched as the Cookie Jar Kids Network. The block ceased to exist on September 18, 2011. National ad sales for the syndicated blocks were handled by Tribune Entertainment with barter basis available. Ads could have stitched together other programs throughout the three blocks. ==History== In January 2003, DIC announced three syndicated children's programming E/I blocks called DIC Kids Network with 200 stations including those owned by Tribune, Sinclair, Clear Channel and Cox signed up to carry the blocks. Margaret Loesch and Donald Roberts, a specialist in kids and media at Stanford University, help develop the blocks. By August, 400 stations had signed 3 to 5 year deals. The block was launched on September 1. With its three feeds, DIC Kids was on Fox, The WB and UPN affiliates and out fulfilled the networks' Saturday morning blocks by December 1. ==Programming== Notes: -Shows marked with a * do not fulfill E/I requirements. -The programming premiere and end dates are based on weekday broadcasts. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ !Title !Premiere date !End date !Source(s) |- |Archie's Weird Mysteries |rowspan=3|September 1, 2003 | | |- | The Littles | | |- |rowspan=2|Sabrina: The Animated Series |November 4, 2003 | |- |August 30, 2004 |April 5, 2006 | |- | Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century |rowspan=2|September 1, 2003 |September 18, 2011 | |- | Stargate Infinity | | |- |rowspan=5|Sabrina's Secret Life |November 10, 2003 |August 25, 2004 | |- |April 10, 2006 |August 30, 2006 | |- |October 2, 2006 |August 28, 2007 | |- |September 5, 2007 |April 5, 2008 | |- |September 4, 2008 |April 4, 2009 | |- | All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series | Late 2003 | | |- |Ace Lightning |rowspan=6|September 2004 | |rowspan=2|https://kidscreen.com/2004/09/01/gini-20040901/ |- | The Berenstain Bears | |- | Liberty's Kids |September 18, 2011 | |- | Inspector Gadget's Field Trip | |https://kidscreen.com/2004/09/01/gini-20040901/ |- | Mummies Alive! * | | |- | Sonic Underground * | | |- | Captain Planet and the Planeteers |rowspan=2|January 2005 | |rowspan=2|https://kidscreen.com/2004/09/01/gini-20040901/ |- | The Smurfs | |- | Trollz | October 3, 2005 | | |- | Strawberry Shortcake | Fall 2006 | | |- | Horseland | September 2007 | | |- |Madeline | September 2008 |September 18, 2011 | |- |- | DinoSquad |rowspan=2|September 2009 | | |- | The Busy World of Richard Scarry | | |- | Noonbory and the Super Seven |rowspan=3|September 2010 |rowspan=3|September 18, 2011 | |- | Will and Dewitt | |- | Wimzie's House | |} ==Lineup== All schedules correspond to markets which opted to carry DIC/Cookie Jar programming on weekdays. Except where affiliates opt to carry programming on weekends instead due to scheduling conflicts including paid programming, religious programming, and local morning newscasts. The block offered three separate exclusive programming feeds. This lineup only shows content that fulfill E/I requirements. 1This programming feed is exclusive to The WB 100+ and that feed was intended for areas where they didn't opt to carry DIC Kids Network programming C programs. The feed was dropped in late 2005. ===2003-2004=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=2|Programming ! Monday ! Tuesday ! Wednesday ! Thursday ! Friday !
