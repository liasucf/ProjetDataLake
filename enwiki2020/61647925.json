It is surrounded by significant public buildings such Clementinum with National library, New City Hall with Mayor of the City of Prague residence and Prague City Council, Clam-Gallas Palace and Trauttmansdorff Palace. == History == Current name of the square is derived from extinct Church of Virgin Mary Na lou\u017ei, which was placed next to the current Clam-Gallas Palace. In 20th century, the square began to be used as a big car parking space. In 2019, Prague City Council decided that the square will be turned into a pedestrian zone. Prague Institute of Planning and Development decided that Czech architectonic studio Xtopic will create a study about how the square should look like in the future. The rebuild should be done by 2024. From European Mobility Week in September 2019, the car park was canceled. Cultural events will take place on the square instead. == References == Category:Squares in Prague Category:Old Town (Prague) ",
