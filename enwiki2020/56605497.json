    "text": "Tinea atmogramma is a species of moth in the family Tineidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1927. However the placement of this species within the genus Tinea is in doubt. As a result, this species has been referred to as Tinea (s.l.) atmogramma. This species is endemic to New Zealand. The wingspan is about 12 mm. The forewings are dark grey, irregularly mixed and suffused with black and with an oblique obtusely angulated whitish stria near the base, as well as three irregular angulated fasciae of two or three suffused white striae each, before and beyond the middle and at four-fifths, the first forming an irregular white spot on the dorsum, the third forming a distinct white dot at the tornus. There are several white dots on the margin around the apex. The hindwings are dark purplish-grey, with an indistinct blackish-sub- basal shade. ==References== ==External links== *Image of type specimen of Tinea s.l. atmogramma.
