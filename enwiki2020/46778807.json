    "text": "The class 3SUB were DC suburban electric multiple units introduced by the London and South Western Railway in 1915 and introduced by the Southern Railway in the period up to 1939. The class designation 3SUB was not used by the Southern Railway, although some authors refer to these units as 3SUB. When rebuilt to four cars in the 1940s, they became class 4SUB. ==Background== The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSC) was the first of the three major companies that were to form the Southern Railway to electrify some of its lines in London. The lines were electrified at 6.7 kV 25 Hz AC, using overhead supply. Public services began on 1 December 1909. The London and South Western Railway (LSWR) electrified its lines on the third rail DC system. Public services began on 25 October 1915. In 1922, the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) sought permission to electrify certain lines in London. On 1 January 1923, the LSBC, LSWR and SECR were merged into the Southern Railway (SR). ==Classes== ===LSWR electric multiple units and trailer sets=== A motor carriage from unit E43 (later 1243) is preserved. Eighty-four electric multiple units, numbered E1\u2013E84, were constructed in 1913 by converting steam-hauled carriages which had been built from 1904 for suburban service. The conversions being carried out at Eastleigh Works. Each multiple unit comprised two motor coaches and a trailer. The units were either or long, depending on whether a or trailer was included. The units weighed 95 tons. They seated between 172 and 190 people in first and third class. These were the first trains on the LSWR not to offer second class accommodation. Electrical equipment was by the British Westinghouse Company, each motor carriage had two electric motors. In 1914, 24 two-coach trailer units were constructed at Eastleigh to work with the multiple units. Each comprised an eight-compartment and a nine-compartment carriage. The trailer sets were either or long and weighed 46 tons. They were third class only. The SR renumbered the electric multiple units 1201-84 and the trailer sets 1001-24. In 1933, eight units were transferred to to work local services to . First class accommodation was reduced to 24, whilst third class was increased to 160. These units returned to London in 1934 and regained their original configuration on the introduction of the 2NOL units. In 1934, some of these units were rebuilt. The motor carriages were given new underframes and lengthened. New motor and unpowered bogies supplied. As rebuilt, they were long. They seated 56 first class and 180 third class passengers. Weights varied between 109 and 114 tons. ===SR electric multiple units and trailer sets=== One of the SR units tackles a flood at station. These units were built by the SR.
