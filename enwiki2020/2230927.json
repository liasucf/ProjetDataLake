    "text": "Gabriel's Fire is an American crime drama television series created by Donald R. Boyle, Coleman Luck and Jacqueline Zambrano that ran on ABC from September 12, 1990 to June 6, 1991 in the United States during the 1990\u201391 television season. A revamped version of the series, entitled Pros and Cons, aired briefly the following season. ==Overview== The main character, Gabriel Bird, was played by James Earl Jones. He was a former Chicago police officer who, over twenty years prior, had been wrongfully sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a fellow police officer. In fact, he shot the officer to protect a defenseless mother and child whom the officer was about to murder in cold blood during a 1969 police raid. Unbeknownst to Bird, the raid had been merely a pretext for the police to attack the members of a militant black nationalist organization. This incident in the character's background was inspired by the 1969 death of Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton, who was shot and killed during a raid upon his residence conducted by Chicago police and other law enforcement personnel. On the show, the street on which the raid involving Bird had occurred was identified as \"Hampton Street\". When Bird is released, he starts working as a private detective, hired by the lawyer who had helped free him. ===Pros and Cons=== ==Characters== *Gabriel Bird, played by James Earl Jones *Jamil, played by Brian K.
