    "text": "Andrew Bruce Wigmore is a British political activist, former diplomat and trap shooter. He is known for his work on the Leave.EU campaign during the UK's 2016 referendum on membership of the European Union, and is a prominent associate of Arron Banks and Nigel Farage. He represented Belize in trap shooting at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. == Life == Andrew Wigmore was born on 1 June 1966 in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. Wigmore is half-Belizean, and holds dual citizenship of Belize and the United Kingdom. He attended the Sacred Heart College in Droitwich in Worcestershire. He has worked in communications mainly privately until 2016 when he was director of communications for Arron Banks' Leave.EU campaign. He also held a role as a Trade & Investment Minister Council at the Belize High Commission in London, a diplomatic position bound by the Vienna Convention. Following Wigmore's highly publicised meeting with then President-elect of the United States Donald Trump complaints arose regarding Wigmore forgoing his \"duty not to interfere in the internal affairs [of another country]\" as an accredited diplomat. Wigmore's role with the Belizean High commission ended on 23 January 2017. In January 2018, Wigmore was stopped by police in the UK for driving without insurance, using illegal diplomatic number plates, and an expired diplomatic ID. Police seized the number plates and documents, but Wigmore was not prosecuted. From September 2015, Wigmore, along with Arron Banks, had multiple meetings with Russian officials posted at the Russian embassy in London. The first contact was with Russian diplomat and suspected spy Alexander Udod, in order to ask for a meeting with Russia's ambassador to Britain Alexander Vladimirovich Yakovenko. == Shooting== Wigmore represented Belize at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in trap shooting. He competed in the men's trap event ranking 31st and 36th respectively on the first and second day of qualification. He failed to qualify any further. He also attempted to represent Belize again at the Rio Olympics but failed to qualify. ==Personal life== Wigmore is married and has two children. ==See also== *Russian interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum == References == Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:People from Chipping Norton Category:English people of Belizean descent Category:Belizean male sport shooters Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Belize Category:Shooters at the 2014 Commonwealth Games ",
