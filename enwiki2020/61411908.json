    "text": "Anisa (\u0391\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03b1) was a town of ancient Cappadocia, inhabited in Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine times. A source described Anisa as a politeumata, which was a township for privileged foreigners. Although it did not control any territory outside its jurisdiction, it enjoyed internal self-government. Its site is located at K\u00fcltepe, Kayseri Province in Asiatic Turkey. A second or first century BCE bronze tablet originating from this settlement revealed that Anisa was a prosperous city. It contained the names of officials (e.g. archons, prytaneis, and demiourgos) as well as various institutions (e.g. boule, ecclesia). The tablet, which was said to be stored at the city's temple of Astarte, also commemorated an act by the Cappadocian king Ariarathes granting the citizens of Anisa a new constitution. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Cappadocia Category:Former populated places in Turkey Category:Populated places of the Byzantine Empire Category:Roman towns and cities in Turkey Category:History of Kayseri Province ",
