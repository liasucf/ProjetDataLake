    "text": "Auzatellodes hyalinata is a moth in the family Drepanidae. It was described by Frederic Moore in 1868. It is found in the north-eastern Himalayas, Sikkim, Burma and northern Yunnan in China. Adults are purplish hyaline (glass like), the forewings with an imperfect basal and subbasal band with a discal point, and an irregular submarginal band with a reddish-brown inner or reverse discal point, crossing both the wings. The reddish-brown colour extends along the veins and the outer marginal border line, dividing a row of white lunules.Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. 1867: 638 ==References== Category:Moths described in 1868 Category:Drepaninae Category:Moths of Asia ",
