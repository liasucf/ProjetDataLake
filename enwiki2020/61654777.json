Retrieved May, 2018. ===Marriage Market=== Junsen Zhang advances Gary Becker's theory of marriage with applications to China's marriage market. Junsen Zhang (1994) suggests that bequest to and marriage of children can lead to a Pareto inefficient allocation.Zhang, J. (1994). Bequest as a Public Good within Marriage: A Note. Journal of Political Economy, 102(1), 187\u2013193. He proves that the assortative mating in bequests can improve or even restore the market's efficiency. Junsen Zhang and William Chan (1999) reject Gary Becker's conjecture that dowry and bride price are two sides of the coin and serve to clear the marriage market and provide an alternative analysis.Zhang, J., & Chan, W. (1999). Dowry and Wife\u2019s Welfare: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis. Journal of Political Economy, 107(4), 786\u2013808. Although Becker's interpretation is retained for bride prices, a dowry is taken as a premortem bequest by altruistic parents for a daughter. Consistent with their theory, they find that a dowry improves the bride's welfare, but a bride price has no effect. Junsen Zhang and Pak-Wai Liu (2003) provide the first empirical evidence on Becker's prediction of the negative assortative mating on spouses' wages.Zhang, J., & Liu, P.-W. (2003). Testing Becker\u2019s Prediction on Assortative Mating on Spouses\u2019 Wages. Journal of Human Resources, 38(1), 99\u2013110. Junsen Zhang also inspects the marriage market in great details using Chinese data. In a joint work with Chong Huang, Hongbin Li, and Pak-Wai Liu, Junsen Zhang finds that a husband's education not only increases his earnings but also the earnings of his wife.Huang, C., Li, H., Liu, P. W., & Zhang, J. (2009). Why Does Spousal Education Matter for Earnings? Assortative Mating and Cross-Productivity. Journal of Labor Economics, 27(4), 633\u2013652. Lena Edlund, Hongbin Li, Junjian Yi, and Junsen Zhang (2013) show that China's sex ratio imbalance incentivizes Chinese men to engage in crime.Edlund, L., Li, H., Yi, J., & Zhang, J. (2013). Sex Ratios and Crime: Evidence from China. Review of Economics and Statistics, 95(5), 1520\u20131534. The association between sex ratio and crime is driven by the adverse marriage market conditions faced by Chinese men. Yoram Weiss, Junjian Yi, and Junsen Zhang (2018) find that the inflow of women from the Chinese mainland to Hong Kong benefits Hong Kong men from the low tail of the attribute distribution.Weiss, Y., Yi, J., & Zhang, J. (2018). Cross-Border Marriage Costs and Marriage Behavior: Theory and Evidence. International Economic Review, 59(2), 757\u2013784. The inflow of mainland women also worsens Hong Kong women's position in the marriage market and thus incentivizes Hong Kong women to work more and for longer hours. In a recent work with David Ong and Yu Yang, Junsen Zhang shows that the sex ratio imbalance in China mainly affects high-income women and lessens their chances of getting married.Ong, D., Yang, Y., & Zhang, J. (2019). Hard to get: the scarcity of women and the competition for high-income men in Chinese cities. Working Paper. ===Fertility and China's Population Control Policy=== In the early 1990s, Junsen Zhang pioneered the use of micro data in the examination of the determinants of Chinese fertility and compliance with China's \"one- child\" policy.Zhang, J. (1990). Socioeconomic determinants of fertility in China - A microeconometric analysis. Journal of Population Economics, 3(2), 105\u2013123.Zhang, J. (1990). Mortality and fertility: How large is the direct child replacement effect in China? Journal of Population Economics, 3(4), 303\u2013314.Zhang, J., & Spencer, B. G. (1992). Who signs China\u2019s one-child certificate, and why? Journal of Population Economics, 5(3), 203\u2013215. Hongbin Li and Junsen Zhang (2007) show that the one-child policy reduces birth rate and thus has a short-run positive effect on China's economic growth.Li, H., & Zhang, J. (2007). Do high birth rates hamper economic growth? Review of Economics and Statistics, 89(1), 110\u2013117. However, the one-child policy has resulted in an aging population in the long run and slow down China's growth.Zhang, H., Zhang, H., & Zhang, J. (2015). Demographic age structure and economic development: Evidence from Chinese provinces. Journal of Comparative Economics, 43(1), 170\u2013185. One line of Junsen Zhang's research examines the effect of population control policy on human capital investment. Mark Rosenzweig and Junsen Zhang (2009) find that the one-child policy has a positive effect on human capital investment via the quantity\u2013quality tradeoff of children, but the effect is at best modest.Rosenzweig, M. R., & Zhang, J. (2009). Do Population Control Policies Induce More Human Capital Investment? Twins, Birth Weight and China\u2019s \u201cOne-child\u201dPolicy. Review of Economic Studies, 76(3), 1149\u20131174. They also criticize the negligence of intra-household allocation when using twin births to obtain variations in family size. Xuebo Wang and Junsen Zhang (2018) go beyond the quantity\u2013quality tradeoff.Wang, X., & Zhang, J. (2018). Beyond the Quantity\u2013Quality tradeoff: Population control policy and human capital investment. Journal of Development Economics, 135, 222\u2013234. They show that the one-child policy reduces the size of the more educated urban population relative to the size of the less educated rural population and thus induces a change in population composition that lowers China's average human capital investment. In a recent work with Junjian Yi and Rufei Guo, Junsen Zhang offers a theory of rationed fertility in which an undesired fertility reduction is less likely to increase a child's human capital investment compared with a desired one.Guo, R., Yi, J., & Zhang, J. (2019). Rationed Fertility: Theory and Evidence. Working Paper. Their findings imply that if promoting human capital investment is one of the main objectives of population control, then \"voluntary\" population control methods are preferred than \"mandatory\" policy instruments. Junsen Zhang (2017) traces the origin of China's one-child policy and is among the first to show that the one-child policy increases divorce and rural migration.Zhang, J. (2017). The Evolution of China\u2019s One-Child Policy and Its Effects on Family Outcomes. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 31(1), 141\u2013160. ===Family Resource Allocation=== Resource allocation within a household is central to the understanding of human behavior and the effectiveness of public policies. Yuk- fai Fong and Junsen Zhang (2001) prove that Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Chiappori's collective model of household decision making can be extended to allow the identification of independent and spousal leisure.Fong, Y., & Zhang, J. (2001). The Identification of Unobservable Independent and Spousal Leisure. Journal of Political Economy, 109(1), 191\u2013202. Hongbin Li, Mark Rosenzweig, and Junsen Zhang (2010) explore the roles of altruism, favoritism, and guilt in family resource allocation.Li, H., Rosenzweig, M., & Zhang, J. (2010). Altruism, Favoritism, and Guilt in the Allocation of Family Resources: Sophie\u2019s Choice in Mao\u2019s Mass Senddown Movement. Journal of Political Economy, 118(1), 1\u201338. They find that a twin who was sent down to the countryside during China's cultural revolution, in comparison with his or her co-twin who stayed in the cities, received a larger amount of wedding gifts from the parents. They are the first to pin down the existence of \"guilt\" that can enforce commitment in social contracts. Together with Junjian Yi, James Heckman, and Gabriella Conti, Junsen Zhang shows that parents respond to a child's health shock with compensatory investment in health and reinforcing investment in education.Yi, J., Heckman, J. J., Zhang, J., & Conti, G. (2015). Early Health Shocks, Intra-household Resource Allocation and Child Outcomes. The Economic Journal, 125(588), F347\u2013F371. Overall, the family acts as a net equalizer in response to early health shocks across children. The support for the elderly is at the heart of family resource allocation that Junsen Zhang has contributed in a series of studies. In two joint works with Kazuo Nishimura, Junsen Zhang shows that the social security program undermines Pareto efficiency of an economy as long as parents can determine their fertility.Nishimura, K., & Zhang, J. (1992). Pay-as-you-go public pensions with endogenous fertility. Journal of Public Economics, 48(2), 239\u2013258.Zhang, J., & Nishimura, K. (1993). The old-age security hypothesis revisited. Journal of Development Economics, 41(1), 191\u2013202. Together with Jie Zhang and Ronald Lee, Junsen Zhang shows that rising longevity increases investment in human capital and physical capital and thus tends to reduce fertility and raises economic growth.Zhang, J., Zhang, J., & Lee, R. (2001). Mortality decline and long-run economic growth. Journal of Public Economics, 80(3), 485\u2013507.Zhang, J., Zhang, J., & Lee, R. (2003). Rising longevity, education, savings, and growth. Journal of Development Economics, 70(1), 83\u2013101. Mark Rosenzweig and Junsen Zhang (2014) find that the prevalence of intergenerational co-residence in China raises the young's savings rate. Their findings suggest that intergenerational co-residence in urban China represents a subsidy to the young by the old, rather than a support from the young to the old.Rosenzweig, M., & Zhang, J. (2014). Co-residence, Life-Cycle Savings and Inter- generational Support in Urban China. NBER Working Paper. Soo Hong Chew, Junjian Yi, Junsen Zhang, and Songfa Zhong (2017) find that more-risk-averse parents have a stronger preference for sons and the births of sons reduce parents' revealed risk aversion by insuring the parents for their old age.Hong Chew, S., Yi, J., Zhang, J., & Zhong, S. (2017). Risk Aversion and Son Preference: Experimental Evidence from Chinese Twin Parents. Management Science, 64(8), 3896\u20133910. In a recent work with Rufei Guo, Junsen Zhang extends and tests Gary Becker's insight that parents seek old-age support from children via the inculcation of filial piety in children.Guo, R., & Zhang, J. (2019). The Effects of Children\u2019s Gender Composition on Filial Piety and Old- Age Support. Working Paper. ===China's Economy=== Junsen Zhang is one of the most prominent economists in the study of the Chinese economy. As previously mentioned, Junsen Zhang is among the first to analyze marriage, fertility, and intra-household allocation using Chinese data. Besides those well-known studies, Junsen Zhang's research on the returns to education in China has attracted wide interests from scholars and policy makers. Tianyou Li and Junsen Zhang (1998) find that education does not increase labor productivity under China's collective farming system, but the productivity returns to education are positive under the household farming system.Li, T., & Zhang, J. (1998). Returns to education under collective and household farming in China. Journal of Development Economics, 56(2), 307\u2013335. Junsen Zhang, Yaohui Zhao, Albert Park, and Xiaoqing Song (2005) estimate the returns to schooling in urban China using a micro sample of China's urban household survey.Zhang, J., Zhao, Y., Park, A., & Song, X. (2005). Economic Returns to Schooling in Urban China, 1988 to 2001. Journal of Comparative Economics, 33(4), 730\u2013752. Together with Hongbin Li, Pak-Wai Liu, and Linda Yung, Junsen Zhang is the first to collect and use a sample of twins in China to identify the returns to education using the within-twin method.Zhang, J., Liu, P.-W., & Yung, L. (2007). The Cultural Revolution and Returns to Schooling in China: Estimates based on twins. Journal of Development Economics, 84(2), 631\u2013639.Li, H., Liu, P. W., & Zhang, J. (2012). Estimating returns to education using twins in urban China. Journal of Development Economics, 97(2), 494\u2013504. Junsen Zhang's research in the Chinese economy spans a large range of topics. In a joint work with Hongbin Li, Pak-Wai Liu, and Ning Ma, Junsen Zhang uses the Chinese twin data to show that members of the communist party have higher endowments compared with non-members.Li, H., Liu, P. W., Zhang, J., & Ma, N. (2007). Economic Returns to Communist Party Membership: Evidence from Urban Chinese Twins. The Economic Journal, 117(523), 1504\u20131520. Mark Rosenzweig and Junsen Zhang (2013) explain the closing gender gap in education by the rising returns to skills and women's comparative advantage in brain-intensive tasks and use variations in the birth weights of Chinese twins to test their explanation.Rosenzweig, M. R., & Zhang, J. (2013). Economic Growth, Comparative Advantage, and Gender Differences in Schooling Outcomes: Evidence from the Birthweight Differences of Chinese Twins. Journal of Development Economics, 104, 245\u2013260. In two joint works with Jun Han, Runjuan Liu, and Beyza Ural Marchand, Junsen Zhang shows that although China's trade liberalization has increased wage inequality in urban China, it reduces consumer prices and thus raises the welfare of all Chinese households, especially that of the poor.Han, J., Liu, R., & Zhang, J. (2012). Globalization and wage inequality: Evidence from urban China. Journal of International Economics, 87(2), 288\u2013297.Han, J., Liu, R., Marchand, B. U., & Zhang, J. (2016). Market structure, imperfect tariff pass-through, and household welfare in Urban China. Journal of International Economics, 100, 220\u2013232. In a recent work with Yi Fan and Junjian Yi, Junsen Zhang documents the rising intergenerational income persistence in China.Fan, Y., Yi, J., & Zhang, J. (2019). Rising Intergenerational Income Persistence in China.
