The number of Italians can only be measured in the number of Italian speakers, people born in Italy and their children, since Finland doesn't collect statistics on ethnicity. ==Demographics== 67% of Finnish Italians are male and 33% are female. 51.3% of Finnish Italians are employed, 9.5% are unemployed and 39.2% are outside the labour force. There are over 200 Italian students in Finland, and over 160 Italian entrepreneurs. 761 Italian men are in a registered relationship with a Finnish woman.http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/fi/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__perh/statfin_perh_pxt_009.px/?rxid=726cd24d-d0f1-416a-8eec-7ce9b82fd5a4 In 2018: *1,133 Finns had a dual Italian citizenship *2,441 Finns had an Italian background *2,709 Finns had an Italian citizenship *2,857 Finns spoke Italian as their native language *2,956 Finns were born in Italy {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Italians by Municipality in 2018 !\u2116 !
