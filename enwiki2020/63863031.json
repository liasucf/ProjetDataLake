Throughout his career, he would only ever race at two racetracks in Puerto Rico. Quintana Hippodrome and Las Monjas Hippodrome. He would never try to prove himself at the international level helping him easily rack up victories without much challenge. With a major highlight victory being the Cl\u00e1sico Luis Mu\u00f1oz Rivera. In the race, he would set a stakes record running the 6-furlong race in 1:19.00 Although it seems slow, at the time the record was hard to break. Taking 9 years till Sirena broke it with a 1:18.60. He was easily able to rack up 21 wins by the end of his 2-year-old season and in July of 1930, he would start one of the greatest winning streaks of all of horse racing. But his 3-year-old season was by far his best season He was even able to take the second jewel of the Puerto Rican triple crown the Governor's Cup. By July of 1931, he had won 39 straight races, which at the time was an all-time record. However, in the latter half of the 1930s Cofresi reset the record with 49 straight victories. Condado would also break Galgo Jr's record with 43 straight victories. However, in 1931 he also set a joint record for most wins in a single season. Sharing this record with the Australian Iron Gelding Jorrocks. To this day that joint record has never been equaled and it likely never will. Although he never reached the same heights again he would continue his success until 1936. He would come close to equalling his joint record when he managed to reach 25 wins in 1935 at the age of 7. He would also either set or equal a total of 8 track records at Quintana Hippodrome and Las Monjas Hippodrome that would range from 5 1/2 furlongs to 9 furlongs. Although none of these records currently stand today. Despite this it he was still a versatile runner he could do it all he could sprint, run at a mile and even further. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Won !Earnings |- |1930 |21 |$7,757 |- |1931 |30 |$9,244 |- |1932 |19 |$6,109 |- |1933 |15 |$2,209 |- |1934 |18 |$2,771 |- |1935 |25 |$2,270 |- |1936 |9 |$949 |} == Later career and death == Galgo Jr. raced well into his 8-year-old season continuing to rack up wins and build his world record. By the end of the year he racked up 9 victories and did not have plans of retirement. However one faithful day on December 21st, 1936 while he was in his training box at Las Monjas Hippodrome he collapsed and died of a heart attack. By then he had raced 159 times won 137 of them with 18-second place finishes 1 third 2 fourths and one race where he finished off the board. He earned a $31,738 on the track which at the time was a record however just like his track records this record didn't last. Despite such a quick and abrupt end to his career Galgo Jr. was still a local hero in Puerto Rico and to this very day he still holds the record for the most wins by a single horse and will forever hold the record of most wins in a single season along with Jorrocks. == References == Category:Horses Category:Puerto Rican racehorses Category:Individual male horses Category:1928 racehorse births Category:1936 racehorse deaths ",
