    "text": "Sfasferia is a former ancient city and bishopric in Roman North Africa. == History == Sfasferia was one of many cities, important enough in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, in the papal sway, to become a suffragan bishopric. Its only historically documented incumbent, bishop Rufus, participated in the synod called at Carthage in 484 by king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom, after which he was exiled like most Catholic participants, unlike their Donatist heretic counterparts. It faded completely, even its site somewhere in modern Algeria hasn't been identified. == Titular see == The diocese was nominally restored in 1933 as Latin titular bishopric of Sfasferia (Latin =Curiate Italian) / Sfasferien(sis) (Latin adjective). It is vacant, having had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank : * Antonio Silvio Zocchetta, Friars Minor (O.F.M.)
