    "text": "Father Was a Fullback is a 1949 black-and-white film from 20th Century Fox based on a comedy by Clifford Goldsmith. The film is about a college American football star and his woes. The film stars Fred MacMurray, Maureen O'Hara, Natalie Wood, and Betty Lynn. ==Plot summary== State College football coach George Cooper (Fred MacMurray) has more than enough problems on the job without his teenage daughter Connie (Betty Lynn) complicating his life at home. She has written a story but no one has agreed to publish it yet. Furthermore she is convinced that she is unattractive to the opposite sex and wallows in frustrated self-pity. Resigning herself to a loveless existence, she decides to make literature her life. When she gets a check for $180 for a fictional article she pens about a teenage bubble dancer that recently appeared in a confessions magazine, the boys come calling. The young author dates a high school football star from across town who chooses to attend State College (rather than Notre Dame University) to be near his newfound sweetheart. She is the first girl he likes more than football. George's football and domestic problems seem to be solved. His wife Elizabeth (Maureen O'Hara) and housekeeper Geraldine (Thelma Ritter) support the family members in distress, while the younger sister Ellen (Natalie Wood) helps Connie and her father out during this difficult time. In the end she feels much like her sister did in the beginning. ==Cast== ===Principals=== Fred MacMurray and Maureen O'Hara in a scene from the film. * Fred MacMurray as George \"Coop\" Cooper, a college football coach * Maureen O'Hara as Elizabeth Cooper, his wife * Betty Lynn as Constance \"Connie\" Cooper, his oldest daughter * Natalie Wood as Ellen Cooper, his youngest daughter * Thelma Ritter as Geraldine, his housekeeper * Jim Backus as Professor \"Sully\" Sullivan, his neighbor (performing under the name, James G.
