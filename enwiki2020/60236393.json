    "text": "Dorak is a village in Mustafakemalpa\u015fa il\u00e7e (district) of Bursa Province, Turkey. Dorak is in northern Turkey, south of Lake Uluabat (also called lake Apaolyont, ), 25 miles west of Bursa, approximately 20 miles south of the Sea of Marmara. Dorak is the supposed origin of drawings of burial artifacts (\"antiquities\") of the Yortan culture made by British archaeologist James Mellaart (known for his 'discovery' of the Neolithic settlement of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck), taken by unknown person/s from shallow graves nearby during the Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u201322. Mellaart was the focus of the Dorak affair, a scandal concerning an unseen and undocumented group of antiquities, the so- called \"Dorak Treasure\", which took place in the 1950s and 1960s in Turkey. Mellaart was expelled from Turkey for suspicion of involvement with the antiquities black market. ==References== Category:Mustafakemalpa\u015fa Category:Villages in Bursa Province ",
