    "text": "Czech alexandrine (in Czech \u010desk\u00fd alexandr\u00edn) is a verse form found in Czech poetry of the 20th century.Wiktor Jaros\u0142aw Darasz,Ma\u0142y przewodnik po wierszu polskim, Krak\u00f3w 2003, p. 61 (in Polish). It is a metre based on French alexandrine.Jacek Baluch, Piotr Gierowski, Czesko-polski s\u0142ownik termin\u00f3w literackich, Krak\u00f3w 2016, p. 37 (in Polish).For more about the French alexandrin, see Roy Lewis, On Reading French Verse. A study of Poetic Form. Oxford 1982, pp.43-69. The most important features of the pattern are number of syllables (twelve or thirteen) and a caesura after the sixth syllable. It is an unusual metre, exhibiting characteristics of both syllabic and syllabotonic (accentual-syllabic) metre. Thus it occupies a transitional position between syllabic and accentual patterns of European versification. It stands out from the background of modern Czech versification, which is modeled chiefly after German practice. The Czech alexandrine is also metrically ambiguous because of its accentuation, which can reflect the rhythms of iambic hexameter, dactylic tetrameter, and combinations thereof.Jerzy (Ji\u0159\u00ed) Lev\u00fd, W sprawie \u015bcis\u0142ych metod analizy wiersza, [in:] Poetyka i matematyka. Edited by Maria Renata Mayenowa, Warszawa 1965, p. 40 (in Polish) Compared with iambic hexameter and dactylic tetrameter, the Czech alexandrine preserves all constants between the two, and allows the rhythms of either to emerge: iambic hexameter: s S _s S s_ S | s S _s S s_ S _(s)_ dactylic tetrameter: S s _s S s_ s | S s _s S s_ s _(s)_ Czech alexandrine: o o _s S s_ o | o o _s S s_ o _(s)_ S=stressed syllable; s=unstressed syllable; o=either. The Czech alexandrine allows these two rhythms run parallel to each other;Compare: Josef Brukner, Ji\u0159\u00ed Filip, Poetick\u00fd slovn\u00edk, Praha 1997, p.18 (in Czech). sometimes the first is stronger, other times the second. In the Czech language the first syllable of every lexical word or prepositional phrase is always stressed, so rhythmical units are: s, S, Ss, Sss, Ssss. A great advantage of the Czech alexandrine is that it can be built of any words (or phrases). A half-line can be composed of 1-syllable words (stressed or unstressed), 2-syllable words, 3-syllable words, and 4-syllable words. Possible combinations in the first half-line (with `|` separating words) include: s|Ss|Ss|S, s|Ss|Sss, Sss|Ss|S, Sss|Sss \u2014 for the second half-line: s|Ss|Ss|S, s|Ss|Sss, Sss|Ss|S, Sss|Sss, s|Ss|Ss|Ss, Sss|SsSs, s|Ss|Ssss, Sss|Ssss. Czech poets usually use both masculine and feminine alexandrine lines, but sometimes they choose to apply only one kind. The first poet to use the Czech alexandrine (in his 1836 poem \"M\u00e1j\") was Karel Hynek M\u00e1cha, considered the greatest Czech poet. Although the discussed metre was theoretically fully iambic, he inserted many trisyllabic words into his lines: S s s S s s | S s s S s S V jezeru zelen\u00e9m b\u00edl\u00fd je pt\u00e1k\u016f sbor, s S s S s S |s S s S s s s a lehk\u00fdch \u010dl\u016fnk\u016f b\u011bh i rychl\u00e9 veslov\u00e1n\u00ed The variation in rhythms can be heard in a formally equivalent paraphrase: \"Hr\u00e1l kdosi na hoboj\" (\"Somebody played oboe\") by Karel Hlav\u00e1\u010dek is a short poem in Czech alexandrines: Karel Hlav\u00e1\u010dek, \"Hr\u00e1l kdosi na hoboj\". Many poets used the Czech alexandrine in the 20th century, both in original works and in translations. Among them there were V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Ji\u0159\u00ed Orten, Ivan Blatn\u00fd, Vladim\u00edr Holan and Old\u0159ich Vyhl\u00eddal. The caesura formula is a good base for enjambment. Sometimes a sentence runs from caesura to next caesura, as in \"The Seventh Elegy\" by Ji\u0159\u00ed Orten:Wiktor Jaros\u0142aw Darasz, Ji\u0159\u00ed Orten - poeta formy kunsztownej, Pami\u0119tnik S\u0142owia\u0144ski, XLIX, 1999, p. 79.
