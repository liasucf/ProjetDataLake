    "text": "The New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit is a component of the NYPD Special Operations Bureau. The unit is uniquely trained and equipped to perform tactical (Special Weapons and Tactics, SWAT) and technical rescue duty for other department elements. Members of ESU are cross-trained in multiple disciplines for police, first aid, and rescue work. The WMD, Weapons of Mass Destruction Unit, is tasked with investigating and responding to any incidents regarding weapons classified as \u201cWeapons of Mass Destruction\u201d and also assisting the Bomb Squad on suspicious package calls. In addition, its Canine Unit helps with searches for perpetrators and missing persons. ESU is always on patrol (all three tours, 365 days a year) with 10 Heavy Rescue trucks, each ordinarily manned by a police officer and a sergeant, and often more than twice as many smaller Radio Emergency Patrol vehicles containing two ESU police officers. There are also two or more citywide patrol sergeants or lieutenants in unmarked vehicles on duty at all times to supervise ESU operations where needed. These are called \"U-Cars\" on the NYPD radio, for example, \"U-5\". ==Field organizations== The 10 Emergency Service Squads (ESS) are divided geographically as: Emergency Service Squads (or Trucks): * ESS-1 (Lower Manhattan), * ESS-2 (Upper Manhattan), * ESS-3 (East and South Bronx), * ESS 4 (West and North Bronx), * ESS-5 (Staten Island), * ESS-6 (South Brooklyn), * ESS-7 (East Brooklyn), * ESS-8 (North Brooklyn), * ESS-9 (South Queens), * ESS-10 (North Queens), * ESS-11 (Assigned to ESU Headquarters), * ESS-14 Hazmat/Rescue Truck, * Apprehension Tactical Team / \"A-Team\" (Citywide) * Additional specialized vehicles strategically stored at designated squad locations ESS-11 is not a patrol squad but a vehicle manned by trainers and support staff assigned to ESU headquarters at Floyd Bennett Field and can respond to nearby incidents or as back-up to other Emergency Service Squads when required. Lieutenants/Sergeants are assigned as citywide patrol supervisors to supervise multiple \"trucks\" (squads). They patrol as either U-5 (Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island) or U-4 (Manhattan and the Bronx) and respond to major incidents within their assigned boroughs for the tour. The ESU Canine Unit maintains 36 dogs-handler teams which include three bloodhounds and several dogs cross-trained in cadaver recovery. The ESU canines are an integral part of the US-TF1 Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Team as deployed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The Apprehension Tactical Team or \"A-Team\" is ESU's full-time tactical element. It was originally stood up as a unit in 1989 in order to supplement the ESU's sometimes overwhelming requirement to perform raids throughout the city. A-Team members strictly perform tactical missions which, on a day-to-day basis are typically High-Risk search warrants. The A-Team is widely considered to have the highest operational tempo of any US tactical team, sometimes performing as many as 800\u20131,000 missions per year. The team can be called upon to support any unit within the NYPD, federal law enforcement agencies or outside police departments upon official request for tactical entries. Members of the Apprehension Team are also utilized as tactical and firearms trainers both within ESU and to other NYPD units. Members of the team are recruited from within ESU, based on team needs and assignment to the team is highly selective. A-Team members are required to maintain all of their periodic ESU certifications and proficiencies, and must be able to support the ESU on any type of operation should the need arise. ESU officers investigate a subway suicide on the IND Queens Boulevard Line platforms at Lexington Avenue - 53rd Street. ==Vehicles== The Emergency Service Unit currently utilizes numerous vehicles including: * Eleven Heavy Rescue trucks which are referred to as \"Trucks\". Trucks 1\u201310 were built by Saulsbury Fire Apparatus (now part of E-One).NYPD ESU Heavy Rescue truck Truck 11 was built by Ferrara Fire Apparatus.NYPD ESU Heavy Rescue truck 11 * 40 Radio Emergency Patrol (REP) trucks which are referred to as \"Cars\" are ESU's work horse and used for regular patrol.

There are minimum time-in-grade requirements before an NYPD officer can apply to transfer to ESU. Police Officers must have a minimum of 5 years in the department with a minimum annual rating of 3.5. Supervisors in the rank of sergeants and lieutenants must have 2 years in rank before being assigned to ESU. In addition, all ESU candidates must be approved by a group of current ESU members to ensure that they will integrate into the unit successfully. ==Casualties/line of duty deaths== ESU lost more members (14 out of 23 NYPD officers) than any other NYPD unit during the World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001. ==ESU in popular culture== ===Books=== * 330 Park a novel by Stanley Cohen * Sniper's Moon a novel by Carsten Stroud * E-Man: Life in the NYPD Emergency Service Unit \u2013 Al Sheppardd's story of ten years in the Emergency Services Unit. * NYPD - On the streets with the Emergency Service Unit by Samuel Katz (1995). ===Films=== * Fourteen Hours (1951) * Leon (1994) (also known as The Professional and L\u00e9on: The Professional) * Godzilla (1998) * The Bone Collector (1999) * Phone Booth (2002) * Inside Man (2006) * 16 Blocks (2006) * World Trade Center (2006) * The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) * Watchmen (2009) * The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009) ===Television series=== Also seen extensively in: * Elementary (2012\u20132019) * Blue Bloods (2010\u2013present) * Castle (2009\u20132016) * CSI: NY (2004\u201313) * Law & Order (1990\u20132010), and its various spinoffs **Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, L&O;: SVU (1999\u2013present) **Law & Order: Criminal Intent, L&O;:CI (2001\u201311) **Law & Order: Trial by Jury, L&O;:TBJ (2005\u201306) * NYPD Blue (1993\u20132005) * Person of Interest (2011\u20132016) * Third Watch (1999\u20132005) * True Blue (1989-1990) * Luke Cage (2016) * Homeland (2017) * Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2018) * 24 (season 8 only) 2018) * The Blacklist (season 6) (E2) ESU guards escorting Reddington ===Video games=== * Max Payne ==See also== * SWAT * New York City Police Department ==References== == External links == * NYPD Homepage * ESU officers * IMDB article on NYPD Emergency Service Unit (2000) A TV documentary.
