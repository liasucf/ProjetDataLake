    "text": "1979 XB is a lost asteroid, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group. It has a short observation arc of 3.9 days and is roughly estimated to be in diameter. The unnumbered minor planet has a poorly constrained orbit and has not been observed in 40 years. It has been listed on the Sentry Risk Table since the list started in 2002. 1979 XB was first observed on 11 December 1979 by astronomers at the Siding Spring Observatory, Australia, when the asteroid was estimated to be from Earth and had a solar elongation of 127\u00b0. The object has never been confirmed by a second observatory. The uncertainty region for this asteroid is now hundreds of millions of kilometers long. == Orbit-fit == With a short 4-day observation arc, the trajectory is poorly constrained and the uncertainties fit numerous different orbits. The perihelion point (closest approach to the Sun) is better known than the aphelion point (furthest distance from the Sun). Due to the uncertainty, the orbital period ranges from 2.4 to 4.2 years. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 0.9em;\" |+Epoch 2019 orbit fits for 1979 XB ! Source ! Aphelion !
