    "text": "\"Reunion\" is the fourteenth episode of the fourth season and 80th episode overall from the Fox series Gotham. The show is itself based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. The episode was written by Peter Blake and directed by co-executive producer Annabelle K. Frost. It was first broadcast on March 15, 2018. In the episode, Ivy decides to go against everyone who harmed her, targeting the Wayne Enterprises foundation charity event. Meanwhile, Nygma continues suffering a mental breakdown regarding his split personality, causing him to consider suicide. Bruce also continues pursuing Alfred to return to his old position to little to no success while Lee meets with Sofia to talk about business. ==Plot== Bruce (David Mazouz) burns down his vigilante's mask. He then goes to meet Alfred (Sean Pertwee), who refuses to return until he shows him \"he's changed.\" Meanwhile, Ivy (Peyton List) arrives at a bar where she uses her plants to hypnotize the bystanders. Lee (Morena Baccarin) meets with Sofia (Crystal Reed), who wants a sizable part of the Narrows' control. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and the GCPD investigate the bar incident and discover that Ivy is responsible, intending to kill Bullock (Donal Logue) for her father's death. At Bullock's apartment, the GCPD watches as Ivy makes a broadcasting message throughout the TV to show her powers. Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) is still getting teased by his personality, to the point he's even considering suicide as a solution to avoid it. Gordon and Bullock find Ivy on a warehouse but she uses her powers to escape and hold Bullock at her control. After battling Bullock with a gun, Gordon knocks him down, breaking Ivy's control. Bruce attends a charity foundation and runs into Alfred, who states that he needs to accept \"who he really is.\" Then, Ivy interrupts the event and uses her plant to kill many people at the event when the GCPD arrives. Bruce dons a suit and rescues many people before being shot by Gordon on his bulletproof vest. However, he manages to escape. Afterwards Bruce finally makes up with Alfred, who returns to the mansion. Sofia meets again with Lee, who refuses her offer for control of the Narrows. However, Sofia kills her bodyguard and smashes Lee's hand with a hammer, stating she now has control of the Narrows, putting Sampson (Stu \"Large\" Riley) as the new head. Nygma opts to return to Arkham instead. However, Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) reappears and he reveals to him that he had specifically written the letter so that his dual personality would read it and take Nygma back to Arkham. With Bullock back on the precinct, Gordon vows to take Sofia down. ==Production== ===Development=== In March 2018, it was announced that the fourteenth episode of the season would be titled \"Reunion\" and was to be written by Peter Blake and directed by co-executive producer Annabelle K.
