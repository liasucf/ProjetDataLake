    "text": "In Hittite mythology, a huwasi stone is sacred to a deity and is usually situated in a temple. Larger huwasi stones were placed in an open area surrounded by trees and other plants. The stones were treated as gods; they were given food and water and were anointed and washed. At any cult centre, the deities who couldn't be given a temple were worshipped at huwasi stones. The term huwasi was used to describe the housing of the sacred stela, the huwasi stone. == References == Category:Hittite mythology Category:Ancient Near East steles ",
