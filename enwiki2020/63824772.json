    "text": "\"A Fool For A Fool\" is a song written by Ike Turner, and released by R&B; duo Ike & Tina Turner in 1964. == Release == \"A Fool For A Fool\" was written by Ike Turner produced by Buck Ram. Ram wrote and produced the B-side \"No Tears To Cry.\" Released as a non-album track in April 1964, the single reached No. 47 on the Cash Box R&B; chart. At the time of the release, Billboard magazine had discontinued their R&B; singles chart from November 30, 1963 to January 23, 1965. Billboard therefore uses Cash Box magazine's stat in their place. \"A Fool For A Fool\" was reissued on the compilation album The Ike & Tina Turner Story: 1960\u20131975 in 2007. == Critical reception == Cash Box (May 2, 1964): \"Chances are Ike & Tina Turner will get back on the big hit track with this Warner Bros. bow. Side to watch is 'A Fool For A Fool,' an infectious rock-a- rhythmic cha cha weeper that has Ike's instrumentalists tastefully backing up Tina's winning (partly) multi-tracked vocal. Backing's a heartfelt beat-balled opus that also rates attention.\" == Track listing == == Chart performance == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Chart (1964) !Peak position |- |US Billboard R&B; Singles | align=\"center\" |47 |- |US Cash Box Top 50 R&B; | align=\"center\" |47 |} == References == Category:1964 songs Category:1964 singles Category:Ike & Tina Turner songs Category:Songs written by Ike Turner Category:Warner Records singles ",
