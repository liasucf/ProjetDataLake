It allows State Highway 87 and State Highway 73 to connect Port Arthur in Jefferson County on the southwest bank of the river. Bridge City in Orange County is on the northeast bank. Construction on the bridge began in 1936 under the guidance of the Texas State Highway Department. Due to concerns by the upstream city of Beaumont about the bridge posing a threat to ship navigation, the Rainbow Bridge was built with a main span. In addition, it has a vertical clearance of , which was intended to allow what was at the time the tallest ship in the US Navy, , passage under the bridge (however, Patoka never did). However, the height of the bridge did allow the construction of jack up offshore drilling rigs at the Bethlehem Steel Beaumont Shipyard. With seventy-two (72) rigs built, the shipyard was one of the major sources of offshore rigs built in the United States. The bridge was completed on September 8, 1938. The nearby town of Prairie View took on the name \"Bridge City\" in response. Initially named the Port Arthur-Orange Bridge, it received its current name in 1957. The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. == Veterans Memorial Bridge == In 1988, construction began on the Veterans Memorial Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge. This bridge runs parallel to the Rainbow Bridge, and was dedicated on September 8, 1990. With a vertical clearance of , the bridge is somewhat shorter than its neighbor. After the completion of the Veterans Memorial Bridge, the Rainbow Bridge was closed for renovations. On its re-opening in 1997, the Rainbow Bridge became one way, handling westbound traffic only. The Veterans Memorial Bridge serves eastbound traffic. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Jefferson County, Texas * List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Texas == Notes == == Sources == * Rainbow Bridge in the Handbook of Texas * * ==External links== Category:Bridges completed in 1938 Category:Bridges completed in 1990 Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Texas Category:Buildings and structures in Jefferson County, Texas Category:Buildings and structures in Orange County, Texas Category:Cable-stayed bridges in the United States Category:Truss bridges in the United States Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Texas Category:Transportation in Jefferson County, Texas Category:Transportation in Orange County, Texas Category:Road bridges in Texas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Orange County, Texas Category:Steel bridges in the United States Category:1936 establishments in Texas Category:Public Works Administration in Texas ",
