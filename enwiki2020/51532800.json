It was released to radio on September 19, 2016 as the second single to his second studio album California Sunrise. The song was written by Rhett Akins, Jesse Frasure and Ashley Gorley. \"Dirt on My Boots\" is Pardi's second number-one single, following \"Head Over Boots\" in taking the top spot on the Country Airplay chart. It also peaked at numbers two and 37 on both the Hot Country Songs and Hot 100 charts respectively. It's currently Pardi's only solo top 40 hit on the Hot 100. The song was certified 3x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 695,000 copies in the United States as of September 2017. It achieved similar success in Canada, reaching number one on the Country chart and number 58 on the Canadian Hot 100. The song garnered a Gold certification from Music Canada, denoting sales of 40,000 units in that country. The music video for the single was shot entirely in black-and-white and features Pardi practicing for a show while his girlfriend watches him. It was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2017 CMT Music Awards. For promotion, Pardi first performed the song live on Late Night with Seth Meyers and would make later appearances on Good Morning America and the Country Music Association Awards. ==Background== The song was written by Rhett Akins, Jesse Frasure and Ashley Gorley, and it is one of the songs on the album that Pardi did not have a hand in writing. Pardi was interested in creating more modern-sounding tracks, and he described the demo of the song as \"super-hip-hop\". But as he liked the lyrics and thought the content of the song country, they decided to make the song more country. ==Critical reception== On October 1, 2017, Billboard contributor Chuck Dauphin put \"Dirt on My Boots\" at number three on his top 10 list of Pardi's best songs. On November 8, it was nominated for Single of the Year and Song of the Year at the 51st Annual Country Music Association Awards, but lost both awards to Keith Urban's \"Blue Ain't Your Color\" and Little Big Town's \"Better Man\" respectively. On March 11, 2018, it was nominated for Country Song of the Year at the 2018 iHeartRadio Music Awards, but it went to \"Body Like a Back Road\" by Sam Hunt. ==Commercial performance== \"Dirt on My Boots\" debuted at number 49 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart the week of October 8, 2016, after it was released to radio.
