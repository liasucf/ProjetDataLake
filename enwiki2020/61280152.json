    "text": "Beverly Caimen (born June 20, 1994), known mononymously as Beverly (\u30d3\u30d0\u30ea\u30fc), is a Filipino pop singer based in Japan under the Avex Trax label. She performs the opening theme of Kamen Rider Build, \"Be the One\" as a guest vocalist of the band created for the series, Pandora. For her solo debut, she sang \"Everlasting Sky\", the theme song for Kamen Rider Build the Movie: Be the One and subsequently released her debut solo album titled 24. ==Early life== Beverly Caimen was born on June 20, 1994 in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines as the third child to Ramon Vega Caimen and Leticia Valdez Lumbres, having a brother and two other sisters. Beverly began singing at the age of 5 when her mother sent her to school and found out she had a talent for it. She joined her school's choir at the age of 7 and began taking voice lessons at 9 when her mother found time. It was around this time she entered her first singing competition, but she didn't win. Even so, her mother encouraged her to continue as she needed more experience. She graduated from Batangas State University with a B.S. in Psychology. ==History== Beverly began chasing after her dreams by joining various amateur singing competitions. She won first place at the World Championships of Performing Arts, where she recorded songs under GMA Records and worked with composer Vehnee Saturno. Beverly received a Best Performance nomination from Awit Awards and won the Harvest of Honors award from the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and the Best Performance award from the A Song of Praise Music Festival Year 3. Beverly had always loved Japanese music, having watched a lot of anime and Japanese dramas while in the Philippines. She had always wanted to travel to Japan, and when Saturno asked his business partner in Japan to give Beverly's songs a listen, they eventually came to audition her, and she got to do just that. With Beverly finally in Japan in 2015, she attended singing and dancing workshops and signed with Avex Trax in 2016. At the annual A-Nation event, she was appointed as the 'Shooting Act', the name to look out for, for an up-and- coming artist. The reaction she received was very positive, which lead to her being included in the Disney Magical Pop Christmas album. She also front-acted Ariana Grande's Dangerous Woman Tour in 2017. Beverly's big break came when her song \"I Need Your Love\" was used in the Fuji TV drama Crisis starring Oguri Shun and Nishijima Hidetoshi. The music video garnered more than five million views and topped download platforms like iTunes and Recochoku in Japan. Beverly released her debut album Awesome on May 31, 2017. It peaked at No. 8 on the Oricon weekly albums chart, and is her highest ranking release to date. Beverly released her second album 24 on June 20, 2018. It includes the singles \"All I Want\" and \"Love Therapy\". The album reached No. 16 on the Oricon weekly albums chart and charted for a total of six weeks. == Discography == === Albums === ====Studio albums==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" style=\"width:5em;\" | Peak chart positions |- ! ! style=\"width:2.5em;\"|JPN Oricon |- ! scope=\"row\" | Awesome | * Released: May 31, 2017 * Label: Avex Trax * Formats: CD, digital download, streaming | 8 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 24 | * Released: June 20, 2018 * Label: Avex Trax * Formats: CD, digital download, streaming | 16 |- |} ====Mini albums==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" style=\"width:5em;\" | Peak chart positions |- ! ! style=\"width:2.5em;\"|JPN Oricon |- ! scope=\"row\" | Tell Me Baby | * Released: December 28, 2016 * Label: Avex Trax * Formats: CD, digital download, streaming | \u2013 |- |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Album |- | \"Just Once Again\" |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|2017 |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|Awesome |- | \"I Need Your Love\" |- | \"Xmas with You\" |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\" |- | \"A New Day\" |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"5\"|2018 |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"4\"|24 |- | \"All I Want\" |- |\"Baby Don't Cry ~Kamisama ni Fureru Kuchibiru~\" |- | \"Love Therapy\" |- | \"Faces Places\" |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|90s & New Revival |} ===Soundtrack appearances=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Album |- | \"Despacito\" |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|2017 |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|Rank Oukoku |- | \"Everlasting Sky\" |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|2018 |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|Gekijouban Kamen Rider Build Be the One |- | \"Power of the Dream / Endless Harmony\" |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|Fairy Tail |- | \"Adventure\" | rowspan=\"8\" align=\"center\" |2019 |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|Tales of Asteria |- | \"Again\" |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|Fruits Basket |- |\"The Answer\" (with William Aoyama) | rowspan=\"3\" |Astral Chain |- |\"Dark Hero\" (female version) |- |\"Savior\" (with William Aoyama) |- | \"Sagashi ni Ikou yo\" |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|Saga Television |} ===Compilation appearances=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Album |- | \"A Whole New World [Aladdin\" (with Satoshi Hayashibe) |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|2016 |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|Disney Magical Pop Christmas |- | \"As Long as There's Christmas [Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas]\" (with Saho Aono) |- | \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes [Cinderella] |- | \"Ai wo Kanjite [Lion King]\" |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|2017 |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|Thank You Disney |- | \"Yume wa Hisoka ni\" |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|2018 |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|Dream2 ~Disney Greatest Songs~ |} ===As featured artist=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+ ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Album |- | \"Be the One\" (Pandora featuring Beverly) |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|2018 |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|Thank You Disney |- | \"Guardian\" (Tetsuya Komuro featuring Beverly) |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"| |} == References == Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Filipino female pop singers Category:Singers from Laguna (province) Category:People from Calamba, Laguna Category:Filipino expatriates in Japan Category:Avex Trax artists ",
