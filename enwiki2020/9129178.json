    "text": "The Lisburn\u2013Antrim line is a railway line of Northern Ireland Railways. It links Knockmore Junction on the Belfast\u2013Newry line with on the Belfast\u2013Derry line. It has been closed to passenger service since 2003. ==History== The line opened in 1871 as the Dublin and Antrim Junction Railway.Hajducki, 1974, pages 5, 9 The train service on the line was provided by the Ulster Railway until 1876, and by the Ulster Railway's successor the Great Northern Railway thereafter.Hajducki, 1974, page xiii In 1879 the D&A; Junction ceased to be a separate company and was absorbed by the GNR. ==Current status== The line is currently closed to passengers after all rail services were withdrawn from the line in June 2003. The stations at , , and Crumlin have all been closed. Translink's reason for closing the line was that it was unable to maintain two routes to Antrim economically. The \u2013Antrim line, which had been closed since 1978, was reopened in 2001, providing a faster route between , Antrim and . Translink operated a skeleton service on the line, but then gave notice that it would be shut. The route is still maintained and is used for crew training and train diversions, for example, for passenger services on 9 and 23 October 2011 when there were weekend engineering works at . Speculation remains that the line could one day re-open under plans to operate a Belfast -- Lisburn -- Antrim -- Belfast circular route, with the possibility of a station for Belfast International Airport which is close to the line at Aldergrove. Translink's future plans include re-opening this line, allowing trains from Derry to run once per hour on an alternating pattern between Bleach Green and Knockmore. In 2012, a section of railway embankment, weakened by weather near , gave way as a train was about to pass over. The driver managed to stop and reverse the train away without incident. The embankment has since been repaired. In January 2015, the two passing loops on the line, at Crumlin and , were decommissioned and removed, leaving no more passing points on the line. On Monday 12 September 2016, the Democratic Unionist Party announced that they would propose a motion to re-open the line as part of an Airport Link. It could mean that services could resume on the line in the near future. It would likely mean that would be replaced by the new station at the site of the old SERC building a little further down the line. On Sunday 10 November 2019, units 3002+3003 worked a radio test train over the NIR network, but the Lisburn to Antrim branch was excluded.Rail Express No 284 p96 January 2020 issued 20 December 2019 ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== *Translink - Northern Ireland Railways Category:Great Northern Railway (Ireland) Category:Railway lines in Northern Ireland Category:Transport in County Antrim Category:Lisburn Category:Antrim, County Antrim Category:Irish gauge railways ",
