The trophy is now manufactured by Ottewill Silversmiths in Ashford.https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/820941 The current trophy is made from silver and gold and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns. The columns, shaped as stumps and bails, represent the three fundamental aspects of cricket: batting, bowling and fielding, while the globe characterises a cricket ball. It stands 60 cm high and weighs approximately 11.0567 kilograms. The names of the previous winners are engraved on the base of the trophy, with space for a total of twenty inscriptions.

The trophy was designed and produced in London by a team of craftsmen from Garrard & Co (the Crown Jewellers).
