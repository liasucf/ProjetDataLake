    "text": "Marzio Masturzo (17th century) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period, active near his natal city of Naples. He was a pupil of Paolo Greco, then, along with Salvatore Rosa, a fellow-pupil of Aniello Falcone. Like Falcone, he often painted battle scenes. He appears to have joined during the Masaniello revolt, a loose fraternity of artists called the Compagnia della morte involved in the rebellion. ==References== * Category:17th-century Neapolitan people Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Neapolitan painters Category:Italian Baroque painters Category:Italian battle painters ",
