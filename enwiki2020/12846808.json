The entire length of U.S. Route 27 in Indiana is included in the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other U.S. Highways in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were 3,090 vehicles and 580 commercial vehicles used the highway daily from SR 28 to Jay County line. The peak traffic volumes were 41,790 vehicles and 2,570 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of US 27 just north of downtown Fort Wayne. ==History== The original route of US 27 was signed as three different state roads in 1918. Old SR 48 from Ohio state line to Liberty, Old SR 48 headed west on what is now known as SR 44\\. The section was from Liberty to Fort Wayne has Old SR 21\\. Old SR 46 was the original number given the a segment from Auburn to Angola. The section between the Old SR 21 and Old SR 46 was known as Custer Trail. In 1924, the section north of Fort Wayne became Old SR 13 and went from Fort Wayne to the Michigan state line. US 27 in Indiana is one of the original US Highways of 1926, then connecting Cheboygan, Michigan with Cincinnati through Fort Wayne. In November 1967, Indiana completed its northern segment of Interstate 69, the last incomplete section being opened between Angola and the Michigan/Indiana state line, supplanting US 27 as a through route. Interstate 69 north of Fort Wayne had been completed in stages, the designation of US 27 was moved to the interstate. Some segments of old US 27 remained as state highways with designations as SR 327, SR 427, and SR 127\\. Parts of these routes, comprising what had been the old surface road of US 27, were eventually returned to country governments. Within greater Fort Wayne, US 27 was diverted from Coldwater Road to Lima road. Then in 2001, INDOT removed the US 27 designation north of its interchange with I-69. On March 9, 2007, legislation was introduced in the Indiana House of Representatives to designate US 27 as historic highway. Richmond, one of the cities through which US 27 passes, would have two historic highways passing through it as the original National Road (U.S. Route 40) runs through Richmond as well. == Major intersections == ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== *http://highwayexplorer.com/EndsPage.php?id=2006&section;=1 Indiana 27 Category:Transportation in Fort Wayne, Indiana Category:Transportation in Adams County, Indiana Category:Transportation in Union County, Indiana Category:Transportation in Wayne County, Indiana Category:Transportation in Randolph County, Indiana Category:Transportation in Jay County, Indiana Category:Transportation in Allen County, Indiana ",
