But in northern England, a quarter pint could also be called a jack or a noggin, rather than a gill, and in some areas a half pint could be called a gill, particularly for beer and milk.International Dictionary of Food and Cooking by Charles Gordon Sinclair, , published by Taylor & Francis, 1998 In Ireland, the standard spirit measure was historically gill.

Frank Baum's The Patchwork Girl of Oz, one of the ingredients required for a magic spell is a gill of water from a dark well. In chapter 19, the obscure unit is used for humor including a pun with the nursery rhyme \"Jack and Jill\", which also involved a well. * In George Orwell's Animal Farm, Moses the Raven is allotted a gill of beer a day after he returns, with the implication that this is part of his payment for supporting the farm leaders, the pigs. * Dan Simmons' novel, The Terror (2007), makes frequent references to gills of grog and rum. * In Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island there are uses of the measure gill, with Israel Hands drinking a gill of brandy in the chapter 'I Strike the Jolly Roger'. ===Music=== *The cumulative song \"The Barley Mow\". *In The Doors song \"The Crystal Ship\", the line, \"the crystal ship is being filled a thousand girls,\" some people report that \"girls\" should be \"gills\". ===Television=== * A gill is also referenced in Archer season 2, episode 3 (\"Blood Test\") when Barry explains to Archer that a litre is, \"about 8 gills\". (Eight gills would be , or .) *In \"Bart the Genius,\" an episode of The Simpsons, a child tricks Bart by offering, \"I'll trade you 1,000 picolitres of my milk for four gills of yours.\" (A picolitre is a trillionth of a litre, so Bart is losing almost a pint of milk in this exchange.) ===Mispronunciation=== Because of its more widely used homograph, gill is often mispronounced with a hard 'g' sound. * FX's animated cartoon Archer, mispronounced gill in the episodes \"Blood Test\" (Season 2, Episode 3) and \"Heart of Archness: Part Three\" (Season 3, Episode 3). * Television host Stephen Fry mispronounced gill in a 2013 edition of the BBC TV programme QI. ==Notes== Category:Units of volume Category:Imperial units Category:Customary units of measurement in the United States Category:Alcohol measurement Category:Cooking weights and measures ",
