One of the first steps taken was to appoint Dubai based AUH Motorsports to manage the championship, based on their experience and expertise in having run the regional Radical Sportscars series for several years. In February 2016, the championship was launched in spectacular fashion in front of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, with the public unveiling of the car undertaken by HH Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, the Minister of Culture and Knowledge Development and Chairman of the General Authority for Youth and Sports Welfare, and Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President of the ATCUAE.http://www.thenational.ae/sport/motorsport/uae- formula-4-championship-holds-promise-for-new-generation-of-emirati-drivers Following the launch in February 2016, the car was given its first test around the Dubai Autodrome, driven by Dubai-born Indy Lights driver Ed Jones.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FEW1uvA8s0 ==Format== The inaugural 2016\u201317 championship will feature eighteen races over six weekends, four of which will be held at the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi, with the remaining two at the Dubai Autodrome. ==Car== The championship features Tatuus designed and built cars.http://www.tatuus.it/formula4.php The cars are constructed out of carbon fibre and feature a monocoque chassis. The engine is a 1.4 turbo Abarth. This combination of chassis and engine is the same as that already used in the Italian F4 Championship,http://www.f4championship.com/ F4 Spanish Championship, ADAC Formula 4 and SMP F4 Championship. ==Champions== ===Drivers=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center\" !Season !Driver !Team !Races !Poles !Wins !Podiums !Fastest lap !Points !Margins |- ! 2016\u201317 |align=left| Jonathan Aberdein |align=left| Team Motopark | 18 | 10 | 14 | 16 | 12 | 368 | 107 |- ! 2017\u201318 |align=left| Charles Weerts |align=left| Dragon Motopark F4 | 23 | 3 | 8 | 16 | 9 | 377 | 52 |- ! 2019 |align=left| Matteo Nannini |align=left| Xcel Motorsport | 20 | 6 | 7 | 16 | 7 | 363 | 68 |- ! 2020 |align=left| Francesco Pizzi |align=left| Xcel Motorsport | 20 | 3 | 8 | 10 | 5 | 300 | 26 |} ===Teams=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center\" !Season !Team !Drivers !Poles !Wins !Podiums !Fastest lap !Points !Margins |- ! 2016\u201317 |align=left| Team Motopark | 2 | 10 | 14 | 31 | 18 | 629 | 390 |- ! 2017\u201318 |align=left| Dragon Motopark F4 | 3 | 3 | 9 | 19 | 10 | 580 | 19 |- ! 2019 |align=left| Xcel Motorsport | 5 | 8 | 11 | 30 | 11 | 632 | 171 |- ! 2020 |align=left| Xcel Motorsport | 6 | 3 | 11 | 32 | 9 | 595 | 182 |} ===Rookie=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center\" !Season !Driver !Team |- ! 2016\u201317 |align=left| Logan Sargeant |align=left| Team Motopark |- ! 2017\u201318 |align=left| David Schumacher |align=left| Rasgaira Motorsports |- ! 2019 |align=left| Matteo Nannini |align=left| Xcel Motorsport |- ! 2020 |align=left| Francesco Pizzi |align=left| Xcel Motorsport |} ==References== ==External links== * F4 UAE Official Website * ATCUAE Website * AUH Motorsport Website Category:Formula racing series Category:Motorsport in the United Arab Emirates Category:One-make series Category:Motorsport competitions in the United Arab Emirates ",
