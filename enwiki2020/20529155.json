    "text": "Paul-Philippe de Chaumont (1617 \u2013 24 March 1697, Paris) was a French prelate. He was the second member elected to occupy seat 3 of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1654. From an old family in Vexin where he was count of Chaumont, he was the son of a conseiller d'\u00c9tat, the author of many theological works as well as the king's librarian.Michel de Marolles, Suite des M\u00e9moires de Michel de Marolles, 1657, p. 247. A relation of Pierre S\u00e9guier and a relation via his mother of the three Haberts (Philippe Habert, Germain Habert and Henri-Louis), Paul-Philippe succeeded his father as king's librarian, having joined the royal library as king's reader. Although he had not yet written any works himself he was elected a member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1654. Becoming bishop of Dax in 1671, he resigned this post in 1684 so he would be freer to devote himself to studies, although continuing to preach. Jean Chapelain said of him that \"he had nothing lacking in his spirit, and had a great grasp of language and preached boldly and easily.\"Tyrt\u00e9e Tastet, Histoire des quarante fauteuils de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise depuis la fondation jusqu'\u00e0 nos jours, 1635-1855, volume II, 1855, p. 33. This is also the source of biographical details in this article. In 1685, he presided over the session of the Acad\u00e9mie which pronounced the exclusion of Antoine Fureti\u00e8re. In 1693, he published a two-volume work entitled R\u00e9flexions sur le christianisme enseign\u00e9 dans l'\u00c9glise catholique. According to the abb\u00e9 d'Olivet, this treatise's style \"responded no less to its author's quality as a historian than the subject responded to his character as a bishop.\" ==References== ==External links== *Biography at Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise Category:Bishops of Dax Category:Members of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise Category:1617 births Category:1697 deaths ",
