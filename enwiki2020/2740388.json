    "text": "Marta Bohn-Meyer (18 August 1957 - 18 September 2005) was an American pilot and engineer. Marta Bohn-Meyer was born in Ammityville, New York. Marta Bohn- Meyer served as chief engineer of the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. Bohn-Meyer was involved in a variety of research projects at NASA -- she was the first female crewmember assigned to the Lockheed SR-71, serving as navigator during studies of aerodynamics and propulsion that used the SR-71 as a testbed. She was also project manager in a study of advanced laminar flow wing design using the General Dynamics F-16XL aircraft. Bohn-Meyer was an accomplished Unlimited aerobatic pilot, and was twice a member of the United States Unlimited Aerobatic Team. She also served as Team Manager in 2005. Bohn-Meyer died while practicing for the 2005 U.S. National Aerobatic Championships when the Giles 300 aerobatic aircraft she was piloting crashed in Yukon, Oklahoma, near the Clarence E. Page Municipal Airport. The cause of the crash was deemed to be the catastrophic failure of the front hinge of the canopy - which apparently incapacitated her and led to the crash. Her husband was Robert R. Meyer, Jr., a project manager and flight test engineer at Dryden. Bohn-Meyer was a 1979 graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. At that time she met her husband, Bob Meyer, during an internship at NASA. In addition to excelling in her aerospace career, Bohn- Meyer served as a role model to young girls interested in technical career fields. She could often be found in classrooms encouraging young women to explore career fields that have so long been dominated by women. ==References== == External links == *Biography from NASA *Official NASA press release Category:1957 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Accidental deaths in Oklahoma Category:Aerobatic pilots Category:American female aviators Category:American women engineers Category:Aviators killed in aviation accidents or incidents in the United States Category:20th-century American engineers Category:20th-century women engineers Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in 2005 ",
