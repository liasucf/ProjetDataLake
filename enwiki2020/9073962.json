    "text": "McClain High School is a public high school in Greenfield, Ohio, United States. It is part of the Greenfield Exempted Village Schools district. == History == The Edward Lee McClain High School, 1922 The school was a gift to the community in 1912 from the inventor and local industrialist Edward Lee McClain. Construction on the school started in 1914, with the first classes held beginning in 1916. The building was designed by architect William B. Ittner. The McClain family later donated a vocational building, natatorium, and athletic fields adjoining the high school in 1923, at the same time that the community began construction of a new elementary building. The school was almost torn down due to the high cost of remodeling and lack of finances. A large-scale community and historical effort led to the high school being saved. It is listed as an Ohio Historical Society landmark.Ohio Historical Society, OhioHistory.org , Columbus OH. == Athletics == The school is a member of the Ohio High School Athletic Association and participates in the Frontier Athletic Conference (FAC).
