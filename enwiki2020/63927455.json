In 1790 he acquired from Count Giuseppe Camuti the feu of Belvedere comprising the Tower of Rusino (it), Madurera (Tizzano), Moragnano, Musiara etc and in this way became acknowledged Count of Belvedere (13/04/1790).Dizionario Biografico dei Parmigiani Roberto Lasagni, Istituzione Biblioteche del Comune di Parma, retrieved 08 June 2020 In 1792 he was nominated major duomo to Duke Ferdinand of Bourbon.Le Ville Parmensi \u2013 Lodovico Gambara Parma 1966 p64-65Palazzi e Casate di Parma \u2013 Ludovico Gambara \u2013 Parma 1971 \u2013 p60, 92, 749-752Dizionario dei Parmigiani - Fabrizio Marcheselli \u2013 Parma 1997 p175.Dizionario Biografico Dei Parmigiani Illustri O Benmeriti: Nelle Scienze, Nelle Lettere e Nelle Arti, O Per Altra Guisa Notevole \u2013 Giovanni Battista Janelli \u2013 Genova 1877 p212-213Le Antiche famiglie Nobili e Notabili di Parma e I Lori Stemmi Maurizio de Meo Vol II D-M Parma 2002 p138, p237 In 1809 he became \u201cMaire\u201d of Parma (at the time of the French occupation). Between 1814 and 1815 he was Podesta of Parma. He further became a Counsellor of State and President of the Council of Census. ==Villa== Between 1810 and 1820 Pietro had constructed a villa in Fraore on a considerable area of land that the family had acquired over the years. The villa, originally referred to as Villa Leggiadri Gallani became Villa Panizzi. (See \"Le Ville Parmensi\") and in the early 2000s had badly deteriorated. Following sale to a new owner the villa (now renamed Villa Leggiadri-Gallani) was restored by Architects Fabio Corrradi, work starting in 2013. ==Honours== His honours and appointments were as follows: * 1813 Cavaliere of the Imperial Order of Riunione (Order abolished with the fall of the Napoleonic Empire in 1815). * 10/09/1810 - Nominated President of the Assembly of San Donato * 30/06/1811 - Nominated member of the Legion of Honour * Member of the Noble Philharmonic Academy of Parma * President of the Electoral College of the district of Parma convened in 1812 * 11/02/1813 - Nominated Rector of the Academy of Fine Arts of Parma * 11/12/1818 - Elected Cavalier of the Order of Constantine. * 17/03/1821 - Member of the Tribunal of Counts. * In 1814 he became honorary President of the University of Parma. * In 1817 he was created a member of the Legion of Honour (at the time of Marie Loiuse). See also 1811. == Marriage == He married Countess Amalia Simonetta on 08/09/1806 when he was 43 and she 20. [As evidenced by entry number 1295 in the alphabetical list of entries in the Parma State Archives \"Atti di Matrimonie\" and the actual marriage entry (nr 110 - in French).Parma State Archives \u2013 Atti di Matrimonie - Alphabetical List of Entries Entry nr 1295 \u2013 Marriage Entry nr 110 (in French).Antonio Cerati the philologist and writer wrote an epistle on the occasion of the marriage.Epistola a Pietro Leggiadri Galani In Occasione di Sue Nozze con Amalia Simonetta di Antonio Cerati. He and Amalia Simonetta had 10 children.

The first Giuseppe died at the age of 8 on 04/07/1815. ==Death== He died on 07/11/1825, aged 63 only 2 years after the birth of his last daughter, Teresa in 1823, and his funeral service was held at the church of San Benedetto in Parma. Chiesa di San Benedetto (Parma) After his death, his widow commissioned a marble plaque with a latin inscription executed by Don Ramiro Tonani. It was erected on a wall of the church but was apparently lost when the church was damaged during the second world war. The new Viletta cemetery was constructed between 1817 and 1823, Napoleon having decreed that people were not to be buried in churches. Pietro was in fact buried in the \u201cCapella\u201d of the \u201cOrdine Constantiniano di San Giorgio\u201d in the South Gallery of La Viletta. The Villetta archives state that he was buried there on 09/11/1825. :it:Gazetta di Parma 15 Nov 1825. His death certificate states that he died at Nr 7 Borgo delle Colonne. The book \" Palazzi & Casate di Parma\" states that Pietro and his family lived in 5 Borgo Colonne (Casa Hotz) in central Parma. This appears to be incorrect since the census records all indicate that the family lived at 7 Borgo Colonne. His will was made on 13th February 1825 leaving his estate to his 5 sons. The census of 1809 indicates Pietro aged 45 and Amalia aged 22 living in 7, Borgo Colonne with their son Giuseppe aged 1, together with Pietro's father Giuseppe and mother Maddalena. The census of 1828 indicates the widowed Amalia living in 7, Borgo Colonne with three of her children, Tullo (16), Adelaide (15) and Paolo (10). The census of 1830 indicates the widowed Amalia aged 42 living in 7, Borgo Colonne with two of her children, Tullo (19) and Paolo (12). The census of 1831 indicates the widowed Amalia aged 43 living in 7, Borgo Colonne with three of her children, Tullo (20), Adelaide (15) and Paolo (10). On the East side of Parma there is a street named after him: \"Via Pietro Leggiadri Gallani - Uomo Di Stato\". == References == Category:1762 births Category:1825 deaths Category:18th-century Italian politicians Category:19th-century Italian politicians Category:People from Parma ",
