He appeared in all 16 games (7 starts) as a rookie. After playing the first 9 games on special teams, he filled in at left guard for 4 games for an injured Kendyl Jacox, before switching to right guard to replace an injured LeCharles Bentley for the last two contests.

On August 28, Holland was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a fifth-round pick (#158-Matt Tennant) in the 2010 NFL Draft. ===Dallas Cowboys=== In 2008, the Dallas Cowboys acquired Holland because they needed depth in the offensive line after Kyle Kosier missed 13 games with a foot injury. He appeared in 7 games (2 starts) In 2009, the Cowboys tried to convert him into a backup center, but because this was a new position to him, he was not effective.

In 2012, the Cowboys couldn't agree with Holland on a new contract and he decided instead not to play professional football. ==Personal life== Holland was born with a defect in his right leg which he had corrected in seventh grade. They had to break his leg and fuse his growth plates together on both legs which stunted his growth which made it so he could not grow anymore. On June 24, 2008, he was presented by Mayor Bob Avery with the key to his hometown Jefferson, Texas, for his generous contributions over the years to the community, including his support of the Marion County Youth Football league. ==References== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:People from Jefferson, Texas Category:American football offensive guards Category:Florida State Seminoles football players Category:New Orleans Saints players Category:Denver Broncos players Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:Players of American football from Texas ",
