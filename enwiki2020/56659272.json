It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The bridge is a double-intersection Warren truss, a design noted for its extremely lightweight members and low cost. It is the only known example of its type in Michigan. ==History== The exact history of this bridge is unknown, but it was likely constructed around 1910 by the township. The bridge is closed to traffic. ==Description== The Powers Highway Bridge is a rigid-connected lattice pony truss bridge. It has a 25-foot span and a 15.8 foot-wide roadway on a 16.3-foot wide deck.
