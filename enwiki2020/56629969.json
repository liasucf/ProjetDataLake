She switched studies and graduated in applied mathematics. Smeets was working on her thesis in mathematics, on a subject within number theory, at Leiden University when she started the blog Wiskundemeisjes ('Math girls'), on 14 March 2006, together with Jeanine Daems. The website has been awarded in 2007 with two Dutch Bloggies.Ionica Smeets Nijgh & Van Ditmar Since 2010, the two 'math girls' ran a column in De Volkskrant for several years.

She completed her PhD at Leiden in 2010; her dissertation, On Continued Fraction Algorithms, was supervised by Robert Tijdeman and Cornelis Kraaikamp.Ionica Smeets: On continued fraction algorithms, diss. Univ Leiden 2010 After this, Smeets became a science journalist. She performs research, together with Bas Haring, on successful methods to explain science to the general audience. In this function, she appeared on Dutch television, such as in De Wereld Draait Door. On 19 October 2011, the book Ik was altijd heel slecht in wiskunde (I have always been bad in mathematics) appeared, which she wrote together with Jeanine Daems. Begin 2012, Smeets co-presented eight editions of the KRO-program De Rekenkamer, replacing Sofie van den Enk.Ionica Smeets De Rekenkamer In 2013, Smeets presented the mathematics program Eureka, together with Van den Enk.Eureka On 17 August 2014 she was guest in the Dutch television program Zomergasten.
