K-204's western terminus is at U.S. Route 36 (US-36) west of the City of Smith Center and the eastern terminus is at US-281 in the City of Smith Center. The route was first designated a state highway on August 13, 1958. ==Route description== K-204 begins at an intersection with US-56 west of Smith Center. It starts traveling east for roughly and reaches an intersection with O Road. At this point it turns slightly northeast and begins to parallel the MSPA/KYLE Railroad. The next roughly it slowly curves north, entering Smith Center along the way. Shortly after entering Smith Center it curves back to the east again. It continues east another roughly and reaches US-281. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2018, they determined that on average the traffic was 475 vehicles near the western terminus. K-204 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-204 does connect to the National Highway System at its western terminus at US-56 and at its eastern terminus at US-160. The entire route is paved with partial design bituminous pavement. ==History== ===Early roads=== Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. The western terminus of K-204 (US-36) was part of the Pikes Peak Ocean to Ocean Highway. The eastern terminus (US-281) was part of the Sunflower Trail. ===Establishment and realignments=== K-204 was first designated a state highway on August 13, 1958, as a spur from US-56 to Smith Center. It followed an old alignment of US-56 that had been decommissioned on October 10, 1951. K-204 was extended furthur east to end at US-281 by 1968. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *Kansas Department of Transportation State Map *KDOT: Historic State Maps 204 Category:Transportation in Smith County, Kansas Category:U.S. Route 56 ",
