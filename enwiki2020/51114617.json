Brittany Kay Sundberg of Corvallis Arts Review said, \"Her toes point out while her face holds an expression of concentration as she balances on one hand.\" ==Reception== Sundberg wrote that the artist \"captured her grace and strength in the subtle muscle tones and impeccable lines created with her body in this impressive pose... Stephenson expertly portrays the dedication she must have had to be a three-time national champion, among the other records listed on the plaque for this sculpture. Her time and dedication led to her success and this statue captures her hard work and concentration.\" ==See also== * 1993 in art * Oregon State Beavers gymnastics ==References== Category:1993 establishments in Oregon Category:1993 sculptures Category:Bronze sculptures in Oregon Category:Gymnastics in Oregon Category:Monuments and memorials in Corvallis, Oregon Category:Oregon State University campus Category:Outdoor sculptures in Corvallis, Oregon Category:Sculptures of women in Oregon Category:Statues in Oregon ",
