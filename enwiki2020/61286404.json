    "text": "The men's 10 metre synchronized platform diving competition at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo will be held in 2021 at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre. It will be the 6th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Olympic Games since the 2000 Summer Olympics. == Competition format == The competition will be held in a single round, consisting of each pair performing six dives. The dives must be from 5 different groups (forward, back, reverse, inward, twisting, and armstand). The first two dives are given a fixed degree of difficulty of 2.0, regardless of the dive performed. The other four dives are assigned a degree of difficulty based on somersaults, position, twists, approach, and entry. There is no limit to the degree of difficulty of dives; the most difficult dives calculated in the FINA rulebook (reverse 4 somersault in pike position and armstand reverse 4 somersault in pike position) are 4.8, but competitors could attempt more difficult dives. Scoring is done by a panel of eleven judges, with five judges evaluating synchronization and three judges evaluating execution of each individual diver. For each dive, each judge gives a score between 0 and 10 with 0.5 point increments. The top and bottom synchronization scores and the top and bottom execution scores for each diver are discarded. The remaining five scores are summed, multiplied by , and multiplied by the degree of difficulty to give a dive score. The six dive scores are summed to give the score for the round. == Schedule == All times are Japan standard time (UTC+9) {| class=\"wikitable\" !Date !Time !Round |- |TBC |15:00 |Final |} == Qualification == The top 3 teams at the 2019 World Aquatics Championships earned a quota spot for their NOC.
