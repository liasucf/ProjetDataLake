    "text": "The 2015 Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council election took place on 7 May 2015 to elect members of Calderdale in England. This was on the same day as other local elections and a general election. One councillor was elected in each ward for a four-year term so the councillors elected in 2015 last stood for election in 2011. Each ward is represented by three councillors, the election of which is staggered, so only one third of the councillors were elected in this election. Before the election there was no overall control with a minority Labour administration which was over-ruled at a Budget vote by a coalition of Conservatives & Liberal Democrats leading to a Conservative minority administration. After the election there was still no overall control & a Labour minority administration was formed again.New leader of Calderdale Council. Halifax Courier. Retrieved 18 August 2017.
