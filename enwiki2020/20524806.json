Johnson is constantly exasperated at Jones\u2019 deficient perspicacity, and at one point he comments Jones is so dense that he probably thinks \"Veronica Lake is some kind of summer resort.\" The duo arrange to become boarders at the home of Louella \"Mama Lou\" Holiday, who is fooled into believing Johnson is an acting teacher named Whitney Vanderbilt; Jones takes the alias of Cornbread Green. Mrs. Holiday agrees to give the men free room and board if they will provide poise lessons to her daughter, an aspiring beauty queen named Honey Dew. The lessons pay off and Honey Dew wins the beauty contest, but problems arise when Mrs. Holiday\u2019s husband, Papa Sam, decides to hold a party for the new beauty queen at a disreputable juke joint.\u201cOverview for Juke Joint,\u201d Turner Classic Movies ==Production history== Juke Joint was the last in a series of films directed by Spencer Williams, an African American actor and writer, for production by Sack Amusement Enterprises, a white-owned Dallas- based company that distributed all-black race films to segregated theaters across the United States.
