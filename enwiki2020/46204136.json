After the previous season's multi-stage competition, the Campeonato Profesional returned to a single-stage format, with everyone playing each other 4 times over the season. The tournament began in May, a month after the end of the previous season. Independiente Santa Fe won the league for 2nd time in its history after getting 48 points (Santa Fe was the champion of the first Campeonato Profesional in 1948), while defending champions Independiente Medell\u00edn did not compete. ==Background== 10 teams competed in the tournament, down from the previous season's 12, with Uni\u00f3n Magdalena withdrawing because economic problems, while Boca Juniors de Cali refusing to participate in any further Dimayor tournaments. To balance their removal, Atl\u00e9tico Manizales rejoined the competition (its last tournament being 1954). Atl\u00e9tico Nacional and Independiente Medell\u00edn mixed their teams competing under the name of Atl\u00e9tico Nacional, but known popularly as Independiente Nacional. ==League system== Every team played four games against each other team, two at home and two away. Teams received two points for a win and one point for a draw. If two or more teams were tied on points, places were determined by goal difference. The team with the most points is the champion of the league. ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font- size:100%\" ! Team ! City !
