Brislington is also near to the site of the now demolished chapel of St. Anne's-in-the Wood (actually in nearby St Anne's), erected by one of the Lords de la Warr, whose family held the manor of Brislington from the late 12th to the mid-16th century; in the 15th century the chapel was a place of pilgrimage, visited by Henry VII). After the chapel was demolished following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Thomas Amory built a house called \"St. Ann's\" at the site in the mid-17th century.Gertrude Euphemia Meredith, The descendants of Hugh Amory: 1605\u20131805, 1901p. 14. During the 18th and 19th century, Brislington contained many country homes due to its reputation as a picturesque country village. It was also a notable centre of the making of brightly coloured English delftware pottery. Brislington House (now known as Long Fox Manor) was built as a private lunatic asylum for the insane. When it opened in 1806 it was one of England's first purpose built asylums. The Palladian fronted building was originally seven separate blocks into which patients were allocated depending on their class. The buildings, estate and therapeutic regime designed by Edward Long Fox was based on the principles of moral treatment which was fashionable at the time. Brislington House later influenced the design and construction of other asylums and influenced Act of parliament. The house and ancillary structures are listed buildings which have now been converted into private residences. The original grounds are Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England and now include St. Brendan's Sixth Form College, sports pitches and some farmland. They are now included on the Heritage at Risk Register. In 1866 Brislington became a civil parish.
