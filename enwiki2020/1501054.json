In a 2012 study, Guerra concluded that Drive-By and Party Girl, among a number of other titles, were likely to \"engage\" reluctant readers among youth at risk for incarceration. Lehtonen discusses Goddess of the Night (2000), the first volume of the Daughters of the Moon series, in a study of young adult fiction. Lehtonen observes that Goddess of the Night uses the magical power of invisibility as a means to explore the \"empowerment\" of Vanessa Cleveland, the novel's main character.
