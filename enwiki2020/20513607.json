It includes over five hundred works by artists of international renown and is now considered to be one of the largest and most significant collections of contemporary art by women in the world. Paintings, prints, and sculpture are displayed throughout Murray Edwards College in Cambridge. The College has no designated gallery and the works are displayed throughout its buildings and grounds. The modernist College buildings were completed in 1965 by Chamberlain, Powell and Bon and are Grade II* listed. The Collection has come about as the result of many gifts and loans from artists and donors. The Collection started in 1986 with the purchase of Mary Kelly's \"Extase\" (thanks to the generous support of the Eastern Arts Association and the artist herself) following her stay as artist in residence. This spurred the hope that the College might develop a permanent collection of 20th-century art by women, to inspire the female students who would live among it. In 1992, Dr Valerie Pearl (President 1981-1995) wrote to 100 of the leading women artists in Britain and received some 75 donations in return.\"What's the point of a museum of art by women?\" The Guardian (London). 28 July 2008. Retrieved 15 September 2013. The collection continues to acquire works by gifts and loans from artists and alumnae. It is the largest collection of art by women in Europe and about 95 per cent of it is displayed. On 7 March 2018, the New Hall Art Collection received accreditation from the Arts Council England which recognises the quality of the Collection and the professionalism with which it is managed. Many of the works are on display to visitors and a self-guided tour is available from the Porters' Lodge. ==Collection== Barbara Hepworth's Ascending Form (Gloria) at Murray Edwards College The collection includes works by: *Sandra Blow *Judy Chicago *Tracey Emin *Mary Fedden *Oona Grimes *Maggi Hambling *Lubaina Himid *Susie Hamilton *Barbara Hepworth *Nicola Hicks *Vanessa Jackson *Lucy Jones *Zelda Nolte *Cornelia Parker *Emily Patrick *Gwen Raverat *Paula Rego *Julia Sorrell *Wendy Taylor ==Controversy== Gulf Women Prepare for War (far left) and other paintings hung over the High Table In 2005, Maggi Hambling's painting Gulf Women Prepare for War was covered on request of a US Navy officer as a condition of a private booking for the US military.
