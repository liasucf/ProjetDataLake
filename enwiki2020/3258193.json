Kingsbury's contract included a base salary of $10.5 million over 5 years, and creative control over the team's uniforms. At 33, Kingsbury was the second-youngest head coach of a team in an AQ conference, and the third- youngest head coach in college football. Only Matt Campbell of Iowa State and P. J. Fleck of Minnesota were younger. ====2013 season==== Kingsbury made his head coaching debut August 30, 2013 with a 41\u201323 victory over the SMU Mustangs. Kingsbury chose walk-on true freshman quarterback Baker Mayfield for the starting role at the position, and Mayfield was named Big 12 Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. Mayfield is believed to be the first walk-on true freshman to start a season opener for a BCS school. Mayfield was later supplanted by Davis Webb, another true freshman quarterback, due to a knee injury during the Kansas game. Following Webb's first start against Iowa State, Webb was also named Big 12 Offensive Player of the Week. Texas Tech became the only school in the Big 12 Conference to have had three different freshman quarterbacks win the award, with the first being Kingsbury himself in 1999. The Red Raiders made their Associated Press Top 25 debut in the Kingsbury era following a win over TCU on September 12, 2013.

Kingsbury also became the first coach in Texas Tech history to start the season 6-0 in their debut season after the Red Raiders defeated Iowa State on October 12, 2013. Following a victory against West Virginia on October 19, 2013, Kingsbury led the Red Raiders to a 7\u20130 start for only the fourth time in program history. The 10th-place ranking the team received in the BCS also marked the highest the program had been ranked since the 2008 season. With the win over West Virginia, Kingsbury became the first Big 12 coach to start his career 7\u20130. The Texas Tech Red Raiders finished Kliff Kingsbury's first year at Texas Tech by losing the last 5 games of the season, finishing the rookie coach's first regular season at 7\u20135. Tight end Jace Amaro was also named as a Consensus All-American, the first Red Raider to be selected as such since Michael Crabtree in 2008. Kingsbury and the Red Raiders capped off the season with a 37\u201323 upset over the #14 ranked Arizona State in the 2013 Holiday Bowl following an impressive performance by quarterback Davis Webb. Two of Kingsbury's players would be selected in the 2014 NFL Draft, Amaro and Will Smith. Following the season, Baker Mayfield transferred to Oklahoma. He eventually won the 2017 Heisman trophy and was selected 1st overall in the 2018 NFL Draft. ====2014 season==== On August 29, 2014, Kingsbury received a $1 million raise to $3.5 million and a contract extension through 2020. The extension specified that Kingsbury's salary would increase by $200,000 a year to a maximum of $5.5 million in 2020. The extension was given following an announcement for a $185 million athletic fundraising campaign. Under Kingsbury's leadership Texas Tech sold out 2014 season tickets for the first time since Texas Tech's inaugural 1925 season. The 2014 team struggled with numerous injuries, finishing 4\u20138 on the season. ====2015 season==== The Red Raiders made numerous changes heading into the 2015 season. Kingsbury added defensive coordinator David Gibbs hoping to bolster a defense that ranked amongst the worst in the country. The Red Raiders rebounded with a strong season as running back DeAndr\u00e9 Washington finished with 1,492 yards and 16 touchdowns and Patrick Mahomes finished with 4,653 yards and 36 passing touchdowns. Although the offense rebounded quite nicely and finished the season in the top 3 nationally, the defense finished 2nd to last only better than Kansas. Kingsbury finished his 3rd season with signature wins at Arkansas and at Texas showing promise heading into 2016. The 2015 season concluded at 7\u20136, 4\u20135 in Big 12 play good for a 5th-place finish. Tech lost in the Texas Bowl to LSU. Three of Kingsbury's players were selected in the 2016 NFL Draft, Le'Raven Clark, DeAndr\u00e9 Washington, and Jakeem Grant. ====2016 season==== The Red Raiders finished 5\u20137, 3\u20136 in Big 12 play. The team disappointed with conference wins against Kansas, TCU, and Baylor and finished in 8th place in the Big 12. The Red Raiders finished the 2016 season with a 55\u201334 victory over Baylor. This victory snapped a 5-game losing streak against the Bears that went back to Kingsbury's days in Lubbock, before he was the Red Raider's head coach. The 2016 team finished with the 6th best offense and the worst defense in Division I FBS. Patrick Mahomes was the lone Red Raider drafted after a disappointing campaign going in the first round #10 overall to the Kansas City Chiefs. ====2017 season==== The Red Raiders entered a make or break season in 2017 for Kingsbury. The team responded positively finishing the 2017 season improved from the prior season finishing 6\u20137, 3\u20136 in Big 12 play. The team showed signs of improvement as the offense finishing #16 in the country overcoming the loss of first round pick Patrick Mahomes. The defense also showed signs of improvement jumping up to joint #58 overall, a vast improvement for a defense that was the worst in the NCAA the prior season. At the conclusion of the season Athletic Director Kirby Hocutt confirmed that Kingsbury would be returning for his 6th season as the Red Raiders coach. ====2018 season==== The 2018 season started quickly with the Red Raiders defeating Houston and Oklahoma State on their way to a 5\u20132 record. Texas Tech then dropped its final five games of the season to finish at 5\u20137. Three straight losing seasons overall and six straight losing seasons in the Big 12 ultimately sealed the fate for Kingsbury. Athletic director Kirby Hocutt announced on November 25 that Kingsbury would not be retained for the 2019 season. He left with an overall record of 35\u201340 (including 13 victories over lower tier Group of Five and FCS competition) and 19\u201335 in Big 12 play. ===Coaching highlights=== Since Kingsbury became an offensive coordinator in 2011, his offenses have averaged 550 yards and nearly 42 points per game. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
