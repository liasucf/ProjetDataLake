    "text": "Bagai was a Roman-Berber city in the province of Africa Proconsularis. It must have been of some reasonable size, as it was also the seat of an ancient Catholic bishopric. The ancient city has been identified with ruins at Ksar- Baga\u00ef outside of Baghai, in the Aur\u00e8s Mountains of the El Hamma District in Khenchela Province, Algeria. ==Location== Landscape around Bagai Bagai is a town in Numidia between the Aur\u00e8s Mountains in the south and the salt lake Garaat al-Tarf in the north.Huss, Werner (Bamberg), \" Bagai\", in: Brill's New Pauly, Edited by: Hubert Cancik, Helmuth Schneider (antique), Manfred Landfester (history of recollection and science). Consulted online on 23 January 2017. Baga\u00ef is identified with Ksar Baghai in modern-day central Algeria, not far from Thamugadi (Timgad).Vetusta Sapientia, The Election of Primian of Carthage - The Beginning of the End of Donatist Christianity, p7. 6 kilometers to the south of Bagai is Hammam Essalihine the ruins of an ancient Roman bath that dates from the time of the Flavian dynasty. The town of Aquae Flavianae was also near these ruins. ==History== In the 2nd century, the city possessed monuments and dedications to the emperor Verus and to the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Around 384, Donatist schism caused a conflict in the region. Emperor Constant I sent emissaries to reconcile the two religious parties, but the dissent lead to open revolt. The massacre of Bagai resulted. The Council of Baga\u00ef took place on 24 April 394 to discuss the Donatist question.Vetusta Sapientia, The Election of Primian of Carthage - The Beginning of the End of Donatist Christianity, p7. The city was a stronghold of Donatism and in 411, a Donatist bishop was sent from Bagai to the Council of Carthage. The city was the most important capital in the conflict between Donatists and Catholics during the Late Empire. In the election of Primianus of Carthage, the region burst into flames again. The Berbers destroy the city and ransack the library. In the 5th century, Baghai was invaded by the Vandals, driven afterwards by the Berbers. In 538, Gontharis, an officer of Byzantine general Salomon who reconquered the ancient Roman Africa settles his camp near the deserted city, but was defeated by the Berbers who regained control of the city, and strengthened it by surrounding it with an enclosure. It is the starting point of his second campaign in the Aures. In the Middle Ages,Ibn Khaldoun, Histoire des Berb\u00e8res, \u00e9dition Berti, Alger,2003 the Umayyads attacked the city, the Kahina rebelled against Hassan ibn Numan (governor of the Maghreb) in 698. The Berber queen destroyed the city and left nothing to the Umayyads. Subsequently, the Fatimids took the city in 903.Recueil des notices et m\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 arch\u00e9lologique de la province de Constantine.

Subsequently, the Hilalians destroyed the whole city. Al Idrissi mentions that there was a double wall in the city in his writings before it was destroyed. ==Etymology== The city was called by Augustine Vaga\u00efa.

Bagai was the home of Donatus of Bagai fl 347Augustine. letter, Parmeniani 3. 4. 21, cresconium grammaticum 3f and Marculus of Bagai fl 347.Richard M. Hogan, Dissent from the Creed: Heresies Past and Present (Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2001) p109.Brent D. Shaw, Sacred Violence: African Christians and Sectarian Hatred in the Age of Augustine (Cambridge University Press, 2011) Augustine wrote of many leading citizens of Bagai.Augustine. letter, Parmeniani 3. 4. 21, cresconium grammaticum 3f In 340 Bagai was the site of a massacre by imperial legate Macarius which forever fractured the possibility of conciliation between Donatist and Catholic factions and made the schism increasingly violent. In 401, divisions were still so strong in Bagai that when the Donatist bishop Maximian of Bagai converted to Catholicism he was twice nearly murdered, such that Augustine once said of him \"He has more scars than limbs\". The Donatist Council of Bagai was held with 310 bishops in 394 AD. The Council of Bagai condemned Maximianist and supported Primian of Carthage as Primate of Africa.Augustine, Contra Cresconium IV.4.5.Jesse Hoover, The Contours of Donatism: Theological and Ideological Diversity in Fourth Century North Africa.
