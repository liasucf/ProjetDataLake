Competing compact cameras which are capable of shooting in Raw mode include Canon PowerShot G12, Fujifilm X10, Nikon Coolpix P7100, Samsung TL500/EX1, and the previously mentioned Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5. A similar category to high-end compact cameras are mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras (\"MILC\"), some of which are in a compact form factor (with a similar-sized body), such as the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF2, Olympus PEN E-P1/E-P2, and Sony Alpha NEX-3/5. MILCs differ however in being significantly larger (with lens attached), and significantly higher-end, featuring much larger sensors and interchangeable lenses. The follow-up modell XZ-2 appeared in 2012 and features the same lens, while adding an improved sensor, tilting touch-screen and a two-mode control dial around the lens.https://www.cameralabs.com/olympus_xz-2/ ==References== * at Olympus America ==External links== * XZ-1 Product Page has information regarding the camera.
