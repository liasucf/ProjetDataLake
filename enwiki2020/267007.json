    "text": "Adam of Saint Victor (; died 1146)Adam of St. Peter, Sequences, Peeters Publishers was a prolific poet and composer of Latin hymns and sequences. He has been called \"...the most illustrious exponent of the revival of liturgical poetry which the twelfth century affords.\" ==Life== Adam of Saint Victor was born in the latter part of the eleventh century, probably at Paris, where he was educated. The first reference to him dates from 1098, in the archives of Notre Dame Cathedral, where he held office first as a subdeacon and later as a precentor. He left the cathedral for the Abbey of Saint Victor around 1133, probably because of his attempts at imposing the Rule of St Augustine at the cathedral. Adam likely had contact with a number of important theologians, poets, and musicians of his day, including Peter Abelard and Hugh of St Victor, and he may have taught Albertus Parisiensis. According to John Julian, \"His principal merits may be described as comprising terseness and felicity of expression; deep and accurate knowledge of Scripture, especially its typology; smoothness of versification; richness of rhyme, accumulating gradually as he nears the conclusion of a Sequence; and a spirit of devotion breathing throughout his work, that assures the reader that his work is \"a labour of love.\"Julian, John. \"Adam of St. Victor\", Dictionary of Hymnology, 1907 He lived in the abbey, which was somewhat of a theological center, then in the suburbs of Paris but included in it subsequently through the city's growth.A'Becket, John Joseph. \"Adam of St. Victor.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 15 January 2020 He died there some time between 1172 and 1192. Anglican Archbishop Richard Chenevix Trench characterized Adam of Saint Victor as \"the foremost among the sacred Latin poets of the Middle Ages\" In Mont Saint Michel and Chartres, Henry Adams wrote that Adam \"aimed at obtaining his effect from the skillful use of the Latin sonorities for purposes of the chant.\" ==Works== Adam of St Victor's surviving works are sequences for liturgical use, not theological treatises.These texts were gradually rediscovered in the nineteenth century.The critical edition of these texts is Jean Grosfillier, ed, Les sequences d'Adam de Saint-Victor: \u00c9tude litt\u00e9raire (po\u00e9tique et rh\u00e9torique). Textes et traductions, commentaires, Bibliotheca Victorina 20, (Turnhout: Brepols, 2008), pp252-481. They are now fully translated in Adam of Saint-Victor, Sequences. Introduction, Text, Translation, and Notes by Juliet Mousseau, Dallas Medieval Texts, (Leuven: Peeters, 2011). In addition, Hugh Feiss, On Love, (2010), p71, argues that three additional Marian sequences seem likely to be by Adam of St Victor. The Latin text is in Bernadette Joll\u00e8s, ed, Quatorze proses du XIIe si\u00e8cle \u00e0 louange de Marie, (Turnhout: Brepols, 1994). Jodocus Clichtovaeus, a Catholic theologian of the 16th century, published thirty-seven of his hymns in the Elucidatorium Ecclesiasticum (1516). The remaining seventy hymns were preserved in the Abbey of Saint Victor until its dissolution during the French Revolution. They were then transferred to the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, where they were discovered by L\u00e9on Gautier, who edited the first complete edition of them (Paris, 1858). Around 47 sequences by Adam survive. In a practice that developed from the ninth century onwards, these are poems composed to be sung during the mass, between the Alleluia and the gospel reading. The sequence therefore bridges the Old Testament or epistle readings and the gospel, both literarily and musically.
