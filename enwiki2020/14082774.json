It is located in the present- day city of Hiratsuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. ==History== Hiratsuka-juku was first established in 1601, at the orders of Tokugawa Ieyasu.11 Hiratsuka- juku. Hiratsuka City Museum. Accessed November 5, 2007. In 1651, though, it merged with part of the nearby village of Yawata. In 1655, it was renamed \"Shinhiratsuka-juku.\" During a census in 1843, the post station was found to have a population of 2,114 people and 443 houses, which included one honjin, 1 sub-honjin and 54 hatago. The classic ukiyo-e print by And\u014d Hiroshige (H\u014deid\u014d edition) from 1831\u20131834 does not depicts the post station at all, but instead shows a zig-zag road above marshy fields, with Mount Fuji appearing behind Shonan Daira in the background. One of the travelers is a professional courier running as part of the mail service offered along the T\u014dkaid\u014d. Relays of runners could convey a message from Edo to Kyoto in 90 hours. ==Neighboring post towns== ;T\u014dkaid\u014d :Fujisawa-shuku - Hiratsuka-juku - \u014ciso-juku ==References== ==Further reading== *Carey, Patrick.
