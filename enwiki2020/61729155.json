In 1916 he was commissioned in the Royal Army Medical Corps and was appointed Captain and posted to Mesopotamia, where he developed expertise in the control of typhus fever After demobilisation, he returned in 1919 to general practice in Huddersfield. Mackenzie left his practice in 1920 to seek further training, receiving a doctorate from the University of London with a thesis titled:The Prevention of Typhus and relapsing fever in Mesopotamia during the War. He obtained Diplomas in Tropical Medicine at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and iPublic Health at Durham University.

He was recruited by Ruth Fry, director of the Russian Famine Relief Fund, sponsored by the Quakers. Working in the Buzuluk region of Russia, he organised feeding centres for distribution of supplies donated to the fund. He introduced measures for the control of infectious diseases, particularly typhus and malaria, and he introduced the practice of combining relief with the reconstruction of health services. Mackenzie returned to England as an invalid in 1923 suffering from simultaneous infections with Malaria and Typhus fever. After convalescence he visited Germany in 1924 with a paediatrician Helen Mackay, to investigate the health of German schoolchildren. In 1925 he moved to the British Ministry of Health as medical officer. ==International career== Mackenzie's career in international health started in 1928 when he was invited to join the health section of the League of Nations, under the direction of Ludwik Rajchman. In the same year he went to Greece to advise on the control of a severe epidemic of Dengue fever and returned the following year as Secretary of an International Commission to advise the Greek government to plan Hellenic health services. Later he also advised the government of Bulgaria on the control of endemic syphilis and the Czech and Romanian governments on the establishment of health centres. In 1930 he visited Spain to advise the government on Health Service Organization.Letters in Wellcome Library Archive PP/MDM In April 1930, Mackenzie travelled to Bolivia with a Spanish epidemiologist, Marcelino Pascua, to develop plans to re-organise health services. Mackenzie and Pascua carried out, over three months, a comprehensive survey of economic, social and health issues, including malaria and other tropical diseases in the Jungle, and tuberculosis together with other diseases on the Andean plateau.Wellcome archive Mackenzie travelled to Liberia in 1931 with M. Brunot to investigate the prevalence and incidence of Infectious diseases. At the time Liberia was faced with many political problems, including a discontented repressed rural population and hostility between tribes over land and fishing rights. The following year he was designated by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Sir Eric Drummond, to return to Liberia to mediate in some of the areas of contention. He intervened in local conflicts to establish boundaries and fishing rights, and mediated between the rural population and the government. He also attempted, with partial success, to disarm the population. On a return visit in 1933 he was disappointed in the lack of follow up on his actions. In 1934 Mackenzie reported and made recommendations on the health and hospital services in Ireland. In 1936 he was appointed director of the League of Nations epidemiological bureau in Singapore where he remained for one year. During the 2nd Sino-Japanese war Mackenzie flew to China in 1939 as special commissioner of the Secretary General of the League of Nations to co-ordinate technical cooperation and was present at the bombing of Chongqingc This experience of bombing raids and public health problems associated with air raid shelters was relevant in Mackenzie\u2019a later wartime appointment as principal Medical Officer for London.
