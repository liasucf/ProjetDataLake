By the 2010s there were fewer clergy teachers, and lay teachers were more expensive; in addition fewer parishioners gave money to the church. By 2016 the school's budget was $111,709 in deficit. In 2008-2009 it had a peak enrollment of 219. In 2014 there was concern expressed about the school's survival expressed in the community, and in 2016 enrollment was down to 139, with 22 being in special education. The school directors chose to close the school in June 2016; the archdiocese did not order the closure. St. Anthony School in Bristol closed in 2016. St. Vincent de Paul School in East Haven closed in 2016. That year enrollment was 89. ==References== Hartford, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Category:Education in Hartford, Connecticut *Schools Schools in the Roman Catholic Archdoicese of Hartford ",
