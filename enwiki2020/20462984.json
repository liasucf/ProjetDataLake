A large destroyer with long range, capable of providing escort to the new battleship and the two s were considered a part of this reduced spending naval program from the previous Eight-eight fleet project.. Although funding was authorized for only one destroyer, Tanikaze, the Italian government unexpectedly refunded Japan for its down payment of 870,000 Yen on the , which had been transferred to the Royal Italian Navy before completion in England during World War I. These funds were used to complete a second vessel, which was also named Kawakaze.Howarth, The Fighting Ships of the Rising Sun ==Design== Initially conceived of as a follow-on version of the earlier s, however, it was the first to use the new Type 3 120 mm 45 caliber naval guns that were to be used many subsequent classes of Japanese destroyers. In addition, given the experience with deployment of Japanese destroyers for extended periods overseas in World War I, the hull and bow needed to be reinforced to handle heavy seas. Furthermore, the navy wanted to add the latest technologies in terms of the new 533 mm torpedoes in three double launchers. It was furthermore decided to use the same Brown-Curtis heavy fuel oil fired geared steam turbine engines as on the Tenry\u016b-class cruisers. The result was a ship was much more powerful that the earlier Isokaze class, and capable of high speed operation. ==Operational history== The Kawakaze-class destroyers served during the interwar period. Kawakaze was retired on 1 April 1934 and Tanikaze a year later.Nishida, Imperial Japanese Navy ==List of ships== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\" |- ! Kanji ! Name ! Builder !
