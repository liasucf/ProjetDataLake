The segment is so popular it has evolved into major show competitions including Tradie-oke Night; Live from the World Famous Rooftop and Tradie-okyo; Tradies Live from Tokyo. === Alphabucks === Every morning at 8am listeners have the opportunity to win $10,000 by correctly answering 10 questions all starting with a nominated letter of the alphabet. === PC Police === Political correctness is something that affects all aspects of life. Fifi, Fev & Byron like to point out when PC has perhaps gone too far. === We Got One === Fifi, Fev & Byron ask a question that they don't expect anyone to be able to answer so they hope at least one person calls through. E.g. Are you currently in labour? Have you died? === Ya Busted === When people have been caught out doing something they shouldn't have been doing. == Pranks == In March 2018, British singer Calum Scott disguised himself as a tradie 'Scott from Scoresby' and performed his hit song Dancing on my Own in front of Fifi, Fev & Byron. Fifi and Byron were aware it was Calum but Fev was completely left in the dark. At the end of the performance Fev was in complete shock of how talented the tradie was only to discover it was Calum Scott himself. In November 2018, Brendan Fevola's fourth daughter was born. Fifi, Byron and guest host Matt Preston crossed to Fev live on radio just after the birth where Fev revealed the baby had been named Brenda. Fifi's reaction was priceless as the thought that Brendan had named his daughter Brenda seemed ridiculous. 24 hours later Fev finally revealed his baby's name was actually Tobi. ==References== ==External links== * Fifi, Fev & Byron Category:Australian radio programs Category:2010s Australian radio programs Category:2020s Australian radio programs ",
