    "text": "On the Prowl is the first extended play by the Australian rock band, Operator Please, which was issued in 2006. It was recorded and produced by the band's drummer, Roulf Commandeur, at his father's home studio, Musical Solutions, in the Gold Coast, Queensland. It was limited to a release of about 300 handmade copies. It is currently out of print. AllMusic's Jody Macgregor described the group's early effort \"To help them secure more gigs they recorded the [EP] at a studio belonging to Commandeur's father, selling copies via MySpace and a post office box.\" \"Just a Song About Ping Pong\" was later remixed for their third EP, which was released in July 2007, and peaked at No. 12 on the ARIA Singles Chart. \"Terminal Disease\" was also remixed and included on Yes Yes Vindictive. \"Catalogue Kids\" is the B-side of their \"Two for My Seconds\" single. \"One Yellow Button\" was also remixed and included on Yes Yes Vindictive as a bonus iTunes download track. == Background == On the Prowl is Operator Please's debut recording with the line-up of Tim Commandeur on drums, Sarah-Jane Gardiner on keyboards, Taylor Henderson on violin, Ashley McConnell on bass guitar and Amandah Wilkinson on lead vocals. According to The Guardians Leonie Cooper the group started with a do-it-yourself ethic, \"the band members and their accompanying instruments crammed into Commandeur's father's tiny home recording studio, which was normally used for taping backing tracks for commercials. Six hours later their debut EP, On the Prowl, was completed.\" Commandeur recorded and produced the EP and \"CDs were burned from the computer and Wilkinson's sister, a graphic design student, put together the artwork, which was printed on the new family inkjet printer.\" They sold the limited pressing of about 500 copies at their gigs and local record shops. ==Track listing== #\"Just a Song About Ping Pong\" (On the Prowl version) \u2013 2:26 #\"Paperclips\" \u2013 2:39 #\"Catalogue Kids\" \u2013 3:24 #\"Teapot\" \u2013 2:46^ #\"Terminal Disease\" \u2013 2:08 #\"One Yellow Button\" \u2013 3:40 :^ Internet bonus track. ==References== Category:2006 debut EPs Category:Operator Please albums ",
