Its GRAU designation is 4K32. It was sometimes referred to as P-1 or Strelka (Little Arrow). It was used in the 1950s and 1960s. The missile's NATO reporting name was SS-N-1 Scrubber. It was tested in 1953-1954 on the destroyer Bedovyy (Kildin-class) and entered service in 1955, being deployed on Kildin- and Krupnyy (later converted to Kanin)-class ships. It was fired from a heavy rail launcher SM-59, with an armoured hangar. As those ships were retrofitted and modernized between 1966 and 1977, the missiles were removed (in favor of the SS-N-2 on the Kildin class and an anti- aircraft/anti-submarine weapons suite on the Kanin class). ==Specifications== *Total length: 7.6 m (25 ft) *Diameter: 900 mm (3 ft) *Wingspan: 4.6 m (15 ft) *Weight: 3,100 kg (6830 lb) *Warhead: nuclear warhead or High Explosive *Propulsion: liquid-fuel rocket *Range: *Guidance: inertial guidance *Contractor: NPO Mashinostroenia *Entered service: 1955 == Operators == ; * The Soviet Navy employed the KSShch on Kildin and Kanin class ships.
