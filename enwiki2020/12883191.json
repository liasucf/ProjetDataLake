A catcher, DePastino made his Major League Baseball debut in 2003 for the New York Mets. After spending over 10 years in the minor leagues as a journeyman catcher, DePastino was called up to the Mets in early August 2003 due to injuries. He made his Major League debut on August 5, pinch-hitting and striking out against the Houston Astros. He only lasted one more at-bat the following day against Houston before being sent down. He retired in 2005. DePastino served as manager for the Detroit Tigers' Class A affiliate, West Michigan Whitecaps of the Midwest League, from 2008-2010.
