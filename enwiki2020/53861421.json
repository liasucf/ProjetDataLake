    "text": "Bertram Feldman (29 September 1874 - 25 March 1945) was a British music publisher whose innovations \"forged the foundations of a commercial music industry in Britain\". ==Biography== Feldman was born in Hull, the son of a piano maker and music shop owner. In 1895, he went to London and set up in business as a song plugger, the first in the country, buying new songs cheaply from their writers and then aggressively promoting their sheet music sales. Lucas Campbell, \"The Lost History of Feldman's Arcade...\", 15 July 2014. Retrieved 23 April 2017 His business expanded when he began acquiring the publishing rights to American songs, particularly after visiting New York City in 1907. The songs he purchased included \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\", \"Down at the Old Bull and Bush\", \"Teddy Bears' Picnic\", and (for 5 shillings) \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\", all of which became very popular in Britain. Feldman helped establish Irving Berlin's international reputation, by featuring his songs in his annual song books. Jeffrey Magee, Irving Berlin's American Musical Theater, Oxford University Press, 2012, p.4 Around 1909, Feldman established his own publishing company in what became known as Feldman's Arcade in Blackpool, later moving it to London. His business continued to expand until his death, his later successes including \"The White Cliffs of Dover\". Nick Boldock, \"People: Bertram Feldman\", Hull Music Archive, 17 April 2016. Retrieved 23 April 2017 He died in Blackpool in 1945. His business was sold after his death to the publishing firm of Francis Day & Hunter. ==References== Category:1874 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Music publishing companies of the United Kingdom Category:Businesspeople from Kingston upon Hull ",
