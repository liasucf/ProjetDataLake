The Origin of St. Michael's Lent comes from Franciscan tradition. Saint Francis of Assisi, in the last two years of his life, reportedly began the practice where he would lead monks in a period of fasting. ==See also== * Lent * Saint Martin's Lent ==References== Category:Christian fasting Category:Lent Category:Franciscan spirituality Category:August observances ",
