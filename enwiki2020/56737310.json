It is served by the S-Bahn line , Bayerische Oberlandbahn (BOB) and Meridian. ==Location== Holzkirchen station is a junction station where the Munich\u2013Holzkirchen railway, Mangfall Valley Railway (to Rosenheim), Holzkirchen\u2013Lenggries railway and Holzkirchen\u2013Schliersee railway join together. ==History== Holzkirchen station was opened on 31 October 1857 together with the section Gro\u00dfhesselohe- Rosenheim the Bavarian Maximilian Railway. The entire Maximilian Railway Ulm- Munich-Salzburg was completed on 1 August 1860. On 23 November 1861 a route to Miesbach was opened so that Holzkirchen became a railway junction. In 1862, the Munich\u2013Holzkirchen railway was double-tracked due to the increasing volume of traffic. In 1868 the Holzkirchen-Miesbach line was extended to Hausham and in 1869 to Schliersee. On 15 October 1871, the Munich\u2013Rosenheim railway (Munich-Grafing-Rosenheim) was opened, which made the previous detour of the Maximilian Railway over Holzkirchen unnecessary. Since most of the trains went via Grafing, the Bavarian Maximilian Railway and the Holzkirchen station lost their traffic. On 1 June 1874 another outgoing line from Holzkirchen route to Bad T\u00f6lz was opened. On 24 November 2009, there was a motor fire in an train of the Bayerische Oberlandbahn. ==Gallery== File:BOB und Meridian im Bahnhof Holzkirchen.jpg|Meridian (left) and Bayerische Oberlandbahn (BOB) (right) at track 5 and 4 in 2016 File:Holzkirchen Bahnhofsgeb\u00e4ude.jpg|Reception building in 2011 ==References== Category:Munich S-Bahn stations Category:Railway stations in Bavaria Category:Railway stations in Germany opened in 1857 Category:1857 establishments in Bavaria Category:Miesbach (district) ",
