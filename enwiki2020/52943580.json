    "text": "The Czech Social Democratic Party (\u010cSSD) leadership election of 2017 was held on 10 March 2017, prior October 2017 legislative elections. The current leader and Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Bohuslav Sobotka was the only candidate. ==Background== According to Hospod\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e9 Noviny Sobotka said that he would seek another term as the leader of \u010cSSD only if the party succeeded in the 2016 regional and Senate elections, defining success as the \u010cSSD remaining the strongest party at the regional level and in the Senate. The se words were late commented as misinterpreted. When the \u010cSSD was defeated in both sets of elections, speculation began that the Governor of South Bohemia Ji\u0159\u00ed Zimola would run against Sobotka due to his performance in the regional elections and his criticism of Sobotka, saying that Sobotka should reconsider his candidature for leadership. Zimola also stated that he thought Sobotka could remain Prime Minister until the 2017 elections even if the \u010cSSD was led by someone else. Zimola later said that he would not run for the party leadership as he did not want to divide the party. Sobotka was endorsed by 12 regional organisations of the party. South Bohemian organisation refused to support Sobotka's candidature. ==Result== Bohuskav Sobotka won 67% votes from 681 delegates and was reelected. Even though Sobotka was reelected the result was considered a proof of low support for his politics in the party even though he stated that he believes he has a strong mandate. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
