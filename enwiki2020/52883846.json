Since 2018, he has portrayed Chechen mobster NoHo Hank in the HBO series Barry, for which he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2019. He is also known for playing Tyler Davies in the television series The Forgotten (2009\u20132010), Victor Zsasz in the FOX series Gotham (2014\u20132019), and robot Dennis Caleb McCoy in Bill & Ted Face the Music (2020). ==Personal life== Since childhood, Carrigan has had alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss. He had mild symptoms growing up with only small, manageable bald spots, but he started losing more hair in his 20s and has spoken of wearing makeup and artificial eyebrows while filming The Forgotten. He is now known for his complete lack of hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes, and has incorporated this into his career, often being typecast as a television villain. Carrigan is married to professional chess player Gia Olimp, whom he met at the Broadway-Lafayette Street train station in New York City. ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
