    "text": ", two ballot measures have been certified for the November 3, 2020, general election in the state of Massachusetts. Multiple other ballot measures that were initiated by supporters did not meet requirements, thus will not appear on the ballot. The Constitution of Massachusetts can be amended through initiative, and state statutes can be proposed through initiative. In Massachusetts, after the Attorney General determines which measure(s) will appear on the ballot, an official name is assigned to each question. The Secretary of the Commonwealth has discretion over the ordering of questions on the ballot. == Measures on the ballot == As of April 2020, four measures (19-06, 19-10, 19-11, and 19-14) had achieved the required number of initial signatures and were pending in the Massachusetts General Court. The measures could be passed by the legislature before May 5, 2020, or if that failed to happen, petitioners were required collect an additional 13,347 signatures in support of each measure to be placed on the ballot. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of social distancing on in-person signature collection, a lawsuit to allow for electronic signatures in support of ballot initiatives was raised with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. In late April, a court judgement to allow for electronic signatures was agreed to by Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin and supporters of the four measures. In early July, supporters of two of the four measures (19-06 and 19-10) announced that they had submitted a sufficient number of signatures to qualify for the ballot. Galvin certified both measures to appear on the 2020 ballot. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Number !Initiative title !Description !Text !Website !Status |- |Question 1 |Initiative Law to Enhance, Update and Protect the 2013 Motor Vehicle Right to Repair Law * (includes video) |This proposed law would require that motor vehicle owners and independent repair facilities be provided with expanded access to mechanical data related to vehicle maintenance and repair. |Text |Link |style=\"background: green; color: white;\"|On the Ballot |- |Question 2 |Initiative Petition for a Law to Implement Ranked-Choice Voting in Elections |Enacts Ranked-choice voting for state and federal elections other than president. |Text |Link |style=\"background: green; color: white;\"|On the Ballot |} == Measures not on the ballot == Several measures were not certified to circulate because they went against Massachusetts law on ballot measures.
