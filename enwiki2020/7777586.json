As Gute's second best goal-scorer, he drew attention from Swedish top league clubs such as \u00d6rebro SK and AIK. On 3 November 2006, he signed a three-year contract with AIK. In 2007, he only made five appearances in the league, all without scoring. Struggling to make it into the starting 11, he was loaned out to the second tier club Sirius prior to the 2008 season. In Sirius, he made 14 appearances, scoring six goals. ===Gefle=== Although it was thought that he would stay the entire season on loan at Sirius, he signed for Gefle in the top flight division during the summer transfer window of 2008. His start in Gefle was not a success at all; he did not score any goals for the club during 2008. In the season of 2009, Gerndt played 26 out of 30 league games (14 as a starter), scoring 3 goals.\"Alexander Gerndt \u2014 svenskfotboll.se\" (in Swedish) In 2010, he made a major breakthrough in his career. Showing much improvement, he scored 8 goals in the first 14 games for Gefle. As a fact of that, it was rumored that he would make a transfer to the Dutch team Heerenveen in the summer transfer windows of 2010, but also that Helsingborg wanted his signature. ===Helsingborg=== On 18 July 2010, it was confirmed that he would move to Helsingborg, signing a 3.5 year contract. Helsingborg were during that time a club fighting to be the Swedish champions of 2010.
