The season started on 20 October 2019 and was originally scheduled to conclude on 21 April 2020, but was later changed to 15 October 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Egypt. Fixtures for the 2019\u201320 season were announced on 18 September 2019. National Bank of Egypt, Ceramica Cleopatra and Ghazl El Mahalla won Group A, Group B and Group C respectively and secured the promotion to the 2020\u201321 Egyptian Premier League; with the first two earning a place in the top flight for the first time in their history. On 14 March 2020, a decision was made by the Egyptian Football Association to postpone all football activities in Egypt due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The initial suspension, until 29 March, was then extended multiple times until at least mid-July. On 2 July 2020, the EFA announced that football competitions in Egypt would resume, with the Premier League recommencing on 6 August, Second Division on 21 September and Egypt Cup on 30 September. The EFA also confirmed that all clubs' players and staff would be tested for COVID-19 before resuming training. ==Teams== ===Team changes=== The following teams have changed division since the 2018\u201319 season. ====To Second Division==== Promoted from Third Division * Asyut Petroleum * Muslim Youths (Qena) * Maleyat Kafr El Zayat * National Bank of Egypt * Biyala * Dikernis Relegated from Premier League * Petrojet * El Dakhleya * Nogoom ====From Second Division==== Relegated to Third Division * Al Nasr Lel Taa'den * El Tahrir * MS Naser Malawy * Al Walideya * El Shams * Porto Suez * Damietta * Abou Sakal * Kafr El Sheikh * Al Jazeera * MS Tala * Sidi Salem Promoted to Premier League * Aswan * FC Masr * Tanta ===Stadiums and locations=== :Note: Table lists in alphabetical order. ====Group A==== 2 teams from Asyut, 2 teams from Beni Suef, 2 teams from Cairo, 2 teams from Sohag, 2 teams from Qena, 1 team from Faiyum and 1 team from El Minya. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:86% |- !
