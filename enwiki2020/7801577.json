The gate is open between 5 May and 25 October. Mount Nantai is one of the 100 famous mountains in Japan. == Volcanic activity == Relief Map In September 2008, the Japan Meteorological Agency was asked to reclassify Mount Nantai as \"active\" based upon work by Yasuo Ishizaki and colleagues of Toyama University showing evidence of an eruption approximately 7000 years ago. ==Mount Nantai as a sacred mountain== View of Mount Nantai from Futara Bridge Archeologists affirm that during the Yayoi period the most common (a yorishiro housing a kami) in the earliest Shinto shrines was a nearby mountain peak supplying with its streams water, and therefore life, to the plains below where people lived.Cambridge History of Japan (1993:524) Mount Nantai constitutes Futarasan Shrine's go-shintai, and the shrine is an important example of this ancient type of mountain cult. Significantly, the name itself means \"man's body\". The mountain not only provides water to the rice paddies below, but has the shape of the phallic stone rods found in pre- agricultural J\u014dmon sites. ==Notes== ==References== * Iwanami Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version * ==External links== * Nantai- Nyoho Volcano Group - Geological Survey of Japan * Nantai: Global Volcanism Program - Smithsonian Institution Category:Mountains of Tochigi Prefecture Category:Volcanoes of Honsh\u016b Category:Stratovolcanoes of Japan Category:Sacred mountains of Japan Category:Volcanoes of Tochigi Prefecture ",
