    "text": "The Flying Wedge Award is one of the NCAA\u2019s highest honors. It is awarded to an individual who exemplifies outstanding leadership and service to the NCAA. The flying wedge was used in the early days of American football and became a symbol of the origin of the NCAA in 1906. There is a life-size sculpture of the flying wedge in the NCAA Hall of Champions in Indianapolis and a reproduction is awarded as The Flying Wedge Award. Ironically, the flying wedge formation was outlawed in college football in 1894 because it was highly dangerous. The award is given by the NCAA Leadership Advisory Board of Directors and there have been ten recipients: *Richard Cheney, Vice President of the United States of America *Thomas Curley, president and chief executive officer, The Associated Press *Stevie Eller and Karl Eller, chairman and chief executive officer, The Eller Company *James T. Morris, executive director, United Nations World Food Program *Edwin A. Lupberger, president, Nesher Investments, LLC *Reverend Edward A.
