    "text": "Curly on the Rack is a 1958 Australian play by Ru Pullan set in Rabaul after World War II. Pullan was an experienced radio writer. The play came about from a discussion Pullan had with a friend about treasure left behind in the war. It was presented by the Elizabethan Theatre Trust at a time when production of Australian plays was rare. It was considered a disappointment after their successful productions of The Shifting Heart and Summer of the Seventeenth Doll. Nonetheless the play was adapted for Australian radio in 1960. ==Plot== After World War Two, two brothers, the tough Max and the gentler Harry, live in Rabaul with their sister Pet, salvaging war time equipment. Their truck driver, Curly, waits for his opportunity to recover \u00a310,000 he planted on a nearby island during the Japanese invasion along with a fellow soldier called Scobie. Scobie arrives, having lost both his legs during the war, demanding his half of the money. Smith, a philosophical drunk, comments on the action. ==Cast of Original Production== *Stewart Ginn as Scobie *John Gray as Smith *Coralie Neville as Pet Finton *Max Osbiston as Harry *Grant Taylor as Max Finton *Ken Wayne as Harry Finton *Owen Weingott as Tim, a ship's captain ==Reception== Reviewing the original production, The Bulletin said \"the dramatic cliches and tortuous contrivings that go with resolving the situations are rather less than bearable, and the scene wherein Scobie recovers his manhood and Max reveals his yellow streak must be one of the most preposterous bits of hoo-ha served to an audience for many a day.\" The Sydney Morning Herald said the play \"ran a wayward course through melodramatic shallows\" and \"had an entertaining enough adventure yarn to tell, but Mr Pullan seemed unable to develop the issues of his intriguing first act in a rich way through the stationary second, and then abandoned adventure to turn his third act into a much too rapid_, much too tritely tremulous, much too improbable study of a wrecked man's redemption into full and confident manhood.\" The paper's reviewer added that the \"dialogue had the surface fluency to be expected of an experienced hand in day-to-dsy radio writing, but the play...had something of radio's way of forcing over-heated dramatics into situations that could seem more plausible if allowed to generate more stealthily.\" The Age said the play was \"undistinguished\" with \"some of the most predictable action ever seen on stage\". ==References== ==External links== *details of premiere production at AusStage *Curly on the Rack at AustLit *Review of initial production *Program of Original Production at Elizabethan Theatre Trust Category:1950s Australian plays Category:1958 plays ",
