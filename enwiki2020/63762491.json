The Burmese fighters were matched against four Japanese fighters: Tamura, Yoshitaro Niimi, Takaharu Yamamoto and Seiji Wakasugi. During his reign, Shwe Sai faced Zaw Win Tun, 1996 Golden Belt Champion, with Shwe Sai having the upper hand having won one fight while the other was a draw. On 2 August 2019, Shwe Sai's son Sai Maung Maung, was supposed to continue the rivalry and face the son of his past rival Saw Win Tun at WLC 9: King of Nine Limbs, but the fight was cancelled due to medical reason. In 2006, Shwe Sai was stripped of the Openweight Lethwei World title for failure to defend the title. Former Openweight champion Shwe War Tun was selected to faced number one contender Lone Chaw to crown a new champion. Lone Chaw was victorious and became the new Openweight Champion. Shwe Sai and Lone Chaw eventually met in 2009 and Lone Chaw won the match by KO. == Championships and accomplishments == === Championships === *Lethwei World Champion ** Openweight Lethwei Golden Belt == Lethwei record == {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:100%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; font-size:85%; text-align:center;\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:darkGrey;\"| Professional Lethwei record |- valign=\"top\" | 0 fights, 0 wins (0 (KO/TKO's), 0 losses, 0 draws {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#ddd;\" | Date || Result || Opponent || Event || Location || Method || Round || Time |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#c5d2ea;\" |- | 2019-11-25 || Draw || align=\"left\" | Saw Nga Man || Myanmar vs. Thailand Challenge Fights, Myaing Gyi Ngu || Hpa-an, Myanmar || Draw || 2 || 3:00 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#c5d2ea;\" |- | 2011 || Draw || align=\"left\" | Yan Gyi Aung || Challenge Fight https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kon1tKtWrLE|| Myanmar || Draw || 5 || 3:00 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#c5d2ea;\" |- | 2011 || Draw || align=\"left\" | Phoe Kay || Challenge Fight https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W93RoHVugo || Myanmar || Draw || 5 || 3:00 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fbb;\" |- | 2009-04-05 || Loss || align=\"left\" | Lone Chaw || Dagon Shwe Aung Lan Final || Yangon, Myanmar || KO || 5 || 0:18 |- ! style=background:white colspan=9 | |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#fbb;\" |- | 2009-02-28 || Loss || align=\"left\" | Yan Gyi Aung || Dagon Shwe Aung Lan Semi-final || Yangon, Myanmar || Decision || 5 || |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#c5d2ea;\" |- | 2008-04-27 || Draw || align=\"left\" | Yan Gyi Aung || Challenge Fights, Aung San National Indoor Stadium || Yangon, Myanmar || Draw || 5 || 3:00 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#c5d2ea;\" |- | 2005-10-16 || Draw || align=\"left\" | Lone Chaw || 2nd City F.M Aung Lan Tournament, M.C.C. || Yangon, Myanmar || Draw || 5 || 3:00 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#c5d2ea;\" |- | 2004-07-11 || Draw || align=\"left\" | Yoshitaro Niimi || Myanmar vs. Japan Challenge Fights || Yangon, Myanmar || Draw || 5 || 3:00 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\" | 2004-06-13 || Win ||align=left| Wan Chai || Challenge Fights, Thuwunna Gymnasium || Yangon, Myanmar || TKO || 3 || 2:52 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfc;\" | 2004 || Win ||align=left| Shan Lay Thway || Challenge Fight 2004 || Yangon, Myanmar || || || |- ! style=background:white colspan=9 | |} Legend: ==References== ==External links== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Burmese people of Karen descent Category:Burmese Lethwei practitioners Category:People from Kayin State ",
