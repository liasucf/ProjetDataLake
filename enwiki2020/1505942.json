After Lugaid was overthrown and killed by S\u00edrl\u00e1m, Eochu was driven into exile overseas, but he returned after twelve years, killed S\u00edrl\u00e1m with an arrow, and took the throne. His epithet is obscure: the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn says he gained it because of his exile,R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 255-257 while Geoffrey Keating explains it as meaning \"bare canoes\", because he had canoes for a fleet, in which he and his followers used to plunder neighbouring countries.Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.27 He ruled for twelve years, before he was killed by Eochu F\u00edadmuine and Conaing Bececlach. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la synchronises his reign with that of Artaxerxes I of Persia (465\u2013424 BC). The chronology of Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn dates his reign to 633\u2013621 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 856\u2013844 BC.Annals of the Four Masters M4344-4356 ==References== Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland ",
