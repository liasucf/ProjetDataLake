    "text": "is an anime series about a young schoolgirl named Azusa Noyama, nicknamed Azuki-chan because when she was in first grade, Ken Takayanagi, a boy in her class, accidentally reads her name, \"Azusa(\u3042\u305a\u3055)\", as \"Azuki(\u3042\u305a\u304d)\". ==Plot summary== Azusa Noyama (\u91ce\u5c71 \u6893 Noyama Azusa) always hated her nickname, Azuki (\u5c0f\u8c46\u3061\u3083\u3093 Azuki-chan). She hates it until one day a new boy, Y\u016bnosuke Ogasawara (\u5c0f\u7b20\u539f \u52c7\u4e4b\u52a9 Ogasawara Y\u016bnosuke), starts in the same class as her on the first day of fifth grade. Earlier that day, Azuki is teased by Ken Takayanagi (\u9ad8\u67f3 \u5065 Takayanagi Ken), or Ken-chan, about her nickname. Y\u016bnosuke passes by and happily memorizes the name becoming the first girl he notices. Azuki is overjoyed, and instantly falls in love with him, loving both him and her nickname. However, Azuki gets jealous when she sees him closer to other girls. Azuki lives with her mother, Keiko (\u3051\u3044\u5b50), with her father, Tadashi (\u6b63), and with her little brother, Daizu (\u5927\u8c46) in an apartment. Azuki has three best friends, Kaoru Nishino (\u897f\u91ce \u85ab Nishino Kaoru), Midori Kodama (\u5152\u7389 \u6301\u7389 \u7fe0 Kodama Jidama Midori) and Tomomi Takahashi (\u9ad8\u6a4b \u670b\u7f8e Takahashi Tomomi). Kaoru has blonde hair, and she's calm and sensitive so she often cries. She lives with her mom, who owns a salon, near from Azuki's apartment. Kaoru secretly crushes on Ken but he doesn't accept her because he likes Azuki. Although in that situation, Kaoru still thinks Azuki is her best friend. Later, Ken starts to open up to Kaoru and gets closer to her. Midori Kodama is a tomboy and her close friends call her \"Jidama\". She lives with her grandmother. They seem to have a very close relationship except one episode when Jidama have gone out and sneaked in Azuki's bedroom because of an argument with her grandmother. She doesn't have a crush on anyone but in an episode, she falls for a police officer who helped her when her house was robbed. However, Jidama stops crushing on him when she realizes that the police officer is already married. Tomomi, whom her friends called her \"Tomo-chan\" or \"Tomo\" is the class president. She wears glasses and has her hair in a black bob. She really likes Makoto Sakaguchi (\u5742\u53e3 \u8aa0 Sakaguchi Makoto), a close friend of Y\u016bnosuke. Makoto didn't notice her at first but at last he asks her to go on a date in his parents' hotel, and eventually gets closer with Tomo. Makoto is a rich boy but is not one of the spoiled brats. He is kind of sleepy and was intelligent \"until 3rd grade\". He's one of Y\u016bnosuke's best friends, and they really are close. Not only Azuki has a crush on Y\u016bnosuke, but apparently most girls in her class also have feelings about him. One of them is Y\u014dko Sakakibara, a rich girl whose mom is a friend of Y\u016bnosuke's. Y\u014dko thinks she will get Y\u016bnosuke as her boyfriend and tries to separate him with Azuki. Ken \"Ken-chan\" Takayanagi is also a best friend of Y\u016bnosuke. He's also a childhood friend of Azuki. Ken's father owns a ramen stall near Azuki's apartment, so Azuki always orders ramen from Ken's stall. Ken's mother doesn't appear a lot in the episodes. In the second season, there was a new music teacher that Azuki is jealous of because she seems close to Y\u016bnosuke. However, Azuki gets over it soon. Before, in the first season, Azuki and Y\u016bnosuke have their first kiss after he was beaten up by some middle school students. The funny part is that Y\u016bnosuke thinks that Azuki will have a baby for that. Later, he finds out that this isn't true. Also, in one episode, a sixth-grader crushes on Azuki and follows her wherever she goes. When they were little, Azuki helped him find his ball. Finally, he stopped wanting Azuki's response. Daizu, Azuki's younger brother, also get his own story. He has a girlfriend who unfortunately falls for Y\u016bnosuke but then gets back to him because realizing that Y\u016bnosuke is already with Azuki. Before her, Daizu fell in love with Y\u014dko...but he completely forgets her. Azuki, Kaoru, and Tomo makes a club called \"Club of Unreturned Love/ One-Sided Love\" in one of the first episodes. Makoto's older sister, which it's hard to believe she's his sister, appeared in a few episodes. == External links == * Category:1993 manga Category:1995 anime television series Category:Kodansha manga Category:Madhouse (company) Category:NHK original programming Category:Romance anime and manga Category:School life in anime and manga Category:Sh\u014djo manga Category:Yasushi Akimoto ",
