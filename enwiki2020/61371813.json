He became the wealthiest person in the Arab garrison town and administrative center of Kufa in Iraq.Shaban 1971, p. 60, note 1. When Kufa was added to Ziyad ibn Abihi's governorship by Caliph Mu'awiya I in 670, thereby making Ziyad governor of all Iraq, Ziyad made Amr his deputy governor over Kufa.Elad 2008, p. 172.Hawting 1989, p. 37, note 183. He remained in this post until Ziyad's death in 673 and was reinstalled by Ziyad's son and ultimate successor, Ubayd Allah who took office in 675. Ibn Ziyad also made him head of his shurta (security forces). Ibn Ziyad was expelled from Basra after the death of Caliph Yazid I () and Amr was similarly toppled by the Kufans, who replaced him with Amir ibn Mas'ud al- Jumahi.p. 92.
