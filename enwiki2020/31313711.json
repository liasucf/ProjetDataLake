    "text": "The expedition of Kurz bin Jabir Al-Fihri took place in February 628AD, 10th month of 6AH of the Islamic calendar. The attack was directed at eight robbers who killed a Muslim. The Muslims captured the robbers and crucified them (according to the Islamic sources). (online) The Quran verse 5:33 about the punishment of those who spread mischief in the land (Fasad), was revealed in this event.Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman, The Meaning and Explanation of the Glorious Qur'an (Vol 2) 2nd Edition, p. 392, MSA Publication Limited (2009), ==Background and attack== Eight members Banu Uraynah, a Bedouin tribe, came to Muhammad and embraced Islam. They stayed in Madinah but found its climate didn\u2019t suit them, so they were asked to pitch their tents in the pastures nearby, and were given water to drink. They subsequently attacked Muhammad\u2019s shepherd Yasar, a freed slave, killed him and then drove off the camels. This news reached Muhammad, who sent a group of twenty Muslims led by Karz bin Jabir Al-Fihri on their track. The accused were brought back and handed over to Muhammad. He had their hands and feet cut off and their eyes gouged out with hot iron, in recompense for their behaviour, and then they were thrown on the stony ground until they died. (online) According to the Muslim scholar Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, the eight men were killed \"according to the law of equality\" in Islam. In this event, the verses on the punishment of waging war against Allah and for theft were revealed (5:33-5:39). ==Criticism== The Non Muslim historian Sir William Muir, criticised this event and referred to it as the \u201cBarbarous execution of eight robbers\u201d. ==Islamic primary sources== In this event, the verses on the punishment of waging war against Allah and for theft were revealed (5:33-5:39). It states: The commentary of the famous Muslim Scholar and Quran commentator Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir, is as follows: `Wage war' mentioned here means, oppose and contradict, and it includes disbelief, blocking roads and spreading fear in the fairways. Mischief in the land refers to various types of evil. Ibn Jarir recorded that `Ikrimah and Al- Hasan Al-Basri said that the Ayat, (The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger) until, (Allah is Of-Forgiving, Most Merciful,) \"Were revealed about the idolators. Therefore, the Ayah decrees that, whoever among them repents before you apprehend them, then you have no right to punish them. This Ayah does not save a Muslim from punishment if he kills, causes mischief in the land or wages war against Allah and His Messenger and then joins rank with the disbelievers, before the Muslims are able to catch him. He will still be liable for punishment for the crimes he committed. Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i recorded that `Ikrimah said that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah, (The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land...) \"Was revealed concerning the idolators, those among them who repent before being apprehended, they will still be liable for punishment for the crimes they committed. The correct opinion is that this Ayah is general in meaning and includes the idolators and all others who commit the types of crimes the Ayah mentioned. [Tafsir ibn Kathir, Surah Maidah 5:39, \"The Punishment of those who cause mischief in the Land\"] The event is also mentioned in the Sunni Hadith collection, Sahih Bukhari as follows: ==See also== *Military career of Muhammad *List of expeditions of Muhammad ==Notes== Category:627 Category:Campaigns ordered by Muhammad ",
