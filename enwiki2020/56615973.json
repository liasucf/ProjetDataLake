    "text": "Erica \u00d7 darleyensis (Darley Dale heath), is a plant hybrid between the heathers E. carnea and E. erigena, probably of garden origin. It is a bushy shrub growing to tall by broad, with white to rose-pink urn-shaped flowers in late winter and early spring. Unlike some plants in this genus, it has no particular requirement for acid soil but does require sharp drainage in full sun. It is especially suitable as groundcover, for instance as an underplanting for conifers. The seedling was found in a nursery in Darley Dale, Derbyshire, UK, prior to 1900. It has given rise to a large number of cultivars, and the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s Award of Garden Merit:- *E. \u00d7 darleyensis \u2018Arthur Johnson\u2019 *E. \u00d7 darleyensis \u2018Furzey\u2019 *E. \u00d7 darleyensis \u2018Ghost Hills\u2019 *E. \u00d7 darleyensis \u2018J.W.
