He represented Waterbury several times in the Connecticut Legislature, was for three terms Mayor of the city, and through his life an active democratic politician. In 1870 he was nominated for US Congress, but was not elected. He died in Waterbury, May 27, 1877, being on that day 52 years of age. He had been confined to his house for several weeks by rheumatism, which so seriously affected the bones of one leg that an operation was performed and some pieces of the bone removed. Afterwards an artery in the leg burst, and he lived but a few hours. In October, 1849, he was married to Miss Marian Mair, of Waterbury, who survived him with two of their three children. One son graduated Yale in 1872. His residence, the John Kendrick House, is now a historical site.
