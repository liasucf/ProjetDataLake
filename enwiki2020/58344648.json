    "text": "\"Normal\" is a song by American rapper Eminem from his tenth studio album Kamikaze. It was released as the album's fifth track on August 31, 2018 via Shady Records along with the rest of the album. Recording sessions took place at Effigy Studios in Detroit. Produced by Illadaproducer, Symbolyc One and Lonestarrmuzik, the song contains samples from Little Dragon's song \"Seconds\". Despite never being released as a single, the song has managed to chart worldwide. The rapper speaks about a volatile, mutually toxic relationship that throws several parallels to the hit single \"Love the Way You Lie\". He raps in the song's opening: \"I love you but I hope you fuckin' die tho\". Tom Breihan of Stereogum wrote: \"Eminem freaks out on an on-and-off girlfriend, accusing her of cheating or of getting back at him by dressing sexy when she goes out. He complains that she\u2019s being \u201cextra, like a fuckin\u2019 terrestrial\u201d. As the song progresses, he's rapping about putting tracking devices on her car or hitting her with a baseball bat. And that's where the plausible deniability comes in. Em's exaggerating things to ridiculous extents, so we know he's making dark jokes, not being serious. It's the most poisonous form of self- awareness, the kind that just dares you to get offended or triggered\". ==Personnel== *Marshall Mathers \u2013 main artist, vocals, mixing, songwriter *Ray Fraser \u2013 producer, songwriter *Larry Griffin Jr. \u2013 producer, songwriter *Maurice Nichols \u2013 producer, songwriter *Ricky Sheldon \u2013 additional producer, songwriter *Mike Strange \u2013 recording, mixing *Joe Strange \u2013 recording *Tony Campana \u2013 recording ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 songs Category:Eminem songs Category:Songs written by Eminem Category:Songs written by Symbolyc One Category:Song recordings produced by Symbolyc One ",
