    "text": "Victor Auburtin (5 September 1870 \u2013 28 June 1928) was a German journalist and writer. His style was idiosyncratic and at times pithy: he was a master of the German form of the Feuilleton genre. ==Life== Auburtin was born into a family that had emigrated from Alsace (at the time, part of France) a couple of generations earlier: his grandfather, Charles Louis Benoit Auburtin (1808\u20131885), had worked as a chef for the King of Prussia. Aubertin attended the French School in Berlin,The school now possesses the carved relief (image) of Auburtin which was removed from his grave in 1978 after it had fallen into disrepair. The relief was rescued on the initiative of the writer-journalist Heinz Knobloch, who was a great admirer of Auburtin. then moving on (with an extended travel break) to study acting, German studies, Arts and Literature at Berlin, Bonn and T\u00fcbingen. After that he began to write as an arts and theatre critic for the \"Berliner B\u00f6rsenzeitung\" (literally \"Berlin Stock exchange newspaper)\", for which his father, Charles Boguslav Auburtin (1837\u20131915) already worked as a journalist. Victor Auburtin also wrote during this time for the magazine \"Jugend\" (Youth) and for the satirical weekly, Simplicissimus.

Between 1911 and 1914 he worked for the Berliner Tageblatt (newspaper), based in Paris as the paper's foreign correspondent. However, in August 1914 war broke out, and he was identified as a prominent enemy alien. He was arrested and imprisoned at Dijon, in the east of France. He was then moved to a prison in Morsiglia on the island of Corsica. Here he remained till 1917, by when he was seriously ill, and the French released him. He was repatriated to Germany via Switzerland. His life in French internment was later recalled in a volume Auburtin produced in German and French entitled \"Was ich in Frankreich erlebte\"Was ich in Frankreich erlebte, Berlin, Mosse 1918 (\"My experiences in France\" / \"Carnet d' un boche en France 1914\u20131917\"). After 1917 he worked as a travel writer and freelance correspondence. Places on which he wrote included Madrid and, notably towards the end of his career, Rome. A story told \u2013 apparently by another cat lover \u2013 of his time in Rome concerns his unexpected disappearance one day. He was found in a state of mental confusion (geistig verwirrt) in Trajan's Forum, surrounded by some of the ferral cats who abound in the city. By this stage, the source asserts, he loved cats more than he loved people. ==Personal== In 1906 Victor Auburtin married Hedwig Gudlowski. Their final years together were greatly affected by Hedwig's mental illness.Die biographischen Informationen folgen weitgehend Wilmont Haackes Vorwort zu Victor Auburtin, Schalmei. Aus dem Nachlass, Hamburg 1948 ==Writing== Auburtin's journalism and literary work move between turn of the [nineteenth/twentieth] century literature and the \"classic modern\" style. Influences come both from his French ancestral provenance and his own upbringing in Prussia. His texts display an anecdotal lightness of touch, with elements of elitist Dandyism and an underlying conservatism, albeit not infrequently spiced with stark departures from the politically conservative mainstream. Auburtin was a huge admirer of the French political leader Jean Jaur\u00e8s, although he completely rejected Jaur\u00e8s' Socialism. With the various new artistic movements, which were a feature of the early twentieth century, he had difficulties. Unlike other conservative commentators, however, he did not campaign against artistic innovators: he viewed their outputs from a position of distanced sceptical interest, but not of unreasoned hostility. He was able to find intellectual joy in each new ideology that appeared, a tendency clearly disclosed in both the content and style of his own written commentaries and criticism. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:19th-century German literature Category:20th-century German literature Category:German male journalists Category:German journalists Category:1870 births Category:1928 deaths ",
