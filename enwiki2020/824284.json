    "text": "Saul\u0117 (, ) is a solar goddess, the common Baltic solar deity in the Lithuanian and Latvian mythologies. The noun Saul\u0117/Saule in the Lithuanian and Latvian languages is also the conventional name for the Sun and originates from the Proto-Baltic name *Sauli\u0101 > *Saul\u0113.Baltic etymology ==Representation== Saul\u0117 is one of the most powerful deities, the goddess of life and fertility, warmth and health. She is patroness of the unfortunate, especially orphans. The Lithuanian and Latvian words for \"the world\" (pasaulis and pasaule) are translated as \"[a place] under the Sun\". Saul\u0117 is mentioned in one of the earliest written sources on Lithuanian mythology. According to the Slavic translation of the Chronicle by John Malalas (1261), a weak smith named Teliavelis made the Sun and threw it into the sky. Missionary Jerome of Prague (ca. 1369\u20131440) spent three years attempting to Christianize Lithuania and later recounted a myth about the kidnapped Saul\u0117. She was held in a tower by a powerful king and rescued by the zodiac using a giant sledgehammer. Jerome swore that he personally witnessed the hammer, venerated by the locals. ==Family== A circa 1912 painting by Janis Rozent\u0101ls depicting the daughters of Saule (Saules meitas) Saul\u0117 and M\u0117nuo/M\u0113ness (the Moon) were wife and husband. M\u0117nuo fell in love with Au\u0161rin\u0117 (the morning star or Venus). For his infidelity, Perk\u016bnas (thunder god) punished M\u0117nuo. There are different accounts of the punishment. One version has it that M\u0117nuo was cut into two pieces, but he did not learn from his mistakes and thus the punishment is repeated every month. Another version claims that M\u0117nuo and Saul\u0117 divorced, but both wanted to see their daughter \u017demyna (earth). That is why the Sun shines during the day, while the Moon visits at night. A third version claims that the face of M\u0117nuo was disfigured by either Dievas (the supreme god) or Saul\u0117. In other myths, Au\u0161rin\u0117 is depicted as a daughter and servant of Saul\u0117. Au\u0161rin\u0117 lights the fire for Saul\u0117 and makes her ready for another day's journey across the sky. Vakarin\u0117 (the evening star) makes the bed for Saul\u0117 in the evening. In the Lithuanian mythology, Saul\u0117 was mother of other planets: Indraja (Jupiter), S\u0117lija (Saturn), \u017diezdr\u0117 (Mars), Vaivora (Mercury). ==Feasts== Saul\u0117's feast was celebrated during the summer solstice. Lithuanian Rasos (turned into Saint Jonas' Festival by Christianity) and Latvian L\u012bgo (turned into J\u0101\u0146i) involve making wreaths, looking for the magical fern flower, burning bonfires, dancing around and leaping over the fire, and greeting the Sun when it rises at around 4 am next morning. It is the most joyous traditional holiday. The winter solstice is celebrated as the return of Saul\u0117. Christianity absorbed Lithuanian K\u016b\u010dios and Latvian Ziemassv\u0113tki into Christmas. Other celebrations took place around the equinoxes. ==See also== * List of solar deities * Proto-Indo-European mythology * Indo-European cosmogony * Baltic mythology * Lithuanian mythology * Prussian mythology * Latvian mythology ==References== Category:Lithuanian goddesses Category:Mother goddesses Category:Fertility goddesses Category:Solar goddesses Category:Childhood goddesses Category:Baltic goddesses Category:Latvian goddesses Category:Baltic gods ",
