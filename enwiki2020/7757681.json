    "text": "The Danrin school (\u8ac7\u6797\u6d3e) is a school of haikai poetry founded by the poet Nishiyama S\u014dinSargent, G.W. and Ihara Saikaku. The Japanese Family Storehouse; Or the Millionaires Gospel Modernised; Nippon Eitai-Gura or Daifuku Shin Choja Kyo 1688. Cambridge University Press, 1959 xv (1605 to 1682). The name literally means 'talkative forest'. It aimed to move away from the serious \"bookishness\" popular in Japanese poetry at the time and to become more in touch with the common people, therefore infusing a greater spirit of freedom into their poetry. The Danrin school favored the usage of plain language, everyday subjects, and the use of humor. Its members explored people's daily life for sources of playfulness, though they were often accused of ending up with mere frivolity. The renowned poet Matsuo Bash\u014d was once a member of the Danrin school, though he later broke away from it. ==References== Category:Japanese poetry Category:Poetry movements Category:Japanese literary movements Category:17th-century Japanese literature ",
