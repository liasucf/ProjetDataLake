The original name of his family was Ruffini. Jen\u0151 attended primary school in Dobsina, and high school in K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk (today Ke\u017emarok, Slovakia). He then took up mining studies in Selmecb\u00e1nya (today Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica, Slovakia), where he earned his degree in 1869. On his return to Dobsina, he became a mining overseer and metallurgical inspector. ==Exploration of the Ice Cave== While touring Ducsa Hill near Dobsina with his friend, Lt. Gustav Lang, in 1869, Ruffinyi threw a stone into an opening in the rock that was known as Cold Hole () in local lore. From the multiple and delayed echos, the men got the impression that a substantial cave must extend beyond the entrance and decided to return for an exploration. On June 15, 1870, Ruffinyi was the first to enter the cave, sliding down on a hemp rope. ==Honors== The elementary school in Dob\u0161in\u00e1, Jen\u0151 Ruffinyi Elementary School (), is named after Ruffinyi. ==References== == Sources == * Krenner J.S., Die Eish\u00f6hle von Dobschau.
