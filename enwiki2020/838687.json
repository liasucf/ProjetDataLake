    "text": "The Cranbourne line is a commuter rail service operated by Metro Trains Melbourne in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It operates along the inner section of the former South Gippsland line. The service is part of the Public Transport Victoria metropolitan train network. ==Description== The line traverses flat country and there is little in the way of earthworks. There are a few level crossings along the line. The area around Cranbourne is one of Melbourne's main growth areas, giving the line considerable potential for growing patronage. ==Infrastructure== The line, which branches from the Pakenham line at Dandenong, is single track after the Greens Rd level crossing, with a crossing loop at Lynbrook towards the Cranbourne end of the line. Trains can also cross at Cranbourne itself, which has two platforms. Power signalling is provided throughout, being controlled from Dandenong. There are no intermediate terminating facilities, however stabling sidings were recently constructed and opened in Cranbourne. Beyond Cranbourne there is a siding between Cameron Street and Berwick-Cranbourne Road near the Cranbourne \"Shed\" and the new Hunt Club Estate. The line then continues to Leongatha, but between Cranbourne and Nyora, the line is unserviceable. ==Services== On weekdays, Cranbourne line services run express between South Yarra and Caulfield between 06:00 and 22:00 (06:00 - 08:00 Flinders Street direction only), and operates as shuttles to and from Dandenong, connecting with a Pakenham line train, at all other times. During peak, some services originate and terminate at Westall or Dandenong running express between South Yarra and Caulfield. During the morning peak, these short services may also instead run express between Richmond and Caulfield outbound. On weekends, Cranbourne line services run express between South Yarra and Caulfield between 11:00 and 19:00, and stops all stations between Flinders Street and Cranbourne from 06:45 to 11:00 (09:30 to 11:00 on Sundays) and from 19:00 to 20:15 (Flinders Street direction only). At all other times services operate as shuttles to and from Dandenong, connecting with a Pakenham line train. Weekday morning and weekend services run anticlockwise through the City Loop, while weekday afternoon services run clockwise. The only freight traffic was cement traffic from Waurn Ponds near Geelong to Lyndhurst, this ended in 2009 after Pacific National increased the costs charged to Blue Circle Southern. In September 2019, Qube Holdings commenced operating a daily service on a short section of the line hauling containerised cemen to the Kimberly-Clark siding at Dandenong South.Qube Dandenong Cement (9571/9572) Newsrail January 2020 page 25 ==History== The Cranbourne line opened in December 1886 as part of the section to Tooradin. This was the first section of the South Gippsland Railway, with passenger services to Leongatha withdrawn on 24 July 1993. The last train ran on 24 July 1993 with P class locomotive hauling an FSH set to Leongatha and back to Melbourne. Shortly after the Leongatha service was axed, V/Line's then newly introduced Sprinters railcars were tested along the line from Dandenong to Cranbourne for a short period of time until the electrification of the line to Cranbourne was completed in March 1995.'High speed with Sprinter', Tracks Magazine (Railways of Australia Network)): pages 14-17. January, February, March 1992 In November 1993, Train Order Working replaced Electric Staff safeworking to Cranbourne, then on 24 March 1995, the electrification and power signalling on the Cranbourne line was commissioned. Funded as part of the Federal Government \"Building Better Cities\" program, the $27 million project included an upgraded Dandenong station and a new Merinda Park station at Cranbourne North (the line had previously been electrified for a short distance to the Commonwealth Engineering siding). The last regular train running through and beyond Cranbourne was on 16 January 1998, when the AGM Siding (near Nyora) to Spotswood station sand train ceased operation. In 2008, work started on the construction of six train stabling sidings at Cranbourne station at a cost of $37 million, to enable more trains to run on the line at peak times without duplicating the line, which was completed in November the same year, along with a major upgrade of the station and the extension of platform 2. In January 2018, the City of Casey launched the Commit to Casey campaign to request the State Government and Opposition, to provide $2.7 billion in funding for the Dandenong\u2013Cranbourne duplication and Clyde extension. Later that year, the Victoria State Government agreed to allocate $750 million for track duplication. It will be delivered in conjunction with Melbourne Metro and Level Crossing Removal Project. This will allow the number of train services to double during peak times, with trains running every 10 minutes along the line. Tracks between Caulfield and Dandenong stations will also be upgraded. The project includes rebuilding of Merinda Park station and provision for the future rail extension to Clyde. In March 2020, contract for the upgrading was awarded to McConnell Dowell, Arup, Mott MacDonald and Metro Trains Melbourne. Works will start later in 2020 and will be completed by 2023. == Incidents == On 3 November 2012, a truck travelling along Abbotts Road, in Dandenong South, was hit by a Cranbourne-bound train at about 11:40am. The accident caused the train to jack-knife, causing severe damage to the train, as well as the track and overhead infrastructure. One passenger died at the scene of the accident, having suffered a heart attack, while at least 13 others, including the train driver, were injured. ==References== ==External links== *Cranbourne line timetable *Official line map *Network map *Statistics and detailed schematic map at the VicSig enthusiast website Category:Railway lines in Melbourne Category:Railway lines opened in 1886 ",
