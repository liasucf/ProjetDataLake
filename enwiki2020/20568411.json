He was the son of William Robertson and Sarah Timpany. He went to sea at a young age. Robertson married Bethiah Davoue, the daughter of Frederick Davoue (Devoux). He was involved in the trade with the West Indies. During his term in office, Robertson's business failed and his creditors had him put in jail; the other members of the assembly had him removed from jail so that he could continue to sit in the assembly. He is buried in the Garrison Cemetery (Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia). == References == * Calnek, W. A.
