    "text": "s2n is an open-source implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol; the name comes from the signal-to-noise ratio. It is developed by Amazon Security Labs as a way to provide some code that would be easier to review than OpenSSL.Stephen Schmidt, Introducing s2n, a New Open Source TLS Implementation, on the Amazon Security Blog It was released on June 30, 2015 on GitHub.s2n : an implementation of the TLS/SSL protocols, on GitHub The code of s2n is about 6,000 lines long, compared to the 500,000 lines of OpenSSL. It has already been the subject of several external reviews as well as penetration testing. It has a strong focus on usability and simplicity. == Features == === TLS extensions === Common TLS extensions supported by this software are Server Name Indication, Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation and Online Certificate Status Protocol. === Cryptography === s2n supports the main ciphers in use today, such as AES in CBC and GCM modes, 3DES and RC4. It also provides support for perfect forward secrecy through Diffie\u2013Hellman or Elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman ephemeral keys. The weaker ciphers and key exchange modes are disabled by default. == Language bindings == LuaJIT 2.0 binding == References == Category:Cryptographic software Category:C (programming language) libraries Category:Free security software Category:Transport Layer Security implementation ",
