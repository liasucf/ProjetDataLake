    "text": "The 2020 United States Senate election in Massachusetts will be held on November 3, 2020, to elect a member of the United States Senate to represent the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, concurrently with the 2020 U.S. presidential election, as well as elections to the United States Senate in other states, elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. On September 1, incumbent Senator Ed Markey defeated U.S. Representative Joe Kennedy III in a competitive primary for the Democratic nomination and Kevin O'Connor defeated Shiva Ayyadurai for the Republican nomination. ==Democratic primary== The state primary election took place on September 1, 2020. Incumbent Senator Ed Markey was challenged by U.S. Representative Joe Kennedy III. Kennedy and Markey have similar political positions, though Markey is considered more liberal on the DW-Nominate scale. An elected senator has not been defeated in a primary since Richard Lugar in 2012, and an elected Democrat has not been defeated since Joe Lieberman in 2006.. Arlen Specter, who was elected as a Republican but switched parties to Democratic, was defeated in 2010 during his first Democratic primary. Support from within the Democratic Party was divided. Markey received support from the DSCC, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, and DSCC chair Catherine Cortez Masto. He was also endorsed by key figures in the party's progressive wing, such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, fellow Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, and the youth-led Sunrise Movement. Kennedy received various endorsements from the House leadership, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi (which was noteworthy because speakers rarely endorse candidates in competitive primaries, especially challengers to incumbents), House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, House Democratic Caucus chair Hakeem Jeffries, House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff, and House Democratic Senior Chief Deputy Whip John Lewis. Markey's margin of victory of 10.8% was attributed to his unexpected strength among progressives and younger voters. Kennedy's loss marked the first time a member of the Kennedy family had lost an election in Massachusetts.. Robert F. Kennedy was not on the ballot in Massachusetts in the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries and finished second to Eugene McCarthy as a write-in candidate. ===Candidates=== ====Nominee==== *Ed Markey, incumbent U.S Senator ====Eliminated in primary==== *Joe Kennedy III, US Representative from Massachusetts' 4th Congressional District ====Withdrawn==== *Washington Blask *Shannon Liss-Riordan, labor attorney *Steve Pemberton, chief human resources officer of Workhuman (endorsed Markey) *Allen Waters, perennial candidate (switched to 2020 U.S. Senate election in Rhode Island Republican candidacy) (endorsed Kennedy) ====Declined==== *Maura Healey, Massachusetts Attorney General *Scott Lang, former mayor of New Bedford (endorsed Kennedy) *Juana Matias, former state representative and candidate for Massachusetts's 3rd congressional district in 2018 *Seth Moulton, former 2020 presidential candidate and incumbent U.S. Representative for Massachusetts's 6th congressional district (running for reelection) *Michelle Wu, Boston City Councilor ===Endorsements=== === Polling === {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;line- height:20px\" |+ !colspan=\"7\"|Joe Kennedy III vs. Ed Markey |- !Source of poll aggregation !Dates administered !Date updated !Joe !Ed Markey !Undecided !Margin |- |RealClearPolitics |July 31 \u2013 August 27, 2020 |August 27, 2020 |40.8% ||52.0% |7.2% ||Markey +11.2 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\" |- valign=bottom !
