I think as an actor you have a huge opportunity to find yourself through the roles that you choose. I think it's my time, right now in my life, to figure out who I am and what I am and what I want and what this industry means... Why not sit back, slow down, realize I'm 19 and go, 'Hey, let's make stuff that really, really hits hard with who I am and helps me figure out what it means to be a 19-year-old actor who is just doing her thing.'\" In 2017, Moretz co- starred again with Ansel Elgort, in the crime drama November Criminals.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time for them to have a voice right now,\u201d \u201cOf course, it\u2019s devastating to put time into a project and have it disappear, but at the same time, this movement is so powerful and so progressive that I\u2019m just happy to be in communication with everyone and to see the big change in the face of the industry, which I think is very, very real.\u201d In 2018, Moretz appeared in the drama film The Miseducation of Cameron Post opposite Sasha Lane and Forrest Goodluck revolving around a teenage girl who is sent to a conversion camp.
