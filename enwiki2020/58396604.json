The season began on 27 April and concluded on 15 September 2019, however it was suspended for most of the month of July due to the Netball World Cup, which was played in Liverpool. The New South Wales Swifts won the premiership, defeating two-time defending premiers Sunshine Coast Lightning by 17 goals in the Grand Final at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre. ==Overview== ===Teams=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\" |- !

The top four teams on the ladder at the conclusion of the regular season qualify for the finals series. In the first week of the finals series, the 1st ranked team hosts the 2nd ranked team in the major semi-final (with the winner of that match to qualify for the Grand Final) and the 3rd ranked team hosts the 4th ranked team in the minor semi-final (with the loser of that match eliminated). The loser of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the minor semi-final in the preliminary final. The winner of the major semi-final then hosts the winner of the preliminary final in the Grand Final. ==Player transfers== At the start of Super Netball in 2017, all players were contracted for a maximum of two years in line with the initial collective bargaining agreement negotiated by the players' association. Clubs were free to re-sign existing players in the last few weeks of the 2018 season, before the transfer window opened for unimpeded acquisitions at the end of the season. Clubs were given until 25 September 2018 to finalise their rosters for the 2019 season. ===Arrivals=== The following table is a list of players who moved clubs/leagues into Super Netball, or were elevated into a permanent position in the senior team, during the off-season.
