    "text": "Lake Wappapello is a reservoir on the St. Francis River, formed by Wappapello Dam (). Created in 1941, this lake is located south of St. Louis, Missouri. The reservoir lies mostly in Wayne County, but its southernmost reaches (near the dam) extend into northern Butler County, both in Missouri. Both the dam and reservoir are owned and operated for the public by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Its primary purpose is flood control, although it has been developed as a recreational area with ample opportunities to boat, fish, swim or camp. The fish population of the lake include white bass, largemouth bass, crappie, and bluegill. Lake Wappapello State Park is composed of territory on the southwestern side of the lake. ==References== ==External links== *U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Lake Wallapello * Category:Reservoirs in Missouri Category:Protected areas of Butler County, Missouri Category:Protected areas of Wayne County, Missouri Category:Buildings and structures in Butler County, Missouri Category:Buildings and structures in Wayne County, Missouri Category:Dams in Missouri Category:United States Army Corps of Engineers dams Category:Bodies of water of Butler County, Missouri Category:Bodies of water of Wayne County, Missouri ",
