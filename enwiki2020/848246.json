Most recently, the company has added U by Kotex to its line of menstrual hygiene products. Kotex is owned and managed by Kimberly-Clark, a consumer products corporation active in more than 80 countries. ==History== A Kotex newspaper advertisement from 1920 The modern, commercial, disposable pads seem to have started in the late nineteenth century with the company in Germany, and Johnson & Johnson in the United States. In the UK, the Birmingham firm of Southall Brothers & Barclay was advertising \"sanitary towels\" in The Family Doctor and Home Medical Adviser in the early 1890s. In the United States, Kotex was launched in 1920 by Kimberly-Clark to make use of leftover cellucotton (wood pulp fiber) from World War One bandages.www.mum.orgwww.mum.org An employee noted that the pads had a \"cotton- like texture\" which was abbreviated to \"cot-tex\" and then made the product name with alternate spelling. Kotex became well known in the 1920s after Kimberly-Clark placed advertisements in the women's magazines Good Housekeeping and Ladies' Home Journal. Although some readers were offended by the ads, the products' success led to more advertisements. Kimberly-Clark also promoted Kotex in Good Housekeeping by using intimate advice columnist Mary Pauline Callender. Originally sold in a hospital blue box at 12 for 60 cents, Victorian sexual prudishness caused slow acceptance until Montgomery Ward began advertising them in its 1926 catalog, reaching $11 million sales in 1927 in 57 countries.http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2252/who-invented- tampons It became one of the first self-service items in American retailing history after it was strategically placed on countertops with a special payment box so that the woman didn't have to ask a clerk for it and touch hands. Tampax appeared in 1936. Belts were needed until the 1970 introduction of Stayfree by Personal Products Co. and New Freedom Pads by Kimberly-Clark. New Freedom is a former brand in the Kotex family. New Freedom was one of the first beltless pads manufactured in the early 1970s. ==Product line== In August 2009 Kotex launched a premium sub-brand called Kotex Luxe in Singapore. It launched U by Kotex Tween, products aimed at girls aged 8\u201312 in the US in 2011. ==Recalls and defects== In September 2012 Kimberly-Clark issued a warning regarding a shipment of rejected Kotex tampons that had been stolen and sold to the public. The company said that the defective products posed only a minor health risk to consumers. In December 2018, Kimberly-Clark issued a recall of U by Kotex Sleek tampons due to findings that the product would sometimes break apart during removal, leaving behind fragments in the body that could require medical attention for removal. ==Notes== ==References== * ==Further reading== * Guadagnolo, D.
