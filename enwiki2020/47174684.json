    "text": "Francisca Raquel Navas Gardela, better known as Paca Navas (1883-1971), was a Honduran journalist, writer and feminist. She founded the first feminist journal in Honduras and was a member of the first suffragette organization. She and her husband spent most of their lives in exile due to their liberal leanings. Her most productive writing period was during her Guatemalan exile from 1945 to 1951. ==Biography== Francisca Raquel Navas Gardela better known as Paca Navas was born on March 23, 1883 in Juticalpa, Olancho, Honduras to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Navas and Francisca Gardela de Navas. In 1900, she married the attorney, intellectual and journalist Adolfo Miralda. Her husband was involved in politics and strongly supported the liberal opposition in his writings, resulting in the family's persecution by the government. Navas' friend and fellow writer Ram\u00f3n Amaya Amador extended the offer to her to take refuge in La Cieba and to publish the newspaper Costa Norte. Thus, they relocated to La Cieba, where they endured her husband's long political exile. In 1935 to help make ends meet, Navas founded a weekly newspaper La voz de Atl\u00e1ntida, which was a publication focused on Pan-American arts, literature and science. It was considered the first feminist journal in Honduras, covering topics such as aging, domestic abuse, incest, rape, homeless youth, and the subordination of women. On February 2, 1946 a group of suffragettes organized la Sociedad Femenina Panamericana with president Olimpia Varela y Varela and intellectuals Lucila Gamero de Medina, Argentina D\u00edaz Lozano and Navas. On March 5, 1947, they founded the Comit\u00e9 Femenino Hondure\u00f1o (affiliated with the Inter-American Commission of Women) with the goal of obtaining political rights for women. They published a magazine, Mujer Americana, which was the third feminist journal of the country, after Navas' Atl\u00e1ntida, and a journal named Atenea by Cristina Hern\u00e1ndez de Gomez\u2013\u2013begun in El Progreso in 1944.\"Villars (2001)\", pp 312\u2013313 In 1947 Navas represented the Uni\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica Femenina Hondure\u00f1a at the Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres in Guatemala City, Guatemala. There she introduced the theme of Political prisoners and exiles of Latin America to the assembly and denounced the forced political exile of 100 Hondurans during the 14 years of the dictatorship of Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino.\"Villars (2001)\", pp 314 At the time of the conference, Navas, having been exiled herself, was living in Guatemala under the protection of the President Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo. She lived in Guatemala from 1945 to 1951. Ram\u00f3n Amaya Amador sought refuge with her in Guatemala. The Guatemalan sojourn marked her most productive writing period, in part because she could publish her work. In 1947, Navas published a book of poems, Ritmos criollos and followed that with her novel Barro in 1951. Barro had actually been written in 1940, but was barred from publication in Honduras. Barro was set in a newly established workers' town for fruit pickers. It addressed the distress that accompanied their relocation from their traditional villages for better working opportunities and looked at the exploitation of the national territory by foreigners. She died on July 11, 1971 in Seattle, Washington while visiting her daughter. ==Selected works== * Ritmos criollos (1947) * Barro (1951) * Mar de fondo * Campi\u00f1a olanchana * Rutas de silencio * C\u00e1mara obscura * Atra\u00eddos ==Barro (1951)== One of the best examples of the Criollismo literary movement in Honduras and written during the 1940s. However, it was not able to be published until 1951 in Guatemala during the presidency of Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo, Guatemala's first democratically elected president. ==Atra\u00eddos== This novel has 17 sections, the two first ones being an introduction and a few words to the reader.
