It is the mouthpiece of Popular Front of India and is owned by Intermedia Publishing Limited, a public limited company based in Calicut. The last printed edition was published on 31 December 2018, leaving only the online edition.\"PFI mouthpiece Thejas to stop publication this year\". The Indian Express. 22 October 2018. Retrieved 22 May 2020. ==History== Thejas started publishing from Calicut (Kozhikode) on the Indian republic day on 26 January 2006. Within a short span of three months it started another edition from Trivandrum (Thiruvananthapuram) followed by the third edition from Kochi within another three months. Also Kannur edition started in 2008 as part of the expansion. In December 2009, it started its Kottayam edition. It also started an online edition and an e-paper. Thejas started its Gulf editions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam in March 2011. The fourth Gulf Edition started in Doha on 17 May 2012.http://www.qatar- tribune.com/data/20120517/content.asp?section=nation2_3 The fifth Gulf Edition of Thejas was launched in Bahrain on 27 September 2012 by Akhbar Al Khaleej editor-in-chief Anwar Abdulrahman at a ceremony held in Manama. In October 2018 Thejas decided to close its print edition and become an online newspaper; the last printed edition was published on 31 December 2018. The magazine by the same name however continued operation and is still in print. The management cited the dwindling revenues from advertisements and increasing debts as the reason for closing the print edition. ==Controversies== In 2010, the Communist government in Kerala denied Thejas any advertisements, citing intelligence inputs about the nature of the paper's coverage and its alleged attempts to create religious discord in the state. The Congress-led UPA government at the Centre followed suit, citing similar reasons. The 2011 May edition called Osama bin laden A Martyr after his death in a raid. In October 2013, the district administration of Kozhikode issued a show-cause notice to the newspaper for spreading anti-national reports and why the publication should not be stopped. In March 2014, Kerala Police registered a case against Thejas and some other media organizations, in response to a petition accusing of insulting religious sentiments. ==References== Category:Malayalam-language newspapers Category:Companies based in Kozhikode Category:2006 establishments in India Category:Asian news websites Category:Indian news websites Category:Mass media in Kerala Category:Newspapers published in Kerala Category:Daily newspapers published in India ",
