His chairs featured parachute webbing and modernist design and according to the Powerhouse Museum, were \"Australia's first popular, mass produced range of furniture sold widely through the major department stores from the late 1940s to the mid 1950s.\"Powerhouse Museum.

In the mid-1960s they travelled to Cambodia, which started a long interest in that country that led him to friendship Prince Sihanouk, an appointment as an honorary consul (1970-75), and a hobby of collecting and trading Khmer antiquities. After Patricia's death in 1976, he moved with his teenage sons to Honolulu, where he married Swedish artist Marianne Sparre in the early 1980s. In 1985, he was concerned enough about his failing health to suddenly book a flight back to Sydney, where he died several days later of a brain aneurism. == References == ==Further reading== * Bogle, Michael.
