    "text": "Talking Turkey was a British adult comic that was published monthly by Galaxy Publications from 1991 to 1992. Talking Turkey was one of many such comics emulating the success of Viz, yet departed from the usual crude copycat approach of many of its peers by combining 'classic' underground strips with modern content by recognised cartoonists. Its sibling publications were the political Brain Damage, the deliberate Viz clone Gas, and the surreal Elephant Parts. Went to at least issue: Vol. 2 No. 3. Artists/Strips included: * Hunt Emerson * Fat Freddy's Cat * Gilbert Shelton * Rex Splendor Category:Adult humour titles Category:Defunct British comics Category:Publications established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in the United Kingdom ",
