    "text": "Salzderhelden saltworks () was a saline in Salzderhelden, a district of Einbeck city, Germany. Salzderhelden saltworks featuring the 1884 derrick == History == The start of salt extraction at the site began in 1757. A brine spring had been discovered in the proximity much earlier, in the medieval ages.Wilhelm G\u00f6rges: Vaterl\u00e4ndische Geschichten und Denkw\u00fcrdigkeiten der Vorzeit, 1844, p. 263 That was feasible because a Zechstein layer is located in the ground.Alexander von Humboldt: Geognostischer Versuch \u00fcber die Lagerung der Gebirgsarten in beiden Erdh\u00e4lften, 1823, p. 252 A graduation tower was built in 1772. From 1851 on balneotherapy was offered for guests.Vereinigung der Freunde von Kunst und Kultur im Bergbau: Der Anschnitt 58, 2006, p. 103 In 1860 a drilling for brine was set as deep as 450m into the ground, replacing the graduation tower.Hans-Heinz Emons, Hans-Henning Walter: Alte Salinen in Mitteleuropa, 1988, p. 141 Also, a steam engine was installed to lift the brine to the surface. The steam engine replaced wind mills that had been in use until then. A second derrick was built in 1884. An electrical pump replaced the steam engine in 1920. Power transmission was achieved by line shaft. In the 20th century the facility was shut down, but the drilling tower was preserved and is an industrial heritage nowadays. == Museum == The power transmission devices were refurbished in 2009. In 2011 the site with its 19th century buildings including the derrick, the engine house and the wooden brine tank was reopened as museum, open for guided tours. == Literature == * Bastian Sauthoff: Wei\u00dfes Gold und vergessene Technik.
