    "text": "Housing Bank of Rwanda (HBR), also known as Rwanda Housing Bank, was a commercial bank in Rwanda. Its name in French is Banque de l'Habitat du Rwanda SA (BHR). The bank was one of the commercial banks licensed by the National Bank of Rwanda, the national banking regulator. List of Licensed Commercial Banks In Rwanda ==History== The bank was opened in 1975, as a housing finance institution as well as a real estate developer. HBR was registered as a limited liability company. On 2 July 2004, the National Bank of Rwanda, the country's Central Bank, granted HBR a Provisional License to operate as a Housing Bank. The license was contingent upon the institution raising its share capital to the minimum of US$2.65 million, to comply with then current banking laws in Rwanda. On 25 February 2005, the shareholders of Banque de l'Habiatat du Rwanda (BHR), held an Extra Ordinary General Meeting and decided to increase their share capital to the required minimum, to change their name to Housing Bank of Rwanda and to change their mission from a mortgage company/real estate developer to a Commercial Bank that specializes in Housing Finance. ==Ownership== As of April 2010, the bank's stock was owned by the following corporate entities: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin- left:auto;margin-right:auto\" |+ Housing Bank of Rwanda Stock Ownership ! style=\"width:2em;\" |Rank !!Name of Owner!!Percentage Ownership |- |1||Government of Rwanda||56.00 |- |2||Social Security Fund of Rwanda||30.00 |- |3||Rwanda Development Bank||5.00 |- |4||Bank of Kigali||5.00 |- |5||Commercial Bank of Rwanda||1.66 |- |6||MAGERWA||1.66 |- |7||Office of Th\u00e9||0.68 |- |||Total||100.00 |- |} ==Branch network== As of April 2010, the bank maintained its headquarters at Avenue de la Justice, in the city of Kigali, Rwanda's capital. No other branches were known to exist at that time. ==Takeover and liquidation== In April 2011, Rwanda Development Bank, known by its French symbols BRD, acquired a 100% controlling interest in Housing Bank of Rwanda. BRD is in the process of absorbing the assets, liabilities and staff of HBR. After re-organization, BRD will commence retail banking operations. In addition, it will begin underwriting mortgage products originated by other commercial banks in the country, in an attempt to increase home ownership in Rwanda. At the time of takeover, HBR's total assets were valued at about US$23.7 million (RWF:14 billion). ==External links== * HBR One of Three Rwandan Banks in Mortgage Financing (HBR, CBR & KCB) * Housing Bank of Rwanda Acquired By Development Bank of Rwanda ==See also== * List of banks in Rwanda * Economy of Rwanda ==References== Category:Banks of Rwanda Category:Banks established in 1975 Category:Real estate companies established in 1975 Category:Banks disestablished in 2011 Category:1975 establishments in Rwanda Category:2011 disestablishments in Rwanda Category:Organisations based in Kigali Category:Economy of Kigali ",
