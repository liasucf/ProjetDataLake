In 1840, the Cambodian queen Ang Mey was deposed by Vietnamese; she was arrested and deported to Vietnam along with her relatives and the royal regalia. Spurred by the incident, many Cambodian courtiers and their followers revolted against the Vietnamese rule. The rebels appealed to Siam who supported another claimant to the Cambodian throne, Prince Ang Duong. Rama III responded and sent Ang Duong back from exile in Bangkok with Siamese troops to install him on the throne. The Vietnamese suffered attack from both Siamese troops and Cambodian rebels. What was worse, in Cochinchina, there were several rebellion broke out. The main strength of Vietnamese marched to Cochinchina to put down those rebellions. Thi\u1ec7u Tr\u1ecb, the new crowned Vietnamese emperor, decided to seek a peaceful resolution. Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Minh Gi\u1ea3ng, the Governor-General of Tr\u1ea5n T\u00e2y (Cambodia), was called back. Gi\u1ea3ng was arrested and later committed suicide in prison. Ang Duong agreed to place Cambodia under joint Siamese- Vietnamese protection in 1846. The Vietnamese released Cambodian royalties and returned the royal regalia. In the same time, Vietnamese troops pulled out of Cambodia. Finally, Vietnamese lost control of this country, Cambodia won independence from Vietnam. Though there were still a few Siamese troops stayed in Cambodia, the Cambodian king had greater autonomy than before. ==Notes== ;Footnote ;Citations ==References== * * ==See also== *Cambodian rebellion (1811\u201312) *Cambodian rebellion (1820) *Siamese\u2013Vietnamese War (1841\u20131845) * * * * Category:19th century in Cambodia Category:19th century in Vietnam Category:Nguyen dynasty Category:Cambodia\u2013Vietnam relations Category:Wars involving Vietnam Category:Wars involving Cambodia Category:Wars involving Thailand Category:Rebellions in Asia Category:Conflicts in 1840 Category:19th- century rebellions Category:History of Cambodia Category:National liberation movements Category:Anti-Vietnamese sentiment ",
