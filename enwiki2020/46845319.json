    "text": "Thomas Walker (1784\u20131836) was an English barrister, police magistrate and author. He is now remembered for his one-man periodical, The Original. ==Life== He was the son of Thomas Walker (1749\u20131817) the radical, born at Barlow Hall, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, near Manchester, on 10 October 1784. His father was a Manchester cotton merchant. Walker went to Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated B.A. in 1808 and M.A. in 1811. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple on 8 May 1812. After the death of his father, he lived for some years at Longford Hall, Stretford, taking part in township affairs, and tackling pauperism. In 1829 he was appointed a police magistrate at the Lambeth Street court. On 20 May 1835 he began the publication of The Original, and continued it weekly until the following 2 December. Walker died unmarried at Brussels on 20 January 1836, and was buried in the cemetery there. A tablet to his memory was placed in St Mary's, Whitechapel. ==Works== In 1826 Walker published Observations on the Nature, Extent, and Effects of Pauperism, and on the Means of reducing it (2nd edit. 1831), and in 1834 Suggestions for a Constitutional and Efficient Reform in Parochial Government. He wrote from a Malthusian point of view. The Original was intended to raise \"the national tone in whatever concerns us socially or individually\", and comprised a collection of Walker's thoughts on many subjects. Its writing on health and gastronomy were most appreciated. Many later editions of The Original were published, with a reprint in 1850: *1874, with memoirs of the two Walkers by William Blanchard Jerrold; *1875, as edited by William Augustus Guy; *1887, one with an introduction by Henry Morley, and another \"arranged on a new plan\". A selection, entitled The Art of Dining and of attaining High Health, was printed at Philadelphia in 1837; and another selection, by Felix Summerley (Sir Henry Cole), was published in 1881 as Aristology, or the Art of Dining. ==Notes== Attribution Category:1784 births Category:1836 deaths Category:English barristers Category:English writers ",
