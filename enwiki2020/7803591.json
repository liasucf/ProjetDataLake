In 1854, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Napierville; he was reelected in 1858 and 1861. In 1862, he was elected to the Legislative Council in Lorimier division. Bureau was active in promoting the abolition of seigneurial tenure in Canada East. He was named provincial secretary in 1863, a cabinet post; as a result, he had to run again (successfully) for his seat in the legislative council. After Confederation, he was named to the Senate. He died at Saint-R\u00e9mi in 1883. ==References== * * * The Canadian parliamentary companion, HJ Morgan (1874) ==External links== * Category:1820 births Category:1883 deaths Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada Category:Members of the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada Category:Canadian senators from Quebec ",
