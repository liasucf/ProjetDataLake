    "text": "St Ann's Hospice is a charity based in Cheadle established in 1971 providing palliative care. It was initially established on the initiative of Dr Moya Cole, from the Christie Hospital. It now runs three centres: The Neil Cliffe Centre at University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, St Ann's Hospice Heald Green and St Ann's Hospice Little Hulton. Like most hospices in the UK it is largely funded by voluntary donations. About a third of its funding is provided by the NHS, so the organisation has to raise around \u00a320,000 a day to keep the hospice open. Mark Hunter MP took the decision in March 2015 to devolve NHS funding to Greater Manchester as a chance to make end of life care more integrated and hospices to be better supported financially. The organisation abandoned the national NHS payscales in 2014 and set up its own. ==References== ==External links== * *The Neil Cliffe Centre Category:Hospices in England Category:Health in Greater Manchester Category:1971 establishments in England ",
