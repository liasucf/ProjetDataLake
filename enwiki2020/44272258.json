    "text": "The Orleans Forest is the largest national forest in France. A national forest () is a forest that is owned by the French state. This status originates with the Edict of Moulins of 1566. French national forests are managed by the National Board of Forestry (NFB) under the national forestry law, the successor of ordinances and regulations that have taken place since the time of Charlemagne \"at the discretion of political, economic and demographic context of France, making the first state-owned natural forest areas whose management is rigorously controlled\". == Legal status == National forests have existed in some form since ancient times: in fact state ownership is a legal system distinct from inheritance and private property that dates back to the Edict of Moulins (1566). Thus, a number of royal forests are the \"property\" of the state, which has delegated the management of the Ministry of Agriculture who has himself told NFB and sometimes about national parks. or the abusus, the public domain is inalienable. === Disposition of National Forests === ==== Before 2006 ==== Prior to 2006, Article L. 62 in French national code stated: This article therefore specified that forests can be sold by decree or order in France) (\"ordinary form\"), of woods of less than 150 hectare, at least from other large forests. ==== The 2006 reform ==== In 2006, an ordonnance which codifies the legislative part of the general code of the property of public persons; former Article L. 62 was renumbered Article L. 3211-5 of the CGPPP. But the renumbering was accompanied by a significant change. The new Article L. 3211-5 provides: == Management of National Forests == Under the Forest Code, the National Forests Office (NFB) manages state forests. Management is made under a contract of objectives and performance between the state and the NFB, which organizes details of national forest policy. Following the Grenelle Environment a dual general purpose is to Produce more wood, while better preserving the biodiversity.. This sentence does not apply to the management of national forests, but to objective of sable harvesting. Each forest has a forest management (plan) written for a period of 15\u201325 years and approved by the Minister of Agriculture. This arrangement establishes guidelines and management plans cuts during the period. Revenues from state-owned forests are used for operation of the NFB, which manages both profitable forests and unprofitable forests (especially in the mountains or in Provence). The potential benefit of the NFB could return to the state. == Origin and area == In France there are approximately 1,300 National Forests for a combined forest area of about 1,800,000 hectare. 690,000 hectare were originally royal forests; 340,000 hectare are former abbey forests confiscated by the State during the Revolution; 65,000 hectare are forested dunes under the order of February 5, 1817; 390,000 hectare consists of eroding land acquired under the land restoration mountain; 200,000 hectare acquired from private forests since 1914.NFB Newsletter No. 34, April 1975 === Origin of Royal Forests === * Royal properties since time immemorial.
