    "text": "The Night Owls (also known as the \"Owls\") is the oldest continuous all-female a cappella group in the United States and are Vassar College's oldest a cappella group. The Night Owls are an all-female jazz a cappella group that performs a range of music from jazz standards to current pop hits to indie- folk music. == History == The Night Owls always perform dressed in all-black to respect the tradition of the group's founding. In the midst of the polio epidemic of 1942, sixteen intrepid female students escaped from their quarantined dorms late one night and snuck into the library basement. There they sang and serenaded sick classmates with their dulcet tones.http://vsa.vassar.edu/orgs/nightowls == Performance History == The group performs many times throughout Vassar's academic year including at final concerts in December and May, local fundraisers, joint concerts with other Vassar and non-Vassar a cappella groups, and Vassar events. More information about gigs can be found on their website and Facebook page. In 1996 The Night Owls performed as the opening act for Hillary Clinton when she spoke at Vassar College. Following that performance the group was invited to sing at the inauguration of the 42nd President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton, in January 1997. That same year, The Night Owls competed in the semi- finals of the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) at Haverford College. While they did not move onto the finals at Lincoln Center in New York City, then musical director Amanda Weeden \u201897 won \u201cBest Soloist\u201d for her performance of Captain and Tennille\u2019s \u201cLove Will Keep Us Together,\u201d beating out the University of Pennsylvania Counterparts John Stephens, better known today as EGOT winner John Legend. == Discography == * On The Air (1995) * After Dark (1997) * All-Nighter * Relax * Constellation ==Current members== *Emma Robinson (Sop. 2) '20 *Lindsey Sample (Alto) '20 *Ariana Smith (Alto) '20 *Sabrina Stacks (Sop. 2) '20 *Alexa Elias (Sop. 1) '21 *Helen Johnson (Bass) '21 *Maisha Lakri (Alto) '21 *Elena Rey (Bass) '21 *Delila Ames (Sop. 2) '22 *Alexandra Ashworth (Alto) '22 *Tessa Hyatt (Sop. 1) '22 *Gracie Nayman (Bass) '22 *Eloise Allen-Bowton (Sop. 2) '23 *Madison Maiella (Sop. 1) '23 *Cameron Saltsman (Bass) '23 *Maya Wilson (Sop. 1) '23 ==Past Members Include== * Meryl Streep \u201871 * Jacqui Anders (Sop. 1) '19 * Zo\u00eb Bracken (Alto) '19 * Haley Cubell (Bass) '19 * Olivia Lederman (Sop. 1) '19 * Alyssa Vilela (Sop. 2) '19 * Bailey Kenny (Sop. 2) '18 * Lily Kitfield (Bass) '18 * Chiara Mannarino (Bass) '18 * Imani Russel (Alto) '18 * Brianna Lear (Alto) '17 * Hildegard Wulf (Sop. 1) '17 * Cyndi Bonacum (Sop. 1) '16 * Brielle Brook (Sop. 2) '16 * Alex Moulton (Alto) '16 * Aubrey Hays (Sop. 1) \u201815 * Taylor Dalton (Bass) \u201815 * Akaina Ghosh (Alto) \u201815 * Madison Wetzell (Alto) \u201815 * Yamilette Suanny Vizcaino (Sop. 1) \u201815 * Anna Been (Alto) '14 * Charlotte Candau (Sop. 2) '14 * Hannah Ellman (Bass) '14 * Emily Nash (Sop. 2) \u201813 * * Eliza Ruth Watson (Sop. 1) '05 * Anne Harris (Bass) \u201899 * Laurie Pessah (Sop. 2) \u201899 * Carolyn Schneyer (Alto) \u201898 * Samantha Beadel (Sop. 1) \u201898 * Mikie Benedict (Sop. 2) \u201897 * Amanda Weeden (Alto) \u201897 * Jeslyn Kelly (Sop. 1) \u201897 * Emily Wolper (Sop. 1) \u201897 * Chelsea Dolinar-Hikawa (Sop. 2) \u201897 * Meribeth Nishan (Alto) \u201897 * Brook Moshan (Sop. 2) \u201896 * Alicia Cervini (Alto) \u201896 * Yasmina Zaidman (Alto) \u201896 * Suzanne Hamill (Alto/Sop. 2) \u201892 ==Current Arrangements (Covers)== # Back Pocket Vulfpeck # Back to Black Amy Winehouse # Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen The Andrews Sisters # Beyond the Sea Bobby Darin # Billy-A-Dick Bette Midler # Body Sinead Harnett # Bring on the Men Jekyll & Hyde (musical) # A Case of You Joni Mitchell # Crazy In Love Beyonc\u00e9 # Don't Think Twice, It's All Right Bob Dylan # Dream a Little Dream of Me # Helplessly Hoping Crosby, Stills & Nash # Hit the Road Jack Ray Charles # Hotel Song Regina Spektor # I Get a Kick Out of You Cole Porter # I Need a Man to Love Janis Joplin # Landslide Fleetwood Mac # Love Will Keep Us Together Captain & Tennille # Me and Mrs. Jones Billy Paul # Moon River # Moondance Van Morrison # Night and Day Cole Porter # Plain Gold Ring Kimbra # Runaround Sue Dion DiMucci # Runnin' Wild (1922 song) # Saving Ourselves for Yale # See Saw Aretha Franklin # Sexy Silk Jessie J # Skyfall Adele # Sleepwalker Emily King # Stop Your Crying Lake Street Dive # Sweet Dreams Joseph (band) # That Lonesome Road James Taylor # Tracks of My Tears The Miracles # Trickle, Trickle The Videos (Musical group) # Unchain My Heart Ray Charles # Up The Ladder to the Roof The Supremes # Wildewoman Lucius (band) # You Don't Own Me Lesley Gore http://www.allmusic.com/artist/night-owls-mn0000273470/biography http://taybandz.org/tunes-for-tay-at-vassar-college/ http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/vassar- college-2895 http://www.nightowlsacappella.zoomshare.com ==References== 12\\. ^ https://varsityvocals.com/results-page/?fwp_year=1997 ==External links== *https://twitter.com/vassarnightowls *https://www.youtube.com/user/vassarnightowls Category:Vassar College Category:Collegiate a cappella groups ",
