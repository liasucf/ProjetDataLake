    "text": "Myles Alan Boddington (30 November 1924 - 14 February 2002) was an English first-class cricketer, noted racehorse breeder and president of the English Golf Union. The son of the first-class cricketer Robert Boddington and his wife Constance Mary Cornall, he was born at Hale, Cheshire. He was educated at Rugby School, where he played cricket for the school cricket team and was regarded as a \"a fast bowler of height and hostility\". He played for the school in their centenary match in 1941 against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), marking a hundred years since the MCC played a Rugby School side captained by Thomas Hughes. After leaving Rubgy School, Boddington briefly served in the Royal Air Force, during which he played for the Royal Air Force cricket team in a first-class cricket match against Worcestershire at Worcester in 1946. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed without scoring in the Royal Air Force first-innings, while in their second-innings he was dismissed for 23 runs by Peter Jackson. Despite interest in this match surrounding his bowling, he was only able to bowl three overs before pulling up injured. Three years later, he married Joan Dorothy Johnson, with the couple having three children. He later moved to Burford in Oxfordshire, where he owned a farm on which he bred pigs and race horses. He was an amateur golfer of some repute. He held several administrative positions, including as president of the English Golf Union. He owned several racehorses that took part in National Hunt racing. He died at Burford in February 2002. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1924 births Category:2002 deaths Category:People from Hale, Greater Manchester Category:People educated at Rugby School Category:Royal Air Force airmen Category:English cricketers Category:Royal Air Force cricketers Category:English farmers Category:British racehorse owners and breeders Category:Golf administrators ",
