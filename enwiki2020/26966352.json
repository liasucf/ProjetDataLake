Bonnet had previously represented France in the 1970 contest in Amsterdam. ==Before Eurovision== === National final === Broadcaster Antenne 2 took over responsibility for French Eurovision participation in 1983, after the country had been absent from the 1982 contest when previous broadcaster TF1 opted out, citing the facile nature of the music on offer in Eurovision as they perceived it. Antenne 2 decided to choose their first entry via a broadcast national final. The national final was held on 20 March 1983, hosted by Jean-Pierre Foucault and 1977 contest winner Marie Myriam. Fourteen songs took part with the winner chosen by a panel of TV viewers who were telephoned and asked to vote on the songs. Other participants included previous and future French representatives Isabelle Aubret (1962 & 1968) and Jo\u00ebl Pr\u00e9vost (1978).ESC National Finals database 1983 {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !
