    "text": "Chapman codes are a set of 3-letter codes used in genealogy to identify the administrative divisions in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. ==Use== They were created by the historian, Dr. Colin R Chapman, in the late 1970s, and as intended, provide a widely used shorthand in genealogy which follows the common practice of describing areas in terms of the counties existing in the 19th and 20th centuries. ==Other uses== Chapman codes have no mapping, postal or administrative use. They can however be useful for disambiguation by postal services where a full county name or traditional abbreviation is not supplied after a place name which has more than one occurrence, a particular problem where these are post towns such as Richmond. ==Country codes== *CHI Channel Islands *ENG England *IOM Isle of Man *IRL Ireland *NIR Northern Ireland *SCT Scotland *WLS Wales *ALL All countries ==Channel Islands== *ALD Alderney *GSY Guernsey *JSY Jersey *SRK Sark ==England== ===Ancient counties=== *BDF Bedfordshire *BRK Berkshire *BKM Buckinghamshire *CAM Cambridgeshire *CHS Cheshire *CON Cornwall *CUL Cumberland *DBY Derbyshire *DEV Devonshire *DOR Dorset *DUR Durham *ESS Essex *GLS Gloucestershire *HAM Hampshire *HEF Herefordshire *HRT Hertfordshire *HUN Huntingdonshire *KEN Kent *LAN Lancashire *LEI Leicestershire *LIN Lincolnshire *MDX Middlesex *NFK Norfolk *NTH Northamptonshire *NBL Northumberland *NTT Nottinghamshire *OXF Oxfordshire *RUT Rutland *SAL Shropshire (Salop) *SOM Somerset *STS Staffordshire *SFK Suffolk *SRY Surrey *SSX Sussex *WAR Warwickshire *WES Westmorland *WIL Wiltshire *WOR Worcestershire *YKS Yorkshire **ERY East Riding **NRY North Riding **WRY West Riding ===Administrative areas=== *AVN Avon *CLV Cleveland *CMA Cumbria *SXE East Sussex *GTM Greater Manchester *HWR Hereford and Worcester *HUM Humberside *IOW Isle of Wight *LND London *MSY Merseyside *WMD West Midlands *NYK North Yorkshire *SYK South Yorkshire *TWR Tyne and Wear *SXW West Sussex *WYK West Yorkshire ==Scotland== ===Ancient counties=== *ABD Aberdeenshire *ANS Angus (formerly Forfarshire) *ARL Argyll (Argyllshire) *AYR Ayrshire *BAN Banffshire *BEW Berwickshire *BUT Bute (Buteshire) *CAI Caithness *CLK Clackmannanshire *DFS Dumfriesshire *DNB Dunbartonshire *ELN East Lothian (formerly Haddingtonshire) *FIF Fife *INV Inverness-shire *KCD Kincardineshire *KRS Kinross-shire *KKD Kirkcudbrightshire *LKS Lanarkshire *MLN Midlothian (formerly Edinburghshire) *MOR Moray (formerly Elginshire) *NAI Nairnshire *OKI Orkney *PEE Peeblesshire *PER Perthshire *RFW Renfrewshire *ROC Ross and Cromarty *ROX Roxburghshire *SEL Selkirkshire *SHI Shetland *STI Stirlingshire *SUT Sutherland *WLN West Lothian (formerly Linlithgowshire) *WIG Wigtownshire ===1975\u20131996 regions=== *BOR Borders *CEN Central *DGY Dumfries and Galloway *FIF Fife *GMP Grampian *HLD Highland *LTN Lothian *OKI Orkney Isles *SHI Shetland Isles *STD Strathclyde *TAY Tayside *WIS Western Isles ==Wales== ===Historic counties=== *AGY Anglesey *BRE Brecknockshire *CAE Caernarfonshire *CGN Cardiganshire *CMN Carmarthenshire *DEN Denbighshire *FLN Flintshire *GLA Glamorgan *MER Merionethshire *MON Monmouthshire *MGY Montgomeryshire *PEM Pembrokeshire *RAD Radnorshire ===1974\u20131996=== *CWD Clwyd *DFD Dyfed *GNT Gwent *GWN Gwynedd *MGM Mid Glamorgan *POW Powys *SGM South Glamorgan *WGM West Glamorgan ==Ireland== *ANT Antrim *ARM Armagh *CAR Carlow *CAV Cavan *CLA Clare *COR Cork *DON Donegal *DOW Down *DUB Dublin *FER Fermanagh *GAL Galway *KER Kerry *KID Kildare *KIK Kilkenny *LET Leitrim *LEX Leix (formerly Queen's) *LIM Limerick *LDY Londonderry *LOG Longford *LOU Louth *MAY Mayo *MEA Meath *MOG Monaghan *OFF Offaly (formerly King's) *ROS Roscommon *SLI Sligo *TIP Tipperary *TYR Tyrone *WAT Waterford *WEM Westmeath *WEX Wexford *WIC Wicklow ==References== * The Chapman County Code for British Isles Counties, Lochin Publishing, accessed 13 October 2019 Category:Geocodes Category:British genealogy Category:Irish genealogy ",
