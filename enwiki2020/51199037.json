She was a global co- ordinator of the Ancient Skies project, along with Ruediger Schulz. The project began in 2006 aiming to create a knowledge base of human cultures and their knowledge of astronomy, with the vision \"One Planet \u2013 One Mankind \u2013 One Sky \u2013 One Knowledgebase\", and is \"currently transferring the complete project to a new environment\". In February 2016 she appeared on BBC Radio 4's The Museum of Curiosity. Her hypothetical donation to this imaginary museum was a star clock. ==Publications== * ==References== ==External links== * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Archaeoastronomers Category:Women astronomers Category:Austrian women scientists ",
