(1918\u20131921): * Krak\u00f3w Military District (Krakowski Okr\u0119g Wojskowy), HQ in Krak\u00f3w * \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Military District (\u0141\u00f3dzki Okr\u0119g Wojskowy), HQ in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a * Lublin Military District (Lubelski Okr\u0119g Wojskowy), HQ in Lublin. * Pozna\u0144 Military District (Pozna\u0144ski Okr\u0119g Wojskowy), HQ in Pozna\u0144 * Warsaw Military District (Warszawski Okr\u0119g Wojskowy), HQ in Warszawa. In 1921, due to reorganization, the military districts were replaced with Dow\u00f3dztwo Okr\u0119gu Korpusu (DOK \u2013 Corps District Command). In the Second Polish Republic there were ten DOK's: * I \u2013 Warszawa * II \u2013 Lublin * III \u2013 Grodno * IV \u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a * V \u2013 Krak\u00f3w * VI \u2013 Lw\u00f3w * VII \u2013 Pozna\u0144 * VIII \u2013 Toru\u0144 * IX \u2013 Brze\u015b\u0107 nad Bugiem * X \u2013 Przemy\u015bl Each DOK consisted of four large units (three infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade).
