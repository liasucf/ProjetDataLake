    "text": "Voices (Icelandic: R\u00f6ddin) is a 2006 translation of a 2003 crime novel by Icelandic author Arnaldur Indri\u00f0ason, in his Detective Erlendur series. It was first published in English in August 2006. The Swedish translation of the novel (\u00c4nglar\u00f6sten) won Sweden's Martin Beck Award for the best crime novel in translation. An old hotel doorman, preparing to dress up as Father Christmas, is found stabbed to death in a compromising position in his miserable small room. Detective Erlendur, who hits a wall of disinterest while trying to find answers, books a room in the hotel. The more he discovers of the past of the deceased, and the more demimonde figures he meets in that allegedly decent hotel, the more phantoms he reveals from his own past. ==References== Category:2003 novels Category:Christmas novels Category:Icelandic novels Category:Novels by Arnaldur Indri\u00f0ason Category:Novels set in hotels Category:Grand Prix de Litt\u00e9rature Polici\u00e8re winners pl:G\u0142os (powie\u015b\u0107) ",
