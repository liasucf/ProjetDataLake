In 2015, she placed second on the WWE competition Tough Enough, after which she signed a contract with WWE and joined the reality television show Total Divas as a main cast member for one season. After a brief stint in WWE's then-developmental territory, NXT, Rose made her main roster debut in 2017. She then competed alongside Sonya Deville as a tag team, dubbed Fire and Desire. ==Early life== Amanda Rose Saccomanno was born in the New York City suburb of Westchester County, New York.

She was also crowned the 2014 World Beauty Fitness & Fashion Bikini Champion. ==Professional wrestling career== Rose at WrestleMania Axxess in April 2016 ===WWE=== ====Tough Enough and NXT (2015\u20132017)==== Saccomanno was a contestant in the sixth season of the WWE competition WWE Tough Enough, which began airing in June 2015. She was at risk of elimination on the July 28 episode, but was saved by judge The Miz. During the season finale, she adopted the ring name Mandy Rose, lost a match against Alicia Fox, and placed second overall, after winners Sara Lee and Josh Bredl. After the Tough Enough season finale, it was revealed that Rose had signed a five-year contract with the company.

A week later, the trio's name was revealed as Absolution. Rose had her first televised match on the main roster at Tribute to the Troops on December 19, where Absolution defeated Bayley, James, and Banks. On January 28, 2018 at the Royal Rumble, Rose entered the first women's Royal Rumble match at number 4, and she was the first woman eliminated from the match by Lita. In February, Rose took part of the inaugural women's Elimination Chamber match, which was won by Bliss. In April, Paige retired from the ring due to neck injuries and became the SmackDown general manager. In her first WrestleMania appearance, at WrestleMania 34, Rose participated in the WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal, which would be won by Naomi. Both Rose and Deville were drafted to SmackDown during the 2018 Superstar Shake-up, with Paige subsequently declaring that Absolution was over. Despite this, Rose would continue competing in various tag team matches alongside Deville. Seeds of dissolution between the two were planted when Rose eliminated Deville from a battle royal at the inaugural all women's pay-per-view, Evolution. At Survivor Series in November, Rose competed in her first traditional five-on-five elimination match as part of Team SmackDown in a losing effort. Rose later feuded with Naomi after she flirted with Naomi's husband, Jimmy Uso, to \"ruin Naomi's life\", which also involved Rose hinting at kissing Uso as well as Naomi attacking Rose in a hotel room to which Rose invited Uso. The rivalry continued as both Rose and Naomi eliminated each other from the women's Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble event, on January 27, 2019, where Rose managed to last 25:50. The two exchanged victories over each other in February. On February 17, at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, Rose and Deville competed in a six-team Elimination Chamber match for the inaugural WWE Women's Tag Team Championship, where they started the match against and were then the final team eliminated by Sasha Banks and Bayley, who won the match in the process. Rose then competed in the second WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal during the WrestleMania 35 pre-show in a losing effort. Rose then competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at the namesake pay-per-view on May 19. Deville, who was ringside during the match, tried to climb the ladder and help Rose win the match, however, Bayley was able to fight them off and retrieve the briefcase. On the September 3 episode of SmackDown, Rose and Deville, now dubbed Fire & Desire, defeated Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross to earn a Women's Tag Team Championship shot at Clash of Champions. At the event, the two failed to capture the title. ====Romance storyline and singles competition (2019\u2013present)==== In December 2019, Rose entered a romance storyline with Otis, with Otis helping Rose during her matches. She later agreed to a date with him on Valentine's Day, but Dolph Ziggler appeared in Otis's place during the date, which resulted in a romance between Rose and Ziggler. The storyline then evolved into a love triangle involving a feud between Otis and Ziggler over Rose. It was revealed on the April 3, 2020 episode of SmackDown that Deville was working with Ziggler to keep Otis from Rose. On April 5 at WrestleMania 36, Rose interfered during a match between Otis and Ziggler by attacking Deville, who was at ringside, and Ziggler, which helped Otis score the victory. Following the match, she and Otis shared a kiss. On the May 22 episode of SmackDown, she and Otis lost to Deville and Ziggler in a tag team match. On July 31, Rose's hair was cut by Deville during a backstage attack, which led to Rose debuting a new look with shorter hair the following week. That same month, she defeated Deville in a Loser Leaves WWE match at SummerSlam. Rose was traded to the Raw brand on September 12 with the storyline reason being that The Miz was behind this trade as part of his on going storyline with Otis. Rose would then form a tag team with Dana Brooke (who was also traded to Raw) on the September 28 episode of Raw where they defeated Natalya and Lana. ==Other media== Rose has been featured in multiple fitness publications including Fitness Gurls, Fit & Firm, and FitFemme.
