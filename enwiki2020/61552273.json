Administratively it is part of the NE Greenland National Park. ==History== This headland was named \"Cape Simpson\" in 1822 by William Scoresby (1789 \u2013 1857).Place names, NE Greenland Numerous remains of former Inuit habitation were found at that time in the area near the cape.William Scoresby, Journal of a Voyage to the Northern Whale-Fishery. Including Researches and Discoveries on the Eastern Coast of West Greenland, p. 253-267 Materials for a Norwegian hunting station known as \"Simpson Stranda\" were brought to the area of the headland by Norwegian ship Veslekari in 1929, but the hut was never built. Another hut, \"Kap Simpson Hytte\", was built by the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol between 1955 and 1956. ==Geography== Cape Simpson is located in the Greenland Sea, north of Cape Biot on the opposite side of the mouth of Davy Sound. Cape Simpson rises at the southeastern end of Traill Island, whose shore trending northwest of the cape forms the northeastern coast of Davy Sound. It is a conspicuous headland. The Vandyke Cliffs, steep and displaying multicolored strata, rise above the cape at a sheer angle right from the shore. Dream Bay (Dr\u00f8mmebugten) is located about WNW of the headland and larger Mountnorris Fjord to the northeast. Most of the years the sea around the cape is filled with ice, even in the summer.Prostar Sailing Directions 2005 Greenland and Iceland Enroute, p. 118 {| |- valign=\"top\" |Map of NE Greenland and Iceland. |} ==Bibliography== * ==See also== *Geography of Greenland ==References== ==External links== * Greenland Pilot - Danish Geodata Agency Category:Headlands of Greenland ceb:Kap Simpson sv:Kap Simpson ",
