    "text": "Clear Air Turbulence is the second studio album by British jazz rock band Ian Gillan Band, released in 1977 with cover by Chris Foss. The album was initially worked on during the period July 1976 to September 1976. A UK tour was promoted, though all of the dates were cancelled until April 1977 in order that the new album could be rerecorded and remixed at Kingsway Recorders, London. The album was reissued in 1989 by Virgin Records on CD, and in 2010 by Edsel Records. == The Rockfield Mixes == Ian Gillan became dissatisfied with the final mixes of the album and this delayed its eventual release. What eventually became the album Clear Air Turbulence was remixed at Kingsway before release, but the original mix had taken place at Rockfield Studios in Wales. In 1997 the original mix was released by Angel Air Records under the title The Rockfield Mixes and represents a \"cleaner\" (or at least earlier) version of the album. It also includes an extra track which didn't make it to the original release. The track list was altered as follows: # \"Over the Hill\" \u2013 7:20 # \"Clear Air Turbulence\" \u2013 7:47 # \"Five Moons\" \u2013 7:34 # \"Money Lender\" \u2013 5:40 # \"Angel Manchenio\" \u2013 7:21 # \"This Is the Way\" \u2013 2:03 # \"Goodhand Liza\" \u2013 5:20 The 2004 release of the original mix == The Rockfield Mixes Plus == In 2004 a further variant of the album was released as The Rockfield Mixes Plus containing four previously unreleased tracks and an interview with Ray Fenwick. The extra tracks were: * \"Apathy\" (backing track) \u2013 4:14 * \"Over the Hill\" (live) \u2013 9:50 * \"Smoke on the Water\" (live) \u2013 7:38 * \"Mercury High\" (backing track) \u2013 3:33 == Track listing == * All tracks written by Ray Fenwick, Ian Gillan, John Gustafson, Mark Nauseef, Colin Towns.
