    "text": "Luciano Gast\u00f3n Pizarro (born 14 July 1997) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Godoy Cruz. ==Career== Pizarro joined Godoy Cruz as a youngster in 2005. He was promoted into the club's senior squad in April 2017. His debut arrived on 8 April during a defeat to Col\u00f3n, which was one of four appearances in April including his first in continental competition as he played the final eighteen minutes in a Copa Libertadores win over Sport Boys of Bolivia on 20 April. In the following June, Pizarro scored his first professional goal during a 3\u20130 victory in the Copa Argentina over Santamarina. Just two more appearances arrived in the following three years, mostly due to a number of serious injuries. ==Personal life== In July 2019, Pizarro was detained and charged with aggravated manslaughter after he was involved in a traffic incident which ended the life of a seventeen-year-old girl named Luna Celeste Cangemi. He failed a breathalyzer test, though details became muddled when it was claimed Pizarro wasn't the driver, instead his girlfriend was, and the motorcycle, which was carrying three people, was speeding and the occupants weren't wearing helmets. He remained in custody for three days, before paying a bond to be released on bail; paid after a relative put a house up to cover the $1,000,000 pesos. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Godoy Cruz |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"4\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |5||0||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1Appearance(s) in the Copa Libertadores||0||0||0||7||1 |- |2017\u201318 |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2018\u201319 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2019\u201320 |1||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !7!!0!!2!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!1!!0!!0!!0!!10!!1 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:People from Mendoza Province Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Godoy Cruz footballers ",
