    "text": "Bicorn In geometry, the bicorn, also known as a cocked hat curve due to its resemblance to a bicorne, is a rational quartic curve defined by the equation :y^2(a^2-x^2)=(x^2+2ay-a^2)^2. It has two cusps and is symmetric about the y-axis. ==History== In 1864, James Joseph Sylvester studied the curve :y^4-xy^3-8xy^2+36x^2y+16x^2-27x^3=0 in connection with the classification of quintic equations; he named the curve a bicorn because it has two cusps. This curve was further studied by Arthur Cayley in 1867. ==Properties== A transformed bicorn with a = 1 The bicorn is a plane algebraic curve of degree four and genus zero. It has two cusp singularities in the real plane, and a double point in the complex projective plane at x=0, z=0 . If we move x=0 and z=0 to the origin substituting and perform an imaginary rotation on x bu substituting ix/z for x and 1/z for y in the bicorn curve, we obtain :(x^2-2az+a^2z^2)^2 = x^2+a^2z^2.\\, This curve, a lima\u00e7on, has an ordinary double point at the origin, and two nodes in the complex plane, at x = \u00b1 i and z=1. The parametric equations of a bicorn curve are: x = a \\sin(\\theta) and y = a \\frac{\\cos^2(\\theta) \\left(2+\\cos(\\theta)\\right)}{3+\\sin^2(\\theta)} with -\\pi\\le\\theta\\le\\pi ==See also== * List of curves ==References== ==External links== * Category:Curves Category:Algebraic curves ",
