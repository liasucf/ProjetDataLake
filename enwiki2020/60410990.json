    "text": "\"Unbearably White\" is a song by American indie pop band Vampire Weekend. It was released on April 4, 2019 by Columbia Records as a double A-side with \"This Life\", and the third single from their album Father of the Bride. ==Background== Discussing the track with The Sunday Times before its release, Koenig commented that \"infighting among white people about who is marginally more or less white is not particularly interesting\", and that the song partially explores that. The phrase \"unbearably white\" had previously been used as a criticism of the band, in reference to their race. ==Composition== The art pop song develops and shifts between isolated vocals, handbells, jazz fusion-inspired bass guitar, and orchestral swells, and lyrically explores a failing relationship. The track's title has been described as a \"prank\", as the song does not discuss Koenig's racial identity. ==Critical reception== For Pitchfork, Sheldon Pearce described the song as \"gorgeous\", concluding that \"as the [song's] characters seek salvation from a bitter coldness, Vampire Weekend find a spark\". ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Father of the Bride's liner notes. * Ariel Rechtshaid \u2013 engineering, mixing * Chris Kasych \u2013 engineering * John DeBold \u2013 engineering * Hiroya Takayama \u2013 engineering * Takemasa Kosaka \u2013 engineering * Emily Lazar \u2013 mastering * Chris Allgood \u2013 mastering assistance ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ==References== Category:2019 songs Category:2019 singles Category:Vampire Weekend songs Category:Art pop songs Category:Songs written by Ezra Koenig Category:Song recordings produced by Ariel Rechtshaid Category:Song recordings produced by BloodPop Category:Columbia Records singles ",
