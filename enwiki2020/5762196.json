    "text": "Bokes Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of Ohio. It is a tributary of the Scioto River. Bokes Creek is named after Arthur Boke who was a hunter, scout and friend to surveyor Lucas Sullivant, the man who surveyed the area of Darby Creek and Bokes Creek. According to folk etymology, Bokes Creek derives its name from a Native American word meaning \"lost\", the creek being so named after an Indian lost his life in the creek. Another source maintains Boke was the name of an Indian chief. ==Location== *Mouth: Confluence with the Scioto River west of Delaware *Origin: Logan County east of Rushsylvania ==See also== *List of rivers of Ohio ==References== Category:Rivers of Delaware County, Ohio Category:Rivers of Logan County, Ohio Category:Rivers of Union County, Ohio Category:Rivers of Ohio ",
