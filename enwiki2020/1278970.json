    "text": "The Professional Footballers' Association Young Player of the Year (often called the PFA Young Player of the Year, or simply the Young Player of the Year) is an annual award given to the player aged 23 or under at the start of the season who is adjudged to have been the best of the season in English football. The award has been presented since the 1973\u201374 season and the winner is chosen by a vote amongst the members of the players' trade union, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA). The first winner of the award was Ipswich Town defender Kevin Beattie. The current holder is Trent Alexander- Arnold, who won the award on 8 September 2020. Although the award is open to players at all levels, all winners to date have played in the highest division of the English football league system. As of 2017, only Ryan Giggs, Robbie Fowler, Wayne Rooney and Dele Alli have won the award on more than one occasion. Only seven players from outside the United Kingdom have won the trophy,The total of seven includes Cyrille Regis, who was born in French Guiana but represented England at international level. compared with fifteen winners of the main PFA Players' Player of the Year award. Although they have their own dedicated award, players aged 23 or under at the start of the season remain eligible to win the Players' Player of the Year award, and on three occasions the same player has won both awards for a season. In 2018 Ryan Sessegnon of Fulham became the first player from outside the top division of English football to be nominated for the award. A shortlist of nominees is published in April and the winner of the award, along with the winners of the PFA's other annual awards, is announced at a gala event in London a few days later. The players themselves consider the award to be highly prestigious, because the winner is chosen by his fellow professionals. ==Winners== The award has been presented on 47 occasions as of 2020, to 43 players. The table also indicates where the winning player also won one or more of the other major \"player of the year\" awards in English football, namely the PFA Players' Player of the Year award (PPY), the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award (FWA), the Premier League Player of the Season award (PPS), and the PFA Fans' Player of the Year award (FPY). Ryan Giggs was the first player to win the award twice. Robbie Fowler was the second two-time winner. Steven Gerrard was the first player to win the Fans' Player of the Year award in the same season Wayne Rooney was the third player to win the award in two consecutive seasons. {|class=\"sortable
