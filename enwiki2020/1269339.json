    "text": "The 1995\u201396 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the fourth season of the competition, since its formation in 1992. Due to the decision to reduce the number of clubs in the Premier League from 22 to 20, only two clubs were promoted instead of the usual three, Middlesbrough and Bolton Wanderers.England 1994/95 Manchester United won the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Champions League, while Arsenal, Aston Villa, and Newcastle United qualified for the UEFA Cup. Liverpool also qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup as runners-up of the FA Cup which was won by Manchester United. ==Summary== Liverpool and Aston Villa emerged as possible title contenders early in the season, while Middlesbrough's early promise saw them occupy fourth place in late October, but an injury crisis saw their league form slump, and they could only manage a 12th-place finish. Most of the campaign was a two-horse race between Manchester United and Newcastle United. The two sides played on 27 December, with Newcastle 10 points ahead in the league. A 2\u20130 home win for Manchester United cut the gap to seven points, and two days later they beat Queens Park Rangers 2\u20131 to reduce the gap to just four points. But a 4\u20131 defeat at Tottenham on New Year's Day and a 0\u20130 draw with Aston Villa allowed Newcastle to establish a 12-point lead in January. Manchester United and Newcastle met again in early March, and a goal by Eric Cantona gave Manchester United a 1\u20130 away win and cut the gap to a single point. With one game left of the season, Manchester United led the Premier League by two points, having taken lead of the league halfway through March and stayed on top ever since. In case of the two clubs being tied for first place, the Premier League made preliminary preparations for a championship play-off match at Wembley. For Newcastle to win their first title since 1927, they had to win against Tottenham and hope that Middlesbrough beat their Mancunian rivals. But the Premier League title went to Old Trafford as Manchester United won 3\u20130 and Newcastle could only manage a 1\u20131 draw with Tottenham. Despite the arrival of Dennis Bergkamp, Arsenal never looked like serious title challengers, their best chance of success coming in the League Cup, where they reached the semi-finals, losing on away goals to Aston Villa. However, the North London side still qualified for the UEFA Cup by finishing fifth. Title holders Blackburn recorded the lowest ever finish by a Premier League title-holder by finishing 7th. This record was matched by Manchester United in 2013\u201314 and broken by Chelsea in 2015\u201316 and again by Leicester City in 2016\u201317. Six days after clinching their third league title in four seasons, Manchester United became the first team to complete a second league championship and FA Cup double when a Cantona goal gave them a 1\u20130 win over Liverpool in the FA Cup final.England \u2013 FA Challenge Cup 1995\u20131996 The Premier League relegation places went to Bolton, Queens Park Rangers and Manchester City. Bolton had spent a large proportion of their first Premier League season bottom of the table. Manchester City failed to beat Liverpool on the final day of the season, consigning them to the final relegation place on goal difference behind Southampton and Coventry City. ===English performance in European competition=== Blackburn Rovers, the 1994\u201395 Premier League champions, finished bottom of their group in the UEFA Champions League.European Competitions 1995\u201396 Manchester United were knocked out of the UEFA Cup in the first round, with Liverpool and Leeds United both being knocked out at the second round.European Competitions 1995\u201396 Everton were beaten in the second round of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.European Competitions 1995\u201396 The only English team still in European competition after Christmas were Nottingham Forest, who reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. ==Teams== Twenty teams competed in the league \u2013 the top eighteen teams from the previous season and the two teams promoted from the First Division.
