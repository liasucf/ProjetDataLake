    "text": "Henryk Iwa\u0144ski (1902-1978), nom de guerre Bystry, was a member of the Polish resistance during World War II. He is known for leading one of the most daring actions of the Armia Krajowa (Home Army) in support of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, however later research cast doubts on the veracity of his claims. For his assistance to the Polish Jews Iwa\u0144ski was bestowed the title of the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Jerusalem in 1964.Henryk Iwa\u0144ski \u2013 his activity to save Jews' lives during the Holocaust, at Yad Vashem website ==Life== Before the Second World War Henryk had reached the rank of captain in the Polish Army. Soon after Nazi Germany invaded Poland and began the Holocaust, Henryk was instrumental in the founding of the \u017bydowski Zwi\u0105zek Wojskowy (Jewish Military Union). Together with the rest of his family he dedicated himself to support the Jews, working through the Polish resistance (Armia Krajowa). Iwa\u0144ski was one of the AK members dealing with the Jews, providing them with arms, ammunition, and instructional materials smuggled through the sewers or in carts that brought lime and cement into the ghetto. \"\u2026heavy casualties were sustained by the ZZW, losing many of its leading fighters. Apfelbaum and Rodal were mortally wounded in fighting that raged on April 27 and 28. Iwanski's brother, Edvard, fell in Muranowska Square, his son, Roman was mortally wounded, and Iwanski himself was wounded during those days.\"Moshe Arens, \"The Changing Face of Memory\u2014Who defended the Warsaw Ghetto?\" Zbigniew, another son of Henryk fought on Karmelicka Street and died on May 3, 1943, escorting a group of Jews out of the ghetto. After being wounded, Iwa\u0144ski was brought from the ghetto, escorted by a group of Polish and Jewish fighters, among them Ber Mark, who later wrote a book about the Uprising. Nonetheless, Iwa\u0144ski returned to the ghetto at least once more, bringing another set of ammunition and supplies. This was one of several actions of the Polish resistance providing assistance to the Jews in the ghetto. Monument to the Ghetto Heroes in Warsaw In 1963, for his actions Iwa\u0144ski was awarded the Silver Cross of Virtuti Militari, one of Poland's highest military decorations for valor. Soon later, in 1964, with his wife Wiktoria he was decorated with the medal of Righteous Among the Nations (awarded only, if there are or were, at the time of the award, Jewish witnesses who survived). == Controversy == Recent questions concerning inconsistencies regarding the nature and extent of Iwanski's support for the Jewish underground have been raised. Examinations of Israeli and Polish archives have brought allegations that Iwanski exaggerated his war time activities, had made anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli radio and television broadcasts, and as an informant of Polish secret police had spied on Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal as an informant against the Jewish Historical Institute .Dariusz Libionka and Laurence Weinbaum.

A Surplus of Memory: Chronicle of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. University of California Press, 1993, pp. 410-12; 415. The Polish-Israeli authors of a 2011 book on the Jewish Military Union (\u017bZW), Dariusz Libionka and Laurence Weinbaum, suggest that Iwa\u0144ski's story of heroism in the ghetto revolt is a fabrication and that he did not even have any male children. They point out that Iwa\u0144ski succeeded in convincing visiting journalists from abroad, most notably Chaja Lazar and Dan Kurzman, of the veracity of his story which is one of the reasons it gained credence and tremendous popularity.Dariusz Libionka & Laurence Weinbaum - Bohaterowie, hochsztaplerzy, opisywacze Wok\u00f3\u0142 \u017bydowskiego Zwi\u0105zku Wojskowego (Warsaw: Stowarzyszenie Centrum Bada\u0144 nad Zag\u0142ad\u0105 \u017byd\u00f3w, 2011) ==See also== * Henryk Woli\u0144ski * List of Poles ==Notes== ==References== * The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation * The Polish Underground State: A Guide to the Underground, 1939-1945\" Stefan Korbonski, pages 120-139 ==Further reading== * See the list in The Bravest Battle: The Twenty-Eight Days of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Google Print, p.352 Category:1902 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Polish resistance members of World War II Category:Polish Righteous Among the Nations ",
