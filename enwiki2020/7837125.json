    "text": "The Honourable Sylvia Wynter, O.J. (Holgu\u00edn, Cuba, 11 May 1928) is a Jamaican novelist,[1] dramatist,[2] critic, philosopher, and essayist.[3] Her work combines insights from the natural sciences, the humanities, art, and anti- colonial struggles in order to unsettle what she refers to as the \"overrepresentation of Man.\" Black studies, economics, history, neuroscience, psychoanalysis, literary analysis, film analysis, and philosophy are some of the fields she draws on in her scholarly work. ==Biography== Sylvia Wynter was born in Cuba to Jamaican parents, actress Lola Maude (Reid) Wynter and tailor Percival Wynter. At the age of two she returned to her home country, Jamaica, with her parents (both born there) and was educated at the St Andrew High School for Girls. In 1946, she was awarded the Jamaica Centenary Scholarship for Girls, which took her to King's College London, to read for her B.A. in modern languages (Spanish) from 1947 to 1951. She was awarded the M.A. in December 1953 for her thesis, a critical edition of a Spanish comedia, A lo que obliga el honor. In 1956, Wynter met the Guyanese novelist Jan Carew, who became her second husband. In 1958, she completed Under the Sun, a full-length stage play, which was bought by the Royal Court Theatre in London. In 1962, Wynter published her only novel, The Hills of Hebron. After separating from Carew in the early 1960s, Wynter returned to academia, and in 1963, was appointed assistant lecturer in Hispanic literature at the Mona campus of the University of the West Indies. She remained there until 1974. During this time the Jamaican government commissioned her to write the play 1865\u2013A Ballad for a Rebellion, about the Morant Bay rebellion, and a biography of Sir Alexander Bustamante, the first prime minister of independent Jamaica. In 1974, Wynter was invited by the Department of Literature at the University of California at San Diego to be a professor of Comparative and Spanish Literature and to lead a new program in Third World literature. She left UCSD in 1977 to become chairperson of African and Afro-American Studies, and professor of Spanish in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Stanford University. She is now Professor Emerita at Stanford University. In the mid- to late-1960s, Wynter began writing critical essays addressing her interests in Caribbean, Latin American, and Spanish history and literatures. In 1968 and 1969 she published a two-part essay proposing to transform scholars' very approach to literary criticism, \"We Must Learn to Sit Down Together and Talk About a Little Culture: Reflections on West Indian Writing and Criticism.\" Wynter has since written numerous essays in which she seeks to rethink the fullness of human ontologies, which, she argues, have been curtailed by what she describes as an over-representation of (western bourgeois) Man as if it/he were the only available mode of complete humanness. She suggests how multiple knowledge sources and texts might frame our worldview differently. In 2010, Sylvia Wynter was awarded the Order of Jamaica (OJ) for services in the fields of education, history, and culture.\"Five get OJ\", Jamaica Observer, 6 August 2010.\"Sylvia Wynter awarded the Order of Jamaica - Hon Professor Wynter's response to the letter of congratulations on her award sent by Professor Brian Meeks on behalf of the CCT\", Centre for Caribbean Thought, University of the West Indies at Mona, Jamaica. ==Critical work== Sylvia Wynter\u2019s scholarly work is highly poetic, expository, and complex. Her work attempts to elucidate the development and maintenance of colonial modernity and the modern man. She interweaves science, philosophy, literary theory, and critical race theory to explain how the European man came to be considered the epitome of humanity, \u201cMan 2\u201d or \u201cthe figure of man.\u201d Wynter's theoretical framework has changed and deepened over the years. In her essay \"Towards the Sociogenic Principle: Fanon, Identity, the Puzzle of Conscious Experience, and What It Is Like to be 'Black,'\" Wynter developed a theoretical framework, which she refers to as the \"sociogenic principle,\" which would become central to her work. Wynter derives this theory from an analysis of Frantz Fanon's notion of \"sociogeny.\" Wynter argues that Fanon's theorization of sociogeny envisions human being (or experience) as not merely biological, but also based in stories and symbolic meanings generated within culturally specific contexts. Sociogeny as a theory therefore overrides, and cannot be understood within, Cartesian dualism for Wynter. The social and the cultural influence the biological. In \u201cUnsettling the Coloniality of Being/Power/Truth/Freedom: Towards the Human, After Man, Its Overrepresentation\u2014An Argument,\u201d Wynter explains that the West uses race to attempt to answer the questions of who and what we are\u2014particularly after the enlightenment period that unveils religion as incapable of answering those questions. ==Works== ===Novel=== * The Hills of Hebron (1962) ===Critical text=== * Do not call us Negros: how multicultural textbooks perpetuate racism (1992) ===Drama=== * Miracle in Lime Lane (1959) * Shh...
