    "text": "High Crime is the seventh studio album by Al Jarreau, released in 1984. While slightly lower in the charts than his 1981 Breakin' Away and 1983 Jarreau release, this album scored in the top 10 on the Billboard Jazz charts and top 50 in the Billboard 200. In 1986 the album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B; Vocal Performance, Male. The album was certified Gold in 1986. ==Reception== AllMusic gave the album the following review: \"High Crime is fueled by the hard-pushing hit from Jarreau's previous album Boogie Down, producer Jay Graydon cranks up the energy level some more and comes up with a snazzy high-tech vehicle for his converted R&B; singer. The sound is hotter, stoked by greater reliance upon synthesizers and electronically goosed rhythm tracks, and Jarreau's own vocals are more hectic, though again not much in the way of individuality is required of him. But the material this time isn't as strong\u2014though 'Murphy's Law' is pretty catchy with its flugelhorn punctuations\u2014and so the reluctance to exploit the unique vocal talents of Jarreau is more glaring. The minor hit single of the album, oddly, is the mundane ballad 'After All,' an ominous harbinger of bathos to come from Jarreau down the road.\" == Track listing == ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1985) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |Australian (Kent Music Report)||65 |} ==Personnel== * Al Jarreau \u2013 lead vocals (all tracks), arrangements (2, 5), backing vocals (3, 6, 9, 10) * Jay Graydon \u2013 guitar (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10), arrangements (all tracks), synthesizers (2, 3, 4, 6, 10), computer concept (3) * Paul Jackson Jr. \u2013 guitar (6, 8) * Robbie Buchanan \u2013 synthesizers (1, 2, 4, 5, 9), arrangements (1, 5), electric piano (6) * Gary Chang \u2013 Fairlight programming (2) * Paul Bliss \u2013 computer concept (3), arrangements (3) * Steve Kipner \u2013 computer concept (3), arrangements (3) * Greg Phillinganes \u2013 synthesizers (4, 8, 10), arrangements (8) * David Foster \u2013 electric piano (5), synthesizers (5), arrangements (5) * Erich Bulling \u2013 Yamaha DX1 programming (5) * Bobby Lyle \u2013 synthesizers (6), arrangements (6) * Bo Tomlyn \u2013 Yamaha DX1 programming (6, 10) * Steve George \u2013 synthesizers (7), arrangements (7) * Bob Beats \u2013 bass guitar (1) * Nathan East \u2013 bass guitar (2, 10), arrangements (10) * Jake Jugs \u2013 bass guitar (4) * Skinsoh Umar \u2013 drums (1) * Chip McSticks \u2013 drums (2) * Mike Baird \u2013 percussion (2, 9), cymbals (4), drums (5) * Tyrone B.
