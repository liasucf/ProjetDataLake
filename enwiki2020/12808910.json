    "text": "Tor Mikkel Wara (born 27 December 1964) is a Norwegian politician from the Progress Party, who has served as Minister of Justice and Public Security of Norway from April 2018 to 2019 after the resignation of Sylvi Listhaug. Wara was born in Karasjok, and was a member of the Oslo municipality council between 1987 and 1989. During the same period he was the chairman of the Youth of the Progress Party, and became known as a young rising star within the party. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament for the Progress Party from Oslo in 1989, and became vice chairman of the party in 1991. In 1993 he however left the Progress Party and quit active politics. While he was one of the main players of the young libertarians within the party in the early 1990s, he was contrary to popular belief not part of the \"Dolkesj\u00f8\" incident in 1994, having left the party the year before. As the leadership of the Progress Party in 2006 changed hands from Carl I. Hagen to Siv Jensen, Wara was before the 2009 election spoken of as a possible Minister of Finance for the party in an eventual government, with the recent broad popular support for the party. In 2018, he was appointed Minister of Justice by Erna Solberg. ==Harassment campaign== In November 2018, a photo of Wara's private residence was used on stage for political commentary in the play Ways of Seeing, a production of the Black Box theatre in Oslo. Wara's long-term live-in partner Laila Anita Bertheussen along with Prime Minister Erna Solberg sharply criticized the production for exposing the Wara household in this manner, and in December 2018, Bertheussen filed a formal complaint against the theatre. Over the following months, the family received threatening letters and their house was vandalized with graffiti, before the apparent harassment culminated on March 10, 2019 with an arson attack on their car. However, four days later, Bertheussen was arrested on suspicion of having staged the entire harassment campaign herself, prompting Wara to resign his position on March 28. The trial is due to conclude on November 13, 2020. Accused of endangering democracy, Bertheussen potentially faces up to 16 years in prison. ==References== Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Progress Party (Norway) politicians Category:Members of the Storting Category:People from Karasjok Category:20th-century Norwegian politicians Category:Ministers of Justice of Norway ",
