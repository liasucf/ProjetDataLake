    "text": "Niketas David Paphlagon (), also known as Nicetas the Paphlagonian, was a prolific Byzantine Greek writer of the late 9th and early 10th century. Niketas was a disciple of Arethas of Caesarea. When Arethas, under pressure from Pope Nicholas I, moved to support the tetragamy of the Emperor Leo VI, Niketas distributed all his master's goods to the poor and fled to Thrace. He was arrested and imprisoned in Constantinople. The Patriarch Euthymios I secured his release, but forced him to live in seclusion for two years. Niketas was a prolific author on Christian topics. He wrote about fifty hagiographies, a treatise on calculating the end times, a commentary on the Psalms and many other works, including possibly pamphlets against Leo VI and Euthymios. In his commentary, he provides a moral exhortation for every psalm, which was an innovation at the time. He also evinces a strong dislike of musical instruments. His hagiography of Ignatios of Constantinople functions as a tract against Photios. His biography of Gregory of Agrigento was highly esteemed by Symeon the Metaphrast, who included it in his synaxarium. He was accused of heresy for proclaiming himself God, although this probably means only that he emphasised the divine nature in man. ==Notes== ==References== Category:9th-century Byzantine writers Category:10th-century Byzantine writers Category:Christian hagiographers Category:Bible commentators ",
