    "text": "Stanley Keith Pearl (21 December 1893 \u2013 9 August 1986) was an Australian sapper with the First Australian Imperial Force during World War I. Stanley Keith Pearl was born on 21 December 1893 in Ulverstone, Tasmania, the youngest child of Charles Pearl and Sophia Ann Wells.\"Stamley Keith Pearl\", Birth Certificate, Tasmanian Registry of Births, Deaths & Marriages, Registration Number 2664/1894. After enlisting at the town of Ulverstone in Tasmania on 9 November 1915 at twenty-one years of age, Pearl, in August 1916, became a sapper with the Australian 5 Field Company Engineers.Nicholas J. Saunders, \"Sapper Stanley Keith Pearl,\" in Sappers & Shrapnel: Contemporary Art and the Art of the Trenches, Lisa Slade (Adelaide: Art Gallery of South Australia, 2016), 15.

Kerry Neale, \"Decoration from Destruction: the First World War Trench Art of Sapper Pearl\", Australian War Memorial, 28 April 2016, accessed 5 March 2017. He performed this role for the duration of the war. == World War I == Pearl was a joiner by trade whose father was Charles Pearl of Ulverstone, Tasmania. Pearl was Anglican. He embarked from Sydney to Alexandria and then the Western Front (World War I) in France aboard HMAT Orsova on 11 March 1916. He undertook a brief stint with the 8 Field Company Engineers (Reinforcement 4) before joining the 5 Field Company Engineers.The Australian Imperial Force (AIF) Project, \"Stanley Keith Pearl\", (n.d.) University of New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra, Australian Defence Force Academy, accessed 29 April 2017. Pearl\u2019s Victory Medal (United Kingdom) and British War Medal are held in the Australian War Memorial\u2019s collection.Australian War Memorial collection, \"Victory Medal: Sapper S K Pearl, 5 Field Company Engineers, AIF\", accessed 29 April 2017.Australian War Memorial collection, \"British War Medal 1914-20: Sapper S K Pearl, 5 Field Company Engineers, AIF\", accessed 29 April 2017. Pearl produced a phenomenal collection of trench art between 1916 and 1919.Saunders 2016, p.18. Pearl donated his trench art objects to the Australian War Memorial but whether this reflects the full extent of that which he produced in the context of war remains a mystery.Saunders 2016, p.23. A total of fifteen of Pearl\u2019s oeuvre are held in the Australian War Memorial\u2019s Military Heraldry collection.Saunders 2016, p.18.Australian War Memorial collection, \"Collections search: Sapper Stanley Keith Pearl\", accessed 4 March 2017. Military shell cases, other parts of shells, badges and buttons were just some of the war-related materials used by Pearl to assemble everyday objects such as a clock, a map of Tasmania and a hat pin stand, as is evidenced by the accessibility and digitisation of his work on the War Memorial\u2019s online collection (see external links for selection of images). One can become more familiar with Pearl\u2019s work through such a collection as it displays images of the objects together with Pearl\u2019s own field notes. The accompanying field notes that Pearl documented alongside each piece are fascinating as this was not a feature typically associated with First World War trench art.Saunders 2016. Pearl used matter-of-fact language where tales of death became mere descriptions.Saunders 2016, p.22, 23. Pearl\u2019s field notes and his details on the First World War embarkation roll are useful additional primary sources for historians, art historians and anthropologists. ==Post-war and legacy== There is no evidence to suggest that Pearl is survived by anyone, nor have any photographs of him been discovered. Nick Mitzevich, \"Director\u2019s Foreword,\" in Sappers & Shrapnel: Contemporary Art and the Art of the Trenches, Lisa Slade (Adelaide: Art Gallery of South Australia, 2016), 8. He is an \"enigma.\" It is therefore Pearl\u2019s material existence in the form of trench art that survives, the power of which is subsequently elevated. The creative and artistic vision of Pearl to contribute to the material culture of World War I, of which trench art is a fascinating example, has meant that his name lives on through these well-crafted, striking objects.Nicholas J. Saunders, \"Bodies of Metal, Shells of Memory: \u2018Trench Art\u2019, and the Great War Re-cycled,\" Journal of Material Culture 5, no. 1 (2000), 45. Pearl was unconsciously engaging with features of material culture such as bricolage and recyclia in producing trench art. Corinne A. Kratz, \"Rethinking Recyclia,\" African Arts 28, no. 3 (Summer 1995), 7, 10.Saunders 2000, p.45. The fact that he was a joiner pre- war also speaks to this refined, craftsmanship-like quality to his pieces. Pearl survived World War I. During March of 1919, Pearl returned to Tasmania, although soon relocated to Canberra.Saunders 2016, p.15. He began working for the Australian War Memorial in 1941, the year that it opened, and continued to do so until he retired.Saunders 2016, p.15. He worked as a carpenter and senior tradesman at the War Memorial.Saunders 2016, p.15. The electoral roll details Pearl\u2019s exact position at the War Memorial as an \u2018installation manager.\u2019 Such hands-on employment echoes his pre-war occupation as a joiner. Pearl passed away at Woden Valley Hospital, Canberra, on 9 August 1986 at the age of 92 years, leaving his wife Gertrude Iris a widow.\"PEARL, Stanley Keith.\" Family Notices, The Canberra Times, 11 August 1986, p.16. A recent exhibition entitled Sappers & Shrapnel: Contemporary Art and the Art of the Trenches at the Art Gallery of South Australia showcased Pearl\u2019s trench art. The exhibition presented Pearl\u2019s pieces alongside other First World War trench art objects and more recent works of art that reflected on war today. Such a display, in bringing together the historical and the contemporary, was the first opportunity whereby the trench art of Pearl was exposed to a wider audience. It is evidence that Pearl and his trench art collection hold an important relevance today and will continue to do so in the future, especially in studies of history, art history and anthropology. ==Footnotes== ==Works== * Trench Art Chrysanthemum Vase, 1918-19 * Trench Art Clock, March 1918 * Trench Art Hat Pin Stand, May 1918 * Trench Art Map of Tasmania, 1917 ==Bibliography== * The Australian Imperial Force (AIF) Project. \"Stanley Keith Pearl.\" (n.d.) https://www.aif.adfa.edu.au/showPerson?pid=237003.
