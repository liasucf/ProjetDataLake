    "text": "\"Chain Gang\" is a song by the American singer-songwriter Sam Cooke, released on July 26, 1960. The song became one of Cooke's most successful singles, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, behind both \"My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own\" by Connie Francis and \"Mr. Custer\" by Larry Verne On the Hot R&B; Sides chart, the song peaked at number two as well. Overseas, \"Chain Gang\" charted at number nine on the UK Singles Chart. This was Cooke's second- biggest American hit, his first single for RCA Victor after leaving Keen Records earlier in 1959, and was also his first top 10 hit since \"You Send Me\" from 1957, and his second-biggest pop single. The song was inspired after a chance meeting with an actual chain gang of prisoners on a highway, seen while Cooke was on tour. Cooke was reportedly unsatisfied with the initial recording sessions of this song at RCA Studios in Manhattan in January 1960, and came back three months later to redo some of the vocals to get the effect he wanted. ==Other versions== Eight years later, in 1968, the song was recorded by the duo of Jackie Wilson and Count Basie. Released on the Brunswick label, this version became a top forty R&B; hit and a minor Billboard Hot 100 hit. ==Jim Croce medley== Jim Croce had his last Hot 100 hit in 1976 when Lifesong Records released \"Chain Gang Medley,\" a medley which included this song as well as \"He Don't Love You (Like I Love You)\" and \"Searchin'.\" The medley reached a peak of 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 after spending 9 weeks on the chart. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1975\u20131976) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|63 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary | style=\"text-align:center;\"|22 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Cash Box Top 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|56 |- |Canadian RPM Top Singles | style=\"text- align:center;\"|29 |- |Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary | style=\"text- align:center;\"|20 |} ==References== Category:1960 singles Category:1968 singles Category:Jackie Wilson songs Category:Sam Cooke songs Category:Songs written by Sam Cooke Category:Jim Croce songs Category:Songs about prison Category:Songs about labor Category:1960 songs Category:RCA Victor singles Category:Song recordings produced by Hugo & Luigi ",
