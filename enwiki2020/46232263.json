    "text": "Seo Sang-ryun (, 1848-1926), along with his brother Seo Sang-u (), founded the first Protestant church in Korea in 1884.There is a slight debate as to when the first Korean church was established, possibly dating as early as 1879. However, the best supported claim points to the church started by Suh Sang- ryun. It was established in the village of Sorae, Hwanghae province, where his uncle lived. Seo Sang-ryun was involved in the trade of ginseng in Manchuria and fell ill, coming close to death. He would be nursed back to health by the Scottish Protestant missionary John Macintyre and baptized by John Ross. Seo would later assist Ross in the translation of the gospel of Luke, helping to produce the first translation of the Bible into Korean. == See also == * John Ross * Korean Bible == References == Category:Presbyterianism in Korea Category:1848 births Category:1926 deaths ",
