After one month of work, he had completed the first draft of the screenplay. After addressing several issues he pitched the script to various clients, garnering at least three offers. When he first began to think about writing the script, Kolstad was influenced by film-noir classics, and the themes of revenge and the antihero. Kolstad explained that he tried to, \"explore what would happen if the worst man in existence found salvation [... and] when the source of his salvation is ripped from him, what happens? Do the gates of Hades open?\" In December 2012, Thunder Road Pictures had bought the script with discretionary funds, with Kolstad agreeing due to Thunder Road's plan to make the film straight away. When Basil Iwanyk, head of Thunder Road Pictures, had first read Kolstad's original screenplay, he was immediately drawn to the main character of Wick, stating: \"The tone of the script was subversive and really fun\". He also admired the emotional weight and action elements of the piece. After Thunder Road had optioned the script, Kolstad spent additional months rewriting the script with them. In the original script, the character of John Wick was written with \"a man in his mid-sixties\" to play the role, given the title character's fabled reputation as a revered and respected assassin. However, Iwanyk believed that this was irrelevant and bent the original vision ever so slightly, stating: \"Instead, we decided to look for someone who is not literally older, but who has a seasoned history in the film world\". Keanu Reeves in 2014 In 2013, Keanu Reeves secured the film's male lead. After Iwanyk and Peter Lawson of Thunder Road showed him the script, he thought it to be full of potential and stated: \"I love the role but you want the whole story, the whole ensemble to come to life\". Reeves and Kolstad worked closely together on further developing the screenplay and the story, with the screenwriter describing: \"We spent as much time developing the other characters as we did his. [Keanu] recognizes that the strength of the storyline lies in even the smallest details\". The title of the film was later changed from Scorn to John Wick, as according to Kolstad, \"Keanu liked the name so much, that Reeves kept telling everyone that he was making a film called 'John Wick, and the producers agreed, changing the title. Chad Stahelski in 2014 During story discussions for John Wick, Reeves contacted Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, whom he originally met on the set of The Matrix, to see if they were interested in choreographing or directing the action of the piece. Reeves admired Stahelski and Leitch's work performing, choreographing and coordinating, stating that, \"when I got the script...I immediately thought of Chad and Dave for the action design, but I was secretly hoping they'd want to direct it\". He then later added: \"I knew that they would love the genre and I knew that they would love John Wick. And I thought the worlds that get created \u2013 the real world and then this underworld \u2013 would be attractive to them, and it was\". After reading Kolstad's script, Stahelski and Leitch told Reeves they wanted to tell the story of John Wick, as they both had a desire to get involved with a project as directors. Impressed with Reeves' enthusiasm and the quality of the script, Stahelski and Leitch, told him that they wished to direct the film and later presented him with their version of the story which was based on \"[...] the idea of [Wick] as an urban legend, a thriller assassin movie with a realistic vibe and an otherworldly setting\". Impressed with their concept, Reeves supported the pair, and Stahelski and Leitch pitched the idea to the studio, who hired them to direct, contrary to their initial request of directing the film's second unit. In May 2013, Stahelski and Leitch came to direct the film together as a team, though it was later ruled by the Directors Guild of America that only Stahelski would be given the director credit. Leitch was credited as a producer. Principal photography for the first film was confirmed to have begun in New York City with an original shooting schedule meant to have occurred from September 25 to December 5, 2013 with the filming process scheduled to continue in and around New York City and greater New York area. In February 2015, directors Stahelski and Leitch stated that a John Wick sequel had begun development, which was later titled John Wick: Chapter 2. The same month Jon Feltheimer, CEO of Lionsgate, stated during a conference call that they see John Wick as a multiple-title action franchise. Additionally, it was reported that Kolstad would return to write the screenplay. In May 2015, it was confirmed that a sequel was green-lit, and Lionsgate would be selling the film at the Cannes Film Festival. Principal photography on the film began on October 26, 2015, in New York City. It would later move to Rome and eventually resumed in Montreal, Canada on October 27, 2016. In October 2016, Stahelski stated a third film was in development. In June 2017, it was reported that Kolstad would return to write the screenplay for the third film. In September 2017, Lionsgate announced a release date of May 17, 2019. In January 2018, it was reported that Chad Stahelski was returning to direct the film and Common, Laurence Fishburne, and Ruby Rose were set to reprise their roles from the second film. Additionally, it was announced that Hiroyuki Sanada had been cast as the film's antagonist. The film began production in early 2018. On May 21, 2018, it was reported that Halle Berry, Asia Kate Dillon, Anjelica Huston, Mark Dacascos and Jason Mantzoukas had joined the cast. === Inspiration for the film series === Director Chad Stahelski cited The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), Point Blank (1967), Le Cercle Rouge (1970), and The Killer (1989) as influences for series. About The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Stahelski said, \"Look at Clint Eastwood in [the film] \u2013 there is so much back-story unsaid there. We're big fans of leaving it to your imagination. We just give you some gold coins, and then it's, 'Where do the gold coins come from?' We'll get to that eventually. Have your imagination do some work there.\" He also said Point Blank influenced John Wick: \"One of the biggest inspirations for the film was Point Blank. We watched it on a loop in our office, and there are a couple of homages to that [in John Wick].\" Park Chan-wook's The Vengeance Trilogy (2002\u20132005) and Lee Jeong-beom's The Man from Nowhere (2010) influenced the film due to \"[their] minimalist composition and graphic nature.\" Alistair MacLean and Stephen King were huge influences in the creation of the story of John Wick in terms of characterization and world- building, with screenwriter Derek Kolstad stating, \"MacLean could build a world, and King could surprise you by what the main character truly was capable of.\" Outside of films, Stahelski and Leitch drew inspiration from the visual stylings of the '60s and '70s as well as cinematic influences, including Sergio Leone, Akira Kurosawa, Steve McQueen, Lee Marvin, William Friedkin and Sam Peckinpah. Stahelski himself said, \"All the way back to Kurosawa up to Sergio Leone. We like the spaghetti western sensibility there, some of the composition.\" About inspiration and emulation from the noir film genre, Stahelski added that \"Noir maybe was sort of less impact for us than the other sort of westerns and Kurosawa and things like that. I think we wanted to make this hard-boiled character.\" == Reception == === Box office performance === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Film ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | U.S. release date ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" class=sortable | Box office gross ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" text=\"wrap\" class=unsortable | All-time ranking ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Budget ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" class=unsortable | |- !
