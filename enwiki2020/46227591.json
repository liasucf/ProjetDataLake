The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 supercharged six-cylinder four- stroke diesel engines producing a total of and two SSW GU 343/38-8 double- acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. The boat was capable of operating at a depth of . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-1172 was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, (220 rounds), one Flak M42 and two C/30 anti-aircraft guns.

Nonetheless, it was also fitted to several Type IXs and one Type X. The Balkonger\u00e4t was an improved version of Gruppenhorchger\u00e4t (GHG) (group listening device). The GHG had 24 hydrophones, the Balkonger\u00e4t had 48 hydrophones and improved electronics, which enabled more accurate readings to be taken.
