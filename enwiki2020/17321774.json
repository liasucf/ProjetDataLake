    "text": "Erika Lust (born 1977) is a Swedish erotic film director, screenwriter and producer. Alongside others such as Petra Joy and Anna Span, Lust has been instrumental in promoting the aims of the feminist pornography movement. She has written several books. She has been living and working in Barcelona since 2000. Her film Cabaret Desire won her the Feminist Porn Award for Movie of the Year in 2012. It also won the CineKink Audience Choice Award for Best Narrative Feature. The first two compilations of her XConfessions series have won her the Feminist Porn Awards for Hottest Straight Vignette in 2014 and 2015 respectively. In 2015, a theatrical cut of XConfessions was screened at Chicago International Film Festival and at Raindance Film Festival in London. Following that, Lust held two sold-out screenings of the XConfessions Theatrical Cut at Kino Babylon in Berlin in February 2016, and went on to win the Best Narrative Short CineKink Award for short film An Appointment with My Master. == Background == Lust was born Erika Hallqvist in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1977. She harboured a passion for film and theatre. She went to Lund University, where she studied Political Sciences. While there, she came across Linda Williams' 1989 book Hard Core: Power, Pleasure, and the \"Frenzy of the Visible\", which later came to strongly influence her filmmaking. She also cites Jean Jacques Annaud's The Lover as a source of inspiration. She graduated with a BA in 1999, with a specialization in human rights and feminism. She moved to Barcelona in 2000, where she worked in production houses and took night courses in filmmaking. == Career == === Early successes === Lust shot her first film, the explicit short The Good Girl, in 2004. It was released for free on the internet and downloaded over 2 million times in the first month. The film was shown at the Barcelona International Erotic Film Festival the next year and won her a Ninfa Award. In 2005, after this initial success, she founded her video production company Lust Films. The company has produced erotic short films and compilations steadily from then on. Five Hot Stories For Her, an anthology of five vignettes including The Good Girl, won the Barcelona International Erotic Film Festival's 2007 Best Spanish Screenplay award, the Venus Berlin Fair's 2007 Eroticline Award for Best Adult Film for Women, and the 2008 Feminist Porn Award for Movie of the Year. Since then she has been a regular on the adult cinema festival circuit, and in 2020 one of her films came to the cinema on a regular basis for the first time. === Development === Interview Erika Lust in 2011 about Cabaret Desire Lust's films are characterized by carefully cast actors and high standards of production in adult film. Lust believes explicit film can be an educational tool besides being pleasurable and can help us better understand our sexuality, to live more freely and naturally. She hopes to influence viewers' conceptions of gender roles in sexuality. She considers pornography to be the \"most important discourse on gender and sexuality\". In 2010, Lust opened an online erotic cinema called Lust Cinema, exhibiting her own films and those of other authors of the new wave of explicit films. She started the first crowdsourced project in the history of adult cinema in 2013, calling it XConfessions. It has become her main source of work in the years thereafter. She has also written several books on eroticism and sexuality; her first book Good Porn was published in 2009 by Seal Press. Lust runs an online store offering her books and films, as well as sex toys and other erotic wares. In February 2016, her company had about 15 employees. In December 2014, Lust hosted a TED-talk at TEDxVienna. In the talk, entitled \"It's Time For Porn To Change\", Lust urges people to question the modern state of porn, its messages and role as a sexual educator. The TED talk launched the start of her campaign #changeporn, an online campaign intended to challenge and change the porn norm. As of September 2020, the talk has been watched nearly one million times on YouTube. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world in early 2020 and societies went into lockdown, Lust proclaimed May \"Masturbation Month\", encouraging people to safely stay at home and enjoy themselves with special offerings, announcing on 30 April 2020 on Instagram: 'I've created a one month calendar full of free sex ed guides, video tutorials, articles and music & film recommendations to keep you busy. Also, stay tuned - this month there will be @xconfessions and @lust.cinema giveaways and surprises to help make your solo sex sessions more interesting.\u2060' === XConfessions === Lust is currently producing short pornographic films based on crowd-sourced stories. Viewers can leave anonymous confessions on the project's website. Each month, Lust handpicks two stories and turn them into cinematic short films. As of September 2020, she has published 21 volumes of XConfessions shorts. XConfessions has been presented at the Berlin Porn Festival 2014. In 2015, a theatrical cut of XConfessions was screened along with a talk by Lust at the Raindance Film Festival in London and at the Chicago International Film Festival. In February 2016, Lust held two sold-out screenings of the XConfessions Theatrical Cut at Babylon in Berlin, and won Best Narrative Short at the CineKink Awards New York for BDSM short film An Appointment with My Master. == Controversy == In September 2018, in an interview by Tracy Clark-Flory for Jezebel.com, performer Rooster claimed to have had their sexual boundaries pushed by a director on set of a film being made for Erika Lust's XConfessions series in June 2017. Erika Lust disputed the claims and responded with a statement on her website. The allegations led to the creation of the \"Guest Director's Guide to Working With Performers\" in Spring 2018 (to which Rooster contributed) and a \"Performer's Bill of Rights\" (September 2018) by Erika Lust Films. == Selected filmography == === Feature films === * 2008: Barcelona Sex Project * 2010: Life Love Lust * 2011: Cabaret Desire * 2019: The Intern-A Summer of Lust === Compilations of shorts === * 2007: Five Hot Stories For Her incl.
