Firstpost's editor Bhaskar Chattopadhyay rated the movie 3 out of 5, saying \"Durgeshgorer Guptodhon, like his previous film, too tells the adventurous story of the trio, who has by now captured the imagination of Bengali audiences, both young and old. Flavored in a dizzying marinade of history and lore, and garnished with ample doses of puzzles, riddles, ciphers, and hidden codes, it is one of the more intelligent Bengali films in recent times. The puzzles seem neither fake nor forced, the clues are in fact quite exciting to decode, and the overall breezy nature of the storytelling ensures that even the strictest of critics have a jolly good time. I know I did\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 films Category:Indian films Category:Bengali-language films Category:2010s Bengali-language films Category:2010s adventure thriller films Category:Indian adventure thriller films ",
