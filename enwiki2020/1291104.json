    "text": "Rhyme & Reason is the second album by American new wave band Missing Persons, released in 1984. After the successful debut album by the band, this LP had a significant decline in sales. The pleasant-sounding \"Surrender Your Heart\" was its signature single. A video was created for it featuring animations from famous artist Peter Max and received heavy rotation on MTV, but the track was largely ignored by AOR radio. \"Give\" and \"Right Now\" were also released as singles, and videos made for both received airplay on MTV. Missing Persons embarked on a successful tour, but the album quickly fell off the sales charts. ==Track listing== #\"The Closer That You Get\" (Dale Bozzio, Terry Bozzio, Warren Cuccurullo) \u2013 4:54 #\"Give\" (D.
