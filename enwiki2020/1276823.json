    "text": "The Professional Footballers' Association Men's Players' Player of the Year (often called the PFA Men's Players' Player of the Year, the Players' Player of the Year, or simply the Player of the Year) is an annual award given to the player who is adjudged to have been the best of the year in English football. The award has been presented since the 1973\u201374 season and the winner is chosen by a vote amongst the members of the players' trade union, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA). The current holder is Kevin De Bruyne, who won the award on 8 September 2020. The 2020 ceremony was postponed from its usual date in April or May due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first winner of the award was Leeds United defender Norman Hunter. As of 2020, only Mark Hughes, Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale have won the award on two occasions, and only Henry and Ronaldo have won the award in consecutive seasons. Of the five, only Shearer won his two awards playing for different teams. Although there is a separate PFA Young Player of the Year award for players under the age of 23, young players remain eligible to win the senior award, and on three occasions the same player has won both awards for a season, Andy Gray in 1976\u201377, Ronaldo in 2006\u201307 and Bale in 2012\u201313. Every spring, each member of the association votes for two players. A shortlist of nominees is published in April and the winner of the award, along with the winners of the PFA's other annual awards, is announced at a gala event in London a few days later. The award is regarded by the players themselves as extremely prestigious, with Teddy Sheringham describing it in 2001 as \"the biggest personal award you can get in the game\", and John Terry stating in 2005 that he considered it \"the ultimate accolade to be voted for by your fellow professionals whom you play against week-in and week-out\". ==Winners== The award has been presented on 47 occasions as of 2020, with 42 different winners. The table also indicates where the winning player also won one or more of the other major \"player of the year\" awards in English football, namely the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award (FWA), the PFA Fans' Player of the Year award (FPY), the PFA Young Player of the Year award (YPY), the Premier League Player of the Season award (PPS), and the Football Supporters\u2019 Federation Player of the Year award (FSF). Andy Gray was the first player to win the Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year awards in the same season. Mark Hughes was the first player to win the Player of the Year award twice. Thierry Henry was the first player to win the award in two consecutive seasons. Cristiano Ronaldo was the first player to win all five major awards in the same year. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !Year ! !Player!!Club!!class=\"unsortable\"|Also
