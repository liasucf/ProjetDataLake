The seat of the regency government is at Kutacane. In 1974, the Southeast Aceh Regency was separated from the Central Aceh Regency; however in 2002 the northern part of this regency was itself split away to form the new Gayo Lues Regency. The main commodities produced in the regency are palm oil, cacao, coconut, coffee, nutmeg, walnut, and pachouli oil The main rivers are the Alas River and the Butan River. It contains the Leuser Ecosystem. == The Non-Alas People == The original inhabitants of this regency are the Alas people. They use the Alas language and live under the customs (adat) of those people. However, the population of the Southeast Aceh Regency has become very diverse due to migration from other regencies of Aceh and beyond. Although this Regency is part of Aceh province, the Aceh people (an eastern coastal grouping) do not dominate this place. Here are some other peoples other than Alas inhabiting the regency: * The Gayo people, the majority of whom live in Bambel village. * The Bataks (Karo, Mandailing, Toba, Nias) in Lawe Sigala-gala, Semadam, and Babussalam districts. * The Javanese (Javanese and Sundanese people) in Badar district. * Minangkabau people in Babussalam district (in the city of Kutacane). * Singkil people in Bambel district. * Acehnese people, mainly in Babussalam district (in the city of Kutacane). There are other smaller ethnic groups that are still new to the Regency and do not constitute a majority population elsewhere, such as Palembangese Malay people. == Administrative borders == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Direction !Neighbour |- |North |Gayo Lues Regency |- |East |Tanah Karo Regency of North Sumatra |- |West |South Aceh Regency |- |South |South Aceh Regency and Subulussalam city |} == Administrative divisions == The regency is divided administratively into sixteen districts (kecamatan), listed below with their populations at the 2010 Census:Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011. * Lawe Alas (13,010) * Babul Rahmad (7,439) * Tanoh Alas (3,606) * Lawe Sigala-Gala (17,429) * Babul Makmur (12,580) * Semadam (10,702) * Lauser (4,876) * Bambel (15,090) * Bukit Tusam (8,685) * Lawe Sumur (6,696) * Babussalam (24,785) * Lawe Bulan (13,426) * Badar (12,119) * Darul Hasanah (11,488) * Ketambe (9,273) * Deleng Pokhkisen (7,045) == Regents == {| class=\"wikitable\" !No. !Name !Period |- |1. |Lettu.
