It went surging from number 51 to number-one spot, making it the biggest jump in the chart history. The Rolling Stone Top 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing songs in the United States. Its data, published by Rolling Stone magazine and compiled by Alpha Data, is based collectively on each song's weekly physical and digital sales and streaming on online digital music outlets.

The first chart was published on July 2, 2019 for the week of June 21\u201327. During the year, seventeen acts achieved their first number-one as either lead or featured artists, such as Lil Nas X, Post Malone, Young Thug, Ariana Grande, Social House, Megan Thee Stallion, Nicki Minaj, Ty Dolla Sign, Lizzo, DaBaby, Travis Scott, Selena Gomez, Gunna, Lil Baby, Billie Eilish, The Weeknd and Mariah Carey. Fourteen singles reached number-one on the chart; which four were collaborations, and six have debuted atop the chart. Two number-one singles tied for the longest run on the chart in 2019: Lil Nas X's \"Old Town Road\" and Post Malone's \"Circles\" both achieving the top spot for five non-consecutive weeks. The remix of Lil Nas X's \"Old Town Road\", featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, subsequently topped the Rolling Stone Year-End Top 100 ranking as the most popular song of 2019, with 8.7 million units. Post Malone and Young Thug were the only acts to have multiple number ones in 2019, with two apiece. ==Chart history== \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X (pictured) became the first number-one song of the Rolling Stone Top 100 chart, and stayed there for five non-consecutive weeks.
