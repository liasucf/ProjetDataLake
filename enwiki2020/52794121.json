Hordern and the Googly == Portrait of Alick Mackenzie c.1905 Alick Mackenzie was a contemporary of H. V. Hordern who is well known as the first Australian cricketer to develop the ability to bowl the googly (wrong 'un) delivery. The googly is a delivery bowled by a leg spin bowler in a normal manner, but which turns in the opposite direction to a normal leg-break. The delivery was originally developed by English cricketer Bernard Bosanquet in the early 1900s while he was a student at Oxford University and he used it to great effect against Australia's batsman on England's tour of Australia in 1903/04. After witnessing Bosanquet bowl the googly, Hordern committed to teaching himself how to bowl it. Prior to the commencement of the 1905/06 season Hordern asked Alick to join him at the Sydney Cricket Ground so that he could practice bowling the new delivery. The first two deliveries that he bowled were full tosses and promptly hit to the boundary by Mackenzie. The third landed on the pitch, spun, beat the bat and clean bowled the batsman. It was after this occurrence that Hordern begun using the googly in first-class matches. == Personal life == On 19 May 1900 Alick married Jessie Maud Phelps. They had four children. After leaving school, Alick entered employment as a clerk with the New South Wales Department of Audit. He would remain with the department until his retirement in the 1930s. == Life after cricket == After his cricket career finished in 1910, Alick took up the sport of competitive lawn bowls. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1870 births Category:1947 deaths Category:Australian cricketers Category:New South Wales cricketers Category:Cricketers from Sydney ",
