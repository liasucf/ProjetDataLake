Wandering the outside again, Krazy spots a turkey. But before he could take a feather, the turkey is able to lose him. Krazy then spots what appears to be another turkey but is a parasol. After some trouble with an escaped prisoner, Krazy sees a feathery figure behind a lightpost. It's a bomb-wielding spy. The spy hurls a bomb at Krazy which blasts the cat sky high.

Back on the ground, Krazy comes across a tent where a gremlin with a feather hat emerges. Krazy takes the feathers from the latter's hat, and flees. The gremlin calls out a bigger companion who starts hurling darts at Krazy. Krazy safely returns to the maid's house.
