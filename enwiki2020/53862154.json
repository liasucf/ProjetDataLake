The first round of the presidential election was held on February 4, 2018, with the two highest-ranked candidates being Christian singer and Congressman Fabricio Alvarado Mu\u00f1oz from the conservative National Restoration Party and writer and former Minister Carlos Alvarado Quesada from the progressive Citizens\u2019 Action Party, gaining 24% and 21% of the votes respectively. As no candidate received more than 40% of the first round vote, a second round run-off election was held on April 1, 2018 and was won by Carlos Alvarado Quesada, with a landslide victory of 60.6% of the vote. The previously dominant National Liberation Party suffered its worst results to date, ending third in the presidential run for the first time in its history with its candidate former Legislative Assembly President Antonio \u00c1lvarez Desanti winning only 18%. Other notable candidates were lawyer and entrepreneur Rodolfo Piza from the center-right Social Christian Unity Party with 16% and right-wing populist Juan Diego Castro with 9%. In the 57-seat Legislative Assembly, the National Liberation Party won 17 seats, the National Restoration Party won 14 seats (although their parliamentary group later splits in half due to factionalism), the Citizens' Action Party won 10 seats, the Social Christian Unity Party won 9 seats, the National Integration Party won 4 seats, the Social Christian Republican Party (an offshoot of PUSC) won 2 seats and left-wing Broad Front won 1 seat. ==Electoral system== The President of Costa Rica is elected using a modified two-round system in which a candidate must receive at least 40% of the vote to win in the first round; if no candidate wins in the first round, a runoff will be held between the two candidates with the biggest quantity of votes.Costa Rica IFES The 57 members of the Legislative Assembly are elected using closed list proportional representation through the largest remainder method from seven multi-member constituencies with between four and 19 seats, which are based on the seven provinces.Electoral system IPU Party lists were required to alternate between male and female candidates, with parties also required to have three or four of their seven regional lists headed by a female candidate.Gender equality ruling aims for nearly 50/50 male-female Costa Rican legislature Tico Times, May 27, 2016 ==Presidential primaries== ===Citizens' Action Party=== The internal elections for the Citizens' Action Party were held on July 9, 2017. The candidates were two former ministers of the Sol\u00eds Rivera administration; writer Carlos Alvarado, former Minister of Labour and Social Issues, and economist Welmer Ramos, former Economy Minister. Alvarado won by 56% of the votes. Deputies Epsy Campbell, Ott\u00f3n Solis and Vicepresident Ana Helena Chac\u00f3n declined a potential run. Carlos Alvarado was the first one of the party to announce his intention to run under the slogan of \"I choose the future\" (Elijo el futuro) and ran under a progressive platform, which sought to exalt the achievements of Luis Guillermo Solis's government and promised to continue with it. Meanwhile, Welmer Ramos's campaign focused more on a moderate and conservative campaign, under the slogan \"A citizen like you\" (Un ciudadano como usted) and openly criticized the then government to appeal to those who were upset with the administration. ===Libertarian Movement=== The Libertarian Movement had its first primaries on June 30, 2017. Candidates were deputy Natalia Diaz, and historic leader and deputy Otto Guevara Guth, who will attempt to run for presidency for the fifth time. Guevara won the primary over Diaz by a 10% margin. Otto Guevara's primary campaign was based under a right- wing populist inclination, stating that Donald Trump's presidential campaign had given him new inspiration to run, while Natalia Diaz's campaign promised to bring a new face to the party and offer a new alternative to the party's establishment. After the 2016 municipal elections, the party lost its only mayor and 258 aldermen, leaving it with little power. Plus, due to Guevara's turnabout from libertarianism to religious conservatism, many party adherents created a new party: the Liberal Progressive Party, under former transport minister Eli\u00e9cer Feinzag's leadership; or joined Social Christian Unity Party because of its new liberal stance on politics. ===National Liberation Party=== The internal elections for the National Liberation Party were held on April 2, 2017. The candidates were Sigifredo Aiza Campos, former deputy for the Guanacaste province, then deputy and radio host Rolando Gonz\u00e1lez Ulloa, Antonio \u00c1lvarez Desanti president of the Legislative Assembly, former minister and presidential candidate who was supported by former president \u00d3scar Arias S\u00e1nchez, and former president Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres Olsen. \u00c1lvarez Desanti was chosen as the party's candidate. === Social Christian Unity Party === The Social Christian primary was held on June 4, 2017 with former president of the Health System and previous candidate Rodolfo Piza winning over then deputy Rafael Ortiz. === Other candidates === Former Public Safety Minister Juan Diego Castro launched his unexpected presidential campaign presenting himself as a political outsider and with a strong anti-establishment and anti- corruption speech. Promising to \"rule by decree\" and with a very loud \"hard hand\" rhetoric (uncommon in Costa Rican politics as the country is famous for its political centrism), Castro has been compared to figures like Donald Trump and Rodrigo Duterte, and accused of right-wing populism and far-right positions, albeit he rejects the comparisons. He ran as the National Integration Party's nominee. Four of the minor candidates lean towards the conservative evangelical community. These are former journalist and San Jos\u00e9 deputy Fabricio Alvarado for National Restoration Party, journalist Stephanie Campos for Costa Rican Renewal Party, perennial candidate and San Jos\u00e9 deputy \u00d3scar L\u00f3pez for Accessibility without Exclusion, and lawyer and twice Cartago deputy Mario Redondo for Christian Democratic Alliance a former Cartaginese provincial party but which expanded to the national level. The left-wing Broad Front nominated Alajuela deputy Edgardo Araya (:es:Edgardo Araya Sibaja). The far-left Workers' Party chose the trade unionist and high school professor Jhon Vega as its candidate. The right-wing New Generation Party chose its founder Sergio Mena as the presidential nominee. Finally, former Social Christian Unity Party's presidential nominee Rodolfo Hern\u00e1ndez (:es:Rodolfo Hern\u00e1ndez G\u00f3mez) launched his presidential campaign with the newly formed Social Christian Republican Party, a party formed by former PUSC members dissatisfied with the liberal-controlled Social Christian Central Committee, who claimed the party had lost its Calderonist origins == Presidential candidates == {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center; !colspan=3 style=background:#fffcb7|50x50pxCitizens' Action Party |- !width=200px style=background:#f9cc00| !width=200px style=background:#f9cc00| !width=200px style=background:#f9cc00| |- style=\"background:red;\" |for President |colspan=2 |for Vice presidents |- | 190x190px | 150x190px | 150x190px |- | Labor Minister (2014\u20132016) Executive President of the Joint Social Welfare Institute (2016\u20132017) | Deputy in the Legislative Assembly (2002\u20132006 and 2014\u20132018) | Labor Union Leader |} {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center !colspan=3 style=background:#CEE7FF|50x50px |- !width=200px style=background:#0059CF| !width=200px style=background:#0059CF| !width=200px style=background:#0059CF| |- style=\"background:yellow;\" | for President |colspan=2|for Vice presidents |- | 190x190px | 190x190px | 190x190px |- | Deputy in the Legislative Assembly (2014\u20132018) | | |} === Other presidential candidates === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\" |- | style=\"background:#f1f1f1; width:850px;\" colspan=\"30\"|Candidates included in this section have received more than 2% support in popular vote. |- !style=\"width:160px; font-size:120%; background:green;\"| ! style=\"width:160px; font-size:120%; background:blue;\"| ! style=\"width:160px; font-size:120%; background:#122562;\"| ! style=\"width:160px; font-size:120%; background:red;\"| |- | 150x150px | 150x150px | 150x150px | 150x150px |- | Minister of Farming (1987\u20131988) Minister of Governance (1988\u20131999) Deputy (1994\u20131998 and 2014\u20132017) | Justice of the Supreme Court (2009\u20132013) Executive President Costa Rican Social Security Fund (1998\u20132002) | Minister of Public Safety (1994\u20131996) Minister of Justice (1997\u20131998) | Director Costa Rica's Children's Hospital (2001\u20132014) |- | 50x50pxNational Liberation Party | 50x50pxSocial Christian Unity Party | 50x50pxNational Integration Party | 50x50pxSocial Christian Republican Party |- |} == Campaign == Several topics like unemployment, corruption, economics, insecurity and poverty are among the main issues that concern the electorate according to polls. But one particular event that cause uproar in the campaign was the \"Cementazo\" (lit. cement hit) scandal. A corruption scandal involving political figures of all the main parties, including candidate Otto Guevara, whose properties and parliamentary office were raided by the General Attorney investigating the case. Some analysts point to the Cementazo scandal as one of the reasons for the unexpected ascension in polls of hardline anti-establishment candidate Castro. During the campaign Castro made a series of highly controversial statements that often caused polemic reactions. Among other things, he accused the Judiciary of having some of its female members ascending due to sexual favors, something that sprang harsh responses from female judges and judicial workers. Political figures from other parties reacted with outrage including Desanti's wife Nuria Marin and PAC's vice-president nominee Epsy Campbell. He later clarified that he was referring to one particular case of a known female friend of his. He also called for the removal of the prohibition on oil exploitation and gold mining calling those who opposed it \"eco-terrorists and extremists\". Desanti also said that \"extremists should not dictate environmental policies\" but mentioned that he opposes oil exploitation. Both Alvarado Quesada and Araya are staunch opponents of all forms of oil exploration and exploitation. A surprising ruling from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights extending all rights enjoyed by heterosexual couples to same-sex couples made after Costa Rica's government lodged a motion for clarification also had an impact on the campaign. The ruling may require up to 22 signatory countries of the Pact of San Jos\u00e9 that recognize the contentious authority of the IACHR to change their laws to legalize same-sex marriage (whether by legislative or judicial methods, or both). Most polls show that most Costa Ricans oppose gay marriage albeit with large numbers supporting it (in a general ratio of 60\u201340%).Religion in Latin America Chapter 5: Social AttitudesReligion in Latin America Appendix A: Methodology Se mantienen actitudes conservadoras en Costa Rica sobre matrimonio igualitario y Estado laico Opponents of gay marriage were outraged by the ruling, causing an increase in social media support for Christian singer and journalist Fabricio Alvarado Mu\u00f1oz from the staunchly conservative National Restoration Party (a normally small party with testimonial results mostly supported by the Evangelical Christian minority). Alvarado Mu\u00f1oz was, for the first time for an Evangelical candidate, attracting Catholic voters. Nevertheless, Alvarado Mu\u00f1oz' gain also saw a counter-reaction. Social media support for progressive pro-gay marriage candidate Carlos Alvarado Quesada was also notable, particularly among millennials and centennials who mostly support socially liberal policies. Some analysts point to a possible polarization between conservative and progressive voters, or among religious and secular or older and younger generations depending on the measure, which pushed both Alvarados into the second round. At least two homophobic attacks were reported. During the run-off campaign, Alvarado Mu\u00f1oz\u2019 strategy focused on linking his rival with the somewhat unpopular government at the time by pointing out its flaws, errors and scandals. On the contrary, Alvarado Quesada tried to distance himself from Luis Guillermo Sol\u00eds\u2019 Administration, but at the same time highlighted its achievements. Mu\u00f1oz also reinforced his idea of defending \"pro-life and family\" values, whilst Quesada insisted in wanting an inclusive country with no \"second class citizens\". Quesada's strategy focused in presenting Mu\u00f1oz as inexperienced and unprepared, pointing out his delay in presenting his second government program as promised and contradictions between him and some of his close collaborators. A series of controversies affected Mu\u00f1oz' presidential run, including accusations of plagiarism on his government program, a delay in the presentation of his party's financial reports, high payments to him and some other high-ranking party members for services during the campaign, etc. But probably one of the most damaging was the content of a book written by pastor and tele-evangelist Ronny Chaves (close collaborator of Fabricio and described by him as \"spiritual father\") calling \"La Negrita\" or Virgen de los Angeles (Costa Rica's patron saint) a demon. Something that some analysts highlight as hurtful to many Catholics' feelings causing many of them to switch towards Carlos Alvarado. In fact, the Cartago Province which is Costa Rica's Catholic epicenter and see of the Bas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los \u00c1ngeles is where Quesada's support was higher (75%), on the contrary Fabricio won by wide margin in the mostly Protestant province of Lim\u00f3n. In the second round Carlos kept San Jos\u00e9, Heredia and Cartago Provinces and all of the cantons he won in the first one, and managed to turn Alajuela and Guanacaste on his favor. He also won, again, the foreign vote winning all ballot booths overseas except Singapore were there was a tie. Fabricio kept Puntarenas and Lim\u00f3n as his strongholds and won in all cantons of Limon, most of the Punteranas cantons, four of the northern cantons of Alajuela (San Carlos, Upala, Guatuso and Los Chiles) and Sarapiqui in Heredia. Abstentionism was less during the second round for the first time in history. == Polling and voters' behavior == During pre-campaign Juan Diego Castro emerged as one of the most popular political figures with around 51% of positive opinions, followed by Antonio \u00c1lvarez Desanti with 36%, with Libertarian deputy Otto Guevara and former president Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres as the ones with more negative opinions. After the PLN primary in which Desanti won over Figueres by slight margin, Desanti started the campaign as frontrunner for a while with up to 36% support in some early polls. Castro was also among the favorites even before he had a party supporting his candidacy (something required by law in Costa Rica as independent candidates are not allowed). As the campaign continued Desanti suffered a constant decrease in voters' intent. Castro remained as frontrunner for most of 2017, but an erratic and heavily controversial campaign begins to affect him losing support in January. PUSC's Rodolfo Piza remained as second in some polls, later replaced by Castro but still in third place. The \"Cementazo\" scandal affected heavily the parties involved (PAC, PLN, PUSC and ML) especially during November and December when the Parliamentary Committee investigating the issue made most of its hearings, with all parties facing a reduction on their support. The IACHR's ruling on same-sex marriage caused a turmoil in the country, with conservative candidate and staunch opponent Fabricio Alvarado showing a rapid increase in support passing from marginal percentages of around 2\u20136% to be in the lead with up to 17%. However, Carlos Alvarado's support also started to grow unusually fast especially in mid and late January with the later polls showing him surpassing other candidates including Castro and Piza, passing from sixth to third in a couple of days, and even in a technical tie with Desanti showing possibilities to go into the run-off. Castro appeared in fourth and Piza in fifth place as of late January. PAC's support historically tend to increase in January and after the debates, but it was also possible that its support came from more liberal voters fearful of a religious government. According to polls Fabricio Alvarado Mu\u00f1oz took most of his support from Evangelical Christian voters who represented around 70% of his supporters, followed by 20% Roman Catholics and 8% with no religion. Carlos Alvarado Quesada, on the contrary, was mostly supported by Catholics with 52% of his voters belonging to that denomination, followed by 29% non-religious and 13% Protestants. Alvarado Quesada was most popular among urban voters with higher education, whilst Alvarado Mu\u00f1oz had strong support by those with only elementary or high school levels of education. Also Alvarado Quesada was more popular among voters under 35, whilst Alvarado Mu\u00f1oz was more popular among women under 35 and voters of both sexes over 55. A post-election study completed by the University of Costa Rica showed that Alvarado Quesada's success was in part due to his performance in the debates, his campaign and defense of the Rule of law. Whilst Alvarado Mu\u00f1oz' supporters mentioned defense of the traditional family, the fact that he was a believer and being an alternative to PAC. Religion wasn't such an important factor as originally thought, but 71% of Alvarado Quesada's voters mentioned Ronny Chaves' anti-Catholic statements as something \"bad or very bad\", against 35% of Fabricio's voters expressing that such thing was indifferent to them. Roman Catholics were 60% more likely to vote for Carlos Alvarado than non-Catholics that were only 30%. Alvarado Quesada had also much more support from middle and High Classes especially from the urban areas and the Central Valley whilst Fabricio's support came from the periphery and coastal areas with higher poverty levels and where the population is lower and less willing to vote at all. ===Polling tampering === The last poll of the second round scheduled for March 28 was canceled due to the fact that OPol Consultores' executives alleged that threats had been made against their collaborators. Shortly before this announcement, social media reported that a vehicle registered in the name of the private limited company to which the pollster belongs and led by the director of the company traveled with flags of National Restoration. Also the poll published by the Institute of Population Studies (IDESPO) of the National University, the only one that showed a wide advantage on the part of Carlos Alvarado over Fabricio, was questioned almost immediately by the digital newspaper El Mundo questioning its methodology. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal and the University's Council reaffirmed the validity of the poll. The IDESPO poll would be the closest to the electoral result of the second round together with an informal poll conducted by the Los Paleteros ice cream company. After the campaign it was made public that during the second round the Executive Committee of the National Restoration Party had made payments to the polling company OPol according to financial reports submitted to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Party officials reported that these were political consultancies unrelated to the polls, however, subsequent investigations by the newspaper La Naci\u00f3n discovered a contract for the payment of the six polls that were carried out during the second round campaign, of which five were published by El Mundo. In all of them Fabricio Alvarado appeared as the winner by a wide margin. They were immediately shared in the social media of the group and the candidate as well as party personalities and allies including deputy-elect and vice presidential candidate Jonathan Prendas and deputy Mario Redondo. Catherina Convertino, general manager of Opini\u00f3n Pol\u00edtica CyC, a private limited company that owns both OPol and El Mundo newspaper, confirmed to La Naci\u00f3n that the second round polls had been requested by Juan Carlos Campos, head of the National Restoration campaign and that they decided to make it public following the debt of the party in the total payment of the contract.

parliamentary plurality despite being third on the presidential ticket with 17 seats (only one less), followed by the National Restoration Party obtaining 14, the first time in Costa Rica's history that a religious party gained such large number. The ruling party Citizens' Action became third with 10, also the first time in history that a ruling party is neither the second nor the third- largest party. However this situation will change after a break-up among the National Restoration deputies causes more than half to split from the party a few months after the election, thus turning PAC back into first minority. The Social Christian Unity Party gained one more seat (9). The left-wing Broad Front suffered a major setback losing most of its seats passing from 9 to 1, whilst right-wing National Integration returns to Congress for the first time in 20 years with 4 seats, but another schism between the party's leadership and the 2018's nominee Juan Diego Castro causes one of PIN's deputies (a Castro loyalist) to separate. The newly formed party Social Christian Republican gains two deputies. {|class=wikitable style=text-align:right |colspan=6|center |- !colspan=2|Party !Votes !% !Seats !+/\u2013 |- |bgcolor=#008024| ||align=left|National Liberation Party||416,638||19.49|||17||style=\"color:red;\"| \u20131 |- |bgcolor=| ||align=left|National Restoration Party||388,086||18.16||14||style=\"color:green;\"| +13 |- |bgcolor=#FFD700| ||align=left|Citizens' Action Party||347,703||16.27||10||style=\"color:red;\"| \u20133 |- |bgcolor=#0000bF| ||align=left|Social Christian Unity Party||312,097||14.60||9||style=\"color:green;\"| +1 |- |bgcolor=| ||align=left|National Integration Party||163,933||7.67||4||style=\"color:green;\"| +4 |- |bgcolor=| ||align=left|Social Christian Republican Party||89,969||4.21||2||New |- |bgcolor=#FFEF00| ||align=left|Broad Front||84,437||3.95||1||style=\"color:red;\"| \u20138 |- |bgcolor=#42057f| ||align=left|Christian Democratic Alliance||52,325||2.45||0||style=\"color:red;\"| \u20131 |- |bgcolor=#B22027| ||align=left|Libertarian Movement||49,659||2.32||0||style=\"color:red;\"| \u20134 |- |bgcolor=| ||align=left|Accessibility without Exclusion||46,071||2.16||0||style=\"color:red;\"| \u20131 |- |bgcolor=#00A1B3| ||align=left|New Generation Party||45,896||2.15||0||0 |- |bgcolor=cornflowerblue| ||align=left|Costa Rican Renewal Party||41,806||1.96||0||style=\"color:red;\"| \u20132 |- |bgcolor=#66CC33| ||align=left|Authenthic Limonense Party||13,661||0.64||0||0 |- |bgcolor=#EB6702| ||align=left|Liberal Progressive Party||12,537||0.59||0||New |- |bgcolor=Crimson| ||align=left|Workers' Party||11,615||0.54||0||0 |- |bgcolor=#EB4600| ||align=left|Let's Act Now (Actuemos Ya)||9,898||0.46||0||New |- |bgcolor=#C639DB| ||align=left|Let's Go (Vamos) es||8,283||0.39||0||New |- |bgcolor=#E3EB00| ||align=left|United Forces for Change Party||8,237||0.39||0||New |- |bgcolor=#3D4391| ||align=left|Everybody (Todos)||8,062||0.38||0||New |- |bgcolor=#6E501E| ||align=left|Guanacastecan Union Party||7,994||0.37||0||New |- |bgcolor=#264CC9| ||align=left|United Communal Party||6,270||0.29||0||New |- |bgcolor=#000000| ||align=left|Transporters' Party es||4,868||0.23||0||0 |- |bgcolor=#CC9A10| ||align=left|Recovering Values Party||4,840||0.23||0||New |- |bgcolor=#7D2F02| ||align=left|Homeland, Equality & Democracy Party es||1,881||0.09||0||0 |- |bgcolor=#ED0028| ||align=left|New Socialist Party es||790||0.04||0||0 |- |align=left colspan=2|Invalid/blank votes||40,540||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=2|Total||2,178,096||100||57||0 |- |align=left colspan=2|Registered voters/turnout||3,322,329||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=6|Source: TSE |} ====By province==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%; line-height:20px;\" |- !
