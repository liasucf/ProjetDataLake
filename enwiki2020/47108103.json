They part under an informal arrangement, although each continues to admire the other. Lord Algy determines to retrench his fortune by backing a certain horse in a race. Lady Algy, knowing the horse cannot win, makes friends with Jethroe (Stuart) to get a tip on the race, hoping to win enough to recoup her husband's losses. Mrs. Tudway (Ballin), wife of a friend of Lord Algy, plans to run away with another man. Algy learns of the plan and cooperates, allowing the elopers the use of his chambers as a rendezvous, hoping to persuade Mrs. Tudway to stay with her husband. Scandal then connects the names of Lady Algy with Jethroe and of Lord Algy with Mrs. Tudway. Algy's horse loses the race while Lady Algy's wins. Brabazon Tudway (Burress) discovers his wife in Lord Algy's chambers and suspects him of stealing her affections. Lady Algy arrives, grasps the situation at a glance, and diplomatically smooths things over. She tells Lord Algy of her success with the race and they are reunited. ==Cast== * Tom Moore as Lord Algy * Naomi Childers as Lady Algy * Leslie Stuart as Jethroe * Frank Leigh as Marquis of Quarmby * William Burress as Brabazon Tudway * Alec B.
