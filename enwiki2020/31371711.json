The document - whose title deliberately echoes the Czechoslovak human rights declaration Charter 77 twenty years earlier - was created on the anniversary of a referendum held in 1996, and which, in the words of the organisation of the same name, declares: \"devotion to the principles of independence, freedom and democracy, respect to the human rights, solidarity with everybody, who stands for elimination of dictatorial regime and restoration of democracy in Belarus.\" ===Jeans Revolution (2006)=== The Jeans Revolution was a term used by the opposition in Belarus and its supporters to describe their effort and aspirationsA 2005 Iryna Khalip interview on democratic changes in Belarus, in the period leading up to the 2006 presidential election. ===2010 presidential election=== After the 2010 Belarusian presidential election, up to 40,000 people protested against Lukashenko. Up to 700 opposition activists, including 7 presidential candidates, were arrested in the post-election crackdown. Several websites of the opposition and opposition candidates were also blocked or hacked. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google Talk, many email services and LiveJournal were also blocked. The headquarters of Charter97, an opposition group and website, was stormed by Lukashenko's security forces and all of its staff were arrested. According to the Independent, Lukashenko's security forces went after his opponents \"with a ferocity that would not have looked out of place in Soviet times\". ===2011 protests=== A series of protests influenced by the Arab Spring took place in 2011. As a result of these protests, on 29 July, the government banned assemblies and gatherings.[] ===2012 protests=== On 25 March 2012, several thousand people participated in an anti-government rally in Belarus on the anniversary of Belarus's short-lived independence from Russia in 1918. Belarusian state television reported that there were 200 protesters in Minsk. ===2017 protests=== Since the ongoing economic recession, continuing since the last series of protests in 2015, due to falling gasoline prices and that year a law was passed taxing the unemployed. Roughly 470,000 Belarusians are obliged to pay the tax but only about 10% have since it was issued. Approximately 2,500 protesters filled the streets in the capital of Belarus, Minsk, on 17 February to protest a policy that required those who work for less than 183 days per year to pay USD$250 for \"lost taxes\" to help fund welfare policies.

On 19 February, another 2,000 demonstrated in the second city of Homie\u013a. Both gatherings were peaceful and were not disrupted by police. Smaller demonstrations were held in other cities. On 25 March, opposition leader Vladimir Nekliayev, who was set to speak at the main protest, was also allegedly stopped at the border in the morning on his way to Minsk.

Many opposition candidates registered for the next election as a result of the movement, but many of the candidates were arrested. Mass protests erupted across Belarus following the 2020 Belarusian presidential election which was marred by allegations of widespread electoral fraud. Subsequently, opposition presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya claimed she had won the presidential election with between 60 and 70% of the vote and formed a Coordination council to facilitate the peaceful and orderly transfer of power in Belarus.https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/681364.htmlhttps://apnews.com/2654151658e4a01e36248a71a3911324 ==Opposition parties and organisations== *Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic *Belarus Free Theatre *Belarusian Christian Democracy *Belarusian Green Party *Belarusian Women's Party \"Nadzieja\" *Party of Freedom and Progress *Social Democratic Assembly *United Civic Party of Belarus *Young Front *Belarusian Social Democratic Party (Assembly) *United Civic Party *A Just World *BPF Party *Belarusian Humanities Lyceum *Day of Solidarity with Belarus *Freedom Day (Belarus) *YCSU Young Democrats *Zubr (political organization) ==International support== ===Organizations=== * The European Union has enforced sanctions against Lukashenko's government. * NATO has enforced sanctions against the Lukashenko administration. ===Governments=== The following governments have given diplomatic support to the Belarusian democracy movement: * * * * * ===People=== *Actors Kevin Spacey, Jude Law, Roger Lloyd-Pack and playwright Sir Tom Stoppard joined street protests in London against Lukashenko's government in 2011. ==See also== *A Lesson of Belarusian ==References== Category:Democracy movements by country Category:Politics of Belarus ",
