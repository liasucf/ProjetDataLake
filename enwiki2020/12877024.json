    "text": "You Gotta Believe is the second and final album by American hip hop group, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch (Mark would go on to make two albums with reggae artist Prince Ital Joe without the Funky Bunch before later going on to become an actor) released on September 15, 1992. Coming off the moderate success of Music for the People, which reached #21 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Platinum, the group rushed to the studio to record a follow-up. However, You Gotta Believe was not as successful as the previous album, only making it as high as #67 on the Billboard 200. The album included the semi- successful single \"You Gotta Believe\". The track \"Loungin'\" was a collaboration between Mark and older brother Donnie Wahlberg of New Kids on the Block. The album was notably more vulgar than the group's debut album; however, the majority of profanities are censored, with no uncensored version available. This practice was used a lot in the 1990s as a way to keep an artist's edge while trying to still keep a mass appeal. ==Track listing== # \"The Crisis\" \u2013 1:02 # \"You Gotta Believe\" \u2013 4:32 # \"Gonna Have a Good Time\" \u2013 4:32 # \"Loungin'\" \u2013 4:26 # \"Don't Ya Sleep\" \u2013 2:53 # \"I Want You\" \u2013 6:09 # \"The American Dream\" \u2013 5:22 # \"The M\" \u2013 2:03 # \"Get Up (The Funky Bunch Theme)\" \u2013 3:25 # \"Super Cool Mack Daddy\" \u2013 4:43 # \"I Run Rhymes\" \u2013 5:16 # \"Ain't No Stoppin' the Funky Bunch\" \u2013 4:03 # \"The Last Song on Side B Part II: Go On\" \u2013 4:41 # \"The Solution\" \u2013 1:03 ==References== Category:Mark Wahlberg albums Category:1992 albums Category:Interscope Records albums ",
