    "text": "Mystery at Lake Placid is the first book in the series. The Screech Owls is a series of juvenile fiction novels by Canadian author Roy MacGregor. There are currently 27 titles in the series, all published by McClelland & Stewart. == Summary == The series centers around a fictional hockey team, however it incorporates actual events and locations, such as the Quebec Peewee Invitational in Quebec, Canada. and the 1998 Winter Olympics and 2002 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan and Salt Lake City, United States, respectively. There does not appear to be a clear time line of events in the series. Although MacGregor often refers back to events that occurred in previous books in the series, the static ages of the players and the seemingly never-ending hockey season contradict any definite time line. The books themselves, all of which are told from the point of view of team captain, Travis Lindsay, provide light action and mystery for the young reader. Terrorists, murderers, kidnappers, ghosts and other improbable anomalies befall the preteen in between, and sometimes during, their hockey games and tournaments. ==Awards and recognition== The Screech Owls Series has won the Our Choice Award and the Manitoba Young Reader\u2019s Choice Award. The series has also been shortlisted for several awards, including the Arthur Ellis Award. ==Television show== Screech Owls aired on YTV from September 1, 2000 to February 1, 2002. It was nominated for Best Children's or Youth Series or Program at the 16th Gemini Awards in 2001. Jonathan Malen was nominated at the Young Artist's Awards. In the USA, it aired alongside other YTV imports (including Mystery Hunters and Strange Days at Blake Holsey High) on Discovery Kids. ==Titles== # Mystery at Lake Placid # The Night They Stole the Stanley Cup # The Screech Owls' Northern Adventure # Murder at Hockey Camp # Kidnapped in Sweden # Terror in Florida # The Quebec City Crisis # The Screech Owls' Home Loss # Nightmare in Nagano # Danger in Dinosaur Valley # The Ghost of the Stanley Cup # The West Coast Murders # Sudden Death in New York City # Horror on River Road # Death Down Under # Power Play in Washington # Secret of The Deep Woods # Murder at the Winter Games # Attack on the Tower of London # The Screech Owls' Reunion # Peril at the World's Biggest Hockey Tournament # Trouble at the Top of the World # Face-Off at the Alamo # Panic in Pittsburgh # The Mystery of the Russian Ransom # The Boston Breakout # Reality Check in Detroit ==References== ==External links== * Category:Series of books Category:Novels set in Ontario Category:Novels about ice hockey Category:Junior ice hockey in Canada Category:McClelland & Stewart books ",
