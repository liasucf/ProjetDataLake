A men's and women's tournament was held, with 2019 being the sixteenth edition of the men's South American Cricket Championship and the ninth edition of the women's event. Most matches played at the 2018 women's championship were granted Twenty20 International (T20I) status, and 2019 was the first time that matches in the men's event were eligible for T20I status, since the ICC granted Twenty20 International (T20I) status to matches between all of its Members. Mexico were the defending men's champions, while Brazil won the 2018 women's event. Brazil retained the women's title with a 100% records during the tournament, including a four- wicket win against Argentina in the final. ==Participating teams== Men: * * * * * * * Women: * * * * * ==Men's championship== The seven participating teams were the national sides of Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay.
