He met Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, and became deeply interested in the invention. The Franco-Prussian War had just begun and Carl Albert Unbehaun, with every other young German man, was called to enlist, which as someone opposed to all war, held no attractions and he notified the German authorities of his refusal to return to the Fatherland. For this, all his legal and civil rights were forfeit, and he worked his passage to Sydney, where his knowledge of the telephone system made him a useful employee. He entered the New South Wales Telegraph Department as instrument fitter to assist in the equipment of the operating room in the Sydney Post-Office, which was under construction. In 1876 he was head-hunted by Charles Todd for the position of electrical fitter in charge of the Postal Telegraph workshop in Adelaide, and Unbehaun left New South Wales for South Australia in 1877. He built and installed the instruments for the first telephonic communication in South Australia, conducted for the Post-office Department on Christmas Day, 1877. On 14 May 1883 Adelaide's first telephone exchange, with 48 subscribers, was officially established in a corner of the telegraph operating-room of the General Post Office, Adelaide. In 1884 he took charge of the Electrical Department. He became Inspector of Telephones, later styled \"Electrical Engineer and Inspector of Telephones\" in 1891. He was in charge of installation of electric lighting in Parliament House, North Terrace. With Federation and the unification of Telegraph departments in 1904, he was given the title of Electrical Engineer.D. A. Cumming and G.
