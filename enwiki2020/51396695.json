    "text": "The Danneskiold-Laurvig Mansion is a historic building situated at Store Kongensgade 68 in central Copenhagen, Denmark. It was built in association with the Moltke's Mansion in Bredgade on the other side of the block. ==History== === Danneskiold-Laurvig family=== The building seen on an illustration from Lauritz de Thurah's Hafnia Hodierna (1748) Rach & Engborg in 1749 Ferdinand Anton Danneskiold-Laurvig was the son of Ulrik Frederik Gyldenl\u00f8ve. When his father died in 1704 he inherited Gyldenl\u00f8ve's Little Mansion at the corner of Dronningens Tv\u00e6rgade and Bredgade as well as the County of Laurvig in Norway. He purchased a number of smaller lots in Store Kongensgade in the 1720s. It is unclear when the building at Store Kongensgade was built. Most sources state that it was most likely built to a design by 0 ohann Adam Soherr in circa 1745. Ida Haugsted states that it was more likely built in circa 1720-30 to designs by Johan Cornelius Krieger. Krieger was also responsible for adaptingh the Gyldenl\u00f8be Mansion. A garden connected the two buildings and the new building in Store Kongensgade was referred to as Danneskiold-Laurvig's backyard\" (Danneskiold-Laurvig's bagg\u00e5rd). The new building was also known as Jernmagasinet (\"The Iron Store\") since stoves and other products from Danneskiold-Laurvig's extensive Fritz\u00f8e iron works in Laurvig in Norway were sold from its ground floor. Frederik Ludvig Danneskiold-Laurvig succeeded his father in 1754. He died without children in 1762 and all his holdings were therefore transferred to his brother Christian Conrad Danneskiold-Laurvig (1723-1783). ===Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Coninck and Niels Lunde Reiersen=== The building was on 3 April 1783 sold to the merchants Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Coninck and Niels Lunde Reiersen for 46,000 rigsdaler. The building was at the time of the 1787 census home to three households with a total of 17 residents. Bookkeeper Thomas Christopher Radigend (76 y4s.) lived in the apartment in the western part of the ground floor with his second wife Anne (72 yrs.) and his sister's unmarried daughter Dorthea Helena (64 yrs.) as well as two maids. Counter Admiral ndreas Georg Herman Schultz (1718-1798) and his wife Anne Margrethe True (1737-1825) lived in the apartment on the first floor. The other members of their household were the 18-year-old girl Charlotte Lindemann (1767-1837) two maids and a servant. The 40-year-old clerk J\u00f8rn B\u00f8ttger and his 28-year-old wife Christiane lived with their three children as well as their 27-year-old maid and the property's caretaker Lars Larsen in the apartment on the second floor. ===Later owners=== Reiersen sold his share of the building complex in Bredgade-Store Kongensgade to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Coninck in 1789. Later that same year Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Coninck sold the Danneskiold-Laurvig Mansion to wine merchant Johan Ludwig Friederich Zinn. He was a nephew of Johann Ludvig Zinn with whom he stayed in the Zinn HOuse at the time of the 1787 census. ==Architecture == Glass mazaic above the gate, stating the year 1782 The Rococo-style mansion is 11 bays wide and has a median risalit decorated with pilasters.
