Amongst his research interests is a long-term concern with social inequality and the political representation of the working class, stemming to a large degree from his own background and early working years in Stoke. His other research examines political divisions between classes, religions and ethnic groups in a range of other societies including Northern Ireland and post-communist Eastern Europe. As a psychologist by training he examines the factors that shape how people understand and relate to politics and their place in society.
