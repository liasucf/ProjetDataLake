The team's home arena is Trade Union Sport Palace. The team used to play its home games at Konovalenko Sports Palace, named after Viktor Konovalenko \u2013 one of the most famous Soviet goaltenders, who played for Torpedo. ==History== The first official ice hockey tournament in Gorky (the Communist-era name of Nizhny Novgorod) took place in early 1947, when the team was the winner of the first Avtozavodtsev Cup. In the 1947\u201348 season, the team was in the national championship. It was the official sports club of the submarine service of the Soviet Navy. The 1960\u201361 season was the most significant in the history of Torpedo, with the team winning the Avtozavodtsev Cup and the Soviet Sport Cup, reaching the final of the Cup of the Soviet Union, and finally winning the silver medal in the national championship. Torpedo was the first provincial team to place in the USSR championship in 1961. Gorkovchan's success that year is attributed, primarily, to head coach Dmitry Boginova, who managed to create a strong and cohesive team in just a few years. Goalie Konovalenko was later a two-time Olympic champion and eight- time world champion. Twice the team fell just short of the bronze in 1982 and 1985. In the 1980s, Gorky twice won the Thunderstorm Authority prize. The Torpedo players in those years were constantly being called to different teams, with some seasons including the loss of up to ten players to other teams. In the championships of the MHL, RHL and Russia, which have been held since the Soviet collapse, Torpedo has not achieved significant success, with the best year in 1995, when the team placed fourth in the playoffs of the MHL championship. ==Season-by-season KHL record== Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, OTW = Overtime Wins, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOW = Shootout Wins, SOL = Shootout Losses, L = Losses, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, Pts = Points {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"text-align:center; font-size:small; background:#ddd; padding:5px;\"| | Season || GP || W || L || OTL || Pts || GF || GA || Finish || Top Scorer || Playoffs |- style=\"background:#eee;\" | 2008\u201309 || 56 || 24 || 24 || 1 || 84 || 162 || 162 || 3rd, Chernyshev || Pavel Brendl || Lost in preliminary round, 0-3 (Metallurg Magnitogorsk) |- bgcolor=\" | 2009\u201310 || 56 || 22 || 27 || 4 || 75 || 154 || 163 || 4th, Tarasov || Pavel Brendl || Did not qualify |- style=\"background:#eee;\" | 2010\u201311 || 54 || 18 || 25 || 2 || 73 || 144 || 151 || 5th, Tarasov || Matt Ellison || Did not qualify |- bgcolor=\" | 2011\u201312 || 54 || 24 || 17 || 2 || 91 || 157 || 132 || 1st, Tarasov || Martin Th\u00f6rnberg || Lost in Conference Semifinals, 2-4 (Dynamo Moscow) |- style=\"background:#eee;\" | 2012\u201313 || 52 || 19 || 23 || 4 || 69 || 142 || 146 || 6th, Tarasov || Dmitri Makarov || Did not qualify |- bgcolor=\" | 2013\u201314 || 54 || 32 || 17 || 5 || 91 || 153 || 121 || 3rd, Kharlamov || Sakari Salminen || Lost in Conference Quarterfinals, 3-4 (Salavat Yulaev Ufa) |- style=\"background:#eee;\" | 2014\u201315 || 60 || 30 || 22 || 8 || 90 || 153 || 144 || 4th, Tarasov || Sakari Salminen || Lost in Conference Quarterfinals, 1-4 (SKA St. Petersburg) |- bgcolor=\" | 2015\u201316 || 60 || 33 || 16 || 11 || 100 || 163 || 137 || 5th, Tarasov || Kaspars Daugavi\u0146\u0161 || Lost in Conference Semifinals, 1-4 (CSKA Moscow) |- style=\"background:#eee;\" | 2016\u201317 || 60 || 32 || 18 || 7 || 104 || 145 || 124 || 4th, Tarasov || Dmitri Semin || Lost in Conference Quarterfinals, 1-4 (Dynamo Moscow) |- bgcolor=\" | 2017\u201318 || 56 || 29 || 19 || 8 || 89 || 116 || 127 || 3rd, Tarasov || Egor Dugin || Lost in Conference Quarterfinals, 0-4 (Lokomotiv Yaroslavl) |- style=\"background:#eee;\" | 2018\u201319 || 62 || 27 || 25 || 10 || 64 || 176 || 193 || 4th, Kharlamov || Andrew Calof || Lost in Conference Quarterfinals, 3-4 (Barys Astana) |- bgcolor=\" | 2019\u201320 || 62 || 29 || 27 || 6 || 64 || 165 || 167 || 4th, Tarasov || Jordan Schroeder || Lost in Conference Quarterfinals, 0-4 (CSKA Moscow) |} ==Players== ===Current roster=== ===NHL alumni=== Yuri Butsayev, formerly of Torpedo * Evgeny Namestnikov (1988\u201391) * Pavel Torgaev (1995\u201396, 1999\u20132000) * Alexei Tezikov (1998\u20132000, 2001\u201302) * Artem Chubarov (1999\u20132004) * Yuri Butsayev (2007\u201309) * Matt Ellison (2010\u20132013) * Ryan Vesce (2010\u20132012) * Wojtek Wolski (2013\u20132015) ===All-time records=== *RSL/KHL Games \u2013 Anatoli Vodopianov \u2013 653 games *Games \u2013 Oleg Namestnikov, 720 games *RSL/KHL Goals \u2013 Alexander Skvortsov, 244 *RSL/KHL Assists \u2013 Alexander Skvortsov, 204 *RSL/KHL Points \u2013 Alexander Skvortsov, 448 *PIM \u2013 Vladimir Kovin \u2013 570 minutes ==Honours== ===Champions=== Vysshaya Liga (2): 2003, 2007 Steel Cup (1): 2015 Dukla Cup (1): 2016 Bodense Cup (1): 2017 ===Runners-up=== Soviet League Championship (1): 1961 USSR Cup (1): 1961 Spengler Cup (1): 1972 ==References== ==External links== *HC Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod official website Category:Ice hockey teams in Russia Category:Sport in Nizhny Novgorod Category:Kontinental Hockey League teams Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1946 Category:1946 establishments in the Soviet Union ",
