He studied at Kashan and Shiraz, before going to Deccan in India. He then became friends with Shahnavaz Khan of Shiraz (d. 1611), a court official to Ebrahim Adelshah II, the ruler of Bijapur. His first trip to India did not bring him the success he desired, and he was imprisoned for a while due to chargers of being a spy. In 1619 he returned to Iran, placing high hopes of Iranian patrons. He became nostalgic for India (who he was genuinely fond of) and returned in 1621. Until 1628 he was at Agra in the service of Mir Jomla of Shahrestan, who himself was a poet with the pen name of Ruh- al-Amin). He address Ruh al-Amin in several panegyrics. In 1628, due to some eulogies of Abu-al-\u1e24asan \u0100\u1e63af Khan, he became a member of the Mogul emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628-58). He impressed the Shah Jahan so much that in 1632 he was bestowed the title of(Malek al-\u0161o\u02bfar\u0101). ==Works== His works amount to 24,000 lines, about 15,000 couplet in his version of the Shah-nama and 9,500 couplets in his Divan.
