    "text": "Michael Edwards (born 5 December 1963), known as \"Eddie the Eagle\", is an English ski-jumper and Olympian who in 1988 became the first competitor since 1928 to represent Great Britain in Olympic ski jumping, finishing last in the 70 m and 90 m events. He held the British ski jumping record from 1988 to 2001. He also took part in amateur speed skiing, running at , and a stunt jumping world record holder for jumping over 6 buses. In 2016, he was portrayed by Taron Egerton in the biographical film Eddie the Eagle. ==Background== Edwards was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. His family calls him by his given name, Michael. \"Eddie\" is a nickname derived by schoolfriends from his surname.Edwards 2016, Chapter 2. Having not made the grade as a downhill skier, he switched to ski jumping as there were no other British ski jumpers with whom to compete for a place. Edwards began jumping under the eye of John Viscome and Chuck Berghorn in Lake Placid, New York, using Berghorn's equipment, although he had to wear six pairs of socks to make the boots fit. He was disadvantaged by his weight\u2014at about 82 kg (181 lb, 12st 13lb), more than 9 kg (20 lb) heavier than the next heaviest competitor\u2014and by his lack of financial support for training, being totally self-funded. Another problem was that he was very farsighted, wearing thick glasses under his goggles, which would mist up at altitude. Edwards first represented Great Britain at the 1987 World Championships in Oberstdorf in Bavaria, West Germany and was ranked 55th in the world. This performance qualified him as the sole British applicant for the 1988 Winter Olympics ski jumping competition. He received confirmation of his qualification for the games while working as a plasterer and temporarily residing in a Finnish mental hospital, due to lack of funds for alternative accommodation rather than as a patient.Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards \u2013 Olympic legend YouTube Edwards' jump of 71m at Calgary in the Winter Olympics was then a British record (now 134.50m held by Halifax born Sam Bolton). His Olympic jump still puts him sixth on the all-time list of British ski jumpers. ==1988 Winter Olympics== During the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Edwards competed in and finished last in both the 70 m and 90 m events. In the 70 m, he scored 69.2 points from two jumps of 61.0 m; second- last Bernat Sol\u00e0 Pujol of Spain scored 140.4 points from 71 m and 68.5 m jumps; winner Matti Nyk\u00e4nen of Finland had 229.1 points from 89.5 m jumps. In the 90 m, Edwards scored 57.5 points from 71 m and 67 m jumps; second-last Todd Gilman of Canada had 110.8 points from 96 m and 86.5 m; Nyk\u00e4nen won again, with 224 points from 118.5 m and 107 m. From the beginning, the press version of his story was \"embroidered with falsehoods\". \"They said I was afraid of heights. But I was doing sixty jumps a day then, which is hardly something someone who was afraid of heights would do.\" His lack of success endeared him to people around the globe. He subsequently became a media celebrity and appeared on talk shows around the world, appearing on The Tonight Show during the Games. The press nicknamed him \"Mr. Magoo\", and one Italian journalist called him a \"ski dropper\". At the closing ceremony, the president of the Organizing Committee, Frank King, singled out Edwards for his contribution. King said, looking at the competitors, \"You have broken world records and you have established personal bests. Some of you have even soared like an eagle.\" ===\"Eddie the Eagle\" Rule=== Following the widespread attention that Edwards received in Calgary shortly after the Olympics finished, the entry requirements were strengthened in order to make it nearly impossible for anyone to follow his example: the International Olympic Committee (IOC) instituted what became known as the Eddie the Eagle Rule, which requires Olympic hopefuls to compete in international events and be placed in the top 30% or the top 50 competitors, whichever is fewer. Edwards failed to qualify for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, and the 1994 Games in Lillehammer, Norway. He got a five-year sponsorship from Eagle Airlines, a small British charter company, to support his attempt to reach the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan, but failed to qualify for those as well. ==Return to Calgary and other media appearances== On 13 February 2008, Edwards made a return visit to Calgary to take part in festivities marking the twentieth anniversary of the Games. During his visit, he rode the zip-line at Canada Olympic Park with a member of the Jamaican bobsled team (the ride simulates the speed of a ski-jumper) and led a procession of skiers down the slopes of the park while carrying an Olympic torch.Zip-line ride: Global News Calgary (television broadcast), 13 February 2008 Edwards was chosen as a torchbearer in the relay for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. He ran with the torch on 7 January 2010 in Winnipeg. Edwards released a book (and a video) called On the Piste. In 1991 he recorded a single in Finnish entitled \"Mun nimeni on Eetu\" (\"My name is Eetu\"), B-sided with \"Eddien Siivell\u00e4\" (\"On Eddie's Wing\") though he does not speak Finnish. Edwards learned the lyrics phonetically and the song reached no.2 in the Finnish charts. The songs were written by Finnish singer Irwin Goodman. In the same year (1991) Edwards completed a charity ski jump at a ski slope in Christchurch, Dorset. He raised \u00a323000.00 for BBC Children in Need by jumping over 10 cars using a ski jump made of scaffolding. Edwards appeared in a number of advertising campaigns, e.g. on television, promoting cars, and commanded fees of \u00a310,000 an hour. Nevertheless, he declared bankruptcy in 1992, claiming that a trust fund for his earnings was not set up properly. In 2003, he graduated from De Montfort University in Leicester with a degree in law. \"I've been interested in law since taking out a civil action against my trustees 10 years ago,\" he said in a 2001 interview. On 25 February 2012, he appeared as a competitor on episode 2 of BBC1's Let's Dance for Sport Relief, 2012 and got through to the final on most public votes. His performances were accompanied by the Royal British Legion Band & Corps Of Drums Romford. In 2013, he won the first series of the British celebrity diving programme Splash!, mentored by Tom Daley. In January 2014, he commentated on the Channel 4 TV programme The Jump, where 12 famous people took part in winter sports. As part of each episode, Edwards jumped off the largest of three ski jumps. In the same year he appeared as a guest on the ITV2 comedy show Fake Reaction. Edwards prior to his first jumps in 15 years at the site of the 1988 Winter Olympics. Riding Ski Jump lift again 29 years later. In 2017, he returned to the ski jumping facilities at Canada Olympic Park, where he had taken part in the Olympics in 1988, to make some jumps that were his first in over 15 years. ==Biopic== A film chronicling the life story of Edwards had been planned by Irish director Declan Lowney since 2007. Comedian Steve Coogan was originally chosen for the title role. Edwards was said to be pleased with the choice but also joked that Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise would be better suited for the role. In 2009, Lowney announced that Rupert Grint would instead play the part. The film was scheduled to begin production once Grint completed work on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1 and Part 2, but it did not go ahead. On 23 December 2014, it was reported that Gary Barlow was in talks to write the entire soundtrack for the film. On 23 January 2015, it was reported that Edwards might perform the stunts in the movie about his life. Matthew Vaughn produced and Dexter Fletcher directed the biopic, starring Taron Egerton as Edwards, and Hugh Jackman as his trainer. The film, Eddie the Eagle, was released in early 2016. ==See also== * Eric Moussambani: Eric \"the Eel\", another famously unlikely Olympian * Philip Boit * Trevor Misipeka * Vinko Bogataj * Steven Bradbury * Elizabeth Swaney ==Bibliography== * ==References== ==External links== * * * * BBC Gloucestershire interview with Eddie \"The Eagle\" Edwards February 2008 * Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards Speaking Profile and Video *Eddie The Eagle 1991 Charity Ski Jump Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of De Montfort University Category:English non-fiction writers Category:English pop singers Category:English male ski jumpers Category:Musicians from Gloucestershire Category:Olympic ski jumpers of Great Britain Category:Sportspeople from Cheltenham Category:Ski jumpers at the 1988 Winter Olympics Category:English male non-fiction writers ",
