In a 2007 video interview, the Anchorage Station Manager stated that the DC-6 was still considered to be a valuable aircraft for operations in the harsh conditions of Alaska, with excellent landing and takeoff performance on gravel runways. The downside is the difficulty to find Avgas and the maintenance labor cost. Everts Air Cargo estimates a ratio of 12 hours of maintenance for every single flying hour. Spare parts could also be a problem but Everts Air Cargo anticipates they will have enough in stock to keep the last DC-6 flying beyond 2020. ==References== 1- == External links == * Everts Air Cargo Category:1993 establishments in Alaska Category:Airlines in Alaska Category:Cargo airlines of the United States Category:Companies based in Fairbanks, Alaska Category:Airlines established in 1993 ",
