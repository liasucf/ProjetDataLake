    "text": "Pasila station (, ; previous Swedish name was Fredriksberg until 1990) is a railway station in Helsinki, Finland, approximately north of Helsinki Central. It is the second busiest railway station in Finland, after Helsinki Central, and takes up a large part of the district of Pasila. The station was first opened in 1862. The current (and fourth) station building opened in 2019. Pasila station is used to ease the congestion on the city's central station by serving as an alternate point of departure or arrival within Helsinki. All trains, both long-distance and local, travelling to and from Helsinki stop at Pasila. Pasila station is one of two stations in Helsinki to serve long- distance traffic, the other being the central station. All other stations in Helsinki only serve local traffic. In terms of train lines, the only differences between Pasila station and the central station are the smaller number of tracks with platforms (10 compared to 19). In 2012, the loading and unloading of cars onto trains was moved from Helsinki Central to a new car terminal built north of Pasila. The station was under extensive renovation from 2015 to 2019.Santapakka, Sanna-Leena: Pasila myll\u00e4t\u00e4\u00e4n uusiksi miljardilla - t\u00e4lt\u00e4 se n\u00e4ytt\u00e4\u00e4 tulevaisuudessa, Ilta-Sanomat 6 February 2014.
