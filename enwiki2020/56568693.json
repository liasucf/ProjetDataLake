He brought the DMA to world attention when he provided the Global Geospatial Information System (GGIS) to President Clinton's Dayton Peace Accord to settle the boundaries of Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, and Kosovo. The leaders saw three-dimensional satellite imagery and mapping data of their nations, enabling them to quickly resolve boundary issues. As director, Nuber oversaw the agency's reinvention task force. Initiated by Nuber's predecessor, Major General Raymund E. O'Mara, the task force sought to transform the DMA from a map provider to a timely source of geospatial information and services. It presented Nuber with a proposal for a completely restructured agency based on three groups: Operations, Acquisition and Technology, and Installation. He embraced and implemented the changes, profoundly changing the DMA and enhancing its talent and tradecraft. Nuber retired June 1, 1996; after 34 years of service. ==Death== Nuber died of cancer on May 21, 2003. ==Awards and decorations== Nuber had more than 4,200 flying hours and was a veteran of three hundred combat missions.
