He went on to stay for six consecutive seasons with the club, featuring in 154 official matches and scoring 18 goals. During the 2011\u201312 season, Romano suffered ACL rupture,\u03a3\u03bf\u03ba \u03bc\u03b5 \u03a1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf thus being unable to help his club avoid relegation to the Football League after six straight seasons in top-flight. He was one of the few club veterans to follow Ergotelis in the Football League, captaining the club and leading them to instant promotion back to top-flight. In his final season with the club, Romano captained the team to its best-ever 7th place finish in the 2013\u221214 Greek Superleague. However, as the club's board of directors decided to cut down on the team's budget and offer key players new contracts with reduced pay, Romano decided to part ways with Ergotelis on July 17, 2014. ===Iraklis=== Four days after his release from Ergotelis on July 21 2014, Romano signed a two-year contract with Greek Football League club Iraklis. He made his debut for Iraklis in a Greek Cup match against Lamia. Romano was joined by fellow countryman Emanuel Perrone, and the duo majorly contributed to Iraklis' return to the Greek Superleague during the 2014\u201315 Football League season. After playing for Iraklis during the 2015\u201316 Superleague season, both players mutually terminated their contracts with the club in May 2016. ===Apollon Smyrni=== On 25 June 2016, Romano joined Football League club Apollon Smyrni on a one-year deal until the summer of 2017.\u0395\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03c7\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03a1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf \u03bf \u0391\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03a3\u03bc\u03cd\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 He once again helped his club earn promotion to the Superleague, this time as division champions. He featured in 23 matches for Apollon, and scored one goal in his club's 2016\u201317 Football League championship run. ===Ethnikos Piraeus=== In July 2017, Romano signed with Gamma Ethniki side Ethnikos Piraeus.\u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03bf \u039d\u03c4\u03b9\u03ad\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf \u03a1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Ergotelis |2008\u201309 |rowspan=\"4\"|Superleague Greece |26||2||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||27||2 |- |2009\u201310 |24||1||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||25||1 |- |2010\u201311 |28||5||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||29||5 |- |2011\u201312 |8||2||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||8||2 |- |2012\u201313 |Football League Greece |37||6||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||37||6 |- |2013\u201314 |Superleague Greece |26||2||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||28||2 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total !149!!18!!5!!0!!colspan=2|\u2014!!154!!18 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Iraklis |2014\u201315 |Football League Greece |20||2||11||2||7Football League Play-Offs||0||38||4 |- |2015\u201316 |Superleague Greece |20||3||4||0||colspan=2|\u2014||24||3 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total !40!!5!!15!!2!!7!!0!!62!!7 |- |Apollon Smyrni |2016\u201317 |Football League Greece |23||1||3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||26||1 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total !23!!1!!3!!0!!colspan=2|\u2014!!26!!1 |- |Ethnikos Piraeus |2017\u201318 |Gamma Etniki Greece |14||2||colspan=2|\u2014||1Piraeus FCA Cup||0||15||2 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total !14!!2!!colspan=2|\u2014!!1!!0!!15!!2 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !226!!26!!23!!2!!8!!0!!257!!28 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Apollon Smyrni *Football League: 2016\u201317 ===Individual=== *Football League Best Player: 2012\u221213 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine footballers Category:Newell's Old Boys footballers Category:Tiro Federal footballers Category:Club Almagro players Category:Chacarita Juniors footballers Category:San Mart\u00edn de Tucum\u00e1n footballers Category:Ergotelis F.C. players Category:Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. players Category:Apollon Smyrnis F.C. players Category:Ethnikos Piraeus F.C. players Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Super League Greece players Category:Football League (Greece) players Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Association football midfielders ",
