The kende (or k\u00fcnd\u00fc) was one of the kings of the dual-monarchy of the early Hungarians along with the gyula or war-chief. The function of the kende is believed to have been a religious one (\"sacral prince\").Victor Spinei, The Great Migrations in the East and South East of Europe from the Ninth to the Thirteenth Century: Hungarians, Pechenegs and Uzes, Hakkert, 2006, p. 42Kevin Alan Brook, The Jews of Khazaria, Rowman & Littlefield, 2009, p. 253 At the time of the Magyar migration to Pannonia, the kende was named Kursz\u00e1n. Upon Kursz\u00e1n's death in a raid in approximately 904 CE, the office was taken up by the gyula \u00c1rp\u00e1d, creating a single-head monarchy for Hungary. Though there are some scholars (for example Gyula Krist\u00f3) who believe that \u00c1rp\u00e1d was the kende, who later took up the functions of the gyula. Some scholars have speculated that the early Magyar dual kingship derived from their time as vassals of the Khazars. Indeed, the Khazars were described by Ahmad ibn Fadlan as having an officer titled K\u00fcnd\u00fcr which may have been either identical to, model for or the forerunner of the office of kende. == House of Kende == Kende also refers to the noble Hungarian House of Kende settled in the eastern region of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy of K\u00f6lcse. In 1181 the family received several settlements from the king: K\u00f6lcse, Istv\u00e1ndi, K\u00f3r\u00f3d, Cs\u00e9cse, Cseke, Milota, Cz\u00e9g\u00e9ny. ==Sources== * Nagy Iv\u00e1n, \"Magyarorsz\u00e1g csal\u00e1dai (Houses of Hungary)\" * Borovszky Samu, \"Szatm\u00e1r v\u00e1rmegye (The County of Szatm\u00e1r)\" ==References== Category:Magyar tribal chieftains Category:Hungarian prehistory ",
