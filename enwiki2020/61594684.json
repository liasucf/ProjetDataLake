Twenty years after the album was originally released, the track \"Raise Your Hand\" was remixed by various DJ's and released as \"Raise Your Hand (U Got To)\" from different labels in 2005. == Critical reception == People (May 12, 1986): > Ike's original songs are mixed with tightly knit arrangements of R&B; > standards \u2014 \"I Know (You Don't Want Me No More)\" and \"Shake a Hand.\" Ike's > lyrics often are swaggering, especially on the title cut, but Tina sings > them with palpable conviction... Tunes such as Ike\u2019s \"Bootsie Whitelaw\" and > Troy Seals and Don Goodman's \"Mississippi Rolling Stone\" are poignant > reminders of Ike's and Tina's productive if sometimes tumultuous years > together. They also show that as dynamic as Tina is today, nobody ever got > more out of her musically than Ike.\" == Track listing == All tracks written by Ike Turner, except where noted. == References == Category:1985 compilation albums Category:1986 compilation albums Category:Ike & Tina Turner compilation albums Category:Albums produced by Ike Turner ",
