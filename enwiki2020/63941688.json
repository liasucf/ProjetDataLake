Songs of his heroic exploits were was sung by the famous guslar Filip Vi\u0161nji\u0107 in the song \"Battle of Loznica\". Today one of the primary schools in Loznica bears his name. ==First Serbian Uprising== Antonije Bogi\u0107evi\u0107, though born in Serbia, his ancestors came from Bosnia. During the First Serbian Uprising, he joined the insurgents and worked in organizing the government and supplying the army. He was appointed duke in 1807 of Jadar defending this troubled area from Turkish incursions from Bosnia and Herzegovina. He fought the Turks in Krupanj, Rozaje, Ra\u0111evo Polje, and most often in Loznica, where several bloody battles were fought with the Bosnian Turkish army. He was wounded in one of those fights. The most significant was the battle for Loznica, fought on the 5 and 6 October 1810, according to the old calendar. Under Ali Pasha Vidaji\u0107, 30,000 Turks descended along the Drina in riverboats called \u0161ajkato the Ti\u010dar field near Loznica. The fortified city wall was defended by 1,200 Serbs, led by the Duke of Loznica, Antonije \"Anta\" Bogi\u0107evi\u0107. The siege lasted twelve days. Assessing that he could not resist the Turkish attacks, Duke Anta turned to Luka Lazarevi\u0107 for help. According to the report on the siege of Loznica, and after Kara\u0111or\u0111e dislodged Hashid Pasha from Morava, he hurried to help with almost the entire army from \u0160umadija and 200 Cossacks. It seems that Kara\u0111or\u0111e estimated that the most decisive battle in 1810 would ultimately take place right there. The importance of Kara\u0111or\u0111e attached to the battle is also shown by the letter sent to Petar Dobrnjac asking him for reinforcements: \"Don't hesitate for a minute. Every minute is worth it, I really care if the army arrives on the Drina a minute earlier.\" Luka Lazarevi\u0107 and Jakov Nenadovi\u0107 came to the rescue with the army of the \u0160abac and Valjevo districts. The decisive battle began on the morning of 6 October 1810. Kara\u0111or\u0111e later informed Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 about this: \"Both the Turks and we went out into the field, and a bloody fight ensued with cannons and rifles ablaze that after eight hours there was no greater than this battle.\" This victory of the Serbian army is one of the most significant in the First Serbian Uprising. When Duke Anta Bogi\u0107evi\u0107 died in 1813, his son Bogosav Bogi\u0107evi\u0107 was appointed duke. He was buried in Loznica on the trench, but the Turks took out his body, cut off his head and threw his body into the river \u0160tira. However, patriots later secretly removed his bones and buried him next to the church in Loznica. His daughter Tomanija married Jevrem Obrenovi\u0107, and his son Milo\u0161 was killed by Toma Vu\u010di\u0107 Peri\u0161i\u0107 when he quelled the Katan rebellion in 1844. The grandson of Tomanija and Jevrem Obrenovi\u0107 became the first king of modern Serbia, Milan Obrenovi\u0107 IV. ==Legacy== There is a public school in Serbia named after him. ==See also== * List of Serbian Revolutionaries == References == * Translated and adapted from Serbian Wikipedia: \u0410\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u0438\u045b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b Category:1758 births Category:1813 deaths Category:People from Loznica Category:People of the Second Serbian Uprising Category:Serbian military leaders Category:Serbian revolutionaries Category:19th-century Serbian people ",
