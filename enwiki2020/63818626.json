She testified as a community witness for the Philippines Commission on Human Rights as part of their investigation into corporate responsibility and whether the effects of climate change can be considered violations of Filipinos\u2019 human rights. == Background == Impact of Typhoon Haiyan, The Philippines (2013)Ubaldo (born 1997) is from Manila in the Philippines. Her father is a fisherman. Before 2013, Ubaldo had been a youth leader at Plan International, an organisation that aims to promote children and female rights.

In November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan brought winds of up to 275 km/h (170 mph) and waves of up to 15m (45ft), particularly affecting low-lying regions of the Philippines. Over 6000 people were killed in the disaster and 28,000 injured. Scientists have stated that severe weather events such as this typhoon, are being exacerbated or made more likely by increasing global temperatures.Since Ubaldo\u2019s first-hand experience of Typhoon Haiyan, she has continued her climate activism, lobbing governments on these issues. == Activism == Ubaldo advocates for a ban on single-use plastics, the reduction of carbon emissions and investment in renewable energy. In 2015, Ubaldo spoke at the United Nations (UN) Climate Conference where she said \u2018\"please think about us, think about the coming generations who will suffer because you did not make decisions in time\"'. Ubaldo has stated that fighting climate change is the \u2018purpose of my life\u2019. In October 2019, Ubaldo attended a climate leadership training event in Yokohama, Japan, established by Al Gore. She also spoke at various Japanese universities. Ubaldo has said that: > \u2018First World countries\u2026[could] stop fueling climate change, and change > business practices so your carbon emission could be lessened\u2026These countries > should be responsible and be held accountable. It\u2019s so unfair for people, > for nations like the Philippines, to suffer from a phenomenon that we > haven\u2019t caused.\u2019 Ubaldo says that fossil fuel companies should not be allowed to dictate the response to climate change. She says she remains optimistic that strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change can be developed. == External Links == * https://plan-uk.org/ * https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/take- action/w4r-2019-philippines-marinel-ubaldo/ == References == Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Youth activists ",
