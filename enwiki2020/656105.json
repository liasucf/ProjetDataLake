Pixy Stix is a registered trademark of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Vevey, Switzerland. The candy is usually poured into the mouth from the wrapper, which is made out of plastic or paper. Pixy Stix contain dextrose, citric acid, and artificial and natural flavors. == History == Pixy Stix was invented by Sunline Inc. in St. Louis, Missouri. The concept for this powdered candy originated in 1942 and was derived from a penny drink mix sold as Fruzola Jr. by the Fruzola Company in Salt Lake City, Utah. When J. Fish Smith found that children were eating the sweet and sour powder straight from the package, he modified the formula and branded it as Lik-M-Aid. An affiliated company, Fruzola Company of St. Louis, which later became Sunline, Inc., was founded in 1952 by Menlo F. Smith to manufacture and market Lik-M-Aid nationwide. In 1959, the product was packaged in color-striped straws and introduced as Pixy Stix. Several years later, Lik-M-Aid was modified with a multi-compartment package containing two flavors and a candy stick used to dip the candy out of the package, thereby dubbed Fun Dip. Pixy Stix are currently manufactured by Nestl\u00e9 Candy Shop (formerly Wonka Confections), a division of Nestle. ==Flavors== * Grape * Maui Punch (blue) * Orange * Cherry * Raspberry * Strawberry * Cucumber watermelon * Mango Lime * Pineapple ==See also== * Sherbet \u2013 a fizzy powder similar to that found in Pixy Stix ==References== Category:The Willy Wonka Candy Company brands Category:Products introduced in 1952 Category:Brand name confectionery Category:Candy ",
