The club folded in 1900, and a replacement, Brighton & Hove Rangers was formed. Rangers were elected to the Southern League in 1901, but disbanded.

He was visiting Lewes and the pair told his wife; \"We are going to the station to meet your husband, and you must consider yourself lucky if he is brought home alive!\".
