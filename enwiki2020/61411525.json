    "text": "Za Za Bazaar World Banquet & Bar is a chain of two buffet restaurants in the United Kingdom, situated in the cities of Bristol and Newcastle. The first restaurant opened in Bristol's Harbourside area just before Christmas in 2011. Its construction lasted thirteen weeks, and cost \u00a33 million. It was billed as the largest restaurant in the United Kingdom, and seats 1,000 people, eclipsing Croydon's Cosmo restaurant in size, which seats 800. It was established with the plan to open another seven \"super restaurants\" across the United Kingdom, in an investment of \u00a310m, that was rumoured to create 1,000 jobs in eighteen months. However, the expansion did not materialise, and a planned restaurant in Norwich has yet to be built. The food is split into the main categories of Far East, Tex Mex, European and Indian. == References == == External links == * (https://twitter.com/ZaZaBazaar Za Za Bazaar) on Twitter Category:Restaurant groups in the United Kingdom Category:Restaurants established in 2011 Category:Buffet restaurants ",
