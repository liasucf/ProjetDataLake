    "text": "Alexander N. GreenDirectory of the One Hundred and Fifteenth Congress (born September 1, 1947) is an American lawyer and politician. Green has served in Congress as the Representative for Texas's 9th congressional district since 2005. The 9th district includes most of southwestern Houston, part of Fort Bend County and most of Missouri City. Green is a member of the Democratic Party. ==Early life and early career== Green was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He attended Florida A&M; University and Tuskegee University. He received a Juris Doctor degree in 1974 from Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. After law school, Green co-founded the law firm of Green, Wilson, Dewberry, and Fitch. He remained in Houston and lives in the community of Alief. In 1978, Green was elected justice of the peace in Harris County, Texas. He held this position for 26 years before retiring in 2004. Green ran for mayor of Houston in 1981, and finished fifth in the Democratic primary. == U.S. House of Representatives == === Elections === In 2004, Green entered the Democratic primary for the 9th congressional district. The 9th district had previously been the 25th congressional district and was represented by Democrat Chris Bell. A 2003 Texas redistricting placed Bell's seat in jeopardy. Although the redistricted 25th district remained heavily Democratic, it had a significantly larger percentage of blacks and Latinos than the old 25th district, which had been 65% white. The new 9th was 17% white, 37% black and 33% Latino. The redistricting left Bell, who is white, vulnerable to a primary challenge from a black or Latino Democrat. Green won the March 9 primary with 66% of the vote to Bell's 31%. He then defeated Republican nominee Annette Molina in the general election. Green was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced only a Libertarian opponent in 2008. The 9th district is heavily Democratic, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+29. It is Houston's most Democratic district. Hillary Clinton carried the 9th district in 2016 with 79.3% of the vote, her strongest showing in Texas. === Tenure === In Congress, Green has focused on the same issues he worked on at the Houston NAACP: fair housing and fair hiring practices for the poor and minorities. After the 2012 election, Green held a press conference in Houston at which he emphasized the need for the lame duck Congress to work together to reform the national budget. He also announced a plan for infrastructure investments across the country intended to create jobs and unify the country and improve the economy. Green has supported the Federal Reserve's program of quantitative easing and claims it has led to economic recovery since the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. Congressman Al Green's Floor Speech on the Impeachment of President Trump On May 17, 2017, Green presented articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, citing Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey. Immediately after his speech, he shelved the document without calling for a vote, but continued to call for impeachment. He reintroduced articles of impeachment on July 16, 2019, citing Trump's attacks on four Democratic congresswomen of color. As a privileged resolution, the House was required to vote on it.Al Green impeachment resolution text On July 17 the House voted to table the resolution, effectively killing it. The vote was 332\u201395, with 95 Democrats (40%) voting against the resolution and four Republicans for it.Trump impeachment House vote ===Committee assignments=== *Committee on Financial Services **United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (Chair) **United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit ===Caucuses=== *Congressional Black Caucus *Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus *Congressional Maritime Caucus *Congressional Urban Caucus *Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus *Congressional Natural Gas Caucus *Congressional Ports Caucus *Congressional Science, Technology, Education and Math (STEM) Caucus *Congressional After School Caucus *Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus *Congressional Military Family Caucus *Congressional Children's Caucus *Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans *Congressional Arts Caucus *Afterschool Caucuses *U.S.-Japan Caucus *Congressional Pakistan Caucus ==Political positions== Green has expressed strong liberal views on social issues. Green is pro-choice, and consistently votes against restrictions on abortion. On October 13, 2011, he voted against an amendment to the Affordable Care Act, which prevented insurance programs created by the Act from covering abortions. He has voted against eight other bills proposed in the House that would if enacted prevent the federal government from covering the cost of abortions. He has received a 100% ratings from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America, while receiving a 0% rating from the National Right to Life Committee. Green also supports gun control. He spoke out after the Trayvon Martin shooting, asking members of the African-American community to show faith in the justice system and let the courts do their job and convict George Zimmerman. The National Rifle Association gave him a rating of 0%, Gun Owners of America rated him 25%, while the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gave him a Lifetime Score of 83%. On budget issues, Green follows his party's views. He supported every budget bill proposed during President Obama's term. During President Bush's term, Green voted against all budget bills that cut government spending and cut taxes. He also voted for Obama's bailout of the Auto Industry in 2009. On December 10, 2008, he wrote a statement supporting the auto bailout, saying, \"The auto bailout is really about bailing out people, and the people of this country... I think that [how tax dollars are spent] is a legitimate concern for the American people, but I do think, with the proper strings attached, we can bail out the people...who may lose their jobs.\" Green is a member of the Congressional Pakistan Caucus. He is a strong supporter of holding Pakistan as an ally in South Asia. After the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on December 27, 2007, which initially destabilized the country as riots erupted, Green issued a statement condemning the assassination as a \"dastardly effort to circumvent the democratic process.\" He announced his support of the US's continued alliance with Pakistan, and urged Pakistanis to continue their push towards true democracy, \"knowing that freedom, justice, and democracy are difficult to achieve.\" On December 6, 2017, Green denounced Trump for \"casting contempt on transgender individuals, inciting hate and hostility, and sowing discord among the people of the United States on the basis of gender.\"https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hres646/BILLS-115hres646lth.pdf Green is a member of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. ==Sexual misconduct allegations== In 2008, former staffer Lucinda Daniels accused Green of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace, including claims that Green discriminated against Daniels after she refused to continue to have sex with him. Daniels filed a lawsuit against Green and then withdrew it. Green filed a counter-lawsuit, alleging Daniels had threatened to sue Green for workplace discrimination if Green did not pay her money. Green subsequently withdrew his suit. The Hill reported that a spokesman for Green said the two had had a \"romantic encounter\" in 2007, but that the allegations of sexual harassment were untrue. In 2017, ten years after the allegations were made and withdrawn, Green released a joint statement with Daniels detailing their relationship at a time when several other congressmen were facing accusations of sexual misconduct. == Financial Services Committee 2019 == During the House Financial Services Committee hearing on April 10, 2019, at which the CEOs of all the major banks and investment institutions of the United States where sworn to testify, Green presented several questions that were regarded as controversial. He began by asking why all the executives were white men, then asked whether they hypothetically saw themselves succeeded in the future by men of color or women, repeatedly asking them to raise and lower their hands. Green then asked J. P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon whether the institution he chaired had profited from slavery, to which Dimon responded that that had taken place more than two centuries ago. The lack of connection between Green's inquiries and the topic of the hearing, the effects of the post-financial crisis on the major American banks, was interpreted as digression. ==See also== *List of African-American United States Representatives ==References== ==External links== *Congressman Al Green official U.S. House website *Al Green for Congress * * |- Category:1947 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:African-American lawyers Category:African-American members of the United States House of Representatives Category:African-American people in Texas politics Category:American justices of the peace Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Baptists from Texas Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:Living people Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Texas Category:People from Houston Category:Texas Democrats Category:Texas lawyers Category:Texas Southern University alumni Category:Thurgood Marshall School of Law alumni Category:Tuskegee University alumni Category:American gun control activists ",
