After the execution of the plan during the turn of the 20th to the 21st century, the station was not built. In 2010, the plan returned in the CPTM Director Plan, scheduled to be built in 2025, with a daily average of 8,119 passengers. Recently, the construction company Brookfield Brasil raised a set of business buildings named 17007 Na\u00e7\u00f5es, next to Line 9 and Marginal Pinheiros. As a counterpart of impact on traffic, because it is considered a traffic generator pole, Brookfield proposed the construction of Jo\u00e3o Dias station. On 1 March 2019, an agreement was signed between CPTM and Brookfield (through its dealership Tegra) predicting the donation of the station project and required area for it. The project predicts the implementation of Jo\u00e3o Dias station between Granja Julieta and Santo Amaro. Construction began in April 2020 and the station is expected to be opened in the second half of 2022. ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Proposed railway stations in Brazil ",
