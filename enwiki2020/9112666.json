In 1437, the Szczuka noble family of the Grabie coat of arms purchased the land, on which they founded the village, which was initially named Szczuki-Litwa.S\u0142ownik geograficzny Kr\u00f3lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj\u00f3w s\u0142owia\u0144skich, Tom XI, Warszawa, 1890, p. 862 (in Polish) Thanks to the efforts of Stanis\u0142aw Antoni Szczuka, Szczuczyn was granted town rights around 1690 by Polish King John III Sobieski.S\u0142ownik geograficzny Kr\u00f3lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj\u00f3w s\u0142owia\u0144skich, Tom XI, p. 863 Szczuka brought the Piarists to the town and a Baroque Piarist church and monastery complex was built, which remains the greatest landmark of the town. Szczuka also built a Piarist college, for which the Polish King established a scholarship fund. Szczuczyn was a private town, administratively located in the Masovian Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Stanis\u0142aw Antoni Szczuka, who died in Warsaw in 1710, was buried in the local Piarist church. In the 18th century the town passed to the powerful Potocki family. Factors that largely contributed to the development of the town were the presence of the school and the location on a trade route connecting Bia\u0142ystok and K\u00f6nigsberg. Among the teachers of the Piarist college were , who then founded the oldest Polish school for deaf people in Warsaw, and Polish philosopher Bronis\u0142aw Trentowski. In the Third Partition of Poland, in 1795, it was annexed by Prussia, in 1807 it became part of the newly established, although short-lived, Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and in 1815 it passed to the Russian Partition of Poland. Afterwards it saw a significant influx of Jews from Russia as a result of Russian discriminatory regulations and persecution (see Pale of Settlement). Szczuczyn was one of the sites of Russian executions of Polish insurgents during the January Uprising.Katalog miejsc pami\u0119ci powstania styczniowego w wojew\u00f3dztwie podlaskim, Towarzystwo Opieki nad Zabytkami Oddzia\u0142 Bia\u0142ystok, Bia\u0142ystok, 2013, p. 15 (in Polish) On May 15, 1864, one of the last battles of the January Uprising was fought there.Katalog miejsc pami\u0119ci powstania styczniowego w wojew\u00f3dztwie podlaskim, p. 51 During World War I, the town was occupied by Germany, and after the war it became part of Poland, as the country regained independence in 1918. ===World War II=== Some 56% of the town's 4,502 inhabitants were Jews prior to World War II.Kopstein, Jeffrey S., and Jason Wittenberg. \"Deadly communities: Local political milieus and the persecution of Jews in occupied Poland.\" Comparative Political Studies 44.3 (2011): 259-283. During the invasion of Poland, which started World War II, it was captured and briefly occupied by German forces. On September 12-13, 1939, the Einsatzgruppe V entered the town to commit various crimes against the population.Maria Wardzy\u0144ska, By\u0142 rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze\u0144stwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion, IPN, Warszawa, 2009, p. 54 (in Polish) Germans sent 350 men, mostly Jewish, to forced labor, of whom only 30 returned after five months. The town was then turned over to the Soviets, who arrested the wealthy residents of the town, including many Jews. Some twenty Jewish families were expelled to Siberia on 21 June 1941 and approximately 2,000 Jews remained in the town.Yad Vashem Ghetto Encyclopedia: Szczuczyn, Yad Vashem In 1941 the local Polish underground resistance movement was weakened when the Soviets arrested its commander.Daniel Bo\u0107kowski, Na zawsze razem.

The June massacre was stopped by German soldiers. A subsequent massacre by Poles in July killed some 100 Jews, and following the German Gestapo takeover in August 1941 some 600 Jews were killed by the Germans, the remaining Jews placed in a ghetto, and subsequently sent to Treblinka extermination camp.Yad Vashem Ghetto Encyclopedia: Szczuczyn, Yad VashemThe Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: Seredina-Buda-Z, Shmuel Spector & Geoffrey Wigoder, page 1276 ==Sports== The local football club is .
