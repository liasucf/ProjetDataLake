    "text": "Michel Weber (born 1963) is a Belgian philosopher. He is best known as an interpreter and advocate of the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead, and has come to prominence as the architect and organizer of an overlapping array of international scholarly societies and publication projects devoted to Whitehead and the global relevance of process philosophy. Weber criticizes contemporary academic philosophy for losing touch with its early Greek roots. Philosophy has a practical mission (rooted in Socratic discourse) to restore personal and social well being, but it cannot do this, he argues, if it renounces its traditional metaphysical obligation (rooted in pre-Socratic speculation) to understand the cosmos. Weber believes that process philosophy is uniquely qualified to fulfill this double function in the post-modern world. Weber was educated in Belgium and the United States. The primary languages of his publications are English and French. ==Education== Michel Weber studied applied economics at the Saint-Louis University, Brussels (candidat ing\u00e9nieur commercial, 1986) and philosophy at the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve (licenci\u00e9 en philosophie, 1991; docteur en philosophie, 1997). His master's thesis, written under the supervision of Jean Ladri\u00e8re, dealt with the epistemological status of the \"anthropic principle\" in cosmology in light of the concepts of teleology (or \"finality\") found in Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and Kant. From 1993 to 1995, he was Visiting Scholar at the Center for Process Studies of the Claremont School of Theology and at Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California (USA), where he worked under the supervision of John B. Cobb Jr. and David Ray Griffin. In 1997, he defended his doctoral thesis, Intuition pr\u00e9-syst\u00e9matique et intuition ontologique chez Alfred North Whitehead. Euristique du pancr\u00e9ativisme de l\u2019\u00e9poque de Harvard (Pre-systematic Intuition and Ontological Intuition According to Alfred North Whitehead: The Heuristics of Pan-creativism in the Harvard Era), written under the supervision of Marcel Crabb\u00e9.An abstract can be found in the \"Chronique de l\u2019Institut sup\u00e9rieur de Philosophie,\" Revue philosophique de Louvain, November 1997, pp. 793-794. ==Career== From 1997 to 2002 he was Research Fellow at the Centre de Logique de l\u2019Institut sup\u00e9rieur de Philosophie of the UCLouvain. From 2001 to 2002 he taught philosophy at the \u00c9cole europ\u00e9enne Bruxellensis II (European Baccalaureate, Anglophone Section, 6th and 7th years). From 2002 to 2007, he was Research Fellow at the Centre for Philosophical Anthropology of the UCLouvain Higher Institute of Philosophy. In 2000, Weber created, with the support of Fran\u00e7ois Beets and Paul Gochet (University of Li\u00e8ge), the Chromatiques whiteheadiennes and the Whitehead Psychology Nexus,See \"The Whitehead Psychology Nexus, Retrospect and Prospect,\" Process Perspectives , 26:3 (Fall 2003), pp. 3-4. two scholarly societies intended to federate research on different aspects, nuances, and implications of the thought of A. N. Whitehead. In 2001, he created the European William James Project with Jack Barbalet (University of Leicester), Jaime Nubiola (University of Navarra) and the late Timothy L. S. Sprigge (Emeritus Edinburgh). In 2002, he created the research seminars \"Chromatiques whiteheadiennes\" with the cooperation of the \"Philosophies of Experience\" research center at the Universit\u00e9 de Nantes Department of Philosophy and the Center for the Study of Pragmatism and Analytic Philosophy at the Sorbonne (le Centre d'\u00c9tudes sur le Pragmatisme et la Philosophie Analytique or CEPPA, but renamed since as EXeCO; Universit\u00e9 Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on Sorbonne-\u00c9cole Doctorale).EXeCO [Exp\u00e9rience et connaissance (Philosophies contemporaines); Chromatiques whiteheadiennes S\u00e9minaire coordonn\u00e9 par Michel WEBER, UFR de Philosophie, Universit\u00e9 Paris 1]. Since 2004, he has been the Editorial Director of the series Chromatiques whiteheadiennes for the academic publisher Ontos Verlag (Frankfurt) and Editorial Co-director, along with Nicholas Rescher (Pittsburgh) and Johanna Seibt (Aarhus & Konstanz), of the Process Thought series, also with Ontos Verlag (Advisory Board: Mark Bickhard, Lehigh; Jaime Nubiola, Navarra; and Roberto Poli, Trento).Ontos Verlag Since 2005, he has co-edited the Chromatikon: Annuaire de la philosophie en proc\u00e8s \u2014 Yearbook of Philosophy in Process at the Presses universitaires de Louvain, first with Diane d'Epr\u00e9mesnil (UCLouvain), then with Pierfrancesco Basile (University of Bern), and now with Ronny Desmet (Vrije Universiteit Brussel). In 2006, he created the Chromatiques whiteheadiennes \"Centre for Philosophical Practice,\" a non- profit organization.See Moniteur belge, 08.11.2006. The Center now federates the three networks mentioned above (the Chromatiques whiteheadiennes, the Whitehead Psychology Nexus, and the European William James Project) and provides an institutional base for two new activities: first, the publication of a scholarly book series appearing under the label Les \u00c9ditions Chromatika (Chromatika Editions) and, second, the opening in Brussels of Belgium's first philosophical counseling service or \"philosophical praxis.\"Centre de philosophie pratique \"Chromatiques whiteheadiennes.\" See also \"The Chromatiques whiteheadiennes Centre for Philosophical Practice,\" Process Perspectives , 30:1 (Summer 2007), pp. 17-18. Since 2007, he has been a member of the \"Contemporary Ontological Visions\" network of the Institute for Philosophical Research of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. In 2008\u20139, he was Visiting Professor at the New Bulgarian University, Department of Cognitive Science and Psychology & Department of Philosophy and Sociology. Since 2009, Weber is also a trained hypnotherapist (Institut Milton Erickson, Brussels). ==Philosophical work== As a principal source of inspiration, Weber promotes the ideas of a group of loosely associated thinkers from the early 20th century who applied evolutionary thinking to psychology, epistemology, cosmology, metaphysics, and theology, giving rise to the school of thought now known as \"process philosophy.\" Alfred North Whitehead (1861\u20131947), along with C. S. Peirce (1839\u20131914), Henri Bergson (1859\u20131941), and William James (1842\u20131910), is regarded as one of the fathers of process philosophy.See Nicholas Rescher, Process Metaphysics (Albany: SUNY Press), 1996. This mostly Anglo-American school of thought still finds only minority endorsement in academic philosophy departments. Nevertheless, despite its limited reception in the United States and Great Britain, process philosophy has begun to interest a small but growing number of scholars worldwide. By organizing a global network of like-minded scholars and fostering the publication of their ideas in Europe, Weber has contributed significantly to the visibility of process philosophy in Europe. There also appears to be a shift of focus. Until recently, interest in Whitehead, especially in the United States, tended to focus on process theology. Whitehead's brief but provocative theological speculations, added almost as an afterthought at the end of his major philosophical opus Process and RealityAlfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality, Corrected Edition (New York: The Free Press), 1978, pp. 337-351. (1929), were elaborated into an excitingly new natural theology that seemed particularly attractive to Christian theologians because it made naturalistic sense of God's personal love for creatures. This theological emphasis, however, along with a sometimes evangelical tone adopted by Whitehead's more ardent devotees, may be the reason for the marginalization of process philosophy in mainstream academic philosophy. With his 1996 book Process Metaphysics, the eminent and prolific American philosopher Nicholas Rescher began a campaign to rehabilitate a broadly secular style of process thinking. He defended it as the optimal matrix for any systematic theorizing about the nature of things.Nicholas Rescher, Process Metaphysics (Albany: SUNY Press), 1996. Like Rescher in the United States, Weber cultivates a critical and largely secular appreciation for process philosophy. He translated Rescher's Process Metaphysics into French in 2006.Nicholas Rescher, Essais sur les fondements de l'ontologie du proc\u00e8s (Process Metaphysics); translation and preface by Michel Weber, translation reviewed by the author (Frankfurt/Paris/Lancaster: Ontos Verlag), 2006. In 2000, his monograph La dialectique de l\u2019intuition chez A. N. Whitehead. Sensation pure, pancr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et onto-logisme (The Dialectic of Intuition in the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead: Pure Sensation, Pancreativity, and Onto-logism) was awarded a prize by the Belgian Royal Academy (Classe des Lettres de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Belgique).See Jean Ladri\u00e8re, Marc Richir, Jacques Taminiaux, \"Rapports des Commissaires,\" Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Belgique, Bulletin de la Classe des Lettres et des Sciences Morales et Politiques, 6e s\u00e9rie, Tome XI, Bruxelles, 2000, pp. 122-126. Weber argues that the term pancreativism constitutes the more appropriate qualification of Whitehead's metaphysics, which is neither a pantheism or a panentheism. ==Professional activities== Weber is the author of 10 monographs and 80 scholarly articles and encyclopedia entries. His monograph La Dialectique de l\u2019intuition chez A. N. Whitehead: sensation pure, pancr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et contigu\u00efsme (The Dialectic of Intuition in the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead: Pure Sensation, Pancreativity, and Onto-logism) was awarded the Prix du Concours annuel 2000 by the Royal Academy of Belgium. He is also the motive force behind numerous international and intercultural collaborations. He strives to coordinate his professional activities toward the creation of a new, visionary philosophical culture conceived as cooperative, intellectually adventurous, ethically self-aware, and global in reach. :*He has founded three international scholarly societies: :::*Chromatiques whiteheadiennes,For a report on their Fifth International Conference, see \"Politics, Science, and Religion Converge in Belgium,\" Process Perspectives , 29:1 (Summer 2006), p. 16. :::*the Whitehead Psychology Nexus,See \"The Whitehead Psychology Nexus, Retrospect and Prospect,\" Process Perspectives , 26:3 (Summer/Fall 2003), pp. 3-4. and :::*the European William James Project. :*He manages a non-profit publishing house, :::*\u00c9ditions Chromatika. :*And, he oversees (in conjunction with various colleagues) the publication of four book series :::*the Chromatiques whiteheadiennes, :::*the Ontos Verlag Series in Process Thought, :::*the Whitehead Psychology Nexus Studies, and :::*the Chromatika editions, ::as well as a philosophical annual, :::*Chromatikon: Annuaire de la philosophie en proc\u00e8s \u2014 Yearbook of Philosophy in Process. Using process philosophy as a matrix to foster synergies, Weber follows the work of hundreds of scholars worldwide and with each of his projects defines a locus where he thinks creative energies are poised to intersect. Collaborating with some 150 scholars representing all continents, he has to date edited or co-edited 30 collections, bringing together hundreds of original papers on themes relating to process philosophy in an interdisciplinary and multicultural context. :*Most ambitious in scope is the two-volume Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought, edited by Weber and Will Desmond: \"Gathering 115 entries written by 101 internationally renowned experts in their fields, the Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought aims at interpreting Whitehead secundum Whitehead, at canvassing the current state of knowledge in Whiteheadian scholarship and at identifying promising directions for future investigations through (internal) cross-elucidation and (external) interdisciplinary and crossdisciplinary development.\" :*Also noteworthy is the recent interdisciplinary volume edited by Weber and Anderson Weekes, Process Approaches to Consciousness in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Philosophy of Mind, which \"opens a dialogue between process philosophy and [the burgeoning field of] contemporary consciousness studies.\"Weber and Weekes, Process Approaches to Consciousness in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Philosophy of Mind (Albany: SUNY), 2009. It is too early to judge how this book will be received by those who approach the study of consciousness from more mainstream backgrounds in Anglo-American Analytic philosophy or in Continental Phenomenology and Existentialism, but the contributors to this volume make a point of establishing what they believe to be fertile common ground between process thought and both its mainstream rivals. Weber is also the founder of the Centre for Philosophical Practice in Brussels.Centre de philosophie pratique \"Chromatiques whiteheadiennes.\" See also \"The Chromatiques whiteheadiennes Centre for Philosophical Practice,\" Process Perspectives , 30:1 (Summer 2007), pp. 17-18. Philosophical Counseling is a recent movement, probably begun in the United States, employing Socratic methods of dialog for the purpose of short-term counseling that, without seeking to replace more traditional psychotherapies, nevertheless offers an alternative to them. In July 2010, he organized an Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute in Paris, at the Cit\u00e9 universitaire's Fondation Biermans Lap\u00f4tre. The second Institute has taken place in July 2011. In May 2014, the philosophical counselling service moved to the Centre Kinos, now Tonaki, of the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve. Dr Weber is also currently Adjunct Professor, Department of Educational Foundations, University of Saskatchewan. ==Bibliography (selection)== ;Authored monographs # La Dialectique de l\u2019intuition chez A.
