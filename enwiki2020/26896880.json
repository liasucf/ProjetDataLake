Although no information is available on her range, Admiral G. A. Ballard estimated that Druid had only about two-thirds the range of her sisters, despite the additional coal that she carried, due to the greater efficiency of the compound expansion engines used in the other ships.Ballard, p. 90 She was ship rigged and had a sail area of . The lower masts were made of iron, and the other masts were wood.Ballard, p. 91 She was a poor sailer and her best speed under sail alone was about . Ballard attributed the class's poor performance under sail to the drag of the propeller, which could neither be hoisted out of the water, nor feathered. He also attributed their sluggish steering under sail to interference with the flow of water to the rudder by the stationary propeller.Ballard, pp. 90\u201391 The ship was re-rigged as a barque after her first commission.
