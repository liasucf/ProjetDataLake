As chief legal advisor to the Cabinet, Blackwell was involved in the prosecution of Roger Casement, and authorised the circulation of his disputed Black Diaries, advising the Cabinet in July 1916:Lucy McDiarmid, The Posthumous Life of Roger Casement in Gender and Sexuality in Modern Ireland, University of Massachusetts Press, 1997The black diaries: an account of Roger Casement's life and times, P Singleton-Gates, M Girodias \u2013 1959 \u2013 Grove Press In 1918, due to worries over the large number of firearms left in private hands following World War I, and the concern that they would be used by \"savage or semi-civilised tribesmen in outlying parts of the British Empire\" or by an \"anarchist or intellectual malcontent of the great cities whose weapons are the bomb and the automatic pistol.\", a Committee on Firearms Control was struck with Blackwell as its chairman. The report it issued recommended \"stringent regulation\" of rifles and small arms as \"the number of persons who can urge any reasonable ground for possession of a revolver or pistol is extremely small [and] the danger attending the indiscriminate possession of such weapons is obvious\", conclusions which led to the passage of the Firearms Act 1920. ==Later life== Following his retirement, Blackwell's continued interest in legal matters was shown by his 1934 appointment as chairman of the statutory committee of Britain's Pharmaceutical Society, to which he had been elected an honorary member in 1928. He exercised that position until 1939. Among other interests, he was a first-class golfer who captained The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1933. He served as the first president of The Civil Service Golfing Society from 1922 until his death. In 1924, the Club instituted The Sir Ernley Blackwell Trophy, which it still awards.https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q;=cache:eOaVCHKzH- cJ:www.cssc.co.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx%3FlID%3D10126%26sID%3D9363+&hl;=en\u2277=ca&pid;=bl&srcid;=ADGEEShR5FGRP0_04FEMUMIefnBh_cHLBpGN6CM_AFPSqAleBj6dVsLg6omQETH5mPMzS6Wn7xeaBg3qczirlr1G_f0yqs- VDE6Q_0oF9eHvZ0Cb2oHauVY3T84Rsz77kQM- bUT_H0J_&sig;=AHIEtbRZXEzKySdQ4xIv483-WMIzrCrRRw He was also a member of the Zoological Society from 1914.A list of the fellows & honorary, foreign, & corresponding members & medallists of the Zoological society of London: Corrected to 31 May 1922 His brother, Edward Blackwell, who was also a skilled golfer, placed second in the 1904 Amateur Championship. ==Family== Blackwell was married at the age of 69 to Kitty, Lady Blackwell, of 7, Hay Hill, London, W.1, who survived him.
