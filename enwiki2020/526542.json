He was named after his paternal uncle, a typographer and compositor, who perished in 1943 at the Jasenovac concentration camp. The Sidran family roots trace back to the hamlet Biograd near Nevesinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Abdulah's paternal grandfather Hasan Sidran relocated to Sarajevo from Biograd in 1903. ==Personal life== After spending most of his life in Sarajevo, Sidran lived in Gora\u017ede before moving to a small village near Te\u0161anj where he currently lives.
