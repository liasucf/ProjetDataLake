    "text": "The Metelko alphabet (Slovene: metel\u010dica) was a Slovene writing system developed by Franc Serafin Metelko. It was used by a small group of authors from 1825 to 1833 but it was never generally accepted. Example of the Metelko alphabet: Valentin Stani\u010d's adaptation of the poem \"Der Kaiser und der Abt\" by Gottfried August B\u00fcrger Tombstone of at Navje Memorial Park in Ljubljana, written in the Metelko alphabet. Metelko introduced his alphabet in the book Lehrgeb\u00e4ude der slowenischen Sprache im K\u00f6nigreiche Illyrien und in den benachbarten Provinzen (Textbook of the Slovene Language of Kingdom of Illyria and Neighboring Provinces, 1825). He invented his alphabet in order to replace the formerly used Bohori\u010d alphabet (bohori\u010dica), which was considered problematic in certain situations. Metelko was influenced by the ideas of Jernej Kopitar, a well-known linguist who also participated in the development of the modern Serbian alphabet (created by Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107, following Kopitar's ideas). Metelko's alphabet has 32 letters in following order: A B D E Image:Metelko E.gif F G H Image:Metelko H.gif I \u01a7 J K L Image:Metelko LJ.gif M N Image:Metelko NJ.gif O Image:Metelko O.gif P R S Image:Metelko \u0160.gif Image:Metelko \u0160\u010c.gif \u0417 Image:Metelko \u017d.gif T U V Image:Metelko C.gif \ua78d Special letters are explained in the following table (other letters have the same meaning as in modern Slovene): {| class=\"wikitable\" width=300 |+ Metelko's alphabet |- align=center ! majuscule !! minuscule !!

Metelko also added special letters for some common clusters: 12px, 14px and 12px. The difference between glottal and velar H (, ) is in fact not relevant to Slovene phonology, and therefore the letter 12px was omitted by some authors. In the formerly used Bohori\u010d alphabet, certain words with different pronunciation had the same spelling. Metelko wanted to solve this problem by splitting E into three and O into two variants. Metelko's letters E, 12px and \u01a7 represent the vowels , and , which were formerly written with E. Metelko's letters O and 12px represent the vowels and , which were formerly written with O. The main problem of Metelko's alphabet was its graphic design. Metelko's letters appeared strange to the average Slovene writer and the alphabet itself was soon nicknamed krevljica 'the twisted alphabet'. Some letters were in fact difficult to write by hand. Besides Metelko was strongly influenced by his own dialect, certain solutions were not accepted by speakers of other dialects. Soon strong opposition rose against Metelko's alphabet. After the \"Slovene alphabet war\" Metelko's alphabet was forbidden in 1833. A few years later Slovenes accepted Gaj's Latin alphabet (Slovene: gajica), which is easier to write. In this alphabet variants in pronunciation are written using diacritics (\u00e9, \u00ea, \u00f3, \u00f4, etc.) but only in cases when it is necessary to distinguish two words (e.g. kl\u00f3p = bench; kl\u00f4p = tick). ==See also== *Slovene alphabet ==Sources== *Topori\u0161i\u010d, Jo\u017ee. 1993. \"Metel\u010dica.\" Enciklopedija Slovenije, vol. 7, pp. 103\u2013104.
