It was filmed on location in and around the Serez family farm in Mulmur, Ontario, as well as Wisconsin (train sequences) and establishing shots in Pittsburgh. The jail sequences were filmed in both the Allegheny County Courthouse and old Allegheny County Jail. The film was entered in the 35th Berlin International Film Festival. ==Plot== Kate Soffel is the wife of a Pittsburgh prison warden in 1901. They have four children. After several months of being sick in bed for no discernible reason, she suddenly regains her strength. She visits inmates to read Bible scripture to them and meets Ed Biddle and his brother Jack, both of whom may be innocent of the crimes that brought them there. Mrs. Soffel falls in love with Ed and enables him and Jack to escape, smuggling bar-cutting blades to him at the prison. They go on the run together, with tragic results. == Cast == *Diane Keaton as Kate Soffel *Mel Gibson as Ed Biddle *Matthew Modine as Jack Biddle *Edward Herrmann as Warden Peter Soffel *Trini Alvarado as Irene Soffel *Jennifer Dundas as Margaret Soffel *Danny Corkill as Eddie Soffel *Harley Cross as Clarence Soffel *Terry O'Quinn as Detective Charles \"Buck\" McGovern *Pippa Pearthree as Maggie *William Youmans as Guard George Koslow *Maury Chaykin as Guard Charlie Reynolds *Joyce Ebert as Matron Agnes Garvey *Wayne Robson as Halliday *Dana Wheeler-Nicholson as Jessie Bodyne *Les Rubie as Mr. Stevenson *Paula Trueman as Mrs. Stevenson *Katie McCombs as Rachel Garvey *William Duell as Lenny *Walter Massey as Mr. Robinson ==Reception== The film received lackluster reviews upon release and currently holds a 36% 'Rotten' score on Rotten Tomatoes.
