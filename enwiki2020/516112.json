    "text": "Hans Hermann Wilhelm Gro\u00ebr OSB (13 October 1919 \u2013 24 March 2003) was an Austrian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Vienna from 1986 to 1995, and became a cardinal in 1988. Pope John Paul II replaced him as archbishop after multiple allegations of sexual abuse of children, and at John Paul's request Gro\u00ebr relinquished all ecclesiastical duties and privileges as an archbishop and cardinal on 14 April 1998. ==Biography== Gro\u00ebr was born in Vienna to German parents, with whom he moved in 1929 to Czechoslovakia, where they remained for the next decade. He attended seminaries in Hollabrunn and Vienna (where he received his doctorate in theology) before being ordained to the priesthood on 12 April 1942 by Cardinal Theodor Innitzer. Gro\u00ebr then served as a chaplain in Petronell and Bad V\u00f6slau until 1946, when he became Prefect of Studies at the minor seminary of Hollabrunn. He entered the Order of Saint Benedict in 1974 and took the name Hermann upon his solemn profession of vows on 8 September 1980. That same year Gro\u00ebr was named the spiritual director of the Legion of Mary for Austria. On 15 July 1986, he was appointed the fifteenth Archbishop of Vienna, succeeding Cardinal Franz K\u00f6nig. Gro\u00ebr received his episcopal consecration on the following 14 September from K\u00f6nig, with Archbishop Karl Berg and Bishop Stefan L\u00e1szl\u00f3 serving as co-consecrators. He was created Cardinal Priest of Santi Gioacchino ed Anna al Tuscolano by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 28 June 1988. ==Sexual abuse of school boys, monks== In 1995, one of Gro\u00ebr's former school students accused him of sexual molestation. A number of others made similar charges shortly thereafter, as did some monks. Pope John Paul II promoted Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn from auxiliary bishop to Coadjutor Archbishop of Vienna on 13 April 1995 and later in the year accepted the resignation Gro\u00ebr had submitted as required on his 75th birthday in October 1994. Gro\u00ebr moved to the Roggendorf monastery, where he served as prior. When new allegations surfaced, Austrian church officials appealed to the pope, who initiated an investigation in February 1998. In April, at the pope's request, Gro\u00ebr resigned as prior and withdrew from public life. He released a statement that said: \"In the past three years there have been many often incorrect statements concerning me. I ask God and the people for forgiveness if I have brought guilt upon myself.\" After surrendering his church duties and duties as a Cardinal,https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2019/03/08/catholic-church-cardinals- implicated-in-sex-abuse-cover-ups/ Gro\u00ebr left Austria as part of a \"self imposed exile\" for several months and moved into a convent near Dresden, Germany.http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/25/local/me-groer25 He continued to work as a confessor in women's monasteries, received visitors and said Mass. Suffering from cancer, his health declined rapidly.Gerhard Heger, Hans Hermann Gro\u00ebr, Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon 26 (2006), pp. 529\u2013534. Austria's statute of limitations prevented civil authorities from prosecuting Gro\u00ebr. In 2010, Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn (elevated to that rank in 1998) said that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger had attempted to convince Pope John Paul II to initiate the investigation and\u2014in a conversation with journalists that Sch\u00f6nborn thought was private\u2014said that Cardinal Angelo Sodano had blocked his attempt to investigate Gro\u00ebr's activities. Church officials are also alleged to have offered some of Gro\u00ebr's former pupils compensation in return for agreeing not to repeat their charges against him. Hubertus Czernin, author of a book about the case, believes that Gro\u00ebr abused more than 2,000 young men. Gro\u00ebr continued to deny the allegations until his death. ==Death and eulogies== The grave of Cardinal Gro\u00ebr, in the upper left an ex-voto tablet Gro\u00ebr died on 24 March 2003 of pneumonia at a hospital in Sankt P\u00f6lten, where he had been treated for cancer. Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn presided at the requiem Mass in St. Stephan's Cathedral and in his homily honoured his predecessor's accomplishments in strengthening Marian devotions in the Archdiocese as well as fostering priestly and monastic vocations. The next day, Cardinal Joachim Meisner, Archbishop of Cologne, referenced the charges against Gro\u00ebr in his eulogy only to describe how Gro\u00ebr had suffered, noting how Gro\u00ebr was \"deeply wounded, even stigmatized by the incidents during his last years as Archbishop of Vienna\", that \"when the dark cloud gathered over his life ... he sank into loneliness and contempt\". Gro\u00ebr was buried in the cemetery of Marienfeld Abbey, the Cistercian women's monastery he was instrumental in founding in 1974. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Biography, Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church Category:1919 births Category:2003 deaths Category:20th- century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Archbishops of Vienna Category:Austrian cardinals Category:Catholic Church sexual abuse scandals in Europe Category:Austrian military personnel of World War II Category:Cardinals created by Pope John Paul II Category:20th-century Roman Catholic priests ",
