    "text": "The Civic Alliance of Serbia (, GSS) was a social liberal and pro-european political party in Serbia. ==History== Known widely by its three-letter acronym in Serbian, GSS was founded and registered in 1992. In the 1992 election, the party was represented by Ratomir Tani\u0107. Following the election, the Republican Club led by Neboj\u0161a Popov and the Reform Party of Serbia led by Vesna Pe\u0161i\u0107 (Serbian successor to Ante Markovi\u0107's SFR Yugoslavia-wide Union of Reform Forces party) merged into the party. Both had went in coalition with the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina. In 1996 \u017darko Kora\u0107 left the GSS with a group of dissidents who opposed forming coalition with the right-wing Serbian Renewal Movement for the 1996 federal election and formed the Social Democratic Union (SDU). Notable members over the years included Goran Svilanovi\u0107, former Foreign Minister of Serbia and Montenegro, Nata\u0161a Mi\u0107i\u0107, former parliamentary president and acting president of Serbia, Ga\u0161o Knezevi\u0107, former Serbian Minister of Education, and Vesna Pe\u0161i\u0107, the party founder and longtime leader. The future of the party had been in doubt ever since it split into two wings. One part promoted a merger with Democratic Party, while the other part wanted to continue political existence as an independent party. The December 2004 party congress upheld the decision to remain an independent party and elected Nata\u0161a Mi\u0107i\u0107 as the new leader. The party decided to apply for membership of the ELDR and the Liberal International. At its May 2004 council, ELDR, accepted GSS as an affiliate member. However, GSS merged into Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on April 7, 2007. The party had three representatives in the National Assembly of Serbia in 2007 elected from the list of the LDP. ==Presidents of the Civic Alliance of Serbia (1992\u20132007)== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |-- ! # ! colspan=\"2\"| President !
