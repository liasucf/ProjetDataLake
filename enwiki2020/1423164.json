One of the more notable infomercials aired on the channel was the Magic Bullet. ==History== The channel was launched in 1996Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2010-590 CRTC 2010-08-18 by Rogers Cable under the name Direct To You, with the tagline \"The Infomercial Channel\". In March 1997, Torstar announced that it would purchase the channel from Rogers Cable for $1.7 million, with the intention of rebranding the channel to align it with the Toronto Star newspaper, the flagship brand of Torstar Corporation.Torstar Corporation - Company Update. Torstar press release via The Free Library 1997-03-04 In October 1997, Torstar renamed the network Toronto Star TV. While under the direction of Rogers Cable, the channel exclusively aired infomercials, however, with the name change to Toronto Star TV, Torstar injected news and information into its schedule, blurring the lines between a shopping channel and a news channel. This was done so in an effort to boost subscriptions to the Toronto Star, by offering a glimpse of what readers could expect from the newspaper itself. The channel also began producing in-house infomercial content for third party clients.TSTV offers sales pitch for Toronto Star Strategy Magazine 1999-08-30 In April 2003, Torstar rebranded the network, this time as ShopTV Canada,Torstar Media Group Television Launches New Brand TSMG press release 2003-04-14 in an effort to better reflect the type of programming the channel broadcasts.
