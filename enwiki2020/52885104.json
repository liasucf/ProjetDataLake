    "text": "Cherry Glazerr is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, United States, formed in 2013. The current lineup consists of guitarist and lead vocalist Clementine Creevy, bassist Sami Perez and drummer Tabor Allen. The band's sound has transitioned from lo-fi, garage-rock in their debut release Haxel Princess in 2014, to a more polished rock sound, with elements of grunge, punk and new wave, in their subsequent releases Apocalipstick and Stuffed & Ready. ==History== ===Formation and early years (2012-2016)=== Cherry Glazerr originated as 'Clembutt': a solo project for then-15 year old vocalist and guitarist Clementine Creevy, who wrote, performed and uploaded a small catalogue of songs onto SoundCloud in 2012. The tracks were discovered by Burger Records co-founder Sean Bohrman, who released them as a tape titled Papa Cremp in 2013. In 2013 Creevy was joined by her high school friends Hannah Uribe and Sophia Muller, on drums and vocals respectively, and Sean Redman on bass. The band takes its name from NPR reporter Chery Glaser. Cherry Glazerr began performing with a number of prominent bands and festival scenes in 2013, including SXSW, Beach Goth, at the El Rey with Mikal Cronin and Redd Kross, and alongside Fidlar at Burger Records' annual Burgerama festival, where they captured the attention of fashion icon Hedi Slimane. In 2014, the band, now a trio following the departure of vocalist Sophia Muller, released their full-length debut Haxel Princess on Burger Records, featuring percussion by Joel Jerome. The album, described as \"concocted from a mix of attitude, silliness and garage-born guitar haze\" was praised for Creevy's unique vocals - alternating from dreamy to high-pitched, hostile and unforgiving \\- and for its cynical, witty lyrics. ===Apocalipstick and Stuffed & Ready (2017-present)=== Cherry Glazerr released their sophomore album, Apocalipstick, on January 20, 2017. The band's first album for Secretly Canadian was recorded at Hollywood's Sunset Sound studio in early 2016 with producers Joe Chicarrelli (The Strokes, The White Stripes) and Carlos De La Garza (Paramore), and explores themes of female empowerment, individuality, sexuality and consumerism. Apocalipstick was released to overall critical approval: it was described by Pitchfork as the band's \"fiercest recording yet, full of shredding jams, furious howls, and self-aware swagger', and its lead single 'I Told You I'd Be With The Guys' as a \"tremendous indie rock tune powerful enough to restore your faith in the genre' by The Guardian. Cherry Glazerr toured extensively across Europe and North America throughout 2017, supporting Foster the People and Slowdive on their North American tours, and playing a number of festivals, including FYF Fest, Pitchfork Fest and La Route du Rock. In 2018, Cherry Glazerr played at Coachella, opened for Portugal. The Man and The Breeders, and released a new single, \"Juicy Socks\". In November 2018, Cherry Glazerr announced their new album Stuffed & Ready would be released on February 1, 2019. They released a new single, \"Daddi\", with the announcement, accompanied by an animated music video directed by Danny Cole. Their new song, Wasted Nun from the album Stuffed & Ready along with a NSFW music video for the song was released on 1/11/19 ===Side projects=== Music by Cherry Glazerr has been featured on a number of artistic platforms. After recruiting vocalist Clementine Creevy to model for the Yves Saint Laurent Campaign in 2013, creative director Hedi Slimane commissioned Cherry Glazerr to write a song for his Fall 2014 Saint Laurent's women's show (\"Had Ten Dollaz\"). In 2014, Cherry Glazerr recorded a new version of the Al Dubin and Joe Burke (composer) song \u201cTiptoe Through The Tulips\u201d, which was featured in the 2015 supernatural horror film Insidious: Chapter 3. Creevy also supplied guest vocals for the Death Grips song \"Giving Bad People Good Ideas\", on the album Bottomless Pit. Frontwoman Clementine Creevy has acted in the Amazon Prime TV series Transparent, fronting the fictional rock band Glitterish. In 2017, VICE magazine produced a short autobiographical documentary about Creevy titled \"Clementine Creevy: The Millenial [sic] Punk Feminist Icon\". In 2020, the band was featured in a music video for the song \"The End of The Game\" by the American rock band Weezer, although they were not featured in the song. Clementine is featured on Tyler, The Creator's album \"Cherry Bomb\", on the song \"Okaga, CA\" ==Members== The band has undergone a number of lineup changes since its inception. In 2015, Hannah Uribe left the band in pursuit of other artistic projects. In 2015, Cherry Glazerr saw the addition of two new musicians: multi-instrumentalist Sasami Ashworth on synths, who was invited to join the band by Sean Redman, and drummer Tabor Allen, who was subsequently invited to join the band by Ashworth. In mid-2016, and after participating in the recording of Apocalipstick, Redman departed and became a full-time member of his other band The Buttertones. He was replaced by bassist Devin O'Brien in 2017. In January 2018, Cherry Glazerr announced that Sasami Ashworth had left the band in order to concentrate on her own musical projects. On the subject of the band's change in personnel, Clementine Creevy described Cherry Glazerr as \"a band that I lead, that has had a lot of beautiful additions to it and a lot of people have played in it. I\u2019m proud of that...it feels like the type of exploration of collaborative music that I\u2019ve always wanted to achieve\".
