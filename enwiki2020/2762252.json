    "text": "P\u00e9rouges is a commune in the Ain department in eastern France. It is a medieval walled town northeast of Lyon. It is perched on a small hill that overlooks the plain of the Ain River. ==History== P\u00e9rouges was inhabited by craftsmen; mainly farmers and linen weavers. It was probably founded by a Gallic colony returning from Perugia in Italy. In 1167, the Seigneur d'Anthon famously shut the commune's walls against the troops of the Archbishop of Lyon, and as early as 1236 the inhabitants earned communal freedom. In 1601 the town officially became French. Until the end of the 18th century, the textile industry in P\u00e9rouges boomed. In the 19th century, however, roads and railroads were re-routed and the population dropped from 1,500 to 90.Green Guide Auvergne, Rh\u00f4ne Valley, page 208, Michelin et Cie, 1995, But, starting in 1911, the town was restored and houses were saved. Today, P\u00e9rouges is a popular tourist attraction. == Origin == According to the archaeological findings, humans have been present at P\u00e9rouges since the Chalcolithic (about \u20132500 to \u20131800) age. There is no date for the construction of the fortress itself, but its first written mention appears in 12th century, therefore it is assumed to be built in that period. Although the town has been attacked by French soldiers on multiple occasions, it still prospered, due to its location and proximity to the trade routes. The town is located between Lyon and Geneva, which was one of the active local trade routes, therefore, craftsmanship and trade in the region flourished. The area officially became part of France under the rule of Henri IV in 1601. ==Population== ==Films set in P\u00e9rouges== Given its authentic historical appearance, P\u00e9rouges is often used as the setting for period films by French directors and others.
