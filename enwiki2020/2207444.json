It was originally known as Hayne. The current name simply means \"big Hayne\" ==History== Gro\u00dfenhain was originally a Sorbian settlement, and remains an area where this language is spoken. It was first mentioned in 1205.Gro\u00dfenhain, Steifzug durch eine s\u00e4chsische Kleinstadt 2002, Gr\u00e4ser Verlag It was for a time occupied by the Bohemians, by whom it was strongly fortified. It afterwards came into the possession of the margraves of Mei\u00dfen, from whom it was taken in 1312 by the margraves of Brandenburg. In the middle-ages, Gro\u00dfenhain was one of the most powerful towns in Saxony. It suffered considerably in all the great German wars, and in 1744 was nearly destroyed by fire. The fire destroyed the church which was then replaced by the current Marienkirche, which echoes internally echoes the Frauenkirche in nearby Dresden. On May 16, 1813, a battle took place here between the French (Napoleon's army) and the Russians. A military airfield was created near the town, opening in February 1914. Kulturzentrum Grossenhain (the culture centre) was recently created, cleverly converting the ruined fragments of Schloss Grossenhain into a modern building.https://www.kulturzentrum- grossenhain.de/index.php ==Geography== The altarpiece in the Marienkirche, Grossenhain Kulturzentrum, Grossenhain Gro\u00dfenhain is located on the river R\u00f6der, northwest of Dresden, and east of Riesa.
