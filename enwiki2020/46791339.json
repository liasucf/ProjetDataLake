    "text": "Many glacial erratic boulders (often simply called glacial erratics) can be found in the Puget Sound region as far south as the Yelm area where the Puget Lobe of the glacier reached its maximum extent. The Pleistocene ice age glaciation of Puget Sound created many of the geographical features of the region, including Puget Sound itself, and the erratics are one of the remnants of that age. According to Nick Zentner of Central Washington University Department of Geological Sciences, \"Canadian rocks [are] strewn all over the Puget lowland, stretching from the Olympic Peninsula clear over to the Cascade Range.\" Erratics can be found at altitudes up to about in the Enumclaw area, along with kames, drumlins, and perhaps also the unique Mima mounds. The soil of Seattle, the state's largest city, is approximately 80% glacial drift, most of which is Vashon glacial deposits (till), and nearly all of the city's major named hills are characterized as drumlins (Beacon Hill, First Hill, Capitol Hill, Queen Anne Hill) or drift uplands (Magnolia, West Seattle)., narrated by Nick Zentner (Central Washington University Department of Geological Sciences). Uploaded March 2, 2015 by Hugefloods.com (Nick Zentner and Tom Foster: Discover the Ice Age Floods). Boulders greater than 3 meters in diameter are \"rare\" in the Vashon till, but can be found, as seen in the table below. ==List of erratics== A few of the larger or otherwise most notable erratics can be found in this table. More erratics are noted in the area- specific lists in the navigation box. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Name and description !! Height !!

A Duvall road, a park, and several businesses are named after it. The rock, and two non-native sequoias adjacent to it probably planted by area pioneers, are a local landmark. The erratic lies in what is said to be the smallest King County park, in extent, that barely contains the rock and sequoias. The two lanes of Big Rock Road used to split into a wye around the rock, until a shopping center was built nearby in the 1990s. | |King |frameless |- |style=\"width:30em;vertical-align:top;\"|Big Rock, once known as the Rock of Ages, a greenstone erratic and a landmark on Main Street in Coupeville, at one time considered for a city conservation easement | |Island | |- |style=\"width:30em;vertical-align:top;\"|Dabob Bay erratic, a non metamorphosed conglomerate erratic on the shore of Dabob Bay, possibly part of Chuckanut Formation from Whatcom County away. | |Jefferson | |- |style=\"width:30em;vertical-align:top;\"|Discovery Park beach erratics Four or more erratics on beach below Discovery Park.

It has had a navigational light placed on it and appears on nautical charts. Native Americans called the rock LE'plEpL, also written La'pub, and also called it Tele'tla (meaning \"rock\"). A legend says that a hero named Sta'kub could throw a giant cedar and hazel branch dragnet over the rock while standing at the beach. | |King |frameless |- |style=\"width:30em;vertical-align:top;\"|Frog Rock, a Bainbridge Island landmark | |Kitsap |frameless |- |style=\"width:30em;vertical- align:top;\"| Lake Lawrence erratic in the Puget Sound lowlands near Lake Lawrence in Thurston County.
