    "text": "\"Halloween\" (B-side \"Saturday Night Holocaust\") is the seventh and final single by Dead Kennedys. It was released in December 1982 on Alternative Tentacles. The song is from the band's second album, Plastic Surgery Disasters. ==Song Topic== The song is about Halloween (Dead Kennedys formed in San Francisco where Halloween is a large celebration) and questions why people don't celebrate it every day. Halloween says that people are too shy to express themselves that way on a daily basis because of what people might say; as shown in the line \"People out on the street, they might glare at you.\" ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Chart (1982) ! scope=\"col\" | Peak position |- | UK Indie Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Dead Kennedys songs Category:1982 singles Category:Halloween songs Category:1982 songs ",
