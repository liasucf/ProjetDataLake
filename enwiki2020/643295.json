    "text": "Orthorrhapha is a circumscriptional name which historically was used for an infraorder of Brachycera, one of the two suborders into which the order Diptera, the flies, are divided. As the group was paraphyletic, it has not been used in classifications in the last decade, and is effectively obsolete. However, many catalogs, checklists, and older works still contain the name. The taxa that used to be in the Orthorrhapha now comprise all of the infraorders in Brachycera excluding the Muscomorpha (= \"Cyclorrhapha\"). The recent revision of the taxonomy of the order Diptera by Pape et al.Pape, T., Blagoderov, V., & Mostovski, M. B. (2011). Order Diptera Linnaeus, 1758. Animal biodiversity: An outline of higher-level classification and survey of taxonomic richness. Zootaxa, 3148(237), 222-229. revived the name Orthorrhapha. ==References== *Cedric Gillott, 1980 Entomology Plenum Press, New York Category:Brachycera Category:Insect infraorders Category:Obsolete arthropod taxa ",
