    "text": "Menc\u00eda Calder\u00f3n (1514-1564?) was a Spanish noble lady, first expeditionary woman in the R\u00edo de la Plata. == Biography == Mencia was born in Villa de Medell\u00edn, Badajoz (Spain) daughter of Alonso Calder\u00f3n and Ana Ocampo, belonging to a noble family of Extremadura. She was married to Juan de Sanabria, a noble Spanish expeditionary who died shortly before leaving for New Spain. Through his mother, Menc\u00eda Calder\u00f3n, was related to Francisco Pizarro and Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, belonging to noble Castilian families. On April 10, 1550, Menc\u00eda Calder\u00f3n embarked to America. In the expedition traveled 300 passengers, among which there were captains Salazar and Saavedra, Calderon's daughters, 50 eligible maidens, the wives of various conquerors, 80 sailors, and adventurer Hans Staden, who would write the chronicle of the expedition. The fleet survived storms and attacks by French corsairs before managing to reach the isle of Santa Catalina. From there, they made their way to the coast of Brazil, where they settled for a year while repairing their ships and building new, more fit ones with what was left of the others. After this period of rest they left to Asunci\u00f3n. The arguments between Salazar y Saavedra became constant, and it was Menc\u00eda who managed to organize the expedition and keep the group together. Menc\u00eda took the rank of Adelantada upon herself and guided an expedition of men and women across 1.600 km of rainforest, following the same path that years before had followed Alejo Garc\u00eda and Alvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca. They reached Asunci\u00f3n in 1555, where some problems erupted when the women who had come to meet their husbands found them already remarried to indigenous women, and with mestizo children, some of which were already in their teens.Ben\u00edtez, Luis G.; en \"Historia del Paraguay. \u00c9poca colonial\" (p. 52, Ed.
