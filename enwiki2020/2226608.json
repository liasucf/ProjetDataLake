He was a member of the Colorado Party. Chaves was born on February 15, 1882 in Paraguar\u00ed. His parents were the Portuguese Federico Chaves and his wife Felicia Careaga, from Guaira, Paraguay. == Political History == Chaves, who received his law degree in 1905, was a longtime leader of the right-of-centre Colorado (National Republican) Party. When his party served in a coalition government in 1946, Chaves was appointed to the Supreme Court. He served as Paraguay's foreign minister from 1947. He was elected in April 1949 as President of the Chamber of Representativeshttps://books.google.fi/books?id=tYjhpnDHHF0Chttps://www.csj.gov.py/cache/lederes/P-1-011949-L-70-0.pdfhttps://www.csj.gov.py/cache/lederes/P-1-011949-L-85-0.pdf, and kept that post until he became president in September 1949. He was elected for a three-year term in 1950 and later reelected in 1953.
