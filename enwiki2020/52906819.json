    "text": "The C&C; 30 is a series of Canadian and American sailboats, that was first built in 1973. The initial models were built by C&C; Yachts of Niagara on the Lake, Ontario, in Canada. The newest model, the C&C; 30 One Design, was built by USWatercraft, LLC under the C&C; brand, in Newport, Rhode Island until their entry into receivership in July 2017. ==Design== The C&C; 30 series are all small recreational and racing keelboats, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. There have been four boats to carry the C&C; 30 designation, each a completely different design. ==Operational history== In a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, \"The C&C; 30 probably did more than any other boat to establish the 30 foot size range in the minds of many Canadian sailors. Like the C&C; 27, it also has to be considered a classic among the production fiberglass boats built in the country. In fact, its appearance and layout is very similar to the C&C; 27, just more of everything, including some extra elbow room down below. This is a well built boat with good performance, and it did much to elevate C&C; to the status of one of North America's premier sailboat manufacturers during the 1970s and 1980s.\" ==Variants== ;C&C; 30-1 (Mark 1) :This model was designed by Cuthbertson & Cassian, introduced in 1973 and over 800 were built. It has a length overall of , a waterline length of , displaces , carries of lead ballast and has a masthead sloop rig. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel and with the optional shoal draft keel. The boat was initially fitted with a Universal Atomic 4 gasoline engine. This was replaced with a Japanese Yanmar QM15 diesel engine and later a Yanmar 2GM diesel. It has a hull speed of . Later boats built had a large number of small changes to the design, including new windows and rudder mounts Robert Ball commented on the C&C; 30 Mk.1, noting George Harding Cuthbertson's guidance: > The C&C; 30 was my first Lines Drawing, but it was Big George telling me > what to do.

Although more 27s were built, in excess of 1,000, over a similar 12-year production period, with four distinct design phases, the 27 underwent comparatively continual change in relation to the 30, having only the one design version. According to Steve Kiemele, of South Shore Yachts, \"The 30 didn't need any changes, it held its appeal. This makes it 'The Classic'.\" C&C; 30-2 (Mark 2) ;C&C; 30-2 (Mark 2) :This later model was designed by Robert W. Ball and introduced in 1988.
