    "text": "The laying on of hands is a religious practice. In Judaism semikhah (, \"leaning [of the hands]\") accompanies the conferring of a blessing or authority. In Christian churches, this practice is used as both a symbolic and formal method of invoking the Holy Spirit primarily during baptisms and confirmations, healing services, blessings, and ordination of priests, ministers, elders, deacons, and other church officers, along with a variety of other church sacraments and holy ceremonies. The practice of laying on of hands is also used in Navajo religious ceremonies. ==Jewish tradition== The laying on of hands was an action referred to on numerous occasions in the Hebrew Bible to accompany the conferring of a blessing or authority. Moses ordained Joshua through semikhah\u2014i.e. by the laying on of hands: , . The Bible adds that Joshua was thereby \"filled with the spirit of wisdom\". Moses also ordained the 70 elders (). The elders later ordained their successors in this way. Their successors in turn ordained others. This chain of hands-on semikhah continued through the time of the Second Temple, to an undetermined time. The exact date that the original semikhah succession ended is not certain. Many medieval authorities believed that this occurred during the reign of Hillel II, circa 360 CE.Nachmanides, Sefer Hazekhut, Gittin ch 4; Rabbenu Nissim, ibid; Sefer Haterumot, Gate 45; R Levi ibn Haviv, Kuntras Hasemikhah. However, it seems to have continued at least until 425 CE when Theodosius II executed Gamaliel VI and suppressed the Patriarchate and Sanhedrin. ==Christian traditions== Laying on of hands Finnish Lutheran ordination in Oulu, Finland Laying on of hands during a priestly ordination catholic, in Germany In the New Testament the laying on of hands was associated with the receiving of the Holy Spirit (see Acts ).

The rite of the king's touch began in France with Robert II the Pious, but legend later attributed the practice to Clovis as Merovingian founder of the Holy Roman kingdom, and Edward the Confessor in England. The belief continued to be common throughout the Middle Ages but began to die out with the Enlightenment. Queen Anne was the last British monarch to claim to possess this divine ability, though the Jacobite pretenders also claimed to do so. The French monarchy maintained the practice up until the 19th century. The act was usually performed at large ceremonies, often at Easter or other holy days. ==See also== *Anointing *Exorcism *Faith healing *Gifts of healing *Gift of miracles *Holy anointing oil *Hypnosis *Manual therapy *Ordination *Pneumatology *Priesthood blessing *Reiki *Right hand of Christian fellowship *Snake handling *Speaking in tongues *Spiritual gift *Spirituality *Superstition *Thaumaturgy ==Notes== ==References== * New Bible Dictionary () * * * * * == External links == *ScienceMuseum.org.uk's King's Evil and the Royal Touch Category:Religious rituals ",
