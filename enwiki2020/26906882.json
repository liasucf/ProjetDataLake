The team went on to win the event in 2007, 2009 and 2010 and quickly became a magnet for endurance athletes with diabetes. 2008 Team Novo Nordisk turned professional in 2008 after success in amateur races. In 2010 it had a UCI Continental licence but became a Professional Continental team in 2011, with a view to competing in the Giro d'Italia in 2011 and the Tour de France in 2012. The team had originally aimed to achieve the Professional Contintental level for the 2010 season but decided against applying for an upgraded licence because of fears that it might preclude the team from competing in events outside the responsibility of the International Cycling Union and a lack of knowledge by the team's management of the scale of investment that would be required to compete at the higher level. 2009 In 2009, Team Novo Nordisk won the Race Across America, having entered a team of cyclists who all had type 1 diabetes. The team has also competed in a number of major professional events, such as the Tour of California and the Tour de Langkawi, and picked up two stage wins in the 2010 Tour du Maroc. 2010 Team Novo Nordisk has competed in a number of major professional events, such as the Tour of California and the Tour de Langkawi and picked up two stage wins in the 2010 Tour du Maroc.
