    "text": "System 7 is the first studio album by the dance/ambient band System 7. A somewhat different version was released in the United States as 777 by 777. The running order is different, there are different mixes of two tracks (taken from the \"Miracle\" single), and it has two tracks from the \"Freedom Fighters\" single \u2013 \"Depth Disco\" and \"Mia\". Just to confuse matters, 777 was also the title of System 7's second UK album, with completely different music. With several vocal tracks, this album has rather a different feel from later System 7 albums. Aniff Cousins appears on \"Freedom Fighters\" (with Zo\u00eb providing chorus vocals) and \"Dog\", and Olu Rowe on \"Habibi\", \"Bon Humeur\" and \"Strange Quotations\". == Track listing == === System 7 === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! # !!
