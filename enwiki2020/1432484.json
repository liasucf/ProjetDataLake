On 28 September 2018, the city suffered many casualties due to a tsunami, where at least 2,256 people lost their lives, while many others are still buried under the rubble and presumed dead. == Etymology == The name of Palu comes from the word Topalu'e (the elevated land) because this area was meant to be the ocean. There was an earthquake and plate shift (palu koro) so that the area that was once the sea was lifted and formed the land that is now Palu. Another source mentions that the word origin of Palu comes from the Kaili word Volo, a term of bamboo that grows from the Tawaeli area to the Sigi region. Bamboo is very closely related to the Kaili tribe, this is due to they dependence of bamboo usage as their daily needs, whether it be used as foodstuffs (bamboo shoot), building materials (walls, mats, etc.), daily equipment, games (tilako), as well as musical instruments (lalove). ==History== The palace of the princes of Palu The Dutch controleur's residence in the 1930s Palu originated from a unity of four villages; namely Besusu, Tanggabanggo (Siranindi, now Kamonji), Panggovia (now Lere) and Boyantongo (now Kelurahan Baru). They formed a customary council called Patanggota. One of their assignments was to elect the king and his assistants for royal activities. The kingdom, which would be known as the Palu Kingdom, eventually became one of the well-known and very powerful kingdom. The Dutch first visited Palu during the reign of King Maili (Mangge Risa) to get protection from Manado in 1868.

After the Kayumalue war, King Maili was killed by the Dutch and his body was brought to Palu. He was succeeded by King Jodjokodi, on 1 May 1888 he signed a short agreement to the Dutch East Indies colonial authority. The town was part of the Dutch Empire until Indonesia won independence in 1945\u201349. The Dutch controleurs house survives as a testament of that era. ===CIA air raids=== In April 1958 during the Permesta rebellion in North Sulawesi, the USA supported and supplied the rebels.
