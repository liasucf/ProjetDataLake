    "text": "Clear Lake State Park is a state park of California, USA, on Clear Lake. The park is popular for water recreation. Amenities include 149 developed campsites spread across four campground areas, two group campsites, a swimming beach with showers, a boat launch, and a marina. Since the area is a major breeding ground for grebes, there's a broad \"no wake\" zone in the Cole Creek launch area and near the reedy shoreline, which is conducive to canoeing and kayaking. The park was established in 1949. ==Proposed for closure== Clear Lake State Park was one of the 48 California state parks proposed for closure in January 2008 and again in Fall 2009, as part of a deficit reduction program.CBS5.com: List Of Calif.
