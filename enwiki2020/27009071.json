She was one of a small number of U-boats fitted with Hellmuth Walter's high test peroxide propulsion system, which offered a combination of air-independent propulsion and high submerged speeds. She spent the war as a trials vessel and was scuttled on 5 May 1945 in Gelting Bay. U-794 was built by Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft, Kiel. The keel was laid down on 1 February 1943, the boat was launched on 7 October. She was commissioned on 14 November. The Feldpost Number was M 52 496. U-794 did not undertake any combat patrols and was instead assigned as a trials boat at first to the 5th U-boat Flotilla, followed by the 8th U-boat Flotilla, before returning to the 5th flotilla for the rest of the war. In late March 1944, Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz and four other admirals took part in a trial of U-794. Although they were enthusiastic, the boat, designed for high underwater speed (over 20 m.p.h.) was difficult to manoeuvre, and the keel to beam ratio was too high. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * *\"U-Boat Operations of the Second World War: Vol. 2: Career histories, U511-UIT25\" by Kenneth Wynn, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, 1998. ==External links== * * * Category:German Type XVII submarines Category:1943 ships Category:U-boats commissioned in 1943 Category:World War II submarines of Germany Category:World War II shipwrecks in the North Sea Category:Ships built in Kiel Category:Operation Regenbogen (U-boat) Category:Maritime incidents in May 1945 ",
