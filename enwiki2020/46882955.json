The new theatre was built in 1889. In order to keep something from the old theatre in the walls of the building were buried coins, a history of the theatre and a list with the names of the officials from that time.Romanian: http://www.teatruldenord.ro/c/1/ISTORIC The first show of the local theatre took place in 1790 under the guidance of Moricz Gyrogy. Between 1814 and 1816 are attested shows performed by troupes from Oradea and Debrecen and in 1918, theatre groups conducted by Bernat Filep. Until 1848, the shows were performed at the \"Green Tree\" Tavern (Romanian: Hanul \"Arborele Verde\"), but also in places like Jena\u2019s House (Romanian: Casa Jenei) built in 1790 and the Kotro Garden (Romanian: Gr\u0103dina Kotro), where the famous artist Korn\u00e9lia Prielle started her career. After 1 December 1918, the theatrical movement from Satu Mare was under the direction of G. M. Zamfirescu, who between 1922 and 1924 organizes shows with amateur actors from the city. In 1932 the theatre group from The Bucharest National Theatre comes to Satu Mare and performs Hamlet by Shakespeare. After years of Hungarian theatre (since 1956), in 1968 the Romanian theatrical department is being established under the guidance of George Matache. Together, the two departments will form the cultural institution The North Theatre. ==Architecture== The North theatre was built in a neoclassical style with one floor. The fa\u00e7ade is made up of three parts and the central part is detached in a semicircular profile, with a dome type roof. The entrance is supported by piles. The windows of the fa\u00e7ade are arched and framed by decorative triangular gables. The auditorium is decorated with details specific to the era and can hold up to 800 people. The architects of the theatre were Voijta Adolf and Szikszay and the interior designers were Spanraft and Hirsch. == References == Category:Theatres in Romania Category:Buildings and structures in Satu Mare Category:Neoclassical architecture in Romania ",
