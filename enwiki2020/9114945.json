The 010, like all Tyrrells before it was powered by the Ford-Cosworth DFV V8 engine and made its competition debut in the third race of the season in South Africa. The 010s were driven by Frenchman Jean-Pierre Jarier and Irishman Derek Daly, with New Zealander Mike Thackwell driving a third car at the last two races of the season. The team continued using the 010 in . Americans Eddie Cheever and Kevin Cogan drove in the season-opening U.S. West Grand Prix, but Cogan was replaced for the next two races by Argentinian Ricardo Zunino, who himself was replaced from Round 4 at Imola by Italian Michele Alboreto. Alboreto who was making his F1 debut and the first of an eventual 194 starts from 215 attempts in Formula One in a career which would see 5 wins, 2 pole positions, 23 podium finishes and runner up in the World Drivers' Championship while driving for Ferrari. The 010 was replaced in the middle of the 1981 season by the new 011. The last race for the 010 was the 1981 Austrian Grand Prix where Alboreto qualified 22nd and retired after 40 laps with gearbox failure. The best placings for the 010 were two 4th places: one for Daly in the 1980 British Grand Prix, and another for Cheever at the 1981 British Grand Prix, his last race in the 010 before switching to the 011 in Germany. Tyrrell scored 9 of their 12 points in 1980 and 8 of their 10 points in 1981 with the 010. ==Complete Formula One World Championship results== (key) (results in italics indicate fastest lap, results in bold indicate pole position) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- !
