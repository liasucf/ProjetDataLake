    "text": "Nicolas-Luton Durival (13 November 1713, in Commercy \u2013 21 December 1795, in Heillecourt) was an 18th-century Lorrain civil servant, historian and geographer who became French after 1766. == Biography == The elder son of Jean-Baptiste Luton Durival, Nicolas Durival spent his entire career in the Lorraine administration. Having a good education, he was placed in the offices of the Intendance of the Duchy of Lorraine, and applied himself fully to acquire the knowledge necessary to an administrator. Struck with the imperfection of the works that existed on the topography of Lorraine, he formed the project to write one that would depart from the drought classifications and the prolixity of particular stories, contain accurate records on cities, towns and villages of this country. He published various essays to better understand if the project would be enjoyed and to request help from enlightened people ; he finally brought out, after twenty years of work and research, a Description de la Lorraine et du Barrois which was regarded, rightly, as a model of this kind of works. He was then clerk of Stanislas Leszczynski's State Council, and finally lieutenant de police in Nancy. Durival was a member of the Acad\u00e9mie de Nancy since 1760 and communicated to the company a lot of memories on objects of public utility. His police lieutenant position having been abolished in 1790, he was appointed city manager. Though he had occupied gainful employment for most of his life, he remained poor and was included in the number of scholars to which the Convention granted relief in 1795. Durival collaborated with the Encyclop\u00e9die by Diderot. He is the author of several books on the history, customs, agriculture, geography and customs of Lorraine. == Publications == *1753: M\u00e9moire sur la Lorraine et le Barrois, suivi de la Table alphab\u00e9tique..., etc., Nancy, in-4\u00b0. The previous year, Durival had a small number of copies printed for distribution to friends. Henriquez inserted the complete alphabetical table in his Abr\u00e9g\u00e9 chronologique de l\u2019Histoire de Lorraine, of which it forms the second volume, without naming the author. *1748: Table alphab\u00e9tique des villes, bourgs, villages et hameaux de la Lorraine et du Barrois, Nancy, in- 8\u00b0. This table was reprinted the following year, with additions, and a third time in 1766. Abbot Expilly inserted it in his Dictionnaire g\u00e9ographique de la France, with praises of the author. *1754: Coutume particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 la Bresse, village de Lorraine, Nancy, in-8\u00b0 *1756: Principes sur le pacage, le vain p\u00e2turage et le parcours, Nancy, in-8\u00b0 ; Nancy, Impr. de Ve et C. Leseure, 1766, in-8\u00b0, 7 p. (reproduction of the article Pacage of the Encyclop\u00e9die, with only a legal and customary explanation of the terms pacage, vain p\u00e2turage and parcours) *1763: M\u00e9moire sur la cl\u00f4ture des h\u00e9ritages, le vain p\u00e2turage et le parcours, en Lorraine, Nancy, Thomas p\u00e8re et fils, in-8\u00b0, 15 p. *1774: Introduction \u00e0 la description de la Lorraine et du Barrois, Nancy, in-8\u00b0 *1778\u20131779/79\u20131783 Description de la Lorraine et du Barrois, Nancy, 4 vol. in-4\u00b0. The fourth volume has become rarer than the three others, the remaining copies at the bookseller having been sold to a grocer during the Revolution. We can look at this work as the result of all studies by Durival: the facts are presented methodically, the style is nice, and the many indications of scrupulous accuracy. The introduction, which is the first volume, is a complete history of Lorraine from Reinier Le long cou, first beneficiary Duke of Lorraine (959), until the death of Stanislas. In his Biblioth\u00e8que physico-\u00e9conomique, Sonnini inserted three memoirs by Durival : * Consid\u00e9rations sur les plantations de la Lorraine, June 1809. * Th\u00e9orie de Leopold 1er, duc de Lorraine, pour la construction et l\u2019entretien des routes, October 1809. * Comparaison des effets du r\u00e9gime actuel des chauss\u00e9es avec ceux qui r\u00e9sultent des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de la th\u00e9orie de L\u00e9opold 1er, November 1809. == Sources == * Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Michaud, Louis-Gabriel Michaud, Biographie universelle, Paris, C.
