It recounts the story of two Iraq veterans, Tom Voss and Anthony Anderson, who, in an attempt to put their combat experience behind them, embark on a 2,700-mile trek on foot across America. It made its world premiere on the opening night of the Telluride Mountainfilm Festival on 27 May 2016. After its theatrical run, it aired on the PBS series POV. ==Premise== Two very troubled veterans of the war in Iraq, Tom Voss and Anthony Anderson, decide to walk from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Los Angeles \u2013 over 2,700 miles, taking 155 days \u2013 to help them heal from the combat experiences that haunt them. Along the way, the two men raised awareness of the unrelenting pain of moral injury many vets face and encouraged them to seek treatment. ==Cast== * Thomas Voss * Anthony Anderson ==Response== The Hollywood Reporter stated, Almost Sunrise makes for powerful viewing. While its principal subjects are clearly in a better place at the film's conclusion, the fact remains that thousands of other veterans are still floundering. If Almost Sunrise succeeds in helping even a handful of them find firmer ground, it will have done its noble job. Human Rights Watch Film Festival: Almost Sunrise is an intimate, v\u00e9rit\u00e9 film that eschews stereotypes, and instead, captures an unprecedented portrait of veterans \u2013 one of hope, potential and untold possibilities. == References == == External links == * * * Almost Sunrise on POV Category:2016 films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:2016 documentary films ",
