He succeeded as Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe on the death of his father on the 8 May 1893 and reigned until his death on the 29 April 1911 at B\u00fcckeburg and was succeeded by his son who became Adolf II. ==Family== Georg was married on the 16 April 1882 at Altenburg to Princess Marie Anne of Saxe-Altenburg, a daughter of Prince Moritz of Saxe-Altenburg. They had nine children: *Prince Adolf II (1883\u20131936) *Prince Moritz Georg (1884\u20131920) *Prince Peter (1886-1886) *Prince Wolrad (1887\u20131962) *Prince Stephan (1891\u20131965) *Prince Heinrich (1894\u20131952) *Princess Margaretha (1896\u20131897) *Prince Friedrich Christian (1906\u20131983) *Princess Elisabeth (1908\u20131933) ===Silver wedding anniversary=== On the occasion of their silver wedding anniversary in 1907, Emperor Wilhelm II presented to Georg and Marie Anne the family ancestral seat, Schaumburg Castle. The castle had been controlled by the Hohenzollerns ever since Georg's grandfather sided with the Austrians in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War. The gift was also meant to be in recognition of Georg's support in the dispute over the succession to the Lippe-Detmold throne. ==Ancestry== ==References== ==External links== Category:1846 births Category:1911 deaths Category:People from B\u00fcckeburg Category:House of Lippe Category:People from Schaumburg-Lippe Category:Princes of Schaumburg-Lippe Category:Recipients of the House Order of Fidelity Category:Recipients of the Order of Henry the Lion Category:Grand Crosses of the Saxe-Ernestine House Order Category:Recipients of the Order of the White Falcon Category:Knights of the Order of Saint Hubert ",
