He was also the co-founder of the academic journal Evaluation & the Health Professions, and served as its editor-in-chief for more than three decades. An expert on research methods, he is known for criticizing alternative medicine, saying that alternative medical treatments are little to no more effective than placebos. He is the author of the book Snake Oil Science: The Truth About Complementary and Alternative Medicine, published in 2007 by Oxford University Press. He has also written a book about teaching in the United States and how he feels it could be improved, entitled \"Too Simple to Fail\". ==References== Category:Living people Category:Critics of alternative medicine Category:University of Maryland, Baltimore faculty Category:Biostatisticians Category:1942 births Category:American statisticians Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Academic journal editors ",
