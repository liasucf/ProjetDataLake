    "text": "Groove Records was a subsidiary of RCA Victor records, founded by Billboard writer Bob Rolontz in 1953 as a rhythm and blues label. The label tried hard to break into the R&B; market. Piano Red was its first hit but Mickey & Sylvia was its first big seller. The label also recorded King Curtis, Arthur Crudup, Brook Benton and little George Benson. Following Mickey & Sylvia's big hit \"Love Is Strange\" in 1957, Groove was deactivated and its remaining artists switched over to RCA's Vik subsidiary. In 1961, Groove was revived as a budget singles label with more of a country music bent, and some pop and R&B; acts.https://americanradiohistory.com/Archive- Billboard/60s/1961/Billboard%201961-10-09.pdf It was given a full revival in 1963.
