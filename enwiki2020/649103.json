Strzy\u017c\u00f3w is one of the towns within the Strzy\u017cowsko-Dynowskie Foothill, located south-east of Krak\u00f3w and 30 km from Rzesz\u00f3w. According to statistics from June 30, 2010 from GUS (the Central Statistical Office in Poland), there are 8,782 inhabitants. ==History== Legendary history of Strzy\u017c\u00f3w dates back to 9th century, the times of Wi\u015blanie (tribe) when a pagan Wi\u015blicki prince is said to have built a watchtower by Stobnica and Wis\u0142ok River called Strze\u017cno, for the defence of eastern borders of his land. In 1279 in Buda (Hungary) Pope's legate, bishop Philip confirmed the abbot's right to take a special tax (a tithe) from Czudec and Strzy\u017c\u00f3w. Strzy\u017c\u00f3w obtained city rights between 1373 and 1397. The town was surrounded by a soil defence embankment (Zawale street still exists and it relates to that embankment). These were the times of town splendour and its development, craft, farming and trade contracts with other towns in Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. In 1373, Strzy\u017c\u00f3w came into the hands of a knight, Wojtko, and later Pakosz and his sons Jan and Miko\u0142aj. With time the town changed its owners. On 15 August 1769 the Bar Confederats made an oath in front of the painting of Immaculate Mary in Strzy\u017c\u00f3w, in the presence of Kazimierz Pu\u0142aski and Franciszek Trzecielski. After this event, that image appeared on the Confedersats\u2019 Banner. Throughout its history Strzy\u017c\u00f3w suffered from as many as nine fires, the last one in 1895 caused the beginning of brick town. In 1796 the foundation of secular school strengthened town development as well as royal permission for organisation of four fairs a year. In 1880 Strzy\u017c\u00f3w was inhabited mostly by Polish people but there were also some minorities such as Jews and Germans. 1960s and 1970s gave beginning to industrialisation of town when many factories, companies, schools and culture centres were found. == Schools == * Adam Mickiewicz Secondary School * Technical Schools * Municipal Schools * White Eagle Primary School No. 1 * Maria Konopnicka Primary School No. 2 * Public Middle School No. 1 * Zygmunt Mycielski National School of Music - 1st degree * Career Development Center ==International relations== ===Twin towns \u2014 Sister cities=== Strzy\u017c\u00f3w is twinned with: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- valign=\"top\" | * Bagnacavallo in Italy * Ciss\u00e9 in France * Horodok in Ukraine || * Kisv\u00e1rda in Hungary * Lassee in Austria * Svidn\u00edk in Slovakia |} ==See also== *Lendians *Great Moravia *Ostsiedlung *Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria *Ruthenian Voivodeship *Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship *Pog\u00f3rzanie ==References== ;Notes Category:Cities and towns in Podkarpackie Voivodeship Category:Strzy\u017c\u00f3w County Category:Lesser Poland Category:Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Category:Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship ",
