While the mother in a panic runs for help to the neighbors, Valery cuts off the wounded finger, gives the daughter vodka and kills the dog. At night, Vera goes to the steppe to bury the animal, where she encounters Pavel: he still wanders around their house. Together they bury the dog's corpse. Vera returns and finds that her daughter feels worse and that her neighbors took her to the nearest hospital. Valery is asleep, having got drunk from vodka. Together with Valery, Vera runs to the bank of the river where they see Pavel's motor boat. He agrees to take them by the waterway to the hospital. During the trip Valery notes that Vera's dress is all soiled in the mud, and strikes her hard against the side of the boat. Pavel immediately stops the boat at the shore, throws Valery out of the boat and together with Vera steers away. Valery returns home, takes a rifle and ammunition, sets fire to the hut and goes out to find them. Meanwhile, Vera and Pavel become lovers. In the hospital, they do not find her daughter: it turns out that the neighbors have already taken her back home. Pavel offers Vera to take her daughter and stay with him. In the meantime Valery having gotten drunk from vodka, kills a cow on the field to see if he is able to kill a living being, and then sits on the shore in anticipation of Pavel's boat. The couple appears soon. Valery slays Pavel in several shots and injures Vera. Pavel protects the woman using his body as a shield and together they sail in the blood-filled boat with the still living Vera, before it begins to sink from the bullet holes. ==Reception== * * * ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2006 films Category:Russian films Category:2006 romantic drama films Category:Russian romantic drama films Category:2006 drama films ",
