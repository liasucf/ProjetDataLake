    "text": "Alfred Kazin (June 5, 1915 - June 5, 1998) was an American writer and literary critic. He wrote often about the immigrant experience in early twentieth century America. ==Early life== Like many of the other New York Intellectuals, Alfred Kazin was the son of Jewish immigrants, born in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and a graduate of the City College of New York. However, his politics were more moderate than most of the New York Intellectuals, many of whom were socialists. ==Career== Kazin was deeply affected by his peers' subsequent disillusion with socialism and liberalism. Adam Kirsch writes in The New Republic that \"having invested his romantic self-image in liberalism, Kazin perceived abandonment of liberalism by his peers as an attack on his identity\". He wrote out of a great passion\u2014or great disgust\u2014for what he was reading and embedded his opinions in a deep knowledge of history, both literary history and politics and culture. In 1996 he was awarded the first Truman Capote Lifetime Achievement Award in Literary Criticism, which carries a cash reward of $100,000. As of 2014, the only other person to have won the award was George Steiner.\"Alfred Kazin Papers \u2013 Overview\". New York Public Library.
