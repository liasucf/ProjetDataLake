It has been in service since August 2000 and is operated on a common carrier basis. AMERICAS-II consists of three interconnected rings (North, South, and West Systems), each operating at 2.5 gigabits per second ( Gbit/s), initially in separate collapsed ring configurations, and a dedicated link between Cura\u00e7ao and Venezuela not operating in a collapsed ring configuration. Each fiber pair in each of the three systems will have a capacity of thirty-two 155 megabits per second ( Mbit/s) OC-3 Basic System Modules (BSM), with each BSM containing 63 Minimum Investment Units (MIUs) and equipped at the outset for a capacity of 1008 MIUs.
