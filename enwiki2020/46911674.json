    "text": "The Indian Naval Ensign (also known as the Indian White Ensign) is a naval ensign used by ships of the Indian Navy. The blue ensign of the Star of India was used from 1879\u20131928 as the naval ensign of Her Majesty's Indian Marine (1879-1892) and then the Royal Indian Marine (1892-1928). It then became the naval jack and was used from 1928\u20131947 by the Royal Indian Marine (1928-1934) and then the Royal Indian Navy (1934-1950). The white ensign of the Royal Navy was used from 1928\u20131950 as the naval ensign of the Royal Indian Marine and then the Royal Indian Navy. The Flag of India has been used since 1947 as the naval jack of the Indian Navy. From 26 January 1950, when India became a republic, until 2001, the Indian Navy used a modified version of the British Naval Ensign, with the Union Flag replaced with the Indian Tricolor in the canton. In the early 1970s, Vice Admiral Vivian E. C. Barboza, later the FOC- in-C Western Naval Command, suggested replacing the old naval ensign. With effect from 15 August 2001, this flag was replaced with a white ensign bearing the Indian Navy crest, as the previous ensign was thought to reflect India's colonial past. However complaints arose that the new ensign was indistinguishable as the blue of the naval crest easily merged with the sky and the ocean. Hence in 2004, the ensign was changed back to the St. George's cross design, with the addition of the emblem of India in the intersection of the cross. On 15 August 2014, the ensign as well as the naval crest was further updated to correct the omission of the national motto in Devanagari script: \u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f\u092e\u0947\u0935 \u091c\u092f\u0924\u0947 (Satyameva Jayate) which means 'Truth Alone Triumphs' in Sanskrit. {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |+ Indian naval flags !
