    "text": "In Greek mythology, Pelasgus (, Pelasg\u00f3s means \"ancient\"Robert Graves. The Greek Myths, section 12 s.v. Hera and her Children) also known as Gelanor, was an Inachid king of Argos. He was the son of Sthenelas, son of Crotopus, son of Agenor, son of Triopas.Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 2.16.1 Yet according to others, Pelasgus was a son of Arestor, and grandson of Iasus, and immigrated into Arcadia, where he founded the town of Parrhasia.Scholia on Euripides Orestes 1642 ; Stephanus of Byzantium s. v. Parrhasia. In some accounts his father was the autochthon Palaechthon.Aeschylus, Suppliant Women 340 ff == Mythology == Pelasgus welcomed Danaus and the Dana\u00efdes when they fled from Aegyptus. === In The Suppliants === In Aeschylus' play The SuppliantsAeschylus, Suppliant Women (ed. Herbert Weir Smyth, Ph. D.)I am Pelasgus, offspring of Palaechthon, whom the earth brought forth, and lord of this land; and after me, their king, is rightly named the race of the Pelasgi, who harvest the land.Of all the region through which the pure Strymon flows, on the side toward the setting sun, I am the lord.There lies within the limits of my rule the land of the Perrhaebi, the parts beyond Pindus close to the Paeonians, and the mountain ridge of Dodona; the edge of the watery sea borders my kingdom. I rule up to these boundaries. The ground where we stand is Apian land itself, and has borne that name since antiquity in honor of a healer. For Apis, seer and healer,the son of Apollo, came from Naupactus on the farther shore and purified this land of monsters deadly to man, which Earth, defiled by the pollution of bloody deeds of old, caused to spring up-- plagues charged with wrath, an ominous colony of swarming serpents. Of these plagues Apis worked the cure by sorcery and spells to the content of the Argive land, and for reward thereafter earned for himself remembrance in prayers. Now that you have my testimony, declare your lineage and speak further--yet our people do not take pleasure in long discourse. -Greek text- the Dana\u00efdes fleeing from Egypt seek asylum from King Pelasgus of Argos, which he says is on the Strymon including Perrhaebia in the north, Dodona and the slopes of the Pindus mountains on the west and the shores of the sea on the east;Aeschylus. The Suppliants, Lines 249-259. that is, a territory including or north of the Thessalian Pelasgiotis. The southern boundary is not mentioned; however, Apis is said to have come to Argos from Naupactus \"across\" (peras),Aeschylus. The Suppliants, Lines 262-263. implying that Argos includes all of east Greece from the north of Thessaly to the Peloponnesian Argos, where the Dana\u00efdes are probably to be conceived as having landed. He claims to rule the Pelasgians and to be the \"child of Palaichthon ('ancient earth') whom the earth brought forth.\" The Dana\u00efdes call the country the \"Apian hills\" and claim that it understands the karbana audan,Aeschylus. The Suppliants, Lines 128-129 .(accusative case, and in standard choral Doric dialect) which many translate as \"barbarian speech\" but Karba (where live the Karbanoi) is in fact a non-Greek word. They claim to descend from ancestors in ancient Argos even though they are of a \"dark race\" (melanthes ... genos).Aeschylus. The Suppliants, Lines 154-155. Pelasgus admits that the land was once called Apia but compares them to the women of Libya and EgyptAeschylus. The Suppliants, Lines 279-281. and wants to know how they can be from Argos on which they cite descent from Io. In a lost play by Aeschylus, Danaan Women, he defines the original homeland of the Pelasgians as the region around Mycenae.Strabo.
