    "text": "Connor Njegovan (born June 23, 1992) is a Canadian curler from Winnipeg, Manitoba. He currently plays lead on Team Jason Gunnlaugson. ==Career== ===Juniors=== Njegovan made his first and only Canadian Junior Curling Championships appearance in 2010 playing second for the Alex Forrest rink. The team finished the round robin in first place only suffering two losses to Northern Ontario and Saskatchewan. This meant the team had an automatic bye to the final. There, they faced Ontario who they had previously beaten in the round robin. Unfortunately, the team gave up two in the final end to lose the game 8\u20137. Njegovan curled an average 81% during the round robin. ===Men's=== Njegovan played for the Jeff Stoughton rink for the 2014\u201315 season, which would be Stoughton's last. The team played in four Grand Slam of Curling events but only qualified in one, the 2014 Masters. At the 2015 Manitoba provincials, the team qualified for the championship round as the third seed. They defeated Braden Calvert 6\u20134 in the 3 vs. 4 game before being eliminated in the semi-final by the Mike McEwen rink. The following year at the 2016 Viterra Championship, his rink of Alex Forrest, Travis Bale and Ian McMillan failed to make the final four championship round after losing the Double Knockout qualifier against Matt Dunstone 7\u20133. Njegovan joined Dunstone the following season with Forrest and McMillan to try to qualify for the Brier again at the 2017 Viterra Championship. But once again, his team would be bested in the Double Knockout round, this time to Jason Gunnlaugson. For the 2017\u201318 season, Njegovan would once again stay with Forrest and McMillan but would bring on Gunnlaugson to skip the team. The team had a successful Grand Slam season, playing in every slam and qualifying in six of their seven events including winning the 2017 Tour Challenge Tier 2. However at the 2018 Viterra Championship, the team struggled going 1\u20132 in the Double Knockout bracket and missing the playoffs. The team had a less successful following season, only playing five slam and qualifying in one of them. At this years provincials, the team qualified for the Championship Round as the number one seed. But they fell apart in the playoffs, losing the 1 vs. 2 game against Carruthers and the semifinal against Lyburn. The team did get to represent Canada at the Second Leg of the 2018-19 Curling World Cup, where they went 1\u20135. The team won the 2019 Cargill Curling Training Centre Icebreaker to start the 2019\u201320 season. They also won the Mother Club Fall Curling Classic and the Ed Werenich Golden Wrench Classic. Njegovan won his first Provincial title at the 2020 Viterra Championship after defeating the Mike McEwen rink 7\u20134 in the final. Team Gunnlaugson represented Manitoba at the 2020 Tim Hortons Brier, where they finished in eighth place with a 5\u20136 record. ==Coaching== During the 2019\u201320 season, Njegovan coached the Sayaka Yoshimura team from Japan. He coached them to a bronze medal finish at the 2020 Japan Curling Championships and a runner- up finish at the 2019 Masters Grand Slam event. ==Personal life== Njegovan is married to fellow curler Selena Njegovan. He is currently a real estate agent with Royal LePage - The Neufeld Group. He attended the University of Manitoba. ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Season ! scope=\"col\"| Skip ! scope=\"col\"| Third ! scope=\"col\"| Second ! scope=\"col\"| Lead |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2009\u201310 | Alex Forrest || Joey Witherspoon || Connor Njegovan || Mike Neufeld |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2011\u201312 | Joey Witherspoon || Connor Njegovan || Taylor McIntyre || Brett Brezden |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2012\u201313 | Kyle Doering || Connor Njegovan || Derek Oryniak || Kyle Kurz |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2013\u201314 | William Lyburn || Alex Forrest || Connor Njegovan || Tyler Forrest |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2014\u201315 | Jeff Stoughton || Rob Fowler || Alex Forrest || Connor Njegovan |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2015\u201316 | Alex Forrest || Travis Bale || Ian McMillan || Connor Njegovan |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2016\u201317 | Matt Dunstone || Alex Forrest || Ian McMillan || Connor Njegovan |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2017\u201318 | Jason Gunnlaugson || Alex Forrest || Ian McMillan || Connor Njegovan |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2018\u201319 | Jason Gunnlaugson || Alex Forrest || Denni Neufeld || Connor Njegovan |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2019\u201320 | Jason Gunnlaugson || Alex Forrest || Adam Casey || Connor Njegovan |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2020\u201321 | Jason Gunnlaugson || Adam Casey || Matt Wozniak || Connor Njegovan |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 births Category:Canadian male curlers Category:Curlers from Manitoba Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Winnipeg Category:University of Manitoba alumni Category:Canadian real estate agents ",
