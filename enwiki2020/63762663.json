They are notable for having penned the post-apocalyptic iyashikei manga, Girls' Last Tour, and the four-panel surreal comedy manga, Shimeji Simulation. == Biography == Tsukumizu has been reading extensively since they were in primary school, and read novels all through upper secondary. They cite Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood and Dance Dance Dance, and Kaori Ekuni's Kirakira Hikaru as having influenced the themes behind Girls' Last Tour. In upper secondary, they started to become interested in anime, and began drawing moe in their third year. This interest would bloom to encompass manga as well. Tsukumizu attended the Aichi University of Education, and wished to study painting to become an art teacher. At that temporal juncture, they only saw drawing manga as a hobby. As a post-secondary student, Tsukumizu loved war movies, especially Saving Private Ryan. The Kettenkrad that appears in Girls' Last Tour is an homage to the movie. In 2013, they published a Touhou Project d\u014djinshi, Flan Wants to Die, about an immortal y\u014dkai named Flan who longs to die. In their second year of post- secondary, Tsukumizu began drawing manga and was invited to a manga circle by a friend. They regularly uploaded their work on the Internet, and this caught the eye of someone at the publishing company Shinchosha. Their first commercially published work was Girls' Last Tour. Their next major series, Shimeji Simulation, started to be serialized in Media Factory's Comic Cune magazine on January 26, 2019. == Works == *Flan Wants to Die (2013) *Girls' Last Tour (2014\u20132018) *Shimeji Simulation (2019\u2013ongoing) == References == == External links == * * Category:Living people Category:Manga artists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
