    "text": "Immature fruitOpened fruit Flindersia pimenteliana, commonly known as maple silkwood, red beech or rose silkwood, is a species of tree in the family Rutaceae and is native to New Guinea and Queensland. It has pinnate leaves with three to seven egg-shaped to elliptic leaflets, panicles of red or reddish flowers and fruit studded with rough points. ==Description== Flindersia pimenteliana is a tree that typically grows to a height of . It has pinnate leaves long arranged in more or less opposite pairs with three to seven, egg-shaped to elliptic leaflets long and wide. The side leaflets are on a petiolule long and the end leaflet on a petiolule long. The flowers are arranged in panicles long, the five sepals about long and the five petals red or reddish and long. Flowering occurs from November to February and the fruit is a woody capsule long and studded with rough points up to long. The fruit opens into five valves, releasing winged seeds long. ==Taxonomy== Flindersia pimenteliana was first formally described in 1875 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from specimens collected near Rockingham Bay by John Dallachy. ==Distribution and habitat== Maple silkwood grows in rainforest in Australia and New Guinea. In Australia in grows at altitudes from and is found from Mount Finnigan (in Cedar Bay National Park) to Mount Fox in north Queensland. ==Uses== Good quality, decorative cabinet timber has been produced by this tree but because it is mostly only found in reserves, the timber is in very short supply. Attempts to grow this species in plantations have failed. ==Chemical constituents== F. pimenteliana contains tryptamine alkaloids known as pimentelamines. They are adducts of ascorbic acid. The plant also contains 2-isoprenyl-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, another tryptamine alkaloid, as well as 4-methylborreverine, borreverine, dimethylisoborreverine, quercitrin, and carpachromene. ==References== pimenteliana Category:Sapindales of Australia Category:Flora of Papua New Guinea Category:Flora of Western New Guinea Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Plants described in 1875 Category:Taxa named by Ferdinand von Mueller ",
