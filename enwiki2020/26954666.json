    "text": "The International Ten Metre Class is a construction class, meaning that the boats are not identical but are all designed to meet specific measurement formula, in this case International Rule. At their heyday, Metre Classes were the most important group of international yacht racing classes, and they are still actively raced around the world. \"Ten\" in class name does not, somewhat confusingly, refer to length of the boat, but product of the formula; 10mR boats are, on average, 16.5 meters long. == History == The 10mR was used as an Olympic Class during the 1912 and 1920 Olympics. The International Rule was set up in 1907 to replace earlier, simpler handicap system which were often local or at best, national, and often also fairly simple, producing extreme boats which were fast but lightly constructed and impractical. The rule changes several times in history. About 20 boats were ever build. == Rule development == === 1907 Rule === Used from 1907\u20131920 thumb : 10.000 \\mbox{ metres} = \\frac{L + B + 1/3G +3d + 1/3\\sqrt{S} - F}{2} where * L = waterline length (LWL) * B = beam * G = chain girth * d = difference between girth and chain * S = sail area * F = freeboard === 1919 Rule === Used from 1920\u20131933 thumb : 10.000 \\mbox{ metres} = \\frac{L + 0.25G +2d + \\sqrt{S} - F}{2.5} where * L = waterline length (LWL) * G = chain girth * d = difference between girth and chain * S = sail area * F = freeboard == Events == === Olympics === {| |- | style=\"align:center;\" | 1912 Stockholm details |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|Sweden Sweden (SWE) Filip Ericsson Carl Hellstr\u00f6m Paul Isberg Humbert Lund\u00e9n Herman Nyberg Harry Rosensw\u00e4rd Erik Wallerius Harald Wallin |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|Finland Finland (FIN) Harry Wahl Waldemar Bj\u00f6rkst\u00e9n Jacob Bj\u00f6rnstr\u00f6m Bror Brenner Allan Franck Erik Lindh Juho Aarne Pekkalainen |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|Russia Russia (RUS) Esper Beloselsky Ernest Brasche Karl Lindholm Nikolay Pushnitsky Aleksandr Rodionov Iosif Shomaker Philipp Strauch |- | style=\"align:center;\" | 1920 Antwerp 1907 rule details |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|Norway Norway (NOR) Erik Herseth Gunnar Jamvold Petter Jamvold Claus Juell Sigurd Holter Ingar Nielsen Ole S\u00f8rensen |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|No further competitors |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|No further competitors |- | style=\"align:center;\" | 1920 Antwerp 1919 rule details |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|Norway Norway (NOR) Charles Arentz Otto Falkenberg Robert Giertsen Willy Gilbert Halfdan Schj\u00f6tt Trygve Schj\u00f8tt Arne Sejersted |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|No further competitors |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|No further competitors |} ==References== Category:Keelboats Category:Olympic sailing classes Category:Development sailing classes ",
