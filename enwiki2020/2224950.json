    "text": "The Labbu Myth, \u201cThe Slaying of Labbu\u201d, or possibly Kalbu Myth, depending on the reading of the first character in the antagonist's name, which is always written as KAL may be read as Lab, Kal, Rib and Tan, is an ancient Mesopotamian creation epic with its origin no later than the Old Babylonian period. It is a folktale possibly of the Diyala region as the later version seems to feature the god Ti\u0161pak as its protagonist and may be an allegory representing his replacement of the chthonic serpent-god Ninazu at the top of the pantheon of the city of E\u0161nunna. This part is played by Nergal in the earlier version. It was possibly a precursor of the En\u00fbma Eli\u0161, where Labbu, meaning \"Raging One\" or \"lion\", was the prototype of Tiamat and of the Canaanite tale of Baal fighting Yamm. ==Synopsis== Extant in two very fragmentary copies, an Old Babylonian and a later Assyrian one from the Library of Ashurbanipal, which have no complete surviving lines, the Labbu Myth relates the tale of a possibly leonine certainly serpentine monster, a fifty-leagueCAD b p. 208b b\u0113ru A. long mu\u0161ba-a\u0161-ma: Ba\u0161mu or sixty-league long MU\u0160-\u1e2aU\u0160:Mu\u0161\u1e2bu\u0161\u0161u, depending on the version and reconstruction of the text. The opening of the Old Babylonian version recalls that of Gilgamesh: > The cities sigh, the people... > The people decreased in number,... > For their lamentation there was none to... The vast dimensions of Labbu are described. The sea, t\u0101mtuCompare the cognate Tiamat. has given birth to the dragon (line 6). The fragmentary line \"He raises his tail...\" identified him for Neil Forsyth as a precursor of a later Adversary, the dragon of Revelation 12:4, whose tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. In the later version, Labbu is created by the god Enlil who \u201cdrew [a picture of] the dragon in the sky\", to wipe out humanity whose raucous noise has been disturbing this deity's sleep, a recurring motif in Babylonian creation epics. Whether this refers to the Milky Way (Heidel 1963) or a comet (Forsyth 1989) is not clear. The pantheon of Babylonian gods are terrified by this apparition and appeal to the moon god S\u00een or fertility goddess Aruru who conscripts Ti\u0161pak/Nergal to counter this threat and \u201cexercise kingship\u201d, presumably over E\u0161nunna, as its reward. Ti\u0161pak/Nergal raises objections to tangling with the serpent but, after a gap in the narrative, a god whose name is abraded provides guidance on military strategy. A storm erupts and the victor, who may or may not be Ti\u0161pak or Nergal, in accordance with the advice given, fires an arrow to slay the beast. The epic fragments are not part of a cosmogony, Forsyth notes, as the cities of men already exist. F.A.M. Wiggerman found the myth's function as justifying Tishpak's accession as king, \"as a consequence of his 'liberation' of the nation, sanctioned by the decision of a divine council.\" ===Principal publications=== * plates 34-35 of tablet Rm 282 (line art) * plate 6 of tablet VAT 9443 (line art) * (translation) * (translation) * (translation) * (translation) * (transliteration and translation) * (translation) ==References== Category:Akkadian literature Category:Mesopotamian legendary creatures Category:Mythic aquatic creatures Category:Dragons ",
