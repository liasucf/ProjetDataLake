    "text": "The Helm Identification Guides are a series of books that identify groups of birds. The series include two types of guides, those that are: * Taxonomic, dealing with a particular family of birds on a worldwide scale--most early Helm Guides were this type, as well as many more-recent ones, although some later books deal with identification of such groups on a regional scale only (e.g., The Gulls Guide, which covers only species in Europe, Asia, and North America) * Geographic, including all bird species in an area (e.g., The Birds of the West Indies) Early volumes were sometimes published under the Croom Helm or Christopher Helm imprints. In addition, a parallel set of guides, very similar in design, was published by Pica Press in the 1990s (marked Pica in the list below); Pica was later absorbed into A & C Black (now part of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc), and all guides are now marketed as a single series. Several of the books have won the British Birds Bird Book of the Year award. A list of titles in the series, in chronological order of publication, is as follows: ==Works with a taxonomic scope== Note: 'nW' indicates those that do not have worldwide coverage. ===1980s=== * Seabirds - an identification guide by Peter Harrison (1983) * Shorebirds - an identification guide to the waders of the world by John Marchant, A.
