    "text": "The Battle of Hundsfeld or Battle of Psie Pole was said to be fought on 24 August 1109 near the Silesian capital Wroc\u0142aw between the Holy Roman Empire in aid of the claims of the exiled Piast duke Zbigniew against his ruling half- brother, Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth of Poland. It was recorded by the medieval Polish chronicler Bishop Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek of Krak\u00f3w in his Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae several decades later. ==History== The contemporary author Gallus Anonymus in his Gesta principum Polonorum, written between 1112 and 1118, mentioned several armed encounters with the Imperial forces led by King Henry V of Germany. After Boles\u0142aw III had invaded the Bohemian territory of Duke Svatopluk, the German king in turn started a campaign in Poland and laid siege to the towns of Bytom Odrza\u0144ski and G\u0142og\u00f3w, before he moved further down the Oder River and marched against Wroc\u0142aw, though to no avail, after being defeated at the Battle of Hundsfeld by Boles\u0142aw's forces. Kronika ksi\u0119ga III rozdzia\u0142 15. W oryginale: 15. Caesar rediens, ac pro tributo cadavera portans. Hiis auditis Caesar urbem Wratislaviensem adivit, ubi nichil nisi de vivis mortuos acquisivit. ==Debate== According to Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek, the Germans were ambushed by the Polish forces and the result was a complete victory of Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth, whereafter King Henry withdrew from Poland. After the encounter, due to the many dead and dying left on the battlefield; Kad\u0142ubek remarked, that the \"...dogs which, devouring so many corpses, fell into a mad ferocity, so that no one dared venture there.\" Hence, the site became known as \"dogs' field\" (, ). Kad\u0142ubek's relation was questioned in the late 19th century Encyklopedia Powszechna by Samuel Orgelbrand. Present-day historians are split on the issue, with some arguing that the battle was rather an unimportant skirmish, and the Chronica, written at the court of Boles\u0142aw's son Casimir II the Just almost hundred years after the event, is not fully reliable. Though, regardless of the magnitude, the clash contributed to Henry V's retreat.\"S. Orgelbranda Encyklopedia Powszechna\", Warsaw 1902, vol. XII, page 406M. Kaczmarek, \"Bitwa na Psim Polu\", in: Encyklopedia Wroc\u0142awia, Wroc\u0142aw 2000 ==Tradition== The site is now part of the Psie Pole district of modern Wroc\u0142aw. The name was also given by General Stanislaw Maczek during WWII to an area where a mile-long column of German panzers was destroyed at Hill 262, during the Battle of Falaise in Normandy. ==See also== *History of Poland during the Piast dynasty ==References== Category:1109 in Europe Hundsfeld Hundsfeld Category:History of Wroc\u0142aw Category:History of Silesia Category:Conflicts in 1109 ",
