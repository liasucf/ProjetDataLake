    "text": "Monkwearmouth Railway Station is former station that served Monkwearmouth, Sunderland, England, from 1848 to 1967. It was built in 1848 to a design by Thomas Moore.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/historic-english- railways-200-years-of-history/monkwearmouth-station/ and was once the main railway station in the city.http://seeitdoitsunderland.co.uk/monkwearmouth- station-museum The railway station closed in March 1967 and featured a restored booking office dating from the Edwardian period. The station was opened as a museum in 1973.https://www.railwaymagazine.co.uk/monkwearmouth- station-museum-closes-its-doors/ The Tyne and Wear Metro and mainline trains still pass through the station without stopping, but the Metro calls at St. Peter's station a few hundred yards south of the old station, due to the platforms at Monkwearmouth being too narrow to serve as a Metro station. The former station is a Grade II* listed building. As well as the ticket office, visitors could explore the Wagon Shed, Journeys Gallery and Children's Gallery.http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=8231 The museum was temporarily closed from August 2005 until 2007 to allow repairs and refurbishment to take place.http://blog.twmuseums.org.uk/monkwearmouth- station-museum-railway-wagon-restoration-project-%E2%80%93-the-story-of-the- sidings/ The museum was closed on 23 May 2017 because the roof, footbridge and platforms were claimed to be in a very poor condition, despite a major two- year refurbishment programme in 2005\u201307. The station has since reopened as a museum dedicated to football.https://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/sunderland- fans-museum-exhibition-gets-keys-to-new-home-at-former-city-train- station-354159 ==References== ==External links== *Monkwearmouth Station Museum - official site.
