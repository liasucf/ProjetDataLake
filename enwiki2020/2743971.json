    "text": "Mamady Ke\u00efta (surname sometimes also spelled Keita; born August 1950 in Balandougou, Siguiri Prefecture, Kankan Region, Guinea) is a master drummer from the West African nation of Guinea. He specializes in the goblet-shaped hand drum called djembe. He is also the founder of the Tam Tam Mandingue school of drumming. He is a member of the Manding ethnic group. Mamady Keita is a direct descendant of the great king Sundiata Keita who United the Mali Empire. ==Early life== Ke\u00efta was born in the small village of Balandougou, Guinea, in the northeastern prefecture of Siguiri, near the border of Mali. By age 5 Mamady Keita had developed his own technique of tone, slap, bass and learned the rhythms of his village and was playing Djembe in all of the ceremonies, celebrations and festivals. Technically, his actual initiation to the djembe started at the early age of seven, under Karinkadjan Kond\u00e9, elder master djembefola of Balandugu, who initiated him to the secrets of the djembe. Ke\u00efta was educated in the traditions of his village, learning the history and music of the Malinke people. At the age of twelve, he became a member of the first regional federal ballet of Siguiri after Balanka Sidiki, a recruiter for the group, came to Balandugu looking for performers. ==Career== At the time, Guinea was governed by S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, who put special emphasis on Guinean culture through live performances and a system of local, regional, and national competitions that recruited the greatest artists of the land. During the National Festival in 1964, Ke\u00efta, then aged fourteen, along with fifty other percussionists and numerous other artists, was selected by Guinea's Minister of Culture to form Le Ballet National Djoliba (The Djoliba National Ballet), which was intended to serve as a showcase for Tour\u00e9's revolution in Guinea. After nine months of training, he was one of only five percussionists retained. He was appointed lead soloist of Ballet Djoliba in 1965 and, in 1979, became its artistic director. He stayed with Ballet Djoliba until 1986, when he joined Ballet Koteba in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. In 1988, Ke\u00efta moved to Belgium where he worked as a performer and teacher. In 1991, he opened his first school Tam Tam Mandingue percussion school in Brussels, to be followed by additional schools in Europe, North America, and Asia, each run by a school director personally certified by Ke\u00efta for his/her playing skill and teaching abilities. Since then, Ke\u00eeta has worked as a performer with his group Sewa Kan and recorded a number of CDs. He also teaches internationally, running international workshops in Europe, North America, and Asia, as well as an annual camp in Africa. He has published a large body of djembe teaching materials on CD and DVD, as well as an instructional book. He resides in Monterrey, Mexico. ==Discography== * 1989: Mamady Ke\u00efta & Sewa Kan, Wassolon, Fonti Musicali * 1992: Mamady Ke\u00efta, Nankama, Fonti Musicali, 1992 * 1995: Mamady Ke\u00efta, M\u00f6g\u00f6balu (double CD), Fonti Musicali * 1996: Mamady Ke\u00efta, Hamanah (with Famoudou Konat\u00e9), Fonti Musicali * 1998: Mamady Ke\u00efta & Sewa Kan, Af\u00f6, Fonti Musicali * 2000: Mamady Ke\u00efta, Balandugu Kan (double CD), Fonti Musicali * 2001: Mamady Ke\u00efta, Mamady L\u00e8\u00e8, Fonti Musicali * 2002: Mamady Ke\u00efta, Agiat\u00e8, Fonti Musicali * 2004: Mamady Ke\u00efta, Djembe Master (compilation of tracks from previous albums), Nocturne (rough trade) * 2004: Mamady Ke\u00efta, Sila Laka, Fonti Musicali * 2005: Mamady Ke\u00efta & Sewa Kan, Live @ Couleur Cafe, Fenix Music & ZigZag World * 2007: Mamady Ke\u00efta, Mandeng Djara, Fonti Musicali * 2010: Mamady Ke\u00efta & Sewa Kan, Hakili (DVD & CD package), ZigZag World & CristalRecords ==Films== * 1967: Africa Dance (with Harry Belafonte). * 1987: La Vie Platinee.
