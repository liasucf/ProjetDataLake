The Gangula language region includes the towns of Clermont and Springsure extending south towards the Dawson River. Wadja (also known as Wadjigu, Wadya, Wadjainngo, Mandalgu, and Wadjigun) is an Australian Aboriginal language in Central Queensland. The language region includes the local government areas of the Aboriginal Shire of Woorabinda and Central Highlands Region, including the Blackdown Tablelands. the Comet River, and the Expedition Range, and the towns of Woorabinda, Springsure and Rolleston. The town takes its name from a pastoral run name used from 1861, so named because of a permanent spring on the run. The area was originally occupied by Aboriginal people, for thousands of years. Ludwig Leichhardt was the first European to explore the area between 1843 and 1845. His favourable reports encouraged settlers to move in and settle the land whose domains were those of Aboriginal groups. In 1861 squatter Horatio Wills and a party of Victorian settlers arrived near modern- day Springsure in 1861. Two weeks later, 19 men women and children, including Wills, were killed by Aboriginal Australian people, the Kairi or Gayiri, in the Cullin-La-Ringo massacre, the largest massacre of European settlers by Aborigines in Australian history. At least 15 Aboriginal men, women and children were killedT. Bottoms (2013) Conspiracy of Silence: Queensland's frontier killing times, Allen & Unwin, pp.53-54 by the Queensland Native Police and militias of local European colonists and their employees, in a series of reprisals over the months that followed. However, the massacre of the 19 European family members was itself a retaliatory response to an earlier shooting of fugitive murderer who was Gayiri tribesman by Jesse Gregson (manager of nearby Rainsworth Station) with Second Lieutenant Alfred March Patrick and Native Police Troops in his command.T Bottoms (2013) Conspiracy of Silence: Queensland's frontier killing times, Allen & Unwin, p.54 Prior to the massacre of the 19 colonists, Second Lieutenant Patrick had complained, in early 1861, to Charles Dutton (lessee of Bauhinia Downs pastoral lease 148 km south-east of Springsure) that other officers in the Queensland Native Police \"...had been able to bag their first Aborigine after only a few weeks in the Force; he had served for six months and still had not yet killed a black.\"G. Reid, \"From Hornet Bank to Cullin-La-Ringo\", Royal Historical Society of Queensland, 18 May 1981, p.69 The Old Rainworth Fort was built in 1862 by the colonists of Springsure in order to defend themselves from future raids by Aboriginals. Horatio's son, star cricketer and Australian rules football pioneer Tom Wills, survived the massacre, and remained on site until 1864. The town was surveyed by Charles Frederick Gregory in August 1863. Presbyterian Church, Springsure, 2006 The Springsure Presbyterian Church in Charles Street opened about 1866.
