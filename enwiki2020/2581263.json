The next time WWE came to Australia was for the WWE Global Warning Tour in 2002 for what was the first WWE event in Australia in 16 years. WWE has visited Australia regularly since then by touring at least once a year since 2003. WWE's NXT brand made its first tour in 2016. In 2018, WWE announced WWE Super Show-Down at the Melbourne Cricket Ground \u2013 the first ever WWE pay-per-view (PPV) to be held in Australia. ==WWE Global Warning Tour: Melbourne== WWE Global Warning Tour: Melbourne was a professional wrestling event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment that took place on August 10, 2002, at Colonial Stadium in Melbourne, Australia. This event marked the return of WWE to Australia for the first time since 1986. Michael Cole and Tazz recorded the commentary from WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. The event featured nine matches (including 3 dark matches), where in the main event The Rock defeated Triple H and Brock Lesnar in a Triple Threat match to retain the WWE Undisputed Championship. Global Warning did not air on pay-per-view (PPV), but was released on home video. The event aired in November 2002 as part of the WWE Fanatic Series and in January 2003 on Sky 1 in New Zealand. In October 2018, Global Warning was added to the on demand list on the WWE Network. It was re- released on DVD in December 2018, as part of a double pack with WWE Super Show-Down. {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\" |+Other on-screen personnel |- !Role: !Name: |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Commentator |Michael Cole |- |Tazz |- |Ring Announcer |Tony Chimel |- |General Manager |Stephanie McMahon |- |} ==WWE Super Show-Down== WWE Super Show-Down was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event and WWE Network event, produced by WWE for their Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brands.
