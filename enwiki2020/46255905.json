    "text": "In computational group theory, a black box group (black-box group) is a group G whose elements are encoded by bit strings of length N, and group operations are performed by an oracle (the \"black box\"). These operations include: \u2022 taking a product g\u00b7h of elements g and h, \u2022 taking an inverse g\u22121 of element g, \u2022 deciding whether g = 1\\. This class is defined to include both the permutation groups and the matrix groups. The upper bound on the order of G given by |G| \u2264 2N shows that G is finite. == Applications == The black box groups were introduced by Babai and Szemer\u00e9di in 1984. They were used as a formalism for (constructive) group recognition and property testing. Notable algorithms include the Babai's algorithm for finding random group elements,L. Babai, Local expansion of vertex-transitive graphs and random generation in finite groups, Proc. 23rd STOC (1991), 164\u2013174. the Product Replacement Algorithm, and testing group commutativity. Many early algorithms in CGT, such as the Schreier\u2013Sims algorithm, require a permutation representation of a group and thus are not black box. Many other algorithms require finding element orders. Since there are efficient ways of finding the order of an element in a permutation group or in a matrix group (a method for the latter is described by Celler and Leedham-Green in 1997), a common recourse is to assume that the black box group is equipped with a further oracle for determining element orders.See H\u043elt et al.
