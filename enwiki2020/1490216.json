Gollnisch's declarations, with their implication of holocaust denial, provoked a scandal, especially in the run-up to the ceremonies commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz extermination camp. The chancellor of the university asked the Minister of National Education to suspend Professor Gollnisch, and announced the opening of a disciplinary procedure against him. On 26 December, the chancellor suspended Professor Gollnisch's classes for 30 days. Furthermore, on 2 December, the chancellor excluded him from the university, alleging a possible breach of the peace; however, this decision was overturned by the Conseil d'\u00c9tat on 14 January 2005. On 2 February, Gollnisch started teaching again at Lyon III. Students were prevented from entering his lecture room by groups of students from left- wing and Jewish associations. A group of National Front students enabled his students to enter and blocked the protesters. A brawl ensued; police officers arrived on the scene and a National Front student was arrested. Other trouble ensued. On 7 November 2006, at the opening of the trial, Gollnisch was asked whether \"the organised extermination of European Jews by the Nazi regime (...) constitutes an undeniable crime against humanity, and that it was carried out notably by using gas chambers in extermination camps\". He replied \"absolutely\".Bruno Gollnisch a reconnu l'existence des chambres \u00e0 gaz \u00e0 l'ouverture de son proc\u00e8s, Le Monde, 8 November 2006 Gollnisch was finally found not guilty by the Cour de cassation on 24 June 2009.Gollnisch blanchi par la Cour de cassation, Le Nouvel Observateur, 24 June 2009 On 23 October 2012, Gollnisch visited Hungary to deliver a speech in honour of Jobbik, a party described as \"anti-Semitic\" by the New York Times and as \"extremist\" by Marine Le Pen.\"Viktor Orban Wins a Second Term in Hungary\", \"The New York Times\", 7 April 2014.
