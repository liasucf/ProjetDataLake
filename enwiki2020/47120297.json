It is organised by the game's governing body in the country, the Samoa International Cricket Association (SICA). Although women's cricket has a long history in Samoa, the national team was only formally organised in 2010, with assistance from a New Zealand association, Auckland Cricket.(15 March 2012). \"Samoan women preparing for big challenge\" \u2013 Auckland Cricket.

The team has often included Samoan expatriate players based in Australia and New Zealand (including some who have played for state or provincial teams), which has presented difficulties in training.(23 April 2014). \"Samoa target top two finish in Japan\" \u2013 ICC East Asia-Pacific.

Samoa's first regional tournament came later in 2010, and it has since regularly participated in ICC East Asia-Pacific events, generally ranking behind only Japan and Papua New Guinea in the region. Its most notable achievement is winning the gold medal in the women's tournament at the 2015 Pacific Games. The team is currently coached by Ian West, an Englishman who gained Samoan citizenship through his wife, and subsequently played for the Samoan men's team.Lauren Priestley (30 January 2013). \"Developing Samoan cricket\" \u2013 East & Bays Courier.

Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Samoa women and another international side after 1 July 2018 will be a full WT20I. ==History== Cricket has been played in Samoa since the 19th century, when it was introduced by British traders and missionaries. It flourished despite a ban during the period of the German protectorate, from 1900 to 1914. Historically, the sport has been most popular when played under the modified rules known as kilikiti. However, since the early 2000s, when Samoa gained affiliate membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and its men's national team debuted internationally (in 2000 and 2001, respectively), the standard form of cricket has begun to replace kilikiti in popularity.Andy Bull (27 January 2010). \"Cricket in Samoa: It's just not kilikiti\" \u2013 The Guardian.
