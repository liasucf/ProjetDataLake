    "text": "\"Night Changes\" is a song recorded by English-Irish boy-band One Direction. It was written by the band alongside Jamie Scott, Julian Bunetta and John Ryan, while the production was handled by Bunetta and Ryan. The song was released on 14 November 2014 as the second and final single from their fourth studio album Four. It was also the group's last single to feature Zayn Malik, as he announced his departure from the group in March 2015. ==Background and release== \"Night Changes\" was revealed as the album's second single in an interview with radio host Scott Mills. The track was released on 14 November 2014, three days before the album's release. ==Composition and lyrics== Comparing the lyrical theme to the likes of \"Live While We're Young\" and \"Best Song Ever\", the song explains about seizing the time in life while gaining love along the way. The harmonies in the chorus, backed by rounds of \"Oohs\", give the song added depth and a big contemplative feel. Night changes is a song about losing your virginity, but it is also a song about how easily it is for your \u201cdate\u201d or life to go wrong and that there is no way to fix it . The song runs for 3 minutes and 47 seconds and begins in the key of A-flat major. However, 2 minutes and 28 seconds into the song, the key changes to B-flat major. ==Music video== The official music video was released on 21 November 2014 and directed by Ben Winston. This was the last video of One Direction with the member Zayn as he departed from the band on 25 March 2015. Liam Payne's real-life girlfriend Sophia Smith was involved in the shoot, but did not appear on-screen. The video is a point of view of going on a date with all members of One Direction. The five dates take place in five different locations: a date with Zayn at an Italian restaurant (which apparently he owns as he greets cooks in the back and introduces his date to a waiter), a drive in the country with Louis, a night in playing Monopoly and Jenga next to a fireplace with Niall, ice skating with Harry and at a carnival with Liam. As their date progresses, it goes from best to worst. Zayn's date's ex-boyfriend comes in and pours water and food on Zayn, which prompts her to leave Zayn as he looks on in disbelief. Next, Harry spots a couple doing a trick on the ice rink and attempts to do it with his date, but both wound up being injured. Liam and his date go on a ride in the carnival, but Liam becomes nauseated and throws up in his date's hat. Niall tends to his fireplace, but his sweater catches on fire and goes to grab a towel to put it out, only to tip over a jug that stains his date's dress. Lastly, Louis gets pulled over by the police and attempts to joke with the policeman, who becomes displeased and places Louis under arrest, and the date sees Louis in the back of the police car heading away from her. ==Track listing== *Digital EP #\"Night Changes\" \u2013 3:40 #\"Night Changes\" \u2013 3:40 #\"Steal My Girl\" \u2013 3:46 *CD single #\"Night Changes\" \u2013 3:40 #\"Night Changes\" \u2013 3:40 ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !
