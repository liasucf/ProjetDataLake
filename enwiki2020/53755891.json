On 17 May 2017, he announced that he would be stepping down as DPP when his term in office ends in September 2017. McGrory has denied that his resignation is related to escalating allegations of bias by senior UK politicians and others, who have accused his office of prioritising prosecutions of former British soldiers for their actions during the Troubles. He was quoted as saying he regretted the legacy issue had become part of the story of his tenure and wished the mechanisms were in place to deal with the past and investigations into Troubles cases. ==Personal life== McGrory is a Roman Catholic.
