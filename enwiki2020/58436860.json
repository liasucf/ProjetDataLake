From the 1970s until the 2000s, he was a well-known entertainment figure with his programs in Turkey's television. == Life and career == Dursuno\u011flu was born in 1932 in Trabzon. After finishing his education at Haydarpa\u015fa High School, he studied philology but left the university to work as a civil servant at the Social Insurance Institution. After working for 18 years as a public officer in the SSK, he left his job and started to perform under the name Huysuz Virjin in 1970. He started his career at small clubs, but as his reputation spread out, he started to get offers from bigger clubs. Every year at the Izmir International Fair, he shared the stage with renowned soloists in Turkey. With thousands of people coming to Izmir International Fair, he did not initially appear on television but managed to gain fame in Turkey. Dursuno\u011flu made his biggest debut with the character of \"Huysuz Virjin\" by participating in the contest program of \u00d6zt\u00fcrk Serengil on TRT. His humorous responses as Huysuz Virjin to \u00d6zt\u00fcrk Serengil's on the program made him a much discussed figure in the public. With the character of Huysuz Virjin, Dursuno\u011flu became able to express his opinions more freely. He started to state facts in a humorous way. In the 1970s, he released a new record titled Huysuz Virjin 1. In 2007, Radio and Television Supreme Council (RT\u00dcK) announced that his program could no longer be broadcast on television channels and that he would no longer revive the character of Huysuz Virjin but he presented the dance program Huysuz'la Dans Eder misin? on Show TV in 2012. In the same year, he joined Benzemez Kimse Sana as a judge which aired on Star TV. On the program's final episode, he appeared as Huysuz Virjin and said \"This is my last kanto\", implying that he could not sing kanto again due to his age.
