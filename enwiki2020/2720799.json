    "text": "Lactobacillus casei is a species of genus Lactobacillus. This particular species of Lactobacillus is documented to have a wide pH and temperature range, and complements the growth of L. acidophilus, a producer of the enzyme amylase (a carbohydrate-digesting enzyme). ==Uses== ===Dairy=== The most common application of L. casei is industrial, specifically for dairy production. Lactobacillus casei is typically the dominant species of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (i.e. contaminant bacteria) present in ripening cheddar cheese, and, recently, the complete genome sequence of L. casei ATCC 334 has become available. L. casei is also the dominant species in naturally fermented Sicilian green olives. ===Medical=== A commercial beverage containing L. casei strain Shirota has been shown to inhibit the in vivo growth of Helicobacter pylori, but when the same beverage was consumed by humans in a small trial, H. pylori colonization decreased only slightly, and the trend was not statistically significant. Some L. casei strains are considered to be probiotic, and may be effective in alleviation of gastrointestinal pathogenic bacterial diseases. According to World Health Organization, those properties have to be demonstrated on each specific strain\u2014including human clinical studies\u2014to be valid. L. casei has been combined with other probiotic strains of bacteria in randomized trials studying its effects in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), and patients in the trials who were not given the placebo had significantly lower rates of AAD or CDI (depending on the trial) with no adverse effects reported. Additionally, trials have shown significantly shorter recovery times in children suffering from acute diarrhea (primarily caused by rotavirus) when given different L. casei treatments when compared to placebo. Studies suggest that Lactobacillus is a safe and effective treatment for acute and infectious diarrhea. In the preparation of food, L. casei bacteria can be used in the natural fermentation of beans to lower levels of the compounds causing flatulence upon digestion. ===Commercial probiotic=== Among the best-documented, probiotic L.casei, L. casei DN-114001, and L. casei Shirota have been extensively studied and are widely available as functional foods (see Actimel, Yakult). Another commercially available form of L. casei can be found in Danactive made by Dannon. They registered trademarked L. casei as L. casei Immunita. ===Others=== In the past few years, many studies have been conducted in the decolorization of azo dyes by lactic acid bacteria such as L. casei TISTR 1500, L. paracasei, Oenococcus oeni, etc. With the azoreductase activity, mono- and diazo bonds are degraded completely, and generate other aromatic compounds as intermediates. == See also == * Prebiotic (nutrition) * Lactic acid bacteria == References == ==External links== *Type strain of Lactobacillus casei at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Bacteriology Category:Digestive system Category:Probiotics Category:Gut flora bacteria Category:Cattle Category:Dairy farming Category:Lactobacillaceae Category:Alternative medicine Category:Bacteria used in dairy products Category:Bacteria described in 1916 Category:Gram-positive bacteria ",
