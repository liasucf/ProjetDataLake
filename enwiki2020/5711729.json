    "text": "Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez is the self-titled solo debut of former lead singer and songwriter of the Chilean band Los Prisioneros, recorded in 1992 and released in early 1993. It was produced by Gustavo Santaolalla with Anibal Kerpel's collaboration. The 14 tracks featured in this album were written and composed by Gonz\u00e1lez. Due to the enormous success that the band had with Corazones, Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez decided to follow that same musical line on his awaited solo debut. EMI-Odeon, who wanted this release to be a completely exportable product, launched a huge promotion campaign with the purpose of transforming it in Latin America's most important album of 1993. The first single, Esta Es Para Hacerte Feliz, featured a totally positive and spiritual Gonz\u00e1lez, feelings that he put throughout the album. The song, as well as its corresponding video-clip, were very successful in Chile and Latin America. In the same way, Mi Casa En El Arbol and Fe enjoyed some success too. Despite that sales of the album were not bad at all, they didn't fill the expectations of EMI-Odeon and Gonz\u00e1lez. The following year, Gonz\u00e1lez recorded El Futuro Se Fue, completely far from the glamour that prevailed on their debut. That album would be the last that he made on EMI-Odeon. In the US, Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez was released by Capitol Records. ==Track listing== *All tracks written by Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez. #\"Esta Es Para Hacerte Feliz\" \u2013 4:29 #\"Men\" \u2013 4:47 #\"Pastilla\" \u2013 4:33 #\"Velocidad\" \u2013 3:52 #\"Mi Casa En El Arbol\" \u2013 4:19 #\"Fly\" \u2013 4:25 #\"Voluntad\" \u2013 3:04 #\"Fe\" \u2013 4:26 #\"Guitarras Viajeras\" \u2013 3:22 #\"Piedad\" \u2013 4:31 #\"Rain\" \u2013 4:10 #\"M\u00e1s Palabras\" \u2013 5:50 #\"Mother\" \u2013 3:53 #\"Esas Ma\u00f1anas\" (Hidden track) \u2013 2:58 ==See also== *Los Prisioneros Category:1993 albums Category:Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez (musician) albums Category:Albums produced by Gustavo Santaolalla ",
