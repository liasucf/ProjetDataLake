From 1973 and until her retirement in 2000 she was a professor in experimental physics at the University of Bremen. Much of her research concerned the areas of radiation contamination and the effect of low level radiation exposure, as well as the diagnostic use of nuclear radiation.Prof. Dr. rer. nat.

She wrote of her scientific findings in comprehensible language, so that they can be understood by colleagues from related disciplines and interested laypeople.Dr. Inge Schmitz-Feuerhake Recently, she put forward arguments against the use of mammography as breast cancer screening. Her analysis showed that precisely those women who inherited a higher risk of developing breast cancer were put at undue risk due to the radiation absorbed during the screening. Her work was praised by the medical associations of several German states. Schmitz- Feuerhake became known in Germany for examining the rise of the number of children suffering leukemia in the surroundings of the Kr\u00fcmmel Nuclear Power Plant. In 1980 she examined dust in the attics of private houses in Elbmarsch and found an amount of plutonium that was not explainable by the Chernobyl disaster nor by nuclear weapons testing in the 1960s. According to her, she could prove that the found plutonium and nuclear fission products had their origin in the nuclear reactor of Kr\u00fcmmel. She became known as \u201cthe most well- known and likely most relentless anti-nuclear activist\u201d against the cancer cluster Elbmarsch.Die prominenteste und wohl auch hartn\u00e4ckigste Anti- Atomkraft-Aktivistin ist die Physikerin Inge Schmitz-Feuerhake.

In 2003 Schmitz-Feuerhake received the Nuclear-Free Future Award for her lifetime achievement. She is also chairman of the European Committee on Radiation Risk, a group of scientists opposing nuclear power; she was elected chairman in 2003. Schmitze-Feuerhake is vice president of Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Strahlenschutz e.V.
