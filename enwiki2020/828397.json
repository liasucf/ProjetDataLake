The commune (Gmina) of Opat\u00f3wek, including the town of Opat\u00f3wek and 26 other villages, has about 10,000 inhabitants and is an agricultural and industrial region. (See also Commune Opat\u00f3wek.) == Landscape == The commune is situated in a picturesque landscape of the Opat\u00f3wek-Malan\u00f3w Hills. The hills of Che\u0142mce (187 m), Rajsko (177.2 m) and T\u0142okinia Ko\u015bcielna (164.7 m) dominate the valleys of rivers Pokrzywnica, Cienia and Sw\u0119drnia. The neighbour comunes of the commune Opat\u00f3wek are: \u017belazk\u00f3w, Cek\u00f3w-Kolonia and Ko\u017aminek in the north, Szczytniki in the east, Godziesze Wielkie in the south and the city of Kalisz in the west. The architecture of Opat\u00f3wek is dominated by the Neo-Gothic and classicistic style of the 19th century the most successful time of the town during the booming years of industrialism. The region of Opat\u00f3wek is mostly notable for its fruitful, agricultural landscape and several rivers and lakes. == History of Opat\u00f3wek == ===Early settlements=== After early Celtic settlements the region was settled between 400 BC and 300 AD by Lugii. Kalisz was an important station of the Amber Road called Calisia. ===Medieval and modern times=== Opat\u00f3wek belonged to archbishops of Gniezno since the 13th century, who probably helped it to obtain municipal rights. The archbishop Jaros\u0142aw of Bogoria and Skotnik built a brick church and a castle here in about 1360, which were visited by outstanding clergymen and civil dignitaries. Both buildings stood until the beginning of the 19th century. From 1655 until 1660 the area was occupied by Sweden. In 1706 was the great battle close to Kalisz between Saxon and Swedish armies that involved 50000 soldiers all together. The Saxon army helped by the Russian army defeated Swedish army and Polish soldiers led by Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski. In 1793 the archbishops' property was confiscated by the Prussian authorities; since 1807 it belonged to general J\u00f3zef Zaj\u0105czek, the future governor of the Kingdom of Poland. In that time many buildings designed by the most outstanding architects were constructed; moreover, the governor carried out reforms in his property which enabled the economical development in this area. Also Napoleon's Grande Arm\u00e9e passed the Kalisz County at the French invasion of Russia (1812). After the Vienna Congress 1815 Poland came under Russian government as Congress Poland until World War I. ===Industrial Revolution and the 19th century=== 180px Beginning of the 19th century the industrial revolution did not stop at Poland. Several German industrialist's started running branches cross border. Cities on both sides of the border started booming. With the foundation of the big weaving mill by Adolf Gottlieb Fiedler, a Saxon industrialist, Opat\u00f3wek started booming. Fiedler established one of the biggest weaving mills in the Kingdom of Poland in 1824-26. The government of Polish Kingdom created very good conditions for the development of industry. Adolf Gottlieb Fiedler received a big loan from the Polish government to build the factory in Opatowek. Also in spite of lower salaries he followed other cloth producers to eastern regions at the time of the German industrial revolution. The German investments in Poland were followed by Saxon and bohemian specialists to run the factories. There they found cheap workers, water power and they brought in their knowhow. The factory of Opat\u00f3wek employed 600 workers and the company won several international prizes with their products. The Opat\u00f3wek factory was the cash cow of Fiedler's company. The town grew with great speed. In 1870, Opat\u00f3wek lost its municipal rights as a result of the suppression after the January Uprising and because of the economical decay. In the end of the 19th century a Wooden Toys Factory was established in Opatowek, whose products won numerous prizes at European expositions. The profit-making, well organised property yielded a big profit to the next owners. ===The 20th century=== 180px At the end of 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, Opat\u00f3wek was, like most cities of Greater Poland, touched by independence movements against Prussia and Russia. This Greater Poland Uprising led after World War I to the Second Polish Republic. After the invasion of Poland the responsibility of Kalisz and Kalisz County moved to Litzmannsdorf (\u0141\u00f3d\u017a). There have been several resistance movements, most of them were detected by the Gestapo. After World War II there have been several regional changes. During the Gomu\u0142ka government (1956\u20131970) the economy of the whole region stood still, not only because of the iron curtain. The following government, that of Edward Gierek, brought fresh wind into the region and economy grew again. Since 1990 the Third Polish Republic was founded. All Polish provinces were restructured again and Opat\u00f3wek became part of Kalisz County in the restructured province Greater Poland. ===Today=== Nowadays there are about 800 private firms in the commune of Opat\u00f3wek. They deal with production, trade or services. The Bank Sp\u00f3\u0142dzielczy Ziemi Kaliskiej and a branch of the PKO Bank deal with financial service of the inhabitants, institutions and firms. In 1998 the Garden and Agriculture Fair \"Pami\u0119tajcie o ogrodach\" took place in Opat\u00f3wek for the first time. The local gardeners and fruit-growers, as well as exhibitors from all over the country and abroad participate in it every year. In 2001 the seventh Country-wide Youth Games for Summer Sports \"Wielkopolska 2001\" was inaugurated at the artificial lake in Sza\u0142e. The commune Opat\u00f3wek was the host of the rowing and mountain cycling competition. The following Games for Water sports took place in summer 2004. The lake can be visited on board of the tourist ship Opat\u00f3wek. The commune is represented every year by the football team \"Sparta\" at the regional competition. In 2006 a modern sports hall has been built where the national and international volleyball matches were held. Since 1 January 2017 Opat\u00f3wek gain back their municipal rights. == Cultural offerings == === Museum === 180px The Museum of the History of Industry features a collection showing the development of industry in the Kalisz region since the beginning of the 19th century.
