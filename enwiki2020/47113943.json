The second Amsterdam Floriade was recognised by the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) and held from April 8 to October 10, 1982. It was the 9th edition of the international horticultural exposition organised under the auspices of the Association of International Horticultural Producers (AIPH) and the third held in the Netherlands. Floriade 1982 was held at a recreation area surrounding the Gaasperplas lake in the neighborhood of Gaasperdam. The entrance to the Floriade was near the previously constructed Gaasperplas metro station. View from the observation tower What remained after the Floriade, after some of the structures were removed, became the Gaasperpark. The planetarium today houses a conference and meeting center. The interior furnishings of the planetarium were moved in 1988 to the Artis Planetarium. The 76m observation tower was an attraction on the Floriade 1982. It was previously used for the bi-annual Kassel Bundesgartenschau in Germany in 1981 and before that the M\u00fcnchenstein '. In 1983 the attraction returned to Germany and opened in Europa-Park, where it is still operational. ==References== ==External links== * Official website of the BIE Category:1980s in Amsterdam Category:International Horticultural Exhibitions Category:1982 in the Netherlands Category:Events in Amsterdam Category:Festivals in the Netherlands Category:Garden festivals in the Netherlands Category:1982 festivals Category:Floriade (Netherlands) Category:1982 festivals in Europe ",
