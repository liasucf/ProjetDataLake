It is a setting of 21 selected poems from Albert Giraud's cycle of the same name as translated into German by Otto Erich Hartleben. The work is written for reciter (voice-type unspecified in the score, but traditionally performed by a soprano) who delivers the poems in the sprechstimme style accompanied by a small instrumental ensemble. Schoenberg had previously used a combination of spoken text with instrumental accompaniment, called \"melodrama\", in the summer-wind narrative of the Gurre- Lieder,Neighbour 2001. which was a fashionable musical style popular at the end of the nineteenth century.Dunsby 1992, 2. Though the music is atonal, it does not employ Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique, which he did not use until 1921. Pierrot lunaire is among Schoenberg's most celebrated and frequently performed works. Its instrumentation \u2013 flute, clarinet, violin, cello, and piano with standard doublings and in this case with the addition of a vocalist \u2013 is an important ensemble in 20th- and 21st-century classical music and is referred to as a Pierrot ensemble. The piece was premiered at the Berlin Choralion-Saal on October 16, 1912, with Albertine Zehme as the vocalist. A typical performance lasts about 35 to 40 minutes. == History == The ensemble that premiered Pierrot lunaire.The work originated in a commission by Albertine Zehme, a former actress, for a cycle for voice and piano, setting a series of poems by the Belgian writer Albert Giraud. The verses had been first published in 1884 and later translated into German by Otto Erich Hartleben. Zehme had previously performed a 'melodrama' by composer Otto Vrieslander based on the translated poems. But, according to Eduard Steuermann, student of Schoenberg and pianist of the premiere, \"the music was not strong enough, and someone advised her to approach Schoenberg.\"Dunsby 1992, 22. Schoenberg began work on March 12 and completed the piece on July 9, 1912, having expanded the forces to an ensemble consisting of flute (doubling on piccolo), clarinet in A (doubling on bass clarinet and clarinet in B), violin (doubling on viola), cello, and piano. After forty rehearsals, Schoenberg and Zehme (in Columbine dress) gave the premiere at the Berlin Choralion-Saal on October 16, 1912. Reaction was mixed. According to Anton Webern, some in the audience were whistling and laughing, but in the end \"it was an unqualified success\".Quoted in Winiarz. There was some criticism of blasphemy in the texts, to which Schoenberg responded, \"If they were musical, not a single one would give a damn about the words. Instead, they would go away whistling the tunes\".Quoted in Hazlewood. ==Structure== Pierrot lunaire consists of three groups of seven poems. In the first group, Pierrot sings of love, sex and religion; in the second, of violence, crime, and blasphemy; and in the third of his return home to Bergamo, with his past haunting him. {| width=\"100%\" |- valign=\"top\" | width=\"33%\" | : Part One # Mondestrunken (Drunk with Moonlight) # Colombine (Columbine) # Der Dandy (The Dandy) # Eine blasse W\u00e4scherin (A Pallid Washerwoman) # Valse de Chopin # Madonna # Der kranke Mond (The Sick Moon) | width=\"33%\" | : Part Two # * Nacht (Passacaglia) (Night) # Gebet an Pierrot (Prayer to Pierrot) # Raub (Theft) # Rote Messe (Red Mass) # Galgenlied (Gallows Song) # Enthauptung (Beheading) # Die Kreuze (The Crosses) | width=\"33%\" | : Part Three # * Heimweh (Homesickness) # Gemeinheit!

The piece is his opus 21, contains 21 poems, and was begun on March 12, 1912. Other key numbers in the work are 3 and 13: each poem consists of 13 lines (two four-line verses followed by a five-line verse), while the first line of each poem occurs three times (being repeated as lines 7 and 13). == Music and text == Though written in a freely atonal style, Pierrot lunaire uses a variety of classical forms and techniques, including canon, fugue, rondo, passacaglia, and free counterpoint. The instrumental combinations (including doublings) vary between most movements. The entire ensemble is used only in Nos. 6, 11, 14, 15 (end), 16, 18, 19 (end), 20, and 21.Dunsby 1992, 23. Musicologist Alan Lessem states about the work that \"on the whole instrumental textures tend to become fuller as the work progresses\" and that, in general, \"the piano is the leading [instrumental] protagonist of the melodramas.\"Dunsby 1992, 24. The poetry is a German version of a rondeau of the old French type with a double refrain. Each poem consists of three stanzas of 4 + 4 + 5 lines, with the first two lines of the first stanza (1,2) repeated as the last two lines of the second stanza (7,8), and line 1 additionally repeated (13) to close the third stanza and the poem. The first poem is shown below. {| style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\" | colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |1. Mondestrunken (Drunk with Moonlight) |- |Den Wein, den man mit Augen trinkt, Giesst Nachts der Mond in Wogen nieder, Und eine Springflut \u00fcberschwemmt Den stillen Horizont. Gel\u00fcste schauerlich und s\u00fcss, Durchschwimmen ohne Zahl die Fluten! Den Wein, den man mit Augen trinkt, Giesst Nachts der Mond in Wogen nieder. Der Dichter, den die Andacht treibt, Berauscht sich an dem heilgen Tranke, Gen Himmel wendet er verz\u00fcckt Das Haupt und taumelnd saugt und schl\u00fcrft er Den Wein, den man mit Augen trinkt. | |The wine that one drinks with one\u2019s eyes Is poured down in waves by the moon at night, And a spring tide overflows The silent horizon. Lusts, thrilling and sweet Float numberless through the waters! The wine that one drinks with one's eyes Is poured down in waves by the moon at night. The poet, urged on by his devotions, Becomes intoxicated with the sacred beverage; Enraptured, he turns toward heaven His head, and, staggering, sucks and sips The wine that one drinks with one\u2019s eyes.Schoenberg 1994, 56. |} === Sprechstimme === The atonal, expressionistic settings of the text, with their echoes of German cabaret, bring the poems vividly to life. Sprechstimme, literally \"speech-singing\" in German, is a style in which the vocalist uses the specified rhythms and pitches but does not sustain the pitches, allowing them to drop or rise, in the manner of speech. Schoenberg describes the technique in a foreword to the score: In the score, sprechstimme is indicated with small x's through the stems of notes. Though sprechstimme is used throughout the piece, Schoenberg also occasionally indicates that certain passages are to be sung (gesungen). ==Notable recordings== Notable recordings of this composition include: {|class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\"|Voice !align=\"center\"|Ensemble !align=\"center\"|Conductor !align=\"center\"|Record Company !align=\"center\"|Year of Recording !align=\"center\"|Format |- |align=\"center\"|Erika Stiedry-Wagner |align=\"center\"| |align=\"center\"|Arnold Schoenberg |align=\"center\"|Columbia Records |align=\"center\"|1940 |align=\"center\"|LP |- |align=\"center\"|Helga Pilarczyk |align=\"center\"|Members of the Conservatory Society Concert Orchestra |align=\"center\"|Pierre Boulez |align=\"center\"|Ades |align=\"center\"|1961 |align=\"center\"|LP, CD |- |align=\"center\"|Bethany Beardslee |align=\"center\"|Columbia Chamber Ensemble |align=\"center\"|Robert Craft |align=\"center\"|Columbia / CBS |align=\"center\"|1963 |align=\"center\"|LP |- |align=\"center\"|Jan DeGaetani |align=\"center\"|Contemporary Chamber Ensemble |align=\"center\"|Arthur Weisberg |align=\"center\"|Nonesuch |align=\"center\"|1970 |align=\"center\"|LP, CD |- |align=\"center\"|Cleo Laine |align=\"center\"|Nash Ensemble |align=\"center\"|Elgar Howarth |align=\"center\"|RCA Red Seal Records |align=\"center\"|1974 |align=\"center\"|LP |- |align=\"center\"|Yvonne Minton |align=\"center\"|Ensemble InterContemporain |align=\"center\"|Pierre Boulez |align=\"center\"|Sony Music |align=\"center\"|1977 |align=\"center\"|LP, CD |- |align=\"center\"|Barbara Sukowa |align=\"center\"|Schoenberg Ensemble |align=\"center\"|Reinbert de Leeuw |align=\"center\"|Koch Schwann |align=\"center\"|1988 |align=\"center\"|CD |- |align=\"center\"|Jane Manning |align=\"center\"|Nash Ensemble |align=\"center\"|Simon Rattle |align=\"center\"|Chandos |align=\"center\"|1991 |align=\"center\"|CD |- |align=\"center\"|Phyllis Bryn-Julson |align=\"center\"|New York New Music Ensemble |align=\"center\"|Robert Black |align=\"center\"|GM Recordings |align=\"center\"|1992 |align=\"center\"|CD |- |align=\"center\"|Phyllis Bryn-Julson |align=\"center\"|Ensemble Modern |align=\"center\"|Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s |align=\"center\"|BMG |align=\"center\"|1993 |align=\"center\"|CD |- |align=\"center\"|Karin Ott |align=\"center\"|Cremona Musica Insieme |align=\"center\"|Pietro Antonini |align=\"center\"|Nuova Era |align=\"center\"|1994 |align=\"center\"|CD |- |align=\"center\"|Christine Sch\u00e4fer |align=\"center\"|Ensemble InterContemporain |align=\"center\"|Pierre Boulez |align=\"center\"|Deutsche Grammophon |align=\"center\"|1997 |align=\"center\"|CD |- |align=\"center\"|Anja Silja |align=\"center\"|Twentieth Century Classics Ensemble |align=\"center\"|Robert Craft |align=\"center\"|Naxos |align=\"center\"|1999 |align=\"center\"|CD |} Arnold Schoenberg himself made test recordings of the music with a group of Los Angeles musicians from September 24 to 26, 1940. These recordings were eventually released on LP by Columbia Records in 1949, and reissued in 1974 on the Odyssey label. The jazz singer Cleo Laine recorded Pierrot lunaire in 1974. Her version was nominated for a classical Grammy Award. Another jazz singer who has performed the piece is Sofia Jernberg, who sang it with Norrbotten NEO. The avant-pop star Bj\u00f6rk, known for her interest in avant-garde music, performed Pierrot lunaire at the 1996 Verbier Festival with Kent Nagano conducting. According to the singer in a 2004 interview, \"Kent Nagano wanted to make a recording of it, but I really felt that I would be invading the territory of people who sing this for a lifetime .\"Bj\u00f6rk is Icelandic. \"For a lifetime\" is probably a second-language error for \"all their lives.\" Only small recorded excerpts (possibly bootlegs) of her performance have become available. The American mezzo-soprano Mary Nessinger has performed Pierrot lunaire extensively with organizations such as the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, Chamber Music Northwest, and Sequitur at venues including Alice Tully Hall and Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall. In March 2011, Bruce LaBruce directed a performance at the Hebbel am Ufer Theatre in Berlin. This interpretation of the work included gender diversity, castration scenes and dildos, as well as a female to male transgender Pierrot. LaBruce subsequently filmed this adaptation as the 2014 theatrical film Pierrot lunaire.Pierrot lunaire at the Berlin International Film Festival. ==Legacy as a standard ensemble== The quintet of instruments used in Pierrot lunaire became the core ensemble for The Fires of London, who formed in 1965 as \"The Pierrot Players\" to perform Pierrot lunaire, and continued to concertize with a varied classical and contemporary repertory. This group performed works arranged for these instruments and commissioned new works especially to take advantage of this ensemble's instrumental colors, up until it disbanded in 1987. Over the years, other groups have continued to use this instrumentation professionally (current groups include Da Capo Chamber Players,Kozinn, Allan. \"World Premieres, Sure, but Room for Older New Music Too,\" The New York Times, November 23, 2006. eighth blackbirdRiley, Paul. \"High-flying Quality,\" BBC Magazine, September 1, 2007.) and the Finnish contemporary group Uusinta Lunaire,http://www.uusinta.com/uusintalunaireE.html and have built a large repertoire for the ensemble. ==Notes== ==References== *Bryn-Julson, Phyllis, and Paul Mathews. 2009.
