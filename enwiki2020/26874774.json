Things involving spiritual activities, agriculture as well animals and fruits serve as derivatives for month names. For example the month November known as Mbudzi in Shona means goat. This time is seen as a time were most goats are pregnant. Therefore, killing goats is seen as taboo during this month. The month of July/Chikunguru is thought to be linked to a wild fruit called nhunguru which flourishes in this wintry month when tree leaves are also reddish in colour - as such you might not even see nhunguru fruits easily. Another example would be August known as Nyamavhuvhu meaning the windy one, as this is the windiest month of the year. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !English!!Shona |- |January||Ndira |- |February||Kukadzi |- |March||Kurume |- |April ||Kubvumbi |- |May||Chivabvu |- |June||Chikumi |- |July||Chikunguru |- |August||Nyamavhuvhu |- |September||Gunyana |- |October||Gumiguru |- |November||Mbudzi |- |December||Zvita |} months == *http://www.zambuko.com/mbirapage/shona_imports/pages/calendar_months.html Category:Calendars Category:Shona language ",
