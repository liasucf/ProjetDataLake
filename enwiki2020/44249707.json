Eric Monsef, a former Apple Inc. employee, is leading the Sprout team. The computer was designed by Native Design.Native Design Sprout has dual interactive screens - a vertical touch screen display positioned in-line above a horizontal \u2018TouchMat\u2019 display, and also down-facing imaging sensors. The \"Sprout Illuminator\" serves as a projector, camera, depth sensor and scanner, and projects an image, for example a virtual keyboard, on the TouchMat. For additional input, Sprout includes an Adonit stylus, as well as a Bluetooth-powered set of keyboard and mouse. This enables users to interact with physical and digital content while working. Content can be digitally captured and manipulated in 2D or 3D directly on the TouchMat interface. HP claims that this greatly simplifies and streamlines the creative process. ==Sprout Pro== 2016's upgraded and re-designed version.https://www8.hp.com/h20195/v2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=4AA6-9020ENUC ===Sprout Pro gen2=== 2017's upgraded version; the last model of HP Sprout. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Hewlett-Packard products Category:3D printing Category:Products introduced in 2014 Category:2014 in computing ",
