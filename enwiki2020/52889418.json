    "text": "Herlasgr\u00fcn station Is a local railway junction in the P\u00f6hl district of Herlasgr\u00fcn in Vogtland in the German state of Saxony. It is situated on the Leipzig\u2013Hof and the Herlasgr\u00fcn\u2013Oelsnitz railways. == History== The station was opened on 15 July 1851 along with the Reichenbach\u2013Plauen section of the Leipzig\u2013Hof railway. Originally the station had five tracks: the entrance building and goods facilities with freight sheds, loading ramps and loading roads. With the construction of the Voigtland State Railway (Voigtl\u00e4ndische Staatseisenbahn, Herlasgr\u00fcn\u2013Cheb) starting in 1863, the station infrastructure was extended by two tracks only, since Herlasgr\u00fcn would remain a relatively insignificant station. Passenger services towards the Elster Mountains starting or terminating in Reichenbach commenced with the opening of the Herlasgr\u00fcn\u2013Cheb (Eger in German) line on 1 November 1865. With the construction of the Plauen\u2013Oelsnitz connection, which opened in 1874, Herlasgr\u00fcn station was significantly expanded as the Oelsnitz\u2013Cheb section was operated in conjunction with the new line. Separate trains were now operated on the Herlasgr\u00fcn\u2013Falkenstein section. In addition to a new entrance building in the \"wedge\" between the branching lines, numerous new tracks and a small locomotive depot were built. The old entrance building was used as a residence. In the following decades the station was extended several times, until a larger station upgrade took place in the 1890s. The existing connecting curve between the two railway lines was also established. Up to 1989/90 individual tracks were removed; large-scale dismantling only started at the end of the 1990s. The only new construction was a platform on the connection curve; today only three tracks still operate on the Leipzig\u2013Hof railway. The station has also lost its former importance as a stop for express trains. === Herlasgr\u00fcn locomotive depot=== The Herlasgr\u00fcn locomotive depot, constructed in 1874, consisted of an 11.6-m turntable, a two-storey roundhouse where locomotives were heated (Heizhaus) and a coal shed. The locomotive depot was disbanded around 1900 with the expansion of the Falkenstein locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk Falkenstein). Most recently, class H III locomotives were stationed here. The locomotive shed was demolished in the 1900s; the turntable remained until the early 1970s. ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Sources=== * ==External links== * Category:Railway stations in Saxony Category:Railway stations in Germany opened in 1851 Category:1851 establishments in Saxony Category:Buildings and structures in Vogtlandkreis ",
