It was an updated version of the Northrop A-17, with a more powerful engine and an increased bomb load. While the A-33 was intended initially for the export market, the entire production run was taken up by the United States Army Air Corps. ==Design and development== In 1932, the Northrop Corporation had been formed as a partly owned subsidiary of Douglas and by 1937, the Northrop Model 8 became known as the Douglas 8A produced in the El Segundo Division of Douglas aircraft. The 8A-5 was powered by a 1,200 hp (895 kW) Wright R-1820-87 engine and was the most powerful and best armed of the series, fitted with four wing mounted 0.30 in machine guns, two 0.50 in machine guns in pods below the wing and a rear-firing flexibly mounted 0.30 in gun, and could carry up to 2,000 lb of bombs. ==Operational history== Early in 1940, the Norwegian government ordered 36 8A-5s which not had been delivered before Norway was invaded by the Germans. Completed between October 1940 and January 1941, the aircraft were delivered to a training center in Canada that had been set up for the Norwegian government-in-exile, named \"Little Norway\" at Toronto Island Airport, Ontario. After the loss of two aircraft and a reassessment of the training needs now met by the use of other aircraft, the remaining 34 Model 8A-5Ps were sold to Peru. However, 31 were repossessed by the Army Air Corps at the start of World War II. These aircraft, designated A-33, were used for training, target tug, and utility duties.Pelletier Air Enthusiast September/October 1998, pp. 3\u20134. ==Variants== ;Model 8A-5 : ;A-33 : :Serial numbers: 42-13584/13601 ; 42-109007/109019 ==Operators== ; * Little Norway ; ; * United States Army Air Corps ==Specifications (A-33)== ==See also== ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * Francillon, Ren\u00e9 J.
