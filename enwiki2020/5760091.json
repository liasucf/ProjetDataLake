The total time of this kind of shower can last less than two minutes \u2013 using an initial thirty seconds or so to get wet, followed by shutting off the water, using soap and shampoo and lathering, then rinsing for a minute or less. Navy showers originated on naval ships, where supplies of fresh water were often scarce. Using this method, crew members were able to stay clean, while conserving their limited water supply. The concept has also been adopted by some other people who wish to conserve water and the energy needed to heat the water, for both environmental and economic reasons. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, water heating is typically the second-largest energy expense in homes (after space heating). In colloquial terms, a GI shower takes place when a soldier or sailor is dirty, won't wash, and his fed up fellow troops hold him down and scrub him with heavy duty scrub brushes and cleanser. Maritime cruisers often take navy showers when they are not in a port with easy access to fresh water. A ten-minute shower takes as much as of water, while a navy shower usually takes as little as ; one person can save up to per year. In United States Navy parlance, the term \"Hollywood shower\" contrasts with a navy shower, referring to a long shower with very high water usage. ==See also== * Saltwater soap, also called sailors' soap ==References== Category:Bathing Category:Navies Category:Water conservation ",
