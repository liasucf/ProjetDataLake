    "text": "Reginald Horace Fuller (1915\u20132007) was an Anglo-American biblical scholar, ecumenist, and Anglican priest. His works are recognized for their consequential analysis of New Testament Christology.Raymond E. Brown, 1990. \"Christology\" and \"The Resurrection of Jesus,\" in Raymond E. Brown et al., ed., The New Jerome Biblical Commentary, Prentice Hall, pp. 1354\u20131359, 1373\u20131377. One aspect of his work is on the relation of Jesus to the early church and the church today. For this, his analysis, which uses the historical-critical method, has been described as neo-orthodox.Douglas Martin, 2007. \"Reginald H. Fuller, 92, New Testament Scholar, Dies,\" The New York Times, April 14. == Life events == Fuller was born on 24 March 1915 in Horsham, England.

Fuller became Professor Emeritus at Virginia Theological Seminary in 1985. In 1990, his former students presented a festschrift in his honour.Arland J. Hultgren and Barbara Hall, ed., 1990. Christ and His Communities: Essays in Honor of Reginald H. Fuller, Forward Movement. Fuller became an American citizen in 1995. He was an honorary canon of Cathedral Church of St. Paul in Burlington, Vermont, and Priest in Residence at Emmanuel Church at Brook Hill, Richmond, Va. Fuller was survived by his wife Ilse Barda Fuller, his daughters, Caroline Sloat and Sally Fuller, four grandchildren; and five great-grandsons.Ellen Robertson, 2007. \"The Rev. R.H. Fuller, 92, Dies After a Fall\", Richmond Times-Dispatch, April 6. The New York Times obituary recorded Fuller's belief that the Bible must be proclaimed every Sunday. It closed by noting that, \"On March 25, the day he suffered the fall that eventually led to his death, he taught a Sunday school class on the Resurrection.\" == The Foundations of New Testament Christology == Reginald H. Fuller's treatise, The Foundations of New Testament Christology (1965),Reginald H. Fuller, 1965. The Foundations of New Testament Christology, Scribners. . illustrates aspects of his scholarly publications. The book defines key terms, states assumptions, describes the method used, and develops implications in cumulative fashion. Thus, 'Christology' (the doctrine of Jesus Christ's person) refers to a response to a particular history, not the action of God in Jesus as such nor the history itself. Analysis of New Testament Christology begins with the disciples' belief in the resurrection. It is concerned with \"what can be known of the words and works of Jesus\" and how these were interpreted. 'Foundations of New Testament Christology' is foundational in referring to presuppositions of NT writers rather than to the theology of their finished product (pp. 15\u201317). The book considers the response of the early church as to conceptual tools available in successive environments of Palestinian Judaism, Hellenistic Judaism, and the Graeco-Roman gentile world. \"What can be known\" of the historical Jesus and the early church's mission depends on critical methods and tests applied to documents from the gentile mission. Such methods and tests distinguish the knowledge of early writers about Jesus, their own theology, and other traditions to which they responded (pp. 17\u201320). The book makes explicit which elements of sources are accepted as going back to each stratum of the early church. It accepts assignment of a tradition to a specific stratum with: * elaboration in case of wide acceptance * a summary of the argument in case wide acceptance is lacking * elaboration in case a common assignment is rejected or a new assignment is proposed (p. 21). With the emergence of a post-Bultmann school of \"historical- traditio criticism\", the concern of the book is \"to establish a continuity of the historical Jesus and the christological kerygma of the post-resurrection church.\" The real continuity, Fuller felt, \"was obscured, if not actually denied, by Bultmann's own work\", to the disadvantage of the church's proclamation (p. 11). The book concludes that the christological foundations of the early church (as recoverable from the New Testament and formulations of church fathers) \"are also the foundations of Christology today\" (p. 257). == Selected publications== ===Books=== * \\- 1960, 2nd ed. * * * * *Reviews from Journal of Biblical Literature (first page) and Theology Today * * * * * * * * ===Edited by=== ** ===Chapters or entries=== * * * * * * ===Journal articles=== * * * ==See also== * The Myth of God Incarnate == Notes == ==References== * Arland J.
