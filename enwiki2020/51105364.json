The category was initiated in 2016 alongside Outstanding Short Form Comedy or Drama Series and Outstanding Short Form Nonfiction or Reality Series. The awards replaced the now-retired category for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program. These awards are not presented at the Primetime Emmy Awards show, but at the Creative Arts Emmy Award show. ==Winners and nominations== ===2010s=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\" |- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\" !
