    "text": "Danilo \"Dane\" Stanisavljevi\u0107 (; 1917 \u2013 24 October 1942) was one the leaders of the uprising of Serbs in Lika against the Independent State of Croatia and later a military officer of the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland with the rank of voivode. Commonly known as Dane Cicvara (), he is best known for being commander of Serb rebels from Gra\u010dac who were first to attack the Usta\u0161e of the Independent State of Croatia on 12 April 1941. His elder brother Todor was also member of the rebels. After the Srb uprising, the rebel-controlled territory was peacefully integrated into the Italian occupation zone which for a while saved lives of the remaining Serbs in the region from the ongoing genocide of Serbs by the Independent State of Croatia. Stanisavljevi\u0107 was appointed as a commander of the Gra\u010dac Chetnik battalion \"Gavrilo Princip\". He was also an acting commander of the Chetnik regiment \"Vo\u017ed Kara\u0111or\u0111e\". The Croatian Communist Party and its armed formations of Partisans targeted Stanisavljevi\u0107 because they perceived him and other Chetniks as an obstacle for their revolutionary aims and killed him on 24 October 1942. == Early life == Stanisavljevi\u0107 was born in 1917 in the village Doji\u0107i near Gra\u010dac, Austria- Hungary (modern-day Croatia). Stanisavljevi\u0107 served in the Royal Yugoslav Army as member of the Mountain Regiment in Ljubljana. He was selected to attend the funeral of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk on 21 November 1938 as a member of the honorary guard unit. He had a brother, Todor \"To\u0107an\" Stanisavljevi\u0107, who was also a member of the resistance movement. == World War II == Stanisavljevi\u0107 was commander of Serb rebels from Gra\u010dac who were first to attack Usta\u0161e of the Independent State of Croatia on 12 April 1941. On that day rebels commanded by Stanisavljevi\u0107 defended Gra\u010dac from Usta\u0161e units coming from Gospi\u0107. This action gained Yugoslav Chetnik character because the rebels from Gra\u010dac were joined by 50 marines of Yugoslav Royal Navy commanded by Captain Mirko Blajvajz, the commander of the nearby Selce coast command. According to historian \u017duti\u0107, the first Chetnik units were established near Doboj on the same day by soldiers of the Royal Yugoslav Army. The Chetnik leaders of Lika and Bosnian Krajina wished to save Serbs from their most bloodthirsty enemy - Usta\u0161e, even if they had temporarily to accept rule of Italians and Germans.:\"Mane Rokvi\u0107, Dobroslav Jev\u0111evi\u0107 i Brana Bogunovi\u0107; ... Vo\u0111e srpskih \u010detnika... \u017eele da zasad srpski narod spase bar od najkrvavijeg protivnika, usta\u0161a, makar privremeno primio vlast Nemaca i Italijana\" In December 1941 the Gra\u010dac Chetnik Battalion \"Gavrilo Princip\" was established. Stanisavljevi\u0107 was appointed as its commander and as acting commander of the Chetnik Regiment \"Vo\u017ed Kara\u0111or\u0111e\". Stanisavljevi\u0107 closely collaborated with Pajica Om\u010dikus in Srb and Mom\u010dilo \u0110uji\u0107 and Niko Novakovi\u0107 Longo. As commander of Chetnik Battalion, in the middle of May 1942 Stanisavljevi\u0107 issued proclamation titled \"Serbs of Dalmatia\". In this proclamation he invited Serbs who joined Partisans under control of the Communist Party of Croatia to leave the Partisans who were accused to be the main enemies of Serbs and being under command of Usta\u0161e. This proclamation invited them to join Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland instead.:\"...sredinom svibnja izdao D. Stanisavljevi\u0107 Cicvara, u funkciji komandanta \u010detni\u010dkog bataljona, pozivaju se Srbi u partizanskim jedinicama da se priklju\u010de \u010detnicima. Partizani se optu\u017euju kao glavni neprijatelji srpskog naroda te da se u njihovim redovima naj\u010de\u0161\u0107e nalaze Usta\u0161e u \u010dijim je rukama komanda. The Croatian communists targeted Stanisavljevi\u0107 and ordered Partisan unit from Gra\u010dac to kill him and all members of the headquarters of Chetnik regiment. According to Milan \u0160ijan, the commander of communist 3rd Lika Brigade, Stanisavljevi\u0107 was a little earlier promoted to the rank of voivode of Lika and Kordun. The partisans attacked the officers of the Chetnik Gra\u010dac Brigade and killed 70 Chetniks including Stanisavljevi\u0107 and many other members of the Chetnik command. According to \u0160ijan, Stanisavljevi\u0107 was first wounded when Aleksa Jak\u0161i\u0107 shot him using light machine gun. \u0160ijan emphasized that Stanisavljevi\u0107 committed suicide not to allow communists to capture him alive. Other communist published sources emphasize that Cicvara and other Chetniks were killed by Partisans who used only knives and bombs. == References == == Sources == * * * * Category:1917 births Category:1942 deaths Category:People from Gra\u010dac Category:Serbs of Croatia Category:Royal Yugoslav Army personnel Category:Chetnik personnel of World War II Category:People killed by Yugoslav Partisans ",
