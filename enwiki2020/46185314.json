There is some confusion on how to name this class.http://www.navsource.org/archives/11/02idx.htm The class is often described as the Aggressive-class, as was the first ship to be commissioned. Sometimes four ships are a Dash-class subclass, although all ships are of the same design.Paul H. Silverstone: US Warships since 1945. Allan Ltd., Shepperton, Surrey (UK) 1986, p. 127. ==Design== As a result of experiences during the Korean War, the United States Navy undertook a large scale construction of a new series of minesweepers. In contrast to the steel-hulled minesweepers built before, the Agile-class minesweepers were built mostly of wood with bronze and stainless steel fittings and engines to minimize their magnetic signature. The ships were equipped with the UQS-1 mine-locating sonar and were capable of sweeping moored, bottom contact, magnetic and acoustic mines.Stefan Terzibaschitsch: Seemacht USA. Bechterm\u00fcnz Verlag, Augsburg (Germany) 1997, p. 609. ==Modernization== Although it was planned to modernize all U.S. Navy ship of this class, only 19 ships were modernized starting with Fiscal Year 1968. The modernization cost between 700,000 and 1,500,000 $ per ship and should enable them to operate for another ten years. The ships received new aluminum block Waukesha diesel engines and the superstructure was enlarged aft. The UQS-1 sonar was replaced with SQQ-14. Two PAP-104 cable-guided undersea tools were added. Also, two 40 hp zodiacs were carried for the purpose of mooring the new sonar reflectors. Also, a team of mine clearance divers was added. Additional space on the foc'sle was needed for installation of the SQQ-14 cabling so the 40mm Bofors bow gun was replaced with a mount for a twin 20 mm Mk 68 gun.Terzibaschitsch, p. 609; http://www.allwoodships.com/MilitaryShips/MineWarfare/AM-421,Agile- Aggressive.htm As of 2015, the four ships transferred to Taiwan are still in service. ==Construction and disposition== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Ship Name !Hull No. !Builder !Commission\u2013 Decommission !Fate !Link |- | ||421||Luders Marine Construction Co. of Stamford, Connecticut||1956\u20131972||Sold for scrap 1980||[] |- | ||422||Luders Marine Construction Co. of Stamford, Connecticut||1953\u20131971||Sold for scrap 1980||[] |- | ||423||Luders Marine Construction Co. of Stamford, Connecticut||1954-1970||Destroyed by fire, sold for scrapping 1969|| |- | ||424||Norfolk Naval Shipyard||1953-1971||Sold for scrap 1981||[] |- | ||425||Norfolk Naval Shipyard||1953-1971||Sold for scrap 1980||[] |- | ||426||Fulton Shipyard, Antioch, California||1954-1973||Sold for scrap 1973||[] |- | ||427||Fulton Shipyard, Antioch, California||1954-1992||Sold for scrap 2001||[] |- | ||428||Astoria Marine Construction, Astoria, Oregon||1953-1982||Sold for scrap 1984||[] |- | ||429||Astoria Marine Construction, Astoria, Oregon||1953-1982||Sold for scrap 1984||[] |- | ||430||Hiltebrant Dry Dock Co., Kingston, New York||1954-1982||Sold for scrap 1984||[] |- | ||431||Hiltebrant Dry Dock Co., Kingston, New York||1954-1982||Sold for scrap 1984||[] |- | ||432||Colberg Boat Works, Stockton, California ||1953-1971 1971-1998 ||1971 to Spain as Guadalete (M41) 1971, decommissioned 1998 ||[] |- | ||433||Colberg Boat Works, Stockton, California ||1953-1991 ||Scrapped 2002 ||[] |- | ||434||Colberg Boat Works, Stockton, California ||1954-1972 ||Sold to be scrapped 1976, privately held until scrapped by the USACE in 1993.||[] |- | ||435||J.
