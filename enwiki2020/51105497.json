    "text": "A general election was held in the U.S. state of Arizona on November 6, 2018. All of Arizona's executive offices were up for election as well as a United States Senate seat and all of Arizona's nine seats in the United States House of Representatives. The Democratic Party picked up three statewide offices, as well as a seat in the U.S. House. ==U.S. Senate== Incumbent Republican Jeff Flake was eligible to run for re-election to a second term. As a strong critic of President Donald Trump and remaining unpopular in the state, Flake announced in October 2017 that he will not seek re election. President Trump and Republicans backed Martha McSally to succeed Flake. Kelli Ward, former State Senator and candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2016 also ran for the Republican nomination for the open seat. ===Results=== On the evening of Monday, November 12, 2018 McSally posted on her Twitter that she had spoke with Sinema and conceded. Sinema celebrated with supporters later that evening. ==U.S. House of Representatives== Seven of nine incumbents in the United States House of Representatives ran for re-election in 2018, and all won. The primary elections took place on August 28, 2018. The general elections took place on November 6, 2018, and the open 2nd district flipped from Republican to Democratic. {|class=\"wikitable\" !CD !Dem. !Rep. !Grn. |- |1 |Tom O'Halleran (incumbent) |Wendy Rogers | |- |2 |Ann Kirkpatrick |Lea Marquez-Peterson | |- |3 |Ra\u00fal Grijalva (incumbent) |Nicolas Pierson | |- |4 |David Brill |Paul Gosar (incumbent) |Haryaksha Gregor Knauer |- |5 |Joan Greene |Andy Biggs (incumbent) | |- |6 |Anita Malik |David Schweikert (incumbent) | |- |7 |Ruben Gallego (incumbent) |(write-in) |Gary Swing |- |8 |Hiral Tipirneni |Debbie Lesko (incumbent) | |- |9 |Greg Stanton |Steve Ferrara | |- |} Winners are in Boldhttps://results.arizona.vote/#/federal/4/0 ==Governor== Incumbent Republican Governor Doug Ducey won re-election to a second term. ===Results=== ==Secretary of State== Incumbent Republican Secretary of State Michele Reagan lost the nomination for a second term to Steve Gaynor, who lost the general election to Democratic state senator Katie Hobbs. ===Democratic primary=== ====Candidates==== *Katie Hobbs, State Senate minority leader. ====Primary results==== ===Republican primary=== ====Candidates==== *Michele Reagan, incumbent *Steve Gaynor, businessman ====Primary results==== ===Libertarian primary=== ====Candidates==== *Jenn Gray (write-in candidate) ===General election=== Governing magazine projected the race as \"likely Republican\". ===Polling=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- valign=bottom !
