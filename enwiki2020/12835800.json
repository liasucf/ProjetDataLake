He then headed out of the Czech Republic, spending time at Odd Grenland in Norway and Artmedia Bratislava in Slovakia. In 2009, he returned to the Czech Republic to play for Brno. Posp\u011bch joined Second League side Opava in September 2009, five years after having left his boyhood club. In November 2009, the Czech Disciplinary Commission suspended Posp\u011bch, which left him unable to play professional football until October 2010. Posp\u011bch moved on loan from Brno to Slavia Prague in February 2011 until the end of June. Posp\u011bch missed almost two years of league football before scoring on his return to action in a 1\u20130 win for Slavia Prague against former club Slovan Liberec in March 2011. He finished the spring part of the 2010\u201311 Czech First League as Slavia's top scorer with seven goals. In June 2011, as his loan was coming to an end, he signed a three-year contract with Slavia. Despite scoring a total of 13 league goals in a season and a half with Slavia, making him their leading scorer, Slavia terminated Posp\u011bch's contract in June 2012, leaving him free to look for a new club. After signing for Dukla Prague in the summer of 2012, Posp\u011bch took until October 2012 to score his first league goal for the club, which came in a 1\u20130 win against Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. He finished the season with 9 goals from 28 matches. Posp\u011bch scored four goals in a match, becoming just the fifth player in the history of the Czech league to do so, in July 2013 during Dukla's 4\u20130 win against Sigma Olomouc. He finished the month in second place in the league's Player of the Month competition behind Plze\u0148 striker Tom\u00e1\u0161 W\u00e1gner. In his second season at Dukla, he scored 16 goals, becoming the second highest scorer in the league for the season. Posp\u011bch signed a two year contract with German 3.
