    "text": "Shukar Collective (from the Romany word Shukar or \u015eucar, meaning \"fine\") is a Romanian musical group which fuses traditional Romany and electronic music. It is especially known for using traditional rhythms employed by the Ursari section of the Roma minority with contemporary electronic sampling. They generally mix various sounds produced by tapping spoons or other domestic objects with those produced on analog synthesizers. The concept that led to the success of the group belongs to Paul \u021aanicui, Romanian film director who discovered the ursari musicians Tamango, Napoleon and Classic that he would later name \u201cShukar\u201d. Short time after, Romanian musicians Dj Vasile, Dan Handrabur (aka Dreamdoktor), Cristi Stanciu (aka Matze) and Vlaicu Golcea came with the compositions of the first Shukar Collective album, \"Taves Bahtalo!\"/ \"Urban Gypsy\". Recently, they have been collaborating with Romanian multimedia artist Mircea Florian. In 2010, the group was the subject of an HBO documentary. Shukar Collective participated at Brighton Fringe Festival on 2 May 2010, a day after their concert in the Brixton neighborhood, London, where the electro-pop clubs are always full. This mini-tour was done with the help and support of The Romanian Cultural Institute, from London. == Discography == === Released Albums === *2005 Urban Gypsy Song list: 01-Calling Tamango 02-The Wind 03-Malademna 04-Gipsy Blooz 05-Taraf 06-Oh, Mother 07-Bar Boot 08-Shub 09-Mamo 10-Hahaha 11-Desperiae Romanes 12-Do Baba 13-Lautarium 14-Verbal Fight 15-Wander (Bonus track) *2007 Rromatek Song list: 01-Oh, Girl 02-Dalladida 03-Ragga Mam\u00ef 04-New Shout 05-Hi Ley 06-The Snake 07-Truppa Truppa 08-Mean Macheen 09-Pray 10-Shukar Muzika 11-Napolament 12-Pam Para\u00ef 13-Gossip 14-Time Peace 15-Da\u00ef Da\u00ef ==References== ==External links== *Official MySpace profile *The Romanian Cultural Institute *Balkan Brass World * Category:Romanian Romani musical groups Category:Romanian electronic music groups ",
