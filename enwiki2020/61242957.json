    "text": "Filipino lumpia with an agre dulce dipping sauce Agre dulce, also known as Filipino sweet and sour sauce, is a Filipino sweet and sour condiment. It is made by mixing cornstarch with water, salt, sugar, and a tangy ingredient; typically tomato ketchup, banana ketchup, or pineapples. The mixture is brought to a boil then simmered until it thickens. Labuyo chilis and other spices may also be added. The name means \"sour-sweet\" in Philippine Spanish, from Spanish agrio (\"sour\") and dulce (\"sweet\"). It is also known as agri dulci in Chavacano and can refer to dishes cooked with the sauce. Agre dulce is commonly used as a dipping sauce for appetizers like lumpia or okoy. ==See also== * Banana ketchup * Palapa * Philippine condiments * Agrodolce ==References== ==External links== Category:Condiments Category:Philippine condiments ",
