Many of the locals were dissenters and would not pay the amount of \u00a3200 required by the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry for his blessing, so its consecration was delayed until 28 June 1834. The church was restored and enlarged between 1884 and 1885 when the chancel was added. The old pews were taken away and the side galleries taken down. A reredos was given by Mr. R.G. Lomas of Derby. The church was re-opened by the Bishop of Southwell on 8 April 1885. ==Parish status== The church is in a joint parish with *Christ Church, Ironville ==Organ== A pipe organ was built by Bevington ca. 1850.
