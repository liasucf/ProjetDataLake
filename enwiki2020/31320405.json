The story begins when Romola (Suchitra Sen), a relative of Rajanibabu and her family comes to stay in the boarding, after being thrown out of their rented house. Rajanibabu calls a meeting where all the residents except Shibbabu cast vote in favour of Romola's staying. Rampriti (Uttam Kumar), the son of a wealthy family, who also stays at the boarding, is away home. On the day of his return, he telephones Annapurna Boarding to inform the cook Modon (Nabadwip Haldar) to prepare food for him that night. Seeing no one to answer the phone, Romola picks it up, but Rampriti does not believe that there's a girl in the boarding and so an exchange of hot words takes place. Rampriti, after returning narrates the incident to Kedar (Bhanu Bandopadhyay), another resident of the Boarding. Romola overhears them and berates Rampriti, silencing him. However, they fall in love and exchange love letters, but this fact becomes known to the other residents and they start teasing both of them. Rajanibabu, the go- between, is given a love letter to deliver but as he's hurrying to catch the train home, he keeps it in his pocket. At home, he quarrels with his wife (Molina Devi) and leaves the house in the middle of night. His wife manages to find the love letter and thinks that her husband is running an extramarital affair. Seeing that Romola and Rampriti are in love, Rajanibabu makes the marriage arrangements for them and calls Rampriti's and Romola's father. Rajanibabu's wife prepares a puja to bring him back. She becomes impatient and goes to the Boarding House. She charges her husband of infidelity and drags him to another room where Rajanibabu tells her the truth about the letter. He says, it is about Rampriti and Romola, the couple who are getting married the very day. The residents make fun of them and the film ends with Rampriti and Romola sitting side-by-side at the marriage altar. ==Cast== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Cast !!
