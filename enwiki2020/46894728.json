It is part of the Retiro station complex. ==Overview== Retiro Belgrano is the terminus for the General Belgrano Railway and is adjacent to the Retiro bus station (Terminal de Omnibus), the principal long- distance bus terminal in Buenos Aires, the Retiro Mitre station of Mitre Railway, and the Retiro San Mart\u00edn station of the San Mart\u00edn Railway. The complex is accessible by the C line of the Buenos Aires Metro system and by numerous local public bus services. The station will also be accessible by both Line E and Line H of the metro once their extensions are complete. Retiro Belgrano has three entrances, the main one on Ramos Mej\u00eda avenue, another next to the main entrance (on the same avenue) and a lateral one (on Padre Mujica street, at the east). == History == The building was built by the British C\u00f3rdoba Central Railway that originally connected the cities of Rosario and C\u00f3rdoba until in 1903 the Government allowed the company to extend its network to Buenos Aires, from north to south. In 1906 trains reached Villa Rosa in Pilar Partido and finally arriving in Buenos Aires in 1912. The terminal station, designed by architects Faure Dujarric and Robert Prentice, was remodeled and enlarged in 1914. One floor and a dome with a clock were added to the original construction. The building style has remained to present days.\"Historia de las estaciones terminales Retiro\", Arc\u00f3n de Buenos Aires In 2011 the station was remodeled, repairing the external masonry, facade and dome.\"Renovaci\u00f3n y puesta en valor de estaciones terminales de ferrocarriles\", Secretar\u00eda de Transporte == Gallery == File:Hall de Retiro Belgrano.jpg|Hall File:Ferrovias trains retiro.jpg|Trains File:Atardecer en Retiro Belgrano.jpg|Platform entrance File:Vista de los andenes de Retiro Belgrano.jpg|Indoor platform File:Alero a la calle de Retiro Belgrano.jpg|Eaves File:Retiro, Belgrano Norte.jpg|Aerial view File:Train ferrovias retiro2.jpg|Train at the station ==See also== *Retiro railway station *Retiro Mitre railway station *Retiro San Mart\u00edn railway station *Rail transport in Argentina *Retiro (Line C Buenos Aires Underground) *Retiro (Line E Buenos Aires Underground) *Retiro (Line G Buenos Aires Underground) *Retiro (Line H Buenos Aires Underground) ==References== ==External links== Retiro (Belgrano) Category:Railway stations opened in 1914 ",
