    "text": "Robert Weir Allan (1851\u20131942) was a Scottish-born painter known mainly for his depiction of landscape and marine subjects. He was born in Glasgow into a family that encouraged and valued his natural artistic ability. He exhibited at the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts when aged 22, and two years later he had a painting selected for the Royal Academy, in London. In 1875\u201380 he attended the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris, and he was influenced by the French school of rustic naturalism and also by French Impressionism. Working plein- air, he developed a loose, painterly approach to landscape subjects. He was a prolific artist who travelled widely in Europe, India, Japan, the Middle East and America; however, he drew particular inspiration from the north-east coast of Scotland \u2013 a subject to which he returned throughout his life. He exhibited extensively in London, Glasgow and Edinburgh, and became vice-president of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours. He was equally at home with oil painting, and during his lifetime he had 84 paintings selected for exhibition at the Royal Academy. For the last 60 years of his life his home was in London, and he died there at the age of 90 in 1942. == Artistic ambitions == Home from the Herring Fishing, oil painting, 1876 Robert Weir Allan was born in Glasgow on 11 November 1851. In partnership with the engraver William Ferguson, his father, David Allan, had built up a successful printing and publishing business that operated from Argyll Street in the centre of the city.George Fairfull Smith, Allan and Ferguson's Views in Glasgow. Robert ('Bob') was the seventh of eight children.Ancestry.com, 1861 Scotland census. Parents: David Allan, 51 [his age on the 1861 census is given as 57; this appears to be a transcription error as the 1851 census and 1871 census both give his birth date as c.1810] and Catherine Allan, 44 [n\u00e9e Glassford]. Children: Mary S Allan, 24; Alexander Glassford Allan, 15; John G Allan, 13; Robt W Allan, 9; James A Allan, 5. The 1851 census shows three older siblings not recorded in 1861: David Allan (born c.1832), Catherine Glassford Allan (born c.1841) and Christina Glassford Allan (born c.1843). He grew up in a household that appreciated art: his father 'dabbled a little with colours' and owned a small collection of paintings.Mrs Arthur Bell (N. D'Anvers), 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', International Studio, vol. 14, no. 56 (October 1901), p. 229. The 1871 census shows that 'Allan and Ferguson' was very much a family business, with Catherine, Chrestina (sic \u2013 presumably Christina), John and James Allan all being 'lithographers', while Robert and his younger brother, James, were described as 'artist lithographers'.Ancestry.com, 1871 Scotland census: 263 New City Rd, Maryhill, Glasgow. Household: David Allan, 61; Catherine G. Allan, lithographer, 30; 'Chrestina' G. Allan, lithographer, 28; John G. Allan, lithographer, 23; Robert W. Allan, artist lithographer, 29; James A. Allan, artist lithographer, 16. It is likely that David Allan's wife died before this census date. It had been assumed by his parents that Robert would carry on the business, but 'so strong \u2026 was Robert Allan's love of art \u2026 that his parents wisely allowed him to follow his bent.'Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 229. In 1873 his oil painting A Sunny Day at the Sea was exhibited at the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, and two years later his ambition to be an artist was further fuelled with the selection of Waiting the Tide for the Royal Academy's summer exhibition in London.His address in the Royal Academy catalogue for 1875 was 188 St Vincent Street, Glasgow. These seafaring subjects were executed at the time when his older brother Alexander Glassford Allan became a qualified ship's captain.Ancestry.com: Alexander Glassford Allan qualified as 'second mate' on 3 February 1868 and as 'master' on 21 April 1873. Later in 1875, David Allan died, providing Robert and his siblings with a useful inheritence.1875 Scotland, National Probate Index (Calendar of Confirmations and Inventories), 1876\u20131936: probate for David Allan (Lithographer) 27 January 1876. He died on 24 November 1875 (i.e. aged 65). Probate granted to Robert Weir Allan (artist), Catherine Glassford Allan and Christina Glassford Allan, all residing at 11 Clarendon Place, New City Road, Glasgow, and William Caldwell, writer, Glasgow. Value of estate \u00a32,403, additional estate \u00a31,830 from corrective inventory provided by William Caldwell. The total amounts to about \u00a3492,000 in 2019's terms. == 'Careful yet careless days' == Feeling the need for formal art training, Robert Allan took the bold step of moving to Paris, where he attended the Acad\u00e9mie Julian from 1875 to 1880.Acad\u00e9mie Julian archives. The Acad\u00e9mie was welcoming of foreign students and was regarded as a stepping stone to the prestigious Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where Allan trained under Alexandre Cabanel.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 230. Allan hired a studio in the Boulevard d'Enfer, where his bare walls became covered with sketches and studies. The community of English-speaking fellow art students were very supportive of each other \u2013 former Slade School of Art student Arthur Bell and Belgian-British writer Nancy Meugens (later Mrs Bell)Arthur George Bell fl.1849\u20131916 (Suffolk Artists website). Nancy Regina Emily Meugens (1844\u20131933) wrote under the pen-name N. D'Anvers, and published her International Studio magazine article on Allan under the name 'Mrs. Arthur Bell'. were frequent visitors. In an article in International Studio magazine, Nancy describes the 'hard-work and frugal living' of those 'careful yet careless days'. Allan had a 'deeply interesting personality, with a rare power of winning the hearts of those with whom he was brought in contact'.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 230. To keep homesickness at bay, porridge was eaten, 'a store of the wherewithal having been sent for from the northern home in a goodly sack'.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 232. == Watercolour and plein-air work == As Allan would always remain a landscape painter, it is difficult to assess what he took from a training as centred on life-study classes as was that of the Acad\u00e9mie. Mrs Bell notes that Allan's years in Paris coincided with the emergence of Jules Bastien-Lepage as the leader of the French 'rustic naturalist' plein-air movement, and it was he 'who exercised perhaps more influence on [Allan] than did any of the men under whose direct criticism he studied'.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 232. Allan was using the spontaneity of the watercolour medium for a series of plein-air studies of coastal and market views that he sent back to English and Scottish exhibitions.French Fishing Boat with Figures, Cancale and Village Well in Brittany were exhibited at the Glasgow Institute in 1876. His bold and painterly style was inspired to some extent by the Impressionists, whose exhibitions were a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in Paris in 1875\u20136. In 1878 Allan was visited by his friend Arthur Melville, a young artist from East Lothian.The sale of Arthur Melville's A Cabbage Garden, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1878, provided funds for his trip to Paris \u2013 see National Galleries Scotland website, Arthur Melville, A Cabbage Garden. Together they travelled in Normandy and Brittany, producing coastal views and rural subjects.Christopher Brickley, 'Arthur Melville and Presbyterian Realism,' PhD thesis, University of St Andrews, 1996, p. 153: 'The parallels in subject matter, dates and locations suggest definite contact between the artists throughout Melville's stay in France.' In Paris, Melville also studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian,As Arthur Melville is not recorded in the Acad\u00e9mie Julian archives, it is possible that this was a part-time or short-stay attendance. and he stayed at Allan's studio in the Boulevard d'Enfer. Mrs Bell recalls that 'The Scotch songs sung, the wild reels danced in Mr. Allan's studio, which sometimes alarmed the natives admitted to share in the revels, kept home memories alive.'Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 232. An oil portrait of Robert Allan by Arthur Melville dating from 1878 was dedicated 'A mon ami R W Allan'.Brickley, 'Arthur Melville and Presbyterian Realism', p. 158, and on p. 153 Brickley suggests that the watercolour portrait in Aberdeen Art Gallery is a study for the now lost oil. Through Allan, Melville was introduced to watercolour painting and the innovative technique \u2013 which critics would describe as 'blottesque'In an article in the Evening Mail of 31 May 1867 it is claimed that the term, as a nickname, was coined by John Ruskin. Arthur Melville was a more extreme exponent of the technique, and this is discussed in Brickley, 'Arthur Melville and Presbyterian Realism', pp. 35 117. \u2013 where blots and runs were used to suggest form. == Making his mark == Funeral of Thomas Carlyle: the oil painting was probably completed somewhat later than the watercolour, c.1882 During the summer vacation of 1879 Robert Allan revisited Scotland \u2013 an oil painting August in Fifeshire was selected for the Royal Academy the following year, and several watercolours such as Village of CrailDaily Review, 2 February 1880. and Fishing Boats in a Harbour also date from this time. After completing his studies in Paris in 1880 he visited Spain,A 'Spanish subject' was exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy exhibition in February 1881. This may have been the watercolour Market Place, Grenada that had been purchased by John Forbes White, a wealthy Aberdeen flour-mill owner, and which was subsequently sold by him in 1888 (Aberdeen Press and Journal, 3 December 1888). before returning to Scotland as a base,His address in the Royal Academy catalogue for 1880 was 126 Renfield Street, Glasgow and in the autumn of that year he painted further Fife-located subjects.A watercolour of the Island of May (located off the Firth of Forth) is inscribed 'To my friend James Duncan, September 1880', and Leuchars Parish Church (in Fife) was exhibited in February 1881 at the Royal Scottish Academy (Glasgow Herald, 28 February 1881). Ironically, it was through a non-typical work that Allan 'made his mark outside of his immediate art-circle'. Mrs Bell explains that, 'owing to a fortunate conjunction of circumstances', Robert Allan was the only artist who witnessed the interment of the writer Thomas Carlyle, on 10 February 1881 in Ecclefechan, Dumfriesshire.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 234. His watercolour Funeral of Thomas Carlyle owes more to the French rustic naturalist school than is evident in most of his work. When it was exhibited at the Glasgow Institute in September 1881 the Galloway News described it as 'the picture of the Exhibition \u2026 Mr. Allan \u2026 is one of our best water-colour painters, but such a great work as this will make for him an enduring reputation in the art world. The drawing is \u2026 an artistic trophy, worthy of our National galleries.'Galloway News and Kirkcudbrightshire Advertiser, 9 September 1881 \u2013 review of the fourth exhibition of the Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour, held at the Glasgow Institute. Perhaps in response to this suggestion, Allan worked the watercolour up as an oil painting.The Aberdeen Evening Express of 30 November 1887 notes that Funeral of Thomas Carlyle was exhibited in at the Aberdeen Artists' Society. In the context of the article it appears to be the oil-painting version of the composition. The oil painting was gifted to Glasgow Museums by the artist in 1911. Allan revisited the subject with a further watercolour drawing and also an etching exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, in 1885. An etching of this subject is in the National Trust Collection (NT 263471), where it is credited to 'Robin Alan'. == Aberdeeenshire and European travel == Venice with view of San Giorgio Maggiore \u2013 oil painting \u2013 date unknown In the summer of 1881 Allan travelled up Scotland's east coast to Aberdeenshire \u2013 coastal views of this area would become his archetypical subjects. A later article in a local newspaper, 'Tribute from Fraserburgh', explains: 'For this particular locality no painter has done so much as has Robert W. Allan. Coming here some 28 years ago [c.1881], he was fascinated by the grey skies, the ever-toiling sea with its burden of hardy fishermen in their brown and purple boats \u2013 a charm that has never left him \u2026 there is no truer or loftier exponent or interpreter of our East Coast scenery than is to be found in this charming artist.'Fraserburgh Herald and Northern Counties Advertiser, 30 March 1909. Allan was a prolific, hard-working and popular artist. He travelled widely in Europe, and brought back watercolours that often included recognisable locations such as the Doge's Palace, Venice; Notre-Dame, Paris; and Dutch canal viewsMoored Boats outside the Cathedral at Dordrecht (the Netherlands), signed and dated 1882. while avoiding clich\u00e9. His work was widely exhibited, sold well, and received encouraging press notices. 'Southwark Bridge, London \u2026 with barges in the foreground, [is] diffused with fine colour against a soft grey sky, full of atmosphere and fine quality, such as no other picture in the exhibition shows,' one reviewer commented.Galloway News and Kirkcudbrightshire Advertiser, 9 September 1881, in reference to an exhibition at the Glasgow Institute. In 1883\u2018Distinction and Wide Variety in Robert Weir Allan\u2019s Paintings\u2019, Christian Science Monitor (Boston, Mass.), 4 January 1913. Allan took a studio in Haverstock Hill, Hampstead,Avon House, 33 Steele's Road, Haverstock Hill, Hampstead (from 1880 to 1885). and would make London his base for the rest his life \u2013 placing him in the centre of the British art world while also giving him access to Scotland through the rapidly developing railway routes.In 1885 the journey time from London to Edinburgh was nine hours. == In the heart of the city == In the mid-1880s Allan was living in a two-room flat on the third floor of 27 Piccadilly in the heart of London's art world.Ancestry.com, 1888 Electoral Register. Allan used his proximity to London's exhibiting societies to exhibit widely: with the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours (RI), which had just moved into new exhibiting galleries on Piccadilly; the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours (RWS) \u2013 also known as the Old Water-Colour Society \u2013 whose headquarters were in Pall Mall and whose exhibitions were held at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly; the Society of British Artists (SBA), which exhibited in Suffolk Street (just off Pall Mall); and the Royal Academy, at Burlington House, Piccadilly. In reviewing a SBA exhibition at Suffolk Street in 1883, the Dundee Advertiser singled out Robert Allan and Arthur Melville as Scottish artists 'of note'. Commenting on Arriving from the Herring Fishing, it declared, 'Allan has won a position for himself in England more easily and more rapidly perhaps than any other young Scottish artist. His Continental studies prepared him for a thorough interpretation of the marine scenery on the east coast of Scotland, and he has wrought up this subject with great success.Dundee Advertiser, 1 May 1883. == 'A French orientation' == Arriving From the Ferry water-colour painting with a view of Dordrecht (Holland),1888 Despite resistance from the London art establishment, painting in the progressive French manner was starting to percolate through exhibitions at the Grosvenor Gallery and the New English Art Club (founded in 1886). The Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours gave a 'nod to impressionism' by electing Robert Allan an associate in 1887 (and Arthur Melville in 1888). 'Though not an impressionist, Allan did share with his compatriots a taste for plein-air painting and a French orientation.'Scott Wilcox and Christopher Newall, Victorian Landscape Watercolors (New York: Hudson Hills Press, 1992), p. 48. The Queen's Jubilee Procession of 1887 is praised by Mrs Bell for 'the artist's bold brush-work, \u2026 and his various Dutch scenes, notably his Lowlands of Holland [of c.1889], are perhaps especially remarkable for increased freedom of handling, and for the nearest approach made by their gifted author to what may be called the earlier phase of Impressionism.'Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 236.The Dundee Courier also noted that The Lowlands of Holland at the Glasgow Institute in 1890 was 'a very distinct advance'.Dundee Courier, 5 February 1890. Allan maintained an individualistic approach to his art, aligning himself neither with British Impressionists nor with the Glasgow School, which was 'fast coming to be recognised as a new force and power, especially in the landscape art of the country'.The Scotsman, 13 December 1890. The 'Glasgow School' \u2013 retrospectively known as the 'Glasgow Boys' \u2013 was a diverse grouping of artists including James Paterson (1854\u20131932), William York Macgregor (1855\u20131923), James Guthrie (1859\u20131930), John Lavery (1856\u20131941) and Thomas Millie Dow (1848\u20131919). Mrs. Bell's International Studio article draws on conversations with Allan in which he makes it clear that he 'was not, as is so often taken for granted, a member of the Glasgow School'.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 229. In 1889 he was awarded a silver medal at the Exposition Universelle in Paris.The Catalogue of the Fifth Annual Exhibition at the Carnegie Institute, (Pittsburgh: Carnegie Institute, 1900). == Young India == The Ghats at Benares (detail), 1891 'Mr R.W. Allan and his sketching- cart', published in Young India in 1891 Inspired perhaps by the success of Arthur Melville's watercolour paintings of oriental subjects, in the winter of 1890\u201391 Allan embarked on a long trip to India with his friend the politician and temperance advocate William Sproston Caine, who was undertaking a political tour of that country. Allan had been invited to contribute watercolour illustrations for a publication that would be entitled 'Young India'.W. S. Caine, Young India: A Series of Letters Written for the Pall Mall Gazette during a Political Tour in India in the Winter of 1890-91 ( London: Pall Mall Gazette, 1891). On return, he exhibited the watercolours Service in a Sikh Temple, The Street in Delhi, The Water Carriers of Gwalior and Oudeypore at the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours winter exhibition. The Glasgow Herald considered that 'Mr. Robert W. Allan's work is as strong as it has ever been, and more brilliant in colour \u2026 there is nothing more to be said than that even Mr Allan has never done better work.'Glasgow Herald, 28 November 1891. Oudeypore was worked up as an oil painting and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1892. By this time Allan was living at 2 Spenser Street, Victoria. == Consolidating his reputation == Rosehearty, Aberdeenshire, water- colour painting c.1905 Paris water-colour painting 1905 Through the Royal Anglo-Australian Society of Artists, a watercolour Arriving from the Ferry was purchased for the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney in 1890, and in the same year an oil painting Kirkwall, Orkney was purchased by public subscription for Dunedin Public Art Gallery in New Zealand. Critics were now more accepting of his 'vivid modernity of style', despite its seeming 'oddly out of place in Pall Mall East. Of the excellence of his drawings, however, there can be no possible shadow of doubt. Best of them all, perhaps, is his Montrose (No. 22), a most convincing view of what one feels that cold, grey Scottish town must be like on a hopelessly sloppy day.'Truth, 25 April 1895. The following year he was made a full member of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours.Simon Fenwick and Greg Smith (eds.), The Business of Watercolour: A Guide to the Archives of the Royal Watercolour Society (Aldershot: Ashgate, 1997). Allan seems to have now been equally at home with oil painting, and each year for the next three decades (with few exceptions) he would have at least one oil painting selected for the Royal Academy summer exhibition. The subjects were largely of the Aberdeenshire coast, such as Ford between North Uist and Benbecula exhibited at the RA in 1894 and purchased four years later by Aberdeen Corporation for \u00a3600.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 237; Fraserburgh Herald and Northern Counties Advertiser, 30 March 1909. In 1900 All Hands on Deck received an 'honourable mention' at the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh,The Catalogue of the Fifth Annual Exhibition at the Carnegie Institute, (Pittsburgh: Carnegie Institute, 1900). and Allan was then invited to serve on the jury for a future Carnegie Institute exhibition.The Scotsman, 22 September 1904. == An elder statesman == Temple at Nikko, Japan oil painting from 1907 Yasaka Pagoda, Kyoto watercolour, 1907 In his fifties, Allan became something of an elder statesman within the London art scene. He had moved to 62 Buckingham Gate, Westminster,Ancestry.com, 1901 England census: address, 62 Buckingham Gate, Westminster; age, 49; profession, 'Artist Sculpt[or]' (sic). and received the accolade of two high-profile articles in International Studio magazine.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', pp. 229\u201337, and T. Martin Wood, 'Robert W. Allan's Recent Paintings and Drawings', International Studio, vol. 37, no. 146 (April 1909), pp. 89\u2013100. He became vice-president of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1908, and the society seems to have commissioned his portrait from Dorothea Landau (1881\u20131941).The portrait is owned by the Royal Watercolour Society. In 1910 he was vice-president of the Royal British Colonial Society of Artists.The Times, 29 April 1910. The president of the society was William Ayerst Ingram (1855\u20131913) \u2013 also born in Glasgow and also known as a painter of marine subjects. He had helped form the society in 1885: it started under the name the Anglo-Australian Society of Artists. He also played a prominent role in the annual landscape exhibitions of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours.The Queen, 9 January 1904: Robert W. Allan sends 'nine canvases [sic]'. He maintained his extensive travel itinerary, including a most productive visit to Japan in 1907. Five watercolours from this visit were included in the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours exhibition in November 1907, when it was declared that Yameiman Gate, Nikko was 'fittingly placed as a centrepiece, for its merit justifies this.'Fraserburgh Herald and Northern Counties Advertiser, 19 November 1907. == A late marriage == It would no doubt have been a talking point among his colleagues and friends that in January 1911,The Sun (NY) of 19 January 1911 says, 'London, Jan. 18. Georgiana, daughter of F. P. Trumbull of Ithaca, N.Y., was married here to-day to Robert Allan.' at the age of 59, Allan married a young American woman, Georgiana Emily Trumbull, aged 27,Her passport application to the American Embassy in London on 22 October 1908 gives Georgiana's date of birth as 2 April 1884, and birthplace as Ithaca, New York State. The 1910 Ithaca census gives her father as Frederick Trumbull, high-school attendance officer, and her mother, Elizabeth, is stated as being Canadian (English), with parents born in Scotland. from Ithaca, New York State. It seems likely that the couple had met while Georgiana was on an extensive cultural tour of Europe between 1907 and 1910.Georgiana Trumbull left America on 4 August 1907 with two women from Ithaca. \u2018Mrs. Mary Adsitt, Mrs. Slater and Miss Trumbull are now enjoying a visit in Paris\u2019 \u2013 Ithaca Daily Journal, 5 December 1907. On 22 October 1908 Georgiana applied to the American Embassy in London for a passport to travel to Turkey via Paris \u2013 presumably on the Orient Express. Mrs Adsitt returned to the USA earlier than Georgiana, possibly because of illness: theIthaca Daily Journal of 13 September 1909 states that \u2018Mrs. Mary A. Adsitt, manager of the Wyckoff Phonographic Institute \u2026 is recuperating at the Trumbull farm, near Jacksonville.\u2019 Georgiana returned to America in January 1910, initially visiting her brother in Boston \u2013 Ithaca Daily Journal, 19 January 1910. The Ithaca Daily Journal of 19 January 1910 noted, \u2018She has been away for about two years and a half and has visited nearly every country on the continent and in England.' She returned to her parents' home, but her plans to become a kindergarten teacher in Ithaca Ithaca, New York, City Directory, 1909. were put aside, and in the following January she married Robert Allan in London and the couple were living at Buckingham Gate. In 1911\u201312 Allan embarked on an extensive tour that took in North Africa,Gazetteer for Scotland: Robert Weir Allan. DamascusA watercolour dated 1911 of this location. and other Middle Eastern destinations.An undated watercolour of Jerusalem may have been from this time. Given Georgiana's interest in foreign travel, this may been planned as a honeymoon trip. Perhaps preparing the ground for a forthcoming visit to his new in-laws, an illustrated article on Robert Allan\u2019s paintings, with an accompanying specially commissioned portrait of the artist, appeared in the Christian Science Monitor, published in Boston, in early 1913.'Distinction and Wide Variety in Robert Weir Allan's Paintings', Christian Science Monitor, 4 January 1913. Boston was the site of the mother church of the Christian Science movement, and an article by Caroline Fraser in The Guardian of 6 August 2019 states that 1911 saw the peak of the movement in London. It is possible that Georgiana's brother, who lived in Boston, had connections with the Christian Science Monitor and had somehow facilitated the article's publication. Later in Britain there were one-man shows of his work in Glasgow and Birmingham.At J. B. Bennett & Sons, Glasgow (Dundee Courier, 21 November 1913), and at the Graves Gallery Birmingham (Birmingham Daily Post, 13 June 1914). Despite the outbreak of the First World War, a visit to America \u2013 presumably to visit Georgiana's family \u2013 went ahead. Records show Robert and Georgiana Allan returning from New York to Liverpool on the Cunard luxury liner RMS Lusitania on 6 March 1915. This would be its last completed return journey to the UK, as it was sunk by a German U-boat on 7 May 1915.Ancestry.co.uk, passenger lists. == The inter-war years == North-Eastern Gale, oil painting, date unknown After the war, paintings evidence visits to France, Holland, Italy and Greece,The Acropolis, Athens (oil), 1919 Royal Academy. and there were further visits to the USA. The Syracuse Journal of 1 November 1920 notes that 'Robert Weir Allan, the eminent British artist, is spending a few days in the city at the home of [Georgiana's brother] Charles D. Trumbull. Mr. Allan and his wife have been in this country for some months visiting the West and are about to return to their home in London, England.' Allan continued exhibiting at the Royal Academy throughout the 1920s and even in the 1930s when in his eighties. The pictures shown were largely coastal views of the Aberdeenshire area that he knew so well, and it seems less likely that he would have been working plein-air. One of his most powerful later oil paintings, North-Easter Gale, effectively reduces the composition to sea and sky. The only record of a portrait painting by Allan is a self-portrait presented by the artist in 1935 to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. The last work Allan exhibited at the RA was in 1935; it had a characteristic and fitting title \u2013 Home from the Sea. Although passenger lists show the Allans travelling together as a couple as late as 1929,Ancestry.co.uk, passenger lists New York\u2013Southampton, 23 January 1929. by the mid-1930s the couple seem to have separated. In June 1936 Georgiana travelled from New York to London (via Liverpool) and stayed in a hotel in Pall Mall. The USA is given as her country of permanent residence.Ancestry.co.uk, UK and Ireland, incoming passenger lists, 1878\u20131960. She was still in London the following year, when she attended a garden party in St James's Square held by the Royal Institute of International Affairs.The Times, 26 May 1937. It is possible that her presence in London then was required for a pending divorce,There seems to be no online record of the Allans' divorce, although 1937 saw a relaxing of UK divorce laws with the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937 making unlawful desertion for two years or more, cruelty, and incurable insanity all grounds upon which a divorce could be granted. as on 11 August 1941 she remarried in Maine, USA, under her maiden name, Georgiana Trumbull.Ancestry.com, Maine, Marriage Index, 1892\u20131996. Her second husband, Dutch-born Hendrik Jan De Lange (1886\u20131961), was a prominent Christian Scientist who had been living in America since the mid-1930s.15 December 1936 Petition of Naturalization. == Legacy == Figures on the steps of the Masjid Wazir Khan Lahore watercolour, 1891 The Westminster area, where Allan lived with a housekeeper and an unpaid servant, was subject to heavy bombing in the early years of the Second World War. The \u20181939 Register\u2019 shows a shop assistant and a worker from a biscuit factory sharing his accommodation at Buckingham Gate. These may have been people relocated in response to the military situation.Ancestry.com, 1939 England and Wales Register. On the night of 27 May 1942 Allan collapsed in his London home and was taken to Westminster Hospital, where he was found to be deadThe Scotsman, 29 May 1942, \u2013 he was 90 years of age. His estate was worth nearly \u00a35,000 (equivalent to about \u00a3237,000 in 2019) and was left in the hands of a solicitor.England and Wales National Probate calendar: Robert Weir Allan of 62 Buckingham Gate died 27 May 1942 at Westminster Hospital, London.

He bequeathed three oil paintings to Glasgow Museums \u2013 their collection already included the oil painting of Funeral of Thomas Carlyle, gifted by Allan in 1911, and they had purchased Sheltered from the Stormy Sea in 1904.
