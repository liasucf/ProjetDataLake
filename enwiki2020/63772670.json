He was nicknamed the \"Big Papa\" or \"King Eagle\" by his fan base \"Gulapanatics\" or \"Daigonatics\" for his signature dance move. == Personal life == Gulapa was raised by his grandparents as a child. When his grandparents died, his life became traumatic and began to act tyrannically and oppressively. When he was old enough, he visited night bars and started performing as a bar dancer. According to him, his struggle with financial issues pushed him to pursue erotic dancing. He also took different jobs aside from being a performer. He earned the moniker \"Master Daigo\" from Lightning Legend: Daigo no Daibouken on PlayStation. The DJ at the bar where he worked added the titular \"Master\" as recognition for his excellence at performing and showmanship. == Filmography == ===Television=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" background: #f9f9f9 |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\" ! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Television |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\" |- !
