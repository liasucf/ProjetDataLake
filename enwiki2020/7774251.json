The channel replaced MTV Nordic on September 18, 2005. ==History== * MTV Sweden launched in September 2005 along with MTV Finland and MTV Norway. Before the start of country-specific channels, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland had been served by a common channel called MTV Nordic, launched on June 5, 1998 which replaced the MTV Europe feed. * MTV Sweden's offices are based at Viacom International Media Networks' Nordic offices in Stockholm.http://www.mtvnetworks.se/ The channel is broadcast from the Viacom International Media Networks Europe headquarters in London, partly because of the strict laws on television advertising in Sweden (interrupting programmes for commercials was illegal until 2002). *During the days of MTV Nordic, languages other than English were rarely spoken on MTV in Sweden. With the start of MTV Sweden, several Swedish language programmes were produced for example MTV News in Swedish and Off Beat. *Since the mid-2000s MTV Sweden shares a similar schedule to its other European counterparts featuring mainly reality based content from MTV US and very few music videos. ==Availability== *At its launch MTV Sweden was available on all major digital television providers. Most cable networks carry the channel in their basic packages. It is available on satellite from Canal Digital and Viasat. In 2001, the government granted MTV a license to broadcast on the terrestrial network on the Boxer platform. Since 2006, the overnight programming between 2 and 7 a.m. has been replaced by music videos from VH1 Europe in the terrestrial network. *In 2010, MTV Networks International signed a new agreement with Com Hem which meant that MTV would be removed from Com Hem's analogue package, losing a sizeable chunk of its reach. MTV is removed from the analogue network on January 15, 2011.http://www.mtv.se/info/se-pa-mtv ==Former local shows== * MTV Beat (September 2007 - November 2007) * MTV Fuzz (September 2007 - November 2007) * MTV Phaser (September 2007 - November 2007) * MTV Chorus (September 2007 - November 2007) * Celsius, a daily top 10 chart (2004\u20132006) * Hej, kom och hj\u00e4lp mig () (2006\u20132007) * Str\u00f6ssel (Hundreds and thousands) (2006\u20132007) * Mycket mer \u00e4n m\u00fcsli (Much more than muesli) (2006\u20132007) == References == == External links == * * MTV Sweden Graphics * MTV Networks AB B2B Website Category:MTV channels Category:Television channels and stations established in 2005 Category:Television channels in Sweden Category:2005 establishments in Sweden Category:Music organizations based in Sweden Category:Television channel articles with incorrect naming style ",
