    "text": "A cattle wagon is an everyday expression for a railway wagon designed to carry livestock. The American equivalent is called a stock car. A cattle wagon is one type of covered goods wagon, although cattle have also been transported in open goods wagons. Wagons with special bays or stalls were only used for the transport of racing horses whilst small livestock, such as sheep, goats, poultry and rabbits were transported in livestock wagons with slatted sides and/or hutches. Originally high-sided wagons were also used to move cattle as well as horses and pigs. For the transport of military horses in goods wagons, tethering rings were fitted. The transportation of large and small animals required special fittings \u2013 air vents, means of tethering, drinking facilities and viewing ports \u2013 in order to avoid quantitative and qualitative losses. Even troops were transported in covered goods wagons. ==Use for deportation== Original carriage at the Judenrampe platform, Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum Dead Jews being removed from cattle trucks in Romania in World War II People being deported in stock cars in World War II Cattle wagon on the Holocaust train would transport Jews to concentration camps; many were unaware of their awaiting fate. Given their dimensions and features, cattle wagons have been used as vehicles for forced mass transfer and deportation of people. Holocaust trains were railway transports run by the Deutsche Reichsbahn national railway system under the strict supervision of the German Nazis and their allies, for the purpose of forcible deportation of the Jews, as well as other victims of the Holocaust, to the German Nazi concentration, forced labour, and extermination camps. Cattle wagons were used for forced settlement and population transfer in the Soviet Union in the mid-20th century. Following the end of World War II in Europe, ethnic Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia in cattle wagons. == See also == * Livestock trailer * Stock car (rail) == References == Category:Freight rolling stock ",
