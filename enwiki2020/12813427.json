    "text": "Chloramine-T is the organic compound with the formula CH3C6H4SO2NClNa. Both the anhydrous salt and its trihydrate are known. Both are white powders. Chloramine-T is used as a reagent in organic synthesis. ==Reactions== Chloramine-T contains active (electrophilic) chlorine. Its reactivity is similar to that of sodium hypochlorite. Aqueous solutions of chloramine-T are slightly basic (pH typically 8.5). The pKa of the closely related N-chlorophenylsulfonamide C6H5SO2NCl(H) is 9.5. It is prepared by oxidation of toluenesulfonamide with sodium hypochlorite, with the latter being produced in situ from sodium hydroxide and chlorine (Cl2): 450px ==Uses== ===Reagent in amidohydroxylation=== The Sharpless oxyamination converts an alkene to a vicinal amino alcohol. A common source of the amido component of this reaction is chloramine-T.Bodkin, J. A.; McLeod, M. D. J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1, 2002, 2733\u20132746. () Vicinal amino-alcohols are important products in organic synthesis and recurring pharmacophores in drug discovery. The Sharpless oxyamination ===Oxidant=== Chloramine-T is a strong oxidant. It oxidizes hydrogen sulfide to sulfur and mustard gas to yield a harmless crystalline sulfimide. It converts iodide to iodine monochloride (ICl). ICl rapidly undergoes electrophilic substitution predominantly with activated aromatic rings, such as those of the amino acid tyrosine. Thus, chloramine-T is used to incorporate iodine into peptides and proteins. Chloramine-T together with iodogen or lactoperoxidase is commonly used for labeling peptides and proteins with radioiodine isotopes. ==Certifications== *EN 1276 Bactericidal * EN 13713 Bactericidal * EN 14675 Virucidal * EN 14476 Virucidal Norovirus * EN 1650 Fungicidal * EN 13704 Sporicidal Clostridium difficile ==References== ==External links== * * Chemicalland21.com: Chloramine T (Tosylchloramide sodium) * InChem.org: Chloramine T * Category:Antiseptics Category:Pesticides Category:Sulfonamides Category:Organochlorides Category:Organic sodium salts Category:p-Tosyl compounds Category:Nitrogen\u2013halogen compounds ",
