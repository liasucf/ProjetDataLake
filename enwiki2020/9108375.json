    "text": "Namul () refers to either a variety of edible grass or leaves or seasoned herbal dishes made of them. Wild greens are called san-namul (, \"mountain namul\"), and spring vegetables are called bom-namul (, \"spring namul\"). On the day of Daeboreum, the first full moon of the year, Koreans eat boreum-namul (, \"full moon namul\") with five-grain rice. It is believed that boreum namuls eaten in winter help one to withstand the heat of the summer to come. == Preparation and serving == bap (cooked rice), guk (soup), kimchi, pyeonyuk (meat slices), and three namul banchans (spinach namul, brakenfern namul, and balloon flower root namul) For namul as a dish, virtually any type of vegetable, herb, or green can be used, and the ingredient includes roots, leaves, stems, seeds, sprouts, petals, and fruits. Some seaweeds and mushrooms, and even animal products such as beef tendons are also made into namuls. Although in most cases the vegetables (and non-vegetable namul ingredients) are blanched before being seasoned, the method of preparation can also vary; they may be served fresh (raw), boiled, fried, saut\u00e9ed, fermented, dried, or steamed. Namul can be seasoned with salt, vinegar, sesame oil and perilla oil, regular soy sauce and soup soy sauce, doenjang (soybean paste), gochujang, and many other spices and condiments. Namul are typically served as banchan (\ubc18\ucc2c, a side dish accompanying the staples, usually bap). It is possible to have more than one type of namul served as a banchan at a single meal. Each namul dish may named depending on the main ingredients and the methods of preparation. For example, a seasoned chamnamul dish is most likely called chamnamulmuchim (literally \"seasoned chamnamul\"), since the name of the vegetable already contains the word \"namul\" in it. A namul dish made of raw radish is called musaengchae (\"\ubb34\uc0dd\ucc44, seasoned raw radish\"), since it is usually the namul dish made with cooked radish that is called munamul (\"radish namul\"). == Main ingredients of namul == === Vegetables === === Seaweeds === === Mushrooms === === Others === ==Gallery== File:Bangpung (Peucedanum japonicum).jpg|bangpung-namul File:Chamnamul muchim (Pimpinella brachycarpa).jpg|Chamnamul File:Korean cuisine-Namul-06.jpg|Chwinamul File:Korean cuisine-Namul-03.jpg|Goguma-sun-namul File:Gondre.jpg|Gondre-namul File:Gosari.jpg|Gosari-namul File:Kongnamul muchim (soybean sprouts).jpg|Kongnamul File:Miyeokmuchim.jpg|Miyeok-namul File:Paraemuchim (seasoned parae) (Monostroma nitidum).jpg|Parae-namul File:Korean cuisine- Pyogo namul-01.jpg|Pyogo-namul File:Sigeumchinamul (seasoned spinach side dish).jpg|Sigeumchi-namul File:Korean cuisine-Sukjunamul-01.jpg|Sukjunamul File:Sebalnamul (Spergularia marina).jpg|Sebalnamul File:Totmuchim (tot with tofu and doenjang).jpg|Tot-namul File:Doraji-namul.jpg|Doraji-namul File:Ssukgat-namul.jpg|Ssukgat-namul File:Siraegi-namul.jpg|Siraegi-namul File:Korean food-Bibim ssambap ingredient-01.jpg|Various namuls for bibimbap File:Korea-Sokcho-Sanchae jeongsik-Namul-01.jpg|Sanchae table d'h\u00f4te == See also == * Sansai * Saag ==References== ==External links== *Life in Korea: Korean seasoned vegetables Category:Korean cuisine ",
