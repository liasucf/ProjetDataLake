David lives with his mother and makes one annual visit to see his father Cal, an avid outdoorsman. David is most used to the city life and has a firm attachment to his smartphone, with which he incessantly plays games and texts his mom. Father and son have a rather estranged relationship. David barely looks up from his phone when his dad arrives at the airport to pick him up. Neither seems excited to see the other and Cal makes it clear that he wants David to participate in outdoor activities. He's stern with David, but they each handle the other with restraint. David would rather not go pheasant-hunting but agrees to join his old man. Cal takes it one step further and asks him if he'd like to go on a moose-hunting expedition in the snow-peaked mountains. David is reluctant but also feels obligated to make the trek. High up in the mountains Cal is accidentally shot in the leg and it is up to David to get them both out. ==Cast== * Matt Bomer as Cal ** Alex Neustaedter as Young Cal * Bill Pullman as Clyde * Chaske Spencer as Sun Bear * Josh Wiggins as David * Lily Gladstone as Lila ==Critical reception== On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 49 reviews, and an average rating of 7.1/10.
