    "text": "Alison Monica Halford (born 8 May 1940) is a former senior police officer who became a politician. She was Labour member of the National Assembly for Wales, representing the Delyn constituency, between 1999 and 2003. In 2006 she transferred allegiance to the Conservative Party and as of 2007 advises the Conservatives on home affairs. ==Early life== Halford was born in Norwich on 8 May 1940. She attended a Catholic grammar school. She served for three years in the Women's Royal Air Force, before moving to London to train as a dental hygienist. ==Police career== In 1962, Halford joined the Metropolitan Police. She rose rapidly in the police. She became a Detective Constable soon after completing her probation, joined a fast track promotion scheme, and was promoted to Inspector in 1967. She reached the rank of Chief Superintendent in the Metropolitan Police, and was the first woman in the country to command a police division, taking command of Tottenham Court Road police station. In 1983, she became Assistant Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, the first woman to hold that rank in British police history and the first woman outside the Metropolitan Police to hold Chief Officer rank. She claimed to have faced sexual discrimination in her new post, however, and did not get on well with Chief Constable Kenneth Oxford. Despite repeated attempts she failed to win further promotion, after which she brought a sexual discrimination claim. The claim was withdrawn following a settlement between the two parties. She retired in 1992. ==Political career== On 10 April 2006 she announced that she was joining the Conservatives, having grown increasingly disillusioned with the Labour Party. She especially cited the appointment of Peter Mandelson as a European Commissioner. She became an adviser to the Conservative Party and their Shadow Secretary of State for Wales on home affairs. In 2012 she was re- elected as a Conservative County Councillor for Flintshire County Council and as a Conservative Community Councillor for Hawarden Community Council. ==Personal life== In 1997, she alleged that her telephones had been tapped, resulting in her winning a case at the European Court of Human Rights against the Home Secretary. ==Publications== Halford then wrote a book about her experiences, entitled No Way Up the Greasy Pole. Halford launched her book 'Leeks from the Backbenches' at the Welsh Assembly on 6 November 2007. ==References== ==External links== * Alison's musings - personal blog * BBC biography of Alison Halford Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:Welsh Labour Members of Senedd Cymru \u2013 Welsh Parliament Category:Conservative Party (UK) politicians Category:Members of Flintshire County Council Category:British police chief officers Category:British women police officers Category:Women Metropolitan Police officers Category:Women Merseyside Police officers Category:Wales AMs 1999\u20132003 Category:Women's Royal Air Force airwomen Category:Metropolitan Police officers ",
