Commission for Women and meant to honor the achievements of women from the District of Columbia. Eight women were inducted into the hall of fame in its first year, 1988. Women were chosen for making \"significant contributions in the fields of community and public service, education, health or labor.\" The hall of fame can be seen in the Dr. Mildred E. Gibbs lecture hall at the Charles Sumner School. ==List of inductees== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\" |+D.C.
