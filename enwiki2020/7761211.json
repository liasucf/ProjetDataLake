    "text": "is a Japanese stir fry dish consisting of thick, smooth, white udon noodles mixed with a soy based sauce, meat (usually pork), and vegetables. It is similar to yakisoba, which involves a similar stir fry technique using soba noodles. Yaki udon is relatively simple to make, and popular as a staple of Japan's izakaya, or pubs, eaten frequently as a late night snack. It originated in Kokura, Fukuoka Prefecture in southern Japan after the Pacific War. The widely accepted story of how the dish was created dates back to just after World War II, when food was scarce. The owner of the noodle restaurant Darumado used udon noodles in popular yakisoba preparations because the proper noodles were not available. ==See also== * Yakisoba ==References== ==External links== *Kokura Yakiudon Kenkyujo * Category:Udon Category:Fried noodles Category:Japanese noodle dishes ",
