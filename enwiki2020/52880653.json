The \u0106uk switched-mode DC-to-DC voltage converter is named after Slobodan \u0106uk. ==Biography== For over 20 years, he was a full-time Professor of Electrical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology until January 1, 2000.Slobodan \u0106uk; EE Academic Genealogy Project; California Institute of Technology. In 1979, Slobodan founded TESLAco, which is currently located in Laguna Niguel, California. It had a charter to apply basic research results developed at Caltech for practical commercial and military designs. Over 30 patents have Slobodan \u0106uk's name on them. ==Personal life== Non-isolated switching topologies Slobodan's parents are Milojko and Julijana \u0106uk. He is bilingual, American English and Serbian. On February 29, 1972, Slobodan immigrated from Belgrade, Yugoslavia to United States and was sponsored by NASA. Slobodan received a Dipl.Ing. from University of Belgrade in 1970, a M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Santa Clara University in 1974; and a Ph.D. in Power Electronics from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1977.Slobodan \u0106uk; Franklin Institute Awards; The Franklin Institute. ==Bibliography== ===Books=== * Power Electronics, Vol. 5: Power Electronics: A New Beginning; \u0106uk Slobodan; announced but not released yet. * Power Electronics, Vol. 4: State-Space Averaging and \u0106uk Converters; \u0106uk Slobodan; 378 pages; 2016; . * Power Electronics, Vol. 3: Advanced Topics and Designs; \u0106uk Slobodan; 360 pages; 2015; . * Power Electronics, Vol. 2: Modeling, Analysis, and Measurements; \u0106uk Slobodan; 272 pages; 2015; . * Power Electronics, Vol. 1: Topologies, Magnetics, and Control; \u0106uk Slobodan; 270 pages; 2015; . ===Books (CoAuthor)=== * Advances in Switched-Mode Power Conversion, Vol. 3: ?; \u0106uk Slobodan and R.D.
