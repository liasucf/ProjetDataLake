    "text": "Hampstead is a London Underground station in Hampstead, North London. The station is on the Edgware branch of the Northern line, between Golders Green and Belsize Park stations, and is the northernmost subterranean station on the branch. The station is on the boundary between Travelcard Zone 2 and Zone 3. Designed by architect Leslie Green, the station was opened on 22 June 1907 by the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway. Located at the junction of Heath Street and Hampstead High Street, the name Heath Street was proposed for the station before opening: the original tiled station signs on the platform walls still read Heath Street. Because Hampstead is on a steep hill, the station platforms are the deepest on the London Underground network, at below ground level. It also has the deepest lift shaft on the Underground at and houses high-speed lifts. They were previously Otis lifts, but were modernised by the Wadsworth Lift Company,Wadsworth Lift Company and again in 2014 by Accord. To the north, between Hampstead and Golders Green stations, is the uncompleted North End or Bull & Bush station. London Overground's Hampstead Heath station on the North London Line is a 10\u201315 minute walk east. The station is north-northwest of Charing Cross as the crow flies. Tiling on the southbound platform, showing the original proposed name, \"Heath Street\" ==Connections== London Buses routes 46 and 268, schools service 603 and night bus N5 serve the station. == References == ==External links== * Station exterior, 1925 Category:Northern line stations Category:Tube stations in the London Borough of Camden Category:Former Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1907 Category:Buildings and structures in Hampstead Category:Leslie Green railway stations Category:London Underground Night Tube stations Category:Railway stations located underground in the United Kingdom ",
