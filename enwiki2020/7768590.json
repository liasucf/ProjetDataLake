The name was changed in 1917 to Rupert's Land College.BH History Sir James Aikins gave his home, known as Aikins House, to the United Church of Canada upon his death in 1929. In his will, he requested it be used as a girls' school and bestowed further funding to be used to that end. The school was named Riverbend School and opened in September 1929 at Balmoral Hall's present site. In 1950, due to declining enrollment at both schools, Rupert's Land College amalgamated with the Riverbend School at its site on Westminster Avenue. The school was christened Balmoral Hall School, after Balmoral Castle, and classes began in September 1950. The two schools' mottos, Ad Meliora, or \"To Better Things,\" and Alta Petens, \"Seeking New Heights,\" were combined to form the school's new motto, Meliora Petens, which meant \"Seeking Better Things.\" In 1955, the Senior School Wing was opened, and in 1967 the school expanded to include the Richardson Building, which housed a new gymnasium as well as new science labs and facilities. Since then, there have been several other expansions which brought new computer and science laboratories and classrooms, as well as athletic facilities, a theatre and a communications technology centre. ==Curriculum== Balmoral Hall School adheres to the educational guidelines set out by the Province of Manitoba.
