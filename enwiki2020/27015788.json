Zerner earned his Ph.D. under Martin Gouterman at Harvard, working with the spectroscopy of porphyrins. He conceived and wrote a quantum chemistry program, known as BIGSPEC or ZINDO, for calculating electronic spectra of big molecules. In 1996 Zerner was diagnosed with liver cancer, and died on February 2, 2000, survived by his wife and two children. == External links == * * Category:1940 births Category:2000 deaths Category:University of Florida faculty Category:Theoretical chemists Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Computational chemists Category:University of Guelph faculty ",
