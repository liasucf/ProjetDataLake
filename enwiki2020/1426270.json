    "text": "The Yates Cup is a Canadian sports trophy, presented annually to the winner of the Ontario University Athletics football conference of U Sports. It is the oldest still-existing football trophy in North America, dating back to 1898 and surpassing both the Grey Cup and the Little Brown Jug in longevity. The Yates Cup was donated by Dr. Henry Brydges Yates of McGill University. Until 1971 it was awarded to the winner of the Senior Intercollegiate Football League regular season, with playoffs occurring only if there was a tie for first place, or the second-place team had defeated the first-place team in league play. Since 1971, it is awarded to the OUA football champion. The winner of the Yates Cup goes on to play in either the Uteck Bowl or the Mitchell Bowl, depending on annual rotations. Asteroid (12447) YatesCup is named after the Yates Cup. ==Trophy Recipients== *1898 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1899 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1900 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1901 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1902 - McGill Redmen *1903 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1904 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1905 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1906 - McGill Redmen *1907 - Ottawa Gee-Gees *1908 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1909 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1910 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1911 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1912 - McGill Redmen *1913 - McGill Redmen *1914 - Toronto Varsity Blues From 1915 to 1918, the trophy was not presented due to World War I. *1919 - McGill Redmen *1920 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1921 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1922 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1923 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1924 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1925 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1926 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1927 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1928 - McGill Redmen *1929 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1930 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1931 - Western Mustangs *1932 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1933 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1934 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1935 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1936 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1937 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1938 - McGill Redmen *1939 - Western Mustangs From 1940 to 1945, the trophy was not presented due to World War II. *1946 - Western Mustangs *1947 - Western Mustangs *1948 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1949 - Western Mustangs *1950 - Western Mustangs *1951 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1952 - Western Mustangs *1953 - Western Mustangs *1954 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1955 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1956 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1957 - Western Mustangs *1958 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1959 - Western Mustangs *1960 - McGill Redmen *1961 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1962 - McGill Redmen *1963 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1964 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1965 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1966 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1967 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1968 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1969 - McGill Redmen *1970 - Queen's Golden Gaels *1971 - Western Mustangs *1972 - Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks *1973 - Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks From 1974 to 1978, due to a change in conference structure, the Yates Cup was presented to both an Eastern Division and a Western Division winner. *1974 - Toronto Varsity Blues and Western Mustangs *1975 - Ottawa Gee-Gees and Windsor Lancers *1976 - Ottawa Gee-Gees and Western Mustangs *1977 - Queen's Golden Gaels and Western Mustangs *1978 - Queen's Golden Gaels and Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks In 1979 the Eastern and Western Division champions played each other in a Vanier Cup semi-final game, which also determined the Yates Cup championship. *1979 - Western Mustangs In 1980, the Cup returned to a single winner when the Eastern Division formed the independent OQIFC. *1980 - Western Mustangs *1981 - Western Mustangs *1982 - Western Mustangs *1983 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1984 - Guelph Gryphons *1985 - Western Mustangs *1986 - Western Mustangs *1987 - Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks *1988 - Western Mustangs *1989 - Western Mustangs *1990 - Western Mustangs *1991 - Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks *1992 - Guelph Gryphons *1993 - Toronto Varsity Blues *1994 - Western Mustangs *1995 - Western Mustangs *1996 - Guelph Gryphons *1997 - Waterloo Warriors *1998 - Western Mustangs *1999 - Waterloo Warriors *2000 - McMaster Marauders *2001 - McMaster Marauders *2002 - McMaster Marauders *2003 - McMaster Marauders *2004 - Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks *2005 - Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks *2006 - Ottawa Gee-Gees *2007 - Western Mustangs *2008 - Western Mustangs *2009 - Queen's Golden Gaels *2010 - Western Mustangs *2011 - McMaster Marauders *2012 - McMaster Marauders *2013 - Western Mustangs *2014 - McMaster Marauders *2015 - Guelph Gryphons *2016 - Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks *2017 - Western Mustangs *2018 - Western Mustangs *2019 - McMaster Marauders ==Yates Cup Games== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
