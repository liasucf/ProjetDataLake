    "text": "The Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station () is an ecological station (ESEC) in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. It fully protects a well-preserved area of Atlantic Forest and associated ecosystems along the coastal plain and mountains of the south of the state, home to endangered species of mammals and birds. There is some threat from illegal gathering of heart of palm. ==Location== The Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station (ESEC) is divided between the municipalities of Iguape (86.43%), Itariri (3.62%), Miracatu (5.59%), Peru\u00edbe (4.19%) and Pedro de Toledo (0.17%) in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. It covers an area of . The ESEC covers part of the coastal plain and mountains between Ilha Comprida to the southwest and Peru\u00edbe to the east. It is east of the SP-322 highway and south of the BR-116 - BR-101 highway. The Despraiado Sustainable Development Reserve extends into the northwest part of the ESEC. The Prelado State Park on the coast adjoins the south part of the ESEC. The east of the park adjoins the Barra do Una Sustainable Development Reserve, Ilha do Ameixal Area of Relevant Ecological Interest and Itingu\u00e7u State Park. The Ilhas do Abrigo e Guararitama Wildlife Refuge is offshore to the east of the ESEC. The coastal region of the ESEC contains the Serra da Jur\u00e9ia, an inselberg connected to the mainland by a sandy alluvial plain. It is bounded to the northeast by the Paranapu massif, part of the Serra dos Itatins. Altitudes range from above sea level. The Una do Prelado River is the largest in the region, fed by various streams from the north side of the Serra da Jur\u00e9ia and the Atlantic side of the Serra dos Itatins. The river is tidal for most of its length. The ESEC also holds the basins of the Rio Verde and the Guara\u00fa River. ==Environment== Average annual temperature ranges from . Average annual rainfall is . The climate is tropical humid with no dry season. At least of rain falls in the driest month. The main biome is Atlantic Forest, with ecosystems typically associated with it including pioneer formations of marine influence, beaches, salt marches, rocky shores and lowland and submontane rainforest. There are fields of open \"campo\" vegetation at the higher levels, and mangroves along the coast. It has one of the best preserved areas of Atlantic Forest in Brazil. Some of the beaches are sheltered between rock formations, while others have long stretches of fine sand. The ESEC provides a sanctuary for rare and threatened species of mammals and birds including spider monkey, jaguar, otter, capybara and tinamou. The ESEC is mainly threatened by illegal gathering of heart of palm, and to a lesser degree by illegal logging and hunting. ==History== Entrance to the ESEC The Serra dos Itatins State Forest Reserve, preserving a remnant of forest in the Serra dos ltatins, was created by decree 31.650 of 4 August 1958. Part of the Jur\u00e9ia area was chosen by NUCLEBR\u00c1S in the 1980s for the site of two nuclear power plants, Iguape 4 and Iguape 5. NUCLEBR\u00c1S withdrew from the area in 1985 and a campaign was launched to protect the forest. On 20 January 1986 governor Andr\u00e9 Franco Montoro created the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station by decree 24.646 with an area of about to ensure the integrity of the existing ecosystems. The ESEC incorporated the state forest reserve, lands declared vacant by the state and other lands along the coast of S\u00e3o Paulo state. The main objectives are preservation of nature and conducting scientific research. An area for the Guarani Indians was excluded, as was an area used for agrarian reform. The boundaries were redefined by law 5.649 of 28 April 1987. Law 12.406 of 13 December 2006 redefined the boundaries of the ESEC and reclassified the areas of the Despraiado Sustainable Development Reserve, Itingu\u00e7u State Park, Prelado State Park and Barra do Una Sustainable Development Reserve. It also excluded the areas to the north of the ESEC that were now part of the Banhados de Iguape Ecological Station. The decree created the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Mosaic of conservation units with about . It included the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station, Itingu\u00e7u and Prelado state parks, Despraiado and Barra do Una sustainable development reserves and the Ilhas do Abrigo e Guararitama Wildlife Refuge. This law was declared unconstitutional by the Procurer General of Justice of S\u00e3o Paulo on 11 September 2007. The mosaic was suspended in 2009. A motion was passed on 29 June 2012 repudiating the order for 300 families of traditional residents to withdraw from the ESEC. Law 14982 of 8 April 2013 again altered the limits of the ESEC, re- categorising some areas. These were the Itingu\u00e7u State Park, Prelado State Park, Barra do Una Sustainable Development Reserve and Despraiado Sustainable Development Reserve. The areas called Banhado Pequeno and Banhado Grande with in the Banhados de Iguape Ecological Station were incorporated in the ESEC, as was the area called Colinas Verdes (742 hectares). An area of to the north of the EXEC was excluded. The same law recreated the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Mosaic made up of the Jureia-Itatins ESEC, Itingu\u00e7u and Prelado state parks, Despraiado and Barra do Una sustainable development reserves and the Ilhas do Abrigo e Guararitama RVS. The ESEC as of 2016 had an area of . It is part of the Lagamar mosaic. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * * Category:1986 establishments in Brazil Category:Ecological stations of Brazil Category:Protected areas of S\u00e3o Paulo (state) Category:Protected areas established in 1986 ",
