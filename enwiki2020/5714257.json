    "text": "Madison Theatre is a historic theater in Peoria, Illinois, United States that opened on October 16, 1920, as a silent picture theatre. ==History== The building was commissioned by Dee Robinson and designed by Frederick J. Klein; it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 21, 1980. From 1996-2002, the Theatre was revived under the management of Jay Goldberg Events & Entertainment. Over 200 concerts took place during this period including live performances by George Winston, Ray Charles, The Smashing Pumpkins, Creed, REO Speedwagon, Fiona Apple, Todd Rundgren, moe., Govt' Mule, and Mudvayne. The building is located across the street from the Pere Marquette Hotel, also on the National Register. The theatre features an Italian Renaissance exterior and classical plasterwork on the interior walls and domed lobby ceilings. The lobby's terra-cotta plasterwork frames a triple- arched window above the marquee. The theatre closed in 2003. On June 4, 2016, firefighters were called to the theater around 10:30 P.M. for a significant fire that had broken out on or around the stage area. Officials stated the fire had been deliberately set, with damages estimated to be about $500,000. On July 27, 2016, the City of Peoria filed a condemnation notification for the building. City inspectors reexamined the building on August 25. As most necessary repairs were complete at that time, the city's assistant community development director stated, \"we'll likely dismiss the demolition case\" after additional minor repairs were made. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Peoria, Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in Peoria County, Illinois Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois ",
