    "text": "The Dodge Custom is a full-size car which was produced by Dodge in the United States from 1946 to early 1949. ==Overview== The D24 was introduced in 1946, as the top trim level in the Dodge range (bigger than Plymouth's counterparts Dodge D25).John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946\u20131975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 327 to 329 It differed from the basic Deluxe model only in terms of interior trim, seats, dual electric windshield wipers and chrome exterior beading around the windows. The Custom was offered in 4-door 6 passenger Sedan, 4-door 6 passenger Town Sedan, 4-door 7 passenger Sedan, 2-door Club Coupe and 2-door Convertible models. The 7 Passenger model rode on a 137.5 inch (3492.5 mm) wheelbase and all other models on 119.5 inches (3035.3 mm). All models were powered by a 230 cid inline six cylinder engine. A three-speed manual transmission was standard whilst a \"Fluid Drive\" option provided \"no metal-to metal contact between the power source and drive\". Changes for the 1947 and 1948 model years were minimal. From 1 December 1949 all units were considered 1949 models for registration purposes. The actual 1949 Dodge range was introduced in April 1949, with the Coronet name now used for the top trim level. Dodge D24 shared consumers with Pontiac Silverstreak, Oldsmobile Series 66, Studebaker Champion, Hudson Commodore and Nash Ambassador.
