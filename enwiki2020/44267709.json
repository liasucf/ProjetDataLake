The film debuted at the Brisbane Queer Film Festival on 25 May 2008. It is significant as it is Luke Mitchell's first starring role in a feature film. It is also the first gay-themed feature film shot in Brisbane, Australia. == Synopsis == In this quirky romance, Jeff and Peter live together, but their characters are worlds apart. Jeff is a messy, hippie musician, while Peter is a tidy, almost obsessive, office worker. == Plot == The movie opens with musician Jeff (played by Joss Mars) singing to a disinterested crowd in a bar. He goes home to his accountant boyfriend Peter (played by Luke Mitchell), with whom he struggles for connection. Peter gets up the next morning, has a steamy shower, then reminds Jeff he has a big gig that night. However Jeff is still asleep, having exotic dreams. At work, Peter deals with his crazy boss, Barry, but it all becomes too much for him and he leaves. Jeff's alarm goes off, but he sleeps right through it, with amusing consequences. Eventually Jeff wakes, has a bath, then rushes to go to the gig. As he leaves the apartment he locks the keys inside, so Jeff investigates creative ways of getting back inside for the car keys. Jeff arrives at the gig and smokes a joint with the stage manager. Back stage Peter finds Jeff, and they consider their problems. On stage, Jeff performs with his band and the Brisbane Lesbian and Gay Pride Choir. The crowd loves it. == Main cast == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Actor !!
