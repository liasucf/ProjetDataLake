    "text": "is the generic name of several people who lived in the Japanese archipelago during the J\u014dmon period. Today, most Japanese historians raise the possibility that the J\u014dmon were not a single homogeneous people but consisted of multiple groups. According to one study in September 2016, modern Japanese people have inherited on average about 13% of their genome from a J\u014dmon population represented by a specimen obtained from the Funadomari archaeological site on Rebun Island. The indigenous Ryukyuan and Ainu peoples have higher amounts of J\u014dmon ancestry than the Japanese do. A reconstructed model of a J\u014dmon man.

Exhibition in National Museum of Nature and Science.http://shinkan.kahaku.go.jp/kiosk/nihon_con/N2/KA2-1/japanese/TAB1/img/M01_g03_con.png (in Japanese) Several studies of numerous J\u014dmon skeletal remains that were excavated from various locations in the Japanese Archipelago allowed researchers to examine geographical differences during the J\u014dmon Period. However, very little geographical variation has been reported in many of these previous studies (e.g. Ogata, 1981; Dodo, 1982; Yamaguchi, 1982; Hanihara and Uchida, 1985; Mouri, 1988; Kondo, 1993, 1994). This has led researchers to regard the J\u014dmon as a morphologically homogeneous population. Tsunehiko Hanihara of the Department of Anatomy at Jichi Medical School suggests that the inhabitants of Aogashima and Okinawa, Minatogawa Man, the J\u014dmon and the modern Ainu are most likely directly descended from Proto-Mongoloids of Late Pleistocene Sundaland.Hanihara, Tsunehiko. (1990). Dental Anthropological Evidence of Affinities among the Oceania and the Pan-Pacific Populations: The Basic Populations in East Asia, II. Journal of the Anthropological Society of Nippon, 98(3). Page 242. Retrieved January 12, 2018, from link. Professor of anthropology, Akazawa Takeru (1996) at the International Research Center for Japanese Studies, Kyoto, suggests that the J\u014dmon were Paleo-Mongoloid.Takeru Akazawa and Em\u00f3ke J.E. Sathm\u00e5ry. Prehistoric Mongoloid dispersals. New York, Oxford University Press, 1996. A dental morphology study shows the J\u014dmon and Ainu have their own dental structure, but are generally closer to the Sundadont groups which is more common in Southeast Asia (Turner, 1990).Anthropological Science: Journal of the Anthropological Society of Nippon, Volume 101 Nevertheless, the Ainu dental morphology differ from Sundadont in that the dental size is smaller. Brace (1990) said that the J\u014dmon people share many physical characteristics with Caucasians, but form a separate genetic lineage than that of modern Europeans. A craniometric study by Brace et al. (2001) shows a closer morphological relation of the J\u014dmon and Ainu people to prehistoric and modern Europeans rather than to other contemporary East Asians. The study concludes that the J\u014dmon people are descendants of a population (dubbed \"Eurasians\" by Brace et al.) that moved into northern Eurasia (and also the Americas) in the Late Pleistocene, which significantly predates the expansion of the modern core population of East Asia. Other studies suggest that the J\u014dmon people were not a homogenous group and rather heterogeneous. According to Ishida et al. 2009, the majority of J\u014dmon appear similar to Bronze Age southern Siberians. There is evidence that the J\u014dmon retained features of Paleolithic populations from the western half of Eurasia (Europe), Central Asia and or southern Siberia. On the other hand Jomon groups on Kyushu, Shikoku and parts of southern Honshu show similarities to East-Asian (Mongoloid) phenotypes.\u4e0a\u7530\u6b63\u662d\u4ed6\u300e\u65e5\u672c\u53e4\u4ee3\u53f2\u306e\u8b0e\u518d\u8003\uff08\u30a8\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30c9\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb \u53e4\u4ee3\u65e5\u672c\u3092\u8003\u3048\u308b\uff11\uff09\u300f \u5b66\u751f\u793e 1983\u5e74 pp.52\u3088\u308a According to \u201cJ\u014dmon culture and the peopling of the Japanese archipelago\u201d by Schmidt and Seguchi (2014), the prehistoric J\u014dmon people descended from a paleolithic population of Siberia (Altai mountains region). Other cited scholars point out similarities between the J\u014dmon and various paleolithic and Bronze Age Siberians. Nevertheless there were likely multiple migrations into J\u014dmon-period Japan. == Languages == It is not known what language or languages were spoken during the J\u014dmon period. Suggested languages are: The Ainu language, Japonic languages, Tungusic languages, Austronesian languages, Paleosiberian languages or unknown and today extinct languages.\u5c0f\u6cc9\u4fdd\uff081998\uff09\u300e\u7e04\u6587\u8a9e\u306e\u767a\u898b\u300f\u9752\u571f\u793e (in Japanese)\u300e\u53e4\u4ee3\u306b\u771f\u5b9f\u3092\u6c42\u3081\u3066 \u7b2c\u4e03\u96c6\uff08\u53e4\u7530\u53f2\u5b66\u8ad6\u96c6\uff09\u300f2004\u5e74\u3001\u53e4\u7530\u53f2\u5b66\u306e\u4f1a\uff08\u7de8\u96c6\uff09 (in Japanese) While the most supported view is to equate the Ainu language with the J\u014dmon language, this view is not unproblematic as at least four tribes in central- and western-Japan are believed to have spoken a Tungusic language, at least three tribes in Kyushu and Okinawa an Austronesian language and it is not known if there were other groups with different languages too. ==Culture== The culture of the J\u014dmon people is known as \"J\u014dmon culture\". It was largely based on food collection and hunting but it is also suggested that the J\u014dmon people practiced early agriculture. They gathered tree nuts and shellfish, laid the foundations for living such as hunting and fishing, and also made some cultivation. They used stoneware and pottery, and lived in a pit dwelling. Some elements of modern Japanese culture may have come from Jomon groups. Among these elements are the precursors to Shinto, some marriage customs, some architectural styles, and possibly some technological developments such as lacquerware, laminated yumi, metalworking, and glass making. === Pottery === The J\u014dmon pottery style used by the J\u014dmon is a \u201ccord-marked\u201d style and is the name contributor for the J\u014dmon period. The pottery style characteristic of the first phases of J\u014dmon culture was decorated by impressing cords into the surface of wet clay and is generally accepted to be among the oldest in East Asia and the world.Kuzmin, Y.V. (2006). \"Chronology of the Earliest Pottery in East Asia: Progress and Pitfalls\". Antiquity. 80 (308): 362\u2013371. doi:10.1017/s0003598x00093686. Next to clay pots and vessels, the J\u014dmon also made many highly stylized statues (Dog\u016b), clay masks, stone batons or rods and swords. === Craftsmanship === There is evidence that the J\u014dmon people built ships out of big trees and used them for fishing and traveling. There is no agreement if they used sails or paddles.\u5824\u9686\u306f\u65e7\u77f3\u5668\u6642\u4ee3\u306e\u795e\u6d25\u5cf6\u3067\u306e\u9ed2\u66dc\u77f3\u63a1\u53d6\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u306f\u3001\u4e38\u6728\u821f\u3092\u5efa\u9020\u51fa\u6765\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306a\u77f3\u5668\u304c\u5b58\u5728\u3057\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304b\u3089\u8003\u3048\u3066\u3001\u30ab\u30e4\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30b9\u30ad\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305f\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3068\u6307\u6458\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\uff08\u5824\u9686\u300e\u9ed2\u66dc\u77f33\u4e07\u5e74\u306e\u65c5\u300fNHK\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30012004\u5e74\u300193\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\uff09 The Jomon also used Obsidian, Jade and different kinds of wood.\u672c\u7bc0\u306e\u5178\u62e0\u306f\u6a4b\u53e3\u3001\u524d\u63b2\u66f8\u3001158-172\u30da\u30fc\u30b8 The J\u014dmon created many jewelry and ornamental items. The Magatama was likely invented by one of the J\u014dmon tribes and is commonly found in Japan. === Religion === The religion of, at least some, J\u014dmon people was similar to early Shintoism (see Ko-Shint\u014d). It was largely based on animism and possibly shamanism. Other likely similar religions are the Ryukyuan and Ainu religion.Richard Pilgrim, Robert Ellwood (1985). Japanese Religion (1st ed.). Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall Inc. pp. 18\u201319. . == Descendants == This section deals with the suggested descendants of the people during the J\u014dmon period. === Ainu people === Historical extent of the Ainu people It is generally agreed that the Ainu people are the direct descendants of the J\u014dmon people. Although the Ainu show some influence from the Okhotsk people, a genetic study shows that the Hokkaido Ainu share most of their genome with ancient Jomon samples from northern Honshu and Hokkaido. === Emishi === The Emishi, a former non-Yamato group in Honshu, are often linked to the Ainu people, but several historians suggest that they were their own J\u014dmon group and did not share close cultural connections to the Ainu. The Satsumon Culture of northern Honshu, one of the cultures that merged to originate the Ainu culture, is often speculated to be related to the Emishi culture. === Siberian populations === Some ethnic groups in southeastern Siberia, such as the Ulch people, the Nivkh people and the Itelmens, show some Ainu-like genome informations. It is suggested that ancient J\u014dmon people migrated to parts of Siberia and mixed with the local population. === Yamato people === The Yamato Japanese are mostly descended from the Yayoi people but also have admixture from the J\u014dmon people. It is estimated that the J\u014dmon ancestry is less than 20%. Another study estimates the J\u014dmon ancestry in people from Tokyo at approximately 15%. One study estimates less than 15% of J\u014dmon ancestry in modern Yamato people. Recent studies suggest that the Japanese people descend mostly from the Yayoi people, and that the Yayoi largely displaced the local J\u014dmon. Another genome research (Takahashi et al. 2019) further confirms that modern Japanese (Yamato) descend mostly from the Yayoi people. Mitochondrial DNA analysis of J\u014dmon and modern Japanese samples show that there is a discontinuity between the mtDNAs of people from the J\u014dmon period and people from the Kofun and Heian periods. This finding implies that the genetic conversion of the Japanese people may have occurred during or before the Kofun era, at least at the Shomyoji site. === Ryukyuan people === According to several studies, the Ryukyuan people share more alleles with the J\u014dmon period (16,000\u20133,000 years ago) hunter-gatherers and Ainu people than the Yamato Japanese, have smaller genetic contributions from Asian continental populations, which supports the dual-structure model of K. Hanihara (1991), a widely accepted theory which suggests that the Yamato Japanese are more admixed with Asian agricultural continental people (from the Korean Peninsula) than the Ainu and the Ryukyuans, with major admixture occurring in and after the Yayoi period (3,000-1,700 years ago). Within the Japanese population, the Ryukyuans make a separate and one of the two genome-wide clusters along the main-island Honshu. The Jomon ancestry is estimated at approximately 28% or 50-60%, depending on various studies. The admixture event which formed the admixed Ryukyuans was estimated at least 1100\u20131075 years ago, which corresponds to the Gusuku period, and is considered to be related to the arrival of migrants from Japan. Thus, the Ryukyuans appear to be genetically closest to the Ainu from the Ainu viewpoint, whereas it is exactly the opposite from the Ryukyuans' viewpoint, who are closest to the Yamato Japanese. According to recent genome studies, Ryukyuans and especially Okinawans are closest to other East Asians but are also relative homogenous on a genetic level. The study did not find much evidence for a strong J\u014dmon influence on Ryukyuans. On average, the Okinawans were found to share 80.8% admixture with Japanese and 19.2% admixture with Chinese. Individual admixture estimates were quite variable and ranged from 5.84% to 57.82% Chinese admixture, which likely coincides with historical migrations of Chinese people to Okinawa. == Genetics == === Proposed Origin === There are several theories about their origin. Some suggested Southeast Asia or Northeast Asia as possible place of origin, while other theories supported an origin in East Asia itself. The newest genetic studies conclude that the J\u014dmon were part of a population from continental Eurasia. The J\u014dmon, when compared with worldwide populations, are relative closest to East Asians compared with African, European, Sahulian (Australo-Melanesian) and Native American groups. The comparison with the genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data of HGDP (Human Genome Diversity Panel) populations also showed the unique status of the Sanganji Jomon, who was positioned far apart from all modern East Eurasians. The uniqueness of the Sanganji Jomon within East Eurasians is consistent with the results including Europeans and Africans. When the Ainu, the mainland Japanese and the Ryukyuans from the Japanese Archipelago and CHB28 (Chinese from Beijing) were compared with Sanganji J\u014dmon, PC1 separated the Ainu and Sanganji J\u014dmon from the other populations. The population closest to the Sanganji J\u014dmon was the Ainu, followed by the Ryukyuan and then the mainland Japanese. Most scientists today suggest that the J\u014dmon are descendants of an ancient continental Eurasian population. The J\u014dmon cluster as own clade, distinct from other human population groups including East Asians, but share some relations to coastal people of East Asia, including modern Japanese, Ulchi, Koreans and native Taiwanese. According to Mitsuru Sakitani the J\u014dmon people are an admixture of two distinct ethnic groups: A more ancient group from Central Asia (carriers of Y chromosome D-M55), that were present since more than 30,000 years in Japan and a more recent group (carriers of Y chromosome C1a) that migrated to Japan about 13,000 years ago. Haplogroup D1 arrived from Central Asia to northern Kyushu via the Altai Mountains and the Korean Peninsula more than 40,000 years before present, and Haplogroup D-M55 (D1a2) was born in Japanese archipelago. D-M55 is distinct from other D-branches since more than 53,000 years and has five unique mutations not found the others.\u5d0e\u8c37\u6e80\u300eDNA\u30fb\u8003\u53e4\u30fb\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u5b66\u969b\u7814\u7a76\u304c\u793a\u3059\u65b0\u30fb\u65e5\u672c\u5217\u5cf6\u53f2\u300f\uff08\u52c9\u8aa0\u51fa\u7248 2009\u5e74\uff09(in Japanese)Mondal, Mayukh & Bergstr\u00f6m, Anders & Xue, Yali & Calafell, Francesc & Laayouni, Hafid & Casals, Ferran & Majumder, Partha & Tyler-Smith, Chris & Bertranpetit, Jaume. (2017). Y-chromosomal sequences of diverse Indian populations and the ancestry of the Andamanese. Human Genetics. 136. 10.1007/s00439-017-1800-0. C1a1's ancestral type reached Japan over the Korean Peninsula via the Altai Mountains from Western Asia. Although its age of arrival is unknown, the spread of the existing subgroup is about 12,000 years ago, which is almost consistent with the start of the J\u014dmon period. The next relative C1a2 was common in ancient European and West Asian samples and is still found in small numbers of modern Europeans, Armenians, Algerians (Kabyle Berbers), and Nepalis. In an overview article of recent genetic and morphological studies, Schmidt & Seguchi (2014) also suggest multiple origins for the J\u014dmon populations. ===Paternal lineages=== It is thought that the haplogroups D-M55 (D1a2) and C1a1 were frequent in J\u014dmon people. One J\u014dmon man excavated from Rebun Island was found to belong to Haplogroup D1a2b1(D-CTS 220).\u795e\u6fa4\u307b\u304b(2016)\u300c\u793c\u6587\u5cf6\u8239\u6cca\u7e04\u6587\u4eba\u306e\u6838\u30b2\u30ce\u30e0\u89e3\u6790\u300d\u7b2c70\u56de\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u985e\u5b66\u5927\u4f1a (in Japanese) Haplogroup D-M55 is found in about 35%Mayukh Monda Anders Bergstr\u00f6mYali XueFrancesc CalafellHafid LaayouniFerran CasalsPartha P.

In addition, it is assumed that the haplogroup C2 existed in a small amount of J\u014dmon people.\u5d0e\u8c37\u6e80 (2009)\u300eDNA\u30fb\u8003\u53e4\u30fb\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u5b66\u969b\u7814\u7a76\u304c\u793a\u3059\u65b0\u30fb\u65e5\u672c\u5217\u5cf6\u53f2\u300f\u52c9\u8aa0\u51fa\u7248 (in Japanese) D-M55 is only found in Japanese (Ainu, Ryukyuans, and Yamato). Haplogroup C1a has been found in modern Japanese, Paleolithic and Neolithic Europe, and in very few samples of modern Europeans, Armenians, Algerians, Nepalis, Koreans, and northeast Chinese. Recently it was confirmed that the Japanese branch of haplogroup D-M55 is distinct and isolated from other D-branches since more than 53,000 years. The split between D1a2-M55 and D1a-F6251 (the latter of which is common in Tibet and has a moderate distribution in the rest of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central Asia) may have occurred in Central Asia, while some others suggest an instant split during the origin of haplogroup D itself, as the Japanese branch has five unique mutations not found in any other D-branch. A recent DNA study in 2019 suggests that haplogroup D-M55 was carried by about 70% and haplogroup C1a1 by about 30% of the ancient J\u014dmon people. A specific Japanese-J\u014dmon clade is only found in ancient J\u014dmon and modern Japanese. No other population was found to carry this specific clade, which supports the distinct position of the J\u014dmon population. ===Maternal lineages=== MtDNA Haplogroup J\u014dmon people is characterized by the presence of haplogroups M7a and N9b. Studies published in 2004 and 2007 show the combined frequency of M7a and N9b observed in modern Japanese to be from 12~15% to 17% in mainstream Japanese.M. Tanaka, V. M. Cabrera, A. M. Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2004), \"Mitochondrial Genome Variation in Eastern Asia and the Peopling of Japan\" N9b is frequently found in the Hokkaido Jomons while M7a is found frequently in the Tohoku Jomons.Ancient mitochondrial DNA sequences of Jomon teeth samples from Sanganji, Tohoku district, Japan. M7a is estimated to share a most recent common ancestor with M7b'c, a clade whose members are found mainly in Japan (including J\u014dmon people), other parts of East Asia, and Southeast Asia, 33,500 (95% CI 26,300 <-> 42,000) years before present.YFull MTree 1.01.5902 as of April 20, 2019 All extant members of haplogroup M7a are estimated to share a most recent common ancestor 20,500 (95% CI 14,700 <-> 27,800) years before present. Haplogroup M7a now has its highest frequency in Okinawa. Haplogroup N9b is estimated to share a most recent common ancestor with N9a and Y, two clades that are widespread in eastern Asia, 37,700 (95% CI 29,600 <-> 47,300) years before present. All extant members of haplogroup N9b are estimated to share a most recent common ancestor 21,100 (95% CI 16,700 <-> 26,200) years before present. Haplogroup N9b now has its highest frequency among Tungusic peoples in southeastern Siberia (especially Udeges), but it has been found to be very common in skeletal remains of J\u014dmon people of northern Japan (T\u014dhoku and Hokkaid\u014d). In addition, haplogroups D4, D5, M7b, M8, M9a, M10, G, A, B, and F have been found in J\u014dmon people as well.2017 \u5ea6\u7b2c\uff14\u56de\u65e5\u672c\u6d77\u5b66\u8b1b\u5ea7 2018\u5e741\u670813\u65e5\uff08\u571f\uff09\u5bcc\u5c71\u770c\u6c11\u4f1a\u9928611\u53f7\u5ba4 14:00\uff5e15:30 \u300c\u65e5\u672c\u6d77\u5730\u57df\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\uff0d\u5c0f\u7af9\u8c9d\u585a\u51fa\u571f\u4eba\u9aa8\u3092\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3068\u3057\u3066\uff0d\u300d \u56fd\u7acb\u79d1\u5b66\u535a\u7269\u9928 \u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u5e79 \u5742\u4e0a\u548c\u5f18\u6c0f\u7be0\u7530\u8b19\u4e00\u300e\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u7956\u5148\u305f\u3061\u2014DNA\u304b\u3089\u89e3\u660e\u3059\u308b\u305d\u306e\u591a\u5143\u7684\u69cb\u9020\u300f\u65e5\u672c\u653e\u9001\u51fa\u7248\u5354\u4f1a\u30fbNHK\u30d6\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30012007\u5e74 (in Japanese)Genetic structure of the Japanese and the formation of the Ainu population These latter haplogroups are all distributed widely among populations of East Asia (including modern Japanese, Ryukyuans, and Ainus) and Southeast Asia, but some of their subclades are distributed almost exclusively in Japan. ===ATL retrovirus === A gene common in J\u014dmon people is a retrovirus of ATL (human T lymphotropic virus, HTVL-I). This virus was discovered as a cause of adult T cell leukemia (ATL), and research was advanced by Takuo Hinuma of Kyoto University Virus Research Institute. Although it was known that many virus carriers existed in Japan, it was not found at all in neighboring countries of East Asia. Meanwhile, it has been found in many Africans, Native Americans, Tibetans, Siberians, Burmese people, Indigenous people of New Guinea, Polynesians, etc. Looking at distribution in Japan, it is seen particularly frequently in southern Kyushu, Nagasaki Prefecture, Okinawa and among the Ainu. And it is seen at medium frequency in the southern part of Shikoku, southern part of the Kii Peninsula, the Pacific side of the T\u014dhoku region (Sanriku) and Oki Islands. Overall, carriers of the ATL retrovirus were found to be more common in remote areas and remote islands. When examining the well-developed areas of ATL in each region of Kyushu, Shikoku, and T\u014dhoku in detail, carriers are preserved at high rates in small settlements that were isolated from the surroundings and inconvenient for traffic. The path of natural infection of this virus is limited to vertical infection between women and children (most often through breastfeeding) and horizontal infection between males and females (most often from males to females through sexual intercourse).Coffin JM, Hughes SH, Varmus HE, editors. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor (NY): Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 1997. Based on the above, Hinuma concluded that the high frequency area of this virus indicates the high density remain of J\u014dmon people. === Ikawazu J\u014dmon studies (2018~) === In the current study, a analysis of partial genome sequences of Sanganji, Ikawazu, and Funadomari Jomon were found to share a common lineage, although the data were not sufficient to identify geographical variations. Based on craniometric data, Kondo et al. (2017).Late Jomon male and female genome sequences from the Funadomari site in Hokkaido, Japan A partial genome analysis in 2018 about the prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia analysed 26 ancient samples from Southeast Asia spanning from the late Neolithic to the Iron Age. They analysed an Ikawazu J\u014dmon (named IK002) sample from southeast Honshu, and a draft sequence of the Jomon genome was determined from IK002. The Jomon female skeleton which was analyzed shows typical J\u014dmon morphology. This J\u014dmon individual partially shares some ancestry with prehistoric Hoabinhians, who also share some ancestry with Onge, Jehai (Peninsular Malaysia) in mainland Southeast Asia along with Indian groups and Papua New Guineans, which represents possible gene flow from that group into the J\u014dmon population. On the 'Admixture graphs fitting ancient Southeast Asian genomes' Using qpGraph, present-day East Asians can be modeled as a mixture of an \u00d6nge-like population and a population related to the Ti\u00e1nyu\u00e1n individual. While The J\u014dmon individual is modeled as a mix of H\u00f2ab\u00ecnhian (La368) and East Asian ancestry.Fig. 3 Admixture graphs fitting ancient Southeast Asian genomes However, there is still lack of ancient genome data to understand the peopling history of East Eurasians. It is required to analyze more ancient genome data, if there found appropriate skeletons, in order to fill the gap and to prove the speculation.https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/03/15/579177.full.pdf Her mitochondrial mtDNA is Haplogroup N9b which is typical of Northeast Siberian populations, this haplogroups in present-day Japaneses people (< 2.0%), but typically found in previous studies of Jomon mtDNAJomon genome sheds light on East Asian population history N9b 4% in Okinawans, 6.9% in modern Ulchi 8% in Modern Ainu, 32.3% in the Udegey, People of the Amur-Ussuri where the region carry high frequencies of N9b.Investigating the Prehistory of Tungusic Peoples of Siberia and the Amur-Ussuri Region with Complete mtDNA Genome Sequences and Y-chromosomal Markers Additional analysis in 2019 of the IK002 show that she clusters as an outgroup with other East Eurasian populations. Using principal component analysis (PCA) IK002 clusters basal to present-day Southeast and East Asians and the Upper-Paleolithic human remain (40 kya) from Ti\u00e1nyu\u00e1n Cave (ancestors to modern East Asians and Native Americas). However If IK002 were a true outgroup to later East Asian groups, this statistic is expected to be zero for any test population X. However, it find that together with Japanese, present-day Taiwan aborigines (Ami and Atayal), as well as minorities in the Okhotsk-Primorye region (Ulchi and Nivhk) also showed a significant excess of alleles haring with IK002. The highest IK002-related contributions is 41% in the Taiwanese aborigine Amis people. IK002 shows extra genetic affinity with the indigenous Taiwanese aborigines as well as with the Ulch people, which may also support the hypothesis of gene flow of Jomon-ancestry through migration. The Jomon female IK002 clusters closely with the Hokkaido Ainu, which is supporting previous findings that they are direct descendants of the Jomon people. The PCA plot showed the Jomon female sample IK002 is only slightly different from present- day people in East Eurasia and Japan with exception of Hokkaido Ainu. An ancestral component unique to IK002 is the most prevalent in the Hokkaido Ainu (average 79.3%). This component is also found at a minor percentage in mainland Japanese as well as East Siberian groups such as Ulchi (9.8% and 6.0%, respectively) who are natives in the Ulchsky District of Khabarovsk Krai. IK002 can be modelled as a basal lineage relative closer to East Asians, Northeast Asia/East Siberians, and Native Americans. The authors concluded that the ancestral J\u014dmon population may have arrived to East Asia and Japan through the southern Himalayas and Southeast Asia but say that more ancient genome data is needed to recreate their origin and migration. === Funadomari J\u014dmon study (2019) === A full genome analysis (Kanzawa-Kiriyama et al. 2019),Late Jomon male and female genome sequences from the Funadomari site in Hokkaido, Japan - Hideaki Kanzawa-Kiriyama, Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Nature and Science 2018/2019en using high-confidence SNPs and functional SNP assessments to assign possible phenotypic characteristics as well as Y-chromosome polymorphisms, analysed a male and a female Jomon sample. The Funadomari archaeological site is located on a sandbar separating Lake Kushu from Funadomari Bay on the north coast of Rebun Island, a small island off the northwestern tip of Hokkaid\u014d. The study results suggest that the J\u014dmon are their own distinct population and not closely related to other populations. The Funadomari J\u014dmon are not related to Australo-Melanesians (including Andamanese) or Africans. The J\u014dmon are closer to Eurasian populations and form a cluster near the \u201cBasal East Asians\u201d. Modern Japanese share about 9% to 13% of their genome with the J\u014dmon. J\u014dmon specific genome is also found in minor percentage in populations of Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia, suggesting gene-flow from J\u014dmon related groups. Additionally, the J\u014dmon share specific gene alleles with populations in the Arctic regions of Eurasia and northern America. Tests using phylogenetic relationship suggests that the Funadomari J\u014dmon have about 86% East Asian related ancestry and about 14% West Asian/European related ancestry. According to the authors, more data is needed to explain these results and possible consequences. === Rebun J\u014dmon study (2019) === Another full genome analysis of a 3,800 year old J\u014dmon woman shows that this sample shared gene variants which are found only in Arctic populations of Eurasia, but are absent elsewhere. According to the authors this provides evidence that the Jomon fished and hunted fatty sea and land animals. The sample also showed a higher alcohol tolerance than other Eastern Eurasian populations. Further analysis suggest that the J\u014dmon sample was at high risk of developing liver spots if she spent to much time in the sun. The J\u014dmon sample had wet earwax, which is rare among modern East Asian populations. Despite the strong differences, the Rebun J\u014dmon sample is relative closest to modern Japanese. Additionally the Rebun J\u014dmon sample is also relative closer to coastal groups such as Ulchi in Russia and some aboriginal Taiwanese than to Han-Chinese. A facial reconstruction in 2018 based on genome information of a 3,800 year old Jomon women from Rebun Island in Hokkaido showed that the color of the woman's skin was slightly darker than that of modern Japanese, her hair was thin and fine, and that the color of her eyes was light brown. Additionally, analysis revealed that the woman had blood type A+. === Full genome analysis (Boer et al. 2020) === A full genome analysis published in the Cambridge University Press in 2020, analysed for the first time the complete genome of several J\u014dmon samples. The results were \"rather surprising\" and complicate the peopling of Asia. The J\u014dmon people were found to be genetically distinct and not related to \"Basal-Asians\" (such as the Tianyuan and Hoabhinians). This disproves the hypothese of a possible Southeast Asian origin for the J\u014dmon which was proposed by a small amount of scholars. The J\u014dmon share relatively most genome with Paleolithic Siberians, as well as with modern people in Japan and various groups around the Sea of Okhotsk. == In popular culture == Aspects of the J\u014dmon culture were used in the video game \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u201d. Nintendo's art director Takizawa Satoru said that the J\u014dmon culture was the inspiration for the \u201cSheikah slates, shrines and other ancient objects\u201d in the game. A recreated J\u014dmon village in the form of an experience park (Sarashina no Sato), which offers different activities, can be visited in Chikuma, Nagano. == See also == * History of Japan * Yayoi people * Okhotsk culture *Satsumon culture *Emishi ==References== Category:Ancient Japan Category:Archaeology of Japan Category:J\u014dmon period Category:Tribes of ancient Japan ",
