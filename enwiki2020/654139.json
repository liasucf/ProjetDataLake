He also worked as a computer architect at Goodyear Aerospace in Akron, Ohio for 28 years. ==Early life and education== He was born in December 1935 in Queens, New York City to Louis and Ralph Batcher. His parents met at Iowa State University and later relocated to New York City after graduation. His father, Ralph R. Batcher, was the Chief Engineer of The A. H. Grebe Radio Company until its bankruptcy in 1932.Early Electronic Television, Early TV In New York City Retrieved on 5 Mar 2018 He graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School.. Batcher graduated from Iowa State University with B.E. degree in 1957. In 1964, Batcher received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois. ==His career and achievements== Among the designs he worked on at Goodyear were the: * Massively Parallel Processor (16,384 custom bit-serial processors {8 to a chip} organized in a SIMD 128 x 128 processor array with additional CPU rows for fault-tolerance) which was located at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and is now in the Smithsonian. This unit predates Danny Hillis' Thinking Machines Corporation's Connection Machine * The Goodyear STARAN associative processor arrays, a version of which (called ASPRO) was found in the US Navy Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye radar planes. He published several technical papers and owns 14 patents of his own. \"He discovered two parallel sorting algorithms: the odd-even mergesort and the bitonic mergesort\". He is also a discoverer of scrambling data method in a random access memory which allows accesses along multiple dimensions. These memories were used in the STARAN and the MPP parallel processors.Kenneth E. Batcher Retrieved on 5 Mar 2018Kenneth E. Batcher Retrieved on 5 Mar 2018 ==Awards== In 1980 he received an Arnstein Award presented by Goodyear Aerospace Corporation for technical achievement. In 1990, Batcher was awarded the ACM/IEEE Eckert-Mauchly Award for his pioneering work on parallel computers. He holds 14 patents. In 2007, Batcher was awarded the IEEE Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award; \"For fundamental theoretical and practical contributions to massively parallel computation, including parallel sorting algorithms, interconnection networks, and pioneering designs of the STARAN and MPP computers.\" He is credited with discovering two important parallel sorting algorithms: the odd-even mergesort and the bitonic mergesort.Donald E. Knuth. The Art of Computer Programming. Volume 3: Sorting and Searching. Second Edition (Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 1998), xiv+780pp.+foldout. \u00b4 Batcher is known for his half-serious, half-humorous definition that \"A supercomputer is a device for turning compute-bound problems into I/O-bound problems.\" ==Publications== *Sorting Networks and their Applications, 1968 Spring Joint Computer Conference, AFIPS Proc. vol. 32, pp 307\u2013314.
