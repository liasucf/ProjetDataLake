Born in Leiden (County of Holland), he travelled through Italy as a young man and settled in Brussels (Duchy of Brabant), where he died. Van Veen's engraving entitled Pr\u00e6stigiator (1588), showing an Indian medicine man in the midst of a ritual dance, was based on an earlier watercolor painting by John White. The image is one of a series that portrayed the lives of the Algonquian-speaking Indians in the Outer Banks region of present-day North Carolina. In 1603 Van Veen was paid 150 livres from state funds for carrying out secret missions for the Archdukes Albert and Isabella.\"pour affaires secretz concernans grandement le service de Leurs Alt\u00e8zes, dont n'est besoing faire plus ample d\u00e9claration\" (for secret affairs of great importance to the service of their highnesses, which need not be explained more fully).

In the same year he was awarded 373 livres 15 sols in part payment of 873 livres 15 sols due for portraits of Albert, Isabella, and the late Philip II of Spain, painted at the Archdukes' behest as a gift for Charles Philippe de Cro\u00ff, Marquis d\u2019Havr\u00e9. In 1604 he was paid another 803 livres and 10 sols for portraits of the king and queen of Spain, again gifts for the Marquis of Havr\u00e9, and for portraits of Albert and Isabella that had been sent to the King of England the previous year.Jules Finot (ed.), Inventaire sommaire des archives d\u00e9partementales ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 1790.
