    "text": "Return Journey is an Australian film about the Burke and Wills expedition. It was directed by William Sterling and produced by John Sherman. In 1961 filming began with a cast of four and a crew including Sterling and cameraman Gerry Vandenberg. Filming took place near Alice Springs. They had $12,000 in funds. The plan was to film it on 16 mm and blow it up to 35mm. Filming was difficult - there was trouble with the camera, colour stock and sound track. The filmmakers did not have enough money to complete the feature film so it was recut as a documentary. In 1966, when John Sherman died, Colin Bennett claimed he had seen three different versions and said the best was a 30 minute documentary version. However at that stage the film had not yet been released. ==Cast== *Edward Brayshaw as Wills *Peter Carver as Burke *Syd Conabere as King *David Mitchell as Gray ==References== ==External links== *Return Journey at National Film and Sound Archive Category:Australian films ",
