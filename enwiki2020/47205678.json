    "text": "Join Bing and Sing Along is a long-playing vinyl album issued first by RCA Victor (LPM/LSP-2276) and immediately thereafter by Warner Bros. Records (W/WS-1363) in 1960. The album consists of twelve medleys of 33 old songs in a singalong format. Bing Crosby sings on all of the tracks except those marked with an asterisk. The chorus and orchestra is conducted by Jack Halloran and their tracks were pre-recorded on November 9 & 13, 1959 with Crosby over- dubbing his vocals. Orchestral arrangements were by Bob Thompson. The album entered the UK album charts on October 8, 1960 and reached a peak position of No. 7 in an 11-week stay. Hallmark Records issued the album on CD in 2011 No. 710082. ==Reception== Variety magazine reviewed the album saying \u201cEvery company seems to be getting into the \u201cSing Along\u201d act that Mitch Miller started for Columbia in the spring of 1958. Warner Bros. has a good scoring chance with their Bing Crosby version. He leads the vocal chorus through 33 familiar items and he has a way that makes it easy to join along.\u201d Billboard liked it. \"Of course, this is imitation, as are so many of the recent sing- along sets, but it is a first-rate one due to the presence of the old master, Bing Crosby. The grand collection of 33 old-time tunes is made to order for the old Groaner, and he sings them infectiously so that everyone is sure to sing along with him. If exploited this could be a good seller.\" Crosby expert, Fred Reynolds, writing in his book The Crosby Collection, 1926\u20131977 summed it up as follows: \"Bing makes little attempt at subtlety of phrasing, ornamentation, niceties or nuances of any kind and his vocals, backed by hearty voices, create only a mechanically jolly atmosphere of a party get- together. There was a criticism, not without justification, that the album was too lightweight for a singer of his calibre but in mitigation it can be fairly claimed that it is a pleasant, happy sound with well chosen classic old songs brought back to life.\" ==Track listing== *Non-Bing \u2013 orchestra and chorus only == References == Category:1960 albums Category:Bing Crosby albums Category:Sing-along ",
