    "text": "Sibirocosa sibirica is a species of wolf spider. It has a fairly wide distribution in Siberia: from the Putorana Plateau east to the Chersky Range and south to northern Transbaikal. This spider has a body length of up to 6.5 mm. It is usually brown in colour, though it is quite variable. There are few external distinguishing marks although the male has a light coloured heart- shaped mark and two rows of white spots on the abdomen. It can only be distinguished with certainty from related species by details of the genitalia. ==References== * Category:Lycosidae Category:Spiders of Russia Category:Fauna of Siberia Category:Spiders described in 1908 Category:Taxa named by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kulczy\u0144ski ",
