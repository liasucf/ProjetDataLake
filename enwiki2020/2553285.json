    "text": "The Way That I Am is the second album by American country music singer Martina McBride, released in 1993 by RCA Nashville. It was certified Platinum on May 15, 1995 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). This was her breakthrough album, producing her first Top 5 hit in \"My Baby Loves Me\", which was previously released as a single by Canadian singer Patricia Conroy from her 1992 album Bad Day for Trains. McBride's version was a number 2 hit on the Hot Country Songs also. Also released as singles from this album were \"Life #9\" at number 6, \"Independence Day\" at number 12, \"Heart Trouble\" at number 21, and \"Where I Used to Have a Heart\" at number 49. ==Content== Although never released as a single, \"Strangers\" was reprised on McBride's Greatest Hits album in 2001. In the liner notes of that album, she stated that she included the song because it was a fan favorite, and she felt that it would have been a better follow-up to \"Independence Day\" than \"Heart Trouble\" and \"Where I Used to Have a Heart\" were. The Compact Cassette version of this album omits the final track, \"Ashes\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Compiled from liner notes. ;Musicians * Grace Mihi Bahng - cello (3) * Brett Beavers - backing vocals (6 & 10) * Joe Chemay - bass guitar (all tracks) * Ashley Cleveland - backing vocals (4) * Deryl Dodd - backing vocals (6 & 10) * Dan Dugmore - electric guitar (2) * Larry Franklin - fiddle (1, 8 & 10) * Paul Franklin - pedal steel guitar (4 & 8) * Johnny Garcia - electric guitar (1) * Vicki Hampton - backing vocals (4) * Dann Huff - electric guitar (2, 6 & 7) * Bill Hullett - acoustic guitar (1, 3-5 & 8-10) * Mary Ann Kennedy - backing vocals (2, 4 & 7) * Martina McBride - lead vocals (all tracks), backing vocals (2, 4, & 7-9), tambourine (6) * Anthony S.
