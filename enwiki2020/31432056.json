    "text": "The Flaming Lips with Neon Indian is an extended play by American rock band the Flaming Lips and American electronic music band Neon Indian. It was released on March 23, 2011 as part of The Flaming Lips 2011 series of monthly music releases. The 12-inch EP was a limited release pressed on special colored vinyl and distributed to select record stores in the United States. The song \"Is David Bowie Dying?\" was later included on the 2012 album The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends. ==Background== Neon Indian frontman Alan Palomo met Flaming Lips lead vocalist Wayne Coyne during a show in Portland, Oregon: \"He was like 'hey, man, we should do something!' We didn't know exactly what it was going to be; maybe we'd play some shows together, maybe we'd make some music. We just kept in contact, and by the time I was in the studio with Fridmann, the Lips had a couple of extra days lined up to record there that were overlapping, then Wayne said 'why don\u2019t we show up a couple of days early, we'll fuck around in the studio and see what happens?' And, sure enough, the songs we made all came out of that period\". ==Critical reception== Reviews of The Flaming Lips with Neon Indian were positive. Marc Masters of Pitchfork gave the EP a rating of 7.4 out of 10. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of The Flaming Lips with Neon Indian. * Derek Brown \u2013 performer * Wayne Coyne \u2013 performer * Steven Drozd \u2013 performer * The Flaming Lips \u2013 production * Dave Fridmann \u2013 production * Michael Ivins \u2013 performer * Alan Palomo \u2013 performer * George Salisbury \u2013 design, layout * Kliph Scurlock \u2013 performer ==References== Category:2011 EPs Category:Albums produced by Dave Fridmann Category:Collaborative albums Category:The Flaming Lips EPs Category:Neon Indian albums Category:Warner Records EPs Category:Albums recorded at Tarbox Road Studios ",
