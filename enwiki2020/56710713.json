A researcher at CNRS from 1957 to 1963, she was awarded a Ph.D. in 1962 under Gustave Choquet. She is an Emeritus Professor at IRCAM, at the University of Picardie Jules Verne, having worked there from 1967. Ehresmann has published over a hundred works on Analysis (Differential Calculus and Infinite Dimension Distributions, Guiding Systems and Optimization Problems), Category Theory (with her husband, Charles Ehresmann: sketches and internal categories, multiple categories, closed monoidal structures) and the modeling of complex autonomous systems (Memory Scalable Systems, including the MENS model for neuro-cognitive systems).. She developed, with J.-P. Vanbremeersch a model of Memory Evolutive Systems, which proposes a mathematical model for 'living' systems with a hierarchy of complex components with multiple temporalities, such as biological, neuro-cognitive, or social systems. Based on a theory of 'dynamic' categories, evolving memory systems can analyze complexity, emergence and self-organization. She is the director of the mathematical journal Cahiers de Topologie et G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Diff\u00e9rentielle Cat\u00e9goriques. == Notes and references == == External links == * Intervention d'Andr\u00e9e Ehresmann \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence \u00ab Math\u00e9matiques innovantes 2010 \u00bb Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century French mathematicians Category:Category theorists Category:French women mathematicians Category:20th-century women mathematicians ",
