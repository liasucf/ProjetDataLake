    "text": "The presence of LGBTQ officers in law enforcement has a history of controversy. As times have changed, police forces have adapted by adding LGBTQ divisions, officers and committees within their ranks to account for legislation established by governments to protect individuals who previously had little or no voice when it came to laws impacting their own communities. ==Diversity and inclusion in policing== Diversity in service and the elimination of discrimination across the planet is led by many individuals, staff, associations and others within the global police community. Inclusivity, evolution, acceptance, intersectionality, organizational values and career advancement lead to proud cops and growing acceptance. Nevertheless, many LGBTQ individuals still face significant discrimination in the police force. In a 2013 study of British forces, Jones and Williams found that almost 20% of sexual minority officers said they experienced discrimination. At the same time, only 25% of those individuals reported the incident to a supervisor. The following is a timeline of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) police history. ==1960s== ===1969=== U.S. * In this year, 1969, a Washington, DC area officer transitioned and served as female officer for 12 of 32 years total. ==1970s== ===1974=== U.S. *Alameda County (California) Sheriff's office begins recruiting gay officers, in the face of gay crime victims in San Francisco having reluctance to report the crimes against them. ===1978=== U.S. *New York City mayor Ed Koch bans discrimination in police hiring on the basis of sexual orientation.

In 2016, a Greenwich Village street was named after him (Sergeant Charles H. Cochrane Way). A news story that quoted journalist Andy Humm reported: ===1982=== U.S. *New York City police sergeant Charles H.
