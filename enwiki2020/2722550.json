    "text": "The Hillsboro School District 1J is a unified school district located in Hillsboro, Oregon, United States. The district operates 26 elementary schools, four middle schools, and four high schools. Founded in 1851, the school district covers Hillsboro, Scholls, Reedville, North Plains, West Union, and other area communities. Total enrollment as of the 2014\u20132015 school year is 20,884 students, the fourth largest in the state. The district is labeled 1J, as it absorbed the West Union School District, the first district in the county; the J (for \"joint\") represents that the district extends into other counties, Yamhill and Multnomah. Hillsboro's elementary schools had been District 7 prior to consolidation in 1996. The high school district was 3J and included students from grades 7 through 12, and received students from the Hillsboro elementary district and five other elementary districts. The Hillsboro School District Board of Directors (school board) consists of seven elected members serving four-year terms. Members receive no pay for their work on the board. The district is part of the Northwest Regional Education Service District.Hillsboro board rethinks, accepts education service district budget. The Oregonian, February 27, 2003. The district also runs a special alternative school and the Hare Field athletic complex. The school district drew criticism for a 12-year contract signed with Coca-Cola to provide soft drinks to the district's schools.Warner, Melanie. Lines Are Drawn for Big Suit Over Sodas. The New York Times, December 7, 2005. ==History== Hillsboro's first school district was formed in 1851 as School District 7. The Reverend Horace Lyman established the district and was the first commissioner, with that title later becoming school superintendent. The first school in the district was a single- room log cabin built in 1853 after a school levy was passed to raise $600 for construction. In 1875, a new frame constructed school was built, with the smaller log cabin was kept for additional space. Map of Hillsboro and school locations as of 2008 In 1890 a new eight-room schoolhouse was finished at the present site of David Hill Elementary. In September 1908, tenth grade was added to the Hillsboro school district, with the classes held on the top floor of the school. Eleventh and twelfth grades were soon added, and in June 1911 the first students to complete four years of high school graduated. This class totaled five students, four girls and one boy. A stand-alone high school was completed by 1913, and a gymnasium was built beginning in 1915. The district overall employed a total of 19 teachers for the 1913\u20131914 school year. All five of the high school teachers in the district resigned in 1914 in a dispute with management. The school board had allowed the students to vote on which teachers to retain, which the teachers resented even though all were retained in the vote. The mass walkout led to classes being canceled for a time. The district paid high school teachers $133 per month, other teachers $125 per month, and principals $1500 per year for the 1920 to 1921 school year. In 1929, a new high school building was finished with additional buildings and the wings added later. The neighboring Cornelius school district was dissolved in 1960, and part of their enrollment area was shifted to the Hillsboro districts, while the remainder went to the Forest Grove School District. Brookwood Elementary was opened in 1953, followed by Poynter Junior High in 1960, then Brown Junior High and Mooberry Elementary in 1963. In May 1961, voters in all the districts feeding the high school voted on a proposal to merge into a single district. Voters decided not to merge, but the next February voters did approve merging the junior high grades into the high school district. The high school district then purchased Poynter from the elementary district for $772,566, and passed a bond measure in March 1962 to pay for that purchase, expand the school, and pay for the new junior high school that became Brown. The district opened Hare Field in 1965, a multi- sport facility with a track, baseball stadium, and football field.McKinney, Dick. Sparts win first game at Hare. The Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976.Gaynair, Gillian. Hillsboro thinks things will go better with Coke. The Oregonian, May 21, 1998. In 1970, a new senior high school opened on on the south side of Hillsboro, with enrollment of the high school district reaching 3,621 students that year. The Union High School District's teachers held a three-day strike in March 1973 over their contracts, the first teacher's strike in Oregon history. By 1987, enrollment in all the districts feeding into the high school district along with the high school district reached approximately 12,325 students.Ostergren, Jack. Hillsboro hears report on unified school district plan. The Oregonian, September 9, 1987. In 1987, the Union High School District began plans to unify the high school district with the six elementary districts that feed into the district's junior and senior high schools. In 1991, the Oregon Legislature passed a law requiring school districts to unify by 1996, which forced some reluctant elementary districts to unify into the Hillsboro School District.Di Rado, Alicia. Agness stays true to its history. The Oregonian, October 1, 1995. On July 1, 1996, Hillsboro Elementary, North Plains, Farmington View, Groner, Reedville, West Union, and Hillsboro Union High School districts unified into a single district, the fifth largest in Oregon at that time.Franzen, Robin. Leaving nothing to chance. The Oregonian, May 30, 1996. Hilhi gym ===21st century=== In 2003, the district made national news when 17 days of classes were cut from the school year, which allowed students to be out in May, due to budget cuts to education in Oregon.Oregon schools cutting class. CNN.com. Retrieved on February 8, 2008. That year enrollment reached 18,951 for the unified district.Most school districts in county see growth. The Oregonian, October 5, 2004. In 2006, the district implemented a statistical tracking program that keeps track of all student information such as demographics, attendance, and academic achievement.Navas, Melissa. 'Data warehouse' tracks students. The Oregonian, May 17, 2007. The district faced opposition in 2009 over the demolition of J. B. Thomas Middle School, which preservationists wanted to save for use as a community building. The district planned to tear down the old building after a 2006 bond measure approved construction of several new schools, including a new middle school and expansion at the other existing middle schools. A new elementary school was built with funds from this levy on the eastern part of Thomas' grounds, with the buildings of the old school to be torn down to make way for athletic fields. In July 2009, a court allowed the demolition to go forward. By November 2009 the district had become the first in Oregon to use an Internet-based crisis management program to allow for easier access to information on schools by the district. HSD purchased in the South Hillsboro area in April 2014 to house a fifth high school, and, along with prior acquisitions, could add up to four elementary schools and a middle school in that area. ==Schools== The district operates 32 schools, including four high schools, four middle schools, and 26 elementary schools.Fast Facts. Hillsboro School District. Retrieved on March 28, 2008. HSD also operates an alternative combined middle and high school as well as a charter school. As of April 2008, four new elementary schools and one new middle school were under construction. Staffing includes 1,089 full-time classified employees, 1,105 full-time teachers, and 73 administrator staff members. The average student to teacher ratio is 26:1 with a 3.5% drop-out rate for the 2005 to 2006 school year. In the 2009 school year, the district had 403 students classified as homeless by the Department of Education, or 2.0% of students in the district. The annual budget is $216 million.2006-2007 Annual Report. Hillsboro School District.

As a response to researchhttp://www.ejeacademies.org/ourpages/auto/2010/9/8/48567192/Integrated%20Content%20_%20Language%20Instruction.pdfhttp://ell.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/Conference%20Summary_0.pdf showing that native language instruction increases general literacy, community involvement, and graduation rates, the program was first implemented at the elementary level (at W. L. Henry and Minter Bridge) and now extends K-12 in the Hillsboro High School feeder. The district, which as of 2009-2010 enrolled 16% English-language learners, now offers a dual language diploma endorsement,http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-12-10/enter-school-s-raising-bar- bilingual-ed allowing graduates to demonstrate assessed academic proficiency in both English and Spanish. In neighborhood elementary schools where ELL enrollment is high, early grades are weighted heavily towards the native language. Grade level advancement blends English at an increasing rate in all academic areas (language arts, math, science, etc.), until the overall balance is at approximate parity by middle school.http://www.oregonlive.com/washingtoncounty/index.ssf/2014/09/first_day_at_south_meadows_mid.html Enrollment is optional, meaning the district will accommodate transfer requests away from entirely dual-language neighborhood schools; conversely, families whose neighborhood schools are not part of the program may request in-district transfer to join. ==See also== * List of school districts in Oregon ==References== ==External links== * * Great Schools profile Category:School districts in Oregon Category:Education in Hillsboro, Oregon Category:Educational institutions established in 1851 Category:1851 establishments in Oregon Territory Category:Education in Yamhill County, Oregon Category:Education in Multnomah County, Oregon Category:Cornelius, Oregon ",
