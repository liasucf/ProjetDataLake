    "text": "== Museum History == The Archaeological Museum of Ancient Corinth was constructed between 1931-1932, with intentions to display the numerous recent archaeological excavations. The museum is located within the archaeological site of Ancient Corinth, Greece, and lies under the jurisdiction of the 37th Ephoreia of the Greek Archaeological Service.The building was designed by architect Stuart Thompson, constructed by the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, with respect to a generous donation made by Ada Small Moore. Thompson\u2019s design of the museum derived from the architectural model of the \u201cChicago school\u201d. In 1951, the west part of the building was extended, allowing space within the museum to be organised around two atriums. Between 2007-2008 renovations occurred as a result of the 3rd Community Support Framework (CSF). Improvements were made to two galleries consisting of the prehistoric collections and the findings from the Sanctuary of Asklepios. In 2015, the east and south areas of the museum now contained new large-scale works. The 2007-2013 National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) was able to assist in funding a new exhibition project in the refurbished east and south areas of the building, consisting of works from the Geometric Period until its demolition by the Romans in 146 B.C. == Ancient Corinth == Temple of Apollo, Archaeological Site of Ancient Corinth Early excavations of the archaeological site of Ancient Corinth began in 1896 and has since continued. The Temple of Apollo, one of the most significant monuments of Ancient Corinth was built approximately 540 B.C. Acting as an emblem for the Greek city of Corinth, this monument dominated Ancient Corinth, reflecting its growth and prosperity. Further investigations discovered the remains originated from the Early Neolithic period (6500-5750 B.C.) through to early modern age. Other key aspects of the Archaeological site of Ancient Corinth include: * Lechaion Road * Basilica * Fountain of Peirene * Stoa * Agora * Odien * Other temples * Theatre * Surrounding shops Findings of archaeological works at the site are enclosed in the Archaeological Museum of Ancient Corinth. This includes the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on the slopes of Acrocorinth, in the Potters' Quarter, at the sites of the Sanctuary of Asklepios and Kenchreian Gate Basilica. == Exhibitions == The Archaeological Museum of Ancient Corinth contains an extensive collection of artefacts originally found in Ancient Corinth.

Exhibition \"Corinth at Prehistoric times\" - Mycenaen Pottery === Prehistoric Gallery === The gallery \"Corinth at Prehistoric times\", contains findings originated from the area of Ancient Corinth, the Korakou Hill and the site of Zygouries.
