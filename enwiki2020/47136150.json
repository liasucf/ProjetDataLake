    "text": "The Clarence Anderson Barn is a historic barn on the north side of Arkansas Highway 66 in the hamlet of Newnata, Arkansas. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with vertical board siding and enclosed sheds on the side. The interior is organized in a transverse crib manner. Built in 1925, the building is distinctive for the pair of gable-roof dormers placed near the ridge line; this sort of feature is not usually found on barns in the region. The barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Stone County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Barns on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1925 Category:Buildings and structures in Stone County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Stone County, Arkansas Category:Barns in Arkansas ",
