    "text": "Annie Land O'Berry (1885\u20131944) was an activist, relief worker, and philanthropist from North Carolina. O'Berry was a native to North Carolina, growing up in Edgecombe County on a farm with her family. She was involved in women's clubs and an open member of the Democratic party. More specifically, O\u2019Berry's endeavors in the North Carolina Emergency Relief Association, North Carolina Democratic Party, League of Women Voters, and the Women's Missionary Society at her local Presbyterian Church demonstrated her dedication to serving her community. As an academic, O'Berry was named the first honor graduate from Peace University. == Early life and education == Annie Land O\u2019Berry was born on May 28, 1885, in Edgecombe County, North Carolina, to V.W. and Mary Dawson Mayo Land. O\u2019Berry grew up on her family plantation and enjoyed playing outdoor sports until the age of 13, when her parents died and she moved to live with her older sister in Littleton. From a young age, O\u2019Berry was interested in and excelled at school. In grammar school O\u2019Berry attained high marks and continued on to study at Littleton College. She then attended the William Peace University, graduating as the first honor graduate. After graduation, O\u2019Berry moved in with her brother, Edward Land, in Kinston. There, O\u2019Berry was an active member of the Presbyterian Church where she organized Sunday School and was chairman of the Women's Missionary Society. On December 14, 1909, Annie Land married Thomas O\u2019Berry and soon after they moved to Goldsboro, North Carolina. Throughout her career, O\u2019Berry advocated for education and aspired to end adult illiteracy. In addition, as O\u2019Berry focused on relief in her own community, she took a course on social work at Columbia University. == Philanthropy == While living with her brother in Kinston, Annie Land O\u2019Berry was very active in the North Carolina Federation of Women's Clubs. She became the first chairman of the Anti-Tuberculosis Committee of Wayne County where she was the president for two years. O\u2019Berry gave her time and effort to what was then called the Charity Organization of Goldsboro. She later went to Columbia University in order to learn more about this type of work. O\u2019Berry also helped her father-in-law, Captain Nathan O\u2019Berry of Goldsboro, raise over $5,000.00 to help white collar people during the depression. As a result, Governor Angus McLean appointed her to the Commission to Study County Government and the North Carolina Historical Commission. O\u2019Berry also worked in the Goldsboro Club in Women's Club Work. She was elected vice-president of the State Federation in 1923 and, in 1927, was elected president. O\u2019Berry's literacy committee sponsored an Educational Pilgrimage to Washington. It was recognized as one of the most outstanding projects of adult education in the United States. She was later named the vice-chair of the state executive committee of the Democratic Party in 1930. Three years later, in 1933, O\u2019Berry became one of the few women to administer a state emergency relief agency as she became the administrator of the Civil Works Commission. The Civil Works Commission later became the North Carolina Emergency Relief Administration (NCERA). O\u2019Berry continued to remain in-charge of an offshoot of NCERA, called the Rural Rehabilitation Corporation, until her death. This offshoot provided loans to farmers. Through her diplomacy, O\u2019Berry provided both direct and indirect relief to many citizens. == Legacy == Annie Land O\u2019Berry worked to help clubwomen overcome indifference to civic responsibility. She inspired them to be civic-minded and to work for the advancement of adult education. She was viewed as \u2018the little soldier,\u2019 \u2018relief lady,\u2019 and a symbol of \u2018food for the hungry, homes for the weary and a new chance for the discouraged.\u2019 Although she had no children of her own, O\u2019Berry raised her grand-nephew and grand-niece as her own. == References == == External links == Category:People from Edgecombe County, North Carolina Category:Activists from North Carolina Category:Columbia University School of Social Work alumni Category:William Peace University alumni Category:American philanthropists Category:1885 births Category:1944 deaths ",
