    "text": "Lucretia is a painting by the Italian baroque artist Artemisia Gentileschi. It depicts Lucretia, the wife of Roman consul and general Tarquinus, at the moment of her suicide. The decision to take her own life was made after she was blackmailed and raped by a fellow soldier of Tarquinus. It is one of a number of paintings of Gentileschi that focus on virtuous women ill-treated by men. The painting was painted between 1623 and 1625. It is currently in the collection of Gerolamo Etro, Milan. Gentileschi also painted another canvas on the same topic, much later in her career; this painting is now in the Neues Palais, Potsdam == References == Category:Paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi Category:Paintings of Lucretia Category:1620s paintings ",
