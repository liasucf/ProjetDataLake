    "text": "Dennis Flood, a Republican, was a mayor of the Village of Irvington, New York from 1994 to 2006. Before his election to mayor in 1994, Flood served on the village board from 1991 and formerly served as the chief financial officer for a local law firm. The controversial 2005 mayoral election was decided on October 27, 2005 by random lots in Flood's favor after the Court of Appeals, New York State's highest court, ruled that the result of the ballots were a tie. Flood and Democratic challenger Erin Malloy had battled the election (originally held March 15, 2005) in various state courts. == External links == * Newspaper story about the 2005 election Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Mayors of places in New York (state) Category:People from Irvington, New York Category:American chief financial officers ",
