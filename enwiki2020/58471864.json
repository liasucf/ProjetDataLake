He was a lieutenant general, military councillor of state, envoy extraordinary to Cologne, ambassador extraordinary to Savoy in 1700, and then governor general of the French West Indies. ==Life== Raymond Balthazar Ph\u00e9lypeaux was a member of the Ph\u00e9lypeaux family. His grandfather, Raymond Ph\u00e9lypeaux, was secretary of state for foreign affairs. His father, Antoine Ph\u00e9lypeaux (died 1665), seigneur du Verger, secretary of state, was a counselor in the Parlement, intendant of justice in Bourbonnais and councillor of state. His mother, Marie de Villebois (-1701), was the daughter of Jacques de Villebois, the king's Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel. Raymond Balthazar Ph\u00e9lypeaux became an army officer, and was appointed lieutenant-general of the king's armies. He later became a military councillor of state. As a diplomat he was envoy extraordinary to the Prince-Elector of Cologne until 1699. Ph\u00e9lypeaux was sent as ambassador extraordinary to Savoy in 1700, where he found that a secret treaty was being prepared against the interests of France. He had difficulty convincing his minister of this, and attracted the enmity of Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of Savoy, wife of Louis, Duke of Burgundy and daughter of Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia. He took a haughty and mocking attitude at the court of Savoy, and was disgraced. Saint-Simon said of him that he has a \"spirit like a hundred devils.\" In 1709 Ph\u00e9lypeaux was appointed governor general of the Antilles. He did not reach Martinique until early 1711 and died there on 21 October 1713. He never married. His brother Jacques-Antoine Ph\u00e9lypeaux was appointed bishop of Lod\u00e8ve in 1690. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * ==Further reading== * Category:1655 births Category:1713 deaths Category:French generals Category:Ambassadors of France Category:Governors general of the French Antilles ",
