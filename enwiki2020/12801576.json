The Dodgers drafted 51 players in this draft, the largest collection of players they had ever drafted in one draft. Of those, ten of them would eventually play Major League baseball. The top pick in this years draft was right-handed pitcher Dan Opperman from Valley High School in Las Vegas, Nevada. However, Opperman injured his arm pitching in the state high school playoffs his Senior season and would not be able to pitch professionally until 1989. He would eventually play in parts of four seasons with the Dodgers farm teams in Vero Beach, San Antonio and the last two with the AAA Albuquerque Dukes. In 63 games (all but one as a starter) he had a record of 19-22 and an ERA of 3.95. None of the players from this years draft would leave much of an impression on the Majors. Pitchers Dennis Springer and Mike James had the longest careers, but were just average players at best. {| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:inherit\" |- ! 1987 Draft Picks |- | 1987 Los Angeles Dodgers Picks in the MLB June Amateur Draft {| class=\"wikitable\" !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Round !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Name !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Position !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|School !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Signed !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Career span !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Highest level |- |1 |Dan Opperman |RHP |Valley High School |Yes |1989\u20131992 |AAA |- |2 |Donald Carroll |OF |Granite Hills High School |Yes |1988\u20131999 |A+ |- |3 |Chris Nichting |RHP |Northwestern University |Yes |1988\u20132002 |MLB |- |4 |Thomas Demerit |OF |Dartmouth College |Yes |1987\u20131988 | A |- |5 |Luis Martinez |SS |Old Dominion University |Yes |1987\u20131993 |AAA |- |6 |Darrin Fletcher |C |University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign |Yes |1987\u20132002 |MLB |- |7 |Tony Barron |3B |Willamette University |Yes |1987\u20132002 |MLB |- |8 |Howie Freiling |1B |University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill |Yes | 1987\u20131990 | AAA |- |9 |Lem Luckham |RHP |Los Amigos High School |Yes |1987\u20131992 | AA |- |10 |Douglas Noch |RHP |Central Michigan University |Yes | 1987\u20131989 | A |- |11 |Lawrence Gonzalez |RHP |Don Antonio Lugo High School |Yes |1987\u20131989 |A- |- |12 |Barry Blackwell |C |Florida State University |No Indians-1988 |1988\u20131990 | AA |- |13 |Sherman Collins |RHP |University of Oklahoma |Yes |1987 | A |- |14 |D.
