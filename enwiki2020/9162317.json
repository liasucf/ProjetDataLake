Currently an eight-piece, they have been influenced by the likes of Les N\u00e9gresses Vertes and combine traditional French sounds (complete with accordion) with sounds of gypsy, Latin, ska, punk and energetic rock. ==History== * The story began in Bordeaux in 1995, where a band of four friends pillaged bars and stages there. The group constantly evolved until it stabilised at its current membership. The group then toured festivals throughout France (Bourges, La Rochelle, Rennes). * In 1998, HDL recorded their first album, Le caf\u00e9 des jours heureux. * Meeting Les Ogres de Barback led to buying a big tent, \"Latcho Drom\", which travelled the roads of France and elsewhere. * In 2000, HDL finished up their second album La belle affaire. * In 2001, HDL and the Ogres united for a tour, which give birth to the famous album Live. * At the start of 2003, their third album, Ouest terne, was released, and the group set out again, this time in the company of the Germans 17 Hippies. * At the start of 2004, this Franco-German collaboration recorded a 6-track EP, Hardcore Trobadors. * In 2005, HDL released a live album of their last tour. * On 13 March 2006, they released the album Temps suspendu. * On 20 April 2009, they released a double album 13 ans de caravaning, a combined \"best of\" and unreleased tracks.
