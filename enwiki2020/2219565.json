    "text": "Pulse Asia Research Inc. is a public opinion polling body in the Philippines. It was founded by Professor Emeritus Felipe B. Miranda (M.A. Political Science, University of Chicago) of the University of the Philippines Diliman. Pulse Asia Inc. was founded in 1999 as a for-profit private company. In 2013, the company re-formed as nonprofit organization and changed their name to Pulse Asia Research Inc. == Ownership Dispute == Starting in late 2009, Pulsa Asia was accused of publishing biased or inaccurate polling, and of having close ties with Benigno Aquino III, who was elected President of the Philippines in May 2010. SEC documents and a research paper indicated that Rafael Cojuangco Lopa and Antonio \"Tonyboy\" Cojuangco, blood relatives of Aquino, were involved in the establishment of Pulse Asia as well as Social Weather Stations, another polling group. Senatorial candidate Francisco \"Kit\" Tatad claimed Aquino was using these connections to his advantage, stating, \"This suggests that there was a plan from the beginning by the Aquinos to control public opinion polling in the country.\" In October 2013, Pulse Asia issued a press release responding to these allegations. They stated that Cojuangco and Lopa were involved in establishing Pulse Asia in 1999, but were never involved in the research work of the organization, and no longer have shares in the company. == State Propaganda Tool == Since 2016, Pulse Asia was tagged as a propaganda tool by several organizations due to their timely, ironic release of surveys that seems to improve the optics of the Duterte government amid on-going crisis and social unrest resulting from corruption scandals and gross ineptitude. Furthermore, amid controversial issues, Pulse Asia has consistently delivered pro-Duterte surveys that is meant to convince the public that Duterte's actions are supported by majority of the Filipinos despite being non-factual, vague and general on the headlines it releases to the press. Due to this, several prominent politicians have sued Pulse Asia for publishing misleading surveys that's meant to politically attack election candidates and various politicians. == See also == * Politics of the Philippines * Social Weather Stations == References == == External links == * Category:Market research companies of the Philippines Category:Public opinion research companies Category:Companies based in Quezon City Category:Aquino family Category:2010 Philippine presidential election Category:Benigno Aquino III ",
