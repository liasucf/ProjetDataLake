    "text": "Neena Gupta is an associate professor at the Statistics and Mathematics Unit of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata. Her primary fields of interest are commutative algebra and affine algebraic geometry. Gupta was previously a visiting scientist at the ISI and a visiting fellow at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). She has won Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar award in the category of mathematical sciences, the highest honour in India in the field of science and technology. Gupta received the Indian National Science Academy Young Scientist award in 2014 for the solution she proposed to the Zariski Cancellation Problem in positive characteristic. Her work on the conjecture had also earned her the inaugural Saraswathi Cowsik Medal in 2013, awarded by the TIFR Alumni Association. == Education == Gupta graduated with honours in Mathematics from Bethune College in 2006. She earned her Post Graduation in Mathematics from the ISI in 2008 and subsequently, her Ph.D. degree in 2011 with algebraic geometry as her specialization, under the guidance of Professor Amartya Kumar Dutta.
