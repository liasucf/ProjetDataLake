    "text": "is an adult Japanese visual novel developed by Hooksoft which was released on June 13, 2003 for Windows as a CD. Subsequent enhanced ports to the Dreamcast as Orange Pocket: Cornet and to the PlayStation 2 as Orange Pocket: Root were released. Both ports feature their own exclusive characters and new scenarios not in the original Windows release. Limited editions of these versions were also released which contained a drama CD and a booklet with sketches and artwork of the girls in the game. The gameplay in Orange Pocket follows a plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the female main characters. The story revolves around Hideaki Eda, who is enjoying a life in the country somewhere in Japan. His childhood friend moves from the city he used to live in to where he lives now and starts attending his school. She adapts to a rural life quickly and soon things start to become noisier as Hideaki begins to hang out with more girls from his school. Other versions of the game followed, which were playable as a DVD TV game, and on FOMA mobile phones. The Windows version has been updated several times, ending with version 1.10 on September 29, 2006. Three light novels based on Orange Pocket were released between October 2003 and April 2004 written by J\u014dji Kamio. ==Gameplay== The gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent on simply reading the text that will appear on the screen; this text represents either dialogue between the various characters, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often, the player will come to a \"decision point\" where he or she is given the chance to choose from options that are displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. During these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction, depending on which choice the player makes. There are ten main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Eight heroines are from the original game, and the last two come from the console versions, though both versions only get one of those two heroines; therefore, there are nine heroines in the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 versions. In order to view the plot lines to their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points in order to further the plot in an alternate direction. ==Plot== Orange Pocket's story takes place in a rural area in Japan near a large mountain and river. The protagonist, Hideaki Eda, is attending and is experiencing an enjoyable life. One day, Hideaki's childhood friend Nazuna Ayase returns from the city and starts attending his school. She adapts to a rural life quickly and soon things start to become noisier as Hideaki begins to hang out with more girls from his school. ==Characters== ===Main characters=== ; :Hideaki is the protagonist of the story, and is the person the player assumes. As a child, he lived in the city, which is where he met Nazuna Ayase. His parents were transferred due to their jobs, and he had to leave the city for a rural area. Soon after moving, he becomes close friends with Kazan, Madoka, Eru, and Sakino. After moving, Hideaki became very carefree due to his new friends and the laid-back nature of the town. ; :Voiced by: Minami Hokuto :Nazuna is a childhood friend of Hideaki and at the beginning of the story transfers schools and comes to attend the same school as him. Her appearance, since she grew up in the city, gives her a contrast to those who grew up in the rural area where the story takes place, but she is very sociable and cheerful.

She has excellent reflexes and always gets above-average grades in school. ; : :Minori is in a grade below Hideaki, and is a close friend to Eru Kurosaki. She is very gentle and quiet, liking to do things at her own pace. She has the special skill to go to sleep anywhere, so she always carries around her favorite pillow.

This gives her a gloomy appearance, but she is just constantly thinking about things. ; : :Kiriko is one of Hideaki's classmates, though she does not appear in the beginning of the story. This is due to her liking to be alone and thus gives her a cool type of personality. She does have some friends at school, but she is basically alone most of the time.

He has an honest and diligent personality and will always show courtesy to others. He had respect for his grandfather while he was still alive; he was a martial arts master. His grandfather had taught him this skill, which gave him a roughneck label at one point. After Hideaki initially moved, Kazan and him were at odds with each other, but gradually they became good friends. Hiiragi Tachibana is his fianc\u00e9, and he loves her dearly. ; : :Hiiragi is one of Hideaki's friends, and is Kazan's future wife-to-be.
