AllMusic's John Bush hailed it as \"an excellent work\", with a production style that \"emphasizes deep grooves and clipped beats with a polished sheen that takes Tribe's jazz-rap into the age of quiet storm and fusion.\" Bush also called Q-Tip's rapping \"as smooth and inventive as ever.\" Colin Ross of PopMatters described it as \"a vibe-orientated affair\", noting that its \"infectious hooks, Jay Dee's trademark keys, and some seriously funky beats all work to create a captivating soundscape upon which Q-Tip drops his traditionally abstract rhymes.\" The Village Voices Robert Christgau felt that the album's production suited Q-Tip better than that of A Tribe Called Quest albums, stating, \"He gets stronger music out of hard beats than he ever did out of soft jazz.\" Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times sensed \"creative growth\" from Q-Tip, praising the album as \"an eclectic and enjoyable hip-hop experience.\" Writing for NME, John Mulvey initially believed that Amplified followed the mainstream \"millennial hip-hop formula to the point of near anonymity\", however, he concluded that it lived up to the high expectations of a Q-Tip album, calling the production a \"brilliant hybrid of the organic and the modernist.\" Kris Ex of Rolling Stone summed it up as \"stew-pot hip-hop \u2013 traditional blunts, broads and braggadocio filtered through Tip's abstract lens.\" Taylor M.
