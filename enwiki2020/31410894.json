It has been sold under a variety of other brands (most notably Vauxhall, Chevrolet, and Holden) and also spawned various other derivatives. == Corsa A (S83; 1982) == The front-wheel drive Opel Corsa was first launched in September 1982. It went on sale first in France, Italy, and Spain - markets where small cars represented from 34 to 43 percent of sales. Built-in Zaragoza, Spain, the first Corsas were three-door hatchback and two-door saloon models, with four-door and five-door versions arriving in 1984. In certain markets, commercial \"van\" models were also sold, with or without rear windows depending on local requirements. In mainland Europe, the saloon versions were known as the \"Corsa TR\" until May 1985 and received an egg-crate grille rather than the four slits used on hatchbacks. The saloons were intended to appeal to customers of the Opel Kadett C and its sister the Vauxhall Chevette who still desired a traditional 3-box sedan shape - but it did not sell particularly well in most of Europe but were popular in Spain and Portugal, among other markets. While only taking ten percent of French Corsa sales during the car's first half-year, the TR represented half of all Corsas sold in Spain. The basic trim level was called just the Corsa, which was followed by the Corsa Luxus, Corsa Berlina, and the sporty Corsa SR. The SR receives a spoiler which surrounds the rear window, alloy wheels, checkered sport seats, and a somewhat more powerful engine. Six years later, the Corsa received a facelift, which included a new front fascia and some other minor changes. The models were called LS, GL, GLS, and GT. The Corsa A was known in the United Kingdom market as the Vauxhall Nova (as it was considered that Corsa sounded too much like \"coarser\"), where it was launched in April 1983, following a seven-month-long union dispute due to British workers being angry about the car not being built there, in contrast to the rival Ford Fiesta, Austin Metro and Talbot Samba. In addition, there was also a dispute about the disparity of import tariffs, as while cars exported from Spain to the European Community were subject to tariffs of only 4.4 per cent, those exported in the other direction were subject to tariffs as high as 36.7 per cent.Motor Business, Volumes 109-116, 1982, page 55 Power first came from 1.0 L 45 hp, 1.2 L 55 hp, and 1.3 L 70 hp petrol engines. (The first engines were all equipped with carburetors; fuel injection came later, but never for the 1.0.) The engines were based on the well proven Family II design, except for the 1.0 L and early 1.2 L engines, which were based on the OHV unit from the Kadett C. There was also an Isuzu-built, 1.5 L turbo diesel engine available, which was also used in the Isuzu Gemini at around the same time. The diesel joined the line up in May 1987, at the Frankfurt Motor Show, along with the sporty GSi. The engines and most of the mechanical componentry were derived from those used in the Astra/Kadett. In September 1987 the Corsa received a light facelift, with a new grille that was now the same on hatchbacks and sedans, an updated interior, and other slight changes. For the 1989 model year, the 1.3 was bored out to 1.4 liters. Power remained the same, although torque increased. A rare \"Sport\" model was produced in 1985 to homologate for the sub 1,300 cc class of Group A for the British Rally Championship. These Sport models were white and came with unique vinyl decals, a 13SB engine with twin Weber 40 DCOE carburettors, an optional bespoke camshaft, a replacement rear silencer, and few luxuries. This gave 93 hp and a top speed of 112 mph (180 km/h) with a 0\u201360 mph time of 8.9 seconds. These are by far the rarest models (500 produced) and thus acquire a high market price if one does become available. A 1.6 L multi point fuel-injected engine with at 5600 rpm ( in the catalysed version) and capable of was added to the Corsa/Nova at the 1987 Frankfurt Motor Show, giving decent performance and being badged as a GSi (\"Nova GTE\" in pre-facelift models in the United Kingdom, later models were all called GSi). The GSi's engine mapping had been carried out by Opel tuning specialists Irmscher. A model with the 1.4 L multi- point fuel-injected engine, which was otherwise mechanically identical to the GSi, also became available as the Nova SRi in the United Kingdom. In January 1988, a turbocharged version of the Isuzu diesel engine was introduced, with power increased to . The design was freshened in September 1990, with new bumpers, headlights, grille, and interior, but it was clearly recognisable as a gentle makeover of an early 1980s design when it had to compete with the latest two all-new superminis in Europe \u2013 the Peugeot 106 and the Renault Clio.

It effectively replaced the aging Chevette, which finished production in January 1984. Nearly 500,000 Novas were sold in Britain over the next ten years, but by February 2016, only 1,757 were still on the road. In its best year, 1989, it was Britain's seventh best selling car with more than 70,000 sales. All Nova models were manufactured in Spain, with the first customers in the United Kingdom taking delivery of their cars in April 1983. It gave Vauxhall a much needed modern competitor in the supermini market in the United Kingdom, as the Chevette was older than the majority of its main competitors which consisted of the Ford Fiesta and the Austin Metro. With the late 1990 facelift a small van version arrived, called the Vauxhall Nova Van. Sales in the United Kingdom were strong right up to the end, but by the time the last Nova was built in the beginning of 1993, it was looking very dated in comparison to more modern rivals like the Peugeot 106 and the Renault Clio. Vauxhall dropped the Nova name in 1993 when their version of the Opel Corsa B made its debut, and later models were sold as the Vauxhall Corsa instead. This was the second Vauxhall to adopt the same model name as the Opel version, the first being the Senator. A television advert in 1986 featured the Ritchie Valens hit \"La Bamba\" playing in the background, and used CGI to allow a Nova to drive over vehicles in a busy city. Another advert from 1990 featured a Nova as a pet, CGI allowing it to jump through a traffic jam and briefly play a hotrod whilst stopped at traffic lights. The end featured a homage to Wacky Races, with the Nova laughing like Muttley. This advert featured Angus Deayton. Famous former owners of the Nova include: former rally driver Colin McRae and actor Sean Bean.

In May 1994, it was launched by Holden in Australia, as the Barina, replacing a version of the Suzuki Swift sold under that name. This proved a success, and was the first Spanish built car to be sold in significant volumes in the Australian market. Unlike the previous model, there was no saloon version for the European market, but one was designed in Brazil for the Latin American market, as saloons were much preferred to hatchbacks there. This was also introduced in South Africa and India. An estate car, panel van and pickup truck were also introduced, and a convertible version was produced for the Australian market, called the Holden Barina Cabrio. Italy was the only European country where the Argentinian built wagon version was offered. The Corsa also spawned a small coup\u00e9, named the Opel Tigra. Four cylinder power came from 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6 litre Family 1 petrol engines, as well as an economical 1.5 L turbodiesel engine. Most cars received a five speed manual transmission, although a four speed automatic was also available with certain engines. In the first few years, a four speed manual was also available coupled to the smallest 1.2 litre engine. 1.0 L three cylinder and 1.2 L four cylinder Family 0 economy version was launched in 1997, and a Lotus tuned suspension was added as well as an exterior refresh. The saloon model was built and sold in Latin America as the Chevrolet Corsa Classic until 2010 when it was replaced with the model previously released for China in 2005 as the Buick Sail. A budget version introduced for the Brazilian market, the Chevrolet Celta, has bodywork resembling the end of the 1990s Vectra and Astra. The Celta was sold in Argentina as the Suzuki Fun for a certain period. In 2011, General Motors stopped representing Suzuki in Argentina, so the Celta reverted to its original name under the Chevrolet brand. Argentinian production began in September 1997, where it was the first locally built Chevrolet passenger car since 1978. The Latin American Corsa received a small facelift in 1999, with smoother bumpers, and from April 2002 (when the new Corsa II was introduced) the Corsa B began being marketed as the \"Corsa Classic\" until 2010, where it became the \"Classic\" when the Corsa B derived Chevrolet Sail and Chevrolet Celta replaced it. Production finally ceased in October 2016.https://tn.com.ar/autos/lo-ultimo/despues-de-18-anos- el-chevrolet-classi-dejo-de-fabricarse-en-argentina_746822 The saloon and estate car versions were produced in China by Shanghai GM as Buick Sail and Buick Sail S-RV, respectively from June 2001 to February 2005. That year, they received a facelift and became known as the Chevrolet Sail and SRV. In September 2006, Chile became the first country outside China to receive the Chinese assembled Sail; it is called the Chevrolet Corsa Plus there, available as a four-door saloon with a 1.6 L engine. The Corsa Plus includes dual front airbags, anti-lock brakes, air conditioning, electric windows and central locking as standard equipment. In India, the hatchback, saloon and estate car versions were sold as the Corsa Sail, Corsa (or Corsa Joy) and Corsa Swing respectively until the end of 2005. The hatchback model was still being produced, and extensively marketed in South Africa as the Corsa Lite under the Opel branding until 2009; at which point it was discontinued. In Thailand, the Corsa was available as an Opel with a fuel-injected 8V 1.4-litre engine and \"Joy\" and \"Swing\" variants, both available with three or five-door and either a manual or an automatic gearbox.

For 2004 (after the Corsa C had been introduced in 2002), a Mexican designed and produced version of the hatchback and saloon, known as the Chevy C2, was released, which was also sold in Colombia. All Mexican previous versions were known as the Chevy, with the names Monza used on the saloon, and Swing (five-door) and Joy (three-door) for the hatchbacks, all with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder. There was also a low-end three-door model called the Chevy Popular, which was equipped with a 1.4-liter engine. The latter 2004 and 2008 redesigns were simply named Chevy and Chevy Sed\u00e1n. The Chevy was a favourite among taxicab drivers and one of the best selling cars in the country. The Chevy ended production at the end of August 2011, at the Ramos Arizpe assembly plant. This move was because the Chevy's sales had been dropping constantly since the beginning of 2010, and also because it didn't meet the new safety requirement rules in Mexico that forced it to have standard front airbags. The five-door hatchback was dropped after the 2010 model year, leaving only the four-door saloon and the three-door hatchback, this 3 door hatch being the most popular model. The Chevy was discontinued only a short run of 2012 models, after almost 18 years on the Mexican market. The successor for the three-door and saloon, the Chevrolet Sonic was also built in Ramos Arizpe starting 2012, while GM suddenly replaced the five-door Chevy with the Chevrolet Spark.

General Motors dubbed the new chassis Gamma, and intended to use it for a number of other models. A saloon version was also offered in Latin America, South Africa and the Middle East. The Brazilian version of the Corsa sold in those countries featured a more conservative front end than its European counterpart. Brazil also offered a pickup truck version of the Corsa named the Chevrolet Montana (sold in some markets as the Tornado), which, as well as the saloon, was exported in a completely knocked down form to South Africa for local assembly. GM South Africa marketed the hatchback simply as The New Corsa, and the pickup version as the Corsa Utility. In 2007, the Corsa C saloon was dropped in South Africa. The Corsa hatchback in South Africa did not have the same front fascia as the European Corsa. Instead, it had the same front fascia as the Latin American Chevrolet Corsa, possibly due to manufacturing costs. This car was 2001 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland. In Japan, where the car was sold through Yanase as the Opel Vita, production ended in April 2004, due to sluggish sales.

In 2005, the saloon version introduced a automated manual transmission called Easytronic because it was only offered in a five-speed manual transmission, however, the easytronic transmission was rapidly discontinued after the model year of 2007, because of poor sales and technical flaws. For 2008, the Corsa was tweaked with a freshened grille, lights, and a gold-coloured Chevrolet logo. The Chevrolet Corsa C was discontinued in the Mexican market in June 2008, leaving only the older and freshened Chevy (Corsa B); and the Corsa C was replaced by the Chevrolet Aveo, however, Brazil kept the car until 2012 (as the Chevrolet Corsa Final Edition and with the saloon ending in 2011) and Argentina kept the car until 2010, while the Corsa-based Montana continued into 2010 In 2002, the Corsa chassis spawned a mini MPV called the Opel Meriva, development of which began under Opel in R\u00fcsselsheim. The Corsa C was that was sold in South America, was produced at the Rosario production plant in Argentina. The Latin American Corsa C featured the Opel inspired Chevrolet logo with a golden bowtie instead of a chromed one \u2013 the new logo was first introduced in the South American market with the new Chevrolet Vectra.

Holden also imported the SRi version with the 1.8L Astra motor and uprated sports suspension including traction control, ABS brakes, a better tyre/wheel combination, and Irmscher body kit to produce a \"baby hot hatch\" Barina. The facelifted 2004 model was also imported; however, in December 2005, the Corsa C was suddenly dropped from the Australian and New Zealand Holden ranges as a cost-cutting measure by GM and was replaced by the Daewoo Kalos, rebadged as a Holden Barina. Motoring journalists were scathing in their criticism of the new model, particularly the bland handling, lackluster engine, and below-par safety features. The Kalos-based Barina was subsequently replaced with a rebadged version of the Chevrolet Sonic/Daewoo Kalos T300 until stocks ran out in early 2019. === United Kingdom === This generation of the Corsa was a huge success for Vauxhall in the United Kingdom, which is the most popular supermini and second most popular car overall in 2002, 2003 and 2004. It was also Britain's best-selling supermini in 2005, achieving third place overall, but in 2006 (the final year of production) it lost top place in the supermini sector after five years and was overtaken by the Ford Fiesta. Overall, it was Britain's fourth most popular car in 2006. === Engine specifications === The Corsa C was introduced with a 1.7 L DTI Ecotec turbodiesel engine supplied by Isuzu (Circle L) with 75 hp (55 kW). This was later joined by the 1.7 L DI Ecotec turbodiesel engine also supplied by Isuzu. The 1.7 L DI Ecotec did not include an intercooler and this reduced power to . From 2003, a new 1.3 L CDTI Ecotec turbodiesel engine was supplied by Fiat (MultiJet) which produced and a 1.7 L CDTI Ecotec turbodiesel was supplied by Isuzu which produced . This new 1.7 L CDTI Ecotec featured a variable geometry turbocharger. The 1.0 L and 1.2 L Ecotec Family 0 engines are carry overs from the Corsa B; the 1.4 L Family 1 engine was replaced with a new 1.4 L Family 0 model. The 1.8 L Family 1 engine is an upgrade for the previous 1.6 L 16 valve engine and produces and of torque. The edition with the 1.8 L engine was named Corsa GSi and was the predecessor of the new Corsa OPC. In 2003, Opel introduced updated versions of Family 0 engines with TwinPort technology, and the 1.2 L engine gained 30 cc, giving it . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\" |- ! colspan=\"7\"| Petrol engines |- !

The first official pictures of the Corsa D were released by Opel in May 2006. In the United Kingdom, What Car? awarded it 2007 Car of the Year. The Corsa D placed second in the European Car of the Year for 2006, only behind the Ford S-Max. The Corsa D is available in both three and five-door versions and marketed as the Vauxhall Corsa in the United Kingdom. The same engines sizes from the Corsa C were available at launch, although the 1.3 L CDTI and 1.7 L CDTI engines were upgraded, with power ranging from to . The OPC/VXR version went on sale in the beginning of 2007, with a 1.6 L turbocharged petrol engine powering the front wheels. The 1.3 CDTI engine was updated in the middle of 2007 to bring CO2 levels to just 119 g/km, meaning that twelve months' Vehicle Excise Duty in the United Kingdom costs \u00a330 and is eligible for the Plan 2000E (a rebate of \u20ac2000 in the purchase of a new car) in Spain. The car is also used as the villain car in Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show at Disney's Hollywood Studios. The Corsa D was briefly available in Australia under the Opel brand name, rather than as a Holden as the Corsa B and C had previously been, during Opel's short-lived foray into the Australian market. Less than a year after launching, Opel Australia announced it was ceasing operations, removing the Corsa from the Australian market. In addition to not being sold in the United States or Canada, the Corsa D was never available in Japan either, as Yanase had stopped importing the Opel Vita in April 2004, due to declining sales. Opel withdrew altogether from the Japanese market in December 2006, due to low sales the previous year. At an early stage of the Corsa D's development, one designer was tasked to design the outer panel for the glove box in the Corsa. Allegedly, his son suggested drawing a shark instead. The designer managed to hide it so well, on the hinge of the glove compartment that it was never removed, and featured on all production models. The custom of having a shark graphic in the interior continued for other Opel cars even after Opel has been taken over by PSA. File:Opel Corsa Edition 111 Jahre (D) \u2013 Heckansicht, 5.

Compared to the previous generation model, power output had increased by 15PS to 207PS (204 bhp) from 1.6 Turbo engine, with a maximum torque of 245 Nm (181 lb-ft) between 1900 and 5800 rpm. An overboost function increased torque to 280Nm (210 lb-ft) when needed. As a result, the Corsa OPC was able to sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 6.8 seconds and to reach a maximum speed of 230 km/h (143 mph). The Corsa OPC featured a sports chassis with Frequency Selective Damping (FSD) technology, which enabled the damping forces to adapt to the frequency of the car to balance sportiness with comfort. The suspension was lowered by 10mm (0.39 in) compared to standard Corsa models, and the car also received an optimised steering system with more direct and precise reactions. OPC also worked on the brakes, adding 308mm discs on the front axle. Opel also offered the Corsa OPC Performance Package, which included a mechanical multi-disc differential lock made by Drexler, 18-inch wheels with Michelin tires, and an even more athletic chassis set up. The package also brought a Brembo high- performance braking system with 330mm braking discs on the front axle. Styling-wise, the Corsa OPC/VXR received more aggressive body kits with new bumpers, aluminium frames for the fog lights, a small scoop in the hood, a big roof spoiler, and twin-pipe Remus exhaust with a diffuser. Inside, the Recaro performance seats took centre stage, with other upgrades including the flat- bottomed leather steering wheel, OPC gear knob, and sports pedals, as well as OPC design instruments. Up until January 2020, El Grande, AKA Robby H could be seen cruising around Irlam in the finest example of a 2012 Arden blue Corsa VXR. === Engines === Under the bonnet, all new 1.0-litre three-cylinder ECOTEC engine \u2013 the direct-injection turbo offered 90 PS or 115 PS \u2013 both giving 170Nm of torque \u2013 with a six-speed manual 'box, while a new six-speed auto was optional on selected engines. Start/Stop tech as standard and, in three-door guise, the lower-powered model could hit sub-100g/km CO2 emissions. The entry- level engine was a 70 PS 1.2-litre petrol, while turbo and non-turbo 1.4s offered 100 PS and 90 PS respectively. The 1.3 CDTI continued with 75PS, now hitting as little as 85g/km CO2 emissions, and was capable of 3,2l/100km economy. An ecoFLEX version was available from launch, too, with target CO2 emissions of under 85g/km. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\" |- !colspan=7|Petrol engines |- style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\" !Model !Engine !Displacement !Power !Torque !Note ! emissions |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1.0T SIDI S/S||rowspan=\"2\"| I3||rowspan=\"2\"|999 cc|| at 3700\u20136000 rpm|| at 1800\u20133700 rpm||||102\u2013100 g/km |- | at 5000\u20136000 rpm|| at 1800\u20134500 rpm||||115\u2013114 g/km |- |1.2||rowspan=\"4\"| I4||1229 cc|| at 5600 rpm|| at 4000 rpm||Only Available for short time after release in hatchbacks then the engine was dropped in 2018||126\u2013124 g/km |- |1.4||1398 cc|| at 6000 rpm|| at 4000 rpm||||114\u2013129 g/km |- |1.4 Turbo||1364 cc|| at 3500\u20136000 rpm|| at 1850\u20133500 rpm||||122\u2013119 g/km |- |1.6 Turbo (B16LER)||1598 cc|| at 5850 rpm|| (overboost ) at 1900\u20135800 rpm||OPC/VXR||174 g/km |- !colspan=7|Diesel engines |- style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text- align:center; vertical-align:middle;\" !Model !Engine !Displacement !Power !Torque !Note ! emissions |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1.3 CDTI S/S||rowspan=\"2\"|I4||rowspan=\"2\"|1248 cc|| at 3750 rpm|| at 1500\u20132500 rpm||||100\u201399 g/km |- | at 3750 rpm|| at 1500\u20132500 rpm||||82\u2013101 g/km |} == Corsa F (2019) == The original project of Corsa F was being initially planned to be released in the third quarter of 2017 on a GM platform (reportedly, the G2XX), but the project was cancelled due to Groupe PSA's acquisition of the Opel and Vauxhall marques. Development was then restarted after switching to the PSA CMP (EMP1) platform in 2017.https://drivemag.com/news/the-all-new- opel-corsa-f-comes-on-a-psa-platform-in-2019 This is also known as the Peugeot 208 Common Modular Platform (hence \"CMP\"). The Corsa is thus the first of the Opel/Vauxhall model developed under the PSA ownership. === Corsa-e === In December 2018, Opel announced the launch of an electric version of the Corsa, called the Corsa-e, which was originally planned to go on sale in 2019, with a price close to \u20ac20,000.https://int-media.opel.com/en/big-anniversary-and- electrification-opel-looks-ahead-2019#prettyPhoto but was delayed into the second quarter of 2020. The main competitors to the Corsa-e were expected to be the Nissan Leaf and the Renault Zoe. The electric motor produces and of torque, and a 0-100 km/h acceleration takes 8.1 seconds. The standard Corsa F is almost identical to the electric version, with the exception of different alloy wheel designs and the exhaust. The interior will include a touchscreen infotainment system with two set-ups are available; seven-inch Multimedia Navi system or 10-inch Multimedia Navi Pro. === Specifications and engines === The Corsa F supermini marks the arrival of new petrol and diesel engines as well as an all-electric Corsa-e into the range. Two petrol engines and one diesel engine are available, starting with the 1.2-litre three-cylinder engine that produces 75 bhp and comes with a five-speed manual gearbox as standard. Sitting above is a three-cylinder 1.2-litre turbo PureTech engine which is shared with Peugeot and Citroen models and produces 99 bhp and 205 Nm of torque. It comes with a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic gearbox option. The diesel engine is a BlueHDi 1.5-litre four-cylinder diesel, producing 99 bhp and 250 Nm of torque. Weight of the car is also improved, with lightweight underpinnings, redesigned bodyshell and new aluminium engines which Opel claims 10 percent of kerb weight have been reduced across the range and will have a good balance between sportiness and comfort. The body is constructed from a range of high-strength steels, saving a total of 40 kg over the seventh-generation model. A new aluminium bonnet will also replace the previous generation's steel unit, saving a further 2.4 kg. However, the Corsa is slightly larger than its predecessor, with a larger body and longer wheelbase to allocate more interior and boot space. Opel's latest range of aluminium three-cylinder petrol and diesel engines are projected to save around 15 kg over the predecessor four-cylinder units. 10 kg has been reduced off the seats, losing 5.5 kg at the front and 4.5 kg at the rear, totalling around 108 kg of weight reduction. In June 2019 it was revealed that first deliveries were scheduled to start in April 2020, while the pure-electric model was planned to follow at a time that has not yet been announced. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\" |- ! colspan=\"6\" |Petrol engines |- style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical- align:middle;\" !Model !Engine !Displacement !Power !Torque ! emissions |- |1.2|| rowspan=\"3\" |I3|| rowspan=\"3\" |1199 cc|| at 5750 rpm|| at 2750 rpm||125\u2013126 g/km |- |1.2 Turbo|| at 5000 rpm|| at 1750 rpm||134\u2013135 g/km |- |1.2 Turbo|| at 5500 rpm|| at 1750 rpm||N/A |- ! colspan=\"6\" |Diesel engine |- style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\" !Model !Engine !Displacement !Power !Torque ! emissions |- |1.5 PSA DV5 BlueHDI||I4||1499 cc|| at 3500 rpm|| at 1750 rpm||109\u2013110 g/km |- ! colspan=\"6\" |Electric (Corsa-e) |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Battery capacity !Power !Torque !All-electric range |- | colspan=\"3\" |50 kWh | | | |} File:2019 Vauxhall Corsa SE NAV 1.2 Front.jpg|Vauxhall Corsa File:2019 Vauxhall Corsa SE NAV 1.2 Rear.jpg File:Opel Corsa-e IMG 3329.jpg|Opel Corsa-e File:2019 Vauxhall Corsa SRi 1.2 Interior.jpg|Interior of a 2019 Vauxhall Corsa == Corsa Van == The Corsa Van is a car derived van based on the corresponding generation of the Corsa superminis.

This was replaced by a flat metal loading floor. Payload of the original Corsa A is and the entire range of engines was available at first. It was usually marketed under the names used in various countries, such as Corsa Lieferwagen (Germany), Bestelwagen (Dutch), or Fourgonnette (French). The Vauxhall version is called the \"Corsavan\" since 1994, linking it to the earlier Astravan model. Earlier models were called Vauxhall Novavan in the United Kingdom. Corsa Van variants of later generation Corsas have also been sold under the Opel/Vauxhall brand.
