The original name should come from Reinhartingen. On the Schleissheimer Stra\u00dfe, in the 19th Century, some colonists settled there. The Bavarian Army's ammunition depot known as Pulverturm, is also said to exists there since 1838. The district is named after the so-called \"Reichskleinsiedlung\" Am Hart, which was built by the National Socialists from 1933 onwards. A decision by the town council on the 10 October 1933, foresaw the construction of a Reichskleinsiedlung next to Ingolst\u00e4dter Strasse, which was to receive the official name \"Am Hart\". The settlement was opened on 8 September 1936. Approximately 340 nearly identical single-family homes for workers were created around the area on Ingolst\u00e4dter Stra\u00dfe. After the Second World War the additional \"Reichskleinsiedlung\" was canceled. Until the end of the 1980s, the Panzerwiese was used by the military. Since 2003, more than 2,500 new apartments have been built in the Nordhaide. With the Dominikuszentrum, the Mira shopping center, the cultural center 2411 and the school center Nordhaide the appropriate infrastructure was created. == References == Category:Quarters of Munich ",
