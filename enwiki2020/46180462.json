    "text": "The Dr. Charles Fox Brown House is a historic house at 420 Drennan Street in Van Buren, Arkansas. It is a single story brick structure, whose main block is five bays wide, with a small secondary block set back from the front at the left, and an ell extending to the rear. It has a side-gable roof, with a front-facing gable above the centered entrance, which is further sheltered by a flat-roof portico supported by four columns. The eaves are studded with brackets, and there are a pair of round-arch windows in the front-facing gable. The house was built in 1867 for Dr. Charles Fox Brown, and is unusual for the original 19th-century surgery, located in the secondary block. The house is stylistically a distinctive blend of Greek Revival and Italianate styles. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Crawford County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Greek Revival houses in Arkansas Category:Victorian architecture in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1867 Category:Houses in Crawford County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Crawford County, Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures in Van Buren, Arkansas ",
