He was part of the Dutch Under-21 team to win the 2007 Under-21 European Football Championship. ==Club career== Waterman started his career at SC Heerenveen, debuting in 2004. After being loaned to AZ Alkmaar for half a year he completed a transfer in April 2007. On 10 February 2007, Waterman played his first Eredivisie match for AZ against Willem II. He made his European debut in AZ's 3\u20133 draw against Fenerbahce (UEFA Cup) on 14 February 2007. In August 2008, he was given by AZ Alkmaar on loan to ADO Den Haag. On 22 February 2010, he joined Viking FK on loan until August. However, the loan deal was cancelled because of a groin injury. After that period Waterman played for De Graafschap, again on loan from AZ Alkmaar. In July 2011, he joined German club Alemannia Aachen, appearing in 30 competitive matches with the club. After Aachen was eventually relegated, he left on a free transfer to PSV Eindhoven. Waterman began the 2012\u201313 season as PSV's second-choice goalkeeper, behind Przemys\u0142aw Tyto\u0144. However, after five league games, Waterman was promoted to first-choice goalkeeper by manager Dick Advocaat. On 9 July 2015, Waterman signed a two-year contract with Cypriot club APOEL FC. He made his APOEL debut on 14 July 2015, in his team's 0\u20130 home draw against FK Vardar for the second qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League. At the end of the season he crowned champion for the first time in his career, as APOEL managed to win the Cypriot First Division title for a fourth time in the row. On 15 May 2017, Waterman signed a two-year contract extension with APOEL, running until June 2019. ==International career== Born in the Netherlands, Waterman is of Surinamese descent. In 2007 Waterman was called up by Jong Oranje coach Foppe de Haan to be part of his squad for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship held in the Netherlands. Waterman was De Haan's first goalkeeper for the tournament and helped his team in their first match against Israel to a 1\u20130 victory. He also started in their second match against Portugal but was substituted by Kenneth Vermeer in the first half with a back injury. The match against Portugal was eventually won and the Dutch managed to qualify for the semi finals of the tournament as well as for the 2008 Summer Olympics. In the semi finals Waterman returned on the pitch and The Netherlands eliminated England after a 1\u20131 draw with 13\u201312 in a penalty shootout with 32 penalty kicks taken, with Waterman stopping three English penalties and scoring one himself. The Dutch went on to retain their 2006 title by beating Serbia 4\u20131 in the final. ==Club statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Heerenveen |2004\u201305 | rowspan=\"2\" |Eredivisie |5||0||||||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||0 |- |2005\u201306 |11||0||||||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||11||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !16!!0!!!!!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!16!!0 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |AZ |2006\u201307 | rowspan=\"2\" |Eredivisie |11||0||||||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||11||0 |- |2007\u201308 |23||0||||||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||23||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !34!!0!!!!!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!34!!0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|ADO Den Haag |2008\u201309 | rowspan=\"2\" |Eredivisie |10||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||11||0 |- |2009\u201310 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !10!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!11!!0 |- |De Graafschap |2010\u201311 |Eredivisie |33||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||34||0 |- |Alemannia Aachen |2011\u201312 |2.Bundesliga |30||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||31||0 |- |PSV |2012\u201313 |Eredivisie |29||0||5||0||7||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||41||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Karab\u00fckspor |2013\u201314 | rowspan=\"2\" |S\u00fcper Lig |34||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||34||0 |- |2014\u201315 |21||0||0||0||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !55!!0!!0!!0!!4!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!59!!0 |- | rowspan=\"5\" |APOEL |2015\u201316 | rowspan=\"4\" |Cypriot First Division |20||0||1||0||12||0||1||0||34||0 |- |2016\u201317 |34||0||1||0||16||0||0||0||51||0 |- |2017\u201318 |5 |0 |0 |0 |8 |0 |0 |0 |13 |0 |- |2018\u201319 |21||0||2||0||8||0||1||0||32||0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !80!!0!!4!!0!!44!!0!!2!!0!!130!!0 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !287!!0!!12!!0!!55!!0!!2!!0!!356!!0 |} ==Honours== ;PSV Eindhoven *Johan Cruijff Shield (1): 2012 ;APOEL *Cypriot First Division (4): 2015\u201316, 2016\u201317, 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319 ;Netherlands U-21 *UEFA European Under-21 Championship (1): 2007 ==References== ==External links== * * * * Boy Waterman Interview Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:People from Lelystad Category:Dutch people of Surinamese descent Category:Dutch footballers Category:Dutch expatriate footballers Category:Netherlands under-21 international footballers Category:Netherlands youth international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:SC Heerenveen players Category:AZ Alkmaar players Category:ADO Den Haag players Category:De Graafschap players Category:Alemannia Aachen players Category:PSV Eindhoven players Category:Kardemir Karab\u00fckspor footballers Category:APOEL FC players Category:Eredivisie players Category:2.
