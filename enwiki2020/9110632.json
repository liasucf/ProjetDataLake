    "text": "Infusion is an inverted steel roller coaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach, Lancashire, England. It is a 689m standard \"Mark 3\" model Vekoma Suspended Looping Coaster (SLC) and the first to be suspended entirely over water. ==History== Traumatizer at Pleasureland Southport Infusion was relocated from Pleasureland Southport, Blackpool Pleasure Beach's sister park where it was known as Traumatizer. When Pleasureland closed in 2005, the ride was dismantled and moved to its current location where it has operated since. The original ride featured a red track with teal supports, however the track has since been repainted Persian Blue and the supports Midnight Blue . The ride has operated (both in its original and new form) since 1999 and cost a total of \u00a38 million to construct. ==Aesthetics== Infusion's structural support. Infusion was built and manufactured by Vekoma Rides Manufacturing based in the Netherlands. It is one of many 689m standard model SLC's found in amusement parks around the world. Riders are seated in eight rows of two for a total of 16 passengers per train with 2 trains being operated at any given time. Most Vekoma SLC's are capable of running up to 10 cars on each train however Vekoma modeled Infusion with only 8 to make the ride both smoother and faster. The ride can carry up to 832 riders per hour when both trains are in operation. The ride is decorated with water jets and fountains and at night is illuminated by floodlighting. Infusion can be found to the right of the Big Dipper on the Watson Overpass and guests must be between 132 cm and 200 cm to ride. ==Design & Layout== The ride begins with the train climbing a lift hill before arching into a steep curved incline. The train rises up into a butterfly loop- two half loops connected by a corkscrew - before pulling upwards into a banked apex. From here the train drops sharply into a sidewinder - a loop that transitions into a corkscrew. A tight helix follows, providing a near miss with the Big Dipper, before the train straightens itself and pulls into a double inline twist. From here the train rolls into a 90 degree turn before pulling downwards and ascending into the brakes. Two 90 degree turns return the train to the station. ==Marketing & Reception== The ride was the subject of a large marketing campaign and featured on BBC Newsround, the Daily Star and Daily Express newspapers and GMTV. The ride has been used in television shows and advertisements. The ride was featured in a Specsavers advertisement when two elderly people rode the ride after mistaking the ride's train for a park bench. == External links == * Pleasure Beach, Blackpool website * Press release * BBC News \"Pleasure Beach's New Thrill Ride Category:Steel roller coasters Category:Blackpool Pleasure Beach Category:Roller coasters in the United Kingdom Category:Roller coasters introduced in 2007 ",
