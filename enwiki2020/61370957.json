    "text": "Nazar\u00e9 is a Portuguese telenovela which began airing on SIC in 9 September 2019. == Plot == Nazar\u00e9 is a force of nature. Young, determined, strong and willing to do almost anything to save her mother's life, which depends on an expensive surgery. At the fisherman's village, blessed with the big waves, where Nazar\u00e9 lives, she does some hard work to save up some money. Boyfriend and childhood sweetheart Toni is always there to back her up. Wood industry mogul and owner of Atlantida, Ant\u00f3nio Blanco, will discover his brother and business partner F\u00e9lix is stealing money from the company. From confidence to complete distrust, Ant\u00f3nio will order his brother to move out of his home and leave the business. But F\u00e9lix and wife Ver\u00f3nica have a plan: they order a forest fire that will impact everyone's lives. One love is forged by fire and one death will change everything. Toni knows that the fire will happen. He was hired to set it. He also knows that the Blanco's house will be empty so he convinces Nazar\u00e9 to come along with him to loot whatever they can, and she ends up being caught by surveillance cameras... During the robbery, and in the middle of the fire, Nazare ends up saving Duarte's life, the spoiled playboy of the family, whom Felix wanted to kill along with his father, once he would (and will) inherit the company's presidency. The closeness between Nazar\u00e9 and Duarte will become the perfect motto for Felix to make Nazar\u00e9 an offer she can't refuse: to befriend Duarte in exchange for her mother's treatments. == Cast == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" ! rowspan=\"3\" | Actor/Actress ! rowspan=\"3\" | Characters ! colspan=\"3\" | Seasons |- ! colspan=\"2\" | 1 ! rowspan=\"2\" | 2 |- ! 1.1 ! 1.2 |- |Carolina Loureiro |Nazar\u00e9 Gomes Blanco | colspan=\"3\" |- |Jos\u00e9 Mata |Duarte Tavares Blanco | colspan=\"3\" |- |Afonso Pimentel |Ant\u00f3nio \u00abToni\u00bb Augusto Silva | colspan=\"3\" |- |Tiago Teot\u00f3nio Pereira |Rui Tavares Blanco | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Manuela Couto |Nat\u00e1lia Tavares Blanco | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Margarida Serrano |Alice Moreira | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Sandra Barata Belo |Ver\u00f3nica Andrade Telles Blanco | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Albano Jer\u00f3nimo |F\u00e9lix Blanco | | | |- |Filipa Areosa |B\u00e1rbara Soares Blanco | | | |- |Cust\u00f3dia Gallego |Matilde dos Santos Gomes | colspan=\"3\" |- |Rog\u00e9rio Samora |Joaquim Gomes/Carlos Sampaio | colspan=\"3\" |- |Carla Andrino |Dolores Soares Gomes | colspan=\"3\" |- |Joana Aguiar |\u00c9rica Telles Blanco | colspan=\"3\" |- |Guilherme Moura |Bernardo Maria Telles Blanco | colspan=\"3\" |- |Raquel Sampaio |Ol\u00edvia Clara Dias Pereira | colspan=\"3\" |- |Ruy de Carvalho |Floriano Marques | colspan=\"3\" |- |M\u00e1rcia Breia |Ermelinda Marques | colspan=\"3\" |- |Carlos Areia |Jo\u00e3o Pereira | colspan=\"3\" |- |Lu\u00edsa Cruz |Gl\u00f3ria Silva | colspan=\"3\" |- |Tiago Aldeia |Ismael Pinto | colspan=\"3\" |- |Jo\u00e3o Maneira |Cristiano \u00abCris\u00bb Vaz | colspan=\"3\" |- |Laura Dutra |Ana Vaz | colspan=\"3\" |- |Ant\u00f3nio Pedro Cerdeira |Nuno Saavedra | | | |- |Oceana Bas\u00edlio |J\u00falia Neves | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Rita Lello |Amelia Marques | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Miguel Costa |Adolfo Frisado | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Catarina Bonnachi |S\u00f3nia Costa | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Mikaela Lupu |V\u00e2nia Costa | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Joel Branco |Josu\u00e9 Moreira | colspan=\"2\" | |- |In\u00eas Castel- Branco |Laura Vaz | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Gon\u00e7alo Diniz |Gon\u00e7alo Vaz | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Rui Unas |Heitor Carvalho | colspan=\"2\" | |- |B\u00e1rbara Norton de Matos |Sofia Carvalho | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Pedro Sousa |Matias Alexandre Silva | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Madalena Arag\u00e3o |Carolina \u00abCarol\u00bb Carvalho | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Jo\u00e3o Diogo Ferreira |Pipo Carvalho | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Filipe Matos |Lu\u00eds Soares | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Liliana Santos |Cl\u00e1udia Fontes | | | |- |Grace Mendes |Isabel d'Aires | | | |- |Fernando Nobre |Roberto Neves | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Aurea |Patr\u00edcia Finote | | colspan=\"2\" |- |Martinho Silva |Rog\u00e9rio Castro | | colspan=\"2\" |- |Gon\u00e7alo Oliveira |Tiago Castro | | colspan=\"2\" |- |Virg\u00edlio Castelo |Ant\u00f3nio Blanco | | colspan=\"2\" |} == Series overview == ==References== ==External links== * Category:Portuguese telenovelas Category:2019 telenovelas Category:2019 Portuguese television series debuts Category:Sociedade Independente de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o telenovelas Category:Portuguese-language telenovelas ",
