He acceded to the title in 1382 and built Gowran Castle three years later in 1385 close to the centre of Gowran, making it his usual residence, whence his common epithet, The Earl of Gowran. James died in Gowran Castle in 1405 and is buried in St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran together with his father James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond, his grandfather James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond and his great great grandfather Edmund Butler, Earl of Carrick and 6th Chief Butler of Ireland.A History of St. Mary\u2019s Church. Text by Imelda Kehoe. Published by the Gowran Development Association 1992 James the 2nd Earl was usually called The Noble Earl, being a great-grandson, through his mother, Eleanor de Bohun, of King Edward I of England. ==Career== In 1391 he purchased Kilkenny Castle from the Despencer family. He also built the castle of Dunfert (also called Danefort) and in 1386 founded a Friary of minorities at Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire.Lodge, John The Peerage of Ireland or, A Genealogical History Of The Present Nobility Of That Kingdom, 1789, Vol IV, p 10. In 1384 he was deputy to Sir Philip Courtenay, the then Lieutenant of Ireland, who was the nephew of the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Courtenay. The two men for a time were united in opposition to Robert Wikeford, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, who resented the Butler dynasty's power and influence. Butler's title was Governor of Ireland. A rift occurred between them over the disagreement between the Archbishop of Canterbury and Richard II with Butler taking the side of the latter. Insurrection followed which prompted Richard II to an expedition under the banner of his close friend Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland to quell it. This enterprise was led by Sir John Stanley who was accompanied by Bishop Alexander de Balscot of Meath and Sir Robert Crull.Rolls of 9 Richard II- Part I Membrane 1, cont.
