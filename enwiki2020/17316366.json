Its focus is Young@Heart, a New England chorus of senior citizens that sings contemporary and classic rock and pop songs. ==Synopsis== Young@Heart, a chorus of twenty-two senior citizens with an average age of eighty, is directed by a frequently demanding Bob Cilman. In preparation for a concert in their hometown of Northampton, Massachusetts, they spend two months learning new material ranging from James Brown to the Pointer Sisters to The Clash and Sonic Youth, a task that's daunting for them and frequently frustrating for Cilman. At one point they take a break to visit a nearby low-security prison and entertain the inmates, who literally and figuratively embrace them after they perform. The group's determination to succeed increases with the passing of two of their members in rapid succession, and the concert proves to be a major success with the community. ==Production== The film was produced for British television and edited for its theatrical release.Young@Heart at allmovie.comLA Weekly, 9 April 2008 It premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award for Best International Feature, and was shown at South by Southwest, the Florida Film Festival, and the Philadelphia International Film Festival before going into limited release in the United States.

But the lives of the several members it examines at some depth are too real and complicated to resemble a commercial starring Wilford Brimley as a Norman Rockwell grandpa. The movie offers an encouraging vision of old age in which the depression commonly associated with decrepitude is held at bay by music making, camaraderie and a sense of humor.\"New York Times review Steve Davis of the Austin Chronicle rated the film 3\u00bd out of four stars. He felt that \"despite an occasional lapse into nudge-nudge jokes about geriatric sex, incontinence, and the driving skills of the elderly,\" it \"eschews the clich\u00e9s about old people for something that we can all relate to: our own mortality.\"Austin Chronicle review The film was named the best of the year by Marc Mohan of The Oregonian, and it appeared on several top ten lists, including those of the New York Daily News and The Hollywood Reporter.Metacritic 2008 Film Critic Top Ten Lists ==Box office performance== The film opened in four theaters in the United States on 9 April 2008 and grossed $50,937 in its opening weekend.
