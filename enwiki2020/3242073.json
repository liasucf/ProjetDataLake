    "text": "Tolstoy - Ivan the Fool - 'The Fool strikes his first snag' Ivan the Fool () or Ivan the Ninny is a lucky fool stock character who appears in Russian folklore, a very simple-minded, but, nevertheless, lucky young man. Ivan is described as a likeable fair-haired and blue-eyed youth. The approximate setting of Ivan The Fool's adventures is the 15th or 16th century Russia. When he appears in stories, Ivan The Fool is usually portrayed as either a peasant or the son of a poor family. He is usually the youngest of three brothers, and although they appear to be much smarter than he, they are sometimes unkind to and envious of him. Unlike typical heroes, it is Ivan's simplicity and lack of guile that turn out to help him in his adventures. For example, he listens to his heart, rather than his mind, and he easily forgets offence and endeavors to help others even at his own expense. His naivety, kindness, and daring help him fight villains, make friends, win princesses' hearts, and ultimately he is rewarded with half a kingdom or some similar accomplishment. The moral of these stories is that Ivan The Fool is rarely the fool, he is merely perceived as such by others owing to his simple nature and joviality. According to one theory, Ivan the Fool as he was originally created was not intended to be a fool at all. At that time the Russian word \u201c\u0434\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043a\u201d (fool) did not have any negative connotation, and was used to refer to the youngest son in the family. It was only later that it obtained a new meaning, from which the ambiguity arose. It is inevitably the case that he is a positive character in all tales that he is mentioned in. ==See also== *Blonde joke *Blonde stereotype *Ivan Tsarevich *Jack (hero) ==References== Category:Russian folklore characters Category:Fairy tale stock characters Category:Russian folklore Category:Fictional jesters ",
