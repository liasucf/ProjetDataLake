He is a professor at the University of M\u00fcnster. ==Life== He completed his Ph.D. in 1982 at the University of Warwick under the supervision of Brian Sanderson. He was then affiliated as a researcher with the Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies near Paris and the universities of Bielefeld, Edinburgh, and G\u00f6ttingen. In 1999, he joined the faculty of Aberdeen University where he stayed until 2011, when he was awarded a prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Professorship at the University of M\u00fcnster. == Academic Work== His research is on algebraic topology and differential topology. In work with Ib Madsen, he resolved the Mumford Conjecture about rational characteristic classes of surface bundles in the limit as the genus tends to infinity.Allen Hatcher, A Short Exposition of the Madsen\u2013Weiss Theorem Building on earlier work of Thomas Goodwillie, he developed Embedding Calculus, a Calculus of functors for embeddings of manifolds. == Recognition== In 2006, he was awarded the Fr\u00f6hlich Prize of the London Mathematical Society. == Publications == * * ==References== ==External links== *Website at the University of M\u00fcnster Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Topologists Category:20th-century German mathematicians Category:21st-century German mathematicians Category:University of M\u00fcnster faculty Category:Alumni of the University of Warwick ",
