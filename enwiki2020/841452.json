Pherecydes authored a cosmogony, derived from three divine principles, Zas (Zeus),\"Doric and Attic-Ionic forms with \u03b1 (of doubtful origin), nom. \u0396\u03ac\u03bd [...] nom. \u0396\u03ac\u03c2 Pherecyd.Syr.1, 2 (\u0396\u03ae\u03c2 ap.Hdn.Gr. l.c.[2.911]), \"\u0396\u03ac\u03c2 \u0396\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2\" Choerob. in Theod.1.116; \u0394\u03ac\u03bd (q. v.); \u03a4\u03ac\u03bd Head Hist.Num.2469 (Crete)\" \u0396\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 Cthonie (Earth)\"Ionic \u1f21 \u03c7\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b7, an earlier name of \u0393\u1fc6 [Pherecyd.Syr.1, cf.

It formed a bridge between the mythological thought of Hesiod and pre-Socratic philosophy. His work is lost, but it survived into the Hellenistic period and we are informed on part of its content indirectly. Pherecydes was said to have been the first writer to communicate philosophical musings in prose. Aristotle regarded him partly a mythological writer and Plutarch, as well as many other writers gave him the title of Theologus. == Life == According to tradition Pherecydes was a native of the island of Syros and flourished in the 59th Olympiad (544\u2013541 BC). It was said that he was a son of one Babys. Schibli (1990) dates his birth in the 49th olympiad (584\u2013581). Anecdotes of \"unknown reliability\" place Pherecydes on the island of Samos, and in the city of Ephesus, where he is supposed to have been buried, although another tradition claims he was buried on Delos.Diogenes Laertius, i. 116-121; Diodorus Siculus, 10.4.3; Suda, Pherekudes Babuos Syrios Aristotle wrote in his MetaphysicsAristotle, Metaphysics, 1091b8 of Pherecydes being in part a mythological writer and Plutarch, in his Parallel Lives,Plutarch, Sulla 36 instead wrote of him being a theologian. He was considered to have had the greater significance in teaching on the subject of metempsychosis.Cicero, Tusculan Disputations, i. 16 His writings were extant in the Hellenistic period, although only fragments have survived to the present day. His works were written in prose rather than verse and he has been said to have been the first to have communicated or conveyed philosophical musings in this form. Tradition maintains that Pherecydes lived in two caves in the northern part of the island of Syros. This summer habitation remains a popular tourist destination to this day. ==Cosmogony== Pherecydes\u2019 Cave. Some sources say that Pherecydes' book was entitled \"Pentemychos\" (\u03a0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ad\u03bc\u03c5\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 Pentemuchos) translated as five (\u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5) \"recesses\" (\u03bc\u03c5\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2 muchos, \"nook, cranny, recess\", also \"sanctuary\" as in \"small domestic altar in a corner\").\u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ad-\u03bc\u03c5\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 in some sources said to have been titled \"Heptamychos\" (\"seven (\u1f11\u03c0\u03c4\u03ac) recesses\"). There seems to be no complete agreement among scholars on which sources to trust regarding the title of Pherecydes' book, the standard survey reference on the Presocratic philosophers by Kirk, Raven and Schofield, opts for \"Heptamychos\". The author of the only modern scholarly book devoted entirely to Pherecydes, Hermann S. Schibli, argues that \"Pentemychos\" was the true title.. In this work, Pherecydes taught his philosophy through the medium of mythic representations. Although it is lost, the fragments that survive are enough to reconstruct a basic outline. In the older cosmogony of Hesiod (8th\u20137th century BC) the initial state of the universe is Chaos, a dark void considered as a divine primordial condition and the creation is ex nihilo (out of nothing). Pherecydes probably interpreted chaos as water and he does not place it at the very beginning. In his cosmogony there are three divine principles, Zas (\u0396\u03ac\u03c2, Zeus), Cthonie (\u03a7\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b7, Earth) and Chronos (\u03a7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, Time) who always existed. The semen (seeds) of Chronos which can probably be considered as a watery chaos was placed in the recesses and composed numerous other offspring of gods. This is described in a fragment preserved in Damascius' On First Principles. A close relationship is thought to exist between these recesses and Chthonie. Hesiod described Tartaros as being \"in a recess (muchos) of broad-wayed earth\". Hermann S. Schibli thinks the five muchoi were actually harboured within Chthonie, or at least were so initially when Chronos disposed his seed in the five \"nooks\". Alongside Chthonie and Chronos, Pherecydes held a power called Zas. Zas (Zeus), comparable with the Orphic Eros in function, and as such a personification of masculine (sexual) creativity. Proclus said that \"Pherecydes used to say that Zeus changed into Eros when about to create, for the reason that, having created the world from opposites, he led it into agreement and peace and sowed sameness in all things, and unity that interpenetrates the universe\". The act of creation itself (perhaps it is more accurate to say that Chronos creates and that Zas orders and distributes) is described mytho-poetically as Zas making a cloth on which he decorates earth and sea, and which he then presents as a wedding gift to Chthonie, and wraps around her. Yet, in another fragment it is not Chthonie, but \"a winged oak\" that he wraps the cloth around. The \"winged oak\" in this cosmology has no precedent in Greek tradition. The stories are different but not mutually exclusive, because much is lacking in the fragments, but it seems clear that creation is hindered by chaotic forces. Pherecydes, depicted as a medieval scholar in the Nuremberg Chronicle Bust in Syros Before the world is ordered a cosmic battle takes place, with Cronus as the head of one side and Ophioneus as the leader of the other. The same story is elsewhere enacted with Zeus and Typhon/Typhoeus as leading characters, and it also has close parallels in many myths from cultures other than the Greek (Marduk vs. Tiamat, etc.). Ophioneus and its brood are often depicted as ruling the birthing cosmos for some time, before falling from power. The chaotic forces are eternal and cannot be destroyed; instead they are thrown out from the ordered world and locked away in Tartaros in a kind of \"appointment of the spheres\", in which the victor (Zeus-Cronus) takes possession of the sky and of space and time. The locks to Tartaros are fashioned in iron by Zeus, and might hence have been associated with his element of aither, and in bronze by Poseidon, which might indicate a link to water (which was often conceived of as the \"first matter\"). Judging from some ancient fragments Ophioneus is thrown into Okeanos, not into Tartaros. Exactly what entities or forces that were locked away in Pherecydes\u2019 story cannot be known for sure. There may have been five principal figures. Ophioneus and Typhon are one and the same, and Eurynome fought on the side of Ophioneus against Cronus. Chthonie is a principal \"thing\" of the underworld, but whether she is to be counted as one of the five or the five \"sum-total\" is an open question. Apart from these it is known that Ophioneus-Typhon mated with Echidna, and that Echidna herself was somehow mysteriously \"produced\" by Callirhoe. If Pherecydes counted five principal entities in association the pentemychos doctrine, then Ophioneus, Eurynome, Echidna, Calirrhoe and Chthonie are the main contenders. Cronus (or Zeus in the more popularly known version) orders the offspring out from the cosmos to Tartaros. There they are kept behind locked gates, fashioned in iron (associated with Zeus and his element of sky/space) and bronze (by Poseidon\u2014the water force). We are told about chaotic beings put into the pentemychos, and we are told that the Darkness has an offspring that is cast into the recesses of Tartaros. No surviving fragment makes the connection, but it is possible that the prison- house in Tartaros and the pentemychos are ways of referring to the essentially same thing. According to Celsus, Pherecydes said that: \"Below that portion is the portion of Tartaros; the daughters of Boreas [the north wind], the Harpies and Thuella [Storm], guard it; there Zeus banished any of the gods whenever one behaves with insolence.\" Thus the identity between Zeus' prison-house and the pentemychos seems likely. == Influence == Pherecydes' \"Pentemychos\" was thought to have contained a mystical esoteric teaching, treated allegorically. One ancient commentator said that: A comparatively large number of sources say Pherecydes was the first to teach the eternality and transmigration (metempsychosis) of human souls. Both Cicero and Augustine thought of him having given the first teaching of the \"immortality of the soul\". It is not surprising that some considered Pherecydes to have been the teacher of Pythagoras.; That he was the first to teach such a thing is doubtful, but that he was among the first and that he did profess this teaching is certain. Hermann S. Schibli concludes that Pherecydes \"included in his book [\"Pentemychos\"] at least a rudimentary treatment of the immortality of the soul, its wanderings in the underworld, and the reasons for the soul\u2019s incarnations\". Pherecydes was occasionally counted among the Seven Sages of Greece. See also . A sun-dial (heliotropion), supposedly made by Pherecydes, was said by Diogenes La\u00ebrtius to be \"preserved on the island of Syros.\" == Reconstruction == Basing himself on the extant fragments of Pherecydes' work, on testimonia from ancient authors regarding Pherecydes' philosophy, as well as on themes from Ancient Greek and Near Eastern mythologies, Hermann S. Schibli offers the following reconstruction of the main elements of Pherecydes' lost book: ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * Pherecydes of Syros by Giannis Stamatellos * Fragments and Life of Pherecydes at demonax.info Category:6th-century BC Greek people Category:People from Syros Category:Presocratic philosophers Category:Seven Sages of Greece Category:Mythological cosmologies Category:Cosmogony ",
