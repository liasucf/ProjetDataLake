    "text": "Donald Trump (left) and Barack Obama (right) together on Trump's inauguration day, January 20, 2017 In the United States, Obama-Trump voters, also known as Trump Democrats or Obama Republicans, are people who voted for Democratic Party nominee Barack Obama in the 2008 or 2012 presidential elections (or both), but later voted for Republican Party nominee Donald Trump in 2016. These voters comprise roughly 13% of Trump voters and 9% of Obama voters. In contrast, 7% of Obama voters did not vote in 2016, and 3% voted for a third party candidate. While some analysts consider these voters to have been decisive in Trump's victory, others have disputed this conclusion. According to research done by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, compared to other voters, Obama-Trump voters have progressive economic views and conservative social views, and though these voters supported Trump in the 2016 election, they are less supportive of Republicans as a whole, and show a desire to change the status quo. == Studies == Various studies estimate the percentage of Trump voters who had previously voted for Obama at between 11 and 15 percent. The Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) found that 11% of Trump voters had voted for Obama in 2012, with the American National Election Study putting the number at 13%, and the University of Virginia Center for Politics estimating 15%. Expressed in total number of voters, these percentages indicate that between 7 and 9 million Trump voters voted for Obama in 2012. According to a May 2017 McClatchy news report, an analysis by Democratic political firm Global Strategy Group estimated that Obama-Trump voters accounted for more than two-thirds of Obama voters who did not vote for Hillary Clinton. == Significance == Some analysts have argued that Obama-Trump voters had a disproportionately large impact on the 2016 election because they were concentrated in key swing states in the Midwest while others have said they were actually \"Obama Republicans\" rather than Democrats to begin with. Some have disputed both the quantity and the significance of Obama-Trump voters in deciding the outcome of the 2016 election. Dana Milbank argued in an August 2017 Washington Post column that the number of such voters was initially overstated and that most of them were Republicans who only defected from their party to vote for Obama, not Democrats who defected to support Trump. Nate Cohn countered Milbank's assessment by arguing that Milbank's focus on national data obscured the magnitude of Democratic defection to support Trump. Cohn noted that when looking specifically at white Obama voters with no higher education than a high school diploma, Clinton won only 74% (based on data from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group) or 78% (based on the Cooperative Congressional Election Study). == Voters' views == Shortly before the 2016 election, The New York Times reported that Obama voters who planned to vote for Trump felt he embodied the \"change\" they had hoped for when they voted for Obama. Multiple focus groups of Obama-Trump voters convened by the Roosevelt Institute and Democracy Corps in early 2017 showed that in general these voters wanted to change the status quo and had skeptical views of Congressional Republicans and their proposals. The same focus groups also indicated that these voters hoped President Trump would help reduce health care costs for working-class Americans, and that they were anxious about some immigrant groups. A multi-year survey completed by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group found that Obama-Trump voters generally had liberal views on economic issues, but conservative views on social issues. In a 2017 editorial for New York Magazine, Eric Levitz noted that data from the CCES indicates 75% of Obama-Trump voters supported repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. According to an article in Politico, a September 2017 Democracy Fund Voter Study Group poll found that 70% of Obama-Trump voters approved of the job Trump was doing as president. This figure was significantly lower than the 88% approval rating among all Trump voters. Similarly, the percent of voters who disapproved of Trump's performance in this poll was much higher among Obama-Trump voters (22%) than among Trump voters as a whole (9%). == See also == * List of Democrats who opposed the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign * Reagan Democrats * Sanders-Trump voters == References == * Trump voters Category:Donald Trump Category:Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign Category:Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign Category:Political terminology of the United States Category:Voting in the United States ",
