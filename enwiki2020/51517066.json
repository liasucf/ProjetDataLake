The album was initially released on CD and digital download on September 16, 2016; followed by a limited-edition double vinyl followed on September 30, 2016. The vinyl included eight tracks exclusively. ==Reception== In a review for Stack Magazine, Jeff Jenkins wrote \"Faithful Satellite traverses bluegrass, blues, rockabilly, reggae, rock, gospel, and soul. 'Camilleri' is known for the vitality in his lyrics\". Paul Cashmere, reviewing the album for Noise11, stated that the album is a 'masterpiece', adding that \"The Faithful Satellite's beauty is in its diversity with rock, jazz, bluegrass, and country woven through the release. This often reminds long-time Camilleri fans of the various eras of Black Sorrows music across the last 30 years.\" ==Track listing== ;Digital download # \"I Love You Anyhow\" # \"Raise Your Hands\" # \"It Ain't Ever Gonna Happen\" # \"Land of the Dead\" # \"Cold Grey Moon\" # \"Fix My Bail\" # \"Carolina\" # \"You Were Never Mine\" # \"Winter Rose\" # \"Love Is On Its Way\" # \"Beat Nightmare\" # \"Into Twilight\" ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Rank |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian (ARIA) Jazz and Blues Chart | 2 |- |} ==Faithful Satellite Tour== The group toured the album across Australia throughout the second half of 2016. * 29 July \u2013 The Flying Saucer Club, Victoria * 30 July \u2013 Bundy Hall, Victoria * 31 July \u2013 Bundy Hall, Victoria * 20 August \u2013 The Satellite Lounge, Victoria * 1 September \u2013 Southport Yacht Club, Queensland * 2 September \u2013 \"Red Fest\" Brisbane, Queensland * 3 September \u2013 Towers Rocks, Queensland * 4 September \u2013 Sunshine Beach Surf Club, Queensland * 10 September \u2013 Sandstone Point Hotel, Queensland * 16 September \u2013 SS&A; Club, Albury, NSW * 17 September \u2013 The Palms at Crown, Melbourne, Victoria (with special guests Vika and Linda Bull) * 22 September \u2013 Mt Pleasant Tavern, Queensland * 23 September \u2013 Dalrymple Hotel, Townsville, Queensland * 24 September \u2013 Edge Hill Tavern, Cairns, Queensland * 29 September \u2013 Devonport Entertainment & Convention Centre, Tasmania * 30 September \u2013 Country Club Showroom, Tasmania * 1 October \u2013 Centre Square, Birrarung Marr, Victoria * 7 October \u2013 Twin Towns Services Club, NSW * 9 October \u2013 Barwon Club Hotel, Victoria * 12 October \u2013 Frankston RSL, Victoria * 13 October \u2013 Friends Restaurant, Perth, WA * 14 October \u2013 Fly by Night Club, Fremantle, WA * 15 October \u2013 Charles Hotel, WA * 16 October \u2013 Ravenswood Hotel, WA * 21 October \u2013 Wild Goose Restaurant, WA * 22 October \u2013 Shark Bay 1616, WA * 29 October \u2013 Cygnet Town Hall, Tasmania * 30 October \u2013 Republic Bar, Hobart, Tasmania * 3 November \u2013 The Basement, Sydney, NSW * 4 November \u2013 Inland Sea of Sound Festival, Bathurst, NSW * 5 November \u2013 Armidale Ex-Services Club, NSW * 6 November \u2013 Hoey Moey Beer Garden, Coffs Harbour, NSW * 8 November \u2013 Bird's Basement, Melbourne, Victoria * 9 November \u2013 Bird's Basement, Melbourne, Victoria * 11 November \u2013 Caboolture Sports Club, Queensland * 12 November \u2013 Stanthorpe Rocks, Queensland * 13 November \u2013 Caloundra Power Boat Club, Queensland * 18 November \u2013 Governor Hindmarsh Hotel, Adelaide, SA * 19 November \u2013 River Rockfest, Broken Hill, NSW * 26 November \u2013 River Rockfest, Mildura, Victoria * 2 December \u2013 The Grand Hotel, Mornington, Victoria * 3 December \u2013 Lakeside Twilights, Ballarat, Victoria * 3 December \u2013 River Rockfest, Swan Hill, Victoria * 4 December \u2013 Halls Gap Hotel, Victoria * 7 December \u2013 Centro CBD, Wollongong, NSW * 8 December \u2013 The Basement, Canberra, ACT * 9 December \u2013 Lizotte's Newcastle, NSW * 10 December \u2013 Lizotte's, Newcastle, NSW * 11 December \u2013 Camelot Lounge, Marrickville, NSW * 17 December \u2013 Skycity, Darwin, NT ==Personnel== ;The Black Sorrows * Joe Camilleri (vocals/guitar/saxophone) * Claude Carranza (guitar/vocals) * Mark Gray (bass/vocals) * John McAll (keyboards/vocals) * Angus Burchall (drums) ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Australia | 16 September 2016 | Digital download, CD | rowspan=\"2\"| Head Records | HEAD230 |- | 30 September 2016 | Vinyl | HEAD230V |- |} ==References== Category:2016 albums Category:Albums produced by Joe Camilleri Category:The Black Sorrows albums ",
