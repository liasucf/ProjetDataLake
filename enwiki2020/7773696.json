Dudley den Dulk was 20 years old at the time, and was making his only appearance in Olympic competition. The two-man bobsleigh competition was held over four runs on 15\u201316 February, with two runs being held on each day, and the sum of all four run times determining final placement. The Netherlands Antillean sled finished the first run in 1 minute and 2.97 seconds, and the second run in 1 minute and 3.26 seconds. Overnight, they were tied for 36th place. The next day, they finished the third run in 1 minute and 3.40 seconds, and the fourth in 1 minute and 3.46 seconds.
