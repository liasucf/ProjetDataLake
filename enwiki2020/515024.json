M\u00e9tal hurlant (literal translation: \"Howling Metal\")https://translate.google.com/#fr/en/M%C3%A9tal%20hurlant was a French comics anthology of science fiction and horror comics stories, created in December 1974 by comics artists Jean Giraud (better known as M\u0153bius) and Philippe Druillet together with journalist-writer Jean-Pierre Dionnet and financial director Bernard Farkas.

M\u00e9tal hurlant, emphasising complex graphics, cinematic imagery and surreal storylines, was highly influential throughout the world as one of the first mature expressions of \"adult\" comic book making.
