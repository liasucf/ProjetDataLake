    "text": "The Zafarnama of Guru Gobind Singh The Battle of Chamkaur, also known as Battle of Chamkaur Sahib, was a battle fought between the Khalsa, led by Guru Gobind Singh, and the coalition forces of the Mughals led by Wazir Khan. Guru Gobind Singh makes a reference to this battle in his victory letter Zafarnama. ==Preamble to the battle== After Guru Gobind Singh left Anandpur Sahib on the night of December 5 and 6, 1704, they crossed the Sarsa river and while they were crossing the mughals and hill chiefs broke their oath and attacked the Sikhs. Many of the Sikhs had gotten scattered. They asked permission of the city chief for shelter to rest for the night in their garhi or haveli. The older brother thought giving him shelter would be dangerous so he refused. But the younger brother gave permission to let them stay there for the night. ==The battle== Despite giving assurance of safe conduct, the Mughals soldiers were looking for Guru Gobind Singh, to take his head as a trophy. After learning that the party of Sikhs had taken shelter in the haveli, they planed laid siege upon it. The Sikh were aware of this so they went to the fort of chamkaur before the attack so they can be ready to fight the mughals. ==Aftermath== When the Sikhs won the war the Mughals all ran away Guru Ji let them run and didn't chase them. Guru Gobind Singh made a last stand against the Mughals at Muktsar, but by then arungzeb was already defeated The Battle of Muktsar was the last battle fought by Guru Gobind Singh. The Guru emphasized how he was proud that his sons had died fighting in battle, and that he had 'thousands of sons \u2013 the Singhs'. He also said that he would never trust Aurangzeb again due to his broken promises and lies. ==Zafarnama== Zafarnama or \"Epistle of Victory\" is a letter that was written by Guru Gobind Singh to the then Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Zafarnama vividly describes what happened at Chamkaur, and also holds Aurangzeb responsible for what occurred and promises he broke: :13: Aurangzeb! I have no trust in your oaths anymore. (You have written that) God is one and that He is witness (between us). :14: I don't have trust equivalent to even a drop (of water) in your generals (who came to me with oaths on the Quran that I will be given safe passage out of Anandgarh Fort). They were all telling lies. :15: If anyone trusts (you) on your oath on the Quran, that person is bound to be doomed in the end. ==References== ==External links== * Battle description at singhsabha.com Category:Conflicts in 1704 Chamkaur Category:1704 in India Chamkaur ",
