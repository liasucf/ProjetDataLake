    "text": "Get The Picture was an online game, the object of which was to come up with the funniest caption (as determined by fellow players) to match a picture that appeared on the screen. The game was developed by Bezerk and enjoyed its peak popularity during the late 90s. == Gameplay == The player enters a lobby and proceeds to pick a game room, where a game is about to begin or is already underway. Players are shown a picture at the top left corner of the screen, and each user must enter a caption in an allotted amount of time. When the time elapses, the quotes are displayed for all to see but with no mention of their author. Those present in the room then vote to decide which quote is the funniest; the player with the most points at the game's end is declared the winner. In addition to the regular rounds, all games ended with a specialty round where more points were at stake, and usually required a caption of specific nature (ex. in the style of an advertisement). == Current status == Bezerk included advertisements between rounds, but due to lack of revenue produced by these adverts, the game was abandoned. Message boards and petitions often pop up around the Internet with a common desire of bringing back or coding the game anew. == External links == * Words That Follow is a browser game based on the gameplay of Get The Picture. * An attempt by an independent programmer at recreating the original Get The Picture. This project has been abandoned as of August 2005. * Caption THAT flash game attempting to recreate Get the Picture. Category:Multiplayer online games ",
