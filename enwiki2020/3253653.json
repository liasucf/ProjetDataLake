Sanhe (\u4e09\u5408\u93ae), in Longjing City, is the closest Chinese town across the river. Hoery\u014fng is claimed to be the birthplace of Kim Il Sung's first wife and Kim Jong Il's mother, Kim Jong Suk. The Hoeryong Revolutionary Site commemorates the birthplace. The Hoery\u014fng concentration camp (Kwalliso No. 22) is located from the city. Birthplace of Kim Jong-suk == History == Hoery\u014fng was one of the six post/garrisons (Chos\u014fng\u016dl: \uc721\uc9c4, Hanja: \u516d\u93ad) established under the order of Sejong the Great of Joseon (1418 - 1450) to safeguard his people from the potentially hostile semi-nomadic Jurchens living north of the Yalu river. In early May 2007, the newly appointed Prime Minister Kim Yong-il visited Hoery\u014fng. At the time, the Prime Minister brought with him on his train, one carriage worth of glass (made in South Korea) and 3 carriages worth of cement. After delivering the goods to the People's Committee of Hoery\u014fng he ordered that the city of Hoery\u014fng be decorated and adorned as much as a city where Mother Kim Jong Suk's birthplace should be. ==Administrative divisions== Hoery\u014fng-si is divided into 19 tong (neighbourhoods) and 28 ri (villages): {| |- | valign=\"top\" | * Chungdo-dong * Chungbong-dong * Ch'irw\u014flp'aril-dong * Kang'an-dong * Kyerim-dong * Kungsim-dong * Mang'yang-dong * Nammun-dong * Osand\u014fk-tong * Po\u016dl-dong * Saema\u016dl-dong * San'\u014fp-tong * Sech'\u014fn-dong * Sinch'\u014fn-dong * S\u014fngch'\u014fn-dong * Subuk-tong * Tongmy\u014fng-dong * Y\u014fkch\u014fn-dong * Yus\u014fn-dong * Ch'angt'ae-ri * Ch'anghyo-ri * Hakp'o-ri * Hangyong-ri * Hongsal- li | valign=\"top\" | * In'ge-ri * Kesang-ri * Keha-ri * Kulsal-li * K\u016dmsaeng-ri * Musal-li * Namsal-li * Obong-ri * Oryu-ri * Pangw\u014fl-li * Py\u014fks\u014fng-ri * P'ungsal-li * Raksaeng-ri * Ryongch'\u014fl-li * Sa\u016dl-li * Sinh\u016dng-ri * S\u014fngbung-ri * S\u014fngdong-ri * Songhang-ri * Taedong-ri * Tokh\u016dng-ri * W\u014fnsal-li * Y\u014fngsu-ri |} ==Economy== Hoery\u014fng's main industries are mining machines and a paper mill.
