    "text": "Tommy Breen (27 April 1912 \u2013 1 March 1988) was an Irish footballer who played as a goalkeeper for, among others, Belfast Celtic, Manchester United, Linfield and Shamrock Rovers. Breen was a dual international and played for both Ireland teams: the IFA XI and the FAI XI. Breen replaced Elisha Scott as first-choice goalkeeper for both Belfast Celtic and the IFA XI and was rated by Billy Behan, one of his predecessors at Manchester United and a renowned scout, as one of the best goalkeepers Ireland ever produced. He was also the first Manchester United player ever to play for an FAI XI. During his career, Breen was involved in several controversies; in November 1937, he turned down the chance to play for the FAI XI in a 1938 World Cup qualifier to play for the IFA XI in the 1938 British Home Championship. Then, in 1944, he transferred from Belfast Celtic to their rivals Linfield after a financial dispute. ==Sources== *The Boys in Green \u2013 The FAI International Story (1997): Sean Ryan *Soccer at War \u2013 1939 \u2013 45 (2005): Jack Rollin *DUFC A Claret and Blue History by Brian Whelan (2010) ==External links== *Northern Ireland Footballing Greats *Ireland (FAI) stats Category:1912 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Association footballers from County Louth Category:Belfast Celtic F.C. players Category:Drogheda United F.C. players Category:Dual Irish international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:League of Ireland players Category:Glentoran F.C. players Category:Ireland (FAI) international footballers Category:Irish Free State association footballers Category:Linfield F.C. players Category:NIFL Premiership players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:People from Drogheda Category:Pre-1950 IFA international footballers Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Shamrock Rovers F.C. players Category:Expatriate association footballers in Northern Ireland Category:League of Ireland XI players Category:Irish Free State international footballers Category:Irish League representative players Category:Ireland (IFA) wartime international footballers ",
