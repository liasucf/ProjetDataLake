    "text": "The voiceless velar lateral fricative is a very rare speech sound. As one element of an affricate, it is found for example in Zulu and Xhosa (see velar lateral ejective affricate). However, a simple fricative has only been reported from a few languages in the Caucasus and New Guinea. Archi, a Northeast Caucasian language of Dagestan, has four voiceless velar lateral fricatives: plain , labialized , fortis , and labialized fortis . Although clearly fricatives, these are further forward than velars in most languages, and might better be called prevelar. Archi also has a voiced fricative, as well as a voiceless and several ejective lateral velar affricates, but no alveolar lateral fricatives or affricates. In New Guinea, some of the Chimbu\u2013Wahgi languages such as Melpa, Middle Wahgi, and Nii, have a voiceless velar lateral fricative, which they write with a double-bar el (\u2c60, \u2c61). This sound also appears in syllable coda position as an allophone of the voiced velar lateral fricative in Kuman.Steed, W., & Hardie, P. (2004).

The IPA has no separate symbol for these sounds, but they can be transcribed as a devoiced raised velar lateral approximant, (here the devoicing ring diacritic is placed above the letter to avoid clashing with the raising diacritic). By analogy with existing IPA laterals, a small capital \ua7ad is used in the extIPA: Image:Velar lateral fricative.png SIL International has added these symbols to the Private Use Areas of their Gentium, Charis and Doulos fonts, at U+F268 (). ==Features== Features of the voiceless velar lateral fricative: ==Occurrence== {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=2| Language !
