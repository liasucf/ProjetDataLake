According to The World Factbook Sunni Muslims constitute between 84.7 - 89.7% of the population, and Shia Muslims between 10 - 15%. 0.3% follow other minority religions. ==History== The religion Zoroastrianism is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder Zoroaster is thought to have lived and died in Balkh while the region at the time was referred to as Ariana.Bryant, Edwin F. (2001) The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate Oxford University Press, .Afghanistan: ancient Ariana (1950), Information Bureau, p3. Ancient Eastern Iranian languages may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the Medes and incorporated Arachosia, Aria, and Bactria within its eastern boundaries. An inscription on the tombstone of Darius I of Persia mentions the Kabul Valley in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered. Before the arrival of Islam Southern Afghanistan used to be a stronghold of Zoroastrianism. It is believed that the Avesta had arrived in Persia through Arachosia. Thus the region is also considered as a \"second fatherland for Zoroastrianism\".The idea of Iran. An essay on its origin, Gnoli Gherardo, page 133 Following Alexander the Great's conquest and occupation in the 4th century BC, the successor-state Seleucid Empire controlled the area until 305 BC when they gave much of it to the Indian Maurya Empire as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans brought Buddhism from India and controlled parts of southern and eastern Afghanistan until about 185 BC when they were overthrown. In the 7th century, the Umayyad Arab Muslims entered into the area now known as Afghanistan after decisively defeating the Sassanians in the Battle of Nihawand (642 AD). Following this colossal defeat, the last Sassanid Emperor, Yazdegerd III, became a hunted fugitive and fled eastward deep into Central Asia. In pursuing Yazdegerd, the Arabs chose to enter the area from north- eastern IranArabic As a Minority Language, by Jonathan Owens, pg. 181 and thereafter into Herat, where they stationed a large portion of their army before advancing toward the rest of Afghanistan. The Arabs exerted considerable efforts toward propagating Islam amongst the locals. A large number of the inhabitants of the region of northern Afghanistan accepted Islam through Umayyad missionary efforts, particularly under the reigns of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (caliph from 723 to 733) and Umar ibn AbdulAziz (caliph from 717 to 720).The Preaching of Islam: A History of the Propagation of the Muslim Faith, by Thomas Walker Arnold, pg. 183 During the reign of Al-Mu'tasim Islam was generally practiced amongst most inhabitants of the region and finally under Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari, Islam was by far, the predominant religion of Kabul along with other major cities of Afghanistan. Later, the Samanids propagated Islam deep into the heart of Central Asia, as the first complete translation of the Qur'an into Persian occurred in the 9th century. Since the 9th century, Islam has dominated the country's religious landscape. Islamic leaders have entered the political sphere at various times of crisis, but rarely exercised secular authority for long. Remnants of the Hindu Shahi dynasty in Afghanistan's eastern borders were expelled by Mahmud of Ghazni during 998 and 1030. Until the 1890s, the country's Nuristan region was known as Kafiristan (land of the kafirs or \"infidels\") because of its inhabitants: the Nuristani, an ethnically distinctive people who practiced animism, polytheism and shamanism. praying at the Blue Mosque (or Shrine of Ali) in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif The 1979 Soviet invasion in support of a communist government triggered a major intervention of religion into Afghan political conflict, and Islam united the multi-ethnic political opposition. Once the Soviet-backed Marxist-style regime came to power in Afghanistan, the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) moved to reduce the influence of Islam. The \"atheistic\" and \"infidel\" communist PDPA imprisoned, tortured and murdered many members of the religious establishment. After National Reconciliation talks in 1987, Islam became once again the state religion and the country removed the word \"Democratic\" from its official name. From 1987-1992, the country's official name was the Republic of Afghanistan but today it is an Islamic Republic. For Afghans, Islam represents a potentially unifying symbolic system which offsets the divisiveness that frequently rises from the existence of a deep pride in tribal loyalties and an abounding sense of personal and family honor found in multitribal and multiethnic societies such as Afghanistan. Mosques serve not only as places of worship, but for a multitude of functions, including shelter for guests, places to meet and converse, the focus of social religious festivities and schools. Almost every Afghan has at one time during his youth studied at a mosque school; for some this is the only formal education they receive. ==Minority religious groups== ===Shia Islam=== The Shias make up between 7% to 20% of the total population of Afghanistan. Although there is a tiny minority Sunnis among them, the Hazaras are predominately and overwhelmngy Shia, mostly of the Twelver branch with some smaller groups who practice the Ismailism branch.1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica - Hazara (Race) The Qizilbash Tajiks of Afghanistan have traditionally been Shias. ===Modernist and Nondenominational Muslims=== One of the most important revivalists and resuscitators of the Islamic Modernist and non-denominational Muslim movement in the contemporary era was Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani. ===Zoroastrians=== According to the World Christian Encyclopedia, 2,000 Afghans identified as Zoroastrians in 1970.http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/religious_studies/CDC/afghanistan.html. ===Dharmic religions=== There are about 1,000 Afghan Sikhs and a little over 1,000 Hindus living in different cities but mostly in Kabul, Jalalabad, and Ghazni. Senator Awtar Singh was the only Sikh in Afghanistan's parliament.http://www.sikhnet.com/news/afghanistan-dwindling-sikh-community- struggles-endure-kabul When the Talibans were in power, the Buddha statues were destroyed. Taliban soldiers used rockets and guns to destroy them. ===Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith=== The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith was introduced to Afghanistan in 1919 and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds have been living there since the 1880s. As of 2010, there were approximately 16,500 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Afghanistan. ===Christianity=== Some unconfirmed reports state that there are 1,000 to 18,000 Afghan Christians practicing their faith secretly in the country. A 2015 study estimates some 3,300 Christians from a Muslim background residing in the country. ===Judaism=== There was a small Jewish community in Afghanistan who fled the country before and after the 1979 Soviet invasion, and one individual, Zablon Simintov, still remains today.Washingtonpost.com - Afghan Jew Becomes Country's One and Only - N.C. Aizenman It is thought that there are between 500\u20131,000 secret Jews in Afghanistan who were forced to convert to Islam after the Taliban took control of the country. There are Afghan Jewish communities in Israel, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. ==See also== * Hinduism in Afghanistan * Irreligion in Afghanistan * Islam in Afghanistan * Buddhism in Afghanistan * Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in Afghanistan * Christianity in Afghanistan * Religious freedom in Afghanistan ==References== ",
