    "text": "Gregory Reinhart (born June 18, 1951 in Pavilion, New York) is an American bass opera singer. He is noted for an extremely wide repertory which ranges from early music to the world premieres of several contemporary operas including Lowell Liebermann's The Picture of Dorian Gray, Philippe Manoury's K..., and Pascal Dusapin's Perel\u00e0, uomo di fumo. He has been praised in The Metropolitan Opera Guide to Recorded Opera for his performance in Monteverdi's L'Incoronazione di Poppea as one of the finest Senecas on record with \"a magnificent bass voice: firm and clear throughout its wide range\".Gruber (1993) p. 267 ==Biography== Gregory Reinhart was raised in upstate New York. In 1971, he entered Boston's New England Conservatory (NEC), where he studied voice with Mark Pearson and took master classes with Eleanor Steber. He graduated \"with distinction\" in 1974 and went on to receive his Master of Music Degree there in 1977. In 1976 he was a recipient of a fellowship award that also allowed him to train with Phyllis Curtin at the Tanglewood Music Center in Massachusetts. While at the NEC, he appeared in student performances of Ravel's L'heure espagnole and Donizetti's Don Pasquale. He directed the choir of St. John the Baptist in Quincy, sang with Emmanuel Music, and appeared as a soloist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the Monteverdi Vespers, Bach's St. Matthew Passion and Tchaikovsky's opera Eugene Onegin. Another early venture into opera was his performance in Verdi's Giovanna d'Arco with Boston Concert Opera, where according to the Boston Globe critic, Richard Dyer, \"he sang the guest-star New York contingent right off the stage\".Dyer (April 12, 1987) Reinhart first started training in voice with Professor Gloria Bugni McMaster at State University of New York at Geneseo, then went on to train as an opera singer at the American Institute of Musical Studies in Graz, where he took further classes with Eleanor Steber and studied with the soprano Patricia Brinton who encouraged him to continue his preparation in Paris. He remained with her there for two years, thanks to a private donor from Quincy, Adelina Chella. During his years in Paris, he received the advice and encouragement of Pierre Bernac and Camille Maurane. Most importantly for the development of his career, he met the French musicologist Jacques Chuilon in 1980.Jacques Chuilon is the author of Op\u00e9ra Opinions (1994), Mattia Battistini: Le dernier divo (1996), and La voix qui chante (1998). The title \"Mattia Battistini, King of Baritones and Baritone of Kings\" was released in English (Scarecrow Press) in April 2009. See: www.chuilon.com Their collaboration in developing a vocal technique that permits Reinhart to perform a wide repertory from Bach to Mozart to the dramatic bass roles of Richard Wagner, as well as German Lieder and French M\u00e9lodie, continues to this day. Reinhart made his French operatic debut with the Atelier Lyrique de Tourcoing in 1981, when he sang the title role of Giovanni Paisiello's Le roi Th\u00e9odore \u00e0 Venise in its first performance in modern times. In 1984 he appeared at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet as both Huascar and Bellone in Rameau's Les Indes Galantes. It was the first time that a fully staged Rameau opera was performed in Paris with a full baroque period instrument orchestra. That same year he sang the role of Arnold in the French premiere of Hans Werner Henze's La chatte anglaise at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. Reinhart went on to sing leading bass roles in many of Europe's opera houses and concert halls over the next twenty years. Reinhart has also been a guest performer in opera, oratorio and recital in many prominent music festivals including the Aix-en-Provence Festival, the Handel Festival, Halle, the Santa Fe Opera Festival, the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, and the Chor\u00e9gies d'Orange Festival. Amongst the ensembles he has worked with are Groupe Vocale de France under John Alldis, Ensemble intercontemporain under Pierre Boulez, Concerto Vocale under Ren\u00e9 Jacobs, and Les Arts Florissants under William Christie. Although he continues to be based in France, Reinhart has increasingly appeared in the United States. In 2002 he made his debut at New York City Opera as Claudius in Agrippina. His Washington National Opera debut followed in 2005 as The Old Hebrew in Samson et Dalila, conducted by Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. The following year he made his Metropolitan Opera debut as The Armoured Man in Die Zauberfl\u00f6te. 2007 saw company debuts with Portland Opera as Oroveso in Norma and with Pittsburgh Opera as Sarastro in Die Zauberfl\u00f6te. Gregory Reinhart opened San Francisco Opera's 2008\u20132009 season as Biterolf Landgraf in a new production of Tannh\u00e4user. ==World premiere performances== * Basil Hallward in Lowell Liebermann's The Picture of Dorian Gray, world premiere, Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, 1996 * The Investigating Magistrate and The Prison Chaplain in Philippe Manoury's K..., world premiere, Op\u00e9ra Bastille, 2001 * Pilone the Philosopher and The king's guard in Pascal Dusapin's Perel\u00e0, uomo di fumo, world premiere, Op\u00e9ra Bastille, 2003 * le Bouddhiste in Alberto Bruni-Tedeschi's Secondatto, world premiere, Op\u00e9ra de Nice, 1987 ==Repertoire== Gregory Reinhart's wide ranging stage repertoire includes: * Beethoven ** Fidelio (Rocco) * Bellini ** Norma (Oroveso) * Berlioz ** Les Troyens (Panth\u00e9e) (Narbal) * Britten ** Billy Budd (Claggart) * Alberto Bruni- Tedeschi ** Secondatto (le Bouddhiste)'' * Campra ** Tancr\u00e8de (Ismenor) * Cesti ** L'Argia (Solimano) ** Orontea (Creonte) ** Semiramide (Feraspe) * Cimarosa ** Il matrimonio segreto (Lord Robinson) * Debussy ** Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (Arkel) * Donizetti ** Anna Bolena (Henry VIII) * Dusapin ** Perel\u00e0, uomo di fumo (Pilone the Philosopher/The king's guard) * Gilbert and Sullivan ** The Mikado (Poo-Bah) * Jos\u00e9 Melchor Gomis (1791\u20131836) ** La Revenant (Sir Arundel) * Gounod ** Rom\u00e9o et Juliette (Fr\u00e8re Laurent) * Handel ** Agrippina (Claudius) ** Alcina (Melisso) ** Ariodante (King of Scotland) ** Imeneo (Argenio) ** Orlando (Zoroastro) ** Saul (Saul) * Henze ** La chatte anglaise (Arnold) * Jan\u00e1\u010dek ** The Cunning Little Vixen (The Badger/The Priest) * Liebermann ** The Picture of Dorian Gray (Basil Hallward) * Manoury ** K...
