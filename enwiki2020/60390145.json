    "text": "Ana Kamien (born in 1935) is an Argentine dancer, choreographer, and actor who based most of her works in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Kamien was made notorious for challenging gender and class norms along with creating works that parodied classical ballet by mixing the dance style with contemporary dance. Kamien is best known for her self-titled piece Ana Kamien (1970), a 16mm dance film she produced with the help of filmmaker Marcelo Epstein. Rodrigo Alonso, an art critic and historian, described the piece as \"not only one of the first examples of dance for the camera in Argentina: it is also one of the best.\" == Biography == Ana Kamien was born in the year 1935 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Her father was a Polish immigrant who arrived in Argentina before World War II and her mother was a Ukrainian immigrant. She grew up in the Argentine neighborhood of Parque Patricios with her parents. Kamien was first introduced to dance through a class at her mother's night school. Kamien's mother did not have a sitter, so Kamien would go with her mother and stay in the dance room at her local night school while her mother attended class. She grew close to the dance teacher, Flora Martinez, and was able to attend dance classes for free. She presented her first public dance, Vals de las Flores, at the age of three years old at the night schools festival for children. At the age of 11, Kamien met Lida Martinolli at the Hurricane Club and joined Teatro Col\u00f3n. She felt alone and intimidated by the many girls but continued with her lessons. At the age of 15, she received a card from a friend in Tucuman raving about a contemporary dance teacher named Renate Schottelius. She arrived at one of Schottelius's classes with her mother and was impressed by the dance techniques. She found a job at a bank after graduating from secondary school in the 1950s, allowing her to help support her family. In 1958, Kamien entered the Universidad de Buenos Aires to focus on contemporary dance. Here she met fellow dancer Marilu Marini who she would later go on to choreograph many dance pieces alongside. Kamien studied with many different dance professionals such as Renate Schottelius, Maria Fux, and Dore Hoyer. In 1969, Kamien and her husband Leone Sonnino opened up a multipurpose space in the San Telmo neighborhood of Buenos Aires. Kamien would teach contemporary techniques meanwhile Sonnino used the remaining space as a photography studio. According to Kamien, > \"The dance studios were relatively safe spaces. I think they were safer than > theaters, where the word is used and things are said. They were gathering > places. The studios were filled with people. Even though it seems odd, they > were filled with men; the men felt safe, it was a place where they felt they > could express themselves, that they could be, that they could express > themselves in all possible forms. They were, I believe, cultural and > expensive asylums. It was a great boom.\" Kamien currently resides in Buenos Aires, Argentina. == Notable performances == ===Ana Kamien=== This piece was choreographed by Kamien herself at the Centro Cultural General San Martin in 1970.
