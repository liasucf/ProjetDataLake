    "text": "Saint Amador of Portugal, was a hermit in Portugal. His feast day is celebrated on 27 March. Several churches in the diocese of Guarda and elsewhere in Portugal are dedicated to him.http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1312 ==Life== Amador was born in Monsanto on the edge of the Bishopric of Guarda. He retired to the hermitage of S\u00e3o Pedro Vir-on-Corces, where he lived for many years. One day he found an abandoned newborn, whom he raised and educated, and who also became a hermit and priest in the same place. Over time, the cave where they lived was converted into a chapel. ==Legend== No one knew from where he had come nor his name, but because of his kindness, he was called Amador (\"lover\" or \"embodiment of love\"). In the neighborhood there was a woman of very bad temper who was reputed to fight with everyone. Her name was Ricarda and she was known to visit Amador, bringing him bread and fresh water. Despite her constant arguing and bad temper, Amador did not waver from his loving-kindness toward her. One day the woman went away, returning with a small child (possibly her son). Amador asked Ricarda to allow him to baptize the child, but Ricarda objected, saying that she would prefer if the child was taken by demons. According to the legend, a great storm instantly arose, the sun disappeared and a group of demons appeared and took the child, lifting it into the air. At the same time the ground opened and swallowed Ricarda. Amador prayed with such faith to save the child that the demons were forced to release it, and the child fell on a rock without receiving any harm to his feet. The hermit asked for help from God to raise the child, and God sent him a female deer every day who nourished the child with her milk. The child, growing up under Amador's care, became a monastic in the same tradition, and helped Amador as he aged. One day it was revealed that the father of the young monk had died and was suffering in purgatory, and Amador advised the young man to say Mass and to pray for his father's salvation. At some point soon after, Amador received a revelation that the prayers had been answered and the father's soul had been admitted to paradise. The boy continued to attend Amador and to praise his holiness and love until Amador's death and burial. The boy continued taking care of the church, following his master's way of life, and when he died he was buried with Amador beneath the altar of the church. ==Veneration== The chapel became a place of pilgrimage and miracles attributed to the intercession of the saint, as well as protection against aphid pests and lizards in the fields. Some churches, particularly in the diocese of Guarda, are dedicated to him. His liturgical celebration is on 27 March. ==References== ==External links== * http://purl.pt/12169/3/hg-1443-v/hg-1443-v_item1/hg-1443-v_PDF/hg-1443-v_PDF_01-B-R0300/hg-1443-v_0029_320-331_t01-B-R0300.pdf Category:Christian saints in unknown century Category:Portuguese Roman Catholic saints Category:Portuguese Roman Catholics Category:Portuguese hermits Category:Year of birth unknown Category:People from Idanha-a-Nova ",
