    "text": "The 1948\u201349 season was the 69th season of competitive football in England. ==Overview== Portsmouth won the First Division title for the first time with a team of no recognised stars and very few international players. However, it was not the first major honour for the Hampshire club, as they had been the last winners of the FA Cup before the outbreak of the war. They would retain their league title the following season. Wolverhampton Wanderers, under manager Stan Cullis and captain Billy Wright, won their first major trophy for more than 40 years when they beat Leicester City 3-1 in the final of the FA Cup. This was the beginning of a great run of success for the West Midlands side. ==Honours== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"width:15em\"|Competition!!style=\"width:15em\"|Winner!!style=\"width:15em\"|Runner- up |- |First Division||Portsmouth (1)||Manchester United |- |Second Division||Fulham||West Bromwich Albion |- |Third Division North||Hull City||Rotherham United |- |Third Division South||Swansea City||Reading |- |FA Cup||Wolverhampton Wanderers (3)||Leicester City |- |Charity Shield||Arsenal||Manchester United |- |Home Championship|||| |} Notes = Number in parentheses is the times that club has won that honour. * indicates new record for competition ==Football League== ===First Division=== ===Second Division=== ===Third Division North=== ===Third Division South=== ===Top goalscorers=== First Division *Willie Moir (Bolton Wanderers) \u2013 25 goals Second Division *Charlie Wayman (Southampton) \u2013 32 goals Third Division North *Wally Ardron (Rotherham United) \u2013 29 goals Third Division South *Doug McGibbon (Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic) \u2013 30 goals ==References== ",
