    "text": "The Sarine (in French) or Saane (in German) is a major river of Switzerland.6th longest, 7th largest basin, see List of rivers of Switzerland It is long and has a drainage area of . It is a tributary of the Aare. The Sarine rises in the Bernese Alps, near Sanetschhorn, in the Canton of Valais. It forms the Lac de S\u00e9nin (French; ) reservoir at 2034 m, and then enters the Canton of Bern, traversing the Sanetsch falls between 1900 and 1400 m. It then forms the westernmost valley of the Bernese Oberland, flowing past Gsteig, Gstaad and Saanen in the Obersimmental-Saanen district. Downstream of Saanen, at 982 m, it enters the Canton of Vaud, passing Rougemont, Ch\u00e2teau-d'\u0152x and Rossini\u00e8re, forming the Lac du Vernex at 859 m. At 833, it traverses the Creux de l'Enfer and enters the Canton of Fribourg, forming Lac de Montbovon at 777 m. From this point, it more or less follows the linguistic boundary between French- and German-speaking Switzerland across the bilingual canton of Fribourg (and is often identified as the geographic representation of the R\u00f6stigraben division of Switzerland). Passing Villars-sous-Mont, Enney, Gruy\u00e8res and Broc, it reaches Lac de la Gruy\u00e8re at 677 m. It then continues in serpentines towards Fribourg itself; the historical city was built in 1157 on a peninsula of the River Sarine, protected on three sides by steep cliffs. Downstream of Fribourg, it widens into the Schiffenensee reservoir at 532 m (built 1963), and is then taken to Laupen in a channel, where it is joined by the Sense. Flowing north for another 6 km, it finally joins the Aar just downstream of Wohlensee, at 461 m, some west of Bern. ==Reservoirs== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Reservoirs on the Saane/Sarine river |- !
