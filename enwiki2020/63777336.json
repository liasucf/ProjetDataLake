    "text": "\"ILY (I Love You Baby)\" (stylized as \"ily (i love you baby)\" in all lowercase), originally titled \"ILY\", is a song by American producer Surf Mesa featuring vocals by Emilee Flood. It was first released on November 26, 2019. When the song was re-released through Astralwerks and Universal in February 2020, it started gaining popularity through user-generated clips on the app TikTok. The song has since topped the Romanian Airplay 100 chart. It further reached the top 10 in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Switzerland, as well as the top 40 in Australia, Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Ireland, Lithuania, New Zealand, and Norway. The song's lyrics are a basic repetition of part of the chorus from the 1967 song \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" by Frankie Valli. ==Background and composition== Originally just titled \"ILY\", the song was renamed as \"ILY (I Love You Baby)\" to make it easier for people to find the song. Mike Wass of Idolator described the song as a \"chorus on a loop over a dreamy synth-scape that falls somewhere between Petit Biscuit and Kasbo\" and praised it as \"the perfect soundtrack to any blissed-out moment\". Hits Daily Double called the song \"the heating-up club banger\" version of the original. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Canada (Canadian Hot 100) | 37 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Estonia (Eesti Ekspress) | 38 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Global 200 (Billboard) | 56 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Greece (IFPI) | 78 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania (AGATA) | 11 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Malaysia (RIM) | 7 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand (RMNZ) | 16 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Romania (Airplay 100) | 1 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Serbia (Radiomonitor) | 3 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Singapore (RIAS) | 10 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Slovenia (SloTop50) | 6 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spain (PROMUSICAE) | 52 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Hot 100 | 28 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Adult Top 40 (Billboard) | 22 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Mainstream Top 40 (Billboard) | 5 |} ==Certifications== == Other versions == === ARTY Remix === On May, 2020, Russian DJ Arty remixed the track.
