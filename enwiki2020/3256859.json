    "text": "The Latin Archdiocese of Lviv () was erected on August 28, 1412 in the city of Lw\u00f3w (today Lviv). It serves as a metropolitan see of the Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine. The principal patron of the Archdiocese is the Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of Mercy. Archdiocese of Lviv today is divided between Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Roman Catholic Church and Armenian Catholic Church. Armenian Catholic Church has only one diocese in Ukraine and vacant since 1954. ==History== In 1909 Pope Pius X proclaimed the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Poland and Blessed Jakub Strzemi\u0119 to be the patrons of the Lviv archdiocese.
