    "text": "'Frisco Mabel Joy is a 1971 studio album by singer-songwriter Mickey Newbury. This was the second of three albums Newbury recorded at Cinderella Sound. The album includes the original version of \"An American Trilogy\", which Elvis Presley later performed in his Las Vegas shows with much success. \"How Many Times (Must the Piper Be Paid for His Song)\" is a dramatically re-imagined version of a song first released on Harlequin Melodies, Newbury's RCA debut. Other standout tracks include \"The Future's Not What It Used to Be\", \"Remember the Good\", \"Frisco Depot\", and \"How I Love Them Old Songs\". The track \"San Francisco Mabel Joy\" was not initially part of the album, though it is included on some versions. \u2019Frisco Mabel Joy was collected for CD issue on the eight-disc Mickey Newbury Collection from Mountain Retreat, Newbury's own label in the mid-1990s, along with nine other Newbury albums from 1969 to 1981. In 2011, it was reissued again, both separately and as part of the four- disc Mickey Newbury box set An American Trilogy, alongside two other albums recorded at Cinderella Sound, Looks Like Rain and Heaven Help the Child. This release marks the first time that 'Frisco Mabel Joy has been released on CD in remastered form, after the original master tapes (long thought to have been destroyed in a fire) were rediscovered in 2010. ==Track listing== All songs written by Mickey Newbury, except where noted. # \"An American Trilogy\" (Newbury/traditional) \u2013 4:50 # \"How Many Times (Must the Piper Be Paid for His Song)\" \u2013 5:48 # \"Interlude\" \u2013 1:44 # \"The Future's Not What It Used to Be\" \u2013 4:14 # \"Mobile Blue\" \u2013 2:48 # \"Frisco Depot\" \u2013 3:38 # \"You're Not My Same Sweet Baby\" \u2013 3:46 # \"Interlude\" \u2013 1:05 # \"Remember the Good\" \u2013 2:57 # \"Swiss Cottage Place\" \u2013 3:10 # \"How I Love Them Old Songs\" \u2013 3:50 # \"San Francisco Mabel Joy\" \u2013 5:17 == Personnel == * Mickey Newbury \u2013 guitar, lead vocals * Dennis Linde \u2013 guitar, background vocals * Charlie McCoy \u2013 guitar, harmonica * Bobby Thompson \u2013 banjo, guitar * Wayne Moss \u2013 guitar * Weldon Myrick \u2013 steel guitar * Beegie Adair \u2013 keyboards * Jimmy Capps \u2013 guitar * Jim Isbell \u2013 drums * Buddy Spicher \u2013 drums * Farrell Morris \u2013 percussion * Bob Beckham * John Harris * John Moss * Charles Navarro * Walker Sill == Production == * Producer: Dennis Linde/Owsley Manier/Robert Rosemurgy * Recording Engineer: Wayne Linde/Wayne Moss * Art Direction: Robert L.
