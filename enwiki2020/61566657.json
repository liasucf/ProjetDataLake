Early in his career (1993) Letelier worked with Dmitrii Vladimirovich Gal'tsov to define what has become known as The Letelier-Gal'tsov spacetime. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from the Boston University in 1977 under John Stachel. He joined the faculty of the University of Brasilia until 1988 when became a Professor of Mathematical Physics in the Department of Applied Mathematics of UNICAMP. His last published work is a study of the three-body problem with Tiago Amancio da Silva. See also the Tom Banks' paper \"A Critique of Pure String Theory: Heterodox Opinions of Diverse Dimensions.\" published in 2003.
