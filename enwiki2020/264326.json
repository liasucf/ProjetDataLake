Empresa de Transporte A\u00e9reo del Per\u00fa S.A., usually known as Aeroper\u00fa, was a Peruvian airline, serving as flag carrier of Peru from 1973 to 1999. The company was headquartered in Lima, with the city's Jorge Chavez International Airport serving as its hub. Besides an extensive domestic route network, Aeroper\u00fa offered international flights to places in Latin America and the United States of America.Aeroper\u00fa timetable. Issued November 15, 1975 The company had around 1,500 employees. ==History== Aeroper\u00fa was formed on 22 May 1973 following the reorganization of SATCO, an earlier airline founded on 1960 and controlled by the Peruvian Army. Initially a wholly state-owned company with a fleet of three Fokker F28 Fellowships taken over from SATCO, revenue flights were commenced in October on the Lima-Cusco route. Soon, a Boeing 727 joined the fleet, and the airline placed an order for two new Fokker F27 Friendships. In 1974, two Douglas DC-8s were acquired from Viasa, which allowed the launch of international routes. The inaugural international flight to Buenos Aires took place on 29 July of that year, soon followed by a scheduled service to Miami. By 1978, the Aeroper\u00fa network had grown to include a multitude of destinations in Latin America, and also the US cities of New York and Los Angeles due to their large Latino populations. In July 1981, Aeroper\u00fa was gradually privatized, with the Peruvian government keeping a minority share of 20 percent. In 1982, plans were made for a merger with Faucett Per\u00fa, the other large passenger airline in the country at that time. As a preparatory measure, redundancies in the route networks of the two airlines were removed, so that Aeroper\u00fa had to suspend flights to a number of destinations, including Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, New York City and Los Angeles. No further steps were taken towards merging the two airlines, and so in 1983 flights to several destinations recommenced. A bilateral air traffic agreement between Peru and the United States expired on 11 November 1983. Because of disagreements over the granting of fifth freedom rights, all flights between the two countries were suspended in May 1984 until mid-1985, which affected Aeroper\u00fa's Lima- Miami route. In 1993, Aerom\u00e9xico acquired 70 percent of the shares worth $54 million, thus making Aeroper\u00fa its subsidiary. Subsequently two Boeing 757-200 airliners were transferred, allowing Aeroper\u00fa to replace their ageing DC-8s. In 1996, 47 percent of Aeroper\u00fa was transferred to Cintra, the parent company of Aerom\u00e9xico and Mexicana de Aviaci\u00f3n. The three airlines entered mutual codeshare agreements under the Alas de Americas name, with Aeroper\u00fa joining Club Permier, the frequent-flyer program of Aerom\u00e9xico. Between 1996 and 1997, Aerop\u00e9ru maintained a second base at Bogot\u00e1's El Dorado International Airport in Colombia, from where regional flights were offered. In 1998, Delta Air Lines became a major shareholder of Aeroper\u00fa, when they acquired a 35 percent stake in the airline. The agreement saw Cintra reducing their share to an equal 35 percent. Due to financial difficulties that had troubled the airline for most of its existence, Aeroper\u00fa was forced to suspend all flight operations on 10 March 1999. Several plans for a relaunch were made, which included a possible buy-in of Continental Airlines or a takeover by a group of foreign investors. None of these materialized, and Aeroper\u00fa was liquidated on 18 August 1999. Most of its route network as well as the role of Peruvian flag carrier was taken over by newly founded LAN Per\u00fa. ===Aeroperu chorus=== Aeroperu boasted of a well known musical chorus, Coro de Aeroperu, consisting of a set of singers from within Aeroperu's pilots and flight attendants.http://www.mtv.com/artists/coro-aeroperu/ The chorus released two albums which also became promotional items for the airline, \"El Canto del Peru para la gente de las Americas\" (\"Peru's songs for the people of the Americas\") and \"Musica en la ruta del Sol\" (Music on the sun route).http://www.musicstack.com/item/57567542 ==Destinations== With Lima Airport being its most important hub, Aeroper\u00fa maintained an extensive domestic route network. International flights were offered to a number of cities in Latin America, as well as the United States. ==Fleet== Over the years, Aeroper\u00fa operated the following aircraft types:https://www.planespotters.net/airline/Aeroperu {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; text-align:center\" |+ Aeroperu fleet |- !Aircraft !Total !Introduced !Retired !Notes |- |Boeing 727-100 | |1974 |1998 | |- |Boeing 727-200 |12 |1994 |1999 | |- |Boeing 737-200 |4 |1998 |1999 | |- |Boeing 757-200 |7 |1994 |1999 | |- |Boeing 767-200 |1 |1990 |1990 |Leased from Britannia Airways |- |Douglas DC-8-40 |1 |1978 |1978 |Leased from Air Jamaica |- |Douglas DC-8-50 |6 |1974 |1981 | |- |Douglas DC-8-60 |5 |1988 |1994 | |- |Douglas DC-8-60H |2 |1989 |1993 | |- |Fokker F-27 Friendship |3 |1974 |1984 | |- |Fokker F-28 Fellowship |1 |1973 |1998 | |- |McDonnell Douglas DC-10-15 |3 |1993 |1997 |Leased from Mexicana |- |McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 |1 |1994 |1995 |Leased from Canadian Airlines |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Lockheed L-1011 Tristar |2 |1978 |1985 | |- |1 |1991 |1998 | |- |} ==Accidents and incidents== N52AW, the Boeing 757-200 destroyed in the crash of Flight 603, is seen here landing at Miami International Airport. *On 25 October 1988, in Aeroper\u00fa Flight 772, an Aeroper\u00fa Fokker F28 Fellowship (registered OB-R-1020) took off at Inca Manco C\u00e1pac International Airport for a domestic flight to Arequipa, but failed to obtain any substantial height. Subsequently, the aircraft hit the ground and broke up into several pieces. Of the 65 passengers on board, 11 were killed, as well as one crew member. *On 2 October 1996, 70 people died in the disaster of Flight 603. The Boeing 757-200 registered N52AW had been en route a scheduled flight from Lima to Santiago de Chile when it crashed into the Pacific Ocean at 01:11 local time. The investigation revealed that during earlier maintenance work, a protective tape covering the static ports of the airplane had not been removed, which resulted in incorrect instrument data being delivered to the pilots during the accident flight. ==References== ==External links== * Aeroper\u00fa website (archives) * older Aeroper\u00fa domain (archives) * Castillo Maza, Juan. \"EVALUACI\u00d3N DEL PROCESO DE PRIVATIZACI\u00d3N DE LAS EMPRESA DE SERVICIOS P\u00daBLICOS 1991-2000.\" Gesti\u00f3n en el Tercer Milenio.
