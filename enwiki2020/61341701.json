    "text": "Jovan Isailovi\u0107 Sr. was a Serbian icon and mural painter who lived and worked in the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century. In 1772 he started painting an iconostasis in the Church of St. George in Sombor with fellow painters Teodor Kra\u010dun and Lazar Serdanovi\u0107. The iconostasis in the Serbian Orthodox Monastery of Saint George, better known as Sveti \u0110ura\u0111 monastery in Romanian Banat, is also linked to Jovan Isailovi\u0107 Senior, dating from 1803 to 1804, and presenting a strong Byzantine influence. Isailovi\u0107 Senior also worked with his colleague painter Janko Halkozovi\u0107. Many of the iconostasis and icons attributed to him were pillaged during World War II. ==See also== * List of painters from Serbia * Serbian art == References == Category:18th-century Serbian painters Category:19th-century Serbian painters Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Muralists Category:Place of death unknown Category:Place of birth unknown Category:Icon painters ",
