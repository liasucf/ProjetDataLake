Studien zu einer Ern\u00e4hrungsgeographie Deutschlands zwischen 1860 und 1930, Teil 4. Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart 2003, , S. 173 (Studien zur Geschichte des Alltags; Bd. 21). named after Gaisburg, a district of Stuttgart. The meat, cooked in a strong beef broth, is cut into cubes and served with cooked potatoes and Sp\u00e4tzle. The broth is poured over the dish before topping with golden-brown onions fried in butter. One explanation for the name Gaisburger Marsch is that the dish was so popular in the 19th century among officer candidates that they marched all the way to Gaisburg where their favorite dish was served in the restaurant called B\u00e4ckerschmide. Another version claims that locals from Gaisburg became prisoners of war and their women were only allowed to bring them one meal every day, so they created this nourishing dish and marched with it to the camp. The district of Gaisburg (today part Stuttgart Ost) hosts annual celebrations with a festival lasting several days. Gaisburger Marsch is the favourite food of ex-Bundespr\u00e4sident Horst K\u00f6hler, Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Chef Harald Wohlfahrt. ==See also== * List of stews ==References== Category:Beef dishes Category:German stews Category:Swabian cuisine ",
