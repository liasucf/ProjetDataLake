He was also a finalist for the Northern California Book Critics Award in 2005 and a year later was selected for a Witter Bynner Fellowship in poetry from the Library of Congress. Varied in subject and form, Stroud\u2019s poems include six-line lyrics, narrative prose poems, odes, homages, sustained contemplations, suites, and brief epigrammatic offerings. However it is substance, whatever form it takes, that interests him. His poetry articulates a voyage through places and times and voices, often sifting through the details of daily life, searching for miracles (\u201cInside the pear there\u2019s a paradise we will never know, our only hint the sweetness of its taste.\u201d - Comice, Below Cold Mountain). He divides his time between his home in Santa Cruz, California, and a cabin in the Sierra Nevada.\"Joseph Stroud\", Good Times Weekly, 31 December 2008 ==Awards== * 2000 Pushcart Prize * 2005 finalist for the Northern California Book Critics Award * 2006 Witter Bynner Fellowship in poetry from the Library of Congress. * 2011 Arts and Letters Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. ==Works== * * * * * ===Anthologies=== * * ==References== Category:Living people Category:American male poets Category:University of San Francisco alumni Category:San Francisco State University alumni Category:Writers from Glendale, California Category:California State University, Los Angeles alumni Category:1943 births ",
