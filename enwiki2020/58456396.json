Drowned in Sound scored the album highly, reviewer Sajini Wijetilleka had particular praise for \"Can't Smile\", speaking of the track; \"Sequenced-synth loops, emotional vocals and energised guitar swirls give us the excellent \u2018Can\u2019t Smile\u2019, the best record that Gavin Rossdale wanted to, but could never ever make.\". NME reviewer April Long gave the album positive write up stating; \"The title says it all. Underpinning every spastic roar and raging riff on Vex Red\u2018s debut is the burning desire to make something enormous, resonant and real.\".
