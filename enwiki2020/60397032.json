She formerly worked in the advertising industry for ten years before pursuing an art career. ==Biography== Samantha Kirk was born in Chicago in 1981. In Kirk's sophomore year of high school, she discovered art was an outlet for her to communicate her queer identity which she later integrated into her artwork. Later in life, Kirk worked in the advertising industry as an integrated marketing specialist for 10 years, eventually leaving the industry. Kirk felt the advertising industry no longer challenged her and was not paying enough. In 2010, the opportunity to pursue an art career presented itself when she was offered 2 huge art commissions.
