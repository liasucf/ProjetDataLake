The song is Eminem's response to Machine Gun Kelly's \"Rap Devil\" that was released in 2018 after Eminem dissed MGK in his song \"Not Alike\" from his tenth studio album Kamikaze. ==Background and release== In 2012, Machine Gun Kelly made a tweet about Eminem's daughter, Hailie Mathers (who was then sixteen). The tweet read, \"ok so I just saw a picture of Eminem's daughter...and I have to say, she is hot as fuck, in the most respectful way possible cuz Em is king\". MGK claimed to apologize to Eminem behind the scenes. After this, in 2015, Eminem allegedly banned him from going to Shade 45, a radio station owned by Eminem. In 2017, MGK was on Power 106 FM and did a freestyle with The LA Leakers. During this, he again claimed Eminem had banned him from Shade 45. MGK also collaborated on a song with Tech N9ne in March 2018, and sent subliminal disses towards Eminem. On August 31, 2018, Eminem released a surprise album Kamikaze in which he dissed several artists, including MGK.

After MGK's response, Eminem released an interview with Sway Calloway, in which Eminem was asked about the feud.
