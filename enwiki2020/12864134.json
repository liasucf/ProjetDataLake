The film was released on August 16, 2007 in Puerto Rico. It was produced by Cines\u00ed Productions. ==Plot== The film follows the actions of a corrupt police captain, the title- character \u00c1ngel Lugo, performed by Braulio Castillo, hijo. Lugo is responsible for the wrongful imprisonment of Mariano Far\u00edas (Morales) and the murder of his pregnant wife (Sara Jarque). After 15 years in a federal prison, Far\u00edas is still determined to prove his innocence. For that, he recruits the help of Juan Miranda, the district attorney that originally prosecuted him, who is now a retired alcoholic. Meanwhile, Lugo is still trying to keep his involvement in Far\u00edas' case and other wrongdoings under wraps. To accomplish it, he bribes his accomplice Villanueva (Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix G\u00f3mez) into helping him. Villanueva is now having second thoughts about his involvement and only wants to protect his wife and grandson. Involved in everything is a female reporter, Julia Norat (Yamaris Latorre), who receives exclusive information from Lugo and has also become his lover. However, upon meeting Far\u00edas, Norat is quickly charmed by him. ==Cast== * Braulio Castillo, hijo - Captain \u00c1ngel Lugo * Jacobo Morales - Mariano Far\u00edas * Yamaris Latorre - Julia Norat * Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix G\u00f3mez - Sergeant Jos\u00e9 \"Cheo\" Villanueva * Miguel \u00c1ngel Su\u00e1rez - Juan S.
