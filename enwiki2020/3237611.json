Henrietta was born in 1687, the daughter of the 9th Earl of Derby. He died in 1709 and one of his titles, Baron Strange, fell into abeyance between Lady Henrietta and her younger sister Lady Elizabeth. On Lady Elizabeth's death in 1714 Henrietta became the sole heir and succeeded to the title. On 21 May 1706, she married the 4th Earl of Anglesey and so became the Countess of Anglesey. The Earl of Anglesey died in 1710. Henrietta then married the 3rd Baron Ashburnham (later created Earl of Ashburnham) on 24 July 1714 and became Lady Ashburnham. They had one child, also called Lady Henrietta, who succeeded her mother as Baroness Strange. The 4th Lady Strange died in 1718 and was buried at Ashburnham, East Sussex. Some years following her death, Parliamentary intervention was required to settle the ownership of the Bretherton estate which she had inherited. ==References== *Cokayne, George Edward, The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant, A.
