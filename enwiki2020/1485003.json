Around 1850, Jos\u00e9 Pereira Alves and his wife, Ignez Leite de Toledo donated a large area of land to the town, with the purpose of building a great church in honor of St. Benedict. The town's folk went in a religious procession to retrieve an image of the saint from the nearest chapel (which was almost in Sapuca\u00ed-Mirim, Minas Gerais), and then the \"Igreja Matriz de S\u00e3o Bento\" (St. Benedict's Matrix Church) started to be built by the slaves. Still today, you can find in there paintings of well-known artists that date back to 1853. ==Geography== A View of S\u00e3o Bento do Sapuca\u00ed countryside from SP-042 highway.
