The website's critical consensus reads, \"Flashy, but somewhat frivolous, The Morning Show often feels more like a vanity project than the hard-hitting drama it aspires to be\u2014but there is pleasure to be had in watching Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon give it their all.\" Audiences on Rotten Tomatoes however, by contrast, rated the first season of the series at 93%. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 61 out of 100 based on reviews from 37 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a positive review and wrote: \"The Morning Show doesn't have the cinematic gravitas of the Showtime series The Loudest Voice or the Aaron Sorkin poetry of HBO's The Newsroom. It's more along the lines of the solid but underachieving Sports Night TV series from the late 1990s.\" ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year ! Award ! Category !
