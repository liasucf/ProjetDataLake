    "text": "\"I Can't Escape from You\" is a song written by Hank Williams. The song was originally recorded as a demo by Williams probably in 1951 but he never recorded it in a studio with a band. MGM released an overdubbed version in 1953 with backing from the Drifting Cowboys. The song contains the bitter testimony of a man haunted by the memory of a woman who has \"a heart of stone.\" Like many of the demos that feature just Williams and his guitar, the original performance is artlessly affecting and displays his spare, haunting lyrics: ::A jug of wine to numb my mind ::But what good does it do? ::The jug runs dry and still I cry ::I can't escape from you ::These wasted tears are souvenirs ::Of a love I thought was true ::Your memory is chained to me ::I can't escape from you ==Cover versions== * Ray Price recorded the song for Columbia on July 8, 1952 * Jack Scott cut a version of the song. * George Jones recorded a version of the song. * The The also recorded it for their Williams tribute LP Hanky Panky. ==Discography== ==References== Category:Hank Williams songs ",
