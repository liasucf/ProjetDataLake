As of 1940, Kherwara was one of the 8 districts of Udaipur State (possibly with boundaries similar to present- day Kherwara tehsil). With the formation of the United State of Rajasthan (precursor to the state of Rajasthan) in 1948, the new district of Udaipur was constituted which included the area of present-day Kherwara tehsil. In 2008, 79 villages were carved out of Kherwara tehsil to form, along with 19 villages from Sarada tehsil, the new tehsil of Rishabhdeo. ==Geography== The area of Kherwara tehsil is 594 square kilometres. The tehsil is bordered by Jhadol tehsil to the north, Rishabdeo tehsil to the east, Dungarpur district to the south, and the state of Gujarat to the west.

The annual average rainfall in Kherwara tehsil is 594 mm, with an average of 30 rainy days per year. == Demographics == The population of Kherwara tehsil is 2,06,777, with a women to men ratio of 96%. 73% of the population belongs to scheduled tribes. 96% of the population of the tehsil is rural and the literacy rate of the tehsil is 54%.
