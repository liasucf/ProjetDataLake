    "text": "Entertainment Tonight (or simply ET) is an American first-run syndicated entertainment television newsmagazine that is distributed by CBS Television Distribution throughout the United States and owned by CBS Interactive. ==Format== The format of the program is composed of stories of interest from throughout the entertainment industry, exclusive set visits, first looks at upcoming film and television projects, and one-on-one interviews with actors, musicians and other entertainment personalities and newsmakers. Logo used until 2014; all on-air logos used since 1994 are based on the lead \"E\" and end \"T\" in \"Entertainment\" seen in the original 1981 logo, but have solely used the abbreviated \"ET\" name. A one-hour weekend edition, ET Weekend (known as Entertainment This Week until September 1991), originally offered a recap of the week's entertainment news, with most or all episodes later transitioning to center (either primarily or exclusively) around some sort of special theme; though the weekend edition now utilizes either format depending on the episode, most commonly, the format of those broadcasts consists of replays of stories that were shown during the previous week's editions. ET Radio Minute, a daily radio feature, is syndicated by Westwood One. As of 2018, the program's weekday broadcasts are anchored by Kevin Frazier, while the weekend editions are anchored by Cameron Mathison and Nischelle Turner. In November 2018, CBS launched a free, 24-hour over-the-top streaming service known as ET Live; it features the correspondents from the linear show with expanded coverage of entertainment news. It is available via web browsers, apps, and most recently, the free streaming service Pluto TV (which added ET Live to its channel lineup in November 2019). ==History== In its early years from its 1981 inception, Entertainment Tonight \u2013 following a local newscast-style format \u2013 consisted primarily of coverage of the latest movies, music and television releases and projects. They signed an exclusive agreement to cover the wedding of convicted child molester Mary Kay Letourneau, who married the student she had an affair with, Vili Fualaau; and attorney Howard K. Stern, who represented Daniel Birkhead in the paternity case of the late Anna Nicole Smith's daughter Dannielynn. ET has also aired exclusive stories related to Anna Nicole Smith, including coverage of her funeral, and her surviving daughter. In 1996, actor George Clooney decided to boycott Entertainment Tonight to protest the presence of intrusive paparazzi after Hard Copy did an expos\u00e9 about his love life, violating an agreement that he had with Paramount, which produced and syndicated both shows. In a letter he sent to Paramount, Clooney stated that he would encourage his friends to do the same. On September 8, 2008, Entertainment Tonight began broadcasting in high definition; concurrently, the program moved its production and studio operations from its longtime home at Stage 28 on the Paramount Pictures studio lot to Stage 4 at CBS Studio Center, one of the final steps involving the incorporation of Paramount's former syndication arm, Paramount Domestic Television, into CBS' distribution arms and the adoption of the then-new CBS Television Distribution name, which all took place following the breakup of CBS and the original Viacom into separate companies in December 2005. After pressure via a social media campaign by actors Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell, ET announced in February 2014 that it would no longer accept footage or pictures of the children of celebrities from paparazzi photographers. This show is the longest-running syndicated show, surpassing Soul Train, which had a 37-year run. ==On-air staff== ===Current on-air staff=== ==== Anchor ==== * Kevin Frazier \u2013 anchor (2014\u2013present; previously served as weekend co- anchor/correspondent from 2004\u20132011) ====Correspondents==== * Brooke Anderson \u2013 contributor/substitute weekday anchor (2019\u2013present; previously served as substitute weekday anchor/correspondent from 2013\u20132015 and as contributor from 2015\u20142018) * Matt Cohen - weekend anchor/correspondent/substitute weekday anchor (2019\u2013present) * Keltie Knight \u2013 correspondent/substitute weekend anchor/substitute weekday anchor (2017\u2013present) * Rachel Smith \u2013 New York correspondent (2019\u2013present) * Nischelle Turner \u2013 weekend anchor/correspondent/substitute weekday anchor (2014\u2013present) * Lauren Zima \u2013 correspondent (2019\u2013present) ===Former on-air staff=== * Thea Andrews \u2013 fill- in weekend host/correspondent (2006\u20132009; later at The Insider) * Army Archerd \u2013 correspondent (1981; deceased) * Alan Arthur - weekend co-host (1983\u20131984) * Rona Barrett \u2013 correspondent (1983\u20131986) * Nina Blackwood - correspondent (?\u2013?) * Chris Booker \u2013 correspondent (2002\u20132003) * Mindy Burbano - correspondent (?\u2013?) * Eric Burns \u2013 correspondent (?\u2013?) * Lisa Canning \u2013 correspondent (1995\u20131998) * Jann Carl \u2013 fill-in weekend host/correspondent (1995\u20132008) * Marcia Clark \u2013 correspondent (?\u2013?) * Steven Cojocaru \u2013 fashion correspondent (2003\u20132011) * Bobby Colomby \u2013 correspondent (?\u2013?) * Leanza Cornett \u2013 correspondent (1994\u20131995) * Rocsi Diaz \u2013 weekend co- anchor/correspondent (2013\u20132015) * Steve Edwards - weekend co-host (1982\u20131983) * Leeza Gibbons \u2013 fill-in host/correspondent (1984\u20131995; later at Extra and co-host of America Now) * Garrett Glaser - correspondent (1989-1993) * Bob Goen \u2013 co-host/correspondent (1993\u20132004; now at WCPO-TV in Cincinnati) * Tom Hallick \u2013 host/correspondent (1981) * Bill Harris - correspondent (1984\u20131985, deceased) * Samantha Harris \u2013 correspondent (2010\u20132012, 2015\u20132016)/weekend co- anchor/substitute weekday anchor (2015\u20132016, now back at Extra) * Mary Hart \u2013 co-host/correspondent (1982\u20132011) * Alan Hemberger (as Alan Arthur) - correspondent (?\u2013?) * Ron Hendren \u2013 original co-host (1981\u20131984) * Barbara Howar - correspondent (1982\u2013?) * Huell Howser \u2013 correspondent (1982\u20131983; deceased) * Darren Kavinoky \u2013 correspondent (?\u2013?; later at The Insider) * Robin Leach \u2013 correspondent (1981\u20131984; deceased) * Chrishaunda Lee \u2013 correspondent (?\u2013?) * Leonard Maltin \u2013 film historian/reviewer (1982\u20132010) * Katherine Mann - correspondent (?\u2013?) * Rob Marciano \u2013 weekday/weekend co- anchor (2013\u20132014; now at ABC News) * Cameron Mathison \u2013 weekend anchor/correspondent (2015\u20132018; now co-host of Home and Family on Hallmark Channel) * Maria Menounos \u2013 correspondent (2001\u20132005; later at Extra and E!
