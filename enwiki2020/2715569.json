    "text": "Josephine M. Workman better known by her stage name, Princess Mona Darkfeather (January 13, 1882 \u2013 September 3, 1977) was an American actress who starred in Native American and Western dramas. During the silent era of motion pictures, from 1911 to 1917, she appeared in 102 movies. She is best known for her role as Prairie Flower in The Vanishing Tribe (1914). Her career began in 1909 when she replied to a local newspaper advertisement placed by producer/director Thomas Ince's Bison Motion Pictures. During a time when studios rarely hired Native Americans, the movie studio was looking for an actress with the physical attributes to portray an American Indian and who was physically capable of doing stunts and riding horses. While she had never acted before, Workman fit the appearance that Ince wanted. She apparently embellished her riding skills, as she did not have any, but nevertheless quickly learned horsemanship. Given the stage name Mona Darkfeather (and later \"Princess\" Mona Darkfeather), she was cast in her first starring role as an Indian maiden named Owanee in the 1911 movie Owanee's Great Love. ==Early life== She was born Josephine M. Workman in Boyle Heights, California, and baptized at the Plaza Church, Los Angeles, when she was four months old,\"Old Baptismal Book In Court \u2013 Plaza Church Tome Evidence in Million Dollar Case \u2013 Used to Prove Age of Heir to the Workman Estate \u2013 Many Pioneers Witnesses in Battle for Rich Lands.\" Los Angeles Times.

Her siblings were Mary Cristina Workman (1870\u20131963); Agnes Elizabeth Workman (1872\u20131957); Marie Lucile \"Lucy\" Workman (1875\u20131944); William Joseph Workman (1877\u20131956); George D. Workman (1879\u20131903); and Nellie Workman (1886\u20131888). Her grandparents were William Workman (1799-1876), a native of England, and Nicolasa Urioste (1802-1892), who hailed from the (specifically Taos Pueblo) of New Mexico. See Darkfeather's profile https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0201310/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm According to the Workman and Temple Family Homestead Museum, her paternal grandmother Nicolasa was of Taos Pueblo descent. Her mother was of Scottish and Chilean descent. Darkfeather claimed Spanish ancestry as well. She was a member of the prominent pioneer Workman family of Los Angeles. In 1870, her grandfather, William Workman (1799\u20131876), deeded of land, a portion of the Rancho La Puente, to his son, Joseph M. Workman. Through this deed, the land would go to Joseph's children upon his death. Her parents separated in 1893, and Josephine lived with her mother. Joseph Workman deeded his Rancho La Puente land to O.T. Bassett, in 1895. On March 22, 1915,Los Angeles County, CA, Marriage Records, Book 232, Page 327, March 22, 1915, David D. Parten and Josephine M. Workman. Josephine (Belt) Workman married David D.

Mar. 14, 1929. p. A3. ==Married life== Darkfeather married film director and actor Frank E. Montgomery (born Frank Akley; 1870\u20131944) in 1912. In 1914, Frank E. Montgomery moved to Spokane, Washington to open and direct at the Frank E. Montgomery of the Spokane School of Motion Picture Acting. Darkfeather became associated with the company as an instructor. Darkfeather and Montgomery divorced in 1928. In late 1928, Darkfeather married banker and financer Alfred Wessling until their divorce in 1935. On December 23, 1937, Montgomery and Darkfeather remarried after nine years of separation and remained married until Montgomery's death in 1944. ==Film career== The War Bonnet (1914) After replying in 1909 to a Bison Motion Pictures newspaper ad, which called for \"exotic-looking girls\" to play \"Indian maidens\", she soon became famous as \"Princess Mona Darkfeather\", noted for leaping onto her pinto pony, \"Comanche\", and galloping away bareback. Darkfeather was a noted moving picture artist who regularly starred in roles of Indian and Western dramas. Although she was mostly of European and Chilean descent, Darkfeather's early publicity claimed she was a full-blooded Blackfoot Indian. She said she was an Indian Princess and had been made a blood member of the Blackfoot Nation and given the title of princess by a \"Chief Big Thunder\". The Western Border starring Mona Darkfeather, 1915 (Collection of Doug Neilson) She played Indian roles in one-reel western melodrama shorts, such as A White Indian (1912) and A Blackfoot's Conspiracy (1912), as well as feature length movies. She was by then a major movie star. She also played leading roles as Spanish women in several historical dramas. Darkfeather regularly appeared in Montgomery's films through various motion picture companies that he worked for, including Bison Company, Universal, Kalem Company, and Sawyer Inc. Under the tutelage of her husband/director Frank E Montgomery, Darkfeather played Indian and several Spanish leads in many Bison Company Productions. Darkfeather made movies for Bison starting in 1909, the Selig Polyscope Company between 1909 and 1913, Nestor Studios in 1912 and for Kalem Studios beginning in 1913. Montgomery directed her in the 101-Bison two-reeler The Massacre of the Fourth Cavalry (1912).Moving Picture World, 23 November 1912, pp.729,782; The Universal Weekly, 23 November 1912, p. 28. Other films he directed her in include A Forest Romance, For the Peace of Bear Valley and Justice of the Wild, all released in 1913, in which she played opposite Harry von Meter. Darkfeather was Cecil B. DeMille's first choice to portray the Indian wife, Nat-u-ritch, in his famous western The Squaw Man (1914), but she was too busy, as she and Montgomery were producing their own movies independently for release through the Kalem Company, and she was unavailable to play the role. The San Francisco Dramatic Review, 10 January 1914, p. 11. Princess Darkfeather, Liberty Theater, Tacoma, Washington, 1918 She and Montgomery joined the Universal Film Company in 1914 and continued to collaborate on scores of westerns. Darkfeather appeared in her last movie, The Hidden Danger, in 1917, then retired from the screen. For a while after she retired as a screen actress, she performed on the stage and headlined as Princess Darkfeather. In late August 1918, she made a special appearance at the Liberty Theater in Tacoma, Washington, as actress, singer and lecturer. In her \"rattlesnake\" dress, she appeared after each showing of the feature movie, Eyes of the World (1917) starring Monroe Salisbury, to sing and give advice to all girls in the audience with ambition to enter show business. She and her husband, Frank Montgomery, were living at 1117 3rd Avenue in Seattle, Washington, in September 1918, when he registered with the local draft board for World War I. He gave his present occupation as photoplay star manager.World War I Draft Registration Card, Microfilm Roll: 1991892, Draft Division No. 6, Sept. 12, 1918, Seattle, Wash.

Bassett to recover an interest in the Rancho La Puente land that her father sold to Bassett's father in 1895. Although she had been 12 years of age in 1895, she was never served with a summons to quit title as an heir of the property, as were her older brothers and sisters. The decision gave her a one-ninth interest in of what was said to be the largest walnut grove in California, at Bassett Station, near El Monte, and she was awarded a cash judgment for $129,163.\"Wins Fortune For One Slip \u2013 Pioneer's Grand-daughter to Get Land and Cash \u2013 Failure to Serve Child for Old Suit Held Flaw \u2013 Three Witnesses Recall Deed of Half Century Ago.\" Los Angeles Times.
