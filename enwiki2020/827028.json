    "text": "Fotolog.com (originally Fotolog.net) was a social network for sharing primarily photos. The site claimed that its vision was to build a \u201cgood\u201d social network which prioritizes the wellbeing of users. The site only allowed all members of the community to post once per day, which according to the site, was aimed to end the overuse of social networking today and the meaningless consumption of content. Today Fotolog.com is a news website based in Br\u010dko, Bosnia and Herzegovina, according to its WHOIS information. ==History== Launched in May 2002, the Fotolog site formerly generated over 3 billion page views, and received over 20 million unique visitors each month. In 2007, Fotolog.com was in the list of the top 20 busiest websites in the Alexa global site rankings.Fotolog Reaches 7 Million Member Milestone, Alexa Top 20 , March 28, 2007 Fotolog used to be a registered trademark of Fotolog, Inc., which is a privately held company backed by BV Capital, 3i and several individual investors. Fotolog headquarters were in New York City, prior to its acquisition by Hi-Media Group. The site had frequent technical problems during its growth. On December 10, 2005, the site stated that \"Fotolog is currently able to accept 1,000 new free members from each country each day\", up from 500 a day previously. According to Fotolog co-founder Scott Heiferman, upgrades had made the site much faster and as of November 16, 2005, Fotolog was generating 750 million pageviews a month.Scott Heiferman's Daily Fotolog , November 16, 2005 Originally, free members could not upload during peak hours, and only 500 people a day (per country) were allowed to register. In mid-2006, 10,000 people per day, per country were allowed to register, and on August 14, 2006, the limiting of daily registrations was removed. In 2005 Fotolog received an investment of 2.4 million dollars from BV Capital.The Blog Herald, Fotolog secured major investment from BV Capital, March 30, 2005. In Spring 2006, a book of photographs from fotolog.com was published by the UK publisher Thames & Hudson titled fotolog.book: A Global Snapshot for the Digital Age. Edited by Andrew Long and containing text contributions by Nick Currie, the book is organized in sections highlighting several themes that arose in the site's community of photographers and several individual photographers from some of the major cities and countries with many fotolog users. On August, 17th, 2007, French online advertising company HiMedia agreed to acquire Fotolog for a combination of stock and cash worth $90 million. After a few weeks of periodic downtime, on January 26, 2016 Fotolog announced (in the form of a large header message on all pages) that the site was being closed down and would become \"permanently unavailable\" on the 20th of February. However, such header was removed later. On April 24, 2018, a new website was released under fotolog.com domain, with a new logo of Fotolog as well as an overhauled design of the site. Fotolog has not officially released any announcement as of April 30, 2018, however, its official account at fotolog.com/fotolog posted the new logo on the release day of the new site and marked the photo with a small line of text saying \u201cA new chapter of Fotolog begins here\u201d. It also appreared that a new team based in Spain controlled Fotolog under a different legal entity. A letter from the new Fotolog team has been published on fotolog.com/about where they explained their vision of building a good social network that priorities user wellbeing and advocating for a meaningful and healthy way of using social network. The letter also announced the policy of \u201cOne post per day\u201d for all community, which seems to be an extension of the old Fotolog's signature feature but given a new purpose. The last activity on the redesigned Fotolog website was recorded on March 13, 2019. After that, Fotolog.com appeared as a completely new website on September 10, 2020. According to its WHOIS credentials, it now appears to be based in Br\u010dko, Bosnia and Herzegovina. ==Usage== The website used to offer both free and subscription accounts. The free version was ad-supported, and limited users to uploading one picture per day and having only 20 comments (in their \"guestbook\"). The free user could also customize their page and add other fotologs into their \"Friends/Favorites\" list. Paying members, known as \"Gold Camera patrons\" were allowed to upload up to 6 pictures a day and to have 200 comments per photo. Subsequent changes allowed Gold Cam members to comment on any guestbook that was full. Other features included customized photo-headings and having the most recent image appear beside the members name when commenting on other photoblogs. However, the current version is free for everyone and limits everyone to only post one photo per day in order to, according to the team letter, end the overuse of social networking today and the meaningless consumption of content. The old Fotolog had \"groups\" which consisted of users focusing on a certain topic, and were managed by Fotolog users themselves. Fotolog groups allowed 50 photos per day. These photos might be added by any registered member. However, the \u201cgroups\u201d feature is no longer available in the new version. Some site users, mainly in Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Spain, create so-called \"dedicated fotologs\" on their favorite actors and musicians, with images and information about them. In Argentina and Uruguay, Fotolog gave rise to a fashion trend, called 'Flogger'. Chilean urban group pokemones made use of Fotolog. ==User demographics== The site is currently based in Barcelona, Spain, though the majority of its users come from the Americas, especially South America. No latest statistics are publicly available yet as of April 2018. Previous site data showed that, as of September 2, 2008, Chile claimed the most accounts (4,827,387), Argentina was second with 4,225,209, while Brazil had 1,443,474 users. Fotolog's success prompted many other websites to appear and compete. In Spanish, and also in Portuguese, the word \"fotolog\" is almost universally understood to mean \"any photoblog\". For a time, Brazil was the country with most users; the site later lost users there to Orkut and Facebook. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Internet properties established in 2002 Category:Blog hosting services Category:American social networking websites Category:Photoblogs Category:Companies based in New York City Category:American photography websites Category:Image sharing websites Category:3i Group companies ",
