    "text": "Northern Knights is a first-class provincial cricket team in Ireland. Along with the North West Warriors and Leinster Lightning it makes up the Inter- Provincial Championship, and with those teams and Munster Reds makes up the Interprovincial One-Day Trophy & Interprovincial Twenty20 Cup. The team represents Northern Cricket Union of Ireland which in turn covers most of eastern, southern and much of western Ulster. ==History== In 2013, Cricket Ireland formed a three-day Interprovincial Championship, featuring teams from Leinster, NCU and the North West. The NCU team is known as the Northern Knights. On 8 April, they announced Eugene Moleon as their coach and Gavin Rogers as his assistant coach. Up to and including the 2016 Inter-Provincial Championship, the matches were not given first-class status. However, at an International Cricket Council meeting in October 2016, first-class status was awarded to all future matches. In January 2016, Simon Johnston head of Waringstown Cricket Club was appointed head coach of team replacing Eugene Moleon. ==Current squad== * denotes players with international caps. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:80%;\" |- ! style=\"text- align:center; background:#FF0000; color:white; | Name ! style=\"text- align:center; background:#FF0000; color:white; | Nationality ! style=\"text- align:center; background:#FF0000; color:white; | Birth date ! style=\"text- align:center; background:#FF0000; color:white; | Batting Style ! style=\"text- align:center; background:#FF0000; color:white; | Bowling Style ! style=\"text- align:center; background:#FF0000; color:white; | Club ! style=\"text- align:center; background:#FF0000; color:white; | Notes |- ! colspan=\"7\" | Batsmen |- | Adam Dennison || || || Right-handed || \u2014 || Waringstown || |- | Jamie Holmes || || || Right-handed || Right-arm leg break || Carrickfergus || |- | John Matchett || || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || C.I.Y.M.S. || |- | James Shannon || || || Right-handed || Right arm off break || Instonians || |- | Greg Thompson || || || Right-handed || Right arm leg break || Waringstown || |- ! colspan=\"7\" | All-rounders |- | Stephen Bunting || || || \u2014 || \u2014 || Instonians || |- | Shane Getkate || || || Right-handed || Right arm medium-fast || Instonians || |- | Craig Lewis || || || \u2014 || \u2014 || Derriaghy || |- | James McCollum || || || Right-handed || Right arm medium || Waringstown || |- | Lee Nelson || || || Right-handed || Right arm off break || Waringstown || |- | Nikolai Smith || || || \u2014 || \u2014 || Instonians || |- | Morgan Topping || || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || Waringstown || |- ! colspan=\"7\" | Wicket-keepers |- | Christopher Dougherty || || || Left-handed || \u2014 || C.I.Y.M.S. || |- | Michael Gilmour || || || Right-handed || \u2014 || Carrickfergus || |- | Jamie Magowan || || || Right- handed || \u2014 || Muckamore || |- | Gary Wilson || || || Right-handed || Right- arm medium || - || Captain |- ! colspan=\"7\" | Bowlers |- | Gary Kidd || || || Left-handed || Slow left-arm orthodox || Waringstown || |- | Graeme McCarter || || || Right-handed || Right arm medium || Civil Service North || |- | Robert McKinley || || || Right-handed || Right arm medium || Instonians || |- | Jacob Mulder || || || Right-handed || Right arm leg break || North Down || |- | Nathan Smith || || || \u2014 || \u2014 || Instonians || |- ! colspan=\"7\" | Source: |} ==Grounds== == References == ==External links== *The Northern Cricket Union official website *Euro Slam *Dublin Chiefs ET20S Category:Irish first-class cricket teams Category:2017 establishments in Ireland Category:Cricket in Northern Ireland ",
