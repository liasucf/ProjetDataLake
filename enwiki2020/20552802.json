On October 14, 1965, the vicariate apostolic was raised to a diocese. The first supreme pontiff to visit the island was Pope John Paul II in 1981. Guam has been sending delegations of young people to World Youth Day since 1993. ==Our Lady of Camarin== The patroness of Guam and the Marianas Islands is Our Lady of Camarin (Chamorro: Santa Marian Kamalen), a miraculous image of the Blessed Virgin Mary found by a fisherman in the waters off the island's southwest coast between the 17th and 18th centuries. The image's feast day is on 8 December--the Feast of the Immaculate Conception and a declared public holiday on the island--and is celebrated with a Mass and procession around Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a. ==References== Guam ",
