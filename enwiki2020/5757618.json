His last team was Itabaiana. ==Career== In the 2002\u201303 Turkish league season Washington scored 9 goals in 12 games, but was subsequently released by Fenerbah\u00e7e because of his health problems. Washington was submitted to a coronary catheterization. Once recovered, physicians told him that playing football would not represent a risk to his condition. He then signed with Brazilian club Atl\u00e9tico Paranaense where he was 2004 S\u00e9rie A top-scorer with 34 goals and broke the league's record. For his recovery, he was dubbed Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Valente, the title of the movie Braveheart in Brazil. In 2005, he moved to Japan to play for Tokyo Verdy in the J1 League. He had a successful season there with 22 goals in 33 games but could not save his club from relegation. In 2006, he transferred to Urawa Red Diamonds and helped the Reds win their first ever J1 League title, becoming the top scorer in the league with 26 goals in 26 games. In 2007, he was the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup top scorer, helping his team to a third-place finish in the competition. On 21 December 2007 Washington returned to Brazil to play for Fluminense. His contract was valid through the end of 2008. Washington finished as the 2008 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A top scorer, with 21 goals, tied with Keirrison and Kl\u00e9ber Pereira. Even though he renewed his contract with S\u00e3o Paulo until the end of the 2010 seasonS\u00e3o Paulo acerta com Washington por mais um ano he eventually returned to Fluminense on July 27, 2010. He played a major role in the team's run to win the 2010 S\u00e9rie A, scoring 10 goals throughout the competition and being involved in the play that guaranteed the team's championship (in the last game of the season). On 13 January 2011, while training with Fluminense in Mangaratiba, Washington announced his retirement from football. == Career statistics == === Club === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! colspan=3 | Club performance ! colspan=2 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup ! colspan=2 | League Cup ! colspan=2 | Continental ! colspan=2 | Total |- !
