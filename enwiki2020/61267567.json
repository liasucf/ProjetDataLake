    "text": "Conrad O'Sullivan (13 February 1981 \u2013 23 March 2006) was an Irish rugby union player. ==Life== Born in Cork, O'Sullivan first began playing rugby for local club Dolphin's under-10 side. He attended Presentation Brothers College, representing the school in the Munster Schools Senior Cup, before progressing to University College Cork and then joining Cork Constitution in the amateur All-Ireland League, whom he would go on to captain. Having previously played for Munster at under-20 level, O'Sullivan was drafted in to play fly-half in Munster's pre-season friendly against Connacht on 29 August 2003, despite having previously played as a centre. Munster won 38\u201312, though O'Sullivan was injured in the game, which prevented him from making his senior competitive debut for the province until their game Neath-Swansea Ospreys on 27 September 2003. Internationally, O'Sullivan represented Ireland Schools and Ireland under-21s. He died in March 2006. ==References== ==External links== *Munster Profile *Archived Celtic League Profile Category:1981 births Category:2006 deaths Category:People educated at Presentation Brothers College, Cork Category:Alumni of University College Cork Category:Rugby union players from County Cork Category:Irish rugby union players Category:Dolphin RFC players Category:Cork Constitution players Category:Munster Rugby players Category:Rugby union centres Category:Rugby union fly-halves ",
