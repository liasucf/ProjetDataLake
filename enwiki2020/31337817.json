There are two special forms, the 5-orthoplex, and 5-demicube with 10 and 16 vertices respectively. They can be visualized as symmetric orthographic projections in Coxeter planes of the D6 Coxeter group, and other subgroups. __TOC__ == Graphs == Symmetric orthographic projections of these 8 polytopes can be made in the D5, D4, D3, A3, Coxeter planes. Ak has [k+1] symmetry, Dk has [2(k-1)] symmetry. The B5 plane is included, with only half the [10] symmetry displayed. These 8 polytopes are each shown in these 5 symmetry planes, with vertices and edges drawn, and vertices colored by the number of overlapping vertices in each projective position. {| class=\"wikitable\" !rowspan=3|# !colspan=5|Coxeter plane projections !rowspan=3|Coxeter diagram = Schl\u00e4fli symbol Johnson and Bowers names |- ![10/2] ![8] ![6] ![4] ![4] |- !B5 !D5 !D4 !D3 !A3 |- !1 |80px |80px |80px |80px |80px | = h{4,3,3,3} 5-demicube Hemipenteract (hin) |- !2 |80px |80px |80px |80px |80px | = h2{4,3,3,3} Cantic 5-cube Truncated hemipenteract (thin) |- !3 |80px |80px |80px |80px |80px | = h3{4,3,3,3} Runcic 5-cube Small rhombated hemipenteract (sirhin) |- !4 |80px |80px |80px |80px |80px | = h4{4,3,3,3} Steric 5-cube Small prismated hemipenteract (siphin) |- !5 |80px |80px |80px |80px |80px | = h2,3{4,3,3,3} Runcicantic 5-cube Great rhombated hemipenteract (girhin) |- !6 |80px |80px |80px |80px |80px | = h2,4{4,3,3,3} Stericantic 5-cube Prismatotruncated hemipenteract (pithin) |- !7 |80px |80px |80px |80px |80px | = h3,4{4,3,3,3} Steriruncic 5-cube Prismatorhombated hemipenteract (pirhin) |- !8 |80px |80px |80px |80px |80px | = h2,3,4{4,3,3,3} Steriruncicantic 5-cube Great prismated hemipenteract (giphin) |} == References== * H.S.M.
