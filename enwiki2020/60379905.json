    "text": "Humbeline of Jully (c. 1091 c. 1136) was a Benedictine nun in 11th-12th century France, who was beatified in the Roman Catholic Church in 1703 by Pope Clement XI. After obtaining permission from her then-husband, Humbeline entered the community of nuns at Jully in 1133, when a charter records the tithes she contributed. She later became prioress at Jully. Humbeline was born to Tescelin de Fontaine, lord of Fontaine-l\u00e8s-Dijon, and Al\u00e8the de Montbard, both nobles of Burgundy. She was the younger sister of Bernard of Clairvaux, and her entry into the Benedictine priory at Jully, apparently at the urging of her brother, figures in accounts of Bernard of Clairvaux's life. ==References== Category:Benedictine nuns Category:1090s births Category:1130s deaths Category:Benedictine beatified people Category:French beatified people ",
