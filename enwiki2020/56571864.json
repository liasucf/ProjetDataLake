    "text": "Genoplesium validum, commonly known as the Blackdown midge orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid endemic to the Blackdown Tableland National Park in Queensland. It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to thirty five greenish-brown flowers with reddish stripes and a hairy labellum. ==Description== Genoplesium validum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf with a reddish base and long, fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between fifteen and thirty five flowers are arranged along a flowering stem long, reaching to a height . The flowers lean downwards, are greenish-brown, about long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is elliptic to narrow egg-shaped, about long, wide and greenish with narrow, dark purplish bands. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are linear to egg-shaped, about long and wide with dark purplish bands. The labellum is elliptic to broadly oblong, about long, wide and dark purplish-black with its edges densely covered with short, coarse purplish hairs. There is a dark purplish-black callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs from December to April. ==Taxonomy and naming== Genoplesium validum was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis valida. The specific epithet (validum) is a Latin word meaning \"strong\" or \"powerful\", referring to the robust habit of this orchid. ==Distribution and habitat== The Blackdown midge orchid grows in sandy soil in rocky places on the Blackdown Tableland. ==References== ==External links== * validum Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Queensland Category:Plants described in 1991 ",
