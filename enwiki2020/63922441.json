Founded in 1873, it is the oldest surviving polo club in Europe and the second oldest in the world. Its annual Varsity Match against Oxford, established in 1878, is the oldest continuing polo fixture in the world. ==History== The Varsity Polo Match, by Frank Dadd The club was founded in 1873 by the Hon John Fitzwilliam. Originally, the colours of the club were maroon and yellow and, after some discussions and the sanction of the Cambridge University Boat Club, the following rule was passed : \"That the Polo Five be allowed to wear a light blue polo shirt, white forage cap, and belt\". The first Inter-university match was held on the Bullingdon Cricket Ground in Cowley, on 27 November 1878. In 1879 the University players felt strong enough to enter a team in the Hurlingham Club's Champion Open Cup, the premier competition of the time. Although they were quickly defeated, the experience served them well and they returned later that year to defeat Oxford in the first Varsity Match. ==Varsity Match== leftThe match format is extremely uncommon as it is traditionally not handicapped. Teams are also mixed which is a rare opportunity amongst the Cambridge University Blues sports. The original conditions are as follows: \"No player eligible who has been a member of his University for more than four years, or who has not been in residence during the term in which the match takes place. Instituted in 1878. Played generally at Hurlingham, in June.\"Modern Polo, by E.D. Miller, London: Thacker and Co. 1896 p. 399. Currently, polo is a Discretionary Full Blue sport at Cambridge. Oxford and Cambridge take it in turns to host the B-Team and C-Team Varsity event on a separate weekend during Lent Term, with the Old Blues match serving as the traditional curtain raiser for Varsity Day. The match is a well-established fixture in the British sporting calendar and is now held at Guards Polo Club. ==Notable players== * Walter Buckmaster (1872\u20131942) * Frederick Freake (1876\u20131950) * John Wodehouse, 3rd Earl of Kimberley (1883\u20131941) * Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester (1900\u20131970) * Charles, Prince of Wales (b. 1948) *Stephen Sanford (1898\u20131977) *Charles Darley Miller (1868\u20131951) *Sir Max Bemrose (1904\u20131986) *Vivian Lockett (1880\u20131962) *Luke Tomlinson (b. 1977) *Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl of Burma (1900\u20131979) ==References== ==External links== * Polo Club Polo Category:Polo clubs in the United Kingdom ",
