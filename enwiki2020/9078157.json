The very narrow forewings, held folded backwards covering the hindwings and abdomen, often have pointed apices noticeably up- or down-turned. The larvae are leaf miners. The families Bucculatricidae and Bedelliidae are sometimes considered a subfamily of Lyonetiidae. ==Genera== *Acanthocnemes *Arctocoma *Atalopsycha *Busckia *Cateristis *Chrysolytis *Cladarodes *Compsoschema *Copobathra *Crobylophora *Cycloponympha *Daulocoma *Diplothectis *Erioptris *Eulyonetia *Exegetia *Hierocrobyla *Leioprora *Leucoedemia *Leucoptera *Lyonetia *Micropostega *Microthauma *Orochion *Otoptris *Petasobathra *Phyllobrostis *Platacmaea *\u2020Prolyonetia *Prytaneutis *Stegommata *Taeniodictys ==References== *Natural History Museum genus database *Family description ",
