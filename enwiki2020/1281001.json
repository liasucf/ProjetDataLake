He and his brothers Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu and Dinu Br\u0103tianu were the leaders of the National Liberal Party of Romania, founded by their father, Ion C. Br\u0103tianu. ==Biography== Born at his family's estate of Florica, in \u0218tef\u0103ne\u0219ti, Arge\u0219 County, Vintil\u0103 Br\u0103tianu started his studies at Saint Sava High School in Bucharest. He then went to France to study engineering at \u00c9cole Centrale Paris from 1886 to 1890. After returning to Romania, he entered politics. From 1907 to 1911 he was Mayor of Bucharest. During World War I, he was Minister of War (15 August 1916\u201319 July 1917) and then Minister for War Munitions. After the war, he served as Finance Minister (19 January 1922\u20139 March 1926) in the Liberal government led by his brother, Ion. After his brother died on 24 November 1927, he assumed the post of Prime Minister of Romania until he was forced to resign a year later to allow the new National Peasants' Party government of Iuliu Maniu to take office. In November 1927 he had also assumed the presidency of the National Liberal Party; he remained in that position until the end of his life. On 22 December 1930 Br\u0103tianu was at his estate in Mih\u0103e\u0219ti, V\u00e2lcea, when he had a stroke of apoplexy which paralyzed his left side; he died that evening at the hospital in nearby R\u00e2mnicu V\u00e2lcea. He is buried at the family estate, Florica, in a crypt where also lie his father Ion C. Br\u0103tianu and his brother Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu, as well as his other brother, Dinu Br\u0103tianu, and his nephew, Gheorghe I.
