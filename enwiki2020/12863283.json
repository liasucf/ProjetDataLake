    "text": "Horses at Old Friends Equine Old Friends is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) equine retirement facility in Georgetown, Kentucky, accredited by the Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance (TAA). The organization started with one leased paddock and two horses, but now owns 136 acres, Dreamchase Farm, with additional leased pasturage. It is the only Thoroughbred retirement facility in the United States that accepts stallions on a regular basis. Old Friends is currently home to over 150 retired Thoroughbred athletes. ==Background== Geldings share pastures at Old Friends, becoming close friends The facility was created in 2003 by former The Boston Globe movie critic Michael Blowen, spurred by the death of 1986 Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand in 2002. The presence of high- profile horses helps raise money, allowing after-care for more low profile horses. In 2009, Joann and Mark Pepper's farm in Greenfield Center, New York, became a satellite operation of Old Friends Equine known as Old Friends at Cabin Creek: The Bobby Frankel Division named for U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer Bobby Frankel, who died in 2009. In 2015, Old Friends announced a partnership with Kentucky Downs, with the cooperation and assistance of Simpson County Tourism. Located on the Kentucky-Tennessee border, this satellite facility can house up to 10 retired Thoroughbreds and features daily tours and a gift shop. Residents currently include Canadian Horse of the Year Thornfield, Ball Four, Rumor Has It, Hussonfirst, Lusty Latin, and Sgt. Bert. In January 2015, Old Friends was selected to receive a special Eclipse Award honoring extraordinary service or contributions to the Thoroughbred industry. In January 2016, a fire destroyed the organization's hospital/quarantine barn. Forunately, no horses or people were harmed. Plans are underway to rebuild a new fire-safe barn, aided by donations and fundraising activities. Horses are kept \"turned out\" in their pasture as much as possible, with run-in sheds available in case of bad weather. Geldings typically share a paddock with one or two others, forming tight bonds. Stallions are more territorial and are thus kept in separate pastures. They do interact with each other though, often by racing down their fences. Visitors are allowed to touch and feed most of the retirees. The board of directors consists of Michael Blowen (president), William Van Den Dool (vice president), Diane White (secretary), Rosie Napravnik, Dr. Steve Allday, Clark Nyberg, Cindy Grisolia, Suzanne Mundy, Dennis Brida, Ron Portell, Ron Wallace, Mark Otto, Barbara Fossum and Corey Johnsen. ==Notable residents== Silver Charm enjoying his retirement at Old Friends Residents at the main farm in Kentucky range from Classic winners to claimers.
