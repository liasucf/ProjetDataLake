The characteristic fascia take the form of three jagged, broken lines of white spots on the forewings, of which two semicircular rows continue over the hindwings. It flies at night from June to August The flight season refers to the British Isles. This may vary in other parts of the range. and is attracted to light. ==Biology== The larva is brown at first, turning green later, and feeds mainly on birch though it has also been recorded on alder, beech, hazel and rowan.
