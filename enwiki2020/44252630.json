    "text": "Tom Sinclair was a Scottish footballer who played as a goalkeeper at the start of the 20th century. == Career == Born in Glasgow, Sinclair began his career with Rutherglen Glencairn, winning the Scottish Junior Cup and Glasgow Junior League in 1902 alongside future Scotland internationals Jimmy McMenemy and Alec Bennett. He joined Rangers in 1904 and played there for nearly three seasons. He spent most of his time at Ibrox as a reserve, but eventually made 73 first-team appearances. However, Sinclair spent several weeks on loan at Celtic in 1906. At the start of the 1906\u201307 season, the Celtic goalkeeper Davey Adams cut his hand during a benefit match at Ibrox Stadium \u2013 the injury was caused by a nail which had been inserted through a goal-post for a five-a- side tournament. As a gesture of goodwill, Sinclair (who had lost his starting place to Alex Newbigging) was loaned to Celtic whilst Adams recovered from injury, and this is the first known transfer between the two Old Firm clubs. Sinclair played six league games and three Glasgow Cup ties for Celtic, keeping clean sheets in every match bar his final game, where Celtic won 3\u20132 in the Glasgow Cup final.'Parkhead erupted as it had never done so before,' David Potter's 7 Magnificently Random Celtic Stories, The Celtic Star, 23 October 2019 He joined Newcastle United in 1907. Again, he was used mainly as a reserve and made only eight first-team appearances in five years on Tyneside. In these games he kept three clean sheets, conceded three goals and lost only one match. During Sinclair's spell at Newcastle the club won the English First Division twice and the FA Cup once (as well as two other finals), but he was unable to displace fellow Glaswegian Jimmy Lawrence (the Magpies all-time record appearance record holder) for long enough to claim any medals. == Personal life == Sinclair served in the British Army during the First World War. ==Honours== * Scottish League **Runner-up: 1904\u201305 (Rangers) * Scottish Cup **Runner-up: 1904\u201305 (Rangers) *Glasgow Cup **Winner: 1906\u201307 (Celtic) * Scottish Junior Cup **Winner: 1901\u201302 (Rutherglen Glencairn) ==See also== *Played for Celtic and Rangers == References == *Celtic: A complete record 1888\u20131992 by Paul Lunney () ==External links== * Toon 1892: Player Profile \u2013 Tom Sinclair Category:19th-century births Category:20th-century deaths Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Rutherglen Glencairn F.C. players Category:Rangers F.C. players Category:Celtic F.C. players Category:Newcastle United F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:English Football League players Category:Scottish footballers Category:20th-century Scottish people Category:Footballers from Glasgow Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Place of death missing Category:British Army personnel of World War I ",
