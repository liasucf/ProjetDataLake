Aforementioned is a BSL3 laboratory managed by the University of Karachi for the Ministry of Health. Karachi University's International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences established the National Institute of Virology at September 19, 2019. The NIV assumed greater importance during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Pakistan, a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It developed its own COVID-19 testing kits, which can be produced at drastically lower costs than imported kits, allowing a greater number of citizens to get tested. When the outbreak took place in Pakistan, the state government of Sindh worked beside Pakistan's federal government's Ministry of Health to develop vaccines and medications for treatment of infectious diseases. ==References== Category:COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan Category:Research institutes in Pakistan Category:Organizations established in 2019 Category:Virology institutes Category:Medical research institutes in Pakistan Category:Organizations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic Category:WHO Collaborating Centres Category:Infectious disease organizations Category:Biological research institutes Category:Microbiology institutes Category:Laboratories in Pakistan ",
