He has also represented Scotland at under-17 and under-21 level. ==Career== ===Club=== ====St Mirren==== Born in Glasgow, Magennis attended Paisley Grammar School.https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/coaching-masterclass- paisley-grammars-prize-2569559 Magennis joined St Mirren's youth academy at the age of five and remained there throughout his youth career until making his debut for the senior team against Hibernian in October 2016, aged 18, in the Scottish Championship. He continued to appear for the club throughout the season, scoring his first goal for the club in a narrow win over Queen of the South. Having impressed manager Jack Ross with his performances, he was offered a new contract with St Mirren in December 2016 which extended his contract with the club until summer 2019. Now established as a first team player in the Saints squad, Magennis signed a new contract committing him to the club until the summer of 2020, and after clinching the 2017\u201318 Scottish Championship title, he further extended his contract with St Mirren to 2021. He was in the side which secured their status in the Scottish Premiership via the relegation playoff in May 2019. Magennis and Saints suffered a major blow in January 2020, when he injured his knee during a 1\u20130 defeat to Rangers, ending his season after having appeared in every match of the campaign until suffering the injury. In September 2020, St Mirren stated they had rejected a \"substantial\" offer for Magennis from Hibernian. A few days later another offer from the same club was accepted. ====Hibernian==== Magennis signed a five-year deal with Hibernian on 5 October 2020. ===International=== Having played for the under-20s at the 2017 Toulon Tournament,https://www.the- gazette.co.uk/sport/15391284.paisley-2021-stadium-to-host-european- under-21-championship-qualifier/ Magennis made his debut for the Scotland under-21 team in a 2\u20131 win against the Netherlands in September 2018. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Scottish Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\"|St Mirren |2016\u201317 | rowspan=\"2\" |Championship |25||3||4||0||0||0||3Appearances in the Scottish Challenge Cup||0||32||3 |- |2017\u201318 |27||2||2||0||0||0||0||0||29||2 |- |2018\u201319 | rowspan=\"3\"|Premiership |14||2||0||0||3||0||2Two appearances in the Scottish Premiership play- offs||0||19||2 |- |2019\u201320 |22||1||1||0||4||0||0||0||27||1 |- |2020\u201321 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=3|Total !88!!8!!7!!0!!7!!0!!5!!0!!107!!8 |- |Hibernian |2020\u201321 |Scottish Premiership |1||0||0||0||3||0||0||0||4||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !89!!8!!7!!0!!10!!0!!5!!0!!111!!8 |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:Scottish footballers Category:People educated at Paisley Grammar School Category:Footballers from Glasgow Category:Association football midfielders Category:St Mirren F.C. players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:Scotland youth international footballers Category:Scotland under-21 international footballers Category:Hibernian F.C. players ",
