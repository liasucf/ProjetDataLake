At the 2008 Brit Awards it was nominated for Best British Single.\"The BRITs 2008\" Brits.co.uk. Retrieved 6 November 2012 It is Lewis's biggest hit in the US to date, is still her only single to reach the top-ten of the Billboard Hot 100 and remains her signature song. ==Background== \"Bleeding Love\" was initially written for Jesse McCartney, but was later refused by his record label. In 2006, Lewis entered the third series of the British reality singing competition, The X Factor, and after performing and competing against other aspiring hopefuls, the British public voted her the winner on 16 December 2006, receiving 60% of the final vote. As the winner, Lewis received the prize of a \u00a31 million recording contract with Sony BMG, of which Simon Cowell is an A&R; executive, and with Cowell's own record label, Syco Music. Meanwhile, in February 2007, OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder and singer and songwriter Jesse McCartney had written the song \"Bleeding Love\" for McCartney's third studio album, Departure. However, his record label, Hollywood Records, did not like the song. Tedder believed it was a \"massive\" song and the record company was \"out of [their] mind\". Despite his own reality TV background, Tedder had previously made the decision not to work with contestants from the singing competition American Idol, but he had not heard of The X Factor, and on being shown a website about Lewis, he thought that \"her voice just sounded unreal\", saying that \"from a writer's perspective, this girl \u2013 with or without a TV show \u2013 has one of the best voices I've ever heard\". On hearing that Cowell was looking for songs for Lewis's debut album, Tedder rearranged \"Bleeding Love\", changed the key and tailored it to suit her voice. They pitched the song to Cowell, who said it was \"the one\". After the success of Lewis's version, the song was re-recorded by McCartney being included as a bonus track on the international version of the album, Departure. == Recording and production == \"Bleeding Love\" was written by Ryan Tedder and Jesse McCartney for Lewis's debut studio album, Spirit (2007). Production of the song was helmed by Tedder. It was recorded at several recording studios, including Mansfield Studios, Los Angeles; The Record Plant, Hollywood, California and Encore Studios, Burbank, CA. \"Bleeding Love\" was recorded at these locations by Tedder and Craig Durrance, and were assisted in the process by Nate Hertweck. Programming and arrangement was carried out by Tedder. The song was mixed by Phil Tan at Soapbox Studios, Atlanta, GA, and he was assisted by Josh Houghkirk. The song's string arrangement was completed by Tedder. == Composition == \"Bleeding Love\" is a pop song with R&B; undertones set in the key of F major. It moves at 104 bpm and is set in time. The album version runs for four minutes and twenty-two seconds and the radio edit runs for four minutes and one second. Lewis' vocal range extends from C4 to B5, but has gone higher into the sixth octave in most live performances. \"Bleeding Love\" is constructed in the common verse\u2013chorus\u2013bridge song pattern. It employs a church organ which is audible throughout the song until the bridge. Synthesized strings are also prominent throughout the song, which intermittently integrates wood block percussion throughout the track. A heavy, distorted marching band-like drum loop backs the song. The song employs a harmonic shift beginning at the bridge. A harmonic shift or harmonic variety generally identifies most song bridges. In \"Bleeding Love\" the turn around from the common I, vi, IV, V (F, Dm, Bb, C) progression used exclusively up to the bridge for both verses and choruses shifts to focus on the relative minor: vi, IV, I/V, V (Dm, Bb, F/C, C).Sheet music for \"Bleeding Love\". Sony BMG Music Entertainment Publishing (2008). McCartney wrote the song about his longtime girlfriend and said: \"I kept thinking about being in love so much that it hurts. I was away from my girlfriend for four months at the time and I really wanted to [quit] and fly home. I was so in love that it was painful. It was like bleeding, it cut me open.\" The song refers to someone in a relationship who is extremely blinded by love. Regardless of the numerous warnings from her friends and the fact that she is emotionally hurt by her lover, she continues to love him and accepts the pain. Metaphorically, this is represented in his \"cutting her open\". However, all she can do is \"bleed love\" for him. == Promotion == Lewis performing \"Bleeding Love\" on the Labyrinth Tour in 2010. The song's first radio play was on the BBC Radio 1 Chart Show on 16 September 2007, and was quickly followed by an online exclusive streaming by celebrity blogger Perez Hilton. It was reported that over 1.5 million people listened to the song online. The song was also Scott Mills's record of the week from Monday 24 September to Friday 28 September. Lewis went on a two- day regional UK radio tour to promote the single and album on 11 and 12 October 2007. This was followed by an appearance on This Morning on 15 October. Lewis performed the song live on the fourth series of The X Factor on 20 October 2007, and also made appearances on several other TV and radio shows such as T4, GMTV and Loose Women. Lewis also performed the song at the Festival della canzone italiana on 29 February 2008, and on German entertainment show Wetten, dass..? on 1 March 2008. Lewis made her US television debut on The Oprah Winfrey Show, on 17 March 2008, where she sang \"Bleeding Love\". She has also performed on Good Morning America on 4 April 2008, Live With Regis and Kelly on 8 April 2008, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Ellen DeGeneres Show on 11 April 2008, and The Tyra Banks Show on 17 April 2008. Lewis performed the song live on the seventh season of American Idol on Wednesday 23 April 2008. == Critical reception == Critics noted similarities between Lewis's vocals and those of Mariah Carey \"Bleeding Love\" received critical acclaim from music critics. Showbiz Spy described the song as \"emotionally fuelled\", and opined, \"this track perfectly showcases Leona's impressive vocal prowess and from the moment she opens her mouth we are instantly reminded about her amazing voice, capable of heart stopping intensity and a playful light touch\". Digital Spy's review of the song gave it four stars out of five, saying it is \"easily the best single to be released by an X Factor star\", and describing it as \"a brilliantly smart pop record, managing to offer the lovelorn balladry that Lewis's X Factor fans are no doubt craving, while also suggesting a hint of street cred in the form of some beefy, vaguely modish beats\". It came second in Digital Spy's Top 20 Singles of 2007 announced on 31 December. However, BBC America's reviewer expressed that \"the inventive percussion can't stop 'Bleeding Love' from sounding dated, like filler on some long-lost, late '90s Mariah Carey album. It's one of those mid-tempo numbers \u2013 too slow for the club, too fast for the foxtrot. Actually, with its marching band drum beat, it sounds as much like Gwen Stefani's 'Hollaback Girl' as a ballad can.\" The critic continues to say, \"On to the positive: Lewis wisely restrains her vocals, never devolving into those vocal acrobatics that have historically plagued Christina Aguilera.\" Billboard's review by Singles Review Editor Chuck Taylor for \"Bleeding Love\", the first ahead of the song's release in the United States, stated it was \"a colossal and timeless debut\", going on to say \"not only a one-listen harmonic show- stopper, it is also hip, soulful, beat-rippling and an undeniable vocal tour de force\". The Village Voice described the song as a \"perfectly devised emo- pop machine ... the old Mariah is jealous right now\". === Accolades === \"Bleeding Love\" has earned Lewis numerous awards and nominations. In December 2007, \"Bleeding Love\" won The Record of the Year and the award for Best Track in the Virgin Media Music Awards 2007. In January 2008, the song was nominated for the British Single award at the 2008 BRIT Awards.
