    "text": "The Battle of Dhank took place in October 1870, ranging forces in support of the Omani Imam Azzan bin Qais against Turki bin Said. The battle was won by Turki bin Said backed by forces from Dubai, Ajman and Ras Al Khaimah as well as mounted fighters from the Na'im and Bani Qitab tribes. Azzan bin Qais was the Imam of Oman between 1868 and 1870, having deposed Sayyid Salim bin Thuwaini. Azzan opposed the Saudi interference in the Buraimi Oasis and took control of Buraimi in 1869. Azzan was supported by Zayed bin Khalifah Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi and also Salim bin Sultan Al Qasimi of Sharjah against Turki bin Said of Muscat, who contested Azzan bin Qais' rule. As a consequence of the battle, Turki bin Said became Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Azzan bin Qais himself was killed in battle at Muttrah in January 1871. == See also == * History of Oman * History of the United Arab Emirates == References == Category:History of Oman Category:History of the United Arab Emirates ",
