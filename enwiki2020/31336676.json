He averaged 17.8 points and 17.0 rebounds per game in 21 games played.

In Harper's final two seasons, he averaged 21.0 points and 19.0 rebounds for his junior year, and 22.3 points and 21.5 rebounds as a senior. This rebounding mark still stands as the best in the history of the Southeastern Conference. Harper became the first Crimson Tide player to lead his team in scoring all four years en route to finishing with 1,861 for his career, while his 1,688 career rebounds place him eighth all-time in the history of NCAA Division I men's basketball.
