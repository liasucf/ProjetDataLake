The National Rendezvous and Living History Foundation (NRLHF) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which holds rendezvous across the United States for the period between 1640 and 1840 AD, or roughly during the heyday of the North American fur trade. Its unofficial motto, according to its website is, \"Formed for the management of the rendezvous program by rendezvous people.\" ==Formation== The NRLHF was formed by the National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association in December 1998 and incorporated in March 1999. Its Articles of Incorporation can be found here: NRLHF Articles of Incorporation. The reason behind the Foundation's formation was to put the management of the National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association's various regional rendezvous in the hands of those who attended the events. ==Political structure== The overarching guidelines that the Foundation adheres to are outlined in their Constitution and By-Laws. The By-Laws can be found here: NRLHF By Laws. The NRLHF is a democratic organization at its core. Each of the regional rendezvous managed by the Foundation elects a number of delegates to represent them on the Council of Delegates. The Council of Delegates contains eleven elected delegates and two appointed representatives from the parent organization: the NMLRA. The NRLHF's Board of Directors is composed of eight individuals: four officers (President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer) and four directors. Each of the officers is a delegate elected from the Council of Delegates. Each of the directors was appointed by the parent organization, the NMLRA. The four officers are elected to their position by the Council of Delegates every year during the annual board meeting at the Eastern Primitive Rendezvous. ==The rendezvous== The Midwestern Primitive Rendezvous, 2004 Currently, the NRLHF manages five-week-long regional primitive rendezvous and one specialized weekend event. All of these events must follow the rules and regulations of the Foundation set forth by the Board of Directors. These rules and regulations can be found here: NRLHF Rules and Regulations.
