    "text": "NrsZ (nitrogen regulated small RNA) is a bacterial small RNA found in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Its transcription is induced during nitrogen limitation by the NtrB/C two-component system (an important regulator of nitrogen assimilation and swarming motility) together with the alternative sigma factor RpoN ( a global regulator involved in nitrogen metabolism). NrsZ by activating rhlA (a gene essential for rhamnolipids synthesis) positively regulates the production of rhamnolipid surfactants needed for swarming motility. == See also == * Pseudomonas sRNA * SrbA sRNA * AsponA antisense RNA == References == Category:Non-coding RNA ",
