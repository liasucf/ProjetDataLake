    "text": "Follow The City Lights is the sixth album from Spanish band Dover. The band took a turn in their career to edit this album with an electronic character. This time the leaders of the group Cristina Llanos and Amparo Llanos, alongside programmer and drummer Jes\u00fas Ant\u00fanez are joined by Samuel Titos, a newly signed bassist for the band. Since March 2006, they had begun talking about a new style. For this album they chose Daniel Alcover with whom they had worked on with Devil Came To Me, and who would win Music Prize for Best Sound Technician working on this album. This album has been probably the most controversial for the band, since the change of style has led to the resignation of many fans of the group. The album reached No. 1 in Spanish sales for several weeks and placing their first single \"Let Me Out\" at the top of the charts. The prize won Best Alternative Album award at the Music Awards 2006. It was followed by the singles \"Do Ya\" and \"Keep On Moving\", the latest highly reminiscent of Madonna. They confessed that they had enough desire to publish an album like this, despite many peoples opinions. The song \"Do Ya\" is featured in the soundtrack of football video game FIFA 08. == Track listing == :Lyrics and music by Amparo Llanos and Cristina Llanos. == Personnel == ;Dover * Cristina Llanos \u2013 Vocals and acoustic guitar * Amparo Llanos \u2013 Guitar * Jes\u00fas Ant\u00fanez \u2013 Drums * Samuel Titos \u2013 Bass guitar ==Accolades== {| class=\"wikitable \" |- !
