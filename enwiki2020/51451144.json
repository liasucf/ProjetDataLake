    "text": "On the early morning of 29 August 2016, multiple individuals rammed a van into the entrance of the building and set its laboratories on fire. The fire caused extensive damage to the laboratories and the rest of the building but there were no injuries in the attack. Witnesses to the arson attack heard multiple explosions and feared there was a bomb used. Brussels police have not confirmed that a bomb was used in the attack. At least five people were arrested after the attack. The Brussels police could not confirm whether the attack was terrorism related or a criminal act. == Background == Brussels has been on high alert since the November 2015 Paris attacks and the 2016 Brussels bombings. The Brussels police conducted major police operations in early 2016 against terrorism suspects. Salah Abdeslam and other suspects were arrested in these raids. Because of the police raids the Belgian crime rate has dropped but the illegal weapon trade, number of armed robberies and terrorism-related incidents in Brussels have significantly increased. == Attack == At around 2:30 a.m., a van rammed into the National Institute of Criminology building and came to a halt at the laboratory of the federal police. Immediately after the car had stopped a fire broke out and affected the building. Some 30 firefighters helped to put out the fire at the National Institute of Criminology. The damage done to the building was described as 'significant' and multiple labs were destroyed. == Investigation == The Brussels police suspect the attack was carried out to destroy evidence related to a crime. ==References== Category:Arson in Belgium Category:Attacks on government buildings and structures Category:Organized crime events in Belgium Category:2016 crimes in Belgium Category:August 2016 crimes Category:August 2016 events in Europe Category:Attacks in 2016 Category:2016 in Brussels Category:2016 fires Category:Fires in Belgium ",
