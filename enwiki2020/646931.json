He is currently the Barbara Kimball Browning Professor in Humanities and Sciences at Stanford University.Taylor's staff page at Stanford. Taylor received the 2014 Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics \"for numerous breakthrough results in the theory of automorphic forms, including the Taniyama\u2013Weil conjecture, the local Langlands conjecture for general linear groups, and the Sato\u2013Tate conjecture.\" He also received the 2007 Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences for his work on the Langlands program with Robert Langlands. ==Career== He received his B.A. from Clare College, Cambridge.SAVILIAN PROFESSORSHIP OF GEOMETRY in NOTICES, University Gazette 23.3.95 No. 4359 During his time at Cambridge, he was president of The Archimedeans in 1981 and 1982, following the resignation of his predecessor. He earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1988 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \"On congruences between modular forms\", under the supervision of Andrew Wiles. From 1995 to 1996 he held the Savilian chair of geometry at Oxford University and Fellow of New College, Oxford,'TAYLOR, Prof. Richard Lawrence', Who's Who 2008, A & C Black, 2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007 accessed 27 March 2008 and later became the Herchel Smith Professor of Mathematics at Harvard University, and held the Robert and Luisa Fernholz Professorship at the Institute for Advanced Study. He is currently the Barbara Kimball Browning Professor in Humanities & Sciences at Stanford University. He received the Whitehead Prize in 1990, the Fermat Prize and the Ostrowski Prize in 2001, the Cole Prize of the American Mathematical Society in 2002, and the Shaw Prize for Mathematics in 2007. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1995. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society. Retrieved 25 August 2013. In 2015 he was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences.National Academy of Sciences Member Directory. Retrieved 30 April 2016. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2018. ==Research== One of the two papers containing the published proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is a joint work of Taylor and Andrew Wiles. In subsequent work, Taylor (along with Michael Harris) proved the local Langlands conjectures for GL(n) over a number field. A simpler proof was suggested almost at the same time by Guy Henniart, and ten years later by Peter Scholze. Taylor, together with Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad and Fred Diamond, completed the proof of the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture, by performing quite heavy technical computations in the case of additive reduction. In 2008, Taylor, following the ideas of Michael Harris and building on his joint work with Laurent Clozel, Michael Harris, and Nick Shepherd-Barron, announced a proof of the Sato\u2013Tate conjecture, for elliptic curves with non-integral j-invariant. This partial proof of the Sato\u2013Tate conjecture uses Wiles's theorem about modularity of semistable elliptic curves. ==Personal life== Taylor is the son of British physicist John C. Taylor. He is married, and has two children.Taylor, Richard \"The Shaw Prize\", 2007 ==References== ==External links== *His home page at the Institute for Advanced Study * *Autobiography upon Shaw Prize acceptance Category:1962 births Category:Alumni of Clare College, Cambridge Category:20th-century British mathematicians Category:21st- century British mathematicians Category:Clay Research Award recipients Category:Fellows of New College, Oxford Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Harvard University faculty Category:Institute for Advanced Study faculty Category:Living people Category:Number theorists Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Savilian Professors of Geometry Category:Whitehead Prize winners Category:Fermat's Last Theorem Category:Members of the American Philosophical Society ",
