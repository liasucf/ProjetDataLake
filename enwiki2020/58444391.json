    "text": "Brachyodus was a genus of anthracothere that lived in Europe during the Early Miocene. ==Taxonomy== The type and only species of this genus is B. onoideus. The nominal species \"Brachyodus\" strategus has been reassigned to Paenanthracotherium based on similarities with P. bergeri.Laureline Scherler; Fabrice Lihoreau; Damien Becker (2018). \"To split or not to split Anthracotherium?

Online edition. doi:10.1093/zoolinnean/zly052. Likewise, the putative Asian species \"B.\" japonicus was referred to Elomeryx by Tsubamoto and Kohno (2011).Tsubamoto, T. and N. Kohno (2011).
