Among the Cougar greats Hollingbery coached were Mel Hein, Turk Edwards, and Mel Dressel. The Hollingbery Fieldhouse that serves many of Washington State's athletics teams, was named in his honor in 1963. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1979. Like many other college football programs, the Cougars did not field a team in 1943 or 1944, due to World War II.

His overall record at Washington State was , the lowest winning percentage of any head coach in Washington State football history, and he was fired after the 2011 season. ===Mike Leach era (2012\u20132019)=== Mike Leach in 2012|alt=Washington State football coach Mike Leach during a 2012 season game.
