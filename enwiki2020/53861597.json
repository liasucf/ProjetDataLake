    "text": "New Riverdale is the title used to refer to the relaunch of the core Archie Comics titles that began in July 2015. In December 2014, Archie Comics announced that its flagship series Archie would relaunch with a new first issue in July 2015. The new series would be a modern take on the Archie characters by writer Mark Waid and artist Fiona Staples, featuring serialized storylines. After the first three issues, Annie Wu drew an issue, followed by new regular artist Veronica Fish. The new title received IGN's \"Best New Comic Series of 2015\" award. In 2016 Archie Comics made a special edition of the first issue of the New Riverdale Archie series available as part of Free Comic Book Day. For FCBD 2017, a special edition of the first issue of Betty and Veronica was released. ==Titles== The first title in the company's \"New Riverdale\" universe, Archie was released with a July 2015 cover date and came in at #7 for comic book sales for the month. The next title, Jughead, was released in October. In April 2015, Archie Comics announced Betty and Veronica which debuted in July 2016. Josie and the Pussycats, and Reggie and Me, a five-issue miniseries, followed in September and December 2016.
