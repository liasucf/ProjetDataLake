    "text": "The notion of cylindric algebra, invented by Alfred Tarski, arises naturally in the algebraization of first-order logic with equality. This is comparable to the role Boolean algebras play for propositional logic. Indeed, cylindric algebras are Boolean algebras equipped with additional cylindrification operations that model quantification and equality. They differ from polyadic algebras in that the latter do not model equality. == Definition of a cylindric algebra == A cylindric algebra of dimension \\alpha (where \\alpha is any ordinal number) is an algebraic structure (A,+,\\cdot,-,0,1,c_\\kappa,d_{\\kappa\\lambda})_{\\kappa,\\lambda<\\alpha} such that (A,+,\\cdot,-,0,1) is a Boolean algebra, c_\\kappa a unary operator on A for every \\kappa (called a cylindrification), and d_{\\kappa\\lambda} a distinguished element of A for every \\kappa and \\lambda (called a diagonal), such that the following hold: : (C1) c_\\kappa 0=0 : (C2) x\\leq c_\\kappa x : (C3) c_\\kappa(x\\cdot c_\\kappa y)=c_\\kappa x\\cdot c_\\kappa y : (C4) c_\\kappa c_\\lambda x=c_\\lambda c_\\kappa x : (C5) d_{\\kappa\\kappa}=1 : (C6) If \\kappa otin\\\\{\\lambda,\\mu\\\\}, then d_{\\lambda\\mu}=c_\\kappa(d_{\\lambda\\kappa}\\cdot d_{\\kappa\\mu}) : (C7) If \\kappa eq\\lambda, then c_\\kappa(d_{\\kappa\\lambda}\\cdot x)\\cdot c_\\kappa(d_{\\kappa\\lambda}\\cdot -x)=0 Assuming a presentation of first-order logic without function symbols, the operator c_\\kappa x models existential quantification over variable \\kappa in formula x while the operator d_{\\kappa\\lambda} models the equality of variables \\kappa and \\lambda. Henceforth, reformulated using standard logical notations, the axioms read as : (C1) \\exists \\kappa. \\mathit{false} \\iff \\mathit{false} : (C2) x \\implies \\exists \\kappa. x : (C3) \\exists \\kappa. (x\\wedge \\exists \\kappa. y) \\iff (\\exists\\kappa. x) \\wedge (\\exists\\kappa. y) : (C4) \\exists\\kappa \\exists\\lambda. x \\iff \\exists \\lambda \\exists\\kappa. x : (C5) \\kappa=\\kappa \\iff \\mathit{true} : (C6) If \\kappa is a variable different from both \\lambda and \\mu, then \\lambda=\\mu \\iff \\exists\\kappa. (\\lambda=\\kappa \\wedge \\kappa=\\mu) : (C7) If \\kappa and \\lambda are different variables, then \\exists\\kappa. (\\kappa=\\lambda \\wedge x) \\wedge \\exists\\kappa. (\\kappa=\\lambda\\wedge eg x) \\iff \\mathit{false} == Cylindric set algebras == A cylindric set algebra of dimension \\alpha is an algebraic structure (A, \\cup, \\cap, -, \\empty, X^\\alpha, c_\\kappa,d_{\\kappa\\lambda})_{\\kappa,\\lambda<\\alpha} such that \\langle X^\\alpha, A \\rangle is a field of sets, c_\\kappa S is given by \\\\{y \\in X^\\alpha \\mid \\exists x \\in S\\ \\forall \\beta eq \\kappa\\ y(\\beta) = x(\\beta)\\\\}, and d_{\\kappa\\lambda} is given by \\\\{x \\in X^\\alpha \\mid x(\\kappa) = x(\\lambda)\\\\}.Hirsch and Hodkinson p167, Definition 5.16 It necessarily validates the axioms axioms C1\u2013C7 of a cylindric algebra, with \\cup instead of +, \\cap instead of \\cdot, set complement for complement, empty set as 0, X^\\alpha as the unit, and \\subseteq instead of \\le. The set X is called the base. Not every cylindric algebra has a representation as a cylindric set algebra. It is easier to connect the semantics of first-order predicate logic with cylindric set algebra. (For more details, see the Further reading section.) == Generalizations == Cylindric algebras have been generalized to the case of many-sorted logic (Caleiro and Gon\u00e7alves 2006), which allows for a better modeling of the duality between first-order formulas and terms. == Relation to monadic Boolean algebra == When \\alpha = 1 and \\kappa, \\lambda are restricted to being only 0, then c_\\kappa becomes \\exists, the diagonals can be dropped out, and the following theorem of cylindric algebra (Pinter 1973): : c_\\kappa (x + y) = c_\\kappa x + c_\\kappa y turns into the axiom : \\exists (x + y) = \\exists x + \\exists y of monadic Boolean algebra. The axiom (C4) drops out. Thus monadic Boolean algebra can be seen as a restriction of cylindric algebra to the one variable case. ==See also== *Abstract algebraic logic *Lambda calculus and Combinatory logic\u2014other approaches to modelling quantification and eliminating variables *Hyperdoctrines are a categorical formulation of cylindric algebras *Relation algebras (RA) *Polyadic algebra ==Notes== ==References== * * Leon Henkin, Monk, J.D., and Alfred Tarski (1971) Cylindric Algebras, Part I.
