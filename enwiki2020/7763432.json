Market Mall is a shopping centre located in the Nutana Suburban Centre neighbourhood on the east side of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Built in the 1960s as Saskatoon's first enclosed shopping centre, it has undergone four major expansions since the late 1970s and now houses approximately 90 stores and services, anchored as of February 2020 by Giant Tiger and Planet Fitness. It also contains an 18-hole indoor miniature golf course, Ticketmaster booth, a branch of Service Canada, and a six-bay City of Saskatoon Transit terminal that was added in 2006. A branch of the Dollarama discount chain opened in 2014, replacing a bingo hall that had operated in the mall for a number of years. Market Mall is located on Preston Avenue on land bounded by Adelaide Street to the North, Louise Street to the South; Preston Ave South to the West, and McEown Avenue to the East. Former anchor tenants have included Zellers, Kmart, Canadian Tire, Stedmans and a department store that at varying times used the brandings Macleods and Gambles before it was finally closed in the early 1990s. In September 2011 it was reported that Target Canada, as part of its takeover of the Zellers chain, had purchased the leasehold for the Market Mall location with the possibility of it being converted to a Target store in the future.Three Target stores proposed for Saskatoon, Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, Sept. 23, 2011, retrieved Jan. 6, 2012 Prior to this, in June 2011, mall management announced that the Zellers location would close in 2012 to facilitate plans to build an 18,000-sq.-ft. expansion to the mall and add a residential component.\"Zellers leaving Market Mall\", SaskatoonHomePage.ca, Paul Burke, June 3, 2011; retrieved Jan. 6, 2012 Ultimately, the Zellers location did close in the spring of 2012, and the department-store sized bay did not become a Target, remaining vacant and used for a succession of seasonal and short-term retailers.

The new owners announced that the plans to add 440 condominium units had been cancelled, and that the bay formerly occupied by Zellers would be taken over by two new anchor tenants, Giant Tiger and Planet Fitness.
