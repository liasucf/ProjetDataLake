It was created following the division of Korea, being split off from Musan county in the 1952 reorganization of local government. ==Geography== The land of Y\u014fnsa is high and mountainous, with even the low-lying areas more than 500 meters above sea level. The county is traversed by the Hamgy\u014fng Mountains and the Paengmu Plateau. Various streams flow through the county, including the Y\u014fnmy\u014fnsu (Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl: \uc5f0\uba74\uc218, Hancha: \u5ef6\u9762\u6c34), Kuunsu (Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl: \uad6c\uc6b4\uc218, Hancha: \u4e5d\u96f2\u6c34), Sudongsu (Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl: \uc218\ub3d9\uc218), and S\u014fdusu (Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl: \uc11c\ub450\uc218, Hancha: \u897f\u982d\u6c34). 84% of the county is forested. The highest point is Kwanmobong (Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl: \uad00\ubaa8\ubd09, Hancha: \u51a0\u5e3d\u5cf0). ==Administrative divisions== Y\u014fnsa County is divided into 1 \u016dp (town), 1 rodongjagu (workers' districts) and 10 ri (villages): {| |- | valign=\"top\" | * Y\u014fnsa-\u016dp * Sinyang-rodongjagu * Kwangyang-ri * Namchang-ri * P'also-ri * Rop'y\u014fng-ri * Samha-ri * Samp'o-ri * Sinbung-ri * Sinchang-ri * S\u014fksu-ri * Y\u014fnsu-ri |} ==Economy== Lumbering dominates the economy of Y\u014fnsa, and there are numerous lumbermills. Wild roots and fruits are also gathered from the mountains. There is very little agriculture, due to the lack of arable land; the farming that is carried out is chiefly dry-field farming. Y\u014fnsa is responsible for more than half of North Hamgy\u014fng's potato crop. Cultivated land makes up 4.3% of the county's area. ==Transportation== Y\u014fnsa lies on the Paengmu Line of the Korean State Railway, and is also served by roads. ==See also== *Geography of North Korea *Administrative divisions of North Korea ==External links== * Category:Counties of North Hamgyong ",
