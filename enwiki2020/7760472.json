    "text": "a 1998 scrolling shooter arcade game by Seibu Kaihatsu. It is a sequel to Raiden Fighters 2, released one year earlier. Raiden Fighters Jet retains the same game mechanics as its predecessors, while introducing new ones in a departure from the previous games. ==Gameplay== The Hybrid Attack from Raiden Fighters 2 returns in this game. This special attack has been given a graphical facelift, but otherwise remains the same functionally. A mechanic introduced in this game gauges stage progression on player performance. If the player performs well in a stage, the next stage will have a higher level number, allowing the player to reach the real levels (Phase 1 and Phase 2) earlier. Players not performing well will be sent to a lower level number, or the game session ends early. Additional game modes include playing through all boss encounters only, and a mode in which enemies return fire after being destroyed. ===Fighter craft=== Most of the fighter craft from Raiden Fighters 2 appear in this game. Players can choose the color of their selected craft. This game introduces the Ixion, an aircraft with a forward-swept wing configuration, similar to the Grumman X-29 and the Sukhoi Su-47. Players can either select the Ixion directly at the beginning of the game, or their selected fighter (that is not a secret fighter like the Raiden II and Viper Phase 1 ships) is upgraded to the Ixion upon reaching Phase 1, equipping it with the original fighter's secondary weapons while using the Ixion's primary weapon and movement speed. ===Plot=== Raiden Fighters Jet's stage branching mechanic is explained in the game as being part of a training simulation that gauges the player's performance in the simulation. Players who perform well in the simulation will get a chance to pilot a new experimental fighter in a real mission. Depending on the player's performance in the real mission, they will be either given the chance to fight a bomber carrying a nuclear cruise missile or be forced to withdraw before engaging it. ==Music== Raiden Fighters Jet's soundtrack was composed by Yasuhiro Hashimoto and consists of rave and techno music in a departure from the more melodic pop orientated style of the original Raiden game series. ==Ports and conversions== On November 21, 2007, Japanese video game magazine Famitsu reported the development of a compilation of all three Raiden Fighters games for the Xbox 360.Famitsu Weekly; November 21, 2007; magazine scan (http://www.gamersyde.com/gallery_7060_en.html) This compilation is titled Raiden Fighters Aces, published by Japanese software company Success Corporation and released on March 27, 2008. ==Other versions== Raiden Fighters Jet 2000, a clone for the Chinese market, runs on cheaper hardware and features notoriously inferior sound than the original. A newer single-board version was released for the US market. This version of Raiden Fighters Jet is a standalone version that has all fighters available from the start. == Reception == In Japan, Game Machine listed Raiden Fighters Jet on their October 1, 1998 issue as being the sixth most-successful arcade game of the year. ==References== Category:1998 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Vertically scrolling shooters Category:Fabtek games Category:Seibu Kaihatsu games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Windows games ",
