    "text": "Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome is a rare condition characterised by facial and skeletal abnormalities along with the development of hepatoma in the teenage years. ==Signs and symptoms== The main features of this condition are evident in skeleton and faceLessel D, Vaz, B, Halder S, Lockhart PJ, Marinovic-Terzic I, Lopez-Mosqueda J, Philipp M, Sim JCH, Smith KR, Oehler J, Cabrera, E, Freire R, et al (2014) Mutations in SPRTN cause early onset hepatocellular carcinoma, genomic instability and progeroid features. Nature Genet. 46: 1239-1244 Facial features: * Triangular face * Small frontotemporal diameter * Small deep set eyes * Bulbous nose with high nasal bridge * Small upper lip * Micrognathia Skeletal features: * Thoracic kyphoscoliosis * Sloping shoulders * Pectus excavatum * Elbow contractures * Clinodactyly * Pes planus * Delayed bone age Other associated conditions: * Lipodystrophy * Simian creases All three patients developed liver cancer (hepatoma) in the teens. ==Genetics== This condition has been associated with mutations in the Spartan gene (SPRTN). This gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q42.2). The gene SPRTN encodes the DNA dependent metalloprotease Spartan. Spartan is intimately involved in the repair of protein-linked DNA breaks.Abugable AA, Morris JLM, Palminha NM, Zaksauskaite R, Ray S, El-Khamisy SF. DNA repair and neurological disease: From molecular understanding to the development of diagnostics and model organisms. DNA Repair (Amst). 2019 Sep;81:102669. . Epub 2019 Jul 8. Review. ==Pathopysiology== This is not understood. ==Diagnosis== This syndrome may be suspected on clinical grounds. The diagnosis is established by sequencing the SPRTN gene ===Differential diagnosis=== *Werner syndrome ==Treatment== There is no specific treatment for this condition. Management is supportive. ==Epidemiology== This condition is considered to be rare with only 3 cases reported in the literature. ==History== This condition was first described in 2003.Ruijs MWG, van Andel RNJ, Oshima J, Madan K, Nieuwint AWM, Aalfs CM (2003) Atypical progeroid syndrome: an unknown helicase gene defect?
