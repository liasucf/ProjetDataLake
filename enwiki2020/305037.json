    "text": "Los Realejos is a town and a municipality in the northern part of the island of Tenerife, which is the biggest of the Canary Islands. It is part of the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain. The town is located 2 km from the north coast, 5 km southwest of Puerto de la Cruz, 6 km west of La Orotava, and 34 km southwest of the island's capital Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The inhabitants are known in Spanish as realejeros. The population consists of 37,970 (2013Instituto Canario de Estad\u00edstica ), its density being 670/km\u00b2 and the area is 57.08 km\u00b2. The highest peak is 420 m. Los Realejos is the western terminus of the TF-5 motorway. The town is split into two distinct areas or districts: *Realejo Alto (Upper Realejo) *Realejo Bajo (Lower Realejo) These areas are distinct from each other in terms of their geography (both are split by a large deep ravine) and their history (during the Spanish conquest of the island the indigenous people Guanches had a settlement in the lower area of the town, whereas the Spaniards occupied the upper area). Furthermore, each area has its own Baroque church, both of which were built shortly after the completion of the Spanish conquest. The municipality was originally founded and known as Realejo de Arriba. The town governed by its local council also includes other smaller villages such as Palo Blanco, Cruz Santa, Mocan, Icod de Alto, Tigaiga among others. An increase in population and housing over the years has merged all of them together into what appears to be one big town nowadays. Los Realejos also has a few beaches of note, Playa de El Socorro being the most popular one, not only with the locals but also with tourists. Other beaches like Playa de Castro and Playa de Fajana are worthy of mention, albeit they are slightly less accessible than El Socorro. Los Realejos is the home of the English language newspaper the Tenerife News. Los Realejos boasts the Shrine of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which is the main Marian shrine in northern Tenerife.
