    "text": "Centennial Grounds or Centennial Park was a baseball ground in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was home to the short-lived Philadelphia Centennials baseball club of the National Association during the 1875 season, so it is considered a major league ballpark by those who count the NA as a major league. It was also the site of one home game by the Athletics. It occupied the same block as the later Recreation Park. ==References== * Retrosheet. \"Park Directory\".
