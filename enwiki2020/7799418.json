He was the author of the first book of English common law, called Liber Albus (the White Book). He was a member of the English Parliament from London in 1425. He is also recognized as the founder of the City of London School for boys. He resided in the Parish of St. Peter, Cornhill, London, and was buried in the Abbey of St. Peter, Westminster, where his wife Katherine was later interred.Carpenter, Amos B. (1898) A Genealogical History of the Rehoboth Branch of the Carpenter Family in America. Also known as the Carpenter Memorial, published 1898 by the Press of Carpenter & Morehouse, Amherst, MA, pp. 3-27. This book contains the will of John Carpenter and his wife Katherine along with sections of Thomas Brewer's 1856 work on John Carpenter. He is frequently distinguished in historical documents as \"John Carpenter, the younger\", \"John Carpenter, Junior\" (incorrectly), and as \"John Carpenter, Jenkin\". \"Jenkin\" or \"Jenken\" is a diminutive of the name John.This family had French Flemish ancestry in its names. Translations of Jean/Jehan/Jehannes became John in English. Jean or Jehan, the diminutive form, became John the younger, while some Jehans and all Jehannes became John the elder or rarely John the older. For more details see Jenkin. John Carpenter was one of three men by that name who were prominent during the 15th century. Both others are mentioned in his will of 1442. One was his brother, John Carpenter the elder, who received much property from his younger brother.Douglas-Smith, A. E. (1965) The City of London School. Oxford, England; 2nd Edition. John Carpenter may have been related in some way to the other John Carpenter who was the Warden of St. Anthony's Hospital, Rector of St. Mary Magdalen's, and finally Bishop of Worcester. Bishop John Carpenter was willed, by the subject of this article, \"that book on architecture which Master William Cleve gave me\". Cleve was King's Chaplain and clerk of the works, and carried out building at the Palace of Westminster and the Tower. ==Early life and ancestry== Thomas Brewer in his 1856 book on John Carpenter found no significant record of his life until his election as the Town Clerk or Common Clerk of the City of London on 20 April 1417, at about age 45. The exemption mentioned on page 14 suggests that John Carpenter had been in the City of London's service \"from the time of his youth\". It is assumed that he was apprenticed to John Marchaunt, his predecessor as Town Clerk.Brewer, Thomas (1856). Memoir of the Life and Times of John Carpenter, Town Clerk of London in the reigns of Henry Fifth and Sixth. London Based on Liber Albus (see below) and other works, he was familiar with the law. Genealogical efforts have revealed a baptismal date of 18 December 1378 at Hereford Cathedral, but he was probably born earlier, with about 1372 being generally accepted. His father is listed as Richard Carpenter and his mother as Christina.Carpenters' Encyclopedia of Carpenters. 2009 DVD, which contains Carpenter Family genealogy by John R. Carpenter of La Mesa, California. John the younger, the subject of the article, is listed as RIN 0089. His father, Richard or Renaud Carpenter, is believed to have been born about 1335\u20131337 in or of Grand Pont, Cambrai, France. He may have been alive as late as 1412 in London. He married Christina, last name unknown, who was of London. Their known children were: * John Carpenter, the elder, born circa 1362, the father of Bishop John Carpenter. His baptismal date of 20 September 1371 in Battlesden has not been confirmed and is probably wrong. His death date is unknown. * Robert Carpenter, born circa 1368, of London. His brother's will indicates that he had a son named Richard and two daughters named Joan and Katherine. * John Carpenter, the younger \u2013 the subject of this article. His grandfather John or Jean Le Carpenter or Carpentier was born about 1303 of Le Grand Pont and died after 1345 in Dilwyn, Herefordshire. He married Jeanne Tabarie, who was born circa 1310 near Cambrai. His parents are disputed. ==Marriage== The date of John Carpenter's marriage has not been found, nor has the maiden name of his wife, Katherine. Katherine was born in or of Zeeland (now a province of the Netherlands) about 1372. Her will was written 31 March 1457 and proved in June 1458. She was later buried with her husband in the Abbey of St. Peter, Westminster. They had no children.Carpenter, Amos B. (1898).

London. ==Coat of arms== Illustration of a medieval knight bearing a Carpenter coat of arms. John Carpenter's arms appear to be of French or Norman heritage, \"Paly of six, argent and gules, on a chevron azure, 3 cross crosslets or.\" This coat is often referred to as the Hereford Arms, named for the later ancestral home of the Carpenter family in Hereford. The crest, supporters and motto apparently changed several times over the centuries. A more recent motto is Per acuta belli.J. Hatton Carpenter (April 1925). \"The Carpenter Family of England and the United States\". Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine vol. 16, Number 2, pp. 60\u201370. The Hereford Arms were granted in 1719 to George, Lord Carpenter (1657\u20131732). He was a Lt. General and commander-in-chief of all the Crown's forces in Scotland when he was elevated to the peerage of Ireland, by patent dated 29 May 1719, as Baron Carpenter, of Killaghy, county Kilkenny.\"The Life of Lord George Carpenter\", published 1736 in London.Historical Manuscripts Commission, UK National Register of Archives, George Carpenter (1657\u20131732) 1st Baron Carpenter Lieutenant General, HMC.gov.uk There is no direct male to male Carpenter descent connecting Lord Carpenter and Sir William Boyd Carpenter. The family connection is by marriage through the females in the family. William Boyd Carpenter (1841\u20131918), Bishop of Ripon in the Church of England, afterwards a Canon of Westminster and Chaplain to the reigning sovereign of England, wrote in a letter dated 7 August 1907 that his family bore the Hereford Arms. Sir Noel Paton, upon painting the family arms, informed him that the supporters were originally a round-handled sword, which in drawing over time became shortened, until nothing but the cross and globe were left beneath it. Those Hereford Arms were used by \"John Carpenter, town clerk of London, who died 1442 A.D.\" His grandson John Boyd-Carpenter, Baron Boyd- Carpenter (1908\u20131998) continued the arms into the new century by passing them down to his son, Thomas Boyd-Carpenter, who was himself knighted after a military career as a Lieutenant-General and in public service. The Hereford Coat of Arms described above should not be confused with the Arms of Bishop Richard Carpenter (c. 1450s? \u2013 1503) presented in the \"Visitations of the County of Oxford\" taken in 1566, 1574, and 1634, published in 1871, which describe the arms displayed in the buildings at the University in Oxford \u2013 \"In the Lyberarye of Baliall College\" \u2013 as recorded by the officials performing the visitations in those years. The Visitations describe the arms of Richard Carpenter (theologian) as: \"Paly of nine Gu. and Az. on a chevron Arg. surmounted by a mitre Or, three cross crosslets or \u2013 nine pales alternating red and blue, with a silver chevron bearing three gold cross- crosslets.\"Visitations of the County of Oxford taken in 1566, 1574, and 1634, published in 1871. ==Liber Albus== John Carpenter was the author of first book of English Common Law, called Liber Albus (\"White Book\"), completed in 1419.
