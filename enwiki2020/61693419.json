Russell was also an alternative cancer treatment advocate who promoted the idea that cancer is caused by excessive consumption of meat, alcohol, coffee and tea. ==Biography== Russell was born at Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park.\"Russell, (Francis Albert) Rollo (1849\u20131914)\".

The Nature journal positively reviewed Russell's Epidemics, Plagues and Fevers as a valuable service to public health for collecting important facts concerning preventable diseases.Anonymous. (1892). Epidemics, Plagues and Fevers: their Causes and Prevention. Nature 46: 413\u2013414. Bertrand Russell in his autobiography noted that Rollo Russell stimulated his scientific interests.Russell, Bertrand. (1998). The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell. Routledge. p. 19 He wrote that Rollo Russell \"suffered all his life from a morbid shyness so intense as to prevent him from achieving anything that involved contact with other human beings. But with me, so long as I was a child, he was not shy, and he used to display a vein of droll humour of which adults would not have suspected in him.\" Russell died at Holland Street, Kensington from septicaemia.The Hon. F. A. Rollo Russell. Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer. (April 1, 1914). p. 10 He is buried in the churchyard at Steep, Hampshire.Geograph ==Meteorology== Russell contributed to the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society and Symon's Meteorological Magazine. He authored an influential pamphlet London Fogs, in 1880. He documented the effects of fog on health, such as lung diseases and listed the damage caused to buildings and monuments. Russell became a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1868. He served on the council from 1879\u20131892 and in 1914, and was Vice-President 1893\u20131894.Anonymous. (1914). Notes. Nature 93: 140. He co-authored an important meteorological paper on the global effects of the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. His paper, On the Unusual Optical Phenomena of the Atmosphere, 1883\u20131886 co-authored with E. Douglas Archibald was published in the volume The Eruption of Krakatoa and Subsequent Phenomena by the Krakatoa Committee of the Royal Society. ==Cancer research== Russell argued from medical literature and statistical data that cancer is prevalent in communities where meat, alcohol, coffee and tea are excessively consumed.Anonymous. (1907). The Reduction of Cancer. The Lancet 2: 1397.Notes On Books. (1916). The British Medical Journal 2 (2913): 588\u2013589.H. F. (1917). Notes on the Causation of Cancer. The American Journal of the Medical Sciences 153: 909.Anonymous. (1913). Preventable Cancer. Journal of the American Medical Association 60 (6): 470. He recommended that governments should educate the public in restricting the consumption of these products as they increase the occurrence of cancer. In his book Notes on the Causation of Cancer, Russell commented that \"I have found of twenty-five nations eating flesh largely, nineteen had a high cancer rate and only one had a low rate, and that of thirty-five nations eating little or no flesh, none had a high rate.\"Howley, John. (2002). Vegetarian Restaurants and Natural Food Stores in the U. S.: A Comprehensive Guide to Over 2,500 Vegetarian Eateries. Torchlight Publishing. p. 5. Rusell examined cancer incidence and mortality in Benedictine and Cistercian monasteries. The monks abstained from meat or it only consisted of a small part of their diet. Russell found that the monks had a lower rate of cancer mortality compared to the general population and this confirmed the health benefits of a vegetarian diet. His statistical data was criticized by Sydney Copeman and Major Greenwood for lacking precision. In 1926, Copeman and Greenwood commented that: Russell's Notes on the Causation of Cancer received a mixed reception from the medical community. A review in the Medical Record disagreed with Russell that excessive alcohol or meat consumption causes cancer and concluded that the book \"cannot be recommended as authoritative either to the lay public or to the medical profession.\"Anonymous. (1917). Notes on the Causation of Cancer. Medical Record 91: 1059. However, a review in the New York Medical Journal found his arguments valid and suggested that the book \"demand[ed] the attention of the medical profession.\"Anonymous. (1917). Notes on the Causation of Cancer. New York Medical Journal 105: 431. A positive review in The New England Journal of Medicine stated that \"though doubtless not conclusive, such a work is of value as a contribution to the study and ultimate solution of the great problem.\"Anonymous. (1918). Notes on the Causation of Cancer. The New England Journal of Medicine 178: 905. His book Preventable Cancer was positively reviewed in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which concluded that \"many interesting facts, figures and opinions on cancer are collected and set forth in this book.\" Conversely, the New York Medical Journal attacked his statements as inaccurate and dismissed the book because Russell was not qualified in medicine.Anonymous. (1912). Preventable Cancer. New York Medical Journal 96: 665. A review in the Nature journal criticized the book, noting that \"Mr. Russell has made the mistake of comparing statistics which are no way comparable.\"C. E. W. (1912). (1) The Cause of Cancer (2) Preventable Cancer (3) Further Researches into Induced Cell-Reproduction and Cancer (4) The Local Incidence of Cancer. Nature 89: 601\u2013602. However, statistician Frederick Ludwig Hoffman positively reviewed the book, commenting that it contained \"some exceptionally valuable observations on the relation of diet to cancer frequency, the temperature of food, the increase of excessive alimentation, and a rough outline of certain supposed factors accountable for cancer occurrence.\"Hoffman, Frederick L.
