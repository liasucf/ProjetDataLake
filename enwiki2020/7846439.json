In February 2007, the Peoples Energy Corporation merged with Green Bay, Wisconsin-based Wisconsin Public Service Corporation to form the Integrys Energy Group. ==History== Established in 1849, in Chicago, Illinois, Peoples Gas today is the natural gas delivery supplier to approximately 830,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in Chicago area. Peoples Gas currently has approximately 1,500 employees. Services provided to customers and maintenance of approximately 4,300 miles of natural gas main is the primary function of 850 field and support employees, represented by the Gas Workers Union, Local 18007. Established in 1900, North Shore Gas today is the natural gas delivery supplier to approximately 158,000 residential, commercial, and industrial customers in 54 communities in the northeastern- suburban area of Chicago. In 1931, Chicago was connected with Texas via the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, a 980-mile natural gas pipeline, co- owned by Peoples. In February 2008, the Illinois Commerce Commission granted a controversial Peoples Gas/North Shore Gas request for a customer delivery rate increase. The approval, settled at $71 million, was expected to increase the average monthly customer gas bill by $7, or 4% to 5%. Peoples Gas/North Shore Gas, citing in part it had not filed for an increase in 12 years, initially sought a $102.5 million delivery rate increase in this proceeding. Other Integrys subsidiaries include Peoples Energy Resources Company, LLC, Peoples Energy Services Corporation, Peoples Energy Production Company and Peoples District Energy Corporation, providing services in the oil and gas production, natural gas power generation, midstream services, and retail energy services industries. Integrys also owns and operates regulated and non-regulated energy businesses in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. ==Notes== == External links == * Peoples Gas * North Shore Gas Category:1849 establishments in Illinois Category:Companies based in Chicago Category:American companies established in 1967 Category:Companies disestablished in 2007 Category:Former components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Category:Natural gas companies of the United States ",
