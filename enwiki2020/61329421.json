Originally launched by Forever Group alone, Canal+ Group joined in the business in 2017, and the service adopted the current name on January 29, 2018. Canal+ delivers the service through the digital terrestrial television (DTT) signals (available in Yangon and Mandalay) and direct-to-home (DTH) satellite television signals (beamed through Thaicom 6). It launched a Burmese version of My Canal OTT television service in 2019.
