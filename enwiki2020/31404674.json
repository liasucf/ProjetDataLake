The memorial was officially opened on June 7, 1985. The designer was Simon Winograd, and VAZ undertook the construction. Later additions were made to the memorial in 1987\u20131988: bas-reliefs were installed, and in the center a star with an eternal flame was installed. On March 9, 1995, a capsule of earth brought from Poklonnaya Hill in Moscow (the site of Moscow's Victory Park) was placed in one of the monument's wreaths (the one on the side facing Jubilee Street). In April 2007, hooligans stole part of the framing of the eternal flame, but the vandals were soon arrested and the items recovered. ==Architecture== Victims of Fascism The monument consists of four stelae formed in a ring. The four stelae represent the four years of the war (1941\u20131942, 1942\u20131943, 1943\u20131944, and 1944\u20131945) and each has one of the designated years carved into its top. On the outer face of the foot of each stela are ledges with stylized wreaths cast from aluminum. On the inner faces of each stela is a bas\u2013relief: two (\"Partisans\" and \"Victims of Fascism\") were sculpted by Alexander Shemyakin, and two (\"Home Front\" and \"Battle Front\") by Sandor Zicherman. The ring connecting the stelae is faced with stainless steel. On its inner side is an inscription of aluminum letters: \"Eternal Honor to the People's Heroism\". In the center of the monument is a star with the eternal flame, framed by five bronze sections. ==Sources== The Home Front *R.
