    "text": "Pressure Drop is the second solo album by Robert Palmer, released in 1975. Palmer is backed by Little Feat and other musicians. The title track is a cover version of the reggae hit by Toots & the Maytals. However, many other songs on the album use \"New Orleans funk ... along with smooth, dated disco ballads smothered in strings\". Continuing his association with Little Feat started by his cover of \"Sailing Shoes\" on his 1974 debut album Sneaking Sally Through the Alley, Feat was used as backing band on several cuts, most notably Lowell George's slide guitar on \"Here With You Tonight\". George also contributed the tune \"Trouble\" on which Feat pianist Bill Payne plays the intro. David Jeffries' review says that the album is considered \"too blue-eyed and polished for fans of Palmer's more gutsy moments\" but concludes that \"Pressure Drop has grown into the great overlooked album in Palmer's discography\". The album peaked at No. 136 in the US. ==Track listing== All songs by Robert Palmer except where noted. #\"Give Me an Inch\" \u2013 3:17 #\"Work to Make It Work\" \u2013 4:27 #\"Back in My Arms\" \u2013 3:30 #\"River Boat\" (Allen Toussaint) \u2013 3:44 #\"Pressure Drop\" (Frederick Hibbert) \u2013 5:26 #\"Here with You Tonight\" (Robert Palmer, Pete Gage) \u2013 4:57 #\"Trouble\" (Lowell George) \u2013 2:25 #\"Fine Time\" \u2013 5:43 #\"Which of Us Is the Fool\" \u2013 3:25 ==Personnel== * Robert Palmer \u2013 vocals, percussion * Lowell George \u2013 guitar, backing vocals * Bill Payne \u2013 keyboards * Paul Barr\u00e8re \u2013 guitar, backing vocals * Richie Hayward \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals * Kenny Gradney \u2013 bass guitar * James Jamerson \u2013 bass guitar * Sam Clayton \u2013 backing vocals * Ed Greene \u2013 drums, percussion * Jean Roussel \u2013 clavinet, keyboards, Hammond organ B3 * Gordon DeWitty \u2013 clavinet * Gene Page \u2013 strings * The Muscle Shoals Horns \u2013 horns * Mel Collins \u2013 saxophone, flute * Mongezi Feza \u2013 trumpet, flageolet * Ray Allen \u2013 trombone * Vicki Brown \u2013 backing vocals * Fran Tate \u2013 backing vocals * David Snell \u2013 harp * Joe Brown \u2013 banjo * Steve York \u2013 harmonica * Martin Frye \u2013 tuba * Steve Smith \u2013 production * Phill Brown \u2013 engineering * Graham Hughes \u2013 cover concept, design, photography Paul Barr\u00e8re, Lowell George, Kenny Gradney, Richie Hayward, Bill Payne and Sam Clayton were members of Little Feat at the time.
