    "text": "Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Sanrom\u00e1 (November 7, 1902 \u2013 October 12, 1984) was a Puerto Rican pianist who is one of the 20th century's most accomplished and important pianists. In 1932 he gave the first North American performance of Maurice Ravel's Concerto in G under the baton of Serge Koussevitzky, the same day as Sylvan Levin did with the Philadelphia Orchestra. ==Early years== Sanrom\u00e1's father, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda, was born in Barcelona, Spain, and studied at a Jesuit seminary but did not take his final orders to become a priest. After graduation from college, he became a political gadfly writing for a newspaper about the Spanish plebiscite. They recommended he take a hasty retreat to Puerto Rico with all expenses paid by the Spanish government. He settled in the town of Carolina, and later in the town of Fajardo. He sent for his girlfriend, Mar\u00eda Torra de la Riba, but in 1894 women were not allowed to travel unmarried. They were married by proxy before she traveled to be with him. They had two sons, Juan Bautista born in Trujillo Alto in 1899 and Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda born in Carolina in 1902. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda earned a living in Fajardo by publishing a newspaper and teaching. Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda began playing his father's piano. Jos\u00e9, realizing his son was talented, said, \"If you are going to play the piano, then you shall go to school to study.\" He enrolled him at a music school located in the town of Fajardo to take piano lessons. In 1913, at the age of 11, Sanrom\u00e1 made his debut in the Fajardo Municipal Theater.SANROMA, JESUS MARIA (1902 - 1984) == Sanrom\u00e1 debuts== In January 1916, Sanrom\u00e1 debuted at the Puerto Rican Ateneo in San Juan, the island's capital. Unknown to him, Jos\u00e9 de Diego was amongst the public in the audience. So impressed was de Diego with Sanrom\u00e1 that he persuaded the government to give Sanrom\u00e1 a grant of 600 dolares. The grant was to be used to further his musical education in the United States. Sanrom\u00e1 enrolled in the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts and studied piano with David Sequeira. He graduated in 1920 and was awarded the Mason and Hamlin Prize. Shortly after his graduation he earned the position of official pianist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, becoming the first person ever to receive such an honor. He continued studies with Polish pianist Antoinette Szumowska-Adamowska at NEC from 1920 to 1927, and later took additional classes with Alfred Cortot in Paris (June\u2013July 1927) and with Artur Schnabel in Berlin (September\u2013October 1927). ==Boston Symphony Orchestra== Sanrom\u00e1 worked with various composers, such as Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev, but it was the future conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra (a subsection of the Boston Symphony Orchestra), Arthur Fiedler, with whom he was to develop an artistic relationship that was to last for many years. In 1932 he gave the first North American performance of Maurice Ravel's Concerto in G under the baton of Serge Koussevitzky, the same day as Sylvan Levin did with the Philadelphia Orchestra. He was the soloist in the first complete recording of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, with Fiedler and the Boston Pops for RCA Victor in July 1935. They also made the first recording of Edward MacDowell's Second Concerto (1934).Jeremy Nicholas. Booklet notes to Hyperion CDA67165.
