    "text": "Uncensored (1997) was the third Uncensored professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The event took place on March 16, 1997 from the North Charleston Coliseum in North Charleston, South Carolina. The main event was a triangle elimination match between Team nWo (Hollywood Hogan, Randy Savage, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall) (with Dennis Rodman), Team Piper (Roddy Piper, Chris Benoit, Steve McMichael and Jeff Jarrett) and Team WCW (Lex Luger, The Giant and Scott Steiner). Each team had a specific prize upon winning the match. If Team WCW won, all the championships held by the nWo would be stripped and its members would not be allowed to wrestle for three years. If Piper's team had won, he would have gotten a steel cage match against Hogan for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at a time and place of his choosing. If the nWo won, they would earn the right to challenge for any WCW championship at any time they wanted. ==Storylines== The event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Team Piper was originally composed of Roddy Piper, John Tenta, Layton Morrison (a kickboxer), and Craig Mally (a boxer). On the March 10, 1997 episode of WCW Monday Nitro, which aired six days before the pay-per-view, they were replaced by The Four Horsemen members Chris Benoit, Steve McMichael and Jeff Jarrett. Team WCW originally included Rick Steiner, but he was attacked prior to the match by the nWo and was unable to compete, leaving the team at a one-man disadvantage in the match. ==Event== {| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\" |+ Other on-screen personnel !Role: !Name: |- |rowspan=4|Commentators |Tony Schiavone |- |Bobby Heenan |- |Dusty Rhodes |- |Mike Tenay |- |Interviewer |Gene Okerlund |- |rowspan=2|Ring announcers |David Penzer |- |Michael Buffer |- |Referee |Nick Patrick |} Dean Malenko defeated Eddie Guerrero to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. The WCW World Television Championship match between champion Prince Iaukea and Rey Misterio, Jr. originally ended in a 10-minute time limit draw, but the time was extended after a request by Misterio Jr. Minutes later Iaukea pinned Rey Misterio Jr. to retain the championship. The main event was a triangle elimination match between nWo Team, Piper Team and WCW Team, which nWo won. Had WCW Team won, the nWo would have needed to forfeit all their titles and would be barred from wrestling during any WCW event for 36 months. Had Piper Team won, Piper would have faced Hogan in a steal cage match. Had nWo won, they would have a shot at any WCW championship, any time they wanted. During nWo's celebration after the match, Sting rappelled down to the ring. When Scott Hall and Kevin Nash approached him, Sting attacked them with a baseball bat, then Randy Savage when he tried to intervene. After giving all three of them a Scorpion Death Drop, he gestured for Hollywood Hogan to come at him as well. Hogan did, and was promptly taken out by Sting as well. Sting's actions solidified his allegiance to WCW instead of the nWo, and he would become nWo's main adversary. ==Results== ===Triangle match eliminations=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Elimination no. !Wrestler !Team !Eliminated by !Elimination move !Time |- |1 |The Giant |Team WCW |N/A |Over the top rope |04:55 |- |2 |Jeff Jarrett |Team Piper |Kevin Nash |Over the top rope via Clothesline |09:21 |- |3 |Steve McMichael |Team Piper |Scott Hall |Over the top rope via Back Body Drop |09:45 |- |4 |Scott Steiner |Team WCW |Kevin Nash |Over the top rope |10:16 |- |5 |Roddy Piper |Team Piper |Hollywood Hogan |Over the top rope when Dennis Rodman pulled the rope down |10:55 |- |6 |Chris Benoit |Team Piper |Scott Hall and Kevin Nash |Over the top rope |16:27 |- |7 |Randy Savage |nWo |Lex Luger |Torture Rack |18:23 |- |8 |Kevin Nash |nWo |Lex Luger |Over the top rope |18:31 |- |9 |Scott Hall |nWo |Lex Luger |Torture Rack |18:45 |- |10 |Lex Luger |Team WCW |Hollywood Hogan |Pinned after Savage hit Luger in the head with a can of spray paint handed off by Dennis Rodman |19:22 |- !Survivor: |colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#f2f2f2\"|Hulk Hogan (Team nWo) |} ==References== ==External links== *Uncensored 1997 Category:WCW Uncensored Category:1997 in South Carolina Category:Events in South Carolina Category:Professional wrestling in South Carolina Category:March 1997 events in the United States Category:1997 World Championship Wrestling pay-per-view events ",
