    "text": "Mississippi Highway 47 (MS 47) is a state highway located in the U.S. state of Mississippi. The route starts at MS 50 west of West Point in Clay County. The road then travels northwest through small communities in Clay and Chickasaw counties, and it intersects MS 8 in Trebloc, Chickasaw County. MS 47 ends at Aberdeen Road near Buena Vista, and the road continues as MS 385\\. The route was designated around 1934, from MS 10 (now MS 50) near West Point to MS 8 in Buena Vista, and MS 8 was rerouted south through Trebloc by 1944. MS 47 was fully paved by 1958. ==Route description== The route is located in Clay and southeastern Chickasaw counties. The route is legally defined in Mississippi Code \u00a7 65-3-3, and it is maintained by Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) as part of the Mississippi State Highway System. MS 47 starts at the intersection of MS 50 and Mhoon Road, and it begins traveling northwest. The road travels through a rural area of Clay County, and it turns west at Pea Ridge Road. The route enters the unincorporated area of Siloam, and it turns north at Siloam\u2013Griffith Road. At Lake Grove Road and Harper Road, MS 47 turns west and travels through Abbott.

The route meets CRD 166 west of Macedonia, and state maintenance ends at Aberdeen Road near Buena Vista.

By 1934, the road was designated as MS 47, starting at MS 10 and ending at MS 8. MS 8 was rerouted south of Buena Vista to Trebloc by 1944, and the northern terminus of MS 47 remained at Buena Vista. A section of MS 47 near MS 10 was paved by 1953, and another from south of the Clay\u2013Chickasaw county line to MS 8 by 1955. All of the route south of MS 8 was paved by 1957, and a new gravel road was constructed north of MS 47 to MS 32. The gravel road was designated as MS 385 one year later. After being proposed in July 1957, the section from Trebloc to Buena Vista was paved by 1958. MS 10 was renumbered to MS 50 by 1960. ==Major intersections== MS 47 and MS 8 in Trebloc ==References== 047 Category:Transportation in Clay County, Mississippi Category:Transportation in Chickasaw County, Mississippi ",
