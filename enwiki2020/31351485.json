    "text": "More Soul is an album by jazz saxophonist Hank Crawford. Atlantic Records released the album in 1961. More Soul is Crawford's first album as a leader, recorded on October 7, 1960 while he was the music director in Ray Charles' group. Charles provided the arrangement for the track \"The Story.\" == Critical reception == Thom Jurek of allmusic gives the album a three-and-a-half star rating (of a possible five), noting that \"[t]he material is swinging, front- ended, soul-inflected hard bop with tunes arranged by Crawford\" and that \"Crawford's tone as a soloist is sweet yet edgy and raw, full of emotion and warmth.\" The Penguin Guide to Jazz describes the album as \"sonorous and churchy in the Brother Ray mode\u2026\" and gives the album a three-star rating (of a possible four). In 1961, Ralph Gleason, in a review for Down Beat, gave the album five stars. == Track listing == All titles arranged by Hank Crawford, except where indicated. == Personnel == * Hank Crawford \u2013 alto saxophone, piano * David \"Fathead\" Newman \u2013 tenor saxophone * Leroy \"Hog\" Cooper \u2013 baritone saxophone * Phillip Guilbeau \u2013 trumpet * John Hunt \u2013 flugelhorn, trumpet * Edgar Willis \u2013 bass * Milt Turner \u2013 drums == Production == * Nesuhi Ertegun \u2013 producer * Tom Dowd \u2013 engineer * Phil Iehle \u2013 engineer * Gary Kramer \u2013 liner notes * Lee Friedlander \u2013 photography * Loring Eutemey \u2013 cover design == References == * Category:Hank Crawford albums Category:1960 albums Category:Atlantic Records albums Category:Albums produced by Nesuhi Ertegun Category:Soul jazz albums Category:Hard bop albums ",
