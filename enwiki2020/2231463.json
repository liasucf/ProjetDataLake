    "text": "The Least Worst Of is a compilation album from Type O Negative. It contains previously released material alongside a number of unreleased tracks and remixes. The album is available in an edited variant and an unedited one (with a Parental Advisory label/logo). The photograph on the album cover is of the defunct Parachute jump at Coney Island, in Brooklyn, New York. Consistent with many of the band's previous \"joke tracks\", the first track, \"The Misinterpretation of Silence and Its Disastrous Consequences (Wombs and Tombs Mix)\", like the original is completely silent (the only semblance of remixing being that the track is shorter; 39 seconds of silence instead of the original's 1:04). The compilation's title also acts as an example of their self-deprecating sense of humour, with the logic that silence can actually be considered some of their best work. == Track listing == === Unedited version === # \"The Misinterpretation of Silence and Its Disastrous Consequences\" (Wombs and Tombs Mix) \u2013 0:39 #*Previously unreleased \"remix\".
