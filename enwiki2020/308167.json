TAME headquarters are in Quito, Pichincha Province and the main hub was Mariscal Sucre International Airport in Quito. The airline was formed by the Air Force of Ecuador. In 2011, it became a commercial entity and now provides domestic, international and charter flights. On May 20, 2020, the Ecuador government decided to cease all the operations and liquidate the airline. == History == TAME Douglas DC-6B at Miami in 1972 TAME logo, 1962 to 2009 A TAME A319 at Bogot\u00e1 in 2010, with the new design and logoEmbraer 170 Airbus A320 in Mariscal Lamar Airport, Cuenca, Ecuador. TAME Airbus A320 with old livery at Mariscal Sucre Airport, Quito, Ecuador. TAME Embraer 190 The military airline was founded on December 17, 1962, by Luis A. Ortega under Guillermo Freile Posso, both colonels. It was named Transportes A\u00e9reos Militares Ecuatorianos (TAME). At the time, the Air Force required an income source; governmental transport services to remote and difficult to reach parts of Ecuador; and an entity to train pilots. The airline gradually increased in size infrastructure and number of services. On December 4, 1962, Luis A. Ortega, Hector Granja, Eduardo Sandoval, Alfredo Barreiro, Oswaldo Lara, Julio Espinosa, Teodoro Malo and Jose Montesinos made inaugural flights in the Dakota C-47. The pilots held the rank of major and noncommissioned officers worked as flight attendants. The first commercial flight was made by Teodoro Malo on a route from Quito, Esmeraldas, Bah\u00eda, Manta, Guayaquil, Cuenca and back to Quito. Initially, TAME made domestic flights using C-47 planes. Gradually, over the next two years, DC-3 and DC-6 planes were added and then in 1970, two HS-748 Avro were acquired. On April 30, 1966, TAME began regular international flights to Havana, Panama and Santiago de Chile. As its business grew, TAME purchased four Lockheed L-188 Electras from Ecuatoriana de Aviaci\u00f3n. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, TAME added three Boeing 727-100s. During the mid-1980s and up until 1992, Tame purchased four Boeing 727-200s. In 1986, three Fokker F28 Fellowship 4000s were added. In December 1998, TAME rented a Boeing 757-200. In 2000, TAME began a long process of fleet renewal beginning with the renting of two Airbus A320s. These planes were delivered at the European Corporation Assemble factory, Toulouse and were renewed in 2008. Also in 2000, the Boeing 727-100 and 200 were retired. TAME found the Embraer 170/190s suited the airline's needs. Over the next two years, two models of the 170 series and one of the 190 series were obtained. On August 25, 2008, one Airbus A319 was obtained and soon after the two Airbus A320s were replaced, completing the fleet renewal. In 2011, Tame changed its legal status to a state owned company, no longer under the administration of the Ecuador Air Force. On May 20, 2020, Ecuador government decided to liquidate the airline and ceased all operations. The airline, which had been struggling for several years, claimed that its difficulties were compounded by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. == Logo == TAME's colours were blue, light blue, and gold as a decorative element. The original logo, designed by Luis A. Ortega symbolized the flight of a bird with a sun in the background. In 2010, the airline was rebranded with a new logo and colour palette. == Destinations == TAME's hub was in Quito at Mariscal Sucre International Airport. TAME flew internationally to Cali in Colombia and Fort Lauderdale, New York in the United States. The main destinations in Ecuador were Guayaquil, Cuenca, Manta and Esmeraldas. == Agreements == In December 1992, the governments of Ecuador and Colombia signed the \"Frontier Integration Agreement\" establishing a Quito, Esmeraldas (Tachina), Cali, Esmeraldas (Tachina), Quito route. In 1995, TAME offered flights from Quito to Bogota for Air France passengers. In 1997, TAME extended its international schedule through an agreement with EVA Air of Taiwan. On December 1, 2010, a codeshare agreement was made with Copa Airlines.TAME enters the Panamanian market El Universo company website. November 10, 2010. Accessed December 22, 2010.
