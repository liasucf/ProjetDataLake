As prescribed by the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines, he is still eligible to run for the same office. On the other hand, another incumbent Tito Varela is now on his last term as the vice mayor of the city. The incumbent mayor Enrico Echiverri is running again for mayoralty office under the Liberal Party (LP) with his running mate Edgar Erice.

The city is divided into two congressional districts: the first district and the second district. The incumbent first district representative Oscar Malapitan is running under the Nacionalista Party. In 2004, he replaced Echiverri in the post. His opponents were Ernesto Ray Adalem, Gualberto Bacolod, broadcaster Bobby Guanzon, Jaime Regalario and three-term Vice Mayor Luis Tito Varela who is running under the Liberal Party For the second district, the incumbent representative Mary Mitzi Cajayon is running under the Lakas-Kampi-CMD party. She was elected in 2007 replacing Luis Asistio. ==Results== The winners of the congressional, mayor and vice mayor seats of Caloocan City is determined with the highest number of votes received.
