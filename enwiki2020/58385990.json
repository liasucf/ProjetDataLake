He was suffect consul in a nundinium in mid-158 with Quintus Jallius Bassus as his colleague.Werner Eck and Andreas Pangerl, \"Neue Konsulndaten in neuen Diplomen\", Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 152 (2005), p. 257 (Online)Werner Eck, \"Die Fasti consulares der Regungszeit des Antoninus Pius, eine Bestandsaufnahme seit G\u00e9za Alf\u00f6ldys Konsulat und Senatorenstand\" in Studia epigraphica in memoriam G\u00e9za Alf\u00f6ldy, hg. W. Eck, B. Feher, and P. Kov\u00e1cs (Bonn, 2013), p. 79 A native of North Africa, Maximus was the younger brother of Marcus Servilius Silanus suffect consul in 152, and a relative of Quintus Servilius Pudens, brother-in- law of emperor Lucius VerusG\u00e9za Alf\u00f6ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 314 == Career == His cursus honorum is partially known from an inscription set up in Rome. His first recorded office was quattuorviri viarum curandarum, one of the magistracies that comprised the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward a gaining entry into the Roman Senate. This was followed with his commission as military tribune with Legio I Minervia, stationed at Bonna (modern Bonn), in Germania Inferior. Maximus returned to Rome where he was elected quaestor, which he served at the city of Rome; upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy he would be enrolled in the Senate.Richard Talbert, The Senate of Imperial Rome (Princeton: University Press, 1984), p. 16 Following this he served as ab actis Senatus, or recorder of the Acta Senatus. Two more of the traditional Republican magistracies followed: curule aedile and praetor. After stepping down from the office of praetor, Maximus was selected to serve as legatus or adjunct to the proconsular governor of Asia; G\u00e9za Alf\u00f6ldy dates his office to circa 146. This was followed by a series of imperial appointments. First was curator of the Via Valeria; Alf\u00f6ldy dates his appointment to this curatorship between the years 147 and 150.Alf\u00f6ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 295 Then Maximus was commissioned legatus or commander of Legio III Gallica, which was stationed in Syria. Alf\u00f6ldy dates his tenure as commander from around the year 150 to 153.Alf\u00f6ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 298 After returning to Rome, he was appointed prefectus aerarum Saturninus, which Alf\u00f6ldy dates between the years 153 and 156.Alf\u00f6ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 292 His consulate followed. The consular portion of Maximus included three appointments. First was curator aedium sacrarum, or overseer of temples, which Alf\u00f6ldy dates to around the year 160.Alf\u00f6ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 290 His next appointment was as governor of Moesia Superior, which Alf\u00f6ldy dates from the year 161 to 162.Alf\u00f6ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 234 In that later year Marcus Jallius Bassus became a member of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius' comes or inner circle of advisors during the Parthian War, and Maximus was appointed to replace him as governor of Moesia Inferior; according to Alf\u00f6ldy, he held this governorship until the year 166.Alf\u00f6ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 232 Maximus' life is a blank after he left the second governorship. == References == Category:2nd-century Romans Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:Roman governors of Upper Moesia Category:Roman governors of Lower Moesia Fabianus Maximus, Marcus Servilius ",
