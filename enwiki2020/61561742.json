    "text": "The 2020 Green National Convention is an event in which delegates of the Green Party of the United States chose its nominees for president and vice president in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The convention was originally scheduled to be held from July 9\u201312, 2020, at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, but it was decided to instead hold the convention online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Site selection== On August 18, 2019, the Green National Committee selected Detroit, Michigan, as the site for the 2020 convention, to take place from July 9\u201312 at Wayne State University. Greenville, South Carolina, and Spartanburg, South Carolina, were also considered to host the convention. On April 24, 2020, it was instead announced that plans to have a physical convention were cancelled and that it would instead be held online, as Wayne State University informed the Green Party that it would be not able to accommodate them due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Delegate allocation== State Green Parties elect delegates to the presidential nominating convention, typically conducted through a state party convention, caucus or primary. National Green Party Identity Caucuses also elect delegates to the convention. Based on active state parties and caucuses, there can be up to 350 delegates in attendance, each committed to vote in reflection of their state party membership's preference. Utilizing proportional representation, many states send delegates representing multiple candidates, in contrast to a winner-take-all plurality voting system. The delegates of the presidential nominating convention are different from the elected delegates of the Green National Committee, the party's routine decision-making body. == Speakers == The following people have been announced as speakers at the convention:https://www.gp.org/green_party_presidential_nominating_convention *Ajamu Baraka, Green Party 2016 vice-presidential nominee, political activist and scholar, whose work has appeared in Black Agenda Report, Common Dreams, Dissident Voice. *Dr. Margaret Flowers, Organizing for Health Justice.
