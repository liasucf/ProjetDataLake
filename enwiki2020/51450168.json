    "text": "Pavadairayan at Om Sri Pavadairayan Temple, Ayipettai, Cuddalore. Lord Pavadairayan. One of the Male Tamil Deity. Son of Goddess Angalaparameswari. Lord Pavadairayan - At Panrutti Angalamman Mayanakollai Festival. Lord Pavadairayan is a popular regional Tamil male deity in rural Tamil Nadu, India. He is one of the Kaaval Dheivams of Tamil Nadu, India, and is of particular notability because he is the son of Angala Parameswari. In most temples he is depicted on the right knee of Angala Parameswari and is also said to be her guard. == Myths == === Mythological origin === In Hindu mythology, when Shakthi was reborn as Parvati, she mistook Brahma for Shiva and fell at his feet. When Parvati realized that Brahma was not Shiva, she became angry and prayed to Shiva that Brahma's fifth head would be destroyed. In response, Shiva cut off one of Brahma's heads as Rudra, which became a Brahmahathi Dosha. The four-headed Brahma cursed Shiva and fixed the fifth head to Shiva's hand, cursing Shiva to be perpetually hungry and unable to sleep. Shiva descended to earth and wandered with no definite destination. He begged and ate, but half of all the food he received was eaten by the fifth head of Brahma or \"Kabala\". While Shiva was roaming the earth, a leader of Kalvikkadu\u2014Pethandavan\u2014was robbing neighboring areas to provide for his people. He was powerful and rich but was troubled by his inability to have children. He and his wife Pethandachi prayed to Shiva for a child. After they prayed, Shiva appeared at Pethandavan and Pethandachi's house as a beggar. They fed him, and in return, Lord Shiva offered Pathandachi a prasadam and said, \"A male child will be born to you and he will bring fame to your family and he will become famous around the world\" before leaving. === Birth === Pethandavan and Pethandachi had a son. They named him \"Kalvikaathaan\" (the protector of Kalvikkadu) and treated the child as a gift of god. He was instructed in all the arts when he became five years old and became skilled at everything he learned. As time passed, Pethandavan grew old and he ordered his son to take his position and protect his region, but Kalvikaathaan was not interested in taking his father's job as they robbed, killed, and harassed residents to serve his people. He spoke to his father about his disinterest but Pethandavan did not listen. Kalvikaathaan left as a result. On his travels he saw the shape of a flame and grew afraid. He asked, \"who is this?\" The flame replied, \"My son, I am the goddess Angala Parameswari. I was waiting for you these many years. Don't be afraid. I will be there for you, my son.\" === Angala Parameswari's order === \"Only you can do a favour for me. A temple needs to be constructed for me by tomorrow morning (Amavasai). But for this, you need to do certain things.\" After following Angala Parameswari's instructions, Kalvikaththaan completed all of his tasks and submitted at the foot of Goddess Angala Parameswari. She asked him for one more thing: to put his kudal and eeru (tonsils and intestines) on a Paavadai. With no hesitation he took a sword and cut his tonsils and intestines and dedicated them to the goddess on the paavadai. === Pavadairayan as family deity === Angala Parameswari was pleased and took him up and kissed him so that he became Aangaara Sakthi (the power of a god status). The temple was consecrated successfully with all the proper rituals. The temple was Melmalayanoor Angala Parameswari Amman Temple. She gave authority to him that he would be her Mun Kaavalan (the protector from the front). Wherever I have a temple you will be having a sannidhi outside my temple. People offer you goat, hen, pig, etc. By this true dedication of you,\" let you be the Kula Dheivam (family deity) for the laity people.\" Since this time, Pavadairayan serves as a family deity or Kula Dheivam for most of the people. In Melmalayanoor Angala Parameswari Amman Temple, Tandavarayan sits next to Goddess Angala Parameswari Amman inside the temple. Outside the temple, Pavadairayan has a separate sannadhi that faces Angala Parameswari Amman along with his two wives Aranatchi Amman and Muthunatchi Amman to bless their devotees. === Parudhesiyappar Pavadairayar === Another story about Pavadairayan revolves around his meeting with Shiva. Due to Brahma's curse, Shiva suffered as a beggar in need of food. At that time, Pavadairayan ruled over the village of Vallam Padugai. Shiva, as a beggar, entered Vallam Padugai in need of food. Pavadairayan did not recognize Shiva and arrested him on suspicion of being a spy. When Sabam was complete devas came to search for Shiva and found he was in jail. After being told of the beggar's true identity, Pavadairayan prostrated himself at Shiva's feet and apologised. Shiva accepted him and blessed Pavadairayan to become the guard of Shiva with his two wives. As Shiva came as a beggar (Paradhesi Kola), the temple was named Parudhesiyappar Pavadairayar Temple. === Vallala Kandan === Lord Brahma lusted for Thilothama and sired 5 children that were born on earth\u2014Vallala Kandan and 4 sons\u2014who bothered the devas all day. To solve this, sage Naradar came and confused Vallala Kandan to meditate on Shiva to be the most powerful being in the world. Kandan took Nardar's advice and started to meditate on Shiva, who appeared before him and asked for the boons. He asked Shiva itself to be born as his son on his wife's womb. Shiva granted his wish and Kandan's wife conceived immediately. Shakthi, Shiva's wife, was shocked with Kandan's boons as she would lose her husband, so she ran to her brother Vishnu for help. Vishnu advised her that \"you have only one chance during the time of birth of the child\". Shakthi waited and at the end of the tenth month of conception, Kandan's wife shouted out in pain. During this time, Vishnu disappeared all the humans in the earth except Vallala Kandan and his four brothers to impede Kandan's search for a women to take care of his wife and to deliver the baby safely. Angala Parameswari disguised herself as an old lady and Pavadairayan as a small boy appeared before appearing in front of Vallala Kandan. Kandan approached her to deliver the baby safely. She accepted. Vallala Kandan promised the old lady to give her whatever she wished. The old lady asked for a knife and something else. Vallala Kandan had a doubt on giving knife but gave as to deliver the baby. She took Kandan's wife to a separate place and asked Pavadairayan to stand outside as a protector for her. Angala Parameswari took the opportunity and teared the stomach, womb of Vallala Kandan's wife and killed the baby. Vallala Kandan heard the screaming of his wife and came to witness her. At that time, Angala Parameswari ordered Pavadairayan and Veerabathrar to kill Kandan and his four brothers. Pavadairayan along with Veerabathrar killed them. === Rayanpuram and Royapuram === Branching off of Parudhesiyappar Pavadairayar, Pavadairayan arresting Shiva was sacrilegious. In order to forgive the sacrilege, Shiva advised Pavadairayan, \"In the north, there is a place called Aadhipuri, nearby there is a place called Palmgrove. In Palmgrove, Goddess Kali Devi, sits in the shadow of a palm tree and rules that place as an apparition. You must go to her and live as a protector for her, only then will you be cleansed.\" Pavadairayan went to the Palmgrove where Kali was ruling. During worship, Pavadairayan heard Kali's laughter. He worshiped her in the direction of her laughter, which Kali accepted. After that, Pavadairayan brought all of his people and army to Palmgrove and lived as a protector for her. The place where Pavadairayan and his people lived was called Rayampuram before being renamed Royapuram. The place where Pavadairayan served as a protector for Kali is Royapuram, Kalmandapam Angalaparameswari Amman Temple. == Speciality == Kaval Dheivam deities are usually placed outside the sannadhi of the main god. Pavadairayan is the only Kaaval Dheivam or Parivara Moorthy who has been portrayed sitting in the lap of Angala Parameswari. == Statue at Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History == Lord Aiyanar on Horse.
