Both works were engineered by Bob Ferbrache (Slim Cessna's Auto Club, 16 Horse Power, and Devotchka). The group signed with the iconic label Alternative Tentacles in 2014. LockerPartners produced \"Dark Junk and Light\", a 2013 short documentary on the band; the documentary was selected as a finalist for the International Documentary Challenge and was featured at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in Toronto. ITCHY-O was voted Denver's best Avant-Garde act in 2014 and best Experimental band in 2015, 2016, and 2017 by Westword. ITCHY-O has performed at events such as Riot Fest, Film on the Rocks at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Austin's Art Outdoors festival, the Stanley Film Festival, Tucson's All Souls Procession, San Francisco's Day of the Dead Festival, Atlanta's Goat Farm and Denver's Biennial of the Americas. They have played on stage with David Byrne & St. Vincent, and shared billing with Devo, Beats Antique, Warlock Pinchers, Extra Action Marching Band, The Melvins, March Fourth, and many others. ITCHY-O has performed at the world-renowned horror- fantasy festival, Fantastic Fest in Austin three years in a row (2015-2017) and played four centerpiece shows in Hobart, Tasmania at MONA FOMA's wintertime festival in 2016.https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dark- mofo-2019/PDFs/Dark+Mofo+Program+PDF+2016+7.1MB.pdf ITCHY-O performed at the immersive art exhibit Meow Wolf in Santa Fe, NM on March 25, 2017, as well as the Breckenridge International Festival of Arts on August 11, 2017. ITCHY-O's second full-length album, From the Overflowing was released on Alternative Tentacles in September 2017. The group embarked on a tour that autumn in support of the album. ITCHY-O performed From the Overflowing live in studio on WGN-TV on October 5, 2017. The band released a 2018 concept album on their own Mettle Studios label, with each side of the vinyl evoking a distinct realm: Mystic Spy engages with \"the idea of spiritual larceny or a sort of abstract esoteric espionage,\" while Psykho Dojo is devoted to taiko soundscapes.Itchy-O Talks New Album, Spaghetti Dinners and Starting a Record Label, September 14, 2018. ===Albums=== * Inferno (EP, 2011) * Burn the Navigator (LP, 2014) * From the Overflowing (LP, 2017) * Mystic Spy / Psykho Dojo (LP, 2018) ==Members== * Bryan Aquino \u2013 Snare * Sarah Ayako \u2013 Taiko * Scott Allen Banning \u2013 Roto-Toms * Ethan Barkzander \u2013 Taiko * David Britton \u2013 Microkorg * Robert Drew Burleson \u2013 Cymbals * Carlo Campagna \u2013 Cymbals * Paul Alexander's \u2013 Cymbals * Russ Cochrane \u2013 Bass * Geoff Brent \u2013 Vocoder * Joe Hatfield \u2013 Quad Tenors, Guitar, Timbales * Collin Elliot \u2013 Sampler * Ethan Kotel \u2013 Special Effects * Stephen Daniel Karpik \u2013 Bass Drum * Ethan Klein \u2013 Cymbals, Audio Engineer, Lighting * Thomas Knight \u2013 Taiko * Roger Liu \u2013 Guitar * Sara Miller \u2013 Timbales * Sean O\u2019malley \u2013 Quint Tenors * Toni Rib \u2013 Taiko * Brad Smalling \u2013 Audio Engineer * Aaron Spriggs \u2013 Effects/Theremin * Matt Steitle \u2013 Taiko * Kirsten Vermulen \u2013 Microkorg * Ryan Archuleta \u2013 Polyphonic * Jessalyn Amber \u2013 Creep Unit * Mariah Becerra \u2013 Special Effects * Rex Blatter \u2013 Chaos Tech * Megs Burd \u2013 Lion Dancer * Khena Bullshields \u2013 Lion Dancer * Steven Call \u2013 Polyphonic * Jackson Ellis \u2013 Special Effects, Fabracator, Industrialist * Evelyn Fugate \u2013 Creep Unit * Jen Ganun \u2013 Creep Unit * Sarah Harman \u2013 Creep Unit * Andrew Linares \u2013 Polyphonic * Joanne M.W.
