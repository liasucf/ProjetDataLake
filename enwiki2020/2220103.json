    "text": "Eric Maria Gerets (,In isolation, Gerets is pronounced . born 18 May 1954) is a Belgian football manager and former player who played as a right back. He started his playing career as an amateur for his local team AA Rekem, before achieving success with Standard Li\u00e8ge and PSV. Nicknamed \"The Lion (of Flanders)\", Gerets was regarded as one of the top right backs in Europe at his peak and is considered one of the greatest players in Belgian football history. He is famous for having captained PSV to their first and only European Cup win in 1988. As a coach, Gerets is best known for his advocacy of systems thinking. He is one of six managers \u2013 along with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Giovanni Trapattoni, Tomislav Ivi\u0107 and Ernst Happel \u2013 to have won domestic league championships in at least four countries. ==Club career== Gerets began his career playing for amateur side AA Rekem before joining then titleholders Standard de Li\u00e8ge. Making his debut 16 April 1972 coming on for Silvester Taka\u010d against FC Diest. In the 1972\u201373 season Standard reached the Cup final, manager Vlatko Markovi\u0107 let Gerets start despite not being an established first team member as Standard lost 2\u20131 to fierce rivals Anderlecht. The following season, Gerets replaced 29-year-old Jacques Beurlet and became the first choice right back for the Rouches. In 1975 Gerets made his debut for the national team. Gerets played for Standard Li\u00e8ge, Milan, MVV Maastricht and PSV, winning among others the 1987\u201388 European Cup, two Belgian championships and six Dutch championships. Gerets was an offensively-minded right back, known for his stamina, tactical discipline, grit and mental toughness. He was also known for long distance throw-ins. He is the third-most capped player for the Belgium national team, with 86 appearances and two goals. ===Standard Li\u00e8ge=== In the 1980s, a new generation of players emerged at Standard. Noted manager Ernst Happel was hired, and later the club brought Raymond Goethals back to Belgium. Players like Arie Haan, Guy Vandersmissen, Michel Preud'homme, Walter Meeuws, Jos Daerden and Simon Tahamata became key players, whilst Gerets was the captain of the team. In 1980, Standard finished runners-up in the league, before winning the 1981 National Cup with a 4\u20131 win over Lokeren SC. In 1982, Standard won the title by beating Waterschei SV Thor in the last match of the season. A few days later, they faced Barcelona in the European Cup Winners' Cup final, which they lost 2\u20131. The influence of Gerets on Standard's success was recognised when he was awarded the 1982 Belgian Golden Shoe. The following year he captained Standard to another league title, their ninth overall, which would prove to be their last until 2007\u201308. ===PSV=== Gerets (left) and Frits Philips (right) posing with the European Cup In 1985, Gerets joined PSV playing together with Ruud Gullit, Frank Arnesen, Huub Stevens and Willy van de Kerkhof followed by Brazilian star Rom\u00e1rio. In 1986, Gerets won the title with PSV, and after the departure of Gullit in 1987, Gerets became the new captain. Under Guus Hiddink PSV won the league and cup double three years in a row, Gerets scoring twice in the cup final against Roda JC. In 1988 PSV reached the UEFA European Cup final facing Benfica. After 120 minutes, it was still 0\u20130; PSV eventually won on penalties. In 1990, Bobby Robson was appointed as Hiddink's successor. Under Robson, Gerets won another two titles with PSV then he retired at the end of the 1991\u20131992 season at the age of 37. ==International career== Gerets registered 86 caps for the Belgium national team, making him the third-most capped player in their history. He made his debut for the squad in 1975, and played at four major tournaments: the 1980 European Championship, 1982 World Cup, 1986 World Cup, and 1990 World Cup. In 1980, Gerets played in his first European Championship in Italy. He scored the opening goal in a 2\u20131 win against Spain which ensured Belgium qualified as group winners. The tournament is remembered for the inspired performance of the offensively-minded Belgium (around rising stars such as Jan Ceulemans, Eric Gerets, Jean-Marie Pfaff and Erwin Vandenbergh) who unexpectedly reached the final, only losing to West Germany (1\u20132) by a Hrubesch goal two minutes from time. At the 1982 World Cup, Belgium, captained by Gerets, recorded one of their most famous victories with a 1\u20130 win over defending champions Argentina in the first game of the tournament held at Camp Nou with a goal by Erwin Vandenbergh, and an excellent defensive display to hold off a young Diego Maradona. Four years later, they achieved their best World Cup run at that time in 1986 when they placed fourth under command of players like Jan Ceulemans, Jean-Marie Pfaff and captain Gerets. Belgium surprisingly won against favourites the Soviet Union with stars such as Igor Belanov and Rinat Dasayev (3\u20134) after extra time. Belgium also beat Spain on penalties, but they lost to eventual champions Argentina in the semi-final (0\u20132), inspired by Maradona. Despite their defeat, Belgium would end up in fourth place \u2013 their best finish in World Cup competition until it was surpassed in 2018 when they reached third place. Gerets would also captain his nation to the 1990 World Cup finals. Belgium failed to convert their chances against England in the second round. They lost in the last minute of extra time after a goal by David Platt. ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Belgium's goal tally first. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! # !! Date !!
