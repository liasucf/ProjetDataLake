It is hosted by paleontologist Scott Sampson and narrated by actor Christian Slater. It was released on DVD as a two-disc pack on February 17, 2004,http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/9988/dinosaur-planet-real-big-stories/ and was also released on VHS around the same time. The format is similar to Discovery's earlier series When Dinosaurs Roamed America. Each episode tells a fictionalized account of a dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous period. The animals are recreated with computer-generated imagery and composited into present-day filmed locations that approximate prehistoric Earth. Periodic interludes (three in each episode) feature Scott Sampson explaining the scientific findings behind the story, also similar to When Dinosaurs Roamed America, but has improved in quality. ==Episodes== ==Marketing== There were a couple of different websites for the series that were created back in November 2003, which included promos on the central characters of each of the episodes, and showed animations of them in a white background.Dinosaur Planet home on the Wayback Machine: https://web.archive.org/web/20031123103254/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/dinosaurplanet/dinosaurplanet.htmlInside the Dinosaur Planet website: http://www.bluefieldarts.com/design- portfolio/?portfolio=dinosaur-planet-marketing The site appeared to have some of its format taken away by June 2006,Dinosaur Planet site home dumbed down: https://web.archive.org/web/20060615071042/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/dinosaurplanet/dinosaurplanet.html but the link remained intact on the site until December 2008,Dinosaur Planet site finally unavailable: https://web.archive.org/web/20081224065705/http://dsc.discovery.com/dinosaurs/ when the link finally redirected to the dinosaur section of Discovery's website, and about five years after the show originally premiered.
