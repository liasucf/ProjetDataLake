When he died in 1876, it passed to his son David C. Voorhees. At this time the house was known as Maplewood. When he died in 1898, the farm was sold to the State of New Jersey to be used as the New Jersey State Village for Epileptics. Maplewood then became the Superintendent's Residence of the Village. ==Gallery== File:David C. Voorhees House, Blawenburg, NJ - drawing.jpg|Drawing from 1881 of Maplewood, residence of David C.
