Growing to tall and wide, it is an evergreen perennial or subshrub bearing long, narrow leaves with a prominent white midrib, and clusters of green and yellow flowers in summer. The flowering period may be extended in favourable locations. It is valued in cultivation for its vivid flowers, and its ability to survive drought conditions. Though hardy down to it is seen at its best in a warm, sheltered position. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s Award of Garden Merit.
