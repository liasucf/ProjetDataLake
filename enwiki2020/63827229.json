He was responsible for the collating and creating of 'Kit\u0101b f\u012b l-adwiya al-mufrada' (\u201cBook of simple drugs\u201d), a remarkable compendium of some 400 hand-drawn and coloured images of plants and animals, popularly known as the \u201cHerbal of al-Ghafiqi\". The Herbal draws on ancient Greek sources like Dioscorides and Galen and more than thirty other works from India and the Hellenistic and Islamic worlds. https://mqup.tumblr.com/post/101358861104/the-herbal-of-al- gh%C4%81fiq%C4%ABhttps://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia- of-islam-3/al-ghafiqi-abu-jafar- COM_27420?s.num=2&s.rows;=50https://www.mcgill.ca/library/branches/osler/ghafiqi Sir William Osler purchased a manuscript copy of the Herbal in 1912 and it was chosen for reproduction in a modern edition by McGill University - it deals with herbal, mineral, and animal-derived drugs. The edition has a glossary of over 2 000 entries providing synonyms in Greek, Sanskrit, Syriac, Persian, Berber, Old Spanish, Latin, Coptic, and Armenian, underlining the international nature of medicine and pharmacy at the time of its compilation. https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/secrets-12th-century-medicine- revealed-herbal-al-ghafiqi-165494 Herbal and botanical gardens, generally, have always been greatly prized in the Arab world, and the gardens of al- Andalus were no exception, giving Ab\u016b Ja\u02bffar al-Gh\u0101fiq\u012b ample access to specimens for describing and illustrating. The exiled Syrian Abd al-Rahman I created an opulent garden in his palace Al-Munyat al-Rusafa (Arruzafa) in 756 and it was destroyed in 1010 by the Berbers. The garden had been to remind him of his former palace at Al-Rusafa, Syria where he had lived with his grandfather, the caliph Hisham (691\u2013743). https://www.doaks.org/resources/middle-east-garden- traditions/introduction/andalusian ==See also== *Medicine in the medieval Islamic world ==External links== *Indigenous Bedouin Medicine ==References== Category:Botanists Category:Pharmacologists ",
