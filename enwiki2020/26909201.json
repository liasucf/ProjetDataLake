    "text": "Lost Dakota is a small portion of land that was left over after the division of the relatively gigantic former Dakota Territory into five other states in the late 19th century.Beyond 50: American States That Might Have Been. NPR. Retrieved June 22, 2013. == Size and Location == Lost Dakota was approximately in size, and a third the size of Manhattan. The exclave was located at the tripoint between the current states of Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana. Lost Dakota was located 360 miles (580 km) west of the territory, which by then consisted of the current Dakota states. == History and Current Status == Officially, the land was still a part of the Dakota Territory; however, it had been forgotten by the government, wiped from any potential public view that it could have had for around five whole years due to faulty maps and surveys. It has retrospectively been speculated to have been a superb area for criminals to escape the law from, due to its forgotten location and lack of development; however, there is no evidence proving that criminals ever sought refuge in the exclave.http://antiqueprintsblog.blogspot.be/2013/06/shaping-trans- mississippi-west-1866-69.html In 1873, it was annexed and incorporated into Gallatin County, Montana Territory, and has remained part of the county in the state of Montana ever since. Lost Dakota is extremely distant from settlement to this day and completely undeveloped, being without a street, road, or even a footpath as of 2010, and is reportedly \"plagued\" by grizzly bears.Michael J.
