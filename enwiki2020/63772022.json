    "text": "Lenarviricota is a phylum of RNA viruses, which includes all positive-strand RNA viruses, which infect prokaryotes. Some members also infect eukaryotes. The name of the group is a portmanteau of the names of member families \"Leviviridae and Narnaviridae\" and -viricota which is the suffix for a virus phylum. It has been suggested that the origin of Lenarviricota may predate that of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). ==Taxonomy== Phylogenetic tree of Lenarviricota (top), genome of different members and major conserved proteins (bottom) The following classes are recognized: * Allassoviricetes * Amabiliviricetes * Howeltoviricetes * Miaviricetes ==References== Category:Viruses ",
