    "text": "DaVinci Academy of Science and the Arts is a charter school district consisting of several campuses that serve students K-12 located in northern Utah and primarily operated out of Ogden, Utah. ==History== DaVinci Academy started operation on April 15, 2004. It was named after Leonardo da Vinci. Originally located in the Old Post Office Building, its main campus is now located in the former American Can Company of Utah Building Complex in downtown Ogden, at 2033 Grant Avenue. During its first year of operation, the student body consisted of the 9th and 10th grades. Gradually over time, the school became a full High School with grades 9\u201312, a Junior High serving students grades 7 and 8, as well as a K\u20136 Elementary school. It has now expanded to include four other campuses that include an on-campus K\u20136 school and distance elementary school programs. In the spring of 2007, the school had its first graduating class. Most graduates had been at the school since its beginning. The ceremony was held at Perry's Egyptian Theater on May 25, 2007. ==Renovations== In late 2008, the school board decided to purchase the building located at 283 20th Street, north of the school. In the beginning of the 2009\u221210 academic year, the building was unveiled as a center for the 7th\u22129th graders. The two buildings are connected with a corridor. There was also some renovation done to the south building. Parts of the commons area were demolished to make room for three new classrooms. For a time, the elementary program was located in the same building as the high school. Kindergarten to 6th grades were located on the 3rd floor of the north building. The school board then expanded to buy two more buildings at different locations but still in the downtown Ogden area. These buildings are located at 215 22nd Street and 2221 Grant Ave. The building on 22nd Street is now the home of the DaVinci Academy Elementary School, hosting grades K\u20136 in on-site instruction. The 2221 Grant Avenue building is the headquarters of the distance elementary program, where students come on campus intermittently between taking online courses from home. The distance elementary program has also expanded to two more locations: one in South Jordan, Utah and the other in Kaysville, Utah. The original buildings at 2033 Grant Avenue are still the campus of the DaVinci Academy secondary school. After the establishment of DaVinci Academy Elementary in its own structure, the entirety of the building is dedicated to the secondary program, including 7th to 12th grades. Currently, the south building is used for the main office, computer labs and cafeteria. The first floor of the north building is used for the counseling and behavior offices, gymnasium, school store, board room and theater. The second and third floors are mostly used for classroom space but also include the Library, robotics lab and a few administrator offices. ==Premise== The founding premise of the school was a project-based learning environment focusing on science and the arts. DaVinci Academy's graduation requirements require more course credits in all academic areas and the arts than does Utah's public school system. ==Awards and Recognition== n 2008, DaVinci received recognition from the Utah Association of Public Charter Schools as its Utah State Charter School of the Year at its annual conference. DaVinci Academy students often participate in, and receive awards for, State and National Competitions. A few of the awards won by students includes Envirothon, Academic Decathlon, Academic Pentathlon, Team America Rocketry Challenge, Idaho State One Act, Sterling Scholar, and VEX Robotics. Students are encouraged to participate in these competitions and showcases as a part of their Science and Arts education. ==Athletics== There are several sports played by the High School students at the school. Basketball, Bowling, Cross Country Running, Association Football (commonly called Soccer), and Volleyball are the sports in which students participate. DaVinci Academy competes in the Utah School Sports Association with other charter and private schools in the Wasatch Front region of Utah. The Athletic Program has had success on many fronts, winning conference titles in Bowling, Cross Country, Soccer and Volleyball. ==External links== * DaVinci Academy * DaVinci's Notebook ==References== Category:Charter schools in Utah Category:Educational institutions established in 2004 Category:Public elementary schools in Utah Category:Public high schools in Utah Category:Public middle schools in Utah Category:Schools in Weber County, Utah Category:Schools in Utah ",
