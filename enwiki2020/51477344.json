Against this background it was decided to merge the auctions of Bloemenlust and Central Aalsmeer Auction. The merger took effect on March 6, 1968. The organization continued as: Aalsmeer Flower Auction (Verenigde Bloemenveiling Aalsmeer or V.B.A.:United Flower Auction Aalsmeer) In 1972 a new auction complex at Legmeerdijk came into use. The complex covered an area of nine hectares. Further expansion followed and in 1999 the Aalsmeer Flower Auction and its customers took the first parts of the VBA South into use. This is located on the other side of the provincial road N231. Seven years later the first known plans for VBA Oost were drawn up. VBA Oost has a size of 36 hectares. Construction started in 2009. The main auction building was constructed in 2007 and covers an area of approximately 860,000 sqm and is the largest indoor market building in the world. Other important milestones were in 1973, when the VBA allowed suppliers to market their products through an agency and 2006 when international membership was introduced.

His flowers were auctioned at the vegetable clock, as there was no clock for flowers. Later went many growers instead of vegetables, grow flowers. For example, a flower was born. After a year as many flowers already were auctioned on CVV, there was built a separate Bloemenhal in Grubbenvorst. This is the place where Venlo location is still located.
