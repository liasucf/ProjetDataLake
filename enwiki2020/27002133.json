It was painted by many painters under the direction of Jan Styka in the Lw\u00f3w (Lviv) rotunda, located in Stryjski Park, the same place where the Rac\u0142awice Panorama was painted. The project was finished in September 1897 by painters of three nations: *Hungarian: Tiham\u00e9r Margitay, P\u00e1l V\u00e1g\u00f3 and B\u00e9la Sp\u00e1nyi, *Polish: Tadeusz Popiel, Zygmunt Rozwadowski, Micha\u0142 Gorstkin-Wywi\u00f3rski, *and the German painter Leopold Sch\u00f6nchen. The painting was exhibited in Lwow, Budapest and Warsaw. It was cut into 100 pieces but only 31 of them now survive. Twenty fragments currently are located in a few Polish museums in Tarn\u00f3w, Warsaw, Krosno and \u0141\u0119czyca. Another 11 pieces are in private collections in Poland and abroad.Kwartalnik: \"Cenne, bezcenne, utracone\" nr 2(51) kwiecie\u0144-czerwiec 2007, A.
