    "text": "\"All Right Now\" is a single by the English rock band Free. The song, released in 1970, hit #2 on the UK singles chart and #4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. \"All Right Now\" originally appeared on the album Fire and Water, which Free recorded on the Island Records label, formed by Chris Blackwell. In 1991, the song was re-released, reaching #8 on the UK singles chart. \"All Right Now\" was a #1 hit in over 20 territories and was recognised by ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers) in 1990 for garnering 1,000,000 plus radio plays in the U.S. by late 1989. In 2006, the BMI London awards included a Million Air award for 3 million air plays of \"All Right Now\" in the USA. ==Composition== According to drummer Simon Kirke, \"All Right Now\" was written by Free bassist Andy Fraser and singer Paul Rodgers in the Durham Students' Union building, Dunelm House. He said: \"'All Right Now' was created after a bad gig in Durham. We finished our show and walked off the stage to the sound of our own footsteps. The applause had died before I had even left the drum riser. It was obvious that we needed a rocker to close our shows. All of a sudden the inspiration struck Fraser and he started bopping around singing 'All Right Now'. He sat down and wrote it right there in the dressing room. It couldn\u2019t have taken more than ten minutes.\" Fraser has agreed largely with this history. ==Chart history== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1970) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|44 |- |- |Canada RPM Top Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|4 |- |Denmark (Tracklisten) |align=center|1 |- |- |France (SNEP) |align=center|4 |- |- | |- |- |- |- |Sweden (Radio Sweden) |align=center|1 |- |- |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 |align=center|4 |- |U.S. Cash Box Top 100 |align=\"center\"|3 |- |} ===Year- end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1970) ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Rank |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|42 |- |UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|7 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100Musicoutfitters.com | style=\"text-align:center;\"|27 |- |U.S. Cash Box | style=\"text- align:center;\"|38 |- |} ==Certifications== ==Personnel== * Paul Rodgers \u2013 lead vocal * Paul Kossoff \u2013 electric guitar * Andy Fraser \u2013 bass guitar, piano * Simon Kirke \u2013 drums ==Cover versions== \"All Right Now\", recorded by Mike Oldfield (produced by Tom Newman), with vocals by Wendy Roberts, Pierre Moerlen and Tom Newman, was issued as a one-sided promotional blue 7\" single flexi-disc in 1979. The single was given only to Virgin Records executives and never issued to the public, making it one of the most elusive collectors' items in the Oldfield catalogue (number Virgin TT-362). Also in 1979, studio disco group Witch Queen released a disco version of the song, as a double A-side with a cover of T. Rex's Bang a Gong. It peaked at number eight on the US Billboard disco chart. Since 1972, \"All Right Now\" as arranged by the Stanford Band has been the de facto fight song of Stanford University athletic teams. American soul singer Lea Roberts recorded the song on her 1975 album Lady Lea (United Artists UA-LA418-G). Rod Stewart recorded the song and released it as a single in the U.S., reaching #72 in the winter of 1985.Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990 - Pepsi & Shirlie recorded the song as a single (#50) and an album (#69) of the same name in 1987. Lemonescent had a cover version of that song reaching #7 in Scotland and #37 in the UK in 2004 before the group was disbanded. ==See also== * Return of the Champions * Super Live in Japan * List of 1970s one-hit wonders in the United States == References == ==External links== * Lyrics of live cover by Queen + Paul Rodgers from Live in Ukraine, from Queen official website Category:1970 singles Category:Stanford University Category:Pac-12 Conference fight songs Category:Rod Stewart songs Category:Free (band) songs Category:Songs written by Paul Rodgers Category:Songs written by Andy Fraser Category:1970 songs Category:Island Records singles Category:A&M; Records singles Category:Number- one singles in Sweden Category:Number-one singles in Denmark ",
