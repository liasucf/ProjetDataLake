    "text": "The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) is a council, chartered (or re-chartered) in each administration with a broad mandate to advise the President of the United States on science and technology. The current PCAST was established by on September 30, 2001, by President George W. Bush, was re-chartered by President Obama's April 21, 2010, , and was most recently re-chartered by President Trump's October 22, 2019, . ==History== The council follows a tradition of presidential advisory panels focused on science and technology that dates back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Science Advisory Board, continued by President Harry Truman. Renamed the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) by Dwight Eisenhower, it was disbanded by President Richard Nixon. Reagan science advisor Jay Keyworth re-established a smaller \"White House Science Council\" It reported, however, to him, not directly to the President.Robert C. Cowan, \"Reagan Adviser Keyworth on Administration's Science Policy\", Christian Science Monitor, January 22, 1985. Renamed PCAST, and reporting directly to the President, a new council was chartered by President George H. W. Bush in 1990, enabling the President to receive advice directly from the private and academic sectors on technology, scientific research priorities, and mathematics and science education.Elizabeth Pennisi, \"Low-Key Start For Bush's Science Panel\", The Scientist, March 5, 1990. ==Mission== The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology mission is to provide advice to the President and the Executive Office of the President. PCAST makes policy recommendations in areas such as understanding of science, technology, and innovation. PCAST is administered by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Recent PCAST reports have addressed antibiotic resistance, education technology (with a focus on MOOCs), cybersecurity, climate change, networking and information technology, and agricultural preparedness, among many others. == Members and structure == PCAST has been enlarged since its inception and currently consists of 18 members plus the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, who serves as the Council's Co-Chair. The council members, distinguished individuals appointed by the President, are drawn from industry, education, research institutions, and other NGOs. The council is administered by an Executive Director. On October 22, 2019, after a record 33 months since President Obama's PCAST held its final meeting, the Trump administration issued an executive order reestablishing the PCAST, appointing its first seven members: * Catherine Bessant, the chief operations and technology officer at Bank of America * Shannon Blunt, a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Kansas * Dario Gil, an electrical engineer and computer scientist, as well as the director IBM Research * Dorota Grejner-Brzezinska, a Professor of Engineering at Ohio State University, as well as Associate Dean for Research * Sharon Hrynkow, chief scientific officer at Cylo Therapeutics, Inc., a biotechnology company that focuses on research around rare diseases * Herbert Fisk Johnson III, the CEO of S.
