I couldn\u2019t find the kind of plays I wanted to do with today's Indian children, so I started writing them and then found there weren\u2019t many storybooks that fitted my brief either. So I started writing those.\" Anand's writing covers topics such as communal hatred, failure, sexual abuse and being different, and is often intended for a young audience. == Translations == Anand's book No Guns at My Son's Funeral made it to the IBBY Honors List of 2006 and has been translated into Spanish and German. == Awards and recognitions == Anand won the National Sahitya Akademi Bal Sahitya Puraskar in 2017 for her collection of short stories, Wild Child and Other Stories (now published as \"Like Smoke: 20 Teens 20 Stories\").
