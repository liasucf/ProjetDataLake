Taking place shortly after 08:00 on a Wednesday morning, the attack began when a car filled with explosives rammed the gate of the Dayah Hotel, a luxury hotel popular with politicians, and detonated. Immediately after, four armed militants attempted to storm the hotel \u2013 however Somali security guards shot the men dead before they reached it. As emergency services and journalists converged on the scene, a second car bomb detonated, causing more casualties. Radio Andalus, a station with links to Al-Shabaab, reported that \"well-armed mujahideen attacked the hotel, and now they are fighting inside the hotel.\" The attack came shortly before the date of the country's presidential election was due to be announced. ==See also== * Makka al-Mukarama hotel attack * Jazeera Palace Hotel bombing * June 2016 Mogadishu attacks * February 2017 Mogadishu bombing * Asasey Hotel attack ==References== Category:2010s in Mogadishu Category:2017 in Somalia Category:2017 murders in Somalia Category:2010s crimes in Mogadishu Category:21st-century mass murder in Somalia Category:Al-Shabaab (militant group) attacks in Mogadishu Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in 2017 Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in Mogadishu Category:Attacks on hotels in Africa Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2017 Category:January 2017 crimes Category:January 2017 events in Africa Category:Mass murder in 2017 Category:Mass murder in Mogadishu Category:Suicide bombings in 2017 Category:Suicide bombings in Mogadishu Category:Suicide car and truck bombings in Somalia Category:Terrorist incidents in Somalia in 2017 Category:Terrorist incidents involving vehicular attacks Category:Vehicular rampage in Africa Category:Somali Civil War (2009\u2013present) Category:Building bombings in Somalia Category:Hotel bombings ",
