The Swedes tried to outflank and surround the defending Russians. The Bj\u00f6rneborg Regiment under Georg Carl von D\u00f6beln distinguished itself during the battle. In the end the Russians managed to retreat, but the victory was an important one for the Swedish as it allowed them to continue their offensive. ==Notes, citations and sources== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * Lapua Lapua 1808 Category:Lapua Lapua Lapua Category:History of South Ostrobothnia Category:July 1808 events ",
