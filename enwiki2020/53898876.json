He attended the primary school and the gymnasium of his native place. The little boy received his first violin lessons during the school education. Karl Heisler, his private violin instructor of Danube Swabian origin, recommended further promotion of his musical talent in Vienna. At the age of ten years, Kran\u010devi\u0107 arrived in the capital city of the Austrian Empire and continued his education. In 1859, he completed the entrance examination at the Viennese Conservatory of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. Joseph Hellmesberger Sr. immediately recognized his extraordinary talent and accepted him as a student. In 1861, Kran\u010devi\u0107 gave his first public performance in Pan\u010devo, a charity concert in favor of beneficial purposes for the City hospital. In March of 1862, he made his Viennese debut at the ballroom of the Old Musikverein\u2019s building, a charity concert in favor of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Until the end of his studies in 1867, the young man gave several charity performances with the Hellmesberger Quartet in favor of the Concordia Association of Writers and other Viennese organizations at the Theater am Franz-Josefs-Kai, the Sofiensaal and the Little Redoute Ballroom of the Hofburg.

A highlight during his concert tour of 1872 was a multi-day celebration with Davorin Jenko, the First Belgrade Singing Society and other artists in honor of the beginning of Milan IV Obrenovic's reign. He was enthusiastically acclaimed by the honorable audience after his performances at the Serbian National Theater during two summer evenings. Since 1873, he was a member of the orchestra of Budapest's Royal Hungarian National Theater and in 1888, he was appointed first concertmaster of the Royal Hungarian Opera Orchestra during the tenue of Gustav Mahler. Kran\u010devi\u0107 finished his career in 1901, retired into private life and went back to Vienna. There he lived very withdrawn from the society and the artist no longer appeared publicly. In 1922, he sold his Stradivari violin to Jan Kubelik for twenty-five thousand Czech crowns because of his personal life situation during the Austrian economic crisis.Mihovil Tomandl, Dragomir Kran\u010devi\u0107, Udru\u017eenje kompozitora Srbije, Belgrade 1951.Reviews of performances by Kran\u010devi\u0107 in historical newspapers at ANNO, Viennese Debut, Retrieved on 2017-04-27.Report on celebration in Belgrade, August 1872, Mlada Srbadija III/35, p.559, Retrieved on 2017-05-01Alad\u00e1r Sch\u00f6pflin, Magyar Szinm\u00fcv\u00e9szeti Lexikon, Az Orsz\u00e1gos Szin\u00e9szegyes\u00fclet, Budapest 1929-1931, Volume 3, p. 52 (PDF).
