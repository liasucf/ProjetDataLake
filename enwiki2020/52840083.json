Dianthus freynii prefers the shallow limestone soils, at organogenic and organomineral moldy soils and dolomite sirozes. This carnation is endemic to the Dinaric mountains, with the center of area on high Herzegovinian mountains Prenj and \u010cvrsnica and its northeastern plateau Plasa (locus classicus), between the Doljanka river, Neretva, and Grabovica river.
