Anthrax was announced as a replacement for Megadeth, who had to cancel due to lead vocalist and guitarist Dave Mustaine being diagnosed with throat cancer. The event also consisted of a car show and motocross demo, and be hosted by former Metal Show host Eddie Trunk.The festival was reported to have been enjoyed by all who attended, despite the cold conditions at night. It was announced on November 29th, 2019 that the festival would not be returning in 2020. No official reason has yet been given, however many have speculated it was due to low attendance. It is not yet known if the festival will return after 2020. Most likely cause of them not returning is the medical emergency that happened Sunday night during Ministry\u2019s performance. The entire staff dropped the ball when it mattered the most. Subsequently the man died at the hospital a week later. It took medical crews over 10 minutes to start CPR. == References == Category:2019 establishments in Tennessee Category:Music festivals in Tennessee ",
