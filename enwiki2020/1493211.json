    "text": "Alexander Brandon (also known as Siren in the demoscene and tracker community, born September 24, 1974) is an American musician, former member of Straylight Productions, who composed music mostly for games produced by Epic Games, or games based on Epic technology, including Unreal, Unreal Tournament, Deus Ex, Tyrian, Jazz Jackrabbit 2 and the cancelled game Jazz Jackrabbit 3D. Brandon is also a voice actor, having been cast most recently for the parts of Ancano and Amaund Motierre in the Role Playing Game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim by Bethesda Game Studios. Brandon started composing music at the age of 14 when he got an Ad Lib music synthesizer card for Christmas. He worked in several MOD music groups over his composing years in the late 1990s, including the Kosmic Free Music Foundation. During that time he also composed for several musicdisks such as Return to Stage 9. Brandon has built several audio departments, starting with Ion Storm Austin in mid-2000. This was followed with an audio director position at Midway Home Entertainment in San Diego until 2007 when he started the audio department at Obsidian Entertainment. In February 2009 he built the audio department at Heatwave Interactive, also providing business development and overall media management. In April 2010 Alex launched Funky Rustic, an independent audio production studio, working out of Georgetown, Texas. ==Past nicknames== During his tracker career, Alex has used several nicknames: * 1995: first tracks released under the name \"Chromatic Dragon\" * end of 1995: name changed to \"Siren\" * middle of 1996, during KFMF membership: name temporarily changed to \"Sandman\" * end of 1996: name changed back to \"Siren\" Note that there were several (two or three) tracker musicians around the world, who have used the nickname \"Sandman\" independently of Alex. ==Influences== Alexander Brandon's influences include Peter Gabriel, Dream Theater, Frost*, Andrew Sega, Steve Vai, and Ozric Tentacles, among others.Alexander Brandon at Fandalism ==Personal life== Brandon lives in Georgetown, Texas with his family.MAGFest - Alexander Brandon Retrieved 2018-04-19. ==Works== ===Video games=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"auto\" |- !Year !Title !Role(s) !Notes |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1995||Tyrian||Composer, level designer, writing, story, dialogue||rowspan=\"2\"| |- |Extreme Pinball||Sound effects |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1998||Jazz Jackrabbit 2||rowspan=\"3\"|Composer||With Sean Hiller and Bryan Rudge |- |Unreal||rowspan=\"2\"|With Michiel van den Bos, Dan Gardop\u00e9e and Andrew Sega |- |rowspan=\"4\"|1999||Unreal Tournament |- |Tyrian 2000||Project leader, writing, dialogue, story, composer|| |- |Dark Vengeance||rowspan=\"6\"|Composer||With Andrew Schlesinger, Mark Styles |- |Vigilante 8||rowspan=\"2\"|Nintendo 64 version, with Dan Gardop\u00e9e |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2000||Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense |- |Deus Ex||With Michiel van den Bos and Dan Gardop\u00e9e |- |rowspan=\"4\"|2003||Unreal II: The Awakening||With Jack Wall, Clint Bajakian, Jeremy Soule and Crispin Hands |- |Battlestar Galactica||rowspan=\"5\"| |- |Deus Ex: Invisible War||Audio Director, sound effects, music |- |Activision Anthology||Composer |- |2004||Thief: Deadly Shadows||Cinematic post sound effects |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2005||NARC||Audio manager |- |Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows||Audio Director, music, sound effects||With Inon Zur, Rednote Audio and Alistair Cooper |- |rowspan=\"6\"|2006||Rampage: Total Destruction||Audio engineer||rowspan=\"10\"| |- |MLB Slugfest 2006||Dialogue recording |- |Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run||rowspan=\"6\"|Audio director |- |Happy Feet |- |The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy |- |The Ant Bully |- |rowspan=\"3\"|2007||TouchMaster |- |Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer |- |Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Zombie Ninja Pro-Am||Special thanks |- |2008||Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir||Audio director |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2010||Bejeweled 3||Composer||With Peter Hajba and Allister Brimble |- |Alpha Protocol||Additional Sound Effects & Foley||rowspan=\"2\"| |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2011||Bejeweled: Classic||Audio |- |Deus Ex: Human Revolution||rowspan=\"2\"|Composer||With Michael McCann and Yohann Boudreault |- |2012||Dust: An Elysian Tail||With HyperDuck SoundWorks |- |rowspan=\"3\"|2013||Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles||rowspan=\"2\"|Sound effects||rowspan=\"15\"| |- |Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded |- |Aliens: Colonial Marines||Additional sound design |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2014||Wasteland 2||Sound design |- |Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze||Contract audio |- |2016||Job Simulator: The 2050 Archives||Audio |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2017||Torment: Tides of Numenera||Audio director, sound design and implementation |- |Aven Colony||Composer |- |2018||The Bard's Tale IV: Barrows Deep||Sound Design/Audio Consultant |- |Unreleased||Jazz Jackrabbit 3||Composer |- |} ===Other work=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"auto\" |- !Year !Title !Notes |- |rowspan=\"3\"|1999||AtmosphereS: Cultures||rowspan=\"3\"|With Dan Gardop\u00e9e |- |AtmosphereS: Moods |- |AtmosphereS: Pulses |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2000||AtmosphereS: Dreams||rowspan=\"2\"|With George \"The Fat Man\" Sanger |- |AtmosphereS: Rhythms |- |2008||Era's End||With Bryan Rudge |- |2010||Earthscape||rowspan=\"4\"| |- |2011||Violet Eclectic |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2014||Just Fun |- |Just Fun Miami |} ===Voice acting=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"auto\" |- !Title !Role(s) |- |Deus Ex: Invisible War||Generic Citizen, Tracer Tong |- |Thief: Deadly Shadows||Keepers |- |Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows||The Emperor |- |L.
