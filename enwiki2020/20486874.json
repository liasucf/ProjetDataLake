He represented the Marne department, and was a member of the Gauche d\u00e9mocrate et r\u00e9publicaine. ==Biography== Early Life Jean- Claude Thomas was born on 16 March 1950 in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. Born to Roger Thomas and Georgette Roy, his family collectively ran a grocery store in Paris. When he was three years old, he was sent to Ni\u00e8vre to live with his aunt and grandparents. He graduated from the boarding school Lyc\u00e9e Jules-Renard in 1968, and went to medical school in Dijon. He later earned a doctoral degree from a dental school in Reims and became a dentist in 1978. Political Career Thomas became deputy to Jean Falala in 1981 and continued in his position when Falala was elected mayor of Reims in 1983. In 1985, Thomas became General Councillor of the newly created Reims-10 district. Thomas was elected Deputy of the 3rd District of Marne on 18 June 1988 with a slim 50.29% majority over Jean-Claude Fontalirand. He was re-elected in 1992, 1997, 2002, and 2007. Jean Falala resigned in 1999 amid health concerns, and was succeeded by Jean-Louis Schneiter. Schneiter kept Thomas as General Councillor, and was re-elected in 2001. However, in 2008, Thomas was defeated by socialist St\u00e9phane Rummel, with 58.15% to 41.85% of votes. Thomas opted not to run for re-election in Marne's 3rd district in the 2012 elections, instead being succeeded by Philippe-Armand Martin. Jean-Claude Thomas died on 13 November 2018 at age 68. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Politicians from Paris Category:Rally for the Republic politicians Category:Union for a Popular Movement politicians Category:Deputies of the 9th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 10th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 11th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 12th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 13th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic ",
