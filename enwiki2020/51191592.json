    "text": "Nicolae Cartojan (December 4, 1883-December 20, 1944) was a Romanian literary historian. Born in Uzunu, Giurgiu County, his parents were Anghel Cartojan and Maria (n\u00e9e Petrescu). He graduated from Bucharest's Saint Sava National College in 1902. He then enrolled in the literature and philosophy faculty of Bucharest University, where Ioan Bianu was one of his professors, and graduated in 1906. Early on, he developed an interest in early Romanian literature and in researching the manuscripts of the Romanian Academy Library, where he worked from 1906 to 1912. At the same time, he was a teaching assistant. From 1912 to 1914, Cartojan attended speciality courses in Berlin, and in 1920 obtained a doctorate with a thesis about the Alexander romance in Romanian literature. Named an instructor in Bianu's department in 1921, he rose to associate professor in 1923 and, in 1930, was made full professor in the department of the history of early Romanian literature. In 1941, he was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy. Membrii Academiei Rom\u00e2ne din 1866 p\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een prezent at the Romanian Academy site After a series of preparatory studies, Cartojan published C\u0103r\u021bile populare \u00een literatura rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 (vol. I, 1929; vol. II, 1938). This work featured a minute analysis of texts that had almost entirely escaped critical research. Its erudition, sound philological method and meticulousness allowed him to synthesize a vast set of materials dealing with folk books. Its general approach remains valid, and it brought the author an international reputation. He joined the Medieval Academy of America in 1929, worked with Paul Van Tieghem on R\u00e9pertoire chronologique des litt\u00e9ratures modernes and was granted an honorary doctorate by the University of Padua in 1942. The first three of a planned four volumes of Istoria literaturii rom\u00e2ne vechi, a history of early Romanian literature, appeared between 1940 and 1945. He was the founder of modern research into the field.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, vol. I, p. 280. Pite\u0219ti: Editura Paralela 45, 2004. A high school in Giurgiu was named after him in 1990.
