She is known for her research on scutoids (polyhedron- like shapes that can pack the space between pairs of curved surfaces) and for her popularization of mathematics. ==Education and career== Grima was born in 1971 in Coria del R\u00edo. She completed her doctorate in mathematics from the University of Seville in 1998, and is a professor of applied mathematics at the same university. Grima also serves as president for the committee on popularization of the Royal Spanish Mathematical Society. ==Books== Grima's books include: *Computational Geometry on Surfaces: Performing Computational Geometry on the Cylinder, the Sphere, the Torus, and the Cone (with Alberto M\u00e1rquez, Kluwer, 2001) *Mati y sus mateaventuras: Hasta el infinito y m\u00e1s all\u00e1 (with , Espasa, 2013) *Las matem\u00e1ticas vigilan tu salud: Modelos sobre epidemias y vacunas (Mathematics watches your health, with Enrique F. Borja, Next Door Publishers, 2017), on the applications of mathematics in epidemiology and personal health *\u00a1Que las matem\u00e1ticas te acompa\u00f1en! (May mathematics be with you, Ariel, 2018) on the importance of mathematics in understanding the world ==References== ==External links== *Home page *Mati y sus mateaventuras, blog by Grima with Raquel Gu * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish mathematicians Category:Women mathematicians Category:Researchers in geometric algorithms Category:Mathematics popularizers Category:University of Seville alumni Category:University of Seville faculty ",
