From the 1960s into the '80s Faller produced the Auto Motor Sport (AMS) slot cars, based on existing patents, similar to the Aurora Model Motoring system. The Faller controller and the car had a small selenium rectifier on board so two cars could run independently on the same track on the positive or negative half wave AC. The cars were in 1:65 scale but could be used with the 1:87 H0 scale model railways. H0 scale autos with Faller Car System. Faller has a \"Car System\" in both the H0 and N scale, which consists of battery-powered road vehicles, made by other manufacturers such as Wiking, that have a magnet attached to the front steering. The magnet follows a steel wire hidden under the road surface, resulting in trucks and buses that behave in a realistic fashion without the need for guide rails. This system is extensively used by the Miniatur Wunderland (German for 'miniature wonderland') model railway attraction in Hamburg, Germany. Mechanisms are also available to stop vehicles and to switch them from one route to another, as at an intersection. These can be integrated with sensors and working traffic lights to create a realistic operating scene. In September 2013 Faller released their Digital Car System allowing computer control of the system. ==Amusement park fairground models== Faller has produced amusement park fairground models for over 20 years, with well over a hundred different models. Many have been discontinued as newer models have been introduced. Faller offers models in H0 scale and a limited number of amusement park fairground models in N scale as well. ==References== == External links == * Faller's official website Category:Model railroad manufacturers Category:German brands Category:Companies based in Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg Category:Model manufacturers of Germany ",
