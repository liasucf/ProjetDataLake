What is fascinating about Roy Kellino's adventure is that it was edited, with greater tautness than it deserves, by director-in-waiting David Lean. The casting is also noteworthy, with future Carry On star Esma Cannon in a rare glamour role, and Ballard Berkeley (who would later achieve fame as the Major in Fawlty Towers) playing the heroic lead.\"http://www.radiotimes.com/film/htc7h/the-last-adventurers ==References== ==External links== * Category:1937 films Category:1937 drama films Category:British films Category:British drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Roy Kellino Category:Seafaring films Category:Films about fishing Category:British black-and-white films ",
