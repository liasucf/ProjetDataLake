    "text": "MaryJanice Davidson (born August 1969) is an American author who writes mostly paranormal romance, but also young adult literature and non-fiction. She is the creator of the popular Undead series. She is both a New York Times and USA Today bestseller. She won a 2004 Romantic Times Reviewers\u2019 Choice Award and was nominated for the same award in 2005. Davidson lives in Minnesota with her husband and two children. She grew up on military bases and moved often, as she was the child of a United States Air Force soldier. Pamela Clare of USA Today wrote, \"It's Davidson's humor, combined with her innate storytelling ability and skill with dialogue, that has lifted her from small presses to the big best-seller lists.\" ==Bibliography== ===Undead series === Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Taylor turns thirty in the most unfortunate manner possible: she is laid off from work and then run down by an SUV. Waking up in the morgue fails to improve her mood, and when she discovers she can't kill herself, she gets downright belligerent. Being proclaimed \"Queen of the Vampires\" by the obnoxious Eric Sinclair, who places himself first in line to be her consort, proves to be the last straw. # Undead and Unwed (Berkley, 2004, ) # Undead and Unemployed (Berkley, 2004, ) # Undead and Unappreciated (Berkley, 2005, ) # Undead and Unreturnable (Berkley, 2005, hardback , paperback ) # Undead and Unpopular (Berkley, 2006, hardback , paperback ) # Undead and Uneasy (Berkley, 2007, ) # Undead and Unworthy (Berkley, 2008, ) # Undead and Unwelcome (Berkley, 2009, ) # Undead and Unfinished (Berkley, 2010, ) # Undead and Undermined (Berkley, 2011) # Undead and Unstable (Berkley June 2012) # Undead and Unsure (Berkley August 2013) # Undead and Underwater (Berkley May 2013) # Undead and Unwary (Berkley October 2014)http://fantasticfiction.co.uk # Undead and Unforgiven (Berkley October 2015) # Undead and Done (Berkley October 2016) The first four volumes have been reprinted as * Betsy the Vampire Queen () Books 5-7 and Dead and Loving It have been reprinted as * \"Betsy: Bride of the Vampire\" Short stories have also appeared in: * Cravings (Jove, 2004, ) * Bite (Jove, 2004, ) ===Wyndham Werewolves=== # Love's Prisoner (novella in Secrets 6, Red Sage Publishing, Inc., 2000, ) # Jared's Wolf (novella in Secrets 8, Red Sage Publishing, Inc., 2002, ) # Derik's Bane (Berkley, 2005, ) # Santa Claws (in Nicely Naughty, Loose-Id, 2004, , a revised version of Naughty but Nice) This short story was included in Dead and Loving It. # Speed Dating Werewolf Style Or, Ow, I Think You Broke The Bone (novella in Dead Over Heels, Berkley, 2008, ) # Wolf at the Door (Oct 2011) # Driftwood (Jan 2007) ===Alaskan Royals=== In an alternate reality, the series follows the royal Baranov family as they begin to look for love and marriage while ruling over Alaska (which was not purchased by the United States and became its own country).
