    "text": "Knot in 3D is a ZX Spectrum game by Malcolm Evans, originally published in 1983 by New Generation Software. It resembles a three-dimensional (i.e. with three degrees of freedom instead of only two) version of the Light cycles game from the film Tron. ==Gameplay== The game takes place in a 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 16 three- dimensional grid with the display being a first-person view of what the player can see in front of them. Initially empty, this space is filled up by the player (who constantly moves forward) leaving a trail behind them. There are a number of computer-controlled \"chasers\" doing the same thing who leave a differently coloured trail behind them. As the player and the chasers move through the grid, it becomes more and more densely filled, and therefore there is a greater likelihood of crashing into a trail and need to change direction to avoid the trails. ==Reception== CRASH magazine commented that it was hard to see how Knot worked at first, but described it as extraordinary and addictive. ZX Computing also said that Knot was initially confusing until the player is used to the perspective. The graphics were highlighted as some of the best fast-action colour graphics on the Spectrum. ==Accolades== In 1991 Your Sinclair magazine ranked the game 60th in their top 100 Spectrum games of all time. ==References== ==External links== * * NGS World -- a tribute homepage of the New Generation Software titles, created and maintained by Malcolm's daughter Rachel * CounterClockWise: A remake made in 2006 * Explanation of game Category:1983 video games Category:Action video games Category:Europe-exclusive video games Category:New Generation Software games Category:Snake video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:ZX Spectrum-only games ",
