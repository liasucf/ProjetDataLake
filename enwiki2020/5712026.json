    "text": "Fructosephosphates are sugar phosphates based upon fructose, and are common in the biochemistry of cells. Fructosephosphates play integral roles in many metabolic pathways, particularly glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway. The major biologically active fructosephosphates are: *Fructose 1-phosphate *Fructose 2-phosphate *Fructose 3-phosphate *Fructose 6-phosphate *Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate *Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate ==See also== * Fructose bisphosphatase ==References== ==External links== * * Pubchem - fructose-6-phosphate Category:Organophosphates ",
