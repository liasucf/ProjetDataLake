He is a midfielder currently playing for Kataller Toyama. == Personal life == He graduated with first-class honours in Sports Science from Fukuoka University. ==Career== ===Singapore=== He signed for Albirex Niigata FC (Singapore) from the S.League in 2016 after graduation from Fukuoka University. He was signed after Albirex Niigata Singapore chairman Daisuke Korenaga had watched a few of Inaba's games in his university tournaments and called him two weeks after to offer a contract. Inaba had a good season for the team as Albirex became the first team in Singapore to win all 4 trophies on offer in Singapore. He extended his contract for 2017, becoming only one of six players from last season to remain at the club. Inaba was handed the captaincy of the team for the 2017 S.League season. During the September international break, he was selected to participate in a week-long training stint with his parent club. He traveled to Niigata prefecture with defensive stalwart Yasutaka Yanagi and the duo trained with the first team, playing in a training match against Iwaki FC, a non-J League team. He made 24 appearances in the league and scored two goals as the team retained the S.League title. He also led the team to repeat last season's feat, as the team won all 4 trophies on offer again. ===Japan=== His stellar performances in the S.League saw Inaba secure a move back to Japan for the 2018 season, signing for J3 League side Kataller Toyama. ==Club career statistics== As of 31 October 2018.Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./\u65e5\u672c\u30b9\u30dd\u30fc\u30c4\u4f01\u753b\u51fa\u7248\u793e, \"J1&J2;&J3;\u9078\u624b\u540d\u9451\u30cf\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u7248 2018 (NSK MOOK)\", 7 February 2018, Japan, (p. 261 out of 289) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! colspan=3 | Club performance ! colspan=2 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup ! colspan=2 | League Cup ! colspan=2 | Total |- !
