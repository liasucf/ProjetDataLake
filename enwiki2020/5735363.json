    "text": "1914 Frontenac Frontenac Motor Corporation was a joint venture of automobile racing brothers Louis, Gaston, and Arthur Chevrolet. It was founded in 1914 in Indianapolis to build high-performance automobiles that would be used in the brothers' own pursuit of glory at the Indianapolis 500. An early investor was former world-class cyclist and Flint, Michigan-based industrialist Albert Champion, who left the venture soon after almost being beaten to death by Louis Chevrolet in an argument. Gaston Chevrolet won the 1920 Indianapolis 500 in a Frontenac, but died a few months later in a late-season race in Los Angeles in November 1920; he had already accumulated enough points to posthumously win the championship. In 1921, Frontenac won the Indy 500 again, this time at the hands of Tommy Milton, and the brothers' promising company entered into a deal with Stutz Motor Company. However, the deal quickly went wrong, and Frontenac Motors ended that year. ==Other uses== There is a private organization of collectors of early automobiles calling itself the Frontenac Motor Corporation that appears to have no connection to the 1914 company. ==References== ==External links== *Chevrolet Builds Fords retrieved Jan 31, 2012 *New York Times on the 1920 crash in which Gaston Chevrolet was killed *Library retrieved Jan 31, 2012 *1921 Indianapolis 500 statistics retrieved Jan 31, 2012 A Frontenac Motors ad Frontenac race car before the 1921 Indianapolis 500.
