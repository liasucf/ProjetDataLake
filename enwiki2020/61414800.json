    "text": "In quantum information theory and operator theory, the Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism refers to the correspondence between quantum channels (described by complete positive maps) and quantum states (described by density matrices), this is introduced by M. D. ChoiChoi, M. D. (1975). Completely positive linear maps on complex matrices. Linear algebra and its applications, 10(3), 285-290. and A. Jamio\u0142kowski.Jamio\u0142kowski, A. (1972). Linear transformations which preserve trace and positive semidefiniteness of operators. Reports on Mathematical Physics, 3(4), 275-278. It is also called channel-state duality by some authors in the quantum information area, but mathematically, this is a more general correspondence between positive operators and the complete positive superoperators. == Definition == To study a quantum channel \\mathcal{E} from system S to S', which is a trace-preserving complete positive map from operator spaces \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S) to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_{S'}), we introduce an auxiliary system A with the same dimension as system S. Consider the maximally entangled state : |\\Phi^+\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}|i\\rangle\\otimes|i\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}(|0\\rangle\\otimes|0\\rangle+\\cdots+|d-1\\rangle\\otimes|d-1\\rangle) in the space of \\mathcal{H}_A\\otimes\\mathcal{H}_S, since \\mathcal{E}is complete positive, I\\otimes \\mathcal{E}(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|) is a nonnegative operator. Conversely, for any nonnegative operator on \\mathcal{H}_A\\otimes\\mathcal{H}_{S'}, we can associate a complete positive map from \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S)to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_{S'}), this kind of correspondece is called Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. == References == Category:Quantum information theory ",
