    "text": "France was represented by Dominique Walter, with the song '\"Chez nous\", at the 1966 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 5 March in Luxembourg City. The song was chosen internally by broadcaster ORTF. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Walter performed 15th in the running order, following Italy and preceding the Netherlands. \"Chez nous\" is generally considered the weakest French entry of the 1960s, and at the close of voting had picked up only 1 point (from Monaco), placing France 16th of the 18 entries - a result which was greeted domestically with some consternation as it was the first time in Eurovision history that France had failed to place in the top 5. The French jury awarded its maximum vote of 5 to Ireland.ESC History - France 1966 ==See also== *France in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1966 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1966 Category:France in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1966 in France ",
