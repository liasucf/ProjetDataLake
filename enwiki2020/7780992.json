It is located in the Belgrade's municipality of Palilula. ==Location== Padinska Skela is located in the northern, Banat section of the municipality, 15 kilometers north of downtown Belgrade, on the Zrenjaninski put road which connects Belgrade with the town of Zrenjanin, in Vojvodina. It is built right in the middle of the Pan\u010deva\u010dki Rit, major floodplain between the rivers of Danube and Tami\u0161. ==History== In the early 20th century, Slovak cattle-breeders from the village of Padina were taking land in Pan\u010deva\u010dki Rit on lease. As the area was a marshland, to reach their land they had to use flatboats (in Serbian skela), thus giving the name to the area (Padinska Skela = Padina\u2019s Flatboat). Few short streets in the middle of the large marsh existed prior to 1944. They were sparsely inhabited by the Germans, Ruthenians and Czechs. The settlement originates from the late 1940s when melioration of Pan\u010deva\u010dki Rit began. The settlement became important immediately, being in the center of the area which was turned from marshy floodplain into a very fertile arable land for the PKB company. While other parts of the country lacked many communal and modern infrastructure, Padinska Skela soon had elementary school, kindergarten, sports clubs, ambulance and cinema. During the period of colonization (\u201eThe 8th offensive\u201c), it was mostly populated with the settlers from the South Serbia (Vranje, Surdulica), Bosnian Krajina and, to the lesser extent, from the Ra\u0161ka. It was part of the municipality of Bor\u010da until May 30, 1952, when it became seat of its own municipality. In 1955 it merged into the municipality of Krnja\u010da which, in turn, became part of the municipality of Palilula in 1965. ==Demographics== Originally the settlement grew slowly, as many smaller settlements were scattered all over the Pan\u010deva\u010dki Rit, growing around the solitary and outer farms. In the 1970s however, most of those settlements were administratively merged into the central one, Padinska Skela, even though some of them are kilometers away from it and separated by vast fields.
