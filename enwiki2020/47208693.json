    "text": "Ch\u00e2teau Revenge! is the third album by the Silver Seas. It was self-released by the band in North America in 2010 and, through a distribution deal with the Lights Label/EMI, in Europe the following year. \"The idea was to make a soundtrack to learning about the world of adult emotions, or romance, through the prism of television and movies,\" said Silver Seas frontman Daniel Tashian in a press release. \"So I thought, 'Ch\u00e2teau Revenge!' It sounds like a movie I would have loved as a kid, and it would be a story of guy meets girl, guy meets bully, bully gets girl, guy fights bully, bully loses, guy gets girl back. But I lost track somewhere in the middle and it became more autobiographical. Sort of a composite of my own failed relationships, which are where you really learn. And it has some redemption in the end, and resolution, the way a real Hollywood ending should be.\" ==Track listing== All songs written by Daniel Tashian, except where noted. # \"Another Bad Night's Sleep\" (Tashian, Angelo Petraglia) \u2013 3:11 # \"Jane\" \u2013 3:52 # \"The Best Things in Life\" (Tashian, Jason Lehning, Carey Ott) \u2013 3:47 # \"What's the Drawback?\" (Tashian, Lehning) \u2013 3:28 # \"Somebody Said Your Name\" \u2013 2:58 # \"Home & Dry\" \u2013 2:49 # \"From My Windowsill\" \u2013 3:08 # \"Candy\" \u2013 2:49 # \"What If It Isn't Out There?\" (Tashian, Ott) \u2013 4:29 # \"Help Is On the Way\" \u2013 4:15 # \"Those Streets\" (Tashian, Ott) \u2013 3:13 # \"Kid\" \u2013 3:35 ==Personnel== * Chris Carmichael: strings (tracks: 3, 9, 12) * John Deaderick: piano (10), synthesizer (7) * Madi Diaz: backing vocals (2, 6 to 8, 10) * Caitlin Evanson: strings (4, 7, 10, 12) * David Gehrke: backing vocals (2, 5), drums, percussion (1 to 10) * Greg Goodman: sound design (track: 9, 10) * Luke Hebert: percussion (5) * Rachel Huesenstamm: handclaps (5) * Brad Jones: handclaps (3), string arrangement (3, 12) * Jason Lehning: backing vocals (1, 6, 7, 12), electric guitar (1, 3, 8), electric piano (1, 2, 4 to 7, 9 to 12), synthesizer (12) * Lex Price: acoustic guitar (8, 12), bass, mandolin (6) * Daniel Tashian: acoustic guitar (1, 2, 4 to 6, 11), banjo (6), bongos (4), drum machine (2, 3, 9), electric guitar (1 to 5, 7 to 11), electric piano (3), lap steel guitar (1), lead vocals, string arrangement (7), strings synthesizer (6), vibraphone (10), xylophone (8) * Jonathan Trebing: lap steel guitar (10) ==Production notes== Recorded at the Toy Box Studio in Nashville, Tenn.; additional recording at Alex the Great Recording and Jason Lehning and Daniel Tashian's respective studios.
