The founders of Arbetets kvinnor felt that gender oppression and class oppression functioned side by side, and that the women's movement could not ignore the class struggle. The organization published R\u00f6dh\u00e4ttan. The last issue was published in 1981. Some of the activists who had worked with R\u00f6dh\u00e4ttan would later work with Kvinnotidningen Q (which was published until 1986). ==References== Category:Feminist organizations in Sweden Category:Feminism and social class Category:Socialist feminist organizations Category:1973 in women's history ",
