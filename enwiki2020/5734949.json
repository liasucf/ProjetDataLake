Illinois law requires that, when a firearm is sold by a Federal Firearms License (FFL) holder, or at a gun show, the seller perform a dial-up inquiry to the State Police to verify that the buyer's FOID card is valid. This additional check is known as the Firearm Transfer Inquiry Program (FTIP).Illinois Administrative Code Part 1235 \u2014 Firearm Transfer Inquiry ProgramIllinois General Assembly \u2014 Public Act 094-0353, amending the Firearm Owners Identification Card Act to require FTIP checks at gun shows, effective July 29, 2005 At the time of the inquiry, the police perform an automated search of several criminal and mental health databases, including the federal NICS database. (Generally, FFLs in all states must request a background check through the NICS before selling a firearm; however in some states non-FFL purchasers who possess certain state-issued firearms permits, e.g., a permit to carry a concealed handgun, may purchase firearms from FFLs without undergoing a point-of-sale NICS check.)\"Guide to the National Instant Check System\", National Rifle Association, July 16, 1999.

On February 14, 2018, in a ruling that applies only to the defendant, a circuit court in Illinois found that the requirement to obtain a FOID in order to acquire or possess a firearm is unconstitutional. The court ruled that \"to require the defendant to fill out a form, provide a picture ID and pay a $10 fee to obtain a FOID card before she can exercise her constitutional right to self-defense with a firearm is a violation of the Second Amendment... and a violation of Article I, Section 22, of the Constitution of the State of Illinois.\" After the state requested reconsideration, the court ruled on October 16, 2018 that, in addition to reaffirming its previous ruling, the requirement to physically possess a FOID while in possession of a firearm is also unconstitutional. The case, People v. Brown, was appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court. On April 2, 2020, the court remanded the lower court's ruling. ==See also== *Gun laws in Illinois ==Notes== Category:1968 in law Category:Illinois law Category:United States firearms law ",
