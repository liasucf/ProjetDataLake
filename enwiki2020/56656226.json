The film is a remake of Ray Taylor's Panamint's Bad Man (1938). Filmed at the Corriganville Movie Ranch, the film is neither set on a frontier nor is any revenge depicted. Extensive footage from this film was reused along with the return of Duce Rago in The Black Lash (1952). ==Plot== Marshal Lash and Deputy Fuzzy impersonate an outlaw duo from Texas named the Dawsons in order to stop a series of robberies.
