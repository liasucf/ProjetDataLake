Blood debuted in FCW on February 18, 2010, under the ring name Richie Steamboat and lost to Heath Slater in his first match for the promotion. His first victory in FCW came at the television taping on February 25, when he defeated Donny Marlow. He went on to wrestle against Derrick Bateman, Wade Barrett, Curt Hawkins, Alex Riley, and Johnny Curtis, before suffering a torn Posterior cruciate ligament in March, which sidelined him for several months. Following his return, he teamed with his father to defeat The Dudebusters of Trent Baretta and Caylen Croft on June 20. In August, he unsuccessfully challenged Mason Ryan for the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship.

In December 2010, Steamboat formed a tag team with Seth Rollins, with the pair defeating Jacob Novak and Mahal in their first match as a team. On January 6, 2011, Steamboat and Rollins challenged Titus O'Neill and Damien Sandow for the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful. At the Miami-Dade County Fair on March 25, Steamboat and Rollins defeated O'Neill and Sandow to win the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship. They held the championship until May 12, when they dropped it to the team of Calvin Raines and Big E. Langston. In late 2011, Steamboat interfered in a fatal four-way match for the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship, and accidentally superkicked Husky Harris. On the following episode of FCW television, Steamboat began a heel turn when he attacked Harris again, after finding him standing over Aksana, and believing Harris had attacked her. As a result, Steamboat and Harris began feuding, with their first match ending in a no contest. Leo Kruger later defeated the pair in a triple threat match to retain the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship, and the following week, Steamboat lost to Harris in a No Hold Barred match. After the pair continued to attack each other backstage and during matches, both men were suspended for 30 days. Upon their return, Steamboat lost to Harris in a Bullrope match to end their feud. On January 13, 2012, at the FCW television taping, Steamboat defeated Damien Sandow by two falls to one to win the FCW Jack Brisco 15 Championship. On July 20, 2012, at a live event, Steamboat defeated Rick Victor to win the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship. He was the final FCW champion. In mid-2012, WWE rebranded FCW into NXT. In June, Steamboat debuted for NXT at the inaugural taping from Full Sail University, defeating both Rick Victor and Leo Kruger in separate matches. The latter match was a quarter-final in the Gold Rush tournament to determine the inaugural NXT Champion. On the August 15 episode of NXT, Steamboat was eliminated by Jinder Mahal in the semi-finals. Steamboat then started a feud with Kassius Ohno; Steamboat defeated Ohno twice, but Ohno conducted successful post-match assaults on Steamboat. Ohno then injured and pinned Steamboat during a six-man tag match while teaming with the Ascension against Steamboat and the Usos on the October 17 episode of NXT. Steamboat returned from injury and decisively pinned Ohno on the November 21, 2012 episode of NXT to end the feud. This was his final televised match after suffering a back injury for which he required surgery. More than a year later in December 2013, it was reported Blood had been released from his WWE contract. This was contradicted by later reports, which stated he remained under contract. However, in April 2015, his father stated that due to the injury and subsequent surgery, he would be unable to wrestle again. == Personal life == Blood also raced Legend Cars and Bandoleros under his ring name for several years at Charlotte Motor Speedway in the annual Summer Shootout Series.http://www.charlottemotorspeedway.com/fans/news/speedway/643078.html == Championships and accomplishments == *Exodus Wrestling Alliance **EWA Florida Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **EWA Georgia Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **EWA Missouri Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Florida Championship Wrestling **FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **FCW Jack Brisco 15 Championship (1 time) **FCW Florida Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Seth Rollins **Second FCW Grand Slam *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI ranked him 99 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2012 == References == == External links == * Category:1987 births Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:American people of English descent Category:American sportspeople of Japanese descent Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Charlotte, North Carolina Category:Professional wrestlers from North Carolina ",
