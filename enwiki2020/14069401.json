    "text": "Jail Bait is a 1937 American short comedy film starring Buster Keaton. ==Plot== Following a kidnapping and murder, a reporter believes he knows the identity of the murderer, so he asks his roommate, a newspaper boy, to confess to the crime, in order to throw the police off the actual murderer's trail \u2013 giving the reporter time to catch the murderer and claim the reward for himself. The newspaper boy is at first reluctant, but then agrees with the condition that his half of the reward be large enough to purchase a ring he wants. Having gotten himself arrested, the newspaper boy learns that his roommate's plane has crashed, killing him and leaving the newspaper boy trapped in a death sentence for a crime he did not commit. Following a prison break, the newspaper boy finds himself in the hideout of the man, Sawed-off Madison, responsible for the crimes he falsely confessed to. A shoot-out ensues, allowing both the actual murderer and the newspaper boy to escape. Back at the police station it is discovered that the newspaper boy did not commit the murder, and the police know it was Madison. At this time, the newspaper boy carries Sawed-off Madison into the station and claims the reward for his capture. The newspaper boy buys the ring he wanted. ==Cast== * Buster Keaton * Harold Goodwin * Bud Jamison * Matthew Betz * Betty Andr\u00e9 * Stanley Blystone as Arresting officer (uncredited) * Bobby Burns as Warden (uncredited) * Allan Cavan as Desk Sergeant (uncredited) * Harry Tenbrook as Prison guard (uncredited) ==See also== * Buster Keaton filmography ==External links== * * Jail Bait at the International Buster Keaton Society Category:1937 films Category:1937 comedy films Category:1937 short films Category:American films Category:American comedy films Category:Educational Pictures short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Charles Lamont Category:Comedy short films ",
