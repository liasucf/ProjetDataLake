    "text": "The Alb is a river in the Northern Black Forest in Germany. It is a tributary of the Rhine, and flows through the cities of Karlsruhe, Ettlingen and Bad Herrenalb. ==Geography== The river Alb begins about from Bad Herrenalb. From its source it flows north through Bad Herrenalb, Frauenalb and Marxzell. There it takes the waters of the Maisenbach creek as a right tributary. The river Moosalb is a left tributary at Fischweier on the border between the municipalities of Marxzell and Karlsbad. Near Busenbach the Alb turns to the northwest. Out of Ettlingen, the Alb leaves the Black Forest and reaches the Upper Rhine Plain. After flowing through Ettlingen it turns north again. The river passes the Karlsruhe city district of R\u00fcppurr, flows under the Federal Road no. 10 and then follows this highway to the northwest. Afterwards the Alb flows through the so-called G\u00fcnther Klotz Facilities in the southern part of Karlsruhe \u2013 partially being the district border between Bulach and Beiertheim \u2013 and thereby forms the core of a popular local recreation area. The Karlsruhe district of Daxlanden is then passed through in a great loop and the river reaches the Appenm\u00fchle barrage where the Karlsruhe city works operate a hydroelectric power station since the year 2000. After that the Alb flows around the ports at the river Rhine in M\u00fchlburg. In Knielingen, the river turns north-northeast, approximately parallel to the Rhine, and flows through the MiRO oil refinery in a canal. Eventually the Alb reaches the floodplains of the Rhine at Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen and discharges into the Rhine. Shortly before emptying into the Rhine, it is joined to the right side by the relief canal of the river Pfinz. == Literature == * * * * ==References== Category:Rivers of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Category:Rivers of the Black Forest Category:Rivers of Germany ",
