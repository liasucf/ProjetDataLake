The youngest son of Richard Hancock and Margaret n\u00e9e Harris, Handcock was at some point a captain in the 44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot. Handcock was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Athlone at a by-election in 1856\u2014caused by the appointment of the sitting MP, William Keogh, as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas\u2014but lost the seat less than a year later at the 1857 general election, when he was beaten by the Independent Irish Party candidate, John Ennis. Handcock died little under a year later while hunting tigers in India. A report on his death, published by The Morning Chronicle, described the incident, where \"the enraged animal\" caused such injuries that he died within an hour, as the \"most melancholy circumstances\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:1834 births Category:1858 deaths Category:Irish Conservative Party MPs Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Athlone Category:UK MPs 1852\u20131857 ",
