    "text": "Sandro Raniere Guimar\u00e3es Cordeiro (born 15 March 1989), or simply Sandro, is a Brazilian footballer, who plays as a midfielder for Goi\u00e1s. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Sandro is a product of Internacional's youth academy. He signed his first professional contract and began his senior career in 2007 as an 18-year-old. Sandro was one of the main players of Inter's winning 2010 Copa Libertadores campaign. Sandro was already signed to Tottenham through most of the competition, but that did not affect his performance negatively: on the contrary, he said he \"live[d] with great intensity, as each game could be the last\". With this in mind, he worked hard to stay at Internacional as long as possible in order to help the team reach the finals. After winning South America's top trophy, he flew to England the following week. ===Tottenham Hotspur=== In August 2009 Tottenham Hotspur were reported to have had a \u00a314 million bid rejected for the player. However, on 20 October 2009, Spurs and Internacional agreed an affiliation of the two clubs, ensuring that Tottenham have first option on all academy players from the Brazilian outfit. Six days later Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp confirmed he was interested in Sandro for a fee rumoured to be around \u00a38 million. On 10 March 2010, Internacional President Vitorio Piffero confirmed the transfer of the midfielder to Tottenham, after the Copa Libertadores. The transfer amount was speculated to be around \u20ac10 million, with only the contract yet to be signed. Both Internacional and Tottenham reported on their respective websites that a deal had been agreed for Sandro for an undisclosed fee. Sandro joined Tottenham following the end of the Copa Libertadores, which finished on 18 August. Internacional's financial report stated that the fee was R$ 20,633,850, with about 25% re-distributed by Inter to third party owners. Tottenham Hotspur confirmed that a deal for Sandro had been completed and that he would join up at the end of Internacional's Copa Libertadores campaign. Sandro said of the move to England that he thought Spurs were \"a great fit for me\" and that \"a club that is growing every year makes it the ideal club for me\". He made his Tottenham debut in a 4\u20131 home defeat against Arsenal in the third round of the League Cup on 21 September 2010. On 9 January 2011, Sandro made a start against League One side Charlton Athletic, assisting Andros Townsend and playing the full match. He made his UEFA Champions League debut for Tottenham on 15 February 2011 at the San Siro against seven times winners A.C. Milan, receiving special praise from manager Harry Redknapp in his side's 1\u20130 win. Playing a pivotal role just in front of the back four, he was man of the match in the return leg at White Hart Lane. He scored his first goal for the club against Chelsea with a 35-yard volley in a 2\u20131 defeat. Sandro signed a new five-year contract with Tottenham on 8 September 2011, a deal which would have run till 2016. In January 2013, Sandro picked up a knee injury during the game against Queens Park Rangers. After the game it was announced that Sandro would be out for the remainder of the 2012\u201313 season. Prior to the game, after a run of impressive performances Sandro has been affectionately nicknamed 'Beast' by the Tottenham fans. He scored his third goal in Tottenham colours in December 2013 against Manchester United, with a powerful shot from into the top corner described by opponent Wayne Rooney as \"a great strike\". ===Queens Park Rangers=== On 1 September 2014, Sandro signed for Queens Park Rangers for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut against Manchester United, coming off injured and replaced by Karl Henry. He scored his first goal for QPR against former club Tottenham on 7 March 2015. On 29 January 2016, Sandro signed for West Brom on loan. He made his debut in the 1\u20131 draw with Swansea City. ===Antalyaspor=== On 11 January 2017, Sandro signed for Turkish club Antalyaspor on a three-year deal. On 10 January 2018, Sandro signed with a loan contract with Benevento until 30 June 2018. He made his debut on 28 January 2018 in 3\u20130 away loss against Torino. He scored his first goal for Benevento during his 4th match by scoring the 1-1 goal in a 3\u20132 home win against Crotone. ===Genoa=== On 3 July 2018, Sandro signed a contract with Italian club Genoa. His contract with Genoa has been terminated in early 2020 after he didn't appear in any games for the club in the 2019\u201320 season. ===Udinese=== On 31 January 2019, Sandro joined Udinese on loan for the remainder of the 2018\u201319 season. ===Goi\u00e1s=== On 18 January 2020, he joined Goi\u00e1s. ==International career== Scotland in March 2011 Having represented Brazil at Under-20 level, and captaining them at the 2009 South American Youth Championship, Sandro made his full debut for the Brazilian national team as a substitute in a World Cup qualifier against Chile on 9 September 2009.
