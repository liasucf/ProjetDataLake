    "text": "John D. Craig (1903\u20131997) was an American businessman, writer, soldier, diver, Hollywood stunt man, film producer, and television host. He worked in the commercial surface-supplied diving industry from the 1930s on, and filmed aerial combat over Europe during World War II. He is best known for using film and television to show the United States public the beauties and dangers of Earth's underwater worlds. ==Early life== John D. Craig was born 28 April 1903 in Cincinnati, Ohiohttps://www.fold3.com/image/654214997; WW2 era Selective Service card, completed 15 Feb 1942., one of five sons of a Scots immigrant John Craig. His father was born in Dalry, Scotland in 1868. Because the younger Craig was not given a middle name, he used \"D.\" to create a stage name. He took the \"D\" from his youngest brother David, born in 1914. John Craig's older brother Tom was born in New York in 1901. The Craig family moved to Long Beach, California, where the boys spent formative years. In the early 1920s, the younger John Craig made his fortune investing in oil wells at Signal Hill, which were successful. They gave him the resources for extensive travel and an independent life. From the mid-1920s through the early 1930s, Craig traveled throughout Asia and Africa, with many harrowing adventures, which he described in his 1938 memoir, Danger Is My Business. On the Pacific Ocean, he and his companions narrowly escaped with their lives when they came across a large band of drug smugglers. In China, when he and his friends were trying to trap tigers, Craig nearly died after being attacked by a tiger that climbed the tree in which he was supposedly safe.Craig, John D. \"The World's Most Dangerous Job\", POPULAR MECHANICS, Jun 1936, p. 866 In Timbuktu, he and his friends were suspected by the military of being spies from the French Foreign Legion, and almost arrested. ==Diving career== In 1931, John D. Craig was hired by a Hollywood studio to travel to Cedros Island off the southwestern coast of Baja California, Mexico, to film the sargassum farming industry established by expatriate Japanese. He was surprised to find that the farms were deep underwater on the seabed.John D. Craig, \"Deep Diving Is Dangerous, But...\", The Rotarian, February 1938, p. 22 Because he and his crew were ill-equipped for deep-water diving (having only oxygen masks and goggles), Craig had to learn \"hard-hat\" diving from the Japanese \"sargassa\" farmers, who used decades-old diving equipment. For the next five years, while living on the Pacific coast, Craig worked on modernizing that equipment. At the same time, he hired on as a stunt diver for several movies, notably those of film director W. S. Van Dyke.John D. Craig, \"Diving Among Sea Killers\", Popular Mechanics, April 1936, pp. 508-511 In 1936, Craig traveled to Great Britain and Ireland to prepare for underwater filming of an attempt to recover cargo (including possible gold bullion) that had gone down with the RMS Lusitania when it was sunk near the Irish coast in 1915. In 1935, a single British diver had managed to walk the decks of the sunken ship, so, such a salvage operation was considered feasible. But, after several trial runs, the intense sea currents and the cumbersome nature of the half-ton diving suit caused the plans for filming and salvage operations to be abandoned.Teale, Edwin. \"New Worlds Beneath the Sea\", Popular Science, October 1937, p. 29 Taylor, Larry \"Harris\", PhD. \"Diving With Gas Mixtures Other Than Air\" (Helium subsection), Brief History of Mixed Gas Diving website\"The Lusitania and John D. Craig\" , Tom Whitely Website While gathering resources for the Lusitania dive, Craig worked extensively with the deep-sea diving expert Max Gene Nohl to perfect the equipment needed for such a deep-sea task. They did much testing in the Great Lakes of the United States. In 1937, Craig, Nohl, the diver Jack Browne, and Edgar End, M.D., co-founded the deep-sea diving equipment company, Diving Equipment and Salvage Company, in Wisconsin. It is now known as DESCO. Craig also participated in scientific research to determine the best mixture of gases for deep sea \"hardhat\" diving.\"History of DESCO\" , DESCO Corporation website -- the result was a variation of heliox, a mixture of oxygen and helium that enabled divers to avoid the occupational hazard of nitrogen narcosis. In 1938, Craig was part of a salvage team that unsuccessfully tried to find the Mexican crown jewels in a shipwreck off the Virginia coast. He continued to dive and explore the seas of the world throughout his life. In 1960, he worked with the US Navy on underwater sound research. ==Military career== Craig served as an officer in the U. S. Army Air Corps during World War II, in which he specialized in aerial photography. Commissioned as a captain, on April 1, 1942 he appeared on one of the first live television programs commercially broadcast in the United States, WNBT's \"Thrills and Chills Everywhere\", which presented \"dramatizations of some hair- raising experience of an explorer or adventurer.\"\"Thrills and Chills Everywhere\", Status Guide: Television Obscurities website In 1943, Craig headed the 9th Combat Camera Unit of the 6th Air Defence Group in Europe (stationed in Cairo, Egypt). He supplied aerial footage to Hollywood's First Motion Picture Unit, which had been formed in 1942 as the 18th Air Force Base Unit of the U.S. Army Air Corps.\"First Motion Picture Unit\", Magic Lantern Video and Book Store Website In 1944 after being promoted to Major, Craig was transferred with his film unit to England to document the D-Day invasion. He flew more than 35 missions in Europe and Africa, and aided in the aerial photography of the Ploesti Raid in 1944. (Some of his B-17 footage was reportedly used in the movie Twelve O'Clock High (1949), and again in the TV series of the same name. Wounded in action late in the war at Remagen Bridge in Germany, Craig was awarded the Purple Heart -- he was also awarded the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with four oak- leaf clusters, and the Distinguished Unit Citation with three clusters for his achievements.Google News Archive: \"Dinner Club Will Hear Film Photog\", Spokane Spokesman-Review, September 21, 1951, p. 12 By the end of his military service, Craig had been promoted to Lt. Colonel, a rank he used as a title for the rest of his life. After the end of the war, Craig visually documented the atomic bomb test site at Bikini Atoll in 1946.Joswick, Jerry & Keating, Lawrence (1961) \"Combat Cameraman\", Chilton Company, pp. vii-viii (Foreword by Lt.
