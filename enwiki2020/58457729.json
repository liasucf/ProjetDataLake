    "text": "The House at 4305 South Linden Road is a single-family home located in Flint, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. This house is a two-story frame Queen Anne-style structure, likely constructed in 1878. It has a typical Queen Anne irregular massing, but the exterior contains decidedly Gothic ornamentation. The front has a wraparound porch supported by delicately turned posts, and is decorated with brackets, pendants, and vergeboards resembling icicles. The roof gable ends on the house contain similar lacy vergeboards. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Genesee County, Michigan Category:Queen Anne architecture in Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1878 Category:Buildings and structures in Flint, Michigan Category:Houses in Genesee County, Michigan Category:1878 establishments in Michigan ",
