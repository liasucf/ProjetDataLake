    "text": "TSA PreCheck logo TSA PreCheck (branded as TSA Pre\u2713) is a Trusted Traveler program initiated in October 2011 and administered by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration that allows selected members of select frequent flyer programs, members of Global Entry, NEXUS, and SENTRI, members of the US military, and cadets and midshipmen of the United States service academies to receive expedited screening for domestic and select international itineraries. As of March 2019, this program was available at more than 200 airports. After completing a background check, being fingerprinted, and paying an $85 fee, travelers will get a Known Traveler Number. TSA does not issue an ID card like Global Entry, NEXUS, and SENTRI do. Travelers are notified if they have PreCheck by having a indicator printed on their boarding pass that may say \"TSAPRECHK\", \"TSA PRE\", or \"TSA Pre\u2713\u00ae\" depending on the airline and type of boarding pass. The program has led to complaints of unfairness and longer wait lines. TSA says that PreCheck is not guaranteed every flight, as passengers are subject to random exclusions. Furthermore, passengers may be disqualified or suspended from PreCheck for violations of federal transportation security regulations. The TSA maintains a list of credit card issuers and loyalty programs that reimburse members' TSA PreCheck or Global Entry application fees. == Participating airlines == As of December 2019, a total of 73 airlines were participating in the program. == References == Category:Transportation Security Administration Category:United States Department of Homeland Security ",
