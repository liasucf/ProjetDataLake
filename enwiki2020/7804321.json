    "text": "The Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA) was a sports association which existed in Manila, Philippines from 1938 to 1981. Throughout its existence, it staged various sports and was participated by prominent Philippine companies. After World War II, its basketball tournament became the country's premier basketball league until 1975, when nine of its members broke away to form the very first professional basketball league in Asia, the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). Afterwards, it would continue as a farm league of sorts for the PBA until the league closed down before the end of 1981. ==MICAA basketball champions== *Old records says the pre-war MICAA champions were Heacock's (1938) and the Manila Ports Terminal (1939). The Terminal would win three straight titles a decade later from 1948\u20131950.
