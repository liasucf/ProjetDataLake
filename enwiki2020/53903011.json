    "text": "The FX5 was a Honeywell 6,000lb-thrust (27kN) geared turbofan based on a technology demonstrator core, aiming for a 20%-plus reduction in cost of ownership from the TFE731-60 and to span a family, it could have been certificated within 36 months. It was proposed for the Dassault Falcon 7X business jet launched in 2001, but the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW307 was finally selected. The Honeywell range comprises the previous Lycoming ALF502/Honeywell LF507 and the subsequent Honeywell HTF7000. ==References== FX5 Category:High-bypass turbofan engines Category:Geared turbofan engines ",
