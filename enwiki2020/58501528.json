    "text": "Riviera Hotel is a 20th-century hotel, located at Bowleaze Cove, Weymouth, Dorset, England. Opened in 1937, the hotel has been Grade II listed since January 1997. In their survey of the building, English Heritage commented that it \"epitomises the austere approach of the modernists in the immediate pre-war era, and suggests the designer's acquaintance with contemporary work in Rome and elsewhere\". ==History== The Riviera Hotel was built in 1936\u20131937 for a cost of around \u00a340,000. It was designed in a modernist, Spanish-style by L. Stewart Smith and constructed by Truscon Ltd. Overlooking Weymouth Bay, the hotel was sited at Bowleaze Cove, which until that time had seen little development. As car ownership increased during the 20th century, the cove was transformed into a holiday destination. In addition to the hotel, the Waterside Caravan Camp was established nearby in the 1950s, followed by other sites offering similar accommodation in the vicinity.https://content.historicengland.org.uk/images- books/publications/weymouths-seaside-heritage/weymouths-seaside-heritage.pdf/ In 1958, the hotel was taken over by Fred Pontin and remained under his holiday camp chain Pontins until 2000. Later in 2009, the hotel was sold for \u00a33.5 million to Saudi Arabian investors. It then underwent a \u00a34 million refit in 2011 and reopened in 2012. A new refurbishment project commenced in 2017. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Weymouth, Dorset Category:Grade II listed buildings in Dorset Category:Hotels in Dorset Category:Grade II listed hotels ",
