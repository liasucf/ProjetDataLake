    "text": "Abel de Lima Salazar (July 19, 1889, Guimar\u00e3es - December 29, 1946, Lisbon), was a Portuguese physician, lecturer, researcher, writer and painter who worked and lived in Porto. He was the son of Adolfo Barroso Pereira Salazar (Guimar\u00e3es, October 20, 1858 - Porto, January 1, 1941) and wife Adelaide da Luz da Silva e Lima (- Porto, October 3, 1929). Founded in 1975, the Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Biom\u00e9dicas Abel Salazar (in English Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute), a research center and biosciences school of the University of Porto, was named after him. He was an anti-fascist and his painting with his social references anticipates the neo-realist movement in the Portuguese painting. He was not related to Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar, the Portuguese dictator. ==Biography== ===Life=== ===Work=== ====Scientific work==== ====Artistic work==== =====Drawings===== =====Paintings and sculpture===== ====Literary and philosophical work==== ==Museum== ==Bibliography== ==External links== *Abel Salazar's Museum Virtual Tour *Abel Salazar in Vidas Lus\u00f3fonas *Casa Museu Abel Salazar Category:1889 births Category:1946 deaths Category:People from Guimar\u00e3es Category:Portuguese scientists Category:Portuguese artists Category:Portuguese male writers Category:Portuguese anti-fascists Category:University of Porto alumni Category:20th-century Portuguese painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Portuguese male painters ",
