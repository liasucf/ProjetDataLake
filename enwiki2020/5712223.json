    "text": "The prairie earless lizard or eastern earless lizard (Holbrookia maculata perspicua) is a subspecies of the lesser earless lizard, (Holbrookia maculata). ==Geographic range== Holbrookia maculata perspicua is endemic to the prairies of the central United States from South Dakota in the north, as far south as Texas. == Description == The prairie earless lizard is an overall gray-brown in color, with rows of dark blotches on either side of the back, with a light colored stripe down the middle. The males have black and white diagonal markings just before their hind legs, which typically females lack. They grow from 4.5 to 6 inches in length, and like all earless lizards, they have no external ear openings. As their range overlaps with other subspecies of H. maculata, distinguishing them can be difficult. == Behavior == Like all earless lizards, the prairie earless lizard is diurnal and insectivorous. They are often seen basking themselves on rocks, but will flee quickly if approached. == References == * *Herps of Texas: Holbrookia maculata Category:Phrynosomatidae Category:Fauna of the Plains-Midwest (United States) ",
