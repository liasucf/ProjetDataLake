In 1947, Dr. J. Williams and Moses staked 11 claims, which became the Lake Superior Mining Corporation. However, not much development took place until 1979, when Don and David McKinnon, along with John Larche, staked claims in Hemlo and the Manitouwadge area. The Williams Mine started operation in 1985, and produced 445,320 ounces of gold from a 2.45 meter wide ore body. The Golden Giant Mine produced 446,858 ounces in 1994 from a quartz sericite schist host rock. The David Bell Mines produced 204,251 ounces in 1994. The Hemlo gold mines had produced more than 6,000,000 ounces of gold by 1992. ==See also== *List of townships in Ontario *Matachewan, Ontario *Cobalt silver rush *Porcupine Gold Rush *Red Lake, Ontario *Greenstone, Ontario ==References== Category:Geography of Thunder Bay District Thunder Bay ",
