    "text": "Amarna letter EA11 is a letter of correspondence to Akhenaten of Egypt from the king of Babylon, Burna-Buriash II. The tablet onto which letter EA11 is inscribed is badly damaged. The letter content suggests of the place Amarna having experienced an epidemic of some kind of plague. The letter (together with letter EA10) seems to undoubtedly indicate that Akhenaten married his daughters Meritaten and Ankhesenpaaten at a time when they were both 11 of 12 years of age. Meritaten is described as the mistress of the royal house within the text.J.P.Allen - Causing His Name To Live: Studies in Egyptian Epigraphy and History in Memory of William J.
