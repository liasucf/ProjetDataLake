    "text": "Pandanus laxespicatus is a screwpine or pandan of the wetlands of Madagascar, and belonging to the monocot family Pandanaceae. It was of fairly recent discovery, having been unknown to science prior to 1951 when described by Martelli and Pichi-Sermolli.U. Martelli and R.E.G. Pichi-Sermolli, \"Les Pandanacees Recoltees par Henri Perrier de la Bathie a Madagascar\", MEM. INST. SCIENT. MADAG. - SERIES \"B\" Vol. 3 # 1 (1951). For the next seventeen years, it was just another member of a large family, but in 1968 Dr. Benjamin C. Stone discovered that at a certain stage of its growth it produces the longest linear (ribbon-like) leaves of any known plant; up to 33 feet (10 meters) in length while only fourteen inches (35 cm) in width.Dr. Benjamin C. Stone, \"Observations on Pandanus in Madagascar\", BOT. JOURNAL LINNEAN SOCIETY of LONDON Vol. 63 (1970) p. 123. And confirmed in correspondence from Dr. Benjamin C. Stone, Reader in Botany , University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ==References== laxespicatus ",
