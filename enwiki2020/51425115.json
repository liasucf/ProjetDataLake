Title ! style=\"width:12em;\" | Original air date |- |} ==Note== ==Reception== Anime News Network had five editors review the first episode of the anime: Rebecca Silverman was critical of Hinako's scarecrow act feeling false when socializing with people but was intrigued by where it will go in later episodes when the theatre stuff begins; Lynzee Loveridge noted how the production focused on its cast delivering harmless cute antics found in similar anime, crediting the decent chemistry but found it lacking in both comedy and dramatic development, saying it will fulfill its given niche and garner a small following that bought merch related to it; Nick Creamer was generally unimpressed by the adaptation's \"rote basics\" of the subgenre it occupies, highlighting the overused jokes and middling atmosphere that encompassed the episode, calling it \"a passable effort for genre enthusiasts\" but nothing more; Paul Jensen also noticed the usual slice-of-life trappings throughout the episode, pointing out the vibrant animation and \"mildly amusing\" cast of adorable female characters but felt it was missing a \"spark of creativity\" to put it above the other all-girl comedy shows that came out in previous seasons, saying its \"merely competent on a basic level.\" The fifth reviewer, Theron Martin, saw potential in the series with its main heroine Hinako overcoming her social anxiety through theatre and also gave praise to both studio Passione and director Takeo Takahashi for making a \"creative departure\" from their comfort zone to create an opener with solid delivery in both its aesthetic and humor, concluding that \"[I] probably won't watch any more, as this series isn't my kind of thing, but it looks quite promising for those who do like such fare.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Anime official website * Hinako Note at ComicWalker * Category:Anime series based on manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Yonkoma Category:Manga adapted into television series Category:Media Factory manga Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises Category:Passione (company) ",
