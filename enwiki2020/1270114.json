    "text": "Pedro Iarley Lima Dantas or simply Iarley (born March 29, 1974 in Quixeramobim, Brazil) is a Brazilian retired footballer who played mainly as an attacking midfielder. ==Club career== Iarley played for Ferrovi\u00e1rio, Cear\u00e1, and Paysandu of Brazil, Real Madrid B, AD Ceuta and UD Melilla of Spain, Boca Juniors of Argentina and Dorados de Sinaloa of Mexico. He joined Internacional for the 2005 Campeonato Brasileiro from Dorados de Sinaloa, where he played during the 2004-2005 season. Although Iarley impressed at Dorados in his first season, he also struggled with injuries, appearing in only nine games, registering three assists. At Internacional, Iarley made a good impression at first, but then lost his place in the team that eventually won the Copa Libertadores in 2006 to wonderboy Rafael Sobis. After Sobis's transfer to Real Betis, he took on the number 10 shirt and helped Inter win the FIFA Club World Cup in the same year. In 2008, he moved on to Goi\u00e1s. And in 2009, he scored 12 goals in S\u00e9rie A and his team made a good season occupying the first positions despite of finishing in 9th. In the end of 2009, Iarley signed a contract with Corinthians. In the end of 2010, he moved to fellow S\u00e9rie A team Cear\u00e1 . Iarley retired from football on August 22, 2014, after leaving his first club Ferrovi\u00e1rio. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Boca Juniors *Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n: 2003 Apertura *Intercontinental Cup: 2003 ;Internacional *Copa Libertadores: 2006 *FIFA Club World Cup: 2006 *Recopa Sudamericana: 2007 *Rio Grande do Sul State Championship: 2008 ;Goi\u00e1s *Goi\u00e1s State Championship: 2009, 2012 *Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B: 2012 ;Paysandu *Par\u00e1 State Championship: 2013 *Individual FIFA CLUB WORLD CUP SILVER BALL: 2006 ==References== ==External links== * * * pedroiarley Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Argentina Category:Expatriate footballers in Mexico Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Real Madrid Castilla footballers Category:AD Ceuta footballers Category:UD Melilla footballers Category:Dorados de Sinaloa footballers Category:Boca Juniors footballers Category:Sport Club Internacional players Category:Cear\u00e1 Sporting Club players Category:Goi\u00e1s Esporte Clube players Category:Paysandu Sport Club players Category:Ferrovi\u00e1rio Atl\u00e9tico Clube (CE) players Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B players Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Liga MX players Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Argentina Category:Sport Club Corinthians Paulista players Category:Association football midfielders ",
