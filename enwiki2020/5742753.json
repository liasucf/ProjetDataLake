    "text": "Live...In the Raw is the first live album by W.A.S.P. (fourth album overall), released in 1987. This album can be seen as something of a breakwater between the 'old' W.A.S.P. of the first three albums and the more mature sound of the releases that would follow. It is also the album to feature \"Harder Faster\", which is about the PMRC declaring them \"sexual perverts\". \"The Manimal\" and \"Harder Faster\" were written specifically for this album and the studio song \"Scream Until You Like It\" was recorded for the movie Ghoulies II. The acoustic version of \"Sleeping (In the Fire)\" is also a studio recording. This would be the final release to feature drummer Steve Riley, who would leave the band shortly after the conclusion of the tour to join L.A. Guns. ==Track listing== All songs written by Blackie Lawless unless otherwise noted. ;Side one #\"Inside the Electric Circus\" \u2013 4:32 #\"I Don't Need No Doctor\" (Jo Armstead, Nick Ashford, Valerie Simpson) \u2013 3:35 #\"L.O.V.E.
