Its English language common names include flowering merrillia, katinga, and Malay lemon. In Malaysia it is called ketenggah and kemuning gajah.Lim, T. K. (2012). Merrillia caloxylon. In: Edible Medicinal And Non-Medicinal Plants. Springer Netherlands. 890-92. The species is native to Malaysia, Thailand, and Sumatra in Indonesia. This species is a member of the Rutaceae subfamily Aurantioideae, which includes the genus Citrus. It is the only genus and species in the subtribe Merrilliinae, which are known technically as the large-fruited remote citroid fruit trees.Citrus Variety Collection. University of California, Riverside. ==Description== This species is a tree often reaching up to 20 meters tall, sometimes approaching 30 meters. One report from 1932 mentions a specimen collected from a tree 33.6 meters tall. If the report is valid it would be the largest tree of the Aurantioideae. The trunk has a light, flaking bark. The leaves can exceed 20 centimeters in length,Citrus Variety Collection: Merrillia caloxylon. University of California, Riverside. and each is made up of 5 to 13 leaflets up to about 10 centimeters long, the basal ones smaller than the others. They are thin, bright green, and somewhat lance-shaped with triangular bases. The flowers are solitary, paired, or borne in panicles. They are white to yellow-green and trumpet-shaped with petals up to 1.8 centimeters long. The oblong fruit is up to 11 centimeters long by 7.5 wide. It has a warty peel over a centimeter thick. It is green, turning yellow with maturity. The fruit contains a tasteless, fibrous, olive-green pulp. The native habitat of the tree includes primary and secondary tropical forest. ==Uses== The species has been noted for its wood, which is bright yellow with dark brown streaks. It is a hard wood used historically in Malaysia to make walking sticks and kris handles. It was also good for making furniture and boxes. The species was too rare to provide a supply of commercial timber. Several coumarins have been isolated from the roots, including one named merrillin.Bin Zakaria, M., et al. (1989). Coumarins of Merrillia caloxylon. Phytochemistry 28(2), 657-59. The alkaloid yuehchukene has been found in the bark; it is a compound well known from the related genus Murraya.Kong, Y., et al.
