    "text": "Bobby Mathews, the all-time leader in fielding errors as a pitcher. In baseball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important defensive player, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer. Bobby Mathews is the all-time leader committing 220 career errors as a pitcher. Mathews is the only pitcher to commit more than 200 career errors at the position. Tim Keefe is second all- time with 166 career errors as a pitcher. A total of seventeen pitchers all- time have committed more than 100 career errors at the position. ==Key== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%;\" | Rank || Rank amongst leaders in career errors committed.
