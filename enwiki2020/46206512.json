    "text": "The Main Event was a co-headlining concert tour from American boy band New Kids on the Block with special guests TLC, and Nelly. The tour began on May 1, 2015, in Las Vegas, and finished on July 2, 2015, in Buffalo, New York. It included close to fifty dates across North America. It was the thirty-eighth ranked North American tour of 2015, grossing $26.1 million. ==Background== In January 2015, New Kids on the Block appeared on Good Morning America to announce the tour. It had been hinted that the band might collaborate with TLC and Nelly while on the road. For the show's production there would be \"new and top notch production elements\", and a 360 degree stage. TLC was excited about the tour and said, \"We are thrilled to be able to join pop icons NKOTB and Nelly on tour. We are equally excited to back on the road connecting with our fans in such huge arenas.\" ==Concert synopsis== The concert began with Nelly performing a few of his songs, followed by TLC's set, which was approximately 40 minutes long. Then there was a ten-minute break before New Kids on the Block took the stage. Going with the theme of the tour, the band dramatically entered the stage looking \"like prizefighters entering a ring,\" \"wearing modern leather ensembles\" and opening their set with a new song. \"1989\" would appear in a wedding-invitation style font on the screen whenever a classic New Kids song was performed. Fans could see the band during the costume changes that were captured on the \"Quick Change Cam.\" The show was filled with production and choreography for every song, including streamer cannons, confetti shooting high into the air, and heart-shaped balloons. The band started the show with two new songs. Other songs performed were \"Block Party\", \"10\", \"Crash\", \"Step by Step\" and \"My Favorite Girl\". There were solo sections during the show, such as Jordan Knight on his solo hit \"Give It to You\", Joey McIntyre on \"Twisted\", and Donnie Wahlberg on \"I Need You\". ==Setlists== ==Tour dates== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !width=\"150\"|Date !width=\"150\"|City !width=\"150\"|Country !width=\"250\"|Venue |- !colspan=\"6\"|North America |- |May 1, 2015 |Las Vegas |rowspan=\"3\"|United States |Mandalay Bay Events Center |- |May 2, 2015 |Anaheim |Honda Center |- |May 3, 2015 |San Jose |SAP Center |- |May 5, 2015 |Vancouver |Canada |Rogers Arena |- |May 6, 2015 |Tacoma |rowspan=\"39\"|United States |Tacoma Dome |- |May 8, 2015 |San Jose |SAP Center |- |May 9, 2015 |Inglewood |The Forum |- |May 11, 2015 |San Diego |Viejas Arena |- |May 12, 2015 |Glendale |Gila River Arena |- |May 14, 2015 |Dallas |American Airlines Center |- |May 15, 2015 |New Orleans |Smoothie King Center |- |May 16, 2015 |Houston |Toyota Center |- |May 18, 2015 |Oklahoma City |Chesapeake Energy Arena |- |May 19, 2015 |Kansas City |Sprint Center |- |May 20, 2015 |Saint Paul |Xcel Energy Center |- |May 22, 2015 |St. Louis |Scottrade Center |- |May 23, 2015 |rowspan=\"2\"|Rosemont |rowspan=\"2\"|Allstate Arena |- |May 24, 2015 |- |May 26, 2015 |Cincinnati |U.S. Bank Arena |- |May 27, 2015 |Nashville |Bridgestone Arena |- |May 29, 2015 |Auburn Hills |The Palace of Auburn Hills |- |May 30, 2015 |Grand Rapids |Van Andel Arena |- |May 31, 2015 |Indianapolis |Bankers Life Fieldhouse |- |June 2, 2015 |Charlotte |Time Warner Cable Arena |- |June 4, 2015 |Sunrise |BB&T; Center |- |June 5, 2015 |Orlando |Amway Center |- |June 6, 2015 |Atlanta |Philips Arena |- |June 7, 2015 |Louisville |KFC Yum!

[they] made sure that every section of the venue got a little love.\" Beth Spotswood from SF Gate stated that the New Kids \"appeared older, more embarrassing in concert.\" Spotswood was ready to go home once McIntyre went out on stage wearing nothing but white jeans. On opening act Nelly, she said, \"it was a bit sad to see the rapper hit the stage to perform for a bunch of moms at 7:20 p.m. on a Sunday evening.\" McIntyre would occasionally thank \"the audience for sticking by NKOTB.\" ==References== Category:New Kids on the Block concert tours Category:TLC (group) concert tours Category:Co-headlining concert tours Category:2015 concert tours ",
