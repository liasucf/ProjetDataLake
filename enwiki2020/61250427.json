    "text": "Wheelchair fencing at the 2020 Summer Paralympics will be held at Makuhari Messe, the same place where goalball, taekwondo and volleyball will take place. It will consist of sixteen events (eight male, eight female) including two team events. ==Qualification== The qualification period begins 1 November 2018 and ends on 31 May 2020. The qualification slots are allocated to the individual athlete, not to the NPC. This also applies via Bipartite Commission Invitation which starts at the end of the qualification period and ends on 20 June 2020. Every competing fencer has to gain points in order to compete in the Games; there are no automatic qualification slots. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Competition !! Date !!
