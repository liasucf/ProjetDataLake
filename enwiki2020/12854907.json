Amitostigma simplex. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2004. Downloaded on 10 September 2015. Its flowers are yellow, sometimes with brown spots. ==Taxonomy== The species was first described in 1940 by Tsin Tang and Fa Tsuan Wang, as Amitostigma simplex. A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of Amitostigma, Neottianthe and Ponerorchis were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. Amitostigma and Neottianthe were subsumed into Ponerorchis, with this species becoming Ponerorchis simplex. == References == Category:Endemic orchids of China simplex Category:Endangered plants Category:Flora of Sichuan Category:Orchids of Yunnan Category:Plants described in 1940 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
