    "text": "Jan Muscenius, (Jan Muszcze\u0144ski alias Jan Mucha, 1532 \u2013 21 July 1602) was a Polish astronomer, theologian, and the rector of Krak\u00f3w Academy (now Jagiellonian University).. == Life == Jan Muscenius was born in Kurzel\u00f3w, Sandomierz Province, and lived in Krak\u00f3w. He received his primary education in Kurzelow, then continued education in Krakow. In 1550, he enrolled in the Faculty of Liberal Art at the Krak\u00f3w Academy (now Jagiellonian University). In August 1558, he became the head of the Astronomy and Astrology Faculty. From 29 April 1556 to 24 February 1559, he was a rector of the Wawel cathedral school. On 23 September 1558 became the member of the Collegium Minor (Kolegium Mniejszego). Jan Muscenius was four times the rector of the Krak\u00f3w Academy (1592/1593, 1594/1595, 1599/1600, 1601/1602) Muscenius divided his book collection between Krak\u00f3w Academy and the collegiate church at Kurzel\u00f3w. The University of Warsaw Library has 59 beautifully bounded volumes from the Muscenius collection. == Research == On 24 August 1563 and 11 April 1564 together with other astronomers (Piotr Proboszczowic, Miko\u0142aj z Szadka, Stanis\u0142aw Jakobejusz) from the Krakow Academy observed the Jupiter and Saturn conjunctions. The observations showed that the mathematical method of the planets position calculation presented by Copernicus in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium are more accurate than previously used the Alfonsine tables and Albert Brudzewski tables. This result popularised to use the numerical values of the planets position according Copernicus, but not necessary to Copernican heliocentrism. He provided 1649 the pre-instrumental weather condition observations between 1555 and 1568. == Publications == * Epigrammata In Lavdem XI.
