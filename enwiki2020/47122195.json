It is owned by Grupo Radiof\u00f3nico ZER and airs a Regional Mexican format as La Ranchera 97.3. ==History== The history of XHSOS begins on the AM band, with a station licensed to Naco. XETM on 1350 kHz was awarded to Jes\u00fas Manuel Franco Mart\u00ednez on March 19, 1941. The station was originally licensed for operation at 1 kW day and night. Francisco Ernesto Ruiz, who would go on to become the Spanish radio play-by-play voice of the Houston Astros, was a disc jockey at XETM from 1972 to 1981.MLB: 2004 Nominees for the Ford C. Frick Award In 2000, XETM was sold to Arnoldo Rodr\u00edguez Zerme\u00f1o, founder of Grupo ZER. Zerme\u00f1o moved the station to El Sif\u00f3n (with studios in Agua Prieta), changed its callsign to XESOS-AM and increased its power to 50 kW daytime on 670 kHz. After the United States Federal Communications Commission complained about interference to other stations on 670, Mexico moved XESOS to 730 AM at 300 watts of power. The AM-FM migration saw XESOS become XHSOS-FM 97.3 with 25 kW of effective radiated power. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Radio stations in Sonora Category:Radio stations established in 1941 Category:Radio stations in Mexico with continuity obligations ",
