    "text": "Everything Louder than Everyone Else is the sixth live album by the band Mot\u00f6rhead, recorded 21 May 1998, and released 9 March 1999, on Steamhammer, their first live album with the label, but fourth album release. ==Recording== Vocalist/bassist Lemmy recalled making this during the Snake Bite Love tour, having decided to include an entire show on the release, which they hadn't done before because of the limitations of vinyl.Kilmister, Ian and Garza, Janiss White Line Fever (2002) \u2014 Simon & Schuster pp. 283-284 . The title refers to a remark repeated by Ian Gillan of Deep Purple on their Made in Japan live album: Recorded at The Docks nightclub in Hamburg, Germany, on 21 May 1998, Everything Louder than Everyone Else is produced 'undubbed' in a two disc format. It was first released as a digipak version, later followed by a slimline 2CD jewel-case run. Lemmy says he chose to record it in Hamburg, Germany because: ==Release== In Joel McIver's 2011 book Overkill: The Untold Story of Mot\u00f6rhead, Lemmy is quoted as saying he believes the album is better than the classic 1981 live LP No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, stating: ==Critical reception== At the start of the concert Lemmy announces, \"We are Mot\u00f6rhead; and we\u2019re gonna kick your ass.\" Critics picked this theme up, with some advocating that those thinking of buying this record first will be disappointed with studio versions of the songs after listening to the show.
