The Sony/Minolta A mount version is simply called Tamron 18-270mm F/3.5-6.3 Di II PZD as it lacks image stabilisation (VC, or Vibration Compensation, in Tamron classification). Compared to its predecessor, the Tamron AF 18-270mm F/3.5-6.3 Di II VC LD Aspherical (IF) MACRO, it is considerably reduced in size and features an ultrasonic motor (Piezo Drive in Tamron nomenclature). ==References== *http://www.dpreview.com/products/tamron/lenses/tamron_18-270_3p5-6p3_vc_pzd/specifications ==External links== Category:Superzoom lenses 18-270B Category:Camera lenses introduced in 2010 ",
