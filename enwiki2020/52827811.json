This is a list of player movements for Super Rugby teams prior to the end of the 2018 Super Rugby season. Departure and arrivals of all players that were included in a Super Rugby squad for 2017 or 2018 are listed here, regardless of when it occurred. Future-dated transfers are only included if confirmed by the player or his agent, his former team or his new team. In addition to the main squad, teams can also name additional players that train in backup or development squads for the franchises. These players are denoted by (wider training group) for New Zealand teams, or (extended playing squad) for Australian teams. ;Notes: * 2017 players listed are all players that were named in the initial senior squad, or subsequently included in a 23-man match day squad at any game during the season. * (did not play) denotes that a player did not play at all during one of the two seasons due to injury or non- selection. These players are included to indicate they were contracted to the team. * (short-term) denotes that a player wasn't initially contracted, but came in during the season. This could either be a club rugby player coming in as injury cover, or a player whose contract had expired at another team (typically in the northern hemisphere). * Flags are only shown for players moving to or from another country. * Players may play in several positions, but are listed in only one. ==Argentina== ===Jaguares=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left; width:95%\" |- ! colspan=\"100%\" | transfers 2017\u20132018 |- ! style=\"background:#ebecf0; width:6%;\" | Pos ! style=\"background:#ebecf0; width:20%;\" | 2017 squad ! style=\"background:#ebecf0; width:27%;\" | Out ! style=\"background:#ebecf0; width:27%;\" | In ! style=\"background:#ebecf0; width:20%;\" | 2018 squad |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | PR | Felipe Arregui Cristian Bartoloni Santiago Garc\u00eda Botta Facundo Gigena (did not play) Ramiro Herrera Lucas Noguera Paz Enrique Pieretto Roberto Tejerizo Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro | Cristian Bartoloni (to SA XV Charente) Facundo Gigena (to Leicester Tigers) Ramiro Herrera (to ) Lucas Noguera Paz (to Bath) Roberto Tejerizo (returned to Tucum\u00e1n) | Franco Brarda (from Tala) Javier D\u00edaz (from Nataci\u00f3n) Nicol\u00e1s Leiva (from Hind\u00fa) Santiago Medrano (from Regatas Bella Vista) Juan Pablo Zeiss (from Los Matreros) | Felipe Arregui Franco Brarda (training group, did not play) Javier D\u00edaz (training group) Santiago Garc\u00eda Botta Nicol\u00e1s Leiva (training group, did not play) Santiago Medrano (short-term) Enrique Pieretto (did not play) Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro Juan Pablo Zeiss (training group) |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | HK | Agust\u00edn Creevy Juli\u00e1n Montoya | | Diego Fortuny (from Universitario de Salta) | Agust\u00edn Creevy Diego Fortuny (training group) Juli\u00e1n Montoya |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | LK | Mat\u00edas Alemanno Juan Cruz Guillema\u00edn (did not play) Marcos Kremer Ignacio Larrague Tom\u00e1s Lavanini Guido Petti | Juan Cruz Guillema\u00edn (to Viadana) Ignacio Larrague (to CASI) | | Mat\u00edas Alemanno Marcos Kremer Tom\u00e1s Lavanini Guido Petti |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | FL | Rodrigo B\u00e1ez Juan Manuel Leguizam\u00f3n Tom\u00e1s Lezana Pablo Matera Javier Ortega Desio | Rodrigo B\u00e1ez (returned to Liceo) | Santiago Montagner (from Alumni) | Juan Manuel Leguizam\u00f3n Tom\u00e1s Lezana Pablo Matera Santiago Montagner (training group, did not play) Javier Ortega Desio |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | N8 | Benjam\u00edn Macome Santiago Portillo (did not play) Leonardo Senatore | Santiago Portillo (to Los Tarcos) | Rodrigo Bruni (from San Luis) | Rodrigo Bruni (training group, did not play) Benjam\u00edn Macome (did not play) Leonardo Senatore |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | SH | Gonzalo Bertranou Felipe Ezcurra Mart\u00edn Landajo | | Tom\u00e1s Cubelli (from ) | Gonzalo Bertranou Tom\u00e1s Cubelli (did not play) Felipe Ezcurra Mart\u00edn Landajo |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | FH | Joaqu\u00edn D\u00edaz Bonilla Santiago Gonz\u00e1lez Iglesias Juan Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez | | | Joaqu\u00edn D\u00edaz Bonilla Santiago Gonz\u00e1lez Iglesias Juan Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez Nicol\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | CE | Santiago \u00c1lvarez (did not play) Gabriel Asc\u00e1rate (did not play) Jer\u00f3nimo de la Fuente Bautista Ezcurra Mat\u00edas Moroni Mat\u00edas Orlando | Gabriel Asc\u00e1rate (returned to Nataci\u00f3n) | | Santiago \u00c1lvarez (did not play) Jer\u00f3nimo de la Fuente Bautista Ezcurra Mat\u00edas Moroni Mat\u00edas Orlando |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | WG | Emiliano Boffelli Santiago Cordero Nicol\u00e1s Freitas (did not play) Manuel Montero Ramiro Moyano | Santiago Cordero (to Exeter Chiefs) Nicol\u00e1s Freitas (to Carrasco Polo) Manuel Montero (to Pucar\u00e1) | Sebasti\u00e1n Cancelliere (from Hind\u00fa) Juan Cruz Mallia (from Jockey C\u00f3rdoba) | Emiliano Boffelli Sebasti\u00e1n Cancelliere Juan Cruz Mallia (short-term) Ramiro Moyano |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | FB | Joaqu\u00edn Tuculet | | Bautista Delguy (from Pucar\u00e1) | Bautista Delguy (training group) Joaqu\u00edn Tuculet |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Coach | Ra\u00fal P\u00e9rez | Ra\u00fal P\u00e9rez (to UAR High Performance Program) | Mario Ledesma (from (forwards coach)) | Mario Ledesma |} ==Australia== : See List of 2017\u201318 Super Rugby transfers (Australia) ==Japan== : See List of 2017\u201318 Super Rugby transfers (Japan) ==New Zealand== : See List of 2017\u201318 Super Rugby transfers (New Zealand) ==South Africa== See: List of 2017\u201318 Super Rugby transfers (South Africa) ==See also== * List of 2017\u201318 Premiership Rugby transfers * List of 2017\u201318 Pro14 transfers * List of 2017\u201318 Top 14 transfers * List of 2017\u201318 RFU Championship transfers * SANZAAR * Super Rugby franchise areas ==Notes== ==References== 2018 Category:2018 Super Rugby season Category:2017 Super Rugby season ",
