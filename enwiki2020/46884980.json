    "text": "Wilhelm Carl Gottlieb M\u00fcller (September 25, 1880 \u2013 June 16, 1968) was a German physicist, mathematician, and philosopher. He is best known as the successor of Arnold Sommerfeld as Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Munich. ==Life== Wilhelm M\u00fcller was born in Hamburg, the son of a merchant. He studied at the Leipzig University and earned his Rigorosum in mathematics, physics, and philosophy with the grade \"very good\". He went on to earn his PhD with Otto H\u00f6lder and Karl Rohn and a dissertation called \"The rational curve of degree five in the five-, four-, three- and two-dimensional space\" in 1911. At Leibniz University Hannover M\u00fcller got his habilitation and became a Privatdozent 1921, and later was appointed \"Ausserordentlicher Professor\". In 1928 Wilhelm M\u00fcller became professor at the Charles University in Prague. He joined the NSDAP in 1933, and went on to join the SA in 1936. In 1934 M\u00fcller accepted a position as professor and director of the Aeronautical Institute at RWTH Aachen University. His appointment in 1939 as Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Munich, which had been vacant for several years, was at the center of the controversy between modern physics and German physics. M\u00fcller, an aerodynamicist, had not been thought of as a theoretical physicist before this. He was dismissed in 1945. ==Works== * 1911 - The rational curve of degree five in the five-, four, three- and two-dimensional space (Die rationale Kurve f\u00fcnfter Ordnung im f\u00fcnf-, vier-, drei- und zweidimensionalen Raum; dissertation, Universit\u00e4t Leipzig, Karl Rohn, Otto H\u00f6lder) * 1922 - The sense of chastity (Vom Sinn der Keuschheit) * 1925 - The Eternal Grail (Vom ewigen Gral) * 1925 - Dynamics (Dynamik) (1952) * 1928 - Mathematical Fluid Mechanics (Mathematische Str\u00f6mungslehre) * 1932 - Introduction to the theory of viscous fluids (Einf\u00fchrung in die Theorie der z\u00e4hen Fl\u00fcssigkeiten) * 1933 - Jewry and Leadership (Judentum und F\u00fchrertum) * 1936 - Introduction to Aerodynamics (Einf\u00fchrung in die Mechanik des Fluges) (1942, 1953, 1958) * 1936 - Jewry and Science (Judentum und Wissenschaft) * 1941 - Jewish and German Physics (J\u00fcdische und Deutsche Physik), together with Johannes Stark * 1944 - The Battle in Physics (Kampf in der Physik) * 1959 - Theory of Elastic Deformation (Theorie der elastischen Verformung) ==External links== * Category:German physicists Category:Nazi Party members Category:University of Hanover faculty Category:Charles University faculty Category:RWTH Aachen University faculty Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich faculty Category:1880 births Category:1968 deaths Category:20th- century German scientists Category:20th-century physicists ",
