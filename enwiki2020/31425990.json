    "text": "Vulpix () and Ninetales (), known in Japan as and , are two fictional creatures, linked by evolution, in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok\u00e9mon media franchise. Ninetales evolves from Vulpix when exposed to a Fire Stone or Ice Stone in the case of Alolan Vulpix. Created by Ken Sugimori, they first appeared in the video games Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue and later appear in subsequent sequels, various merchandise, spinoff titles, and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. They are known as the Fox Pok\u00e9mon. ==Concept and characteristics== Both Vulpix and Ninetales are known as the Fox Pok\u00e9mon, and are both Fire types with multiple tails. ===Vulpix=== Nintendo decided to give the various Pok\u00e9mon species \"clever and descriptive names\" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children. It was originally going to be named Foxfire in the English versions until Nintendo of America settled with Vulpix, which is based on \"vulpus\", the Latin word for fox.Pokemon Strategy Guide - IGNguides Vulpix is a fox-like creature with six curled tails, based on the Japanese fox spirit kitsune. From birth, Vulpix starts out with only one tail, which is white in color; this tail splits apart as it grows and turns red. Most commonly female, Vulpix are especially known for having beautiful fur and tails. Vulpix have a flame in their bodies, which when the temperature outside increases, they let out of their mouths to prevent their body temperature from getting too hot. They can control this fire, and make them fly like will-o'-the-wisps. In the wild, Vulpix will feign injury to escape from more powerful predators. An unevolved \"baby\" version of Vulpix, named Trifox, was designed for the 1999 video games Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver, however, this creature was cut from the game before release. In a 1997 prototype version of Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver, Trifox is a water-type Pok\u00e9mon, unlike its fire-type evolutions Vulpix and Ninetales. ===Ninetales=== A print by Utagawa Kuniyoshi depicting the nine-tailed fox (above) which inspired Ninetales. Ninetales, is a golden-white nine-tailed fox, based on the kitsune, a Japanese fox spirit. The , which held similar powers such as shapeshifting, were the main inspiration for the Pok\u00e9mon. Ninetales' name was derived from the number of its tails, nine, and the fact that the idea for it came primarily from ancient Japanese tales . This fox- like Pok\u00e9mon is covered with a thick, luxurious golden-white fur, with a fluffy crest atop its head and a similar ruff around its neck. Ninetales have gleaming red eyes that are said to give them the power of mind control. Its nine different tails hold strange, cosmic powers that let it live for 1000 years. Ninetales are highly intelligent Pok\u00e9mon that understand human speech. They are very vengeful and have been known to curse those who mistreat them for 1000 years. Many legends surround this Pok\u00e9mon, one of which states that Ninetales was born when nine saints were united and reincarnated as this Pok\u00e9mon. ==Appearances== ===In the video games=== Vulpix and Ninetales first appeared in Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, though it was only obtainable without trading in Blue.
