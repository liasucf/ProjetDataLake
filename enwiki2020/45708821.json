The team played its home games in the Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, and was a member of the Big Ten Conference. The Hoosiers finished the regular season with a 19\u201310 record, and after losing in the second round of the Big Ten Tournament, earned a 5-seed in the 2002 NCAA Tournament. What followed was a surprise run to the National Championship game, earning the program its eighth Final Four appearance. Though the Hoosiers lost to Maryland in the final, they upset top-seeded Duke in the Sweet 16 and took down future Indiana head coach Kelvin Sampson's 2-seed Oklahoma Sooners squad in the Final Four. The team was led by Bloomington- native sophomore star Jared Jeffries. Other members of the team included seniors Dane Fife and Jarrad Odle, as well as another former Indiana Mr. Basketball Tom Coverdale. ==Roster== ==Schedule/Results== |- !colspan=8| Regular Season |- |- !colspan=8| Big Ten Tournament |- !colspan=8| NCAA Tournament ==Players drafted into the NBA== {|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\" |- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#990000;color:#FFFFCC;\" | Round || Pick || Player || NBA Club |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" | 1 || 11 || Jared Jeffries|| Washington Wizards |} ==References== Category:Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball seasons Indiana Category:NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament Final Four seasons Indiana Category:2001 in sports in Indiana Category:2002 in sports in Indiana ",
