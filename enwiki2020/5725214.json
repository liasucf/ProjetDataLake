    "text": "Grand Prix Wrestling (GPW) is a professional wrestling promotion run and owned by Emile Dupr\u00e9e. Grand Prix Wrestling has recently finished the 2013 Rising Sun In The Maritimes Tour. Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling tours parts of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia. It has no connection with Paul Vachon's Grand Prix Wrestling promotion of Montreal in the 1970s. ==History== ===Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling=== Originally known as Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling (AGPW), the regional circuit has been around since the early 1960s. During the 60s and the 70s AGPW was so popular it became a hit in the Maritimes. AGPW cards were held in Moncton, New Brunswick on Monday nights, Halifax, Nova Scotia on Thursdays, Berwick, Nova Scotia on Saturday evenings and along other small towns in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. Every summer, there were two big titles up for grabs: The United States Heavyweight Title and the North American Tag Team Title. Other titles included the European Heavyweight Title and the Maritime Heavyweight Title. The European Heavyweight Title was held more by Killer Karl Krupp than any other wrestler and The Maritime Heavyweight Title was held most often by Stephen Petitpas. During the late 1980s, the United States Heavyweight Title was changed to the International Heavyweight Title. ===Rising Sun In The Maritimes Tour=== Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling returned to the Maritimes in 2013 for a summer tour. The roster featured former WWE wrestler Rene Dupree, All Japan Pro Wrestling star Seiya Sanada, She Nay Nay, Bellatrix star Erin Angel, midget wrestlers Lil' Fabio and Lil' Poppa Pump, The Masked Thunderbolt, Kwan Chang, Jeremy Prophet, Bobby Sharp, Spiderman and Japanese star, Daiki Inaba. The tour kicked off in Borden-Carleton, Prince Edward Island with a show featuring a special guest appearance by Japanese legend The Great Muta. The tour continued with Prince Edward Island shows in Souris and O' Leary. Nova Scotia shows included: Springhill, Bridgewater, two in Berwick, Tatamagouche, Truro, Cheticamp, North Sydney, Baddeck and Antigonish. The New Brunswick portion of the tour included shows in: Cocagne (3 times), Neguac, Lameque, Chipman, Fredericton Junction, Blacks Harbour, Baie St. Anne, Minto, Petit-Rocher, Doaktown and Sunny Corner. The tour was very successful and it brought a lot of escalation toward what is now known as the 2014 New Era Tour that featured Rene Dupree, Yasufumi Nakanoue, Butcher Vachon, Bobby Sharp, Jeremy Prophet, the return of the Cuban Assassin and many more. Towns featured on the tour included Neguac, Black's Harbour and Minto (New Brunswick), O'Leary, Borden-Carleton and Souris (Prince Edward Island), and Sydney, Baddeck, Berwick, Truro and Springhill (Nova Scotia). ===Eastern Canada Tour=== In May 2015, AGPW held a tour across Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. ==Alumni== ;Male wrestlers {| class=\"pretty sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center; width:70%;\" |- !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Birth name: !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Ring name(s): !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Tenure: !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Notes |- | |The Cuban Assassin / The Cuban Commando |sort|1979\u20131980 1982 1984\u20131985 1989 1992 1999\u20132000 | |- | |The Cuban Assassin / Cuban Assassin #2 |sort|1999 2005\u20132006 2008 | |- | |Mentallo |sort|2001 | |- | |Bill Cody |sort|1982\u20131983 | |- | |Bobby Bass |sort|1980 1982 | |- | |Dino Ventura |sort|1987-1988 | |- | |Frenchie Lamont |sort|2005\u20132006 | |- | |Vinnie Valentino |sort|1988 | |-Andr\u00e9 the Giant | |Bob Brown |sort|1983 1988 1990 | |- | |Rick Valentine |sort|1982\u20131983 | |- | |Tokyo Chono |sort|1988 | |- | |Bad News Brown |sort|1997 | |- | |Sexton Hardcastle |sort|1997 | |- | |Leo Burke |sort|1979\u20131980 1982\u20131983 1988\u20131992 1998\u20131999 | |- | |Rudy Kay |sort|1982\u20131983 | |- | |Bobby Kay |sort|1982\u20131983 1990 | |- | |The Beast |sort|1982 1988\u20131990 1999\u20132000 | |- | |Danny Young |sort|1984 | |- | |Hercules Ayala Cortez |sort|1982 | |- | |Scott D'Amore / Masked Super Warrior #2 |sort|1997\u20131998 | |- | |Rick the Bruiser |sort|1998 | |- | |Gerry Morrow |sort|1989 | |- | |Phil Atlas |sort|2008 | |- | |Wayne Gillis |sort|1988\u20131989 | |- | |Farmer Brooks |sort|1988 | |- | |Rudy Diamond |sort|1988 | |- | |Frenchy Martin |sort|1983 | |- | |Wildman Austin |sort|1997 1998\u20132000 2005\u20132006 | |- | |Hubert Gallant |sort|1980 1982\u20131983 | |- | |Damian Gibbs |sort|2015 | |- | |Lenny Montana |sort|1983\u20131984 | |- | |Emile Dupre |sort|1979\u20131980 1988 | |- | |Jeff Dupr\u00e9e |sort|2005\u20132006 2008 | |- | |Ren\u00e9 Dupr\u00e9e / Ren\u00e9 Rougeau |sort|1998\u20132001 2006 2008 2015 2017 | |- | |Tony Russo |sort|1983\u20131984 | |- | |Archie Gouldie |sort|1984 | |- | |Giant Pharaoh |sort|2015 | |- | |Big John the Quebec Lumberjack |sort|1982 | |- | |Sonny Two Rivers |sort|1997\u20131998 | |- | |Joe E.
