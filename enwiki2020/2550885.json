    "text": "Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, commonly known as Davis Polk, is an international law firm headquartered in New York City with 982 attorneys worldwide, with offices in Washington, D.C., Northern California, London, Paris, Madrid, Hong Kong, Beijing, Tokyo, and S\u00e3o Paulo. == History == Davis Polk traces its origin to a one-man practice in Manhattan opened by a 21-year-old lawyer, Francis N. Bangs. The firm changed its name several times to account for new partners, using names such as Bangs & Stetson; Bangs, Stetson, Tracey & MacVeagh, and Stetson, Jennings & Russell. Towards the end of the 19th century, John Pierpont Morgan hired Francis Stetson, then name partner of the firm, as his chief counsel. During Stetson's tenure, the firm helped Morgan to restructure the Pennsylvania Railroad as well as create General Electric. The modern incarnations of Morgan's business, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, have remained key clients of the firm. Among other high-profile lawyers, President Grover Cleveland served as a member of the firm during the interval between his two non-consecutive presidential terms.Allan Nevins, Grover Cleveland: A Study in Courage, p.450. The firm was located at 15 Broad Street from around 1889 to 1962, and then at One Chase Manhattan Plaza until 1992. The firm voted in 1967 to take its current name from three of the firm's most influential partners from the early-to-mid 20th century: John W. Davis, Frank Polk, and Allen Wardwell. In 1935, In response to the Glass\u2013Steagall Act of 1932, the firm performed the legal work to spin off the investment banking arm of J.P. Morgan & Co., which became known as Morgan Stanley. In 1938, the firm represented Erie Railroad in the landmark case Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), in which Justice Louis Brandeis introduced the Erie doctrine. In 1952, John W. Davis represented U.S. Steel and successfully challenged the constitutionality of President Harry S. Truman's attempted takeover of the company in a famous case that has been referenced by most legal scholars today to assess executive power (see Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952)). In 1962, the firm opened its first overseas office in Paris. In 1971, Lydia Kess was the first woman to be promoted to partner, becoming the second female partner at a major Wall Street law firm. In 1981, the firm played an important role in negotiating the financial aspects of the resolution of the Iranian hostage crisis. In 1998, the firm advised Exxon on its $81 billion merger with Mobil, the largest merger in history at the time. In 2000, the firm advised its long-term client, J.P. Morgan & Co., on its merger with Chase Manhattan Bank to form JPMorgan Chase. From 1999 to 2010, the firm worked on the initial public offerings of United Parcel Service, AT&T; Wireless, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Visa Inc., General Motors and Agricultural Bank of China, some of the largest IPOs in history. During the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the firm represented many government clients, including the United States Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the firm had important roles in the AIG, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and Citigroup matters, as well as in the drafting of the Dodd\u2013Frank Act. In 2009, to bolster its financial regulatory practice, the firm hired three former Securities and Exchange Commission officials: Commissioner Annette Nazareth, Director of Enforcement Linda Chatman Thomsen, and Deputy Director of Trading and Markets Robert Colby\u2014as well as former White House Staff Secretary Raul Yanes and former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation General Counsel John Douglas. ==Controversy about race relations== John W. Davis's legal career is most remembered for his final appearance before the Supreme Court, in which he unsuccessfully defended the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in Briggs v. Elliott, a companion case to Brown v. Board of Education. Davis, as a defender of racial segregation and state control of education, argued that South Carolina had shown good faith in attempting to eliminate any inequality between black and white schools and should be allowed to continue to do so without judicial intervention.

Board of Education National Historic Site page 12 https://books.google.nl/books?id=xZJmJcHYnP0C&pg;=PA12&lpg;=PA12&dq;=%22Briggs+v.+Elliott%22+%22john+davis%22&source;=bl&ots;=u3vlM- ruxW&sig;=ACfU3U2ZxLrm1v44ugHL05fZQT9rKeeXhQ&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjYloX7mqTqAhXF0aQKHfDIDToQ6AEwBXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q;=%22Briggs%20v.%20Elliott%22%20%22john%20davis%22&f;=false He expected to win, most likely through a divided Supreme Court, even after the matter was re-argued after the death of Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson. After the Supreme Court unanimously ruled against his client's position, he returned the $25,000 (equivalent to $ in ), that he had received from South Carolina, although he was not required to do so, but kept a silver tea service that had been presented to him. It has also been reported that he never charged South Carolina in the first place. He declined to participate further in the case, as he did not wish to be involved in the drafting of decrees to implement the Court's decision. In Guinn v United States, as Solicitor General, while he argued against the legality of the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d, he conceded the legality of the literacy tests, which was used to disenfranchise African Americans and others.Joe Patrice E Davis Polk Is Named After A Segregationist\u2026 Perhaps It\u2019s Time To Consider A New Name 17 January 2020 https://abovethelaw.com/2020/06/davis-polk-is-named-after-a-segregationist- perhaps-its-time-to-consider-a-new-name/ Lisa G.
