    "text": "The Wellington\u2013Castner House is a historic house in Waltham, Massachusetts. This 2-1/2 story wood frame house was built in 1902 and is one of the last houses built on Trapelo Road before the advent of suburban subdivision of the area. The house has simple, vernacular, Queen Anne styling; it was built for Charles Lowell Wellington, whose family owned land in the area from the 17th century. The house is three bays wide, with a front-facing pedimented gable, and a single-story hip-roofed porch with gable over the stairs, supported by square posts. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Waltham, Massachusetts ==References== Category:Houses in Waltham, Massachusetts Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Waltham, Massachusetts Category:Queen Anne architecture in Massachusetts Category:Houses completed in 1902 ",
