    "text": "Manchester Baseball Club is one of the largest baseball clubs in the north of England, with two senior teams and four youth teams playing in the British Baseball Federation leagues. The club can trace its roots back as far as 1947, with the formation of the Stretford Saints. Although the Saints club folded in 1973, the name hung around, with the Trafford Saints youth team playing during the 1990s with reasonable success. Trafford merged with the senior Manchester team in 2000, creating the MBC as it is today. ==Brief History== *1847 Baseball is first played in GB by touring teams *1890 Baseball Association of GB formed *1934 Baseball started in North West.
