While the film notably copies the title and logo of the 1999 American film Fight Club, the plot has few parallels or allusions to the American film or the novel on which it is based. ==Plot== The story follows four friends, Vicky (Zayed Khan), Karan (Dino Morea), Somil (Riteish Deshmukh) and Diku (Aashish Chaudhary). The four often attend clubs and drink alcohol together. One night, they witness a physical brawl, and Vicky comes up with the idea of making a \"Fight Club,\" in which the participants will be allowed to fight physically but with valid reason. The night when the Fight Club is opened, Somil comes to know that his uncle, who brought him up and currently lives in Delhi, has met some troubles. Some local gangsters want to take over the club of Somil's uncle to use it for drugs smuggling. After being firmly rejected, they threatened to kill him. Somil then leaves for Delhi to help his uncle, leaving the other 3 boys running the Fight Club in Mumbai. When Mohit (Yash Tonk), a college youngster, enters the club and takes part in a fight, he ends up beating his opponent severely to critical condition. After being stopped by Vicky, Mohit attacks him, to which response Vicky throws him out of the club. The scene is caught by several police officers, they arrest Mohit and seals the Fight Club, but others manage to escape and select a new place to keep running the Fight Club. After Mohit is released, he arrives with his gangster friends to get revenge, but is rejected by the latter. Anna (Sunil Shetty), Mohit's older brother, is released from prison where he stayed for 8 years and visits Mohit to see if he has changed himself from keeping fighting and working for gangsters, Anna tells Mohit that the reason he quit the gangster group and handed himself to the police was that he wanted to set a good example for Mohit. He then takes Mohit to Delhi for vacation. Vicky, Karan and Diku keep running the Fight Club. One night, Vicky's past classmate Sameer (Sohail Khan) shows up in the club to challenge Vicky. Sameer almost beats Vicky, but police arrives in the scene, making all of them escape. The new place is sealed again by police, and the 3 friends decide to give it up and go to Delhi to visit Somil.
