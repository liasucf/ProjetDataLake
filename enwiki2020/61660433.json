Cole Custer overtook teammate Briscoe at the conclusion of Stage 1, and won Stage 2, which did not see any cautions. Alex Labb\u00e9 notably won points in both stages and also had a career-best finish of 6th. On lap 45, a caution occurred and four playoff drivers, including Brandon Jones and John Hunter Nemechek, were involved. Afterwards, Briscoe attempted to overtake Christopher Bell for second place. Briscoe drove hard into Bell, running him off the track. Bell was obligated to serve a penalty due to going off-track, but instead chased Briscoe down and deliberately spun him. Bell was ruled by NASCAR to have to restart at the rear of the field. Briscoe suffered as his team spent a long time repairing his car. Neither driver was able to fully recover from the incident, though Bell was already locked into the next round of the playoffs from his win at the previous week's race. For the other playoffs drivers, Ryan Sieg dealt with fuel pressure issues early in the race, finishing two laps down. Justin Haley experienced mechanical issues and went to the garage for repairs, finishing six laps down. A. J. Allmendinger had a strong run on the final restart, winning the race with a 2-second lead over Tyler Reddick. Nemechek, Jones, Sieg, and Haley all exited the race below the cut line for the playoffs. ===Stage Results=== Stage One Laps: 20 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:98% |- ! Pos ! ! Driver !
