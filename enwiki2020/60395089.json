    "text": "==History== The historic Edward VI Grammar School buildings in Retford, designed by Decimus Burton Retford King Edward VI Grammar school was a grammar school opened on London Road, Retford, England in 1857, after being moved from an older site in Chapelgate, Retford. The school motto \"Ex pulvere palma\" means (loosely): out of the dust (of competition) (comes) the palm (of victory) The school, which was located on London Road site was opened in 1857 with buildings designed by builder Decimus Burton. Consisting of only one schoolroom originally, the school later built a library, head master's house later to house the school office, and head master's office. In 1890, an adjoining gymnasium was added, with above it a large projection room. 1906 meant the erection of, along the Dominie Cross Road, several \u2018temporary\u2019 buildings, which included the so-called \"Tin Tab\". In 1912, the school pupils, like those of many other schools of the day, donated monies to fund dogs for the 1912 Arctic expedition of Robert Falcon Scott. The Fives Court was gifted in 1924 in the memory of William Eyre a fallen World War 1 casualty. In 1926 a new block of classrooms was opened containing the first library. The iron guttering still bears that date in 2019.
