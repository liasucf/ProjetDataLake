    "text": "The Plantronics Colorplus is a graphics card for IBM PC computers, first sold in 1982. It is a superset of the then-current CGA standard, using the same monitor standard and providing the same pixel resolutions. It was produced by Frederick Electronics, of Frederick, Maryland. The Colorplus has twice the memory of a standard CGA board (32k, compared to 16k). The additional memory can be used in graphics modes to double the color depth, giving two additional graphics modes\u201416 colors at 320\u00d7200 resolution, or 4 colors at 640\u00d7200 resolution. It uses the same Motorola MC6845 display controller as the previous MDA and CGA adapters. The original card also includes a parallel printer port. ==Output capabilities== CGA compatible modes: *160\u00d7100 16 color mode *320x200 in 4 colors from a 16 color hardware palette. Pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.2. *640\u00d7200 in 2 colors. Pixel aspect ratio of 1:2.4 *40\u00d725 with 8\u00d78 pixel font text mode(effective resolution of 320\u00d7200) *80\u00d725 with 8\u00d78 pixel font text mode(effective resolution of 640\u00d7200) In addition to the CGA modes, it offers: *320x200 with 16 colors *640x200 with 4 colors *\"New high- resolution\" text font, selectable by hardware jumper (The \"new\" font was actually the unused \"thin\" font already present in the IBM CGA ROMs, with 1-pixel wide vertical strokes. This offered greater clarity on RGB monitors, versus the default \"thick\" / 2-pixel font more suitable for output to composite monitors and over RF to televisions but, contrary to Plantronics' advertising claims, was drawn at the same 8x8 pixel resolution.) ==Software support== Few programs made use of these modes, for which there was no BIOS support. A 1984 advertisement listed as compatible software Color-It, UCSD P-system, Peachtree Graphics Language, Business Graphics System, Graph Power, The Draftsman, Videogram, Stock View and GSX. In addition, Canyon State Systems CompuShowhttp://cd.textfiles.com/clipart1996/UTILS/CSHOW860/ABOUT860.TXT supports the 320\u00d7200 mode. Planet X3, released by American YouTuber David \"The 8-Bit Guy\" Murray in 2019, is the only video game known to have Colorplus support. ==Hardware Clones== Some third-party CGA and EGA clones, such as the ATI Graphics Solution and the Paradise AutoSwitch EGA 480, could emulate the extra modes (usually describing them simply as 'Plantronics mode'). The Thomson TO16 (a PC-XT compatible) had the Plantronics modes integrated on the motherboard, along with CGA. ==See also== *Tandy Graphics Adapter, a graphics board with similar capabilities. ==References== ==External links== *\"+COLORPLUS Shatters The Mold.\", an original advertisement. *A USENET posting describing the Plantronics Colorplus *The technical documentation for the Paradise EGA chipset in the Amstrad PC-1640 describes its Plantronics compatibility mode.
