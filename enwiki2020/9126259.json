    "text": "Agathiphaga is a genus of moths in the family Agathiphagidae, known as kauri moths. This caddisfly-like lineage of primitive moths was first reported by Lionel Jack Dumbleton in 1952, as a new genus of Micropterigidae. The caterpillars feed only on \"kauri\" (Agathis) and are currently considered the second most primitive living lineage of moths after Micropterigoidea. The larva has been reported to be able to survive for 12 years in diapause, durability possibly a prerequisite to its possible dispersion around the Pacific islands in the seeds of Agathis. Dumbleton described two species. Agathiphaga queenslandensis is found along the north-eastern coast of Queensland, Australia, and its larvae feed on Agathis robusta. Agathiphaga vitiensis is found from Fiji to Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands, and its larvae feed on Agathis vitiensis. == References == == External links == * * * * Agathiphagidae Tree of Life Web Project * Category:Moth genera Category:Taxa named by Lionel Jack Dumbleton ",
