    "text": "N-acetyltransferase 2 (arylamine N-acetyltransferase), also known as NAT2, is an enzyme which in humans is encoded by the NAT2 gene. == Function == This gene encodes a type of N-acetyltransferase. The NAT2 isozyme functions to both activate and deactivate arylamine and hydrazine drugs and carcinogens. Polymorphisms in this gene are responsible for the N-acetylation polymorphism in which human populations segregate into rapid, intermediate, and slow acetylator phenotypes. Polymorphisms in NAT2 are also associated with higher incidences of cancer and drug toxicity. A second arylamine N-acetyltransferase gene (NAT1) is located near NAT2. == Phenotype prediction == The NAT2 acetylator phenotype can be inferred from NAT2 genotype (a combination of SNPs observed in a given individual). == References == == Further reading == * * * * * == External links == * * * * PDBe-KB provides an overview of all the structure information available in the PDB for Human Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 Category:Human proteins ",
