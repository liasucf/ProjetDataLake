    "text": "Est\u00eav\u00e3o de Brito (c. 15701641) was a Portuguese composer of polyphony. ==Life== Est\u00eav\u00e3o de Brito was born in Serpa, Portugal. He studied music at the Cathedral of \u00c9vora with Filipe de Magalh\u00e3es. In January 1597 he was already mestre de capela of the Cathedral of Badajoz (Spain), where he stayed until 1613. In that year, he went to the cathedral of M\u00e1laga and succeeded Francisco V\u00e1squez bearing the same office as Crist\u00f3bal de Morales, precisely 50 years before. He stayed in M\u00e1laga until his death in 1641. ==Work== It is known that de Brito composed numerous villancicos and can\u00e7onetas, most of them for the Christian feasts of Christmas and Corpus Christi. Unfortunately, these works were lost due to the devastation of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. However, the most relevant in de Brito's work are the liturgic pieces: 4-, 5-, 6-, and 8-voice masses, motets, psalms, and hymns. ==Recordings== *1993, Portuguese Renaissance Music, Voces Angelicae, Teldec Classics International 4509-93690-2 **includes 5 works by de Brito. * 1991, Lamentations, Oxford Camerata, Jeremy Summerly, Naxos - Early Music ** Lamentations of Jeremiah by White, Tallis, Lassus and Est\u00eav\u00e3o de Brito ==References== *Enciclop\u00e9dia Verbo Luso-Brasileira de Cultura, vol. 5, \"Brito (Est\u00eav\u00e3o de)\", ed.
