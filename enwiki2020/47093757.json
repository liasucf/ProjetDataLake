    "text": "The Northwest Arkansas Razorback Regional Greenway (usually shortened to Razorback Regional Greenway or just Greenway in Northwest Arkansas) is a primarily off-road shared-use trail in Northwest Arkansas. Dedicated on May 2, 2015, the Greenway connects Walker Park in Fayetteville, Arkansas to north of Lake Bella Vista in Bella Vista, Arkansas, while also serving schools, businesses and other cultural amenities along the route. ==History== First envisioned by the Northwest Arkansas Regional Planning Commission (NWARPC) during long-range planning that identified regional trails, the project came to fruition following the creation of a task force, public meetings, and coordination among NWA communities. Initially, the route was to follow three historically significant routes in NWA: the Butterfield Overland Mail route; Civil War routes; and the Trail of Tears in conjunction with the Arkansas Heritage Trails program. ===Funding=== A grant from the Walton Family Foundation in 2009 for up to $15 million ($ in current dollars) requiring 1-to-1 match from partner cities provided a revenue source for planning and design. The routing was also finalized during public meetings to serve many community attractions. A $15 million ($ in current dollars) Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration in 2010 assisted in right-of- way acquisition and construction of the project. The Arkansas State Highway Commission also provided $855,000 ($ in current dollars) to the project. ==Community attractions== The Greenway serves the following community attractions: * 6 downtowns * 23 schools * Campus of the University of Arkansas * 3 hospitals * Walmart, JB Hunt Transport Services and Tyson Foods corporate headquarters * Arts and entertainment venues such as Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art and the Walmart AMP * Historic sites * Parks and Playgrounds * Residential communities * Shopping areas such as Northwest Arkansas Mall and Pinnacle Hills Promenade ==See also== * ==References== Category:Bike paths in Arkansas Category:Transportation in Benton County, Arkansas Category:Transportation in Washington County, Arkansas Category:Long-distance trails in the United States Category:Protected areas of Benton County, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Washington County, Arkansas ",
