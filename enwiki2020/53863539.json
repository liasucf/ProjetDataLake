Xanadu Records Listing , accessed April 24, 2017Jazzlists: Xanadu Records discography accessed April 24, 2017Al Cohn catalog accessed April 24, 2017 ==Reception== Allmusic awarded the album 4 stars with its review by Scott Yanow stating \"the momentum and excitement of this encounter never slows down. Cohn and Rowles' swing-oriented styles, wit and ability to come up with fresh ideas on older songs are quite complementary; they continually bring out the best in each other. This highly recommended set is a real gem, a highpoint in both of the musicians' long careers\". In The Observer Dave Gelly wrote \"this is a beauty. Recorded in 1977 by a pair of battle-hardened jazz veterans, it\u2019s full of wit, musical sleight of hand and the kind of tough lyricism that grabs you by the ear and won\u2019t let go. ... What they do with six venerable standards and a blues speaks for the dedication and resilience of their whole generation\"Gelly, D.
