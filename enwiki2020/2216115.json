    "text": "The 1945\u20131946 season was the 66th season of competitive football in England. ==Overview== 1945\u201346 was the first peacetime football season since the 1939\u201340 season was cut short due to World War II. On 7 May (as the war was ending), it was announced that the FA Cup would be resumed, and that the 44 clubs in the top two divisions of the 1938\u201339 season would play in the Football League North and Football League South\u2018Association Football\u2019; The Times, 8 May 1945, p. 8 without promotion and relegation from the previous peacetime season. This arrangement was debated by the clubs over the following two months \u2013 with Wolverhampton Wanderers proposing an immediate return to a peacetime Football League as was to happen in France \u2013 before it was agreed at The Football League's annual meeting in London on 25 July that regional leagues should continue for one more season.\u2018Association Football \u2013 Plans for Next Season\u2019; The Times, 26 July 1945, p. 8 To make up for the lack of quality matches, all FA Cup rounds from round one up to and including the quarter-finals were made two-legged ties (rather than the traditional single matches) with the aggregate score determining who went through to the next round. Derby County eventually won the Cup. From the next season, a full football programme was restored, including The Football League and international matches. ==Honours== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Competition !Winner |- |FA Cup||Derby County (1) |- |Football League North||Sheffield United |- |Football League South||Birmingham City |} Notes = Number in parentheses is the times that club has won that honour. * indicates new record for competition ==See also== *England national football team results (unofficial matches) ==References== Category:Wartime seasons in English football ",
