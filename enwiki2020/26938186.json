    "text": "France was represented by Patrick Fiori, with the song '\"Mama Corsica\", at the 1993 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 15 May in Millstreet, Ireland. \"Mama Corsica\" was chosen internally by broadcaster France 2 and is notable as the first Eurovision entry to include segments sung in the Corsican language. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Fiori performed 12th in the running order, following Portugal and preceding Sweden. \"Mama Corsica\" marked a return to a more traditional style of French song following the country's pioneering exploration of Caribbean and North African musical styles and rhythms with their preceding three Eurovision entries. At the close of voting \"Mama Corsica\" had picked up 121 points (including maximum 12s from Denmark and Portugal), placing France fourth of the 25 entries. The French jury awarded its 12 points to Switzerland.ESC History - France 1993 ===Points awarded by France=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"gold\"|12 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"silver\"|10 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|8 points|| |- |width=20%|7 points|| |- |width=20%|6 points|| |- |width=20%|5 points|| |- |width=20%|4 points|| |- |width=20%|3 points|| |- |width=20%|2 points|| |- |width=20%|1 point|| |- |} ===Points awarded to France=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Points awarded to France |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * * |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * |- |} ==See also== *France in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1993 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1993 Category:France in the Eurovision Song Contest Euro ",
