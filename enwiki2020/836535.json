    "text": "Ba'al-Perazim (Hebrew Owner of Breakings Through) was a place in ancient Israel. It was the scene of a victory gained by David over the Philistines (2 Samuel 5:20; 1 Chronicles 14:11). It is called Mount Perazim in Isaiah 28:21. It was near the Valley of Rephaim, west of Jerusalem. Some scholars suggest a site 4 km northwest of Jerusalem, named Sheikh Bodr, to be identical with Ba'al-Perazim. There is also a valley near Mount Sodom in the Judaean Desert, called \"Wadi Perazim\". ==Etymology== It is not certain whether the occurrence in 2 Sam.5:20 name is: *(a) a word play - David is punning on an existing local name.Suggested by the use of Baal rather than El. cf entry in Brown Driver Briggs, Hebrew Lexicon. *(b) an anachronism - such as \"Abraham came to Dan\" Genesis 14:14. Yoshitaka Kobayashi considers it an anachronism,Yoshitaka Kobayashi, Baal-Perazim, entry in Anchor Bible Dictionary but the use of Baal rather than El may indicate a play on an existing local name. If the reference is to Mt. Perazim in Isaiah 28 then that suggests a mountain with a high ground position for David to attack. Alternatively, since David says \"Yahweh burst-through\" (\u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b7\u05e5 \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4) \"like bursting of waters\" (\u05e4\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05de\u05b8\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd) it may be a reference to waters. ==Cultural Influences== This place name is the origin of term \"God of the Breakthrough\" in the Gospel music song of that name by Robert Critchley, sung by Lara George. ==References== Category:Hebrew Bible places Category:Hebrew Bible battles ",
