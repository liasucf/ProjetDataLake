He was on the substitutes bench for Primera Divisi\u00f3n fixtures with V\u00e9lez Sarsfield, Estudiantes and Independiente across three seasons from 2010\u201311 but never made it onto the field of play. Mario Sciacqua awarded Comachi his professional bow on 12 October 2013 against All Boys, with the forward featuring twelve times in 2013\u201314 as Col\u00f3n suffered relegation. He spent the subsequent 2014 campaign on loan with San Jorge. Five appearances followed. In January 2016, Comachi joined Ecuadorian Serie B side Deportivo Quito. He scored once and appeared seven times in 2016. Comachi spent the 2016\u201317 season in Torneo Federal A with Sportivo Las Parejas, where he netted six total goals, which preceded him playing for fellow third tier outfit Uni\u00f3n Sunchales in 2017\u201318. On 12 June 2018, Comachi was signed by Villa D\u00e1lmine of Primera B Nacional. His first appearance came in a 3\u20130 victory over Instituto on 25 August, before his opening goal arrived on 15 September versus Mitre. A further goal came against Atl\u00e9tico de Rafaela, in the midst of twenty-two total appearances. July 2019 saw Comachi join Agropecuario. He'd score nine goals in nine different games before the season's early curtailment. On 9 October 2020, Comachi moved abroad for the second time in his career after signing for Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n side Danubio. ==Personal life== Comachi's brother, Lucas, is also a professional footballer; they were both produced by Col\u00f3n's youth system. Their father, Marcelo, also played football at pro level. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"7\"|Col\u00f3n |2010\u201311 |rowspan=\"4\"|Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2011\u201312 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2012\u201313 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2013\u201314 |12||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||12||0 |- |2014 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Nacional |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2015 |rowspan=\"1\"|Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !12!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!12!!0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|San Jorge (loan) |2014 |rowspan=\"1\"|Torneo Federal A |5||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||5||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Deportivo Quito |2016 |rowspan=\"1\"|Serie B |7||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||7||1 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Sportivo Las Parejas |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"2\"|Torneo Federal A |21||4||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2Appearance(s) in the Torneo Federal A play-offs||1||25||6 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Uni\u00f3n Sunchales |2017\u201318 |22||3||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0||28||3 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Villa D\u00e1lmine |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera B Nacional |19||2||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||22||2 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Agropecuario |2019\u201320 |17||9||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||17||9 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Danubio |2020 |rowspan=\"1\"|Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !103!!19!!9!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!4!!1!!116!!21 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Santa Fe, Argentina Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Ecuador Category:Expatriate footballers in Uruguay Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Ecuador Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Uruguay Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Torneo Federal A players Category:Ecuadorian Serie B players Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Col\u00f3n footballers Category:San Jorge de Tucum\u00e1n footballers Category:S.D.
