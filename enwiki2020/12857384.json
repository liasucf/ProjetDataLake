While in 2011 the opening and closing ceremonies was shifted to Netaji Indoor Stadium, Nandan remains the main centre for the festival. == History == The foundation stone of Nandan was laid by former Chief Minister of West Bengal Jyoti Basu in 1980 and it was inaugurated by film-maker Satyajit Ray on 2 September, 1985. He designed the now-famous logo for the complex as well. Initially, Nandan had two auditoriums, a third auditorium was made soon after. In April 2011, the false ceiling of a Nandan auditorium crashed down. Right after the incident, the West Bengal government decided to refurbish Nandan, starting the renovation work with the construction of a new false ceiling for Nandan I. For the first phase of the renovation project, West Government gave to the Nandan authorities. The restoration works completed weeks before the 2011 Kolkata International Film Festival. The Nandan committee is headed by Bengali film director Sandip Ray. Few other members of the managing committee are Aparna Sen, Prabhat Roy, Ranjit Mallick etc. === Nandan and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee === Ex Chief Minister of West Bengal Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has a long relation with Nandan.

After losing the 1982 assembly election from Cossipore, he did not come to Nandan till 1987, when he changed constituency to Jadavpur and after winning the election. After becoming the Chief Minister of West Bengal in 2001, he started visiting the auditorium more frequently. Till 1995 he did not have own room here. Then he got a 300 sqft carpeted room on Nandan's second floor. Here he often used to meet personalities like Sunil Gangopadhyay, Soumitra Chatterjee etc. and proofread his writings on Manik Bandopadhyay or Jibanananda Das. After being defeated at the 2011 assembly elections of West Bengal by the Trinamool congress candidate Manish Gupta, Bhattacharjee stopped coming here. According to a report published in The Telegraph in July 2011, two months after West Bengal's assembly elections, Bhattacharjee almost stopped visiting his favourite evening spot. === Arrest of artists during 2007 Kolkata International Film Festival === On 11 November 2007 afternoon, actors, artists and writers of West Bengal were demonstrating at a protest in Cathedral Road against Nandigram violence in which at least 14 people died. At the same time, the Kolkata International Film Festival was going on in the theatres on Nandan. Kolkata Police and Rapid Action Force personnel were sent to the spot who arrested nearly 100 protesters including 20 women. The list of people who were arrested on the day included actor Parambrata Chatterjee, actress Bidipta Chakraborty etc. They were released after five hours after a meeting between deputy commissioner (headquarters) Vineet Goyel and a group of protesters led by director Aparna Sen, Gautam Ghose and Bengali poet Sankha Ghosh. Later, actor Parambrata Chatterjee told that he could not figure out the reason of the arrest\u2014 \"I don\u2019t know on what grounds we were arrested. We did not step into Nandan, nor did we have any arms and ammunition. We were sitting outside the Academy of Fine Arts, singing.\" == Programs and festivals == Deceased poet Sunil Gangopadhyaya in Krittibash book stall in little magazine festival in Nandan Nandan has been a cultural hub of Kolkata for a long time.

Arekti Premer Golpo (2010), directed by Kaushik Ganguly, which dealt with homosexuality, was also barred at this theatre. Moinak Biswas, associate professor at Jadavpur University, whose film Sthaniyo Sangbad was disallowed in Nandan in 2010 commented\u2014 \"Since all these films, including mine, had a censor certificate, it wasn\u2019t Nandan's role to play super censor.\" In May 2013, the theatre refused to screen the Bengali film Kagojer Nouka directed by Partha Sarathi Jowardar. The film revolved around a chit fund scam. Jowardar told to media that they sent the movie to Nandan authority for preview but he thought he did not even see the film before barring it. == See also == * Priya Cinema (Kolkata) == References == ==External links== *Kolkata Film Festival Category:Tourist attractions in Kolkata Category:Culture of Kolkata Category:Buildings and structures in Kolkata Category:Cinemas in Kolkata Category:Arts centres in India Category:1985 establishments in India ",
