    "text": "Nadine Lehmann (born August 9, 1990) is a Swiss curler from Richigen. She is the former third for the Alina P\u00e4tz rink and with this rink won the 2015 World Women's Curling Championship. ==Career== Lehmann was an alternate on the 8th place Swiss team at the 2012 World Junior Curling Championships, though she didn't play in any games. Later that year she won a gold medal at the 2012 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship with Martin Rios. The pair would represent Switzerland again at the 2013 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship, but finished 6th. After juniors, Lehmann joined the Manuela Siegrist rink, playing second on the team. The team would play in two Grand Slam events, the 2012 Colonial Square Ladies Classic and the 2012 ROGERS Masters of Curling. Lehmann and Siegrist's third, Alina P\u00e4tz formed a new rink in 2013. The team won the Swiss women's curling championship in 2015, defeating Silvana Tirinzoni in the final. This qualified them to represent Switzerland at the 2015 World Women's Curling Championship, Lehmann's first Worlds. At the Worlds, they would win the gold medal, defeating Canada's Jennifer Jones in the final. The team also won two World Curling Tour events during the 2014-15 season, winning the Red Deer Curling Classic and the International Bernese Ladies Cup. The team also played in two Grand Slam events, making the quarter finals at the 2014 Masters of Curling and missing the playoffs by one game at the 2014 Colonial Square Ladies Classic. They would represent Switzerland at the 2015 European Curling Championships, finding less success, placing just sixth place. The team returned to the World Championships in 2017, placing 8th. After the team didn't win the Swiss Championship in 2018, the P\u00e4tz rink disbanded as Lehmann and teammates Marisa Winkelhausen and Nicole Schw\u00e4gli wanted to step back from competitive curling. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1990 births Category:Swiss female curlers Category:Living people Category:People from Worb Category:World curling champions Category:Swiss curling champions Category:World mixed doubles curling champions ",
