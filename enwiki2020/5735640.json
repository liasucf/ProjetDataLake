    "text": "Amanda Miguel (born 1 June 1956) is an Argentine singer. ==Early life== Miguel was born in Gaiman, in the Chubut Province in Argentina, June 1, 1956. ==Career== At 17, she met Diego Verdaguer, a man 5 years her senior, whom she would later marry. At this time, Diego was already an established artist, and she joined his musical group called Mediterr\u00e1neo. The group enjoyed success in Los Angeles, California, but after being discovered by a Univision network record executive, she launched her own solo career with help from San Diego. Miguel's first album, El Sonido Vol. 1, was recorded in 1981, and released a year later. Implementing a different sound and style than Mediterr\u00e1neo, her album was a success. Follow-up albums were released a year later. Songs during this period, such as Asi No Te Amara Jamas, \u00c9l Me Minti\u00f3 (1981), and Mi Buen Coraz\u00f3n (1982) have become staples of Los Angeles radio stations for KRCD-FM Recuerdo 103.9/98.3 FM. The birth of her and Verdaguer's daughter, Ana Victoria, led Miguel to break from the recording studio and focus on motherhood. She would return to the music scene in 1987, with her fourth album, El Pecado. In 1989 she recorded her fifth studio album, El rostro del Amor, with lyrics by Anahi van Zandweghe. Its title song was chosen to greet Pope John Paul II in his visit to Mexico. For her sixth album, Rompecorazones, she delved in the world of ranchero music. Under the supervision of composer Federico Mendez, he chose her songs, including the title song, which became great hits. In 1996, Miguel traveled to Italy where she recorded Amame una vez m\u00e1s, also with lyrics by Anahi in the title song and most of the others. The album was released the same year and was met with critical praise and highly positive sales in the United States and Latin America. The title track was nominated for a Lo Nuestro Award for Pop Song of the Year. She returned in 1998 to record once more. The album 5 Dias was released the following year. It included a remake of the song \"As\u00ed Como Hoy\", which Diego produced. In 2005, she released her album Piedra de Afilar. This album brought in newcomer, multi-instrumentalist David Snow as a co-producer with her longtime husband/producer Diego Verdaguer. This album shows Amanda to be looking ahead to a more modern sound without losing the polished productions and fabulous songs that made her famous. This album also contains a long-awaited duet between Miguel and Diego, \"Siempre Fuimos Dos\", penned by David Snow, Diego Verdaguer and Miguel, with lyrics by Anahi, who also wrote all the other lyrics in the album. ==Studio albums== *1981 - El Sonido Volumen I *1983 - El Sonido Volumen II *1984 - El Ultimo Sonido Volumen III *1987 - El Pecado *1989 - El Rostro Del Amor *1992 - Rompecorazones *1996 - Amame Una Vez Mas *1999 - 5 Dias *2004 - Feliz Navidad A Toda La Humanidad *2005 - Serie Plantino 20 Exitos de Amanda Miguel *2006 - Piedra de Afilar *2006 - El Rostro del Amor (CD + DVD) [Re-Edicion] *2007 - Latin Classics Amanda Miguel *2007 - Piedra de Afilar (CD + Multimedia) [Re-Edicion] *2008 - Anillo de Compromiso *2011 - El Sonido Volumen I (2011 Remasterizado) *2013 - El Sonido Volumen II (2013 Remasterizado) *2014 - El Ultimo Sonido Volumen III (2014 Remasterizado) *2015 - 80*15 ==Compilations and singles== *1980 - Papa, Cuando Regreses - \"Tengo que confesar que lo amaba\" (Single) *1981 - As\u00ed No Te Amar\u00e1 Jam\u00e1s - Quiero Un Amor Total *1981 - \u00c9l Me Minti\u00f3 - Amanda Al Piano *1982 - Mi Buen Coraz\u00f3n - Hagamos Un Trato *1983 - \u00bfQuien Ser\u00e1? - Siempre Te Amare *1983 - Castillos - Un D\u00eda De Estos *1983 - Como Un T\u00edtere - Poquito A Poco *1983 - Cosquillas En El Pecho - Igual Que Un Avi\u00f3n *1984 - El Gato Y Yo - \u00bfA Donde Va? *1987 - \u00bfQu\u00e9 Me Das?
