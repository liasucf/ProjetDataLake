    "text": "Haramiyidans were a long lived lineage of mammaliaform cynodonts or mammals. Their teeth, which are by far the most common remains, resemble those of the multituberculates. However, based on Haramiyavia, the jaw is less derived; and at the level of evolution of earlier basal mammals like Morganucodon and Kuehneotherium, with a groove for ear ossicles on the dentary.Butler PM, 2000 If they are early multituberculates, they would be the longest lived mammalian clade of all time. However, a more recent study, in November 2015, may dispute this and suggested the Haramiyida were not crown mammals, but were part of an earlier offshoot of mammaliaformes instead. ==Relationships== Haramiyids show certain similarities to multituberculates, a group of mammals that survived until about 40 million years ago. It is possible that haramiyids are ancestral to multituberculates, although the available evidence is insufficient to be conclusive. Certain characteristics of the teeth seem to rule out a special relationship between the two groups,Monastersky 1996, p.379 although some studies still unite haramiyids (or at least euharamiyids) and multituberculates in the Allotheria hypothesis.Butler & Hooker 2005, p.206 Most recently, haramiyidans have been found to be a monophyletic group of non- mammalian Mammaliaformes. In this study, gondwanatheres \u2013 usually interpreted as mammals, and derived multituberculates in particular \u2013 have been found to be deeply nested among them.Huttenlocker, Adam K.; Grossnickle, David M.; Kirkland, Jam,es I.; Schultz, Julia A.; Luo, Zhe-Xi (23 May 2018). \"Late- surviving stem mammal links the lowermost Cretaceous of North America and Gondwana\".

Grossnickle, P. David Polly, Mammal disparity decreases during the Cretaceous angiosperm radiation, Published 2 October 2013.DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2013.2110 At least some species were very good climbers and were similar to modern day squirrels; and several others have more recently been reassessed as possibly arboreal. General arboreal habits might explain their rarity in the fossil record.Jing Meng, Mesozoic mammals of China: implications for phylogeny and early evolution of mammals, Natl Sci Rev (December 2014) 1 (4): 521-542. doi: 10.1093/nsr/nwu070 First published online: October 17, 2014 Several haramiyidans, Maiopatagium, Xianshou, Vilevolodon and Arboroharamiya, took it one step further and developed the ability to glide, having extensive membranes similar to those of modern colugos. In many of these taxa, the coracoid bones (absent in modern therians but present in many other mammal groups, albeit highly reduced) are remarkably large and similar to those of birds and pterosaurs, presumably due to impact stresses at landing.Qing-Jin Meng; David M. Grossnickle; Di Liu; Yu-Guang Zhang; April I. Neander; Qiang Ji; Zhe-Xi Luo (2017). \"New gliding mammaliaforms from the Jurassic\". Nature. in press. doi:10.1038/nature23476.A Jurassic gliding euharamiyidan mammal with an ear of five auditory bones, Nature doi:10.1038/nature24483 Mammalian tooth marks on dinosaur bones may belong to Sineleutherus, suggesting that some haramiyidans scavenged on dinosaur remains.https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00114-020-01688-9 ==Range== Most fossils have been reported from Europe, but some are known from Africa and Greenland. Since 2005, the published range extended to Mongolia and China. The age of haramiyid fossils range from Upper Triassic up to Late Cretaceous. This has important implications: the fact that haramiyids were present in the Late Triassic supports the idea that crown-group mammals originated at least 208 million years ago, much earlier than some previous research suggests. The youngest haramiyid fossil genus is Avashishta bacharamensis from the Maastrichtian of India. Cretaceous haramiyids are previously known from the Early Cretaceous of Morocco, suggesting that these animals may have survived in gondwannan landmasses as relics; the presence of the similarly aged Cifelliodon in North America suggests that contact between both landmasses remained for a while. With a temporal range of at least 150 million years, they are the longest lived mammaliaform lineage.Ashok Sahni, New evidence for palaeogeographic intercontinental Gondwana relationships based on Late Cretaceous-Earliest Palaeocene coastal faunas from peninsular India, Washington DC American Geophysical Union Geophysical Monograph Series 01/1987; 41:207\u2013218. ==Notes== ==External links== * Palaeos, Mammaliaformes: Allotheria * John H Burkitt, Mammals, A World Listing of Living and Extinct Species.
