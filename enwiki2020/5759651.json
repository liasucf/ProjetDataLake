Due to excessive carrying capacity and persistently extreme sea water temperatures for the last six months, the Payar Island Marine Park suffered from widespread coral bleaching at a critical level. The corals there are now dull whitish-grey/black and not the bright rainbow of colours they once were. Even marine life density around the area has been recorded to be significantly lesser compared to previous years. The Department of Marine Park Kedah has taken drastic action by closing the affected areas in order to minimize human aggravated stress on the corals. The closed areas are the Payar Marine Park Center and the famous Coral Garden. No snorkeling and diving activities are allowed in these areas up till today. The mass bleaching became even more severe by 2016 due to the prolonged El Nino phenomenon which started in mid 2015 affecting more than half the reefs in Thailand and Peninsular Malaysian waters. == References == == External links == * Tourism Malaysia - Payar Island Marine Park Category:Islands of Kedah ",
