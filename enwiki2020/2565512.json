    "text": "Line of Fire is an American crime drama television series that was broadcast on ABC for 11 episodes from December 2, 2003 to May 30, 2004 during the winter of 2003-2004. It starred Leslie Bibb and Jeffrey D. Sams. The show was canceled after just 11 episodes in June 2004, though 13 episodes in all were produced. == Plot == Two rookie FBI agents (Leslie Bibb and Jeffrey D. Sams) are assigned to the bureau's Richmond, Virginia field office, where their story parallels that of a local mob boss, Jonah Malloy (David Paymer). When a fellow agent is murdered in a shootout with the gangsters, the head of the FBI branch (Leslie Hope) declares an all-out war on the criminal underworld. The following episodes weaved intricately between Bibb and Sams' federal agency and Paymer's gang, though the two storylines rarely met head-on, except when occasionally focusing on an undercover agent (Anson Mount). Mob boss Jonah Malloy's signature line was \"That's that with that.\" ==Cast== *Leslie Bibb as Paige Van Doren *David Paymer as Jonah Malloy *Anson Mount as Roy Ravelle *Leslie Hope as Lisa Cohen *Jeffrey D.
