Mid-Continent Conference logo, 1982\u20132007 === Changes and the addition of women's sports === The conference saw its first changes in the early 1990s. Southwest Missouri State departed for membership in the Missouri Valley Conference as the University of Akron and Northern Illinois University joined in 1990. Then Wright State University joined in 1991 as Northern Iowa followed Southwest Missouri State to the MVC. Major changes came to the conference in 1992. First, Akron left for the Mid-American Conference (MAC) and another Ohio school, Youngstown State University, replaced it. More significantly, the Mid-Continent added women's sports by absorbing the North Star Conference (NSC), a women's-only league whose final seven members were in the Mid-Continent. All of the final NSC members except for Akron moved their women's sports into the Mid-Continent. At the same time, Eastern Illinois and Western Illinois moved their women's sports into the Mid-Continent when their former women's sports home, the Gateway Conference, merged into the Missouri Valley Conference. The University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee joined the Mid- Continent a year later. === Horizon and ECC transitions === In 1994, charter members Cleveland State University, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and the University of Wisconsin\u2013Green Bay, as well as newer members Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, Northern Illinois, and Wright State left the conference to join the Midwestern Collegiate Conference, now known as the Horizon League. The Mid-Continent absorbed Central Connecticut State University, Chicago State University, the University at Buffalo, Troy State University (now Troy University), and Northeastern Illinois University from the collapsed East Coast Conference in response. None of these institutions remain in the league. Missouri-Kansas City, formerly an independent, also joined the Mid-Continent Conference in 1994. === Declining membership === Eastern Illinois moved to the Ohio Valley Conference in 1996, reducing membership to nine programs. Troy State departed for the Trans America Athletic Conference while Central Connecticut joined the Northeast Conference in 1997. Buffalo joined the MAC in 1998 while Northeastern Illinois ceased intercollegiate athletics at that time. Oral Roberts University and Southern Utah University replaced the former pair while Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) and Oakland University moved into the latter duo's spots a year later. Youngstown State switched to the Horizon League in 2001, and Centenary College replaced it in 2003. Chicago State University announced in the spring of 2006 that it would withdraw from the conference to compete as an independent starting in the 2006-07 school year. Charter member Valparaiso University then moved to the Horizon in 2007. === Renewed expansion and contraction === Conference expansion was discussed at length at the Mid-Continent Conference annual Presidents Council meeting in 2006, and Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW, now Purdue Fort Wayne), North Dakota State, and South Dakota State were approved for site visits. On August 30, 2006, IPFW accepted an invitation to join the Mid-Continent Conference as a full member starting July 1, 2007.Press Release. IPFW accepts invitation to join Mid-Continent Conference , Mid-Continent Conference, August 30, 2006.

The Summit League continued its renewed expansion push with the admission of the University of South Dakota. The Coyotes began conference play in the 2011\u201312 academic year and become eligible for all championships the following season. Centenary College subsequently announced that it would leave the Summit League following the 2010\u20132011 campaign. The University of North Dakota had also been openly rumored to have been courted by the Summit League, but controversy over the Fighting Sioux nickname in all likelihood prevented UND's admission at that time. Expectations that UND would join the Summit League came to an end on November 1, 2010, when North Dakota instead accepted an invitation to join the Big Sky Conference. The University of South Dakota entered into very brief negotiations to join the Big Sky as well, rather than continuing their plans to join the Summit. However, South Dakota chose instead to remain with the more compact Summit League (along with other Dakota schools, NDSU and SDSU). As the University of Nebraska Omaha began the transition to Division I athletics in all sports, it joined the Summit League on July 1, 2012. With the departures of Centenary to Division III at the end of the 2010-11 athletic year, and Southern Utah and Oral Roberts for other Division I conferences at the end of the 2011-12 athletic year, the Summit League continued with nine institutions, all within the Midwest geographical region. The conference unveiled the University of Denver (DU) as its 10th member on November 27, 2012, and the Pioneers joined in July 2013. While Denver is slightly outside The Summit's current Midwestern base, the city's status as a major air hub seemingly minimized travel issues for the other members. With Denver among the eight of ten WAC members switching to other conferences, that league searched for new members. UMKC announced on February 7, 2013, that it would be one of six schools joining the WAC for the 2013-14 season, dropping the Summit league back to nine member schools. Membership fell to eight schools on May 7, 2013, when Oakland announced that it was joining the Horizon League. Eight of the nine then-current Horizon League programs were former Summit League members with Oakland's move (the Horizon has since added two more members that were never in The Summit League, Northern Kentucky and Robert Morris, as well as another former Summit member in Purdue Fort Wayne). In December 2013, The Summit League office announced that Oral Roberts University returned to the conference in all sports, effective July 1, 2014. The next changes to the conference's core membership were announced in 2017. First, on January 26, North Dakota, which had resolved its controversy by selecting the new nickname Fighting Hawks, unveiled as a new member beginning in 2018. Then, on June 28, IUPUI announced it would leave the conference to join the Horizon League effective July 1, 2017. For much of 2018, speculation involving further league expansion focused on Augustana University, a Division II school located in the Summit's headquarters city of Sioux Falls. Many of the school's boosters have ties to Sanford Health, a hospital company that has long been a major league sponsor and also owns the office complex that houses the league headquarters. The university announced on December 14 that it would start a transition to Division I, though stating at the time that no such move would take place until at least 2021. The conference expanded anyway, announcing in June 2019 that UMKC would return in 2020 after a seven-year absence. However, shortly thereafter, Purdue Fort Wayne announced its 2020 departure for the Horizon League, maintaining the full-time conference membership at nine schools. Then, on October 4, 2019, the University of St. Thomas, a Minnesota school that was set to be expelled from its longtime athletic home of the NCAA Division III Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) in 2021, announced that it received an invitation to join the Summit upon its MIAC departure. St. Thomas eventually received a waiver of an NCAA rule mandating that Division III schools can only transition to Division II, allowing the school to move directly to D-I on the originally announced schedule. Shortly before St. Thomas' future conference membership was confirmed, the University of Northern Colorado was announced as a baseball-only member effective in 2021\u201322. ===Membership timeline=== PlotArea = right:20 left:0 bottom:50 top:5 #> to display a count on left side of graph, use \"left:20\" to suppress the count, use \"left:20\"<# ImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:20 DateFormat = yyyy Period = from:1982 till:2022 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal Colors = id:barcolor value:rgb(0.99,0.7,0.7) id:line value:black id:bg value:white id:Full value:rgb(0.792,0.727,0.752) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in all sports id:FullxF value:rgb(0.551,0.824,0.777) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in all sports except for football id:AssocF value:rgb(0.98,0.5,0.445) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member for football only id:AssocOS value:rgb(0.5,0.611,0.824) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in some sports, but not all (consider identifying in legend or a footnote) id:OtherC1 value:rgb(0.996,0.996,0.699) # Use this color to denote a team that has moved to another conference id:OtherC2 value:rgb(0.988,0.703,0.383) # Use this color to denote a team that has moved to another conference where OtherC1 has already been used, to distinguish the two PlotData = color:FullxF width:15 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s bar:1 color:Full from:1982 till:1985 text:Southwest Missouri State (1982\u20131990) bar:1 color:FullxF from:1985 till:1990 bar:2 color:Full from:1982 till:1985 text:Northern Iowa (1982\u20131991) bar:2 color:FullxF from:1985 till:1991 bar:3 color:FullxF from:1982 till:1994 text:Cleveland State (1982\u20131994) bar:4 color:FullxF from:1982 till:1994 text:UIC (1982\u20131994) bar:5 color:FullxF from:1982 till:1994 text:Green Bay (1982\u20131994) bar:6 color:Full from:1982 till:1985 text:Eastern Illinois (1982\u20131996) bar:6 color:FullxF from:1985 till:1996 bar:6 color:AssocOS from:2005 till:end text:(2005\u2013present, swimming & diving; 2011\u2013present, men's soccer) bar:7 color:FullxF from:1982 till:2007 text:Valparaiso (1982\u20132007) bar:7 shift:(-120,-5) color:AssocOS from:2017 till:end text:(2017\u2013present; men's swimming; 2017\u20132020, men's tennis) bar:8 color:Full from:1982 till:1985 text:Western Illinois (1982\u2013present) bar:8 color:FullxF from:1985 till:end bar:9 color:FullxF from:1990 till:1992 text:Akron (1990\u20131992) bar:10 color:FullxF from:1990 till:1994 text:Northern Illinois (1990\u20131994) bar:11 color:FullxF from:1991 till:1994 text:Wright State (1991\u20131994) bar:12 color:AssocOS from:1992 till:1999 text:DePaul (1992\u20131999, softball) bar:13 color:FullxF from:1992 till:2001 text:Youngstown State (1992\u20132001) bar:14 color:FullxF from:1993 till:1994 text:Milwaukee (1993\u20131994) bar:15 color:FullxF from:1994 till:1997 text:Central Connecticut State (1994\u20131997) bar:16 color:FullxF from:1994 till:1997 text:Troy State (1994\u20131997) bar:17 color:FullxF from:1994 till:1998 text:Buffalo (1994\u20131998) bar:18 color:FullxF from:1994 till:1998 text:Northeastern Illinois (1994\u20131998) bar:19 color:FullxF from:1994 till:2006 text:Chicago State (1994\u20132006) bar:20 color:FullxF from:1994 till:2013 text:Kansas City (1994\u20132013, 2020\u2013present) bar:20 color:FullxF from:2020 till:end bar:21 color:AssocOS from:1994 till:1998 text:C.
