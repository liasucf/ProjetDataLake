    "text": "Ahmad Khani, also spelled Ahmad-i Khani (; 1650, Hakkari \u2013 1707, Do\u011fubayaz\u0131t), was a Kurdish writer, poet, astronomer and philosopher. He was born amongst the Khani's tribe in Hakkari province in present-day Turkey. He moved to Bayezid in Ritkan province and settled there. Later he started with teaching Kurdish (Kurmanji) at basic level. Khani was fluent in Kurdish, Arabic and Persian. He wrote his Arabic-Kurdish dictionary \"N\u00fbbihara Bi\u00e7\u00fbkan\" (The Spring of Children) in 1683 to help children with their learning process. His most important work is the Kurdish classic love story \"Mem and Zin\" (Mem \u00fb Z\u00een) (1692), which has been translated to many languages including Arabic, Russian and Turkish. This epic has several facets and has been interpreted from different angles, but one its most important parts is its preface in which Khani calls for a Kurdish state. Therefore, many consider Mam and Zin to be the first expression of Kurdish nationalism. His other work include a book called Eq\u00eedeya \u00ceman\u00ea (The Path of Faith), which is part poem and part prose. The book explains the five pillars of Islamic faith. It was published in 2000 in Sweden. ==Biography== ==Works== ===Books=== * Mem \u00fb Z\u00een (Mem and Zin), see for its French translation, see for its English translation, * Eq\u00eedeya \u00ceman\u00ea (The Path of Faith) * Eq\u00eedeya \u00ceslam\u00ea (Basics of Islam) * N\u00fbbihara Bi\u00e7\u00fbkan (The Spring of Children) * Erd\u00ea Xweda (Astronomy and Geography book) * D\u00eewana Helbestan ==References and notes== ==See also== * Kurdish literature * Kurdish language * Kurmanji ==External links== * * Ahmad Khani, Kurdish Academy of Language KAL * Our Trouble by Ehmed\u00ea Xan\u00ee, Noahs Ark Holidays * Ahmad Khani, Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica Khani, Ahmad Category:Kurdish-language poets Category:Kurdish-language writers Category:Kurdish scholars Category:Kurdish philosophers Category:Kurdish astronomers Category:Kurdish scientists Category:Kurdish historians Category:Kurdish people of the Ottoman Empire Category:1650 births Category:1707 deaths Category:Lexicographers Category:People from Hakk\u00e2ri Province ",
