According to Great Island Tours, a book published by the local library, Templerobin is mentioned in records dated 1302 and 1652 but by 1774 it was reported as being in ruins.Great Island Tours, A Cobh Museum Publication, 2nd Edition, 2000, Cobh Ballymore has a small Roman Catholic Church and is served by the school of the adjoining twin village of Walterstown, the two being townlands which jointly make up the village of Ballymore.
