In 1976, Manly claimed the minor premiership and reached the grand final against the Parramatta Eels who were playing in their first ever grand final. Willoughby was selected to play from the bench. In the grand final itself, Parramatta went into half time level with Manly at 7\u20137. In the second half and with 10 minutes remaining, Parramatta made a play to the right hand side of the field and the ball eventually reached Neville Glover. With the try line wide open, Glover dropped the ball over the line which would have given Parramatta the match winning try. In the final five minutes Manly held on after a Parramatta onslaught to win the premiership 13\u201310. In 1978, Willoughby missed the entire season through injury as Manly won their 4th premiership defeating Cronulla in the grand final.
