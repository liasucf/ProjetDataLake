    "text": "Brice Hortefeux (born 11 May 1958) is a conservative French politician. He was Minister of the Interior, Overseas Territories and Territorial collectivities. He was previously Minister for Labour, Labour Relations, the Family, Solidarity and Urban Affairs and Minister-Delegate for Local Government at the Ministry of the Interior and was a Member of the European Parliament. ==Background== Hortefeux was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine but was raised in Auvergne. He is one of the most loyal political allies, and personal friend, of French president Nicolas Sarkozy. He is the godfather of one of Nicolas Sarkozy's sons. On 18 May 2007, he was appointed as the first Minister of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Cooperative Development in the government of Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon. As such he has boosted the numbers of illegal immigrants forcibly repatriated from France, extended the network of detention centres (established also outside the larger conurbations in smaller cities such as Blois) and modified the rights of individuals and organizations which visit them. He is in favor of controls on immigration. He was the promoter of a law that toughens conditions of political asylum in France. He believes that France has a right to expel or welcome immigrants on a discretionary basis, citing as evidence the high unemployment and criminality rates of foreigners. He also points to the geographical concentration of foreigners in a small number of towns as evidence that they are not integrated in the country. As he declared in the newspaper Le Parisien on 8 November 2007: \"France has the right to choose which immigrants it can accommodate... Let's muster the courage to face our problems! Do you find it normal that 60% of immigrants are concentrated in only 3 of our 22 regions? That the unemployment rate of these people is 22% and that their children are dropping out of school? No, we will not accept this.\".Le Parisien, 8 octobre 2007 On M6's TV show Capital, when asked if there were illegal immigrants in France, he replied: \"If you dream of a country where there are only honest and clean citizens... In reality, it's a constant struggle.\" The 4 June 2010 a French court has fined him 750 euros for making racist comments about a young party activist of Algerian origin. But the court did not issue a criminal conviction, judging that Hortefeux had not intended the comments to be heard in public. In August 2010 following an earlier fatal incident involving travellers and gendarmerie at Th\u00e9s\u00e9e, near St. Aignan, Loir et Cher, Hortefeux has vigorously pursued a policy of destroying illegal travellers' camps and imposing conditions for voluntary repatriations of Roma (or gypsies) to Romania and Bulgaria, a considerable number of which are in progress. A circular emanating from his office (chef de cabinet: Michel Bart) on 5 August 2010, specifically mentioning an ethnic criterion for these deportations provoked the ire of ministerial colleagues such as Eric Besson and the European commissioner, Viviane Reding. An eirenic exchange with Cardinal Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois, the President of the French Bishops' Conference, representing contrasting reactions within the Catholic community, also ensued. ==Career== * Degree in private law (1982) * Master's degree in public law (1984) * Studied in Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po)But did not graduate, see (in French) http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/18/un-soupcon-de-vantardise-sur- les-cv-ministeriels * Local authority administrator (1986\u20131994) (worked in Neuilly-sur-Seine for mayor Nicolas Sarkozy) * Prefect, given responsibility for a government public service mission (1995) * Special adviser in the office of the President of the Senate (1998\u20131999) * Head of office of the Minister for the Budget and Communications and government spokesman (1993\u20131995) Governmental functions *Minister of the Interior, Overseas, Local Authorities and Immigration : 2010\u20132011. *Minister of the Interior, Overseas and Local authorities : 2009\u20132010. *Minister of Labor, Family and Social Affairs, Solidarity and the City : January\u2013June 2009. *Minister for Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Development Solidarity : 2007\u20132009. *Minister of Territorial collectivities : 2005\u20132007.

During his time at the European Parliament, he sat on the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade, was a substitute for the Committee on Budgets and was a member of the delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries and the Arab Maghreb Union. ==Political stances== Hortefeux is a supporter of immigrant repatriation from France. He has supported and incentivised voluntary return, in his role as Immigration Minister of France, for immigrant families. In 2007, enhancing the offer to \u20ac6,000 per family to leave the country, he claimed that the French government \"must increase this measure to help voluntary return\". == Racism == On 10 September 2009, Le Monde disclosed a video showing Hortefeux at the UMP Summer School in Seignosse, France, on Saturday, 5 September 2009. As he posed for a photograph with a young man of Arabic origin, the following conversation can be heard (translation): > Female voice \u2013 He is Catholic, he eats pork and drinks beer! > Hortefeux \u2013 Oh really? Well, he does not match the prototype at all! > Female voice \u2013 He is one of us... he is our little Arab. > Hortefeux \u2013 We always need one! When there is only one, it's okay. It's when > there are many that problems begin. In June 2010, a French court found Hortefeux guilty of a racial insult, and fined him 750 euros with an order to donate 2,000 euros to an anti-racism group. Hortefeux' lawyer said that they would appeal the ruling. ==2010 cargo plane bomb plot == On 4 November 2010, Hortefeux said that one of the two bombs in the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot was defused just 17 minutes before it was set to explode. ==See also== * Alleged Libyan interference in the 2007 French elections == References == ==External links== * * Declaration of financial interests (in French; PDF file) * Police question Sarkozy's former interior minister, Brice Hortefeux RFI English Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:People from Neuilly-sur-Seine Category:Rally for the Republic politicians Category:Union for a Popular Movement politicians Category:The Republicans (France) politicians Category:The Strong Right Category:French interior ministers Category:French Ministers of Overseas France Category:MEPs for France 1999\u20132004 Category:MEPs for Massif- central\u2013Centre 2004\u20132009 Category:MEPs for Massif-central\u2013Centre 2009\u20132014 Category:MEPs for Massif-central\u2013Centre 2014\u20132019 Category:MEPs for France 2019\u20132024 Category:The Republicans (France) MEPs Category:Saint-Jean de Passy alumni Category:Sciences Po alumni Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Regional councillors of Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Category:French politicians convicted of crimes ",
