    "text": "Feuilletine Feuilletine, or paillet\u00e9 feuilletine (), is a crispy confection made from thin, sweetened cr\u00eapes. The cr\u00eape batter is baked for a few minutes, and the cr\u00eapes are allowed to cool; as they cool, they become crisp. In French, these crispy cr\u00eapes are called cr\u00eapes gavottes or cr\u00eapes dentelles; but when crumbled into small shards, they become feuilletine. Feuilletine is decorative and has a buttery flavour, but it is especially valued for the unique texture it adds to dishes. It is sometimes incorporated into praline, hazelnut paste, and other nut pastes. Although feuilletine is produced commercially, it was originally conceived as a way for a p\u00e2tisserie to make use of cookie scraps. ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:French confectionery Category:P\u00e2tisserie ",
