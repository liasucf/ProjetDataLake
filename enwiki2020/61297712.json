    "text": "Norma W. Andrews is a cell biologist and professor at the University of Maryland Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics. She chaired the department from 2009 to 2014. ==Education and career== Norma Andrews received her B.S. in 1977 and Ph.D. in 1983, both from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. She then went on to a postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratory of Victor Nussenzweig at New York University, which she completed in 1990. She then began her own laboratory at Yale University as an assistant professor. In 2010, Andrews moved her lab to the University of Maryland to chair the Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics. She stepped down from that position in 2014. ==Research== Andrews' research has focused on cell biology of and in response to the parasitic eukaryote Trypanosoma cruzi. Her group is known for discovering and characterizing calcium-dependendent exocytosis of lysosomes in mammalian cells, and its role in repair of the plasma membrane. ==Notable publications== *Idone V, Tam C...
