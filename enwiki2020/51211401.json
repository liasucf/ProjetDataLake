The restaurant's revolving part has a diameter of about 16 feet (5 meters) with a seating capacity for 162 guests, the office building has a total height of 25 floors and 298 feet (91 meters) including an observation deck at the top. The rotational speed was 1 rotation per hour. ==History== The building was designed by John Graham Jr. of the architectural firm John Graham & Company. The building was completed in 1960 and inaugurated 21 November 1961. At that time, it was the highest building in Honolulu. Graham later received a patent for the revolving design in 1964 (US patent-nr 3125189patent Graham 1964 Google patents (accessdate 31 July 2016)). Later, the restaurant changed the name to \"Windows of Hawaii\" but closed completely in the mid-1990s. The premises were converted to office space and the floor was welded into place. One revolving restaurant remains in Hawaii, called Top of Waikiki. ==References== ==External links== *close-up La Ronde (Flickr) *close-up (Waymarking) *image (Flickr) *image (Star Advertiser) *image (Flickr) *over view image (Flickr) *over view image (Historic Hawai\u2018i Foundation) *images collection *image (1962, Hawaiian Church Chronicle) Category:1961 establishments in Hawaii Category:Buildings and structures in Honolulu Category:Landmarks in Hawaii Category:Tourist attractions in Honolulu Category:Buildings and structures with revolving restaurants Category:1990s disestablishments in Hawaii Category:Restaurants established in 1961 ",
