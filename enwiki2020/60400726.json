He has written songs for Florida Georgia Line, Chris Lane, Blake Shelton, Dallas Smith, and Morgan Wallen, and has released his own music through Big Loud Records. ==Biography== Michael Hardy was born in Philadelphia, Mississippi. He attended Middle Tennessee State University, where he got a degree in songwriting. After moving to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue songwriting, he became a writing partner of the duo Florida Georgia Line. Among the songs that Hardy wrote include \"Up Down\" by Morgan Wallen. Due to the song's success and encouragment from record producer Joey Moi, Hardy was signed to Big Loud Records in 2018. In October 2018, he released an EP titled This Ole Boy, which he supported by joining Wallen's If I Know Me Tour. This was followed in 2019 by the single \"Rednecker\", and a second EP titled Where to Find Me. To support the EP, Hardy joined Florida Georgia Line on their Can't Say I Ain't Country Tour. Hardy also co-wrote Florida Georgia Line's singles \"Simple\" and \"Talk You Out of It\", Blake Shelton's singles \"God's Country\" and \"Hell Right\", \"Drop\" by Dallas Smith, Chris Lane's single \"I Don't Know About You\", and Jameson Rodgers' debut single \"Some Girls\". In September 2019, Hardy released a collaborative album titled Hixtape, Vol. 1, which featured a total of 17 artists including Thomas Rhett, Keith Urban, Tracy Lawrence, Jake Owen, Trace Adkins, Joe Diffie, Zakk Wylde, Cole Swindell, Dustin Lynch, and Morgan Wallen. Hardy was set to be on tour with Thomas Rhett in 2020 for Rhett's Center Point Road Tour, but the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Personal life== Hardy has been dating Caleigh Ryan since 2018.Instagram @hardy ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:8em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:21em;\"| Album details ! colspan=\"5\"| Peak chart positions |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US Country ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US Indie ! style=\"width:4em;\"| CAN ! style=\"width:4em\"| AUS Country |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hixtape, Vol. 1 | * Released: September 13, 2019 * Label: Big Loud Records | 35 | \u2014 | 34 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| A Rock | * Released: September 4, 2020 * Label: Big Loud Records | 24 | 4 | 4 | 34 | 20 |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
