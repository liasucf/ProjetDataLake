    "text": "Ali Kaaf (born 1977) is a German-Syrian visual artist. His style focuses on pictorial language connecting the worlds of Beirut, Berlin, and the USA. == Education == Kaaf studied Visual Art from 1994 to 1998 at the Institut des Beaux-Arts in Beirut and from 2000 to 2005 at the Universit\u00e4t der K\u00fcnste Berlin (UdK) under professors Marwan Kassab-Bachi and Rebecca Horn. ==Career== Kaaf is influenced by European and Arab cultures and art traditions. His abstract art is inspired by important locations in his life\u2014Damascus, Beirut, and Berlin\u2014and concepts such as Sufi mysticism and Islamic philosophy. Balance between meditation and returning to everyday life is part of the artist\u2019s thinking and is directly inscribed in his artistic activity. Kaaf\u2019s work comprises various artistic disciplines, from drawing and photography through glass sculpture, sound, and video to room installation. He primarily works with paper and ink. He finds his European role models in Classical Modernism and the avant-garde of the 1960s: works like his series The Byzantine CornerNafas Art Magazine, April 2018, Ali Kaaf: The Byzantine Corner, article by Alm\u00fat Sh. Bruckstein were inspired by Henri Matisse\u2019s paper cutouts and the collages of the Dadaists. Influences from his delving into the German art movement ZERO are recognizable. The principle of removal and readdition is characteristic of his working method. The works display their form language in relation to point and line, surface and depth, black and white, surfaces and forms, rhythm, fire, erosion, and light and shadow.Nafas Art Magazine, January 2008, Alexandra von Stosch: Ali Kaaf. Dramaturgy of Signs Kaaf\u2019s abstractions are the result of his intense dealings with script, architecture, and history. Kaaf\u2019s works engage in dialogue with cultures and disciplines and, beyond them, through interdisciplinary collaborations, to Gesamtkunstwerke, syntheses of the arts. Examples include a 2018 video installation on 48 Variations for Two Pianos by John McGuire (Festival ME_MMIX 2018) in the Es Baluard Museum for Modern and Contemporary Art in Palma; in 2015, Intima, a dance project in collaboration with Dawson Dance SF and the choreographer David Dawson, San Francisco, and the composers Ashraf Kateb and Kinan Azmeh; and his recurrent collaboration since 2011 with the glassblower James Mongrain in Seattle; the products are flowing sculptural forms cooled to glass with titles like Helmet, Tattoo, and Larynx (2014), which correspond with his works on paper (Rift, Dress, Wall, and Burn Trace). Kaaf presents his work in artist talks, lectures, and workshops, at institutions like Montana State University Billings (MT, USA) and at the symposium on Syria and Yemen: making art today with Anna Wallace-Thompson, Buthayna Ali, Fadi Yazigi, and Kevork Mourad in the British Museum in London in 2019.
