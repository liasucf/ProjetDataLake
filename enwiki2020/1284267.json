    "text": "Aaron Charles Rodgers (born December 2, 1983) is an American football quarterback for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). Rodgers played college football at California, where he set several career passing records, including lowest single-season and career interception rates. He was selected in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft by the Packers. After backing up Brett Favre for the first three years of his NFL career, Rodgers became the Packers' starting quarterback in 2008. In 2010, he led them to a victory in Super Bowl XLV over the Pittsburgh Steelers, earning the Super Bowl MVP. He was named Associated Press Athlete of the Year in 2011, and was voted league MVP by the Associated Press for the 2011 and 2014 NFL seasons. Rodgers has led the NFL four times in touchdown-to-interception ratio (2011, 2012, 2014, 2018); and four times in lowest passing interception percentage (2009, 2014, 2018, 2019), twice in passer rating (2011, 2012), touchdown passing percentage (2011, 2012); and once in touchdown passes (2016) and yards per attempt (2011). Rodgers is the NFL's all-time regular season career passer rating leader with a regular season career passer rating of over 100 while also having the highest passer rating in NFL history throughout the entire 2010's decade. He is fifth all-time in postseason career passer rating, has the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in NFL history at 4.49, holds the league's lowest career interception percentage at 1.4 percent and the highest single-season passer rating record of 122.5. Rodgers is considered by some sportscasters and players to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. ==Early years== Aaron Charles Rodgers was born in Chico, California, the son of Darla Leigh (n\u00e9e Pittman) and Edward Wesley Rodgers. Aaron's father is a Texas-born chiropractor who played football as an offensive lineman for the Chico State Wildcats from 1973 to 1976. His ancestry includes English, Irish and German. The family moved to Ukiah, California, where Aaron attended Oak Manor Elementary School. Edward Rodgers tossed a football with his sons Luke, Aaron and Jordan, and told them not to drink and not to party in college or they would limit themselves in sports like he did. Aaron took this advice to heart. At the age of ten, he was featured on the front page of the Ukiah Daily Journal for his top performance at a local basketball free throw competition. Later, the family moved to Beaverton, Oregon, where Rodgers attended Vose Elementary School and Whitford Middle School, and played baseball in the Raleigh Hills Little League at shortstop, center field and pitcher. The Rodgers family returned to Chico in 1997, and Aaron attended Pleasant Valley High School, starting for two years at quarterback and garnering 4,421 passing yards. He set single-game records of six touchdowns and 440 all-purpose yards. Rodgers set a single-season school record with 2,466 total yards in 2001. He graduated from Pleasant Valley High School in spring 2002, after scoring 1310 in the SAT and with an A- average. ==College career== Despite his impressive high school record, Rodgers attracted little interest from programs. In a 2011 interview with E:60, he attributed the relative lack of attention in the recruiting process to his unimposing physical stature as a high school player at 5'10\" (1.78 m) and 165 lb (75 kg). Rodgers had wanted to attend Florida State and play under head coach Bobby Bowden, but was rejected. He was only offered an opportunity to compete for a scholarship as a walk-on from Illinois. He declined the invitation, and considered quitting football to study for law school. He was then recruited to play football at Butte Community College in Oroville, a junior college about 15 miles (25 km) southeast of Chico. ===2002=== Rodgers threw 26 touchdowns in his freshman season at Butte Community College, leading the school to a 10\u20131 record, the NorCal Conference championship, and a national ranking. While there, he was discovered by the California Golden Bears's head coach Jeff Tedford, who was recruiting Butte tight end Garrett Cross. Tedford was surprised to learn that Rodgers had not been recruited earlier. Because of Rodgers' good high school scholastic record, he was eligible to transfer to the University of California, Berkeley after one year of junior college instead of the typical two. ===2003=== As a junior college transfer, Rodgers had three years of eligibility at Cal. He was named the starting quarterback in the fifth game of the 2003 season, beating the only team that offered him a opportunity out of high school, Illinois. As a sophomore, he helped lead the Golden Bears to a 7\u20133 record as a starter. In his second career start, Rodgers led the team to a 21\u20137 halftime lead against #3 USC. Due to injury, Rodgers was replaced in the second half by Reggie Robertson. The Bears won in triple overtime, 34\u201331. Rodgers passed for 394 yards and was named game MVP in the Insight Bowl against Virginia Tech. In 2003, Rodgers tied the school season record for 300-yard games with five and set a school record for the lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.43%. ===2004=== As a junior, Rodgers led Cal to a 10\u20131 record and top-five ranking at the end of the regular season, with their only loss a 23\u201317 loss at USC. In that game, Rodgers set a school record for consecutive completed passes with 26 and tied an NCAA record with 23 consecutive passes completed in one game. He set a Cal single-game record for passing completion percentage of 85.3. Rodgers holds the Cal career record for lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.95 percent. Rodgers' performance set up the Golden Bears at first and goal with 1:47 remaining and a chance for the game-winning touchdown. On the first play of USC's goal line stand, Rodgers threw an incomplete pass. This was followed by a second-down sack by Manuel Wright. After a timeout and Rodgers' incomplete pass on third down, USC stopped Cal's run play to win the game. Rodgers commented that it was \"frustrating that we couldn't get the job done.\" Overall, he finished the 2004 season with 2,566 passing yards, 24 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. His 66.1% pass completion percentage led the Pac-10. After Texas was picked over Cal for a Rose Bowl berth, the fourth-ranked Bears were awarded a spot in the Holiday Bowl, which they lost to Texas Tech, 45\u201331. After the season, Rodgers decided to forgo his senior season to enter the 2005 NFL Draft. ===College statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! colspan=\"8\"|Passing !! colspan=\"4\"|Rushing |- ! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! !! |- ! 2003 !!

He threw for 24 touchdowns and only eight interceptions in his last college season, impressing many NFL scouts. They commented that he was a \"talented strong-armed junior\" who \"combines arm strength, mechanics and delivery to make all the throws\", but noted that his stats could be inflated due to playing in a quarterback-friendly system and that he would need to adjust to the more elaborate defensive schemes of the NFL. Before the draft, Rodgers was confident that he would be drafted to the team he supported and grew up near, the San Francisco 49ers, who possessed the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. The 49ers, however, drafted quarterback Alex Smith out of Utah instead, and Rodgers slid all the way down to the 24th overall pick by the Green Bay Packers. Rodgers has said that he experienced much angst and restlessness when waiting to be selected several hours into the draft, as he had expected himself to be selected much sooner. Rodgers' slip to the 24th selection and the Packers choosing to pick Brett Favre's future replacement became one of the biggest stories of the draft, though he was still the second quarterback selected. His drop in the draft was later ranked number one on the NFL Network's Top 10 Draft Day Moments. Many teams drafting between the second and 23rd positions had positional needs more pressing than quarterback. Rodgers is one of six quarterbacks coached by Jeff Tedford to be drafted in the first round of an NFL draft, joining Trent Dilfer, Akili Smith, David Carr, Joey Harrington, and Kyle Boller. ===Backup years: 2005\u20132007=== Rodgers in September 2007 In , Rodgers agreed to a reported five-year, deal that included in guaranteed money and had the potential to pay him as much as if all incentives and escalators were met. Rodgers spent his rookie season with the 4\u201312 Packers as the Packers' backup quarterback behind Brett Favre. He received his first extended look in the opening preseason game against the San Diego Chargers after replacing Favre. He had to endure a malfunctioning radio in his helmet and two offensive flags. In his first NFL game, Rodgers completed two out of seven passes and was sacked twice. He continued to struggle through the preseason, before ending the preseason by converting two third downs and throwing a touchdown pass to tight end Ben Steele against the Tennessee Titans. Once the regular season began, Rodgers saw very little action that year. He played against the New Orleans Saints in the fourth quarter of a 52\u20133 victory, and completed his first career pass to fullback Vonta Leach for 0 yards. On Rodgers entered the game against the Baltimore Ravens at the end of the third quarter in a 48\u20133 loss. He completed eight of 15 passes for 65 yards and an interception. Rodgers saw one more play at the end of the season against the Seattle Seahawks, taking a knee to end the game. Though Rodgers played very little in his rookie season, he ran the scout team during practice. His job was to mimic opponents' schemes for the defense for the game the following week. Rodgers said this was critical to his success, and that those were his game reps. The defense and scouts often complained that he was practicing too hard, and at one point asked him to tone it down. He stated that he had probably \"rubbed people the wrong way\" with how hard he practiced. Wide receiver Donald Driver commented that Rodgers took \"every scout-team possession like it was the last possession of his life.\" After the Packers' losing season of Rodgers' rookie year, head coach Mike Sherman was fired and replaced by Mike McCarthy. Rodgers was then placed in McCarthy's \"Quarterback school\" for six hours a day several times a week. This focused on working on Rodgers' motor skills such as hand-eye coordination, finger dexterity, and mechanics. McCarthy also worked on Rodgers' release point, moving it from right beside the ear hole of his helmet to further below it, to give him a smoother release. Rodgers was also instructed to lower his body fat ratio from to . Rodgers was resistant to the changes at first but later commented that he thought they were for the better. During practice in 11-on-11 drills, Rodgers completed 62.7% of his passes with seven interceptions, and McCarthy commented that \"He's getting better\" and that \"You're looking at a guy who's going to mature. He's got athletic ability that people still haven't seen.\" Favre did not attend the quarterback school under the new coaching staff and thus knew none of the terminology in the new system. It was here that the friendship between Rodgers and Favre began to form as Rodgers instructed Favre which plays in the Sherman system corresponded to those in the new McCarthy system. When the preseason began, Rodgers played as the backup in all four games; he completed 22 out 38 passes for 323 yards and three touchdowns. Rodgers saw very little action during the 2006 season, but did step in on against the Philadelphia Eagles when Favre left the game due to injury. Rodgers completed two out of three passes for 13 yards. On Rodgers broke his left foot while playing against the New England Patriots in a 35\u20130 defeat at home, filling in for an injured Brett Favre, and Rodgers missed the remainder of the 2006 season. Rodgers made a full recovery and was ready for the start of the 2007 season. With then quarterbacks' coach Tom Clements, Rodgers reviewed every play from the previous season, learning to read defensive coverages and to throw receivers open. Rodgers also took the spring practice reps with the Packers' first team. However, weeks after an emotional interview with NBC's Andrea Kremer, following the team's season- ending victory at Chicago, Favre announced that he would stay with the Packers for the 2007 season, again postponing Rodgers' hopes of becoming the Packers' starting quarterback. Prior to the 2007 season, rumors surfaced about a potential trade involving Rodgers in which he would be traded to the Oakland Raiders for wide receiver Randy Moss. However, Moss was traded to the New England Patriots during the second day of the 2007 NFL Draft, and Rodgers stayed in Green Bay. Rodgers stepped in when Favre was injured in the second quarter against the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday Night Football on . Rodgers completed 18 passes for 201 yards, with no interceptions. He also threw his first touchdown pass but was sacked three times. Rodgers brought the team back from a 17-point deficit to a 3-point deficit, but the Cowboys went on to win 37\u201327. ===2008: Transition to starter=== Rodgers going down the tunnel at Lambeau Field in 2008 Brett Favre's retirement announcement on opened up the Packers' starting quarterback position to Rodgers for the 2008 season. Although Favre decided to return from retirement, he was traded to the New York Jets, which meant that Rodgers would become the starter. Rodgers quickly proved that he was one of the best quarterbacks in the league by passing for 4,038 yards in his first season as a starter as well as throwing for 28 touchdowns and only 13 interceptions. As of the 2018 season, this still stands as the most interceptions he has thrown in a season. With Rodgers making his debut as a starter, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings 24\u201319 at Lambeau Field. This marked the first time since 1992 that a quarterback other than Favre started a regular-season game for the Packers. Rodgers ended the game with 178 yards passing and two touchdowns (one passing and one rushing). In just his second NFL start the following week, Rodgers was voted the FedEx Air award winner after passing for 328 yards and three touchdowns in a win against the Detroit Lions. During the fourth week of the season, Rodgers' streak of 157 consecutive pass attempts without an interception ended when he was intercepted by Derrick Brooks of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The streak was the third-longest in franchise history behind Bart Starr (294) and Brett Favre (163). Rodgers suffered a severe shoulder sprain in the game but continued to start and played well in a win against the Seattle Seahawks two weeks later, which to many proved his toughness. Despite early successes, Rodgers had been unable to win a close game during the season despite seven opportunities to do so. On , Rodgers signed a six-year, contract extension through the 2014 season. In Rodgers' first full season with the team, the Packers finished with a 6\u201310 record and missed the playoffs. ===2009=== For the opening game of the 2009 season, Rodgers recorded his first win in a comeback situation. The Packers were trailing at the beginning of the fourth quarter when Rodgers completed a fifty-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings with about a minute remaining in the game to contribute to the 21\u201315 victory over the Chicago Bears. Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for , when he passed for 988 yards, completed 74.5 percent of his passes, and recorded a passer rating over 110 for all three games played during the month. After a 4\u20134 start to the season and a 38\u201328 loss to the previously winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the team began to heat up. Rodgers led the Packers to five straight wins, in which he threw for a total of 1,324 yards, nine touchdowns, and two interceptions. Rodgers and the Packers won two of their last three games, finishing the second half of the season with a 7\u20131 record and an overall 11\u20135 record; good enough to secure a wild card playoff berth and clinch the fifth seed in the playoffs. The Packers set a new franchise record by scoring 461 total points (third in the league), breaking the previous record held by the 1996 Super Bowl team (456). Rodgers became the first quarterback in NFL history ever to throw for 4,000 yards in both of his first two years as a starter. He finished the season fourth in passing yards (4,434), touchdown passes (30), passer rating (103.2), and yards per attempt (8.2) as well as eighth in completion percentage (64.7%), while also coming second among quarterbacks in rushing yards (316). His passing yardage made him second all-time in Packers history, behind only Lynn Dickey's all-time single- season record. His passer rating of 103.2 was also third-highest in team history at the time, behind only Bart Starr's 105.0 rating in and 104.3 rating in (minimum 150 attempts). Rodgers in 2009, before a snap In the Wild Card Round, the Packers played the Arizona Cardinals, the same team they had previously beaten the week before, 33\u20137. Rodgers and Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner put on a show that later ranked second on NFL Network's Top 10 Quarterback Duels. Rodgers' first pass was intercepted by Dominique Rodgers- Cromartie. Rodgers settled down after that miscue, however, and finished the game completing 28 of 42 passes for 423 yards, with four touchdown passes all in a second-half comeback. His 423 passing yards are the most by any quarterback in his first playoff game as well as his four touchdown passes and five total touchdowns. Kurt Warner shredded the Packers' second-ranked defense, completing 29 of 33 passes for 379 yards, five touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 154.1. Despite Rodgers' offensive efforts, the Packers lost the game when he fumbled on a controversial play in overtime. The ball was returned by Karlos Dansby for the winning touchdown in the 51\u201345 Cardinals victory. It was the highest scoring playoff game in NFL history. Due to his regular-season performance, Rodgers earned a trip to his first Pro Bowl as the NFC's third quarterback, behind Drew Brees and Brett Favre. However, after Favre dropped out due to injury and Brees was replaced due to his participation in Super Bowl XLIV, Rodgers became the NFC's starter. He finished the day with 15 of 19 passing, 197 yards and two touchdowns. ===2010: Super Bowl XLV season=== In 2010, Rodgers led the Packers to a 2\u20130 start, but then lost three of their next four games, including back-to-back overtime losses. The two overtime defeats brought Rodgers' record in overtime games to 0\u20135. At midseason, Rodgers had already thrown nine interceptions compared to only throwing seven all of the previous season, and was 16th in the league with an 85.3 passer rating. Over the remainder of the regular season, however, his play improved as he threw 16 touchdowns to only two interceptions, completed 71.4% of his passes, and had a passer rating of 122.0. In , in a 34\u201316 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, Rodgers had 298 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn his first career NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor. In , he sustained his second concussion of the season. Backup Matt Flynn was put into the game as Rodgers' replacement. The Packers lost the game 7\u20133 to the Detroit Lions. Against the New England Patriots, Rodgers missed the next week's regular season start, ending his streak of consecutive starts at 45, which is tied for the second longest in team history. After their road loss to the Patriots, the Packers found themselves at 8\u20136 and had to win their final two regular season games to qualify for the playoffs. Rodgers turned around the team's performance; they won their final two regular season games, one of them against the New York Giants, where Rodgers completed 25 of 37 passes for 404 yards, with four touchdown passes, and with a passer rating of 139.9. It was his first regular season 400-yard passing game. For his effort against the Giants, he earned his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2010 season. In the next game, they defeated the Chicago Bears by a score of 10\u20133 in the regular season finale. Rodgers was named the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Year for his passing performance in the 2010 season. Rodgers greeting the fans in Lambeau Field during the 2010 season's finale against the Bears. With a 10\u20136 record, the Packers entered the playoffs as a Wild Card and the seed. In the Wild Card Round, they defeated the seeded Philadelphia Eagles 21\u201316. In the Divisional Round, Rodgers completed 31 of 36 pass attempts for 366 yards and four touchdowns in a 48\u201321 blowout victory over the seeded Atlanta Falcons. It was the most points scored in Packers postseason history. During the contest, Rodgers tied an NFL record for consecutive playoff games with at least three touchdown passes (3 games). Rodgers also set an NFL record by becoming the only quarterback to pass for ten touchdowns combined through three consecutive playoff games. On Rodgers had a 55.4 passer rating as the Packers beat the seed Chicago Bears 21\u201314 win to capture the NFC Championship. After winning the NFC Championship, the Packers earned a trip to Super Bowl XLV\u2014a game in which they won, 31\u201325, against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the game, Rodgers completed 24 of 39 pass attempts for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win, and was named Super Bowl MVP for his performance. From his playoff performance, Rodgers became only the third player in NFL history to pass for over 1,000 yards in a single postseason and also became one of only four quarterbacks to record over 300 yards passing, with at least three touchdown passes, and no interceptions in a Super Bowl. He finished with 1,094 passing yards (fourth most all time), nine touchdown passes (tied for fourth most all time), two rushing touchdowns, and two interceptions, while completing 68.2% of his passes for a passer rating of 109.8. From this postseason, Rodgers also became the only player to pass for at least 900 yards and rush for at least two touchdowns in a single postseason. He was ranked 11th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011. ===2011: NFL MVP=== Rodgers drops back for a pass in 2011 Because of the 2011 NFL lockout, the Packers and Rodgers didn't schedule unofficial offseason workouts, despite many teams doing so. Rodgers and the Packers quickly quelled any concerns over their readiness by defeating the New Orleans Saints, who had scheduled offseason workouts, 42\u201334. He had 312 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. After the game, Rodgers said in the press conference, \"I was going to ask myself, what would have happened if we had offseason workouts? I mean, could we have started any faster and scored more points tonight?\" In Week 4, a 49\u201323 victory over the Denver Broncos, Rodgers had 408 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception to earn another NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor. In Week 6, a 24\u20133 victory over the St. Louis Rams, Rodgers converted on a career-high 93-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson. In Week 9, a 45\u201338 victory over the San Diego Chargers, he had 247 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2011 season. Rodgers and the Packers got off to a 13\u20130 start in 2011, tying the NFC record for most consecutive wins to start a season, but were upset by the Kansas City Chiefs 19\u201314 in week 15, ending their winning streak at 19 games, the second-longest winning streak in NFL history. Rodgers finished the season with 4,643 passing yards, 45 touchdown passes, and six interceptions, good for a passer rating of 122.5, which is the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history. In addition to passer rating, Rodgers led the league in touchdown to interception ratio (7.5, fourth best all-time), touchdowns passing % (9.0%, second highest all-time), and yards per attempt (9.2, fourth highest all-time since becoming an official stat in 1970), while finishing second in both touchdown passes (45, sixth- highest all-time) and completion percentage (68.3%), as well as fifth in passing yards. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month awards for September, October, and November, and FedEx Air Player of the Week six times (Weeks 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 13). In week four, against the Denver Broncos, Rodgers became the only quarterback in NFL history to record over 400 passing yards with four touchdown passes, while also rushing for two touchdowns in the same game. He was the winner of the 2011 Galloping gobbler as MVP of the Thanksgiving game between the Packers and the Detroit Lions, a 27\u201315 Green Bay victory, and tied an NFL record for consecutive games with at least two touchdown passes (13). The Packers became the fifth team in NFL history to finish the regular season with a 15\u20131 record. Rodgers played in 15 of the 16 games, with the only exception being Week 17 against the Detroit Lions, a game in which Rodgers was rested after the club clinched home-field advantage for the playoffs the previous week. In the game, Rodgers assisted backup quarterback Matt Flynn in his stellar 480-yard, six-touchdown performance by helping call some plays. The Packers' offense set franchise record for points scored in a season with 560, which is the third-most ever behind only the 2007 Patriots and 2013 Broncos. Rodgers set numerous NFL records in 2011. He recorded a passer rating of over 100.0 in thirteen games during the season, including twelve games in a row (both records), and a passer rating of 110.0 or higher in twelve games, including eleven in a row (also records). Rodgers also won the league's MVP award, receiving 48 of the 50 votes (the other two going to Drew Brees). He also finished second, behind Brees, for the AP Offensive Player of the Year award.

With the loss, Rodgers lost his bet with the music group Boyz II Men, and had to wear an Alex Smith jersey during the next week of practice. Had the Packers won the game, Boyz II Men would have sung the national anthem during their next home game at Lambeau. In Week 4, a 28\u201327 victory over the New Orleans Saints, Rodgers had 319 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.

This sparked a five-game winning streak which Rodgers completed 65.7% of his passes for 1,320 yards, 17 touchdowns, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 119.1. During that stretch, Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October.

Rodgers went 21 for 37 in completions, 333 yards, three touchdowns and an interception in the 34\u201328 loss. The following week, Rodgers had a career-high 480 passing yards to tie the franchise record in the 38\u201320 home-opener win against the Washington Redskins.

The following week, Rodgers saw his NFL record of 41 consecutive games without throwing multiple interceptions come to an end in a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals by the score of 34\u201330. After the loss to the Bengals, the Packers started rolling, winning their next four games. Against the Baltimore Ravens, the Packers lost two receivers: Randall Cobb and James Jones. Cobb was sidelined with a broken leg and Jones with a sprained PCL. Against the Cleveland Browns, tight end Jermichael Finley was carted off the field with a bruised spinal cord, leaving Rodgers without three of his top four offensive weapons. The next week against the Minnesota Vikings, Rodgers completed 24 of 29 passes in a 44\u201331 victory. At home against the Chicago Bears in Week 9, Rodgers was sacked by Shea McClellin. He fractured his left clavicle in the process, and the speculation for his return ranged from a few weeks to an indefinite timetable that became a weekly spectacle of whether or not or when he might be cleared to play again. Before Rodgers had broken his collarbone, the Packers had won four straight games to climb to the top of the NFC North division with a 5\u20132 record. With Rodgers injured and unable to play, the Packers went winless over the next five weeks to fall to 5\u20136\u20131 on the season. After rallying in December behind re-acquired backup quarterback Matt Flynn, the Packers had fought their way back to a 7\u20137\u20131 record going into the final week of the season.

Returning from the injury, Rodgers threw for 318 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the regular season finale against the Bears. Trailing 27\u201328 with under a minute to go in the game and facing the third 4th down of the drive, a 4th & 8 from the 48-yard line, Rodgers connected with Randall Cobb, who was also returning for his first game since breaking his leg in Week 6, for a 48-yard game-winning touchdown to clinch the NFC North and earn the right to host a home playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers as the fourth seed. Rodgers won the 2013 GMC Never Say Never Award for the come-from- behind, division winning touchdown pass. Rodgers finished fifth in the league in passer rating (104.9), completion percentage (66.6%), and yards per game (282) while also finishing second in yards per attempt (8.75). Rodgers led the Packers to the playoffs again, this time with an 8\u20137\u20131 record and were up against the team that eliminated them last year in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the San Francisco 49ers. The Packers lost to the 49ers for the fourth consecutive time, 23\u201320 on a last second field goal at Lambeau Field, in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers recorded only 177 yards passing, his lowest in a playoff game, and one touchdown pass. He was ranked #11 by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014. ===2014: Second MVP=== Rodgers in 2014 The Packers' 2014 regular season debut came against the defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks\u2014a game in which they would go on to lose 36\u201316.

We're going to be OK.\" After their loss to the Lions, the Packers went on a four-game win streak, during which, Rodgers threw 13 touchdowns with no interceptions. In Week 4, a 38\u201317 victory over the Chicago Bears, he had 302 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. In Week 6, against the Miami Dolphins, Rodgers led the Packers to a game-winning drive with less than two minutes remaining.

Rodgers then completed a touchdown pass to tight end Andrew Quarless to win the game 27\u201324. This play would later win Rodgers the GMC Never Say Never Moment of the Year Award.

In the Divisional Round, the Packers were scheduled to play the 13\u20134 Dallas Cowboys, which marked the first time in NFL playoff history when a team which went undefeated at home (Packers) played against a team which went undefeated away (Cowboys). Rodgers helped secure a 26\u201321 victory by finishing 24 of 35 for 316 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 125.4 passer rating. The Packers then traveled to Seattle to face the top-seeded Seahawks in a rematch of the regular season opener. In the NFC Championship, the Packers were leading 19\u20137 with just over five minutes to go, but the home team's offense finally woke up and, with the assistance of a crucial Packers special teams gaffe on an onside kick, the Seahawks led 22\u201319, with 44 seconds remaining. Rodgers quickly drove downfield to set up a tying field goal, only to watch from the sidelines as the Seahawks won the coin toss in overtime and proceeded to score the game- winning touchdown on their first possession.

Rodgers completed only 60.7 of his passes, averaged only 6.7 yards per attempt and finished with a passer rating of 92.7; all career lows. Pro Bowl wide receiver, Jordy Nelson's absence due to injury for the season was considered a contributing factor in Rodgers' statistical drop compared to previous seasons.

During Week 9 against the Carolina Panthers, he finished with 369 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception.

Year (2010, 2014) * The Wisconsin Legislature approved a proposal that declared December 12, 2012 (stylized as 12/12/12) \"Aaron Rodgers Day\" in honor of Rodgers whose jersey number in the NFL is 12. ==Personal life== Rodgers lived in Suamico, Wisconsin, a northern suburb of Green Bay roughly 10 miles from Lambeau Field, until 2017. He also owns a home in the affluent beach community Del Mar, California, 20 miles north of downtown San Diego, and lives in Los Angeles during the offseason. He has two brothers; the younger, Jordan, played quarterback at Vanderbilt University, briefly spent time with the Jacksonville Jaguars and later with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Growing up, Rodgers was raised Christian but in adulthood, he says he no longer affiliates himself with any organized religion. Rodgers was in a relationship with actress Olivia Munn from 2014 to 2017, and with former NASCAR driver Danica Patrick from February 2018 to July 2020.https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/29477065/danica-patrick-aaron- rodgers-no-longer-together ===Business ventures=== Rodgers and Milwaukee Brewers player Ryan Braun's names were jointly on a Milwaukee restaurant, but later closed after Braun's PED scandal. Rodgers, after strongly backing Braun, claimed he had been lied to by Braun about his PED usage. In April 2018, Rodgers was announced as a limited partner in the Milwaukee Bucks ownership group, making him the first active NFL player with an ownership stake in an NBA franchise. ==Media appearances== Since becoming a starter in 2008, Rodgers has become known for his unique touchdown celebration, which he and his teammates have dubbed the \"Championship Belt.\" After a scoring play, Rodgers celebrates by making a motion as if he is putting an invisible championship belt on around his waist. Teammate Greg Jennings said of the celebration: \"It's just something fun that he does. We get excited when we see it cause we know that he's made a play or we've made a play as offense.\" The gesture drew the praise of World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler Triple H and has become common for Green Bay fans to mimic during games. Rodgers' celebration is also featured in a series of State Farm Insurance commercials, renamed the \"Discount Double Check\". Various teammates, including Raji, Matthews, and Cobb, have joined him in the advertisements. Rodgers has also been featured in Pizza Hut advertisements, as well as numerous local Wisconsin-based advertisements. In 2015, Rodgers made a cameo appearance (along with Packers teammate Ha Ha Clinton-Dix and fellow NFL players Leger Douzable, D'Brickashaw Ferguson, Tank Carradine, Prince Amukamara, Fozzy Whittaker, Ishmaa'ily Kitchen, and Frostee Rucker) in a segment of the second season of the sketch comedy television series Key & Peele. The segment was the third installment of \"East/West College Bowl,\" a sketch that spoofed player introductions during televised football games. In the sketch, all the players being introduced had unusual names; Rodgers pronounced his own name as \"A-A-Ron Rod-Gers\" in a callback to a sketch from the show's first season. ==Humanitarian and charitable efforts== Rodgers is the founder, and with co-creator David Gruber, of itsAaron with a mission of \"creating awareness for organizations and people who are changing the world\". He is also a supporter of the MACC Fund, RAISE Hope for Congo, and other humanitarian and charitable efforts. In a May 12, 2015, episode of Celebrity Jeopardy he raised $50,000 for the MACC Fund by triumphing over astronaut Mark Kelly and Shark Tank panel member and entrepreneur Kevin O'Leary to win the funds. ==See also== * List of National Football League career quarterback wins leaders * List of National Football League career passer rating leaders * List of National Football League career passing completions leaders * List of National Football League career passing touchdowns leaders * List of National Football League career passing yards leaders * List of Green Bay Packers first-round draft picks * List of Green Bay Packers records * List of Green Bay Packers starting quarterbacks ==References== ==External links== * California Golden Bears bio * Green Bay Packers bio * Category:1983 births Category:American football quarterbacks Category:American people of English descent Category:American people of German descent Category:American people of Irish descent Category:Butte Roadrunners football players Category:California Golden Bears football players Category:Green Bay Packers players Category:Living people Category:National Conference Pro Bowl players Category:People from Suamico, Wisconsin Category:People from Ukiah, California Category:Players of American football from California Category:Sportspeople from Beaverton, Oregon Category:Sportspeople from Chico, California Category:Super Bowl champions Category:Super Bowl MVPs Category:Unconferenced Pro Bowl players ",
