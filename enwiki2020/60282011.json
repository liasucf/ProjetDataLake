She is a national of Argentina, France and Spain. She is the daughter of Juan Ill\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez de Toledo y Giraud, the 12th Marquess of Casa Fuerte, who fought as part of the French Resistance during the Second World War, and of Patricia Peralta-Ramos y Madero. Having spent most of her early life in the United Kingdom and Argentina, Cayetana \u00c1lvarez de Toledo has stated on various occasions that she \u00abdecided to be Spanish\u00bb. After spending the first seven years of her childhood in London, she moved to Buenos Aires, enrolling in the exclusive and prestigious \u00abNorthlands School\u00bb. She returned to the United Kingdom to obtain her university degrees. There, she obtained a post-graduate degree in Modern History at the University of Oxford, being a member of the New College and she also obtained a PhD on that matter with her dissertation about the Bishop Juan de Palafox, Viceroy of New Spain, directed by the Hispanicist historian John H. Elliott. She married Spanish businessman (and her distant cousin) Joaqu\u00edn G\u00fcell (from the family of the Marquesses of Comillas and Counts of G\u00fcell) in 20 October 2001. They had two daughters but they divorced in January 2018. After obtaining her PhD, she became an editor in the daily newspaper El Mundo in September 2000, first in the Opinion section and later in the Economy section. She was also a talk show guest on the Cadena COPE programme \u00abThe Morning\u00bb, hosted by Federico Jim\u00e9nez Losantos. ===Political career=== In 2006 she was appointed Chief of Staff of the leader of the People's Party (PP), \u00c1ngel Acebes, with the task of advising Acebes regarding political strategy, managing his agenda and coordinating the elaboration of his speeches in parliament. She continued her job as journalist in El Mundo and she was elected the \u00abyoung global leader\u00bb in 2008 by the World Economic Forum to recognise \u00abher professional achievements, commitment to society and her potential to contribute to the forging of the future of the world\u00bb. \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, who obtained Spanish nationality in 2007, stood for the 2008 general election as a member of the People's Party list for the constituency of Madrid, as number 9 on the list, becoming a Member of Parliament in the 9th Cortes Generales, where she served as a Deputy Spokesperson of the People's Party Parliamentary Group. In 2011 she stood again in the general election, being re-elected MP to the 10th Legislature. She was the Vice President of the Joint Committee for the European Union and a member of the Justice and Constitutional Committees in the Congress of Deputies. She was also responsible for the Analysis Department of the People's Party of the Community of Madrid. As a result of her father's death in Paris in 2012, she inherited the title of Marchioness of Casa Fuerte a year later. Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado (BOE) - 12 October 2013 She is the 13th holder of the title. In 2014 she wrote an article in the Financial Times against the separatist direction in which Catalan nationalism was perceived to be heading. In 2014 she launched the constitutionalist manifesto Free and Equal as one of her first signature reforms. The manifesto rejected all concessions to the Catalan nationalists who desired independence. She was the spokesperson of the homonymous organisation which seeks to involve the Spanish citizenry in the defense of the constitutional provisions of equality between all Spaniards against Catalan nationalism which is perceived as a threat to \u00abthe equality of all Spaniards\u00bb, citing the attempt to establish the \u00abCatalan people\u00bb as sovereign. Among the events organised by Free and Equal is the one which took place on 11 September 2014, the triennial of the defeat of the pro-Habsburg forces in Barcelona during the War of the Spanish Succession, in the C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes of Madrid, where she also gave a speech. On 14 October 2015, she announced, through the newspaper El Mundo, that she would not stand for re- election as a candidate for the People's Party due to disagreements with the Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, regarding economic matters, Catalan separatism and the erosion of public institutions. She gained particular popularity in 2016, after criticising the Cabalgata de Reyes organised by the City Council of Madrid, through a Tweet with the following text: \u00abMy 6-year old daughter: 'Mom, this Gaspar's costume isn't real' I will never forgive you for this, Manuela Carmena. Never\u00bb. The Tweet received more than six thousand replies and twelve thousand retweets, going viral. On 8 March 2018, she criticised the feminist strike taking place on that same day through a newspaper. In June 2018 she published an opinion article after the dissolution of Mariano Rajoy government resulting from the no confidence motion sponsored by the PSOE. \u00c1lvarez de Toledo confirmed that she continue being a People's Party member, having however voted for the liberal centre-right party Ciudadanos, and she asked for the merging of the two parties. On 15 March 15, 2019 it was announced that she would run 1st in the PP list for the Congress of Deputies in the Barcelona constituency for the 28 April 2019 general election. As result of the election she became a member of the lower house, effectively assuming office on 21 May 2019. In July, the party's leader, Pablo Casado, announced that she would be the party's spokesperson for the 13th Congress of Deputies. She continued in the position in the 14th Congress of Deputies until 21 August 2020. == Committee assignments == === 9th Congress of Deputies === * Constitutional Committee * Committee on Home Affairs * Joint Committee on Parliamentary Control of the RTVE Corporation and its companies === 13th Congress of Deputies === * Constitutional Committee * Committee on Justice ==References== Category:1974 births Category:20th-century Spanish historians Category:21st-century women Category:Living people Category:Marquesses of Spain Category:Members of the 9th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 10th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 13th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Argentine nobility Category:Spanish journalists Category:Spanish people of Argentine descent Category:Spanish people of French descent Category:Spanish women journalists Category:Women members of the Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 14th Congress of Deputies (Spain) ",
