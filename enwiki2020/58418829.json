The chorus has had over 1,600 members during its history and has performed at Carnegie Hall, Symphony Hall, and Jordan Hall. == History == The Boston Gay Men's Chorus was founded in 1982 and began with between 50 and 60 members. Their first performance was part of Boston's Gay Pride Week in the same year. In December 1982, the group performed their first annual holiday concert which attracted over 900 audience members. The group claims to have originally assembled for \"aesthetic rather than political purposes,\" as was described by former Director Lee Ridgeway in an interview. In March 1992, the chorus celebrated its tenth anniversary with a concert at Boston Symphony Hall with the Denver and Washington D.C. gay men's choruses. The chorus was under the direction of Conductor Robert Barney and had approximately 100 members. For this performance, the chorus commissioned Composer Daniel Pinkham's \"Down an Amherst Path.\" == Performance highlights == ===U.S. Conference of Mayors, June 8\u201311, 2018 === The chorus performed at the United States Conference of Mayors which took place in Boston during Pride Week. This marks the chorus's first time singing at a political gathering. Music Director Reuben M. Reynolds III commented, \u201ccoming at the end of Boston Pride Week, this also sets a wonderful example for mayors from around the country of what it means for a city to be truly inclusive of its LGBT community.\" === BGMC and Mzansi Gay Choir, Johannesburg South Africa, June 15, 2018 === The Boston Gay Men's Chorus performed with the Mzansi Gay Choir, which formed in 2015 and is one of the newest gay men's choruses.

During the tour, the chorus performed a new composition by Joshua Shank titled \"Peace.\" This piece addressed LGBT equality more directly than most of the other pieces in the chorus's repertoire. Chorus member, Kilian Melloy, reported that the group's reception in the Middle East was widely positive, although the permit for the gay pride parade in Istanbul was revoked and the event was cancelled. === Governor Charlie Baker's First Inaugural Ball, January 8, 2015 === This was the first time a gay men's chorus has performed at the inauguration of any republican Governor. === First gay chorus to perform in Poland, 2005 === The BGMC was the first gay chorus to perform in Poland.

About forty protestors assembled outside of the North Congregational Church, one of ten churches who sponsored the performance as part of the AIDS Community Awareness Project. In addition, The Caledonian-Record, a southern Vermont paper published an editorial piece and two advertisements denouncing the performance. During the same tour, a New Hampshire paper, The Dartmouth Review published an editorial piece in which it referred to the chorus as a \"traveling sodomy circus.\" These protests came shortly after Vermont Governor Howard Dean signed a gay rights bill into law. == References == Category:Choirs in Massachusetts Category:Gay men's choruses Category:Musical groups established in 1982 Category:1982 establishments in Massachusetts ",
