La Mancha is an arid but fertile plateau (610 m or 2000 ft.) that stretches from the mountains of Toledo to the western spurs of the hills of Cuenca, and bordered to the south by the Sierra Morena and to the north by the Alcarria region. La Mancha includes portions of the modern provinces of Cuenca, Toledo, and Albacete, and most of the Ciudad Real province. La Mancha historical comarca constitutes the southern portion of Castilla-La Mancha autonomous community and makes up most of the present-day administrative region. ==Name== The name \"La Mancha\" is probably derived from the Arabic word \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0634\u0623 al-mansha, meaning \"birthplace\" or \"fountainhead\". The name of the city of Almansa in Albacete also has the same origin.Castilla-La Mancha The word mancha in Spanish literally means spot, stain, or patch, but no apparent link exists between this word and the name of the region. ==Geography== Pastures and sheep in La Mancha The largest plain in Spain, La Mancha is made up of a plateau averaging 500 to 600 metres in altitude (although it reaches 900 metres in Campo de Montiel and other parts), centering on the province of Ciudad Real. The region is watered by the Guadiana, Jabal\u00f3n, Z\u00e1ncara, Cig\u00fcela, and J\u00facar rivers. Landscape of the fields in La Mancha ==Climate== The climate is cold semi-arid (K\u00f6ppen BSk), with strong fluctuations. Farming (wheat, barley, oats, sugar beets, wine grapes, olives) and cattle raising are the primary economic activities, but they are severely restricted by the harsh environmental conditions. ==Culture== The 250px Culturally, La Mancha includes the Sierra de Alcaraz, northern Sierra Morena, Montes de Toledo and Serran\u00eda de Cuenca, parts of Tajo river valley, and it is administratively divided among the comarcas of Campo de Montiel and Campo de ras de Oca\u00f1a y Manchuela to the north. The inhabitants are called Manchegos. ==Agriculture== La Mancha has always been an important agricultural zone. Viticulture is important in Tomelloso, Alc\u00e1zar de San Juan, Socu\u00e9llamos, Valdepe\u00f1as, La Solana and Manzanares, in Ciudad Real and Villarrobledo in Albacete. Other crops include cereals (hence the famous windmills) and saffron. Sheep are raised and bred, providing the famous Manchego cheese, as are goats, including the La Mancha goat, one of the assumed progenitors of the American La Mancha goat. La Mancha includes two National Parks, Las Tablas de Daimiel and Caba\u00f1eros, and one Natural Park, Las Lagunas de Ruidera. ==People== Famous Spaniards like the cinema directors Pedro Almod\u00f3var and Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuerda, painters Antonio L\u00f3pez and his uncle Antonio L\u00f3pez Torres, footballer Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, music band Angelus Apatrida and actress Sara Montiel were born in La Mancha. ==La Mancha and Cervantes== Don Quixote statue at La Mancha Inn, Spain Alcal\u00e1 del J\u00facar, La Mancha Miguel de Cervantes described La Mancha and its windmills in his two-part 1605/1615 novel Don Quixote de La Mancha. Cervantes was making fun of the region, using a pun; a \"mancha\" was also a stain, as on one's honor, and thus an inappropriately-named homeland for a dignified knight-errant.A Noise Within Translator John Ormsby believed that Cervantes chose it because it was the most ordinary, prosaic, anti-romantic, and therefore unlikely place from which a chivalrous, romantic hero could originate, making Quixote seem even more absurd. However, due to the fame of Cervantes' character, the name of La Mancha did become associated worldwide with romantic chivalry. Several film versions of Don Quixote have been filmed largely in La Mancha. However, some, including the 1957 Russian film version, and the screen version of Man of La Mancha, were not. The 1957 film was shot in Crimea, while Man of La Mancha was filmed in Italy. G.W. Pabst's 1933 version of Cervantes's novel was shot in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. The 2000 made-for-TV Don Quixote, starring John Lithgow as Don Quixote and Bob Hoskins as Sancho Panza, was shot on several locations in Spain, but not in La Mancha. ==See also== *Manchuela (\"lesser La Mancha\"), a comarca in La Mancha. *La Mancha (DO), a Spanish Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen (DO) for wines. *Manche, a coastal department in Normandy, France. *The English Channel, known in Spanish as Canal de la Mancha. ==References== ==External links== * *Folk music from La Mancha Category:Castilla\u2013La Mancha Category:Geography of Castilla\u2013La Mancha Category:Historical regions in Spain Category:Natural regions Category:Comarcas of Castilla\u2013La Mancha ",
