The series was first released on Youku Kids on June 28, 2019. ==Synopsis== The series is set on a fictional island city called Wheelford which is inhabited by anthropomorphic motor bikes. ==Characters== ===Main=== * Ricky Zoom (voiced by Max Fincham) - A red motorcycle with dark blue eyes and equipped with rescue gadgets who dreams of becoming a rescue bike like his parents. His symbol is a Z, which stands for his last name. * Loop Hoopla (voiced by Keith Wickham) - A blue dirt bike with green eyes and paddle tires who can hover via boosters on his side. He loves doing wild stunts. His symbol is a spiral. Loop is the only Bike Buddy other than Ricky to have a sibling, but he is also the only one not to have his mother appear. * DJ Rumbler - A green 3-wheeled ATV motorcycle with brown eyes, and is equipped with a robotic arm. His symbol is a criss-cross screwdriver and hammer. * Scootio Wizzbang (voiced by Finty Williams) - A yellow scooter with blue eyes, and is equipped with a drone and miniature robots called ScootBops. She keeps a tablet in her front wheel arch. Her symbol is a sun. Scootio is the only female of the main four Bike Buddies. ===Recurring=== * Toot Zoom (voiced by Frances White) - A little lavender motorcycle with blue eyes, and Ricky's younger sister. Sweet yet sassy, Toot is always eager to get in on some fun with the Bike Buddies whenever she can \u2013 though her habit of recounting embarrassing tales and titbits about Ricky means that although he adores her, he can be resistant to having her around! They think of her rather like an extra set of wheels: nice to have around when you need them, but whoever heard of a bike with four wheels?! However, though smaller than the other buddies, Toot is impossible to ignore \u2013 and often ends up stealing the show! * Hank Zoom - A red adult motorcycle with blue eyes who is Ricky and Toot's father. He has a special job as a rescue bike which Ricky wants to be when he grows up. * Helen Zoom - An orange adult motorcycle with green eyes who is Ricky and Toot's mother. She had a past life as the Wheelford Wheeler, a bike who rescues those in need and vanishes before anyone found out who she was. * Dasher Zoom - An Lightblue pre-teenage motorcycle with green eyes which is Ricky and Toot's cousin and Hank and Helen's nephew, he loves racing. * Steel Awesome - A superhero that Ricky idolizes. Movie star, comic-book hero and huge celebrity, stunt bike Steel Awesome has packs of adoring fans\u2026 including himself! Bold, brave and handsome (and doesn\u2019t he know it!), he loves doing his own extravagant movie stunts. Though he can be who absurdly over-the-top, Steel is the epitome of what an action bike can be, and Ricky idolises him for it. Ricky dreams of becoming his sidekick, Vroom Boy, so that Steel will teach him all he knows about being a daring and courageous bike. He speaks with an American accent. * Maxwell - A bike who runs the garage. Good-natured Maxwell and his Service Station are at the heart of the community, providing everything a bike needs along with the latest Wheelford news and gossip, as well as plenty of tales of the good ol\u2019 days! A trusted and valued member of the community, Maxwell is also leader of Ramp Camp, the outdoor club that all the Buddies love being a part of, and he enjoys using his experience of the world to help the Buddies learn and grow. * Blip Hoopla - Loop\u2019s big brother, 13-year-old Blip will deliver just about anything, to anyone, anywhere \u2013 but he still has a lot to learn about being a good delivery bike. He seems to have a knack for losing things and, though he tries very hard to be careful, something always seems to upset his deliveries. He sometimes feels that the whole universe is against him. *Don Hoopla - Blip and Loop's father is Wheelford\u2019s resident mail carrier who takes great pride in making sure every parcel is delivered safely to its rightful owner. A skilled off-road bike like Loop, he delivers the mail come rain, shine, or snow! Don also delivers pizzas in addition to the mail, and always carries pictures of Loop and Blip with him. * Whoopie Wizzbang - Scootio's mother. * Fred Wizzbang - Scootio's father. * Della Rumbler - DJ's mother and a construction worker. Her name is not mentioned in the series. * Jake Rumbler - DJ's father and a construction worker. * Officer Bunker - Wheelford\u2019s police bike, Officer Bunker takes his duties very seriously indeed! He has committed each and every last rule of the Wheelford Highway Code to heart and patrols its highways and byways ensuring that bikes, both young and old, abide by the rules to ensure the safety of the townsfolk. But behind his strict exterior lies a heart of gold. He\u2019s really just a big softy who particularly loves the Bike Buddies, seeing a lot of himself as a young bike in them. He\u2019d love to impart the lessons he\u2019s learned since he took off his training wheels \u2014 if only the would stay still long enough to listen! He is the only bike that can get out of a pothole on his own. * Buster Bunker (voiced by Edward Moloney) - Officer Bunker's grandson and Toot's best friend. * Mrs. Bikely - An enthusiastic and inspiring teacher, Mrs Bikely is committed to helping her students grow up to be the best bikes they can be.
