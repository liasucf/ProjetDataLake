The fortress was used by the Nizari Ismailis of the Alamut period. It was connected to the nearby major stronghold of Ghal'eh Kuh of Ferdows and to the city of Tun itself via secret tunnels discovered after the 1968 Dasht-e Bayaz and Ferdows earthquakes. The fortifications of Tun were destroyed in May 1256 by the invading Mongols under Kitbuqa and K\u00f6ke Ilgei. ==References== Category:Ismaili castles Category:Buildings and structures in South Khorasan Province Category:Ferdows Category:Tourist attractions in Ferdows County Category:Ruined castles in Iran ",
