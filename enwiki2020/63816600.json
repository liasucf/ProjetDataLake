    "text": "Suite! is a double album by jazz pianist Roberto Magris released on the JMood label in 2019, featuring performances by Magris with his group from Chicago. ==Reception== The All About Jazz review by Dan McClenaghan awarded the album 4 \u00bd stars and simply states: \u201cThe quick opinion on Suite!: the most successfully ambitious recording in Magris' discography, his magnum opus. Many double albums showcase the artist reaching a pinnacle of expression. For Roberto Magris, Suite! does just that, as the pianist / bandleader takes a step in the direction of social consciousness and spirituality with a killer band.\u201d The All About Jazz review by Edward Blanco awarded the album 4 \u00bd stars and simply states: \u201cSuite! is much more than an excellent jazz recording, it's a collection of wonderful music helpful in conveying and spreading a little peace, love and happiness, needed now, more than ever. Where and when have we heard this before?\u201d The All About Jazz review by Karl Ackermann awarded the album 4 stars and simply states: \u201cSuite! is Magris' best work to date and should appeal to a wide jazz audience.\u201d The All About Jazz review by Jack Bowers awarded the album 4 stars and simply states: \u201cMagris follows his own star and keeps the focus on expertise and variety, pressing his purpose with flair and leaving any verdict, pro or con, in the capable hands of his audience.\u201d The Jazz Journal review by Brian Morton awarded the album 4 stars and simply states: \"He\u2019s absolutely fluent in the blues-based American tradition, but his playing and his structural ideas bespeak a European sensibility. The two are never in contention but seem to co-exist warmly and always creatively.\" The Chicago Jazz Magazine review by Hrayr Attarian simply states: \u201cSuite! is, perhaps, Magris\u2019 magnum opus. It is certainly his most mature as it demonstrates his brilliant pianism and his astute leadership. Here, Magris has enhanced his signature superb musicianship with a much-needed social consciousness as well as an uplifting spirituality.\u201d ==Track listing== ;CD 1 # In the Wake of Poseidon (Aubree Collins/Robert Fripp) - 8:19 # Sunset Breeze (Roberto Magris) - 10:36 # A Message for a World to Come (Roberto Magris) - 16:30 # Too Young to Go Steady (Jimmy McHugh) - 7:42 # Suite!
