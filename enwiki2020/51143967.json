Other possible parents were Phorcys and Ceto, and Hesperus. Literally, her name means \"Starry-Faced\"., a compound of \u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1 (\u00e1st\u0113r, \"star\") and \u1f44\u03c8 (ops, \"face\"), but its idiomatic meaning is \"lightning\". She also has another name she sometimes uses: Hesperia, which is probably linked to one of her putative parents. == Namings == \"Garden of the Hesperides\" By Albert Herter, 1898 Asterope is a genus of butterflies of the family Nymphalidae. ==References== Category:Nymphs ",
