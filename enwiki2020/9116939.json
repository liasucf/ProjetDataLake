It has been incorporated into a municipality in the La Vega province on September 9, 1907.

The valley is 8 km long and 4 km wide. === Climate === Constanza has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfb), with moderately warm and humid summers, and dry and mild winters, due to its tropical location and high elevation.

The mountains surrounding the valley of Constanza are covered in Hispaniolan pine (Pinus occidentalis) forests. Typical fauna seen in the area includes the Hispaniolan palm crow, Antillean siskin, rufous-throated solitaire, Hispaniolan crossbill (abundance directly related to pine cone crop), and Hispaniolan trogon, while at lower elevations the Hispaniolan parrot, scaly-naped pigeon and golden swallow can be seen. ==Transportation== The town can be reached either by local airlines through the Constanza Airport or through local bus companies. ==Demographics== Japanese-Dominicans in Constanza Constanza is home to an unusual combination of ethnic groups, having been an area settled by numerous Spanish, Arabians and Japanese immigrant workers encouraged to come to the Dominican Republic during the infamous dictatorship of Trujillo. Now some two or three generations on their presence is still substantial in the area. They were attracted by the cooler climate that goes on all year round. ==References== Category:Populated places in La Vega Province Category:Municipalities of the Dominican Republic Category:1894 establishments in North America ",
