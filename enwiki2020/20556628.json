Twelve years later, his only son Shankar (Uttam Kumar), who lives with his mother (Sobha Sen) in Patna, comes to Krishnanagar to prove his father's innocence and bring the actual perpetrators to justice. There he falls in love with Rita (Suchitra Sen), a girl who too had a life history of injustice. Together, they secretly conjure up various evidences against the actual criminal, a government lawyer(Nitish Mukherjee) who originally fought the case against his father 12 years back. In all this, they get the help of Rita's journalist brother (Pahari Sanyal) who, through his articles and friends in the Press, gathers public momentum to finally reopen the case. Shankar presents the case himself and through various evidences and tact presentations, successfully pleads in favour of his father and proves the involvement of the actual criminal, the government lawyer, who killed Hemangini to benefit from a huge insurance in her name.
