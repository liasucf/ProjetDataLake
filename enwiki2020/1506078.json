Although her acting career began in Budapest, and she later worked in France, Austria, and Germany, B\u00e1nky was best known for her roles in the American films The Eagle and The Son of the Sheik with Rudolph Valentino and several romantic teamings with Ronald Colman. ==Early life== B\u00e1nky was born on 9 January 1901 to J\u00e1nos B\u00e1nky Koncsics (1875-1948) and his wife, Katalin Ulbert (1880-1947) in Nagydorog, Austria-Hungary. Her father was a bureau chief in Franz Joseph's Austro-Hungarian Empire. Shortly after her birth, her father, a police sergeant was transferred to Budapest, and the family relocated. She had two siblings \u2013 an older brother, Gyula and a younger sister, Gizella. After graduation from secondary school, B\u00e1nky (as she would later be known) took courses to work as a stenographer, but was offered a role in a film. Her first film appearance was in the now lost film, Im Letzten Augenblick (In the last moment), directed by Carl Boese in Germany in 1919. On a trip to Budapest in 1925, Hollywood film producer Samuel Goldwyn discovered and signed her to a contract. Both her mother and father were vehemently against B\u00e1nky's acting career as was her fianc\u00e9; nonetheless, she left for the United States in March 1925, arriving to a great deal of fanfare. ==Career== She was hailed as \"The Hungarian Rhapsody\" and was an immediate hit with American audiences. The New York Times remarked in its review of her first American film, The Dark Angel (1925), that she \"is a young person of rare beauty ... so exquisite that one is not in the least surprised that she is never forgotten by Hillary Trent\"The New York Times Directory of Film, 'The Dark Angel' film review by Mordaunt Hall, 12 October 1925, pg. 17, Arno Press and Random House, USA, 1971 (the movie's leading male character who decides to allow his family and fiancee to believe him dead rather than place what he perceives as the burden on them of a life caring for a blinded war veteran). Vilma B\u00e1nky, 1920s She appeared opposite silent film star Rudolph Valentino in The Eagle (1925) and The Son of the Sheik (1926). Valentino reportedly was fascinated by Vilma, and he chose her as the leading lady in the films. She also appeared opposite Ronald Colman in a series of love stories, including The Dark Angel and The Winning of Barbara Worth. It commonly is believed that her thick Hungarian accent cut her career short with the advent of sound; however, she began losing interest in films and wanted to settle down with Rod La Rocque and simply be his wife. By 1928, she had begun announcing her intention to retire in a few years. Of her 24 films, eight exist in their entirety (Hotel Potemkin, Der Zirkusk\u00f6nig (The King of the Circus) with Max Linder, The Son of the Sheik, The Eagle, The Winning of Barbara Worth, The Night of Love, A Lady to Love, and The Rebel), and three exist in fragments (Tavaszi szerelem in scattered bits, the first five reels of The Magic Flame, and an incomplete copy of Two Lovers). ==Post- acting career== Her post-Hollywood years were spent selling real estate with her husband and playing golf, her favorite sport. In 1981, B\u00e1nky established an educational fund, the Banky\u2013La Rocque Foundation. ==Personal life and death== B\u00e1nky and husband Rod La Rocque in 1927 She married actor Rod La Rocque in 1927; they remained married until his death in 1969. The couple had no children. B\u00e1nky died on 18 March 1991, from cardiopulmonary failure, aged 90, but notice of her death was not made public until the following year. She was reportedly upset that no one had come to visit her in her last years, and directed her lawyer to make no mention of her death. Her ashes were scattered at sea where her husband's had been consigned. For her contributions to the film industry, B\u00e1nky received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. Her star is located at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Films |- ! Year ! Title !
