    "text": "Tonight (also released as Straight No Chaser) is an album by the Clark Terry- Bob Brookmeyer Quintet, featuring Brookmeyer on trombone and Terry on trumpet and flugelhorn. With tracks recorded in 1964, the album was released on the Mainstream label the following year.Edwards, D., Callahan, Eyries, P., Watts, R. & Neely, T. Discography of the Mainstream Label (Preview), accessed November 10, 2014Lord, T., Clark Terry discography, accessed November 10, 2014 ==Background== The Clark Terry - Bob Brookmeyer Quintet had formed in 1961 at the request of Frank Cantarina, the owner of the Half Note Club in New York City. The original group, consisting of Terry and Brookmeyer with Joe Benjamin (bass), Osie Johnson (drums) and Eddie Costa (piano), had recorded, for another label, a live session at the club. But the recording had to be abandoned because of the \"horrible intonation of the piano\". Brookmeyer had made the first advances to Terry, but Terry was under network contract and could only take outside engagements as a band leader - hence the name of the quintet and the name of the album. The band were featured several times \"with unanimous acceptance\" on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.Peter Spargo, Tonight album liner notes, 1965. ==Style== Writing the liner notes for the original 1965 album, Peter Spargo writes: \".. the blend between Terry's horn and Brookmeyer's valve trombone is warm and original\". He refers to the \"brilliant piano work\" of Kellaway and describes drummer Bailey's performance as having \"impeccable taste and controlled nuances.\" Of the bass playing of Bill Crow, Spargo says \"his lines are clear and interesting, the pitch crisp and audible and he gives the entire group a solid foundation.\" Of the album overall, Spargo says: > With such a brilliant rhythm section it is obvious that Clark and Bob feel > relaxed and are allowed complete independence. It is also apparent from > their ensemble duets that they are in complete control and know exactly what > they want. Their individual solos are always intelligent and meaningful. So > as Clark apologized for having kept you waiting, it is safe to that this > album was worth waiting for. ==Reception== Awarding the album 3 stars, AllMusic's Scott Yanow stated: \"Flugelhornist Clark Terry and valve trombonist Bob Brookmeyer made for a very complementary pair in their mid-'60s quintet. Both had distinctive but similar sounds, impressive technique, the ability to swing anything and plenty of wit... Unfortunately, all ten selections clock in at around three minutes, so there is no real stretching out, but what is here is excellent\".Yanow, S.
