The witnesses insisted that the girl had in fact been a well-functioning, normal child who was coached into faking her illness when doctors and officials were present. Sweden's public television network, SVT, interviewed Swedish pediatrician Karl Sallin as saying that the filmmakers had cherry-picked phrases from interviews with him in a \"reckless and dangerous\" fashion, distorting his view of the situation. SVT sought the producers repeatedly for comment, who chose not to respond. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2019 documentary films Category:2019 films Category:2019 short films Category:Short documentary films Category:Netflix original documentary films Category:English-language films Category:Swedish- language films Category:Refugees in Sweden Category:Documentary films about child refugees Category:Documentary films about children Category:Documentary films about health care ",
