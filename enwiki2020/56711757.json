In it, she refers to a portrait drawing of her husband by Thomas Gainsborough. Gainsborough having died in 1788, she asks Humphrey to complete the painted portrait. Caroline and her husband were also painted together by William Austin. Her own portrait, as a child, had been painted by Jean Etienne Liotard around 1754. She was also painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds around the time of her marriage, and later, with her eldest daughter. Queen Charlotte, consort of King George III, is reputed to have called Caroline \"the proudest woman in England\".G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H.
