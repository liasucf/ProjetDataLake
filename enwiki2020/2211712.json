    "text": "Manon Lescaut is an opera or op\u00e9ra comique in 3 acts by Daniel Auber to a libretto by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe, and, like Puccini's Manon Lescaut and Massenet's Manon, is based on the Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost's novel Manon Lescaut (1731). Auber's version is nowadays the least-performed of the three. == Performance history == The opera was premiered on 23 February 1856 by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique at the second Salle Favart in Paris. It was the first work to be staged by that company that did not have a happy ending.J-L Tamvaco: \"Auber, a Paris celebrity\" in the Wexford Festival Opera programme book, 2002. It was staged in Li\u00e8ge in 1875, revived at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in 1882,Loewenberg, col. 920 and regularly performed in Germany as well as France. However, since the dawn of the twentieth century stagings have become something of a rarity. In North America, the opera was performed in 2006 by the Lyric Opera of Los Angeles at the Los Angeles Theatre. In 1990, it was staged at the Op\u00e9ra Comique de Paris with the Picardy Sinfonietta in Amiens conducted by Patrick Fournillier. Next year the live recording of the opera was released by the French label Le Chant du Monde. Another stage performance took place at the Wexford Festival in October/November, 2002. == Roles == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Role !Voice type !Premiere cast, 23 February 1856 (Conductor: Th\u00e9ophile Tilmant) |- |Manon Lescaut |coloratura soprano |Marie Cabel |- |Des Grieux |tenor |Henri Puget |- |Le Marquis d'H\u00e9rigny |baritone |Jean-Baptiste Faure |- |Lescaut, Manon's cousin |bass |Beckers |- |Marguerite, Manon's friend |soprano |L\u00e9ocadie Lemercier |- |Gervais, her fianc\u00e9 |tenor |Jourdan |- |Madame Bancelin, cabaret hostess |mezzo-soprano |Mme F\u00e9lix |- |Monsieur Durozeau, commissaire |baritone |Lemaire |- |Monsieur Renaud, Inspector |baritone |Nathan |- |Zaby, a young slave |soprano |Mlle B\u00e9lia |- |A Sergeant |bass |Duvernoy |- |Two bourgeois | | |- | colspan=\"3\"|Court nobles, Bourgeois of the Boulevard du Temple, Soldiers, Male and female workers; Inhabitants of New Orleans, negroes, colonial soldiers |} == Synopsis == The story only loosely resembles the original novel by Pr\u00e9vost (where, for instance, Lescaut is Manon's brother, not her cousin). There is one character \u2013 the Marquis d'Herigny \u2013 who represents the several wealthy suitors that Manon became involved with in the novel. Some other characters are absent entirely, and others are completely new to this telling of the story. == Music == The role of Manon Lescaut is a demanding one, with a very high tessitura, extended florid passages and arias of outstanding technical difficulty. Nonetheless, it also presents great opportunities for characterisation and (at least before the appearance of the operas on the same subject by Puccini and Massenet) was one of the staples of the operatic repertoire \u2013 not only in France, but also in Germany. The role of the Marquis d'Herigny, written for the famous baritone, Jean-Baptiste Faure, also features several significant solos; but the tenor role of Des Grieux (given two major arias by Massenet and three by Puccini) lacks a major solo, although the character does participate in a series of fine duets, notably at the death of Manon near the end of the opera. One number in the score has retained its popularity with coloratura sopranos. This is Manon's solo, \"\", also known as \"\" or the \"Laughing Song\". It is not a free-standing aria \u2013 in fact, it forms part of the act 1 finale \u2013 but ever since its creation it has been a chosen showcase for the technique of singers such as Adelina Patti (who sang it during the lesson scene in The Barber of Seville), Amelita Galli-Curci, Joan Sutherland and Edita Gruberov\u00e1. ==Recordings== * Manon Lescaut \u2013 Mady Mespl\u00e9, Jean-Claude Orliac, , Yves Bisson \u2013 Choeurs et orchestre lyrique de Radio France, Jean-Pierre Marty (conductor) \u2013 EMI (recorded in October 1974). * Manon Lescaut \u2013 Elizabeth Vidal, Alain Gabriel, Ren\u00e9 Massis \u2013 Les Choeurs du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais de la Musique, the Orchestre R\u00e9gional de Picardie Le Sinfonietta, Patrick Fournillier (conductor) \u2013 Le Chant du Monde (recorded live in 1990, released in 1991). ==References== Notes Sources *, Annals of Opera, 1597\u20131940.
