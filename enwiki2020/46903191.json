(The text notes that the sex was consensual and only appears to be rape.)Erica Schwiegershausen, \"Emma Sulkowicz Made a Film Addressing Rape\", New York Magazine, 5 June 2015. The online response in the comments to the video is a central part of the work, described as an example of participatory art. Sulkowicz wanted to know \"what the public does with [the video], which begins with the way they deal with it from the moment it's disseminated.\"Cait Munro, \"Emma Sulkowicz Speaks Out About Her New Video Performance\", ArtNet, 4 June 2015. Shortly after it appeared, the video was taken offline by a denial-of- service attack.Lauren Gambino, \"Emma Sulkowicz's This Is Not A Rape site taken down by cyberattack\", The Guardian, 9 June 2015.

Sulkowicz said she strongly believed in the video's importance, but that making it had been a \"traumatizing\" experience. ==Background== Emma Sulkowicz, 2014 Emma Sulkowicz, a non-binary artist who uses both she/her and they/them pronouns, obtained a degree in visual arts from Columbia University in 2015.For age, \"Carry That Weight\", Emma Sulkowicz interviewed by Roberta Smith, Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, Brooklyn Museum, 14 December 2014, c. 48:50 mins.Vanessa Grigoriadis, \"Meet the College Women Who Are Starting a Revolution Against Campus Sexual Assault\", New York Magazine, 21 September 2014. Sulkowicz's senior thesis and first notable artwork was Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight) (2014\u20132015), which consisted of Sulkowicz carrying a mattress wherever she went on campus during her final year, in protest against campus sexual assault and the university's handling of a complaint she filed against a student she said anally raped her.Roberta Smith, \"In a Mattress, a Lever for Art and Political Protest\", The New York Times, 21 September 2014. The university cleared the student of responsibility; the district attorney's office declined to pursue criminal charges, citing lack of reasonable suspicion. Max Kutner, \"The Anti-Mattress Protest\", Newsweek, 28 April 2015. ==Work== ===Overview=== Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol consists of a website that hosts a video, an introductory text and an open comments section. Its existence was made public by a Facebook post from the video's director, Ted Lawson. Sulkowicz says she had the idea for the piece in December 2014, and that performance artist Marina Abramovi\u0107 put her in touch with Lawson to direct it. Lawson told ArtNet that he thought the piece was \"super risky\" and courageous. Sulkowicz stressed that it was a separate piece from Mattress Performance. Sulkowicz wrote the script and introductory text, chose the position of the cameras, the lighting and the appearance of it having been filmed by security cameras. The scene was filmed in one continuous take three times during the Columbia spring break in March 2015. According to Lawson, Sulkowicz had \"insisted on it being completely real. ... That's what makes it a performance art piece.\" Sulkowicz told the Guardian that making the video had been traumatizing, and had left her in a \"very scared, emotional state for days.\" Sulkowicz said elsewhere that vulnerability is part of what makes performance art good. ===Text=== The introductory text said that the video was not an enactment of Sulkowicz's rape allegation. Rather, \"Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol ... [is] about your decisions, starting now.\" Sulkowicz gives only provisional consent to view the video: > Do not watch this video if your motives would upset me, my desires are > unclear to you, or my nuances are indecipherable. You might be wondering why > I've made myself this vulnerable. Look\u2014I want to change the world, and that > begins with you, seeing yourself. If you watch this video without my > consent, then I hope you reflect on your reasons for objectifying me and > participating in my rape, for, in that case, you were the one who couldn't > resist the urge to make Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol about what you wanted to make > it about: rape. Please, don't participate in my rape. Watch kindly.Lauren > Gambino, \"Columbia graduate who carried mattress releases video depicting > 'rape'\", The Guargian, 5 June 2015. She then asks a series of questions: \"Are you searching for ways to either hurt or help me? ... Do you think I'm the perfect victim or the world's worst victim? ... Do you hate me? If so, how does it feel to hate me?\" ===Video=== The scene is shown on a split screen from four angles, with a timestamp in each corner, beginning 02:10 and ending 02:18. Lawson said the security-camera perspective \"removes the wall between the viewer and the action.\"Teo Armus, \"Sulkowicz films herself in a violent sex scene for newest art project\", Columbia Spectator, 5 June 2015. The video begins with Sulkowicz and the actor, whose face is blurred, entering the room, undressing each other, then kissing and engaging in oral and vaginal sex, the latter with a condom. Three minutes into the video, the actor hits Sulkowicz several times, then removes the condom, pushes his hands and her legs against her neck or throat, and penetrates her anally. She screams, tells him to stop, and puts her hand over her face. After a short time, the actor stops abruptly and leaves the room with his clothes in his hands. Sulkowicz is left curled on the bed in the fetal position, with her back to the camera. After wrapping herself in a towel, she briefly leaves the room, returns and makes the bed, then appears to fall asleep. Lawson told the Columbia Spectator that Sulkowicz and the actor had captured the shift from the consensual to non-consensual: \"I think the video expresses the possibility that you don't forfeit that [consensuality] ever.\" ===Public comments=== Lawson said Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol explores the relationship between art and social media, \"this giant, polluted ocean.\" A key part of the work was the online reaction, particularly in the website's comments section. The 2,700 comments within the first five days were mostly critical or ridiculing. They included sexual, sexist and racist insults and threats. There were remarks about Sulkowicz's physical appearance, ethnicity, mental health, and that the scene did not depict rape.Suzannah Weiss, \"Emma Sulkowicz's 'Ceci N\u2019est Pas Un Viol' Site Was Temporarily Disabled By Cyberattacks, But Her Opponents Are Missing The Point\", Bustle, 9 June 2015.\"Hackers Disable Emma Sulkowicz Website to Censor New Artwork\", ArtNet, 9 June 2015.Melissa Chan, \"Columbia University anti-rape activist Emma Sulkowicz releases sex video as newest art piece\", New York Daily News, 6 June 2015. Someone posted the video on a porn site. Comments on other sites were both positive and negative. The video was the victim of a denial-of-service attack by hackers on 4 June, according to DigitalOcean, which hosts the site, and on 5 June there were technical problems caused by the numbers attempting to access it. ==Analysis== Newsweek called the video a \"harrowing document,\" while Priscilla Frank in The Huffington Post described it as \"simple yet stinging, providing imagery that lingers like a nightmare, never quite comprehensible but impossible to forget.\"Paul Mejia, \"Columbia University Mattress Protester Releases Video Addressing Rape\", Newsweek, 6 June 2015. In the German edition of The Huffington Post, Benjamin Pr\u00fcfer was less positive, calling it an \"art video that can only be described as pornography.\"Benjamin Pr\u00fcfer, \"Kunst oder krank? Angebliches Vergewaltigungsopfer dreht verst\u00f6rendes Sex-Video\". The Huffington Post, 11 June 2015. Hannah Rubin, writing in The Forward, called it \"sophisticated and brilliant,\" and despaired of the lack of empathy on display in the website's comments section. According to Julie Zeilinger, the video was \"unsettling\" for Sulkowicz's supporters, and several questioned the approach.Julie Zeilinger, \"Emma Sulkowicz Isn't the Only Artist Taking on Sexual Assault. Here Are 5 Others\", 'Identities.Mic, 8 June 2015. On Slate's DoubleX Gabfest podcast, Hanna Rosin argued that the split-screen forces the viewer to embrace the subjective, in terms of choosing whether and how to watch, and how to interpret, which is the opposite of activism because it is too nuanced. The broadcast noted that Sandra Leong, Sulkowicz's mother, had written on Facebook in support of the work.Hanna Rosin, Noreen Malone and June Thomas, \"DoubleX Gabfest: The Triple X Edition\", Slate, 11 June 2015, from c. 09:00 mins; c 18:00 for Sandra Leong. Suzannah Weiss wrote in Bustle that Sulkowicz's provisional consent to watch the video is a metaphor for sexual consent. The video is there to watch, but the viewer has a decision to make. No one has consent to watch with hostility or if they are unsure of the artist's desires. No one has consent to post it to a porn site. If the artist's terms are disregarded, the viewing is non-consensual. Rebecca Brink argued in The Frisky that, as well as illustrating the nature of sexual consent, Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol challenges the position that art, once made public, is removed from the artist's control and is for the viewer alone to interpret.Rebecca Brink, \"Emma Sulkowicz's \u201cCeci N\u2019est Pas Un Viol\u201d: An Explainer\", The Frisky, 5 June 2015. ==See also== *Authorial intent *Death of the author ==References== Category:2015 works Category:Civil rights protests in the United States Category:Columbia University Category:Performances Category:Feminist art Category:Performance art in New York City Category:Political art Category:Works about rape ",
