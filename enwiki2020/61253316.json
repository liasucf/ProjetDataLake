The Miss\u00e3o Centen\u00e1rio was born of an agreement between the Brazilian Space Agency (AEB) and the Roscosmos on October 18, 2005. The main objective of this treaty would be to send the first Brazilian into space, Lt. Col. Aviator Marcos Pontes. The name of the mission is a reference to the commemoration of the centenary of the first crewed flight of an aircraft, the 14 Bis of Santos Dumont, Paris, October 23, 1906. The vehicle used for launching the mission was the Roscosmos Soyuz TMA-8 spacecraft, and its launch took place on March 30, 2006 (11:30 p.m Bras\u00edlia time) at the Baikonur Cosmodrome (Kazakhstan) to International Space Station (ISS). == Bilateral agreement for the mission == The Miss\u00e3o Centen\u00e1rio was made possible by an agreement signed in October 2005 between Brazil and Russia, with representatives of the Brazilian Space Agency (AEB) and Roscosmos. As a result, astronaut Marcos Cesar Pontes began training in Star City, a training center for cosmonauts near Moscow. == Launch == The Soyuz TMA-8 spacecraft carrying Lieutenant Colonel Marcos Pontes was launched at 11:30 p.m. on March 30, 2006 (Bras\u00edlia time, 8:30 p.m. in the morning of April 1, 2006 in Kazakhstan time) . Besides the Brazilian astronaut, the crew were the Russian Pavel Vinogradov and the American Jeffrey Williams, these two members of Expedition 13. When Pavel Vinagrodov hooked up the cabin video camera to Marcos Pontes during the launch, the Brazilian did not know what to say. He thought of waving, but that did not express what he felt, then he pointed to the flag and then up, meaning that they were all together, but he thought \"wait a moment, pointing with one finger does not give the impression of 'together'!\". So he pointed with two, as you can see in the video of the mission. The spacecraft docked with the International Space Station (ISS) in the early hours of Saturday, April 1. Prior to entry to the International Space Station, the international protocol included the following order: Pavel, Jeff and Marcos. But when Pavel noticed Marcos with the Brazilian flag in his hands, he told him to come in first. Marcos replied that they might have problems. To this, the Russian replied that it would not be Marcos who would be entering the front, but a whole nation, and neither he nor Jeff would have the right to enter before a nation. ==Experiments== Lt. Col. Marcos Pontes carried out eight scientific experiments at ISS, so that their behavior in a microgravity environment could be analyzed. Here are the experiments performed:ISS: Expedition 13 ===Technological experiments=== #Capillary Evaporator in Microgravity (UFSC), Dr. Edson Bazzo; #Mini Heat Pipe (UFSC), Dra. M\u00e1rcia Barbosa Henriques Mantelli; ===Scientific experiments=== #Microgravity enzyme kinetics (FEI), Dr. Alessandro La Neve; #(Seed) Germination in Microgravity (EMBRAPA), Dra. Antonieta Nassif Salom\u00e3o; #Protein Interaction Clouds (CenPRA/MCT), Dr. Aristides Pavani Filho; #DNA Repair in Microgravity (UERJ and INPE), Dr. Heitor Evangelista da Silva; ===Educational Experiments=== #Germination of common bean seeds (Secretaria Municipal de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos-SP); #Observation of the Chlorophyll Chromatography Process in Weightlessness (Secretaria Municipal de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos-SP). Experiments 7 and 8 from the list above were accompanied by students from schools in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos through the Internet, while conducting the same experiments on ground. ==Interviews== During his stay at ISS, Marcos Pontes gave some interviews by video- conference. On April 3, 2006, an interview was broadcast in honor of Santos Dumont, in which Marcos Pontes used a Panama hat like the inventor and a handkerchief with the acronym SD. ==Return== The Soyuz TMA-7 brought in the night of April 8, 2006, Brasilia time, the Ten. Col. Marcos Pontes and two other astronauts from Expedition 12 (Russian Valery Tokarev and American William McArthur) who were already on the ISS. The landing point was in Kazakhstan. For the rescue, 17 Russian MI-8 helicopters were used, and the area of the landing was around the city Arclalic, within a radius of 60 to 80 km away from it. After the return, the three astronauts underwent a period of readaptation to gravity. === Total duration of the mission === Marcos Pontes performed 155 orbits and the total duration of his mission was 9 days, 21 hours and 17 minutes. ===Patch=== The patch of the Miss\u00e3o Centen\u00e1rio was produced jointly by Secom, MCT and AEB. == Commemorative acts == As a celebration for this mission that was the first to bring a Brazilian astronaut into space, as well as being a tribute to the centenary of the first flight of an aircraft heavier than the air of Santos Dumont in Europe, stamps and a medal were released. == Criticism == The mission was criticized by part the Brazilian scientific community, such as the Sociedade Brasileira para o Progresso da Ci\u00eancia (SBPC), according to which the money invested in the mission should be used to train staff as well as investing in other types of scientific research. In addition, they report the non-compliance of the Brazilian participation in the construction of the ISS. Other critics denounced the political use and crossed out the trip as space tourism. The Brazilian Space Agency and Marcos Pontes rebuffed these criticisms, saying that the space program has never had so much visibility in the press, which would make it possible in the future to allocate more funds for space exploration. In addition, the mission may encourage children to study and pursue a scientific career.\"Marcos Pontes rebate cr\u00edticas e defende miss\u00e3o brasileira\" \"07/04/2006\" ==Gallery== File:Marcos Pontes at the Cosmonaut Hotel in Baikonur.jpg|Pontes signing the Baikonur Cosmodrome checkout hotel room, an Astronaut/Cosmonaut tradition File:Expedition 13 crew2.jpg|Marcos (center) with his crew members in the Soyuz factory File:Jsc2006e11926.jpg|Greeting guests while at Baikonur on launch day File:Train bringing the rocket to the launching area.jpg|Train bringing the rocket to the launching area File:SoyuzTMA8 Launch.jpg|Launch of Soyuz TMA-8 on March 30, 2006 File:Iss soyuztma8 launch sa 2.jpg|Pontes inside the Soyuz during launch to the ISS File:Abertura da escotilha da Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Espacial Internacional e boas vindas \u00e0 nova tripula\u00e7\u00e3o.webm|ISS Conference File:Marcos Pontes entrando na Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Espacial.jpg|Hatch opening File:Soyuz_TMA-7_spacecraft_departs_from_the_ISS.jpg|Soyuz TMA-7 leaving the Station with the Brazilian astronaut File:Lula Marcos Pontes.JPG|President Lula during a video-conference with the Brazilian astronaut, Marcos Pontes.
