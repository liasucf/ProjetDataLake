Hill commanded the 2nd Infantry Division at the Battle of Talavera. The night before the battle, Marshal Claude Victor mounted a surprise attack, swept aside two battalions of the King's German Legion and seized a key elevation. As Hill later recounted, \"I was sure it was the old Buffs, as usual, making some blunder.\"Glover, p 108 Nevertheless, he led a reserve brigade forward in the dark. In the short clash that followed, Hill was briefly grabbed and nearly captured by a Frenchman, but his troops recovered the summit. This is the first occasion on which Hill supposedly swore.Oman, p 118 Still leading the 2nd Division during Marshal Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na's 1810 invasion of Portugal, Hill fought at the Battle of Bussaco.

With his 14,000 men and 10 guns isolated on the east bank of the Nive by a broken bridge, Hill held off the attacks of Marshal Nicolas Soult's 30,000 soldiers and 22 guns.
