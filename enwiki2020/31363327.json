    "text": "Paska\u010d (; 1365) was a Serbian nobleman that served the Serbian Empire, with the title of knez. Together with his son, sevastokrator Vlatko, he founded the Psa\u010da Monastery, in which the ktetor fresco of his family (of three generations) has been preserved, painted between 1365 and 1371. He is depicted as an old man, grey-haired, holding the church model together with Vlatko in the centre. By Paska\u010d is his wife, noblewoman Ozra, and also their grandson, Uglje\u0161a. The family is wearing rich clothing. Nothing else is known of Paska\u010d; he is not mentioned in donation charters. His function in the state is unknown, and it is unknown in which capacity he received the title of knez. Mandi\u0107 theorizes that if Paska\u010d was a magnate, he would have succeeded Vojislav as the veliki knez, then Lazar could have received that title after Paska\u010d's death, possibly during the Empire. The fresco composition is valued highly, and is, as other 14th-century works, part of several special studies. ==Annotations== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * Category:14th-century Serbian nobility Category:People of the Serbian Empire Category:People from medieval Macedonia Category:Kriva Palanka Category:14th-century deaths ",
