On that day, near Oliveto, Italy, he single-handedly destroyed three enemy machine gun nests. He was awarded the Medal of Honor eight months later, on May 30, 1944. Slaton left the Army while still a Corporal. He died in 1961 and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in his birth city of Laurel, Mississippi. ==Medal of Honor citation== Corporal Slaton's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and > beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy in the vicinity of Oliveto, > Italy, on September 23, 1943. Cpl. Slaton was lead scout of an infantry > squad which had been committed to a flank to knock out enemy resistance > which had succeeded in pinning 2 attacking platoons to the ground. Working > ahead of his squad, Cpl. Slaton crept upon an enemy machinegun nest and, > assaulting it with his bayonet, succeeded in killing the gunner. When his > bayonet stuck, he detached it from the rifle and killed another gunner with > rifle fire. At that time he was fired upon by a machinegun to his immediate > left. Cpl. Slaton then moved over open ground under constant fire to within > throwing distance, and on his second try scored a direct hit on the second > enemy machinegun nest, killing 2 enemy gunners. At that time a third > machinegun fired on him 100 yards to his front, and Cpl. Slaton killed both > of these enemy gunners with rifle fire. As a result of Cpl. Slaton's heroic > action in immobilizing 3 enemy machinegun nests with bayonet, grenade, and > rifle fire, the 2 rifle platoons which were receiving heavy casualties from > enemy fire were enabled to withdraw to covered positions and again take the > initiative. Cpl. Slaton withdrew under mortar fire on order of his platoon > leader at dusk that evening. The heroic actions of Cpl. Slaton were far > above and beyond the call of duty and are worthy of emulation. ==See also== ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:1961 deaths Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:United States Army Medal of Honor recipients Category:People from Laurel, Mississippi Category:United States Army soldiers Category:1910 births Category:World War II recipients of the Medal of Honor ",
