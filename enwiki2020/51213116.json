Kubinski's second album, Hold the Sun (2007), established her on the singer/songwriter scene in NYC, Germany, Jamaica and elsewhere, as she toured the US (Borders Books and Music national \u201cArtist to Watch\u201d 2008).

Subsequently, Kubinski and Billy Joel collaborated on the lyrics for the song \"No Hard Feelings\", as reference in Mr Joel's biography written by Fred Schruers. In 2009, the movie Clear Blue Tuesday, a rock movie/musical following the lives of 11 New York city residents in the 7 years post-9/11, was released. The movie featured Kubinski's work as a singer, songwriter and actress. The following year, Kubinski's work in Nashville was released in a double album feature entitled LIVE at Camp Nashville. Her 4th album, Just Being Myself (2014), was produced by Edd Kalehoff, the composer/producer behind the music of Monday Night Football, The View, Good Morning America, and artists like Faith Hill, Britney Spears, and Sarah Vaughn. The album was a collaboration with pop/jazz trumpeter Chris Botti, who is featured on the track \u201cJe T\u2019aime\u201d, and in the re-imagined version of Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cBad Romance.\u201d Kubinski has used her songs to benefit numerous philanthropic causes, including autism spectrum disorder. One of her songs, Not So Different, was re-recorded in collaboration with the Goo Goo Dolls and Mary Ramsey from 10,000 Maniacs, and the release show raised $25,000 for the Institute for Autism Research in upstate NY. Not So Different later appeared on Kubinski's EP Onward, which was her Billboard Heatseekers debut. Holiday Magic, Kubinski's 6th album, also hit the Billboard Heatseekers chart and featured 3 original holiday songs as well as re-imagined covers of Little Drummer Boy, Sleigh Ride (featuring Matt Cusson), and a mashup of I'll Be Home for Christmas and Homeward Bound.
