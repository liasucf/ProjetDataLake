    "text": "Barbara Sue Turnbull (February 7, 1965 \u2013 May 10, 2015) was a Canadian quadriplegic news reporter and activist for those with physical disabilities. She grew up in Mississauga, Ontario. ==Shooting== Late in the evening of September 23, 1983 Turnbull, then an 18-year-old-student at Clarkson Secondary School, was working at her part-time job at a convenience store when 4 armed youths (Hugh Logan, Sutcliffe Logan, Warren Johnson and Clive Brown) robbed the establishment. Although she complied with their demands, Hugh Logan shot Barbara in the throat with a .357 Magnum severing her spine, leaving Turnbull paralyzed from the neck down. All 4 young men were arrested, convicted of attempted murder and other offences, and sent to prison. ==Education== In spite of the life-changing tragedy, Turnbull went on to journalism school in the Arizona State University, from 1987 - 1990, where she was the valedictorian of her graduating class. ==Journalistic career== Upon returning home to Toronto, Barbara Turnbull was hired by the Toronto Star as a reporter for the Life section of their newspaper. For her part, she would do articles about other people with disabilities that were similar to her own, as well research into spinal cord injury. ==Challenge To Famous Player Theatres== In 1993, Turnbull wanted to see a movie at Famous Player Theatres only to find little assistance was given to patrons with physical disabilities similar to hers. She sued the cinema chain to make them give more rights and accessibility for those in such circumstances. ==Illness and death== On Sunday, May 10, 2015, Barbara Turnbull died from complications with pneumonia, at age 50 years. Her funeral was held at Cathedral Church of St. James (Toronto). She is buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto. ==Order of Canada== On Canada Day July 1, 2015, Barbara Turnbull was posthumously called to the Order of Canada, for her journalism and for her dedication to helping to improve the lives of those suffering from quadriplegia. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1965 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Canadian women journalists Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Journalists from Ontario Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:Writers from Mississauga Category:People with tetraplegia Category:Toronto Star people Category:Canadian women non-fiction writers ",
