He played for the New Zealand cricket team in five Test matches as a wicket-keeper in the 1955-56 season - totalling seven runs in seven innings. He was born in Wellington. ==Life and career== McMahon studied engineering at Wellington Technical College between 1943 and 1948, playing cricket and rugby for the school. He served an apprenticeship with the railways as a fitter and turner. He made his first-class debut for Wellington in 1953-54 when Wellington's regular wicket-keeper Frank Mooney was touring South Africa with the Test team. Mooney retired after the 1954-55 Plunket Shield season, and McMahon returned to the side for Wellington's match against the touring MCC. He was selected for the tour of Pakistan and India in 1955-56, where he and Eric Petrie each played four of the eight Tests. McMahon played the First Test against West Indies in New Zealand later that season, but he then lost his place to Sammy Guillen, who had topped the batting averages in that season's Plunket Shield.Plunket Shield batting averages 1955-56 Mike Curtis took over the wicket-keeping for Wellington for the next three seasons,Mike Curtis at Cricket Archive but McMahon returned in 1959-60.
