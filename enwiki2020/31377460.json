    "text": "L'houcine \"Aussie\" Ouzgni (born 10 March 1984) is a Dutch-Moroccan Light Heavyweight/Middleweight Muay Thai kickboxer fighting out of Amsterdam, Netherlands for Top Team Beverwijk. Aussie is a firm fan favorite in the Netherlands due to his exciting style and knockout power, likened to a smaller version of fellow Dutch fighter Badr Hari. He is a three time Dutch national Muay Thai champion, currently competing within the It's Showtime organization. ==Biography/Career== Aussie began his career fighting on the local circuit in the Netherlands at C-Klass and B-Klass level, winning almost all his fights. He won his first title in 2005, winning a B-Klass eight-man tournament at a gala in Purmerend to honor the recently deceased Moroccan-Dutchboxer Nordin Ben-Salah who was shot dead in Amsterdam. Aussie stopped his first two opponents before defeating Peter Mes in the final via decision. He also headed to Morocco where he took part in the W.A.K.O. world championships, receiving a bronze medal in the Thai-Boxing middleweight division. In 2006 Aussie made his debut with the It's Showtime organization against Junior Gonsalves, sharing the spoils in a five round decision draw at the event in Alkmaar. He returned to the organization the following year to take part in a qualifying tournament for the It's Showtime's 75MAX Trophy, defeating Henry Akdeniz in the quarter finals by decision but was unable to proceed due to an injury suffered during his victory. In 2008 Aussie won his first major honor (at A-Klass level) against Melvin van Leeuwarden picking up the I.R.O. Dutch title. He added another belt the following year, beating the seasoned Imro Main by technical knockout to add the U.M.C. Dutch title to his repertoire. With title wins making him noticed on the Dutch circuit, Aussie continued his progress beating good pros such as Amir Zeyada, Ali Gunyar and It\u2019s Showtime Reality winner Sem Braan. He then demolished in form Nieky Holzken in less than a minute to emerge as a major player on the It's Showtime circuit, earning himself a title shot for the organizations vacant 77MAX world title at the end of 2010. At the Fightclub presents: It's Showtime 2010 he faced the highly decorated Russian Artem Levin, who had recently beat Yodsaenklai Fairtex to win gold at the 2010 World Combat Games. The title fight was a fairly even affair, with Aussie well in it until the fourth round, when a toe from an Artem kick injured Aussie his eye, leaving him unable to continue. In March 2011 Aussie met two-time K-1 MAX and three time S-Cup world champion Andy Souwer, dropping down in weight to fight at 70 kg. Perhaps drained from the weight cut, he was not his normal explosive self and was outclassed by Souwer who took a unanimous points decision victory. He will fight Mike de Snoo in Beverwijk, Netherlands on October 21, 2012, but by injury Mike de Snoo was replaced by Douli Chen who only fought 2 fights in the A-Classe. Duoli Chen lost respectively against the experienced Moroccan Aussie with points. .Alright, here's 10 more fights to watch in October He lost to Marc de Bonte by KO from a knee in round one at Glory 6: Istanbul in Istanbul, Turkey on April 6, 2013.GLORY 6 Poster/Fighters Expected to ParticipateUpdated GLORY 6 Istanbul Fight Card For Saturday, April 6GLORY 6 Istanbul: Daniel Ghita vs. Gokhan Saki, Live Results His release from Glory was reported in February 2014, having gone 0-1 in the promotion.Kickboxing News: Badr Hari returns, Pat Barry update, Glory 14 title fight, and more ==Titles== Professional *2012 It's Showtime 73 kg MAX Champion *2009 U.M.C.
