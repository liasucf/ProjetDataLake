    "text": "Skynet (known in Europe as The Terminator: Skynet \u2212 stylized as SkyNET) is a computer game based on the Terminator media franchise. It was intended as an expansion pack for the predecessor The Terminator: Future Shock, but was adapted into a standalone product. The game was developed and published by Bethesda Softworks in 1996. It received mostly positive reviews, praising its advanced high-resolution graphics for the time, as well as the fact that Bethesda included a multiplayer mode in contrast of its predecessor. ==Gameplay== Skynet is played in the first-person perspective. Each of the eight levels in the game require the player to solve a number of objectives before continuing to the next level, while fighting enemy terminators with a wide variety of guns and grenades. Another obstacle in each level is the harsh terrain, as many areas contain too much radiation for the player character to remain alive. The terrain is navigated in three ways, 'on foot', in a jeep with a mounted cannon, or in an HK fighter (a modified terminator robot that flies). Before each mission, the player is briefed via a full motion video cutscene. Skynet features a deathmatch mode, which allows players to fight in a number of maps as either a human or a Terminator. Human players move quickly and silently, but are relatively fragile and can only carry lightweight weapons. Terminators, on the other hand, move slowly and make loud hydraulic noises when they walk, but are very resilient to damage and can carry heavy weapons. Players are able to change various options including time limits and the time of day. ==Development== Skynet is driven by Bethsoft's XnGine. While the majority of the game uses textured polygons to display structures and enemies, many of the items, weapons, and level decorations are still shown using older sprite technology. It was released on May 24, 1996. The game went gold on November 11, 1996. ==Reception== Next Generation gave Skynet five out of five stars. The reviewer said the game fixed the problems with the \"revolutionary\" The Terminator: Future Shock by enabling \"high resolution SVGA graphics\", adding a multiplayer mode with maps designed specifically for deathmatch, and including an involved storyline. He concluded, \"The sheer beauty of the game, combined with the incredible amount of flexibility of the engine, means Terminator: SkyNET could be the best first-person shooter of the new year.\" Scary Larry of GamePro found that the high resolution mode runs choppy even on high-end PCs, and had a more measured reaction to the game in general, concluding, \"Although not as intense as Final Doom or as attitude- filled as Duke Nukem [3D], SkyNET will keep you blasting into the wee hours of the next apocalypse.\" He was most pleased with the mission objectives which involve riding vehicles and the intuitive, easy-to-remember controls. ==References== ==External links== * *Skynet at IMDb Category:1996 video games Category:Bethesda Softworks games Category:Cyberpunk video games Category:DOS games Category:DOS-only games Category:First-person shooters Category:Terminator (franchise) video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:XnGine games Category:Sprite based First-person shooters Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ",
