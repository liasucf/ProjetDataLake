    "text": "Security convergence refers to the convergence of two historically distinct security functions - physical security and information security - within enterprises; both are integral parts of any coherent risk management program. Security convergence is motivated by the recognition that corporate assets are increasingly information-based. Whereas in the past physical assets demanded the bulk of protection efforts, today information assets demand equal (if not far more) attention. Convergence is endorsed by the three leading international organizations for security professionals - ASIS International, ISACA and ISSA - which together co-founded the Alliance for Enterprise Security Risk Management to, in part, promote it. ==Bibliography== * Anderson, K., \"Convergence: A Holistic Approach to Risk Management\", Network Security, Elsevier, Ltd., Volume 2007, Issue 5, May 2007. * Anderson, K., \"IT Security Professionals Must Evolve for Changing Market\", SC Magazine, October 12, 2006. ==External links== * Alliance for Enterprise Security Risk Management Category:Security Category:Data security ",
