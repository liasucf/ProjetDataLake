Development and Validation of the Somatic Symptom Disorder\u2013B Criteria Scale (SSD-12). Psychosomatic Medicine. 2016;78:5-12. is a brief self-report questionnaire used to assess the B criteria of DSM-5 somatic symptom disorder American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). 5th ed. Arlington, VA: Amer-ican Psychiatric Association; 2013 , i.e. the patients\u2019 perceptions of their symptom-related thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. == The questionnaire == The SSD-12 is composed of 12 items. Each of the three psychological sub-criteria of DSM-5 somatic symptom disorder (cognitive, affective, behavioral) is measured by four items with all item scores ranging between 0 and 4 (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = very often). The order of the 12 items alternates between the three subcriteria (Subcriteria 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3\u2026etc). Ratings are summed up to make a simple sum score (which can vary between 0 and 48 points). == Development == The SSD-12 is a further development of the Somatic Symptoms Experiences Questionnaire.

Journal of Psychosomatic Research. 2015;78:553\u2013562. The 12 items of the SSD-12 were derived from a large initial item pool of 98 items via a mixture of qualitative (focus groups involving researchers and clinicians) and quantitative methods (psychometric analysis) . == Psychometric properties == Psychometric properties of the SSD-12 were examined in three different samples from Germany (psychosomatic outpatient clinic, n = 698 ; general population, n =2362 Toussaint A, L\u00f6we B, Br\u00e4hler E, Jordan P.

Validity of the Somatic Symptom Disorder - B Criteria Scale (SSD-12) in Primary Care. BMC Family Practice. 2018;35:342-347). === Reliability === Internal consistency (Cronbach\u00b4s alpha) of the scale is demonstrated by Cronbach\u00b4s between \u03b1 = .92 and \u03b1 = .95. . === Validity === ==== Content validity ==== The content validity is supposed to be high because the items are based on the DSM-5 criteria of somatic symptom disorder. ==== Construct validity ==== The SSD-12 showed positive associations with somatic symptom burden, health anxiety, depression, and anxiety. Moreover, high SSD-12 scores were associated with poor self-reported general well-being and frequent health care use. ==== Factorial Validity ==== The SSD-12 consists of a three-factorial structure which reflects the three psychological criteria interpreted as cognitive, affective and behavioural aspects of the DSM-5 B criteria of somatic symptom disorder. ==== Objectivity ==== The instrument is straightforward to complete, has an easy scoring algorithm (addition of the responses), and is simple to interpret. There are gender and age specific norm values from the general population and cut-off values from a clinical sample . Given this, the objectivity of the instrument is supposed to be high. ==== Sensitivity to change ==== In a German inpatient sample from a psychosomatic rehabilitation setting, H\u00fcsing et al. 2018 H\u00fcsing P, Bassler M, L\u00f6we B, Koch S, Toussaint A. Validity and sensitivity to change of the Somatic Symptom Disorder-B Criteria Scale (SSD-12) in a clinical population. General Hospital Psychiatry. 2018;55:20-26. showed that the SSD-12 is sensitive to change. A decrease of 3 points reflected a minimal clinically important difference. == Interpretation and normative data == The provided norms enable researchers and clinicians to compare SSD-12 scores with reference values of a general population sample.
