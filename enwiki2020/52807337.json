Radiometric dates of this complex include 8.3, 7.2, 4.8 and 3.4 million years ago. The volcano is constructed by dacite and pyroxene or hornblende andesite. These form lava flows or pyroclastic flows which were exposed by a large explosive event in the western flank. The slopes are also covered with a large amount of lava flows, including a broad dacite lava flow on the eastern flank. == References == === External links === * Category:Volcanoes of Chile Category:Miocene volcanoes Category:Volcanoes of Bolivia ",
