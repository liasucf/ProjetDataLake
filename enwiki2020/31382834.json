A young family look at the crosses planted in the ANZAC Field of Remembrance, Sydney, April 2009 == History == The first Field of Remembrance in Sydney was held in 1952. It was an idea that originated from the late Mrs C J Pope, widow of Rear Admiral Pope, after she had visited London and been impressed by the Field of Remembrance held each year in an old churchyard near Westminster Abbey. In 1972 the Attorney-General granted the War Widows\u2019 Guild of Australia NSW Ltd permission to use the word 'ANZAC' in the title, and the Field has been known since then as the ANZAC Field of Remembrance and continues to the present day.Burge, Roslyn (2008), No Peacetime Cinderellas: A History of the War Widows\u2019 Guild of Australia in New South Wales 1946\u20132006, Australia: War Widows\u2019 Guild of Australia NSW Ltd, (hbk.) p. 70 == The Ceremony == A non-denominational service is held prior to Anzac Day at St Andrew\u2019s Cathedral, Sydney, with a lesson read by the Governor of New South Wales.War Widows Guild of Australia NSW Website The service is followed by the Dedication of the Field and the planting of the official crosses.
