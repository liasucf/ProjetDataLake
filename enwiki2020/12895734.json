The exception to this occurred during the 2005\u201306 season, when he totalled only 198 minutes in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n for Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona to help them promote to La Liga. Nano returned to the second level in the 2009\u201310 campaign, being relatively played by C\u00e1diz CF but suffering team relegation. He scored his first goal as a professional on 4 October 2009, in a 1\u20130 away win against Albacete Balompi\u00e9. After two years back in division three, with Real Oviedo, Nano returned to the second tier by signing with SD Ponferradina. He only missed one game in 42 in his first and only season, adding two goals to help the club avoid relegation one year after promoting. ===Panathinaikos=== In the 2013 summer, after refusing to show up for training, Nano joined Panathinaikos F.C. from Greece. He made his debut in top flight football on 18 August of that year, featuring the full 90 minutes in a 2\u20130 home success over Panetolikos F.C. for the Superleague and converting a three-minute penalty kick in the process. On 8 December 2014, Nano extended his contract to Pana until 2017. During his spell in Athens, he was successively reconverted into a left back. ===Return to Spain=== On 25 August 2016, Nano signed a two-year contract with Spanish second division club UD Almer\u00eda. ==Honours== Cartagena *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B: 2008\u201309 Panathinaikos *Greek Football Cup: 2013\u201314 Individual *Superleague Team of the Year: 2013\u201314 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from M\u00e1laga Category:Spanish footballers Category:Andalusian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Association football midfielders Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:UD Fuengirola Los Boliches players Category:Marbella FC players Category:Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona footballers Category:FC Barcelona B players Category:C\u00f3rdoba CF players Category:UE Lleida players Category:FC Cartagena footballers Category:C\u00e1diz CF players Category:Real Oviedo players Category:SD Ponferradina players Category:UD Almer\u00eda players Category:Recreativo de Huelva players Category:Super League Greece players Category:Panathinaikos F.C. players Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Greece ",
