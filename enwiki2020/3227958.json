    "text": "The Foreign Affairs Select Committee is one of many select committees of the British House of Commons, which scrutinises the work of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. ==Inquiries== The Foreign Affairs Committee carries out many inquiries, and publishes a variety of reports, including an annual Human Rights Report. During its inquiry into the government's decision to invade Iraq, Dr. David Kelly famously gave evidence to the committee on 15 July 2003, two days before his death. In 2015 through 2016 the committee conducted an extensive and highly critical inquiry into the British involvement in the Libyan Civil War. It concluded that the early threat to civilians had been overstated and that the significant Islamist element in the rebel forces had not been recognised, due to an intelligence failure. By summer 2011 the initial limited intervention to protect Libyan civilians had become a policy of regime change. However that new policy did not include proper support and for a new government, leading to a political and economic collapse in Libya and the growth of ISIL in North Africa. The report concluded that the former Prime Minister David Cameron was ultimately responsible for this British policy failure. ==Membership== As of May 2020, the Committee's current members are as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | Member ! valign=\"top\" | Party ! valign=\"top\" | Constituency |- | bgcolor=\"\" | | Tom Tugendhat MP (Chairman) | Conservative | Tonbridge and Malling |- | bgcolor=\"\" | | Chris Bryant MP | Labour | Rhondda |- | bgcolor=\"\" | | Neil Coyle MP | Labour | Bermondsey and Old Southwark |- | bgcolor=\"\" | | Alicia Kearns MP | Conservative | Rutland and Melton |- | bgcolor=\"\" | |Stewart M.
