    "text": "Max Planck Institutes are research institutions operated by the Max Planck Society. There are 86 institutes as of January 2019. Most of them are located in Germany, although there are other locations in other European countries and the United States. Institutes are organized into three sections according to their research area: * Biology & Medicine * Chemistry, Physics & Technology * Human Science One institute can belong to several research areas. In addition, it can also belong to several more specialized research fields. == Institutes and Research Units == As of March 2015, the following Max Planck Institutes and Research Units exist (in
