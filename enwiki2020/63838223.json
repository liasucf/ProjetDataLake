In 1921, her port of registry was changed from Hiroshima to Shimonoseki; and in 1930, to Tobata. She worked as a fishing vessel until 15 September 1940 when she was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy. Her conversion to an auxiliary minesweeper was started on 25 September 1940 at the Mako Naval Base and completed on 15 November 1940. She was assigned to the Sasebo Guard Force until 1 September 1941 when she was assigned to the Southern Expeditionary Fleet organized to invade and occupy French Indochina with Reserve Lieutenant Nagahashi Kimata (\u9577\u6a4b\u559c\u9593\u592a) as her commanding officer. She spent most of her time on patrol, conducting anti- submarine and escort duty between the ports of Sai Kung, Hong Kong, and Cam Ranh Bay. On 12 January 1945, off Cam Ranh Bay in the South China Sea (), she was attacked and sunk by aircraft from Vice Admiral John S. McCain, Sr.'s Task Force 38 that had entered the South China Sea to raid Japanese shipping. Otowa Maru was struck from the Navy List on 3 May 1947. ==References== Category:1920 ships Category:Ships built in Japan Category:Maritime incidents in January 1945 Category:World War II minesweepers of Japan Category:Mine warfare vessels of the Imperial Japanese Navy Category:Auxiliary ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy ",
