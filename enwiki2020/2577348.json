His parents were both from Mexico. He attended Rosemead High School (class of 1993), and was educated at Richard Garvey Intermediate School. He has Shoshone Aboriginal heritage from his grandmother. ==1995\u2013present: The Black Eyed Peas== The Black Eyed Peas date back to 1988, when eighth-graders William Adams (will.i.am) and Allan Pineda (apl.de.ap) met and began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) in 1992, catching the attention of Eazy-E manager, Jerry Heller's nephew. Along with another friend of theirs, Dante Santiago, they called their band Atban Klann (ATBAN: A Tribe Beyond a Nation). Will 1X (aka will.i.am), apl.de.ap, Mookie Mook, DJ Motiv8 (aka Monroe Walker) and Dante Santiago formed Atban Klann. Their debut album, Grass Roots, was never released because Ruthless founder Eazy-E had died. The Black Eyed Peas signing autographs before a concert at East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania in 2004. After Eazy-E died in 1995, Atban Klann reformed and changed their name to Black Eyed Pods, and then Black Eyed Peas. Dante Santiago was replaced with Jaime Gomez (Taboo), and Kim Hill became a steady background singer. Unlike many hip hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the gangsta rap sounds of Los Angeles-based hip hop acts at the time. Taboo is known primarily for his guttural spoken reprises of the last few words of a sung lyric, as well as emphatic flourishes between vocal parts. After being signed to Interscope Records and releasing their debut, Behind the Front (1998) the group (and their accompanying live band) earned critical acclaim. One of the singles from the album was \"Joints & Jam\", and was featured on the Bulworth soundtrack.

In 2003, Fergie became the fourth member of the group and the group gained international fame, having won six Grammy Awards and sold an estimated 60 million records worldwide. They released their third album Elephunk, with the hit singles \"Where Is the Love?\" and \"Shut Up\". Their 2005 album Monkey Business was a worldwide success, being certified 4\u00d7 Platinum in the US, and spawning the singles, \"My Humps\" and \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\". In 2009, the group became one of only 12 artists to have simultaneously held the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, with their singles \"Boom Boom Pow\" and \"I Gotta Feeling\", with the next single \"Meet Me Halfway\" achieving similar success, from the album The E.N.D. These three singles topped the chart for an unprecedented 30 consecutive weeks in 2009. The album later produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with \"Imma Be\", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album before being followed with \"Rock That Body\" which managed to peak in the Top 10 of Hot 100. \"I Gotta Feeling\" became the first single to sell more than 1 million downloads in the United Kingdom.
