    "text": "The DHR D Class was a gauge Garratt-type articulated steam locomotive used on the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR) in West Bengal, India. ==Service history== The sole member of the class was built by Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1910, and entered service the following year, as no. 31 in the DHR fleet. Its basic dimensions were designed to be roughly equivalent to those of two of the DHR's existing B Class engines, with the intention that it would produce approximately double the power of those engines. However, in practice it was only able to haul 65% more load than a single B Class unit. Although the DHR did not acquire any further articulated locomotives, no. 31 remained in service until November 1954. ==See also== *History of rail transport in India *Indian Railways *Locomotives of India *Rail transport in India ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * ==External links== Category:Beyer, Peacock locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1911 Category:Steam locomotives of India Category:0-4-0+0-4-0 locomotives Category:2 ft gauge locomotives Category:Scrapped locomotives Category:Garratt locomotives ",
