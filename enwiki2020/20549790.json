    "text": "{| |} USS LCI(L)-93 was an amphibious assault ship (Landing Craft Infantry - Large), commissioned in 1943 by the United States Coast Guard. It participated in the Operation Husky Landings in Sicily on 10 July 1943, as well as the landings at Salerno, Italy. ==Normandy Invasion== As part of the massive amphibious force created for The Normandy Invasion, LCI(L)-93 took part in the landings at Omaha Beach on D-Day, 6 June 1944. After offloading its second cargo of American troops, the vessel became stranded between the shore and a sandbar. German Artillery then opened fire on the vulnerable ship, seriously wounding several soldiers and Coast Guardsmen. Among those injured were Stewards Mate 2/c John Roberts, an African American crewman, who lost his leg when an enemy shell passed through a bulkhead. Badly damaged, LCI(L)-93 was lost as a result of this action. ==In Art and Television== In addition to several photographs taken of LCI(L)-93 after the battle, several paintings of Omaha Beach depict the ship under fire on D-Day. The story of LCI(L)-93 was also told in The History Channel documentary A Distant Shore: African Americans of D-Day, with veteran John Roberts recounting his story of the ship's action at Normandy. ==References== ==External links== * http://www.uscg.mil/History/WEBCUTTERS/LCI_93.pdf * http://www.navsource.org/archives/10/15/150093.htm Category:1943 ships Category:LCI(L)-351-class large infantry landing craft Category:World War II amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:Ships built in Orange, Texas Category:Operation Overlord Category:Maritime incidents in June 1944 Category:Shipwrecks of France Category:Ships sunk by coastal artillery ",
