The season began on November 29, 2019 and was scheduled to end with the NLL final in late spring of 2020. However due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the season was suspended on March 12, 2020. On April 8, the league made a further public statement announcing the cancellation of the remaining games of the 2020 season and that they would be exploring options for playoffs once it was safe to resume play. This season was the inaugural season for the expansion Knighthawks and Riptide. The former Rochester Knighthawks under owner Curt Styres relocated to Halifax for this season while Pegula Sports and Entertainment took over the Knighthawks moniker with a new expansion team. ==Regular season== ==Awards== ===Annual awards=== References: Winners {| class=\"wikitable\" !Award !Winner !Other Finalists |- | Most Valuable Player | Shayne Jackson, Georgia Swarm | Callum Crawford, New England Black Wolves Rob Hellyer, Toronto Rock |- | Goaltender of the Year | Doug Jamieson, New England Black Wolves | Zach Higgins, Philadelphia Wings Dillon Ward, Colorado Mammoth |- | Defensive Player of the Year | Graeme Hossack, Halifax Thunderbirds | Robert Hope, Colorado Mammoth Kyle Rubisch, Saskatchewan Rush |- | Transition Player of the Year | Challen Rogers, Toronto Rock | Zach Currier, Calgary Roughnecks Kiel Matisz, Philadelphia Wings |- | Rookie of the Year | Tyson Gibson, New York Riptide | Connor Fields, San Diego Seals Andrew Kew, New England Black Wolves |- | Sportsmanship Award | Lyle Thompson, Georgia Swarm | Kyle Buchanan, San Diego Seals Curtis Knight, Rochester Knighthawks |- | GM of the Year | Paul Day, Philadelphia Wings | Jamie Dawick, Toronto Rock Rich Lisk, New England Black Wolves |- | Les Bartley Award | Paul Day, Philadelphia Wings | Mike Accursi, Halifax Thunderbirds Glenn Clark, New England Black Wolves |- | Executive of the Year Award | John Catalano, Halifax Thunderbirds | Matt Hutchings, Colorado Mammoth Rich Lisk, New England Black Wolves |- | Teammate of the Year Award | Dan Dawson, Toronto Rock (tie) Mike Poulin, Georgia Swarm | John Ranagan, New England Black Wolves |- | Tom Borrelli Award | Craig Rybczynski | Jake Elliott Teddy Jenner |- |} ==Stadiums and locations== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !
