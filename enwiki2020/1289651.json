    "text": "The First Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, officially First Vice President of the Government of Spain, () is the second in command to the Prime Minister of Spain, assuming its duties when the Prime Minister is absent or incapable of exercising power. The person for the post is usually handpicked by the Prime Minister from the members of the Cabinet and appointed by the Monarch before whom it takes oath. When there are more than one Deputy Prime Minister, they are typically called First Deputy Prime Minister, Second Deputy Prime Minister, etc, though alternative names have also been used (i.e. Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs, Deputy Prime Minister for Territorial Policy, etc.). The Headquarters of the Deputy Prime Minister's Office is the Semillas Building, in La Moncloa Complex. ==History== The office of Deputy Prime Minister, like the premiership, dates back to the 19th century. A part of the doctrine considers that the creation of the office was in 1925, after the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera ended with the military government and establish a civil government. However, the historical evidences prove that between 1840 and 1841 the office already existed under the name of Vice President of the Council of Ministers, holding this position the future prime minister Joaqu\u00edn Mar\u00eda Ferrer. After Deputy Prime Minister Ferrer, the office was not used again or was collected by any Constitution or subsequent law until the 20th century. Assuming the objectives for which the Military Directorate was created were completed, Primo de Rivera transformed the Government of Spain into a civil government in 1925, reestablishing the Council of Ministers, the Presidency of the Council of Ministers and re- creating the Vice Presidency, whose objective was to replace to the president in cases of absence or illness. This vice-president, said article 3 of the Royal Decree, was appointed by the president from among the members of the Council of Ministers. The Vice Presidency was vested in the Under Secretary of the Interior, Severiano Mart\u00ednez Anido, who combined the position with that of Interior Minister. With the resignation of Primo de Rivera and the fall of the monarchy, the Second Republic was established in Spain, which did not foresee at any time the existence of this position, however, in December 1933, Prime Minister Lerroux appointed Diego Mart\u00ednez Barrio Vice President of the Council of Ministers, a position to which he resigned only three months later. At the same time as the Presidency, the Vice Presidency changed its name with the Law of January 30, 1938 to Vice Presidency of the Government and, with the formation of the first Franco government, this position was granted to general Francisco G\u00f3mez-Jordana Sousa. From 1938 to 1981 the position was occupied by military officials, with the exception of the vice presidents Torcuato Fern\u00e1ndez Miranda (1973-1973) and Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez (1974-1975). Since 1981, with a democracy markedly established in society, Prime Minister Calvo- Sotelo appointed a civilian as Deputy, definitively separating the military power from the executive power, a situation that remains today. == Responsibilities == The Deputy Prime Minister of Spain is responsible for:Royal Decree 199/2012, 23 January, for explaining the structure of the Ministry of the Presidency and changing the Royal Decree 1887/2011, 30 December, for establishing the structure of the ministerial departments * Advising the President of the Government (Prime Minister). * Attending the Cabinet, the Delegated Commissions of the Government and the General Commission of Secretaries of State and Undersecretaries. * Supporting the President of the Government, specially exercising the responsibilities in relation to preparing and tracking the Government Programme. * Interministerial Coordinating given by current laws, the Government or the President. * Attending the Government with its relationships with the General Courts. * Preparing, carrying out and tracking the legislative programme of the Government and specially its parliamentary processing. * Material supporting, economic, financial, personal and budgetary management and in general whatever responsibilities needed by the President and the Presidency of the Government's dependent bodies. * Being the Secretary at the Council of Ministers. == Recent Deputy Prime Ministers == === Living Deputy Prime Ministers === As of , there are ten living former Spanish Deputy Prime Ministers: Martin villa002.jpg|Rodolfo Mart\u00edn Villa In office: 1981\u20131982 Age: Alfonso Guerra.jpg|Alfonso Guerra In office: 1982\u20131991 Age: Narc\u00eds Serra i Serra - 001.jpg|Narc\u00eds Serra In office: 1991\u20131995 Age: Francisco \u00c1lvarez-Cascos (2010).jpg|Francisco \u00c1lvarez-Cascos In office: 1996\u20132000 Age: Mariano Rajoy in 2018.jpg|Mariano Rajoy In office: 2000\u20132003 Age: RODRIGO RATO RT-8 01.JPG|Rodrigo Rato In office: 2003\u20132004 Age: Mar\u00eda Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez de la Vega, Presidenta del Consejo de Estado 2018 (Cropped).jpg|Mar\u00eda Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez de la Vega In office: 2004\u20132010 Age: Elena Salgado, durante la rueda de prensa posterior al Consejo de Ministros (9 de octubre de 2011) (cropped).jpg|Elena Salgado In office: 2011 Age: (Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda) AACU8277 (42868458574) (cropped).png|Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda In office: 2011-2018 Age: The most recent Deputy Prime Minister to die was Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba (served 2010\u20132011) on 10 May 2019, aged 67. == See also == *Second Deputy Prime Minister of Spain *Third Deputy Prime Minister of Spain *Fourth Deputy Prime Minister of Spain ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Government of Spain * ",
