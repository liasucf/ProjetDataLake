As the \"inter- college prom event\", it aims to seek for the \"Ultimate Prom King and Queen\" among male and female students, respectively, of various higher learning institutions throughout the country. The first season aired on 1 December 2007 on 8TV as a one-off broadcast which aired the Grand Finale live from SEGi College, Kota Damansara at 11pm. The second season airs in late 2008 in a series. ==Format== The Ultimate Prom Nite kicks off its search by holding a road show in various colleges and universities around the country, focusing on the search for male and female students to be finalists in the running for the \"Ultimate Prom King\" and \"Ultimate Prom Queen\" title, respectively. Hopefuls sign up at the road show and they will be featured on 8TV's website for their peers to vote for them before being selected by representatives of the organisers. After that, the selected finalists will undergo a crash course in a \"grooming school\" before competing in the Grand Finale. In the Grand Finale, which is the only part of the competition being televised, each contestant is given a question different from each other, in the fashion of competitive pageant shows like Miss World and Miss Universe, as a test of their wisdom in responding to the context of their questions. Contestants stand to win a grand prize attached to the aforementioned coveted titles, leaving their fate to a panel of judges and popular vote. ==Season 1== For the d\u00e9but season of the Ultimate Prom Nite, auditions were held in 18 colleges and universities \u2014 three in Penang, two in Johor, one in Malacca, and the rest in the Klang Valley \u2014 throughout September and October 2007.
