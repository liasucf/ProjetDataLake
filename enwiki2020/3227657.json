    "text": "Jacques Lafleur (20 November 1932 \u2013 4 December 2010) was a French politician born in Noum\u00e9a, New Caledonia, France. Lafleur was a leader of one of the two anti-independence parties in New Caledonia, the RPCR (Rally for Caledonia in the Republic). He was a signatory to the Matignon Accords in 1988 and the Noum\u00e9a Accord in 1998. He was elected deputy on 16 June 2002, for the 12th session of the legislature (2002\u20132007), representing the 1st district in New Caledonia, but lost his hold on power as a result of the elections of 9 May 2004, which propelled a new party, named \"Future Together\" (Avenir Ensemble), into control of government in South Province. ==Conviction for slander== Lafleur, whose fortune stemmed partly from mining interests, reportedly slandered and intimidated Goldman Environmental Prize winner Bruno Van Peteghem over Van Peteghem's efforts to protect the ecology of New Caledonia.http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/National-Wildlife/News-and- Views/Archives/2002/Little-Scum-Takes-On-Big-Mining.aspx ==Offices held== * 1978\u20132007 : Deputy * 7 March 1983 \u2013 3 June 1997 : Noum\u00e9a Municipal Council Member (New Caledonia) * 28 November 1984 \u2013 29 September 1985 : New Caledonia Territorial Assembly Member * 24 April 1988 \u2013 11 June 1989 : President of the Council for the Southern Region of New Caledonia * 11 June 1989 \u2013 8 May 1999 : President of the Assembly for the Southern Region of New Caledonia * 1999-2004 : Pr\u00e9sident of the South Province ==References== Category:1932 births Category:2010 deaths Category:People from Noum\u00e9a Category:The Rally (New Caledonia) politicians Category:Union for a Popular Movement politicians Category:Deputies of the 12th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic ",
