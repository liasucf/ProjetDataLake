Born at Boughton Monchelsea, Remington made his debut in first-class cricket for England against Hampshire at Alfresford in June 1779. In August of that year he appeared for Kent against Surrey at Laleham Burway. In 1780, he appeared in two first-class matches for Sir Horatio Mann's personal XI against the Duke of Dorset's XI at Bishopsbourne. In that same year he appeared twice for England against Hampshire, before making six first-class appearances in 1881, including for East Kent against West Kent. His next first-class appearance came two years later in 1883 for East Kent against West Kent at Sevenoaks. Across thirteen first-class matches, Remington scored 323 runs, with a high score of 62. His brothers, Thomas and Michael, both played first-class cricket. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1753 births Category:Date of death unknown Category:People from the Borough of Maidstone Category:English cricketers Category:Non-international England cricketers Category:Kent cricketers Category:Sir H.
