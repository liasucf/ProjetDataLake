The park is under the control of the St. Joseph County Parks and Recreation Department. The name Bendix Woods originates from the Bendix Corporation which donated the land to the county for the creation of a park. The park's historical significance, however, dates to its establishment by the Studebaker Corporation, formerly of nearby South Bend, Indiana as the first model test facility for an American automobile company. Studebaker developed the of land in 1926 as the first-ever controlled automotive-testing grounds for its product lines, beating Packard, Studebaker's future business partner, by one year. Studebaker heavily promoted the grounds as a \"million-dollar outdoor testing laboratory\" in advertisements. The test track that ran through the grounds simulated a variety of terrains and road conditions. Studebaker landscaped the park by keeping natural features\u2014and planted a huge grove of trees which spell out \"STUDEBAKER\" when viewed from above.Living Landmark: The Giant Studebaker Tree Sign of South Bend, Indiana Following the collapse of Studebaker's U.S. production facilities in 1963, the land was acquired by Bendix Corporation which used the grounds for corporate purposes. In 1996 Bosch purchased the property; in 2015 Navistar acquired it from Bosch and renamed it \"Navistar Proving Grounds\".
