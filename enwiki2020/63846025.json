His parents died before he was six years old, and most of his boyhood was passed in an unruly manner. When he was seventeen he heard George Whitefield preach, but the good impression received was not lasting. Three years later he was \u2018convinced of sin\u2019, joined the Methodists, and began to preach. He met John Wesley at Birstall in 1761, and by his advice attended the conference in London that year, when he was appointed the first travelling preacher of the connexion in Wales. A graphic account of his experiences in Glamorganshire and Pembrokeshire, and afterwards in various parts of England, Ireland, and Scotland, is given in his \"Autobiography\". Like many other early Methodists, he had a full share of hardships and persecutions. He continued an itinerant minister until 1816, a period of fifty-five years. He was president of the conference in 1796 and 1809. On the former occasion Alexander Kilham, the founder of the \"methodist new connexion,\" was expelled from the society. James Everett, in his Wesleyan Takings (p. 345), says of Taylor: \"Large in stature, plain features; a useful preacher; natural temper short and peevish, but subdued by divine grace; with a few drawbacks, a fine specimen of the old school.\" He was a close student, and mastered the original languages of the Bible. He died on 16 Oct. 1816 at Birch House, near Bolton, Lancashire, the residence of his friend Roger Hollond. Two days previously he had preached at Bolton, and his death inspired James Montgomery to write his poem The Christian Soldier. While at Chester in 1767 he married the descendant of a French Protestant family, by whom he had several children. A portrait of Taylor appeared in the Arminian Magazine for April 1780, and another in Wesley and his Successors, 1891. == Works == In addition to many separate sermons and tracts, he wrote: * \u2018A New Concordance to the Holy Scriptures,\u2019 York, 1782. * \u2018Ten Sermons on the Millennium, and Five on what will Follow,\u2019 Hull, 1789. * \u2018The Hypocrite tried and cast out,\u2019 Liverpool, 1792. * \u2018A Defence of the Methodists who do not attend the National Church,\u2019 Liverpool, 1792. * \u2018History of the Waldenses and Albigenses,\u2019 Bolton, 1793. * \u2018An Answer to Paine's \u201cAge of Reason,\u201d\u2019 Manchester, 1796. * \u2018Sixteen Sermons on the Epistles to the Seven Churches,\u2019 Bristol, 1800. * \u2018The Reconciler, or an humble Attempt to sketch the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of Christ,\u2019 &c.;, Liverpool, 1806. == Notes and references == === Citations === === Sources === * * == Further reading == * \"Autobiography\" in Jackson's Lives of Early Methodist Preachers, 1866, vol. v. * Osborn's Wesleyan Bibliography, 1869 * Batty's History of Rothwell, 1877, p. 231 * Tyerman's Life of John Wesley, 1871, vol. iii. * Green's Wesley Bibliography, 1896, p. 215\\. == External links == Category:1738 births Category:1816 deaths Category:18th-century Methodist ministers Category:Arminian ministers Category:Arminian writers Category:English Methodist ministers Category:Methodist writers Category:Presidents of the Methodist Conference Category:Wesleyan Methodists ",
