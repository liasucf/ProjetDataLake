    "text": "The next Northern Ireland Assembly election is expected to elect 90 members to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It will be the seventh assembly election since the assembly was established in 1998. Eight parties had MLAs in the sixth assembly: the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), led by former First Minister Arlene Foster; Sinn F\u00e9in, led by Michelle O'Neill; the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), led by Robin Swann; the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), led by Colum Eastwood; Alliance, led by Naomi Long; the Greens, led by Steven Agnew; People Before Profit (PBP), who have a collective leadership; and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), led by Jim Allister. ==Background== In May 2013, Theresa Villiers, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, announced the next Assembly election would be postponed to May 2016, and would be held at fixed intervals of five years thereafter. Section 7 of the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 specifies that elections will be held on the first Thursday in May on the fifth calendar year following that in which its predecessor was elected, which would be 5 May 2022. However, there are several circumstances in which the Assembly can be dissolved before the date scheduled by virtue of section 31(1) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. After the 2017 assembly election, Sinn F\u00e9in stated that it would not return to a power-sharing arrangement with the Democratic Unionist Party without significant changes in the party's approach, including Foster not becoming First Minister until an investigation into the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal was complete. A deadline of 27 March was set for the parties to form an executive. The deadline passed and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire gave the political parties more time to reach a coalition agreement. Negotiations were paused over Easter. On 18 April 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May called for a general election to be held on the 8 June 2017. A new deadline to form an executive was set for 29 June. The Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority and sought a confidence and supply agreement with the DUP to remain in government. The DUP and the Conservatives reached an agreement on 26 June. The deadline to form an executive passed with no resolution. Brokenshire then extended the negotiation time. Brokenshire resigned as Northern Ireland secretary in January 2018 on medical grounds, and was succeeded by Karen Bradley. The European Parliament election in May 2019 saw the Alliance Party take the third MEP place from the Ulster Unionists. Julian Smith succeeded Bradley on 24 July 2019. The law required an election to be called in August 2019 if no resolution was found. None was found, but the UK government created a new deadline of 13 January 2020. DUP support for the Conservative government broke down with disagreements over the government's Brexit plans. The Conservative government sought a new election, held in December 2019, which they won with a large majority. In Northern Ireland, for the first time, traditional Irish nationalist parties won more seats than traditional unionist parties. Both the SDLP and Alliance returned to the House of Commons, while both the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in saw vote share declines of more than 5%. A DUP/Sinn Fein executive was re-established on 10 January 2020, forestalling an immediate new election. == Opinion polls == ===Graphical summary=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;line-height:14px;\" ! rowspan=\"2\"| Pollster ! rowspan=\"2\" |Client ! rowspan=\"2\"| Date(s) conducted ! data-sort-type=\"number\" rowspan=\"2\"| Sample size ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\"| DUP (U) ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\"| SF (N) ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\"| UUP (U) ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\"| SDLP (N) ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\"| Alliance (O) ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\"| TUV (U) ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\"| Green (O) ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\"| PBP (O) ! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\"| Con (U) ! rowspan=\"2\" |Other ! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Lead |- ! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\"| ! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\"| ! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\"| ! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\"| ! data- sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\"| ! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\"| ! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\"| ! data- sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\"| ! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\" | |- | LucidTalkBreen S (2020), \"61% of people think O'Neill's performance has been bad.\" Belfast Telegraph, 12 Oct 2020. https://www.pressreader.com/uk/belfast-telegraph/20201012/281603832936133 |Belfast Telegraph | data-sort-value=\"2020-10-05\"| 2\u20135 Oct 2020 | 1,961 | 23% |style=\"background:#D7ECEA\"|24% | 12% | 13% | 16% | 6% | 3% | 2% | \u2013 | 1% | style=\"background:;color:#FFFFFF;\"| 1% |- | style=\"border-right- style:hidden;\"| | style=\"border-right-style:hidden;\"| | style=\"border-right- style:hidden;\" data-sort-value=\"2020-01-31\"| 31 Jan 2020 | colspan=\"12\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | The United Kingdom leaves the European Union |- | style=\"border-right-style:hidden;\"| | style=\"border-right-style:hidden;\"| | style=\"border-right-style:hidden;\" data-sort-value=\"2020-01-11\"| 11 Jan 2020 | colspan=\"12\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Northern Ireland Executive re- established |- | style=\"border-right-style:hidden;\"| | style=\"border-right- style:hidden;\"| | style=\"border-right-style:hidden;\" data-sort- value=\"2019-12-12\"| 12 Dec 2019 | colspan=\"12\" |2019 United Kingdom general election |- | LucidTalk |Northern Slant | data-sort-value=\"2018-02-26\"| 23\u201326 Feb 2018 | 2,079 | style=\"background:#F3D6CE;\"| 33.6% | 32.4% | 10.3% | 8.6% | 8.0% | 2.3% | 1.9% | 1.7% | 0.2% |1.5% | style=\"background:;color:#FFFFFF;\"| 1.2% |- | LucidTalk |GUE/NGL | data-sort-value=\"2017-12-04\"| 1\u20134 Dec 2017 | 2,079 | style=\"background:#F3D6CE;\"| 33.7% | 32.8% | 8.9% | 8.6% | 7.9% | 1.1% | 2.2% | 1.1% | 0.2% |3.5% | style=\"background:;color:#FFFFFF;\"| 0.9% |- | LucidTalk |N/A | data-sort-value=\"2017-09-11\"| 8\u201311 Sep 2017 | 2,080 | style=\"background:#F3D6CE;\"| 35.5% | 31.2% | 9.6% | 9.4% | 8.6% | 1.3% | 1.7% | 1.5% | 0.2% |1.1% | style=\"background:;color:#FFFFFF;\"| 4.3% |- style=\"background:#E9E9E9;\" | colspan=\"2\" | 2017 Assembly election | data- sort-value=\"2017-03-02\"| 2 Mar 2017 | \u2013 | style=\"background:#F3D6CE;\"| 28.1% | 27.9% | 12.9% | 11.9% | 9.1% | 2.6% | 2.3% | 1.8% | 0.3% |3.3% | style=\"background:;color:#FFFFFF;\"| 0.2% |} ==See also== *Next Irish general election *Next United Kingdom general election ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:Elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly Northern Ireland Northern Ireland Category:2022 elections in the United Kingdom ",
