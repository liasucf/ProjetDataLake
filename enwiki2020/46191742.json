    "text": "The Serblias family () was a Byzantine family that were active between the 11th and 13th centuries, employed in civil service in the central and provincial government. A part of the family was related to the Spanopouloi in the 1090s. The etymology of the name derives from their origin, either Serbia (\u03a3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03b1), or the fortress town of Servia (). ==People== Members recorded in Byzantine Sigillography: *Peter, son of Serblias ( 1025\u201350). *Michael Serblias ( 1029), protospatharios of the Chrysotriklinos and krites of Thessaloniki; or krites of Boleron, Strymon and Thessaloniki. *Stephanos Serblias (1040/70), protospatharios and tax official (kommerkiarios) of Longibardia, possibly also mystographos. *Leon Serblias (1040/80), magistros.
