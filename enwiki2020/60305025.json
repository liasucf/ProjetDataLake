They have self released three EPs, and released five singles with Ultra, with a debut full-length album \"Carisma\" released on 8 May 2020.

They appeared at South by Southwest in 2018, and afterward released a video for the song \"No Love\". Salt Cathedral has released three EPs, and eight singles, including their most recent single \"Go And Get It.\" They have over thirty million streams on Spotify (including nearly 12 million for their single \"Always There When I Need You\") and their music has also been featured in publications such as The Guardian, Pitchfork, FADER, VICE, Billboard, Wonderland Magazine, Consequence of Sound, iHeartRadio, Jezebel, and The Village Voice, as well as Fusion TV.
