Cook, who worked as a printer's devil in his father's print shop and as a volunteer in Sunday schools around Chicago, adjudged that most available Sunday school literature \"suffered from either loose theology or poor design.\" With his wife, Marguerite, he established a newspaper, Our Sunday School Gem, to meet the need for good Sunday school literature before starting his eponymous publishing company. As the twentieth century began, the company moved to larger facilities in suburban Elgin. By the 1920s, the company produced more than 50 titles and had an annual circulation of two million. The company moved its headquarters from Elgin to Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1995. It did business under the name \"Cook Communications Ministries\" before reverting to \"David C Cook\" in 2007. === Acquisitions === David C Cook acquired Kingsway in 1993, Scripture Press/Victor Books in 1996, and Integrity Music in 2011.David C Cook Acquires Integrity Music .
