From 2017 to 2019, four pre-season tournaments (The Terrific 8 and later The Terrific 12) were organized by EASL, featuring clubs from select professional basketball leagues in East Asia. With official backing from FIBA Asia, EASL will transition toward a full-fledged basketball club competition. The first season of this new EASL will be held in 2021-22 and will feature eight teams. EASL matches will be integrated into the schedules of participating professional leagues. ==History== Some years before the inception of the Asia League, Asia League CEO Matt Beyer conceptualized the idea of creating a league in East and Southeast Asia given the lack of high-level international tournaments featuring basketball clubs in the region. while simultaneously elevating the level of basketball in Asia as a whole. He also taken into account the population in the region, about 2 billion, which he views as the potential market for a regional inter-club tournament. The Asia League is envisioned to be East Asian counterpart of the NBA's Las Vegas Summer League where professional teams from Asia could compete against each other with minimal conflict with their mother league's schedules. There stated mission is to be able to organized basketball tournaments featuring club sides from top Asian leagues with the organizers naming the CBA (China), B.League (Japan), KBL (South Korea), PBA (Philippines), SBL (Chinese Taipei), and ABL. ===The Super 8=== The first tournament by EASL, then called the Asia League, was the Super 8: Macau Basketball Invitational, comprised of eight teams in September 2017 at the Studio City Event Centre in Macau. The competing teams in attendance were the Zhejiang Guangsha Lions, Shenzhen Aviators (formerly Shenzhen Leopards), Goyang Orions, Seoul Samsung Thunders, Fubon Braves, Pauian Archiland, Chiba Jets and Ryukyu Golden Kings. Organizers initially dubbed the tournament as the \"Asia League,\" but this led to a legal dispute with FIBA over the name of the league when FIBA deemed the tournament's branding and marketing to be in conflict with its own FIBA Asia Champions Cup. The dispute led to the renaming of the competition to \"Super 8,\" and the tournament was then officially recognized by FIBA after the league organizers sought legal assistance of Quinn Emanuel's Thomas Werlen, who has represented FIFA in investigations of the U.S. Department of Justice. The inaugural Super 8 tournament was won by the Chiba Jets of the Japanese B. League, with the Zhejiang Guangsha Lions placing second and the Goyang Orions taking third place. The event garnered 21 million views worldwide. A second edition of the tournament, dubbed the Summer Super 8, followed in July 2018 at the Macau East Asian Games Dome, and featured the introduction of two professional club teams from the PBA, the NLEX Road Warriors and Blackwater Elite. The eight competing teams in attendance were the Guangzhou Loong Lions, Xinjiang Flying Tigers, Seoul Samsung Thunders, Incheon Electroland Elephants, NLEX Road Warriors, Blackwater Elite, Rizing Zephyr Fukuoka and Formosa Dreamers. The Guangzhou Loong Lions won first place, while the Seoul Samsung Thunders took second place and the Incheon Electroland Elephants placed third. ===The Terrific 12=== Logo of The Terrific 12 tournament. In 2018, the Super 8 tournament was expanded into a larger tournament format called The Terrific 12, featuring 12 teams instead of eight. The Terrific 12 (2018) tournament was organized in collaboration with and supported by the Sports Bureau of Macau SAR government and hosted at the Studio City Event Centre. The competing teams were the Shandong Heroes (formerly Shandong Golden Stars), Zhejiang Guangsha Lions, Xinjiang Flying Tigers, Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus, Seoul Samsung Thunders, Fubon Braves, Yulon Luxgen Dinos, Nagoya Diamond Dolphins, Ryukyu Golden Kings and Chiba Jets.

Terrific 12 (2019) also featured the EASL debut of former NBA player and CBA import Lance Stephenson, who earned MVP awards for his 34-point outburst in the Terrific 12 (2019) championship finals, a close 83-82 finish for the Liaoning Flying Leopards over the Seoul SK Knights. The Zhejiang Guangsha Lions won second place and the San Miguel Beermen took home third in the event. Plans for a 2020 iteration of The Terrific 12 tournament on September have been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ===2021 league plans=== In October 2021, with the full support of FIBA Asia, EASL organizers plan to hold a full-fledged in- season league featuring clubs from greater China, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. The inaugural season will feature 8 teams. The teams will play home-and-away games against each other with the top four teams advancing to a Final Four event.http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-07/07/c_139194001.htm It marks the first integrated club-to-club championship league for the East Asia region. The Group Stage divides the eight competing teams into two brackets for a round-robin stage, which will take place from October 2021 through January 2022. Each team will play six games during this stage: one game at home and one game away against the other teams in their respective brackets. The Final Four Stage will feature the winners and runners-up from each bracket that will then play in the Final Four, which is scheduled for February 2022, to crown an overall champion, a second-place team and a third- place finisher. To qualify for the 2021-22 EASL season, teams must finish in the top one or two final playoff standings for the previous season in their respective domestic leagues (greater China, Japan, Korea and the Philippines). The region's top eight teams will again qualify for the 2022\u201323 season. ==Tournament champions== ===Super 8 (2017\u20142018)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:80px;\"|Season !colspan=5 |Finalists !colspan=5 |Semifinalists |- !width=70px|Country ! style=\"width:220px;\"|Champions !width=60px|Result !width=70px|Country ! style=\"width:220px;\"|Runners-up !width=70px|Country ! style=\"width:220px;\"|Semifinalist !width=60px|Result !width=70px|Country ! style=\"width:220px;\"|Semifinalist |- |2017 | | Chiba Jets |align=center|83\u201373 | | Zhejiang Guangsha Lions | | Goyang Orions |align=center|88\u201371 | | Ryukyu Golden Kings |- |2018 | | Guangzhou Long-Lions |align=center|78\u201372 | | Seoul Samsung Thunders | | Incheon Electroland Elephants |align=center|67\u201362 | | NLEX Road Warriors |} ===The Terrific 12 (2018\u20142019)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:80px;\"|Season !colspan=5 |Finalists !colspan=5 |Semifinalists |- !width=70px|Country ! style=\"width:220px;\"|Champions !width=60px|Result !width=70px|Country ! style=\"width:220px;\"|Runners-up !width=70px|Country ! style=\"width:220px;\"|Semifinalist !width=60px|Result !width=70px|Country ! style=\"width:220px;\"|Semifinalist |- |2018 | | Ryukyu Golden Kings |align=center|85\u201376 | | Guangzhou Long-Lions | | Seoul Samsung Thunders |align=center|105\u201392 | | Nagoya Diamond Dolphins |- |2019 | | Liaoning Flying Leopards |align=center|83\u201382 | | Seoul SK Knights | | Zhejiang Lions |align=center|91\u201389 | | San Miguel Beermen |- |2020 |colspan=10 align=center|Canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic |} ===East Asia Super League (2021\u2014present)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:80px;\"|Season !Final Four hosts !colspan=4 |Finalists !colspan=4 |Semifinalists |- !width=70px|Country ! style=\"width:220px;\"|Champions !width=70px|Country ! style=\"width:220px;\"|Runners-up !width=70px|Country ! style=\"width:220px;\"|Semifinalist !width=70px|Country ! style=\"width:220px;\"|Semifinalist |- |2021\u201422 | TBA |colspan=8 align=center|To be determined |} ==See also== *EuroLeague *FIBA Asia Champions Cup *ASEAN Basketball League *William Jones Cup ==References== Category:Multi-national basketball leagues in Asia Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2017 Category:Sports organisations of Hong Kong Category:Basketball in Macau Category:Professional sports leagues in China Category:Multi-national professional sports leagues ",
