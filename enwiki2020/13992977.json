The story begins with a man and woman visiting a section of the Silver River referred to as 'the Bend', apparently with the intention of engaging in a romantic tryst. The next day, the woman's decapitated body is discovered by a young couple, Bass and his girlfriend Faye. Sheriff Rusty Hodges and his daughter-in-law, Deputy Mary \"Pac\" Hodges, are called in to investigate. The pursuit of the killer leads to a complicated series of events involving Merton (a homosexual drug dealer who was seen running from the scene of the crime), the dead woman's husband, and a revenge scheme involving two of the main characters. ==Adult themes== Like many of Laymon's other works, the book features strong adult content. Themes of sex and rape are present. Category:1999 American novels Category:Novels by Richard Laymon Category:Novels set in California Category:Sierra County, California Category:Novels about rape ",
