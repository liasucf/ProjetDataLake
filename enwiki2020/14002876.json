    "text": "Pan de Pascua is a Chilean cake traditionally eaten around Christmas time. Although \"Pascua\" primarily means Passover and secondarily means Easter, it also may mean Christmas and Epiphany.Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola, Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola, pascua. In Chile both Navidad and Pascua are used to refer to Christmas. Despite its name, it is a cake made from batter, and not a true bread. It is similar to a sweet sponge cake flavored with ginger and honey. It usually contains candied fruits, raisins, walnuts and almonds. Pan de Pascua was originally introduced to Chile by German immigrants. The Chilean version combines characteristics of the German Stollen and the Italian Pandoro. == References == Category:Chilean cuisine Category:Christmas food Category:Yeast breads Category:Sweet breads ",
