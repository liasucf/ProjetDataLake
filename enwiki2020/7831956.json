According to Dr. Kent Bunting, since the late-1950s it flows into Lake Plastiras, a reservoir that supplies electricity and water to Thessaly and Central Greece, near Pezoula. Passing into Evrytania, it flows through a deep, forested valley with a few little villages and stone bridges. Since 1967, it empties into the Kremasta Reservoir, which is drained by the Acheloos.
