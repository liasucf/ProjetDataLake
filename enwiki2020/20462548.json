    "text": "The title page of the autograph score of the Miniatures for two violins and viola, later rearranged as the Romantic Pieces for violin and piano Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed his cycle of four Romantic Pieces, Op. 75, B. 150, (), for violin and piano in January 1887. These four pieces are arranged from his previous composition, a trio for two violins and viola, known as Miniatures, Op. 75a, B. 149 (). == Background == The composer's family was living in that time in Prague 2, at 564 \u017ditn\u00e1 Street, in the same house as Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's mother- in-law. She hired out a room to a young chemistry student, Josef Kruis. Kruis was also an amateur violinist who studied the violin with Jan Pelik\u00e1n, a member of the orchestra of the National Theatre in Prague. They often played violin duets together. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, a viola player, heard them and got the idea to compose a new chamber work for two violins and viola in order to play with them. The resulting composition was the Terzetto in C major, Op. 74, B. 148, composed from 7 to 14 January 1887. It was, however, too difficult for Kruis, and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k therefore composed another trio, but considerably simpler. The second trio, Miniatures, was written in four movements, which he titled: \"Cavatina\", \"Capriccio\", \"Romance\" and \"Elegy\" (\"Ballad\"). In the letter dated 18 January 1887 to his German publisher Simrock, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k stated: \"I am writing little miniatures \u2013 just imagine \u2013 for two violins and viola, and I enjoy the work as much as if I were writing a large symphony \u2013 what do you say to that? Of course, they are meant rather for amateurs, but didn't Beethoven and Schumann also express themselves sometimes with quite simple means \u2013 and how?...\" Though he was apparently satisfied with this version of the trio, he nevertheless immediately began to rearrange it for violin and piano. He called the new version Romantic Pieces, Op. 75. The only date appears at the end of the manuscript \u2013 25 January 1887. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k later completely forgot about the existence of the trio, and years later in 1901 explained to Simrock that \"...what is supposed to be a trio...cannot be the Romantic Pieces\". Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's original manuscript of the trio version (and Kruis' copy of individual parts) was only rediscovered in 1938, and it was proven that he himself was mistaken. The first performance of the Romantic Pieces took place on 30 March 1887 at the chamber concert at the Um\u011bleck\u00e1 Beseda in Prague. The violin part was played by Karel Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek, at that time leader of the orchestra of the National Theatre (he was a younger brother of the violinist Franti\u0161ek Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek), with Dvo\u0159\u00e1k at the piano. The trio version was premiered by members of the Prague Quartet on 24 February 1938 at a concert of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's chamber music at the Prague City Library. The individual parts were played by Vilibald Schwejda, Herbert Berger and Ladislav \u010cern\u00fd. The Romantic Pieces were published in 1887 by the Berlin publishing house of Simrock, the Miniatures in 1945 by Hudebn\u00ed Matice Um\u011bleck\u00e9 Besedy. == Structure == ===Miniatures, trio for two violins and viola=== Originally the set was untitled, but Dvo\u0159\u00e1k called it Miniatures in the aforementioned letter to Simrock. Kruis added the titles to the individual movements, apparently in agreement with the composer. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k completed the cycle of four unrelated short pieces with different themes, with apparent influence of Robert Schumann. A performance of the four pieces would take approximately 14 minutes. The first movement opens in the calm mood of the first violin; only in the middle part is the expression more passionate. The movement is accompanied with a rhythmical ostinato in the second violin and with a \"bass\" accompaniment in the viola. The second movement is written in an optimistic mood, with simple harmonic variations. It also contains some reminiscences of folk music, particularly at the end. The shape and mood of the third movement is rather dreamy. The melodic line of the first violin is accompanied by triplets in the second violin. The last movement is the most complicated; its elegiac mood develops from its short opening passage. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k probably intended to create another movement, but it was unfinished, only eight bars are preserved. The whole composition ends with a slow movement, which is rather atypical. ===Romantic pieces for violin and piano=== Dvo\u0159\u00e1k left the musical content of the arrangement for violin and piano almost unchanged; he only slightly altered the harmonic foundations in the first movement (bars 30\u201336), and extended the end of the third movement with an additional four bars. He also renamed the second and third movements. == Media == ==See also== *Civilization V, a video game excerpting the fourth movement of Romantic Pieces (Larghetto), in its soundtrack. ==References== ==External links== *Info on a comprehensive Dvorak site Category:Chamber music by Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Category:1887 compositions ",
