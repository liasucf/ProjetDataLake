She is the author and illustrator of many children's picture books, including the popular Dorrie the Little Witch series. \u201cOf her childhood, she says, \u2018I was forever being told to get my nose out of a book and go outside. As a result I ended up reading in odd places where I wouldn\u2019t be noticed\u2014behind my brother\u2019s mice cages, under lilac bushes. The smells of mice and lilacs to this day evoke certain stories.\u2019\u201d Coombs, Patricia. Dorrie and the Pin Witch. New York: Lothrop, Lee & Shepard, 1989. She attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, and received her B.A. (1947) and M.A. (1950) in English literature from the University of Washington.
