    "text": "Greenock and Inverclyde was a burgh constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1997 until 2005, when it was replaced by the Inverclyde constituency. It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) using the first-past-the-post voting system. ==Boundaries== The Inverclyde District electoral divisions of Greenock Central East, Greenock South West, and Inverclyde West. The constituency included all of the council area of Inverclyde except the wards covering Port Glasgow and Kilmacolm, which were in the West Renfrewshire constituency. The unusual choice of name (since the town of Greenock is in Inverclyde) reflects the fact that the constituency was created from parts of two predecessor constituencies, Greenock and Port Glasgow and Renfrew West and Inverclyde. == Members of Parliament == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member!!Party |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 1997 | Norman Godman | Labour |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 2001 | David Cairns | Labour |- |colspan=\"2\" align=\"right\"|2005 |colspan=\"2\"| constituency abolished: see Inverclyde |} ==Election results== ===Elections of the 2000s=== ===Elections of the 1990s=== == References == * Category:Historic parliamentary constituencies in Scotland (Westminster) Category:United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies established in 1997 Category:United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies disestablished in 2005 Category:Politics of Inverclyde ",
