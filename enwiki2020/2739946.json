The team competes in the Professional Cricket League under the franchise name Barbados Pride. The most prominent Barbadian cricketers include George Challenor, Joel Garner, Gordon Greenidge, Wes Hall, Desmond Haynes, Conrad Hunte, Malcolm Marshall, Garry Sobers, Clyde Walcott, Everton Weekes and Frank Worrell. ==History== ===Colonial era=== George Challenor, a Barbadian, was regarded as the \"first of the great West Indian batsmen\".
