    "text": "A Court of Thorns and Roses is a new adult high fantasy novel series by American author Sarah J. Maas, beginning with the novel of the same name, released in May 2015. The story follows the journey of mortal Feyre (pronounced Fay-ruh) Archeron after she is brought into the faerie lands of Prythian as punishment for murdering a faerie. The series appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list, and has been optioned by Tempo Productions for a film adaptation. ==Overview== A Court of Thorns and Roses follows the story of Feyre Archeron, a 19-year-old huntress. After killing a faerie wolf in the woods, she is kidnapped and taken to the faerie land of Prythian by a beast- like creature that demands punishment for the kill. Feyre discovers that her kidnapper is not a beast, but another faerie named Tamlin, an immortal being that once ruled her world. As she lives with Tamlin at his estate, her feelings towards him develop from hate to love, and she comes to learn that everything she has learnt about the faerie world is a lie. ==Books== ===Main series=== ===Companion books=== * A Court of Thorns and Roses Coloring Book (2017) == Characters == * Feyre Archeron \u2013 the main protagonist and narrator, Tamlin's ex-lover and ex-fianc\u00e9.

These tales inspired the finished series, though it was not ultimately a dedicated retelling. She began writing A Court of Thorns and Roses in early 2009, with the first draft taking about five weeks to complete. A Court of Mist and Furys first draft was written entirely in a split point of view between Feyre and Rhys. The second books went through multiple name changes, including A Court of Wind and Stone, A Court of Calm and Fury, A Court of Stars and Smoke, A Court of Wings and Stars, A Court of Venom and Silver and A Court of Stars and Frost. Like the first novel, the second is based around multiple fairy tales and myths, including Hades and Persephone, where the Greek mythology inspired characters such as Rhysand and Feyre and their home in the Night Court. Other fairy tale inspirations include Hansel and Gretel, which inspired the character of the Weaver, and the Book of Exodus, which loosely inspired parts of the backstory for Miryam and Drakon. The final cover of A Court of Wings and Ruin was designed by Adrian Dadich, with the dress pictured on the cover originally designed by Charlie Bowater, and later adapted by Dadich. On July 12, 2016, Entertainment Weekly reported that Maas was writing five new books for the series, which would include two novellas and three further novels which would be set before and after the first trilogy. ==Awards== ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\" |- !
