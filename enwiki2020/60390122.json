This moment is depicted on the sketch of Valentin Serov The Count (from 1731) Pavel Ivanovich Yaguzhinsky (Yagushinsky) (1683, Grand Duchy of Lithuania \u2013 April 17, 1736, Saint Petersburg) was a Russian statesman and diplomat, associate of Peter the Great, Chamberlain (1712), Ober-Stallmeister (1727), General-in-chief (1727), the first Attorney General in Russian history (1722\u20131726, 1730\u20131735).Yaguzhinsky Pavel Ivanovich // Soviet historical encyclopedia. Moscow, Soviet Encyclopedia, 1973-1982. Edited by Yevgeny Zhukov. Volume 16. Pages 844-845 He was famous for his honesty and integrity, which Peter the Great appreciated in him in the first place. ==Origin== The son of the organist Yaguzhinsky, a native of Lithuania,Alexander Orlov, Natalia Georgieva, Vladimir Georgiev Historical Dictionary. 2nd edition. Moscow, 2012. Page 588 he probably originated from the town of Kublichi of the Po\u0142ock Voivodeship of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (now the Ushachy district, the Vitebsk Region, Belarus). In 1687, together with his father's family, he arrived in Russia. Thanks to his sharpness and sense of duty, he proved himself in the service of Fedor Golovin (as a page, then as a Page of the Chamber). In 1701 he was enlisted in the guard, in the Preobrazhensky Regiment, becoming the orderly of Tsar Peter the Great in place of Menshikov.\"According to the testimony of one of the people close to him, at that time, at night, Peter was twitching such convulsions all over his body, that he put one of the orderlies on the bed and could only fall asleep by holding his shoulders\". (Mikhail Semevsky. Tsaritsa Katerina Alekseevna. Moscow, 1994. Page 49). From the Lutheran faith he moved to the Orthodox. ==Diplomatic missions of Peter I== In 1710 \u2013 the captain of the Preobrazhensky Regiment. He married Anna Feodorovna Khitrovo and received a large dowry for her, which included, among other things, the village of Avchurino (manor) and the village of Sergeevskoye (now Plavsk). Even earlier (July 9, 1706), an island on the Yauza River near German Settlement was received from Peter I into eternal possession.Vasily Fursenko. Yagushinsky (Yaguzhinsky), Pavel Ivanovich // Russian Biographical Dictionary: in 25 volumes. \u2013 St. Petersburg \u2013 Moscow, 1896\u20131918. During the Northern War, Yaguzhinsky regularly performed Peter's diplomatic missions, and in 1713 traveled abroad with him.Peter's time in faces. Publishing House of the State Hermitage Museum, 2007. Page 60 In 1711 he participated in the Prut campaign. In the same year, he accompanied Peter to Carlsbad and Torgau to the wedding of Tsarevich Alexei. In June 1711 he received the rank of colonel, on August 3, 1711 \u2013 Adjutant general. On February 19, 1712, he became the second in Russian history (after Semyon Naryshkin) who was granted the rank of chamberlain. Yaguzhinsky is one of the few who attended the king's marriage to Marta Skavronskaya. In November 1713 he was sent to the Copenhagen court with the notice of the arrival of Peter the Great with the army in the duchy of Mecklenburg. In 1714, he again came to Denmark in order to, together with the resident Vasily Dolgorukov, urge the Danish crown to fulfill allied obligations. After the establishment of the collegiums in 1718, Yaguzhinsky was entrusted with the observation of the \"soonest possible establishment of colleges by their presidents\". A year later, he took part in the \u00c5land Congress, then in 1720\u201321 he represented the interests of Russia at the Viennese court of the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, where he found a troupe of comedians for the king. Yaguzhinsky left for the Nystad Congress on August 24, 1721, but at the request of his rival Osterman, the Vyborg commandant Ivan Shuvalov delayed him in Vyborg for two whole days, and when Pavel Yaguzhinsky arrived in Nystad, the peace was already concluded. ==Creation of assemblies and divorce with wife== As a young man, Yaguzhinsky had the reputation of \"a cheerful interlocutor, a jovial and tireless dancer\", as well as the king of all dances, who keenly followed the visits to the assemblies and compiled lists of the absent courtiers for the king. Not a single assembly, when Yaguzhinsky was in Russia, did not do without his presence, and if, having drunk, he would start dancing, he would dance till drop. Loving the fun, festive life, Yaguzhinsky led it on a grand scale, spending on furnishings, servants, trips, and other things. Peter the Great, needing luxurious carriages for ceremonial receptions, more than once temporarily took them from Yaguzhinsky. \"Having established the obligatory assemblies, Peter laid them under the supervision of Yaguzhinsky, and in this position he showed the same zeal, diligence and speed with which he carried out all the orders of his sovereign\". The marriage of Yaguzhinsky with a rich and well-born heiress, which took place with the live participation of Peter the Great, Anna Feodorovna Khitrovo (1701\u20131733), was unsuccessful. Yaguzhinsky, accompanying the emperor, was often on the road. His wife, separated from her children, lived mainly in Moscow, where she could not boast of exemplary behavior: In 1721, at the wedding of Yuri Trubetskoy, there was a public quarrel between Yaguzhinsky and his wife, according to the ceremony she had to dance with her husband, but refused. Bergholz, who saw her in 1722, wrote that she almost did not go anywhere and living in Saint Petersburg did not leave the house, as she was constantly ill and was suffering from \"melencolia\".Friedrich Wilhelm Berchholz. Diary 1721-1725 / Translation from German by Ivan Ammon. - Moscow, 1902 Soon, Anna Feodorovna was placed in one of the Moscow monasteries, and Yaguzhinsky, partly due to the insistence of Peter I, addressed the Synod with a request for divorce \"so that I would not continue in such a disastrous and otherwise life, but my poor little children would not have suffered from such an indecent mother\". Yaguzhinskaya justified her, saying that \"she did these indecent acts in her unconsciousness and melancholy, which happened in Petersburg in 1721, and in grief and sorrow from separation from her roommate and children, from boredom and loneliness\". It was one of the first divorce proceedings in Russia and, of course, it caused a lot of talk. Valishevsky argues that even before the beginning of the divorce, Yaguzhinsky had found a prominent bride \u2014 one of the daughters of the great Chancellor Golovkin named Anna. The permission to divorce was followed on August 21, 1723, and on November 10, Saint Petersburg was celebrating a magnificent wedding. According to Bassevich, Yaguzhinsky \"was just as pleased with his second wife as his emperor was pleased with emperor's wife\".Peter the Great: Memories (editor - Evgeny Anisimov). Pushkin Foundation, 1993. Page 170 At the request of Yaguzhinsky, his first wife, by the decree of Empress Catherine I, was imprisoned in the Theodore Monastery \"until the end of her days\", from where she tried to escape twice, but was caught. She died, having lived in a monastery for ten years, as a nun with the name of Agafya. ==Attorney General== From January 22, 1722 \u2013 lieutenant-general. Four days earlier, he was appointed the first ever Prosecutor General of the Governing Senate. In modern terminology, this post corresponds to the Attorney General.General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation | History in faces His duties included the fight against embezzlement: According to the characteristics of the Soviet historical encyclopedia, the first prosecutor general \"was distinguished by directness, honesty and integrity, tirelessness in the work\".Yaguzhinsky Pavel Ivanovich // Soviet historical encyclopedia. - Moscow: Soviet Encyclopedia. Edited by Yevgeny Zhukov. 1973-1982. Volume 16. Pages 844-845 There is a case in which, irritated by the general embezzlement, Peter I demanded in the Senate to adopt a law according to which everyone who steals more than a piece of rope from the state will be on this rope hanged. Shocked senators depressed silent. Finally, the almighty prosecutor general Pavel Yaguzhinsky, an honest and charming alcoholic, answered the king that then Peter would not have a single citizen, because \"we all steal, who are more, who are less\". Shocked by this answer that entered the history of Russia, the tsar did not dare to adopt such a law. The emperor tirelessly noted the merits of Yaguzhinsky. In May 1724, at the establishment of the coronation of Catherine I of the Chevalier Guard Regiment, he was appointed its commander with the rank of lieutenant captain. Received in eternal possession of Mishin Island in the mouth of the Neva. In 1720, a three-storey stone house was built for Yaguzhinsky under the project of Georg Mattarnovi and Nikolai Gerbel on the Neva Embankment. As prosecutor general, Yaguzhinsky served as a counterweight to the powerful Prince Menshikov and somewhat limited his appetites. At the court in Yaguzhinsky, they saw \"the accuser and enemy of all those personal and self-seeking aspirations\" that were characteristic of \"Peter's nestlings\". After Catherine I assumed the throne, the procurator general began to quarrel openly with Menshikov, who had strengthened his position, still did not miss a single court drinking party, and during the vigil in Peter and Paul Cathedral appealed for protection to the coffin of the late emperor, so they feared that he might \"in a fit of despair, lay hands on himself\". After the establishment of the Supreme Privy Council and the establishment of the Menshik omnipotence, Yaguzhinsky left the post of procurator-general and was sent on August 3, 1726 as plenipotentiary minister to the Polish Sejm in Grodno, where the issue of Courland succession was examined.Anatoly Shikman. Figures of national history. Biographical directory. Moscow, 1997 Since October 24, 1727, he was a general-in-chief, although he did not serve in the army for a long time. ==Conflict with Osterman== The inscription on the grave of Yaguzhinsky Ober-Stallmeister Yaguzhinsky, in subsequent administrations, was maneuvering between opposing court factions with some success. In January 1730, he participated in the conspiracy of the \"supremes\", but, having lost faith in its success, on January 20 he informed Anna Ioannovna of everything, explaining to her that most nobles did not want to limit her power. On January 16, 1730 was arrested, but soon released. Anna Ioannovna fully rewarded the renegade. By decree of the Empress on March 4, 1730, Yaguzhinsky was appointed senator.Holders of the Imperial Order of St. Alexander Nevsky. Volume 1. - Moscow: Russian World, 2009. - In the same year (December 20), a rich Siberian Order was subordinated, from which he was to receive a salary \"by rank\". From December 31, 1730 \u2013 Lieutenant Colonel of the Life Guard Horse Regiment. In the period from October 2, 1730 to 1731 \u2013 the Prosecutor General of the Senate. On his initiative, the first Russian Cadet Corps was created. On January 19, 1731 was awarded the title of count. Quarrel with Osterman put an end to influence of Yaguzhinsky. On the day when Osterman celebrated the receipt of the title of count, Yaguzhinsky drank too much and began to shower his enemy in a foul language, for which the empress only slightly scolded him. The vice- chancellor, who did not forget the offense, soon achieved the establishment of the Cabinet of Ministers and the transfer of basic governmental functions to this body. Yaguzhinsky saw power slipping from his hands. The Empress ordered Yaguzhinsky to leave her court and sent him to another honorary exile \u2013 ambassador to Berlin. At the same time he was deprived of the ober- stallmeister court position (1732).Olga Sukhareva. Who was who in Russia from Peter I to Paul I. Moscow, 2005 However, two years later, Biron, having no means to overcome Osterman's influence, began to bother about Yaguzhinsky's return to Russia. He entered on April 28, 1735 into the Cabinet of Ministers with the return of the post of ober-stallmeister. From April 18, 1735 to April 6, 1736 \u2013 Cabinet Minister. Yaguzhinsky's health was already shaken long ago, and not so much by the busy life and the exorbitant work that he carried without rest for many years, as by binges and all sorts of excesses. With his age of 52 and gout, he should have had a more modest lifestyle. But he did not let up, he invariably attended dances and feasts, where he drank without lagging behind others. In January 1736, he fell ill with fever, which was complicated by gout attacks, and died in April of the same year. He was buried in the Annunciation Church of the Alexander Nevsky Monastery. His second-hand widow married the diplomat Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin. In 1743, in a Lopukha case, she was publicly carved with a whip and sent to Yakutsk exile. ==Reviews of contemporaries== In notes, the Spanish ambassador, the Duke of Lyria, reports about him: ==Awards== *Order of Saint Andrew (July 11, 1724) *Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky (August 30, 1725) ==Family== Countess Praskovya Yaguzhinskaya, married Princess Gagarin #Wife from 1710, Anna Fedorovna Khitrovo (died July 30, 1733), the only daughter of the clerk Fedor Alexandrovich Khitrovo (died 1703), the granddaughter of Alexander Khitrovo, a rich and influential man.
