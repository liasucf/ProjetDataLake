He was educated at Westminster School and privately by Michael Maittaire. He graduated from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1725. In May of that year he was made genealogist of the newly created Order of the Bath. On 6 October 1727, he was appointed Blanc Coursier Herald. This was a new office attached to that of the genealogist and first companion of the order; this creation was the work of his father, who had risen to the post of Garter Principal King of Arms. Later in 1727, Anstis was created joint Garter with his father and in 1733 he accompanied him to The Hague to invest the Prince of Orange with the Order of the Garter. In 1736 he was made a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and he became the sole Garter King of Arms on his father's death in 1744. In 1749, he became a barrister of the Middle Temple, although he never practised law. The younger Anstis died a bachelor on 5 December 1754 at his house in Mortlake, Surrey, and was buried at Duloe, Cornwall. ==Arms== == See also == * Heraldry == External links == * The College of Arms * Heraldic List of Officers of Arms == References == ;Citations ;Bibliography * John Anstis.
