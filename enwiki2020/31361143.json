Hiking Trails of the Santa Monica Mountains. Canyon Pub Co. Pages 85 and 96. . Located near the western edge of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, the summit provides panoramic views of Malibu, The Pacific Ocean, Santa Monica, the Conejo Valley, and four of the Channel Islands. The Sandstone Peak Trail, which leads to the top, connects to a vast trail system in the area, including the Backbone Trail. The mountain is highly popular with climbers, hikers, campers, and photographers. The Boy Scouts of America petitioned the U.S. Board on Geographic Names to name the mountain for W. Herbert Allen who had donated land for nearby Camp Circle X and other Boy Scout camps. He served as president of the Los Angeles Area Council. The board denied the request because of a long-standing policy not to approve a geographic name in commemoration of a living person. The land is now known as the Circle X Ranch, a park unit located in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. == See also == * Santa Monica Mountains * Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area * List of highest points in California by county * Backbone Trail * Chumash people {| |A group of hikers atop the summit of Sandstone Peak |The summit of Sandstone Peak features a plaque and guestbook |} == References == == External links == * * Category:Santa Monica Mountains Category:Mountains of Ventura County, California Category:Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Category:Scouting in the United States Category:Mountains of Southern California ",
