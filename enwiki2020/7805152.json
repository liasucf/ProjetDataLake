    "text": "Rah\u015fan Ecevit (n\u00e9e Aral; 17 December 1923 \u2013 17 January 2020) was a Turkish author and political activist. She was the wife of Turkish politician and Prime Minister B\u00fclent Ecevit. She was born in Bursa, Turkey to a family from \u015eebinkarahisar, a town in the north-eastern Giresun Province. Her father was Nam\u0131k Zeki Aral, and her mother Zahide Aral. Their family came from Thessaloniki after the population exchange agreement in 1920. Rah\u015fan graduated from the American high school Robert College in \u0130stanbul. She married her classmate B\u00fclent Ecevit in 1946. Following the military coup in 1980 led by General Kenan Evren, her husband was imprisoned and was suspended from active politics for life. B\u00fclent Ecevit's party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), was closed down. On 14 November 1985, Rah\u015fan founded a centre-left social democratic party, the Democratic Left Party (DSP) and led it until her husband's ban from politics was lifted in 1987. Rah\u015fan Ecevit was the vice president of the Democratic Left Party and responsible for the party's organization between 1989 and 2004. She became the leader of the new Democratic Left People's Party (DSHP) on 17 January 2010, when the DSP seemed to no longer have any chance to win seats in elections. After Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu had become the leader of the CHP and halted the rightist trend within the party she disbanded her new party and with many members joined the now rather social democratic CHP. On 5 November 2006, her husband died following an almost 6-month long medically induced coma. Rah\u015fan Ecevit died on 17 January 2020 at a hospital in Ankara and was buried next to her husband in the Turkish State Cemetery a few days later. ==See also== * Women in Turkish politics ==References== Category:1923 births Category:2020 deaths Category:People from Bursa Category:Democratic Left Party (Turkey) politicians Category:Alumni of Arnavutk\u00f6y American High School for Girls Category:Turkish women in politics Category:Democratic Left People's Party politicians Category:Female party leaders of Turkey Category:Burials at Turkish State Cemetery Rahsan ",
