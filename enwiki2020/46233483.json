Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned contiguously without restrictions regarding county boundaries. At this time there were two major political parties: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, the Right to Life Party, the Libertarian Party, the Communist Party, the New Alliance Party and the Workers World Party also nominated tickets. ==Elections== The New York state election, 1984, was held on November 6. No statewide elective offices were up for election. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for U.S. President, was: Republicans 3,377,000; Democrats 3,120,000; Conservatives 288,000; Liberals 118,000; Libertarians 12,000; Communists 4,000; New Alliance 3,000; and Workers World 2,000. Twenty of the 23 women members of the previous legislature\u2014State Senators Mary B. Goodhue (Rep.), a lawyer of Mount Kisco; and Olga A. M\u00e9ndez (Dem.), of East Harlem; and Assemblywomen Elizabeth Connelly (Dem.), of Staten Island; Pinny Cooke (Rep.), of Rochester; Geraldine L. Daniels (Dem.), of the Bronx; Gloria Davis (Dem.), of the Bronx; Eileen C. Dugan (Dem.), of Brooklyn; Aurelia Greene (Dem.), of the Bronx; Julia Harrison (Dem.), of Queens; Rhoda S. Jacobs (Dem.), of Brooklyn; Cynthia Jenkins (Dem.), a librarian of Queens; Gerdi E. Lipschutz (Dem.), of Queens; Helen M. Marshall (Dem.), a teacher and librarian of Queens; Nettie Mayersohn (Dem.), of Queens; Mary M. McPhillips (Dem.), of Middletown; May W. Newburger (Dem.), of Great Neck; Barbara Patton (Dem.), a lawyer of Hempstead; Toni Rettaliata (Rep.), of Huntington; Louise M. Slaughter (Dem.), of Fairport; and Helene Weinstein (Dem.), a lawyer of Brooklyn\u2014were re-elected. Nancy Larraine Hoffmann (Dem.), of Syracuse; Velmanette Montgomery (Dem.), of Brooklyn; and Suzi Oppenheimer (Dem.), of Mamaroneck; were also elected to the State Senate. Catherine Nolan (Dem.), of Queens, was also elected to the Assembly. Thus the 186th Legislature began having 24 women members, surpassing the previous record of 23 in the 185th New York State Legislature (1983\u20131984). The New York state election, 1985, was held on November 5. One vacancy in the State Senate was filled. ==Sessions== The Legislature met for the first regular session (the 208th) at the State Capitol in Albany on January 9, 1985;CUOMO PLAN SEEKS REVIVAL OF SPIRIT OF THE NEW DEAL by Maurice Carroll, in The New York Times on January 10, 1985 and recessed indefinitely on June 30.LAWMAKERS ACT ON RENTS, AND RECESS by Edward A.
