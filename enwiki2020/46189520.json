Kaber Lake is major source of fresh water fishes which is famous for its delicacy in the region. Birds including different species of Cranes, Doves, Hawks, Fowls, Quails etc. and a variety of aquatic plants create a wonderful scene here in the winter and spring. ==Jaimangla Garh== Jaimanglagarh is famous not only for its archaeological importance. It is a historical site related to the religious sentiments of people of this region. It has ample reputation as the Shaktipeeth. Goddess Jaimangalain local tradition is believed to fulfill the wishes of devotees. The sculpture of Vishnu is placed in another temple just in the northern side of the old Goddess temple. It is said that the area of the mound was entirely covered with forest, which was helpful in Tantra- practices. The vast Kawar lake touching the foot of the mound presents a remarkable landscape to the viewers. Overall the site has immense potency to be developed as a tourist place. On the one hand the Jaimanglagarh mound, the sculptures, the set of Herson stupa across the lake and the other smaller mounds surrounding it reflect its archaeological prominence, the vast lake, its Bio- diversity and its profoundness to be the shelter of thousands of migrant birds in winters proclaim it to be developed as an eco- tourist centre. Having such important sites in a periphery of only four square kilometres this site should be developed as a tourist complex. ===Jaimanglagarh Mound=== Jaimangalpur is situated on the southern flank of the vast Kawar Lake. It is popularly known as Jaimangalgarh. The topology and the height of the mound is remarkable. Jaimangalgarh is in fact a set of two mounds. The western part is separated by a channel from the main eastern part. The eastern has evidence of fortification. It is large in size. At present the temple of mata Jaimangala, for which the site enjoys the great popularity in local tradition, is situated on this southern part. The variety of potshreds can be seen everywhere on both mounds. (N.B.P. black polished ware, Redware etc.). It seems that the fortified southern part used to remain the residential premises of the royal family whereas the northern might be associated to officials. It is important to notice that there are few other mounds across the Kawar Lake surrounding the main mound. One is towards south while the other is towards East. The cultural sequence of the both mounds seems to be almost same and both of them seem to come into existence just after the main site. The Harsan stupa is towards East and at least another two mounds namely Kanti Dih and Sakra Bad lie in the same direction. In short, at least four smaller mounds and the stupa fall in the periphera of 2 km . Sculpture \u2013 Black stone, Pala period. Four handed Vishnu standing sambhanga. A well decorated crown over head. Ajamulambi Mala (garland), right lower hand exposed frontward in Abhaymudra while upper left holding the Shudarshan Chakra. Gada placed downward between the lower armpit. Upper left hand holding the shankha upward while lower holds the shrifala. Under this arm holding shrifala is sitting Garuda Dev in worshiping posture (Aradhaya mudra). The sculpture seems to represent the matured pala or Rajputa period. ==Education== Manjhaul is home to a number of schools and colleges. R.C.S.

But a time came when killing of birds in his neighbourhood \u2013 in and around Kanwar lake in Begusarai was declared illegal and a traditional bird-trapper found himself being called a poacher and intruder. Hussain however continued with his old ways not able to find any other occupation he could excel at. Then again, another time in the 1960s, Hussain had an encounter with the famed Salim Ali. Salim Ali took the talented poacher under his wings as an assistant and what you then get is a scientist of the folksiest kind! Traditional bird-trapper to poacher to a scientist is indeed like having lived three lives in one. Hussain lives at Manjhaul village in Begusarai and assists scientists on projects.

He knows the English and Hindi names of around 500 species of birds. ==Culture== ===Festivals=== People of Manjhaul celebrate Chhath, Durga Puja, Holi, Diwali, Makar Sankranti, Eid al-Fitr, Muharram and many more festivals. ==References== Category:Villages in Begusarai district ",
