They are best known for their self-titled song \"Art in America\" released in 1983.http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=1951 ==Background== The band was the first-known rock band featuring a pedal harp to appear on a major record label. Art in America was formed in 1980 by brothers Chris Flynn and Dan Flynn and sister Shishonee (real name Ruetenik). Harpist Shishonee, was formerly a member of the band The Trees Community.http://thetreescommunity.com/ Joining Art in America was friend Jim Kuha. Originally called Father, the band's name was changed to 'Art in America' and under this name the group began opening for popular English pop artists such as U2 and Roxy Music. In 1983, the group released their first studio album under Sony Music/Pavilion Records.https://musicbrainz.org/release/fd246d2f-f421-4d56-89ec-a034996a636f Produced by Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer producer Eddy Offord, the album contained their most popular song \"Art in America\"http://www.furia.com/page.cgi?type=twas&id;=twas0112https://news.artnet.com/art- world/art-magazine-rock-band-1191548 which received airplay on MTV music television, and radio stations throughout the United States. The songs were co-arranged by Stephen Steve Morse who also contributed a guitar solo for the song \"Undercover Lover\". The guest keyboardist on the album was Terry \"T\" Lavitz.http://www.allmusic.com/artist/t-lavitz-mn0000006315/credits In hopes of a better deal in releasing a second album, the band moved to Los Angeles in 1985. However, the band found the pay to play gig situation in L.A. to be hostile and disappointing. The band still records music and loads to many internet sites for free song streaming, as well as album and singles for purchase.http://www.allmusic.com/album/art-in-america-mw0000087269 Recently the band was contacted by producer David Hentschelhttp://www.thekeyboard.co.uk/ to finally record a follow-up studio album.
