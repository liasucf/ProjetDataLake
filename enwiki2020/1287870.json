    "text": "In meteorology, Dines' compensation states that net mass convergence into a given column of air must be balanced by a net mass divergence from the same column of air. The implication is that rising air in the atmosphere must be balanced by equal sinking or subsiding air. Dines' compensation applies especially in mesoscale circulations (i.e. supercells) and in macroscale and mesoscale tropical circulations. For instance, it is not uncommon to see anti- cyclonic cirrus outflow from a hurricane in visible satellite imagery. Dines' compensation applies differently in the mid-latitudes, as upper-level highs are not necessarily associated with surface lows. Jet streaks and other upper level features, however, can contribute or support lower level convergence/divergence. Category:Atmospheric dynamics ",
