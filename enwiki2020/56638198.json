    "text": "\"Want You Back\" is a song recorded by Australian pop rock band 5 Seconds of Summer. It was written by Calum Hood, Asia Whiteacre, Jacob Kasher Hindlin, Ashton Irwin, Luke Hemmings, Steve Mac and Andrew Goldstein, with production handled by Goldstein and Andrew Wells. The song was released via Capitol Records on 22 February 2018, as the lead single from their third studio album, Youngblood (2018). ==Background and release== Guitarist Michael Clifford first opened up about the third album and the upcoming single in an interview with Billboard in December 2017. He admitted: \"We're at a point now where we're almost ready to put out our first single,\" as he promised that fans could expect it \"really, really early in the new year\". On 16 February 2018, the band posted a black and white picture featuring all members on Twitter, captioning it \"Behind The Scenes 2018.\" They shared another tweet with the hashtag \"#5SOS3ISCOMING\" shortly afterwards, hinting at new releases. They also teased a few lyrics from the song and posted a GIF which says \"We Want You Back\". The song was officially announced on 19 February 2018, along with its release date, cover art, and a brief audio snippet. The song was released alongside the announcement of their worldwide promotional 5SOS III Tour dates. Drummer Ashton Irwin said of the song in an interview with Beats 1: \"'Want You Back' articulates the band we were, we are now, and what we're gonna be, that's why I like it and that's why we picked it. We also made it with close friends like we've got Andrew Goldstein who we literally see every week. We party together, we confess our sorrows and happiness. We speak to this man everyday.\" The band told news.com.au that they are \"super nervous\" about the comeback song which will introduce their third album. ==Critical reception== Madeline Roth of MTV News stated that the song \"marks a huge departure from the band's raucous pop-punk roots\". She found the band \"opting for a slick, more polished pop sound on the new tune, which finds them reminiscing about an ex and wondering what went wrong\". Althea Legaspi of Rolling Stone regarded it as a \"pop-flavored track reflects on a lost love and captures the yearning that often follows a breakup\". Hugh McIntyre of Forbes found the song \"surprisingly slick, especially for a band that has pushed a narrative of being rowdy rock boys\", and he noticed that the song was \"more mature\". Mike Wass of Idolator wrote that the band have abandoned \"the pop/punk of their first two albums and dive head-first into slick, radio-friendly pop with a rhythmic edge\". Rania Aniftos of Billboard deemed it an \"apologetic pop track\" and a \"synth-y upbeat tune\". Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio opined that it \"takes a step back from 5SOS's signature pop/punk vibes\" and \"playing up the guys' pop side a bit more\". ==Live performances== On 11 April 2018, the band performed the song live on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. They also performed the single on The Voice (U.S. season 14) on 8 May. ==Music video== The official music video was released on 27 March 2018. It features the members of the band performing in a colorful one-room set, depicting a scenario where the rules of gravity does not apply. The furniture can be seen fixed to the walls and ceiling as the band members remain on the ground while singing and playing their instruments. In some shots, they appear to be walking and sitting on the walls and ceiling. The video shows mostly full-room shots of the set and some closeup shots of the band members. The closeup shots of the band members' faces are often opaquely overlaid on the full-room shots. ==Track listing== *Digital download #\"Want You Back\" \u2013 2:53 *Digital download \u2013 acoustic #\"Want You Back\" (acoustic) \u2013 2:39 *Digital download \u2013 Tritonal remix #\"Want You Back\" (Tritonal remix) \u2013 3:26 ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. 5 Seconds of Summer * Calum Hood \u2013 composition, vocals, bass guitar * Ashton Irwin \u2013 compositions, vocals * Luke Hemmings \u2013 compositions, vocals, rhythm guitar * Michael Clifford \u2013 lead guitar, vocals Additional musicians * Asia Whiteacre \u2013 composition * Andrew Goldstein \u2013 composition, production, engineering, vocals, keyboard, editing, guitar, programming, additional vocals * Jacob Kasher Hindlin \u2013 composition * Steve Mac \u2013 composition * Andrew Wells \u2013 production, engineering, keyboard, editing, guitar, programming Technical personnel * Chris Gehringer \u2013 master engineering * Michael Freeman \u2013 mixing assistance * Spike Stent \u2013 mixing ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 32 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Greece (IFPI) | 54 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 26 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italy (FIMI) | 44 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Mexico Ingles Airplay (Billboard) | 17 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseekers (RMNZ) | 1 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 54 |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Arists (ARIA) | 40 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hungary (R\u00e1di\u00f3s Top 40) | 90 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2018 songs Category:2018 singles Category:5 Seconds of Summer songs Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Songs written by Andrew Goldstein (musician) Category:Songs written by Steve Mac Category:Pop ballads Category:Songs written by Asia Whiteacre ",
