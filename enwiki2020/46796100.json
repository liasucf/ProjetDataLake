On 8 September 2015, the FFA announced that the upcoming leadership election had been moved forward to October from the Spring of 2016, so as to leave more time for the preparation of the 2016 ConIFA World Football Cup, hosted by Abkhazia. Gubaz was initially running for re-election, but announced on 21 September his immediate resignation, leaving the field clear for Ruslan Ajinjal to be elected unanimously. On 27 October, Gubaz explained in an interview that he had called the early election after President Raul Khajimba had expressed his support for his work, but that he stepped down when he heard that Khajimba in fact supported Ajinjal's candidacy, because he \"didn't play such games\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:1968 births Category:People from Gudauta Category:Living people Category:Soviet footballers Category:FC Dinamo Sukhumi players Category:FC Dinamo Tbilisi players Category:Russian footballers Category:FC SKA Rostov-on-Don players Category:FC Rostov players Category:Russian Premier League players Category:FC Anzhi Makhachkala players Category:Association football midfielders ",
