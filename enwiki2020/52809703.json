Loxley United Reformed Church is a derelict Grade II* listed building located on Loxley Road in Loxley, a western suburb of the City of Sheffield, England.

It was built for the curate at St Nicholas\u2019 Benjamin Greaves who was about to be dismissed and his parishioners wanted him to stay in the area. Upon completion the chapel, which was set back 100 metres from Loxley Road had the look of a large house constructed from squared gritstone with Venetian windows. The local Bishop was asked to consecrate the building upon its opening but refused because it did not have an east window. In its early years the church was utilised as an Anglican place of worship with Benjamin Greaves continuing to preach until he was appointed to a new post at Stoney Middleton.Around Bradfield, Loxley and Hillsborough, Malcolm Nunn, Chalford Publishing, 1996, , Historical Details. Mr Greaves was succeeded by a Church of England minister, the Reverend Flockton.
