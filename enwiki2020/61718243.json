He matriculated at Durham University (Hatfield College) in 1971 to read for the General Arts course, where he competed for Durham University RFC and received a full palatinate. After graduating from Durham in 1974 he continued his education at St John's College, Cambridge, earning a PGCE in 1975. ==Rugby union career== Warfield, a centre, made his test debut against New Zealand on 6 January 1973. He earned 6 international caps in total, with his only win coming against Scotland at Twickenham during the 1975 Five Nations. Warfield, who stayed on at Cambridge after completing his PGCE, saw his rugby activity curtailed by knee problems: he missed most of the 1975 season due to injury and offered his resignation as captain of Cambridge University R. U. F. C. in October 1976, having already resigned as captain once before during the previous season. He played his club rugby for Rosslyn Park. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1951 births Category:English rugby union players Category:England international rugby union players Category:Living people Category:Rosslyn Park F.C. players Category:Durham University RFC players Category:People educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College Category:Alumni of Hatfield College, Durham Category:University of North Carolina alumni Category:Cambridge University R.U.F.C. players Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:Rugby union centres ",
