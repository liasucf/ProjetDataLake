Felix Fournery (13 May 1865 \u2013 2 February 1938) was a French painter, fashion illustrator, printmaker, watercolourist and socialite. A recognized artist in his days, he notably marked the collections of the Belle Epoque and the Interwar period, as he embodied the latest pictorial evolutions of the postimpressionist and symbolist styles. == Early life == F\u00e9lix Fournery was born of Louise Marie Davin, the only daughter of a writer, F\u00e9lix Davin, whom, like his wife, died extremely young. His mother was then raised in a nunnery, which she left only to be married to Edmond Fournery. Felix had a brother, George, who became General of the French Army. During the Franco-Prussian War, Fournery and his family took refuge in Villerville, where his mother had a small fisherman's house. His childhood was scarred by these round trips Paris-Villerville. == Training, career and other ventures == F\u00e9lix Fournery studied in the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts at the age of 18, while joining Jules Lefebvre's workshop. In 1887, he became a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais. From 1877 to 1920, his career as a painter was launched through several exhibitions. His works of the period are perticularly inspired by Paris and Normandy, Villerville especially, where he owned a fisherman's house, thanks to his mother. The Normandy coast is at the heart of his work. After a cruise to Spitsbergen and Norway in 1905 aboard the Ile-de-France, a liner leaving from Le Havre of the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Transatlantique, of which he illustrated the souvenir-catalog, he made two exhibitions in 1906, named \u00c9tudes et Impressions: one in the Mont\u00e9 Carlo Palace of Fine Arts (now demolished), and one at the Grand Palais. The works he brought back from this trip to the Far North were then very noticed. This period is marked by an approach both symbolist and postimpressionist. Fournery also sailed across the French coast for his works, thanks to his boat, La Jeanette, to the island of Noirmoutier for example. In 1914, appointed as the manager of the Val de Gr\u00e2ce complementary hospitalGolden Book of the institution itself, Villa Moli\u00e8re, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, in the Villa Montmorency, he moved there with his workshop. During the same period, he became a fashion illustrator, marking with his brush and his pen the collections of the Belle Epoque. Subtle drawer of women, this part of his work brings him close to Helleu, by his subjects, and his ways. He also drew costumes and stage sets. Thus he became the Artistic Director of the Revue des \u00c9l\u00e9gances F\u00e9minines de Buenos-Aires \u00e0 Paris. He then led with his wife C\u00e9cile, thanks to her talent as a formidable singer, a rich and active social life all along the Interwar period. Thus, he created solid friendships among intellectuals, such as Paul Bourget, Henry Duvernois, Miguel Zamacois or Eugene Brieux. In a completely different genre, F\u00e9lix Fournery is a founding member and installer of the Car Museum of Compi\u00e8gne. He notably reconstructed the salle d'auberge, from 1800s.Letters of Fournery and his kin with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis du Mus\u00e9e de la Voiture et du Tourisme de Compi\u00e8gne La Cleyde, P\u00e9rigord, attributed to F\u00e9lix Fournery. In 1934, he retired to the P\u00e9rigord near his beloved daughter, in the domain of his son-in-law, Les P\u00e2ques, in Montagnac-la-Crempse. Seduced by the skies and colors of the region, he chose to install his workshop in it, renovating for that La Cleyde, an old farmhouse of the surroundings. He could only enjoy for little, diying in 1938. == Personal life == First married to Jeanne Decle. The couple had three children: Jean Fournery, Marie-Antoinette Fournery and Marie- Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Fournery, who married the Earl Charles des Salles, owner of Les P\u00e2ques. His wife died aged thirty-two. A few years later, Fournery married again. He wed C\u00e9cile Coquard, daughter of the composer Arthur Coquard. Fournery and his second wife moved to Noirmoutier. Fournery's second marriage produced three children: Anne Fournery, Catherine Fournery and Monique Fournery. The marriage ends in divorce in the 1920s, leading Fournery, broken, to leave the Villa Montmorency for the P\u00e9rigord. == Legacy == In 1993, the Earl Pierre des Salles, a descendant of F\u00e9lix Fournery, organized an exhibition at the Town Hall of the 16th Arrondissement of Paris to revive the memory of his grandfather. Pursuing this objective, in 2016, another descendant of Fournery, Caroline Riggs-Delagrange, organized with the support of the Honfleur Town Hall an exhibition at the Greniers \u00e0 Sel de Honfleur titled F\u00e9lix Fournery. Also, Fournery's work continues to stand strong on the art market. == Fournery and literature == F\u00e9lix Fournery is quoted, not without irony, in Colette's Retreat from Love: \u00ab Je bus \u00e0 Marthe Payet et \u00e0 son mari, lui toujours premier-\u00e0-lasoie, elle \u00e9clatante et rousse, les cheveux en ondes larges sous un chapeau agressif, l\u2019air d\u2019un Helleu copi\u00e9 par Fournery\u2026 \u00bb, et encore \u00ab Marthe vient vers nous. De loin, c\u2019est toujours un Helleu.

He also received the Ordre des Palmes acad\u00e9miques and the Medal of French Gratitude.B\u00e9n\u00e9zit, 1960, p. 31 == References == Category:Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur Category:Knights of the Order of the Crown (Romania) Category:Recipients of the Order of the Crown (Italy) Category:Artists from Paris Category:1865 births Category:1938 deaths Category:19th-century French painters Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:French watercolourists Category:French male painters Category:20th-century French printmakers Category:Fashion illustrators Category:Recipients of the Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques ",
