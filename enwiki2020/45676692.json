    "text": "State Highway 37 (SH 37) is a New Zealand state highway in the Waikato/Waitomo region of the North Island. It exists as a small spur from to the Waitomo Caves, one of New Zealand's best-known tourist attractions. It was gazetted as a new state highway designation in 1997. For many years the old T-intersection with SH 3 was a high crash area with many fatalities including foreign tourists. In 2015 NZTA completed a new roundabout to improve safety on the route. ==See also== * List of New Zealand state highways ==References== ==External links== * New Zealand Transport Agency 37 Category:Transport in Waikato ",
