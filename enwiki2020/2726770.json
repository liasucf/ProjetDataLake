    "text": "JW Marriott is a mid-level luxury hotel brand owned by Marriott International. ==History== The JW Marriott brand was established in 1984, with the opening of the first hotel in Washington, D.C. It was named as a tribute to J.W. Marriott, the founder of Marriott Corporation. In 1989, Hong Kong was the destination for the overseas launch. Europe and the Middle East followed in 1993. As a general guide within the Marriott hierarchy, the brand competes in luxury as below Ritz-Carlton, but above the traditional Marriott and Renaissance. The JW Marriott Jakarta experienced terrorist bombings in 2003 and 2009. In the 2003 incident, a car bomb explosion outside the lobby killed 12 and injured 150, mainly Indonesians. Despite extensive damage, the hotel reopened five weeks later. In the 2009 incident, a bomb in a small breakfast room caused six deaths. An unexploded bomb in a guest room failed to detonate. In 2011, a mock terrorism exercise successfully brought a fake bomb into the JW Marriott Juhu, India. In the 2008 Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing, over 50 died at a regular Marriott. The same hotel had been attacked in 2004 and 2007. ==Accommodations== ===Historical=== {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw- collapsed\" |- !class=\"unsortable\"| !! !! US !! Non-US !! !!
