Later, he became Erasmus Ritter von Engert. == Biography == From 1809 to 1823, Engert studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna, and later made a study trip to Italy. On his return, he set himself up as a painter of portraits, historical scenes and copies of the Old Masters. In 1843, he was named a curator at the Imperial Painting Gallery in Belvedere Palace, where he devoted himself to restoration work. In 1857, he became the gallery's director, and published what is now considered a very deficient catalog of the collection. In 1865, Kaiser Franz Joseph I awarded him the title of Ritter (Knight) and entered him into the nobility. == Sources == * Biographical notes from the Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich @ WikiSource * == External links== Category:1796 births Category:1871 deaths Category:Austrian painters Category:Austrian curators Category:Austrian art directors ",
