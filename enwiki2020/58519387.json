Columbo sailed between Britain and India under a license from the British East India Company (EIC) until she was damaged in 1822 while returning from Ceylon. She was condemned at Point de Galle and sold there for breaking up. ==Royal Navy== The Navy commissioned North Star under Commander Thomas Coe. He received promotion to post captain in April 1811 and at that time the Navy reclassed her as a post ship of 20 guns. Lloyd's List (LL) reported on 27 September 1811 that North Star had detained the Spanish ship Viscount Wellington, Wickes, master. Viscount Wellington had been sailing from Amelia Island to Deptford and North Star set her into Rasgate.LL \u21164601. On 10 May 1812 North Star was in company with when they captured Brick. North Star sailed for the Leeward Islands on 6 June 1813. In January 1814 , Hill, master, was on her way from Hull to Montego Bay, Jamaica, when she ran aground and lost her rudder near Montego Bay. North Star towed her off.Lloyd's List 29 March 1814. Franklin, of New York, Thomas, master, foundered on 7 November while sailing from Lisbon. North Star rescued the crew.Lloyd's List \u21165038.

The American privateer Saucy Jack had captured the sloops, which North Star sent into Montego Bay, where they arrived on 30 November.Lloyd's List \u211649948. In November 1815 Commander George Bentham replaced Coe on the Jamaica Station. Bentham received promotion to Captain in September 1816. Disposal: The \"Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\" offered the \"North Star sloop, of 433 tons\", lying at Deptford, for sale on 30 January 1817. The Navy finally sold North Star on 6 March 1817 to Thomas Pitman for \u00a31010 for breaking up. However she was resold into mercantile service. ==Mercantile service== In 1817 C. Joad & Co., purchased North Star and renamed her Columbo (or Colombo). The EIC had in 1813 lost its monopoly on the trade between Britain and India and numerous ship owners put their vessels into that trade, sailing under a license from the EIC. Columbo underwent a thorough repair in 1817 and first appeared in Lloyd's Register in 1818 with T. Webb, master, Joad & Co., owner, and trade London\u2212Bombay.Lloyd's Register (1818), Seq.\u2116C682.
