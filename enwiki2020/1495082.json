It caters for approximately 1,271 students from the ages 13 to 18 as of 2014, as it is part of the three tier system. Students' studies at the College lead up to GCSE, GNVQ, AS-Level and A-Level qualifications. Adult learning courses are also offered, as well as a nursery for preschool children. The College contains two distinct student bodies based on the year group a student is in. Pre-16 students are those in Years 9, 10 and 11 who are mostly studying for GCSEs. In 2009 44% of students achieved the equivalent of five or more GCSES Grade C or above including English and Maths. Post-16 students are part of the school's Tertiary sector and so are known as Sixth Form students. They are for the most part studying AS/A-Levels. The site has a large self containted Sixth Form building called Frome Futures ECOS The College campus incorporates both the 240 seat Merlin Theatre and Frome Leisure Centre, both of which are open to the school's use during school hours. The Leisure Centre offers a wide range of activities including swimming, indoor bowls, squash and a gym. The school changed its uniform in September 2013 to a more formal style. This change completely revamped the uniform, with the Year 9, 10 and 11 students wearing a navy blue blazer with purple lining bearing the school logo and the word 'Frome' below, a white shirt, and their house colour (red, orange, green or blue) clip on tie, mid grey trousers or purple and white tartan skirt and black shoes. ==Notable alumni== *Jenson Button (born 1980), 2009 Formula One World Drivers' Champion *Kerry Wilkinson (born 1980), bestselling author ==References== ==External links== * Frome College Official website Category:Upper schools in Somerset Category:Frome Category:Community schools in Somerset ",
