After posting a 5\u20132 record in Stage 1, the Defiant qualified for the Stage 1 Playoffs, but a 0\u20133 loss against the Shock eliminated the team in the quarterfinals. The team failed to recreate the success they found in Stage 1 in the following stages, going 2\u20135, 0\u20137, and 1\u20136 in Stages 2, 3, and 4, respectively. A 2\u20133 loss to the Fusion on August 4 officially eliminated Toronto from postseason contention, and three days later, the team released head coach Lee \"Bishop\" Beom-joon. Despite numerous roster changes throughout the season, the Defiant finished the season in 17th place overall with an 8\u201320 record. == Preceding offseason == The roster of Toronto Defiant at the beginning of the 2019 Overwatch League season: Left to right, top to bottom: Aid, envy, RoKy, Neko, Ivy, Yakpung, Asher, Stellar. Toronto announced their initial inaugural season roster over a span from October 27 to November 27; the team's roster consisted of the following players: *Lee \"envy\" Kang-Jae, *Park \"Neko\" Se-hyeon, *Lee \"ivy\" Seung-hyun, *Lee \"Stellar\" Do-hyung, *Jo \"Yakpung\" Gyeong-mu, *Ko \"Aid\" Jae-yoon, *Choi \"Asher\" Jun-sung, and *Park \"RoKy\" Joo-seong. == Regular season == === Stage 1 === The Defiant opened their 2019 season with a match against the Houston Outlaws on February 15. Despite losing the first two maps, Toronto was able to grab the second two to force a fifth tiebreaker map on Busan; the Defiant won that map as well, completing a reverse sweep, and won the match 3\u20132. The following week, Toronto took on fellow expansion franchise Atlanta Reign on February 22. After taking the first map, Busan, the Defiant lost the next three maps to fall by a score of 1\u20133. Two days later, the team faced the Los Angeles Valiant. Led by strong performances by Kang-jae \"envy\" Lee and Seung- hyun \"Ivy\" Lee, the Defiant were able to pull out a close 2\u20131 victory over the Valiant. Toronto's first match of week three was against the New York Excelsior on March 1. After a close map one loss on Busan, the Defiant dropped map two, King's Row to enter halftime down 0\u20132. Toronto lost map three, Temple of Anubis, to cement a series loss, but they were able to take map four, Dorado, to end the match with a 1\u20133 loss. Two days later, the team faced the Boston Uprising. Boston was favored to win the match against Toronto; however, the Defiant pulled out the upset by winning the match by a score of 3\u20131. The Defiant next faced the Chengdu Hunters on March 7. Unphazed by the Hunter's unorthodox compositions, the Defiant only dropped one map, Volskaya Industries, in the match, as they took the series with a 3\u20131 win. Toronto's final match of Stage 1 was against the Hangzhou Spark two days later. Standout performances by Kang-jae \"envy\" Lee and Park \"Neko\" Se-hyeon drove the Defiant to a 3\u20130 victory. The win finished Toronto's Stage 1 with a 5\u20132 record and secured the team a Stage 1 Playoff berth. At the end of Stage 1, the Defiant were tied with the Philadelphia Fusion for the third seed of the Stage 1 Playoffs. By rule, the teams would have to compete in an offline match to determine seeding; however, both teams agreed on a coin-flip, instead. The Defiant received the third seed and to take on the sixth-seeded San Francisco Shock in the quarterfinals on March 22. Mainly running Sombra-based compositions throughout the match, the Defiant took a point on the first map, Busan, but the Shock were able to adapt effectively to win the map. Map two, King's Row, was not as close as the first, as Toronto was unable to stop San Francisco from completing the map and were full-held themselves to go down 0\u20132 going into the match break. On the third map, Horizon Lunar Colony, both teams were able to complete the maps on their respective attacks, pushing the map to an overtime round. The Defiant, who had smaller time-bank, could not edge out a victory on the third map and lost the series 0\u20133. === Stage 2 === Just a few days prior to the beginning of Stage 2, Toronto Defiant parted ways with their strategic coach Kim \"Don\" Dong-wook. A day later, DPS player Lee \u201cStellar\u201d Do- hyung retired from professional Overwatch for personal reasons. To take his place, Defiant signed Jin \"im37\" Hong, who had been playing Overwatch professionally for only just over a month, hours before the beginning of Stage 2. The Defiant opened Stage 2 on April 5 with a match against the Washington Justice. The Defiant won on Oasis and Hanamura to enter halftime with a 2\u20130 lead. The third map, Blizzard World saw the debut of im37, and the team took that map as well to cement the victory. A loss on the final map ended the match with a 3\u20131 victory for Toronto. The team took on Boston Uprising a day later. Although the Defiant was able to take the first to maps of the match, the Uprising were able to pull off a reverse sweep, as Toronto took a 2\u20133 loss. The Defiant's first match of the following week was against the Philadelphia Fusion on April 11. The Defiant lost on Busan but won on Paris to enter halftime tied 1\u20131. Toronto was held from completing both Blizzard World and Rialto on their attacks and, on their defenses, were unable to stop Philadelphia from pushing the payload further to drop both maps and lose the match 1\u20133. Two days later, Toronto took on the Dallas Fuel. Despite a close map loss on Paris, the Defiant were rolled throughout the match and were handed their first 0\u20134 sweep of the season. For their only match in week three, the Defiant faced the San Francisco Shock in a rematch of the Stage 1 Quarterfinals. Toronto was shut down on Lijiang Tower and lost a closer map on Hanamura to enter halftime down 0\u20132. On map three, Eichenwalde, the Defiant were only able claim one point on their attack and could not stop the Shock from pushing the payload further to lose that map as well. The team was subsequently full-held on Watchpoint: Gibraltar to ultimately pick up their second 0\u20134 loss in a row. After a week off, Toronto's next match was against the undefeated, and fellow Canada-based team, Vancouver Titans on May 3. After losing map one, Oasis, the Defiant claimed the next map, Temple of Anubis to even the series. Coming out of halftime, Toronto was unable to win on King's Row or Junkertown and lost the series 1\u20133, putting the team on a five-game losing streak and officially eliminating them from Stage 2 Playoff contention. The team's final match of Stage 2 was against the Paris Eternal two days later. Toronto was able to take map one, Lijiang Tower; on Temple of Anubis, the second map, the Defiant capped both points on their attack; on the Eternal's attack, the team capped the first point with over five minutes remaining but could not find ground on the second. Toronto went on to win on King's Row and Watchpoint: Gibraltar to claim their first 4\u20130 sweep of the season. === Stage 3 === There were more roster changes for Toronto heading into Stage 3. Both tank Daniel \"Gods\" Graeser and tank Normunds \"sharyk\" Faterins were moved up from the Defiant's academy team Montreal Rebellion in mid-May. The Defiant also had another roster member leave, as Choi \"Asher\" Joon-seong retired from competitive Overwatch on May 29. For their first match of Stage 3, Toronto faced the Paris Eternal on June 7. After winning on Ilios, Toronto was full-held on map two, Paris, and eventually lost the map to enter halftime tied 1\u20131. The Defiant were unable to find wins on Hollywood and Havana to fall 1\u20133 in the match. In their only match in week two, Toronto took on the London Spitfire. The team was able to win the first map, Ilios, but they were unable to find another map win afterwards, falling to the Spitfire by a score of 1\u20133. Following the loss, Toronto transferred off-tank Lee \"envy\" Kang-jae, who had not played in a match since Stage 2, to the Shanghai Dragons on June 18.

Toronto took on the Los Angeles Gladiators on the same day, June 28. A quick loss on Nepal and another loss on Horizon Lunar Colony put the Defiant down 0\u20132 going into halftime. The team was able to put on a more competitive showing on Numbani and Dorado by completing the maps on their attacks, but the Gladiators were able to do the same and won both maps in overtime rounds, giving the Defiant their second straight 0\u20134 sweep. Toronto's next match was two days later against the Houston Outlaws; the Defiant were handed their fifth consecutive loss after losing the match 1\u20133.
