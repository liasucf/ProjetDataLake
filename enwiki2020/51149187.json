    "text": "The 2016\u201317 Maltese Premier League was the 102nd season of the Maltese Premier League. The season began on 19 August 2016 and concluded on 6 May 2017; the relegation play-off took place on 12 May 2017. Valletta were the defending champions, having won their 23rd title the previous season. On 30 April 2017, Hibernians defeated St. Andrews 3\u20131 to clinch their 12th Maltese league title. ==Format== For this season, in a change from recent previous seasons, points earned in the first 22 matches were no longer halved. Each team therefore played 33 matches, home-and-away against each other team (22 matches), and then one more match (either home or away) against each other team. ==Teams and stadiums== Naxxar Lions and Qormi were relegated to the 2016\u201317 Maltese First Division after they finished eleventh and twelfth, respectively, the previous season. They were replaced by G\u017cira United and \u0126amrun Spartans, champions and runners-up respectively of the 2015\u201316 Maltese First Division. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team !!
