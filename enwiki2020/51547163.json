It hurts our average.\u2019\u201d He also added that Richmond was his \"hometown (being from nearby Chesterfield County, Virginia), so I\u2019d probably be a little more aggressive than I would at any other racetrack, but ultimately this race isn\u2019t going to make or break a championship run for us, but it surely would do a whole lot for momentum and feel-good going into the Chase if we could win.\" ===Qualifying results=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | Driver ! scope=\"col\" | Team ! scope=\"col\" | Manufacturer ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1 |11 ||Denny Hamlin ||Joe Gibbs Racing ||Toyota ||21.905 ||21.970 ||22.069 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2 |42 ||Kyle Larson ||Chip Ganassi Racing ||Chevrolet ||21.845 ||21.979 ||22.079 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 3 |20 ||Matt Kenseth ||Joe Gibbs Racing ||Toyota ||21.938 ||22.011 ||22.087 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 4 |1 ||Jamie McMurray ||Chip Ganassi Racing ||Chevrolet ||21.865 ||21.999 ||22.097 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 5 |41 ||Kurt Busch ||Stewart-Haas Racing ||Chevrolet ||21.808 ||21.891 ||22.105 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 6 |78 ||Martin Truex Jr. ||Furniture Row Racing ||Toyota ||21.874 ||21.958 ||22.123 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 7 |5 ||Kasey Kahne ||Hendrick Motorsports ||Chevrolet ||21.816 ||22.039 ||22.123 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 8 |3 ||Austin Dillon ||Richard Childress Racing ||Chevrolet ||21.846 ||22.056 ||22.197 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 9 |18 ||Kyle Busch ||Joe Gibbs Racing ||Toyota ||21.844 ||21.996 ||22.230 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 10 |48 ||Jimmie Johnson ||Hendrick Motorsports ||Chevrolet ||22.011 ||22.050 ||22.323 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 11 |88 ||Jeff Gordon ||Hendrick Motorsports ||Chevrolet ||21.974 ||22.006 ||22.346 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 12 |22 ||Joey Logano ||Team Penske ||Ford ||21.983 ||22.080 ||22.392 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 13 |19 ||Carl Edwards ||Joe Gibbs Racing ||Toyota ||21.939 ||22.082 || |- ! scope=\"row\" | 14 |14 ||Tony Stewart ||Stewart-Haas Racing ||Chevrolet ||21.990 ||22.086 || |- ! scope=\"row\" | 15 |31 ||Ryan Newman ||Richard Childress Racing ||Chevrolet ||21.976 ||22.123 || |- ! scope=\"row\" | 16 |47 ||A.

The 12th caution of the race flew with 63 laps to go for Kenseth slamming the wall in turn 2. This came after contact with Keselowski on the previous restart. Kenseth said after the race that he was sure Keselowski would \"send a Tweet out or go on a TV show and explain how it wasn't his fault. But he knows better than that. He knows his angle was bad and he just drove way up in the corner because he made a mistake and he was trying to make up for it and had no respect for anybody on the outside lane. Unfortunately, we had a wrecked car because of it.\" Keselowski said he \"just missed a shift and ruined Matt's day. ... I made a mistake, and it was kind of crappy for everyone. Hopefully, he\u2019ll accept the apology. \u2026 That\u2019s not what anybody wants to see, including myself.\u201d The race restarted with 56 laps to go. The 13th caution of the race flew with 53 laps to go for Allmendinger wrecking on the fronstretch. The race restarted with 49 laps to go.

The 15th caution of the race flew with 36 laps to go for an eight-car wreck in turn 3. It started when Stewart came down across the nose of Newman's car and sent both of them into the wall. As they continued traveling, more cars were collected as Ragan slammed into the back of Newman's car, Scott slammed into Ragan's car and Dylan Lupton got into Newman and his car ended up off the ground. Newman said afterwards that Stewart \"has got issues. We all know he\u2019s got issues. He proved it again tonight. I was clearly inside of him getting into Turn 1, he cut across my nose, I was on the brakes, on the apron and I hit him coming off of Turn 2, but only because I got loose, I was on the apron. The next thing I know he is driving across my nose on the back straightaway because he\u2019s Tony Stewart and he thinks he owns everything. It\u2019s unfortunate, but shouldn\u2019t expect anything less from him.\u201d Stewart responded to Newman's comments saying his former teammate \"had to press the issue tonight and put himself in a couple of bad spots. There\u2019s 39 other guys you can put yourself in bad spots with. Don\u2019t put yourself in a bad spot with me and don\u2019t start shoving me around the racetrack because he knows from experience I don\u2019t put up with it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an important race,\" Stewart added. \"He was in a pressure situation coming into here and I had nothing to do with the first 25 races to put him in a pressure situation. You expect to get run into once or twice but the third time\u2019s the charm and that\u2019s when I had enough of it. I wrecked myself doing it. So it wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t wreck myself doing it. I\u2019m not really sure that I\u2019m going to lose a lot of sleep over his opinion.\u201d The red flag then came out to ensue to facilitate cleanup around the track, After 20 minutes and 23 seconds, the red flag was lifted and the field continued under caution. The race restarted with 31 laps to go. Hamlin was pulling away from the field and had the race all but locked up until Smith suffered a tire blowout, slammed the wall in turn 3 and brought out the 16th caution of the race with two laps to go. ===Overtime=== The race restarted with two laps to go, six laps past the 400 lap advertised distance, and Hamlin scored the victory while Kurt Busch spun out coming to the overtime line. ===Post-race=== ====Driver comments==== Hamlin said in victory lane that winning the race \"feels great. I\u2019ll tell you, our cars were really running well. Wheels and the whole group just gave me a great car. Really got it tuned in there the last half of the race. Just good restarts, finally everything just kind of worked well for us all day. I didn\u2019t think staying out was the right thing to do, but great call there, and actually, I got this from one of our Toyota guests on his birthday day today. He gave me this. He said it helped him get through tough times, so kept that in the car, and thank Eli for that.\u201d ===Race results=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" |- ! Pos ! Grid ! ! Driver !
