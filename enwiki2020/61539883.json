    "text": "IC 3583 is an irregular galaxy some 30 million light-years away in the constellation of Virgo. It was discovered by Isaac Roberts on April 29, 1892. It may seem to have no discernable structure, but IC 3583 has been found to have a bar of stars running through its centre. These structures are common throughout the Universe, and are found within the majority of spiral, many irregular, and some lenticular galaxies. Two of our closest cosmic neighbours, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, are barred, indicating that they may have once been barred spiral galaxies that were disrupted or torn apart by the gravitational pull of the Milky Way. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Something similar might be happening with IC 3583. This small galaxy is thought to be gravitationally interacting with one of its neighbours, the spiral Messier 90. Together, the duo form a pairing known as Arp 76. It\u2019s still unclear whether these flirtations are the cause of IC 3583\u2019s irregular appearance. == References == == External links == * 3583 Category:Irregular galaxies Category:Virgo (constellation) 076 ",
