The foundation -- one of the largest charitable organizations in the US, with assets of over $4 billion in 2019 \\-- makes grants in \"four program areas: mathematics and physical sciences; life sciences; autism research; and education & outreach.\" In 2016, the foundation launched the Flatiron Institute, a multidisciplinary academic research entity focused on computation. The foundation also funds two editorially independent online publications: Quanta Magazine and Spectrum. Quanta reports on developments in mathematics, theoretical physics, theoretical computer science and the basic life sciences. Spectrum provides news and analysis of advancements in autism research. ==Simons Investigators awardees== The Simons Foundation funds the Simons Investigators programSimons Investigators, The Simons Foundation which \"provides a stable base of support for outstanding scientists, enabling them to undertake long-term study of fundamental questions\".Simons Investigators Awardees, The Simons Foundation Simons Investigators are nominated by eligible universities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Awards are made in the categories of mathematics, physics, astrophysics, theoretical computer science, mathematical modeling of living systems (MMLS), and math+X. Awardees receive research support of $100,000 per year for five years. {| class=wikitable !
