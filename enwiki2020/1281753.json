    "text": "The Turkish Football Federation (; TFF) is the governing body of association football in Turkey. It was formed on 23 April 1923, and joined FIFA the same year and UEFA in 1962. It organizes the Turkish national teams, the Turkish Football League and the Turkish Cup. == Turkish football league system == The Turkish football league system is divided into eight tiers, ranging from the top-tier S\u00fcper Lig to local amateur divisions. == Turkish Cup == The Turkish Cup changed its name to the Federation Cup (Turkish: Federasyon Kupas\u0131) in the 1980-81 season, then back to Turkish Cup in 1992-93\\. ==Controversial denial of former national championships== Fenerbah\u00e7e on 9 September 1935|Turkish newspaper Son Posta announcing the Turkish championship title of Fenerbah\u00e7e on 9 September 1935. The TFF organized a nationwide championship as early as 1924. That year the Turkish Football Championship (Turkish: T\u00fcrkiye Futbol \u015eampiyonas\u0131) was held in order to bring forth a national football champion. The championship format was based on a knockout competition, contested between the winners of each of the country's regional leagues. Some years later, in 1937, the first national league called Mill\u00ee K\u00fcme was introduced. The league was held until 1950, one year before the Turkish Football Championship was also abolished. Even though both competitions were organized by the TFF and were official championships respectively, they are not acknowledged and counted by the very same federation which held them. Until today no official reason or motive was given for the unparalleled and irregular denial. All other football associations in Europe without exception consequently acknowledge their former national championships. The Turkish Federation is the only one with such a stance. As a result, Ankara Demirspor became the first club to officially demand the federation to acknowledge their championship title won in those decades, but received no answer at all to date. Club president Nu\u011fman Yavuz stated that he contacted the Turkish Federation twice, but the federation did not respond in any way. Similarly, Fenerbah\u00e7e also requested proper acknowledgement of these national championship titles, and faced the same unconstructive reaction. Having won a total of nine titles in both former championships, the club demands to have those official titles rightfully acknowledged. The lack of comprehension and awareness concerning the baseless denial of proper championship titles is growing in the general Turkish public and among Turkish sports people. For instance, Mehmet Demirkol, a renowned sports writer and commentator, stated that Be\u015fikta\u015f won their 20th championship title overall in the 2016\u201317 season, not their 15th. Numerous other sports writers, persons of authority, politicians, and officials also openly expressed their opinions on this issue and reinforced the view that the Turkish federation should unambiguously acknowledge and count the former championship titles. == Hosting bids == Turkish Football Federation's Hasan Do\u011fan National Teams Camp and Training Facility at Riva, Beykoz in Istanbul. Turkey has had several unsuccessful bids to host the UEFA European Championship. Turkey submitted a joint bid with Greece for UEFA Euro 2008, which failed. Their bid for UEFA Euro 2012 was also unsuccessful, with the competition going to Poland and Ukraine. The federation also submitted a bid to host UEFA Euro 2016, but on May 28, 2010, UEFA announced that Euro 2016 would be hosted by France. France beat bids of Turkey (7-6 in voting in second voting round) and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first voting round. Turkey were also bidding for UEFA Euro 2024, competing against Germany. Germany were announced the hosts on September 27, 2018 at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. Turkey had already hosted the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final and the 2009 UEFA Cup Final in Istanbul. At the youth- level, they hosted the UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship in 2008, after first hosting the event back in 1993. ==Summary== As of May 2019 {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! width=350|Event !scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold; width:55px;\"|Gold !scope=\"col\" style=\"background:silver; width:55px;\"|Silver !scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#cc9966; width:55px;\"|Bronze ! width=55|Total |- |colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"align=center|Football |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| FIFA World Cup || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1/21 |- |align=left| FIFA U-20 World Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/22 |- |align=left| FIFA U-17 World Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/18 |- |align=left| FIFA Club World Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/16 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| FIFA Confederations Cup || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1/10 |- |align=left| FIFA Women's World Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/8 |- |align=left| FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/9 |- |align=left| FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/7 |- |align=left| FIFA Women's Club World Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/1 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| UEFA European Championship || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1/15 |- |align=left| UEFA European Under-21 Championship || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/21 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| UEFA European Under-19 Championship || 1 || 2 || 2 || 5/65 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| UEFA European Under-17 Championship || 2 || 0 || 1 || 3/37 |- |align=left| UEFA Nations League || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/1 |- |align=left| UEFA Women's Championship || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/12 |- |align=left| UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/20 |- |align=left| UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/12 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| UEFA\u2013CAF Meridian Cup || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1/5 |- |align=left| Football at the Summer Olympics || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/34 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| Football at the Mediterranean Games || 1 || 7 || 2 || 10/18 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| Football at the Islamic Solidarity Games || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1/3 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| UEFA Champions League || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1/64 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| UEFA Europa League || 1 || 0 || 1 || 2/48 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| UEFA Super Cup || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1/43 |- |align=left| UEFA Youth League || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/6 |- |align=left| UEFA Cup Winners' Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/39 |- |align=left| UEFA Women's Champions League || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/18 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| UEFA Regions' Cup || 0 || 0 || 2 || 2/10 |- |align=left| UEFA Amateur Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/4 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| Balkan Cup || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1/11 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| Balkans Cup || 3 || 1 || 3 || 7/27 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| ECO Cup || 3 || 2 || 0 || 5/6 |- |colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"align=center|Futsal |- |align=left| FIFA Futsal World Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/9 |- |align=left| UEFA Futsal Championship || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/11 |- |align=left| UEFA Futsal Under-21 Championship || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/1 |- |align=left| UEFA Under-19 Futsal Championship || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/1 |- |align=left| UEFA Women's Futsal Championship || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/1 |- |align=left| UEFA Futsal Champions League || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/18 |- |colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"align=center|Beach Soccer |- |align=left| FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/20 |- |align=left| FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup qualification (UEFA) || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/7 |- |align=left| Euro Beach Soccer League || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/21 |- |align=left| Euro Beach Soccer Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/15 |-bgcolor=#81c846 |align=left| Euro Winners Cup || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1/7 |- |align=left| Women's Euro Winners Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/4 |- |align=left| Beach Soccer at the European Games || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/2 |- |align=left| Beach Soccer at the Mediterranean Beach Games || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/2 |- |colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"align=center|eSports |- |align=left| FIFA eWorld Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0/14 |- !
