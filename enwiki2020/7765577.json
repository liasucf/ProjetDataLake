Chilean Americans (, chileno- estadounidenses, or ) are Americans who have full or partial origin from Chile. The Chilean population from the U.S. census was 126,810. In the United States, Chileans are the fourth smallest Hispanic group from South America and the fifth smallest overall amongst all Hispanic groups. Chilean Americans live mainly in the New York Metropolitan Area, South Florida, Los Angeles County, San Francisco Bay Area (esp. San Mateo County) and the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, with high population concentrations found in Queens in New York City; Northern New Jersey; Miami, Florida; and Nassau County, New York. Most Chileans migrating to the United States settle in metropolitan areas. After the 1960s, Chileans began to immigrate more for economic or academic rather than political reasons and that continues into the modern day. == History == Chileans and other South Americans have been present in the state of California since the 1850s gold rush. Not all Chileans made it to the gold fields. Some remained in San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento, and Stockton where they frequently worked as bricklayers, bakers, or seamen. Some with capital established themselves in various businesses, particularly the importation of flour and mining equipment from Chile. In the cities most tended to congregate and live in specific areas in the poorer sections of town. In the gold fields they lived in separate camp sites. In the summer of 1849 Chileans constituted the majority of the population of Sonora. Chileans frequently worked their mines as group efforts. When the placer gold ran out around Sonora the Chileans were amongst the first miners in California to extract gold from quartz. Historical remnants of those settlements influenced the names of locations such as Chileno Valley in Marin County, Chili Gulch in Calaveras and Chili Bar in Placer which was named after Chilean road builders. Names of Chilean towns and places are often found in the names of streets in Northern California: Valparaiso, Santiago, and Calera. After Allende was overthrown and a military regime was established in 1973, a large exodus of Chileans took place. Most fled to European countries, but a small group did emigrate to the US. The US government took these Chileans as refugees under a program for \"political parolees.\" Many of San Francisco's streets carry names of former residents of Chile: Atherton, Ellis, Lick, Larkin, and others. Chilean women also left their names: Mina and Clementina. Manuel Brise\u00f1o, an early journalist in the mines was one of the founders of the San Diego Union. Juan Evangelista Reyes was a Sacramento pioneer as were the Luco brothers. Luis Felipe Ram\u00edrez was one of the City Fathers in Marysville. The Leiva family owned at one time, much of the land in Marin County, including Fort Ross. In 1975, Chilean exiles of the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship established La Pe\u00f1a Cultural Center in Berkeley, California, which is to this day the largest Chilean cultural center in the United States. Chilean Americans have achieved many skills as entrepreneurs, judges, congressmen, and others. ==Motives of immigration== Most Chilean immigration to the U.S. has occurred largely since the 1990s. For the most part, Chileans left as either political asylees and refugees during the presidency of Salvador Allende, during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, or for economic reasons. The involvement of the United States in Salvador Allende's overthrow in 1973 led to political exiles fleeing from Chile to the U.S., as well as other countries. Also, there have been others that have emigrated to seek higher education and career development opportunities. Since the 1960 Valdivia earthquake and with 2010 Chile earthquake, many Chileans have pursued economic opportunities in the United States, with Paterson, New Jersey, representing an increasingly common destination. Many of the Pinochet-era immigrants were of middle or upper class origin. A significant proportion of them arrived with advanced educations and well-developed skills. They had contacts with other Chilean exiles and a sense of identity from their shared commitment to a democratic Chile. After a period of adjustment, many of them were able to pursue skilled jobs or professions. Unfortunately, others, who lacked skills or whose professional certifications were not recognized in the United States, were forced to take low-level jobs in which they were unable to use their skills. Some had been politically active students or union leaders in Chile who did not enter the United States with easily transferable skills. The second major arrival into the United States was mainly for economic or academic opportunities. Yet, in general, acquiring a U.S. Visa requires the applicant to have a stable economic background, so most Chileans emigrating to the United States since 1990 have done so mostly for study purposes or to further their academic backgrounds. == Identity == Most Chileans are castizos, meaning their ancestry is one quarter indigenous and three quarters Spanish and/or other Caucasian heritage. They rather identify themselves as both Hispanic and white. Some Chilean-owned stores and restaurants advertise as French and Italian. Many often prefer living in white suburban neighborhoods in the U.S., and have a strong sense of family. == Demographics == ===Population by state=== The 10 US states with the largest population of Chilean Americans are: # California \u2013 24,006 # Florida \u2013 23,549 # New York \u2013 15,050 # New Jersey \u2013 8,100 # Texas \u2013 6,282 # Virginia \u2013 4,195 # Maryland \u2013 4,146 # Utah \u2013 3,364 # Massachusetts \u2013 3,045 # Illinois \u2013 2,753 ===Population by urban agglomeration=== The largest populations of Chilean Americans are situated in the following urban areas: # New York- Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-PA MSA \u2013 20,688 # Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, FL MSA \u2013 17,161 # Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana, CA MSA \u2013 10,471 # Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV MSA \u2013 6,963 # San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont, CA MSA \u2013 4,000 # Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, MA-NH MSA \u2013 2,622 # Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, TX MSA \u2013 2,570 # Chicago-Joliet- Naperville, IL-IN-WI MSA \u2013 2,454 # Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, CA MSA \u2013 2,066 # Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, FL MSA \u2013 1,884 # Atlanta-Sandy Springs- Marietta, GA MSA \u2013 1,779 # Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA MSA \u2013 1,776 # San Diego-Carlsbad-San Marcos, CA MSA \u2013 1,730 # Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX MSA \u2013 1,686 # Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD MSA \u2013 1,505 # Salt Lake City, UT MSA \u2013 1,463 # San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA MSA \u2013 1,397 # Las Vegas-Paradise, NV MSA \u2013 1,376 # Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL MSA \u2013 1,215 # Phoenix-Mesa-Glendale, AZ MSA \u2013 1,211 ===Population by city proper=== # New York City, New York \u2013 7,026 # Los Angeles, California \u2013 4,112 # Miami, Florida \u2013 1,427 # Houston, Texas \u2013 934 # San Diego, California and Chicago, Illinois \u2013 876 # San Francisco, California \u2013 754 # Miami Beach, Florida \u2013 739 # Washington, DC \u2013 697 # San Jose, California \u2013 632 # Doral, Florida \u2013 622 # Kendall, Florida \u2013 613 # Hialeah, Florida \u2013 602 # The Hammocks, Florida \u2013 564 # Pembroke Pines, Florida \u2013 558 # Fontainebleau, Florida \u2013 549 # Hollywood, Florida \u2013 542 # Kendale Lakes, Florida \u2013 469 # Las Vegas, Nevada \u2013 467 # Boston, Massachusetts \u2013 405 # San Antonio, Texas \u2013 374 # Union City, New Jersey \u2013 372 # Charlotte, North Carolina \u2013 368 # Philadelphia, Pennsylvania \u2013 357 # Coral Springs, Florida \u2013 342 # Miramar, Florida and Austin, Texas \u2013 340 ===Population by percentage=== US communities with the highest percentages of Chileans as a percent of total population: (Source: Census 2010) # Brookeville, Maryland \u2013 3.73% # Manorhaven, New York \u2013 3.57% # Oyster Bay, New York \u2013 2.67% # Warm Springs, Virginia \u2013 1.63% # Dover, New Jersey \u2013 1.55% # Key Biscayne, Florida \u2013 1.50% # Sleepy Hollow, New York \u2013 1.48% # Forest Home, New York \u2013 1.40% # Doral, Florida \u2013 1.36% # Victory Gardens, New Jersey \u2013 1.32% # Wharton, New Jersey \u2013 1.27% # The Crossings, Florida \u2013 1.18% # The Hammocks, Florida \u2013 1.11% # Inwood, New York \u2013 1.10% # North Lynbrook, New York \u2013 1.01% Chileans are more than 1% of the entire population in only fifteen communities in the US.

The Chilean workday is similar to the American workday, with the regular businessman or woman working 45 hours a weekHarris Gomez Group, Chilean labour law \u2013 Overtime and how it works! from 8:30 am to 6:30 pm with a lunch break, as well as possibly staying behind at work for a few hours to work overtime. However, many Chileans outside Santiago are used to going home for lunch, something not as common in the US and with Chilean Americans. Unlike the \"normal\" American diet, Chileans are used to having four meals a day. Breakfast, lunch, tea (or onces) at about five o'clock, and a late dinner. Most people actually have onces at around 8 pm and skip dinner. Surprisingly, Chile is one of the only Latin countries where tea is a more popular drink than coffee, differing from American consumption trends as well ==Notable people== Actor Santiago Cabrera Actress and model Leonor Varela Actress Cote de Pablo Frank Duarte Nobel laureate Gabriela Mistral Singer and songwriter Francisca Valenzuela *Alexa Guarachi \u2013 Tennis player *Los Abandoned \u2013 Chilean American rock band *Marjorie Agos\u00edn \u2013 Poet, essayist, fiction writer, activist, and professor. *Fernando Alegria \u2013 Stanford professor *Marsia Alexander-Clarke \u2013 American video installation artist *Isabel Allende \u2013 Chilean writer *Fernando Alvarez \u2013 Jockey * Cayetano Apablasa (1847\u20131889) \u2013 Land owner and politician in Los Angeles, California.
