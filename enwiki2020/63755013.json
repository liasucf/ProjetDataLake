    "text": "The DeWolf family (also spelled D\u2019Wolf or DeWolfe) is a prominent Canadian and American family that traces its roots to Balthazar DeWolf. == Balthazar DeWolf == Balthazar DeWolf (d. July 1704) is first mentioned in the records of Hartford, Connecticut in 1656. In 1645, he married Alice Peck in Guilford, Connecticut. She was born on 26 February 1625, in Liddington, Rutland, England, a daughter of William Peck and Elizabeth Holt.Torrey, Clarence A. New England Marriages Prior to 1700 p. 218 DeWolf and Peck had at least five children. After 1668 they settled in Lyme, Connecticut. It is thought that Balthazar DeWolf was from the Livonian branch of DeWolfs, which is an offshoot of the Saxon branch.Perry, Calbraith B. (Calbraith Bourn), 1846-1914, \"Charles DWolf of Guadaloupe, his ancestors and descendants. Being a complete genealogy of the \"Rhode Island DWolfs,\" the descendants of Simon De Wolf, with their common descent from Balthasar de Wolf, of Lyme, Conn. (1668).\" 1902 However, that is only one of the most commonly cited versions, others mentioning that Balthazar DeWolf was a Huguenot, or Pole, or Russian, or Jew, or Dutch, or German. There is a high possibility that DeWolf was English or educated in England as he and his children only married to other English settlers, which was very common at the times. == Family tree of the DeWolfs == Both Nova Scotia's and Rhode Island's DeWolfs are descendants of Balthazar DeWolf as shown below: * Balthazar DeWolf (d.

He emigrated to Guadeloupe, the French West Indies. === Notable members === *Mark Anthony DeWolf (1726 \u2013 1793) was the fourth child of Charles DeWolf, the only one who returned to America. He became the patriarch of the Bristol branch of the family; he was a merchant and slave trader. *James DeWolf (1764 \u2013 1837), son of Mark Anthony DeWolf. He was one of the richest men of his time, making the majority of his fortune in the slave trade. * General George W. DeWolf (1778 \u2013 1844), a grandson of Mark Anthony DeWolf. He was a slave trader and the original owner of Linden Place. *Capt. John DeWolf (1779 \u2013 1872), a grandson of Mark Anthony DeWolf through his son Simon DeWolf. He was also known as John DeWolf II and \"Norwest John\". After many years exploring the coast of Alaska and the Northwest on the board of the ship Juno, he crossed the Pacific Ocean, then Siberia all way to St. Petersburg, Russia, by land, becoming the first American who crossed Asia. He captured this 1804\u20131807 expedition in his 1861 book A Voyage to the North Pacific and a Journey through Siberia More Than Half a Century Ago. *Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe (1808 \u2013 1895), a great-grandson of Mark Anthony DeWolf through Abigail (DeWolf) Ingraham (1755 - 1833), one of Mark Anthony's daughters. He was an Episcopal priest and later first Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Central Pennsylvania, the present-day Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem. *Theodora Goujaud DeWolf Colt (1820-1901), a daughter of George DeWolf. She was a published poet. She is credited with restoring Linden Place into one of the most famous mansions in New England. She was mother of LeBaron Bradford Colt and Samuel P.

In total, the Bristol DeWolfs are believed to have transported more than 11,000 slaves to the United States before the African slave trade was banned in 1808. == DeWolfs of Nova Scotia == In 1761, three of Balthazar DeWolf's descendants, Simeon, Nathan and Jehiel DeWolf, with households amounting to 19 persons immigrated to Horton Township, Nova Scotia, to settle in the Grand Pre area. Evelyn M. Salisbury's genealogy published in 1892 identified the three men as cousins and it also appeared in A. W. H. Eaton's, History of Kings County, despite Eaton's efforts to change some parts of Salisbury's genealogy. In 1991 the publication of Dophs and De Wolfs by Carol Stark Maginnis after extensive research of original sources, reviewing the correspondence between Rev. Eaton and Mrs. Stainsbury, and examining the research of the Lyme Study Group, concluded the men were three sons of Benjamin DeWolf Sr. (born in October 1695), who was a son of Steven and grandson of Balthazar. This matches Eaton's original belief the Nova Scotia family were descendants of Steven DeWolf, which had been disregarded in Salisbury's work, and which he then unfortunately copied in his own books. === Notable members === *Nathan DeWolf (1720 \u2013 29 March 1789) was born in Saybrook, Connecticut.

He was a son of Nathan DeWolf and served as a judge and political figure in Nova Scotia. *James Ratchford DeWolf (1787 \u2013 1855) was a merchant and political figure in Nova Scotia. He was the fifth child of Elisha DeWolf. *Thomas Andrew Strange DeWolf (1795 \u2013 1878) was a merchant and political figure in Nova Scotia.

Elisha DeWolf, Jr. was the postmaster of the community when the postal district name became official on August 13, 1830 replacing prior names including Mud Creek and Upper Horton. It was suggested the change was out of respect for his namesake father, Elisha DeWolf. == Other DeWolfs == * Delos DeWolf (1811 \u2013 1882), a prominent citizen of Oswego, New York, United States, a politician and a banker. * Calvin DeWolf (1815 \u2013 1899), a prominent lawyer and the first secretary of the Illinois chapter of the American Anti-Slavery Society. *Joseph N.
