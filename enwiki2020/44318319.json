    "text": "Whom the Gods Love (German: Wen die G\u00f6tter lieben) is a 1942 Austrian historical musical film directed by Karl Hartl and starring Hans Holt, Irene von Meyendorff, and Winnie Markus. The film is a biopic of the Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Hake p. 157 It was made as a co-production between the giant German studio UFA and Wien-Film which had been set up following the German annexation of Austria. The film was part of a wider attempt by the Nazis to portray Mozart as an authentic German hero. Like many German biopics of the war years, it portrays the composer as a pioneering visionary. The title refers to Mozart's middle name Amadeus (Latin for \"love God\") and to the aphorism \"he whom the gods love, dies young\" (Latin: \"\") from Plautus' Bacchides, lines 816\u201317, and earlier Greek sources, including Homer's mention of Trophonius; Mozart died at the age of 35. A British film of the same title had been released in 1936. ==Cast== * Hans Holt as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart * Irene von Meyendorff as Luisa Weber Langer * Winnie Markus as Konstanze Weber Mozart * Paul H\u00f6rbiger as Von Strack * Walter Janssen as Leopold Mozart * Rosa Albach-Retty as Frau Mozart * Annie Rosar as Frau Weber * Ren\u00e9 Deltgen as Ludwig van Beethoven * Thea Weis as Sophie Weber * as Josepha Weber * Curd J\u00fcrgens as Emperor Joseph II * Hans Siebert as Duke of Mannheim * Richard Eybner as Baron von Gemmingen * Fritz Imhoff as Albrechtsberger * as Hoeffer * as S\u00fcssmayr * Doris Hild * * * Franz Herterich * Otto Schm\u00f6le * Theodor Danegger * Alfred Neugebauer * * * Hermann Erhardt * * Erna Berger as Singer * Siegmund Roth as Singer * Karl Schmitt-Walter as Singer * Dagmar S\u00f6derquist as Singer == References == == Bibliography == * Hake, Sabine.
