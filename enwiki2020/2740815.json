    "text": "Jay Prakash Narayan Airport is a customs airport located in Patna, the state capital of Bihar in India. It is named after independence activist Jayaprakash Narayan. Patna is classified as a restricted international airport due to its short runway. It is the 14th busiest airport in India, and the annual passenger traffic increased by 30.6 per cent in the year 2018-19. To meet demand, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) is working to expand and modernise airport infrastructure. The airport is currently undergoing ambitious expansion project that is due to be completed in 2021. In addition to this, the AAI has proposed to develop a civil enclave at Bihta Air Force Station to serve as the second airport for Patna. ==Expansion== The runway length at Patna airport is 7,000 feet. Patna airport is sandwiched between the Sanjay Gandhi Jaivik Udyan and Phulwari Sharif railway station. The runway length is 1,938 metres for landing from the east and 1,677 metres for landing from the west. The area of terminal building will be increased from the existing 7,200 square metres to 57,000 square metres. The new terminal building of Patna Airport will be a two-storey structure, equipped with six aerobridges and an apron area to park 14 aircraft at any given time. At present, the airport has the capacity to park only six aircraft. Several existing buildings in and around Patna airport premises, including the Airport Colony and IAS Bhavan, will be demolished for the expansion work. Besides, several utility buildings, including the meteorological centre and Bihar Flying Club, will be shifted and a new ATC tower will be constructed adjacent to Birla Institute of Technology, Patna campus. 13.1 acres of land near the Patna airport will be used for construction of a world-class two-storey terminal building, and in lieu of that 11.35 acre of land in Anisabad, Patna will be transferred to Bihar Government by Airports Authority of India. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has proposed to extend the terminal for sustaining air operations at least till 2035 and handle 6 million passengers per annum. A new terminal building would be constructed and connected to the existing building via skybridge. In addition, the AAI has planned to develop a civil enclave at Bihta Air Force Station, 20 kilometres away from Patna, to cater to larger aircraft. In October 2016, Bihar cabinet approved the Patna master plan which envisages development of a new airport at Bihta. Bihar government is acquiring 126 acres of land for construction of Bihta Airport. In September 2018, Government of India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved for a new terminal building that will be designed by Singapore firm Meinhardt and will be able to handle 4.5 million passengers a year, compared to present 0.7 million in transit. The new terminal will have an area of 65,155 square metres, including a basement area of 18,650 square metres. Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Construction Company Limited has been selected to execute the design. The new terminal building of Patna airport will be complete by October 2022, construction already started in October-November 2018. As of February 2020, two floors of the multi-level parking garage were complete. 45% of work on the cargo complex, technical block, fire block and air traffic control tower have been completed. ==Structure== It has one runway designated 07/25 with an asphalt surface measuring .Airport information for VEPT from DAFIF (effective October 2006) ==Airlines and destinations== A map showing what airports are served by Patna ==Incidents== * On 17 July 2000, Alliance Air Flight 7412 crashed near the airport, killing 60 people. * On 4 July 2019, Indigo Airbus 320 flight made a hard landing, there were 128 people on board.
