    "text": "On September 21, 2007, the graduate programs in North Carolina State University's College of Management were brought under one name - the Jenkins Graduate School of Management. The programs were named in honor of Benjamin (Ben) P. Jenkins, III, a 1968 graduate of the university and vice-chairman and president of the General Bank at Wachovia Corporation. The Jenkins Graduate School includes the Master of Accounting and Master of Business Administration programs in the NC State College of Management, and the Graduate Economics Program offered jointly by NC State's colleges of agriculture and life sciences and management. The naming gift will be used to endow professorships and provide graduate scholarships for students. In addition, the naming of the graduate school will result in better name recognition for NC State's programs with students while competing with Duke University's Fuqua School of Business and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Kenan-Flagler Business School. == Programs Offered == Master of Accounting One-year program, Full-Time and Part-Time Fall 2007 enrollment: 94 Curriculum includes IT concentration Master of Business Administration Full-Time & Part-Time MBA, main campus & Research Triangle Park locations Fall 2007 enrollment: 328 Concentrations: BioPharma Management, Innovation Management, Entrepreneurship, Marketing Management, Financial Management, Services Management, Information Technology Management, Supply Chain Management Master of Global Innovation Management Full-Time, dual degree in international management for technical and science oriented graduates Economics Graduate programs Degree options offered jointly with NC State's College of Agricultural and Life Sciences Fall 2007 enrollment: 85 Ph.D., 65 Master's degree Options: Ph.D. in Economics Master of Economics M.A. in Economics M.S. in Agricultural and Resource Economics Accelerated Bachelor's-Master's Degree Program ==Rankings== Public Accounting Report MAC: 20 Bloomberg Business MBA: 29https://www.bloomberg.com/bschools/rankings/full_time_mba_profiles/ncst.html U.S. News & World Report Graduate Economics: 48 == About the College == 2007 Jenkins Graduate School of Management Named within the College of Management 2007 Innovation Management School launched by Executive Programs and the Center for Innovation Management Studies, in partnership with the Industrial Research Institute 2006 College opens Research Triangle Park site for part-time MBA Program 2005 Business Ethics Competition launched 2003 $10K Open Division added to EEI Business Plan Competition 2002 MBA Program established 1999 MS/Computer Networking with NC State's College of Engineering 1994 EEI Business Plan Competition launched by Entrepreneurship Education Initiative 1994 MAC Program established 1992 College established Faculty: 110 Curriculum: Focused on the management of innovation and technology, emphasizing real-world experience == About the University == North Carolina State University's College of Management is located in Raleigh, North Carolina, part of North Carolina's Research Triangle Park.
