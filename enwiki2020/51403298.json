Major emphases are on agriculture, forestry, health education, disaster preparedness, advocacy, and literacy. == History == Dr.Qazi Faruque Ahmed established Proshika in 1976 . While working in famine stricken north Bengal of Bangladesh observed that while there was no shortage of food in the market the poor people were unable to buy the food and starving to death in consequence. He also observed that people are not protesting against this gross injustice. From this experience and observation he realised that the cause of poverty and famine is the poor do not have purchasing power and power to protest against the violations of their rights. That is poor do not have economic power nor do they have social and political power. This realisation led him to believe genuine poverty alleviation will occur if poor are involved in a process of economic and social empowerment. Programs of Increasing income and employment will enhance their economic empowerment. Programs of training and education will increase their awareness and ability to organise, hence ensuring social empowerment, and enable the poor and marginalised to take initiative to attain their rights. For these objectives Dr.Qazi Faruque Ahmed established Proshika. ==References== Category:Organizations established in 1976 Category:Non-profit organisations based in Bangladesh Category:Economic development organizations Category:Microfinance organizations Category:Poverty-related organizations Category:Community development organizations ",
