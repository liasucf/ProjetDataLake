A sequel, All the Rivers Run II, was produced in 1989. == Story == All The Rivers Run follows the life of English girl, Philadelphia Gordon, from the time when she is shipwrecked and orphaned off the coast of Victoria in 1890. She spends most of her life around Echuca, on the Murray River, and invests some of her inheritance in the paddle steamer called PS Philadelphia. Her life is changed forever when she meets paddle steamer captain Brenton Edwards. She is torn between the harsh beauty of life on the river with its adventures, and the society life in Melbourne with her blossoming career as a painter. It is an adventure and a love story: between her, the men in her life, and the river. == Miniseries == === Main cast === * Sigrid Thornton \u2013 Philadelphia Gordon * John Waters \u2013 Brenton Edwards * Charles Tingwell \u2013 Uncle Charles * Nicholas Brown \u2013 Gordon * Dinah Shearing \u2013 Aunt Hester * Adrian Wright \u2013 Alistair Raeburn * Diane Craig \u2013 Miss Barrett * Gus Mercurio \u2013 Tom Gritchley * John Alansu \u2013 Ah Lee * William Upjohn \u2013 Adam * Frank Gallacher \u2013 Mac * Constance Landsberg \u2013 Bessie Griggs * Darius Perkins \u2013 Ben * Caroline Gillmer \u2013 Mabel Blackeney * Kirk Alexander \u2013 Jim * Celia de Burgh \u2013 Imogen * Chantal Contouri \u2013 Julia * Nick Waters \u2013 Mr. Slope * Carol Burns \u2013 Mrs. Slope * Vivean Gray \u2013 Alicia Raeburn * Betty Lucas \u2013 Janet Raeburn ===Production=== Both mini-series were shot on location in Echuca.Scott Murray, Australia on the Small Screen 1970-1995, Oxford Uni Press, 1996 p171 as well as locations in Melbourne.
