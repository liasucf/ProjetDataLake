    "text": "Ivan Malenica (born 21 July 1985) is a Croatian lawyer and politician who has been serving as Minister of Justice and Public Administration in the Government of Croatia since 24 July 2020. ==Early life and education== Malenica was born in \u0160ibenik on 21 July 1985, where he attended elementary and high school. He graduated from the Split Faculty of Law in 2008. In 2013 Malenica was a student at the postgraduate doctoral study of the Zagreb Faculty of Law in the direction of public law and administration. His family is originally from the village of Bri\u0161tani, one of the seven villages in the Miljevci area near Drni\u0161, in \u0160ibenik-Knin County. His father, Ante, was a long-time director of Ceste \u0160ibenik d.o.o., and his uncle, Frane, is one of the founders of the Croatian People's Party's \u0160ibenik branch and current director of the Vodovod i odvodnja d.o.o., a water supply company and drainage. == Political career == In 2016 Malenica became a candidate of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) for the State Secretary in the Ministry of Public Administration in the period when Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 came to power, but Josipa Rimac took over the role. In 2018, after the election of the HDZ's \u0160ibenik-Knin County branch, he became president of the HDZ board of governors. He was also in charge of advising Prime Minister Plenkovi\u0107 on issues related to the public administration, then received the unanimous support of the party president and the party's national council. After a series of real estate affairs, Lovro Ku\u0161\u010devi\u0107 resigned as the Minister of Public Administration, whereupon on 17 July 2019, Plenkovi\u0107 appointed Malenica for the Ku\u0161\u010devi\u0107's successor. He stressed on that occasion that he will do everything to make the public administration serve the citizens and that they will realize their rights and particular interests as soon as possible and with as little financial resources as possible. A very important project and means that will enable all this to be considered digitalization of public administration. On 21 July 2020, on his 35th birthday, Malenica tested positive for COVID-19 disease, which is why he could not be sworn in as the Minister of Justice and Public Administration on 23 July in the Parliament, but did so a day later via video call. == See also == * Cabinet of Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 I * Cabinet of Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 II ==References== Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Croatian Democratic Union politicians Category:Croatian lawyers Category:Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb alumni Category:Government ministers of Croatia Category:People from \u0160ibenik Category:University of Split alumni ",
