In 2010, his most recent season as a driver, Smith ran part-time in the same series. ==Racing career== Smith started racing at the age of five on dirtbikes, by the age of 12 he was racing BMX bicycles, where he was crowned State Champion in his first year. At the age of 14, Smith began racing go-karts in the Nite Series at Poughkeepsie Speedway in New York proving himself in his first year by finishing in second place in both series' championships. In his second year of competition, Smith moved to Stock Light division, Poughkeepsie Speedway's most competitive go-karting class, where he took home the championship. In 2001, Smith decided to take a break from racing to focus on high school. When he returned to racing the spring of 2006, he entered into automobile racing in the Dodge Weekly Series driving a late-model in the NASCAR sanctioned division. In his rookie season, with the help of Ryan Posocco Racing, Smith's team ran at Stafford Motor Speedway in Stafford Springs, Connecticut and finished in the top third of the championship race, and as the runner up in the Rookie of the Year competition. Smith's talent did not go unnoticed, and he was selected to participate in the NASCAR Drive for Diversity program where he was placed with veteran Barney McRae and Motion Racing in 2007. During this season, Smith debuted in the NASCAR Busch East Series, NASCAR's top developmental racing series. Smith finished the year 16th in the point standings, scoring a top 5 finish in only his second series race. In 2008, Smith joined Troy Williams Racing with Sean Watts to pilot their No. 21 Aqua Pure Health/Raintree Vacations Dodge in the newly named Camping World Series East (formerly Busch East, currently K&N; Pro Series). He also drove in the NASCAR Drive for Diversity program for a second season that year.NASCAR Announces Drive For Diversity Class for 2008 | NASCAR Home Tracks In the 2009 season, Smith was brought on by two time series champion Mike Olson and Fadden Racing.
