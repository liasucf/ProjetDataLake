Promotion in the Bailiwick of Guernsey being undertaken by La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Guernesiaise, Guernsey Museums, the Alderney Society with World War II work also undertaken by Festung Guernsey. Archaeologists in each island give regular talks on their work and summer digs in the islands usually require helpers and volunteers. Interest in the archaeology of the islands is first recorded in the 16th century. By the 18th century articles were being published in magazines with engravings explaining interesting historic sites. La Hougue Bie entrance and chapel, Jersey ==Bailiwick of Jersey== The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jersiaise was founded in 1873. Over the years the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jersiaise has purchased archaeological sites for preservation and presentation, the two most important sites are La Hougue Bie, purchased in 1919, and La Cotte de Saint- Br\u00e9lade, purchased in 1955. The Museum, founded in 1893 by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jersiaise and its extensive Museum collections are now looked after by Jersey Heritage. Jersey Heritage, founded in 1981, is a local charity that protects and promotes the Island\u2019s rich heritage and cultural environment. Planning permissions may include a requirement for archaeological monitoring and/or works. In 2014, 24 planning permissions included this requirement. Jersey Heritage reach out to engage the public, for example in 2014, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jersiaise held a programme of archaeological events as part of the nationwide Council for British Archaeology Festival. ==Bailiwick of Guernsey== Guernsey Museums holds a wide range of archaeological collections. The Museums also holds important collections of antiquarian finds, dominated by 250 prehistoric stone tools, mostly gathered together by the Lukis family mainly in the 1830s and 1840s. Guernsey employs a States Archaeologist who undertakes excavations or who approves visiting archaeologists. Long term projects have included: * Herm. Island of the dead? The buried Neolithic landscape of Herm being undertaken by Durham University * Stepping stones to the Neolithic? Islands, maritime connectivity and the 'western seaways' of Britain, 5,000-3,500 BC by the Universities of Reading, Southampton and Liverpool. * Alderney Nunnery, undertaken by Guernsey Museums Maritime archaeology is similarly regulated and protected by laws, with displays at the Shipwreck Museum at Fort Grey and the Maritime Museum at Castle Cornet The \u201cGuernsey Sites and Monument Record\u201d is compiled and maintained by the Archaeology Officer. It is a register of known archaeological sites and find spots within the Bailiwick of Guernsey, including Ancient Monuments. Sections of early archaeological evidence on Alderney has sadly been destroyed, firstly during the Victorian era of quarrying and building fortifications and later by the German occupiers repeating the process. However the Alderney Society is thriving and has an excellent museum. ==Sea level changes in the Channel Islands== Understanding the changes to the sea level is vital when considering the early archaeology of the islands. The islands were never covered in ice, but suffered early erosion from rivers such as the Seine and Ay. Over the last million years sea levels have changed significantly. 800,000 years ago sea levels were likely to have been 35m higher than now. This fell gradually, with the formation of ice elsewhere and the land rising, to 30m higher than now around 400,000 years ago to 21m 300,000 years ago, to 13m 200,000 years ago to 2m 120,000 years ago, when it was thought a catastrophic outburst flood permanently diverted the Rhine into the English Channel. Sea levels continued to fall, but more rapidly over the next 100,000 years. Looking at the last 20,000 years, which started with a glacial period, the sea level was around 100m lower than now, making the sea coast some 120 km west of the islands. There followed a dramatic rise, by 9,400 BC the sea had risen to come close to where it now lies, but with the islands still connected to mainland France. The separation of Alderney probably occurred first, the Guernsey/Sark landmass occurred around 9,200 BC with the Bailiwick of Guernsey becoming separate islands of Guernsey, Sark and Herm around 5,000 BC. Jersey being finally separated from the French coast about 1,000 years later, although there are traditions that a land bridge between Jersey and France lasted until finally broken in a storm or series of storms in 709 AD, the same storm separating Herm from Jethou. The islands contain raised beaches including one 8-9m above current heights from about 130,000 years ago and evidence of a forest (in Vazon Bay, Guernsey) below the current sea levels. There are very high tides and swift currents in the Mont Saint-Michel Bay which caused additional erosion between Jersey and the French coast. ==Buildings, key archaeology sites and evidence from various periods== ===Palaeolithic period=== Cave at La Cotte de St Brelade Whilst connected to mainland Europe. * La Cotte de St Brelade, Jersey. First investigated in 1904. The Site was first occupied by humans in the Middle Paleolithic, 240,000 years ago based on thermoluminescence dating, during a cold glacial period when most of the present seabed would have been uncovered. Dated at approximately 180,000 BP, two impressive piles of animal bones, of mammoths and woolly rhinoceros, are located beneath an overhang having being butchered. * La Cotte \u00e0 la Ch\u00e8vre is a small cave in Jersey. Flints and a hand axe have been found here, also indicating Neanderthal occupation. ===Ice Age period=== 14,000 BC \u2013 12,000 BC whilst connected to mainland Europe following extinction of Neanderthals. * Over 3,000 stone tools and Ice Age engravings dating from at least 12,000 BC have been found at Les Varines site in south east Jersey, showing occupation by Homo sapiens. ===Mesolithic period=== 12,000 BC to 4,500 BC when rising sea levels created the islands. * La Cotte de St Brelade was also found to have had more recent human occupants, flint and stone tools, animal bones and hearths have been found in the cave. * On Jethou evidence of flint manufacturing in an area exposed only at low water between the island and Crevichon shows occupation around 10,000 BC. * There is evidence on Little Sark of human farming dating from around 5,000 BC. * A number of sites show evidence of Mesolithic communities including Lihou and the Royal Hotel site in Guernsey and Les Landes, Jersey. ===Neolithic period=== 4,500 BC \u20131,800 BC The archaeological community debate whether the Neolithic Revolution was brought to the British Isles through adoption by natives, or by migrating groups of continental Europeans who settled there, however evidence of a farming lifestyle exists in Guernsey from the start of the Neolithic period, a thousand years earlier than on mainland Britain. Sites excavated include: ====Jersey==== * La Hougue Bie, Jersey. Excavated in 1924. Neolithic ritual site which was in use around 3,500 BC comprising an passage chamber covered by a earth mound.

Previous maps tended to only show main roads and navigation marks such as fortifications, windmills and churches. * Many defensive works were created in the 1750-1815 era because of the threat of invasion from France. Conway's towers in Jersey and Guernsey loophole towers were followed with signal stations, gun batteries, magazines and Martello towers. Most of these structures still exist and are protected. * Victorian fortifications and a breakwater in Alderney were built between 1850 and 1870. * Lager Sylt labour camp and Lager Norderney in Alderney dating from 1942 have been searched with ground radar and to recover any deteriorating archaeological evidence. * The excavating and preserving of material and the restoration of a number of World War II military structures in Jersey and Guernsey have been undertaken by the Channel Islands Occupation Society and Festung Guernsey which include: ** Battery Lothringen, Jersey ** Battery Moltke, Jersey ** Sechsschartenturm Heavy MG bunker, Jersey ** Fort Hommet Casement, Guernsey * Archives of documents are now maintained in all the islands by their governments. * Both Jersey and Guernsey are producing 3D digital maps of their islands. ==Museums== ===Jersey=== * Jersey Museum and Art Gallery * Jersey Archive * La Hougue Bie * Maritime Museum * Mont Orgueil ===Guernsey=== * Guernsey Museum at Candie * Fort Grey * Castle Cornet * Guernsey Occupation Museum * Island Archives ===Alderney=== * Alderney Society Museum ===Sark=== * Occupation Museum ==External links== * Herm.
