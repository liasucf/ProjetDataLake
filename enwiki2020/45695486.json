    "text": "The Sonata in E-flat major (Hob. XVI/38, L. 51) is a keyboard sonata composed by Joseph Haydn. It is also referred to as a piano sonata. The three-movement work was published by Artaria in 1780 in a set of six sonatas dedicated to the sisters Katharina and Marianna Auenbrugger. The sonata has three movements: #Allegro moderato (E-flat major) #Adagio (C minor) #Finale: Allegro (E-flat major) The first movement is in sonata form. It is monothematic, in that the movement only presents and significantly develops one distinct theme. The second movement is a siciliana. The third is in da capo form, akin to a minuet and trio. The two movements are linked by an attacca direction: the second movement has an open ending on a G-major chord; the third movement follows immediately, and that chord becomes the submediant triad (with raised third) of the new movement's key of E-flat major. ==References== == External links == *Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) - Sonate in Es-Dur, Hob XVI:38 * Category:Piano sonatas by Joseph Haydn Category:Compositions in E-flat major ",
