Based in Tel Aviv, the duo's eclectic sound range is influenced by many genres, including disco, house, garage rock, post punk, psychedelic rock and techno. == History == Arzi and Sadovnik met and began writing songs together when they were 14. Three years later, they formed Red Cotton, a four-member psychedelic rock band that included Udi Naor and Yovav, Arzi's brother. The year after releasing their debut album, 2006's memory card, the band made plans to go to London but only managed to reach Amsterdam. After four months the Red Cotton band broke up, with Arzi and Sadovnik electing to remain in Amsterdam, and tour Europe, broadening their musical experience and repertoire. After spending some time living in Amsterdam and touring Europe, the two Dj/Producers with Naor as the head producer started a rave party brand in Tel Aviv called \"Break It!\". The first Red Axes EP was released in 2010. During the following years, Red Axes went on to release on a variety of labels including Crosstown Rebels, Hivern Discs, Permanent Vacation, Correspondent, Life and Death, Dark Entries, Multi Culti, and I'm a Cliche. Red Axes' first full-length album, Ballad of the Ice, appeared under the I'm a Clich\u00e9 label in 2014. The vocal- and guitar-heavy album included additional collaborations with Abr\u00e3o as well as a cover of Bauhaus '\"Bela Lugosi's Dead.\" Following the release of the Ballad of Ice\" album, the duo initiated a worldwide tour, gaining international recognition both on the dance floors and in the music charts worldwide. In 2016, the duo launched their own record label named Garzen Records, releasing records such as: The White Screen, Abrao, Deaf Chonky, The Crotches, Siam and their own latest album \"The Beach Goths\". Beach Goths was produced in their studio in collaboration with the extended Garzen family \u2013 Abr\u00e3o, Eylonzo Crotch, Gabriel Broid, Adi Bronicki, Thomas Jacksonn & I\u00f1igo Vontier were all featured in the 12 track album with the stated intention of creating a \"new psychedelic cosmic adventure\" for fans. The end result has been described as \"innovative in the simplicity with which it talks to the soul of the listener as well as in the assortment of music references that every single track contains. The Beach Goths consists of 12 tracks that can be viewed as paths; none of them is restricted to a specific interpretation though, what is clearly defined is the element that brings them together \u2013 an invitation to approach music in the most natural way, in the awareness that every listening experience conceals a purely and exclusively subjective interpretation.\" Over 2016, they went on to produce \"Kill The DJ\", characterized by dark, new wave flavors, and had two releases on Multi Culti (including remixes of 'Waiting for a Surprise'). They issued three collaborations with Moscoman: \u2018Dikembe Manutu\u2019, amore Middle Eastern-flavored \u2018Subaru Pesha\u2019 and a remix of \u2018Fernandez\u2019, characterized by its unexpected tangents and a trippy EP for Endless Flight. It was their \u2018Sun My Sweet Sun\u2019 that \"perhaps drew most attention with its bells, chimes and simple but highly memorable flute melody\". In 2016 they established their own festival, called: \u201cGarzen Festival\" and curated party nights around the world. Red Axes have various performing acts either as Dj's, live electronic duo, or as a Live band called \"Red Axes 4\". International appearance venuses of Red Axes have included: Sonar, Burning Man, Coachella, Berghein/Panorama Bar, Glastonbury, Dekmantel, DGTL, Field Day, Pacha Ibiza, Fusion, Nachtdigital, FYF, Convenanza, ADE, Beats in space In 2016, the duo initiated the \"Red Axes around the world\" project in Africa, in which they travel to remote locations, performing recordings and workshops with local musicians and students. These activities are being compiled into a serial documentary, the first episode having been filmed in Ethiopia and the Ivory Coast. == Awards == * 2016 \u2013 The \"ACUM\" Prize (Israeli copyrights association) for exceptional achievements in electronic music * 2016 \u2013 No. 35 on Resident Advisor \u2013 Top 100 Live Acts of 2016 * 2016 \u2013 No. 26 \u2013 Sun my sweet sun \u2013 Resident Advisor \u2013 Top 50 Tracks of 2016 * 2016 \u2013 No. 7 on the Beatport Top 10 Indie dance \u2013 Nu Disco Artists of 2016 * 3 tracks in the 10 best selling tracks on Beatport * Releases on: Correspondent, Hivern Discs, Permanent Vacation, Multi Culti which are 4 out of 10 best selling labels by Beatport * 2016 \u2013 Xlr8r \u2013 Most Downloaded Track * 2016 \u2013 Subaru Pesha * 2017: 9th place \u2013 Best Dj Mix Time out new york. * 2017 \u2013 Walla Nightlife Awards- Best Dj/Producer == Discography == === Albums === {| class=\"wikitable\" |Name |Label |Year released |- |Ballad of the Ice |I'm A Clich\u00e9 |2014 |- |The Beach Goths |Garzen Records |2017 |- |} === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable\" |Name |Label |Year released |- |Bela (12\", EP) |Klasse Recordings |2011 |- |Tour De Chile (5xFile, MP3, EP, 320) |I'm A Clich\u00e9 |2012 |- |Red Axes Featuring Abr\u00e3o \u2013 Caminho De Dreyfus (12\") |Correspondant |2013 |- |Kicks Out of You (12\") |I'm A Clich\u00e9 |2014 |- |Shem Vol. 2 2 versions |I'm A Clich\u00e9 |2015 |- |Waiting for a Surprise |Multi Culti |2015 |- |Sabor Feat.
