Combat Press ranked him as the #10 flyweight in the world for June 2020, and #9 in August 2020. ==Mixed martial arts career== ===Shooto=== Hiromasa Ougikubo began his mixed martial arts career in 2005, as an amateur in Shooto. He first competed in the East Japan Amateur Shooto Freshman tournament, where he lost the finals. Following that loss he entered and won the 4th Tohoku Amateur Shooto Open Tournament. His last amateur appearance was at the 12th All Japan Amateur Shooto Featherweight Championship Tournament. Ougikubo defeated all four of his opponents to win the tournament. Ougikubo made his professional debut with Shooto in 2006, when he defeated Nobuhiro Hayakawa by a unanimous decision. After a draw against Naoki Yahagi, Ougikubo would beat Satoru Ota and Kazuya Tamura to set up a fight in the Shooto Rookie Featherweight tournament finals fight against Yasuhiro Kanayama. He won the bout in the second round by way of a rear naked choke. Over the next five years, Ougikubo would accumulate a 5-2-1 record, most notably losing to the future Shooto Featherweight Champion Koetsu Okazaki, and winning the Shooto Pacific Rim featherweight title by defeating Teriyuki Matsumoto. In 2012, at Shooto 5th Round, Ougikubo would get a chance to avenge that loss. Hiromasa would win the fight in the third minute of the third round, by way of a rear naked choke, in what was considered, at the time, a major upset.. His first title defense was scheduled against the young prospect Kyoji Horiguchi. Horiguchi would defend or reverse the takedowns, deliver ground and pound from the guard, and would eventually submit Ougikubo in the second round. Looking to bounce back, Ougikubo entered the 2014 Vale Tudo Japan Flyweight tournament. In the quarterfinals he defeated Takeshi Kasugai by a majority decision. In the semifinals he submitted Kana Hyatt in the first round. Proceeding to the finals against Czar Sklavos, Ougikubo came out the victor after 25 minutes, being declared the tournament champion, by a clear unanimous decision. Returning to Shooto he was scheduled to face Mamoru Yamaguchi. The fight had to cancelled, after Ougikubo dislocated his shoulder. His next fight was scheduled against Yosuke Saruta, which he won by a unanimous decision. This gave him his second chance at Shooto gold, as he was set to fight the bantamweight champion Masaaki Sugawara. He won the fight in the last seconds of the fifth round by a guillotine choke. ===The Ultimate Fighter=== Considered a standout fighter in the Asian MMA scene, with an impressive fight style and being undefeated in three years, Ougikubo was invited to the 24th season of The Ultimate Fighter, called The Ultimate Fighter: Tournament of Champions. His first fight was against the EFC flyweight champion Nkazimulo Zulu. Ougikubo entered the fight as a favorite, being the no.5 seed, while Zulu was the no.12 seed. Ougikubo submitted Zulu in the second round, with a rear naked choke. Next, he faced Adam Antolin, in a fight between two high level grapplers. Ougikubo would aggressively out grapple Antolin, with the American being forced to defend for the entirety of the fight. The Japanese fighter won a clear unanimous decision. Ougikubo would then face the no.1 seed Alexandre Pantoja. He would force wrestling exchanges with Pantoja, working from his opponents guard, grinding away a unanimous decision win. In his final fight of the show, Ougikubo fought against Tim Elliott. He fell short for the first time, and lost the finals by a unanimous decision. ===Return to Shooto=== Returning to Shooto he fought against the Ultimate Fighting Championship veteran Danny Martinez. Ougikubo won a unanimous decision. He would then defend the Shooto World Bantamweight (123 lb) Championship against Tadaaki Yamamoto. He won the fight with a rear naked choke to defend his Shooto title. ===Rizin Fighting Federation=== Ougikubo signed with Rizin and made his debut at Rizin 11, when he was scheduled to rematch Kyoji Horiguchi. Horiguchi once again won, this time through a unanimous decision. Ougikubo fought the former Shooto and ONE Championship champion Yoshitaka Naito in a Shooto exhibition bout. The fight ended in a no contest after just three minutes. Making his second bantamweight title defense, Ougikubo faced Kiyotaka Shimizu. While the fight saw little action in the first three rounds, Ougikubo managed to cut his opponent with a head kick. In the fourth round a head clash ended the fight prematurely and went to the judge's scorecards. Hiromasa won a unanimous decision to secure his second title defense. Returning to Rizin, he fought against the former DEEP champion Yuki Motoya. Ougikubo won a split decision. During Rizin 20, he fought against Shintaro Ishiwatari. He won another split decision. He fought against Kai Asakura for the Rizin Bantamweight Championship at Rizin 23. He lost via first-round knockout. Ougikubo is scheduled to fight Kenta Takizawa during Rizin 25. ==Championships and accomplishments== ===Amateur titles=== *Shooto **12th All Japan Amateur Shooto Featherweight Tournament Championship **4th Tohoku Amateur Shooto Open Tournament ===Professional titles=== *Shooto **2007 Shooto Rookie Featherweight Tournament Champion **Shooto Pacific Rim Featherweight Championship (One time) **Shooto Featherweight (132 lb) Championship (One time) **Shooto World Bantamweight (123 lb) Championship (One time) ***Two Successful Title Defenses *Vale Tudo Japan **2014 VTJ Flyweight Tournament Championship ==Mixed martial arts record== |Loss |align=center|20\u20135\u20132 |Kai Asakura |KO (knee and soccer kicks) |Rizin 23 | |align=center|1 |align=center|4:31 |Yokohama, Japan | |- |Win |align=center|20\u20134\u20132 |Shintaro Ishiwatari |Decision (Split) |Rizin 20 | |align=center|3 |align=center|5:00 |Saitama, Japan | |- |Win |align=center|19\u20134\u20132 |Yuki Motoya |Decision (Split) |Rizin 17 | |align=center|3 |align=center|5:00 |Saitama, Japan | |- |Win |align=center|18\u20134\u20132 |Kiyotaka Shimizu |Technical Decision (Unanimous) |Shooto 30th Anniversary Tour at Korakuen Hall | |align=center|4 |align=center|0:40 |Tokyo, Japan | |- |Loss |align=center|17\u20134\u20132 |Kyoji Horiguchi |Decision (Unanimous) |Rizin 11 | |align=center|2 |align=center|5:00 |Saitama, Japan | |- |Win |align=center|17\u20133\u20132 |Tadaaki Yamamoto |Submission (Rear-Naked Choke) |Professional Shooto 10/15 | |align=center|1 |align=center|4:26 |Chiba, Japan | |- |Win |align=center|16\u20133\u20132 |Danny Martinez |Decision (Unanimous) |Professional Shooto 4/23 | |align=center|3 |align=center|5:00 |Chiba, Japan | |- |Win |align=center|15\u20133\u20132 |Masaaki Sugawara |Technical Submission (Guillotine Choke) |Mobstyles Presents Fight & Mosh | |align=center|5 |align=center|4:48 |Chiba, Japan | |- |Win |align=center|14\u20133\u20132 |Yosuke Saruta |Decision (Unanimous) |Professional Shooto 11/29 | |align=center|3 |align=center|5:00 |Chiba, Japan | |- |Win |align=center|13\u20133\u20132 |Czar Sklavos |Decision (Unanimous) |VTJ 6th | |align=center|5 |align=center|5:00 |Tokyo, Japan | |- |Win |align=center|12\u20133\u20132 |Kana Hyatt |Submission (Rear-Naked Choke) |VTJ 5th in Osaka | |align=center|1 |align=center|1:20 |Osaka, Japan | |- |Win |align=center|11\u20133\u20132 |Takeshi Kasugai |Decision (Majority) |VTJ 4th | |align=center|3 |align=center|5:00 |Tokyo, Japan | |- |Loss |align=center|10\u20133\u20132 |Kyoji Horiguchi |Submission (Rear-Naked Choke) |Shooto -
