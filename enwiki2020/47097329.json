The only remains of the abbey are the gatehouse and the attached range at the main entrance, the farm buildings and the mill, once powered by the Samson brook, which crosses the site. == History == Grandpr\u00e9 Abbey 1604 The abbey was founded in 1231 as a daughter house of Villers-la- Ville Abbey, of the filiation of Clairvaux, on a site where a grange of Villers-la-Ville had stood since the early 13th century, by Henry I, Count of Vianden and Marquis of Namur, and his wife Margaret de Courtenay Du Fays, Dominique - La Maison de Vianden; des origines \u00e0 1337, Diplomarbeit L\u00fcttich 1986\u20131987. in memory of her brother Philip II, Marquis of Namur, who had died in 1226 during the Albigensian Crusade. The church was dedicated in 1232. Grandpr\u00e9 was a small community and never thrived or achieved prominence. The number of monks was never more than 20, even though the abbey had a dozen farms in the environs. Nor did Grandpr\u00e9 found any daughter houses. Some restoration work took place in the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1740 the abbey was plundered by Dutch troops. At the end of the 18th century the farm buildings were rebuilt.Blouard, 1954 In 1796, the abbey was suppressed and sold as national property to Jean-Baptiste Paul\u00e9e, a financier from Paris and Douai. The conventual buildings had been demolished by 1807. In 1992 and 1997, the fa\u00e7ade and roof of the mill and a subterranean channel were declared protected monuments, as had happened to the gatehouse in 1956. == Present day == Abbey gatehouse The remaining buildings, which are Baroque and Rococo in style, have been restored and are privately maintained. The abbey is now in private ownership and the buildings are not open to the public, but the gardens are accessible on demand, for a minimal contribution to the proprietor for his or her charitable purposes. == Architectural heritage == Of the extensive abbey buildings burnt and looted in the French Revolution there remains only the extraordinary gatehouse restored in 1771 under Abbot \u00c9tienne Defrenne and registered in 1956 by the Commission royale des monuments et des sites.Joseph Delmelle, 1973: Abbayes et b\u00e9guinages en Belgique, p. 67.
