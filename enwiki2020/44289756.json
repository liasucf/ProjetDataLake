The 1915 College Football All-Southern Team consists of American football players selected to the College Football All-Southern Teams selected by various organizations in 1915. Josh Cody and Baby Taylor were selected third-team All-Americans by Walter Camp, and Bully Van de Graaff was selected for his second-team. Van de Graaff was Alabama's first ever All- American. Buck Mayer of the 8-1 Virginia Cavaliers was the south's first consensus All-American, selected first-team All-American by Frank G. Menke and Parke H. Davis. The \"point-a-minute\" Vanderbilt Commodores won the SIAA. ==Composite eleven== Bully Van de Graaff. The composite All-Southern team selected by ten sports writers and coaches included: *Josh Cody, tackle for Vanderbilt, inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1970, only three-time All-American in Vanderbilt football history. Third-team Camp All- American. He was selected for the Associated Press Southeast Area All-Time football team 1869-1919 era. Later a prominent football coach at many institutions. *Rabbit Curry, quarterback for Vanderbilt, unanimous selection. During the First World War, he was killed in aerial combat over France. He was a beloved player of Coach McGugin, described by one writer as \"the player who has most appealed to the imagination, admiration, and affection of the entire university community through the years.\" *Russ Cohen, end for Vanderbilt, later an assistant under Wallace Wade at Alabama and head coach at LSU and Cincinnati. *Wooch Fielder, halfback for Georgia Tech, later an influential veteran of the Second World War. *John G. Henderson, center for Georgia, the head of a group of three men, one behind the other with his hands upon the shoulders of the one in front, to counter Georgia Tech's jump shift offense utilized by John Heisman. The game ended 0-0\\. He also played baseball and was later Georgia baseball coach. *Bob Lang, guard for Georgia Tech, the first guard selected for the Heisman era All-Era Tech football team. *Walter Neville, fullback for Georgia, made All-Southern in his first year on the varsity. *David Paddock, quarterback for Georgia, the only player in school history to have a petition circulated by the student body requesting that he play for the Bulldogs. *Baby Taylor, guard for Auburn, unanimous selection. Weighing just under 200 pounds, Taylor would be a small player today, but he was then considered quite large, \"worth three ordinary men.\" Miss Virginia Gilmer, an Auburn fan of some 13 years of age once told Taylor that \u201cif she were a boy and as big as he and had any sense at all she would be an all- southern tackle.\u201d Third-team Camp All-American *Charlie Thompson, end for Georgia, captain-elect but ruled ineligible for next year. *Bully Van de Graaff, tackle for Alabama, unanimous selection. He was selected for the Associated Press Southeast Area All-Time football team 1869-1919 era.
