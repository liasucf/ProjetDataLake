In October 2019, the company acquired the London modeling agency, Select Model Management, and announced a major global expansion driven through an integration with Silva International Investment's existing modelling agency network, MP Management. Following MP Management's establishment in 2008 in Milan, the company acquired a second agency in Miami in 2014, quickly followed with the acquisition of a third agency, Major Paris, in 2015. Under the ownership of Silva International Investments, the group continued to grow, with the acquisition of Elite Stockholm in 2017, and in the same year, with the establishment of a strategic partnership with Modellink in Gothenburg. This was followed in 2018 with the acquisition of the Factor Chosen Group, which brought into the network agencies in Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta. With the acquisition of Select, the network expanded to London, with the group now spanning eight agencies. == Miami FC == In May 2015, Riccardo Silva co- established Miami FC, which played in the North American Soccer League (NASL). During their time competing in the NASL, Miami FC captured the 2017 spring NASL title with a 7-0 win over the San Francisco Deltas, and in October of that year, the club completed an historic double, becoming the first team in NASL history to win both the Spring and Autumn titles in the same season. In an interview with El Nuevo Herald Riccardo Silva stated that \"The fact that we won the Spring and Autumn tournaments does not mean there are not more things that we have to fight for\". In June 2017, Miami FC played their first competitive fixture against an MLS club, beating Orlando City SC 3-1 in the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup with Stefano Pinho scoring a hat-trick. The Telegraph reported Riccardo Silva saying: \u201cIt was the biggest game in our short history so to win so convincingly against a fantastic club like Orlando City was a great result for us\". Miami FC 2 were crowned 2018 NPSL National Champions in August 2018, defeating FC Motown (Morristown, NJ) 3-1 at Drew University\u2019s Ranger Stadium. In July 2019, Miami FC won its sixth overall trophy, adding the NPSL Sunshine Conference to their list of honors, defeating Miami United FC 3-2 in the final.

It was subsequently announced that the stadium would be renamed Riccardo Silva Stadium for five years in recognition of his involvement. == Other Footballing Interests == Ronaldo and Alessandro Nesta Silva was involved in the project to establish the Americas Champions League (ACL) tournament, which would involve teams from North America, South America and the Caribbean and was intended to become the all-Americas version of Europe\u2019s popular UEFA Champions League. The intention was for a 64-team competition to mirror the UEFA Champions League's format, which Silva estimated could generate $500 million in television and marketing rights - quintupling the current annual take-ins for the CONCACAF Champions League and CONMEBOL's Copa Libertadores combined. The plans to develop the ACL have been described as \u2018a vehicle to help place the country at the forefront of game\u2019, a goal which Silva believes can be achieved. In 2016, Silva's company, Silva International Investments, commissioned a report by Deloitte, on promotion and relegation in United States professional soccer. The report, published in November 2016, found that promotion and relegation could assist US club soccer in capitalising on the potential for the sport in USA, but also stated it's still too early to consider such a system in the U.S. until some important questions are answered. In August 2017, Miami FC joined forces with the National Premier Soccer League's Kingston Stockade FC in filing a request for arbitration at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). == Other business interests == Silva has other business interests in technology, fashion, and arts, including investments in technology company Muzik.
