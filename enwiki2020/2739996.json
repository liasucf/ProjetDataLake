    "text": "Seppo Henrik R\u00e4ty (born 27 April 1962) is a retired Finnish track and field athlete who competed in the javelin throw. He was a World Champion, having won gold in 1987. He was also an Olympic medalist (silver in 1992, bronze in 1988 and 1996). He was nicknamed Tohmaj\u00e4rven karhu (\"The Bear of Tohmaj\u00e4rvi\") and Tohmaj\u00e4rven tykki (\"The Cannon of Tohmaj\u00e4rvi\"). His personal best throw of 96.96 m, set in 1991, was one of his two world records with the \"new javelin\" at the time, however this throw was made using a \"Nemeth\" javelin that was banned by the IAAF later that year. All records made using this javelin were retrospectively deleted as from 20.9.1991 but remain ratified world records recognised by the IAAF. His best throw with the current javelin is 90.60 m, achieved in 1992. While in the process of winning the 1987 World Championships, R\u00e4ty was the subject of an often repeated video of failure. R\u00e4ty tripped on the runway, his javelin throw sticking in the runway about 30 cm short of the foul line. While an embarrassing throw for negative gain, in fact since he had not crossed the line it did not even count as a foul.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_Bm2C9ub-c After retiring, R\u00e4ty became a coach. He currently mentors another javelin thrower from Northern Karelia, Oona Sormunen. ==Seasonal bests by year== *1986 - 81.72 *1987 - 83.54 *1988 - 83.26 *1989 - 83.92 *1990 - 86.92 *1991 - 96.96 (modified javelin) *1992 - 90.60 *1993 - 85.68 *1994 - 85.22 *1995 - 87.68 *1996 - 86.98 *1997 - 82.22 *1998 - 75.14 *1999 - 79.47 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:People from Tohmaj\u00e4rvi Category:Sportspeople from Helsinki Category:Finnish male javelin throwers Category:Olympic athletes of Finland Category:Olympic silver medalists for Finland Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Finland Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for Finland Category:World Athletics Championships medalists Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Olympic bronze medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:World Athletics Championships winners ",
