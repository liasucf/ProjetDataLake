Thomas Fox of underground comix database Comixjoint gave Home Grown Funnies a 10/10 score, rating the writing as \"brilliant\" and the illustration as \"exceptional.\" Fox added that \"[t]he impressive longevity of Home Grown Funnies (16 printings and 160,000 copies sold in 30+ years) is a testament to the alluring power of Robert Crumb's 22-page epic love story, 'Whiteman Meets Bigfoot.' In this classic but unusually plotted (for Crumb) tragicomedy, a middle-class family man falls in love with a female Bigfoot in remote mountain territory and forsakes everything to fulfill his destiny with her.\" ==References== Category:1971 comics debuts Category:1971 comics endings Category:Underground comix Category:Comics by Robert Crumb Category:1971 in comics ",
