Co-founder and announcer Barry Grosser shaped the early content of the station, and remained as the General Manager for 25 years. Its former slogan was \"No Greed. No Ridicule. No Hurt.\". It broadcast from Morley for the first 21 years but, with the onset of digital radio broadcasting, needed to fund and build new premises. After 20 years, the station received its first round of government funding when it was awarded a $375,000 Federal Government grant to assist in making the digital broadcasting transition. Premises were built at the end of Murray Street in Como to house new digital broadcasting equipment, studios and the former confidential phone counselling service CareLine. The station moved to its new premises in Murray St, Como in 2009, selling off thousands of its vinyl records and CDs. 98five also broadcasts in Esperance, Katanning, Dalwallinu and in 2017 plan to broadcast to Busselton and Geographe Bay. Its current slogan is \"We\u2019re family\". == Funding == As a non-profit organisation, the government places restrictions on the stations\u2019 income potential and sponsorship support. It therefore relies on pledges, donations, subscriptions, and business sponsorship to continue. In 2015, its listeners raised funds for a $75,000 upgraded transmitter during a \u2018Hope for Christmas\u2019 appeal. After donors were given the chance to name the new equipment, it was nicknamed \u2018Hope\u2019. The station holds two annual fundraising appeals each year in June and November. In November 2016 it exceeded its $135,000 target over a five-day \u2018Dare to Imagine\u2019 appeal, broadcast from the Studio foyer with Perth public figures including the former Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett. == External links == * Category:Radio stations in Perth, Western Australia Category:Community radio stations in Australia Category:Christian radio stations in Australia ",
