Unlike other fumetti neri of the era, Mister-X had very little violent content, with the titular character being a gentleman thief similar to Ars\u00e8ne Lupin. In the film, the titular character Mister X visually differs from the comics design who had a black hood and leotard opposed to the red cape, white boots and hood that covers his face that his comic book counterpart wears. Parts of the film were shot in Rome including location shooting at the Stadio dei Marmi. ==Release== Avenger X was released in Italy in 1967 as Mister X. The English-language title of the film ignores the characters name and is titled Avenger X. Director Piero Vivarelli stated most of the violent scenes in the film were removed from the Italian version of the film to earn a V.M.14 rating. Censors documents only suggested that 47 seconds of the film were cut in Italy This included scenes where a blowtorch approaches Mister-X's bare chest and a shot of a speedboat moving towards a reef. The film grossed 112 million Italian lire in Italy during its theatrical run. The film was distributed by Euro International. The film was released in Spain on 22 January 1968 where it sold 707,889 admissions. ==See also== * List of films based on comics * List of Italian films of 1967 * List of Spanish films of 1967 == References == ===Footnotes=== ===Sources=== * * ==External links== * Category:1967 films Category:Italian films Category:Spanish films Category:1960s crime films Category:Films based on Italian comics Category:Live-action films based on comics Category:Films shot in Rome Category:Films directed by Piero Vivarelli Category:Italian superhero films Category:1960s superhero films ",
