    "text": "Terracide is a zero-G first person shooter developed by Simis and published by Eidos Interactive in 1997. ==Gameplay== Terracide plays out in a six degrees of freedom style, much like Descent, in a similar way in which the player is mostly cruising around levels until they find an enemy to attack, although sometimes the player is given on-screen objectives which are required to be completed to continue. Mouse controls are disabled by default, although add- ons such as an on-screen crosshair or mouse control can be enabled in the game's menu. ==Reviews== Stephen Poole on CNET's Reviews section rates Terracide 3/5 as \"Good\", with its major flaws commented that Terracide is \"an unabashed Descent clone coupled with a tired \"save the earth from destruction by alien invaders\" story\", and its biggest issue was the control in which \"it was almost impossible to line up shots on a consistent basis because the ship wouldn't stop turning when I wanted it to\". Terracide is still rated as a decent 3D shooter by GameSpot, proudly ending the review commenting that if you can get along the delayed controls, the game is a definite buy. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 video games Category:Eidos Interactive games Category:Simis games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games with 6 degrees of freedom Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Zero-G shooters ",
