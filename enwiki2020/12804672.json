    "text": "The Naval Review was first published in February 1913 by a group of eight Royal Navy officers. They had formed a naval society \"to promote the advancement and spreading within the service of knowledge relevant to the higher aspects of the naval profession\" in 1912. The eight founders were *Captain Herbert Richmond *Commander Kenneth Dewar *Commander the Hon. Reginald Plunkett *Lieutenant Roger Bellairs *Lieutenant T. Fisher *Lieutenant Henry Thursfield *Captain Edward Harding *Admiral William Henderson (Honorary Editor) The Naval Review is the journal of professional record of the Royal Navy. The Royal Navy and Naval Review - an independent journal whose charitable purposes are to serve the interests of the Royal Navy - have enjoyed over a century of a unique relationship. In respecting this special relationship, and in acknowledgement of established MoD communications policy, the Naval Review is limited to membership by subscription only (ie not on sale, or routinely promulgated, to the wider public). But such agreement, is on the clear understanding that, to the benefit of both the Navy and the Review, that the Naval Review sustains its independent voice and continues to encourage \u2018reasonable challenge\u2019 to accepted policy amongst its members. For its part the Royal Navy values the Naval Review\u2019s central purpose to encourage serving officers to debate relevant professional matters in clear, concise and persuasive ways and develop the art of self-expression and professional knowledge and understanding to the longer-term benefit of the Service. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1913 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Quarterly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:English-language magazines Category:Magazines established in 1913 Category:Maritime history magazines Category:Military magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Royal Navy ",
