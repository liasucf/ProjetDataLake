Between 1920 and 1927 the Legislative Assembly was elected using a form of proportional representation with multi-member seats and a single transferable vote (modified Hare-Clark). There was confusion at the time as to the process to be used to fill the vacancy. In accordance with the practice prior to 1920, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly issued a writ of election requiring a by-election to be conducted, however the Chief Electoral Officer said he couldn't do so under then law at the time and that a by-election would be contrary to the principle of proportional representation. The vacancy was left unfilled until the Parliament passed the Parliamentary Elections (Casual Vacancies) Act on 10 December 1920,. so that casual vacancies were filled by the next unsuccessful candidate on the incumbent member's party list. Matthew Kilpatrick was the unsuccessful candidate at the 1920 election and took his seat on 15 December 1920. ====1920==== ===Elections in the 1910s=== ====1917 by-election==== ====1917==== ====1913==== ====1910==== ===Elections in the 1900s=== ====1907==== ====1904==== ====1901==== ===Elections in the 1890s=== ====1898==== ====1895==== ====1894==== ====1891==== ===Elections in the 1880s=== ====1889==== ====1887==== ====1885==== ====1882==== ====1880==== ===Elections in the 1870s=== ====1877==== ====1874-75==== ====1872 by- election==== ====1872==== ===Elections in the 1860s=== ====1869-70==== ====1864-65==== ====1860==== ===Elections in the 1850s=== ====1859==== ==Notes== ==References== Category:New South Wales state electoral results by district ",
