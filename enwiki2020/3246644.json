    "text": "Fattail scorpion or fat-tailed scorpion is the common name given to scorpions of the genus Androctonus, one of the most dangerous groups of scorpions species in the world.Hendrixson, B. E. 2006. Buthid scorpions of Saudi Arabia, with notes on other families (Scorpiones: Buthidae, Liochelidae, Scorpionidae). In W. B\u00fcttiker, F. Krupp, I. Nader & W. Schneider (eds.), Fauna of Arabia (pp. in press, ~100 pages). Basel, Switzerland: Karger Libri. They are found throughout the semi-arid and arid regions of the Middle East and Africa. They are a moderate sized scorpion, attaining lengths of 10 cm (just under 4 in). Their common name is derived from their distinctly fat metasoma, or tail, while the Latin name originates from Greek and means \"man killer\". Their venom contains powerful neurotoxins and is especially potent. Stings from Androctonus species are known to cause several human deaths each year. Several pharmaceutical companies manufacture an antivenom for treatment of Androctonus envenomations. == Geographic range == Androctonus is widespread in North and West Africa, the Middle East and eastwards to the Hindukush region. Countries where Androctonus species live include: Armenia, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Togo, Palestine, Israel, India, Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Bahrain and Pakistan. == Etymology == A rough English translation of the name Androctonus is \"man-killer\", from the Ancient Greek an\u1e17r, andr\u00f3s (\u1f00\u03bd\u03ae\u03c1, \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"man\" and kte\u00ednein (\u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), meaning \"to kill\". Crassicauda means fat-tailed, from the Latin crassus meaning \"thick\" or \"fat\" and cauda, meaning \"tail\". Androctonus crassicauda is widespread throughout the Middle East and its name means \"fat-tailed man- killer\". Similarly, the Latin word for South is australis, from which Androctonus australis, \"southern man-killer\", derives. == Taxonomy == Androctonus bicolor: The Black fat-tail; note the very slim pedipalps compared to Androctonus crassicauda Taxonomic reclassification is ongoing, sources tend to disagree on the number of species.

The fat-tailed scorpion's main diet when in captivity consists of cockroaches, grasshoppers, and crickets. Scorpions will generally try to kill and eat anything which moves and is smaller than themselves. To simulate the desert environment, the enclosure used to keep the scorpion in must be kept at a temperature of between . == References == == External links == *The Scorpion Files: Buthidae *Photo of Androctonus habitat in Kuwait *Treatment of Androctonus stings at eMedicine *Treatment of Androctonus stings Category:Buthidae Category:Scorpions of Africa ",
