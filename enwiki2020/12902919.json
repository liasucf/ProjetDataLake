It is native to Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay and is naturalised in Australia and South Africa. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and sandy shores. The species was first formally described in 1812 by botanist Adrian Haworth in Synopsis Plantarum Succulentarum. The name Opuntia vulgaris, which is a synonym of Opuntia ficus- indica, has been misapplied to this species in Australia. ==References== * * monacantha Category:Cacti of South America Category:Flora of Argentina Category:Flora of Brazil Category:Flora of Paraguay Category:Flora of Uruguay Category:Least concern plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
