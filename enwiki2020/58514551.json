    "text": "Onsen Musume (japanese: \u6e29\u6cc9\u3080\u3059\u3081) is a Japanese multimedia project by Enbound, Inc. The project's goal is to increase tourism to onsen (Japanese hot springs) by anthropomorphizing onsen as anime characters, and creating anime, manga, and video games about them. The project began in November 2016, and an animated music video by Doga Kobo was released on March 15, 2017. They also have live concerts and events with the characters' voice actresses. == Summary == Onsen Musume are minor goddesses who live in every onsen. During the day Onsen Musume go to school in Odaiba, Tokyo to learn how to help more people learn about each Musume's respective onsen, and also to learn special arts that help guests relax and smile. One day they receive a proclamation from Sunahiko, the god who rules over all of the onsen, commanding them to become idols. The Onsen Musume form idol groups in order to compete in the newly- created idol tournament. The main character of the series is Yuina Kusatsu, the Onsen Musume for Kusatsu Onsen. With eight other Onsen Musume, she forms an idol group called \"SPRiNGS\". In school the nine members are known as the \"weird ones\", but as idols they aim to become the best Onsen Musume idol group in Japan. == Characters == As of September 2018, there are 110 Onsen Musume representing onsen in Taiwan and all 47 prefectures of Japan. ; Urume Aria (\u6f64\u76ee\u30a2\u30ea\u30a2) : Voiced by Kikuko Inoue ; Sunahiko (\u30b9\u30af\u30ca\u30d2\u30b3) : Voiced by Nana Mizuki === SPRiNGS=== A group made of 9 of the \"weird students\" at the Onsen Musume School. ; Yuina Kusatsu (\u8349\u6d25\u7d50\u8863\u5948) : Voiced by Y\u016bki Takada : Image color is yellow; represents Kusatsu Onsen.
