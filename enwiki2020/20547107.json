It is serves the village of Blackridge, West Lothian, Scotland. == History == The original station in this locale was called Westcraigs built by the Bathgate and Coatbridge Railway. It was also the site of a junction with the Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway. Opened on 11 August 1862,Butt (1995), p. 245 in some timetables the station was called Westcraigs for Harthill. As part of the Beeching cuts, the station closed on 9 January 1956. ==Reopening== Blackridge was originally excluded from the Airdrie\u2013Bathgate rail link project, but after a three-year campaign by the local community, funding has been approved by the Scottish Government at a cost of \u00a35 million. Private housing developer Manorlane agreed to fund 40% of the costs. However, it closed and the funding promise expired. West Lothian Council agreed to take on the burden and expects to recoup the cost from additional expansion in the area. The station opened on 12 December 2010 on a new site, some 600 metres closer to Edinburgh than the previous Westcraigs station. ==Gallery== File:Blackcraigs railway station.JPG|Platform 2 on the day of opening File:Blackridge station sign.jpg|Bilingual station sign ==Services== The station has a basic half-hourly off-peak service Mondays to Sundays, westbound to , Queen St Low Level and and eastbound to Bathgate and Edinburgh Waverley.
