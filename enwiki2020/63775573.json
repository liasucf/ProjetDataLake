    "text": "PGC 13809 is a spiral, almost edge-on galaxy in the constellation Fornax. It was discovered by the European Southern Observatory and it is a member of the Fornax Cluster. PGC 13809 has a Hubble classification of Sc, indicating it is an unbarred spiral galaxy with loose spiral arms. It is also seen nearly edge- on, with an angle of about \u224880 degrees (\u224880\u00b0). Its size on the night sky is 4.8' x 0.8', indicating a real size of about 90,000 light-years, so PGC 13809 is slightly smaller than the Milky Way. It is also one of the larger galaxies in the Fornax Cluster, a cluster of 200 galaxies. Its magnitude is 12.6. With a redshift of 1838 km/s, it is one of the faster moving galaxies in the Fornax Cluster, but it is close to the central giant elliptical galaxy NGC 1399, so gravitational reaction is possible. == References == Category:Fornax Cluster Category:Spiral galaxies Category:Fornax (constellation) ",
