Tobruk may for instance end up connected to Ajdabiya instead of to the Jaghboub well field. The Great Man-Made River (GMMR, ) is a network of pipes that supplies fresh water obtained from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System fossil aquifer across Libya. It is the world's largest irrigation project.Guinness World Records 2008 Book. The project utilizes a pipeline system that pumps water from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System from down south in Libya to cities in the populous Libyan northern Mediterranean coast including Tripoli and Benghazi. The water covers a distance of up to 1,600 kilometers and provides 70% of all freshwater used in Libya. According to its website, it is the largest underground network of pipes ()Keys, D., 2011, Libya Tale of Two Fundamentally Different Cities, BBC Knowledge Asia Edition, Vol.3 Issue 7 and aqueducts in the world. It consists of more than 1,300 wells, most more than 500 m deep, and supplies 6,500,000 m3 of fresh water per day to the cities of Tripoli, Benghazi, Sirte and elsewhere. The late Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi described it as the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\".Water-Technology == History == Transport of pipe segments in the 1980s. Trench digging in the 1980s.

In 1953, efforts to find oil in southern Libya led to the discovery of large quantities of potable fossil water underground. The Great Man-made River Project (GMRP) was conceived in the late 1960s and work on the project began in 1984. The project's construction was divided into five phases. The first phase required 85 million m\u00b3 of excavation and was inaugurated on 28 August 1991. The second phase (dubbed First water to Tripoli) was inaugurated on 1 September 1996. The project is owned by the Great Man-Made River Project Authority and was funded by the Gaddafi government. The primary contractor for the first phases was Dong Ah Consortium and the present main contractor is Al Nahr Company Ltd. The imported goods were made in Korea and destined to the construction of the GMR arrived by sea via the entry port of Brega (Gulf of Sidra). Cathodic corrosion protection on the pipeline was supplied by an Australian company, AMAC Corrosion Protection, based in Melbourne and delivered via Port of Benghazi.Hands-on; AMAC's Purchasing Manager. The rest of goods were made in Libya. The total cost of the project is projected at more than US$25 billion. Libya has completed the work to date without the financial support of major countries or loans from world banks. Since 1990 UNESCO has provided training to engineers and technicians involved with the project. The fossil aquifer from which this water is being supplied is the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System. It accumulated during the last ice age and is not currently being replenished. If 2007 rates of retrieval are not increased, the water could last a thousand years.Article from Saudi Aramco January/February 2007UN Environment Program Independent estimates indicate that the aquifer could be depleted of water in as soon as 60 to 100 years.Libya's Qaddafi taps 'fossil water' to irrigate desert farms - CSMonitor.com Analysts say that the costs of the $25 billion groundwater extraction system are 10% those of desalination.Colonel Qaddafi and the Great Man-made River \u2013 Water Matters - State of the Planet In this project 1,000 million euros were invested for the installation of 50,000 artificial palm trees for water condensation. This project was carried out by the Spanish engineer Antonio Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Alba On 22 July during the 2011 Libyan civil war, one of the two plants making pipes for the project, the Brega Plant, was hit by a NATO air strike. At a press conference on 26 July, NATO claimed that rockets had been fired from within the plant area, and that military material, including multiple rocket launchers, was stored there according to intelligence findings, presenting a photo showing a BM-21 MRL as an example. Due to the ongoing civil war in Libya, the water infrastructure has suffered neglect and occasional breakdowns. As of July 2019, 101 of 479 wells on the western pipeline system had been dismantled.In battle for Libya's oil, water becomes a casualty. Reuters. 2019-07-02. On 10 April 2020, a station controlling water flow to Tripoli and neighboring towns was seized by an unknown armed group. The flow of water was cut to over two million people as a result, and as such the attack was condemned by the United Nations on humanitarian grounds. === Timeline === * 3 October 1983: The General People's Congress held an extraordinary session to draft the resolutions of the basic people's Congresses, which decided to fund and execute the Great Man-Made River Project. * 28 August 1984: Muammar Gaddafi laid the foundation stone in Sarir area for the commencement of the construction of the Great Man-Made River Project. * 28 August 1986: Muammar Gaddafi inaugurated the Brega plant for the production of the pre-stressed concrete cylinder pipes, which are considered the largest pipes made with pre-stressed steel wire (the majority of steel wire was made in Italy by the Redaelli Tecna S.p.A. company with its head office in Cologno Monzese-Milan and its factory in Caivano-Naples). The Sarir plant was also inaugurated on this date. * 26 August 1989: Muammar Gaddafi laid the foundation stone for phase two of the Great Man-Made River Project. === First water arrival === * 11 September 1989: to Ajdabiya reservoir. * 28 September 1989: to Grand Omar Muktar reservoir. * 4 September 1991: to Ghardabiya reservoir. * 28 August 1996: to Tripoli. * 28 September 2007: to Gharyan.
