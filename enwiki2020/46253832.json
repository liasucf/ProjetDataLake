    "text": "Ante Vuli\u0107 (; 16 August 1928 \u2013 7 August 1993) was a Croatian professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. ==Club career== He spent the entirety of his 11-year career with Hajduk Split, winning two Yugoslav league titles in 1952 and 1955. Although a talented goalkeeper, for a great part of his career he had to be a substitute to Vladimir Beara, who was named by legendary Soviet goalkeeper Lev Yashin as the greatest keeper of all time. However, he has never complained about that misfortune and according to Beara himself, Vuli\u0107 was his best and most loyal friend, who even twice picked a fight to protect him. He still managed to become the second-most-capped Hajduk Split goalkeeper ever, with 339 games (116 in the league, 17 in the domestic cup, 4 international games and 202 friendlies, scoring 29 goals in total),Statistika na slu\u017ebenim stranicama HNK Hajduka after Radomir Vuk\u010devi\u0107 (402).Zanimljivi podaci Despite being a long-time substitute to Beara, he was also known as an excellent penalty taker. Beara (who was the first goalkeeper ever to save a penalty to Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s in the 1952 Olympic finals, and who has also saved penalties from many other prominent strikers, having saved four penalties during a single game in a derby against Dinamo Zagreb) claimed that he has never seen a better penalty taker than Ante Vuli\u0107. ==International career== Vuli\u0107 was capped in the only international game the Croatian national team played while Croatia was part of Yugoslavia, a 5\u20132 win against Indonesia in Zagreb, on 12 September 1956. ==Personal facts== Vuli\u0107's son, Zoran, also became a long-time player for Hajduk Split, the team's captain and later football manager, coaching Hajduk several times. Zoran also played internationally for Yugoslavia and Croatia. ==References== Category:1928 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Croatian footballers Category:Yugoslav footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:HNK Hajduk Split players Category:Yugoslav First League players Category:Association football goalkeepers who have scored Category:Croatia international footballers ",
