During the 1970s, Tucker and her family were members of the Rajneesh movement and years later these events would inspire her to want to work on a project involving the subject of cults. ===Development=== On January 16, 2018, it was announced that Facebook had given the production, a television series adaptation of Stephanie Oakes's novel The Sacred Lies of Minnow Bly, a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes.

On June 23, 2018, it was announced that the series would premiere on July 27, 2018. On December 13, 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season which will premiere on February 20, 2020 under the title Sacred Lies: The Singing Bones. Series writer Molly Nussbaum has expressed the difficulty involved in the series' writing due to the time constraints imposed by Facebook. She explained how instead of viewing the limitation as an obstacle the staff saw it as a creative opportunity saying, \"the 30-minute challenge really made us rigorous and smart.\" ===Casting=== On March 2, 2018, it was announced that Elena Kampouris, Kevin Carroll, Kiana Madeira, and Ryan Robbins had been cast in main roles. A month later, it was announced that Toby Huss had joined the main cast in a series regular role and that Katrina Law and Leah Gibson would appear in a recurring capacity. ===Filming=== Principal photography for season one began on March 15, 2018 in Vancouver, Canada and was set to last until May 25, 2018.

The screening was followed by a question-and-answer session with creator/executive producer Raelle Tucker, director/executive producer Scott Winant, Blumhouse co- president of television Jeremy Gold, and cast members including Kiana Madeira, Kevin Carroll, and Elena Kampouris. It was moderated by Facebook Watch's head of development, Mina Lefevre. ==Reception== In a positive review, Varietys Caroline Framke offered the series praise saying, \"With episodes running at an economical half-hour, Sacred Lies maintains a solid enough balance between withholding answers and laying groundwork for the mysteries ahead.\" In a similarly favorable critique, Pastes Alexis Gunderson lauded the series saying, \"It is very artistic, not just in the color saturation, but in every shot of hands, fingers, and things that need hands and fingers to cross Minnow's line of sight in the detention center\u2014shots that would feel fetishizing were it not for the absolute opacity of thought with which the shrewd Minnow, who is never presented as an object of pity, regards them. It is absolutely artistic. It is also grim. It is also an active, challenging watch. It is, as far as I can tell, all the things everyone's favorite dark prestige television is.\" In a more mixed assessment, The Globe and Mails John Doyle offered the series restrained approval saying, \"Sacred Lies is a good, multilayered drama, although the vaguely supernatural quality to Minnow's past is milked a bit too hard.\" In an overall negative review, Indiewires Ben Travers gave the series a grade of \"C-\" and criticized it saying, \"This half- hour drama is ineffective in teasing its larger mystery, and its dialogue can be laughably blunt. Die-hard fans of the book may stick around to see how it all plays out, but that would take a level of commitment usually seen...in cults!\" ==Other media== ===Aftershow=== The Official Sacred Lies After Show is a companion aftershow series that airs live on the series' official Facebook page on Sunday evenings.
