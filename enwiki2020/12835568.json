    "text": "A theatre practitioner is someone who creates theatrical performances and/or produces a theoretical discourse that informs of his or her practical work.Milling and Ley (2001, vi, 173) and Pavis (1998, 280). , , . A theatre practitioner may be a director, dramatist, actor, designer or a combination of these traditionally separate roles. Theatre practice describes the collective work that various theatre practitioners do.Pavis (1998, 392). Theatre practitioner also refers to one who practices theatre. The term was not ordinarily applied to theatre-makers prior to the rise of modernism in the theatre. Instead, theatre praxis from Konstantin Stanislavski's development of his system is described through Vsevolod Meyerhold's biomechanics, Antonin Artaud's Theatre of cruelty, Bertolt Brecht's epic, and Jerzy Grotowski's poor theatre. Contemporary theatre practitioners include Augusto Boal with his Theatre of the Oppressed, Dario Fo's popular theatre, Eugenio Barba's theatre anthropology, and Anne Bogart's viewpoints.McCullough (1996, 15-36) and Milling and Ley (2001, vii, 175). ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Bibliography=== * Counsell, Colin. 1996.
