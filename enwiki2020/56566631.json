A fund was established in 2011 due to donors from the United States. Also, in 2012 a proper building was designated for displaying the carpets by donors from Moscow, Russia. The museum has carpets and traditional historical artifacts on display. After close examination these artifacts receive expert evaluation, needed restoration and then are put on display. Currently the museum has around three hundred carpets and flat weaves in its collection. They date from the 17th-century to the beginning of the 20th- century. Besides the locally woven carpets there are Turkoman, Afghan and Persian carpets and flat weaves in the museum's collection. Also available are Russian cultural artifacts in the museum. During his visit to the museum on August 2013 Artsakh President Bako Sahakyan stated that the carpet museum plays an important role in preserving our national traditions and values and also for the development of tourism. == Gallery == \u0533\u0578\u0580\u0563\u0565\u05807.jpg| \u0533\u0578\u0580\u0563\u0565\u0580\u056b \u0569\u0561\u0576\u0563\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576.jpg| \u0533\u0578\u0580\u0563\u0565\u0580.jpg| \u0533\u0578\u0580\u0563\u0565\u05803.jpg| \u0533\u0578\u0580\u0563\u0565\u05802.jpg| \u0533\u0578\u0580\u0563\u0565\u05801.jpg| \u0547\u0578\u0582\u0577\u056b\u056b \u0563\u0578\u0580\u0563\u0565\u0580\u056b \u0569\u0561\u0576\u0563\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576\u0568 \u0576\u0565\u0580\u057d\u056b\u0581.jpg| \u0531\u0580\u0581\u0561\u056d\u0575\u0561\u0576 \u0563\u0578\u0580\u0563\u0565\u0580.jpg| \u0533\u0578\u0580\u05636.jpg| \u0533\u0578\u0580\u05635.jpg| \u0533\u0578\u0580\u0563\u0565\u05804.jpg| == References == Category:Tourist attractions in the Republic of Artsakh Category:Textile museums Category:Shusha Category:Rugs and carpets ",
