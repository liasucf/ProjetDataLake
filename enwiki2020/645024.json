    "text": "Aspidites is a genus of pythons endemic to Australia. The name can be translated as \"shield bearer\" and pertains to the symmetrically shaped head scales. Currently, two species are recognized. ==Description== These snakes lack the heat-sensitive pits between the labial scales that most other python species have. The head is slightly wider than the neck, and the eyes are small, with a vertically elliptic pupils.Boulenger GA. 1893. Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History).
