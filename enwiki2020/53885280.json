The fortified city was built along the present-day border between India and Nepal. The rule of the Karnata dynasty marks an important milestone and a golden age in the history of Tirhut. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, social reforms, religious and the development of local folk music and literature. ==Karnat dynasty== The Simraon, Karnat or Dev Dynasty originated with establishment of a kingdom in 1097 CE headquartered at present day Simraungadh in Bara District. The kingdom controlled the areas we today know as Tirhut or Mithila in India and Nepal. This region is bounded by the Mahananda River in the east, the Ganges in the south, the Gandaki River in the west and by the Himalayas in the north. The boundary line was made between the two countries after the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816. According to French orientalist and indologist Sylvain L\u00e9vi, Nanyadeva established his supremacy over Simraungadh probably with the help of Chalukya king Vikramaditya VI. After the reign of Vikramaditya VI in 1076 CE, he led the successful military campaign over modern Bengal and Bihar.
