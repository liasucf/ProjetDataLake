In a 3\u20132 win against KV Mechelen on 15 August 2009, he spat at opposition player Yoni Buyens, which although went undetected by the referee, was caught on television. Consequently, he served a five-match ban, three on immediate effect and two on the last match of the season. However, after an appeal from the club, his ban was reduced to two matches. Around the same time, Dirar was suspended by the club and was sent to the reserve team after being late for training.
