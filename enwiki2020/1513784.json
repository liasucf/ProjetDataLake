    "text": "An Audie Award (or Audie) is an annual award given by the American Audio Publishers Association for audiobooks and spoken-word entertainment. Since 1996, the nominees have been announced in February, and the winners announced at a gala banquet held in May, usually during the BookExpo America fair. The Audies are sometimes promoted as \"the Oscars of the audiobook industry\" and serve as a way to promote audiobooks. Awards are given in about thirty categories. Some of the awards relate to types of writing, including abridged and unabridged fiction and nonfiction, and such genres as romance, fantasy and mystery; other awards recognize excellence in different styles of narration and production, such as multi-voiced performance and production values. Over the years, the structure and the categories of the awards have changed. These changes are apparent in the lists of the Audie award winners in the external links below. The 2016 award ceremony was held May 11 at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago and was hosted by Paula Poundstone.Audie Nominations 2016 Press Release February 2016 ==Categories== The award categories,
