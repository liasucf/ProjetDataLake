    "text": "Start of Phase III of Trans-Labrador Highway, a gravel road between Cartwright Junction and Happy Valley-Goose Bay. The Trans-Labrador Highway (TLH) is a highway located in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It is the primary public road in Labrador. Its total length is . Due to the harsh winters and sparse population in most of Labrador, long parts of the road are a well-packed asphalt/gravel surface that is re-graded annually (usually in mid to late May). There are plans to complete the paving of the highway by 2021. The original western/central portion of the TLH is designated as Route 500 and measures divided as follows: * Quebec - Labrador boundary to Labrador City/Wabush: (, asphalt surface) * Labrador City/Wabush to Churchill Falls: (, asphalt surface) * Churchill Falls to Happy Valley-Goose Bay: (, asphalt surface) Heading southeast is Route 510, the north portion of the TLH that has been designated Labrador Coastal Drive and measures divided as follows: * Happy Valley-Goose Bay to Cartwright Junction (, asphalt and gravel, the remainder to be paved in 2020-21https://www.roads.gov.nl.ca/2020_Roads_Plan.pdf * Cartwright Junction to Port Hope Simpson (, asphalt surface). * Port Hope Simpson to Mary's Harbour (, asphalt surface). * Mary's Harbour to Lodge Bay (, asphalt surface). * Lodge Bay to Red Bay (, asphalt surface). * Red Bay to Quebec - Labrador boundary via Blanc-Sablon (, asphalt surface). The TLH runs through dense wilderness for most of its length with no roadside services between communities. The TLH/Labrador Coastal Drive connects with Quebec Route 389, which runs through wilderness north from Baie-Comeau to the Quebec - Labrador boundary. In the 2020 budget, the provincial government allocated $200,000 for a pre-feasibility study for a road to connect the north coast of Labrador to the Trans-Labrador Highway. ==Construction and development== Division No. 10, Subdivision D, NL ===Phase I, Upgrading Labrador West to Happy Valley-Goose Bay=== The original TLH from Labrador West (Labrador City/Wabush) to Happy Valley-Goose Bay was completed in 1992. Some sections were poorly built or in need of upgrades due to increased traffic use, particularly the section between Churchill Falls and Happy Valley-Goose Bay. In the summer of 1999, $60 million was allocated to upgrade the highway as part of the \"Labrador Transportation Initiative\". The Phase I section of the TLH began undergoing paving operations in 2009; by October 2011, a stretch of approximately leading east from Labrador West had been paved, as well approximately heading west from Goose Bay towards Churchill Falls. The entire Phase I section of the TLH was completed in 2014. ====Route 510==== In 1997 the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador committed to building an extension of the TLH, connecting Happy Valley-Goose Bay with an existing isolated road network serving coastal communities on the Strait of Belle Isle. The impetus for this project was the federal government's desire to cut costs and remove itself from subsidizing coastal ferry service to Labrador outports which was being provided by the federal Crown corporation Marine Atlantic. These federal cuts were completed in 1997, under the moniker Labrador Transportation Initiative, when an agreement was signed which saw the federal government transfer ownership and operation of two ferry vessels, along with C$340 million for extending Labrador's road network. A key component to this plan was $150 million to upgrade coastal Labrador marine services, including a newer high- capacity ferry for the St. Barbe-Blanc Sablon service across the Strait of Belle Isle. Route 510, north of Port Hope Simpson ===Phase II, Red Bay to Cartwright=== Phase II of new construction, costing $130 million, began in 1999 and saw Route 510 extended over four years from its terminus in Red Bay northeast to the port of Cartwright. When this southern portion of the TLH was completed in 2002, the Labrador coastal ferry services were transferred from Lewisporte on Newfoundland to Cartwright. The section from Red Bay to Charlottetown is being paved, to be completed in 2017. The southern TLH runs , divided as follows: The Phase II section of the southern portion of the TLH between Red Bay and Mary's Harbour experiences extreme winter driving conditions: pictures of heavy snow-removal equipment battling snow drifts dozens of feet deep have become famous around the world. The poor winter driving conditions often result in this section of the TLH being impassable for weeks; the route in use required rock cuts that tend to fill with snow. ===Phase III, Cartwright Junction to Happy Valley-Goose Bay=== Phase III is a section of Route 510 built for $130 million south of Lake Melville/Hamilton Inlet to connect Cartwright Junction ( south west of Cartwright) with Happy Valley-Goose Bay, completed sufficiently to open to traffic on 16 December 2009. During 2010, two permanent bridges, road surface work, signage, and guardrails were completed at a cost of $15 million. Phase II north from Cartwright Junction is Route 516, and a ferry service connects Cartwright with Happy Valley-Goose Bay, which was intended to be removed after the highway is completed, achieved in mid-December 2009. Transportation Minister Tom Hedderson had made the announcement of the impending completion of the highway connection between Cartwright and Happy Valley-Goose Bay on Tuesday, December 8, 2009 in the legislature. \"We indicated that we'd do everything possible to get it done in this time period of 2009,\" Hedderson said, \"and ... we are very, very close in a sense that the crew has indeed connected up both sides.\" Hedderson said some final work has to be done on that portion of the highway, but he said it would open to the public soon. of this route have been paved in 2015. ==Route 516 and supplementary routes== Phase II involved completion of highway north to Cartwright from Red Bay, and was opened in 2002. Although the entire route was initially designated as Route 510, upon completion of Phase III, the northern from Cartwright Junction was designated as Route 516. Phase II also included other branch routes: * Route 513 to St. Lewis * Route 514 to Charlottetown and Pinsent Arm == Kilometre markers == Route 500 between Labrador City and Churchill Falls Bridge of route 500 over Churchill River ===Route 500=== ===Route 510=== Route 510 between L'Anse-au-Loup and Pinware Route 510 between Pinware and Red Bay Route 510 between Port Hope Simpson and Happy Valley-Goose Bay ===State of the road=== ;Route 500 {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
