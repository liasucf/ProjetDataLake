    "text": "Iron Savior are a German power metal band that was formed in Hamburg, Germany, in 1996. Following a period of several years working behind the scenes in music production, multi-instrumentalist and producer/engineer Piet Sielck joined with former Helloween bandmate Kai Hansen and then-drummer for Blind Guardian Thomen Stauch in a new project that would blend power metal with a high-concept science fiction story. The band's debut album Iron Savior introduced the story that would be told over the course of multiple albums, featuring a self-aware space vessel called the Iron Savior and its relationship to the mythical lost civilization of Atlantis. Critics have compared Iron Savior's sound and musical approach to classic heavy metal bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Queensr\u00ffche. Kai Hansen's presence in the band brought to the Iron Savior albums on which he appeared a style heavily influenced by Gamma Ray and Helloween. Since its inception, Iron Savior has released eleven studio albums, two EPs, three singles and one live album. Despite numerous lineup changes, Piet has continued to direct the band and is currently the only remaining founding member. ==Members== ===Current band members=== * Piet Sielck \u2013 lead vocals, guitar (1996-present) * Joachim \"Piesel\" K\u00fcstner \u2013 guitar, backing vocals (2000-present) * Jan-S\u00f6ren Eckert \u2013 bass, vocals (1997-2003, 2011-present) * Patrick Klose \u2013 drums (2017-present) ===Former band members=== * Kai Hansen \u2013 vocals, guitar (1996-2001) * Yenz Leonhardt \u2013 bass, backing vocals (2003-2011) * Andreas K\u00fcck \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals (1998-2003) * Thomen Stauch \u2013 drums (1996-1998) * Dan Zimmermann \u2013 drums (1998-1999) * Thomas Nack \u2013 drums (1999-2017; touring member: 1997-1998) ===Timeline=== ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Iron Savior (1997) *Unification (1999) *Dark Assault (2001) *Condition Red (2002) *Battering Ram (2004) *Megatropolis (2007) (re-recorded in 2015 as Megatropolis 2.0) *The Landing (2011) *Rise of the Hero (2014) *Titancraft (2016) *Reforged \u2013 Riding on Fire (2017) *Kill or Get Killed (2019) *Skycrest (2020) ===Extended plays=== *Coming Home (1998) *Interlude (1999) *I've Been to Hell (2000) ===Singles=== * Titans of Our Time (2002) * Time Will Tell (2004) ===Live albums=== * Live At The Final Frontier (2015) ==References== == External links == * Official homepage * Official webshop * Official Myspace * Text of the Iron Savior story as told through liner notes Category:Musical groups established in 1996 Category:German power metal musical groups Category:Musical quartets Category:Noise Records artists Category:AFM Records artists ",
