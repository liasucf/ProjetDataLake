    "text": "Varanus telenesetes (mysterious tree monitor) is a member of the tree monitor species-complex. The species was described based on a single specimen supposedly collected on Rossel Island in the Louisiade Archipelago of Papua New Guinea. However, later searches of this island have failed to turn up any specimens and native islanders deny ever seeing it. It is now believed that the original collection data was in error and that the species occurs on some other, currently unknown, island east of New Guinea. ==Description== Like all tree monitors, the body is slender with a long, prehensile tail (~2 times the SVL). The background color is dark (blackish) and lacks a visible dorsal pattern. The underside is cream-colored with deep brown spots and the throat is banded. Unique for tree monitors, the tongue color is yellow (vs. pink) and the soles of the hands and feet are light-colored (vs. dark). The total length of the known specimen is just over two feet, though it is likely that this represents an animal not fully grown as most tree monitors average a total length of around three feet. ==References== Category:Monitor lizards Category:Reptiles of Papua New Guinea Category:Endemic fauna of Papua New Guinea Category:Reptiles described in 1991 ",
