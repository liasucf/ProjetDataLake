Retrieved August 27, 2016 ==Plot== London-based gangster George Thomason and his right- hand man, Ken Pile, an animal lover with a stutter, plan a jewel heist. They bring in two Americans: con artist Wanda Gershwitz and weapons expert Otto West, an ignorant and mean-spirited anglophobe. Wanda and Otto are lovers, but they hide this from George and Ken, pretending to be siblings, so Wanda can work her charms on them. The heist is successful and the gang escapes with a large sum in diamonds. They hide the diamonds in a safe in an old warehouse; soon afterward, Wanda and Otto betray George to the police and he is arrested. They return to collect the diamonds, with Wanda planning to double-cross Otto as well, but find that George has moved them. In Ken's fish tank, Wanda discovers the key to the safe deposit box containing the diamonds and hides it in her pendant. Wanda decides to seduce George's barrister, Archie Leach, so he can persuade George to plead guilty and give up the location of the diamonds. Archie is in a loveless marriage and quickly falls for Wanda. Otto is jealous, and his interference causes Wanda and Archie's liaisons to go disastrously wrong. Wanda accidentally leaves her pendant at Archie's house, and Archie's wife, Wendy, mistakes it for a gift for her, assuming that the \u2018W\u2019 on it is for Wendy. Wanda demands that Archie retrieve the pendant (since she needs the key inside), and after failing to convince Wendy to give it up, he ends up faking a robbery at his own home in order to explain its disappearance. Otto arrives at the house to apologise to Archie for earlier insults and interrupts the robbery, knocking the burglar unconscious before he realises it is, in fact, Archie robbing his own home. Archie returns the pendant to Wanda at their next romantic meeting, but it is interrupted and he subsequently telephones her to call off their affair. Otto arrives at the house again to apologise. Wendy overhears their subsequent garden conversation from an upstairs window, and begins to strongly suspect that Archie is cheating on her. George asks Ken to kill the Crown's only eyewitness to the robbery, an unpleasant old woman who owns three small dogs. Ken tries three times, but each time accidentally kills one of the dogs instead. This causes him great distress, but the last dog's death gives the woman a fatal heart attack, so he is successful. With no witness, George seems poised to be released. He gives instructions to Ken, revealing the location of the diamonds. When Otto learns that Ken knows the location, he tries to force Ken to reveal it by eating Ken's pet fish, leaving Ken's favourite, named Wanda, until last. Ken reveals that the diamonds are at a hotel near Heathrow Airport. With Otto's knowledge and Wanda's key, the pair wants George to remain in jail. At his trial, Wanda, as a defence witness, unexpectedly gives evidence against him. When Archie, stunned, flubs his questioning and inadvertently calls her \"darling\", it confirms to Wendy (watching from the public gallery) that Archie has had an affair, and she declares their marriage over. With no career and no marriage, Archie resolves to cut his losses, steal the loot himself and flee to South America. Promised less jail time, George tells him that Ken knows where the diamonds are. Archie sees Wanda fleeing the courthouse, pulls her into his car and races to Ken's flat. They initially bicker, with Archie criticising her deceit and Wanda bemoaning him breaking off their affair, but soon reconcile. They arrive at George\u2019s flat, and as Archie runs into the building, Otto steals Archie's car, taking Wanda with him. Archie painstakingly coaxes Ken, who is stuttering uncontrollably, to tell him where the safety deposit box is, and they set out for Heathrow on Ken\u2019s moped. Otto and Wanda recover the diamonds, but Wanda double-crosses Otto and leaves him unconscious in a broom cupboard at Heathrow. Before boarding her flight to Rio de Janeiro, Wanda telephones Archie, demonstrating that she does genuinely care for him, but when she gets no response, she reluctantly boards. Otto recovers, shoots his way out of the cupboard, secures a boarding pass from a gullible passenger (listed in the credits as Hutchison) and makes his way to the tarmac, where he is confronted by Archie. Otto is about to kill Archie, but Archie stalls him by taunting Otto about America's defeat in Vietnam. Ken arrives, driving a steamroller, seeking vengeance for his fish. Otto, who has stepped in wet concrete and cannot move, is run over but survives. Archie and Wanda board the plane and Otto, clinging to the window outside, curses them until he is blown off during takeoff. ==Cast== * John Cleese as Archie Leach * Jamie Lee Curtis as Wanda Gershwitz * Kevin Kline as Otto West * Michael Palin as Ken Pile * Tom Georgeson as George Thomason * Maria Aitken as Wendy Leach * Cynthia Cleese as Portia Leach * Patricia Hayes as Mrs Eileen Coady * Geoffrey Palmer as Judge * Roger Brierley as Davidson * Llewellyn Rees as Sir John * Stephen Fry as Hutchison * Al Ashton as Warder ==Production== Cleese and Crichton had previously attempted to make a film together in 1969.

Cleese considered using the event for publicity, but ultimately decided it was in too bad taste. ===Accolades=== {| class='wikitable' |- ! colspan=\"4\" | Awards |- ! Award ! Category ! Name !

It is also included in the Reader's Digest \"100 Funniest Films\" list. In 1999, it was voted 39th on the BFI Top 100 British films list compiled by the British Film Institute Also in 2000, the American Film Institute placed the film on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list, where it was ranked number 21.

James Berardinelli of ReelViews awarded the film four out of four stars in his review; it is also number 10 on his \"Top 100\" list. ==Sequels and adaptations== The principal cast reunited in 1997 for Fierce Creatures (dubbed an \"equal\" rather than a sequel or prequel, by Kline), playing different roles. Fierce Creatures was not as well received by critics or audiences as A Fish Called Wanda. The novelization of Fierce Creatures, written by Iain Johnstone, who co-wrote the film, begins with a letter from Archie (John Cleese's character in the first film) to his brother Rollo. According to the letter: *Archie and Wanda are still living happily in Rio, and Wanda enjoys having a new child (or multiple children) each year; *Otto visited them once, having left South Africa after Nelson Mandela's election and the end of the apartheid regime; he is looking for like-minded individuals to form a similar group of National Socialists, and Archie and Wanda are both heartily glad when he is gone; *Ken is still master of ceremonies at the London Sea World; before visiting Rio, Otto \"looked him up\" as if they were old friends, but did not even get close before Ken had security guards throw Otto out of the park. A loose Indian adaptation, Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav, was released in 2005. In 2008, it was reported that John Cleese and his daughter, Cynthia (who played his screen daughter, Portia), had started to work on a stage musical version of the film. ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * A Fish Called Wanda at The Numbers Category:1988 films Category:1980s crime comedy films Category:1980s heist films Category:American crime comedy films Category:American heist films Category:American films Category:British crime comedy films Category:British heist films Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:Films about fish Category:Films about con artists Category:Films directed by Charles Crichton Category:Films scored by John Du Prez Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award-winning performance Category:Films set in London Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Films with screenplays by John Cleese Category:1988 comedy films ",
