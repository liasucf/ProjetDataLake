    "text": "Hormigueros () is a municipality of Puerto Rico located in the western region of the island, northeast of Cabo Rojo; northwest of San Germ\u00e1n; and south of Mayag\u00fcez. Hormigueros is spread over 5 barrios and Hormigueros Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center). It is part of the Mayag\u00fcez Metropolitan Statistical Area. ==History== The region of what is now Hormigueros belonged to the Guaynia region, located on the southwest portion of Puerto Rico. Archaeological findings have established that there were tribes already settled in the region around 820 BC. During the Spanish colonization at the beginning of the 16th century, European colonizers settled in the area. A coffin found underground the basilica was tested in laboratories and was dated prior to 1600. Historians also mention the Horomico river as one of the main sources of gold during the rush of the era. In 1692, the settlement that would become the town of Hormigueros was first established as a village of San Germ\u00e1n. It was founded by Giraldo Gonz\u00e1lez de la Renta sometimes spelled Geraldo).Hormigueros: History and Founding. Encyclopedia Puerto Rico. Retrieved 21 October 2012. After its initial establishment, Hormigueros belonged to the municipality of San Germ\u00e1n. From 1863 to 1873, residents of Hormigueros made formal petitions to be separated from San Germ\u00e1n and be declared an independent municipality. They were finally granted their independence as a municipality on April 1, 1874, being its first mayor Narciso Oller Serra. However, after the American invasion of 1898, Hormigueros was annexed this time to the town of Mayag\u00fcez. The annexation was ordered by Guy V. Henry, but according to Adolfo de Hostos, it was a town's petition. In 1912, they were granted their independence once again, although there were attempts to annex them again during 1928\u201329. ===Folklore=== Virgen de La Monserrate at the Museo de las Americas in San Juan, Puerto Rico There is folklore about the town's founder, an explanation of why the church in the town, Bas\u00edlica Menor de la Virgen de Monserrate, became so important. The legend has to do with the townspeople aiding Geraldo in finding his eight- year-old daughter, \"with eyes as blue as the turquoise skies\", when she disappeared. When his daughter was found 15 days later she was unharmed, not hungry, and unafraid and happily explained that a black woman had helped her. Geraldo and the townspeople imagined it was the Virgin of Montserrat and Geraldo said that for having helped his daughter she would be venerated for all ages. Many people heard of the tale and began praying for miracles at the place. Many pilgrimages have been made to the church, even as early as in the 17th century. It had not been the first time Geraldo had experienced a miracle at the location where the church would be built. The first miracle was when a savage bull was going to attack him but when he prayed the bull bent its knees, bowed its head to the ground, and didn't attack. Some versions of the story of the bull that would kill Geraldo state the bull's legs actually broke and thus was unable to charge at him. Since then, many Catholics perform penitence by walking the steps to the church on their knees. ===Hurricane Maria=== Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered landslides in Hormigueros with the significant amount of rainfall. ==Geography== The municipality of Hormigueros can be divided in three areas: the northern mountainous region that covers one fourth of the town, with hills of relative height; a semi-mountainous region that extends from east to west covering downtown Hormigueros; and the flat, valley-like region that extends tobarrios the south covering 5.6 square miles. ===Climate=== The climate conditions of Hormigueros are hot and humid.
