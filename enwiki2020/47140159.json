It should not be confused with Atl\u00e9tico's fierce rivals Real Madrid's Campo de O'Donnell, which had same name and was situated 200 meters away on the same boulevard called Calle de O'Donnell. Atletico Madrid moved from Tiro del Pich\u00f3n in 1913. The inaugural match was on 9 February 1913, against Athletic Bilbao, who won 4\u20130. ==References== Category:Defunct football venues in Spain Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid Category:Former sports venues in Madrid Category:Sports venues completed in 1913 Category:Sports venues demolished in 1923 Category:Football venues in Madrid ",
