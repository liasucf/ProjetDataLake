It is North America's largest Scandinavian festival. ==History== The event is held on the North Dakota State Fair grounds in Minot, North Dakota. Tens of thousands of people attend the Norsk H\u00f8stfest to celebrate and partake in the Scandinavian culture and entertainment. Altogether it has hosted cultural touchstones from Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Greenland, \u00c5land, Faroe Islands, German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands.Norsk Hostfest getting under way in Minot (Minot Daily News September 27, 2008) The festival was founded in 1978 by former North Dakota senator and mayor of Minot, Chester Reiten (1923-2013), and a group of friends who shared his interest in celebrating their Nordic heritage. The festival is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that raises funds to preserve, improve and share Scandinavian culture, heritage and educational programs. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Norsk H\u00f8stfest cancelled its annual event for the first time ever. ==Activities== Highlights of the fall festival include announcing the annual Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame inductees. The Hall of Fame is an enduring means of honoring those persons of Scandinavian descent in North America who have achieved greatness in their fields of endeavor and/or whose efforts have contributed significantly to the betterment of mankind. Other remarkable honors include the selection of the annual Miss Norsk H\u00f8stfest and naming of the Chester Award, which recognizes festival excellence in five categories: artisan, exhibitor, food concessionaire, volunteer and chairman. Norsk H\u00f8stfest features a number of Nordic exhibits with internationally recognized artisans, craftsmen and chefs participating. The cuisine as well as the clothes, art and jewelry are authentic, fine quality and exquisitely Nordic. During H\u00f8stfest week (end of September through first few days of October), presenters associated with the festival travel to the surrounding area where they introduce Nordic heritage and culture to students in an effort named \"H\u00f8stfest In The Schools\". Additionally, Scandinavian Youth Camp is held the weekend prior to H\u00f8stfest. Children participating in the camps also perform at H\u00f8stfest in scheduled events such as the Troll beauty contest, Norwegian Folk dance, Swedish Maypole dancers, and the Troll parade. There are several headliner acts booked each night of the event, not limited to the event's Scandinavian theme. Headliners in the past have included performers from the United States, Canada and Europe.Helseth, Candi Three decades of H\u00f8stfest.
