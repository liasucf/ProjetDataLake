The reserve extends along the Espraiado River. It is almost completely surrounded by the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station. ==History== The Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Mosaic of conservation units was created by law 12.406 of 12 December 2006. It included the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station and the newly created Itingu\u00e7u and Prelado state parks, Despraiado and Barra do Una sustainable development reserves and the Ilhas do Abrigo e Guararitama Wildlife Refuge.

On 10 June 2009 a judgement upheld the finding of unconstitutionality. Law 14.982 of 8 April 2013 again altered the limits of the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station, re-categorising some areas. These included the Despraiado Sustainable Development Reserve.
