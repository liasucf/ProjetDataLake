    "text": "The Viper engine is a high-performance naturally-aspirated pushrod 2 valves- per-cylinder 90\u00b0 V10 engine built by Chrysler for use in the vehicle of the same name. == History == Production of the V10 engine started at Mound Road Engine before moving to Conner Avenue Assembly, where the Viper itself is built, in May 2001. In addition, the Viper V10 was installed in the Dodge Ram SRT-10, earning the truck the Guinness World Record for fastest production truck (later bettered by an Australian production car; the Holden HSV Maloo that uses the LS2, Corvette engine, into the pickup truck category ). The Dodge Tomahawk concept vehicle also uses this engine. Bitter Cars of Germany produced the Bitter GT1 based on the Lotus Elise GT1 using this engine. The V10 was also sold to British luxury car manufacturer Bristol Cars: the Bristol Fighter was powered by a modified version of the engine which produced , increasing to at high speed due to the ram air effect. In the more powerful Fighter S the engine was tuned to give ( at high speed). Bristol had also planned to produce the Fighter T, the V10 would have been further modified and turbocharged to produce at 5600 rpm, slightly more than the advertised of the Bugatti Veyron, however Bristol have since stated that no Fighter T models were produced. == Development == === Phase SR (1992\u20132002) === The Viper engine on the SR I version of the Viper. ;SR I (1st Generation) The Viper V10 is based on the Chrysler LA engine family and appeared with the Dodge Viper in 1992. It was conceived and prototyped as a Magnum 5.9 with two extra cylinders and a longer stroke of . Lamborghini engineers revamped Dodge's cast-iron block V10 engine for the Viper by redesigning the block and heads in aluminium alloy. Prototype blocks were cast by Lamborghini, at the time a Chrysler division. The first-generation Viper V10 engine had a displacement of and produced at 4600 rpm and of torque at 3600 rpm. ;SR II (2nd Generation) The second-generation engine, also displacing 8.0 L, produced @ 5200 rpm and of torque @ 3700 rpm. === Phase ZB (2003\u20132010) === ;ZB I (3rd Generation) The third-generation engine, introduced on the 2003 Viper, had a displacement of with a bore x stroke of , rated at @ 5600 rpm and @ 4200 rpm of torque after SAE certification in 2006. ;ZB II (4th Generation) For the 2008 Dodge Viper, the engine's output was increased to @ 6100 rpm and @ 5000 rpm of torque via a slight displacement increase to and the use of variable valve timing, among the first utilized in a pushrod engine. The bore was now , the same as Chrysler's 6.1 L Hemi engine. === Phase VX (2012\u20132017) === ;VX I (5th Generation) The 2013 SRT Viper kept roughly the same displacement but further boosted power to @ 6150 rpm and @ 4950 rpm of torque. Since 2015, power was raised up to at 6200 rpm. == Other Viper V10 vehicles == * Dodge Tomahawk * Millyard Viper V10 * Spania GTA Spano * VLF Force 1 * Dodge Ram SRT-10 * Alfa Romeo Zagato TZ3 Stradale == References == Category:Chrysler engines Category:V10 engines ",
