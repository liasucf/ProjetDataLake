A church existed on this location circa the 12th century, but was extensively modified and enlarged. According to the listing summary, \"the crossing tower, north and south transepts and aisles were added\" in the 14th century; additional modifications were made in the next two centuries before a restoration in 1867-1868.CHURCH OF ST PETER The plan is cruciform and the site is in the former park of the Earls of Bath. The collection of church monuments is particularly fine: most of the persons commemorated are members of the family of the Earls, connections of theirs, or household officers. Features of interest include the 16th century gallery, the manorial pew of the Earls of Bath (Renaissance in style) and two ceilings of Italian plasterwork. The tomb of Lady Fitzwarren and the monument of Rachel, Countess of Bath (with figure by Burman) are in the south chancel aisle.Betjeman, John, ed. (1968) Collins Pocket Guide to English Parish Churches; the South. London: Collins; p. 166 The tomb of Sir John Wray (died 1597) is a large slate-covered tomb-chest with decorated slate back-plate. The tomb was originally at St Ive in Cornwall because a Wray had married a Bourchier in 1652 and it was brought here in 1924.Pevsner, N. (1952) North Devon. Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 153 ==Manor of Tawstock== The manor of Tawstock was an important one in North Devon, being at times a residence of the feudal barons of Barnstaple. It was held successively by the families of de Totnes, de Braose, de Tracy, FitzMartin, Audley, FitzWarin, Hankford, Bourchier and Wrey. The present Wrey baronet still lives within the former manor\"Hollamoor Farm, Tawstock\" was the residence of the 15th Baronet in 2015, per Kidd, Charles, Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage 2015 Edition, London, 2015, p.B880 and retains ownership of much of the land within the parish, but no longer owns Tawstock Court, the manor house. ===Tawstock Court=== Tawstock Court east front and St Peter's Church, Tawstock, viewed from Codden Hill looking westwards All that remains of the Elizabethan mansion re-built by William Bourchier, 3rd Earl of Bath is the gatehouse, with date-stone 1574. The house burned down in 1787 and was rebuilt in the Neo-Gothic style by about 1800. In about 1940 Rev. Sir Albany Bourchier Sherard Wrey, 13th Baronet, let Tawstock Court to St Michael's Preparatory School. The 14th Baronet sold it to the school which continued to occupy it until it went into administration in 2012. Later that year it was bought by a property investor and developer, as a private residence.GVA. GVA completes the sale of Tawstock Court, 17 July 2012. Accessed 3 December 2016. As part of the sale the nursery school division of St Michael's School continued to operate as of 2013 in the stable blocks to the immediate west of the house. A building described as \"a folly, built in form of look-out tower\" located near the Manor was dubbed \"The Tower\" in its 1965 Grade II listing report (Entry Number 1253651). The structure was restored and converted into a home that was listed for sale in 2019/2020 as \"Tawstock Castle\". Some reports states that the tower was thought to have been built by Sir Bourchier Wrey of the Manor and subsequently expanded.Fairy-tale castle with towers and heli-pad goes on the market in North Devon The Historic England summary simply indicates that it probably originated in the late 18th century.THE TOWER An article in Country Life (magazine) referred to the structure as a \"baby Windsor Castle\".A \u2018baby Windsor Castle\u2019 in Devon that\u2019s been transformed into a gorgeous family4 bedroom detached house for sale Tawstock, Barnstaple ==Estate of Corffe== Corffe, Tawstock, as rebuilt sometime between 1790 and 1822 The estate of Corffe belonged formerly to the Hearle family, and came to the Lovett family by the marriage of Edward Lovett (1627\u20131702),Lysons, Magna Britannia, 1822Mural monument in Tawstock Church whose mural monument survives in Tawstock Church (a son of Sir Robert Lovett (1577\u20131643) of Liscombe House, Soulbury, Buckinghamshire, Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1610) with Joan Hearle (1642\u20131709), the heiress of Corffe.
