During the competition, 36 male bel canto performers are challenged with different ensembles over each episode. In each episode, performers vie for the six spots as an \"apprentice\", but the rounds do not have elimination. The judges will train contestants during the competition based on the vocal range and their suitors on each Apprentice and Cover rounds. At the end of the 100 days, the judges will ultimately finalize a list of six performers who would be named as winners, in which they are awarded with touring and album release opportunities. Singers were either assigned as Apprentice or Covers; an Apprentice will get to perform but Covers are assigned as backup singers. == Summary == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Season !Start broadcasting !end !Episodes !Producer !Principle Members |- !1 |November 2, 2018 |January 18, 2019 |12 | * Liao Changyong * Shang Wenjie * Liu Xianhua * Shi Yijie (sub) | * Ayanga * Cai Chengyu * Zheng Yunlong * Gao Tianhe * Wang Kai * Tong Zhuo |- !2 |July 19, 2019 |October 4, 2019 |12 | * Liao Changyong * Zhang Huimei * Shang Wenjie * Wu Bixia (sub) | * Xu Junshuo * Dai Chen * Zhang Yingxi * Guo Hongxu * He Liangchen * Zheng Qiyuan |} == Musical Works == === Single === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Release order !data !Track |- |1st |Heart of Light * Release Date: November 2, 2018 * Record label: Sky Entertainment Media * Note: Only digital downloads are available | # Heart of Light (The Theme Song of \"Sound Into the Heart\") |- |2nd |\" Say Goodbye \" * Release Date: January 20, 2019 * Record label: Universal Dynamic Sound * Remarks: Not initiated by the program, only digital download is provided | # do not say goodbye # Say goodbye (accompaniment). |- |3rd |\" Guangming Island \" * Release Date: July 19, 2019 * Record label: Happy Sunshine * Note: Only digital downloads are available | # Guangming Island (The Theme Song of \"Sound Into the Heart\" Season 2) |} == Live shows == === Concert / Tours === The \"Super-Vocal\" national tour was produced by the program team and Poly Performance.
