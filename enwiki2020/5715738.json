Machicolations are also permanent and siege-ready.Hogg, Ian V (1975), Fortress: A History of Military Defence, Macdonald and Jane's, (p. 21) It is suspected that in peacetime, hoardings were stored as prefabricated elements. Construction of hoardings was often facilitated by putlog holes, sockets that were left in the masonry of castle walls for wooden joists called \"putlogs\".Lepage, Jean-Denis G G (2002), Castles and Fortified Cities of Medieval Europe: An Illustrated History, McFarland & Company Inc, (p. 49) However, some hoardings were supported on permanent stone corbels.Thompson, A Hamilton (1912, reprinted 2005), The English Castle: An Account of Its Development as a Military Structure, Dover Publications Inc, (p. 81) Some medieval hoardings have survived, including examples at the north tower of Stokesay Castle, England,Hourihane, Colum (editor) 2012, The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture: Volume 1, Oxford University Press, (p. 236) and the keep of Laval, France. The Ch\u00e2teau Comtal at Carcassonne and the keep at Rouen Castle, both in France, have reconstructed wooden hoardings,Thompson, p. 82 and also Castell Coch in South Wales, which was wholly rebuilt in 1875 and has a hoarding over the drawbridge, designed by the Victorian architect William Burges. Pettifer, Adrian (2000), Welsh Castles: A Guide by Counties, The Boydell Press, (p. 91) Another reconstructed hoarding can be seen at Caerphilly Castle, also in South Wales, which extends along the northern curtain wall of the inner bailey.
