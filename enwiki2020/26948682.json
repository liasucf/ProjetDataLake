    "text": "Iredalea is a small genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Drilliidae. This genus was named in 1915 by Walter Oliver after Tom Iredale (1880\u20131972), an English-born naturalist who lived mainly in Australia.Oliver, W.R.B. (1915) The Mollusca of the Kermadec Islands. Transactions of the New Zealand Institute, 47, 509\u2013568, pls. 9\u201312 Fossil species have been found in Pliocene strata of Italy and in Miocene strata of Indonesia; age range: 5.332 to 2.588 Ma.Fossilworks : IredaleaD.

Universit\u00e0 di Bologna, Museo geologico Giovanni Capellini 1-89 ==Description== The narrow, solid and turreted shell has a fusiform shape. The protoconch consists of 4 whorls, with a sinusigera apex. The shell is axially sculptured by numerous slender and continuous riblets. The aperture measures about a third of the length of the shell. The short siphonal canal is wide. The anal sinus is deep and broad, separated from the body whorl by a callosity. A brown band on the periphery is a usual feature.Hedley, Charles (1920), A revision of the Australian Turridae; Records of the Australian Museum, vol.
