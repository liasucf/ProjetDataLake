    "text": "Broadway is a street in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It is one of the city's oldest and most historic routes and forms the Trans-Canada Highway route through the city's downtown. ==Route Description== Broadway begins at Main Street (Route 52), opposite Union Station, near the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. It travels 2.2 kilometers west before merging into westbound Portage Avenue (Route 85). The street is divided into two distinct sections, which are separated by Osborne Street (Route 62). The downtown portion of Broadway is a picturesque street with a wide, park-like boulevard and elm canopy. The street passes by several of Winnipeg's oldest buildings, including the Manitoba Legislative Building, Fort Garry Hotel, Provincial Law Courts Building, and many other heritage buildings. Broadway acts as an unofficial boundary between the commercial and residential areas in the south part of downtown. West of Osborne Street, Broadway enters a residential area known as West Broadway and becomes a four-lane street with no median strip. Osborne Stadium and Shea's Amphitheatre, among the city's earliest sports facilities, were once located in this district near Broadway. The Trans-Canada Highway (PTH 1) follows the full length of Broadway from Main Street (south) to Portage Avenue (west). ==History== The origin of Broadway predates the city of Winnipeg. It was developed as the main east-west thoroughfare through Hudson's Bay Company land reserve around Upper Fort Garry and connected with the Fort Ellice Trail leading to Edmonton, now known as the Yellowhead Highway. The fort has since been demolished; however, the only surviving gate has been incorporated into Upper Fort Garry Provincial Park, located at the southwest corner of Broadway and Main Street. Prior to the construction of Union Station, Broadway extended to the Red River and connected with St. Boniface via the Broadway Bridge. Today, a pedestrian corridor known as the Broadway Promenade maintains the connection between Broadway and Provencher Boulevard in St. Boniface. ==Major intersections== From east to west: ==See also== *Manitoba Highway 1 ==References== Category:Streets and squares in Winnipeg Category:Urban segments of the Trans-Canada Highway ",
