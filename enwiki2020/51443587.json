He competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro where he was eliminated during the cross-country stage of the individual competition. Vogg also participated at the 2014 World Equestrian Games and at the 2013 European Eventing Championships. In 2012 he won the FEI World Cup Eventing title, with his horses Maverick MacNamara and Onfire. At the age of 22, he became the youngest winner of the FEI World Cup Eventing series in history. His grandfather Roland Perret competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics, while his brother Ben Vogg also competed at the 2016 Olympics. At the 2019 Pau CCI***** event, Vogg's partner Archie Rocks suffered a catastrophic shoulder fracture on his approach to a fence late in the cross country course. The decision to euthanize the horse was made by the owners and the show veterinarians after it became clear that the injury was irreparable. ==CCI 5* Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! colspan=13 align=center | Results |- !
