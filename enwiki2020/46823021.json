In all, she made three substitute appearances in the 2012 WSL season, with the team managed by her father Glen Harris. The following season saw new manager Rick Passmore take charge of the team, and this coincided with Harris becoming a key part of the Lincoln first team, making twelve starts and one substitute appearance in the Lady Imps' fourteen league games. ===Liverpool=== Her performances in the 2013 season were enough to earn a move to Liverpool, where she signed a two-year contract. She also became the first ever winner of the PFA Women's Young Player of the Year award in April 2014. In Harris's first season at Liverpool, they retained their WSL title on the final day of the season. She also represented Liverpool in the UEFA Women's Champions League. Harris was ever- present in the 2015 FA WSL season but the club limped to a seventh-place finish. In November 2015, she signed a new contract with Liverpool. On 12 May 2016, she was named Liverpool Ladies Player of the Season. ===Manchester United=== Harris playing for Manchester United against Brighton & Hove Albion in 2019. On 13 July 2018, it was announced that Harris was joining Manchester United for their inaugural season. On 9 September, she made her debut for the club in a 12\u20130 away victory over Aston Villa in the Championship. She scored her first goal for the club on 28 April 2019, a penalty in a 5\u20130 away win against Millwall Lionesses. ==International career== Harris was part of the England under-19 team who finished as runners-up to France at the 2013 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship in Wales. In her first season with Liverpool, she was called up to the under-20 squad for the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. She scored in England's opening match, a 1\u20131 draw with South Korea, but the next two matches were lost and England went out in the first round. Harris then graduated to the under-23 team. ==Personal life== Harris comes from a footballing family in Scothern, who in 2011 were all associated with Lincoln Ladies or Lincoln City. Her father Glen Harris had two spells as manager of Lincoln Ladies and later managed Doncaster Rovers Belles, before joining Manchester United as an assistant manager in 2018.
