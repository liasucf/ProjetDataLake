    "text": "The Zinn House (), located at Kv\u00e6sthusgade 3, is a historic townhouse around the corner from the Nyhavn Canal in central Copenhagen, Denmark. It takes its name after the Zinn family, a wealthy family of merchants that owned it for more than 150 years. The composer Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann, who was married to Emma Sophie Amalie Zinn, a grand daughter of Johann Ludvig Zinn, lived on the second floor for more than 70 years in the period 1829\u20131900. The building was adapted in 1907. It was later in the century converted into offices. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1959. == History == ===Oluf Blach=== The property was built over two storeys in 1751 for the merchant Oluf Blach (1694\u20131767). He had made a fortune on North Atlantic Trade and would later serve as managing director of the General Trading Company. ===Zinn family=== The Zinn family's music room The building was later acquired by another wealthy merchant, Johann Ludvig Zinn, who came to Denmark to work for Fabritius & Wewer in 1757 and established his own trading house in 1765. His daughter, Sophie Dorthea Zinn, described everyday life in the building in her memoirs Grandma' Condma's Confessions (Grandmamas Bekjendelser). It is believed that the Zinn House was the first place in Denmark that the La Marseillaise was sung. It happened during a dinner for a delegation of French business partners on 20 January 1794 where Honor\u00e9-Nicolas-Marie Duveyrier were among the guests. Sophie Zinn persuaded him to sing the song, although \"revolutionary songs\" were highly controversial in Denmark at the time. Duveyrier sent her the score and lyrics the following day. Zinn was fond of music, and his home often played host to soir\u00e9es. Johan Friederich Zinn Zinn's two sons, Carl Ludvig Zinn (1777\u20131808) and Johan Friedrich Zinn (1779\u20131838), took on the family's trading company after his death in 1802. Johann Friederich Zinn became the sole owner of the company when his elder brother died in 1808. He heightened the building in Kv\u00e6sthusgade with one floor in 1812. The company was later passed on to Johan Friedrich Zinn's son Ludvig Maximilian Zinn. J.P.E. Hartmann in his study Johan Friedrich Zinn's daughter, Emma Sophie Amalie, married the composer Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann. The couple lived on the second floor. He served as organist at the nearby Garrison Church from 1724 to 1843. Hartmann stayed in the apartment after his wife's death and lived there until his own death in 1909. The journalist , editor of the magazine F\u00e6drelandet, was a resident in the building from 1870 to circa 1874. The artist Johan Rohde lived in the building in 1903\u201304. ===Later owners=== The house prior to the alterations in 1907 The Zinn House was in the 1900s purchased by Alfred Olsen & Co., an oil company founded by Alfred and Ottho Olsen, in 1901, which had until then been based at Nyhavn 51.. Otto Olsen died in 1906. The company prospered during World War I . Alfred Olsen commissioned the young architect Terkel Jhejle to refurbish the building in 1915. He purchased the estate Egeb\u00e6ksvang at N\u00e6rum in 1916 and commissioned Hjejle to expand the main building with a new wing. Olsen's wife, Olufa Olsen, n\u00e9e B\u00f8jesen, died in 1917. The company's name was changed to the Danish-American Gulf Oil Company in 1946. == Architecture == One of the oriel windows The building consists of three floors over a high cellar and is 12 bays wide. The two oriel windows on the third floor date from the renovation in 1907. The original saddle roof was also replaced by a Mansard roof with eight dormers at this point. The Hartmann plaque Above the gateway is a plaque that commemorates that Hartmann lived in the building from 1829 to 1900. It also mentions that the Zinn family acquired the building in 1751 and that it was renovated in 1907. The complex also comprises a side wing along the north side of a central courtyard and a rear wing. The building fronting the street was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1959 but the side wing and rear are not listed on 6 April 1959. == Today == Thee building is now owned by Nordea Properties. They have converted the building from offices back to apartments with the assistance of Hols\u00f8e Arkitekter. ==Notable residents== * Oluf Blach (1794-1767), merchant * Johann Ludvig Zinn (1734-1892), merchant * Sophie Thalbitzer (1774-1851), memorist * Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann (1805-1900), composer * Emma Hartmann (1807-1851), composer * Lars Hjortsh\u00f8j (born 1967), comedian * Tina Builsbo (born 1862), journalist * Thomas Delaney (born 1991), footballer * Caroline Henderson (born 1962), singer == References == == Further reading == * == External links == * * Source Category:Listed residential buildings in Copenhagen ",
