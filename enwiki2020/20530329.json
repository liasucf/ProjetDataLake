    "text": "The Dippy Diplomat is the 15th animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on August 27, 1945, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. ==Plot== When the Russian ambassador, Ivan Awfulitch, comes to town\"Ambassador Ivan Awfulitch to Attend Barbecue at Home of Wally Walrus\"; The Daily Gab, June 13, 1941; p. 1. Retrieved October 14, 2020The fact that the newspaper shown is over four years old seems to indicate the cartoon was in production before American entry into World War II., Wally Walrus is afforded to honor of hosting a barbecue in the ambassador's honor. The smell of cooking steaks drifts from Wally's house to the park across the street, where Woody is fast asleep, cradled in a statue called \"Motherhood\". The smell rouses Woody from his nap (literally dragging him across the street), and he begins to swipe food off the table -- first by grabbing ears of corn through a fence knothole, then by blindly making a sandwich that includes Wally's right hand. The woodpecker then takes a big bite, which launches the walrus several feet in the air; he lands upside down on his chef's hat, flattening it. Unamused by Woody's shenanigans, Wally hammers several planks of wood over the knothole, proclaiming \"Now, by golly, you'll get no more free lunch for nuthin'!\" Woody then produces a ping pong paddle and a ball, which he knocks into Wally's yard, deftly landing on a plate of boiled eggs. Woody strolls in, looking for the ball, and proceeds to eat all the eggs; he then fires an arrow through the air, snatching a steak out of Wally's hand. When Woody tries to walk off with the meaty prize (\"I always play for big steaks!\"), Wally grabs Woody and his bow, firing the woodpecker himself into the air and into a newsstand across the street. Reading about the ambassador's visit, Woody decides to impersonate him. Dressed in a coat, top hat, and false beard to match the ambassador's photo, Woody arrives on an impossibly long red carpet and barges into Wally's yard, singing Russian-sounding nonsense. The \"ambassador\" leaps into Wally's arms, kisses him several times, then does a Russian \"kick\" dance, booting Wally in the backside several times, finally dispatching him into a glass greenhouse. With the walrus out of the way, Woody sniffs a cooking steak, only to set his beard on fire when he gets too close to the barbecue. Woody slaps the beard onto Wally's face (\"Say! You look really hot with a beard!\") and yanks his chef's hat down. Wally panics and starts to chug around the yard like a train locomotive, smoke pouring from his hat, destroying the barbecue oven (the pieces of which fly into the air, then come down in the shape of a brick cottage, complete with a \"FOR RENT NO DOGS\" sign in front of it). Woody loads all the food into a covered wagon and hitches it to Wally when he passes. Woody gorges himself as Wally blunders his way onto a set of railroad tracks and chugs toward the horizon, as the woodpecker gives out with his trademark laugh. == References == Category:1945 animated films Category:1940s American animated films Category:American films Category:Walter Lantz Productions shorts Category:Woody Woodpecker films Category:Universal Pictures short films Category:Universal Pictures animated short films Category:Animated films about animals Category:Animated films about birds Category:1945 films Category:American animated short films ",
