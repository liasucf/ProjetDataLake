It does not, however, address the issue of incitement to racial hatred. The Australian state of Victoria has addressed the question, however, with its enactment of the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001. ==Finland== In Finland, agitation against an ethnic group () is a crime according to the Criminal Code of Finland's (1889/39 and 2011/511) chapter 11, section 10: Section 10 - Ethnic agitation (511/2011) \u201cA person who makes available to the public or otherwise spreads among the public or keeps available for the public information, an expression of opinion or another message where a certain group is threatened, defamed or insulted on the basis of its race, skin colour, birth status, national or ethnic origin, religion or belief, sexual orientation or disability or a comparable basis, shall be sentenced for ethnic agitation to a fine or to imprisonment for at most two years.\u201d Section 10(a) \u2013 Aggravated ethnic agitation (511/2011) \u201cIf the ethnic agitation involves incitement or enticement (1) to genocide or the preparation of genocide, a crime against humanity, an aggravated crime against humanity, a war crime, an aggravated war crime, murder, or manslaughter committed for terrorist intent, or (2) to serious violence other than what is referred to in paragraph 1 so that the act clearly endangers public order and safety, and the ethnic agitation also when assessed as a whole is aggravated, the offender shall be sentenced for aggravated ethnic agitation to imprisonment for at least four months and at most four years.\u201d == France == Section 24 of the Press Law of 1881 criminalizes incitement to racial discrimination, hatred, or violence on the basis of one's origin or membership in an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group.Loi du 29 juillet 1881 sur la libert\u00e9 de la presse A criminal code provision deems it an offense to engage in similar conduct via private communication.Loi n\u00b0 90-615 du 13 juillet 1990 tendant \u00e0 r\u00e9primer tout acte raciste, antis\u00e9mite ou x\u00e9nophobe In 2002, four Muslim organizations filed a complaint against Michel Houellebecq for stating that Islam was \"stupid\" and \"dangerous\" in an interview. The court found that Houellebecq was not immune from the charge on the grounds of literary immunity or freedom of speech, but acquitted him on the grounds that he criticized Islam rather than individual Muslims.Michael Curtis, Jews, Antisemitism, and the Middle East In 2005, politician Jean Marie Le Pen was convicted of inciting racial hatred, for comments made to Le Monde in 2003 about the consequences of Muslim immigration in France. Similar complaints were brought in 2015 after he compared Muslim street prayers to the Nazi occupation of France in 2010, but he was acquitted. In 2008, actress and animal-rights campaigner Brigitte Bardot was convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred for her criticism concerning the ritual slaughter of sheep during the feast of Eid al-Adha in a letter to then- Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy. Bardot had been convicted of inciting racial hatred on four other occasions over the previous 11 years for criticizing Muslim immigration.the feast of Eid al-Adha ==Germany== ==United Kingdom== Under the law of the United Kingdom, \"incitement to racial hatred\" was established as an offence by the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 17-29 of the Public Order Act 1986. It was first established as a criminal offence in the Race Relations Act 1976. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 made publication of material that incited racial hatred an arrestable offence. This offence refers to: * deliberately provoking hatred of a racial group * distributing racist material to the public * making inflammatory public speeches * creating racist websites on the Internet * inciting inflammatory rumours about an individual or an ethnic group, for the purpose of spreading racial discontent. Laws against incitement to hatred against religions were later established under the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006. However this legislation is not present in Scotland. == See also == * Demagogue * Hate speech * International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, (Article 20, 2) * Public Order Act 1986 * Crime and Disorder Act 1998 * Religious intolerance ==References== ==External links== * Government information on the race relations act * Commission for racial equality * Crime Reduction Toolkits: Racist Incidents and Harassment Category:Race and law Category:Hate speech Category:Censorship fr:Incitation \u00e0 la haine raciale ru:\u0420\u0430\u0437\u0436\u0438\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438 ",
