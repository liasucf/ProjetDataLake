It airs at Thursdays at 23:30 on JTBC. == History == Host Lee Kyu-yeon said in a Social Live that he has been inspired by Spotlight, the Boston Globe investigative team which uncovered the Catholic Church sexual abuse cases, which in turn inspired the 2015 Academy Award-winning film Spotlight. Lee also heads JTBC News' Exploration and Planning Bureau, which produces the program. He describes Spotlight as a program that covers various fields such as social issues, welfare, science and technology. It was going to be called just Spotlight at first, but Sohn Suk-hee, JTBC News' president at the time, suggested that he change it to Lee Kyu-yeon's Spotlight. == Broadcast times == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Original network !Broadcast period !Airtime |- | rowspan=\"6\" |JTBC |May 31, 2015 \u2013 June 28, 2015 |Sundays at 20:00-21:45 |- |July 5, 2015-October 18. 2015 |Sundays at 23:00-24:10 |- |October 23, 2015 \u2013 March 25, 2016 |Fridays at 21:40-23:00 |- |April 3, 2016 \u2013 June 18, 2017 |Thursdays at 21:40-23:00 |- |June 22, 2017 \u2013 May 14, 2020 |Thursdays at 21:30-23:00 |- |May 21, 2020 \u2013 present |Thursdays at 23:00 |} == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year !Award !Category !Recipient !Result !Remarks |- |2019 |55th Baeksang Arts Awards |Best Educational Program |Lee Kyu-yeon's Spotlight (5.18 Secret Agent) | | |} == Notes == * Its slogan is \"Shed light on the world\", as seen on its opening title. * Previous episodes can be viewed through its official website, YouTube channel or the JTBC Culture YouTube channel == References == Category:Investigative journalism Category:JTBC original programming ",
