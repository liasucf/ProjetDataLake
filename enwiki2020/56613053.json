He is best known for leading the salvage operation of the wrecked Costa Concordia in September 2013. The ship had collided with rocks a year previously, and had been aground for 20 months before its successful salvage. The salvage was preceded by 16 months of preparatory work, and took a total of 19 hours to complete. In 2015 Sloane won the German Sea Prize for this salvage action. == External links == * * Captain Nicholas Sloane at sloanemarine.com == References == Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Zambian emigrants to South Africa ",
