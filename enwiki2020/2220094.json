    "text": "The Geumho River flows through North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea, and drains into the Nakdong River. It rises in the hilly area of western Pohang, flows west for 116 kilometers before its meeting with the Nakdong in western Daegu. It drains an area of more than 2,000 square kilometers. Notable tributaries include the Sincheon, which flows north through Daegu. The name Geumho-gang means \"river of the zither-shaped lake,\" a reference to its oxbow curve in northern Daegu. Much of the riverbank in Daegu has been transformed into parkland. ==Ecological conditions== The Geumho has been among the most polluted rivers in South Korea largely because of industrial waste from nearby large-scale dyeing operations. This is especially important because the Geumho is a tributary of the Nakdong river. Samples of water have consistently received low grades on the water grading system of the Korean government.[Hot Issue] 'Moaning of Pollution \u2026every region avoid its charge DongA Ilbo 2001-05-14 http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD\u2223=sec&sid1;=102&oid;=020&aid;=0000063983 Communities allege that the water quality problem stemmed from the development of the Wicheon complex.[\uc9c0\uc790\uccb4] '\ubb3c \uc2f8\uc6c0' \uc2ec\uac01\ud558\ub2e4 Hankook Ilbo 2001-03-21 http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD\u2223=sec&sid1;=102&oid;=038&aid;=0000059860 The regional environment office of Daegu reported a new ecological plan to improve water quality around the rivers in 2008, including improvement of water circulation and the rivers' ecosystems.Change river of Geumho and Hyeongsan into 'Good' quality living melanian snail<\uae08\ud638\uac15.\ud615\uc0b0\uac15\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc2ac\uae30 \uc0ac\ub294 '\uc88b\uc740\ubb3c\u2019\ud750\ub978\ub2e4> \uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4 2008-01-08 ==See also== *Rivers of Korea *List of Korea-related topics *Geography of South Korea ==References== Category:Rivers of North Gyeongsang Province Category:Rivers of Daegu Category:Rivers of South Korea ",
