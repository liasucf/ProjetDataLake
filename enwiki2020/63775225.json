It includes pieces by Castilian and Catalan authors made between 1438 and 1470. The codex, which retains the original binding, has passed through the archives of the Marqu\u00e8s of Barber\u00e0 and the Library of Catalonia, is in the library of the monastery of Montserrat since 1956. The songbook is compiled by one hand. A section with anonymous pieces presents author variants, in poems to be attributed to the compiler.
