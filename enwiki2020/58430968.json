His father, who met the Bulgarian international while working at a bar in Barcelona, wanted to legally name his son Stoichkov; this decision was vetoed by his mother. Stoichkov finished his formation with RCD Espanyol, also in the Catalan capital. On 20 July 2012 he joined Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B side CP Cacere\u00f1o, but spent the vast majority of his spell with the reserves, however. On 5 September 2013 Stoichkov signed for Tercera Divisi\u00f3n side CD San Roque, club he already represented as a youth. Ahead of the 2014\u201315 campaign, he moved abroad for the first time in his career and joined Gibraltarian side Europa FC, playing in the UEFA Europa League qualifying stages before rejoining San Roque in December 2014. On 28 January 2016, Stoichkov moved to Real Balomp\u00e9dica Linense in the third level. He immediately became a starter for the side, and scored ten goals for them in the 2017\u201318 campaign. On 6 July 2018, Stoichkov signed a four-year contract with RCD Mallorca, newly promoted to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. He made his professional debut on 7 September, coming on as a second-half substitute for Carlos Castro in a 1\u20130 home win against C\u00e1diz CF. Stoichkov scored his first professional goal on 27 October 2018, netting the equalizer in a 2\u20132 home draw against UD Las Palmas. He contributed with three league goals during the campaign as his side achieved promotion to La Liga. On 20 July 2019, Stoichkov joined AD Alcorc\u00f3n in the second division on a one-year loan deal. In his year with the team from the Community of Madrid, he finished joint fourth in the league's top scorers with 16 goals. On 5 October 2020, Stoichkov joined CE Sabadell FC on loan for the 2020\u201321 campaign. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from San Roque, C\u00e1diz Category:Spanish footballers Category:Andalusian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Divisiones Regionales de F\u00fatbol players Category:CP Cacere\u00f1o players Category:CD San Roque footballers Category:Real Balomp\u00e9dica Linense footballers Category:RCD Mallorca players Category:AD Alcorc\u00f3n footballers Category:CE Sabadell FC footballers Category:Europa F.C. players Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Gibraltar Category:Expatriate footballers in Gibraltar ",
