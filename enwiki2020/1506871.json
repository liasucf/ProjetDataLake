While it is a sequel to the 2001 television series, Meteor Garden which is based on Japanese sh\u014djo manga series, , Meteor Garden II is an original series that is not based on the Manga. It was produced by Comic Ritz International Production with Angie Chai (\u67f4\u667a\u5c4f) as producer and directed by Wang Ming-tai.

The prequel Meteor Garden was broadcast from 12 April 2001 to 16 August 2001 and a supplementary mini-series, Meteor Rain, was produced in 2001 and broadcast following the main series. This is the second live-action television adaptation of the manga, following its prequel Meteor Garden and followed by Japanese Hana Yori Dango, its sequel Hana Yori Dango Returns and South Korean Boys Over Flowers. However, it follows an original story penned by writer-producer Angie Chai when the rights to use the F4 name was extended. Despite the increased budget and new lead cast member Michelle Saram, the series received mixed fan reactions due to the original storyline which deviated greatly from the original manga. ==Synopsis== The story opens with the graduation of F4 from Ying De University and subsequently focuses on their life after graduation. It follows the blossoming love story of Shan Cai (Barbie Shu) and Dao Ming Si (Jerry Yan). The story takes the group to Barcelona where Dao Ming Si had a car accident and suffers memory loss. He then meets another girl, Ye Sha (Michelle Saram), the driver of the other car. Shan Cai on the other hand tries her best to help Dao Ming Si regain his memory. A swimming accident helps Dao Ming Si regain his memory and returns to his first love Shan Cai. ==Cast== *Jerry Yan as Dao Ming Si *Barbie Hsu as Shan Cai *Vic Chou as Hua Ze Lei *Ken Chu as Xi Men *Vanness Wu as Mei Zuo *Michelle Saram as Ye Sha ==Production== Meteor Garden II was produced by Angie Chai, the original producer behind Meteor Garden.
