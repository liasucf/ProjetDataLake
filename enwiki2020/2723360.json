    "text": "Rigoberto L\u00f3pez P\u00e9rez (May 13, 1929 \u2013 September 21, 1956) was a Nicaraguan poet, artist and composer. He assassinated Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda, the longtime dictator of Nicaragua. On September 21, 1981, 25 years after his death, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua declared Rigoberto L\u00f3pez P\u00e9rez a National Hero by means of Decree no. 825. ==Early life== L\u00f3pez was born and raised in Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua; son of Soledad L\u00f3pez and Francisco P\u00e9rez. L\u00f3pez published his first poem, \"Confesi\u00f3n de un Soldado\" (Confession of a Soldier), at the age of 17 in 1946. In 1948 he formed part of a 6-member musical group called \"Buenos Aires\". That same year he learned to play the violin, which he played in the group. L\u00f3pez composed music, mostly romantic, including \"Claridad\" and \"Si el vino me hace llorar\" which Buenos Aires released on a radio station called Radio Colonial. Lop\u00e9z's musical influences included Beethoven; Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, a Nicaraguan poet, often referred to as the \"Father of Modernism\", was a major literary influence to him. Lop\u00e9z would often collaborate in publications such as \"El Cronista\" and \"El Centroamericano\". L\u00f3pez's girlfriend, Amparo Zelaya Castro, was the sister of Armando Zelaya, a journalist who drove L\u00f3pez to the Casa del Obrero where he later shot Somoza. ==Assassination of Somoza== On September 21, 1956, L\u00f3pez was able to infiltrate a party in the Club Social de Obreros de Le\u00f3n that was attended by President Somoza and shot him in the chest. L\u00f3pez was instantly killed in a hail of bullets and Somoza died a few days later in the Panama Canal Zone hospital. Somoza's son, Luis Somoza Debayle, replaced his father as president. ==Legacy== In April 1979, at the peak of the Sandinista's Revolutionary War, one of the five FSLN's Regional Commands in control of 24 cities altogether, was named after him. Unluckily, the FSLN's \"Rigoberto Lopez Perez\" Western Command was captured in full in a safe house in the suburbs of Leon and killed in captivity by dictator Somoza's forces. The cold-blooded massacre of this Command, made up of Oscar Perez Cassar, Roger Deshon, Araceli Perez Darias, Idania Fernandez, Carlos Manuel Jarquin and Edgard Lang Sacasa, enraged the Sandinistas and accelerated the fall of the Somoza regime. After the Sandinista victory in July, Nicaragua's national stadium in Managua, used as a venue for baseball and football as well as concerts and other events, was named after Lop\u00e9z, but on November 20, 1998, the 50th anniversary of the founding of the stadium, then-President Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n issued a decree changing the stadium's name to Estadio Nacional Dennis Mart\u00ednez. In 2006 a monument dedicated to L\u00f3pez was built in his honor in Managua. In Italy, in the 1970s, Marcello De Angelis, now parliamentarian of PDL, who then was a songwriter engaged in the political movement Third Position, wrote a song dedicated to him, whose title is \"Il poeta\" (The Poet). ==References== ==External links== * The will of Rigoberto L\u00f3pez P\u00e9rez * Rigoberto: Notas para una Biograf\u00eda * Rigoberto L\u00f3pez P\u00e9rez's Death Letter Addressed to his Mother *Portrait of P\u00e9rez *Photos of the Rigoberto L\u00f3pez P\u00e9rez Monument *Song by Marcello De Angelis Category:1929 births Category:1956 deaths Category:People from Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua Category:20th-century Nicaraguan poets Category:Nicaraguan male poets Category:Nicaraguan composers Category:Nicaraguan musicians Category:Nicaraguan assassins Category:Assassins of presidents Category:Murder in 1956 Category:Deaths by firearm in Nicaragua Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers Category:20th-century composers Category:National Heroines and Heroes of Nicaragua Category:20th- century male writers Category:1956 crimes in Nicaragua Category:1956 murders in North America Category:1950s murders in Nicaragua ",
