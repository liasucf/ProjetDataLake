    "text": "In mathematics, an Orlicz sequence space is any of certain class of linear spaces of scalar-valued sequences, endowed with a special norm, specified below, under which it forms a Banach space. Orlicz sequence spaces generalize the \\ell_p spaces, and as such play an important role in functional analysis. ==Definition== Fix \\mathbb{K}\\in\\\\{\\mathbb{R},\\mathbb{C}\\\\} so that \\mathbb{K} denotes either the real or complex scalar field. We say that a function M:[0,\\infty)\\to[0,\\infty) is an Orlicz function if it is continuous, nondecreasing, and (perhaps nonstrictly) convex, with M(0)=0 and \\textstyle\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}M(t)=\\infty. In the special case where there exists b>0 with M(t)=0 for all t\\in[0,b] it is called degenerate. In what follows, unless otherwise stated we'll assume all Orlicz functions are nondegenerate. This implies M(t)>0 for all t>0. For each scalar sequence (a_n)_{n=1}^\\infty\\in\\mathbb{K}^\\mathbb{N} set :\\left\\|(a_n)_{n=1}^\\infty\\right\\|_M=\\inf\\left\\\\{\\rho>0:\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty M(|a_n|/\\rho)\\leqslant 1\\right\\\\}. We then define the Orlicz sequence space with respect to M, denoted \\ell_M, as the linear space of all (a_n)_{n=1}^\\infty\\in\\mathbb{K}^\\mathbb{N} such that \\textstyle\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty M(|a_n|/\\rho)<\\infty for some \\rho>0, endowed with the norm \\|\\cdot\\|_M. Two other definitions will be important in the ensuing discussion. An Orlicz function M is said to satisfy the \u03942 condition at zero whenever :\\limsup_{t\\to 0}\\frac{M(2t)}{M(t)}<\\infty. We denote by h_M the subspace of scalar sequences (a_n)_{n=1}^\\infty\\in\\ell_M such that \\textstyle\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty M(|a_n|/\\rho)<\\infty for all \\rho>0. ==Properties== The space \\ell_M is a Banach space, and it generalizes the classical \\ell_p spaces in the following precise sense: when M(t)=t^p, 1\\leqslant p<\\infty, then \\|\\cdot\\|_M coincides with the \\ell_p-norm, and hence \\ell_M=\\ell_p; if M is the degenerate Orlicz function then \\|\\cdot\\|_M coincides with the \\ell_\\infty-norm, and hence \\ell_M=\\ell_\\infty in this special case, and h_M=c_0 when M is degenerate. In general, the unit vectors may not form a basis for \\ell_M, and hence the following result is of considerable importance. Theorem 1. If M is an Orlicz function then the following conditions are equivalent: :(i) M satisfies the \u03942 condition at zero, i.e. \\textstyle\\limsup_{t\\to 0}M(2t)/M(t)<\\infty. : (ii) For every \\lambda>0 there exists positive constants K=K(\\lambda) and b=b(\\lambda) so that M(\\lambda t)\\leqslant KM(t) for all t\\in[0,b]. : (iii) \\textstyle\\limsup_{t\\to 0}tM'(t)/M(t)<\\infty (where M' is a nondecreasing function defined everywhere except perhaps on a countable set, where instead we can take the right-hand derivative which is defined everywhere). : (iv) \\ell_M=h_M. : (v) The unit vectors form a boundedly complete symmetric basis for \\ell_M. : (vi) \\ell_M is separable. : (vii) \\ell_M fails to contain any subspace isomorphic to \\ell_\\infty. : (viii) (a_n)_{n=1}^\\infty\\in\\ell_M if and only if \\textstyle\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty M(|a_n|)<\\infty. Two Orlicz functions M and N satisfying the \u03942 condition at zero are called equivalent whenever there exist are positive constants A,B,b>0 such that AN(t)\\leqslant M(t)\\leqslant BN(t) for all t\\in[0,b]. This is the case if and only if the unit vector bases of \\ell_M and \\ell_N are equivalent. \\ell_M can be isomorphic to \\ell_N without their unit vector bases being equivalent. (See the example below of an Orlicz sequence space with two nonequivalent symmetric bases.) Theorem 2. Let M be an Orlicz function. Then \\ell_M is reflexive if and only if : \\liminf_{t\\to 0}\\frac{tM'(t)}{M(t)}>1\\;\\; and \\;\\;\\limsup_{t\\to 0}\\frac{tM'(t)}{M(t)}<\\infty. Theorem 3 (K. J. Lindberg). Let X be an infinite-dimensional closed subspace of a separable Orlicz sequence space \\ell_M. Then X has a subspace Y isomorphic to some Orlicz sequence space \\ell_N for some Orlicz function N satisfying the \u03942 condition at zero. If furthermore X has an unconditional basis then Y may be chosen to be complemented in X, and if X has a symmetric basis then X itself is isomorphic to \\ell_N. Theorem 4 (Lindenstrauss/Tzafriri). Every separable Orlicz sequence space \\ell_M contains a subspace isomorphic to \\ell_p for some 1\\leqslant p<\\infty. Corollary. Every infinite-dimensional closed subspace of a separable Orlicz sequence space contains a further subspace isomorphic to \\ell_p for some 1\\leqslant p<\\infty. Note that in the above Theorem 4, the copy of \\ell_p may not always be chosen to be complemented, as the following example shows. Example (Lindenstrauss/Tzafriri). There exists a separable and reflexive Orlicz sequence space \\ell_M which fails to contain a complemented copy of \\ell_p for any 1\\leqslant p\\leqslant\\infty. This same space \\ell_M contains at least two nonequivalent symmetric bases. Theorem 5 (K. J. Lindberg & Lindenstrauss/Tzafriri). If \\ell_M is an Orlicz sequence space satisfying \\textstyle\\liminf_{t\\to 0}tM'(t)/M(t)=\\limsup_{t\\to 0}tM'(t)/M(t) (i.e., the two-sided limit exists) then the following are all true. : (i) \\ell_M is separable. : (ii) \\ell_M contains a complemented copy of \\ell_p for some 1\\leqslant p<\\infty. : (iii) \\ell_M has a unique symmetric basis (up to equivalence). Example. For each 1\\leqslant p<\\infty, the Orlicz function M(t)=t^p/(1-\\log (t)) satisfies the conditions of Theorem 5 above, but is not equivalent to t^p. ==References== *Lindenstrauss, J., and L.
