    "text": "The Swan View Tunnel is a former railway tunnel located on the southern side of the Jane Brook valley in the outer Perth suburb of Swan View in the John Forrest National Park on the edge of the Darling Scarp. After its closure as a railway tunnel, it reopened as part of the John Forrest Heritage Trail, a rail trail. Prior to the construction of tunnels and the sinking of the Subiaco railway station in 1999, the Swan View Tunnel was the only tunnel on the Western Australian railway network. ==Construction== Western portal in January 2006 Swan View Tunnel was built on an alignment which replaced the original Eastern Railway passing through Smiths Mill, (now Glen Forrest), and Mundaring. The project to build the new line, including the Swan View Tunnel, was managed by the Engineer-in-Chief of the Western Australian Government Railways, C Y O'Connor. The tunnel was erroneously stated in contemporary reporting to be 13 chains (858 ft, 262m) long.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article37787153 Modern authorities give the length as .http://inherit.stateheritage.wa.gov.au/Public/Inventory/Details/3876ec46-d6d0-4737-815d-09fab888c676 Inspection of open source aerial imagery confirms that the tunnel is in length. Work began in 1894, with the two bores meeting on 18 April 1895. The tunnel opened on 22 February 1896.Eastern Railway Deviation Heritage Council of WA The unstable nature of the jointed granite, along with clay seams, caused difficulties during construction of the tunnel. A masonry-lined face prevented rock falls, but reduced the inner diameter. The deviation from the original railway line, and the tunnel in particular, was a \"significant technical feat for the time\"; Engineers Australia awarded the deviation an Engineering Heritage Marker as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program. === Problems === The tunnel's small diameter combined with the steep gradient (1:49) to cause smoke accumulation. Incidents involving near- asphyxiation of train crews started in 1896, and continued throughout the tunnel's operating life.Tobin, Jack 1962 \"The Swan View Tunnel\" The Westland September 1999 p.7-11 The first serious incident of this nature was in 1903.Swan Express 2 October 1909 p.3a, 4a. Articles on ventilation problems in the tunnel The tunnel's design was incompatible with the ASG class Garratt steam locomotives used by the Western Australian Government Railways in the 1940s. The subsequent Royal Commission into the ASG dealt with design of the locomotive, and the very dangerous clearances. \u2013 specifically unions requesting the commissioner to travel through the tunnel in an ASG to understand the context The worst accident in the tunnel was on 5 November 1942, when both drivers and firemen were asphyxiated by carbon monoxide, one driver dying, when a fully laden double-header train passed through the tunnel at walking pace.Duxbury, George (2001) Rail against time Landscope, Autumn 2001, p.37-40 Further cases occurred in 1943 and 1944 on up trains. Subsequent industrial strikes, Royal Commission and union agitation for the locomotives' withdrawal was a significant issue in the 1940s. ==Deviation== Between 1934 and 1945, a signal cabin was located at Tunnel Junction, on the eastern end of the tunnel, for managing the transition from the tunnel's single line to the dual lines of the system. The single line tunnel was considered unsafe for eastbound (climbing) trains, and a diversion was added on the northern side of the hill that the tunnel passed through. It was known as the deviation, and due to rock instability included a fence of 16 wires to be used as a detector of rock falls. The diversion was completed on 25 November 1945.WAGR Publicity (N.D.) Welcome to the Westland, Western Australian Government Railways Overnight Express and connecting link for interstate travel ==Railway closure== The railway line through the tunnel was lifted after the closing of the older and steeper Eastern Railway and the opening of the Avon Valley diversion that opened in February 1966. After the 1960s, gates/doors were put at either end of the tunnel though these were later removed.Ellis, David 1997 \"Terror tunnel\" South Western Times 8 April 1997 page 30 The tunnel remains intact and has reopened as part of the John Forrest Heritage Trail, part of the larger Railway Reserve Heritage Trail.Railway Reserve Heritage Trail Shire of Mundaring During the 1990s, the government authority in which the tunnel land was vested, the Department of Environment & Conservation allowed a number of night time \"ghost walks\" in the tunnel as part of the Hills Forest programmes. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * Category:Eastern Railway (Western Australia) Category:Swan View, Western Australia Category:Tunnels completed in 1895 Category:Railway tunnels in Western Australia Category:Disused tunnels in Australia Category:Recipients of Engineers Australia engineering heritage markers ",
