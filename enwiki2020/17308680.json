MMU offers 5-year bachelor's degree programs. Starting from 2012, MMU, administered by the Ministry of Transportation, offers two-year post-graduate diplomas in various marine and naval disciplines. In 2007, the school had about 1,800 graduate students, pursuing international STCW-95-standards compliant maritime education. ==History== MMU was officially established on 10 June 2002 by the military government per the Myanmar Maritime University Act (The State Peace and Development Council Law No. 1/2002). The official mission of MMU is to \"produce well competent qualified naval architects, engineers and scientists\". On 1 August 2002, the university first opened its doors inside the compound of Yangon Institute of Marine Technology, in Sinmalike, Yangon. Since March 2004, the university has been relocated to its present purpose-built campus in Thanlyin near Thilawa port, the country's largest port. ==Admissions== MMU is one of the most selective universities in the country. Admissions are based primarily on the marks received in the Burmese university entrance examination (Matriculation Exam). The university does maintain a 20% quota of female students in its annual student intake, and all students must pass an eyesight exam. As many of the graduates receive job offers from foreign shipping firms, admission to the university is highly competitive. In 2006, the minimum university entrance exam score necessary to be admitted was 458 out of 600 marks (up from 443 marks in 2005) despite an increase in admissions to 450 students per year from 350 the year earlier. In 2008, the admission marks were 473 out of 600.The minimum entrance mark is 491 out of 600 in 2010. ==Programs== Onwards 2012,MMU offers six six-year bachelor's degree programs and two two-year post-graduate diplomas. Last batch of students with 5-year degree will graduated in 2017 February. The university's syllabus, coursework and practical training are in keeping with the standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers 1995 (STCW), an international convention developed by the International Maritime Organization that sets qualifications and training standards for personnel serving aboard seagoing merchant ships. ===Engineering=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=\"300\"|Program !width=\"50\"|Bachelor's !width=\"30\"|Type !width=\"30\"|Duration |- | Naval Architecture | B.E. | FT | 5 Yrs |- | Marine Engineering | B.E. | FT | 5 Yrs |- | Port and Harbour Engineering | B.E. | FT | 5 Yrs |- | River and Coastal Engineering | B.E. | FT | 5 Yrs |- | Marine Electrical Systems and Electronics | B.E. | FT | 5 Yrs |- | Nautical Science | B.Sc.
