At its eastern terminus is DeKalb Memorial Park. No section of SR 260 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense. ==History== SR 260 was established in 1949 on a routing that had the same western terminus at US 23/SR 42, but went further to the east, to an intersection with SR 12\\. At that time, the entire route was paved. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== 260 Category:Transportation in DeKalb County, Georgia Category:Roads in Atlanta ",
