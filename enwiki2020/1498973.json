It is bordered by the comarques of Vinalop\u00f3 Mitj\u00e0 and Alacant\u00ed on the north and Vega Baja del Segura on the south. Its capital is the city of Elx/Elche, with a population of 232,517 in 2019.Official estimate as at 1 January 2019: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica, Madrid, 2019. The other major towns in the comarca are Crevillent and Santa Pola. Vinalop\u00f3 river flows through this comarca giving its name to it (Baix Vinalop\u00f3 is Valencian for \"Lower Vinalop\u00f3\"), even though nowadays is just a tiny stream more than a proper river. The territory is mostly flat except for some of the last ranges belonging to the Baetic System which appear here near the border with the neighbouring comarcas Vinalop\u00f3 Mitj\u00e0, following a general southwest-northeast trend. The highest peaks are found in the Serra de Crevillent, a mountain range close to Crevillent, being its highest the Sant Gaiet\u00e0 with its 816 metres, a local hiking attraction. Its climate is dry, with scarce rainfalls\u2014below the Mediterranean climate threshold\u2014which happen mostly in Autumn and Spring amounting an average of 250\u2013300 mm per year and showing relatively warm mean temperatures. Among the herbaceous species, esparto and shrub deserve to be mentioned due to their industrial value in the past. Some important natural places are the swamps in the lower part of the comarca known as El Fondo Natural Park and the Salines de Santa Pola Natural Park, both Ramsar sites. The comarca is highly industrial, especially in its capital, Elx/Elche, and also in the town of Crevillent. Agriculture is also an important activity in the area. In the coastline around Santa Pola the main activity is tourism, fisheries and sea salt.
