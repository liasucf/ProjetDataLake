CBC Music, March 14, 2015. Escamilla also won a Canadian Folk Music Award for World Music Solo Artist of the Year at the 10th Canadian Folk Music Awards in 2014.\"Quique Escamilla gana premio Juno a lo mejor de la m\u00fasica en Canad\u00e1\". 20 minutos, March 15, 2015. ==Early years== Born and raised in Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez, Chiapas, Mexico.\"Mexico's Escamilla sings message of social justice\". Victoria Times-Colonist, July 16, 2014. He began playing and making music in the early 1990s as a teenager. He first learned to sing traditional Mexican ballads his mother taught him as a young kid. Eventually he taught himself how to play guitar and formed his first rock band at 14 years old, which covered punk rock and heavy metal songs. In his early twenties he became interested in playing all kinds of music, from blues, reggae, jazz, to pop and world music. He moved and lived in Mexico City for a couple of years before moving to Canada in December 2007\u2014settling in Toronto, Ontario. ==Albums== He recorded, mixed, mastered and produced his self-titled debut EP in his Toronto bedroom. That EP was released in Toronto, along with a live concert recorded by CBC Radio One's Canada Live at Lula Lounge in January 2012. The recording from this concert was featured on CBC's Big City Small World. He followed up with a studio production on 500 Years of Night in April 2014. Such album represented a political statement from Escamilla. At his live shows, he has stated his support towards the oppressed indigenous people who struggle against racism in his \"homeland of Chiapas, the rest of Mexico, and across the Americas\". His album's commentary also sounds strongly influenced by the message and struggle of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN). Its booklet included a powerful photo collection of the Chiapas' movement, taken by the renowned Mexican photographer, Marco Antonio Cruz\u2014winner of the Grange Prize in Canada and photography director of the political magazine Proceso in Mexico City.
