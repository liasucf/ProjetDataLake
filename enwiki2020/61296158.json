Hull (born 1970) is an American mycologist and Professor in the Department of Biomolecular Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. ==Education and career== Christina Hull completed her B.S. degree from the University of Utah in 1992. She then went on to complete a Ph.D. with Alexander D. Johnson at the University of California, San Francisco in 2000. Her thesis was titled \"Identification and characterization of a mating type-like locus in the \"asexual\" pathogenic yeast Candida albicans\". She then went on to complete a postdoctoral fellowship with Joseph Heitman at Duke University from 2000 to 2003. She is now a professor at the Departmnet of Biomolecular Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. ==Research== Hull's research focuses on fungal development, with a particular focus on how fungi enter and leave the spore form. Her group primarily does this work using the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus. ==Notable publications== *Giles SS, Dagenais TRT... Hull CM (2009).
