Russell.Kate Erbland, \u2018Joshy\u2019 Director Jeff Baena: Why Marketing Can Ruin a Movie, Indie Wire, 10 August 2016. == Personal life == Baena was born in Miami, Florida. He grew up in South Florida, and later studied film at New York University. He lives and works in California. He has been dating actress and comedian Aubrey Plaza since 2011. They live together and often work together. == Career == After graduating, Baena moved to Los Angeles to start building his career. He became a production assistant for Robert Zemeckis, working on a number of films.David Zax, How A Freak Eye Injury Became A Career Turning Point For The Director Of \"Joshy\", Fast Company, 3 February 2016. After working with Zemeckis, Baena took a job as an assistant editor for writer-director David O. Russell. After a year-and-a-half of working together, a minor car accident injured one of Baena's eyes. Partially to keep his spirits up and pass the time during his recovery from that, Russell began discussing story ideas with Baena. The two ended up collaborating on four scripts together. One of those four scripts was I Heart Huckabees, which Russell directed in 2004. At the same time, Baena began to focus his career on writing and wrote the zombie comedy Life After Beth, which would wind up being his debut feature as a director. Baena had planned for Joshy to be his directorial debut, but actor and collaborator Adam Pally had to pull out for personal reasons. Baena then decided to work on Life After Beth, which he had begun writing in 2003. The next film for Baena was The Little Hours, which was released in 2017. The film features actors Alison Brie, Dave Franco, Kate Micucci, Aubrey Plaza, John C. Reilly and Molly Shannon along with multiple cameos.Dave McNary, Alison Brie\u2019s Dark Comedy \u2018The Little Hours\u2019 Selling at Cannes, Variety, 26 April 2016.
