    "text": "Dub War are a four-piece metal band from Newport, South Wales. Formed in 1993, the band's musical style is a mix of metal, punk, and reggae. ==Biography== Dub War formed in 1993 in Wales. The band released two albums, via the metal label Earache Records; Pain, released in 1995 and Wrong Side of Beautiful in 1996. Dub War split in 1999 after disputes with their label. After a short stint with the supergroup Mass Mental, lead singer Benji Webbe went on to form Skindred with Jeff Rose and Martyn Ford, although the latter left early on citing mistreatment from their label. In 2010, Digby Pearson of Earache Records approached Webbe with the idea of releasing a DVD of the then last Dub War show and previous video. The DVD was released as a box set including a CD of rare recordings. The band performed a low-key show in Newport in 2014 in a one-off reunion, using Mikee Gregory on drums, replacing Martin 'Ginge' Ford. However, in May 2015, after Ghost Town withdrew their spot, Dub War were announced for a special half-hour set on the 4th Stage at Download Festival.Dub War reunite for Download Festival 2015 Virtual Festivals. 24 May 2014.
