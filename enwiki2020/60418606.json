Currently, both chambers of the Italian Parliament, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic, are elected at the same time by universal and direct suffrage. 375 deputies (members of the Chamber of Deputies) and 109 senators (members of the Senate of the Republic) are elected in single-member constituencies and the rest from party lists. (In addition, there are also several so-called \"senators for life\". These include former Italian presidents and people appointed by presidential decree in recognition of special service to the country.) === Voter and candidate eligibility === Any Italian citizen over the age of 18 on the election day is eligible to elect the deputies, and any Italian citizen over the age of 25 on the election day is eligible to elect the senators.
