    "text": "Harrogate Town Association Football Club is a professional association football club based in the spa town of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England. The club competes in League Two, the fourth tier of English football from the 2020\u201321 season after winning the 2019\u201320 National League play-offs. The club is nicknamed \"Town\" and also the \"Sulphurites\", due to Harrogate's famous sulphur springs. The club's colours are black and yellow and they play their home games at Wetherby Road, though for a short period at the start of the 2020\u201321 season, the club shared Doncaster Rovers' Keepmoat Stadium while a new pitch was laid. Formed in 1914, the club entered the Northern League, but were unable to compete due to the outbreak of World War I. They eventually played their first competitive fixture in the West Riding League in August 1919. They were a founding member of the Yorkshire League the following year and also entered the Midland League in 1921. They finished as Yorkshire League champions in 1926\u201327, but were disbanded in 1932. Harrogate Hotspurs were founded in 1935 and changed their name to Harrogate Town after football returned at the end of World War II, joining the West Yorkshire Association League. They entered the Yorkshire League again in 1957, before becoming founder members of the Northern Counties East League in 1982 and a founding member of the Northern Premier League in 1987. They won the Northern Premier League Division One title in 2001\u201302 and became founder members of the Conference North in 2004. They won the National League North play-offs in 2018 and then secured a place in the Football League for the first time with victory in the 2020 National League play-off final. ==History== People in the town of Harrogate had tried to put together a football team as far back as 1907 but it took until 1914 for Harrogate A.F.C. to be founded. They were entered into the Northern Football League in 1914, and were set to play their home fixtures at the County Ground, but the First World War meant all fixtures were postponed. After the First World War, Robert Ackrill Breare instigated a meeting to discuss putting the club back together. Breare later became the secretary of the club, which entered into the West Riding League. ===Early years=== Harrogate played their first competitive fixture on 30 August 1919 at Starbeck Lane Ground against Horsforth. They won the game 1\u20130 and the scorer was L. Craven with a headed goal. They were entered into the FA Cup the same year, losing to South Kirkby Colliery 4\u20130 in a 1Q replay. Harrogate also won their first trophy, the Whitworth Cup, with a 4\u20130 victory against Ripon City. For the 1920\u201321 season they were one of the founding teams in the new Yorkshire League, yet they also continued to field a team in the West Riding League. The club had relocated to a new ground: Wetherby Road. Around the holiday periods, they took part in friendlies against higher league opposition including Liverpool at their Anfield ground, and another at fellow Yorkshire side Sheffield United in front of 15,000 fans. They moved league once again for their third season, leaving the West Riding League and moving into the Midland Football League. It included the reserve teams of Nottingham Forest, Sheffield Wednesday and Barnsley. The club remained in the Yorkshire League, fielding a reserve team. However, the club resigned from the Midland League after only one season and reverting to fielding a first team in the Yorkshire League. The West Riding County Challenge Cup was won by Harrogate in 1925, with their 3\u20131 victory against Fryston Colliery at Elland Road. League victory was secured in 1926\u201327, as Harrogate became the Yorkshire League champions, with Bob Morphet scoring 44 goals. The club then moved into the Northern Football League. Their second West Riding County Challenge Cup was won the same season against Selby Town. The team disbanded in 1932. ===Climbing the pyramid=== The town's club was brought back in 1935 as Harrogate Hotspurs. After the Second World War, the club was renamed as Harrogate Town and played in the West Yorkshire Association Football League. Harrogate Town joined the Yorkshire League again in 1957. They spent many years in the Yorkshire League during the 1960s and 1970s, and then became a founding member of the new Northern Counties East Football League in 1982. The club was looking to climb the newly instated football pyramid and so began to improve their ground, installing floodlights. They played a friendly to mark the occasion against Leeds United, with Eddie Gray being the first to switch the lights on. After a West Riding County Cup win in 1986, and five seasons in the Northern Counties East League, they became founding members of the Northern Premier League in 1987\u201388, after having been invited to join the new league. In 1990 the club became a limited company to fund construction of a new main stand, and in the same year the club won the Northern Premier League First Division Cup. They spent 15 seasons in this league, twice narrowly avoiding relegation back to the Northern Counties East League. However, they won promotion to the Premier Division in 2001\u201302 after finishing as champions. During their first season in that division they finished sixth, and for the first time in the club's history they reached the first round of the FA Cup, losing 5\u20131 to Farnborough Town of the Football Conference. Town also won the West Riding County Cup in both the 2001\u201302 and 2002\u201303 seasons. ===Conference North=== Harrogate Town take on FC Halifax Town at the Shay in 2016. After finishing fifth in the Premier Division in 2003\u201304, the club became founders of the newly established Conference North in 2004. During their FA Cup run in the 2005\u201306 season, Harrogate were drawn to play at Torquay United, their first cup game against Football League opposition. After drawing 1\u20131 at Plainmoor, they lost 6\u20135 on penalties after a 0\u20130 draw in the replay.Harrogate 0\u20130 Torquay (aet) BBC Sport At the end of the season the club finished fifth and qualified for the promotion play-offs, but lost 1\u20130 to eventual winners Stafford Rangers. At the end of the 2009\u201310 season the club finished bottom of the Conference North and were due to be relegated. However, after Northwich Victoria were demoted due to financial problems, the club were reprieved.Harrogate Town reprieved from relegation \u2013 BBC Sport Website Before the start of the 2011\u201312 season, Bill Fotherby handed control of the club to Irving Weaver, father of manager Simon Weaver.

The 2011\u201312 season ended in a relegation dogfight, Harrogate saved on the last day thanks to a 5\u20130 away win at Corby Town. The 2012\u201313 season saw the team's best run in the FA Cup. On 3 November 2012 they beat League Two team Torquay United 1\u20130 to go beyond the first round for the first time.BBC Sport \u2013 Torquay 0\u20131 Harrogate Town Against Hastings United in the second round, they drew 1\u20131 at Wetherby Road, and the replay at Hastings also finished 1\u20131, due to a late goal from Harrogate's Tom Platt. However, Town lost 5\u20134 on penalties. After a good start placing them in the top five at the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season, the team went on a long run of bad form. As a result, Weaver and other club officials decided that the players at the end of the season should be given full-time contracts to improve chances of promotion. Near the end of the 2016\u201317 season, the club announced that they would be going full-time the following season. Many players left the club following the club's change to professionalism, and the club signed multiple midfielders and defenders before their pre-season home match against Leeds United. They began training as a full-time club on 3 July 2017. On 13 May 2018, they won the National League North play-offs for the 2017\u201318 season beating Brackley Town in the play-off final earning promotion to the National League. ===National League=== The club finished sixth in their 2018\u201319 National League campaign, qualifying for the play-offs. They were beaten 3\u20131 by AFC Fylde in a play-off eliminator. ===Football League promotion=== As the 2019\u201320 National League season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, table positions were determined on average points-per-game, of which Harrogate Town had 1.78, placing them second and meaning they again qualified for the play-offs, this time in the semi-finals. In the semi-final, they beat Boreham Wood 1\u20130. On 2 August 2020, at Wembley Stadium, the club faced Notts County in the final and won 3\u20131, earning promotion to the English Football League for the first time in their history. ==League history== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | *1957\u20131961 Yorkshire League Division 2 *1961\u20131967 Yorkshire League Division 1 *1967\u20131970 Yorkshire League Division 2 *1970\u20131972 Yorkshire League Division 3 *1972\u20131978 Yorkshire League Division 2 *1978\u20131981 Yorkshire League Division 3 *1981\u20131982 Yorkshire League Division 2 *1982\u20131985 Northern Counties East League Division 1 North | *1985\u20131986 Northern Counties East League Division 1 *1986\u20131987 Northern Counties East League Premier Division *1987\u20132002 Northern Premier League Division 1 *2002\u20132004 Northern Premier League Premier Division *2004\u20132018 National League North *2018\u20132020 National League *2020\u2013 EFL League Two |} ==Ground== Wetherby Road during a match against Bradford Park Avenue in January 2014.
