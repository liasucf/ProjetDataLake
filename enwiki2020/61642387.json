The unknown assailants then locked the doors and other emergency exits of the club and then doused the building with gasoline and set it on fire. Prior to the attack the owner was kidnapped by the same group of individuals. Early reports of the attacks claimed that the fire had been started by homemade bombs, although it was later recanted. == Victims == Thirty-one people were killed in the attack. Around 24 people died during the initial fire attack and seven more died later in the hospital. Of those dead, there were ten women and 16 men. Most of those that were killed were Mexican nationals, however two of the deceased victims were Filipino sailors on shore leave. == Response == Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stated that the attack \"degrades us as a society, as a government, as a nation.\" The Governor of Veracruz, Cuitl\u00e1huac Garc\u00eda Jim\u00e9nez used Twitter to condemn the attack.
