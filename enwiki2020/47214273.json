His prowess was said to be enough that he boasted that he did not have to strike the same opponent twice. He was a martial arts adviser of Fu Zhensong, notably once fighting him to a draw. Li's students eventually became personal bodyguards for Mao Zedong, Chiang Kai-shek, and Henry Pu-Yi. While not due to malicious intent, Li Shuwen killed many people during his life in either martial arts matches or self defense, causing victims' relatives to hold a grudge. He died of a poisonous tea served by one of them.
