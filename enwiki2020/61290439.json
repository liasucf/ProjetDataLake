    "text": "\"Flash Pose\" is a song by Brazilian singer and drag queen Pabllo Vittar featuring English singer-songwriter Charli XCX. It was released on 25 July 2019 as the lead single off of Vittar's 111 1 EP and 111 album. The track is Charli XCX and Vittar's second collaboration, following \"I Got It\", which appears on Charli's Pop 2 mixtape and is followed by \"Shake It\", on the album Charli. == Background == In an interview with Billboard, Vittar explained her inspiration behind making the song entirely in English, saying \"I did a Pride tour in the U.S. and Canada this year, and there were a lot of fans there. They try to learn Portuguese so they can sing and communicate with me, so it's time for me to learn to speak their language too, right?\" == Composition == \"Flash Pose\" is Vittar's first English-language track. Musically, it is a \"self-assured, club-ready\" electropop composition influenced by house music and \"inspired by the global Pride parades at which [Vittar] performs\". It features a \"percussive, electronic-tinged chorus\", \"driving\" beats and \"a roiling verse about wearing vintage Versace and party-hopping in a bright pink car a la Malibu Barbie\" by Charli XCX. Tha\u00eds Matos of Brazilian website G1 noted the absence of the tecnobrega or funk sound Vittar's previous releases incorporated. == Music video == The \"Flash Pose\" music video premiered one day after the song on the Grindr app, and later, on YouTube. == Critical reception == Mike Wass of Idolator called the song a highlight on its parent album. Suzy Exposito of Rolling Stone placed the music video on a list of the 10 best Latin music videos of July. Alex Blynn praised the single, writing \"The track feels eminently danceable, fun as hell and offer[ing] a new take on classic Pabllo-sounds\". == Release history == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\" | Region ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Format ! scope=\"col\" | Label ! scope=\"col\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | Various | 25 July 2019 | | Sony Music Brazil | |} == References == Category: Pabllo Vittar songs Category: Charli XCX songs Category: 2019 songs Category: 2019 singles ",
