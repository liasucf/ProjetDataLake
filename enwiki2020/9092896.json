    "text": "This is a list of the native wild mammal species recorded in Madagascar. As of June 2014 (following the IUCN reassessment of the lemurs) there are 241 extant mammal species recognized in Madagascar, of which 22 are critically endangered, 62 are endangered, 32 are vulnerable, 9 are near threatened, 72 are of least concern and 44 are either data deficient or not evaluated. All of the critically endangered species are lemurs. The mammalian fauna of Madagascar is highly distinctive and largely endemic. The extant nonmarine, nonchiropteran taxa constitute (as of June 2014) 168 species, 40 genera and 9 families; of these, besides a probably introduced shrew, endemic taxa make up all the species, all the genera, and all but one of the families. This endemic terrestrial fauna, consisting of lemurs, tenrecs, nesomyine rodents and euplerid carnivorans, is thought to have colonized the island from Africa via four (or five, if aye-ayes arrived separately) rafting events. The other historic terrestrial or semiterrestrial mammal group, the extinct hippopotamuses, is thought to have colonized the island possibly several times, perhaps via swimming. Earlier in the Holocene, Madagascar had a number of megafaunal mammals: giant lemurs such as Archaeoindris which at over 200 kg was comparable in mass to the largest gorillas, as well as the hippopotamuses. The island also hosted flightless elephant birds weighing up to 700 kg, the largest known birds of all time. All of these went extinct following the first appearance of humans about 2000 years ago. Today, the largest surviving native mammals of the island, such as the indri and fossa, have weights only approaching 10 kg. Most if not all of the 29 listed extinct species are believed to have died out in prehistoric times; none of these are known to have survived into the post-European contact period. The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; those on the left are used here, those in the second column in some other articles: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\" |- | EX || ||Extinct|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died. |- | EW || ||Extinct in the wild|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized population well outside its historic range. |- | CR || ||Critically endangered|| The species is in imminent danger of extinction in the wild. |- | EN || ||Endangered|| The species is facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. |- | VU || ||Vulnerable|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. |- | NT || ||Near threatened|| The species does not qualify as being at high risk of extinction but is likely to do so in the future. |- | LC || || Least concern|| The species is not currently at risk of extinction in the wild. |- | DD || ||Data deficient|| There is inadequate information to assess the risk of extinction for this species. |- | NE || ||Not evaluated|| The conservation status of the species has not been studied. |} ==Subclass: Theria== ===Infraclass: Eutheria=== ====Superorder Afrotheria==== =====Order: Afrosoricida (tenrecs, otter shrews and golden moles)===== \\---- Mole-like rice tenrec Lesser hedgehog tenrec Highland streaked tenrec Lowland streaked tenrec Greater hedgehog tenrec Tailless tenrec The afrotherian order Afrosoricida contains the golden moles and otter shrews of sub-Saharan Africa and the tenrecs of Madagascar, families of small mammals that were traditionally part of the order Insectivora. All native tenrecs of Madagascar are believed to descend from a common ancestor that lived 29\u201337 million years (Ma) ago after rafting from Africa, with the split from their closest relatives, the otter shrews of equatorial Africa, dated to about 47\u201353 Ma ago. Afrosoricida also contains the enigmatic extinct genus Plesiorycteropus, represented by two extinct species of dog-sized, probably insectivorous mammals restricted to Madagascar. Morphological analyses have tended to place them within Afrotheria close to aardvarks (order Tubulidentata), perhaps due to convergent specializations for digging. Analysis of preserved collagen sequences, however, places them in Afrosoricida closest to (and possibly within) tenrecs. The two species differ in size and aspects of morphology. They survived until as recently as 2150 BP. *Family: Tenrecidae (tenrecs) **Subfamily: Geogalinae ***Genus: Geogale **** Large-eared tenrec, Geogale aurita LC **Subfamily: Oryzorictinae ***Genus: Microgale **** Short-tailed shrew tenrec, Microgale brevicaudata LC **** Cowan's shrew tenrec, Microgale cowani LC **** Drouhard's shrew tenrec, Microgale drouhardi LC **** Dryad shrew tenrec, Microgale dryas VU **** Pale shrew tenrec, Microgale fotsifotsy LC **** Gracile shrew tenrec, Microgale gracilis LC **** Grandidier's shrew tenrec, Microgale grandidieri LC **** Naked-nosed shrew tenrec, Microgale gymnorhyncha LC **** Jenkins's shrew tenrec, Microgale jenkinsae EN **** Northern shrew tenrec, Microgale jobihely EN **** Lesser long-tailed shrew tenrec, Microgale longicaudata LC **** Microgale macpheei EX (PH) **** Major's long-tailed tenrec, (Microgale majori) LC **** Web-footed tenrec, Microgale mergulus VU **** Montane shrew tenrec, Microgale monticola VU **** Nasolo's shrew tenrec, Microgale nasoloi VU **** Pygmy shrew tenrec, Microgale parvula LC **** Greater long-tailed shrew tenrec, Microgale principula LC **** Least shrew tenrec, Microgale pusilla LC **** Shrew-toothed shrew tenrec, Microgale soricoides LC **** Taiva shrew tenrec, Microgale taiva LC **** Thomas's shrew tenrec, Microgale thomasi LC ***Genus: Nesogale **** Dobson's shrew tenrec, Nesogale dobsoni LC **** Talazac's shrew tenrec, Nesogale talazaci LC ***Genus: Oryzorictes **** Mole- like rice tenrec, Oryzorictes hova LC **** Four-toed rice tenrec, Oryzorictes teradactylus DD **Subfamily: Tenrecinae ***Genus: Echinops **** Lesser hedgehog tenrec, Echinops telfairi LC ***Genus: Hemicentetes **** Highland streaked tenrec, Hemicentetes nigriceps LC **** Lowland streaked tenrec, Hemicentetes semispinosus LC ***Genus: Setifer **** Greater hedgehog tenrec, Setifer setosus LC ***Genus: Tenrec **** Tailless tenrec, Tenrec ecaudatus LC * Incertae familiae: Genus: \u2020Plesiorycteropus ** Plesiorycteropus germainepetterae EX (PH) ** Plesiorycteropus madagascariensis EX (PH) =====Order: Sirenia (manatees and dugongs)===== \\---- Dugong Sirenia is an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps, and marine wetlands.

It is divided into four main groupings: strepsirrhines, tarsiers, monkeys of the New World, and monkeys and apes of the Old World. Strepsirrhines make up all of Madagascar's native primates species, but comprise only a quarter of those of Africa, the rest being simians. Madagascar's strepsirrhines occupy both diurnal and nocturnal niches, while all those of Asia and mainland Africa are nocturnal and nearly all simians are diurnal (the only exception being neotropical Aotus, which lives where strepsirrhines are absent).Cawthon Lang KA. 2005 July 18. Primate Factsheets: Owl monkey (Aotus) Taxonomy, Morphology, & Ecology. Accessed 2015 March 26. Madagascar's 15 genera of extant nonhuman primates compares with 6 in Central America, 20 in South America, 23 in Africa and 19 in Asia. A number of lemur species larger than any now alive, ranging in size up to that of a gorilla, are believed to have become extinct shortly after the recent arrival of humans. The endemic primates of Madagascar, the lemurs, constitute a single clade and are the largest branch of strepsirrhines. It has been proposed that a common ancestor of all Madagascar's lemurs rafted across the Mozambique Channel from Africa between 50 and 60 million years ago. However, findings of similarities in dentition between several African primate fossils and aye-ayes, the most basal of lemurs, have led to the alternate proposal that the ancestors of aye-ayes colonized Madagascar separately from other lemurs. Between 2000 and 2008, 39 new lemur species were described, bringing the total number of recognized species and subspecies to 99; by 2014, the number of extant species and subspecies recognized had increased to 105. Of these, the IUCN classified 24 as critically endangered, 49 as endangered, 20 as vulnerable, three as near threatened, three as of least concern and four as data deficient; two were yet to be evaluated. *Suborder: Strepsirrhini **Infraorder: Lemuriformes *** Family: Archaeolemuridae (monkey lemurs) **** Genus: Archaeolemur ***** Archaeolemur edwardsi EX (PH) ***** Archaeolemur majori EX

They have two incisors in the upper and lower jaw which grow continually and must be kept short by gnawing. Most rodents are small though the capybara can weigh up to . All the native nesomyid rodents of Madagascar are believed to descend from a common ancestor that rafted over from Africa 20\u201324 million years ago. There are about 39 nesomyid species in five subfamilies in Africa, compared to 27 in one subfamily extant in Madagascar. While nesomyids make up all of the native rodent species of Madagascar, they constitute less than 10% of those of Africa. *Suborder: Sciurognathi **Family: Nesomyidae ***Subfamily: Nesomyinae ****Genus: Brachytarsomys ***** White-tailed antsangy, Brachytarsomys albicauda LC ***** Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis EX ***** Hairy-tailed antsangy, Brachytarsomys villosa VU ****Genus: Brachyuromys ***** Betsileo short-tailed rat, Brachyuromys betsileoensis LC ***** Gregarious short-tailed rat, Brachyuromys ramirohitra LC ****Genus: Eliurus ***** Tsingy tufted-tailed rat, Eliurus antsingy DD ***** Ankarana Special Reserve tufted-tailed rat, Eliurus carletoni ***** Daniel's tufted-tailed rat, Eliurus danieli LC ***** Ellerman's tufted-tailed rat, Eliurus ellermani DD ***** Grandidier's tufted- tailed rat, Eliurus grandidieri LC ***** Major's tufted-tailed rat, Eliurus majori LC ***** Lesser tufted-tailed rat, Eliurus minor LC ***** Dormouse tufted-tailed rat, Eliurus myoxinus LC ***** White-tipped tufted-tailed rat, Eliurus penicillatus EN ***** Petter's tufted-tailed rat, Eliurus petteri EN ***** Tanala tufted-tailed rat, Eliurus tanala LC ***** Webb's tufted-tailed rat, Eliurus webbi LC ****Genus: Gymnuromys ***** Voalavoanala, Gymnuromys roberti LC ****Genus: Hypogeomys ***** Malagasy giant rat, Hypogeomys antimena EN ***** Hypogeomys australis EX ****Genus: Macrotarsomys ***** Bastard big- footed mouse, Macrotarsomys bastardi LC ***** Greater big-footed mouse, Macrotarsomys ingens EN ***** Petter's big-footed mouse, Macrotarsomys petteri DD ****Genus: Monticolomys ***** Malagasy mountain mouse, Monticolomys koopmani LC ****Genus: Nesomys ***** White-bellied nesomys, Nesomys audeberti LC ***** Western nesomys, Nesomys lambertoni EN ***** Nesomys narindaensis EX ***** Island mouse, Nesomys rufus LC ****Genus: Voalavo ***** Eastern voalavo, Voalavo antsahabensis EN ***** Naked-tailed voalavo, Voalavo gymnocaudus LC ====Superorder Laurasiatheria==== =====Order: Eulipotyphla (shrews, hedgehogs, moles, and solenodons)===== \\---- Eulipotyphlans are insectivorous mammals. Shrews and solenodons closely resemble mice, hedgehogs carry spines, while moles are stout-bodied burrowers. There is one species of shrew on Madagascar, which is often considered to be conspecific with the widely distributed Etruscan shrew, Suncus etruscus, and likely to have been introduced to Madagascar from South or Southeast Asia by humans.Omar, H.; Adamson, E.A.S.; Bhauur, S.; Goodman, S.M.; Soarimalala, V.; Hashim, R.; Ruedi, M.

They have a characteristic skull shape and dentition. The native terrestrial carnivorans of Madagascar are all euplerids, which are believed to descend from a common ancestor that rafted over from Africa 19\u201326 million years ago. Their closest relatives are the herpestids, the African and Eurasian mongooses. Malagasy mongooses are not \"true\" mongooses but rather are thought to represent an example of convergent or parallel evolution. About 30% of African terrestrial carnivoran species are herpestids. *Suborder: Feliformia **Family: Eupleridae ***Subfamily: Euplerinae ****Genus: Cryptoprocta ***** Fossa, Cryptoprocta ferox VU ***** Giant fossa, Cryptoprocta spelea EX (PH) ****Genus: Eupleres ***** Eastern falanouc, Eupleres goudotii VU ***** Western falanouc, Eupleres major EN ****Genus: Fossa ***** Malagasy civet, Fossa fossana VU ***Subfamily: Galidiinae ****Genus: Galidia ***** Ring-tailed vontsira, Galidia elegans LC ****Genus: Galidictis ***** Broad-striped Malagasy mongoose, Galidictis fasciata VU ***** Grandidier's vontsira, Galidictis grandidieri EN ****Genus: Mungotictis ***** Narrow-striped mongoose, Mungotictis decemlineata EN ****Genus: Salanoia ***** Brown-tailed mongoose, Salanoia concolor VU ***** Durrell's vontsira, Salanoia durrelli NE *Suborder: Caniformia **Clade Pinnipedia (seals, sea lions and walruses) ***Family: Otariidae (eared seals, sealions) ****Genus: Arctocephalus ***** Subantarctic fur seal, Arctocephalus tropicalis LC =====Order: Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates and cetaceans)===== \\---- H. amphibius skull The even- toed ungulates are ungulates whose weight is borne about equally by the third and fourth toes, rather than mostly or entirely by the third as in perissodactyls. There are about 220 noncetacean artiodactyl species, including many that are of great economic importance to humans. Madagascar's only native artiodactyls are the extinct Malagasy hippos, which are believed to have descended from ancestors that managed to cross the Mozambique Channel from Africa in the late Quaternary, perhaps by swimming. Two or three hippo colonization events may have occurred. H. lemerlei is thought to be a dwarfed form of Africa's H. amphibius, while H. laloumena was larger. C. madagascariensis may be more closely related to the African pygmy hippopotamus, C. liberiensis (the generic assignment of both pygmy forms has been in flux). Skeletal features indicate that Malagasy hippos were better adapted for running than African hippos. H. lemerlei remains have been found in the rivers and lakes of western Madagascar, suggesting a semiaquatic lifestyle similar to that of H. amphibious, while many C. madagascariensis remains have found in Madagascar's forested highlands, indicating a more terrestrial lifestyle. *Family: Hippopotamidae (hippopotamuses) **Genus: Choeropsis *** Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus, Choeropsis madagascariensis EX (PH) **Genus: Hippopotamus *** Lesser Malagasy hippopotamus, Hippopotamus laloumena EX (PH) *** Malagasy dwarf hippopotamus, Hippopotamus lemerlei EX (PH) ======Infraorder: Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises)====== \\---- Omura's whale off Nosy Be Humpback whale off \u00cele Sainte-Marie Southern right whale, \u00cele Sainte-Marie Pygmy sperm whale Indian Ocean humpback dolphin Indo- Pacific bottlenose dolphin Pantropical spotted dolphin Spinner dolphin Fraser's dolphins Melon-headed whales Orcas The infraorder Cetacea includes whales, dolphins and porpoises. They are the mammals most fully adapted to aquatic life with a spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by a thick layer of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater. Their closest extant relatives are the hippos, which are artiodactyls, from which cetaceans descended; cetaceans are thus also artiodactyls. *Parvorder: Mysticeti **Family: Balaenopteridae ***Subfamily: Balaenopterinae ****Genus: Balaenoptera ***** Common minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata LC ***** Antarctic minke whale, Balaenoptera bonaerensis DD ***** Southern sei whale, Balaenoptera borealis schlegelii EN for B. borealis ***** Bryde's whale, Balaenoptera edeni DD ***** Pygmy blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda DD ***** Southern blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus intermedia EN for B. musculus ***** Omura's whale, Balaenoptera omurai DD (among the most common rorquals of north-western Madagascar) ***** Southern fin whale, Balaenoptera physalus quoyi EN for B. physalus ***Subfamily: Megapterinae ****Genus: Megaptera ***** Humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae LC **Family: Cetotheriidae ***Subfamily: Neobalaeninae ****Genus: Caperea ***** Pygmy right whale, Caperea marginata LCSea Alarm Foundation. 2010 Madagascar - Country Wildlife Response Profiles - A Summary of oiled wildlife response arrangements and resources worldwide.
