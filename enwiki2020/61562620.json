Due to its character it is the main route for passenger trains passing through the city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. It is a crucial part of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Cross-City Line. On section between \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna and Ga\u0142k\u00f3wek stations it is exclusively used by passenger trains. == History == The history of the railway begins in XIX century - textile industry in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a started to bloom, yet the city had no convenient transportation routes for exporting the goods to other parts of Russian Empire. The closest railway station - Rokiciny, on Warsaw\u2014Vienna railway - was located over away. It was clear - for further development \u0141\u00f3d\u017a needs the railway link. In 1865, The \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Factory Railway Company (pol. Towarzystwo Drogi \u017belaznej Fabryczno-\u0141\u00f3dzkiej) - a joint venture company of Karl Wilhelm Scheibler and Jan Bloch - was formed, and in the same year, on 30. June. Russian authorities gave the company permission to build a single track railway from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to Koluszki, which were situated on the Warsaw\u2014Vienna railway. The construction began on 1. September and was finished on 18. November 1865. On 19. November the railway was ceremonially opened, and the freight service began to operate. One year later, due to opening of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna station, a regular passenger service started operating. From 1898 to 1901 the railway received a second track - this time build with gauge, due to connection with newly build circular railway, going around the southern border of the city to connect with \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Kaliska station, located on the west side of the city. Track gauges were unified by Germans during World War I. In 1954 the railway was electrified, while a decade later a connector line, allowing trains from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a head toward Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski without turning around in Koluszki, was built. From 2006 to 2008 the railway line was slightly refurbished to raise the maximum operating speed to . From 2011 to 2012 the section between \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Widzew stations was rebuilt, as the construction of cross-city tunnel commenced. The section was reopened in December 2016. == Future == The railway is scheduled to receive an extension to the west within the cross-city tunnel, which will allow trains travel through \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna station toward \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Kaliska and \u017babieniec stations == References == Category:Railway lines in Poland Category:Transport in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ",
