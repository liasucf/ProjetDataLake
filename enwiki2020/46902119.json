In mid-August 2018, Guehai was diagnosed with cardiovascular deficiencies, which prevent her from playing high-level football. At the time, she was about to sign with RCD Espanyol. However, she did not retire. ==Club career== Guehai joined Kristianstads ahead of the 2015 season, aged 20. She scored three goals in her first two games and was hailed as the league's best acquisition in the Aftonbladet newspaper's mid-season review. ==International career== In December 2011, Guehai was called up to the Ivory Coast women's national football team squad. The following year she was part of the team selected for the 2012 African Women's Championship. At the 2014 African Women's Championship, Guehai scored a late goal in the third place play-off to give Ivory Coast a 1\u20130 win over South Africa. The result qualified underdogs Ivory Coast for their first ever FIFA Women's World Cup at South Africa's expense. ==References== ==External links== * Profile at FIF * * Player Swedish domestic football stats at SvFF * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association football forwards Category:Ivorian women's footballers Category:People from G\u00f4h-Djiboua District Category:Ivory Coast women's international footballers Category:2015 FIFA Women's World Cup players Category:Damallsvenskan players Category:Kristianstads DFF players Category:Primera Divisi\u00f3n (women) players Category:Levante UD Femenino players Category:EdF Logro\u00f1o players Category:Ivorian expatriate footballers Category:Ivorian expatriate sportspeople in Sweden Category:Expatriate women's footballers in Sweden Category:Ivorian expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Expatriate women's footballers in Spain ",
