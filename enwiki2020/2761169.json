    "text": "Kumbhoj (pronounced as kam'bho'j) is the name of an ancient town located in Kolhapur district in Maharashtra. The town is about eight kilometers from Hatkanangale, about twenty seven kilometers from Kolhapur and currently, also is the Taluka or Tehsil Headquarters. The famous Jain Tirtha (pilgrim place) known as Bahubali, is just two kilometers away from the Kumbhoj city. As the name itself suggests, Kumbhoj seems to be connected with well-known ancient term Kamboja of Sanskrit/Pali literature. Alternative name of Kumbhoj is Kumboj (=Kamboj). The former name is apparently free from Iranian or Paisaci influence since Maharashtra location was far removed from the north-west division of ancient India. Kamboj is the standard name found in numerous ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts. Padma Vibhushan Dr. Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil, a renowned social worker and philanthropist was born at Kumbhoj. Bahubali at Kumbhoj is identical to the Bahubali of Shravanabelagola known as Gomateshwar to the south in Karnataka. ==History== During the second century BCE, a section of Kambojas from Central India had joined the great tribal movement to Central Asia. One section of those Kambojas appears to have given their name to this coastal town of southwest India. There is said to be a microscopic Jain community, predominantly agrarian, called Kambhoj living near Nanded in Maharashtra. Kumbhoj was very ancient village where Devi Shakambari has visited. There is a temple of Devi Shakambari which has close relation from Banashankari near Badami. This village was mainly ruled by Brahmins whose surname was \"Kulkarni\" (now they are migrated from this village and changed their names to \"Kumbhojkar\") who were integral part of Chatrapati Shahu Maharaj' team for consulting them and providing suggestions over critical and political issues. There is a reference to sage Kumbhoja (q.v.) who finds reference in southern Indian recensions of Ramayana. He seems to have lived somewhere on the banks of river Godavari, in southwest India during Ramayana times. Seems like sage Kambhoja originally belonged to northwest and had migrated to south of Vindhya on river Godawri. The Shakambari Madir needs cultivation through Archaeological Survey of India. Kumbhoj is nowadays famous for the agriculture land where sugar cane farming is popular. ==Jain Temple== Main Entrance of the Temple In 1156 AD, a 6 feet tall idol of lord Bahubali was installed here.http://jain.org.in/tirth-Kumboj%20Bahubali, Maharashtra.html Many Jain saints have visited this place including Shri Bahubali Maharaj, Shri Prabhachandraji, Shri Kamlakarji, Shri 108 Shanti Sagarji.http://www.kolhapurtravels.com/kolhapur-kumbhoj-bahubali-jahaj- mandir.php The temple also has a dharamshala equipped with all modern facilities https://www.maharashtratourism.gov.in/treasures/temple/bahubali- teerthakhstra-kumbhoj This Tirth has small scale replicas of Gajpantha, Taranga, Mangi-Tungi, Sonagiri and Pavagiri on left and Kailash Parvat, Shikharji and Girnarji on right side.
