The Acadian Peninsula did not have a secondary school at the time, so he enrolled at the Coll\u00e8ge Sacr\u00e9-Coeur in Bathurst, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in arts. He also earned a bachelor's in education from the University of St. Joseph's College in Memramcook in 1951, and a master's in French studies from Universit\u00e9 Laval in 1959. He worked as a teacher in numerous different schools, notably on Miscou Island. He then became a professor first at the Provincial Normal School in Fredericton, then at the Universit\u00e9 de Moncton. He became a translator at the New Brunswick Translation Bureau in 1973, then retired in 1984. He lived in Moncton from 1991 until his death. Hach\u00e9 believed that the articles in the magazine of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 historique Nicolas-Denys inspired him to focus on the economic and social development of Acadia. He then wrote several articles in the magazine, and the actions inspired by Hach\u00e9 are still being carried out on the Acadian Peninsula. His first five novels, published by \u00c9ditions d'Acadie, were set on the islands of Lam\u00e8que and Miscou. He was the first winner of the Prix France-Acadie in 1979 for Adieu P'tit Shippagan. This novel, as well as Tourbes jersiaises and Un cort\u00e8ge d'anguilles were based on the history of fishing in Acadia. From 1996 to 2003, Hach\u00e9 wrote La Tracadienne, Le Desservant de Charnissey, and La Ma\u00eetresse d'\u00e9cole, the first Acadian trilogy. He won the Prix l'Acadie entre les lignes, presented by Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9, for the novel Le desservant de Charnissey. He also received the Prix Champlain in 2004 for La Ma\u00eetresse d'\u00e9cole. Playwright Jules Boudreau inquired that his trilogy included \"the first real great Acadian novel\" and \"impressive work, based on a thorough and meticulous research, which brings back to life an entire era through characters of extraordinary presence and truth\". Hach\u00e9 was the first Acadian writer of popular literature, and his writing style was described as easy to read, despite his classic writing style. He won the Prix Plume d'Or in 2004. He published the book De Tracadie \u00e0 Tiley Road in 2009 at the 4th Acadian World Congress. Hach\u00e9 died in Moncton on 22 April 2020 at the age of 95. ==Works== *Charmante Miscou (1974) *Adieu, p'tit Shippagan (1979) *Tourbes jersiaises (1981) *Un cort\u00e8ge d'anguilles : roman (1985) *Le Guetteur : r\u00e9cits (1991) *Sources communes : les familles Hach\u00e9 Gallant (1994) *Saint- Isidore : paroisse du p\u00e8re Gagnon (1994) *Le desservant de Charnissey : roman (2001) *La ma\u00eetresse d'\u00e9cole : roman historique (2003) *La Tracadienne : roman (2003) *Le grand m\u00f4me (2006) *De Tracadie \u00e0 Tiley Road : essai historique (2009) *Le dernier g\u00e9rant des Robin : roman historique (2011) ==References== Category:1924 births Category:2020 deaths Category:20th-century Canadian writers Category:21st-century Canadian writers Category:People from Gloucester County, New Brunswick ",
