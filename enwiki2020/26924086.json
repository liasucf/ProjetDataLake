    "text": "The following is a list of American sports team names and mascots that are based upon or use religious symbolism. Because of the prevalence of Christian groups and institutions throughout the history of the United States, many of these symbols can be assumed to have come from Christian sources. However, teams deriving their image from symbols belonging to other systems of religious and pseudo-religious beliefs have also been included. ==Mascots as visual representation== Sports clubs and teams select their image or mascot based on any number of factors, including choosing an image based on a desire to pick a symbol that will attempt to convey the assets the clubs and teams aim to display, such as strength, courage, aggression, and endurance. Scholars have drawn connections between desires such as these and the religious totems found in polytheism, where visual representations of animals serve as symbols to express the physical and spiritual qualities of community. Adoration of a mascot by a school or company can be seen as religiously significant. However, economic factors also come into play, as both schools and sports-franchise owners want to make money. Just as an appealing, marketable symbol can generate vast revenue, so can profits suffer if a potentially offensive symbol alienates some potential fans. This consideration as well can explain why sectarian religious symbols rarely appear in sports-team names and mascots. Most of the teams listed here belong to schools and not to professional franchises. The reasons for this are subject to debate. In schools administrators, teachers, and parents act as a community to give students education in local values, and in many places these values come from religious institutions like churches and synagogues. So schools often become de facto representatives of a community's religious ideals as well as visual representatives of that community at a state, national, and international level. These conditions combine to make school sports a place for religious symbols, after they get filtered through the secular values both of the nation at large and of sport itself. This filtering produces mixed-value mascots like \"Demon Deacons\" of Wake Forest University and the \"Hustlin' Quakers\" (formerly \"Fightin' Quakers\", subsequently simply \"Quakers\") of Earlham College. Despite the sensitive nature of religious issues in the United States of America, religious imagery in American sport has generated little controversy. Subtle spins on generic symbols like the crusader have come under attack for their insensitivity to non-Christian groups, but by and large religiously inspired team names and mascots have not been scrutinized. This contrasts with team names and mascots from Native American cultural sources. ==Catholic symbolism== There seems to be a clustering of religiously inspired mascots and team symbols in the American Midwest. This area's population is predominantly Protestant or Calvinist and the culture of the Midwest tends to be conservative. This may be a reason for the preponderance of religion symbolism in even non-religious schools and institutions, but does not explain in any way why this symbolism would be Catholic in nature. The institutions listed below\u2014some of which are Catholic\u2014endorse religious symbolism either by the team name or individual mascots. Some are negative, menacing symbols such as the various Demons and Devils, but a majority of them take on positive connotations within Catholicism. These include the Saints, Angels and Friars. ===Colleges and universities=== ==== Catholic ==== * Bellarmine University Knights * Carroll College Saints * Catholic University of America Cardinals * Clarke University Crusaders * DePaul University Blue Demons, mascot DIBS (Demon in a Blue Suit) * Holy Cross College Saints * King's College Monarchs, the mascot is a lion with a crown * Marymount Saints * Providence College Friars * Saint Michael's Bible College Purple Knights * Siena College Saints, mascot Bernie \"Saint\" Bernard * Thomas More College Saints, mascot \"Tommy Mo,\" or \"Tommy Moria,\" a Renaissance Englishman in motley parachute pants. * University of Saint Thomas Tommies, mascot representing St. Thomas Aquinas. * Saint John's University Johnnies, mascot representing St. John the Revelator. ==== Public ==== * New Jersey City University Gothic Knights * Northwestern State University Demons, mascot Vic the Demon. * Old Dominion University Monarchs * University of Central Florida (UCF) Knights ===Primary, middle, and secondary schools=== * Archbishop Bergan High School Knights (Fremont, NE) * Archbishop Mitty High School Monarchs (San Jose, CA) * Bishop England High School Battling Bishops (Charleston, SC) * Brother Martin High School Crusaders (New Orleans, LA) * Cathedral High School Crusaders (St. Cloud, MN) * Central Catholic High School Crusaders (Grand Island, NE) * Kapaun Mount Carmel Crusaders (Wichita, KS) * Mount Michael Benedictine Abbey and High School Knights (Elkhorn, NE) * Norfolk Catholic High School Knights (Norfolk, NE) * Marian High School Crusaders (Marian, NE) * Mormon Trail Jr./Sr. High School Saints (Humeston, IA) http://www.mormontrailcsd.org/ * St. Anthony High School Friars (South Huntington, NY) * Servite High School Friars (Anaheim, CA) * St. Pius X HIgh School Sartans (Albuquerque, New Mexico) * St. Thomas Aquinas High School Knights (Louisville, OH) * St. Thomas Aquinas Saints (Overland Park, KS) * Thomas More Prep-Marian Monarchs (Hays, KS) * Xavier High School Knights (New York City, NY) * St. Mary's High School Saints (Annapolis, MD) ===Non-affiliated sports teams and franchises=== * New Orleans Saints, professional football. The franchise was named \"the Saints\" by popular vote on November 1, 1966\u2014All Saint's Day. The name ostensibly refers to the popular New Orleans gospel / jazz tune \"When the Saints Go Marching In\". * San Diego Padres, professional baseball * San Antonio Missions, professional baseball *Los Angeles Angels professional baseball. Named after the city of Los Angeles. Also nicknamed \"Halos\" because of the common image of Angels having halos over their heads. ===Drum corps=== * The Saints drum corp, sponsored by Our Lady of Peace Church in Fords, N.J. Their original hats had a cross in the center of the medallion, and the Saints logo is the intersection of a halo and a cross. They disbanded in 1987. * The Knights Drum and Bugle Corp in Kewanee, Illinois (discontinued in 1998). * Black Knights Drum Corps of Burbank, California (discontinued in 2001). * Rochester Crusaders Drum Corp of Rochester, New York. * Boston Crusaders Drum & Bugle Corps, founded in 1932, is the second-oldest junior drum and bugle corps in the nation and a founding member of Drum Corps International. * California Crusaders Drum Corp in Carson, California (discontinued in 1979) * Conquistadors Drum Corp from Southern San Francisco, CA * Emerald Knights Drum Corp of Cedar Rapids, Iowa ===Issue related to \"The Crusaders\"=== The University of the Incarnate Word decided in 2007 that it would perhaps be seen to be more open to students, instructors and parents of different faiths. The school decided that the name was \"inappropriate for a Catholic institution with a multicultural mission.\" Corlis McGee, president of Eastern Nazarene College, said, \"There's a growing awareness that the connotation of the word has changed, and the Crusader no longer represents the positive message of Christian love we want to share with the world.\" Other universities have decided to keep the mascot as a way to honor their histories and constantly remind students to \"communicate our desire to bring the good news and cross into every situation we encountered.\" Schools who have done away with the \"Crusaders\" mascot include Point Loma Nazarene University (now the Sea Lion), Eastern Nazarene College (now the Lions), Northwest Nazarene University (now the Nighthawks),Northwest Nazarene University, \"NNU is excited to announce new university mascot\". nnu.edu. 2017-10-16. Retrieved 2020-06-27. Northwest Christian University (now the Beacons), Susquehanna University, The University of the Incarnate Word (the new mascot, the Cardinals, was chosen by students), Clarke University (now the Pride), and Wheaton College. Other schools have retained the name \"Crusaders\" as their team name and mascot, including College of the Holy Cross, Valparaiso University, North Greenville University, and Evangel University,. ==Protestant symbolism== Included here are team names and mascots associated with Protestantism. As the list suggests the visual vocabulary of non-Catholic Christianity, particularly in American sport, does not differ significantly from Catholic Christianity. What distinguishes this section has less to do with symbols themselves and more with context. Six of these schools are affiliated with the NCAA and one is affiliated with the NAIA. The majority of these schools are located in Southeastern coastal states like North Carolina or South Carolina. In this part of the country religiously affiliated colleges and universities have existed since colonial times, when the majority of European Americans living in North American colonies were Protestant Christians. The religiously inspired team names and mascots are a part of this legacy, and associations between school spirit and local religious belief are therefore more historically acceptable in this part of the country. In spite of this legacy, the teams at most Protestant affiliated colleges and schools do not identify with religious symbols. There are nearly 1,000 Protestant colleges and universities in the U.S. alone. But out of all of these, only 14 identify with religious names or mascots. That's less than 2%. This makes sense, because not all of these names and mascots were inspired by religion. The origin of the famous Duke Blue Devil mascot for instance can be traced back to the World War I era. Units of French soldiers called \"les Diables Beus\" marshalled won fame in America. They inspired the Duke student body to make the Blue Devil the school's official mascot in 1911. The name was much more unpopular with the Methodism than with anyone else. The inspiration for a name or mascot also comes from relationships and in particular, rivalries with other schools. Until 1937 Wake Forest's men's athletics teams were known as \"the Deacons,\" \"the Baptists,\" or \"Old Gold and Black.\" But after hiring a new coach and having way more success the school was looking for a way to show its prowess. They beat Duke in a game of football and the president praised them for \"fighting like demons\" to clinch the win, so the name stuck. So the process of inventing an image for a sports team comes from relationships. Clubs and teams can make their images visual reminders of a meaningful moment in school nhisotry. Again, the suggested correlation between sports team mascots and the totems comes into play as some Native American tribes mixed images of vanquished enemies with their own to assimilate their powers. Powerful images of demons, devils and knights remind us of the mascots of Catholic teams, but Protestant teams also draw on symbols from their own beliefs, generally involving religious leadership and including Deacons, Preachers, Evangels, Quakers and Fightin Christians. There are few professional teams that use religious symbolism in their mascots. This is probably driven by their desire to appeal to much larger and diverse fan bases than colleges and schools. Examples of this, where the name has no religious significance, include the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, whose name is simply alliterative and the New Orleans Saints, whose name is derived a well-known jazz song. ===Colleges and universities=== * Bloomfield College Deacons, Presbyterian (NJ) * Earlham College Hustlin' Quakers, Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). Mascot Mr. Quaker. (IN) * Elon University Phoenix, previously the Fightin\u2019 Christians (NC) * Guilford College Quakers, Religious Society of Friends (NC) * Johnson Bible College, Church of Christ. Men's athletics teams nicknamed Preachers, women's nicknamed Evangels.

Christian churches and churches of Christ (IL) * Meredith College Avenging Angels (NC) * Mid-American Christian University Evangels, Church of God in Anderson, Indiana (OK) * North Carolina Wesleyan College Battling Bishops in Rocky Mount NC (Methodist) * Northwestern University. Known unofficially as the Fighting Presbyterian Ministers until 1924 (IL). * University of Pennsylvania Quakers, Non sectarian (PA) * Valparaiso University Crusaders, Lutheran. Formerly the Uhlans, a kind of light cavalry. (IN) * Wake Forest University \"Demon\" Deacons, Baptist. (NC) ===Primary, middle, and secondary schools=== * Christian Academy of Louisville Centurions (KY). Most likely inspired by Cornelius the Centurion, traditionally held to be the first Gentile convert to Christianity. * Christian Life Academy Crusaders (Baton Rouge) * Episcopal School Knights (Baton Rouge) * Lincoln Christian School Crusaders (GA) * Southside Christian School Sabres (SC) * Christ Church Episcopal School Cavaliers (SC) * Shannon Forest Christian School Crusaders (SC) * Franklin Central School Purple Devils (NY) * Wellington High School Crusaders (KS) * New Philadelphia High School Quakers (OH) ==Other religions== * Stockton Thunder, professional hockey uses the Norse god Thor as mascot * Yeshiva University Maccabees, Jewish. ==Generic and/or ambiguous== Most teams with mascots such as \"Devils\" or \"Wizards\" have little to no affiliation with any religious groups. They may choose their mascots for the purpose of intimidating their opponents. Mascots are usually depicted as mischievous or even cute and have no spiritual representation. Devils are one of the most common mascots throughout American sports. This can likely be attributed to Christian beliefs being the most common of religions in the U.S. The devil is normally used as a fierce, intimidating image to represent teams. ===Colleges and universities=== * Arizona State University Sun Devils, mascot Sparky the Sun Devil * Dickinson College Red Devils * Duke Blue Devils * Eureka College Red Devils * Farleigh Dickinson University (Metropolitan Campus) Knights * Farleigh Dickinson College at Florham Devils * Furman University Paladians (SC) * Northwestern State University of Louisiana Demons, mascot Vic the Demon * Old Dominion University Monarchs * Rutgers University at New Brunswick Scarlet Knights * UCF Knights * United States Military Academy Black Knights ===Primary, middle, and secondary schools=== * A.C.
