She received $1.2 million in research funding from Chevron in 2016, who acquired her company in 2017. == Early life == Cave grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana. She studied at Lusher Charter High School. She returned to her alma mater in 2017 to deliver the commencement speech. Cave did ballet, track, and cheerleading before dropping those programs to pursue research in nanotechnology. Cave attributes her early interest in engineering to the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) Program, for which she later became a national ambassador. In 2014 she won $10,000 in New Orleans Entrepreneur Week's Trust Your Crazy Ideas Challenge hosted by NFL Quarterback Drew Brees. === BP Deepwater Horizon Research === In 2015 Cave won second place in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in the Earth & Environmental Sciences Category with her research on the BP Oil Spill impact. As a result, NASA and MIT Lincoln Laboratory renamed minor planet \"2000 GD136\" after her. She began her research at the University of New Orleans at 15, funded by GOMRI (Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative). The research, titled \u201cA Method for Identifying the Photoproducts, Mechanisms, and Toxicity of Petroleum from the Deepwater Horizon by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography and DNPHi Derivatization,\u201d provided a method for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to identify nanotoxins that form in seawater after oil spills. Cave's method later became a spinoff project in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology conducted at Tulane University in 2016. During this time, Cave traveled with her lab to Gamboa, Panama to conduct research with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. ==Career== Cave was a Chemical Engineering student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor before dropping out. She was named Student of the Year in 2017. She is a member of the Entrepreneurs Leadership Program and The Kairos Society. She delivered talks at TEDx Barcelona in 2017. and TEDx UofM in 2018. === Toxin-Detecting Molecule === In 2016, Cave completed the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp and developed an oil spill dispersant molecule, raising $1.2 million in funding from Chevron for further research. She became the co-founder of Mare, a research initiative dedicated to developing solutions to large-scale problems. In 2017 Cave was included on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list and Magic Johnson's 32 Under 32 list. She was also named one of Glamour Magazine's 2018 College Women of the Year. Cave was named to Entrepreneur Magazine's 2018 Young Millionaires List following the acquisition of Mare in late 2017. === Diversity and Inclusion Campaigns === There has been debate around Cave's ethnic origins. She has been featured in Diversity Campaigns by MTV, ABC's Good Morning America, SXSW, 100 Top Women in the World List, The Why Culture, and The Color of STEM. ==Published works== *A Method for Identifying the Photoproducts, Mechanisms, and Toxicity of Petroleum from the Deepwater Horizon by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, DNPHi Derivatization, and Solar Simulation ==References== ==External links== *Official Website Category:Living people Category:University of Michigan alumni Category:Women inventors Category:American women scientists Category:1998 births Category:21st-century American inventors ",
