    "text": "Scottish Parliament Building and adjacent water pool, 2017 The Scottish Parliament is the devolved legislature of Scotland; it was founded in 1999. The 129 members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) are elected using the additional member system. 73 MSPs are elected through the first-past-the-post system in the Parliament's single-member constituencies, while voters have a second vote in their electoral region; there are 8 regions, electing 7 MSPs each. By-elections to the Parliament occur when a constituency seat becomes vacant, due to the death or resignation of a member. Where seats changed political party at the by-election, the result is highlighted: red for a Labour gain, yellow for a Scottish National Party (SNP) gain, blue for a Conservative gain, orange for a Liberal Democrat gain, and grey for any other gain. There were no by-elections in the 3rd Scottish Parliament term (2007-11). ==By-elections== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+List of by- elections for constituency members |- !scope=col|By-election !scope=col data- sort-type=date|Date !scope=col|Parliament !scope=col|Incumbent !scope=col|Party !scope=col|Winner !scope=col|Party !scope=col|Cause !scope=col class=unsortable|Ref |- |Shetland || 29 August 2019 || rowspan=2|5th || || Liberal Democrats || || Liberal Democrats || Resignation (to take a new role at Scottish Rugby) || |- |Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire || 8 June 2017 || || Conservative || || Conservative || Resignation (to contest a seat in the 2017 UK general election) || |- |Cowdenbeath || 23 January 2014 || rowspan=3|4th || || Labour || || Labour || Death (cancer) || |- |- bgcolor=pink |Dunfermline || 24 October 2013 || || SNP || || Labour || Resignation (convicted of assault) || |- |Aberdeen Donside || 20 June 2013 || || SNP || || SNP || Death (cancer) || |- |Moray || 27 April 2006 || rowspan=2|2nd || || SNP || || SNP || Death (breast cancer) || |- |Glasgow Cathcart ||29 September 2005 || || Labour || || Labour ||Resignation (convicted of fire-raising) || |- |Banff and Buchan || 7 June 2001 || rowspan=4|1st || || SNP || || SNP || Resignation (to focus on the Parliament of the United Kingdom) || |- |Strathkelvin and Bearsden || 7 June 2001 || || Labour || || Labour ||Resignation (health reasons) || |- |Glasgow Anniesland || 23 November 2000 || || Labour || || Labour || Death (brain hemorrhage) || |- bgcolor=lightblue |Ayr || 16 March 2000 || || Labour || || Conservative || Resignation (family reasons) || |- |} ==See also== * Regional Member changes in the Scottish Parliament * Elections in Scotland ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== Scottish Parliament Par ",
