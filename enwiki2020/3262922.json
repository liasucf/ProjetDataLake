It is located at Pentre-Bont across the river a few hundred yards from the centre of Dolwyddelan. The station is unmanned. ==Facilities== The platform used to be an island platform as there was a passing loop on the west side. There used to be a substantial station building on the platform and a footbridge up to the road bridge. Both have now been removed and only remaining building is a standard waiting shelter. It is however fitted with a CIS display to offer train running details (these can also be obtained by phone and timetable posters).Dolwyddelan station (2010) Thompson, Nigel Geograph.org.uk; Retrieved 31 May 2017 Step-free access is provided from the car park to the platform.Dolwyddelan station facilities National Rail Enquiries ==Services== Five southbound and six northbound trains call on request Mondays to Saturdays (approximately every three hours), with four trains each way on Sundays.
