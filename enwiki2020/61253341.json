Editions were quarterly from the spring of 1981 to the summer of 1984 when the company was sold to Jack Tramiel. There was also a one-off \"Welcome Edition\" a few pages long prior to the spring 1981 edition. Including the Welcome, a total of 15 editions were produced. The magazine contained a mixture of news, generally fawning software and book reviews, and technical articles at a mixture of skill levels. One recurring feature was \"Find the Bug\" contest, which generally resulted in a winner receiving a game cartridge. Over its history, a number of well-known authors submitted articles to the magazine, including Tom Hudson. ==See also== *Atari Age ==References== ==External link== * Atari Connection Category:Video game magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1981 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1984 Category:Atari Category:Defunct computer magazines published in the United States Category:Atari 8-bit computer magazines Category:Quarterly magazines published in the United States ",
