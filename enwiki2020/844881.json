    "text": "Heart-Shaped Scar is the debut studio album by American singer LP, released in 2001. ==Reception== Allmusic reviewed the album positively, grading it with four stars out of five. Thom Jurek, who reviewed the album noted: \"LP's debut, Heart-Shaped Scar, is a roaring, snotty, bratty, bad-ass pop/rock record full of killer riffs, crunching guitars, and LP's voice, which is equal parts Maggie Bell, Pat Benatar, and Robert Plant ground like glass through a deep Rolling Stones, Bad Company, Lynyrd Skynyrd, blues-rock, and biker sensibility.\" ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== * Listen to the album Category:2001 debut albums Category:LP (singer) albums ",
