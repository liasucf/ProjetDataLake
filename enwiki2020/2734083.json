The Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB, known as English-language Separate District School Board No. 40 prior to 1999) is an English-language public-separate school board for Toronto, Ontario, Canada, headquartered in North York.\"About Us .\" Toronto Catholic District School Board. Retrieved on March 11, 2011. \"Administrative Offices: Toronto Catholic District School Board 80 Sheppard Avenue East, North York, ON M2N 6E8\" It is one of the two English boards of education in the City of Toronto, serving the former municipalities of Scarborough, North York, York, East York, Old Toronto and Etobicoke. With 91,000 students, the TCDSB is one of the largest school boards in Canada, and is the largest publicly funded Catholic school board in the world. Until 1998, it was known as the Metropolitan Separate School Board (MSSB) as an anglophone and francophone separate school district. ==History== TCDSB's former entity, Metropolitan Separate School Board On April 2, 1953, the Metropolitan Separate School Board (), officially known as the Metropolitan Toronto Roman Catholic Separate School Board (MTRCSSB) was formed as the governing body of all publicly funded Roman Catholic schools in Toronto through the merger of several separate boards in Metro Toronto. The merger was passed through Bill 37, the Metropolitan Separate School Board Act.https://www.tcdsb.org/Board/Pages/History-of-the-Board.aspx At its peak, the board operated 185 anglophone and 6 francophone elementary schools and 41 anglophone and 1 francophone secondary schools as of 1990 with 100,000 students attended all MSSB schools. The MSSB took over seven high schools transferred from the Metropolitan Toronto School Board (MTSB) in 1988, with one of them being a francophone Catholic high school, the institution that has been lost since 1968.http://www.metropolicyarchive.ca/wp- content/uploads/2017/04/HSS-1146450-1988D_MSBT-Minutes-1988.pdf The MSSB was the largest school board in Canada at the time. In 1997, as a result of Bill 104, the Fewer School Boards Act, the boards were reorganized resulting in the separation of English and French language schools. The MSSB became known as English-language Separate District School Board No. 40 and renamed itself to the Toronto Catholic District School Board in 1999 while the former Section de langue fran\u00e7aise unit became part of the new French-language Separate District School Board No. 64 which later became Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud. The board headquarters were located on Duke Street, then Jarvis Street, and the MSSB moved its operations in 1964 to 150 Laird Drive, the former headquarters of Durant Motors and later, Imperial Oil.https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2015/ny/bgrd/backgroundfile-84853.pdf In 1982, the board moved to its current administrative headquarters and offices on 80 Sheppard Avenue East.https://www.tcdsb.org/affiliates/Canada150/HeritageMoments/PublishingImages/Feb22-Thurs- Tweet111-800.jpg The school board also had the offices for Section de langue fran\u00e7aise on Drewry Avenue, opened in 1989 in the former Lewis S. Beattie Secondary School, though it has since been occupied by Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir as its administrative offices. ==Organization== The Toronto Catholic District School Board mission statement relies on as \"an inclusive learning community uniting home, parish and school and rooted in the love of Christ\" that \"educates students to grow in grace and knowledge and to lead lives of faith, hope and charity.\" The vision encourages learning communities of the Board to \"transform the world through witness, faith, innovation and action.\" TCDSB Mission and Vision The school board is governed by 12 elected trustees who serve for a four-year term. Each year one secondary school student is selected to serve on the board as a student trustee (who is not entitled to vote). The chair of the board, the vice-chair, and the honorary treasurer are elected at the inaugural meeting of the board, and serve for one year. As of August 2013, Ann Andrachuk serves as chair, and Sal Piccininni serves as vice-chair. Trustees are paid $18,500 a year in salary, and can claim up to $18,000 for expenses. Prior to the 1998 separation of French-language schools, the Metropolitan Separate School Board had three French language seats.\"Newcomer wins French seat on school board.\" Toronto Star. November 16, 1991. News p.A12. Retrieved on July 24, 2013. \" to one of the three French-language seats on the Metropolitan Separate School Board.\" The policies of the Board are administered by the Director of Education and designates. There are more than 91,000 students serving over 195 Catholic schools, and represent close to 475,000 Catholic school supporters in all of Toronto. The TCDSB also has staff consisting of 6,000 teachers, 2,800 support staff, 360 principals and vice principals, and 200 administrators.TCDSB - About Us In addition, the Board operates standing three committees: the Student Achievement and Well Being, Catholic Education and Human Resources, Corporate Affairs, Strategic Planning and Property, & Governance Framework.

These are typically Mid-Century modern in style with two to three storey brick facade and large double hung windows albeit from the cross attached. Some are built in Tudor Gothic style ones in the late 1800s. ==Schools== ==School bus transportation== The following service providers have been contracted by the school board: * Attridge Transportation * Dignity Transportation * First Student Canada * McCluskey Transportation Services * Sharp Bus Lines * Stock Transportation * Switzer-Carty Transportation * Toronto Transit Commission * Wheelchair Accessible Transit ==Uniforms== Uniforms are mandatory for students at the secondary level and elementary starting in the fall 2011. In 2010 some elementary schools started implementing use of uniforms. In 1988, the MSSB ruled that public separate high schools are required to wear uniforms. At the time, all of the high schools in Scarborough except for Newman had uniforms. Some trustees anticipated protests from parents and students from Newman.\"Catholic high school students must wear uniforms, board says.\" Toronto Star. February 2, 1988. News p. A16. Retrieved on September 15, 2013. \"Now students at all 32 Catholic secondary schools except for Newman school in Scarborough wear uniforms. Some trustees fear Blessed Cardinal Newman students and their parents will protest the decision.\" , all TCDSB elementary students must wear a uniform of a white or navy blue top, and navy blue bottoms. This is enforced in special programs such as the gifted program and ME. ==Controversies== ===Enrolment of non-Catholics=== While Catholic high schools are funded by the provincial government, making them open to any students who wish to attend, elementary schools do not have to enroll non-Catholic students. Many argue that the practice of fully funding separate schools exclusively for the Catholic faith is discriminatory to other religions (the United Nations has twice chastised the province for this policy). Supporters of the current Catholic education system point out that it has existed, in one form or another, since Confederation, and that the Constitution Act, 1867 enshrines the right to government-funded religious education to all Catholics. The opposition, however, argues that this is an appeal to tradition, and point to other provinces in Canada which amended the constitution to abolish Catholic school funding. It is up to the school principal whether or not non-Catholics are enrolled. ===Government funding=== Recently, the issue of government funding for religious schools has become a major political issue (see 2007 Ontario general election), with PC Party Leader John Tory supporting an extension of funding to all religious schools, Dalton McGuinty's Liberals and Howard Hampton's NDP supporting the status quo, and Frank de Jong's Greens alone calling for elimination of public funding for all religious schools (including Catholic Schools). ===Labour issues=== The first strikes occurred on April 5\u201311, 1986 when 6,000 teachers of the Metro Separate School Board went on strike with over 100,000 students affected.https://tsuoecta.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/02/J-Geens_1965-to-1995.pdfhttps://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDMDC- TSPA_0016595F&R;=DC-TSPA_0016595F&searchPageType;=vrl From August 2002, the Toronto Catholic elementary teachers were without a contract and imposed work to rule beginning February 2003. With stalled negotiations, the TCDSB officially locked out the teachers on May 16, 2003 and the strike lasted 12 days which left 69,000 students affected.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/catholic-grade-school- teachers-locked-out/article1015732/ The lockout ended when the Ontario government enacted back-to-work legislation on June 3, 2003.https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/S03002 Conflict arose once again when the TCDSB elementary teachers imposed work to rule once more in 2016.https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2016/05/12/toronto- catholic-elementary-teachers-to-launch-work-to-rule.html ===Trustee spending scandal=== The board was embroiled in controversy in May 2008 when a report commissioned by the provincial government uncovered spending abuses by certain trustees, including charges for meals, promotional materials, and prohibited benefits.ParentCentral.ca - Education - Catholic board cuts 85 teachers Provincial supervisor Norbert Hartmann was appointed to oversee administration of the board as a result. ===Incidents between students and faculty=== During a school trip organized by Holy Spirit Catholic School's eighth-grade students, vice principal Stephen Patel threw a shoe at a 14-year-old student Ian Goulbourne in the forehead while on the excursion at Montreal on the school bus on April 24, 2013.Yuen, Jenny Toronto student injured by shoe- throwing TCDSB vice-principal - Toronto Sun, 26 April 2013.
