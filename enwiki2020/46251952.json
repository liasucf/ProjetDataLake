Related to the first Summit, a global essay contest was also held, in which 265 students from 61 countries shared their ideas about Olympic values and how to realize them through sport, culture, education, and other public initiatives. The second Summit, World Sports Values Summit for Peace in Tokyo, was held at Hotel New Otani Tokyo on July 18 and 19.
