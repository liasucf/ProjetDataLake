    "text": "The 2017\u201318 National League season, known as the Vanarama National League for sponsorship reasons, is the third season under English football's new title of National League, fourteenth season consisting of three divisions and the thirty-ninth season overall. The National League covers the top two levels of non-League football in England. The National League is the fifth highest level of the overall pyramid, while the National League North and National League South exist at the sixth level. The top team and the winner of the play-off of the Premier division will be promoted to English Football League Two, while the bottom four are relegated to the North or South divisions. The champions of the North and South divisions will be promoted to the Premier division, alongside the play-off winners from each division. The bottom three in each of the North and South divisions are relegated to the premier divisions of the Northern Premier League, Isthmian League or Southern League. This is the first season to include six teams in the play-offs for each division, with the 4th-7th placed teams participating in the qualifying round and the 2nd and 3rd placed teams qualifying for the semi- finals.http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/the-national-league/big-changes- national-league-play-offs-confirmed/ ==National League== The National League consisted of 24 clubs. ===Promotion and Relegation=== The following teams changed divisions after the 2016\u201317 season: AFC Fylde were the first team to be promoted after a 3\u20130 win against Boston United F.C. on 22 April 2017 clinched them the National League North title. Maidenhead United were promoted on 29 April 2017 after a 3\u20130 win over Margate, competing in the top tier of non-league for the first time. Ebbsfleet United were promoted on 13 May 2017 after beating Chelmsford City 2\u20131 in the National League South Playoff Final, returning to the league after a four-year absence. On the same day, FC Halifax Town were also promoted after beating Chorley 2\u20131 in the National League North playoff final, securing them an immediate return to the league. Leyton Orient were relegated from League Two on 22 April 2017 after their 3\u20130 loss to Crewe Alexandra ending their 112-year stay in the English Football League. On 6 May 2017, despite a 2\u20131 victory over Doncaster Rovers on the same day, Hartlepool United became the second team to be relegated from League Two following Newport County's 2\u20131 victory over Notts County, ending their 96-year stay in the EFL. The six teams replace Lincoln City, Forest Green Rovers, York City, Braintree Town, Southport and North Ferriby United. Lincoln City were promoted to League Two after beating Macclesfield Town 2\u20131 on 22 April 2017. Forest Green Rovers were promoted after beating Tranmere Rovers 3\u20131 in the 2016\u201317 National League Playoff Final on 14 May 2017. They were the league's longest serving club, completing nineteen seasons in the top-flight. This is a mantle that has now been passed to Wrexham, who enter their tenth season in the league. After seven years in the National League and surviving relegation battles over several seasons, Southport were unable to escape the drop and they were the first team to be relegated on 21 April 2017 after a 3\u20130 loss to Dover Athletic. After just one season in the National League, North Ferriby United were relegated three days later after a 3\u20131 defeat at Barrow. On the final day of the season, Braintree Town were relegated after losing 2\u20130 to Aldershot, ending their six-year stay in the league, which also confirmed the club's first relegation in their history. York City's 2\u20132 draw against Forest Green Rovers was also not enough to save them after Guiseley's last minute equalizer against Solihull Moors confirmed back to back relegations for the Yorkshire club. ===Team changes=== ====To National League==== Promoted from National League North * AFC Fylde * FC Halifax Town Promoted from National League South * Maidenhead United * Ebbsfleet United Relegated from League Two * Hartlepool United * Leyton Orient ====From National League==== Relegated to National League North * York City * Southport * North Ferriby United Relegated to National League South * Braintree Town Promoted to League Two * Lincoln City * Forest Green Rovers ===Stadia and locations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
