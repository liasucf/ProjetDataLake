    "text": "Gallo Manor is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa. It is located in Region 3 and Region 7. The upmarket northern suburb of Gallo Manor has managed to retain an almost park like atmosphere, attributable in part to the lush lawns, established gardens and tree-lined streets, but also because much of the suburb is cordoned off as a high security area, so there is little traffic using this quiet suburb of Johannesburg as a thoroughfare. Gallo Manor is bounded by Wendywood, another green suburb, and the Johannesburg Country Club. The suburb is near to Sandton and good access to major arterial roads makes travel Fourways, Kyalami, Midrand and OR Tambo International Airport easy. These factors, along with relative low density, make the suburb desirable. ==References== Category:Johannesburg Region E ",
