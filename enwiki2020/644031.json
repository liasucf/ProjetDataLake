    "text": "The Haast Pass (), a mountain pass in the Southern Alps of the South Island of New Zealand, takes its name from Julius von Haast, a 19th-century explorer who also served as Provincial Geologist for the Provincial government of Canterbury. M\u0101ori used the pass in pre-European times. It is one of the three passes where a road crosses over the Southern Alps \u2013 alongside the Lewis Pass and Arthur's Pass, although the Homer Tunnel passes under the Main Divide. The road through Haast Pass () was converted from a rough track to a formed road in 1966A Wheel on Each Corner, The History of the IPENZ Transportation Group 1956\u20132006 \u2013 Douglass, Malcolm; IPENZ Transportation Group, 2006, Page 12 and received a complete chipseal surface by 1995. In the early 20th century, a railway from the West Coast through the pass to Otago was suggested by local MP Tom Seddon; it would have linked the Ross Branch with the Otago Central Railway, which then terminated in Omakau. However, the line never came to fruition; the Otago Central Railway terminated in Cromwell and no railway was built south of Ross, just a lightly laid bush tramway to serve logging interests near Lake Ianthe. Fantail falls, in the Haast pass. The Haast Pass rises to a height of above sea level at the saddle between the valleys of the Haast and Makarora Rivers. As such, it is the lowest of the passes traversing the Southern Alps. No settlements exist on the Haast Pass road between Haast and Makarora. The road passes through predominantly unmodified beech forest. The pass itself lies within the limits of Mount Aspiring National Park and forms part of the boundary between Otago and the West Coast. ==See also== *List of mountain passes#New Zealand ==References== Category:Mountain passes of the Southern Alps Category:Landforms of Otago Category:Westland District Category:Mount Aspiring National Park ",
