    "text": "Opulence is the debut extended play (EP) by American rapper Brooke Candy, released as digital download by RCA Records on 6 May 2014. The EP is preceded by the release of title track and lead single \"Opulence\" and is Candy's first major label release. The EP features production from Diplo, Kool Kojak, Jesse Shatkin and Shea Taylor among others, including a feature with producer Cory Enemy and songwriting work from Mozella, Jesse Saint John and Sia, this later also serving as the executive producer of the project. ==Background and promotion== Candy caught Sia's attention, and contacted via Instagram with the purpose of writing one song for her. Sia ended up executive producing Candy's debut record, helping her to get a record contract and to find, in Sia's words: \"[a] decent, nice, honest management, and [to] help [her] make the art [she] want to make from a place of positive mental health and love\". Candy signed with RCA in February 2014. She later joined Columbia's UK roster. The first single and title track was performed on April 3, 2014 at Nicola Formichetti's debut Diesel fashion show on Venice. It was later released on April 22, 2014 as digital download along the premiere of its official music video directed by Steven Klein and styled by Formichetti. The song is featured in a scene of CSI's fifteen season episode \"Under My Skin\" and is part of the soundtrack of the basketball video game NBA Live 15. ==Critical reception== The EP was generally praised by critics. Kevin Apaza from Direct Lyrics described it as \"five songs featuring hard-hitting synths, fierce and risqu\u00e9 lyrics, and a swagger by Brooke that can\u2019t be duplicated. She\u2019s making us excited about female rappers again. There just have to be more options than Nicki or Iggy!\". Ashley Emma NG from Best Fan also praised the project saying \"Opulence brings a fresh sound that is all Brook[e] Candy. Some may not understand her lascivious and unconventional attitude, but you can\u2019t help but respect her hustle. Her confidence is indestructible, and not once does it come off as cocky.\" ==Track listing== Credits taken from Qobuz. ;Notes * signifies a co-producer ;Sampling credits * \"Feel Yourself (Alcohol)\" samples the 1997 song entitled \"Alane\" recorded by Wes. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2014) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ==References== Category:2014 debut EPs Category:Electronic dance music EPs Category:Hip hop EPs Category:Pop EPs Category:RCA Records EPs Category:Brooke Candy albums ",
