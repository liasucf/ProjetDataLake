Population: ==History== Cossack expeditions had explored the region since the middle of the 17th century; however, the large populations of Buryats and Evenks deterred the Cossacks from founding a permanent settlement. Peter the Great granted wide autonomy to the local princes, and the region was not colonized by Russians until the end of the 19th century when the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway began. The modern settlement of Khilok was founded in 1895 as a works base around the newly constructed railway station at the Khilok River, the river's name deriving from an Evenk word meaning whetstone. The local section of the Trans-Siberian Railway opened in 1900. Khilok was granted town status in 1951. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Khilok serves as the administrative center of Khiloksky District, to which it is directly subordinated.Registry of the Administrative-Territorial Units and the Inhabited Localities of Zabaykalsky Krai As a municipal division, the town of Khilok, together with two rural localities, is incorporated within Khiloksky Municipal District as Khilokskoye Urban Settlement.Law #317-ZZK ==Transportation== The town is a station on the Trans-Siberian Railway. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * * Category:Cities and towns in Zabaykalsky Krai Category:1895 establishments in the Russian Empire ",
