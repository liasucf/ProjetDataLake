I must\u2019ve been a shallow person because I didn\u2019t appreciate it at the time, and I don\u2019t remember most of what I read.\" Hughes began her writing career in the early 1980s as the features editor of a small newspaper. She wrote humorous short pieces before venturing into longer works.www.eharlequin.com : Charlotte Hughes ==Career== Hughes, a New York Times best selling author, has written almost 40 books.
