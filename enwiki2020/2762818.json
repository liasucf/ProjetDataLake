    "text": "Guillotine choke applied on the ground by bottom fighter in a closed guard The guillotine choke, also known as Mae Hadaka Jime (\u524d\u88f8\u7d5e, \"front naked choke\"; compare to a rear naked choke) in judo, is a chokehold in martial arts and wrestling applied from in front of the opponent. The choke involves using the arms to encircle the opponent's neck in a fashion similar to a guillotine. ==Application== The technique is either a type of tracheal compression restraint (wind choke) that prevents air flow to the lungs, or a blood choke depending on how it is applied. When executed from the ground, the person applying it will try to control the opponent by the hips, for instance using a closed guard. This is done to prevent the opponent from escaping the hold, and to be able to apply additional pressure by extending the hips. It is a very effective maneuver when performed correctly. The arm is wrapped around the trachea and the hands are clasped. Pressure is applied upwards to restrict blood flow to the head, eventually causing unconsciousness and, if applied for more time, even death. It is taught in various grappling martial arts and is considered universal to grappling, including Jujutsu, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Judo, as well as in mixed martial arts competition and exists as one of the most instinctive chokes. ==Description== The 2002 FM 3-25.150 Army Combatives field manual dictates that the fighter should first ensure that the enemy's head goes underneath one of their arms. The fighter wraps their arm around the enemy's head and under their neck. The fighter's palm should be facing their own chest. With the other hand, the fighter grasps the first hand, ensuring that they have not reached around the enemy's arm, and pulls upward with both hands. They now sit down and place the enemy within their guard, and finish the choke by pulling with their arms and pushing with their legs. ==In popular culture== Although the technique has been around for many centuries, it was popularised by martial artist Bruce Lee in his 1972 movie Way of the Dragon. Before he became better known as WWE star Daniel Bryan, professional wrestler Bryan Danielson used the guillotine choke as his finishing maneuver. Ivelisse Velez currently uses the hold as her finisher. It is also featured prominently as a finishing move in the climactic fight of the movie Never Back Down, about underground MMA fight clubs. ==References== * FM 3-25 150 us army 2002 Combatives manual. ==External links== *Instructions on how to execute the Guillotine Choke.
