    "text": "The Manning criteria are a diagnostic algorithm used in the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The criteria consist of a list of questions the physician can ask the patient. The answers are used in a process to produce a diagnostic decision regarding whether the patient can be considered to have IBS. The Manning criteria have been compared with other diagnostic algorithms for IBS, such as the Rome I criteria, the Rome II process, and the Kruis criteria. A 2013 validation study found the Manning criteria to have less sensitivity but more specificity than the Rome criteria. The threshold for a positive diagnosis varies from two to four of the Manning criteria below. # Onset of pain linked to more frequent bowel movements # Looser stools associated with onset of pain # Pain relieved by passage of stool # Noticeable abdominal bloating # Sensation of incomplete evacuation more than 25% of the time # Diarrhea with mucus more than 25% of the time ==References== Category:Gastroenterology Category:Ailments of unknown cause Category:Syndromes Category:Conditions diagnosed by stool test Category:Abdominal pain Category:Diagnostic gastroenterology ",
