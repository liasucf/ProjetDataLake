The castles and forts have long been abandoned, but most are still standing, and some are preserved by the United Nations.Rosen, p. 99.Noble & Kohn & Systermans, p. 113. The earliest castle in Georgia was the Ananuri castle, which was built in the period from 1200\u20131249. The Ananuri castle consisted of two castles with a big curtain wall surrounding it. It was the seat of the dukes of the Duchy of Aragvi, which was one of multiple feudal dynasties during the period.Rosen, p. 100. The last castle to be built in Georgia was the Rabati Castle, which was built between 1250 and 1299. The original town was built from 700\u2013800, with the castle being built in the 1260s. From the 1260s to the 1340s the castle and the surrounding town was the capital city of the province of Samtskhe-Saatabago, which was ruled by the House of Jaqeli.Noble & Kohn & Systermans, pp. 115\u2013118 The forts of Georgia lie in varying states of ruin. The oldest was built in the 9th century, while some were built as late as the 17th century. While many still stand, most have been heavily damaged by various causes. == Citadel Tbilisi == Tbilisi == Castles == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" |- valign=\"top\" ! colspan=\"11\" style=\"background:white;\"| Castles in Georgia |- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\" ! style=\"width:15%; text-align:center;\"|Castle name ! style=\"width:25%; text-align:center;\"|Location ! style=\"width:30%; text- align:center;\"|Time built ! style=\"width:20%; text-align:center;\"|Notes ! style=\"width:5%; text-align:center;\"|Reference |- valign=\"top\" | align=center |Ananuri | align=center |On the Aragvi river, from Tbilisi | align=center |1200\u20131249 | align=center | | align=center |Rose, p. 101. |- valign=\"top\" | align=center |Rabati Castle | align=center |At the town of Akhaltsikhe, Georgia | align=center |1250\u20131300 | align=center | Originally called Lomisa Castle before the Ottoman conquest.Anonymous, p. 91. | align=center |Noble & Kohn & Systermans, p. 120. |- valign=\"top\" | align=center |Castle in Old Town | align=center |At the city of Tbilisi, Georgia | align=center |1000\u20131740 | align=center |Located in the Old Tbilisi , Georgia at the right foot of the Narikala citadel and below the Kartlis Deda monument. Once a small fortress presumably built by the Umayyads in the 7th century destroyed during the Mongol invasions (approximately 12th century), it was from 1621 the Residence of the Persian Shah Administrator for Eastern Georgia (Melik Bebutov family). It also hosted a small nunnery for some time (till 1921). During the Communist period (1921\u20131990), it was transformed into communal apartments for up to 110 individuals. It is the only privately owned Castle in Georgia. |} ==Forts and fortresses== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" |- valign=\"top\" ! colspan=\"11\" style=\"background:white;\"| Forts and fortresses in Georgia |- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\" ! style=\"width:15%; text-align:center;\"|Fort name ! style=\"width:25%; text-align:center;\"|Location ! style=\"width:30%; text- align:center;\"|Time built ! style=\"width:20%; text-align:center;\"|Notes ! style=\"width:5%; text-align:center;\"|Reference |- valign=\"top\" | align=center |Atskuri Fortress | align=center | from Borjomi | align=center |900\u2013999 | align=center | | align=center |Atskuri (2012) |- valign=\"top\" | align=center |Bakhtrioni | align=center |Kakheti region, left bank of the Alazani river | align=center |1650s | align=center | | align=center |Kurtsikidze, Shorena and Chikovani, Vakhtang (2002), \"Georgia's Pankisi Gorge: An Ethnographic Survey\" .
