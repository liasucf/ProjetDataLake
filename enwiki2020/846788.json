    "text": "An answer song, response song or answer record, is a song (usually a recorded track) made in answer to a previous song, normally by another artist. The concept became widespread in blues and R&B; recorded music in the 1930s to the 1950s. Answer songs were also extremely popular in country music in the 1950s and 1960s, most often as female responses to an original hit by a male artist. The original \"Hound Dog\" song sung by Big Mama Thornton reached number 1 in 1953, and there were six answer songs in response; the most successful of these was \"Bear Cat\", by Rufus Thomas which reached number 3. That led to a successful copyright lawsuit for $35,000, which is said to have led Sam Phillips of Sun Records to sell Elvis Presley's recording contract to RCA. In Rock Eras: Interpretations of Music and Society, Jim Curtis says that \"the series of answer songs which were hits in 1960... indicates the dissociation of the singer from the song... Answer songs rode on the coattails, as it were, of the popularity of the first song, and resembled parodies in that their success depended on a knowledge of the original... Answer songs were usually one-hit flukes by unknown singers whose lack of identity did not detract from the success of the record since only the song, and not the performer, mattered.\" Today, this practice is most common in hip hop music and filk, especially as the continuation of a feud between performers; the Roxanne Wars was a notable example that resulted in over a hundred answer songs. Answer songs also played a part in the battle over turf in The Bridge Wars. Sometimes, an answer record imitated the original very closely and occasionally, a hit song would be followed up by the same artist. ==Examples== ===Pre-1950s=== * \"I Wonder Why Bill Bailey Don't Come Home\" was written by William Jerome and recorded by Arthur Collins in 1902 as an answer to \"Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home\", published by Hughie Cannon and recorded by Collins earlier the same year. * \"I Used to Be Afraid to Come Home in the Dark\" was recorded by Billy Murray in 1909 as a response to his own 1908 hit, \"I'm Afraid to Come Home in the Dark\" * The popularity of the 1923 song \"Yes!
