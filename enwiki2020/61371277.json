Amagiri Castle has been designated as being of national significance. ==History== Kagawa clan used Tadotsu Castle( Motodaiyama Castle ) in Tadotsu as a residence and it was considered unsuitable to withstanding a siege, thus Amagiri Castle was built in 1364 by Kagawa Kagenori as a supporting Castle of Tadotsu Castle. In 1581, Kagawa Yukikage accepted the authority of the Ch\u014dsokabe clan and adapted Ch\u014dsokabe Motochika's second son Kagawa Chikakazu(Ch\u014dsokabe Chikakazu), thus the castle was used as a military base for Ch\u014dsokabe clan in Sanuki Province. In 1585, Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched a campaign to pacify Shikoku, after two months of the battle Ch\u014dsokabe Motochika surrendered to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Kagawa clan was abolished by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and later Kagawa Chikakazu returned to Ok\u014d Castle then Amagiri Castle was abandoned. There are little remains of the castle on the present day site, just some Stone walls and earthworks. ==See also== Tomb of Kagawa Chikakazu near the Ok\u014d Castle *List of Historic Sites of Japan (Kagawa) ==References== Category:Castles in Kagawa Prefecture Category:Historic Sites of Japan Category:Former castles in Japan Category:Ruined castles in Japan Category:Ch\u014dsokabe clan Category:Castles in Japan Category:1360s establishments in Japan ",
