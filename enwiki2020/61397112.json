During World war II he was captured during the Battle of Corregidor and spent 3.5 years as a Japanese prisoner of war. He survived the sinking of the \u014cryoku Maru and was freed from captivity in September 1945. He later wrote about his experiences in his book Captured on Corregidor: Diary of an American P.O.W. in World War II. During the Korean War Lieutenant Colonel Wright served in the 7th Infantry Division. He was promoted to Brigadier general and served as Assistant Division Commander of the 11th Air Assault Division (Test), which was renamed the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) and deployed to South Vietnam. Arriving in Saigon on 2 August 1965 Wright led the advance party to establish the Division in Vietnam. Wright served as commander of the 101st Airborne Division from May 1969 to May 1970. Assuming command of the Division at the end of the Battle of Hamburger Hill, Wright created controversy by abandoning the hill on 5 June. Following his return from Vietnam he was promoted to Lieutenant general and appointed Comptroller of the Army, his last active duty assignment before retiring in 1972. ==References== Category:United States Army generals Category:1916 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:American army personnel of the Korean War Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Japan Category:United States Military Academy alumni ",
