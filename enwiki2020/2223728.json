    "text": "\"Slow\" is a song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue for her ninth studio album Body Language (2003). It was released as the lead single from the album by Parlophone on 3 November 2003. The song was written by Minogue, Dan Carey, Emil\u00edana Torrini, and produced by Carey, Torrini, and Sunnyroads. \"Slow\" is an electropop and synth-pop song in which Minogue invites a man to \"slow down\" and dance with her. Upon its release, \"Slow\" was acclaimed by music critics, many of whom praised Minogue's sensual and seductive vocals. At the 47th Grammy Awards ceremony, the song received a nomination in the category of \"Best Dance Recording\". Commercially, the song was a success and peaked at number one on the singles charts in Australia, Denmark, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The song also reached number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs in the United States. In Australia, the song was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for sales of 70,000 units. An accompanying music video for the song was shot in Barcelona, Spain, and features Minogue singing the song while sunbathing next to the Piscina Municipal de Montju\u00efc swimming pool. Minogue performed the song on a number of television shows and included it on the set lists of all of her concert tours to date, with the exception of the Anti Tour. In 2012, Minogue named \"Slow\" as her favourite song from her music career. ==Background and composition== \"Slow\" was written by Kylie Minogue, Dan Carey, and Emil\u00edana Torrini, and produced by Carey, Torrini, and Sunnyroads. In 2009, Torrini explained how she was approached for writing the song, saying \"It was like I had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with, \"Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened\". Musically, the song is an eighties-inspired electropop and synth-pop track. It utilises a very simple and \"minimalist\" style of production and was described as an \"electro-pop/disco fusion with percolating crackle-and-pop beats and sugary vocal overdubs\" by Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine. Additionally, it contains elements of electroclash and club music. Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue urges a man, whom she meets at a club, to \"slow down\" and dance with her. According to Minogue, the lyrics of the song are about \" how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone\". She further said that she \"loved the way the song had this push-pull effect; the musical and lyrical combination gives you a sense of that\". In late 2012, \"Slow\" was re-recorded by Minogue for inclusion in her orchestral compilation album The Abbey Road Sessions. On the album, Minogue reworked 16 of her past songs with an orchestra, which, according to Nick Levine from BBC Music, \"re-imagine them without the disco glitz and vocal effects\". \"Slow\" is approached with a more jazz and trip hop influenced take, with Minogue again delivering sultry and seductive vocals. == Release and artwork == \"Slow\" was released as the lead single from Minogue's ninth studio album Body Language, by Parlophone, on 3 November 2003. The cover art of the single, as well as other promotion shoots related to the album, which was shot by fashion photographers Mert and Marcus, show Minogue striking a pose in a black and white striped crop top, which reveals her midriff, and low-cut pants. Her appearance is similar to that of French actress and singer Brigitte Bardot, who was regarded as the \"first foreign-language star ever to attain a level of international success comparable to America's most popular homegrown talents\" and one of the best known sex symbols of the 1950s and 1960s, frequently cited as the \"archetypal sex kitten\" and \"sex goddess\". Minogue described the promotion shoots as \"the perfect mix of coquette, kitten and rock 'n' roll\", and revealed that \"We shot it on location in the South of France, so it was [easy to] channel the spirit of [Brigitte] Bardot. She's a great iconic reference, particularly that period where she was working with Serge Gainsbourg\". == Critical reception == Minogue performing the song on the Money Can't Buy concert, which was done to promote Body Language \"Slow\" was critically acclaimed by music critics. Ethan Brown from New York praised the production of the song and commented \"Everything at the top of the pops should sound as good as Kylie Minogue's \"Slow\"\". He further felt that most of the songs on Body Language \"mimic its sound, [though] none of the other songs on Body Language come close to the achievement of \"Slow\" and concluded that \"\"Slow\" should be a template for pop singers who fancy themselves aesthetes\". Adrien Begrand from PopMatters commented that the song was \"one of the strongest singles\" of Minogue's career, praising her minimalistic approach on the song and its simple arrangement. The Spin magazine review of the song complimented Minogue's vocals, saying that they will \"bring all the boys to the yard\". Eric Seguy from Stylus Magazine favoured Minogue's demanding vocals, saying that the listener \"is open to Kylie\u2019s demands, and willing to resort to any means necessary to impress her\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that the song is one the \"few of the tracks on Body Language approach(ing) the club-thumping zeal of Fever\". Chris True from AllMusic picked the song as an album highlight of Body Language. Olive Pometsey from GQ deemed it Minogue's best and most \"seductive\" track, concluding that \"featuring breathy vocals over seductive synths, it's the kind of song that would soundtrack that moment when you accidentally lock eyes with a hot stranger in a club perfectly [...] is indeed a slower track, but don't write it off that reason\". The Abbey Road Sessions' version of the song also generated a favourable response. Tim Sendra from AllMusic enjoyed the \"sultry trip-hop take\" on the song and picked it as a highlight on the album. Nick Levine from BBC Music felt that \"Slow\" received the \"most startling makeover\" on the album, and described it as a \"slinky jazz shuffle, complete with vampish vocal performance\". Annie Zaleski from The A.V. Club appreciated the song's graceful nature, calling it a \"slinky come-on\". Philip Matusavage from MusicOMH appreciated the song's jazz influences, noting that it \"suggests that Kylie and jazz could make for great things\". Jeff Katz from Idolator singled out the song as the \"Most Surprising Reworking\" on the album. Jude Rogers from The Quietus, however, felt that the song does not \"respond well to this (orchestral) treatment\". === Accolades and recognition === Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine included \"Slow\" on his list of \"Top 10 Singles & Videos of 2004\" at number five, calling it \"one of the hottest tracks of the year.\" At the 2004 Ivor Novello Awards ceremony, \"Slow\" received a nomination in the categories \"Best Contemporary Song\" and \"International Hit Of The Year\", but lost the awards to Amy Winehouse's song \"Stronger Than Me\" and Dido's song \"White Flag\", respectively. At the 47th Grammy Awards ceremony held in the year 2005, \"Slow\" was nominated for \"Best Dance Recording\", but lost to Britney Spears's song \"Toxic\", which Ironically was originally written for Minogue. In order to celebrate Valentine's Day on 14 February 2012, UK copyright collection society and performance rights organisation PRS for Music compiled a list of the top ten \"sexy songs\" and placed \"Slow\" on the top of the list. In 2012, Minogue picked \"Slow\" as her all-time favourite song from her 25 years in music. Writing for the Herald Sun, Cameron Adams placed it at number 5 on his list of the singer's best songs in honor of her 50th birthday, calling it \"'Can't Get You Out of My Head's emo cousin \u2014 also with a deceptively simple electronic pulse, but taking a much darker tone [...] vocally Kylie moves from detached to carnal in the space of a verse, and somehow [\"Slow\"] sounds like everything and nothing is happening all at once\". == Commercial performance == Minogue, flanked by several dancers, performing \"Slow\" on her Golden Tour (2018\u221219) In Minogue's native country Australia, \"Slow\" entered and peaked at number one on the Australian Singles Chart, spending a total of 11 weeks on the chart.

The video was shot in Barcelona, Spain, and begins with a scene of a man diving into the Piscina Municipal de Montju\u00efc swimming pool and coming out of its edge, where a number of very lightly beachwear-clad people are sunbathing. Minogue stands out in a series of different zoom central shots lying on a sky-blue towel wearing a dark blue bodyhugging Balenciaga dress. The next scenes of the video capture her singing the song through different camera angles, particularly during the chorus when the camera angle shifts to a \"bird's eye\" view and show Minogue amid beach models performing synchronised choreography to the dance beats. A reviewer from District MTV commented that the video showed that \"synchronised sun bathing is more fun than it sounds\". Ben Taylor from Swide Magazine included the video in his list of Minogue's \"Best Music Video Moments\". Used for promoting the song, the video premiered earlier than the song's release date, on 21 October 2003. Minogue talked about the video, saying: > \"The video is set in Barcelona at the Olympic Diving site. I lie down for > the whole video, which I thought was a very cunning plan. But then I ended > up having to sing directly into the camera when the sun was right next it, > so tears were streaming down my face! Videos always have a painful moment. > It's either too hot or it's too cold or there's always something. That's > part of the fun, I guess\" == Live performances == 2019 summer tour Minogue performed \"Slow\" on 6 November 2003, at the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards.

Writing for news.com.au, Nick Bond felt the performance showcased the singer's ability to \"breathe new life into some of her most inescapable hits via canny new arrangements\". A \"pulsating\" mashup of \"Slow\" and David Bowie's \"Fashion\" (1980) was performed during Minogue's 2019 summer tour. She wore a hot red racing driver outfit and was joined by male dancers in pink blazers and kilts. The performance was highlighted by the Evening Standards Thomas Hobbs as one of the show's best moments. Hobbs also praised the singer for looking \"every inch the icon\".
