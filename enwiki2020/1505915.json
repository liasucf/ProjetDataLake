The island is named for the Akpat, the thick- billed murre (Uria lomvia), which live on ledges along the limestone cliffs surrounding the island. ==Geography== Map including Akpatok Island With an area of , Akpatok Island is predominantly limestone, ringed with steep cliffs that rise above sea level. The cliffs are broken in many places by deep ravines allowing access to the flat plateau wide and long. ==Fauna== Akpatok Island, Nunavut. Akpatok Island has International Biological Program status. It is a Canadian Important Bird Area (#NU007), as well as a Key Migratory Bird Terrestrial Habitat site (NU Site 50). In addition to the thick-billed murre, notable bird species include black guillemot and peregrine falcon. Polar bear, seal, and walrus are common in the area. ==History== At the southern end of the island there are remains of a Dorset settlement. The island is known for its widespread cannibalism which ended around 1900 as the inhabitants moved to the mainland. Skulls and human remains have been reported on the island, but the accuracy of these reports can be called into question as there is an abundance of mystery and legend surrounding the details of the island. In July 1971 an exploratory oil well was drilled on the island, yet all that remains are a few dilapidated shelters and rusted equipment. == References == ==External links== * at oceandots.com * Satellite Photograph from USGS * Akpatok Island in the Atlas of Canada - Toporama; Natural Resources Canada Category:Islands of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago Category:Islands of Qikiqtaaluk Region Category:Uninhabited islands of Qikiqtaaluk Region Category:Important Bird Areas of Qikiqtaaluk Region Category:Cannibalism in North America ",
