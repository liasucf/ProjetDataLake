    "text": "The National Gallery Prague (, NGP), formerly the National Gallery in Prague (), is a state-owned art gallery in Prague, which manages the largest collection of art in the Czech Republic and presents masterpieces of Czech and international fine art in permanent and temporary exhibitions. The collections of the gallery are not housed in a single building, but are presented in a number of historic structures within the city of Prague, as well as other places. The largest of the gallery sites is the Trade Fair Palace (Veletr\u017en\u00ed Pal\u00e1c), which houses the National Gallery's collection of modern art. Other important exhibition spaces are located in the Convent of St Agnes of Bohemia, the Kinsk\u00fd Palace, the Salm Palace, the Schwarzenberg Palace, the Sternberg Palace, and the Wallenstein Riding School. Founded in 1796, it is one of the world's oldest public art galleries and one of the largest museums in Central Europe. ==History== \u0160ternberk Palace at Hrad\u010dany The history of the National Gallery dates back to the end of the 18th century (namely February 5, 1796), when a group of prominent representatives of Bohemia patriotic aristocracy (Kolowrat, Sternberg, Nostitz) and middle-class intellectuals decided to elevate what they called the \"debased artistic taste\" of the local population. The institution, which received the title Society of Patriotic Friends of the Arts, established the Academy of Fine Arts and the Picture Gallery. In 1918 the Picture Gallery became a central collection of newly formed Czechoslovakia. In 1995 new spaces dedicated to 19th- and 20th-century art were opened in the refurbished Veletr\u017en\u00ed Pal\u00e1c (Trade Fair Palace), itself a national monument as Prague's largest functionalist building and one of the earliest examples of that architectural style in the city (construction began in 1925). St George's Convent (Hrad\u010dany) was formerly used to display Art of the Middle Ages in Bohemia and Central Europe, baroque art, and the 19th- century art of Bohemia. ==The collections== ===Old Masters=== * Convent of St Agnes of Bohemia (Old Town) \u2013 Art of the Middle Ages in Bohemia and Central Europe * \u0160ternberk Palace (Hrad\u010dany) \u2013 European Art from Antiquity to the end of the Baroque period * Schwarzenberg palace (Hrad\u010dany) \u2013 Baroque in Bohemia ===19th-Century Art=== * Salm Palace (Hrad\u010dany) ===Modern and Contemporary Art=== The atrium in Veletr\u017en\u00ed pal\u00e1c. * Veletr\u017en\u00ed pal\u00e1c (Trade Fair Palace), Hole\u0161ovice \u2013 19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century art, the National Gallery's largest collection.

Works by Rodin, whose exhibition in Prague in the early 20th century had a profound impact on Czech sculpture for many years afterwards, include a series of busts and full-sized figure on a variety of subjects in the gallery. :The vast collection contains a large number of Czech and Slovak paintings and sculptures, including works by Alfons Mucha, Otto Gutfreund, Franti\u0161ek Kupka, T.
