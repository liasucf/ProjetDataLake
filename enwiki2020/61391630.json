    "text": "Hangout with Yoo () is a South Korean reality show program on MBC. It airs on MBC starting from July 27, 2019 on Saturdays at 18:30 (KST). == Synopsis == This is a show that was started in order to find out what Yoo Jae-suk would be doing during his days off. Subsequently, the show showcases Yoo taking on various projects. Recently, all projects that would have to be done outdoors will have to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, and be changed to indoor projects. ===Segments=== (Only segments that last at least two episodes will be listed here) *Camera Relay: PD Kim Tae-ho will first pass the camera to Yoo and from there the camera relay continues by passing to the next celebrity until the camera's storage is full. Different celebrities will be using the camera to record what they will be doing during their days off. *Jo's Apartment: Jo Se-ho's apartment was used to hold a housewarming party, and watch the recordings from the Camera Relays. *Korea Live: Yoo and several celebrities each move out to different places in South Korea to find out about the real lives of South Koreans. *Yoo-plash: Yoo learns to play the drums. He is taught to play a drum beat, and this beat sample he played would then be spread out to various singer-songwriters and producers to further work on it, adding accompaniment by accompaniment as the relay goes on until a complete song is produced. This segment showcases the producing of numerous songs, which began from the drum sample, and eventually the drum recital where Yoo performs the songs together with the artists involved. *Bbong For Yoo: Yoo debuts as a trot singer under the stage name Yoo San-seul (\uc720\uc0b0\uc2ac). This segment showcases all the activities he had taken part as a rookie trot singer. *Life Ramyeon: Yoo handles a ramyeon restaurant, serving ramyeon that he cooked to celebrities, while sharing heart-to-heart talks. *Yoo-chestra: Yoo learns to play the harp, and eventually plays a music piece, together with the Korean Symphony Orchestra. *Indoor Concert: Yoo goes to recruit various acts and then host an indoor concert, without any audience. This project was initiated at the last minute due to the current 2020 coronavirus pandemic in South Korea. *Chicken Doctor Yoo: Yoo makes Korean fried chicken, the reason being many shops selling it have been shutting down due to the current 2020 coronavirus pandemic in South Korea. A continuation of this project, named Saturday Saturday Chicken, was done, as Yoo and several celebrities work together to operate a fried chicken drive-through for only 100 cars. *Summer X Dance X Yoo Jae-suk (later named SSAK3): Yoo forms a co-ed trio SSAK3 (\uc2f9\uc4f0\ub9ac) with Lee Hyo- ri and Rain, and the trio made their debut on July 25, 2020. This project is done due to ballad songs dominating the music charts even in the summer, which PD Kim Tae-ho thought to be not the usual as the past, when upbeat dance songs (typically by co-ed groups) were popular in the season. *Refund Sisters: Yoo becomes the producer of the special 4-member girl group Refund Sisters (\ud658\ubd88 \uc6d0\uc815\ub300), who will make their debut on October 10. This is a spin-off from Lee Hyo-ri naming Uhm Jung-hwa, Jessi and Hwasa (Mamamoo) as the members she want in her dream girl group during the SSAK3 segment. == Episodes (2019)== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Episode !Broadcast Date !Segment(s) + Guest(s) !Special Appearances by !Ref. |- |Pilot |July 20 |Yoo Jae-suk \u2192 Jo Se-ho \u2192 \u2192 Yoo Byung- jae \u2192 DinDin \u2192 Yunho (TVXQ) |Tae Hang-ho's camera: Lee Kyu-hyung Yoo Il-han | |- |1 |July 27 |rowspan=\"2\"| Viewing room: Yoo Jae-suk, Jo Se-ho, Tae Hang-ho, DinDin, Yunho (TVXQ), Defconn Camera 1: Yoo Jae-suk \u2192 You Hee- yeol \u2192 Jung Seung-hwan \u2192 Jung Jae-hyung \u2192 Jang Yoon-ju \u2192 Lee Dong-hwi \u2192 Park Byung-eun Camera 2: Yoo Jae-suk \u2192 Haha \u2192 Yang Se-hyung \u2192 Yoo Se-yoon \u2192 Ahn Young-mi \u2192 Song Eun-i \u2192 Park Myeong-su |rowspan=\"2\"| Haha's camera: Byul Yang Se-chan Jang Yoon-ju's camera: Jung Seung-min Jo Yoon-hee Ahn Young-mi's camera: Kim Gu-ra Yoon Jong-shin Lee Dong-hwi's camera: Lee Byeong-heon Ryu Seung-ryong Lee Hanee Gong Myung Park Jung-min Song Eun-i's camera: Kim Sook Park Byung-eun's camera: Ha Jung-woo (via phone) Ju Ji-hoon Bae Doo-na Special voice appearance: Jeon So-min | |- |2 |August 3 | |- |3 |August 10 |Jo's Apartment: Yoo Jae-suk, Jo Se-ho, Tae Hang-ho, Yunho (TVXQ), Defconn, Yoo Byung-jae, Yoo Il-han, Jang Yoon-ju, Yang Se-hyung, Irene Kim | | |- |4 |August 17 |Jo's Apartment: Yoo Jae-suk, Jo Se-ho, Tae Hang-ho, Yunho (TVXQ), Defconn, Yoo Byung-jae, Yoo Il- han, Yang Se-hyung, Irene Kim, Lee Kyu-hyung, Lee Sung-kyung Yoo-plash: You Hee-yeol, Lee Juck, (Cherry Filter) | | |- |5 |August 24 |Viewing room: Yoo Jae-suk, Jo Se-ho, Tae Hang-ho, Yunho (TVXQ), Defconn, Yang Se-hyung, Lee Kyu-hyung Korea Live (Transport): Seoul -
