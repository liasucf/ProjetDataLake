    "text": "Hopen is a former municipality in M\u00f8re og Romsdal county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1915 until its dissolution in 1960. It covered the northeastern part of the island of Sm\u00f8la, plus the small islands to the north such as Veiholmen, Hammar\u00f8ya, and Haug\u00f8ya. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Hopen where the Hopen Church is located. ==History== The municipality of Hopen was established on 1 January 1915 when the large municipality of Ed\u00f8y was split into three to form the new municipalities of Ed\u00f8y (population: 973), Hopen (population: 1,050), and Brattv\u00e6r (population: 1,452). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1960, the 1915 partition was reversed, reuniting the municipalities of Brattv\u00e6r, Ed\u00f8y, and Hopen as the new municipality of Sm\u00f8la. Before the merger, Hopen had a population of 1,550. ==Name== The municipality was named after the village of Hopen which was the location of the local church. The name comes from the Old Norse word which means \"bay\". ==See also== *List of former municipalities of Norway ==References== Category:Sm\u00f8la Category:Former municipalities of Norway Category:1915 establishments in Norway Category:1960 disestablishments in Norway ",
