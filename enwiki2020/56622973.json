Aged 16 years, Williams won the bronze medal for the 100 metres at the 2014 Nanjing Summer Youth Olympics. Educated at the St John's Anglican College, Brisbane, Williams played rugby union and rugby league as a schoolboy and considered playing for the Brisbane Broncos in the National Rugby League before focussing on a career in athletics. Away from the track Trae is a keen reader, listing Hemingway, Austen and Dickens amongst his favourite authors. He is currently working on a critical literary analysis of Chris Kyle's 'American Sniper'(sic). ==References== Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Brisbane Category:Australian male sprinters Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2018 Commonwealth Games ",
