    "text": "Leigh is a village and civil parish in Surrey, between Reigate, Dorking and Charlwood in the east of Mole Valley district. The village centre is suburban and its remainder is agricultural, interspersed by four satellite clustered localities: Dawesgreen, Bunce Common, Shellwood Cross and Nalderswood which benefit from the amenities of the village and a minority of the remainder is woodland. ==History== A hoard of 62 Roman silver denarii was discovered in a field at Swains Farm in 2004. The oldest of the coins dates from 31 BC and the youngest were minted in around 180 AD after the death of the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Before the Norman Conquest, and in dwindling use afterwards, the village lay within the Reigate hundred. Leigh appears to have been a centre for the Wealden iron industry, and the village was explicitly exempted from a legal prohibition of making charcoal from certain timber types issued by Elizabeth I, so that iron smelting could continue.Malden HE, The Victoria County History (Surrey) (1911) vol. iii pp. 208\u2013210 \u2013 available free online at http://www.british-history.org.uk by the University of Portsmouth and others ==Amenities== The Plough pub, one of two in the village (the other being The Seven Stars) is pictured above next to other homes and the village green. In the village is a church, St Bartholomew's, and the Leigh site for the North Downs Primary School, for school years one to three. The village has a large play area for younger children largely constructed of natural materials. ==Localities== Each of the four communities surrounding the village is subsidiary to Leigh itself. Nalderswood however, including by road, is almost as close to Sidlow, which is a slightly smaller village with fewer amenities. ===Dawesgreen=== Separated from Leigh by a buffer of less than 200m to the south, Dawesgreen is a linear settlement on a built-up crossroads including one of the village pubs, and two other listed buildings ===Bunce Common=== Bunce Common is on the continuation of the road east from Dawesgreen. It is more dispersed, with plots of lower density, and has a road to Shellwood Cross. ===Shellwood Cross=== Shellwood Cross occupies the south-west corner of Leigh civil parish, on slopes by the upper part of the unnamed brook that flows past the east of the village centre and includes three listed buildings, one of which is a barn. ===Nalderswood=== Nalderswood is by a little knoll known as the Mynthurst. The Deanoak Brook is a second tributary of the Mole, itself a tributary of the Thames, and is separated from the existing line of buildings forming most of Nalderswood by the Little Mynthurst rise. ==Demography and housing== The United Kingdom Census 2011 shows an increase of more than 8% in population from 856, ten years previously. The proportion of households in Leigh who owned their home outright was within 4% of the borough and 12% above the national average. The proportion who owned their home with a loan was 1% greater than the national average; providing overall a higher proportion than average of rented residential property and of social housing than the national average, and above the average in Surrey. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+ 2011 Census Key Statistics |- !Output area !!Population !!Households !!% Owned outright !!% Owned with a loan!!hectares |- |Leigh CP||943 ||370 ||42.4 ||33.8||1382 United Kingdom Census 2011 Office for National Statistics |} The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%.
