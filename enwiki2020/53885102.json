Andrew Unterberger of Billboard calls the track, \"a rollicking anthem of folk- pop perseverance with a gently throbbing pulse\", and \"It's marvelous, it's irresistible \u2013 it's Come On Over-worthy, which 20 years later is still pretty much the highest compliment you can give to a song of its ilk\". ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" !
