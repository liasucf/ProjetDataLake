On 6 January 2005, Attajdid published an article by its editor-in-chief Lhassan Sarrat that the deadly 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and ensuing tsunami was God's punishment for sex tourism, homosexuality and child trafficking in southeast Asia, and that the best warning system for such catastrophes was following the teaching of Islam.

The newspaper then distanced itself from the article; director Abdelilah Benkirane declared that the article represented only the opinion of its author. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1999 establishments in Morocco Category:Publications established in 1999 Category:Newspapers published in Morocco Category:Arabic-language newspapers Category:Mass media in Casablanca ",
