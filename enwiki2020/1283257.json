    "text": "Line D of the Buenos Aires Underground runs from Catedral to Congreso de Tucum\u00e1n. The D Line opened on 3 June 1937 and has been expanded to the north several times. The line is currently 11 km long and has 16 stations, while running approximately parallel to the city's coastline. 300px ==History== Line G Line D was the second line to be built by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Hispano Argentina de Obras P\u00fablicas y Finanzas (CHADOPyF, Hispanic-Argentine Company for Public Works and Finances), following the construction of Line C in 1934. Construction began in 1935 and the first part of the line was inaugurated in 1937 and ran 1.7 km from Catedral (still the current terminus) to Tribunales. Three years later, the section which brought the line to Plaza Italia in Palermo was completed, bringing the length of the line to 6.5 km. The line was not properly extended until 1993 when it was extended to Ministro Caranza, a station named after the Radical politician. Further extensions occurred in the 1990s, beginning in 1997 with the opening of Olleros and Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, then Juramento in 1999, and finally Congreso de Tucum\u00e1n in 2000, where it currently terminates.Linea D \u2013 Ciudad de Buenos Aires Over the decades it has been discussed numerous times whether to extend the line out to the limits of the city proper. The last of these proposals came forward in 2002 which would have seen an additional two stations added to the line. However, this was later abandoned since the line was already at full capacity after the opening of Congreso de Tucum\u00e1n station.\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 la l\u00ednea D no llega hasta Puente Saavedra? \u2013 EnElSubte, 25 June 2013. In June 2015 the Metrobus Cabildo line opened, connecting Line D from its terminus at Congreso de Tucum\u00e1n to Vicente L\u00f3pez district in Greater Buenos Aires, some kilometres away from the city limits, essentially making the extension of Line D redundant.Inaugurar\u00edan en junio el Metrob\u00fas Cabildo \u2013 EnElSubte, 6 May 2015. Line D is the only line in the network which will not be extended as part of the most recent expansion plan. Until the privatisation of the underground in the 1990s, Line D was identified by the red colour; whilst Line B used green. ==Museum Stations== Olleros station platforms. Line D carries out cultural activities on stations Juramento, Congreso de Tucum\u00e1n and Olleros. These stations can be visited in order to appreciate the expositions and stands destined to rotary exhibitions coming from the City\u2019s Museums, as well as the Nation\u2019s, educative institutions and other civil society organizations. \u201cThe objective of the museum-stations is to get the population acquainted with the huge cultural and historical patrimony that the City owns, thus turning the subway network, a massive transport medium, into an ideal diffusion agent. The lending of the facilities is absolutely free for the museum and institutions that wish to exhibit their activities or part of the historical or cultural patrimony they treasure\u201d.Quote > Subterr\u00e1neos de Buenos Aires (English) ==Rolling stock== Buenos Aires Underground 100 Series rolling stock Line D was originally served by Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel rolling stock, and then by CAF cars. In 1999, cars from the Nagoya Municipal Subway were purchased second hand from Japan and incorporated into the line. In 2001, numerous Alstom Metropolis 100 Series cars were purchased and built in Brazil and Argentina with the intention of incorporating them into Line A, however they were ultimately put in service on Line D where they remain to this day. More 100 Series cars continued to be purchased in that decade up until 2009, making a total of 96 cars.Finaliz\u00f3 la entrega de los Alstom Metr\u00f3polis \u2013 EnElSubte, 9 March 2009. The remaining Nagoya cars were moved to Line C in 2007 and replaced with the 100 Series cars and with Fiat-Materfer cars. To make the rolling stock more uniform, 24 more modern 300 Series Alstom Metropolis cars were ordered in 2013 to replace the Materfer cars on the line, meaning that the line would be entirely composed of 120 Alstom cars.SBASE anuncia nuevos coches con foto del Metro de San Pablo \u2013 EnElSubte, 21 January 2014. In September 2015, at a conference in Brazil, the head of SBASE gave a presentation in which the number of new cars to be purchased for the line was 84 instead of 30.Plan de modernizaci\u00f3n del Subterr\u00e1neo de Buenos Aires \u2013 Buenos Aires Ciudad, September 2015. By 2016, the final figure had been fixed at 60 new cars, meaning that the fleet will be composed of 156 Alstom Metropolis cars by 2017. == Gallery == File:Subterr\u00e1neo Buenos Aires-L\u00ednea D-Tribunales.jpg|Tribunales station entrance File:Magazine stand in Plaza Italia station.jpg|A magazine stand at Plaza Italia station File:Estaci\u00f3n 9 de Julio de la l\u00ednea D de subtes por D2000.JPG|9 de Julio station File:Coche 3 - Linea D.jpg|Interior of 100 Series rolling stock File:Coche 2 Linea D Subte.jpg|Alstom train == References == == External links == * Subterr\u00e1neos de Buenos Aires (Official Page) * Metrov\u00edas S.A.
