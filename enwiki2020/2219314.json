    "text": "The Telemark Bataljon (Telemark Battalion, TMBN) is a mechanised infantry unit of the Norwegian Army. It was established in 1993, and is a part of Brigade Nord and stationed at Rena, Hedmark. The battalion consists of five companies/squadrons. ==History== In 1993 it was a motorised infantry unit, tasked as an Immediate Reaction Force with the Norwegian Army, stationed at Heistadmoen in southern Norway, manned mainly by conscripts. It served in Bosnia, and by 2002, all the enlisted soldiers had two and three-year contracts of enlistment and the unit had no more conscripts. The battalion was moved to a new camp at Rena and converted to mechanised infantry. Presented with its new colours in 2002, the Telemark Battalion was operational on 1 July 2003. The unit participated in Operation Karez in Afghanistan, in May 2008.Telemark Battalion in new combat with Taliban, Aftenposten, 27 May 2008 One soldier died in Afghanistan in 2004,, CNN, 23 May 2004 \"(Six of nine Norwegians killed by roadbombs)Seks av ni norske drept av veibomber\" \"23 May 2004: Grenader Tommy R\u00f8dningsby fra Telemark bataljon blir drept \" and one died there in 2010.http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10036791 \"I januar 2010 ble Claes Joachim \u00abJokke\u00bb Olsson drept av en veibombe\" ==Organisation== *Tank Squadron 1: The battalion's tank unit, equipped with Leopard 2 main battle tanks. *Cavalry Squadron 2: The battalion's armoured reconnaissance and scout unit, equipped with CV9030 infantry fighting vehicles, ATVs and different sensors like UAVs etc. *Mechanised Infantry Company 3: Mechanised infantry equipped with CV9030 infantry fighting vehicles. *Mechanised Infantry Company 4: Mechanised infantry equipped with CV9030 infantry fighting vehicles. *Staff and Support Squadron 5: A combat support unit made up by mortar, medic, signals and repair platoons.

In addition, the Telemark Battalion frequently trains with the rest of the Norwegian Army High Reaction Force. This is a composite unit made up of the Telemark Battalion, as well as enlisted personnel from support capabilities, ranging from artillery to military police. The Telemark Battalion was one of the infantry battalions assigned to the NATO Response Force during the NRF-4 rotation from January to July 2005; the others were Regiment Johan Willem Friso and Regiment Van Heutsz of the Dutch Army and Fallschirmj\u00e4gerbataillon 373 of the German Army. Telemark Battalion is the primary source of international contributions from the Norwegian Army. The battalion has almost constantly been involved in the ISAF operation in Afghanistan since 2003. ==Incidents in Afghanistan== Since the summer of 2009, there have been several instances of soldiers from the unit spray painting a Punisher skull (in part inspiredhttp://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10036791 by the character from comic books and movie \u2013 the Punisher) on houses and property belonging to Afghans whom soldiers suspected of having ties to the insurgency. The purported purpose was to \"send a message\",Verdens Gang 2011-11-14 p.47 to leaders of the insurgency, that the Norwegian soldiers would not allow them to continue their offensive. In September 2010, Verdens Gang reported that some soldiers were still using a Punisher skull that had been prohibited by the leadership of Norway's military.http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10036791 \"FORBUDT: Til tross for gjentatte forbud fra forsvarsledelsen, fortsetter noen av soldatene fra Telemark bataljon \u00e5 bruke dette merket, d\u00f8dninghodet \u00abThe Punisher\u00bb. Merket fikk p\u00e5skriften \u00abJokke \u2013 we will never forget\u00bb etter at Claes Joachim Olsson ble drept av en veibombe i januar.\" The alleged crimes of threatening and spray painting the property of suspected insurgents did not lead to any criminal charges. ==Battle cry== In 2010, Dagbladet published a video of company commander Rune Wenneberg leading a battle cry (\"To Valhalla\") by soldiers of the unit \u2014 his intro to the cry was \"[inaudible] are hunters. But you are the predator. Taliban is the prey. To Valhalla!\"http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/09/28/nyheter/forsvaret/innenriks/13590682/ 12 seconds into the video: \"Men dere som er rovdyret. Taliban er n\u00e5 byttet. Til Valhall\"\" In 2011, Dag Herbj\u00f8rnsrud wrote in an editorial that \"Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik wasn't sending soldiers into war \u2014 he was merely supplying manpower to a \"peacekeeping mission\". Is it odd that the media was surprised by Norwegian soldiers using Viking helmets and battle cries of Vikings?\" \"Lurte nordmenn \u2014 Noe av ford\u00f8mmelsen kan nok bunne i at norsk offentlighet ble forledet fra \u00e5 f\u00e5 vite hvilken krig landet deltok i. Statsminister Kjell Magne Bondevik (KrF) sendte jo ikke ut soldater i krig, kun personell til en \u00abfredsbevarende operasjon\u00bb.
