    "text": "The Center of Applied Data Science (CADS) is a private company established in Malaysia in October 2015. CADS's professed purpose is to nurture a new generation of data scientists and data professionals through programs that focus on solving real business challenges. == Founding/History == CADS was founded by Sharala Axryd, a Malaysian entrepreneur; her unusual position as a female CEO was noted by several publications.'You can have it all: Female Malaysian tech CEO Sharala Axryd breaks gender barriers in science', Malay Mail (29 May 2019).Shaheera Aznam Shah, 'Women power and decision-making in key positions', The Malaysian Reserve (29 July 2019), section C, p. 9.'Sharala Axryd of CADS named to Five Most Influential Female Online Entrepreneurs by Morgan Philips', ACN Newswire (25 March 2019).Adela Megan Willy, 'EY Entrepreneur Of The Year 2017 Malaysia: From school dropout to EY Entrepreneur Of The Year', The Edge (11 December 2017). In December 2015, CADS partnered with the Data Incubator, which was founded with grants from Cornell Tech, the computer science school at Cornell University. The Data Incubator is considered among the leading data science incubators in the United States. Through this partnership, CADS was the first in the Association of South-East Asian Nations to offer a data science accelerator program to transform science and engineering talents in Southeast Asia into qualified data scientists. With support from the Malaysian government, the programme was Data Incubator's first international campus. == Programs == In 2016, CADS collaborated with Harvard Business School (HBS) Executive Education to launch a customised Big Data Analytics (BDA) program, with Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) and Human Resource Development Fund (HRDF) as stakeholders. The four-day programme took place for the first time at Hilton Kuala Lumpur from 25th to 28 April 2016 with 53 C-level participants. It was also notable for being the first time HBS had conducted a program outside its Boston campus. The programme attracted criticism from the Malaysian newspaper The Edge, which argued that buying in Harvard professors was a poor use of the Fund's resources: in 2017, a four-day course for 65 participants cost RM88,190.40 per person, whereas the fee for a year's degree-level tuition Data Science and Analytics at the National University of Singapore, was RM52,971.09.'Special Report: Four-day courses that charge more than a full degree', The Edge (4 March 2019). The paper questioned the integrity of the HRDF's spending allocations and CADS's role in the process.'Special Report: Red flags point to dodgy dealings in RM150 million HRDF fund', The Edge (4 March 2019). CADS issued a statement in response denying the allegations and saying that it would take legal action for defamation.'Special Report: CADS founder denies wrongdoing in HRDF big data fund controversy', The Edge (13 March 2019). To position Malaysia as a big data hub hub in the region, CADS previously served as a delivery partner for the ASEAN Data Analytics eXchange (ADAX). Launched in March 2017, ADAX is an initiative by MDEC and Malaysia\u2019s and the world\u2019s first physical data exchange. The Data Star Program was then launched in October 2017 previously as a collaborative effort between ADAX and MDEC with CADS as a delivery partner. Now run exclusively by CADS, it is a training program for graduates that includes one to two months in-class intensive data science enablement training and mentorship with experienced data scientists. That same year, CADS collaborated with Coursera, the largest \u2018massive open online course\u2019 (MOOC) platform in the world to offer a host of data science courses to Malaysians. == Other initiatives == CADS has also moved forward with several nation-building initiatives in Malaysia to develop data-driven states. In 2018 alone, CADS delivered training through Sarawak Centre of Performance Excellence (SCOPE) to oversee the development of 2,500 data professionals by 2022 with programmes such as the Sarawak Talent Enrichment Programme (STEP). Furthermore, CADS collaborated with Penang Skills Development Centre (PSDC) to develop the first Artificial Intelligence (AI) Workforce Analytics platform to drive skills development in AI within Malaysia's Northern Region. More recently, CADS is collaborating with the Malaysian Technology Development Corporation (MTDC) in the areas of capacity- building, training as well as promote education, professional training and module development in Data Science, Analytics and Artificial Intelligence skills and specialisations. In 2019, CADS introduced its CADS Certification, a first-of-its-kind certification for data professionals to have their skills and talents recognised globally. This certification corresponds to global industry benchmarks and is a professional credential for any data professional. That same year, CADS launched Data For Her with the National Association of Women Entrepreneurs of Malaysia (NAWEM) that encourages the participation of women in data science through workshops and talks by female industry leaders. == References == == External links == Category:Big data companies Category:Information technology companies of Malaysia ",
