    "text": "Floridays is the fifteenth album by American popular music singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett. It was released in June 1986 as MCA 5730 and was produced by Coral Reefer Band member Michael Utley and recorded and mixed by Jay Rifkin. The title of the album is taken from the 1941 poetry collection of the same name by Don Blanding. The album marks the end of Buffett's shift toward a more country sound that characterized his previous two releases and a return to a sound closer to that of his late 1970s and early 1980s output. The album features a wider variety of musical instruments than was typical for Buffett's previous works, notably several songs with strings and horns. His daughter Savannah Jane Buffett is credited for playing mini-conga on the album. It was also his last studio album to feature Jimmy Buffett's trademark mustache, before he shaved it off for the next album Hot Water in 1988. ==Songs== All of the album's songs were written or co-written by Buffett except for \"If It All Falls Down\" written by Coral Reefer Band member Matt Betton. \"I Love The Now\" was co-written with actress and author Carrie Fisher. The songs \"First Look\" and \"When the Coast is Clear\" later appeared on the box set Boats, Beaches, Bars & Ballads, and \"Creola\" appeared on Meet Me in Margaritaville: The Ultimate Collection. Buffett rearranged the song \"Floridays\" for the 2006 film Hoot, in which he co-starred. ==Chart performance== Floridays reached No. 67 on the Billboard 200 album chart and No. 32 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Neither of the album's two singles charted. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Chart (1986) !

While the structure of Buffett's set lists generally remain the same in a given tour, the song selection varies from night to night; so it's more than likely that there were many changes to the set list as the tour progressed.BuffettWorld 8\u201312 setlist Convention Center Arena Tuesday, August 12, 1986 #\"Coconut Telegraph\" #\"Ragtop Day\" #\"Grapefruit\u2014Juicy Fruit\" #\"Boat Drinks\" #\"Meet Me in Memphis\" #\"Volcano\" #\"Havana Daydreamin'\" #\"If the Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me\" #\"Why Don't We Get Drunk\" #\"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" #\"Creola\" #\"Fins\" #\"Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes\" Intermission #\"African Friend\" #\"If It All Falls Down\" #\"Pencil Thin Mustache\" (solo acoustic) #\"Son of a Son of a Sailor\" (solo acoustic) #\"Nobody Speaks to the Captain No More\" #\"Gypsies in the Palace\" #\"Come Monday\" #\"One Particular Harbour\" #\"A Pirate Looks at Forty\" Encore: #\"Margaritaville\" #\"I Love the Now\" Encore 2: #\"He Went to Paris\" (solo acoustic) ==Notes== Category:Jimmy Buffett albums Category:1986 albums Category:MCA Records albums ",
