She was accepted into the University of Puerto Rico and later to Columbia University in New York, where she graduated in 1931. She was married to painter Rafael Palacios from 1931 to 1935 and during this marriage they had two children: Carmen Palacios Mendoza and Rafael Palacios Mendoza. She returned to Puerto Rico to begin her career as a teacher, writer and newspaper columnist. In 1935, she would meet Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn during one of his campaign stops in Naguabo. Although he was married to American writer Muna Lee, Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn would move in with her a few years afterwards. They were married on November 16, 1946, a day after his divorce from Muna Lee was finalized. Their marriage produced two daughters, Viviana Mu\u00f1oz Mendoza and Victoria Mu\u00f1oz Mendoza. In 1948,President Truman: Letter to Governor Pinero of Puerto Rico Upon Signing Bill Providing for an Elected Governor http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/index.php?pid=1921&st;=Puerto+Rico&st1;= Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn was elected Governor of Puerto Rico. Mendoza lived at \"La Fortaleza\", the Governor's mansion, for sixteen years. As First Lady, she showed interest in Puerto Rico's ecology and public education system. After her husband retired as governor in January 1965, she returned to private life. Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn died on April 30, 1980. Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s, as she was known to close friends and family, died a decade after his death on August 13, 1990. A few years after her death, Mendoza's daughter, Victoria, attempted an unsuccessful campaign as the candidate for the Popular Democratic Party candidate for the island's governorship. She was defeated by Pedro Rossell\u00f3, the candidate for the New Progressive Party. Had she been elected, she would have become the island's first female governor. That honor would later go to Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n when she was elected as the island's first female governor in 2001. The In\u00e9s Mendoza high school in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, is named in her honor as well as the junior high school in San Juan's rural barrio of Caimito and an elementary school in Yauco. As a teacher, In\u00e9s Mendoza defied the U.S.A. imposition of English and ban on Spanish language in Puerto Rico, teaching in Spanish. Her defiance got such a strong popular support that the imposition of English was abolished, as reminded by former governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla. http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2014/06/13/actualidad/1402670785_164869.html ==See also== *List of Puerto Ricans == References == ==External links== * Official Biography from the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn Foundation website Category:1908 births Category:1990 deaths Category:First Ladies and Gentlemen of Puerto Rico Category:Columbia University alumni Category:People from Naguabo, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican people of Spanish descent Category:Puerto Rican Roman Catholics ",
