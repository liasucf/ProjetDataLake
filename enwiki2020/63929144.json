Born in Sugar Grove, Indiana, McMillin attended DePauw University and became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He practiced law in Lafayette before moving to Washington Territory, where he became the president and general manager of the Tacoma Lime Company, a limeworks. In 1886, McMillin and his partners in the Tacoma Lime Company bought Roche Harbor, Washington, and incorporated the Tacoma and Roche Harbor Lime Company, of which McMillin again served as president and general manager. McMillin built the Hotel de Haro in Roche Harbor, and became involved in politics. He ran for the United States Senate in 1895, served as a member of the Washington state railroad commission, and was a delegate to the Republican National Convention from Washington in 1924 and 1932. He was also an ardent Freemason. ==Early life, education and family== John S. McMillin was born in Sugar Grove, Indiana on October 28, 1855. He had a brother, the Reverend William B. McMillin. John S. McMillin attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, and became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, serving as the fraternity's first Grand Consul, or international president. He graduated from DePauw University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1876, and received a Master of Arts degree in 1879. He remained active in fraternity affairs throughout his adult life, and installed Sigma Chi chapters at a number of universities, including Washington State University and the University of Oregon. ===Marriage and children=== On June 5, 1877, McMillin married Louella Hiett. Their first son, John Hiett McMillin, died shortly after being born on July 16, 1878. They had two more sons: Fred Hiett McMillin (September 16, 1880 \u2013 1922) and Paul Hiett McMillin (1886 \u2013 1961). They also had one daughter, Dorothy Hiett McMillin (1894 \u2013 1980). ==Career== In 1877, McMillin was admitted to the bar in Lafayette, Indiana, where he worked as a lawyer until 1884. In January 1884, McMillin's family followed William B. McMillin and his family to Washington Territory. There, John S. McMillin invested in the Tacoma Lime Company, a limeworks, and became the company's president and general manager. In 1886, after investigating the limestone deposits present in Roche Harbor, Washington, McMillin and his partners in the Tacoma Lime Company bought Roche Harbor from brothers Richard and Robert Scurr. The Tacoma and Roche Harbor Lime Company was soon incorporated, and McMillin was elected to serve as its president and general manager. McMillin also served as the president and general manager of the Staveless Barrel Company of Roche Harbor. In addition to his managerial roles, McMillin was responsible for the construction of Hotel de Haro, a 20-room hotel in Roche Harbor.

McMillin ordered the construction of Afterglow Vista (also known as the McMillin Memorial Mausoleum or Afterglow Mausoleum), a structure that serves as the final resting place of himself and members of his immediate family. His cremated remains are interred at Afterglow Vista, along with the remains of his wife and children. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * Category:1855 births Category:1936 deaths Category:19th-century American businesspeople Category:19th-century American lawyers Category:American mining businesspeople Category:American Freemasons Category:Businesspeople from Indiana Category:DePauw University alumni Category:Indiana lawyers Category:Sigma Chi Category:Washington (state) Republicans ",
