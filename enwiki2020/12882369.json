Basket Rimini Crabs is an Italian basketball team based in Rimini, Emilia-Romagna. ==History== The club was established in 1947 as Polisportiva Libertas, playing in the professional second division from the first time in 1978\u201379. The side would make its first division Serie A debut in 1984, staying in the league for the next seven seasons. Returning to the LegaDue (the renamed second division) from 2001, the side was unable to participate in the league in 2011 due to debts, moving to the fourth-division DNB instead. At the end of the 2017\u201318 season, concluded with the relegation of the first team in Serie C, the ownership decided to maintain only the activities of the youth teams. == Notable players == Carlton Myers Germ\u00e1n Scarone Rom\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez {| |- style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | * Mark Crow 1 season: '78-'79 * Otis Howard 2 seasons: '78-'80 * Reggie Johnson 2 seasons: '84-'86 * Roberto Terenzi 7 seasons: '81-'83, '88-'89, '91-'95 * Olden Polynice 1 season: '86-'87 * Mike Sylvester 1 season: '86-'87 * Mark Smith 3 seasons: '87-'90 * Andre Goode 2 seasons: '87-'89 * Rajko \u017di\u017ei\u0107 1 season: '87-'88 * Massimo Ruggeri 8 seasons: '89-'95, '98-'99, '01-'02 * Carlton Myers 6 seasons: '88-'92, '94-'95, '09-'10 * Paul Fortier 1 season: '89-'90 * Andrade Israel 3 seasons: '91-'94 * Darnell Valentine 1 season: '91-'92 * Frank Johnson 1 season: '91-'92 * Larry Middleton 2 seasons: '92-'94 * Alex Righetti 7 seasons: '93-'00 * Emanual Davis 1 season: '94-'95 * Germ\u00e1n Scarone 10 seasons: '95-'98, '05-'11, '13-'14 * Mauro Morri 7 seasons: '95-'01, '02-'03 * John Fox 1 season: '95-'96 * Doug Lee 1 season: '95-'96 * Joe Wylie 2 seasons: '96-'98 * Boris Gorenc 2 seasons: '97-'99 * Anthony Tucker 1 season: '97-'98 * Marko Tu\u0161ek 2 seasons: '98-'00 | * Massimiliano Romboli 7 seasons: '92-'98 * Antonio Granger 2 seasons: '98-'00 * Alan Tomidy 2 seasons: '98-'00 * Chris Corchiani 1 season: '99-'00 * Glenn Sekunda 2 seasons: '99-'01 * Eric Washington 2 seasons: '00-'02 * Rodney Buford 1 season: '00-'01 * Marques Bragg 1 season: '01-'02 * Federico Pieri 1 season: '01-'02 * Ed Stokes 1 season: '01-'02 * Marcelo Machado 1 season: '02-'03 * Guilherme Giovannoni 1 season: '02-'03 * Albert Miralles 1 season: '02-'03 * Roberto Gabini 1 season: '03-'04 * Damir Tvrdi\u0107 1 season: '03-'04 * Rodney Monroe 2 seasons: '03-'05 * Rom\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez 2 seasons: '03-'05 * Chandler Thompson 1 season: '04-'05 * Terrence Rencher 1 season: '04-'05 * Demi\u00e1n Filloy 4 seasons: '04-'07, '10-'11 * Trent Whiting 1 season: '05-'06 * Tim Pickett 2 seasons: '05-'07 * Omar Thomas 2 seasons: '06-'08 * Ndudi Ebi 1 season: '09-'10 * Andrea Pecile 1 season: '09-'10 * Du\u0161an Vuk\u010devi\u0107 1 season: '10-'11 |} ==Sponsorship names== Over the years, due to sponsorship, the club has been known as: *Sarila (1978\u20131980) *Sacramora (1980\u20131983) *Marr (1983\u20131986) *Hamby (1986\u20131987) *Biklim (1987\u20131988) *Marr (1988\u20131993) *Olio Monini (1993\u20131994) *Teamsystem (1994\u20131995) *Koncret (1995\u20131997) *Pepsi (1997\u20132000) *Vip (2000\u20132001) *Conad (2001\u20132002) *Vip (2002\u20132003) *Conad (2003\u20132005) *Coopsette (2005\u20132009) *Riviera Solare (2009\u20132010) *Edilizia Moderna (2010) *Immobiliare Spiga (2010\u20132011) *Basket Rimini Crabs (2011\u20132015) *NTS Informatica (2015\u20132018) == References == == External links == * Official Site * Serie A historical results Retrieved 23 August 2015 Category:1947 establishments in Italy Category:Basketball teams established in 1947 Category:Basketball teams in Emilia-Romagna ",
