    "text": "Fury is a Marvel comics 61 page special one-shot starring Nick Fury published in 1994. ==Publication history== The issue was published in May 1994 with the tagline Featuring the Secret Origin of the Greatest Espionage Agency in the World-- S.H.I.E.L.D.!. Artist Dave Sharpe is credited with the logo design. ==Premise== The book is special one-shot depicting the origin of S.H.I.E.L.D. and how Nick Fury came to lead it. It also features the first appearance of Rick Stoner, the original director of S.H.I.E.L.D. The story was created by editor Ralph Macchio, because he was not pleased with the origin of S.H.I.E.L.D. portrayed in the Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. mini-series. The series uses retroactive continuity, altered the events of the previous two series, recasting them as a series of staged events designed to distract Fury from the resurrection plans of Hydra head Baron von Strucker. The story also features Nick's brother, Jake Fury and Tony Stark prominently throughout, but they only appear as their alter egos Scorpio and Iron Man scarcely. ==See also== * 1994 in comics ==References== ==External links== * Category:Marvel Comics one-shots Category:Nick Fury titles ",
