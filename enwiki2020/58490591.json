She studied philosophy in Paris, and then taught at the University of Algiers from 1959 to 1963. There, she studied political systems in Arab tribes and violence in Kabylie.Glissements de terrains (Vacarme.org) She then taught at Nanterre University in Paris, and later became Research Director at l'\u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes (in religious studies). == Research themes == She is particularly known for her work, in the 1970s, on peasant witchcraft in the Mayenne countryside. It results in a book, Deadly Words: Witchcraft in the Bocage (in 1977). She argues that since witchcraft resides in words, any ethnographic work of these practices require participation, and that witchcraft is one of the \"contemporary discourses on misfortune and healing\". She extends this work with Jos\u00e9e Contreras by studying psychoanalysis and outlining an anthropology of therapy. She continues working on this topic to this day, her last book, Anti-Witch, having been published in 2015. == References == Content in this edit is partially translated from the existing French Wikipedia article at Jeanne Favret-Saada; see its history for attribution.
