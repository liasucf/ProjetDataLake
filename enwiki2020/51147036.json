    "text": "Model-theoretic grammars, also known as constraint-based grammars, contrast with generative grammars in the way they define sets of sentences: they state constraints on syntactic structure rather than providing operations for generating syntactic objects. A generative grammar provides a set of operations such as rewriting, insertion, deletion, movement, or combination, and is interpreted as a definition of the set of all and only the objects that these operations are capable of producing through iterative application. A model-theoretic grammar simply states a set of conditions that an object must meet, and can be regarded as defining the set of all and only the structures of a certain sort that satisfy all of the constraints. The approach applies the mathematical techniques of model theory to the task of syntactic description: a grammar is a theory in the logician's sense (a consistent set of statements) and the well-formed structures are the models that satisfy the theory. == Examples of model-theoretic grammars == The following is a sample of grammars falling under the model-theoretic umbrella: *the non-procedural variant of Transformational grammar (TG) of George Lakoff, that formulates constraints on potential tree sequences *Johnson and Postal's formalization of Relational grammar (RG) (1980), Generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) in the variants developed by Gazdar et al. (1988), Blackburn et al. (1993) and Rogers (1997) *Lexical functional grammar (LFG) in the formalization of Ronald Kaplan (1995) *Head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) in the formalization of King (1999) *Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) grammarsChristiansen, Henning. \"CHR Grammars with multiple constraint stores.\" First Workshop on Constraint Handling Rules: Selected Contributions. Universit\u00e4t Ulm, Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Informatik, 2004. == Strengths == One benefit of model-theoretic grammars over generative grammars is that they allow for gradience in grammaticality. A structure may deviate only slightly from a theory or it may be highly deviant. A generative grammar, in contrast \"entail a sharp boundary between the perfect and the nonexistent, and do not even permit gradience in ungrammaticality to be represented.\" ==References== Category:Grammar Category:Grammar frameworks ",
