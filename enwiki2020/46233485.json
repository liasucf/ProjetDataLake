    "text": "Clarence Clarity is an English singer, songwriter, producer, and musician. He has been praised for his unique, eclectic pop sound which was described by The Guardian as \"funk played by a swarm of bees\", and is noted for his high degree of anonymity regarding his life outside of making music. Despite the similarity, Crisp has stated that his stage name was not overtly influenced by the meme template 'Sudden Clarity Clarence'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S0MuQKZkAY. ==Career== Clarity previously played with several other bands in the 2000s, but decided to start anew under the name \"Clarence Clarity\" after he made clarity his mantra for the project. His first release under the name was 4GODSLUV4GODSLUV in 2012, and he subsequently released his debut EP Save \u2020hyself on the 37 Adventures label in late 2013. At this point in his career, Clarity held anonymity in every aspect of his life, leading to rumours that he was from Fiji or that his music was a new Jai Paul project. He revealed in a later interview that neither of these was true and that he was in fact from England, but also provided misinformation on other aspects of himself. In December 2014, Clarity released his second EP, Who Am Eye, now on the Bella Union label. The album cover features his face with a distorted mouth and removed some more of the anonymity behind the project. In March 2015, he released his first full-length album, No Now, and also performed a session at Maida Vale Studios for Huw Stephens on BBC Radio 1. In 2016, Clarence released a single with Pizza Boy, \"Splitting Hairs\", and the SAME EP, which consists of the titular track \"SAME\" repeated 5 times. During 2017, Clarity helped produce Rina Sawayama's debut mini-album, RINA. He also began releasing singles with minimal or no advertising, such as \"Fold 'Em\" and \"Naysayer Godslayer\". He continued this trend into 2018, as it was revealed that he was working on a project which was widely believed to be called Leave Earth. In September 2018, the album title was revealed to be labelled Think: Peace, and was released independently on his Deluxe Pain label on 4 October 2018. This album featured many of the previously released singles in remixed forms. Clarity also revealed that Leave Earth was actually a compilation playlist consisting of all his singles released from 2016 to 2018, and continued to release singles for this playlist in pairs up until 31 December that year, finishing by releasing \"Leave Earth\" and \"Sob Story\". On 20 March 2020 Clarity released an ambient album, Dead Screen Scrolls, as a pay-what-you-want on Bandcamp; announcing an album was to be released only an hour previous. Clarence is presumed to be working on a project called Midieval Europe. He has mentioned it will be much more short- form than his previous albums. He contributed a significant amount of the production for Rina Sawayama's debut album, Sawayama. ==Personal life== Not much is known about Clarity, his past, or his family; partly due to his use of red herrings, such as stating that he was 7 ft tall and that his favourite food was mud. Clarity has acknowledged that he was in other musical projects before creating music under his current stagename. When asked about this by The Guardian, he replied with \"Yeah, I've got a musical history, and I suppose I don't want to have to justify why certain things in the past haven't taken off. I've wiped the slate clean a couple of times. It all feels necessary to have got here.\" Clarity has said that the lack of public information about him is intended to allow listeners to \"paint a picture of who Clarence Clarity is first\", and that \"I'll introduce bits of myself as we go\", but also has stated that he did not originally intend to maintain his now characteristic degree of anonymity. ==Discography== === Studio albums === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Title !Album Details |- |No Now | * Released: 2 March 2015 * Label: Bella Union * Formats: Digital download / CD / 12\" Vinyl |- |Think: Peace | * Released: 4 October 2018 * Label: Deluxe Pain * Formats: Digital download |- |Dead Screen Scrolls (Ambient Works, Vol. 1) | *Released: 20 March 2020 * Label: Self- Released * Formats: Digital download |- |Midieval Europe | * Released: TBA |} === Compilations === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Title !Compilation Details |- |Leave Earth | * Released: 2016 - 31 December 2018 * Label: Deluxe Pain / Self-Released * Formats: Digital download |} === Extended plays === {| class=\"wikitable !Title !EP Details |- |Save Thyself | * Released: 17 September 2013 * Label: 37 Adventures * Formats: Digital download, 12\" Single |- |Who Am Eye | * Released: 2 December 2014 * Label: Bella Union * Formats: Digital download, 12\" Single |} === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable !Title !Year !Album |- !scope=\"row\"|\"4GODSLUV\" | rowspan=\"2\" |2012 | rowspan=\"2\" |Non-album singles |- !scope=\"row\"|\"KADY\u30af\u30bdPERRY\" |- !scope=\"row\"|\"Alive in the Septic Tank\" | rowspan=\"2\" |2013 | rowspan=\"2\" |Save Thyself |- !scope=\"row\"|\"The Gospel Truth\" |- !scope=\"row\"|\"Those Who Can't, Cheat\" |2014 |Who Am Eye |- !scope=\"row\"|\"Buck-Toothed Particle Smashers\" (ft.
