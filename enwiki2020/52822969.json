He is a Democrat. ==Life and career== Holmes was born and raised in the Mahoning Valley. He graduated from Girard High School before attending Mount Union College, where he received a bachelor's in sociology. Holmes is a father of three and a grandfather of four. In 2008, Holmes was elected the Mayor of McDonald, Ohio after serving as a councilmember there prior to that. There, he focused on employee healthcare and responsible budgeting, and when he left office the town had a $2 million surplus. ==Ohio House of Representatives== After serving as Mayor for over nine years, Holmes decided to run for an open seat in the Ohio House of Representatives in 2016. The seat became open when three-term state Representative Sean O'Brien decided to run for the Ohio Senate, where Senator Capri Cafaro was term-limited. A reliably Democratic seat, Holmes faced two other Democrats for the nomination, but won with a plurality of 44% of the vote. Despite Donald Trump winning Trumbull County, the first time a Republican had done so in over eight decades, Holmes easily defeated Republican Devon A. Stanley by a 60% to 40% margin to take the seat. == References == Category:Living people Category:Members of the Ohio House of Representatives Category:Ohio Democrats Category:21st-century American politicians Category:People from Trumbull County, Ohio Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:University of Mount Union alumni ",
