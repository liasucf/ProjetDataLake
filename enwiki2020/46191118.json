    "text": "Cabinet of Radoman Bo\u017eovi\u0107 was sworn in on 23 December 1991, after the previous cabinet under Dragutin Zelenovi\u0107 resigned due to economic failure. As a Prime Minister of Serbia he was a hardcore bureaucrat, under whom more than half of Serbian economy was under state ownership. After only 100 days in office, the inflation reached record 10,000%. His term was marked by a scandal in which two ministers from his cabinet were arrested, as well as his frequent arguments with opposition leader Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj. On 10 February 1993, the new minority cabinet of Socialist Party of Serbia, supported by Serbian Radical Party, was formed as a result of the December 20, 1992 parliamentary elections. Bo\u017eovi\u0107, himself a Socialist, opposed the support from the Radicals, so he refused another term. This new cabinet was formed by Nikola \u0160ainovi\u0107. ==Cabinet members== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | Position ! colspan=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | Portfolio ! colspan=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | Name ! colspan=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | In Office |- |Prime Minister |General Affairs |Radoman Bo\u017eovi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |rowspan=5|Deputy Prime Minister |General Affairs |Srboljub Vasovi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |General Affairs |Zoran An\u0111elkovi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |General Affairs |Neboj\u0161a Maljkovi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Finance |Jovan Zebi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Mining and Energy |Nikola \u0160ainovi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Minister |Defence |Marko Negovanovi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Minister |Internal Affairs |Zoran Sokolovi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Minister |Foreign Affairs |Vladislav Jovanovi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Minister |Economic Relations and Development |Sr\u0111an Savi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Minister |Justice |Zoran \u0106etkovi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Minister |Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management |Jan Ki\u0161geci |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Minister |Industry |Velimir Mihajlovi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Minister |Transportation |\u017darko Kati\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Minister |Urbanism, Comunal Affairs and Construction |Uro\u0161 Banjanin |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Minister |Trade and Tourism |Sava Vlajkovi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- | rowspan=\"2\"|Minister | rowspan=\"2\"|Labour and Social Policy |Branka Je\u0161i\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 24 Sep 1992 |- |Jovan Radi\u0107 |24 Sep 1992 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Minister |Science and Technology |Divna Trajkovi\u0107 |23 Dec 1991 - 10 Feb 1993 |- |Minister |Education |Danilo \u017d.
