    "text": "The Oklahoma Sooners women's gymnastics team represents the University of Oklahoma in NCAA competition and competes in the Big 12 Conference. The Sooners have won thirteen Big 12 titles, 7 NCAA Regional championships, and have appeared in 15 NCAA National Championships. In 2014, the Sooners won the program's first-ever team national title in the first-ever NCAA gymnastics championships tie, tying with Florida with a score of 198.175. The Sooners have had five individual national champions, 86 NCAA All-Americans, and two Honda Awards (both to Kelly Garrison). ==History== The Sooners gymnastics team was founded in 1981 under head coach Paul Ziert, who led the Sooners to three regional championships and two NCAA tournament appearances. The Sooners won their first five conference titles beginning in 1984 under coach Becky Switzer. Steve Nunno added another Big 12 title in 2004. Current head coach K.J. Kindler took over the program before the 2007 season; the Sooners qualified to their first Super Six team final in 2010, finishing 2nd. In 2014, Oklahoma became the sixth school to win an NCAA gymnastics team title (following Alabama, Utah, Georgia, UCLA and Florida). The 2014 Super Six final was the first to end in a tie, giving Oklahoma their first title and Florida their second straight. ===Super Six appearances=== {|style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" class=\"wikitable\" |+ |colspan=2 align=center \"bgcolor=white\"|Oklahoma Sooners Super Six Appearances |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" ! style=\"; text-align:center\" | Year ! style=\"; text- align:center\" | Finish |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2010 || 2nd |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2011 || 3rd |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2013 || 10th |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2014 || 1st |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2015 || 3rd |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2016 || 1st |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2017 || 1st |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2018 || 2nd |} ===Four on the Floor appearances=== {|style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" class=\"wikitable\" |+ |colspan=2 align=center \"bgcolor=white\"|Oklahoma Sooners Four on the Floor Appearances |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" ! style=\"; text-align:center\" | Year ! style=\"; text-align:center\" | Finish |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | 2019 || 1st |} ==Roster== === 2020\u201321 Roster === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"; text- align:center\" | Name ! style=\"; text-align:center\" | Height ! style=\"; text- align:center\" | Year ! style=\"; text-align:center\" | Hometown ! style=\"; text- align:center\" | Club |- |Audrey David|| || FR || Frisco, TX || |- | Vanessa Deniz || 5-4 || SO || Millstone Township, NJ || |- | Jordan Draper || 5-3 || SR || Bedford, TX || |- | Jenna Dunn || 4-10 || SO || Oklahoma City, OK || |- | Julianne Fehring || 5-4 || FR|| Tampa, FL || |- | Erin Hutchinson || 5-6 || SO || Plano, TX || WOGA |- | Bell Johnson || 5-6 || FR || Norman, OK || |- | Cassidy Knight || 5-3 || FR || Arvada, CO || |- | Emma La Pinta || 5-1 || JR || Frisco, TX || Kurt Thomas Gymnastics |- | Katherine Levasseur || 5-4 || FR || San Antonio, TX || |- | Audrey Lynn || 5-4 || FR || Norman, OK || |- | Sheridan Ramsey || 5-4 || FR || Tulsa, OK || |- | Evy Schoepfer || 5-3 || SR || Ames, IA ||Triad Gymnastics |- | Quinn Smith || 5-1 || FR || Phoenix, AZ || Arizona Sunrays |- | Ragan Smith || 4-11 || SO || Lewisville, TX || Texas Dreams |- | Allie Stern || 5-3 || JR ||Charlotte, NC||Perfect Balance |- | Meilin Sullivan || 5-4 || FR || Kansas City, MO || Fuzion Gymnastics |- | Karrie Thomas || 5-3 || SR || Coral Springs, FL || |- | Olivia Trautman || 5-1 || JR ||Champlin, MN||Twin City Twisters |- |Anastasia Webb||5-5|| SR ||Morton Grove, IL||IGI |- | Brooke Weins || 5-3 || SO || Thornton, CO || |- |Carly Woodard||5-5|| SR ||Overland Park, KS||Fuzion Gymnastics |} === Future recruits === ==== 2021\u20132022 ==== *Jordan Bowers - Solid Rock Gymnastics - 2018 Junior Pan American Champion *Danae Fletcher *Moorea Linker - LaFleur's Tampa - 2019 Women's Junior Olympic National Championships: 2nd-AA; 1st-VT; 1st-FX; 9th-BB; 32nd-UBhttps://balancebeamsituation.com/2019/05/18/2019-jo- nationals/#more-33221 *Madison Snook ==== 2022\u20132023 ==== * Faith Torrez - National Team member * Ava Siegfeldt == Coaches == *Head Coach: K.J.
