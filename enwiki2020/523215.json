The latinized name is a translation of his family name, which means \"mustard\" in Czech (\"sinapius\" in Latin). ==Biography== According to his college records, Jakub was born in Bo\u0159enovice in MoraviaRen\u00e9 Zandbergen (2010) Jacobus Horcicky de Tepenec (Sinapius) In Voynich MS - Biographies. Accessed 2010-08-29 in a lower-class family. He initially worked as kitchen helper at the Jesuit school at Krumlov, but was eventually admitted to the Krumlov Seminary of poor students in 1590. Jakub eventually graduated from the Krumlov Gymnasium, where he studied poetry and rhetoric, and became a pharmacist himself. There he also worked in the college's pharmacy, on topics involving chemistry and herbalism, under the overseeing of Martin Schaffner (1564\u20131608).Johannes Schmidl (1754) Historiae Societatis Jesu Provinciae Bohemiae, part III (1616-1632), Prague By 1598, he started studying Aristotelian philosophy at the Clementinum college in Prague (which was later merged with Charles University), and at the same time oversaw the kitchen and pantry, but continued working in chemistry and pharmacy. However, Sinapius was not satisfied with the teachings there, learning Barbara and Celare, instead of physics and the origins of nature. Because his herbal skills to treat illness impressed, he was allowed gardening near the river Vltava, under the Br\u00e4ke. Here he grew herbs and set up a laboratory at Sm\u00edchov (then a village behind Prague walls), the Clementinum's botanical garden. There, or at the garden, he distilled a very popular Aqua Sinapis (\"Die Sinapischen Wasser\", Horczicze in Latin means mustard, hence mustard water) whose sale made him a wealthy man. In 1600, he became the administrator of the Jesuit college in Jind\u0159ich\u016fv Hradec, and in 1606 he became capitaneus and administrator of the properties of the St. George's Convent in the Prague Castle. In 1607 he was named imperial chemist by Rudolf II. In return for curing the emperor of a grave disease, he was ennobled with the title \"de Tepenec\", presumably after the medieval Tepenec Castle (destroyed in 1391) near Olomouc. He lent emperor Rudolf II money and received from him in return an estate around town M\u011bln\u00edk. He also supported students of the studies of catholic theology financially. In the religious disputes of the early 17th century, Jakub strongly defended the Catholic side. He became the administrator of the but was jailed in 1620, when the Protestants took charge of the town. Subsequently, was exchanged by another prisoner (famous physician Jessenius) and exiled, but later, after defeating of the Bohemian Revolt, he returned to M\u011bln\u00edk and lived there the rest of his life. He died in 1622, from a horse-fall that he had suffered a year before. Two days before his death he was moved to the Clementinum at the care of the Jesuits, and left them the sum of 50,000 gold coins and his M\u011bln\u00edk estate. He is buried in the Church of St. Salvator in the Clementinum. ==Writings== In 1609 he published a pro-Catholic pamphlet which saw several reprintings. According to a 1777 source, he had written several manuscripts on chemistry and botany. ==Connection to the Voynich manuscript== Book dealer Wilfrid Voynich saw Jakub's name and title at the bottom of the first page of the Voynich manuscript. Voynich saw the faint writing later revealed as Jacobus Sinapius (Jacobus Ho\u0159\u010dick\u00fd de Tepenec), Voynich subsequently used many chemicals to make it clearer but failed. It was later revealed by ultraviolet light and has been compared with other samples of his signature. Jakub is thus the second person known to have owned the Voynich manuscript after Emperor Rudolf II. Its attested provenance begins with him, since the story that it was owned by Emperor Rudolf II rests on a single piece of unsubstantiated hearsay, related at second hand in a letter to Athanasius Kircher. ==References== Category:1575 births Category:1622 deaths Category:17th-century Bohemian physicians Category:Czech pharmacists ",
