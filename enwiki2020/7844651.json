His mother initiated his early training in Quranic studies then he later entered formal education in Arabic, Persian and Urdu. His father, Hakim Syed Abdul Hai, wrote an 8-volumes Arabic encyclopedia called Nuzhat al Khawatir (biographical notices of more than 5,000 theologian and jurists of the Sub- continent).Sayed Khatab, The Political Thought of Sayyid Qutb: The Theory of Jahiliyyah, Routledge (2006), p. 207 His mother was also a pious and learned woman who composed her own poetry that was published by the title of 'Kaleed- i-Bab-i-Rehmat' His elder brother, Maulana Dr. Sayyid Abdul Ali Hasani, was also a prominent Islamic scholar and a Medical Doctor.

He also received a gold medal from Allahabad University and also took lessons at the famous, Darul Uloom Deoband. ==Writings== Abul Hassan Ali Nadwi primarily wrote in Arabic, although also in Urdu, and wrote more than fifty books on history, theology, and biography, and thousands of seminar papers, articles, and recorded speeches.\"The Great Muslims of the 20th Century India\" By Mohsin Atique Khan His 1950 book Maza Khasiral Alam be Inhitat al-Muslimeen (lit. What did the world lose with the decline of Muslims?), translated into English as Islam and the World, was largely responsible for popularizing the concept of \"modern Jahiliyya\" The Islamist author Syed Qutb commended Nadwi's writings for his use of the word jahiliyya to describe not a particular age in history (as earlier Muslim scholars did) but a state of moral corruption and materialism.Roxanne Leslie Euben, Princeton Readings in Islamist Thought: Texts and Contexts from Al-Banna to Bin Laden, p 108. He wrote 'Qisas al- Nabiyeen' (translated as 'Stories of the Prophets') for his nephew that became famous among the Arabic learners and the book was soon included in the syllabi for teaching Arabic at various institutions around the globe. Being a fan of Dr. Muhammad Iqbal, Ali Nadwi also undertook the task of introducing Iqbal and his Islamic thoughts to the Arab world. Thus, he wrote 'Rawa'i' Iqbal' which was subsequently rendered in to Urdu as 'Nuqoosh-i-Iqbal'. He wrote a detailed biography of his father in Urdu entitled 'Hayat-e-Abdul Haiy'. He also wrote a biographical account of his mother in 'Zikr-e-Khayr'. While he also penned his autobiography, 'Karawan-e-Zindagi', in 7 volumes. An adherent of pan-Islamism, he opposed secular Arab nationalism and pan-Arabism. He also had a lifelong association with the Tablighi Jamaat. Dr. Shah has summarized some of his salient thoughts in the following words: > 'Maulana Ali Nadwi sincerely and staunchly believed that the real threat to > the modern world, especially the Muslim world, is neither the lack of > material development nor the political disturbances, rather it\u2019s the moral > and spiritual decline. He firmly believed that Islam alone has the ability > to overturn this and thus Muslims must wake up to make an effort in this > regard. By staying back, he argued, the Muslims were not only failing > themselves rather the entire humanity! He stressed on Muslims, especially > those living in a Muslim majority countries (like Pakistan), to develop a > society based on Islamic principles that could become a model (for its moral > and spiritual values) for the rest of the world. He was a strong critic of > nationalism and stressed upon working for the humanity, collectively. He > also laid much emphasis on the crucial role women for upholding the > teachings of Islam in a society. Instead of trying to shut their doors for > the incoming western influence, he believed that the intellectual Muslims > should study the contemporary Western ideologies and form their own ideology > in its response, withholding the 'superior moral values of Islam'. He > opposed 'Islamic groups' from clashing with the 'secular elite' in Muslim > majority countries and instead encouraged for an 'inclusive approach' > wherein the 'secular elite' could be gradually and positively called towards > Islam, without causing any chaos in the society. Similarly, he also urged > Muslims living as a minority to maintain peace and create a valuable > position for themselves through hard work and exemplary morals.' ==Positions, honours and awards== * 1962 Founding member/Secretary of the first inaugural session and foundation of Muslim World League in Mecca.John L.
