    "text": "The Ostracon of Prince Sethherkhepshef is a painted limestone figured-ostracon of the son of Ramesses III. It is a standing, figured profile of Prince Sethherkhepshef (who later ascended the throne as Ramesses VIII) in an adoration pose, with outstretched arms, a sceptre in his left hand, and right hand, palm-forward. Behind Sethherkhepshef in a standard layout of figures and writing, is a vertical column of hieroglyphs reading \"king's son of his body, his beloved\" with his name (Seth-her-kepesh) appearing at the end. The ostracon was found in the Valley of the Queens, where a tomb (QV43) was built for the prince. It is currently in the Museo Egizio, Turin, Italy. Egyptian ostraca were used for artist's sketchings, cartoons-caricatures, letter documents, school-practice writing, and graffiti. This particular ostracon may be a sketch by an artisan working on the prince's tomb. ==References== *Johnson, Paul. The Civilization of Ancient Egypt. Harper Collins. 1999.
