His original name was Maurice de Frece. He was the brother of Walter de Frece and the husband of Fay Compton. He has sometimes been confused with a cousin called Lawrence Abraham de Frece, who was born in 1881 and died later the same year.\"DE FRECE, Lawrence Abraham\" in Register of Births for the London City Registration District, vol. 1c (1881), p. 12; \"DE FRECE, Lawrence Abraham, aged 0\" in Register of Deaths for the London City Registration District, vol. 1c (1881), p. 7 ==Life== The Liverpool Institute Fay Compton Born in Liverpool, Frece was one of the four sons of Harry de Frece, of the Gaiety Music Hall, Liverpool, a prosperous theatrical manager and agent from a Jewish theatrical family. The four sons were well educated at the Liverpool Institute High School for Boys, in the hope of keeping them out of the theatre. However, Frece's brother Jack became the manager of the Alhambra Wooden Theatre, Liverpool, his brother Isaac managed the Theatre Royal, Liverpool, and in 1890 his brother Walter gave up an apprenticeship with a Merseyside architect to marry Vesta Tilley, taking a job in the office of Warner's Theatrical Agency, and going on to become a leading theatrical impresario.Sir Walter de Frece MP at jewsfww.uk (British Jews in the First World War), accessed 26 March 2019Frank Graham, G. J. Mellor, Northern Music Hall At the Liverpool Institute, Frece was a contemporary of Albert Coates. In 1910, Frece appeared as Blatz in the musical The Balkan Princess. In 1912, he sang the part of Brissard in an Edinburgh production of Franz Leh\u00e1r's operetta The Count of Luxembourg, when he was one of the five principals, together with Daisy Burrell, Phyllis le Grand, Eric Thorne, and Robert Michaelis, collectively described by the Musical News as \"all consummate artists in their own style\".Musical News and Herald, vol. 42 (1912), p. 194 In 1914, after the death of the producer H. G. Pelissier, Frece married his young widow Fay Compton,\"Pelissier, Fay C. & Frece, Lauri de\" in Register of Marriages for Maidenhead Registration District, vol. 2c (1914), p. 1,004 with whom he later starred in The Labour Leader (1917).

In his Idols of the \"Halls\", Henry Chance Newton (1854\u20131931) recalled that \"I knew many de Freces, both of the Liverpudlian, and of the London brand; for example, that wonderful old couple, Isaac and Maurice de Frece, Walter's brother Jack, a big variety agent, also that late fine comedian, poor Lauri de Frece, who was the second husband of that brilliant young actress, Fay Compton\".Henry Chance Newton, Idols of the \"Halls\" (1975 reprint), p. 152 ==Musical theatre== *The Balkan Princess (1910) as Blatz *The Count of Luxembourg (1912) as BrissardLauri de Frece at operascotland.org, accessed 26 March 2019 *To-Night's the Night (1914) as HenryLauri de Frece at broadwayworld.com, accessed 26 March 2019 *The Happy Day (1916) as Walter *The Maid of the Mountains as Tonio ==Films== :Incomplete list *The Labour Leader (1917) *Once Upon a Time (1918) *All the Sad World Needs (1918) ==Notes== ==External links== *Lauri de Frece at National Portrait Gallery, London * *Lauri de Frece at discogs.com Category:1880 births Category:1921 deaths Category:English male film actors Category:English male stage actors Category:English male silent film actors Category:English male musical theatre actors Category:People educated at Liverpool Institute High School for Boys Category:Male actors from Liverpool Category:20th-century English male actors Category:20th-century English singers Category:20th-century male singers ",
