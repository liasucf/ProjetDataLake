    "text": "Engro Energy Limited (formerly Engro Powergen Limited) The story of Engro Energy goes back to 2008, when a fully owned subsidiary was incorporated by conglomerate Engro Corporation to develop power projects in Pakistan and beyond. Their first intervention in the energy sphere was launched in the form of Engro Powergen Qadirpur Limited which owns and operates a cutting edge 217 MW power plant in Qadirpur, Dharki and runs on permeate gas which was previously being flared. This unique aspect makes the Engro Powergen Qadirpur plant one of the few green power plants in Pakistan earning carbon credits. Moving further in its efforts to improve energy efficiency and ecosystem in the country, Engro Energy formed the Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company in collaboration with its partners to unearth and mine one of the world\u2019s largest lignite coal reserves in Thar \u2013 achieving a first for the country in terms of becoming one of the only private sector entity with the engineering capability, capacity and expertise to operate and optimize an open-pit mine. Soon thereafter, the Company ventured into establishment of 2\u00d7330 MW mine- mouth power plants in Tharparkar through a dedicated subsidiary, Engro Powergen Thar (Private) Limited. The culmination of these Thar coal projects from inception to financial close and including the stellar project management, which remains inclusive and collaborative, is testament to our organizational knowledge and skill in delivering projects of significant magnitude and strategic importance. In June 2019, they announced to invest to develop a solar power project in Balochistan. ==References== Category:Engro Corporation Category:Companies based in Karachi Category:Companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange Category:Energy companies established in 2008 Category:Electric power companies of Pakistan Category:Pakistani companies established in 2008 ",
