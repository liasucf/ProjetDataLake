The submarine was laid down on 21 December 1942 at the Howaldtswerke yard at Hamburg, launched on 7 March 1944, and commissioned on 17 April 1944 under the command of Leutnant zur See d.R. Sven Thienemann. ==Design== German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-682 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert GU 343/38\u20138 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to . The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . U-682 was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, (220 rounds), one Flak M42 and two twin C/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty. ==Service history== U-682 was destroyed during an air raid on the Howaldtswerke yard in Hamburg in the early hours of 11 March 1945. ==Sensors== ===Passive sonar=== U-682 was one of only ten Type VIIC's to be fitted with a Balkonger\u00e4t (literally 'Balcony apparatus or equipment'). The Balkonger\u00e4t was used on U-boats (, , , , , , , and ).Base on war-time photographs. The Balkonger\u00e4t was standard on the Type XXI and the Type XXIII. Nonetheless, it was also fitted to several Type IXs and one Type X. The Balkonger\u00e4t was an improved version of Gruppenhorchger\u00e4t (GHG) (group listening device). The GHG had 24 hydrophones, the Balkonger\u00e4t had 48 hydrophones and improved electronics, which enabled more accurate readings to be taken.
