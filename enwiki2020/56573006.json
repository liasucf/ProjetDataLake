    "text": "Monte Buchsbaum is a Professor of Psychiatry and Radiology at the University of California at San Diego. He was also the founder and editor in chief of Psychiatry Research from 1979 to 2019. ==Imaging research== Buchsbaum is a pioneer in the use of neuroimaging technology to study psychiatric disorders. In the early 1980s he, along with David Ingvar, performed the first positron emission tomography (PET) studies of patients with schizophrenia at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the patients had reduced glucose metabolism in the frontal lobe, a pattern known as hypofrontality. His research has led to him being called as an expert witness during criminal trials. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:University of California, San Diego faculty Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
