On 28 October 2015, the series was renewed for a second season and aired on Monday 21 March 2016. Contestants renovated two suburban houses, with one team eliminated each week. In season 1, the winner received a $100,000 cheque with half going to the winning couple\u2019s favourite charity and a new Mazda CX-5 and the runner up received $50,000 with half going to charity. Throughout the length of the competition, the contestants will stay in luxury style caravans provided by Elite Caravans. Each home will be judged by interior design experts who have been briefed by the home owners on the style they want for their renovation. In season two, the winning couple will again receive $100,000 but half will not go to charity. Each week, each home will be blind judged (unaware of which team renovated which one \u2013 or the rooms assigned to each individual couple) and the team with the lowest score that week will be eliminated from the competition. The series was cancelled due to unexpected low ratings during the second season. ==Format== ===Season 1=== Each week each individual team within the red & blue teams are allocated two rooms to deliver, first room is delivered within the first 48 hours, the highest scored individual team will receive immunity from elimination. The teams will then work on their second room the rest of the week, the team with the highest score are safe from elimination, the individual team with the lowest score in the losing team are eliminated. Every room receives a gift from the homeowners, they must work to the brief/style of this object to be scored highly. Each team are allocated a budget, they must work within this budget. ===Season 2=== Each week, both teams are given $200,000 to renovate their houses with each individual team within the red & blue teams allocated two rooms to deliver at the end of each week. The homeowners give each individual team a brief for their rooms. The whole team (red or blue) with the highest score are the weeks winning team and avoid elimination, the lowest scoring individual team in the losing team will be eliminated. ==Hosts and judges== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:100%;\" |+ Timeline of hosts, judges and other personnel ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8em;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Starring ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"12\"| Seasons |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| 1 ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| 2 |- | scope=\"row\" | Scott Cam || colspan=\"2\" |- | scope=\"row\" | Shelley Craft || colspan=\"1\" || colspan=\"1\" |- | scope=\"row\" | Colin McAllister || colspan=\"1\" || colspan=\"1\" |- | scope=\"row\" | Justin Ryan || colspan=\"1\" || colspan=\"1\" |- | scope=\"row\" | Darren Palmer || colspan=\"1\" || colspan=\"1\" |- | scope=\"row\" | Romy Alwill || colspan=\"1\" || colspan=\"1\" |} ==Series changes== In the first season of Reno Rumble, it pit former contestants from Nine Network series The Block against former contestants from Seven Network series House Rules.
