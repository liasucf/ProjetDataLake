    "text": "The Irish Freedom Party is a minor right-wing hard Eurosceptic political party in Ireland, launched on 8 September 2018. It advocates Irish withdrawal from the European Union. The party president is Hermann Kelly, a former teacher and journalist, who was the Director of Communications for Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD). The party chairperson is Professor Dolores Cahill. The party has no representation at local or national level. ==History== On 3 February 2018 an 'Irexit' conference was held in the RDS in Dublin, advocating an Irish withdrawal from the European Union. It was attended by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, author and columnist John Waters and academics Anthony Coughlan and Karen Devine. On 8 September 2018, a conference was held in the Bonnington Hotel in Dublin to launch the new party. Independent guest speakers at the launch included former Ambassador of Ireland to Canada Ray Bassett and Professor Ray Kinsella, a UCD economist. Approximately 250 people attended the event. In early March 2019, a number of regional newspapers reported that a party-member named 'Mairead Donovan' was listed on the organisation's website, and would be running as a candidate for local elections for Kerry County Council. The Ireland edition of The Times later reported that the candidate did not exist, and that the website image was a stock photograph. In responding to these reports, party spokesperson Hermann Kelly acknowledged the mistake and fault in allowing the placeholder profile and stock imagery to be published on the website, and clarified that the group was not planning to run any candidates in local elections. In late March 2019, the organisation launched a nationwide billboard campaign ahead of the European elections, reportedly funded by members of the party. Sources from the Irish advertising industry estimated that this may have cost up to \u20ac40,000. The party did not answer questions from The Irish Times about whether the donations received are in line with Standards in Public Office (SIPO) Commission guidelines. Under those guidelines, a third party must register with the Commission if a donation exceeding \u20ac100 is accepted which is directed towards a political purpose. The party had not registered as a third party with SIPO. Following its launch, the party held several regional public meetings, including one in Raheen, County Limerick during which broadcaster George Hook spoke about the \"politically correct\" Irish media. The party reportedly \"botched their [party registration] application\" by failing to \"tick its own box\" in advance of the European Parliament election. Hermann Kelly admitted their application was rejected because of a mistake made by the party and that it would need to resubmit the form. As a result, it was not registered as a political party before the deadline for nominations in the 2019 European elections (15 April 2019), and so candidates it had planned to put forward under the Irish Freedom Party name had to list themselves as independents. Hermann Kelly ran in the Dublin constituency, while party chairperson Dolores Cahill ran in the South constituency. Neither candidate was elected, with party leader Herman Kelly receiving 2,441 (0.67%) first preference votes, and Cahill receiving 10,582 (1.47%) first preference votes. The party's registration was subsequently completed, and the Irish Freedom Party (IFP) was included on the Register of Political Parties as of 13 June 2019. The Irish Freedom Party contested its first election as a registered political party in the 2019 Wexford by- election, running Melissa O'Neill, a former member of Sinn F\u00e9in who served on Kilkenny County Council from 2014 to 2019. She received 489 (1.2%) first preference votes and was eliminated on the first count. Party member Conor Rafferty ran in Mid Ulster in the 2019 UK General Election, as an independent since the party is unregistered in Northern Ireland, gaining 690 votes (1.5%). The party fielded 11 candidates in the 2020 Irish general election, with none being elected, and candidates achieving a share of first preference votes between 0.19% (119 votes) and 2.06% (956 votes) in their respective constituencies. Party chairperson Dolores Cahill came second-last in the Tipperary constituency with 0.6% of first preference votes (521 votes). During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a number of representatives of the Irish Freedom Party spoke at an anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown rally. The protest rally, held in Dublin and attended by Ben Gilroy and Dolores Cahill, was linked to far-right groups by several media outlets. Cahill also spoke at an anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown event in London. ==Ideology== Aside from advocating an exit from the EU, the party states that it is a \"patriotic party\" which is \"pro-natalist and supportive of stable families for procreation\". The party has published policies in favour of reduced government spending, lower tax, freedom of speech and association, and in opposition to the carbon tax. It advocates independence from \"either London or Brussels\", desiring to leave the EU and to re-unify of Ireland by consent. It advocates \"zero tolerance\" of corruption and the \"separation of powers\" in the state. Some commentators have linked party leader Hermann Kelly with alt-right ideologies, pointing to a recorded discussion which Kelly had in 2018 with far-right activist and former British National Party member Jim Dowson. In the video Kelly said \"The first thing they want to do is kill Irish kids and [they] want to replace them with every nationality who wants to come into our country\", a statement which several news outlets associated with the great replacement conspiracy theory. In 2019, Kelly stated that \"those talking about a Great Replacement in Ireland have a point\", and in an interview with LifeSiteNews, referred to what he called the \"great replacement of our children\". Kelly later stated that he believes in \"one human race\" and has not supported \"theories of racial superiority\". ==Election results== ===D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
