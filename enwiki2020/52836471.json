The ensemble appears in various forms, both instrumental and vocal, ranging from 2 to 10 artists. The adventure began in 2002 with \"Fantasy in Blue\", a program featuring works by Purcell and Gershwin, with mezzo-soprano Rinat Shaham. The CD was hailed by Le Monde as \"a real knockout\". Petrarch\u2019s 700th birthday (2004) was marked by a tribute program with Guillemette Laurens. In 2006, Canta Napoli was a journey through 400 years of Neapolitan songs and its great singers. In 2007, Fuoco E Cenere\u2019s interpretation of Marco da Gagliano\u2019s La Dafne was awarded an Orph\u00e9e d'Or by the Acad\u00e9mie du Disque Lyrique. The ensemble first theatrical endeavor Je Suis Ton Labyrinthe was staged by David Lippe in 2008, during a residence at the International Institute of Puppetry of Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res. A mix of live music and object theater, the production starred Isabelle Poulenard and Guillemette Laurens and was recorded on the Arion label as Umana e Inumana. Pulcinella was created in 2009 in collaboration with the Neapolitan puppeteer master Bruno Leone, and allowed the music of Pergolese to meet the art of burattinaio. This program was presented at the International Museum of Puppetry in Sicily and at the Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in Paris.
