    "text": "Hans D. Baumann is a German-American inventor and engineer. He has registered over 200 patents and produced 105 publications. He is known internationally as a valve specialist and is an expert on aerodynamic noise of gases and he is a frequent contributor to the NEWSMAX Magazine INSIDERS website. ==Life== Baumann came to the United States from Germany in 1953, as an exchange student. He holds degrees from [Case institute of Technology (now part of Case Western Reserve University)] and Northeastern University, and earned a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia Pacific University. Baumann has worked as Chief Engineer at W. & T. Co., a valve supplier in Germany; Manager of Research & Development at Worthington S/A in France; Director of Engineering at Cashco, Inc., in the U.S.; Vice President of Masoneilan International, Inc.; and Senior Vice President of Technology for Fisher Controls. In 1977, he founded H. D. Baumann Assoc., Ltd., manufacturing control valves; the company was subsequently acquired by Fisher Instruments, and is now part of Emerson Process Management. Baumann is a licensed Professional Engineer in four states and a member of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society. ==Awards== * Honorary Member of the International Society of Automation * Inductee \"Process Automation Hall of Fame\" * Life Fellow Member of the American Society mechanical Engineers. ==Publications== * \"Top-heavy management drains companies\", InTech, May 2008 * \"Outsourcing\u2014Good or Evil?\", Mechanical Engineering * Control Valve Primer: A User's Guide () * The Ideal Enterprise (). * Hitler's Fate: The Final Story (). * Building Lean Companies: How To Keep Companies Profitable As They Grow () * The Vanished Life of Eva Braun () * Atomic Irony, how German Uranium helped to defeat Japan () ==Significant scientific publications== * Source: INTERNATIONAL ELECTRICAL COIMMISSION, Geneva, Switzerland.
