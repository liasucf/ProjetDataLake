He made his MLB debut with the Washington Nationals in 2016. ==Career== ===Minor Leagues=== L\u00f3pez signed with the Washington Nationals as an international free agent in June 2012. His signing bonus of just $17,000 was relatively tiny compared to most other contemporaneous Latin American prospects that would reach his same level of success in the minor leagues. The lower signing bonus may have been because Lopez took several years off of baseball to finish his highschool degree, and signed at age 18. He made his professional debut that season with the Dominican Summer League Nationals where he pitched to a 1-1 record and 3.38 ERA in 10.2 innings pitched. L\u00f3pez started one game each for both the Auburn Doubledays and Hagerstown Suns in 2013. He pitched for the same two teams in 2014, starting 16 games and finishing with a 7-3 record and 1.08 ERA. In 2015, he pitched for the Potomac Nationals where he was 6-7 with a 4.09 ERA in 19 starts. L\u00f3pez started the 2016 season with the Harrisburg Senators. After posting a 3.18 ERA with the Senators through 14 starts, he was promoted to the Syracuse Chiefs on June 27, 2016. He appeared in the 2016 All-Star Futures Game, retiring all three batters he faced as a pitcher for Team World. ===Major Leagues=== ====Washington Nationals==== On July 17, 2016, Nationals manager Dusty Baker announced L\u00f3pez would be called up to make his major league debut with a start on July 19, 2016, against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.

After he allowed three batters to reach base and gave up two more runs in the fifth inning, he was relieved. He had pitched 4\u2154 innings, throwing 105 pitches (65 for strikes), giving up six runs (all earned) on 10 hits (including one home run), and walking one but striking out nine.Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Washington Nationals \u2013 Box Score \u2013 July 19, 2016 \u2013 ESPNmlb.com LAD vs. WSH 07/19/2016 The Nationals lost the game 8-4, and he was the game's losing pitcher.
