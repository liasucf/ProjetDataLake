    "text": "is a 1951 Japanese film directed by Akira Kurosawa. It is based on the 1869 novel The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoevsky. The original 265-minute version of the film, faithful to the novel, has been lost for many years. A nearly three-hour release, reflecting a 100-minute studio imposed cut, survives as the most complete version of the film available for contemporary audiences. ==Plot== After narrowly escaping death during the recent war, Kameda returns to Japan from Okinawa, where he has been confined to an asylum. Because he is subject to seizures of epilepsy and emotional instability, he is considered to be mentally ill. During his journey home, he meets and becomes friends with Akama, who is returning home to receive his inheritance after a long estrangement because of his love for Taeko, who has been the mistress of Tohata since her childhood. Tohata, fearing disgrace for his abusive treatment of Taeko, has agreed to provide a dowry of Y600,000 to Kayama. In a threatening confrontation, Akama offers him Y1,000,000 not to marry her. Despised by women and treated as chattel by the other men, Taeko realizes it is only Kameda who sees who she truly is when he looks deep into her soul and tells her \u201cYou\u2019re not that kind of person.\u201d Akama proposes to Taeko, but she delays responding. Akama jealously interprets this to mean that she is really in love with Kameda. His jealousy grows until he ultimately murders Taeko and both men go mad with grief. ==Cast== * Masayuki Mori as Kinji Kameda, the idiot (based on Prince Myshkin) * Toshiro Mifune as Denkichi Akama (based on Rog\u00f3zhin) * Setsuko Hara as Taeko Nasu (based on Nastasya Filippovna) * Yoshiko Kuga as Ayako (based on Agl\u00e1ya Iv\u00e1novna) * Takashi Shimura as Ono, Ayako's father (based on General Epanch\u00edn) * Chieko Higashiyama as Satoko, Ayako's mother (based on Lizav\u00e9ta Prok\u00f3fyevna) * Eijir\u014d Yanagi as Tohata (based on Totskiy) * Minoru Chiaki as Mutsuo Kayama, the secretary * Noriko Sengoku as Takako ==Production background== The film is in black and white at an aspect ratio of 1.37:1. This was Kurosawa's second film for the Shochiku studio, after Scandal (1950). It was originally intended to be a two-part film with a running time of 265 minutes. After a single, poorly received, screening of the full-length version, the film was severely cut at the request of the studio. This was against Kurosawa's wishes. When the re-edited version was also deemed too long by the studio, Kurosawa sardonically suggested the film be cut lengthwise instead. According to Japanese film scholar Donald Richie, there are no existing prints of the original 265-minute version. Kurosawa would return to Shochiku later to make Rhapsody in August (1991), and, according to Alex Cox, is said to have searched the Shochiku archives for the original cut of the film to no avail. ==Reception== Rotten Tomatoes reports 78% approval for The Idiot among nine critics, with an average rating of 6.9/10. ==See also== *List of incomplete or partially lost films ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1951 films Category:1951 drama films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese drama films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Japanese black-and-white films Category:Films based on The Idiot Category:Films directed by Akira Kurosawa Category:Films with screenplays by Akira Kurosawa Category:Shochiku films Category:Films scored by Fumio Hayasaka Category:Films set in Hokkaido ",
