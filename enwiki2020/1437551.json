    "text": "Ptichka or Buria (, \"little bird\"; , \"storm\" or \"tempest\"; GRAU index serial number 11F35 2K) are nicknames for the second Buran-class orbiter, produced as part of the Soviet/Russian Buran programme. Although Ptichka was closest to being completed of any of the Buran-class orbiters (after the orbiter Buran), it was never finished. The program was officially cancelled in 1993, at which point the shuttle was 95-97% complete. == Projected flights == Ptichka was preparing to its maiden flight to perform the first fully regular Buran-class orbiter operation (Buran in its flight was lacking regular thermal control and power systems). Buria also had to get remote manipulator and docking system. As on 1989, orbital flight test program for second orbiter was split into two missions, with space station approach test on the second, but delays in preparations changed the plans to perform all test tasks in one maiden flight, scheduled on to December 1991. Mission profile included: * unmanned launch * automatic docking with Mir's Kristall module. * crew transfer from Mir to the spaceplane, with onboard systems testing in course of twenty-four hours. * remote manipulator testing * undocking and autonomous flight in orbit * Manned Soyuz TM No.101 docking to the orbiter. * crew transfer from the Soyuz to the spaceplane and on board work in the course of twenty-four hours * automatic undocking and landing == After program cancellation == Ptichka was put on storage into MZK building (Russian: \u041c\u0417\u041a, \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441, Assembling and Fueling Facility.) at Baikonur Cosmodrome, together with its full size test article OK-MT. Media speculated that Ptichka is the property of Kazakhstan-Russia Joint Venture Company Aelita, a subsidiary of RKK Energia. == See also == * * == References == == External links == * 1.02 orbiter * Photoset of MZK building, current state of stored orbiter Category:Cancelled Soviet spacecraft Category:Buran-class orbiters ",
