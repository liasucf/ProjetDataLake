It was one of the sources of water supply in Timi\u0219oara at the beginning of the 20th century. Turnurile de ap\u0103, timisoara-info.ro, access date: 30 March 2017 It is classified as a National Heritage Site () with LMI code TM-II-m-A-06152. == History == The Water Tower in Iosefin was built between 1913 and 1914, as a twin of the one in Fabric neighbourhood. The 52-meter-tall towers were built at the two ends of the distribution system with the aim of compensating for the maximum consumption level during the day.Ilie Vlaicu, Ioan Ha\u021began (2012).

The space was considered too small for a restaurant or a caf\u00e9. And if it were sold, the investor may only be interested in the 2700 m2 of land and the tower would no longer be preserved. Nevertheless, the idea of selling the tower was not abandoned, as it is preferred to the leasing or the letting, which would not make much money for the City Hall. Its location, near the Bega River, was perfect for its initial purpose, but, unlike the water towers in , Drobeta-Turnu Severin Turnul de Ap\u0103 \u2013 Istoria unui simbol al municipiului Drobeta Turnu Severin, news-mehedinti.ro, 2 June 2014, access date: 31 March 2017 or Szeged, the area where it is situated is far away from the city center, and there are no other landmarks around. The tower could be the final destination of a tourist circuit through the Iosefin neighbourhood, but at the moment there is no such circuit, which makes it of no interest to the private investors. The tower is now being used only as a GSM antenna holder. However, the desire to renovate it and include it on the list of different activities is there.
