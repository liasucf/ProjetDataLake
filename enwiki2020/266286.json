    "text": "Don Mueang International Airport (, , or colloquially as , ) is one of two international airports serving the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, the other one being Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK). Before Suvarnabhumi opened in 2006, Don Mueang was previously known as Bangkok International Airport. The airport is considered to be one of the world's oldest international airports and Asia's oldest operating airport. It was officially opened as a Royal Thai Air Force base on 27 March 1914, although it had been in use earlier. Commercial flights began in 1924, making it one of the world's oldest commercial airports. The first commercial flight was an arrival by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. In September 2006, Don Mueang Airport was closed and replaced by the newly opened Suvarnabhumi Airport, before reopening on 24 March 2007 after renovations. Since the opening of the new airport, it has become a regional commuter flight hub and the de facto low-cost airline hub. In 2015, it became the world's largest low cost carrier airport. Don Mueang previously carried the BKK IATA code, which subsequently transferred to Suvarnabhumi and was an important hub of Asia and the hub of Thai Airways International prior to its closure. At its peak, it served most air traffic for the entire country, with 80 airlines operating 160,000 flights and handling over 38 million passengers and 700,000 tons of cargo in 2004. It was then the 14th busiest airport in the world and 2nd in Asia by passenger volume. Currently, Don Mueang is the main hub for Nok Air, Thai AirAsia and Thai Lion Air. ==History== ===Early years=== FAA diagram \"Don Mueang\" airfield was the second established in Thailand, after Sa Pathum airfield, which is now Sa Pathum horse racing course, known as the Royal Bangkok Sports Club. The first flights to Don Mueang were made on 8 March 1914 and involved the transfer of aircraft of the Royal Thai Air Force. Three years earlier, Thailand had sent three army officers to France to train as pilots. On completion of their training in 1911, the pilots were authorized to purchase eight aircraft, four Breguets and four Nieuports, which formed the basis of the Royal Thai Air Force. Sa Pathum airfield was established in February 1911 with an arrival by Orville Wright, seven years after the invention of the first airplane by the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903. In 1933, the airfield was the scene of heavy fighting between royalists and government forces during the Boworadet Rebellion. The airfield was used by the occupying Japanese during World War II, and was bombed and strafed by Allied aircraft on several occasions. After the war had finished in September 1945, the airfield was occupied by the RAF during the brief British occupation of Thailand until March 1946 when 211 Squadron, which moved there in October 1945, was disbanded.Bomber Squadrons of the R.A.F. and their Aircraft, Philip Moyes , 1964, Macdonald & Co. (Publishers) Ltd., London, p. 200 During the Vietnam War, Don Mueang was a major command and logistics hub of the United States Air Force. Before the opening of Suvarnabhumi, the airport used the IATA airport code BKK and the name was spelled \"Don Muang\". After Suvarnabhumi opened for commercial flights, the spelling was changed and as \"Don Mueang\" it now uses the airport code DMK, though it still retains the ICAO airport code VTBD. The traditional spelling is still used by many airlines and by most Thais. ===Closure=== The night of 27\u201328 September 2006 was the official end of operations at Don Mueang airport. The last commercial flights were: * International departure: Although scheduled for Kuwait Airways KU414 to Kuwait at 02:50, Qantas flight QF302 to Sydney, originally scheduled for 18:00, was delayed for more than nine hours before finally taking off at 03:12, about ten minutes after the Kuwait flight. Qantas claimed that QF302 was an extra flight.\"Qantas steals show at last minute\" , Bangkok Post, 29 September 2006 * International arrival: Kuwait Airways from Jakarta at 01:30 * Domestic departure: Thai Airways TG124 to Chiang Mai at 22:15 (coincidentally, when Thai moved domestic operations back to Don Mueang again on 28 March 2009, their last departure was also a 22:15 flight to Chiang Mai) * Domestic arrival: TG216 from Phuket at 23:00 ===Reopening=== Aerial photo of DMK at Night Commercial carriers deserted Don Mueang at the opening of Suvarnabhumi Airport. But the higher operating costs of the new airport and safety concerns over cracked runways at the new airport caused many to seek a return to Don Mueang. Low-cost airlines led demands for a reopening of the airport. Airports of Thailand released a report at the end of 2006 which furthered this effort. The report proposed reopening DMK as a way to avoid or delay second-stage expansion which had been planned for Suvarnabhumi.\"In With the Old\", Aviation Week & Space Technology, 1 January 2007. On 30 January 2007, the Ministry of Transport recommended temporarily reopening Don Mueang while touch up work proceeded on some taxiways at Suvarnabhumi. The recommendation was subject to approval by the Thai cabinet. On 25 March 2007, the airport officially reopened for some domestic flights. Terminal 2 of Don Muang International Airport Because of the 2011 Thailand floods that affected Bangkok and other parts of Thailand, the airport was closed as flood waters flowed onto the runways and affected the lighting.Don Muang Airport (DMK) Bangkok Thailand | Don Muang Airport Guide. Donmuangairportonline.com. Retrieved on 25 August 2013. Don Mueang reopened on 6 March 2012. On 16 March 2012, the Government of Thailand and Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered all low-cost, chartered, and non-connecting flights to relocate to Don Mueang. This ended the single-airport policy. Airports of Thailand was ordered to encourage low- cost carriers to shift to Don Mueang to help ease congestion at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Suvarnabhumi airport was designed to handle 45 million passengers per year, but it processed 48 million in 2011 and number was expected to reach 53 million in 2012. Some ten airlines may relocate to Don Mueang. Budget airline Nok Air is already serving flights from and to Don Mueang. Nok Air handles about four million passengers per year. Orient Thai Airlines and Thai AirAsia have also started operations at Don Mueang. Thai AirAsia carried 7.2 million passengers in 2011. The number is projected to grow to eight million in 2012. ===Expansion=== Currently Terminal 1 is capable of handling 18.5 million passengers annually. On 7 September 2013, Airports of Thailand announced its three billion baht renovation to reopen Terminal 2 as early as May 2014. Terminal 1's passengers in 2013 will likely reach 16 million against its capacity of 18.5 million. Completion of Terminal 2 in December 2015 increases Don Mueang's passenger capacity to 30 million a year. The third phase of Don Mueang's 38 billion baht expansion will stretch from 2018 to 2024. It aims to increase the airport's passenger capacity to 48 million per year from its 38 million passengers in 2017. The new 155,000 m2 international Terminal 3 will accommodate 18 million passengers a year by 2022. ==Terminals== Don Mueang International Airport, Terminal 2, Departure Hall, before the 2006 opening of Suvarnabhumi Airport, 2011 Thailand floods and 2015 renovation/opening. Don Mueang International Airport has three terminals. Terminal 1 is used for international flights and Terminal 2 for domestic flights. The opening of Terminal 2 has raised the airport's capacity to 30 million passengers per year. Terminal 3, the old domestic terminal, is not in use anymore. In a third phase of airport expansion, a new Terminal 3 is in the planning stages , with construction projected to begin sometime between 2020\u20132025. The new terminal will have a capacity of 18 million passengers yearly. As part of the 39 billion baht project, Terminals 1 and 2 will be upgraded to handle 22 million domestic passengers annually, raising overall airport capacity from 30 to 40 million annually. ==Airlines and destinations== ==Traffic statistics== In 2019, the airport reached its full capacity of 52 flights per hour, or about 700\u2013800 flights per day. By the end of 2019, it is expected to top its maximum passenger handling capacity of 40 million. Airport manager AoT forecasts 41 million passengers in 2020 and 45 million by 2023. The airport was designed to serve a maximum of 30 million passengers annually. Building additional runways is not possible. AoT is encouraging airlines to use wide-body aircraft at Don Mueang to increase passenger loads from 100\u2013200 passengers to about 300 per aircraft. ===Passenger figures=== A Thai Lion Air Boeing 737-900ER bound for Hat Yai.
