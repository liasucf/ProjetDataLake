    "text": "Advaita Ved\u0101nta (; , IAST: ', literally, \"non-duality\") is a school of Hindu philosophy, and is a classic system of spiritual realization in Indian tradition. The term Advaita refers to the idea that Brahman alone is ultimately real, the phenomenal transient world is an illusory appearance (maya) of Brahman, and the true self, atman, is not different from Brahman. Originally known as Puru\u1e63av\u0101da and as m\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da, the followers of this school are known as Advaita Vedantins, or just Advaitins, regarding the phenomenal world as mere illusory appearance of plurality, experienced through the sense- impressions by ignorance (avidya), an illusion superimposed (adhy\u0101sa) on the sole reality of Brahman.Swami Vireshwarananda (1936), Adhyasa or Superimposition They seek moksha (liberation) through recognizing this illusoriness of the phenomenal world and acquiring vidy\u0101 (knowledge) of one's true identity as Atman, and the identity of Atman and Brahman. Adi Shankara, the most prominent exponent of Advaita Ved\u0101nta tradition. Advaita Ved\u0101nta traces its roots to the oldest Upanishads. It relies on three textual sources called the Prasthanatrayi. It gives \"a unifying interpretation of the whole body of Upanishads\", the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavad Git\u0101.Sangeetha Menon (2012), Advaita Vedanta, IEP Advaita Ved\u0101nta is the oldest extant sub-school of Ved\u0101nta, which is one of the six orthodox (\u0101stika) Hindu philosophies (). Although its roots trace back to the 1st millennium BCE, the most prominent exponent of the Advaita Ved\u0101nta is considered by tradition to be the 8th century scholar Adi Shankara.Stephen Phillips (1998), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Motilal Banarsidass, , p. 332 note 68 Advaita Ved\u0101nta emphasizes Jivanmukti, the idea that moksha (freedom, liberation) is achievable in this life in contrast to other Indian philosophies that emphasize videhamukti, or moksha after death. The school uses concepts such as Brahman, Atman, Maya, Avidya, meditation and others that are found in major Indian religious traditions, but interprets them in its own way for its theories of moksha. Advaita Ved\u0101nta is one of the most studied and most influential schools of classical Indian thought. Many scholars describe it as a form of monism,Sangeetha Menon (2012), Advaita Vedanta, IEP; Quote: \"The essential philosophy of Advaita is an idealist monism, and is considered to be presented first in the Upani\u1e63ads and consolidated in the Brahma S\u016btra by this tradition.\"JN Mohanty (1980), \"Understanding some Ontological Differences in Indian Philosophy\", Journal of Indian Philosophy, Volume8, Issue3, page205, Quote: \"Nyaya-Vaiseshika is realistic; Advaita Vedanta is idealistic. The former is pluralistic, the latter monistic.\" while others describe the Advaita philosophy as non-dualistic.Joseph Milne (1997), \"Advaita Vedanta and typologies of multiplicity and unity: An interpretation of nondual knowledge\", International Journal of Hindu Studies, Volume1, Issue1, pp. 165\u2013188 Advaita is considered to be a philosophy or spiritual pathway rather than a religion, as it does not require those who follow it to be of a particular faith or sect. Advaita influenced and was influenced by various traditions and texts of Hindu philosophies such as Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, other sub-schools of Ved\u0101nta, Vaishnavism, Shaivism, the Puranas, the Agamas, as well as social movements such as the Bhakti movement. Beyond Hinduism, Advaita Ved\u0101nta interacted and developed with the other traditions of India such as Jainism and Buddhism. Advaita Ved\u0101nta texts espouse a spectrum of views from idealism, including illusionism, to realist or nearly realist positions expressed in the early works of Shankara. In modern times, its views appear in various Neo-Ved\u0101nta movements. It has been termed as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality. ==Etymology and nomenclature== The word Advaita is a composite of two Sanskrit words: * Prefix \"A-\"(\u0905), which has similar meaning of english prefix \"Non-\" * \"Dvaita\"(\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0948\u0924), which means 'Duality' or 'Dualism'. Advaita is often translated as \"non-duality,\" but a more apt translation is \"non- secondness.\"Sangeetha Menon, Advaita Vedanta, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy It means that there is no other reality than Brahman, that \"Reality is not constituted by parts,\" that is, ever-changing \"things\" have no existence of their own, but are appearances of the one Existent, Brahman; and that there is no duality between the essence, or Being, of a person (atman), and Brahman, the Ground of Being.The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions The word Ved\u0101nta is a composition of the two Sanskrit words. The word Veda refers to the whole corpus of vedic texts, and the other word \"Anta\" which means 'End'. The meaning of Ved\u0101nta can be summed up as \"the end of the vedas\" or \"the ultimate knowledge of the vedas\". Ved\u0101nta is one of six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy. Originally known as Puru\u1e63av\u0101da, and as m\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da, akin to Madhyamaka Buddhism, due to their insistence that phenomena ultimately lack an inherent essence or reality,David N. Lorenzen (ed.)(2015), A dialogue between a Christian and a Hindu about religion, El Colegio de Mexico ACRobert D. Baird (1986), Swami Bhativedanta and the Bhagavd Gita As It Is. In: Robert Neil Minor (ed,), Modern Indian Interpreters of the Bhagavad Gita, SUNY PressGoswami Abhay Charan Bhaktivedanta (1956)Shri Krishna' The Supreme 'Vedantist the Advaita Ved\u0101nta school has been historically referred to by various names, such as Advaita-vada (speaker of Advaita), Abheda- darshana (view of non-difference), Dvaita-vada-pratisedha (denial of dual distinctions), and Kevala-dvaita (non-dualism of the isolated). According to Richard King, a professor of Buddhist and Asian studies, the term Advaita first occurs in a recognizably Vedantic context in the prose of Mandukya Upanishad. In contrast, according to Frits Staal, a professor of philosophy specializing in Sanskrit and Vedic studies, the word Advaita is from the Vedic era, and the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya (8th or 7th-century BCEBen-Ami Scharfstein (1998), A comparative history of world philosophy: from the Upanishads to Kant, Albany: State University of New York Press, pp. 9\u201311) is credited to be the one who coined it. Stephen Phillips, a professor of philosophy and Asian studies, translates the Advaita containing verse excerpt in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, as \"An ocean, a single seer without duality becomes he whose world is Brahman.\" ==Dar\u015bana (view) \u2013 central concerns== A drop merging in the Ocean, an analogy for the Atman merging into the Brahman Advaita is a subschool of Ved\u0101nta, the latter being one of the six classical Hindu dar\u015banas, an integrated body of textual interpretations and religious practices which aim at the attainment of moksha, release or liberation from transmigratory existence.. Traditional Advaita Ved\u0101nta centers on the study and what it believes to be correct understanding of the sruti, revealed texts, especially the Principal Upanishads, along with the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Git\u0101, which are collectively called as Prasthantrayi. Correct understanding is believed to provide knowledge of one's true identity as \u0100tman, the dispassionate and unchanging witness-consciousness, and the identity of \u0100tman and Brahman, which results in liberation., quote: \"According to Advaita, the pure subject is our true self whose knowledge is liberative, (...) If the subject could be realised in its purity then all misery would cease: this is called self-knowledge\" This is achieved through what Adi Shankara refers to as anubhava, immediate intuition, a direct awareness which is construction-free, and not construction-filled. It is not an awareness of Brahman, but instead an awareness that is Brahman. Correct knowledge, which destroys avidya, the ignorance that constitutes the psychological and perceptual errors which obscure the true nature of Atman and Brahman, is obtained by following the four stages of samanyasa (self-cultivation), sravana, listening to the teachings of the sages, manana, reflection on the teachings, and sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya, contemplation of the truth \"that art Thou\". The Advaita Ved\u0101nta tradition rejects the dualism of Samkhya purusha (primal consciousness) and prakriti (inert primal matter), By accepting this postulation, various theoretical difficulties arise which Advaita and other Ved\u0101nta traditions offer different answers for. A main question is the relation between Atman and Brahman, which is solved by regarding them to be identical. This truth is established from the oldest Principal Upanishads and Brahma Sutras, and is also found in parts of the Bhagavad Git\u0101 and numerous other Hindu texts, and is regarded to be self-evident. The main aim of the commentaries is to support this nondualistic (of Atman and Brahman) reading of the sruti. Reason is being used to support revelation, the sruti, the ultimate source of truth. Another question is how Brahman can create the world, and how to explain the manifoldness of phenomenal reality. By declaring phenomenal reality to be an 'illusion,' the primacy of Atman/Brahman can be maintained. The Advaita literature also provide a criticism of opposing systems, including the dualistic school of Hinduism, as well as other Nastika (heterodox) philosophies such as Buddhism. ==Moksha \u2013 liberation through knowledge of Brahman== ===Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha \u2013 the four goals of human life=== Advaita, like other schools, accepts Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha \u2013 the four goals of human life as natural and proper: * Dharma: the right way to life, the \"duties and obligations of the individual toward himself and the society as well as those of the society toward the individual\"; * Artha: the means to support and sustain one's life; * K\u0101ma: pleasure and enjoyment; * Mok\u1e63a: liberation, release. Of these, much of the Advaita Ved\u0101nta philosophy focuses on the last, gaining liberation in one's current life.KN Tiwari (1998), Dimensions of Renunciation in Advaita Vedanta, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 1\u20135 with footnote 3 The first three are discussed and encouraged by Advaitins, but usually in the context of knowing Brahman and Self-realization.Karl Potter (2008), Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Ved\u0101nta, Volume 3, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 121\u2013125, 128, 144\u2013145 ===Moksha \u2013 liberation=== The soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge and complete understanding of the identity of Atman and Brahman. Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman leads to dissolution of all dualistic tendencies and to liberation, Moksha is attained by realizing one's true identity as \u0100tman, and the identity of Atman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life. This is stated by Shankara as follows: According to Advaita Ved\u0101nta, liberation can be achieved while living, and is called Jivanmukti. The Atman-knowledge, that is the knowledge of true Self and its relationship to Brahman is central to this liberation in Advaita thought. Atman-knowledge, to Advaitins, is that state of full awareness, liberation and freedom which overcomes dualities at all levels, realizing the divine within oneself, the divine in others and all beings, the non-dual Oneness, that Brahman is in everything, and everything is Brahman. According to Rambachan, in Advaita, this state of liberating self- knowledge includes and leads to the understanding that \"the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self.\" ====Jivanmukta==== In Advaita Ved\u0101nta, the interest is not in liberation in after life, but in one's current life. This school holds that liberation can be achieved while living, and a person who achieves this is called a Jivanmukta.Paul Deussen, The philosophy of the Upanishads, Translated by A.S. Geden (1906), T&T; Clark, Edinburgh Ramana Maharshi, the Indian sage who was widely regarded as a Jivanmukta The concept of Jivanmukti of Advaita Ved\u0101nta contrasts with Videhamukti (moksha from samsara after death) in theistic sub-schools of Ved\u0101nta.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1 & 2, Jivanmukti is a state that transforms the nature, attributes and behaviors of an individual, after which the liberated individual shows attributes such as:[a] K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, Canada, pp 140\u2013147; [b] S. Nikhilananda (1958), Hinduism : Its meaning for the liberation of the spirit, Harper, , pp 53\u201379; [c] Andrew Fort (1998), Jivanmukti in Transformation: Embodied Liberation in Advaita and Neo-Vedanta, State University of New York Press, * he is not bothered by disrespect and endures cruel words, treats others with respect regardless of how others treat him; * when confronted by an angry person he does not return anger, instead replies with soft and kind words; * even if tortured, he speaks and trusts the truth; * he does not crave for blessings or expect praise from others; * he never injures or harms any life or being (ahimsa), he is intent in the welfare of all beings; * he is as comfortable being alone as in the presence of others; * he is as comfortable with a bowl, at the foot of a tree in tattered robe without help, as when he is in a mithuna (union of mendicants), grama (village) and nagara (city); * he does not care about or wear sikha (tuft of hair on the back of head for religious reasons), nor the holy thread across his body. To him, knowledge is sikha, knowledge is the holy thread, knowledge alone is supreme. Outer appearances and rituals do not matter to him, only knowledge matters; * for him there is no invocation nor dismissal of deities, no mantra nor non-mantra, no prostrations nor worship of gods, goddess or ancestors, nothing other than knowledge of Self; * he is humble, high spirited, of clear and steady mind, straightforward, compassionate, patient, indifferent, courageous, speaks firmly and with sweet words. ===Vidya, Sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya and Anubhava=== Sruti (scriptures), proper reasoning and meditation are the main sources of knowledge (vidya) for the Advaita Ved\u0101nta tradition. It teaches that correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman is achievable by sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya, study of the self and of the Vedic texts, and three stages of practice: sravana (perception, hearing), manana (thinking) and nididhyasana (meditation), a three-step methodology that is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. Sravana literally means hearing, and broadly refers to perception and observations typically aided by a counsellor or teacher (guru), wherein the Advaitin listens and discusses the ideas, concepts, questions and answers. Manana refers to thinking on these discussions and contemplating over the various ideas based on svadhyaya and sravana. Nididhy\u0101sana refers to meditation, realization and consequent conviction of the truths, non-duality and a state where there is a fusion of thought and action, knowing and being. Bilimoria states that these three stages of Advaita practice can be viewed as sadhana practice that unifies Yoga and Karma ideas, and was most likely derived from these older traditions. Adi Shankara uses anubhava interchangeably with pratipatta, \"understanding\". Dalal and others state that anubhava does not center around some sort of \"mystical experience,\" but around the correct knowledge of Brahman. Nikhalananda states that (knowledge of) Atman and Brahman can only be reached by buddhi, \"reason,\" stating that mysticism is a kind of intuitive knowledge, while buddhi is the highest means of attaining knowledge. ===Mahavakya \u2013 The Great Sentences=== Several Mahavakyas, or \"the great sentences\", have Advaitic theme, that is \"the inner immortal self and the great cosmic power are one and the same\". {| cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" |- !Sr. No. !Vakya !Meaning !Upanishad !Veda |- |1 |\u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u0902 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e (praj\u00f1\u0101nam brahma) |Praj\u00f1\u0101nam is Brahman | Aitareya V.3 | Rigveda |- |2. | \u0905\u0939\u0902 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093f (aham brahm\u0101smi) |I am Brahman, or I am Divine | Brhad\u0101ranyaka I.4.10 | Shukla Yajurveda |- |3. | \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092e\u0938\u093f (tat tvam asi) |That thou art, or You are that | Chandogya VI.8.7 |Samaveda |- |4. |\u0905\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e (ayam\u0101tm\u0101 brahma) |This Atman is Brahman | Mandukya II |Atharvaveda |} ===Stages and practices=== Advaita Ved\u0101nta entails more than self-inquiry or bare insight into one's real nature, but also includes self-restraint, textual studies and ethical perfection. It is described in classical Advaita books like Shankara's Upadesasahasri and the Vivekachudamani, which is also attributed to Shankara. ====Jnana Yoga \u2013 path of practice==== Classical Advaita Ved\u0101nta emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga, a progression of study and training to attain moksha. It consists of fourfold qualities, or behavioral qualifications (Samanyasa, Sampattis, s\u0101dhana- catustaya):Eliot Deutsch (1980), Advaita Vedanta : A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, , pages 105-108 A student is Advaita Ved\u0101nta tradition is required to develop these four qualities - # ' (\u0928\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0924\u094d\u092f \u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0915\u092e\u094d) \u2013 Viveka is the ability to correctly discriminate between the real and eternal (nitya) and the substance that is apparently real, illusory, changing and transitory (anitya). # ' (\u0907\u0939\u093e\u093d\u092e\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u092b\u0932 \u092d\u094b\u0917\u0935\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0917\u092e\u094d) \u2013 The renunciation (vir\u0101ga) of all desires of the mind (bhog) for sense pleasures, in this world (iha) and other worlds. Willing to give up everything that is an obstacle to the pursuit of truth and self- knowledge.George Thibaut, , Oxford University Press, Editor: Max Muller, page 12 with footnote 1 # ' (\u0936\u092e\u093e\u0926\u093f \u0937\u091f\u094d\u0915 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f) \u2013 the sixfold virtues or qualities - ## \u015aama - mental tranquility, ability to focus the mind. ## Dama - self-restraint, the virtue of temperance. restraining the senses. ## Uparati - dispassion, lack of desire for worldly pleasures, ability to be quiet and disassociated from everything; discontinuation of all religious duties and ceremonies ## Titik\u1e63a - endurance, perseverance, putting up with pairs of opposites (like heat and cold, pleasure and pain), ability to be patient during demanding circumstances ## \u015araddh\u0101 - having faith in teacher and the Sruti scriptural texts ## Sam\u0101dh\u0101na - contentedness, satisfaction of mind in all conditions, attention, intentness of mind # ' (\u092e\u0941\u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092e\u094d) \u2013 An intense longing for freedom, liberation and wisdom, driven to the quest of knowledge and understanding. Having moksha as the primary goal of life Correct knowledge, which destroys avidya, psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman, is obtained in jnanayoga through three stages of practice, sravana (hearing), manana (thinking) and nididhyasana (meditation). This three-step methodology is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad: * Sravana, listening to the teachings of the sages on the Upanishads and Advaita Ved\u0101nta, studying the Vedantic texts, such as the Brahma Sutras, and discussions with the guru (teacher, counsellor); * Manana, refers to thinking on these discussions and contemplating over the various ideas based on svadhyaya and sravana. It is the stage of reflection on the teachings; * Nididhy\u0101sana, the stage of meditation and introspection.Oxford Index, nididhy\u0101sana This stage of practice aims at realization and consequent conviction of the truths, non-duality and a state where there is a fusion of thought and action, knowing and being. ====Samadhi==== While Shankara emphasized \u015brava\u1e47a (\"hearing\"), manana (\"reflection\") and nididhy\u0101sana (\"repeated meditation\"), later texts like the D\u1e5bg-D\u1e5b\u015bya-Viveka (14th century) and Ved\u0101ntasara (of Sadananda) (15th century) added sam\u0101dhi as a means to liberation, a theme that was also emphasized by Swami Vivekananda. ====Guru==== Advaita Ved\u0101nta school has traditionally had a high reverence for Guru (teacher), and recommends that a competent Guru be sought in one's pursuit of spirituality. However, the Guru is not mandatory in Advaita school, states Clooney, but reading of Vedic literature and followed by reflection is. Adi Shankara, states Comans, regularly employed compound words \"such as Sastracaryopadesa (instruction by way of the scriptures and the teacher) and Ved\u0101ntacaryopadesa (instruction by way of the Upanishads and the teacher) to emphasize the importance of Guru\". This reflects the Advaita tradition which holds a competent teacher as important and essential to gaining correct knowledge, freeing oneself from false knowledge, and to self- realization. A guru is someone more than a teacher, traditionally a reverential figure to the student, with the guru serving as a \"counselor, who helps mold values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student.Joel Mlecko (1982), The Guru in Hindu Tradition Numen, Volume 29, Fasc. 1, pages 33\u201361 The guru, states Joel Mlecko, is more than someone who teaches specific type of knowledge, and includes in its scope someone who is also a \"counselor, a sort of parent of mind and soul, who helps mold values and experiential knowledge as much as specific knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who reveals the meaning of life.\" ==Ontology== The swan is an important motif in Advaita. The swan symbolises the ability to discern Satya(Real, Eternal) from Mithya(Unreal, Changing), just like the mythical swan Paramahamsa discerns milk from water. ===Absolute Reality=== ====Brahman==== According to Advaita Ved\u0101nta, Brahman is the highest Reality,James Lochtefeld, Brahman, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A\u2013M, Rosen Publishing. , page 122PT Raju (2006), Idealistic Thought of India, Routledge, , page 426 and Conclusion chapter part XII That which is unborn and unchanging, and \"not sublatable\", and cannot be superseded by a still higher reality. Other than Brahman, everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore maya. Brahman is Paramarthika Satyam, \"Absolute Truth\", and In Advaita, Brahman is the substrate and cause of all changes.Jeffrey Brodd (2009), World Religions: A Voyage of Discovery, Saint Mary's Press, , pages 43\u201347 Brahman is considered to be the material cause and the efficient cause of all that exists.Mariasusai Dhavamony (2002), Hindu-Christian Dialogue: Theological Soundings and Perspectives, Rodopi Press, , pages 43\u201344B Martinez- Bedard (2006), Types of Causes in Aristotle and Sankara, Thesis \u2013 Department of Religious Studies (Advisors: Kathryn McClymond and Sandra Dwyer), Georgia State University, pages 18\u201335 Brahman is the \"primordial reality that creates, maintains and withdraws within it the universe.\"Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 243, 325\u2013344, 363, 581 It is the \"creative principle which lies realized in the whole world\".Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 91 Advaita's Upanishadic roots state Brahman's qualities to be Sat-cit-\u0101nanda (being-consciousness-bliss)Eliot Deutsch (1980), Advaita Vedanta : A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, , Chapter 1, page 9 It means \"true being-consciousness-bliss,\"John Arapura (1986), Hermeneutical Essays on Ved\u0101ntic Topics, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 12, 13\u201318Eliot Deutsch (1980), Advaita Vedanta : A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, , pages 9\u201310 with footnote 2 or \"Eternal Bliss Consciousness\". Adi Shankara held that satcitananda is identical with Brahman and Atman. The Advaitin scholar Madhusudana Sarasvati explained Brahman as the Reality that is simultaneously an absence of falsity (sat), absence of ignorance (cit), and absence of sorrow/self-limitation (ananda). According to Adi Shankara, the knowledge of Brahman that Shruti provides cannot be obtained in any other means besides self inquiry.Anantanand Rambachan (1994), The limits of scripture: Vivekananda's reinterpretation of the Vedas. University of Hawaii Press, pages 125, 124 ====\u0100tman==== \u0100tman (IAST: \u0101tman, Sanskrit: \u0906\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d) is a central idea in Hindu philosophy and a foundational premise of Advaita Ved\u0101nta. It is a Sanskrit word that means \"real self\" of the individual,R Dalal (2011), The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths, Penguin, , page 38 \"essence\",Sanskrit Dictionary, Atman and soul.[a] Atman, Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press (2012), Quote: \"1. real self of the individual; 2. a person's soul\"; [b] John Bowker (2000), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Oxford University Press, , See entry for Atman; [c] WJ Johnson (2009), A Dictionary of Hinduism, Oxford University Press, , See entry for Atman (self).[a] David Lorenzen (2004), The Hindu World (Editors: Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby), Routledge, , pages 208\u2013209, Quote: \"Advaita and nirguni movements, on the other hand, stress an interior mysticism in which the devotee seeks to discover the identity of individual soul (atman) with the universal ground of being (brahman) or to find god within himself\".; [b] Richard King (1995), Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism, State University of New York Press, , page 64, Quote: \"Atman as the innermost essence or soul of man, and Brahman as the innermost essence and support of the universe. (...) Thus we can see in the Upanishads, a tendency towards a convergence of microcosm and macrocosm, culminating in the equating of atman with Brahman\". [c] Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, , page 63; Quote: \"Even though Buddhism explicitly rejected the Hindu ideas of Atman (soul) and Brahman, Hinduism treats Sakyamuni Buddha as one of the ten avatars of Vishnu.\" Yet, according to Ram-Prasad, \"it\" is not an object, but \"the irreducible essence of being [as] subjectivity, rather than an objective self with the quality of consciousness.\" It is \"a stable subjectivity, or a unity of consciousness through all the specific states of individuated phenomenality, but not an individual subject of consciousness.\" \u0100tman is the first principle in Advaita Ved\u0101nta, along with its concept of Brahman, with \u0100tman being the perceptible personal particular and Brahman the inferred unlimited universal, both synonymous and interchangeable.Deussen, Paul and Geden, A.

(2010), The Philosophy of the Upanishads, Cosimo Classics, p. 151, ., Quote: \"A fourth metaphor is the monistic equation of the true or absolute self (atman) with absolute being (Brahman). In general, then, the conception of the self that emerges is one in which the self is in some way permanent, eternal, absolute or unchanging. It is also simultaneously universal and individual. The view is that there is an essence and that it can be known.\" It is the \"true self\" of an individual, a consciousness, states Sthaneshwar Timalsina, that is \"self-revealed, self- evident and self-aware (svaprakashata)\".Sthaneshwar Timalsina (2014), Consciousness in Indian Philosophy: The Advaita Doctrine of 'Awareness Only', Routledge, , pages 3\u201323 \u0100tman, states Eliot Deutsch, is the \"pure, undifferentiated, supreme power of awareness\", it is more than thought, it is a state of being, that which is conscious and transcends subject-object divisions and momentariness. Advaita Ved\u0101nta philosophy considers \u0100tman as self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual.A Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, , pages 47, 99\u2013103 It asserts that there is \"spirit, soul, self\" (\u0100tman) within each living entity, which are same as each other and identical to the universal eternal Brahman.Arvind Sharma(2007), Advaita Ved\u0101nta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 9\u201313, 29\u201330, 45\u201347, 79\u201386 It is an experience of \"oneness\" which unifies all beings, in which there is the divine in every being, in which all existence is a single Reality, and in which there is no \"divine\" distinct from the individual \u0100tman.Arvind Sharma(2007), Advaita Ved\u0101nta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 30\u201332 \u0100tman is not the constantly changing body, not the desires, not the emotions, not the ego, nor the dualistic mind in Advaita Ved\u0101nta.Arvind Sharma(2007), Advaita Ved\u0101nta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 44\u201345, 90 It is the introspective, inwardly self-conscious \"on-looker\" (saksi). To Advaitins, human beings, in a state of unawareness and ignorance, see their \"I-ness\" as different than the being in others, then act out of impulse, fears, cravings, malice, division, confusion, anxiety, passions, and a sense of distinctiveness.A Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, , pages 114\u2013122Adi Sankara, A Bouquet of Nondual Texts: Advaita Prakarana Manjari, Translators: Ramamoorthy & Nome, , pages 173-214 ====Identity of \u0100tman and Brahman==== According to Advaita Ved\u0101nta, Atman is identical to Brahman. This is expressed in the mahavakya \"tat tvam asi\", \"thou are that.\" There is \"a common ground, viz. consciousness, to the individual and Brahman.\" Each soul, in Advaita view, is non-different from the infinite. According to Shankara, \u0100tman and Brahman seem different at the empirical level of reality, but this difference is only an illusion, and at the highest level of reality they are really identical. Moksha is attained by realizing the identity of \u0100tman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life. This is frequently stated by Advaita scholars, such as Shankara, as: ===Levels of Reality, Truths=== The classical Advaita Ved\u0101nta explains all reality and everything in the experienced world to be same as the Brahman. To Advaitins, there is a unity in multiplicity, and there is no dual hierarchy of a Creator and the created universe. All objects, all experiences, all matter, all consciousness, all awareness, in Advaita philosophy is not the property but the very nature of this one fundamental reality Brahman. With this premise, the Advaita school states that any ontological effort must presuppose a knowing self, and this effort needs to explain all empirical experiences such as the projected reality while one dreams during sleep, and the observed multiplicity of living beings. This Advaita does by positing its theory of three levels of reality, the theory of two truths, and by developing and integrating these ideas with its theory of errors (anirvacaniya khyati). Shankara proposes three levels of reality, using sublation as the ontological criterion: * ' (paramartha, absolute), the Reality that is metaphysically true and ontologically accurate. It is the state of experiencing that \"which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved\". This reality is the highest, it can't be sublated (assimilated) by any other. * ' (vyavahara), or samvriti-saya, consisting of the empirical or pragmatical reality. It is ever changing over time, thus empirically true at a given time and context but not metaphysically true. It is \"our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake\". It is the level in which both jiva (living creatures or individual souls) and Iswara are true; here, the material world is also true but this is incomplete reality and is sublatable. * ' (pratibhasika, apparent reality, unreality), \"reality based on imagination alone\". It is the level of experience in which the mind constructs its own reality. Well-known examples of pratibhasika is the imaginary reality such as the \"roaring of a lion\" fabricated in dreams during one's sleep, and the perception of a rope in the dark as being a snake. Advaita Ved\u0101nta acknowledges and admits that from the empirical perspective there are numerous distinctions. It states that everything and each reality has multiple perspectives, both absolute and relative. All these are valid and true in their respective contexts, states Advaita, but only from their respective particular perspectives. This \"absolute and relative truths\" explanation, Advaitins call as the \"two truths\" doctrine. John Grimes, a professor of Indian Religions specializing on Ved\u0101nta, explains this Advaita doctrine with the example of light and darkness. From the sun's perspective, it neither rises nor sets, there is no darkness, and \"all is light\". From the perspective of a person on earth, sun does rise and set, there is both light and darkness, not \"all is light\", there are relative shades of light and darkness. Both are valid realities and truths, given their perspectives. Yet, they are contradictory. What is true from one point of view, states Grimes, is not from another. To Advaita Ved\u0101nta, this does not mean there are two truths and two realities, but it only means that the same one Reality and one Truth is explained or experienced from two different perspectives. As they developed these theories, Advaita Ved\u0101nta scholars were influenced by some ideas from the Nyaya, Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy. These theories have not enjoyed universal consensus among Advaitins, and various competing ontological interpretations have flowered within the Advaita tradition., Quote: \"Advaita can be approached from various angles. Not only are there multiple interpretations of Advaita, there are different starting points from which one can arrive at the conclusion of non-duality\". ===Empirical reality \u2013 illusion and ignorance=== According to Advaita Ved\u0101nta, Brahman is the sole reality. The status of the phenomenal world is an important question in Advaita Ved\u0101nta, and different solutions have been proposed. The perception of the phenomenal world as real is explained by maya (constantly changing reality) and avidya (\"ignorance\"). Other than Brahman, everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore maya. Brahman is Paramarthika Satyam, \"Absolute Truth\", and \"the true Self, pure consciousness, the only Reality (sat), since It is untinged by difference, the mark of ignorance, and since It is the one thing that is not sublatable\". ====' (illusion)==== The doctrine of Maya is used to explain the empirical reality in Advaita.S. Radhakrishnan, The Vedanta Philosophy and the Doctrine of Maya, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Jul. 1914), pages 431\u2013451 Jiva, when conditioned by the human mind, is subjected to experiences of a subjective nature, states Ved\u0101nta school, which leads it to misunderstand Maya and interpret it as the sole and final reality. Advaitins assert that the perceived world, including people and other existence, is not what it appears to be\".HM Vroom (1989), Religions and the Truth: Philosophical Reflections and Perspectives, Eerdmans Publishing, , pages 122\u2013123 It is M\u0101y\u0101, they assert, which manifests and perpetuates a sense of false duality or divisional plurality.Frederic F Fost (1998), Playful Illusion: The Making of Worlds in Advaita Ved\u0101nta, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 48, No. 3, pages 388, 397 and note 11 The empirical manifestation is real but changing, but it obfuscates the true nature of metaphysical Reality which is never changing. Advaita school holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of the unchanging Reality and truths \u2013 the Self, that the Self (Soul) in oneself is same as the Self in another and the Self in everything (Brahman).PD Shastri, The Doctrine of Maya Luzac & Co, London, page 58-73 In Advaita Ved\u0101nta philosophy, there are two realities: Vyavaharika (empirical reality) and Paramarthika (absolute, spiritual Reality).Frederic F. Fost (1998), Playful Illusion: The Making of Worlds in Advaita Ved\u0101nta, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul. 1998), pages 387\u2013405 M\u0101y\u0101 is the empirical reality that entangles consciousness. M\u0101y\u0101 has the power to create a bondage to the empirical world, preventing the unveiling of the true, unitary Self\u2014the Cosmic Spirit also known as Brahman. This theory of m\u0101y\u0101 was expounded and explained by Adi Shankara. Competing theistic Dvaita scholars contested Shankara's theory,Surendranath Dasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy. Cambridge University Press Archive, 1955, page 1-2 and stated that Shankara did not offer a theory of the relationship between Brahman and M\u0101y\u0101.Pratima Bowes, \"Mysticism in the Upanishads and Shankara's Vedanta\" in Karel Werner, ed., The Yogi and the Mystic.\" Routledge, 1995, page 67. A later Advaita scholar Prakasatman addressed this, by explaining, \"Maya and Brahman together constitute the entire universe, just like two kinds of interwoven threads create a fabric. Maya is the manifestation of the world, whereas Brahman, which supports Maya, is the cause of the world.\"Esther Abraham Solomon (1969), Avidy\u0101: A Problem of Truth and Reality, , pages 269\u2013270 Brahman is the sole metaphysical truth in Advaita Ved\u0101nta, M\u0101y\u0101 is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, M\u0101y\u0101 is not the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Complete knowledge of true Reality includes knowing both Vyavaharika (empirical) and Paramarthika (spiritual), the M\u0101y\u0101 and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize Brahman, realize the unity and Oneness of all reality., Quote: (p. 30) \u2013 \"As a philosophical and metaphysical term it [monism] refers to the acceptance of one single, ultimate, principle as the basis of the cosmos, the unity and oneness of all reality (...) [monism] has a model par excellence in that put forward by the eighth-century Indian philosopher Shankara, who is associated with the school of thought of Advaita Vedanta. (p. 263) \u2013 \"In Shankara's words: 'the notions oneself and one's own are indeed falsely constructed (upon Atman) through nescience. When there is (the knowledge of) the oneness of Atman, these notions certainly do not exist. If the seed does not exist, whence shall the fruit arise?\". ====Avidya (ignorance)==== Due to ignorance (), Brahman is perceived as the material world and its objects (nama rupa vikara). According to Shankara, Brahman is in reality attributeless and formless. Brahman, the highest truth and all (Reality), does not really change; it is only our ignorance that gives the appearance of change. Also due to , the true identity is forgotten, and material reality, which manifests at various levels, is mistaken as the only and true reality. The notion of avidy\u0101 and its relationship to Brahman creates a crucial philosophical issue within Advaita Ved\u0101nta thought: how can avidy\u0101 appear in Brahman, since Brahman is pure consciousness? Sengaku Mayeda writes, in his commentary and translation of Adi Shankara's Upadesasahasri: To Advaitins, human beings, in a state of unawareness and ignorance of this Universal Self, see their \"I-ness\" as different than the being in others, then act out of impulse, fears, cravings, malice, division, confusion, anxiety, passions, and a sense of distinctiveness.A. Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, , pages 114\u2013122 Subsequent Advaitins gave somewhat various explanations, from which various Advaita schools arose. ====Causality==== All schools of Ved\u0101nta subscribe to the theory of Satk\u0101ryav\u0101da,Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Bhed\u0101bheda Ved\u0101nta which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are different views on the causal relationship and the nature of the empirical world from the perspective of metaphysical Brahman. The Brahma Sutras, the ancient Vedantins, most sub-schools of Ved\u0101nta, as well as Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, support Parinamavada, the idea that the world is a real transformation (parinama) of Brahman. Scholars disagree on the whether Adi Shankara and his Advaita system explained causality through vivarta. According to Andrew Nicholson, instead of parinama-vada, the competing causality theory is Vivartavada, which says \"the world, is merely an unreal manifestation (vivarta) of Brahman. Vivartavada states that although Brahman appears to undergo a transformation, in fact no real change takes place. The myriad of beings are unreal manifestation, as the only real being is Brahman, that ultimate reality which is unborn, unchanging, and entirely without parts\". The advocates of this illusive, unreal transformation based causality theory, states Nicholson, have been the Advaitins, the followers of Shankara. \"Although the world can be described as conventionally real\", adds Nicholson, \"the Advaitins claim that all of Brahman\u2019s effects must ultimately be acknowledged as unreal before the individual self can be liberated\". However, other scholars such as Hajime Nakamura and Paul Hacker disagree. Hacker and others state that Adi Shankara did not advocate Vivartavada, and his explanations are \"remote from any connotation of illusion\". According to these scholars, it was the 13th century scholar Prakasatman who gave a definition to Vivarta, and it is Prakasatman's theory that is sometimes misunderstood as Adi Shankara's position. Andrew Nicholson concurs with Hacker and other scholars, adding that the vivarta-vada isn't Shankara's theory, that Shankara's ideas appear closer to parinama-vada, and the vivarta explanation likely emerged gradually in Advaita subschool later. According to Eliot Deutsch, Advaita Ved\u0101nta states that from \"the standpoint of Brahman-experience and Brahman itself, there is no creation\" in the absolute sense, all empirically observed creation is relative and mere transformation of one state into another, all states are provisional and a cause-effect driven modification. ===Three states of consciousness and Turiya=== Advaita posits three states of consciousness, namely waking (jagrat), dreaming (svapna), deep sleep (su\u1e63upti), which are empirically experienced by human beings,Arvind Sharma (2004), Sleep as a State of Consciousness in Advaita Ved\u00e5nta, State University of New York Press, page 3William Indich (2000), Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 57\u201360 and correspond to the Three Bodies Doctrine: # The first state is the waking state, in which we are aware of our daily world.Arvind Sharma (2004), Sleep as a State of Consciousness in Advaita Ved\u00e5nta, State University of New York Press, pages 15\u201340, 49\u201372 This is the gross body. # The second state is the dreaming mind. This is the subtle body. # The third state is the state of deep sleep. This is the causal body. Advaita also posits the fourth state of Turiya, which some describe as pure consciousness, the background that underlies and transcends these three common states of consciousness. Turiya is the state of liberation, where states Advaita school, one experiences the infinite (ananta) and non-different (advaita/abheda), that is free from the dualistic experience, the state in which ajativada, non- origination, is apprehended. According to Candradhara Sarma, Turiya state is where the foundational Self is realized, it is measureless, neither cause nor effect, all prevading, without suffering, blissful, changeless, self-luminous, real, immanent in all things and transcendent. Those who have experienced the Turiya stage of self-consciousness have reached the pure awareness of their own non-dual Self as one with everyone and everything, for them the knowledge, the knower, the known becomes one, they are the Jivanmukta.; ; Advaita traces the foundation of this ontological theory in more ancient Sanskrit texts.PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University New York Press, , pages 32\u201333 For example, chapters 8.7 through 8.12 of Chandogya Upanishad discuss the \"four states of consciousness\" as awake, dream-filled sleep, deep sleep, and beyond deep sleep.Robert Hume, Chandogya Upanishad \u2013 Eighth Prathapaka, Seventh through Twelfth Khanda, Oxford University Press, pages 268\u2013273 One of the earliest mentions of Turiya, in the Hindu scriptures, occurs in verse 5.14.3 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.; Sanskrit (Wikisource): \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u094b\u093d\u092a\u093e\u0928\u094b \u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928 \u0907\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0905\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930 \u0939 \u0935\u093e \u090f\u0915\u0902 \u0917\u093e\u092f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0948 \u092a\u0926\u092e\u094d \u090f\u0924\u0926\u0941 \u0939\u0948\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e \u090f\u0924\u0924\u094d \u0938 \u092f\u093e\u0935\u0926\u093f\u0926\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0924\u093e\u0935\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u091c\u092f\u0924\u093f \u092f\u094b\u093d\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e \u090f\u0924\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u0926\u0902 \u0935\u0947\u0926 \u0905\u0925\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e \u090f\u0924\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u0924\u0941\u0930\u0940\u092f\u0902 \u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0924\u0902 \u092a\u0926\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u094b\u0930\u091c\u093e \u092f \u090f\u0937 \u0924\u092a\u0924\u093f \u092f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0948 \u091a\u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0930\u0940\u092f\u092e\u094d \u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0924\u0902 \u092a\u0926\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f \u0926\u0926\u0943\u0936 \u0907\u0935 \u0939\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0937 \u092a\u0930\u094b\u0930\u091c\u093e \u0907\u0924\u093f \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u092e\u0941 \u0939\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0935\u0948\u0937 \u0930\u091c \u0909\u092a\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0941\u092a\u0930\u093f \u0924\u092a\u0924\u094d\u092f\u094d \u090f\u0935 \u0939\u0948\u0935 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092f\u0936\u0938\u093e \u0924\u092a\u0924\u093f \u092f\u094b\u093d\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e \u090f\u0924\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u0926\u0902 \u0935\u0947\u0926 \u0965 \u0969 \u0965 The idea is also discussed in other early Upanishads. ==Epistemology== The ancient and medieval texts of Advaita Ved\u0101nta and other schools of Hindu philosophy discuss Pramana (epistemology). The theory of Pramana discusses questions like how correct knowledge can be acquired; how one knows, how one doesn't; and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 25\u201326DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, , page 172 Advaita Ved\u0101nta, accepts the following six kinds of : # Pratyak\u1e63a (\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u092f) \u2013 perception # Anum\u0101\u1e47a (\u0905\u0928\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0928) \u2013 inference # Upam\u0101\u1e47a (\u0909\u092a\u092e\u093e\u0928) \u2013 comparison, analogy # Arth\u0101patti (\u0905\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093e\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f) \u2013 postulation, derivation from circumstances # Anupalabdi (\u0905\u0928\u0941\u092a\u0932\u092c\u094d\u0927\u093f) \u2013 non- perception, negative/cognitive proof # \u015aabda (\u0936\u092c\u094d\u0926) \u2013 relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts ===Pratyak\u1e63a (perception)=== Pratyak\u1e63a (\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u092f), perception, is of two types: external \u2013 that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, and internal \u2013 perception of inner sense, the mind.B Matilal (1992), Perception: An Essay in Indian Theories of Knowledge, Oxford University Press, Advaita postulates four pre-requisites for correct perception: 1) Indriyarthasannikarsa (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), 2) Avyapadesya (non-verbal; correct perception is not through hearsay, according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), 3) Avyabhicara (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and 4) Vyavasayatmaka (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe).Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 160\u2013168 The internal perception concepts included pratibha (intuition), samanyalaksanapratyaksa (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and jnanalaksanapratyaksa (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 168\u2013169 ===Anum\u0101\u1e47a (inference)=== Anum\u0101\u1e47a (\u0905\u0928\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0928), inference, is defined as applying reason to reach a new conclusion about truth from one or more observations and previous understanding of truths.W Halbfass (1991), Tradition and Reflection, State University of New York Press, , page 26-27 Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of Anumana. This epistemological method for gaining knowledge consists of three parts: 1) Pratijna (hypothesis), 2) Hetu (a reason), and 3) drshtanta (examples).James Lochtefeld, \"Anumana\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. , page 46-47 The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts: 1) Sadhya (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and 2) Paksha (the object on which the Sadhya is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if Sapaksha (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if Vipaksha (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies further demand Vyapti \u2013 the requirement that the hetu (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in \"all\" cases, in both sapaksha and vipaksha.Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a nigamana (conclusion).Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom \u2013 Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac & Co, London, page 61 ===Upam\u0101\u1e47a (comparison, analogy)=== Upam\u0101\u1e47a (\u0909\u092a\u092e\u093e\u0928), comparison, analogy.Gavin Flood, An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, , page 225 Some Hindu schools consider it as a proper means of knowledge.VN Jha (1986), \"The upamana-pramana in Purvamimamsa\", SILLE, pages 77\u201391 Upamana, states Lochtefeld, may be explained with the example of a traveler who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later.James Lochtefeld, \"Upamana\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing. , page 721 The subject of comparison is formally called upameyam, the object of comparison is called upamanam, while the attribute(s) are identified as samanya.Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom \u2013 Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac & Co, London, pages 457\u2013458 ===Arth\u0101patti (postulation)=== Arth\u0101patti (\u0905\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093e\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f), postulation, derivation from circumstances. In contemporary logic, this pramana is similar to circumstantial implication.Arthapatti Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2012) As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, and the time is now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this Pramana as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted.James Lochtefeld, \"Arthapatti\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. , page 55 However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable. ===Anupalabdi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof)=== Anupalabdi (\u0905\u0928\u0941\u092a\u0932\u092c\u094d\u0927\u093f), non-perception, negative/cognitive proof. Anupalabdhi pramana suggests that knowing a negative, such as \"there is no jug in this room\" is a form of valid knowledge. If something can be observed or inferred or proven as non-existent or impossible, then one knows more than what one did without such means.James Lochtefeld, \"Abhava\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. , page 1 In Advaita school of Hindu philosophy, a valid conclusion is either sadrupa (positive) or asadrupa (negative) relation \u2013 both correct and valuable. Like other pramana, Indian scholars refined Anupalabdi to four types: non-perception of the cause, non-perception of the effect, non- perception of object, and non-perception of contradiction. Only two schools of Hinduism accepted and developed the concept \"non-perception\" as a pramana. Advaita considers this method as valid and useful when the other five pramanas fail in one's pursuit of knowledge and truth. A variation of Anupaladbi, called Abhava (\u0905\u092d\u093e\u0935) has also been posited as an epistemic method. It means non-existence. Some scholars consider Anupalabdi to be same as Abhava, while others consider Anupalabdi and Abhava as different.D Sharma (1966), Epistemological negative dialectics of Indian logic \u2013 Abh\u0101va versus Anupalabdhi, Indo-Iranian Journal, 9(4): 291\u2013300Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 155\u2013174, 227\u2013255 Abhava-pramana has been discussed in Advaita in the context of Pad\u0101rtha (\u092a\u0926\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925, referent of a term). A Padartha is defined as that which is simultaneously Astitva (existent), Jneyatva (knowable) and Abhidheyatva (nameable). Abhava was further refined in four types, by the schools of Hinduism that accepted it as a useful method of epistemology: dhvamsa (termination of what existed), atyanta-abhava (impossibility, absolute non- existence, contradiction), anyonya-abhava (mutual negation, reciprocal absence) and pragavasa (prior, antecedent non-existence).Chris Bartley (2013), Padartha, in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, , pages 415\u2013416Mohan Lal (Editor), The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, Vol. 5, Sahitya Akademy, , page 3958 ===\u015aabda (relying on testimony)=== \u015aabda (\u0936\u092c\u094d\u0926), relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts.* Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, , pages 245\u2013248; * John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, , page 238 Hiriyanna explains Sabda-pramana as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly.M. Hiriyanna (2000), The Essentials of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 43 He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through Sabda (words). The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the Sabda of reliable sources. The disagreement between Advaita and other schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability.P. Billimoria (1988), \u015aabdapram\u0101\u1e47a: Word and Knowledge, Studies of Classical India Volume 10, Springer, , pages 1\u201330 ==Ethics== Some claim, states Deutsch, \"that Advaita turns its back on all theoretical and practical considerations of morality and, if not unethical, is at least 'a-ethical' in character\". However, adds Deutsch, ethics does have a firm place in this philosophy. Its ideology is permeated with ethics and value questions enter into every metaphysical and epistemological analysis, and it considers \"an independent, separate treatment of ethics are unnecessary\". According to Advaita Ved\u0101nta, states Deutsch, there cannot be \"any absolute moral laws, principles or duties\", instead in its axiological view Atman is \"beyond good and evil\", and all values result from self-knowledge of the reality of \"distinctionless Oneness\" of one's real self, every other being and all manifestations of Brahman. Advaitin ethics includes lack of craving, lack of dual distinctions between one's own soul and another being's, good and just Karma. The values and ethics in Advaita Ved\u0101nta emanate from what it views as inherent in the state of liberating self-knowledge. This state, according to Rambachan, includes and leads to the understanding that \"the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self.\" Such knowledge and understanding of the indivisibility of one's and other's Atman, Advaitins believe leads to \"a deeper identity and affinity with all\". It does not alienate or separate an Advaitin from his or her community, rather awakens \"the truth of life's unity and interrelatedness\". These ideas are exemplified in the Isha Upanishad \u2013 a sruti for Advaita, as follows: Adi Shankara, a leading proponent of Advaita, in verse 1.25 to 1.26 of his Upade\u015bas\u0101hasr\u012b, asserts that the Self-knowledge is understood and realized when one's mind is purified by the observation of Yamas (ethical precepts) such as Ahimsa (non-violence, abstinence from injuring others in body, mind and thoughts), Satya (truth, abstinence from falsehood), Asteya (abstinence from theft), Aparigraha (abstinence from possessiveness and craving) and a simple life of meditation and reflection. Rituals and rites can help focus and prepare the mind for the journey to Self-knowledge, however, Shankara discourages ritual worship and oblations to Deva (God), because that assumes the Self within is different than Brahman. The \"doctrine of difference\" is wrong, asserts Shankara, because, \"he who knows the Brahman is one and he is another, does not know Brahman\".Sanskrit:Upadesha sahasri English Translation: S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, , page 16-17; Elsewhere, in verses 1.26\u20131.28, the Advaita text Upadesasahasri states the ethical premise of equality of all beings. Any Bheda (discrimination), states Shankara, based on class or caste or parentage is a mark of inner error and lack of liberating knowledge.Sanskrit:Upadesha sahasri English Translation: S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, , page 17-19; This text states that the fully liberated person understands and practices the ethics of non-difference. ==Texts== The Upanishads, the Bhagavad Git\u0101 and Brahma Sutras are the central texts of the Advaita Ved\u0101nta tradition, providing doctrines about the identity of Atman and Brahman and their changeless nature. Adi Shankara gave a nondualist interpretation of these texts in his commentaries. Adi Shankara's Bhashya (commentaries) have become central texts in the Advaita Ved\u0101nta philosophy, but are one among many ancient and medieval manuscripts available or accepted in this tradition. The subsequent Advaita tradition has further elaborated on these sruti and commentaries. Adi Shankara is also credited for the famous text Nirvana Shatakam. ===Prasthanatrayi=== The Ved\u0101nta tradition provides exegeses of the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavadgita, collectively called the Prasthanatrayi, literally, three sources. # The Upanishads, or \u015aruti prasth\u0101na; considered the ' (Vedic scriptures) foundation of Ved\u0101nta.Coburn, Thomas B. 1984. pp. 439Klaus Klostermaier (2007), Hinduism: A Beginner's Guide, , Chapter 2, page 26Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, , pages 245\u2013248 Most scholars, states Eliot Deutsch, are convinced that the \u015aruti in general, and the Upanishads in particular, express \"a very rich diversity\" of ideas, with the early Upanishads such as Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and Chandogya Upanishad being more readily amenable to Advaita Ved\u0101nta school's interpretation than the middle or later Upanishads. In addition to the oldest Upanishads, states Williams, the Sannyasa Upanishads group composed in pre-Shankara times \"express a decidedly Advaita outlook\".Stephen Phillips (1998), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 332 note 68 # The Brahma Sutras, or Nyaya prasthana / Yukti prasthana; considered the reason-based foundation of Ved\u0101nta. The Brahma Sutras attempted to synthesize the teachings of the Upanishads. The diversity in the teachings of the Upanishads necessitated the systematization of these teachings. The only extant version of this synthesis is the Brahma Sutras of Badarayana. Like the Upanishads, Brahma Sutras is also an aphoristic text, and can be interpreted as a non-theistic Advaita Ved\u0101nta text or as a theistic Dvaita Ved\u0101nta text. This has led, states Stephen Phillips, to its varying interpretations by scholars of various sub-schools of Ved\u0101nta.Stephen Phillips (1998), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 332 note 69 The Brahmasutra is considered by the Advaita school as the Nyaya Prasthana (canonical base for reasoning). # The Bhagavad Git\u0101, or Smriti prasth\u0101na; considered the Smriti (remembered tradition) foundation of Ved\u0101nta. It has been widely studied by Advaita scholars, including a commentary by Adi Shankara. ===Textual authority=== The identity of Atman and Brahman, and their unchanging, eternal nature, are basic doctrines in Advaita Ved\u0101nta. The school considers the knowledge claims in the Vedas to be the crucial part of the Vedas, not its karma-kanda (ritual injunctions). The knowledge claims about self being identical to the nature of Atman and Brahman are found in the Upanishads, which Advaita Ved\u0101nta has regarded as \"errorless revealed truth.\" Nevertheless, states Koller, Advaita Vedantins did not entirely rely on revelation, but critically examined their teachings using reason and experience, and this led them to investigate and critique competing theories. Advaita Ved\u0101nta, like all orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, accepts as an epistemic premise that \u015aruti (Vedic literature) is a reliable source of knowledge.Coburn, Thomas B. 1984. pp. 439Klaus Klostermaier (2007), Hinduism: A Beginner's Guide, , Chapter 2, page 26Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, , pages 245\u2013248 The \u015aruti includes the four Vedas including its four layers of embedded texts \u2013 the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the early Upanishads.Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1988), Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, Manchester University Press, , pages 2\u20133 Of these, the Upanishads are the most referred to texts in the Advaita school. The possibility of different interpretations of the Vedic literature, states Arvind Sharma, was recognized by ancient Indian scholars.Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Ved\u0101nta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 17\u201319, 22\u201334 The Brahmasutra (also called Ved\u0101nta Sutra, composed in 1st millennium BCE) accepted this in verse 1.1.4 and asserts the need for the Upanishadic teachings to be understood not in piecemeal cherrypicked basis, rather in a unified way wherein the ideas in the Vedic texts are harmonized with other means of knowledge such as perception, inference and remaining pramanas. This theme has been central to the Advaita school, making the Brahmasutra as a common reference and a consolidated textual authority for Advaita. The Bhagavad Git\u0101, similarly in parts can be interpreted to be a monist Advaita text, and in other parts as theistic Dvaita text. It too has been widely studied by Advaita scholars, including a commentary by Adi Shankara. ==History of Advaita Ved\u0101nta== 240px Advaita Ved\u0101nta existed prior to Adi Shankara but found in him its most influential expounder. ===Pre-Shankara Advaita Ved\u0101nta=== Of the Ved\u0101nta-school before the composition of the Brahma Sutras (400\u2013450 CE), wrote Nakamura in 1950, almost nothing is known. The two Advaita writings of pre- Shankara period, known to scholars such as Nakamura in the first half of 20th- century, were the V\u0101kyapad\u012bya, written by Bhart\u1e5bhari (second half 5th century), and the M\u0101nd\u016bkya-k\u0101rik\u0101 written by Gaudapada (7th century CE). Scholarship after 1950 suggests that almost all Sannyasa Upanishads, which belong to the minor Upanishads and are of a later date than the major Upanishads, namely the first centuries CE, and some of which are of a sectarian nature, have a strong Advaita Ved\u0101nta outlook.Stephen H Phillips (1995), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Columbia University Press, , page 332 with note 68Antonio Rigopoulos (1998), Dattatreya: The Immortal Guru, Yogin, and Avatara, State University of New York Press, , pages 62\u201363 The Advaita Ved\u0101nta views in these ancient texts may be, states Patrick Olivelle, because major Hindu monasteries of this period (early medieaval period, starting mid 6th century CE) belonged to the Advaita Ved\u0101nta tradition, preserving only Advaita views, and recasting other texts into Advaita texts. ====Earliest Ved\u0101nta \u2013 Upanishads and Brahma Sutras==== The Upanishads form the basic texts, of which Ved\u0101nta gives an interpretation. The Upanishads do not contain \"a rigorous philosophical inquiry identifying the doctrines and formulating the supporting arguments\". This philosophical inquiry was performed by the darsanas, the various philosophical schools. ====B\u0101dar\u0101yana's Brahma Sutras==== The Brahma Sutras of B\u0101dar\u0101yana, also called the Ved\u0101nta Sutra, were compiled in its present form around 400\u2013450 CE, but \"the great part of the Sutra must have been in existence much earlier than that\". Estimates of the date of B\u0101dar\u0101yana's lifetime differ between 200 BCE and 200 CE. The Brahma Sutra is a critical study of the teachings of the Upanishads, possibly \"written from a Bhed\u0101bheda Ved\u0101ntic viewpoint.\" It was and is a guide-book for the great teachers of the Vedantic systems. B\u0101dar\u0101yana was not the first person to systematise the teachings of the Upanishads. He refers to seven Vedantic teachers before him: ====Between Brahma Sutras and Shankara==== According to Nakamura, \"there must have been an enormous number of other writings turned out in this period, but unfortunately all of them have been scattered or lost and have not come down to us today\". In his commentaries, Shankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his Sampradaya. In the beginning of his commentary on the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad Shankara salutes the teachers of the Brahmavidya Sampradaya.advaita-deanta.org, Advaita Vedanta before Sankaracarya Pre-Shankara doctrines and sayings can be traced in the works of the later schools, which does give insight into the development of early Ved\u0101nta philosophy. The names of various important early Ved\u0101nta thinkers have been listed in the Siddhitraya by Yamun\u0101c\u0101rya (c.1050), the Ved\u0101rthasamgraha by R\u0101m\u0101nuja (c.1050\u20131157), and the Yat\u012bndramatad\u012bpik\u0101 by \u015ar\u012bniv\u0101sa-d\u0101sa. Combined together, at least fourteen thinkers are known to have existed between the composition of the Brahman Sutras and Shankara's lifetime. Although Shankara is often considered to be the founder of the Advaita Ved\u0101nta school, according to Nakamura, comparison of the known teachings of these early Vedantins and Shankara's thought shows that most of the characteristics of Shankara's thought \"were advocated by someone before \u015aankara\". Shankara \"was the person who synthesized the Advaita-v\u0101da which had previously existed before him\". In this synthesis, he was the rejuvenator and defender of ancient learning. He was an unequalled commentator, due to whose efforts and contributions the Advaita Ved\u0101nta assumed a dominant position within Indian philosophy. ===Gaudapada and '=== Gaudapada (6th century) was the teacher of Govinda Bhagavatpada and the grandteacher of Shankara. Gaudapada uses the concepts of Ajativada and Maya to establish \"that from the level of ultimate truth the world is a cosmic illusion,\" and \"suggests that the whole of our waking experience is exactly the same as an illusory and insubstantial dream.\" In contrast, Adi Shankara insists upon a distinction between waking experience and dreams. ====Mandukya Karika==== Gaudapada wrote or compiled the ', also known as the ' or the '. The ' is a commentary in verse form on the Mandukya Upanishad, one of the shortest Upanishads consisting of just 13 prose sentences. Of the ancient literature related to Advaita Ved\u0101nta, the oldest surviving complete text is the M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dukya K\u0101rik\u0101. Many other texts with same type of teachings and which were older than M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dukya K\u0101rik\u0101 existed and this is unquestionable because other scholars and their views are cited by Gaudapada, Shankara and Anandagiri, according to Hajime Nakamura. Gaudapada relied particularly on Mandukya Upanishad, as well as Brihadaranyaka and Chandogya Upanishads. The Mandukya Upanishad was considered to be a \u015aruti before the era of Adi Shankara, but not treated as particularly important. In later post-Shankara period its value became far more important, and regarded as expressing the essence of the Upanishad philosophy. The entire Karika became a key text for the Advaita school in this later era. ====Shri Gaudapadacharya Math==== Around 740 AD Gaudapada founded Shri Gaudapadacharya Math, also known as . It is located in Kavale, Ponda, Goa,Asram Vidya Order, Biographical Notes About Sankara And Gaudapada and is the oldest matha of the South Indian Saraswat Brahmins. ===Adi Shankara=== Adi Shankara (788\u2013820), also known as and , represents a turning point in the development of Ved\u0101nta. After the growing influence of Buddhism on Ved\u0101nta, culminating in the works of Gaudapada, Adi Shankara gave a Vedantic character to the Buddhistic elements in these works, synthesising and rejuvenating the doctrine of Advaita. Using ideas in ancient Indian texts, Shankara systematized the foundation for Advaita Ved\u0101nta in the 8th century CE, reforming Badarayana's Ved\u0101nta tradition. His thematic focus extended beyond metaphysics and soteriology, and he laid a strong emphasis on Pramanas, that is epistemology or \"means to gain knowledge, reasoning methods that empower one to gain reliable knowledge\". Rambachan, for example, summarizes the widely held view on one aspect of Shankara's epistemology before critiquing it as follows, Sengaku Mayeda concurs, adding Shankara maintained the need for objectivity in the process of gaining knowledge (vastutantra), and considered subjective opinions (purushatantra) and injunctions in \u015aruti (codanatantra) as secondary. Mayeda cites Shankara's explicit statements emphasizing epistemology (pramana-janya) in section 1.18.133 of Upadesasahasri and section 1.1.4 of Brahmasutra-bhasya.Karl H Potter (2014), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 3, Princeton University Press, , page 249 Adi Shankara cautioned against cherrypicking a phrase or verse out of context from Vedic literature, and remarked that the Anvaya (theme or purport) of any treatise can only be correctly understood if one attends to the Samanvayat Tatparya Linga, that is six characteristics of the text under consideration: # The common in Upakrama (introductory statement) and Upasamhara (conclusions) # Abhyasa (message repeated) # Apurvata (unique proposition or novelty) # Phala (fruit or result derived) # Arthavada (explained meaning, praised point) # Yukti (verifiable reasoning).George Thibaut (Translator), Brahma Sutras: With Commentary of Shankara, Reprinted as , pages 31\u201333 verse 1.1.4 While this methodology has roots in the theoretical works of Nyaya school of Hinduism, Shankara consolidated and applied it with his unique exegetical method called Anvaya-Vyatireka, which states that for proper understanding one must \"accept only meanings that are compatible with all characteristics\" and \"exclude meanings that are incompatible with any\".Mayeda & Tanizawa (1991), Studies on Indian Philosophy in Japan, 1963\u20131987, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 41, No. 4, pages 529\u2013535Michael Comans (1996), \u015aankara and the Prasankhyanavada, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 24, No. 1, pages 49\u201371 Hacker and Phillips note that this insight into rules of reasoning and hierarchical emphasis on epistemic steps is \"doubtlessly the suggestion\" of Shankara in Brahma-sutra, an insight that flowers in the works of his companion and disciple Padmapada.Stephen Phillips (2000) in Roy W. Perrett (Editor), Epistemology: Indian Philosophy, Volume 1, Routledge, , pages 224\u2013228 with notes 8, 13 and 63 Merrell-Wolff states that Shankara accepts Vedas and Upanishads as a source of knowledge as he develops his philosophical theses, yet he never rests his case on the ancient texts, rather proves each thesis, point by point using pranamas (epistemology), reason and experience.Franklin Merrell-Wolff (1995), Transformations in Consciousness: The Metaphysics and Epistemology, State University of New York Press, , pages 242\u2013260Will Durant (1976), Our Oriental Heritage: The Story of Civilization, Simon & Schuster, , Chapter XIX, Section VI ====Historical context==== Shankara lived in the time of the so-called \"Late classical Hinduism\", which lasted from 650 to 1100CE. This era was one of political instability that followed Gupta dynasty and King Harsha of the 7thcenturyCE.John Koller (2012), Shankara in Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion (Editors: Chad Meister, Paul Copan), Routledge, , pages 99\u2013108 It was a time of social and cultural change as the ideas of Buddhism, Jainism, and various traditions within Hinduism were competing for members.TMP Mahadevan (1968), Shankaracharya, National Book Trust, pages 283\u2013285, Frank Whaling (1979), Sankara and Buddhism, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol.7, No.1, pages 1\u201342 Buddhism in particular influenced India's spiritual traditions in the first 700 years of the 1st millennium CE.Karl Potter (1998), Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Ved\u0101nta up to \u015aa\u1e43kara and his pupils, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 1\u201321, 103\u2013119 Shankara and his contemporaries made a significant contribution in understanding Buddhism and the ancient Vedic traditions; they then transformed the extant ideas, particularly reforming the Ved\u0101nta tradition of Hinduism, making it India's most important tradition for more than a thousand years. ====Writings==== Adi Shankara is best known for his systematic reviews and commentaries (Bhasyas) on ancient Indian texts. Shankara's masterpiece of commentary is the Brahmasutrabhasya (literally, commentary on Brahma Sutra), a fundamental text of the Ved\u0101nta school of Hinduism. His commentaries on ten Mukhya (principal) Upanishads are also considered authentic by scholars.Paul Hacker, Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta (Editor: Wilhelm Halbfass), State University of New York Press, , pages 30\u201331 Other authentic works of Shankara include commentaries on the Bhagavad Git\u0101 (part of his Prasthana Trayi Bhasya).A Rambachan (1991), Accomplishing the Accomplished: Vedas as a Source of Valid Knowledge in Sankara, University of Hawaii Press, , pages xii\u2013xiii Shankara's Vivarana (tertiary notes) on the commentary by Vedavyasa on Yogasutras as well as those on Apastamba Dharma- s\u0169tras (Adhyatama-patala-bhasya) are accepted by scholars as authentic works of Adi Shankara. Among the Stotra (poetic works), the Daksinamurti Stotra, Bhajagovinda Stotra, Sivanandalahari, Carpata-panjarika, Visnu-satpadi, Harimide, Dasa-shloki, and Krishna-staka are likely to be authentic. He also authored Upadesasahasri, his most important original philosophical work.John Koller (2007), in Chad Meister and Paul Copan (Editors): The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion, Routledge, , pages 98\u2013106Wilhelm Halbfass (1990), Tradition and Reflection: Explorations in Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, , pages 205\u2013208 Of other original Prakaranas (\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0930\u0923, monographs, treatise), 76 works are attributed to Adi Shankara. Modern era Indian scholars Belvalkar and Upadhyaya accept five and thirty nine works, respectively, as authentic. Several commentaries on Nrisimha- Purvatatapaniya and Shveshvatara Upanishads have been attributed to Adi Shankara, but their authenticity is highly doubtful. Similarly, commentaries on several early and later Upanishads attributed to Shankara are rejected by scholarsPaul Hacker, 'Sankaracarya and Sankarabhagavatpada: Preliminary Remarks Concerning the Authorship Problem', in Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta (Editor: Wilhelm Halbfass), State University of New York Press, , pp. 41\u201356 as his works, and are likely works of later Advaita Ved\u0101nta scholars; these include the Kaushitaki Upanishad, Maitri Upanishad, Kaivalya Upanishad, Paramahamsa Upanishad, Sakatayana Upanishad, Mandala Brahmana Upanishad, Maha Narayana Upanishad, and Gopalatapaniya Upanishad. The authenticity of Shankara being the author of Adi Shankaracharya, Vivekac\u016b\u1e0d\u0101ma\u1e47i S Madhavananda (Translator), Advaita Ashrama (1921) has been questioned, and \"modern scholars tend to reject its authenticity as a work by Shankara.\"John Grimes (2004), The Vivekacudamani of Sankaracarya Bhagavatpada: An Introduction and Translation, Ashgate, , p.23 The authorship of Shankara of his Mandukya Upanishad Bhasya and his supplementary commentary on Gaudapada's ' has been disputed by Nakamura. However, other scholars state that the commentary on Mandukya, which is actually a commentary on Madukya-Karikas by Gaudapada, may be authentic. ====Influence of Shankara==== Shankara's status in the tradition of Advaita Ved\u0101nta is unparallelled. He travelled all over India to help restore the study of the Vedas.Per Durst-Andersen and Elsebeth F. Lange (2010), Mentality and Thought: North, South, East and West, CBS Press, , page68 His teachings and tradition form the basis of Smartism and have influenced Sant Mat lineages. He introduced the form of worship, the simultaneous worship of five deitiesGanesha, Surya, Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi. Shankara explained that all deities were but different forms of the one Brahman, the invisible Supreme Being.Klaus Klostermaier (2007), A Survey of Hinduism, Third Edition, State University of New York Press, , page40 Benedict Ashley credits Adi Shankara for unifying two seemingly disparate philosophical doctrines in Hinduism, namely Atman and Brahman. Isaeva states that Shankara's influence extended to reforming Hinduism, founding monasteries, edifying disciples, disputing opponents, and engaging in philosophic activity that, in the eyes of Indian tradition, helped revive \"the orthodox idea of the unity of all beings\" and Ved\u0101nta thought. Some scholars doubt Shankara's early influence in India.Paul Hacker, Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta (Editor: Wilhelm Halbfass), State University of New York Press, , pages29\u201330 According to King and Roodurmun, until the 10th century Shankara was overshadowed by his older contemporary Mandana-Misra, who was considered to be the major representative of Advaita. Other scholars state that the historical records for this period are unclear, and little reliable information is known about the various contemporaries and disciples of Shankara.Karl Potter (2008), Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Ved\u0101nta up to \u015aa\u1e43kara and his pupils, Vol3, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages346\u2013347, 420\u2013423, Quote: \"There is little firm historical information about Suresvara; tradition holds Suresvara is same as Mandanamisra.\" Several scholars suggest that the historical fame and cultural influence of Shankara grew centuries later, particularly during the era of the Muslim invasions and consequent devastation of India.R. Blake Michael (1992), The Origins of V\u012bra\u015baiva Sects, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages60\u201362 with notes6, 7 and 8 Many of Shankara's biographies were created and published in and after the 14th century, such as the widely cited Vidyaranya's \u015aankara-vijaya. Vidyaranya, also known as Madhava, who was the 12th Jagadguru of the \u015aringeri \u015aarada P\u012btham from 1380 to 1386,Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). \"M\u0101dhava \u0100ch\u0101rya\". Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. inspired the re-creation of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire of South India in response to the devastation caused by the Islamic Delhi Sultanate.Cynthia Talbot (2001), Precolonial India in Practice: Society, Region, and Identity in Medieval Andhra, Oxford University Press, , pages185\u2013187, 199\u2013201 He and his brothers, suggest Paul Hacker and other scholars, wrote about \u015aankara as well as extensive Advaitic commentaries on the Vedas and Dharma. Vidyaranya was a minister in the Vijayanagara Empire and enjoyed royal support, and his sponsorship and methodical efforts helped establish Shankara as a rallying symbol of values, spread historical and cultural influence of Shankara's Ved\u0101nta philosophies, and establish monasteries (mathas) to expand the cultural influence of Shankara and Advaita Ved\u0101nta. ===Post-Shankara \u2013 early medieval times=== ====Sure\u015bvara and Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra==== Sure\u015bvara (fl. 800\u2013900 CE) and Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra were contemporaries of Shankara, Sure\u015bvara often (incorrectly) being identified with Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra. Both explained Sankara \"on the basis of their personal convictions\". Sure\u015bvara has also been credited as the founder of a pre-Shankara branch of Advaita Ved\u0101nta. Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra was a Mimamsa scholar and a follower of Kumarila, but also wrote a seminal text on Advaita that has survived into the modern era, the Brahma-siddhi. According to tradition, Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra and his wife were defeated by Shankara in a debate, after which he became a follower of Shankara. Yet, his attitude toward Shankara was that of a \"self-confident rival teacher of Advaita\", and his influence was such that some regard the Brahma-siddhi to have \"set forth a non-Shankaran brand of Advaita\"\" The \"theory of error\" set forth in this work became the normative Advaita Ved\u0101nta theory of error. It was Vachaspati Misra's commentary on this work that linked it to Shankara's teaching. His influential thesis in the Advaita tradition has been that errors are opportunities because they \"lead to truth\", and full correct knowledge requires that not only should one understand the truth but also examine and understand errors as well as what is not truth. Hiriyanna and Kuppuswami Sastra have pointed out that Sure\u015bvara and Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra had different views on various doctrinal points: * The locus of avidya: according to Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra, the individual jiva is the locus of avidya, whereas Suresvara contends that the avidya regarding Brahman is located in Brahman. These two different stances are also reflected in the opposing positions of the Bhamati school and the Vivarana school. * Liberation: according to Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra, the knowledge that arises from the Mahavakya is insufficient for liberation. Only the direct realization of Brahma is liberating, which can only be attained by meditation. According to Suresvara, this knowledge is directly liberating, while meditation is at best a useful aid. ====Advaita Ved\u0101nta sub-schools==== After Shankara's death, several sub-schools developed. Two of them still exist today, the Bh\u0101mat\u012b and the Vivarana.THE BHAMATI AND VIVARANA SCHOOLS Two defunct schools are the Pancapadika and Istasiddhi, which were replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school. These schools worked out the logical implications of various Advaita doctrines. Two of the problems they encountered were the further interpretations of the concepts of m\u0101y\u0101 and avidya. =====Padmapada \u2013 Pancapadika school===== Padmapada (c. 800 CE) was a direct disciple of Shankara who wrote the Pancapadika, a commentary on the Sankara-bhaya. Padmapada diverged from Shankara in his description of avidya, designating prakrti as avidya or ajnana. =====Vachaspati Misra \u2013 Bhamati school===== Vachaspati Misra (800\u2013900 CE) wrote the Brahmatattva-samiksa, a commentary on Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra's Brahma-siddhi, which provides the link between Mandana Misra and Shankara and attempts to harmonise Shankara's thought with that of Mandana Misra. According to Advaita tradition, Shankara reincarnated as Vachaspati Misra \"to popularise the Advaita System through his Bhamati\". Only two works are known of Vachaspati Misra, the Brahmatattva-samiksa on Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra's Brahma-siddhi, and his Bhamati on the Sankara-bhasya, Shankara's commentary on the Brahma-sutras. The name of the Bhamati sub-school is derived from this Bhamati.THE BHAMATI AND VIVARANA SCHOOLS The Bhamati school takes an ontological approach. It sees the Jiva as the source of avidya. It sees meditation as the main factor in the acquirement of liberation, while the study of the Vedas and reflection are additional factors. =====Prakasatman \u2013 Vivarana school===== Prakasatman (c. 1200\u20131300) wrote the Pancapadika-Vivarana, a commentary on the Pancapadika by Padmapadacharya. The Vivarana lends its name to the subsequent school. According to Roodurmum, \"[H]is line of thought [...] became the leitmotif of all subsequent developments in the evolution of the Advaita tradition.\" The Vivarana school takes an epistemological approach. Prakasatman was the first to propound the theory of mulavidya or maya as being of \"positive beginningless nature\", and sees Brahman as the source of avidya. Critics object that Brahman is pure consciousness, so it cannot be the source of avidya. Another problem is that contradictory qualities, namely knowledge and ignorance, are attributed to Brahman. =====Vimuktatman \u2013 Ista-Siddhi===== Vimuktatman (c. 1200 CE) wrote the Ista-siddhi. It is one of the four traditional siddhi, together with Mandana's Brahma-siddhi, Suresvara's Naiskarmya-siddhi, and Madusudana's Advaita-siddhi. According to Vimuktatman, absolute Reality is \"pure intuitive consciousness\". His school of thought was eventually replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school. ===Late medieval times (Islamic rule of India) \u2013 \"Greater Advaita Ved\u0101nta\"=== Michael s. Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan note that Shankara is very well-studies, but \"scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Ved\u0101nta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period.\" ====Prominent teachers==== According to Sangeetha Menon, prominent names in the later Advaita tradition are:Sangeetha Menon (2007), Advaita Ved\u0101nta, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy * Prak\u0101s\u0101tman, Vimukt\u0101tman, Sarvaj\u00f1\u0101tman (10th century)(see above) * \u015ar\u012b Har\u1e63a, Citsukha (12th century) * \u0101nandagiri, Amal\u0101nand\u0101 (13th century) * Vidy\u0101ra\u0146ya, \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101nand\u0101 (14th century) * Sad\u0101nand\u0101 (15th century) * Prak\u0101\u1e63\u0101nanda, N\u1e5bsi\u1e41h\u0101\u015brama (16th century) * Madhus\u016bdhana Sarasvati, Dharmar\u0101ja Advarindra, Appaya D\u012bk\u015bita (17th century) ====Influence of yogic tradition==== While Indologists like Paul Hacker and Wilhelm Halbfass took Shankara's system as the measure for an \"orthodox\" Advaita Ved\u0101nta, the living Advaita Ved\u0101nta tradition in medieval times was influenced by, and incorporated elements from, the yogic tradition and texts like the Yoga Vasistha and the Bhagavata Purana. The Yoga Vasistha became an authoritative source text in the Advaita ved\u0101nta tradition in the 14th century, while Vidy\u0101ra\u0146ya's Jivanmuktiviveka (14th century) was influenced by the (Laghu-)Yoga-Vasistha, which in turn was influenced by Kashmir Shaivism. Vivekananda's 19th century emphasis on nirvikalpa samadhi was preceded by medieval yogic influences on Advaita Ved\u0101nta. In the 16th and 17th centuries, some Nath and hatha yoga texts also came within the scope of the developing Advaita Ved\u0101nta tradition. ====Development of central position==== =====Highest Indian philosophy===== Already in medieval times, Advaita Ved\u0101nta came to be regarded as the highest of the Indian religious philosophies, a development which was reinforced in modern times due to western interest in Advaita Ved\u0101nta, and the subsequent influence of western perceptions on Indian perceptions of Hinduism. In contrast, King states that its present position was a response of Hindu intellectuals to centuries of Christian polemic aimed at establishing \"Hindu inferiority complex\" during the colonial rule of the Indian subcontinent. The \"humanistic, inclusivist\" formulation, now called Neo-Ved\u0101nta, attempted to respond to this colonial stereotyping of \"Indian culture was backward, superstitious and inferior to the West\", states King. Advaita Ved\u0101nta was projected as the central philosophy of Hinduism, and Neo-Ved\u0101nta subsumed and incorporated Buddhist ideas thereby making the Buddha a part of the Ved\u0101nta tradition, all in an attempt to reposition the history of Indian culture. Thus, states King, neo- Ved\u0101nta developed as a reaction to western Orientalism and Perennialism. With the efforts of Vivekananda, modern formulation of Advaita Ved\u0101nta has \"become a dominant force in Indian intellectual thought\", though Hindu beliefs and practices are diverse. =====Unifying Hinduism===== Advaita Ved\u0101nta came to occupy a central position in the classification of various Hindu traditions. To some scholars, it is with the arrival of Islamic rule, first in the form of Delhi Sultanate thereafter the Mughal Empire, and the subsequent persecution of Indian religions, Hindu scholars began a self-conscious attempts to define an identity and unity. Between the twelfth and the fourteen century, according to Andrew Nicholson, this effort emerged with a classification of astika and nastika systems of Indian philosophies. Certain thinkers, according to Nicholson thesis, began to retrospectively classify ancient thought into \"six systems\" (saddarsana) of mainstream Hindu philosophy. Other scholars, acknowledges Nicholson, present an alternate thesis. The scriptures such as the Vedas, Upanishads and Bhagavad Git\u0101, texts such as Dharmasutras and Puranas, and various ideas that are considered to be paradigmatic Hinduism are traceable to being thousands of years old. Unlike Christianity and Islam, Hinduism as a religion does not have a single founder, rather it is a fusion of diverse scholarship where a galaxy of thinkers openly challenged each other's teachings and offered their own ideas. The term \"Hindu\" too, states Arvind Sharma, appears in much older texts such as those in Arabic that record the Islamic invasion or regional rule of Indian subcontinent. Some of these texts have been dated to between the 8th and the 11th century.Arvind Sharma (2002), On Hindu, Hindust\u0101n, Hinduism and Hindutva Numen, Vol. 49, Fasc. 1, pages 5\u20139 Within these doxologies and records, Advaita Ved\u0101nta was given the highest position, since it was regarded to be most inclusive system. ===Modern times (colonial rule and independence)=== According to Sangeetha Menon, Sada\u015biva Brahmendra was a prominent 18th century Advaita Vedantin. ====Influence on Hindu nationalism==== According to King, along with the consolidation of the British imperialist rule came orientalism wherein the new rulers viewed Indians through \"colonially crafted lenses\". In response, emerged Hindu nationalism for collective action against the colonial rule, against the caricature by Christian and Muslim communities, and for socio- political independence. In this colonial era search of identity, Ved\u0101nta came to be regarded as the essence of Hinduism, and Advaita Ved\u0101nta came to be regarded as \"then paradigmatic example of the mystical nature of the Hindu religion\" and umbrella of \"inclusivism\". This umbrella of Advaita Ved\u0101nta, according to King, \"provided an opportunity for the construction of a nationalist ideology that could unite Hindus in their struggle against colonial oppression\". Among the colonial era intelligentsia, according to Anshuman Mondal, a professor of Literature specializing in post-colonial studies, the monistic Advaita Ved\u0101nta has been a major ideological force for Hindu nationalism. Mahatma Gandhi professed monism of Advaita Ved\u0101nta, though at times he also spoke with terms from mind-body dualism schools of Hinduism. Other colonial era Indian thinkers, such as Vivekananda, presented Advaita Ved\u0101nta as an inclusive universal religion, a spirituality that in part helped organize a religiously infused identity, and the rise of Hindu nationalism as a counter weight to Islam-infused Muslim communitarian organizations such as the Muslim League, to Christianity-infused colonial orientalism and to religious persecution of those belonging to Indian religions. =====Swami Vivekananda===== A major proponent in the popularisation of this Universalist and Perennialist interpretation of Advaita Ved\u0101nta was Vivekananda, who played a major role in the revival of Hinduism, and the spread of Advaita Ved\u0101nta to the west via the Ramakrishna Mission. His interpretation of Advaita Ved\u0101nta has been called \"Neo-Ved\u0101nta\". Vivekananda discerned a universal religion, regarding all the apparent differences between various traditions as various manifestations of one truth. He presented karma, bhakti, jnana and raja yoga as equal means to attain moksha, to present Ved\u0101nta as a liberal and universal religion, in contrast to the exclusivism of other religions. Vivekananda emphasised nirvikalpa samadhi as the spiritual goal of Ved\u0101nta, he equated it to the liberation in Yoga and encouraged Yoga practice he called Raja yoga. This approach, however, is missing in historic Advaita texts. In 1896, Vivekananda claimed that Advaita appeals to modern scientists: According to Rambachan, Vivekananda interprets anubhava as to mean \"personal experience\", akin to religious experience, whereas Shankara used the term to denote liberating understanding of the sruti. Vivekananda's claims about spirituality as \"science\" and modern, according to David Miller, may be questioned by well informed scientists, but it drew attention for being very different than how Christianity and Islam were being viewed by scientists and sociologists of his era. =====Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan===== Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, first a professor at Oxford University and later a President of India, further popularized Advaita Ved\u0101nta, presenting it as the essence of Hinduism. According to Michael Hawley, a professor of Religious Studies, Radhakrishnan saw other religions, as well as \"what Radhakrishnan understands as lower forms of Hinduism,\" as interpretations of Advaita Ved\u0101nta, thereby \"in a sense Hindusizing all religions\". To him, the world faces a religious problem, where there is unreflective dogmatism and exclusivism, creating a need for \"experiential religion\" and \"inclusivism\". Advaita Ved\u0101nta, claimed Radhakrishnan, best exemplifies a Hindu philosophical, theological, and literary tradition that fulfills this need. Radhakrishnan did not emphasize the differences between Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism versus Hinduism that he defined in terms of Advaita Ved\u0101nta, rather he tended to minimize their differences. This is apparent, for example, in his discussions of Buddhist \"Madhyamika and Yogacara\" traditions versus the Advaita Ved\u0101nta tradition. Radhakrishnan metaphysics was grounded in Advaita Ved\u0101nta, but he reinterpreted Advaita Ved\u0101nta for contemporary needs and context.Michael Hawley, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888\u20141975), Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy He acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the transcendent metaphysical absolute concept (nirguna Brahman). Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted Shankara's notion of maya. According to Radhakrishnan, maya is not a strict absolute idealism, but \"a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real.\"Donald Braue (1984), Maya in Radhakrishnan's Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 101\u2013136 =====Mahatama Gandhi===== Gandhi declared his allegiance to Advaita Ved\u0101nta, and was another popularizing force for its ideas. According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi meant the unity of God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that atman exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of this atman. Gandhi called himself advaitist many times, including his letters, but he believed that others have a right to a viewpoint different than his own because they come from a different background and perspective. According to Gier, Gandhi did not interpret maya as illusion, but accepted that \"personal theism\" leading to \"impersonal monism\" as two tiers of religiosity. ===Contemporary Advaita Ved\u0101nta=== Contemporary teachers are the orthodox Jagadguru of Sringeri Sharada Peetham; the more traditional teachers Sivananda Saraswati (1887\u20131963), Chinmayananda Saraswati (1916-1993),, Dayananda Saraswati (Arsha Vidya) (1930-2015), Swami Paramarthananda, Swami Tattvavidananda Sarasvati, Carol Whitfield (Radha), Sri Vasudevacharya and less traditional teachers such as Narayana Guru.Advaita Vision, teachers According to Sangeetha Menon, prominent names in 20th century Advaita tradition are Shri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswami, Chandrasekharendra Saraswati Swamigal, Sacchid\u0101nandendra Saraswati. ====Influence on New religious movements==== =====Neo-Advaita===== Neo-Advaita is a New Religious Movement based on a popularised, western interpretation of Advaita Ved\u0101nta and the teachings of Ramana Maharshi. Neo-Advaita is being criticised for discarding the traditional prerequisites of knowledge of the scriptures and \"renunciation as necessary preparation for the path of jnana-yoga\". Notable neo-advaita teachers are H. W. L. Poonja, his students Gangaji Andrew Cohen, and Eckhart Tolle. =====Non-dualism===== Advaita Ved\u0101nta has gained attention in western spirituality and New Age, where various traditions are seen as driven by the same non-dual experience. Nonduality points to \"a primordial, natural awareness without subject or object\". It is also used to refer to interconnectedness, \"the sense that all things are interconnected and not separate, while at the same time all things retain their individuality\".Jerry Katz on Nonduality, \"What is Nonduality?\" ==Sampradaya== ===Monastic order: Advaita Mathas=== (Vidyashankara temple) at Sringeri Sharada Peetham, Shringeri Advaita Ved\u0101nta is not just a philosophical system, but also a tradition of renunciation. Philosophy and renunciation are closely related: Shankara organized monks under 10 names and established mathas for them. These mathas contributed to the influence of Shankara, which was \"due to institutional factors\". The mathas which he established remain active today, and preserve the teachings and influence of Shankara, \"while the writings of other scholars before him came to be forgotten with the passage of time\". ===Shri Gaudapadacharya Math=== Around 740 AD Gaudapada founded Shri Gaudapadacharya Math, also known as . It is located in Kavale, Ponda, Goa,Asram Vidya Order, Biographical Notes About Sankara And Gaudapada and is the oldest matha of the South Indian Saraswat Brahmins.Kavale Math Official Website ===Shankara's monastic tradition=== Shankara, himself considered to be an incarnation of Shiva, established the Dashanami Sampradaya, organizing a section of the Ekadandi monks under an umbrella grouping of ten names.Sankara Acarya Biography \u2013 Monastic Tradition Several Hindu monastic and Ekadandi traditions, however, remained outside the organisation of the Dasan\u0101mis.Karigoudar Ishwaran, Ascetic CultureWendy Sinclair-Brull, Female AsceticsH.A. Rose, Ibbetson, Denzil Ibbetson Sir, and Maclagan, Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North West Frontier Province, page 857 Sankara organised the Hindu monks of these ten sects or names under four (Sanskrit: ) (monasteries), called the Amnaya Mathas, with the headquarters at Dv\u0101rak\u0101 in the West, Jagannatha Puri in the East, Sringeri in the South and Badrikashrama in the North. Each math was first headed by one of his four main disciples, and the tradition continues since then. According to another tradition in Kerala, after Sankara's samadhi at Vadakkunnathan Temple, his disciples founded four mathas in Thrissur, namely Naduvil Madhom, Thekke Madhom, Idayil Madhom and Vadakke Madhom. The table below gives an overview of the four Amnaya Mathas founded by Adi Shankara, and their details. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Shishya (lineage) !Direction ! ! !Veda ! |- | !East | | |Rig Veda |Bhogavala |- | !South | | |Yajur Veda | |- | !West | | |Sama Veda |Kitavala |- | !North | | |Atharva Veda |Nandavala |} Monks of these ten orders differ in part in their beliefs and practices, and a section of them is not considered to be restricted to specific changes made by Shankara. While the dasan\u0101mis associated with the Sankara maths follow the procedures enumerated by Adi \u015aankara, some of these orders remained partly or fully independent in their belief and practices; and outside the official control of the Sankara maths. The advaita sampradaya is not a Saiva sect, despite the historical links with Shaivism. Nevertheless, contemporary Sankaracaryas have more influence among Saiva communities than among Vaisnava communities. ==Relationship with other forms of Ved\u0101nta== The Advaita Ved\u0101nta ideas, particularly of 8th century Adi Shankara, were challenged by theistic Ved\u0101nta philosophies that emerged centuries later, such as the 11th-century Vishishtadvaita (qualified nondualism) of Ramanuja, and the 14th-century Dvaita (theistic dualism) of Madhvacharya. ===Vishishtadvaita=== Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita school and Shankara's Advaita school are both nondualism Ved\u0101nta schools,J.A.B. van Buitenen (2008), Ramanuja \u2013 Hindu theologian and Philosopher, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica both are premised on the assumption that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya and his Dvaita subschool of Ved\u0101nta believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned. Shankara's theory posits that only Brahman and causes are metaphysical unchanging reality, while the empirical world (Maya) and observed effects are changing, illusive and of relative existence. Spiritual liberation to Shankara is the full comprehension and realization of oneness of one's unchanging Atman (soul) as the same as Atman in everyone else as well as being identical to the nirguna Brahman. In contrast, Ramanuja's theory posits both Brahman and the world of matter are two different absolutes, both metaphysically real, neither should be called false or illusive, and saguna Brahman with attributes is also real. God, like man, states Ramanuja, has both soul and body, and all of the world of matter is the glory of God's body. The path to Brahman (Vishnu), asserted Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of personal god (saguna Brahman, Vishnu), one which ultimately leads one to the oneness with nirguna Brahman. ===Shuddhadvaita=== Vallabhacharya (1479\u20131531 CE), the proponent of the philosophy of Shuddhadvaita Brahmvad enunciates that Ishvara has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Maya (which itself is his power) and manifests Himself through the world.Devarshi Ramanath Shastri, \"Shuddhadvaita Darshan (Vol.2)\", Published by Mota Mandir, Bhoiwada, Mumbai, India, 1917. That is why shuddhadvaita is known as 'Unmodified transformation' or 'Avik\u1e5bta Pari\u1e47\u0101mav\u0101da'. Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual souls and the world. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a 'part' (but devoid of bliss).\"Brahmav\u0101d Sa\u1e45graha\", Pub. Vaishnava Mitra Mandal Sarvajanik Nyasa, Indore, India, 2014. ===Dvaita=== Madhvacharya was also a critic of Advaita Ved\u0101nta. Advaita's nondualism asserted that Atman (soul) and Brahman are identical, there is interconnected oneness of all souls and Brahman, and there are no pluralities. Madhva in contrast asserted that Atman (soul) and Brahman are different, only Vishnu is the Lord (Brahman), individual souls are also different and depend on Vishnu, and there are pluralities.Stafford Betty (2010), Dvaita, Advaita, and Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita: Contrasting Views of Mok\u1e63a, Asian Philosophy: An International Journal of the Philosophical Traditions of the East, Volume 20, Issue 2, pages 215\u2013224 Madhvacharya stated that both Advaita Ved\u0101nta and Mahayana Buddhism were a nihilistic school of thought. Madhvacharya wrote four major texts, including Upadhikhandana and Tattvadyota, primarily dedicated to criticizing Advaita.SMS Chari (1999), Advaita and Visistadvaita, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 5\u20137 Present-day Krishna-devotees are highly critical of Advaita Ved\u0101nta, regarding it as m\u0101y\u0101v\u0101da, identical to Mahayana Buddhism.Gaura Gopala Dasa, The Self-Defeating Philosophy of MayavadaMayavada Philosophy ==Historical influence== Mahatma Gandhi stated \"I am an advaitist\". Scholars are divided on the historical influence of Advaita Ved\u0101nta. Some Indologists state that it is one of the most studied Hindu philosophy and the most influential schools of classical Indian thought. Advaita Ved\u0101nta, states Eliot Deutsch, \"has been and continues to be the most widely accepted system of thought among philosophers in India, and it is, we believe, one of the greatest philosophical achievements to be found in the East or the West\".Eliot Deutsch (1996), Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, , page 3 ===Smarta Tradition=== The Smarta tradition of Hinduism is an ancient tradition, particularly found in south and west India, that revers all Hindu divinities as a step in their spiritual pursuit. Their worship practice is called Panchayatana puja. The worship symbolically consists of five deities: Shiva, Vishnu, Devi or Durga, Surya and an Ishta Devata or any personal god of devotee's preference. In the Smarta tradition, Advaita Ved\u0101nta ideas combined with bhakti are its foundation. Adi Shankara is regarded as the greatest teacher and reformer of the Smarta. According to Alf Hiltebeitel, Shankara's Advaita Ved\u0101nta and practices became the doctrinal unifier of previously conflicting practices with the smarta tradition. Philosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasizes that all images and statues (murti), or just five marks or any anicons on the ground, are visibly convenient icons of spirituality saguna Brahman. The multiple icons are seen as multiple representations of the same idea, rather than as distinct beings. These serve as a step and means to realizing the abstract Ultimate Reality called nirguna Brahman. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, then follow a philosophical and meditative path to understanding the oneness of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman \u2013 as \"That art Thou\".The Four Denominations of Hinduism, Basics of Hinduism, Kauai Hindu MonasteryFalk Reitz (1997), Pancayatana-Komplexe in Nordindien: Entstehung, Entwicklung und regionale Besonderheiten einer indischen Architekturform, PhD Thesis (in German), Awarded by Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin ===Other Hindu traditions=== Within the ancient and medieval texts of Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism, the ideas of Advaita Ved\u0101nta have had a major influence. Advaita Ved\u0101nta influenced Krishna Vaishnavism in the different parts of India. One of its most popular text, the Bhagavata Purana, adopts and integrates in Advaita Ved\u0101nta philosophy. The Bhagavata Purana is generally accepted by scholars to have been composed in the second half of 1st millennium CE. In the ancient and medieval literature of Shaivism, called the \u0100gamas, the influence of Advaita Ved\u0101nta is once again prominent. Of the 92 \u0100gamas, ten are Dvaita texts, eighteen are Bhedabheda, and sixty-four are Advaita texts. According to Natalia Isaeva, there is an evident and natural link between 6th-century Gaudapada's Advaita Ved\u0101nta ideas and Kashmir Shaivism. Shaktism, the Hindu tradition where a goddess is considered identical to Brahman, has similarly flowered from a syncretism of the monist premises of Advaita Ved\u0101nta and dualism premises of Samkhya\u2013Yoga school of Hindu philosophy, sometimes referred to as Shaktadavaitavada (literally, the path of nondualistic Shakti). Other influential ancient and medieval classical texts of Hinduism such as the Yoga Yajnavalkya, Yoga Vashishta, Avadhuta Git\u0101, Markandeya Purana and Sannyasa Upanishads predominantly incorporate premises and ideas of Advaita Ved\u0101nta.; Richard Rosen (2001), Review of Yogayajnavalkya Samhita by TKV Desikachar, , Issue March/April, page 149; ; ==Relationship with Buddhism== Advaita Ved\u0101nta and Mahayana Buddhism share similarities and have differences, their relationship a subject of dispute among scholars. The similarities between Advaita and Buddhism have attracted Indian and Western scholars attention, and have also been criticised by concurring schools. The similarities have been interpreted as Buddhist influences on Advaita Ved\u0101nta, while others deny such influences, or see them as variant expressions.N.V. Isaeva (1993), Shankara and Indian Philosophy, SUNY Press, pages 12\u201314, 145\u2013154 According to Daniel Ingalls, the Japanese Buddhist scholarship has argued that Adi Shankara did not understand Buddhism. Some Hindu scholars criticized Advaita for its Maya and non-theistic doctrinal similarities with Buddhism.Julius Lipner (1986), The Face of Truth: A Study of Meaning and Metaphysics in the Vedantic Theology of R\u0101m\u0101nuja, State University of New York Press, , pages 120\u2013123 Ramanuja, the founder of Vishishtadvaita Ved\u0101nta, accused Adi Shankara of being a Prachanna Bauddha, that is, a \"crypto-Buddhist\", and someone who was undermining theistic Bhakti devotionalism. The non-Advaita scholar Bhaskara of the Bhedabheda Ved\u0101nta tradition, similarly around 800 CE, accused Shankara's Advaita as \"this despicable broken down Mayavada that has been chanted by the Mahayana Buddhists\", and a school that is undermining the ritual duties set in Vedic orthodoxy. A few Buddhist scholars made the opposite criticism in the medieval era toward their Buddhist opponents. In the sixth century CE, for example, the Mahayana Buddhist scholar Bhaviveka redefined Vedantic concepts to show how they fit into Madhyamaka concepts, and \"equate[d] the Buddha's Dharma body with Brahman, the ultimate reality of the Upanishads.\" In his Madhyamakah\u1e5bdayak\u0101rika\u1e25, Bhaviveka stages a Hinayana (Theravada) interlocutor, who accuses Mahayana Buddhists of being \"crypto-Vedantins\". Medieval era Tibetan Gelugpa scholars accused the Jonang school of being \"crypto- Vedantist.\" Contemporary scholar David Kalupahana called the seventh century Buddhist scholar Chandrakirti a \"crypto-Vedantist\", a view rejected by scholars of Madhayamika Buddhism., Quote: \"He also charges that Candrakirti was a crypto-Vedantist, (...)\" The Advaita Ved\u0101nta tradition has historically rejected accusations of crypto-Buddhism highlighting their respective views on Atman, Anatta and Brahman. ===Similarities with Buddhism=== According to scholars, the influence of Mahayana Buddhism on Advaita Ved\u0101nta has been significant. Advaita Ved\u0101nta and various other schools of Hindu philosophy share numerous terminology, doctrines and dialectical techniques with Buddhism. According to a 1918 paper by the Buddhism scholar O. Rozenberg, \"a precise differentiation between Brahmanism and Buddhism is impossible to draw.\" Both traditions hold that \"the empirical world is transitory, a show of appearances\",Helmuth Von Glasenapp (1995), Vedanta & Buddhism: A comparative study, Buddhist Publication Society, pages 2\u20133 and both admit \"degrees of truth or existence\". Both traditions emphasize the human need for spiritual liberation (moksha, nirvana, kaivalya), however with different assumptions.David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 22, Issue 1, pages 65\u201374 Adi Shankara, states Natalia Isaeva, incorporated \"into his own system a Buddhist notion of maya which had not been minutely elaborated in the Upanishads\". Similarly, there are many points of contact between Buddhism's Vijnanavada and Shankara's Advaita. According to Frank Whaling, the similarities between Advaita Ved\u0101nta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, but also includes practice. The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita are similar to those found in Buddhism. Dasgupta and Mohanta suggest that Buddhism and Shankara's Advaita Ved\u0101nta represent \"different phases of development of the same non-dualistic metaphysics from the Upanishadic period to the time of Sankara.\" The influence of Mahayana Buddhism on other religions and philosophies was not limited to Ved\u0101nta. Kalupahana notes that the Visuddhimagga of Theravada Buddhism tradition contains \"some metaphysical speculations, such as those of the Sarvastivadins, the Sautrantikas, and even the Yogacarins\". According to John Plott, ===Gaudapada=== The influence of Buddhist doctrines on Gaudapada has been a vexed question. One school of scholars, such as Bhattacharya and Raju, state that Gaudapada took over the Buddhist doctrines that ultimate reality is pure consciousness (vij\u00f1apti-m\u0101tra) and \"that the nature of the world is the four- cornered negation, which is the structure of M\u0101y\u0101\". Of particular interest is Chapter Four of Gaudapada's text Karika, in which according to Bhattacharya, two karikas refer to the Buddha and the term Asparsayoga is borrowed from Buddhism. According to Murti, \"the conclusion is irresistible that Gaudapada, a Ved\u0101nta philosopher, is attempting an Advaitic interpretation of Ved\u0101nta in the light of the Madhyamika and Yogacara doctrines. He even freely quotes and appeals to them.\"TRV Murti (1955), The central philosophy of Buddhism, Routledge (2008 Reprint), , pages 114\u2013115 However, adds Murti, the doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Chapter One, Two and Three are entirely Vedantin and founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor. Further, state both Murti and King, no Ved\u0101nta scholars who followed Gaudapada ever quoted from Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three.Gaudapada, Devanathan Jagannathan, University of Toronto, IEP According to Sarma, \"to mistake him [Gaudapada] to be a hidden or open Buddhist is absurd\". The doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are totally opposed, states Murti: Advaitins have traditionally challenged the Buddhist influence thesis. Modern scholarship generally accepts that Gaudapada was influenced by Buddhism, at least in terms of using Buddhist terminology to explain his ideas, but adds that Gaudapada was a Vedantin and not a Buddhist. Gaudapada adopted some Buddhist terminology and borrowed its doctrines to his Vedantic goals, much like early Buddhism adopted Upanishadic terminology and borrowed its doctrines to Buddhist goals; both used pre-existing concepts and ideas to convey new meanings. While there is shared terminology, the Advaita doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different. ===Differences from Buddhism=== ====Atman and anatta==== Advaita Ved\u0101nta holds the premise, \"Soul exists, and Soul (or self, Atman) is a self evident truth\". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, \"Atman does not exist, and An-atman (or Anatta, non-self)Anatta, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2013), Quote: \"Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman (\"the self\").\" is self evident\".John C. Plott et al. (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 63, Quote: \"The Buddhist schools reject any \u0100tman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism\".Dae-Sook Suh (1994), Korean Studies: New Pacific Currents, University of Hawaii Press, , page 171 Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad gives a more nuanced view, stating that the Advaitins \"assert a stable subjectivity, or a unity of consciousness through all the specific states of indivuated consciousness, but not an individual subject of consciousness [...] the Advaitins split immanent reflexivity from 'mineness'.\"Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad (2013), Situating the Elusive Self of Advaita Vedanta. In: Mark Siderits, Evan Thompson, Dan Zahavi (eds.), Self, No Self?: Perspectives from Analytical, Phenomenological, and Indian Traditions, Oxgord University Press, p.235 In Buddhism, Anatta (Pali, Sanskrit cognate An- atman) is the concept that in human beings and living creatures, there is no \"eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman\".[a] Anatta, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2013), Quote: \"Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman (\"the self\").\"; [b] Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, , page 64; Quote: \"Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anatt\u0101, Sanskrit: an\u0101tman, the opposed doctrine of \u0101tman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.\"; [c] Edward Roer (Translator), to Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad, pages 2\u20134; [d] Katie Javanaud (2013), Is The Buddhist \u2018No-Self\u2019 Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?, Philosophy Now; [e] David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 23, Issue 1, pages 65\u201374; [f] KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, , pages 246\u2013249, from note 385 onwards; [g] Bruno Nagel (2000), Roy Perrett (editor), Philosophy of Religion: Indian Philosophy, Routledge, , page 33, Quote: \"The dispute with Buddhists, who do not accept an imperishable Self, gives the Atman schools [Vedanta, Kashmir Shaivism] a chance to articulate the intellectual aspects of their way to meditative liberation\". Buddhist philosophy rejects the concept and all doctrines associated with atman, call atman as illusion (maya), asserting instead the theory of \"no-self\" and \"no-soul.\"Helen J Baroni (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism, Rosen Publishing, , page 14 Most schools of Buddhism, from its earliest days, have denied the existence of the \"self, soul\" in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In contrast to Advaita, which describes knowing one's own soul as identical with Brahman as the path to nirvana, in its soteriological themes Buddhism has defined nirvana as the state of a person who knows that he or she has \"no self, no soul\".David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 23, Issue 1, pages 65\u201374 The Upanishadic inquiry fails to find an empirical correlate of the assumed Atman, but nevertheless assumes its existence, and Advaitins \"reify consciousness as an eternal self.\" In contrast, the Buddhist inquiry \"is satisfied with the empirical investigation which shows that no such Atman exists because there is no evidence.\" states Jayatilleke. Yet, some Buddhist texts chronologically placed in the 1st millennium of common era, such as the Mahayana tradition's Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras suggest self-like concepts, variously called Tathagatagarbha or Buddha nature. These have been controversial idea in Buddhism, and \"eternal self\" concepts have been generally rejected. In modern era studies, scholars such as Wayman and Wayman state that these \"self-like\" concepts are neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality. Some scholars posit that the Tathagatagarbha Sutras were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists. Quote: \"(...) it refers to the Buddha using the term \"Self\" in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics.\" ====Epistemology==== The epistemological foundations of Buddhism and Advaita Ved\u0101nta are different. Buddhism accepts two valid means to reliable and correct knowledge \u2013 perception and inference, while Advaita Ved\u0101nta accepts six (described elsewhere in this article).John Clayton (2010), Religions, Reasons and Gods: Essays in Cross-cultural Philosophy of Religion, Cambridge University Press, , page 54 However, some Buddhists in history, have argued that Buddhist scriptures are a reliable source of spiritual knowledge, corresponding to Advaita's \u015aabda pramana, however Buddhists have treated their scriptures as a form of inference method.Alex Wayman (1999), A Millennium of Buddhist Logic, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page xix\u2013xx ====Ontology==== Advaita Ved\u0101nta posits a substance ontology, an ontology which holds that underlying the change and impermanence of empirical reality is an unchanging and permanent absolute reality, like an eternal substance it calls Atman- Brahman. In its substance ontology, as like other philosophies, there exist a universal, particulars and specific properties and it is the interaction of particulars that create events and processes. In contrast, Buddhism posits a process ontology, also called as \"event ontology\". According to the Buddhist thought, particularly after the rise of ancient Mahayana Buddhism scholarship, there is neither empirical nor absolute permanent reality and ontology can be explained as a process. There is a system of relations and interdependent phenomena (pratitya samutpada) in Buddhist ontology, but no stable persistent identities, no eternal universals nor particulars. Thought and memories are mental constructions and fluid processes without a real observer, personal agency or cognizer in Buddhism. In contrast, in Advaita Ved\u0101nta, like other schools of Hinduism, the concept of self (atman) is the real on-looker, personal agent and cognizer. The Pali Abdhidhamma and Theravada Buddhism considered all existence as dhamma, and left the ontological questions about reality and the nature of dhamma unexplained. According to Renard, Advaita's theory of three levels of reality is built on the two levels of reality found in the Madhyamika. ====Shankara on Buddhism==== A central concern for Shankara, in his objections against Buddhism, is what he perceives as nihilism of the Buddhists. Shankara states that there \"must be something beyond cognition, namely a cognizer,\" which he asserts is the self-evident Atman or witness. Buddhism, according to Shankara, denies the cognizer. He also considers the notion of Brahman as pure knowledge and \"the quintessence of positive reality.\" The teachings in Brahma Sutras, states Shankara, differ from both the Buddhist realists and the Buddhist idealists. Shankara elaborates on these arguments against various schools of Buddhism, partly presenting refutations which were already standard in his time, and partly offering his own objections. Shankara's original contribution in explaining the difference between Advaita and Buddhism was his \"argument for identity\" and the \"argument for the witness\". In Shankara's view, the Buddhist are internally inconsistent in their theories, because \"the reservoir- consciousness that [they] set up, being momentary, is no better than ordinary consciousness. Or, if [they] allow the reservoir-consciousness to be lasting, [they] destroy [their] theory of momentariness.\" In response to the idealists, he notes that their alaya-vijnana, or store-house consciousness, runs counter to the Buddhist theory of momentariness. With regard to the Sunyavada (Madhyamaka), Shankara states that \"being contradictory to all valid means of knowledge, we have not thought worth while to refute\" and \"common sense (loka- vyavahara) cannot be denied without the discovery of some other truth\". ==Reception== Advaita Ved\u0101nta is most often regarded as an idealist monism. According to King, Advaita Ved\u0101nta developed \"to its ultimate extreme\" the monistic ideas already present in the Upanishads. In contrast, states Milne, it is misleading to call Advaita Ved\u0101nta \"monistic,\" since this confuses the \"negation of difference\" with \"conflation into one.\" Advaita is a negative term (a-dvaita), states Milne, which denotes the \"negation of a difference,\" between subject and object, or between perceiver and perceived. According to Deutsch, Advaita Ved\u0101nta teaches monistic oneness, however without the multiplicity premise of alternate monism theories. According to Jacqueline Hirst, Adi Shankara positively emphasizes \"oneness\" premise in his Brahma- sutra Bhasya 2.1.20, attributing it to all the Upanishads.Jacqueline Hirst (2005), Samkara's Advaita Vedanta: A Way of Teaching, Routledge, , page 79 Nicholson states Advaita Ved\u0101nta contains realistic strands of thought, both in its oldest origins and in Shankara's writings. ==See also== * Cause and effect in Advaita Ved\u0101nta * Kashmir Shaivism * Pandeism * Pantheism ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== ===Printed sources=== ===Web-sources=== ==Further reading== ;Primary texts * Robert Hume, Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press * Shankara, \"A thousand teachings: the Upade\u015bas\u0101hasr\u012b of \u015aa\u1e45kara\", Translator Sengaku Mayeda * Shankara, Brahma Sutras with Shankara's commentary, translator George Thibaut * Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra, translated by Allen W.
