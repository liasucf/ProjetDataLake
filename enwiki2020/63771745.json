    "text": "Duplornaviricota is a phylum of RNA viruses, which contains all double- stranded RNA viruses, except for those in phylum Pisuviricota. Characteristic of the group is a viral capsid composed of 60 homo- or heterodimers of capsid protein on a pseudo-T=2 lattice. Duplornaviruses infect both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The name of the group derives from Italian duplo which means double (a reference to double-stranded), rna for the type of virus, and -viricota which is the suffix for a virus phylum. ==Classes== Phylogenetic tree of Duplornaviricota (top), genome of different members and major conserved proteins (bottom) The following classes are recognized: * Chrymotiviricetes * Resentoviricetes * Vidaverviricetes ==References== Category:Viruses ",
