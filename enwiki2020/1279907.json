In 1976, AGL converted from town gas to natural gas following the opening of the Moomba to Sydney Pipeline. In the later part of the 20th century, the company diversified into electricity generation, buying a stake in the Loy Yang Power Station and ownership of the Kiewa Hydroelectric Scheme, the Wattle Point Wind Farm, and a peak load gas- powered power station near Hallett in South Australia. The company also had significant ownership of gas pipelines plus electricity and gas distribution networks in Australia.
