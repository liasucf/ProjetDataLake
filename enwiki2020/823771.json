If only she could work out which fairytale it was, it would somehow help her.\" Will it be The Red Shoes, whose heroine is danced to death, punished by her worldly thoughts, or Mr Fox, whose wife is enjoined to \"Be bold, be bold, but not too bold\"? Or maybe it's a modern tale, such as Rebecca, with its saturnine hero obsessed with a dead wife and a ghastly secret.\" \"THERE is a distinctive ambience to an Alice Thompson novel. From Justine, her debut which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, through Pandora's Box, Pharos, The Falconer, The Existential Detective and Burnt Island, there is a kind of gothic postmodernism.\" \"A genuinely eerie tale, in a perfect setting and told with just the right amount of ambiguity.\" \"Some books evoke a particular piece of music, others, a particular color. The Falconer (2008) by Alice Thompson reminded me of a painting in Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery, which fascinated me as a child. The Fairy Raid (1867) by Scottish pre-Raphaelite Noel Paton depicts a fairy caravan traveling through a grove with a bounty of stolen children, having left changelings in their stead. It's an enchanting, overtly romantic work, but death and duplicity hide in the shadows, symbolizing the Victorian fear of high childhood mortality.\" ==References== ==External links== * The Act of Writing, article by Alice Thompson Category:People educated at St George's School, Edinburgh Category:20th-century British novelists Category:21st-century British novelists Category:20th-century British women writers Category:21st- century British women writers Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:James Tait Black Memorial Prize recipients Category:Writers from Edinburgh Category:Scottish keyboardists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Writers of Gothic fiction ",
