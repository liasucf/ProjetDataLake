    "text": "Anti-Slavism, also known as Slavophobia, a form of xenophobia, refers to various negative attitudes towards Slavic peoples, the most common manifestation is the claim that the inhabitants of Slavic nations are inferior to other ethnic groups, most notably made by Germanic peoples, Italians, Albanians and Greeks. Slavophilia, by contrast, is a sentiment that celebrates Slavonic cultures or peoples and it has sometimes included a supremacist or nationalist tone. Anti-Slavism reached its highest peak during World War II, when Nazi Germany declared Slavs, especially neighboring Poles and Russians to be subhuman and planned to exterminate the majority of Slavic people. == 20th century == === Albania === At the beginning of the 20th century, anti-Slavism developed in Albania by the work of the Franciscan friars who had studied in monasteries in Austria-Hungary, after the recent massacres and expulsions of Albanians by their Slavic neighbours. The Albanian intelligentsia proudly asserted, \"We Albanians are the original and autochthonous race of the Balkans. The Slavs are conquerors and immigrants who came but yesterday from Asia\". In Soviet historiography, anti-Slavism in Albania was inspired by the Catholic clergy, which opposed the Slavic people because of the role the Catholic clergy played in preparations \"for Italian aggression against Albania\" and Slavs opposed \"rapacious plans of Austro-Hungarian imperialism in Albania\". An emaciated male inmate suffering from severe malnutrition at the Italian Rab concentration camp on the island of Rab in what is now Croatia. This camp largely detained Slavs. === Fascism and Nazism === Anti-Slavism was a notable component of Italian Fascism and Nazism both prior to and during World War II. In the 1920s, Italian fascists targeted Yugoslavs, especially Serbs. They accused Serbs of having \"atavistic impulses\" and they also claimed that the Yugoslavs were conspiring together on behalf of \"Grand Orient masonry and its funds\". One anti-Semitic claim was that Serbs were part of a \"social- democratic, masonic Jewish internationalist plot\".Burgwyn, H. James (1997) Italian Foreign Policy in the Interwar Period, 1918-1940. Greenwood Publishing Group. p.43. Benito Mussolini viewed the Slavic race as inferior and barbaric. He identified the Yugoslavs (Croats) as a threat to Italy and he viewed them as competitors over the region of Dalmatia, which was claimed by Italy, and he claimed that the threat rallied Italians together at the end of World War I: \"The danger of seeing the Jugo-Slavians settle along the whole Adriatic shore had caused a bringing together in Rome of the cream of our unhappy regions. Students, professors, workmen, citizens\u2014representative men\u2014were entreating the ministers and the professional politicians\".Mussolini, Benito; Child, Richard Washburn; Ascoli, Max; & Lamb, Richard (1988) My rise and fall. New York: Da Capo Press. pp.105-106. These claims often tended to emphasize the \"foreignness\" of the Yugoslavs as newcomers to the area, unlike the ancient Italians, whose territories the Slavs occupied. ===Canada=== In Canada, many xenophobic white supremacists were deeply tied to their nation's \"Anglo-Saxon\" culture, specifically from the early 1900s to the end of World War II. The Ku Klux Klan in Canada was prominent in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, both that have a very high Eastern European ethnic population. Immigrants from Ukraine, Russia and Poland were frequently denounced and targeted.https://minorityrights.org/minorities/eastern-european-canadians/ During World War I, thousands of Ukrainian Canadians were seen as \"enemy aliens\" as Canadian nativists saw them as a \"threat\" to Canada's Western European heritage. Due to this, many of them were interned in concentration camps. There was constant discrimination towards Ukrainians who recently immigrated from the Austro-Hungarian Empire.https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/ukrainian-internment- in-canada ==Nazi Germany== Anti-Slavic racism was an essential component of Nazism.Bendersky, Joseph W. (2007).A concise history of Nazi Germany Plymouth, U.K.: Rowman & Littlefield. p. 161-2 Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party regarded Slavic countries (especially Poland, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia) and their peoples as non-Aryan Untermenschen (subhumans), they were deemed to be foreign nations that could not be considered part of the Aryan master race. Hitler in Mein Kampf stated: \u201cOne ought to cast the utmost doubt on the state- building power of the Slavs\u201d and from beginning rejected the idea of incorporating Slavs within Greater GermanyA Ridiculous Hundred Million Slavs: Concerning Adolf Hitler's World-view Jerzy Wojciech Borejsza, page 41, Wydawnictwo Neriton and Instytut Historii Polskiej Akademii Nauk, 2006 There were exceptions for some minorities in these states which were deemed by the Nazis to be the descendants of ethnic German settlers and not Slavs who were willing to be Germanized. Hitler considered the Slavs to be inferior, because the Bolshevik Revolution had put the Jews in power over the mass of Slavs, who were, by his own definition, incapable of ruling themselves but were instead being ruled by Jewish masters. He considered the development of Modern Russia to have been the work of Germanic, not Slavic, elements in the nation, but believed those achievements had been undone and destroyed by the October Revolution.Bendersky, Joseph W. (2000) A History of Nazi Germany: 1919-1945. Plymouth, UK: Rowman & Littlefield. p.177. Because, according to the Nazis, the German people needed more territory to sustain its surplus population, an ideology of conquest and depopulation was formulated for Central and Eastern Europe according to the principle of Lebensraum, itself based on an older theme in German nationalism which maintained that Germany had a \"natural yearning\" to expand its borders eastward (Drang Nach Osten). The Nazis' policy towards Slavs was to exterminate or enslave the vast majority of the Slavic population and repopulate their lands with millions of ethnic Germans and other Germanic peoples. According to the resulting genocidal Generalplan Ost, millions of German and other \"Germanic\" settlers would be moved into the conquered territories, and the original Slavic inhabitants were to be annihilated, removed or enslaved. The policy was focused especially towards the Soviet Union, as it alone was deemed capable of providing enough territory to accomplish this goal.Hitler, Adolf (1926). Mein Kampf, Chapter XIV: Eastern Orientation or Eastern Policy. Quote: \"If we speak of soil [to be conquered for German settlement] in Europe today, we can primarily have in mind only Russia and her vassal border states.\" As part of this policy, the Hunger Plan was developed, which included seizing food produced on the occupied Soviet territory and delivering it primarily to German army. This should ultimately result in the starvation and death of 20 to 30 million people (mainly Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians). It is estimated that in 1941\u20131944 over four million Soviet citizens were starved according to this plan.Snyder, Timothy (2010) Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin. New York: Basic Books. p.411. The resettlement policy reached a much more advanced state in Occupied Poland because of its immediate proximity to Germany. To deviate from ideological theories for strategic reasons by forging alliances with Independent State of Croatia (created after the invasion of Yugoslavia), and Bulgaria, puppet regime described the Croats officially as being \"more Germanic than Slav\", a notion made by Croatia's fascist dictator Ante Paveli\u0107 who imposed the view that the \"Croatians were the descendants of the ancient Goths\" who \"had the Panslav idea forced upon them as something artificial\".Rich, Norman (1974) Hitler's War Aims: the Establishment of the New Order. New York: W. W. Norton & Company. p.276-7.Hitler, Adolf and Gerhard, Weinberg (2007). Hitler's Table Talk, 1941-1944: His Private Conversations. Enigma Books. p.356. Quoting Hitler: \"For example to label the Bulgarians as Slavs is pure nonsense; originally they were Turkomans.\" However the Nazi regime continued to classify the Croats as \"subhumans\" despite its alliance with them.Davies, Norman (2008) Europe at War 1939\u20131945: No Simple Victory. Pan Macmillan. pp.167,209. Hitler also deemed the Bulgarians to be \"Turkoman\" in origin. == Greece == Traditionally, in Greece, Slavic people are considered as invaders who separated the glory of Greek Antiquity, by bringing an era of decline and ruin to Greece \u2013 the Dark Ages. In 1913, when Greece took control of Slavic inhabited areas in Northern Greece, the Slavic toponyms were changed to Greek, as according to the Greek government this was \"the elimination of all the names which pollute and disfigure the beautiful appearance of our fatherland.\" Anti-Slavic sentiment escalated during the Greek Civil War, where Macedonian partisans, who aligned themselves with the Democratic Army of Greece, were not treated as equals and suffered discrimination everywhere, as they chose to identify as Slavic, not Greek, thus being considered a \"sin\" for not being Greek, and being Slavic. The Macedonian partisans were subjected to threats of extermination, physical attacks, murder, attacks on their settlements, forcible expulsions, restrictions of freedom of movement, bureaucratic problems, among other discriminatory acts. Although allied with the Greek Left, due to their Slavic identity, Macedonians were viewed by the Greek Left with suspicion and animosity. In 1948, the Democratic Army of Greece evacuated tens of thousands of child refugees, both Greek and Slavic in origin. In 1985, the refugees were allowed to re-enter Greece, and claim Greek citizenship, and reclaim property, only if they were \"Greek by genus\", thus prohibiting those with a Slavic identity from obtaining Greek citizenship, entry into Greece, and claiming property. Today, the Greek state does not recognize its ethnic Macedonian and other Slavic minorities, claiming that they do not exist, with Greece therefore having the right to not grant any rights that are guaranteed by human rights treaties. == See also == * Anti-Catholicism * Anti-Croat sentiment * Anti-Polish sentiment * Anti-Russian sentiment * Anti-Serbian sentiment * Anti-Ukrainian sentiment * Final Solution of the Czech Question * Pan-Slavism * Persecution of Eastern Orthodox Christians * Refugees of the Greek Civil War * Slavic Speakers of Greek Macedonia * Zamo\u015b\u0107 Uprising == References == Notes Further reading * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ",
