Kalady, a wedding photographer who also has a couple of ad films to his credit. Most of the crew members also did not have any experience in cinema. Binu says, \"All we had was optimism. We were a bunch of photographers whose only association with cinema was as an audience. But, I had unbridled passion for movies and that\u2019s how I decided to do a movie. I spent almost a year on another project, but couldn\u2019t get a producer. Then my friends suggested I come up with a more cost-effective project so that we could pump in the money ourselves. That\u2019s when I zeroed in on Ithihasa.\" The film centers on body swapping, a theme that has been explored earlier in many films. The director says: \"This thread has been explored earlier in Hollywood, as in It\u2019s a Boy Girl Thing. Another film featuring a story on body swapping was Freaky Friday. We used this thread to develop into a story suited for the Indian audience.\" According to some reviewers, the film is loosely based on the 2002 Hollywood film The Hot Chick. Binu said in an interview that actors and actresses whom he initially approached rejected the script saying the story was too unbelievable. Later he signed Shine Tom Chacko and Anusree as the lead pair. Binu had interacted with Shine Tom Chacko earlier and was confident he could do the lead character.

He says: \"The director had approached me for a short film, but the project did not take off due to some reason. He had narrated the thread of Ithihasa then. There is a Hollywood film, The Hot Chick, with a similar storyline; Binu was confident about the subject and so I agreed to do it.\" Recalling the efforts that went into be the character, Shine said in an interview that playing a woman was quite challenging but being a keen observer of women from childhood helped him to become the character effortlessly.
