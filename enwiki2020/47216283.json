He can play as an attacking midfielder or a forward. ==Club career== Born in Luanda, Gelson began his career with local C.D. Primeiro de Agosto. In July 2015, it was reported that he was being scouted by Portugal's S.L. Benfica. He scored 23 goals in 27 games as his team won the Girabola in 2016, and subsequently he and teammate Ary Papel signed for Sporting Clube de Portugal for undisclosed fees on contracts with \u20ac60 million release clauses. After arriving in Lisbon in January 2017, Gelson made his debut for Sporting B in LigaPro on 15 January, playing the full 90 minutes of a 4\u20130 loss at Portimonense. Eight days later he scored his first goal, opening a 1\u20131 home draw with S.C. Covilh\u00e3. He totalled 13 goals in 17 games in his first season in the league, including four on 2 April in a 5\u20131 win over S.C. Olhanense. He was first called up to Jorge Jesus' main squad for the Primeira Liga match at C.D. Feirense on 13 May, remaining unused in a 2\u20131 loss, but made his top flight debut eight days later in the final match of the season, replacing namesake Gelson Martins at the end of a 4\u20131 win over G.D. Chaves at the Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade. Back in the reserves on 30 September 2017, Gelson scored a hat-trick in a 4\u20133 home win over C.D. Santa Clara. ==International career== Gelson made his international debut for Angola on 13 June 2015 in a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification match against the Central African Republic at the Est\u00e1dio Nacional da Tundavala, scoring twice in a 4\u20130 victory. On 4 July, he scored both goals in a win over Swaziland in Luanda to win the tie 4\u20132 on aggregate in the preliminary round of 2016 African Nations Championship qualification. ==Honors== Angola *Four Nations Tournament bronze medal:2018https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2018/03/21/world/friendlies/south- africa/angola/2758132/ ==Career statistics== {| class=wikitable style=\"text- align: center;\" !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|National Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Continental !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=5|1\u00ba de Agosto |2013 |Girabola |4||2||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||4||2 |- |2014 |Girabola |19||9||2||1||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||21||10 |- |2015 |Girabola |26||8||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||26||8 |- |2016 |Girabola |27||23||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||28||23 |- !colspan=2|Total !76!!42!!3!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!79!!43 |- |rowspan=3|Sporting B |2016\u201317 |LigaPro |17||13||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||17||13 |- |2017\u201318 |LigaPro |6||4||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||6||4 |- !colspan=2|Total !23!!17!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!23!!17 |- |rowspan=4|Sporting CP |2016\u201317 |Primeira Liga |1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2017\u201318 |Primeira Liga |0||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2018\u201319 |Primeira Liga |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !1!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0 |- |rowspan=3|Rio Ave (loan) |2017\u201318 |Primeira Liga |5||0||1||1||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||6||1 |- |2018\u201319 |Primeira Liga |19||5||0||0||3||1||2||1||24||7 |- !colspan=2|Total !24!!5!!1!!1!!3!!1!!2!!1!!30!!8 |- |rowspan=1|Antalyaspor (loan) |2019\u201320 |S\u00fcper Lig |6||0||3||1||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||9||1 |- |rowspan=1|Rio Ave (loan) |2019\u201320 |Primeira Liga |14||6||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||14||6 |- !colspan=3|Career total !144!!70!!8!!3!!3!!1!!2!!1!!157!!75 |- |} ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Angola's goal tally first. {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !Goal!!Date!!Venue!!Opponent!!Score!!Result!!Competition |- | 1. || rowspan=\"2\" | 13 June 2015 || rowspan=\"2\" | Est\u00e1dio Nacional da Tundavala, Lubango, Angola || rowspan=\"2\" | || align=center | 1\u20130 || rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 4\u20130 || rowspan=\"2\" | 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification |- | 2. || align=center | 3\u20130 |- | 3. || rowspan=\"2\" | 4 July 2015 || rowspan=\"2\" | Est\u00e1dio 11 de Novembro, Luanda, Angola || rowspan=\"2\" | || align=center | 1\u20130 || rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 2\u20130 || rowspan=\"2\" | 2016 African Nations Championship qualification |- | 4. || align=center | 2\u20130 |- | 5. || 24 October 2015 || Est\u00e1dio 11 de Novembro, Luanda, Angola || || align=center | 1\u20131 || align=center | 1\u20132 || 2016 African Nations Championship qualification |- | 6. || 13 November 2015 || Estadio Nacional de Ombaka, Benguela, Angola || || align=center | 1\u20130 || align=center | 1\u20133 || 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification |- | 7. || 21 January 2016 || Stade Huye, Butare, Rwanda || || align=center | 1\u20133 || align=center | 2\u20134 || 2016 African Nations Championship |- | 8. || 3 September 2016 || Est\u00e1dio 11 de Novembro, Luanda, Angola || || align=center | 1\u20131 || align=center | 1\u20131 || 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification |- | 9. || 10 June 2017 || Stade du 4 Ao\u00fbt, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso || || align=center | 1\u20131 || align=center | 1\u20133 || 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification |- | 10. || 9 September 2018 || Est\u00e1dio 11 de Novembro, Luanda, Angola || || align=center | 1\u20130 || align=center | 1\u20130 || 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification |- | 11. || 12 October 2018 || Est\u00e1dio 11 de Novembro, Luanda, Angola || || align=center | 4\u20131 || align=center | 4\u20131 || 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualification |} ==References== == External links == * * Gerson 1\u00ba de Agosto profile * Category:Living people Category:1996 births Category:Association football forwards Category:Angolan footballers Category:Angolan expatriate footballers Category:Angola international footballers Category:2019 Africa Cup of Nations players Category:C.D.
