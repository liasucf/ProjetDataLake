    "text": "This article lists the diesel locomotives that have operated or are operating on Indian Railways. == Classification == Locomotives were classified by track gauge, motive power, function and power (or model number) in a four- or five- letter code. The first letter denotes the track gauge. The second letter denotes motive power (diesel or electric), and the third letter denotes use (goods, passenger, mixed or shunting). The fourth letter denotes a locomotive's chronological model number. In 2002, a new classification system was adopted. For newer diesel locomotives, the fourth letter denotes their horsepower range. Not all diesel locomotives were reclassified, and the fourth letter continues to denotes their model number. A locomotive may have a fifth letter, generally denoting a technical variant, subclass or subtype: a variation in the basic model or series, or a different motor or manufacturer. Under the new system, the fifth letter further refines horsepower in 100-hp increments: A for 100 hp, B for 200 hp, C for 300 hp and so on. A WDP-3A is a locomotive, and a WDM-3F is . The system does not apply to steam locomotives, which are no longer used on main lines. They retain their original class names, such as M- or WP-class. === Syntax === * First letter (gauge): ** W \u2013 Broad gauge (wide) \u2013 ** Y \u2013 Metre gauge (yard) \u2013 ** Z \u2013 narrow gauge ** N \u2013 narrow (toy) gauge * Second letter (motive power): ** D \u2013 Diesel ** C \u2013 DC electric (DC overhead line) ** A \u2013 AC electric (AC overhead line) ** CA \u2013 DC and AC (AC or DC overhead line); CA is considered one letter ** B \u2013 Battery (rare) * Third letter (job type): ** G \u2013 Goods ** P \u2013 Passenger ** M \u2013 Mixed (goods and passenger) ** S \u2013 Shunting (switching) ** U \u2013 Multiple unit (electric or diesel) ** R \u2013 Railcar In WDM 3A, W denotes broad gauge; D denotes diesel power; M denotes mixed use (goods and passenger service), and 3A denotes (3,000 + 100). In WAP 5, W is broad gauge; A is AC electric; P is passenger service, and 5 indicates that the locomotive is the fifth model used. == Broad-gauge locomotives == Broad-gauge diesel classification codes are: * WDM \u2013 Wide diesel mixed * WDP \u2013 Wide diesel passenger * WDG \u2013 Wide diesel goods * WDS \u2013 Wide diesel shunter === Mixed class (WDM series) === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Manufacturer !Wheel Arr !Quantity Built !Built year(s) !Power !Current Status !Preserved units !Comments !Picture |- |WDM-1 |ALCO |Co-Co |100 |1957-1959 |1950 HP |Retired |1 |First mainline diesel locomotive |frameless |- |WDM-2 |ALCO/DLW |Co-Co |1440 |1962\u20131998 |2600 HP |In service |9 |A few still in service |frameless |- |WDM-2G |DLW |Co-Co |2 |2013 |2400 HP |In Service | | | |- |WDM-3 |Henschel |Bo-Bo |8 |1970 |2500 HP |Retired |None | |frameless |- |WDM-3A |DLW |Co-Co |1402 |1994\u20131998 |3100 HP |In service |1 Earmarked | |frameless |- |WDM-3B |DLW |Co-Co |8, all rebuilt back to WDM-3D |2005-2006 |3100 HP |In service | |All rebuilt back to WDM-3D |frameless |- |WDM-3C |DLW |Co-Co |10 |2002 |3300 HP |In service |None |All rebuilt back to WDM-3A | |- |WDM-3D |DLW |Co-Co |500 |2003-2013 |3300 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDM-3E |DLW |Co-Co |8 |2008 |3500 HP |In service | | | |- |WDM-3F |DLW |Co-Co |3 |2008 |3600 HP |In service | | | |- |WDM-4 |GM |Co-Co |72 |1962 |2600 HP |Retired |2 | |frameless |- |WDM-6 |DLW |Bo-Bo |2 |1981-1982 |1350 HP |Retired |2 |Both units earmarked for preservation |frameless |- |WDM-7 |DLW |Co-Co |15 |1987\u20131989 |2000 HP |In service |1 Earmarked |Currently used for shunting uses only |frameless |} === Passenger class (WDP series) === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Manufacturer !Wheel Arr !Quantity Built !Built year(s) !Power !Current Status !Preserved units !Comments !Picture |- |WDP-1 |DLW |Bo-Bo |69 |1995\u20131999 |2300 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDP-3A |DLW |Co-Co |69 |1998\u20132002 |3100 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDP-4 |EMD/DLW |Bo1-1Bo |100 |2002\u20132011 |4000 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDP-4B |DLW |Co-Co |86 |2010\u20132014 |4500 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDP-4D |DLW |Co-Co |525 |2010\u20132018 |4500 HP |In service | | |frameless |} === Goods class (WDG series) === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Manufacturer !Wheel Arr !Quantity Built !Built year(s) !Power !Current Status !Preserved units !Comments !Picture |- |WDG-3A |DLW |Co-Co |1998 |1995\u20132010 |3100 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDG-3B |DLW |Co-Co |4 |2004 |3200 HP |In service | | | |- |WDG-3C |DLW |Co-Co |1 |2001 |3300 HP |In service | | | |- |WDG-3D |DLW |Co-Co |1 |2001 |3400 HP |In service | | | |- |WDG-4 |EMD/DLW |Co-Co |1188 |1999\u20132012 |4000 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDG-4G |GE |Co-Co |209 |2017\u2013present |4500 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDG-4D |EMD |Co-Co |583 |2013\u20132018 |4500 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDG-5 |EMD |Co-Co |7 |2012-2017 |5500 HP |In service | | |frameless |- |WDG-6G |GE |Co-Co |4 |2018\u2013present |6000 HP |In service | | |frameless |} === Shunter class (WDS series) === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Manufacturer !Wheel Arr !Quantity Built !Built year(s) !Power !Current Status !Preserved units !Comments !Picture |- |WDS-1 |GE |Bo-Bo |15 |1944-1945 |386 HP |Retired |1 |India's first diesel locomotive |frameless |- |WDS-2 |Kraus Maffei |C |30 |1954-1955 |440 HP |Retired | | |frameless |- |WDS-3 |Maschi- nenbau Kiel |C |7 |1961 |618 HP |Retired | | |frameless |- |WDS-4 |CLW |C |27 |1968-1969 |600 HP | Few are still in service |4 |A few still in service |frameless |- |WDS-4A |CLW |C |5 |1968 |660 HP |Retired | | |frameless |- |WDS-4B |CLW |C |450 |1969 |700 HP |Retired | | |frameless |- |WDS-4C |CLW |C |7 |1976-78 |700 HP |Retired | | |frameless |- |WDS-4D |CLW |C |120 |1984-97 |700 HP |Retired | | |frameless |- |WDS-5 |ALCO/DLW |Co-Co |21 |1967 |1065 HP |In service | |A few still in service |frameless |- |WDS-6 |DLW |Co-Co |270 |1975\u2013 |1400 |In service |2 Earmarked | |frameless |- |WDS-6AD |DLW |Co-Co |270 |1975\u2013 |1400 |In service |2 Earmarked | |frameless |- |WDS-8 |CLW |Bo-Bo |5 |1979-1982 |800 HP |Retired | | |frameless |} == Meter-gauge locomotives == Metre-gauge diesel classification code is: * YDM -
