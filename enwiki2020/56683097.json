By the time he succeeded to the estate, it had fallen into disrepair and had been emptied. In 1843, he commissioned Scottish architect William Burn to redesign the new abbey in a mixture of Jacobean and Elizabethan, also known as Jacobethan. The building was demolished in 1844, with its materials sold at auction, to make way for the abbey's third incarnation. During this period, new screen gates and a lodge were added on the south boundary. The estate was then completed in 1846 and, following financial losses from the Great Depression of British Agriculture, the estate was passed to Stanhope's elected heir, Edward Stanhope. ==Political career== He was elected MP for North Lincolnshire in 1852 and held the seat until he stood down in 1868. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1859\u20131865 Category:1821 births Category:1904 deaths James ",
