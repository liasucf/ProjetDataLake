    "text": "Dayananda Saraswati () (12 February 1824 \u2013 30 October 1883) was an Indian philosopher, social leader and founder of the Arya Samaj, a reform movement of the Vedic dharma. He was the first to give the call for Swaraj as \"India for Indians\" in 1876, a call later taken up by Lokmanya Tilak.Aurobindo Ghosh, Bankim Tilak Dayanand (Calcutta 1947 p1)\"Lokmanya Tilak also said that Swami Dayanand was the first who proclaimed Swaraj for Bharatpita i.e.India.\"Dayanand Saraswati Commentary on Yajurved (Lazarus Press Banaras 1876) Denouncing the idolatry and ritualistic worship prevalent in India at the time, he worked towards reviving Vedic ideologies. Subsequently, the philosopher and President of India, S. Radhakrishnan called him one of the \"makers of Modern India\", as did Sri Aurobindo. Those who were influenced by and followed Dayananda included Madam Cama, Pandit Lekh Ram, Swami Shraddhanand, Pandit Guru Dutt Vidyarthi, Shyamji Krishna Varma (who established the Indian Home Rule Society and India House in England), Kishan Singh, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Lala Hardayal, Madan Lal Dhingra, Ram Prasad Bismil, Mahadev Govind Ranade, Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Mahatma Hansraj, Lala Lajpat Rai,Lala Lajpat Rai (Indian writer, politician and Escort) \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia Yogmaya Neupane. He was a sanyasi (ascetic) from boyhood and a scholar. He believed in the infallible authority of the Vedas. Dayananda advocated the doctrine of Karma and Reincarnation. He emphasized the Vedic ideals of brahmacharya, including celibacy and devotion to God. Among Dayananda's contributions were his promoting of the equal rights for women, such as the right to education and reading of Indian scriptures, and his commentary on the Vedas from Vedic Sanskrit in Sanskrit as well as in Hindi. == Early life == Dayananda Saraswati was born on the 10th day of waning moon in the month of Purnimanta Falguna (12 February 1824) on the tithi to a Brahmin Hindu family in Jeevapar Tankara, Kathiawad region (now Morbi district of Gujarat.)\u0a9d\u0a82\u0aa1\u0abe\u0aa7\u0abe\u0ab0\u0ac0 \u2013 \u0aae\u0ab9\u0ab0\u0acd\u0ab7\u0abf \u0aa6\u0aaf\u0abe\u0aa8\u0a82\u0aa6 \u2013 Gujarati Wikisource His original name was Mul Shankar because he was born in Dhanu Rashi and Mul Nakshatra. His father was Karshanji Lalji Kapadi, and his mother was Yashodabai. When he was eight years old, his Yajnopavita Sanskara ceremony was performed, marking his entry into formal education. His father was a follower of Shiva and taught him the ways to impress Shiva. He was also taught the importance of keeping fasts. On the occasion of Shivratri, Dayananda sat awake the whole night in obedience to Shiva. During one of these fasts, he saw a mouse eating the offerings and running over the idol's body. After seeing this, he questioned that if Shiva could not defend himself against a mouse, then how could he be the saviour of the world. The deaths of his younger sister and his uncle from cholera led Dayananda to ponder the meaning of life and death. He began asking questions which worried his parents. He was engaged in his early teens, but he decided marriage was not for him and ran away from home in 1846. Dayananda Saraswati spent nearly twenty-five years, from 1845 to 1869, as a wandering ascetic, searching for religious truth. He gave up material goods and lived a life of self-denial, devoting himself to spiritual pursuits in forests, retreats in the Himalayan Mountains, and pilgrimage sites in northern India. During these years he practised various forms of yoga and became a disciple of a religious teacher named Virajanand Dandeesha. Virajanand believed that Hinduism had strayed from its historical roots and that many of its practices had become impure. Dayananda Sarasvati promised Virajanand that he would devote his life to restoring the rightful place of the Vedas in the Hindu faith. == Dayanand's mission == Aum or Om is considered by the Arya Samaj to be the highest and most proper name of God. He believed that Hinduism had been corrupted by divergence from the founding principles of the Vedas and that Hindus had been misled by the priesthood for the priests' self-aggrandizement. For this mission, he founded the Arya Samaj, enunciating the Ten Universal Principles as a code for Universalism, called Krinvanto Vishwaryam. With these principles, he intended the whole world to be an abode for Nobles (Aryas). His next step was to reform Hinduism with a new dedication to God. He travelled the country challenging religious scholars and priests to discussions, winning repeatedly through the strength of his arguments and knowledge of Sanskrit and Vedas. Hindu priests discouraged the laity from reading Vedic scriptures, and encouraged rituals, such as bathing in the Ganges River and feeding of priests on anniversaries, which Dayananda pronounced as superstitions or self-serving practices. By exhorting the nation to reject such superstitious notions, his aim was to educate the nation to return to the teachings of the Vedas, and to follow the Vedic way of life. He also exhorted the Hindu nation to accept social reforms, including the importance of Cows for national prosperity as well as the adoption of Hindi as the national language for national integration. Through his daily life and practice of yoga and asanas, teachings, preaching, sermons and writings, he inspired the Hindu nation to aspire to Swarajya (self governance), nationalism, and spiritualism. He advocated the equal rights and respects to women and advocated for the education of all children, regardless of gender. Dayanand also made critical analyses of faiths including Christianity & Islam, as well as of other Indian faiths like Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. In addition to discouraging idolatry in Hinduism, he was also against what he considered to be the corruption of the true and pure faith in his own country. Unlike many other reform movements of his times within Hinduism, the Arya Samaj's appeal was addressed not only to the educated few in India, but to the world as a whole as evidenced in the sixth principle of the Arya Samaj. As a result, his teachings professed universalism for all the living beings and not for any particular sect, faith, community or nation. Arya Samaj allows and encourages converts to Hinduism. Dayananda's concept of dharma is stated in the \"Beliefs and Disbeliefs\" section of Satyartha Prakash, he says: > Dayananda's Vedic message emphasized respect and reverence for other human > beings, supported by the Vedic notion of the divine nature of the > individual. In the ten principles of the Arya Samaj, he enshrined the idea > that \"All actions should be performed with the prime objective of benefiting > mankind\", as opposed to following dogmatic rituals or revering idols and > symbols. The first five principles speak of Truth, while the last five speak > of a society with nobility, civics, co-living, and disciplined life. In his > own life, he interpreted moksha to be a lower calling, as it argued for > benefits to the individual, rather than calling to emancipate others. > Dayananda's \"back to the Vedas\" message influenced many thinkers and > philosophers the world over. ===Activities=== Dayanand Saraswati is recorded > to have been active since he was 14, which time he was able to recite > religious verses and teach about them. He was respected at the time for > taking part in religious debates. His debates were attended by large crowds. > On 22 October 1869 in Varanasi, where he won a debate against 27 scholars > and 12 expert pandits. The debate was said to have been attended by over > 50,000 people. The main topic was \"Do the Vedas uphold deity > worship?\"Sinhal, p. 17 he was also a socio religious reformer lived in 19 th > century. == Arya Samaj == Dayananda Saraswati's creations, the Arya Samaj, > condemned practices of several different religions and communities, > including such practices as idol worship, animal sacrifice, pilgrimages, > priest craft, offerings made in temples, the castes, child marriages, meat > eating and discrimination against women. He argued that all of these > practices ran contrary to good sense and the wisdom of the Vedas. == Views > on superstitions == He severely criticized practices which he considered to > be superstitions, including sorcery, and astrology, which were prevalent in > India at the time. Below are several quotes from his book, Sathyarth > Prakash: > On Astrology, he wrote, He makes a clear distinction between Jyotisha > Shaastra and astrology, calling astrology a fraud. == Views on other > religions == ===Islam=== He viewed Islam to be waging wars and immorality. > He doubted that Islam had anything to do with the God, and questioned why a > God would hate every non-believer, allowing the slaughter of animals, and > command Muhammad to slaughter innocent people.Title = \"Journal of Indian > Council of Philosophical Research, Volume 19, Issue 1\", publisher = ICPR, > year = 2002, page = 73 He further described Muhammad as \"imposter\", and one > who held out \"a bait to men and women, in the name of God, to compass his > own selfish needs\". He regarded Quran as \"Not the Word of God. It is a human > work. Hence it cannot be believed in\". ===Christianity=== His analysis of > the Bible was based on an attempt to compare it with scientific evidence, > morality, and other properties. His analysis claimed that the Bible contains > many stories and precepts that are immoral, praising cruelty, deceit and > that encourage sin. One commentary notes many alleged discrepancies and > fallacies of logic in the Bible e.g. that God fearing Adam eating the fruit > of life and becoming his equal displays jealousy. His critique attempts to > show logical fallacies in the Bible, and throughout he asserts that the > events depicted in the Bible portray God as a man rather than an Omniscient, > Omnipotent or Complete being. He opposed the perpetual virginity of Mary, he > added that such doctrines are simply against the nature of law, and that God > would never break his own law because God is omniscient and infallible. > ===Sikhism=== He regarded Guru Nanak as \"rogue\", who was quite ignorant > about Vedas, Sanskrit, Shashtra, and otherwise Nanak wouldn't be mistaking > with words. He further pointed that followers of Sikhism are to be blamed > for making up stories that Nanak possessed miraculous powers, met Gods. He > slammed Guru Gobind Singh, and other Gurus to have been \"invented fictitious > stories\", although he also recognized Gobind Singh to be \"indeed a very > brave man.\" ===Jainism=== He regarded Jainism as \"a most dreadful religion\", > writing that Jains were intolerant and hostile towards the non-Jains. > ===Buddhism=== Dayananda described Buddhism as ridiculous and \"atheistic\". > He describes the type of \"salvation\" Buddhism as being attainable even to > dogs and donkeys. He further criticized the Cosmogony of Buddhism, stating > that the earth was not created. ==Assassination attempts== Dayananda was > subjected to many unsuccessful attempts on his life. According to his > supporters, he was poisoned on a few occasions, but due to his regular > practice of Hatha Yoga he survived all such attempts. One story tells that > attackers once attempted to drown him in a river, but Dayananda dragged the > assailants into the river instead, though he released them before they > drowned. Another account claims that he was attacked by Muslims who were > offended by his criticism of Islam while meditating on the Ganges river. > They threw him into the water but he is claimed to have saved himself > because his pranayama practice allowed him to stay under water until the > attackers left.Vandematharam Veerabhadra Rao (1987) Life Sketch of Swami > Dayananda, Delhi. p. 13 == Assassination == In 1883, the Maharaja of > Jodhpur, Jaswant Singh II, invited Dayananda to stay at his palace.
