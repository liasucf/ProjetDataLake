To the north is the Atlantic Ocean, and most of the settlement is concentrated along the main Regional E.R.1-1\u00aa roadway that connects these parishes dominated by farmlands, while to the interior forests and scrub dominate the elevated hills. This roadway follows a straight line from the coastal cliffs, one of the few straight links on the island. From Ponta Delgada an ancillary roadway (the E.R.4-1\u00aa) bisects the parish before extending to the west, and reaching the frontier with Capelas, where it follows the border to the coast. Much of the settlement of S\u00e3o Vicente Ferreira is located in the interior of the parish, marked by a near triangular confluence of roadways. This area is delineated by one axis, beginning with the E.R.4-1\u00aa (Rua da Cidade) and Rua dos Po\u00e7os (in the west); and the Rua da Arrenquinha, Rua do Outeiro, Rua da Igreja and Rua da Beira Mar (in the east). ==References== Category:Parishes of Ponta Delgada ",
