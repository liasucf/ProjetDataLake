    "text": "Pot TV is a web-based video channel owned by Canadian cannabis activist Jodie Emery. The channel has been used as a forum for activism in the fight over the legalization of marijuana by the renowned \"Prince of Pot\" Marc Emery and others. It has existed since the Spring of 1999, with broadcasts originally coming from Marc Emery's Sunshine Coast basement. Shows are now filmed from Pot TV's studio in Vancouver. Contributors include Greg Williams \u2013 known as Marijuana Man \u2013 who along with Marc Emery and Michelle Rainey was arrested in July 2005 by Canadian police at the request of the US government following an investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration. Guests have included former Texas drug enforcement officer Barry Cooper. Featured programs included: * \"The Big Toke\", a \"cannabis comedy hour\" * \"The Grow Show\" * \"Cannabis Common Sense\" * \"Shake 'n Bake\", a cannabis cooking show * \"Healing Herb Hour\", exploring medical marijuana * \"Prince of Pot\", Marc Emery's personal show * \"Yours in Defence\", a legal discussion concerning cannabis * \"The Tommie Morgan Show\", reality show from Oklahoma * \"Burning Shiva\", exploring the role of cannabis in ancient religions with author and former Pot TV station manager Chris Bennett. ==Current status== The station was originally funded with revenues from Marc Emery's marijuana seed selling business. Following the arrest of Emery and the end of his seed sales in 2005 Pot TV's budget was reduced dramatically, with staff and funding for new content cut. However, using user-generated content in conjunction with modern video tools like YouTube and BitTorrent, the station has been able to reduce streaming costs and continue to provide access to new content. As of 2011 Pot TV has been producing several live shows per day from Vancouver and Toronto including on-location coverage of cannabis events. ==References== ==External links== *Official Website *Effects Of CBD Category:Video podcasts Category:Television series about cannabis Category:Internet properties established in 1999 Category:Canadian works about cannabis Category:1999 establishments in Canada ",
