    "text": "By Zurbaran Cyril of Constantinople (d. c. 1235) was reputed to have been a General of the Carmelites and prior of the hermits on Mount Carmel for three years. He is said to have had the gift of prophecy. ==Narrative== Cyril was reputed to be a priest and hermit on Mount Carmel.Staring, Adrian. \"Cyril of Constantinople (XIII Cent.)\", carmelnet.org One of the pseudo-prophecies, given out towards the end of the thirteenth century by the Franciscan Spirituals, and attributed to Cyril of Jerusalem, became known to Guido de Perpignan and other Carmelites at Paris, who ascribed it to their former general, now considered a saint and a doctor of the Church, his feast day being introduced in 1399. Zimmerman, Benedict. \"St. Cyril of Constantinople.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 16 April 2020 In the Breviary lessons he was also confused with Cyril of Alexandria. When the mistake was discovered (1430, but the confusion was maintained in the Venice Breviary, 1542), his title of doctor was justified by attributing to him a work, of which no trace exists, on the procession of the Holy Ghost. The so-called \"Cyrillic prophecy\" or angelic oracle Divinum oraculum S. Cyrillo Carmelitae Constantinopolitano solemni legatione angeli missum, so called because it is supposed to have been brought by an angel while Cyril was saying Mass, is a lengthy document of eleven chapters in incomprehensible language, with a commentary falsely ascribed to Abbot Joachim. It is first mentioned by Arnold of Villanova, c. 1295; Telesphorus of Cosenza applied it to the Western Schism and treated it as an utterance of the Holy Ghost. Another writing erroneously attributed to Cyril is De processu sui Ordinis, by a contemporary, probably a French author; edited by Daniel a Virgine Mari\u00e2 in Speculum Carmelitarum. ==See also== *Carmelite Rule of St. Albert *Carmelite Rite *Book of the First Monks *Constitutions of the Carmelite Order ==References== ==External links== *Saints.SQPN.com *Secular Discalced Carmelite Order Category:Priors Category:Carmelite spirituality Category:Carmelites Category:Venerated Carmelites Category:Angelic visionaries ",
