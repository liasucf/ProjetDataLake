    "text": "Ruta and Daitya is a studio album recorded by Keith Jarrett and Jack DeJohnette in 1971 and released by ECM Records in 1973. It features seven duet pieces that show Jarrett's last performances on electric keyboards. == Making of == In his Jarrett biography Ian Carr states that \"early in 1971, when the Miles Davis group was doing a few days at Shelly's Manne Hole in Los Angeles, a friend from the Sunset Studios there offered Jarrett and DeJohnette some free studio time to record as a duo. They took drums and percussion and the electric piano and organ from the club and made a tape (..)\" and that after the Facing You recording session Jarrett gave Manfred Eicher the tapes of the duo recording to be mixed and produce the album.Carr, Ian. Keith Jarrett: The Man and His Music (New York: Da Capo, 1992), p.56, 61. ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Richard S. Ginell awarded the album 3 stars, stating, \"this is a valuable, underrated transition album that provides perhaps the last glimpse of the electric Keith Jarrett as he embarked on his notorious (and ultimately triumphant) anti-electric crusade\". ==Track listing== :All compositions by Keith Jarrett and Jack DeJohnette except as indicated # \"Overture/Communion\" - 6:00 # \"Ruta and Daitya\" - 11:14 # \"All We Got\" - 2:00 # \"Sounds of Peru/Submergence/Awakening\" - 6:31 # \"Algeria\" - 5:47 # \"You Know, You Know\" (Jarrett) - 7:44 # \"Pastel Morning\" (Jarrett) - 2:04 ==Personnel== *Keith Jarrett \u2013 piano, electric piano, organ, flute *Jack DeJohnette - drums, percussion == Technical Personnel == * Kurt Rapp, Martin Wieland - Mixing Engineers * Barbara Wojirsch - Cover Design and Layout * Manfred Eicher - Production == References == Category:Keith Jarrett albums Category:Jack DeJohnette albums Category:ECM Records albums Category:1971 albums Category:Albums produced by Manfred Eicher ",
