    "text": "Iracema (in Portuguese: Iracema - A Lenda do Cear\u00e1) is one of the three indigenous novels by Jos\u00e9 de Alencar. It was first published in 1865. The novel has been adapted into several films. ==Plot introduction== The story revolves around the relationship between the Tabajara indigenous woman, Iracema, and the Portuguese colonist, Martim, who was allied with the Tabajara nation's enemies, the Pitiguaras. Through the novel, Alencar tries to remake the history of the Brazilian colonial state of Cear\u00e1, with Moacir, the son of Iracema and Martim, as the first true Brazilian in Cear\u00e1. This pure Brazilian is born from the love of the natural, innocence (Iracema), culture and knowledge (Martim), and also represents the mixture (miscegenation) of the native race with the European race to produce a new caboclo race. ===Explanation of the novel's title=== Iracema is Guarani language for honey- lips, from ira - honey, and tembe - lips. Tembe changed to ceme, as in the word ceme iba, according to the author. \"Iracema\" is also an anagram of \"America\", noted by critics as befitting the allegorization of colonization of America by Europeans, the novel's main theme. ==Characters in Iracema== *Andira: Araqu\u00e9m's brother. Old warrior and hero of his people. *Araqu\u00e9m: Iracema's father. Spiritual leader of the Tabajara's nation. *Batuiret\u00e9: Poti's grandfather *Caubi: Iracema's brother *Iracema: Araqu\u00e9m's daughter. She is the beautiful Tabajara woman with honey-lips and dark hair. *Irapu\u00e3: The warrior leader of the Tabajara nation. *Jaca\u00fana: Poti's brother. *Jatob\u00e1: Poti's father. He is an important veteran warrior of the Pitiguara's nation. *Martim: Portuguese colonist. Named in honor of Mars, the Roman god of war. *Moacir: The child of Martim and Iracema. *Poti: Martim's friend and the Pitiguara warrior who is brother of the Pitiguara leader. ==Iracema and the Indianist Novels== Iracema, along with the novels O Guarani and Ubirajara, portrays one of the stages of the formation of the Brazilian ethnic and cultural heritage. Iracema symbolizes the initial meeting between the white man (Europeans) and the natives. \"Moacir\" means \"Son of Pain\", which is related to his birth, alone with his mother, who was abandoned by Martim for some time when he had to go and help the Potiguaras in a tribal war against the Tabajaras. ==Awards and nominations== \"Iracema\", painting by Ant\u00f4nio Parreiras *There is a Brazilian stamp in honor of Iracema's centennial (1865/1965) and its author. *There is a Brazilian painting by Ant\u00f4nio Parreiras. *Iracema is cited in Manifesto Antrop\u00f3fago (Cannibal Manifesto), which is published in 1928 by Oswald de Andrade ==Adaptations== The novel was adapted several times into film.
