    "text": "Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio Carlos de Seixas (June 11, 1704 \u2013 August 25, 1742) was a pre- eminent Portuguese composer of the 18th century. An accomplished virtuoso of both the organ and the harpsichord, Seixas succeeded his father as the organist for Coimbra Cathedral at the age of fourteen. In 1720, he departed for the capital, Lisbon, where he was to serve as the organist for the royal chapel, one of the highest offices for a musician in Portugal, a position which earned him a knighthood. Much of Seixas\u2019 music rests in an ambiguous transitional period from the learned style of the 17th century to the galant style of the 18th century. ==Life== Seixas was born in Coimbra to Francisco Vaz and Marcelina Nunes. From a young age, he was surrounded by musical activity; his father served as the cathedral organist, and the flurry of musical activity in the local monastery of Santa Cruz had an equally important role in his musical training. In 1718, a few days before his father's death, Seixas succeeded his father as cathedral organist. Two years after, in 1720, he moved to Lisbon to take up his new position in the court of John V of Portugal as court organist and harpsichordist.SANDU, C., and D. C.

Citing his elegance and agility on the keyboard, he was a favorite teacher of many noble families, including the family of Lu\u00eds Xavier Furtado de Mendon\u00e7a, the Viscount of Barbacena, where he gave harpsichord lessons to the Viscount's wife and daughters in exchange for artistic patronage.d\u2019Alvarenga, Joao Pedro. \u201cSome Preliminaries in Approaching Carlos Seixas\u2019 Keyboard Sonatas.\u201d Ad Parnassum: A Journal of Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Instrumental Music 7, no. 13 (2009): 95\u2013128. Academia.edu (accessed March 18, 2016). In Lisbon, Seixas met Italian composer Domenico Scarlatti, who was working in Portugal from 1719 to 1728 as appointed director of the court cathedral. In an account by Jos\u00e9 Mazza in his Diccionario biographico de Musicos portugueses e noticia das suas composi\u00e7\u00f5es of 1780, the king's brother, Dom Ant\u00f3nio, arranged for Scarlatti to give Seixas harpsichord lessons. Scarlatti, immediately recognizing Seixas' talent, replied, \"You can give me lessons.\"SANDU, C., and D. C.

He was knighted in 1738 by the king, inducted into the Order of Christ. Four years later, in 1742, he died of a rheumatic fever, and was buried in the Santa Maria Basilica in Lisbon.Allison, Brian J. \"Carlos Seixas: The Development of the Keyboard Sonata in Eighteenth-Century Portugal. A Lecture Recital Together with Three Recitals of Selected Works of Johann Sebastian Bach, Samuel Barber, Ludwig van Beethoven, Frederic Chopin, Cesar Franck, Sergei Prokofieff, and Alexander Scriabin.\" Doctoral dissertation, North Texas State University, August 1982. ==Works== Seixas' keyboard works were written for a variety of instruments, including the organ, harpsichord, and the clavichord. Stylistically speaking, however, his sonatas showcase a range of musical styles: some are exemplary of a Baroque toccata; some are firmly in the galant style; some are clearly influenced by the German Empfindsamer Stil (literally 'sensitive style'). Despite rarely, if ever, traveling outside of Lisbon, his work also includes various geographical styles, such as the German Mannheim school, the French minuet, and the Italian style as composed by Scarlatti, his colleague and contemporary. Santiago Kastner, Seixas' biographer and editor of his pieces, describes Seixas' works as \"unoccupied\" with a particular form, and given over to frequent improvisation.Allison, Brian J. \"Carlos Seixas: The Development of the Keyboard Sonata in Eighteenth-Century Portugal. A Lecture Recital Together with Three Recitals of Selected Works of Johann Sebastian Bach, Samuel Barber, Ludwig van Beethoven, Frederic Chopin, Cesar Franck, Sergei Prokofieff, and Alexander Scriabin.\" Doctoral dissertation, North Texas State University, August 1982. Much of his work was destroyed in the earthquake that devastated Lisbon in 1755. Only three orchestral pieces and around one hundred keyboard sonatas out of over an alleged seven hundred survived, plus a handful of choral works for liturgical use (much more conservative than what one would expect from his instrumental music). Macario Santiago Kastner published collections of the sonatas in Portugaliae Musica. ==Choral works== *Mass in G. *Tantum ergo; *Ardebat vincentius; *Conceptio gloriosa; *Gloriosa virginis Mariae; *Hodie mobis caelorum; *Sicut cedrus; *Verbum caro; *Dythyrambus in honorem et laudem Div.
