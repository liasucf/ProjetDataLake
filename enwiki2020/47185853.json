In terms of number of dams, India ranks fourth after China, USA and Russia. However per capita storage in India is only 225 cubic metres, which is far less compared to China(1,200 cubic metres),\u201d Currently there are 4710 completed large dams and 390 are under construction. In India most of the dams are maintained by the State Governments while there are a few other organizations, namely, Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) and National Hydro Electric Power Corporation (NHPC) who also now own and operate dams. ==List== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- !State / UT !!
