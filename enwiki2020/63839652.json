After winning his first six fights, all by stoppage, he faced Lamont Capers on 4 May 2018. Capers received a point deduction in the first round for excessive holding before the contest was halted in the second round after Capers was shoved through the ropes and out of the ring. With capers not able to continue, the bout was scored a no contest (NC). Following six more wins, four by stoppage, S\u00e1nchez faced Victor Bisbal for the vacant WBO-NABO heavyweight title on 31 August 2019 at the Minneapolis Armory in Minneapolis, Minnesota. S\u00e1nchez defeated Bisbal via fourth-round corner retirement (RTD) after Bisbal's corner informed referee Celestino Ruiz that Bisbal was unwilling to continue before the start of the fifth round. After Efe Ajagba pulled out of a bout with Jack Mulowayi due to a back injury sustained during training, S\u00e1nchez was brought in as a late replacement. The bout took place on 26 October at the Santander Arena in Reading, Pennsylvania. S\u00e1nchez won a shutout unanimous decision (UD) to capture the vacant WBO-NABO title for a second time, with all three judges scoring the bout 100\u201390. His next fight came against Joey Dawejko for the vacant WBC Continental Americas heavyweight title on 7 March 2020 at the Barclays Center in New York City. S\u00e1nchez captured his second professional title via UD over ten rounds, with two judges scoring the bout 100\u201390 and the third scoring it 98\u201392. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |16 |Win |15\u20130 |align=left| Joey Dawejko |UD |10 |7 Mar 2020 |align=left| |align=left| |- |15 |Win |14\u20130 |align=left| Jack Mulowayi |UD |10 |26 Oct 2019 |align=left| |align=left| |- |14 |Win |13\u20130 |align=left| Victor Bisbal | |4 (10), |31 Aug 2019 |align=left| |align=left| |- |13 |Win |12\u20130 |align=left| Jason Bergman |TKO |2 (6), |13 Jul 2019 |align=left| | |- |12 |Win |11\u20130 |align=left| Willie Jake Jr. |KO |2 (8), |11 Jan 2019 |align=left| | |- |11 |Win |10\u20130 |align=left| Carlos Reyes |KO |1 (8), |30 Nov 2018 |align=left| | |- |10 |Win |9\u20130 |align=left| Garrett Wilson |UD |6 |20 Oct 2018 |align=left| | |- |9 |Win |8\u20130 |align=left| Francois Russell |TKO |2 (6), |30 Jun 2018 |align=left| | |- |8 |Win |7\u20130 |align=left| Miguel Cubos | |6 |1 Jun 2018 |align=left| | |- |7 |style=\"background:#DDD\"|NC |6\u20130 |align=left| Lamont Capers | |2 (6), |4 May 2018 |align=left| |align=left| |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |align=left| Brad Austin |TKO |1 (6), |26 Apr 2018 |align=left| | |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |align=left| Eric Salazar |TKO |1 (6), |23 Mar 2018 |align=left| | |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |align=left| Brian Green | |2 (6), |3 Mar 2018 |align=left| | |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |align=left| Juan Reyna |TKO |1 (4), |23 Feb 2018 |align=left| | |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |align=left| Manuel Eastman |TKO |2 (6), |27 Jan 2018 |align=left| | |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |align=left| Justin Thornton | |1 (6), |22 Sep 2017 |align=left| | |- |} ==References== Category:Living people Category:1992 births Category:Cuban male boxers Category:Sportspeople from Guant\u00e1namo Category:Heavyweight boxers ",
