The kidnapping of Ulrika Bideg\u00e5rd, a member of the Swedish national show jumping team, took place on 20 January 1993 in front of her family's home in Sint-Genesius-Rode, Belgium. Cash withdrawals made with her credit card led the police to the kidnapper, a man living in a downtown Brussels apartment, where Bideg\u00e5rd was kept captive. The man was arrested, and his victim rescued, after over four days of a captivity that made headlines in both Sweden and Belgium. Tried in 1995, the kidnapper was sentenced to fifteen years of penal labour.
