The band was to begin as a metal band, but Napier, who had injured his hands, began the project with a more programmed electronic foundation. The band describes their style as \"Multi-genre metal\". ==History== The project began in 2006, as a solo project of David Napier. Originally, he recorded a few songs with an electronic-based influence. The project debuted in 2006, with an EP called Afraid of the Light, which featured 5-electronic based songs. Three years past before the band's next release, an EP titled Signs & Peace, also very electronically influenced. By 2014, Tim\u014dr\u0101tus completely molded into its original vision of a metal band, releasing an EP, titled Black, which signified the style portrayed in the release. Only a few months after Black's release, the project released a follow-up with a completely different premise, Death, which portrayed a Death metal-style. In 2015, the project would release an electronically-influenced fuzz rock single, made for Napier's now-wife, Courtney, as a marriage proposal song depicted by the cover. Two more EPs would follow in the same year, titled Doom (Doom Metal-style) and Grind (Grindcore-style). All of the EPs, were concept releases, following the story of man named Kafla. Following his quadruple EP release, Tim\u014dr\u0101tus released their debut studio album, Reverentia, which was released digitally for free. The album also marked the band's debut on Christian Metal Underground Records, the band's new record label. The album was the first to feature David's wife, Courtney on vocals. The album received very mixed reviews, but all settling on the reviewers interested in hearing more. Tim\u014dr\u0101tus collaborated with another progressive metal act, Weapons of Indignation on a drone metal EP titled Compass, which featured both David Napier and Aleks Tengesdal working together on two tracks, with the release rounding out at around 17 minutes. The project's final release of 2017 was \"Christmas Present Crisis\", which presented several different styles, including grindcore, black metal, death metal, indie rock, hip hop and much more in a comical fashion. 2018 was a big year for the band, debuting in February with 7 Deadly Sins, a 7-minute grindcore EP, which debuted Courtney on unclean vocals. A single, \"Screen Attack\", came out in June, followed by the EP, For We Are Not Beasts, which released in July. It was later announced that Tim\u014dr\u0101tus would be featured on a four-way split Grind EP, slated for release on September 8 through Christian Metal Underground Records, featuring Abandoned Mortuary, Eternal After Death and Wise As Serpents. The band released a black metal split, with Symphony of Heaven and Bismoth titled Body of Christ, and it was released independently in March 2019, with Tim\u014dr\u0101tus\u2019 portion of the EP containing many guest musicians, including Jake Martin (Taking the Head of Goliath), Luke Renno (Taking the Head of Goliath, Crimson Thorn, Temple of Perdition), Max Kevin \u00d8lstoren (Shadow Puncher, Tunge Byrder), and Zack Plunkett (Abated Mass of Flesh, ex-Christageddon), as well as live drummer Mason Beard (Mystic Winter) contributing in addition. Later that year, the band would perform at Audiofeed Festival, sharing the stage with acts such as American Arson, Taking the Head of Goliath, Drottnar, and Crimson Moonlight. The band would also play three additional shows that year alongside Symphony of Heaven, Bleed the Masses, Shadows of Insanity, Malignant Vision, Pound, Hemwick, and Fall. On July 29, 2020, the band released their second album, My Life in a Mediocre Metal Band, a comedic metal album, featuring guest performances by Thompson and Beard, as well as Peter Watson of Elephant Watchtower and Eero Tertsunen of Renascent. ==Influences and style== Tim\u014dr\u0101tus is a peculiar band as far as style; the band has produced several releases, each with several different genres that were focused on.
