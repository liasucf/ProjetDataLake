    "text": "Littlewood's law states that a person can expect to experience events with odds of one in a million (defined by the law as a \"miracle\") at the rate of about one per month. ==History== The law was framed by Cambridge University Professor John Edensor Littlewood, and published in a 1986 collection of his work, A Mathematician's Miscellany. It seeks among other things to debunk one element of supposed supernatural phenomenology and is related to the more general law of truly large numbers, which states that with a sample size large enough, any outrageous (in terms of probability model of single sample) thing is likely to happen. ==Description== Littlewood defines a miracle as an exceptional event of special significance occurring at a frequency of one in a million. He assumes that during the hours in which a human is awake and alert, a human will see or hear one \"event\" per second, which may be either exceptional or unexceptional. Additionally, Littlewood supposes that a human is alert for about eight hours per day. As a result, a human will in 35 days have experienced under these suppositions about one million events. Accepting this definition of a miracle, one can expect to observe one miraculous event for every 35 days' time, on average - and therefore, according to this reasoning, seemingly miraculous events are actually commonplace. ==See also== * Coincidence * Confirmation bias * Gambler's fallacy * List of eponymous laws * Micromort * Orders of magnitude (probability) * Spurious relationship * Synchronicity ==References== *Littlewood's Miscellany, edited by B.
