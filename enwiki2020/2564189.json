It was one of the plays which he produced in 468 BC for the City Dionysia, the year he first won the prize for tragedy at the festival. Though the play is usually assumed to have been a tragedy, this is not certain, and it might instead have been a satyr play. The plot of the play is not known, though it probably centered around Triptolemos' mission to bring the art of agriculture to Greece.
