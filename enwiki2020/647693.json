    "text": "Thomas Slade Gorton III (January 8, 1928 \u2013 August 19, 2020) was an American politician and attorney. A Republican, he served as a U.S. Senator from Washington state from 1981 to 1987, and again from 1989 to 2001. He held both of the state's Senate seats in his career and was narrowly defeated for re- election twice as an incumbent, first in 1986 by Brock Adams and again in 2000 by Maria Cantwell following a recount. As of 2020, he was the last Republican U.S. senator from Washington. ==Early life and education== Gorton was born in Chicago, Illinois on January 8, 1928, and raised in the suburb of Evanston, the son of Ruth (Israel) and Thomas Slade Gorton, Jr. His younger brother is Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. He attended and graduated from Dartmouth College and subsequently from Columbia Law School. Gorton served in the United States Army from 1945 to 1946 and the United States Air Force from 1953 until 1956. He continued to serve in the Air Force Reserve Command until 1980, when he retired as a Colonel. == Early career == Gordon practiced law and entered politics in 1958, being elected to the Washington State Legislature, in which he served from 1959 until 1969, becoming one of its highest-ranking members. He then served as Attorney General of Washington from 1969 until he entered the United States Senate in 1981. During his three terms as Attorney General, Gorton was recognized for taking the unusual step of appearing personally to argue the state's positions before the Supreme Court of the United States, and for prevailing in those efforts. ==U.S. Senate campaigns== ===1980=== In 1980, Gorton defeated longtime incumbent U.S. Senator and state legend Warren Magnuson by a 54% to 46% margin. ===1986=== Gorton was defeated by former Congressman and Carter administration Transportation Secretary Brock Adams. ===1988=== Gorton ran for the state's other Senate seat, which was being vacated by political ally Dan Evans, in 1988 and won, defeating liberal Congressman Mike Lowry by a narrow margin. In the Senate, Gorton had a moderate-to-conservative voting record, and was derided for what some perceived as strong hostility towards Indian tribes. His reelection strategy centered on running up high vote totals in areas outside of left-leaning King County (home to Seattle). ===1994=== In 1994, Gorton repeated the process, defeating then-King County Councilman Ron Sims by 56% to 44%. He was an influential member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee as he was the only member of the committee during his tenure to have reached a senior command rank in the uniformed services (USAF). Gorton campaigned in Oregon for Gordon Smith and his successful 1996 Senate run. In 1999, Gorton was among ten Republican Senators who voted against the charge of perjury during Clinton's impeachment, although he voted for Clinton's conviction on the charge of obstruction of justice. ===2000=== In 2000, Democrat Maria Cantwell turned his \"it's time for a change\" strategy against him and won by 2,229 votes. Furthermore, Washington's Indian tribes strongly opposed Gorton in 2000 because he consistently tried to weaken Indian sovereignty while in the Senate.Getches, David H., Charles F. Wilkinson, Robert A. Williams, Jr. Cases and Materials on Federal Indian Law (2005). St. Paul: Thompson West. 5th ed. p. 29. Twice during his tenure in the Senate, Gorton sat at the Candy Desk. ==Later career== In 2002, Gorton became a member of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (popularly known as the \"9/11 Commission\") and the commission issued its final report in 2004. In 2005, Gorton became the Chairman of the center-right Constitutional Law PAC, a political action committee formed to help elect candidates to the Washington State Supreme Court and Court of Appeals. Gorton was an Advisory Board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. Gorton also served as a Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Gorton served on the Board of Trustees of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, which is a museum dedicated to the U.S. Constitution. Gorton represented the city of Seattle in a lawsuit against Clay Bennett to prevent the relocation of the Seattle SuperSonics basketball franchise, in accordance to a contract that would keep the team in KeyArena until 2010. The city reached a settlement with Bennett, allowing him to move the team to Oklahoma City for $45 million with the possibility for another $30 million. In 2010, the National Bureau of Asian Research founded the Slade Gorton International Policy Center. The Gorton Center is a policy research center, with three focus areas: policy research, fellowship and internship programs, and the Gorton History Program (archives). In 2013 the Gorton Center was the secretariat for the \u2018Commission on The Theft of American Intellectual Property\u2019, in which Gorton was a commissioner. Gorton is also a Counselor at the National Bureau of Asian Research. In 2012, Gorton was appointed to the board of directors of Clearwire, a wireless data services provider. Gorton was a member of the board of the Discovery Institute, notable for its advocacy of intelligent design. Gorton was also of counsel at K&L; Gates LLP. Gorton opposed the candidacy of Donald Trump for President of the United States in 2016, instead writing in Independent candidate Evan McMullin. He later supported the impeachment of President Trump and urged other Republicans to join him. ==Personal life== He married Sally Clark Gorton on June 28, 1958. Sally died in 2013. Gorton died after a brief illness at the home of his daughter in the Seattle suburb of Clyde Hill on August 19, 2020, at the age of 92. ==References== ==Further reading== *Hughes, John C., Slade Gorton: A Half Century in Politics (2011) (authorized biography) ==External links== *Congressional Bio *Kirkpatrick & Lockhart Preston Gates Ellis LLP (\"K&L; Gates\") Lawyer Bio *The Next Ten Years of Post-9/11 Security Efforts, Q&A; with Slade Gorton (September 2011) * |- |- |- |- Category:1928 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Bipartisan Policy Center Category:Columbia Law School alumni Category:Dartmouth College alumni Category:Discovery Institute fellows and advisors Category:Intelligent design advocates Category:Lawyers from Chicago Category:Members of the Washington House of Representatives Category:Military personnel from Illinois Category:National Bureau of Asian Research Category:People from Clyde Hill, Washington Category:Politicians from Chicago Category:Recipients of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana, 1st Class Category:Republican Party United States senators Category:United States senators from Washington (state) Category:Washington (state) Attorneys General Category:Washington (state) lawyers Category:Washington (state) Republicans ",
