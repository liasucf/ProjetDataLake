The film was released on 20 March 2015 alongside nine other Tamil films. ==Critical reception== The Times of India gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Kallappadam works more as a heist movie, probably because we have only recently had Jigarthanda and KTVI talk about the film industry and they did it better. So, the first half, when we get to see the characters' struggles feels fairly routine and the film receives a jolt of energy only when they start to plan the robbery. But the gripping second half makes up for the earlier disappointment\". Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \"Vadivel is nothing if not ambitious, but his ideas are easier to applaud than his filmmaking skills. The pace is sluggish, and the film comes to life only in the heist portions...more fatally for the film, the leads just don\u2019t measure up. It may be nice in a meta-ish sense to cast behind-the-scenes people, but there\u2019s a reason actors make a living. There are things like charisma, timing, dialogue delivery, reaction shots \u2014 none of these is in evidence\". Indo-Asian News Service gave it 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"What we get to see may not be exceptional, but something far offbeat than the mainstream garbage that's thrown at the audiences every week..With some good ideas and intentions, Kallappadam could've been an excellent meta film. But it still doesn't disappoint\". Indiaglitz gave 3 out of 5 and wrote, \"Vadivel has presented an engaging screenplay with some intelligent twists...The courage to do an independent movie is highly appreciable, but the obvious production constraints pull down the movie to some extent\". Sify wrote, \"The biggest strength of Kallappadam is the film's promising plot and screenplay which is incorporated with some well executed sequences...but that's not enough to declare Kallappadam as a perfect movie...Kallapadam is a film where everything is enjoyable except for the misfit casting of protagonists and dreary dialogues\". Deccan Chronicle wrote, \"Kallappadam is a solid piece of writing, but mired by a skewed view of casting and capturing the screenplay...the problem with the film is its questionable casting. Nevertheless, the film can be watched once for it novel concept\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:Indian films Category:2015 directorial debut films Category:Indian thriller films Category:2015 thriller films Category:Indian heist films Category:Films scored by K (Indian composer) Category:2010s heist films ",
