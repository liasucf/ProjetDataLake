    "text": "Rap krey\u00f2l, is a music genre originating from Haiti and only from Haiti and sung by artists of Haitian origin. Often, hardcore beats are used while the artist raps in Haitian Creole. Rap krey\u00f2l has been part of Haitian culture since the early 1980s with groups such as Original Rap Staff, King Posee, Rap Krey\u00f2l S.A., Masters of Haiti, Fighters, Blackdo, Fam-Squad, Supa Deno, Prince Berlin and Muzion attaining prominence, but lately has become very popular with Haitian youth. Another notable group from the 1990s is Black Leaders. The impact of Black Leaders and its members is lasting. Though known primarily for his role in Black Leaders, Don Roy is still an active contributor to Haitian music across many genres. Since the peak of his notoriety, Don Roy has chosen to create in other genres. While still working in a production capacity in genres such as Rap Krey\u00f2l and Reggae, Don Roy has chosen to create and work with prominent artists of the modern roots/Rasin movement.http://www.ambafrance-ht.org/L-Institut-francais-chaque-jour Many Haitian Rap Kreyol artists have had rough childhoods and difficult living conditions producing rappers who address socio-economic topics in their lyrics. Though similar to mainstream American hip hop in that materialistic imagery is portrayed or lyricized, the negative aspects of less fortunate Haitian society, such as topics concerning slum life, gang warfare, the drug trade, and poverty, are much more. Notable Rap Kreyol Artists: Rockfam,Sky\u2019z Da Limit, Brimad, Topson , Chale Republic, Pick Up Click, BriganDie, Team Lobey, Dezod Beats, G Bobby Bon Flo, Steves J. Bryan,Baky,Troubleboy,Wendy, Zeekapten, Levite Sound, Oz\u2019mosis, Roody Rood Boy and Steady Tek-Nick have gained popularity among the Haitian population. However, the godfather of this Culturally Unique genre Rap Kreyol in Haiti is the late Master Dji, who not only released the first Rap Kreyol song in the early 1980s, formed the group Rap Krey\u00f2l S.A., but was also the first Haitian DJ and also influential in encouraging other young Haitians such as Supa Deno, DJ Fanfan and DJ Live to become rappers, DJs, and breakdancers. ==See also== *Rab\u00f2day *Rasin ==References== * Mat Mag: Haitian hip hop \u2014 for \"Mat'Mag\" 2010 broadcast on Haitian national television, with journalist Nelly Alberola.
