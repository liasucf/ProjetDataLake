Retrieved 25 May 2015 He turned professional in 1973 and relocating to Shrewsbury. Larry was managed throughout his professional boxing career by Mike Sendall After winning his first seven fights, including victories over former Spanish welterweight champion Antonio Torres, Don McMillan, and Pat Dwyer, he faced Bobby Arthur in September 1973 for the inaugural British light middleweight title. Paul knocked Arthur out in the tenth round to become British champion.
