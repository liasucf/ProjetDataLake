His first coach was Vladimir Kutataladze. After studying at the Tbilisi State University of Georgia he joined the diplomatic Academy. Although he got a diploma \"Master Sporta\" Waterpolo (2002). Soon the talented player got his first engagement abroad in Italy: first he played by \"Rari Nantes Florentia\" 1993-1997. After returning to Russia (Dinamo from 1997\u20132000) he got a special contract, which allowed him to study at the Moscow University in the economic departure. In 1997 he was the first time a member of the Russian National Squad. 1998 he played at the Goodwill Games. In 2000 he played again for one of the best clubs in Italy, Pro Recco, in the near of Genua (2000\u20132001). His engagement at Pro Recco wasn't so successful as it was awaited. So the last station abroad of the Russian Nationalplayer was at Mladost from Zagreb in Croatia where he has been for 3 seasons. Under the coach Ozren Bona\u010di\u0107 he won the Croatian Champiosships with Mladost twice. One of his personal high-lights was when he scored the winning goal in the final of the FINA Cup 2002 against Hungary. In Athens 2004, Tchomakhidze made the difference in Russia's bronze medal victory. The right-hander's four goals lifted his team to a 6-5 win over Greece. Revaz Tchomakhidze decided to go back to Russia and he is still one of the best player in the young team of Sturm 2002 in Tchechow - a little town before the doors of Moskow. Although he is still a member of the Russian National Squad. When he was asked when he is going to stop his career he said that his wish would be to play until the Olympic Games in China 2008. In an interview with Novaja izvestija he showed himself very selfprowded: \"\u00ab\u041d\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u044f \u2013 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u044b\u00bb\" (Translation: I shall not be over- modest, I am the best player in Europe). In February 2007 shocked Tchomakhidze with the message, that he left the Nationalsquad one month before the World Championships in Melbourne, Australia. In an interview he said he feels very tired and needs a break. If he would return to the Russian team was still open. He was invited for the 2008 Qualification tournament in March, but he again cancelled his participation for the Russian National Squad. With his club Sthurm 2002 Chekhov he gained 2008 the first place in LEN Trophy. It was a big point for the Russian club, because it was the first International triumph for the young team. Til summer 2009 Revaz played for Chekhov.
