It is a Prakrit phrase meaning \"May all the evil that has been done be fruitless\".Chapple. C.K. (2006) Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life Delhi:Motilal Banarasidas Publ. p.46 ==Observance== On this sacred day, every member of the Jain community approaches everyone, irrespective of religion, and begs for forgiveness for all their faults or mistakes, committed either knowingly or unknowingly. Thus relieved of the heavy burden hanging over their head of the sins of yesteryears, they start life afresh, living in peaceful co-existence with others. Indeed, this day is not merely a traditional ritual, but a first step on their path to moksha (liberation) or salvation, the final goal of every man's life, according to the teachings of Jainism.Kshamavaani Day or kshama Divas of Jain People Mahavira said we should forgive our own soul first. To forgive others is a practical application of this supreme forgiveness. It is the path of spiritual purification. Mahavira said: \"The one whom you hurt or kill is you. All souls are equal and similar and have the same nature and qualities\". Ahimsa Paramo Dharma. Anger begets more anger and forgiveness and love beget more forgiveness and love. Forgiveness benefits both the forgiver and the forgiven. Forgiveness is the other name of non-violence (Ahimsa) which shows the right path of 'Live and Let Live' to one and all. Forgiveness teaches us Ahimsa (non-violence) and through ahimsa we should learn to practice forbearance. ==Michchhami Dukkadam Prayer== {| class=\"wikitable\" |--- | | I forgive all living beings. |- | | May all souls forgive me, |- | |I am friendly terms with all, |- | |I have no animosity toward any soul. |- | |May all my faults be dissolved. |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |---- |\u0916\u092e\u094d\u092e\u093e\u092e\u093f \u0938\u0935\u094d\u0935 \u091c\u0940\u0935\u0947\u0937\u0941 \u0938\u0935\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u091c\u0940\u0935\u093e \u0916\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u092e\u0947\u0902, \u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u0935\u094d\u0935 \u092d\u0942 \u090f \u0938\u0942 \u0935\u0948\u0930\u092e\u094d \u092e\u091c\u094d\u091d\u0923\u092e\u094d \u0915\u0947\u0923 \u0907 |- |Kh\u00e4memi Savve Jiv\u00e4, Savve Jiv\u00e4 Khamantu Mi Mitti Me Savva bhuesu, Veram majjham na Kenai. |- |\u0938\u092c \u091c\u0940\u0935\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u092e\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e\u093e \u0915\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0942\u0902, \u0938\u092c \u091c\u0940\u0935 \u092e\u0941\u091d\u0947 \u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e\u093e \u0915\u0930\u0947 \u0938\u092c \u091c\u0940\u0935\u094b \u0938\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u093e \u092e\u0948\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092d\u093e\u0935 \u0930\u0939\u0947, \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0940 \u0938\u0947 \u0935\u0948\u0930-\u092d\u093e\u0935 \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u0930\u0939\u0947 |- |} Kshamavani Parva celebrates forgiveness as a way to a life of love, friendship, peace and harmony. When you forgive, you stop feeling resentful; there is no more indignation or anger against another for a perceived offence, difference or mistake; there is no clamour for punishment. It means the end of violence (Himsa). == Samvatsari and Kshamavaani == While Samvatsari and Kshamavaani are typically associated with Shwetambar sect and Digambara respectively, there is no major difference between the two days and both are observed as Forgiveness Days. Rather, the two are usually used interchangeably. However, a major difference between the two is that despite both Samvatsari and Kshamavaani falling on the last day of Paryushan, they are in fact two different days. This is because the Paryushan festival for the two sects itself commences on different dates and is of varying duration. As a result, while Samvatsari is observed on Shukla Panchami of Bhadrapada month by the Shwetambars, the Digambaras celebrate it on the first day of Ashvin Krishna month of the lunar- based Jain calendar. ==See also== * Forgiveness in Jainism * Micchami Dukkadam * Samvatsari ==References== ==External links== * Celebrate Forgiveness: Kshamavani Divas * Kshamavani Parva Category:Jain festivals ",
