    "text": "The Dirt Soundtrack is the soundtrack album to the 2019 biographical film of the same name by M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, inspired by the book The Dirt: Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band by the band and Neil Strauss. The soundtrack was released by M\u00f6tley Records and Eleven Seven Records on March 22, 2019, on CD, LP, and digital formats. It is the band\u2019s first release in over a decade since their 2009 Greatest Hits album. ==Background== On February 22, 2019, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Machine Gun Kelly (who plays Tommy Lee in the film) released the music video for their song \"The Dirt (Est. 1981)\" on their YouTube channel. The band also announced that aside from the aforementioned song, the film's soundtrack would feature three new recordings, all produced with longtime collaborator Bob Rock: \"Ride with the Devil\", \"Crash and Burn\", and a cover of the Madonna song \"Like a Virgin\".
