    "text": "The wedding of Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones took place on Friday, 6 May 1960 at Westminster Abbey in London. The Princess Margaret was the second daughter of King George VI and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, while Antony Armstrong-Jones was a noted society photographer. ==Engagement== Princess Margaret met photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones in 1958 at a dinner party at the Chelsea home of Lady Elizabeth Cavendish. Though Armstrong-Jones was the photographer at the wedding of Margaret's friends, Lady Anne Coke and The Hon. Colin Tennant, in April 1956. In October 1959, Armstrong-Jones was invited to stay at Balmoral Castle. It was assumed by the public he was there to photograph the royal family. They became engaged shortly after and on 26 February 1960, Clarence House announced the engagement. Armstrong-Jones presented the Princess with a ruby surrounded by a marguerite of diamonds ring. He had designed the ring himself to resemble a rose in honor of Margaret's middle name. Two days before the wedding, on 4 May, there was a white-tie ball at Buckingham Palace attended by the Prime Minister and the Archbishop of Canterbury. ==Wedding== A ticket for the wedding procession ===Ceremony=== Margaret made her way with the Duke of Edinburgh from Clarence House in the Glass Coach, arriving at the church at 11:30. The wedding took place at Westminster Abbey and was conducted by The Most Rev. Dr. Geoffery Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury and The Very Rev. Eric Abbott, Dean of Westminster. It was the first royal wedding to be broadcast on television with an estimated 300 million viewers. ===Attendants=== Armstrong-Jones's best man was Dr. Roger Gilliatt, son of the Queen's gynecologist. The Countess of Rosse, the groom's mother, had hoped he would choose his half-brother, Lord Oxmantown, as his best man. However, resentment of their mother's favoritism led him to reject this suggestion. On 19 March, it was announced he had chosen Jeremy Fry for the role, but Fry was convicted of \"importuning for immoral purposes\" after allegedly approaching a man for sex, so was replaced. Princess Margaret was attended by eight young bridesmaids: * The Princess Anne, daughter of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh * Miss Angela Nevill, daughter of Lord and Lady Rupert Nevill * Lady Rose Nevill, daughter of The Marquess and Marchioness of Abergavenny * The Hon.

On 15 December of that year, Snowdon remarried Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, separating in 2000. They had a daughter, Frances (b. 1979).
