Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=532592 on 2016-08-01 ==Description== The shell grows to a length of 8.5 mm, its diameter 4 mm. (Original description) The small, white shell is solid and nearly smooth. It has a large smooth protoconch of about two whorls and four and a half subsequent whorls. The suture is distinct, not appressed, the fasciole in front of it obscure, not constricted. The only sculpture on typical specimens consists of feeble incremental lines. There are faint indications of ribbing on some of the worn specimens which may belong to this species. The whorls are well rounded and rather rapidly increase in diameter. The aperture is ample. The anal sulcus is wide and shallow. The outer lip is slightly thickened and inflected. The siphonal canal is wide and hardly differentiated. The columella is short and strong, the axis impervious.
