    "text": "The Integral is a diesel multiple unit (DMU) train type operated by Bayerische Oberlandbahn on regional services between Munich, Bayrischzell, Lenggries and Tegernsee from 1998 to 2020. They were built by the now defunct Jenbacher Werke. ==Formation== Interior view Each Integral unit consists of five sections, formed as follows. The two \"FGZ\" sections are suspended by the end- and intermediate cars. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Car !! Endwagen 2 end car 2 !! Fahrgastzelle passenger section !! Mittelwagen intermediate car !!

Equipment | Diesel-hydraulic motor || || Two unpowered wheelsets || || Diesel-hydraulic motor |- ! Wheelsets | 2 || none || 2 || none || 2 |- |} ==Technical specifications== The trains are powered by diesel-hydraulic motors. One end car has all wheelsets powered, the other end car has only one powered wheelset. All six wheelsets use active radial steering. The trains are able to run in multiple unit formation. ==History== The trains entered service in November 1998. Following problems and malfunctions, the fleet was returned to its manufacturer in Jenbach, and was overhauled, which increased their reliability. One unit was used at the Test- and Validationcenter Wegberg- Wildenrath for testing of an anti-collision system by the Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR). The Integral trains were withdrawn after their last day of service on July 25, 2020, being replaced by LINT 54 units. These LINT 54 units will be similar to those used by Bayerische Regiobahn between Munich and F\u00fcssen, as well as between Augsburg and Landsberg am Lech since December 2018.
