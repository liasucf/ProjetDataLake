It is named after Wonalancet, a 17th-century sachem of the Pennacook, a Native American people. Mount Wonalancet lies in Grafton County, immediately west of the Carroll County border, the county in which Ferncroft and Wonalancet are located. To its immediate north and sharing the same massif is Hibbard Mountain. The pair lie between popular Mount Chocorua to the east, Mount Passaconaway to the north, and Mount Whiteface to the west. Along with Mount Paugus, due east, the group makes up the easternmost mountains of the Sandwich Range, the southernmost of the White Mountains. To the south, the Sandwich Range is bordered by the Ossipee Mountains immediately north of Lake Winnipesaukee.
