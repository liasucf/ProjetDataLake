Pier Francesco Guala (15 September 1698 \u2013 27 February 1757), also known as Pierfrancesco and Pietro Francesco, was an eighteenth-century Italian painter active for the most part in the region of his place of birth, Casale Monferrato. Guala was the seventh of eight siblings of whom only he and a sister survived infancy. His mother died when he was five and he was brought up by his father, Lorenzo, who himself was a painter and perhaps related to the architect Sebastiano Guala. Pier Francesco Guala died in Milan on 27 February 1757. ==References== * * (A bibliography for the article is provided here.) ==Resources== Category:1698 births Category:1757 deaths Category:People from Casale Monferrato Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:18th-century Italian painters Category:Italian Baroque painters ",
