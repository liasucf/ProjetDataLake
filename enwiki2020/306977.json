    "text": "Jason Eckhardt's cover for the Necronomicon Press 1993 edition Fungi from Yuggoth is a sequence of 36 sonnets by cosmic horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. Most of the sonnets were written between 27 December 1929 \u2013 4 January 1930; thereafter individual sonnets appeared in Weird Tales and other genre magazines. The sequence was published complete in Beyond the Wall of Sleep (Sauk City, Wisconsin: Arkham House, 1943, 395\u2013407) and The Ancient Track: The Complete Poetical Works of H. P. Lovecraft (San Francisco: Night Shade Books, 2001, 64\u201379; expanded 2nd ed, NY Hippocampus Press, 2013). Ballantine Books\u2019 mass paperback edition, Fungi From Yuggoth & Other Poems (Random House, New York, 1971) included other poetic works. The sequence has been printed in several different versions as standalone chapbooks. In June 1943, Bill Evans (Washington DC) issued a separate appearance which lacked the final three sonnets. In 1977 Necronomicon Press, (West Warwick, RI) issued the complete sequence as The Fungi from Yuggoth (475 numbered copies). This may have been the first time that the sequence was published in its corrected text.S. T. Joshi, David E. Schultz, An H.P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia, Westport, Connecticut, 2001, pp 95-6 The same press went on to reissue it with new cover artwork by Jason Eckhardt in limited editions from 1982 onwards and other illustrated editions from different presses were to follow. In 2017 came a limited annotated edition of the sequence with illustrations by Jason Eckhardt for each poem (Hippocampus Press, New York).Hippocampus Press ==Style== Fungi from Yuggoth represents a marked departure from the mannered poems Lovecraft had been writing up to this point. Sending a copy of \"Recapture\" (which just predates the sequence but was later incorporated into it) the poet remarks that it is 'illustrative of my efforts to practice what I preach regarding direct and unaffected diction'.Themodernword.com S. T. Joshi, H. P. Lovecraft The sonnet forms used by Lovecraft veer between the Petrarchan and the Shakespearean. His multiple use there of feminine rhyme is reminiscent of A. E. Housman (e.g. in sonnets 15, 19). In addition, his sonnet 13 (Hesperia) has much the same theme as Housman's \"Into my heart an air that kills\" (A Shropshire Lad XL). Varying opinions have been expressed in the critical literature on Lovecraft as to whether the poems form a continuous cycle which tells a story, or whether each individual sonnet is discrete. (See essays in Bibliography below by Boerem, Ellis, Schultz, Vaughan and Waugh). Phillip A. Ellis, in his essay \"Unity in Diversity: Fungi from Yuggoth as a Unified Setting\", discusses this problem and suggests a solution.Lovecraft Annual 1, 2007, pp.84-90 S. T. Joshi considers that apart from the first three sonnets, \"the remaining poems, which HPL considered suitable for publication independent of the introductory poems, are discontinuous vignettes concerning a variety of unrelated weird themes, told in the first person and (apparently) third person. The cumulative effect is that of a series of shifting dream images.\" S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz, An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2001, p. 95 ==Themes== The first three poems in the sequence concern a person who obtains an ancient book of esoteric knowledge that seems to allow one to travel to parallel realities or strange parts of the universe. Later poems deal more with an atmosphere of cosmic horror, or create a mood of being shut out from former felicity, and do not have a strong narrative through-line except occasionally over a couple of sonnets (e.g. 17-18). In that the sequence starts by seeming to provide 'the key' to the author's 'vague visions' (Sonnet 3) of other realities behind the everyday, it might be argued that the poems that follow, though disparate in themselves, detail a succession of such visions that a reading of the book releases. With one or two exceptions, the concluding poems from \"Expectancy\" (28) onward seek to explain the circumstances of the narrator's sense of alienation within the present. Rather than visions themselves, these poems serve as a commentary on their source.The question is discussed in Jim Moon, \"Fungi from Yuggoth II: a tour of Yuggoth\" The sonnets see-saw between various themes in much the same way as do Lovecraft's short stories. There are references to the author's night terrors in \"Recognition\" (4), a potent source for his later fiction and carrying forward into dream poems related to his Dunsany manner; to intimations of an Elder Race on earth; and to nightmare beings from Beyond.Encyclopedia of World Biography, Gale Group 2010 That these themes often cross-fertilize each other is suggested by \"Star Winds\" (14), which taken purely by itself is an exercise in Dunsanian dream-lore. However, beginning in the month after finishing his sequence, Lovecraft set to work on his story The Whisperer in Darkness (1931) where Yuggoth is recreated as a planet of fungoid beings given the name of Mi-go.Online text In the sonnet, the fungi sprout in a location called Yuggoth, not on an alien planet; and in its following line Nithon is described as a world with richly flowering continents rather than, as in the story, Yuggoth's occulted moon. This is a good instance of how Lovecraft gave himself license to be self-contradictory and vary his matter according to the artistic need of the moment, of which the diversity of conflicting situations within the whole sequence of sonnets is itself an example.David Szolloskei, Creating Real Fiction: Analysis of the Lovecraftian Prose-Fiction, VDM Verlag 2008 Or, as he himself puts it in \"Star Winds\", :::Yet for each dream these winds to us convey, :::A dozen more of ours they sweep away! In addition to The Whisperer in Darkness, the cycle references other works by Lovecraft and introduces a number of ideas that he would expand upon in later works. * The town of Innsmouth is mentioned in sonnets VIII (\"The Port\") and XIX (\"The Bells\") * The story told in sonnet XII (\"The Howler\") presages \"The Dreams in the Witch House\" (1932). Its description of the witch's familiar, described as \"a four-pawed thing with human face,\" echoes the description of Brown Jenkin, a rat-like creature with a human face. * Sonnet XV references the ancient city in his story At the Mountains of Madness (1931) and hints at the Elder Things inhabiting it. * Sonnet XX names both the Nightgaunts from The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath and the Shoggoths from \"At the Mountains of Madness\". * Sonnets XXI and XXII respectively are named for and concern the Outer Gods Nyarlathotep and Azathoth. *Sonnet XXVI deals with events preceding those in \"The Dunwich Horror\" (1929). *Sonnet XXVII references the Plateau of Leng, mentioned in many of Lovecraft's works, and the masked Old One from Robert W. Chambers' The King in Yellow. ==Discography== * Harold S. Farnese (1885-1945) set two sonnets to music, \u201cMirage\u201d and \u201cThe Elder Pharos\u201d, and performed them in 1932. Sheet music was printed after Lovecraft\u2019s death. Performances were finally recorded for the Fedogan & Bremer reissue in 2015 (see below).S. T. Joshi, David E. Schultz, An H.P.
