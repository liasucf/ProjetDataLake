Bethlehem Down is full of the starlight Winds for the spices, and stars for the gold, Mary for sleep, and for lullaby music Songs of a shepherd by Bethlehem fold. When He is King they will clothe Him in grave- sheets, Myrrh for embalming, and wood for a crown, He that lies now in the white arms of Mary Sleeping so lightly on Bethlehem Down. Here He has peace and a short while for dreaming, Close-huddled oxen to keep Him from cold, Mary for love, and for lullaby music Songs of a shepherd by Bethlehem fold. ==See also== *List of compositions by Peter Warlock ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:Anthems Category:Christmas carols Category:Compositions by Peter Warlock Category:1927 songs Category:Songs about Israel Category:Epiphany music ",
