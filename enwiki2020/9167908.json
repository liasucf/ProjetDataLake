Taylorsville Lake, its major feature, extends into parts of Anderson County and Nelson County. Taylorsville Lake gains its name from the nearby town, named for President Zachary Taylor's father, Richard Taylor, who donated of his own land for creation of the town.

The dam, which measures a height of and a length of , cost $28.8 million to build. The resulting lake is in total area, has of shoreline, and is long. ==Activities and amenities== There is both a park office, maintained by the state of Kentucky, and a visitors center maintained by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The visitors center is pyramid-shaped with a brown metal roof, and contains displays of the local trees, boating, and dam management. Fishing is the main attraction, as Taylorsville Lake is the most heavily stocked lake in the Commonwealth of Kentucky; it is known for its bluegill, and features bass and crappie. This is facilitated by a rule that bass must be long, at minimum, to be legally caught and kept; crappie must be ; bluegill are not sport fish and there is no minimum size.

Camping was not available at the park until 1998. ==References== ==External links== *Taylorsville Lake State Park Kentucky Department of Parks Category:Protected areas of Anderson County, Kentucky Category:State parks of Kentucky Category:Protected areas of Nelson County, Kentucky Category:Protected areas of Spencer County, Kentucky Category:Protected areas established in 1983 Category:1983 establishments in Kentucky ",
