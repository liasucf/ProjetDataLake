    "text": "\"I Just Don't Like This Kind of Living\" is a song written by Hank Williams and released as his thirteenth single on MGM Records in January 1950. The song peaked at #5 on the Best Selling Retail Folk Records chart. == Background == The song expresses frustration and resentment towards a frigid woman who will not reciprocate the narrator's affection. The song, which alludes to \"fussin' and fightin'\" and contains the line \"You ain't never bin known to be wrong, and I ain't never bin right,\" was likely inspired by Hank's tumultuous relationship with his wife at the time, Audrey Williams, with biographer Colin Escott musing, \"Audrey's thoughts can only be guessed at as she heard the substance of their domestic disputes on the radio, particularly as only one side ever got aired.\" Williams recorded the song on August 30, 1949 at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio (the same session that produced the B-side \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\"). He is backed by members of the Pleasant Valley Boys \u2013 Zeke Turner (lead guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), and Louis Innis (rhythm guitar) \u2013 as well as Tommy Jackson (fiddle) and Ernie Newton (bass).\" ==Cover versions== *George Jones recorded a version for his 1962 album My Favorites of Hank Williams on United Artists. *In 1965 the song appeared as an overdubbed duet by Williams and his son Hank Williams, Jr. *Also in 1965, a version by Johnny Horton was released and was likely recorded about 1960. https://www.discogs.com/Johnny-Horton-I-Just-Dont-Like-This-Kind-Of-Livin- Rock-Island-Line/master/509400 == References == ==Bibliography== * Category:1949 songs Category:Songs written by Hank Williams Category:Hank Williams songs Category:MGM Records singles ",
