Some equate inerrancy with biblical infallibility; others do not.McKim, DK, Westminster dictionary of theological terms, Westminster John Knox Press, 1996.Geisler, N. L. (ed), Inerrancy, Zondervan, 1980, p. 22. \"The trouble is that such a distinction is nowhere to be found in Jesus' own teaching, and seems to be precluded by His testimony both to the unqualified historical accuracy and the inspiration of the Old Testament ... The attempt to discriminate ... seems to be a product of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries\". The belief is of particular significance within parts of evangelicalism, where it is formulated in the \"Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy\". A formal statement in favor of biblical inerrancy was published in the Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society in 1978.\"Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy\", Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society vol. 21 no. 4 (December 1978), 289\u201396. The signatories to the \"Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy\" admit that, \"Inspiration, strictly speaking, applies only to the autographic text of Scripture.\" However, even though there may be no extant original manuscripts of the Bible, those that exist can be considered inerrant, because, as the statement reads: \"The autographic text of Scripture, ... in the providence of God can be ascertained from available manuscripts with great accuracy.\"Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy: \"Article X. We affirm that inspiration, strictly speaking, applies only to the autographic text of Scripture, which in the providence of God can be ascertained from available manuscripts with great accuracy. We further affirm that copies and translations of Scripture are the Word of God to the extent that they faithfully represent the original. We deny that any essential element of the Christian faith is affected by the absence of the autographs. We further deny that this absence renders the assertion of biblical inerrancy invalid or irrelevant.\" The \"doctrine of the inerrancy of scripture\"Cardinal Augustin Bea, \"Vatican II and the Truth of Sacred Scripture\" held by the Catholic Church, as expressed by the Second Vatican Council, is that, \"The books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation.\" Inerrancy has been much more of an issue in American evangelicalism than in British evangelicalism. According to Stephen R. Holmes, it \"plays almost no role in British evangelical life\". A minority of biblical inerrantists go further than the Chicago Statement, arguing that the original text has been perfectly preserved and passed down through time. \"Textus Receptus onlyism\" holds that the Greek text of this name (Latin for received text) is a perfect and inspired copy of the original and supersedes earlier manuscript copies. The King James Only movement ascribes inerrancy only to the King James English translation made from the Textus Receptus. == Terms and opinions == The word inerrancy is formed from the word inerrant, from the Latin inerrantem, (being in- + errantem the present participle of err\u0101re to err or wander). It is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"That does not err; free from error; unerring.\"Oxford English Dictionary. Another word often used to characterize the Bible is \"infallible\". From dictionary definitions, Frame (2002) insists that this is a stronger term than \"inerrant\". \"'Inerrant' means there are no errors; 'infallible' means there can be no errors\".Frame, John M. \"Is the Bible Inerrant?\" IIIM Magazine Online, Volume 4, Number 19, May 13 to May 20, 2002 Yet he agrees that \"modern theologians insist on redefining that word also, so that it actually says less than 'inerrancy. Lindsell (1978) states that, \"The very nature of inspiration renders the Bible infallible, which means that it cannot deceive us. It is inerrant in that it is not false, mistaken, or defective\".Lindsell, Harold. The Battle for the Bible. Zondervan, 1978, p. 31. According to H. Chaim Schimmel, Judaism had never promulgated a belief in the literal word of the Hebrew Bible, hence the co-existence of the Oral Torah.Schimmel, H. Chaim, The Oral Law: The rabbinic contribution to Torah Shebe'al Peh, 2nd, revised ed., Feldheim Publishers, Jerusalem, 1996, pp. 19\u201321 Within Christianity, some mainstream Evangelical and Protestant groups adhere to the inerrancy of scripture as it reads today. However, some note that \"Evangelical scholars ... doubt that accepting the doctrine of biblical inerrancy is the best way to assert their belief in biblical authority\".Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, \"Evangelicalism\". The Catholic Church's view was authoritatively expressed by the Second Vatican Council, citing earlier declarations, in the following terms: \"Since everything asserted by the inspired authors or sacred writers must be held to be asserted by the Holy Spirit, it follows that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation.\"Second Vatican Council, Dei Verbum (Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation), 11 The Council added: \"Since God speaks in Sacred Scripture through men in human fashion, the interpreter of Sacred Scripture, in order to see clearly what God wanted to communicate to us, should carefully investigate what meaning the sacred writers really intended, and what God wanted to manifest by means of their words.\"Dei Verbum, 12 Some literalist or conservative Christians teach that the Bible lacks error in every way in all matters: chronology, history, biology, sociology, psychology, politics, physics, math, art, and so on. Other Christians believe that the scriptures are always right (do not err) only in fulfilling their primary purpose: revealing God, God's vision, God's purposes, and God's good news to humanity. Robinson, B.A. \"Inerrancy: Is the Bible free of error? All points of view\". Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, 2008-SEP-01. Web: 25 January 2010. Inerrancy: Is the Bible free of error?' Some Judaic and Christian traditions hold that the Torah or Pentateuch of the Hebrew Bible was physically written by Moses\u2014not by God himself, although in the process of transcription many thousands of times copyists have allowed errors, or (some suggest) even forgeries in the text to accumulate. Tov, Emanuel, Textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible, Uitgeverij Van Gorcum, 2001, p. 213 According to this position, God originally spoke through a select person to reveal his purpose, character and plan for humanity. However, the Bible does record some direct statements from God (i.e.,\"Thus says the Lord...\", \"And God said...\", etc.). The significance of most phrases, their parts, grammar, and occasionally individual words, letters and even pronunciation in the Hebrew Bible are the subject of many rabbinic discussions in the Talmud. == History == The first formulations of the doctrine of inerrancy had not been established according to the authority of a council, creed, or church, until the post-Reformation period.Hendel, Ronald. \"The Dream of a Perfect Text: Textual Criticism and Biblical Inerrancy in Early Modern Europe,\" in e.d. Collins, J.J., Sibyls, Scriptures, and Scrolls: John Collins at Seventy, Brill, 2017, 517-541, esp. 524-531. On pg. 529, Hendel writes \"The doctrine of uniform inerrancy in the literal sense across all details is an innovation of the Catholic-Protestant polemics after Trent.\" Origen of Alexandria thought there were minor discrepancies between the accounts of the Gospels but dismissed them due to their lack of theological importance, writing \"let these four [Gospels] agree with each other concerning certain things revealed to them by the Spirit and let them disagree a little concerning other things\" (Commentary on John 10.4). Later, John Chrysostom was also unconcerned with the notion that the scriptures were in congruence with all matters of history unimportant to matters of faith. > But if there be anything touching time or places, which they have related > differently, this nothing injures the truth of what they have said \u2026 [but > those things] which constitute our life and furnish out our doctrine nowhere > is any of them found to have disagreed, no not ever so little (Homily on > Matthew 1.6) In his Commentary on Galatians, Jerome also argued that Paul's rebuke of Peter in Galatians 2:11-14 for acting like a Jew around the Jewish faction of the early Church was an insincere \"white lie\" as Paul himself had done the same thing.Cohen, Shaye J.D. The beginnings of Jewishness: Boundaries, varieties, uncertainties. Vol. 31. University of California Press, 1999, 368. In response, Augustine rebuked Jerome's interpretation and affirmed that the scriptures contained no mistakes in them, and that admitting a single mistake would shed doubt on the entire scripture.Woodbridge, John. \u201cEvangelical Self- Identity and the Doctrine of Biblical Inerrancy, in Understanding the Times: New Testament Studies in the 21st Century: Essays in Honor of D. A. Carson on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday, Crossway, 2011, 111. > It seems to me that the most disastrous consequences must follow upon our > believing that anything false is found in the sacred books: that is to say > that the men by whom the Scripture has been given to us, and committed to > writing, did put down in these books anything false. . . . If you once admit > into such a high sanctuary of authority one false statement ... there will > not be left a single sentence of those books which, if appearing to any one > difficult in practice or hard to believe, may not by the same fatal rule be > explained away, as a statement in which, intentionally, . . . the author > declared what was not true (Letters of St Augustine 28.3). By the time of the Reformation, there was still no official doctrine of inerrancy. For Martin Luther (1483-1546), for example, \"inspiration did not insure inerrancy in all details. Luther recognizes mistakes and inconsistencies in Scripture and treated them with lofty indifference because they did not touch the heart of the Gospel.\"Bainton, \"The Bible in the Reformation,\" in e.d. Greenslade, S.L., The Cambridge History of the Bible Vol 3: The West from the Reformation to the Present, Cambridge University Press 1963, 12-13. When Matthew appears to confuse Jeremiah with Zechariah in Matt. 27:9, Luther wrote that \"Such points do not bother me particularly.\" The Christian humanist and one of the leading scholars of the northern Renaissance, Erasmus (1466-1536), was also unconcerned with minor errors not impacting theology, and at one point, thought that Matthew mistook one word for another. In a letter to Johannes Eck, Erasmus wrote that \u201cNor, in my view, would the authority of the whole of Scripture be instantly imperiled, as you suggest, if an evangelist by a slip of memory did put one name for another, Isaiah for instance instead of Jeremiah, for this is not a point on which anything turns.\u201d The same point of view held true for John Calvin (1509-1564), who wrote that \"It is well known that the Evangelists were not very concerned with observing the time sequences.\" The doctrine of inerrancy, however, began to develop as a response to these Protestant attitudes. Whereas the Council of Trent only held that the Bible's authority was \"in matters of faith and morales\", the Jesuit and cardinal Robert Bellarmine (1542-1621) argued in his 1586 De verbo Dei, the first volume of his multi-volume Disputationes de controversiis christianae fidei adversus hujus temporis haereticos that \"There can be no error in Scripture, whether it deals with faith or whether it deals with morals/mores, or whether it states something general and common to the whole Church, or something particular and pertaining to only one person.\" Bellarmine's views were extremely important in his condemnation of Galileo and Catholic-Protestant debate, as the Protestant response was to also affirm his heightened understanding of inerrancy. During the 18th and 19th centuries and in the aftermath of the Enlightenment critique of religion, various episodes of the Bible (for example the Noahide worldwide flood,Plimer, Ian (1994), Telling Lies for God: Reason vs Creationism, Random House the creation in six days, and the creation of women from a man's rib) began increasingly to be seen as legendary rather than as literally true. This led to further questioning of the veracity of biblical texts. According to an article in Theology Today published in 1975, \"There have been long periods in the history of the church when biblical inerrancy has not been a critical question. It has in fact been noted that only in the last two centuries can we legitimately speak of a formal doctrine of inerrancy. The arguments pro and con have filled many books, and almost anyone can join in the debate\". In the 1970s and 1980s, however, the debate in theological circles, which centered on the issue of whether or not the Bible was infallible or both infallible and inerrant, came into the spotlight. Some notable Christian seminaries, such as Princeton Theological Seminary and Fuller Theological Seminary, were formally adopting the doctrine of infallibility while rejecting the doctrine of inerrancy. Fuller, for instance, explains: > Where inerrancy refers to what the Holy Spirit is saying to the churches > through the biblical writers, we support its use. Where the focus switches > to an undue emphasis on matters like chronological details, precise sequence > of events, and numerical allusions, we would consider the term misleading > and inappropriate. The other side of this debate focused largely around the magazine Christianity Today and the book entitled The Battle for the Bible by Harold Lindsell.Lindsell, Harold. The Battle for the Bible. Zondervan, 1978. The author asserted that losing the doctrine of the inerrancy of scripture was the thread that would unravel the church and Conservative Christians rallied behind this idea. This was among the controversies during the Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence; ultimately the SBC adopted the position that the Bible is both inerrant and infallible as outlined in their 2000 edition of the Baptist Faith and Message. == Inerrancy in autographic texts and modern versions == Those who hold the inerrancy of the Bible do not all agree as to whether inerrancy refers to modern Bibles or only to the original, autographic texts. There are also disagreements about whether, because the autographic texts no longer survive, modern texts can be claimed to be inerrant.Cowan, SB. and Wilder, TL., In Defense of the Bible: A Comprehensive Apologetic for the Authority of Scripture, B&H; Publishing Group, 2013, p. 55. Article X of the Chicago statement agrees that the inspiration for the words of the Bible can only strictly be applied to the autographs. However, the same article asserts that the original text \"can be ascertained from available manuscripts with great accuracy\", so that the lack of the originals does not affect the claim of biblical inerrancy of such recovered, modern texts. Robert Saucy, for instance, reports that writers have argued that \"99 percent of the original words in the New Testament are recoverable with a high degree of certainty.\"Saucy, R., Scripture, Thomas Nelson Inc, 2001 == Textual tradition of the New Testament == There are over 5,600 Greek manuscripts containing all or part of the New Testament, as well as over 10,000 Latin manuscripts, and perhaps 500 other manuscripts of various other languages. Additionally, there are the Patristic writings, which contain copious quotes from across the early centuries of the scriptures. Most of these manuscripts date to the Middle Ages. The oldest complete copy of the New Testament, the Codex Sinaiticus, which includes two other booksThe Epistle of Barnabas and The Shepherd of Hermas not now included in the accepted NT canon, dates to the 4th century. The earliest fragment of a New Testament book is the Rylands Library Papyrus P52 which dates from 125\u2013175 AD, recent research pointing to a date nearer to 200 AD. It has the size of a business card. Very early manuscripts are rare. The average NT manuscript is about 200 pages, and in all, there are about 1.3 million pages of text. No two manuscripts are identical, except in the smallest fragments, and the many manuscripts that preserve New Testament texts differ among themselves in many respects, with some estimates of 200,000 to 300,000 differences among the various manuscripts.See Ehrman, Lost Christianities: The Battles for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew, p. 219 According to Bart Ehrman: In the 2008 Greer-Heard debate series, noted New Testament scholars Bart Ehrman and Daniel B. Wallace discussed these variances in detail. Wallace mentioned that understanding the meaning of the number of variances is not as simple as looking at the number of variances, but one must consider also the number of manuscripts, the types of errors, and among the more serious discrepancies, what impact they do or do not have. For hundreds of years, biblical and textual scholars have examined the manuscripts extensively. Since the eighteenth century, they have employed the techniques of textual criticism to reconstruct how the extant manuscripts of the New Testament texts might have descended, and to recover earlier recensions of the texts. However, King James Version (KJV)-only inerrantists often prefer the traditional texts (i.e., Textus Receptus, which is the basis of KJV) used in their churches to modern attempts of reconstruction (i.e., Nestle-Aland Greek Text, which is the basis of modern translations), arguing that the Holy Spirit is just as active in the preservation of the scriptures as in their creation.White, JR., The King James Only Controversy: Can You Trust Modern Translations?, Baker Books, 2009, p. 24. KJV-only inerrantist Jack Moorman says that at least 356 doctrinal passages are affected by the differences between the Textus Receptus and the Nestle-Aland Greek Text.Moorman, Jack, Missing In Modern Bibles \u2013 Is the Full Story Being Told?, Bible for Today, 1989, 83 pages Some familiar examples of Gospel passages in the Textus Receptus thought to have been added by later interpolaters and omitted in the Nestle Aland Greek Text include the Pericope Adulter\u00e6, the Comma Johanneum, and the longer ending in Mark 16. Many modern Bibles have footnotes to indicate areas where there is disagreement between source documents. Bible commentaries offer discussions of these.See e.g. The HCSB Student Bible, B&H; Publishing Group, 2007, p. iv. === Inerrantist response === ==== Evangelical inerrantists ==== Evangelical Christians generally accept the findings of textual criticism,Bacote, VE., Migu\u00e9lez, LC. and Okholm, DL., Evangelicals & Scripture: Tradition, Authority and Hermeneutics, InterVarsity Press, 2009. and nearly all modern translations, including the New Testament of the New International Version, are based on \"the widely accepted principles of ... textual criticism\".Today's new International Version: New Testament, Introduction. Since textual criticism suggests that the manuscript copies are not perfect, strict inerrancy is only applied to the original autographs (the manuscripts written by the original authors) rather than the copies. However, challenging this view, evangelical theologian Wayne Grudem writes: > For most practical purposes, then, the current published scholarly texts of > the Hebrew Old Testament and Greek New Testament are the same as the > original manuscripts. Thus, when we say that the original manuscripts were > inerrant, we are also implying that over 99 percent of the words in our > present manuscripts are also inerrant, for they are exact copies of the > originals. The \"Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy\" says, \"We affirm that inspiration, strictly speaking, applies only to the autographic text of Scripture\". However, it also reads: \"We deny that any essential element of the Christian faith is affected by the absence of the autographs. We further deny that this absence renders the assertion of biblical inerrancy invalid or irrelevant.\" Less commonly, more conservative views are held by some groups. ==== Textus Receptus ==== A minority of biblical inerrantists go further than the Chicago Statement, arguing that the original text has been perfectly preserved and passed down through time. This is sometimes called Textus Receptus Onlyism, as it is believed the Greek text by this name (Latin for received text) is a perfect and inspired copy of the original and supersedes earlier manuscript copies. This position is based on the idea that only the original language God spoke in is inspired, and that God was pleased to preserve that text throughout history by the hands of various scribes and copyists. Thus the Textus Receptus acts as the inerrant source text for translations to modern languages. For example, in Spanish-speaking cultures the commonly accepted \"KJV-equivalent\" is the Reina-Valera 1909 revision (with different groups accepting, in addition to the 1909 or in its place, the revisions of 1862 or 1960). The New King James Version was also translated from the Textus Receptus. ==== King James Only inerrantists ==== A faction of those in the \"King James Only movement\" rejects the whole discipline of textual criticism and holds that the translators of the King James Version English Bible were guided by God and that the KJV thus is to be taken as the authoritative English Bible. One of its most vocal, prominent and thorough proponents was Peter Ruckman, whose followers were generally known as Ruckmanites. He was generally considered to hold the most extreme form of this position. == Justifications == A number of reasons are offered by Christian theologians to justify biblical inerrancy. Norman Geisler and William Nix (1986) claim that scriptural inerrancy is established by a number of observations and processes, which include: :* The historical accuracy of the Bible :* The Bible's claims of its own inerrancy :* Church history and tradition :* One's individual experience with God Louis Markos wrote: > I feel great pity for Bart Ehrman. It appears that the kind of > fundamentalism in which the Christian believer turned biblical debunker was > raised did not prepare him for the challenges he would face in college. He > was taught, rightly, that there are no contradictions in the Bible, but he > was trained, quite falsely, to interpret the non-contradictory nature of the > Bible in modern, scientific, post-Enlightenment terms. That is to say, he > was encouraged to test the truth of the Bible against a verification system > that has only existed for some 250 years. Daniel B. Wallace, Professor of New Testament at Dallas Theological Seminary, divides the various evidences into two approaches: deductive and inductive approaches.My Take on Inerrancy, bible.org website === Deductive justifications === The first deductive justification is that the Bible claims to be inspired by God (for instance \"All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness\") and because God is perfect, the Bible must also be perfect and, hence, free from error. For instance, the statement of faith of the Evangelical Theological Society says, \"The Bible alone, and the Bible in its entirety, is the Word of God written and is therefore inerrant in the autographs\".About the ETS, Evangelical Theological Society web site Supportive of this is the idea that God cannot lie. W. J. Mcrea writes: > The Bible then makes two basic claims: it asserts unequivocally that God > cannot lie and that the Bible is the Word of God. It is primarily from a > combination of these facts that the argument for inerrancy comes.McRea, WJ, > A book to die for, Clements publishing, 2002. And Grenz has: > Because God cannot lie and because scripture is inspired by God, the Bible > must be wholly true. This syllogism may be valid for establishing inerrancy, > but it cannot define the concept.Grenz, SJ, Theology for the community of > God, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000 Also, from Geisler: > Those who defend inerrancy are deductivists pure and simple. They begin with > certain assumptions about God and the scriptures, namely, that God cannot > lie and the scriptures are the Word of God. From these assumptions, > inerrantists deduce that the Bible is without error. A second reason offered is that Jesus and the apostles used the Old Testament in a way that assumes it is inerrant. For instance, in , Paul bases his argument on the fact that the word \"seed\" in the Genesis reference to \"Abraham and his seed\" is singular rather than plural. This (as claimed) sets a precedent for inerrant interpretation down to the individual letters of the words.\"Bible, Inerrancy and Infallibility of\", by P. D. Feinberg, in Evangelical Dictionary of Theology (Baker, 1984, Ed. W. Elwell) Similarly, Jesus said that every minute detail of the Old Testament Law must be fulfilled, indicating (it is claimed) that every detail must be correct. Although in these verses, Jesus and the apostles are only referring to the Old Testament, the argument is considered by some to extend to the New Testament writings, because accords the status of scripture to New Testament writings also: \"He (Paul) writes the same way in all his letters...which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other scriptures\".Bible, Inspiration of , by Nigel M. de S. Cameron, in \"Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology\", Edited by Walter A. Elwell, Baker, 1996 === Inductive justifications === Wallace describes the inductive approach by enlisting the Presbyterian theologian Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield: > In his Inspiration and Authority of the Bible, Warfield lays out an argument > for inerrancy that has been virtually ignored by today's evangelicals. > Essentially, he makes a case for inerrancy on the basis of inductive > evidence, rather than deductive reasoning. Most evangelicals today follow E. > J. Young's deductive approach toward bibliology, forgetting the great > articulator of inerrancy. But Warfield starts with the evidence that the > Bible is a historical document, rather than with the presupposition that it > is inspired. ==== Inspiration ==== In the Nicene Creed Christians confess their belief that the Holy Spirit \"has spoken through the prophets\". This creed has been normative for Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Anglicans, Lutherans and all mainline Protestant denominations except for those descended from the non- credal Stone-Campbell movement. As noted by Alister E. McGrath, \"An important element in any discussion of the manner in which scripture is inspired, and the significance which is attached to this, is 2 Timothy 3:16\u201317, which speaks of scripture as 'God-breathed' (theopneustos)\". According to McGrath, \"the reformers did not see the issue of inspiration as linked with the absolute historical reliability or factual inerrancy of the biblical texts\". He says, \"The development of ideas of 'biblical infallibility' or 'inerrancy' within Protestantism can be traced to the United States in the middle of the nineteenth century\".McGrath, Alister E., Christian Theology: An Introduction, Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, 1994; 3rd ed. 2001. p. 176. People who believe in inerrancy think that the Bible does not merely contain the Word of God, but every word of it is, because of verbal inspiration, the direct, immediate word of God. , , , , , , , , , , The Lutheran Apology of the Augsburg Confession identifies Holy Scripture with the Word of God\"God's Word, or Holy Scripture\" from the Apology of the Augsburg Confession, Article II, of Original Sin and calls the Holy Spirit the author of the Bible.\"the Scripture of the Holy Ghost\". Apology to the Augsburg Confession, Preface, 9 Because of this, Lutherans confess in the Formula of Concord, \"we receive and embrace with our whole heart the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the pure, clear fountain of Israel\". Lutherans (and other Protestants) believe apocryphal books are neither inspired nor written by prophets, and that they contain errors and were never included in the \"Palestinian Canon\" that Jesus and the Apostles are said to have used,See BIBLE Bible, Canon in the Christian Cyclopedia and therefore are not a part of Holy Scripture. The prophetic and apostolic scriptures are authentic as written by the prophets and apostles. A correct translation of their writings is God's Word because it has the same meaning as the original Hebrew and Greek. A mistranslation is not God's word, and no human authority can invest it with divine authority. However, the 19th century Anglican biblical scholar S. R. Driver held a contrary view, saying that, \"as inspiration does not suppress the individuality of the biblical writers, so it does not altogether neutralise their human infirmities or confer upon them immunity from error\".Driver, S.R., Church Congress speech, cited in F.W. Farrar, The Bible: Its Meaning and Supremacy, Longmans, Green, and Co., 1897. Similarly, J. K. Mozley, an early 20th-century Anglican theologian has argued: ==== Divine authority ==== For a believer in biblical inerrancy, Holy Scripture is the Word of God, and carries the full authority of God. Every single statement of the Bible calls for instant and unqualified acceptance. Every doctrine of the Bible is the teaching of God and therefore requires full agreement. Every promise of the Bible calls for unshakable trust in its fulfillment. Every command of the Bible is the directive of God himself and therefore demands willing observance. ==== Sufficiency ==== According to some believers, the Bible contains everything that they need to know to obtain salvation and live a Christian life, , , , , and there are no deficiencies in scripture that need to be filled with tradition, pronouncements of the Pope, new revelations, or present-day development of doctrine., == Clarifications == === Accuracy === Harold Lindsell points out that it is a \"gross distortion\" to state that people who believe in inerrancy suppose every statement made in the Bible is true (as opposed to accurate).Lindsell, Harold. The Battle for the Bible, Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids, Michigan (1976), p. 38. He says there are expressly false statements in the Bible, but they are reported accurately. He notes that \"All the Bible does, for example in the case of Satan, is to report what Satan actually said. Whether what he said was true or false is another matter. Christ stated that the devil is a liar\". === Limitations === Many who believe in the inspiration of scripture teach that it is infallible but not inerrant. Those who subscribe to infallibility believe that what the scriptures say regarding matters of faith and Christian practice are wholly useful and true. Some denominations that teach infallibility hold that the historical or scientific details, which may be irrelevant to matters of faith and Christian practice, may contain errors. Those who believe in inerrancy hold that the scientific, geographic, and historic details of the scriptural texts in their original manuscripts are completely true and without error, though the scientific claims of scripture must be interpreted in the light of its phenomenological nature, not just with strict, clinical literality, which was foreign to historical narratives. Proponents of biblical inerrancy generally do not teach that the Bible was dictated directly by God, but that God used the \"distinctive personalities and literary styles of the writers\" of scripture and that God's inspiration guided them to flawlessly project his message through their own language and personality.\"Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy\", Article VIII Infallibility and inerrancy refer to the original texts of the Bible. Scholars who are proponents of biblical inerrancy acknowledge the potential for human error in transmission and translation, and therefore only affirm as the Word of God translations that \"faithfully represent the original\".\"Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy\", Article X (Archive) === Metaphor and literalism === Even if the bible is inerrant, it may need to be interpreted to distinguish between what statements are metaphorical, and which are literally true. Jeffrey Russell writes that \"Metaphor is a valid way to interpret reality. The 'literal' meaning of words \u2013 which I call the overt reading \u2013 is insufficient for understanding reality because it never exhausts reality.\" He adds: > Originating in Evangelicalism, the Fundamentalists affirmed that the Bible > is to be read \"literally\" or overtly, leading some to reject not only > physicalist evolution but even evolution science and to deny that life > developed over billions of years. Evangelicals tended to believe in the > \"inerrancy\" of the Bible (though they defined that term variously), a view > that sometimes could unhelpfully turn the Bible into an authority on science > and history. Russell, J.B., Paradise Mislaid: How We Lost Heaven \u2013 and How > We Can Regain It, Oxford University Press, 2006, pp. 14, 129. Also, figures such as Scot McKnight have argued that the Bible clearly transcends multiple genres and Hebrew prose poems cannot be evaluated by a reader the same as a science textbook. == Criticism == === Theological criticism === Proponents of biblical inerrancy often cite as evidence that scripture is inerrant. For this argument, they prefer translations that render the verse as \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God,\" and they interpret this to mean that the whole Bible must therefore be inerrant. However, critics of this doctrine think that the Bible makes no direct claim to be inerrant or infallible. C. H. Dodd argues the same sentence can also be translated \"Every inspired scripture is also useful\", nor does the verse define the Biblical canon to which \"scripture\" refers.Dodd, C. H. The Authority of the Bible, London, 1960. p. 25. In addition, Michael T. Griffith, the Mormon apologist, writes: > Nowhere within its pages does the Bible teach or logically imply the > doctrine of scriptural inerrancy. [Concerning] 2 Timothy 3:16 ... this > passage merely says that \"all scripture\" is profitable for doctrine, > reproof, etc. It says nothing about scripture being \"perfect\", or > \"inerrant\", or \"infallible\", or \"all-sufficient\". If anything, Paul's words > constitute a refutation of the idea of scriptural inerrancy ... What it does > say is that scripture is useful, profitable, for the needs of the pastoral > ministry. The only \"holy scriptures\" Timothy could have known from childhood > were the Hebrew scriptures, the Old Testament. And yet, would any Christian > assert that in Paul's view the Old Testament was the final and complete word > of God to man? Of course not. In any event, verse 15 makes it clear that in > speaking of \"all scripture\" Paul was referring to the Jewish scriptures and > perhaps to some of his own epistles.

Refuting the Critics: Evidences of the > Book of Mormon's Authenticity. Cedar Fort, 1993, p. 129. The Catholic New Jerusalem Bible also has a note that this passage refers only to the Old Testament writings understood to be scripture at the time it was written.New Jerusalem Bible, study edition, p. 1967, DLT 1994 Furthermore, the Catholic Veritas Bible website notes that \"Rather than characterizing the Old Testament scriptures as required reading, Paul is simply promoting them as something useful or advantageous to learn. ... it falls far short of a salvational requirement or theological system. Moreover, the four purposes (to teach, correct, etc.) for which scripture is declared to be 'profitable' are solely the functions of the ministry. After all, Paul is addressing one of his new bishops (the 'man of God'). Not a word addresses the use of scripture by the laity.\" Another note in the Bible suggests that there are indications that Paul's writings were being considered, at least by the author of the Second Epistle of Peter, as comparable to the Old Testament.New Jerusalem Bible, p. 2010, footnote (i) DLT 1985 The view that biblical inerrancy can be justified by an appeal to prooftexts that refer to its divine inspiration has been criticized as circular reasoning, because these statements are only considered to be true if the Bible is already thought to be inerrant. Holman Bible Editorial, \"If God Made the Universe, Who Made God?: 130 Arguments for Christian Faith\". B&H; Publishing Group, 2012, p. 51. In the introduction to his book Credible Christianity, Anglican Bishop Hugh Montefiore, comments: ==== Meaning of \"Word of God\" ==== Much debate over the kind of authority that should be accorded biblical texts centers on what is meant by the \"Word of God\". The term can refer to Christ himself as well as to the proclamation of his ministry as kerygma. However, biblical inerrancy differs from this orthodoxy in viewing the Word of God to mean the entire text of the Bible when interpreted didactically as God's teaching.James Barr, Fundamentalism pp. 72ff, SCM 1977. The idea of the Bible itself as Word of God, as being itself God's revelation, is criticized in neo-orthodoxy. Here the Bible is seen as a unique witness to the people and deeds that do make up the Word of God. However, it is a wholly human witness.James Barr, Fundamentalism pp. 218\u201319 SCM 1977 All books of the Bible were written by human beings. Thus, whether the Bible is\u2014in whole or in partExodus claims of the Ethical Decalogue and Ritual Decalogue that these are God's word.\u2014the Word of God is not clear. However, some argue that the Bible can still be construed as the \"Word of God\" in the sense that these authors' statements may have been representative of, and perhaps even directly influenced by, God's own knowledge.Brown, RE., The Critical Meaning of the Bible, Paulist Press, 1981. There is only one instance in the Bible where the phrase \"the Word of God\" refers to something written. The reference is to the Decalogue. However, most other references are to reported speech preserved in the Bible. The New Testament also contains a number of statements that refer to passages from the Old Testament as God's words, for instance (which says that the Jews have been \"entrusted with the very words of God\"), or the book of Hebrews, which often prefaces Old Testament quotations with words such as \"God says\". The Bible also contains words spoken by human beings about God, such as Eliphaz () and the prayers and songs of the Psalter. That these are God's words addressed to us was at the root of a lively medieval controversy.Uriel Simon, \"Four Approaches to the Book of Psalms\" chap. 1 The idea of the word of God is more that God is encountered in scripture, than that every line of scripture is a statement made by God.Alexander Ryrie, \"Deliver Us From Evil\", DLT 2004 While the phrase \"the Word of God\" is never applied to the modern Bible within the Bible itself, supporters of inerrancy argue that this is because the biblical canon was not closed. In , the apostle Paul wrote to the church in Thessalonica, \"When you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God.\"N\u00fcrnberger, K., Biblical Theology in Outline: The Vitality of the Word of God, Cluster Publications, 2004, p. 65. === Translation === Translation has given rise to a number of issues, as the original languages are often quite different in grammar as well as word meaning. Some believers trust their own translation to be the accurate one. One such group of believers is known as the King James Only movement. For readability, clarity, or other reasons, translators may choose different wording or sentence structure, and some translations may choose to paraphrase passages. Because some of the words in the original language have ambiguous or difficult to translate meanings, debates over the correct interpretation occur.See Encyclical Letter of 1893 quoted in Schwarz, W., Principles and Problems of Biblical Translation: Some Reformation Controversies and Their Background, CUP Archive, 1955, p. 11. Criticisms are also sometimes raised because of inconsistencies arising between different translations of the Hebrew or Greek text, as in the case of the virgin birth. ==== The virgin birth ==== One translation problem concerns the New Testament assertion that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin. If the Bible were inerrant, then this would be true. However, critics have suggested that the use of the word virgin may have been merely a translation error. reads: \"All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: 'The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel'\u2014which means, 'God with us'.\" Here Matthew quotes the prophet Isaiah, but the Septuagint, the Greek text of the Hebrew Bible he was using, was mistaken in its translation of the word almah (\"\u05e2\u05dc\u05de\u05d4\") in : > Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin > [(almah)] shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. On this point, Browning's A Dictionary of the Bible states that in the Septuagint (dated as early as the late 2nd century BCE), \"the Greek parthenos was used to translate the Hebrew almah, which means a 'young woman.Browning, WRF, A dictionary of the Bible, Oxford University Press, 2004. Entry for virgin birth. The dictionary also notes that \"the earliest writers of the [New Testament] (Mark and Paul) show no knowledge of such a virginal conception\". Furthermore, the Encyclopedia Judaica calls this \"a two-millennium misunderstanding of Isaiah 7:14\", which \"indicates nothing concerning the chastity of the woman in question\".Skolnik, F., Encyclopedia Judaica, 2nd Edition, 2006, Volume 20, p. 540. Another writer, David Strauss in The Life of Jesus, writes that the question \"ought to be decided by the fact that the word does not signify an immaculate, but a marriageable young woman\". He suggests that Isaiah was referring to events of his own time, and that the young woman in question may have been \"perhaps the prophet's own wife\".Strauss, D. F.
