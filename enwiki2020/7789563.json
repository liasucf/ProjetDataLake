It was released on June 28, 2007 as the album's third single. The group also recorded a Portuguese version of the song for Celestial (Vers\u00e3o Brasil) (2006). ==Background and release== The song was originally written by Chico Bennett and John Ingoldsby as \"Kiss Me Like You Mean It\", and recorded by American actress and singer Sara Paxton. RBD then covered it as \"B\u00e9same Sin Miedo\", with new lyrics in Spanish written by Carlos Lara. \"B\u00e9same Sin Miedo\" was released as the third single from Celestial. It went to Latin radio stations in early August 2007. The song was promoted even more than the group's previous single \"Celestial\" in the United States, with the group touring the country. The group premiered the song at the 2007 Premios Juventud in Miami, Florida. ==Chart performance== In the United States, \"B\u00e9same Sin Miedo\" peaked at position number eight on the Billboard Latin Pop Airplay chart and position number 30 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. ==Music video== The accompanying music video for \"B\u00e9same Sin Miedo\" was filmed in Transylvania, Romania while the group was touring in Europe. The video was filmed on June 13, 2007 at Bran Castle, better known as Dracula's Castle. The video was released on August 28, 2007 through OpenDisc and was officially released on August 29, 2007 on the group's website. The video begins with Anah\u00ed, Alfonso Herrera, Dulce Mar\u00eda, Christopher von Uckermann, Maite Perroni and Christian Ch\u00e1vez in a bus on their way to Dracula's Castle. While on the ride, Alfonso, Christopher and Christian pick up some girls and take them with them.

The video ends with Anah\u00ed getting bit by a vampire. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (2007) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"|US Hot Latin Songs (Billboard) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|30 |- ! scope=\"row\"|US Latin Pop Airplay (Billboard) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|8 |} ==References== Category:2007 singles Category:RBD songs Category:Spanish-language songs Category:Songs written by Chico Bennett Category:Songs written by Carlos Lara (songwriter) Category:2006 songs Category:EMI Records singles Category:Articles containing video clips ",
