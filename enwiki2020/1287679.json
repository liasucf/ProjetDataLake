    "text": "In physics, specifically field theory and particle physics, the Proca action describes a massive spin-1 field of mass m in Minkowski spacetime. The corresponding equation is a relativistic wave equation called the Proca equation.Particle Physics (2nd Edition), B.R. Martin, G. Shaw, Manchester Physics, John Wiley & Sons, 2008, The Proca action and equation are named after Romanian physicist Alexandru Proca. The Proca equation is involved in the Standard model and describes there the three massive vector bosons, i.e. the Z and W bosons. This article uses the (+\u2212\u2212\u2212) metric signature and tensor index notation in the language of 4-vectors. ==Lagrangian density== The field involved is a complex 4-potential B^\\mu = \\left (\\frac{\\phi}{c}, \\mathbf{A} \\right), where \\phi is a kind of generalized electric potential and \\mathbf{A} is a generalized magnetic potential. The field B^\\mu transforms like a complex four-vector. The Lagrangian density is given by:W. Greiner, \"Relativistic quantum mechanics\", Springer, p. 359, :\\mathcal{L}=-\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu B_ u^*-\\partial_ u B_\\mu^*)(\\partial^\\mu B^ u-\\partial^ u B^\\mu)+\\frac{m^2 c^2}{\\hbar^2}B_ u^* B^ u. where c is the speed of light in vacuum, \\hbar is the reduced Planck constant, and \\partial_{\\mu} is the 4-gradient. ==Equation== The Euler\u2013Lagrange equation of motion for this case, also called the Proca equation, is: :\\partial_\\mu(\\partial^\\mu B^ u - \\partial^ u B^\\mu)+\\left(\\frac{mc}{\\hbar}\\right)^2 B^ u=0 which is equivalent to the conjunction ofMcGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, :\\left[\\partial_\\mu \\partial^\\mu+ \\left(\\frac{mc}{\\hbar}\\right)^2\\right]B^ u=0 with (in the massive case) :\\partial_\\mu B^\\mu=0 \\\\! which may be called a generalized Lorenz gauge condition. When m = 0 , the equations reduce to Maxwell's equations without charge or current. The Proca equation is closely related to the Klein\u2013Gordon equation, because it is second order in space and time. In the vector calculus notation, the equations are: :\\Box \\phi - \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t} \\left(\\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + abla\\cdot\\mathbf{A}\\right) =-\\left(\\frac{mc}{\\hbar}\\right)^2\\phi \\\\! :\\Box \\mathbf{A} + abla \\left(\\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + abla\\cdot\\mathbf{A}\\right) =-\\left(\\frac{mc}{\\hbar}\\right)^2\\mathbf{A}\\\\! and \\Box is the D'Alembert operator. ==Gauge fixing== The Proca action is the gauge-fixed version of the Stueckelberg action via the Higgs mechanism. Quantizing the Proca action requires the use of second class constraints. If m eq 0, they are not invariant under the gauge transformations of electromagnetism :B^\\mu \\rightarrow B^\\mu - \\partial^\\mu f where f is an arbitrary function. ==See also== * Photon * Vector boson * Electromagnetic field * Quantum electrodynamics * Quantum gravity ==References== == Further reading == * Supersymmetry Demystified, P.
