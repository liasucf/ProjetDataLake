    "text": "\"Un baiser vol\u00e9\" (English translation: \"A Stolen Kiss\") was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1991, performed in French by Sarah Bray. The song is a plea for hope in the modern world, with Bray singing that something as simple as the titular \"stolen kiss\" can brighten a day. Bray also recorded an English-language version of the song, \"One Stolen Kiss\". The song was performed seventh on the night (following Austria's Thomas Forstner with \"Venedig im Regen\" and preceding Sweden's Carola with \"F\u00e5ngad av en stormvind\"). At the close of voting, it had received 29 points, placing 14th in a field of 22. It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1992 Contest by Marion Welter & Kontinent with \"Sou fr\u00e4i\". ==Sources and external links== * Official Eurovision Song Contest site, history by year, 1991 * Detailed info & lyrics, The Diggiloo Thrush, \"Un baiser vol\u00e9\".
