    "text": "Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Fran\u00e7ais (1814\u20131897), also known as Louis Fran\u00e7ais, was a French painter, lithographer and illustrator who became one of the most commercially successful landscape painters of the 19th century. A former pupil of Gigoux, he began his career by studying lithography and wood engraving, becoming a prolific illustrator and print-maker. His work as an illustrator is to be found in around forty books and numerous magazines from the late 1830s to the 1860s. Fran\u00e7ais also produced a large number of pen and ink drawings, enhanced by sepia, notable for their attention to detail and for their technical adroitness and conciseness.Laurence Pauchet-Warlop, Jane Turner (editor) (2000), The Grove Dictionary of Art, From Monet to C\u00e9zanne, Late 19th-century French Artists, Oxford University Press, New York, Fran\u00e7ais is associated with the Barbizon School of painting, a movement to represent art in nature in a Romantic, Realist context. In 1836 whilst at Barbizon he met the landscape painter Camille Corot and began a ten-year association as a friend and acolyte. Fran\u00e7ais's paintings possess some of the prominent features of the work of Corot in his use of tonal colours, loose brushwork and an emphasis on softness of form.W Craven (1994). American Art: History and Culture. New York: Harry N. Adams, Inc. p. 332. Fran\u00e7ais exhibited first at the Paris Salon in 1837 and regularly thereafter until his death in 1897. He lived from 1846 to 1849 in Italy, where he experimented with a brighter palette. His work developed neo-classical sentiments with mythical creatures appearing within a realist landscape. Whilst this bought him commercial success it alienated some critics who were harsh in their judgement of his work. A well respected and decorated artist within France, he was also internationally well-known during his lifetime exhibiting abroad in Geneva and London but following his death in 1897, his reputation declined and there are relatively few of his paintings on show in public galleries beyond France. ==Early years== Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Fran\u00e7ais was born in Plombi\u00e8res-les-Bains in the Vosges region on 17 November 1814. He was the son of Jean Fran\u00e7ais, a mercer and Marie-Anne Fran\u00e7ais (n\u00e9e Van\u00e7on). He showed aptitude in drawing from an early age and attended classes in Plombi\u00e8res. His family wished to encourage him and in 1829 found him a job in a bookshop in Paris where he could build up contacts with a view to becoming an illustrator. Initially he worked as a copyist, produced caricatures and drew models at the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse. In 1831 he began studying painting and his first known landscapes are from this period . It was a period of struggle during which he made a precarious living mainly by drawing on stone and designing woodcut vignettes for book illustration. The publishing firm of Paulin employed him and in 1833 offered Fran\u00e7ais the opportunity to illustrate some of the ornate letters in Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage's Histoire de Gil Blas de Santillane published in January 1835.Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage, illustrated by Jean Gigoux, contributer Charles Nodier, (1835), Histoire de Gil Blas de Santillane , Paulin The main illustrator of Lesage's work was Jean Gigoux, an eminent painter and illustrator and impressed by Fran\u00e7ais' potential he invited him to work at his Parisian atelier.Pierre Larousse (1817-1875), Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si\u00e8cle en 15 volumes article Louis Fran\u00e7ais == Illustrator and print- maker == Illustration from novel by George Sand, \"Le Diable \u00e0 Paris\". Paris, (1845) An early lithograph by Fran\u00e7ais As an illustrator Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Fran\u00e7ais had a long career, until 1860, during which he drew vignettes for numerous books and magazines. It was a lucrative occupation and allowed financial security whilst he simultaneously developed his painting techniques. His illustrations for a new edition of Bernardin's romantic novel Paul et Virginie in 1835 were recognised as a high watermark of romantic illustration and began a profitable and prolific collaboration with the engraver Tony Johannot, the culmination of which was around two hundred vignettes, including around fifty landscapes. Aim\u00e9 Gros (1902), Louis Fran\u00e7ais, Causeries et souvenirs par un de ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves He worked with his friends Henri Baron and C\u00e9lestin Nanteuil on illustrations for Les Artistes anciens et modernes. Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Fran\u00e7ais, Henri Baron and C\u00e9lestin Nanteuil (1848 - 62), Les Artistes anciens et modernes, 3 vols Paris Together they founded the revue Les artistes contemporains and worked in collaboration on numerous engravings for the publishing firm Bertauts, often using the monogram B.N.F. to identify their ownership.Bertauts @ the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France A noteworthy commission were the illustrations in L'abb\u00e9 Jean-Jacques Bourass\u00e9's La Touraine. Histoire et monuments Jean-Jacques Bourass\u00e9 (1855), La Touraine. Histoire et monuments, Alfred Mame et Cie , Tours where Fran\u00e7ais provided forty wood engravings, five engraved plates and eleven beautiful ornate letters, for which he and his collaborator Karl Girardet, earned a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle in 1855.B.M. Ratcliffe \"Paris 1855\", Findling, Pelle, Kimberley (eds), Encyclopedia of World's Fairs and Expositions. McFarland & Company, Inc. Amongst the many prints that he supervised were those done after Corot's landscape, Sunset (1840), Diaz's Bathers (1847) and several of his own paintings. Many prints were reused, for example, Un Chemin (A Road) was first published in Paris by Augustin Challamel for the Paris salon of 1842. Ten years later a second state was published by Marchant for the series, Les Peintres vivants . Un Chemin (A Road) http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/francais_louis_un_chemin.htm ==Painting career== Les peintres au Vaux-de-Cernay, (1870) In 1834 Fran\u00e7ais went to live at Barbizon and painted in the nearby Forest of Fontainbleu. He was part of the Barbizon school of artists dedicated to painting directly from nature, often en plein air, who settled in the area around the Auberge Ganne Inn. In a radical departure from formalism in art, nature itself became the subject of the painting. Colta Ives, Elizabeth E. Barker (2000), Romanticism and the School of Nature: Nineteenth-Century Drawings and Paintings from the Karen B. Cohen Collection, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York as many artists met at the Inn to discuss ideas and to set forth to paint in the Forest. Fran\u00e7ais met and befriended fellow artist Louis Cabat and in 1836 he became acquainted with Camille Corot, eighteen years older than Fran\u00e7ais and with whom he formed a strong personal bond of friendship and as a personal adviser, who was willing to offer technical advice and to introduce Fran\u00e7ais to some influential people. Under Corot\u2019s influence Fran\u00e7ais developed a style of landscape painting using tonal colours to express light that are reminiscent of Corot. Fran\u00e7ais was never able to capture Corot\u2019s delicacy at depicting the human form but he developed exponentially into a fine landscape painter, albeit one that maintained an element of formalism. This formality was not surprising from a student of Gigoux but Fran\u00e7ais is known to have studied and admired the work of the early baroque painter Claude Lorrain\u2019s work at The Louvre. The occasional use of neo-classical subjects and the placing of mythological figures within the landscape that Fran\u00e7ais sometimes adopted bear a resemblance to the oeuvre of Lorrain. P. Miquel (1975) Le Paysage Fran\u00e7ais ay XIXe si\u00e8cle 1824 \u2013 1874 : L\u2019Ecole de la Nature, iii (Maurs-la-Jolie) Les H\u00eatres de la c\u00f4te de Gr\u00e2ce pr\u00e8s de Honfleur (1859). In 1837 Fran\u00e7ais exhibited at the Salon for the first time, presenting Sous les saules (Under the Willows) (1837: Tours museum), a painting where the figures are by Henri Baron. The exhibition catalogue listed 2,130 entries but Fran\u00e7ais' painting was noticed and commented upon favourably.https://sites.google.com/a/plu.edu/paris-salon- exhibitions-1667-1880/salon-de-1837 Information on 1837 Paris Salon In the mid-1840s, Fran\u00e7ais travelled regularly with Baron and their friend Nanteuil, to Bougival, a village on the Seine increasingly famous for its scenery and light changes.In the mid-19th century, Bougival was connected by the railway and quickly emerged as a fashionable suburb of Paris, where artists and writers who included Turgenev, who died in Bougival in 1883 lived and worked. Artists including Renoir, Monet, Morisot and Sisley painted in the area which has since become known as the Cradle of Impressionism. The paintings from this period, several of which were transposed to lithographs, are often signed Fran\u00e7ais, El\u00e8ves de Bougival (Student of Bougival). Soleil couchant (1845, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Dijon ), an autumnal landscape of the river at Bougival, was presented at the 1845 Salon of Charles Baudelaire, one of three that the poet organised. Baudelaire praised the canvas, as an example, of how to capture the poetic realism of nature. Charles Baudelaire, Salon of 1845. Critical edition with introduction, notes and explanations by Andr\u00e9 Ferran, Toulouse: \u00c9ditions de l'Archer, (1933) In 1846 Fran\u00e7ais travelled to Italy for the first time staying in various locations: Rome (1846/9), Genoa (1846), Pisa (1846), Florence (1846/7), Frascati (1847), Ariccia (1848) and Tivoli (1848/49). This extended sojourn enabled Fran\u00e7ais to develop his style. His palette became more luminous and he began to paint in the closely set strokes that would be a feature of his later work. he acquired a passion for painting the light and would return to Italy throughout his career. He accumulated numerous drawings, sketches and watercolours often in gouache which enabled him to execute some of his best known canvases from the period that included Fontaine \u00e0 Ariccia (Fountain at Ariccia) (1848, Paris Mus d \u2018Orsay). Returning to France he travelled and painted extensively throughout France in the 1850s. He regularly visited Plombi\u00e8res and the Loire valley, where he favoured realistic forest landscapes and riverbanks scenes. Fran\u00e7ois-Louis Fran\u00e7ais, Plombi\u00e8res-les-Bains, 1814-1897 : Illustrateur romantique (exh.cat., by R.Conilleau) Fran\u00e7ais was often in the company of other artists during these visits and with Corot, Courbet, Jongkind and the locally born Boudin, he was part of \u00e9cole de Honfleur (Honfleur school) that was drawn to paint the light and landscapes around Honfleur in Normandy. The images created during this interlude, by Fran\u00e7ais and his fellow artists, later inspired Jongkind and Claude Monet to open the Impressionist School of St. Simeon at Honfleur in 1862. Sylvie Patin (2014), Jongkind, Fascination pour la Lumiere , Des Falaises, France Les H\u00eatres de la c\u00f4te de Gr\u00e2ce pr\u00e8s de Honfleur (1859) is a fine example of his work in Normandy in the 1850s. It features a weathered tree distorted by the coastal winds that buffet the coast. As always with Fran\u00e7ais there is precision in the detail. Much of the painting features a forbidding sky that pays debt to Fran\u00e7ais' knowledge of Constable.http://musba-bordeaux.opacweb.fr/fr/search- notice/detail/vdce2ka29w78hc1lxfpbibqfwrhtcorjofe1uqezxoxftwa1vj ==Career after 1860== Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9 oil painting.

He had a regular income, not least from his patron the Alsatian industrialist Alfred Hartmann, the younger brother of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Hartmann, Th\u00e9odore Rousseau\u2019s long-suffering and most important patron of the Second Empire. https://www.19thc- artworldwide.org/55-spring09/spring09article/64-new-discoveries-theodore- rousseaus-view-of-mont-blanc-seen-from-la-faucille contains information on the Hartmann brothers as patrons.His paintings were invariably accepted at the Parisian salons. They were not always well received by some critics. His painting, Bois sacr\u00e9, (Sacred wood) (1864), now at the Lille, Palais des Beaux-Arts was heavily criticised, as not up to standard by some observers, who objected to the admittedly dominant, mythical figures at the centre of a realist canvas. http://www.artnet.fr/artistes/fran%C3%A7ois-louis- fran%C3%A7ais/le-bois-sacr%C3%A9-gUl26X-8HpjSDCVGcAKaUw2 le Bois sacr\u00e9, (Sacred wood) His patron Hartmann didn\u2019t like it either, as he made clear in a letter to Rousseau.letter from Hartman to Rousseau, 17 April 1864: Paris Louvre, Cab Dessins Le Bois sacr\u00e9 was one of a series of popular realism landscapes containing neo-classical themes that Fran\u00e7ais produced in the 1860s, often produced from sketches made following an Italian visit such as that to Naples in 1859 and to Pompeii in 1864-5. He continued to travel extensively throughout his life and in common with many well-off French people would spend his winters in warmer southern climes, after 1873 in Nice, often with his companion Rose Maireau, an engraver who exhibited her work at Petit Palais shortly after it opened in 1900. https://www.parismuseescollections.paris.fr/fr/petit-palais/oeuvres/la- fontaine-medicis#infos-principales Rose Maireau (Etroeungt), La fontaine Medicins c 1908 In 1878, after six years of intermittent work he completed a series of decorative panels for the font of the new Second Empire church of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Parishttps://www.patrimoine- histoire.fr/Patrimoine/Paris/Paris-La-Sainte-Trinite.htm Interior of Sainte- Trinit\u00e9 (French) The avowed socialism of Fran\u00e7ais\u2019 youth had receded to that of patriarch of the Third Republic. Also in 1878 Le Mont Cervin et Le Lac de N\u00e9mi (The Matterhorn and the Lake of N\u00e9mi) was awarded the M\u00e9daille d'honneur at the Paris Salon. A year after in 1879 Fran\u00e7ais was a founding member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'aquarellistes fran\u00e7ais (Society of French Watercolourists), the aim of which was to exhibit the watercolour paintings of the members, initially limited to just forty. The Society ceased in 1896. http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb131724839/PUBLIC Notice d'autorit\u00e9 collectivit\u00e9: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'aquarellistes fran\u00e7ais] (in French). Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France. At the 1884 Salon, he exhibited L'\u00c9tang de Clisson (Forest of Clisson) following a visit to the Loire valley. An evocation of the upper Loire, the preparatory drawings for which are at the Metropolitan Museum, https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/622939 the finished canvas has a freshness and a poetic naturalism reminiscent of Fran\u00e7ais\u2019 work in the 1850s. One of his most successful later paintings is Vue d'Antibes (1894) where he returned with some effect to the landscapes and skies of Corot and Millet. Fran\u00e7ais entered his final decade as a man with a considerable artistic reputation. In 1890 he was the first landscape artist to be elected to the Chair of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, the same year he won the M\u00e9daille d'honneur at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais where he exhibited two landscapes. He had international recognition which eluded many French artists. He exhibited at Geneva in 1857, 1858 and 1861 and in London in 1862 and 1874. Following his death a rather grand memorial was erected to his memory at Plombi\u00e8res-les-Bains.
