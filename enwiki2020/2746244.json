According to the Puranas, Vatsa was named after a K\u0101\u015b\u012b king.Pargiter, F.E. (1972) Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Motilal Banarasidass, Delhi, pp.269-70 The Ramayana and the Mahabharata attribute the founding of its capital' Kau\u015b\u0101mb\u012b, to a Chedi prince (Ku\u015ba or Ku\u015b\u0101mba). The Puranas state that after Hastinapur was washed away by the Ganges, the Bharata king Nicak\u1e63u (great-great grandson of Janamejaya), abandoned the city and settled in Kau\u015b\u0101mb\u012b. This is supported by the and the , attributed to Bh\u0101sa. Both described the king, Udayana, as a scion of the Bh\u0101rata family ().
