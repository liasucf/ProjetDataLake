    "text": "The Victoria Road siren in Avonmouth, a Federal Signal Modulator The Severnside Sirens are a system of Civil defense sirens located along the South Severn Estuary coastline from Redcliffe Bay to Pilning, northwest of Bristol. They are activated by Avon and Somerset Police in the event of a potential incident at one of the COMAH sites located in the area, mainly in and near Avonmouth. The system was setup in 1997 following a fire at the Albright and Wilson site in 1996. == Severnside Sirens Trust == Severnside Sirens Trust Limited is the organisation responsible for maintaining the system. It is a registered company (number 3348008) and charity (number 1063224) and was incorporated on 9 April 1997. The trust's activities are funded by the 3 local authorities whose constituents the sirens serve, North Somerset Council, Bristol City Council, and South Gloucestershire Council, and from donations from the organisations running the COMAH sites themselves. == Sirens == The directional siren in Lamplighters Marsh, Shirehampton. The antenna used to receive control signals is clearly visible. The sirens themselves are mounted on dedicated poles and all but one are manufactured by the Federal Signal Corporation.
