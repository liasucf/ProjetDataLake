    "text": "In mathematics, Fr\u00f6licher spaces extend the notions of calculus and smooth manifolds. They were introduced in 1982 by the mathematician Alfred Fr\u00f6licher. ==Definition== A Fr\u00f6licher space consists of a non-empty set X together with a subset C of Hom(R, X) called the set of smooth curves, and a subset F of Hom(X, R) called the set of smooth real functions, such that for each real function :f : X -> R in F and each curve :c : R -> X in C, the following axioms are satisfied: # f in F if and only if for each \u03b3 in C, f . \u03b3 in C\u221e(R, R) # c in C if and only if for each \u03c6 in F, \u03c6 . c in C\u221e(R, R) Let A and B be two Fr\u00f6licher spaces. A map :m : A -> B is called smooth if for each smooth curve c in CA, m.c is in CB. Furthermore, the space of all such smooth maps has itself the structure of a Fr\u00f6licher space. The smooth functions on '' :C\u221e(A, B) are the images of :S : F_B \\times C_A \\times \\mathrm{C}^{\\infty}(\\mathbf{R}, \\mathbf{R})' \\to \\mathrm{Mor}(\\mathrm{C}^{\\infty}(A, B), \\mathbf{R}) : (f, c, \\lambda) \\mapsto S(f, c, \\lambda), \\quad S(f, c, \\lambda)(m) := \\lambda(f \\circ m \\circ c) == References == * , section 23 Category:Smooth functions Category:Structures on manifolds ",
