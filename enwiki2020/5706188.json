    "text": "Michael Hasselmo is a neuroscientist at Boston University. He is known for his work on neuromodulators, particularly acetylcholine, and for his computational modelling work on the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, especially regarding the functional role of theta rhythm. He is on the editorial board of a number of scientific journals, including Science, Hippocampus, Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, and Behavioral Neuroscience. Father of two children, Hasselmo lives and works in Boston. == Selected references == *Brandon, M.P., Bogaard, A.R., Libby, C.P., Connerney, M.A., Gupta, K., Hasselmo, M.E.
