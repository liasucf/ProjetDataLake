Accessed May 5, 2020. \"Having grown up in River Vale, N.J., she was certainly familiar with schools like Boston College and Boston University. In fact, Boston College\u2014which was just a three-hour drive away from the Ammermans\u2019 home in New Jersey\u2014was one of Brooke\u2019s final three choices.\" In the absence of interscholastic high school leagues for girls, she briefly played on the boys ice hockey team at Pascack Valley High School.Rosen, Dan. \"Breaking the Ice\", copy of article from The Record, March 4, 2005. Accessed May 6, 2020. \"The skating didn't give the truth away, the motion was fluid, compact and strong. A freshman wasn't supposed to handle the puck with such flair either. At only 14 years old and enlarged by layers of pads, the 5-foot-7 player looked like everyone else on the ice. But when Brooke Ammerman, playing her first varsity game for Pascack Valley in December, was about to break into the clear for a glorious scoring opportunity, the defenseman did what he needed to do to avoid being beaten.... Without a girls varsity league in New Jersey, the other dozen or so females competing in North Jersey high school hockey continue to play with and against boys because they enjoy the challenge.\" Reimer played four seasons with the Wisconsin Badgers, 2008\u20132012, and scored 214 points in 152 games in that period.
