    "text": "Hurlers Cross () is a small village in County Clare, Ireland. It is situated close to Shannon Town and from both Sixmilebridge and Newmarket-on-Fergus. It forms a part of Newmarket-on-Fergus parish. == Etymology == The name is derived from the meeting of three roads: one to Ennis (and later Shannon), one to Limerick and one to Sixmilebridge. The last named is now closed off at the western end of the village, following the opening of a dual-carriageway bypass (N18/N19) serving the Limerick to Ennis route, which has taken away the heavy traffic that was once a feature of Hurlers Cross. ==See also== * List of towns and villages in Ireland ==References== Category:Towns and villages in County Clare ",
