During his first series, he broke his foot during a recording of the show by falling down the stairs as he made his entrance to the studio floor. The incident was edited out but was shown in a later show to explain why he was in a cast and on crutches. He continued to present his first series of Catchphrase while his foot healed, wearing a cast throughout many episodes of the show. Despite his unpopularity with viewers at the time, he succeeded in the mission of markedly improving the ratings of Series 14 and 15 in comparison to Walker's last series. Between December 2001 and January 2002, he appeared in the play Aladdin as the character of the same name in the Hexagon in Reading, Berkshire. He presented Catchphrase until 2002, although he recorded a third series in late 2001 and was shown on the ITV network between late 2002 and early 2004 usually during a quiet period on a Sunday teatime or Bank Holiday Monday. Following which, the show moved to daytime and former Blue Peter presenter Mark Curry hosted the show for the 2002 series.

In fact, it's so impressive to me that we have a production facility here in Hollywood, and every time it does its studio run \u2014 they do a run-through before they ship out to the ship \u2014 I get in my car and go up and watch it.
