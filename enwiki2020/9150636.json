    "text": "Joeano Pinto Chaves (born 12 August 1979), known simply as Joeano, is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a striker. ==Club career== Born in Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1, Joeano moved to Portugal, where he would remain for the majority of his career, at the age of 20, signing with amateurs C.D. Arrifanense from local Fortaleza Esporte Clube. In the 2002\u201303 season he scored 29 goals with third division club A.D. Sanjoanense, helping his team rank ninth and attracting the attention of UD Salamanca of the Spanish second level. In the 2004 January transfer window, however, Joeano returned to Portugal and signed for Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra, netting six times in only 13 games to help the side avoid relegation from the Primeira Liga. In summer 2006, after having scored 12 goals for the Students in his second full campaign, he joined Beitar Jerusalem F.C. in Israel. After failing to meet expectations at the Teddy Kollek Memorial Stadium, Joeano returned to his previous club in January 2007, on loan, with Acad\u00e9mica also agreeing to pay half of his salary. On 4 February he played his first league match, coming on as a 32nd-minute substitute and scoring the only goal of the away fixture against Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Naval 1\u00ba de Maio with eight to go. Joeano played two seasons in Cyprus with Ermis Aradippou FC, netting a career-best in the professionals 22 goals in 2009\u201310 (a competition joint-best). In the 2011 offseason, after the team's relegation from the First Division, he returned to Portugal and signed for F.C. Arouca in the second tier. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Fortaleza Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Fortaleza Esporte Clube players Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:A.D.
