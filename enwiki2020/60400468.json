    "text": "Richard Lee Moore (born January 14, 1971) is an American former teacher and politician. He was elected twice to the North Carolina House of Representatives, where he chaired the Committee on Aging and Education Subcommittee on Pre-School, Elementary and Secondary Education, before resigning in 2000 following his indictment on sex crime charges. Moore succeeded Robin Hayes, who was the Republican nominee for Governor in 1996, and he won reelection two years later. He voluntarily resigned his position at A.L. Brown High School and surrendered his teaching license following an abuse claim against him involving a 16-year old former student. Leonard B. Sossamon Jr. was appointed to succeed Moore when he resigned from the House months later. ==References== ==External links== *Profile at Vote Smart Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Duke University alumni Category:People from Kannapolis, North Carolina Category:Members of the North Carolina House of Representatives Category:North Carolina Democrats Category:North Carolina politicians convicted of crimes Category:Politicians convicted of sex offences Category:21st-century American politicians Category:20th-century American politicians ",
