UTEP topped the team standings, the Miners' first indoor team title. ==Qualification== Unlike other NCAA-sponsored sports, there were not separate NCAA Division I, Division II, and Division III championships for indoor track and field until 1985. As such, all athletes and programs from all three divisions were eligible to compete. == Team standings == * Note: Top 10 only * Scoring: 6 points for a 1st-place finish, 4 points for 2nd, 3 points for 3rd, 2 points for 4th, and 1 point for 5th * (DC) = Defending Champions * Full results {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Rank !
