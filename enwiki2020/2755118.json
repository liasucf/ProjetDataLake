He is of Spanish and native Chamorro descent. As a young child during World War II, he endured the horrors of the Manenggon Concentration Camp, and alongside his mother and other captive Chamorros he was among those who were rescued by American soldiers during the liberation of Guam.Katherine Aguon and Antonio M. Palomo. The Man from Tomorrow: a biography of Carl T.C. Gutierrez. New Century Forum, Inc. Chicago, 1998. When Gutierrez was a boy his father (unable to work due to an injury suffered as a teenager) and his mother had a difficult time raising such a large family. Carl attended Agana Heights Elementary School and George Washington High School. When a friend (commander of the Navy drydock) offered to help Gutierrez finish high school on the U.S. mainland, Gutierrez took advantage of the opportunity. However, less than four months after leaving Guam, his father died. He graduated from South San Francisco High School in California in 1960. Gutierrez enlisted in the U.S. Air Force on the day he graduated from high school. Explaining why he chose to join the U.S. Air Force, Carl Gutierrez later said, \"For me, it was a means to get an education. After learning what I could in the computer field, I wanted to come home where my roots are.\" Stationed in New Mexico, following Typhoon Karen in November 1962, Gutierrez was assigned to Andersen Air Force Base, so he could help his mother and brothers and sisters in the aftermath of the typhoon. Gutierrez married Geraldine Chance \u201cGeri\u201d Torres, on September 7, 1963 after a 6-month courtship. Gutierrez and Geri are practicing Roman Catholics, involved in many church organizations and activities. They have three children, Carla, Tommy and Hannah, and four grandchildren, Lily, Livia, Seth and Liam. Following his tour in the Air Force from 1960 to 1965, Gutierrez entered into the business world, eventually forming CarlTom Construction Company. Gutierrez spent nearly eight years as a government of Guam data processing manager. ==Political career before the Gutierrez-Bordallo Administration== Carl Gutierrez became interested in the world of politics and assisted former Democratic senators Ricardo J. \u201cRicky\u201d Bordallo and Richard F. Taitano in 1969 gearing up for the 1970 first election for the office of Governor of Guam. Eventually Ricky, Dick Taitano and sister Evelyn and others urged him to run for senator in the 1972 election. Gutierrez was elected in 1972. ===Senator in the 12th, 13th, and 14th Guam Legislatures=== Carl T.C. Gutierrez first ran for the Guam Legislature in 1972.

A constitution was drafted and approved by US President Jimmy Carter and the U.S. Congress but was later not ratified by Guam in a 1979 special election. ===Gutierrez-Dizon Gubernatorial Ticket (1978)=== In 1978, Carl Gutierrez ran for the office of governor as an independent, with Dr. Joseph Dizon, a Republican, as his running mate. In the primary, the ticket received 762 votes, insufficient to be included in the General Election.Guam Election Commission. Election Comparative Analysis Report 1978, Hagatna, 1979. Gutierrez served as advisor to Palau's Constitutional Convention in 1979 and was later made an honorary citizen of Palau by legislation. He co-sponsored legislation creating the APIL, association of Pacific Island legislatures. He was elected to three terms as their president. ===Senator in the 16th, 17th, and 18th Guam Legislatures=== In 1980, Gutierrez won a seat back and returned to the Legislature in 1981. He successfully unseated an incumbent Republican Senator in his district. Four years after the senatorial districting plan for Guam was put in place in 1978, the courts ruled in early 1982 that it violated the principle of \u201cone man, one vote\u201d. As a result, the 1982 election was an \"at-large\" election and Gutierrez and the Democrats regained the Legislature gaining a super majority ( 14 of 21 seats ) and he was elected Speaker of the Legislature for two terms. ===Gutierrez-Aguon Gubernatorial Ticket (1986)=== In 1986, Gutierrez ran for Governor against incumbent Governor Ricardo J.

Reyes and Gloria B. Nelson. The Gutierrez-Bordallo team received 9,555 votes while the Reyes-Nelson team received only 6,450 votes.Guam Election Commission. Election Comparative Analysis Report 1994. Hagatna, 1995. In the 1994 General Election, the Democratic team of Gutierrez-Bordallo faced the Republican team of Thomas V.C. Tanaka and Doris Flores Brooks.

Gutierrez focused his work in the areas of infrastructure so that all the marginalized people will be brought into the 20th century before it went out and also pushing for economic development by aggressively completing 85% of his Vision 2001 plan by the end of 1999. Despite a super majority Republican Legislature that opposed virtually every executive initiative, the Gutierrez-Bordallo administration was successful in guiding the island through the rough waters of economic downturns throughout the region. The tourism economy was also severely affected by the crash of Korean Airlines Flight 801 on August 6, 1997. During the rescue efforts, Gutierrez was one of the first responders and the first to reach the burning plane along with Dep. Fire Chief Chuck Sanchez and his security police officer Cecil Sulla. Gutierrez was credited with saving several lives, including 11-year-old Rika Matsuda \"Korean Air Survivor - Rika's Miracle ,\" Government of Guam and Barry Small, an injured helicopter mechanic from New Zealand, who called Governor Gutierrez a \"Hero.\" Gutierrez received the Eagle Award, the highest award given to a civilian by the U.S. National Guard Bureau. He was recognized by the governments of Japan and the Republic of Korea. In December 1997, Typhoon Paka struck Guam. The strong winds from Paka left around 1,500 buildings destroyed on the island, of which 1,160 were single-family homes. A further 10,000 buildings sustained damage to some degree, with 60% of the homes on the island reporting major damage. In all, about 5,000 people were left homeless due to the typhoon. Additionally, an estimated 30\u201340% of the public buildings received major damage. Buildings on the island made of reinforced concerted fared well, as opposed to light metal-frame structures, which more often were completely destroyed. Large tourist hotels near Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a, on which Guam is dependent, received generally minor damage, such as broken windows and damaged power generators. A complete island-wide power outage followed the typhoon; damage to the main electrical transmission and distribution system was estimated at . Following the passage of the typhoon, 25% of the homes on Guam were left without water. Telephone service remained working after the storm, due to most lines being underground. Strong waves washed away a few coastal roads in the northern portion of the island, leaving them temporarily closed. The waves surpassed the seawall at Apra Harbor, damaging the road and infrastructure of the seaport; many boats were washed ashore after breaking from their moorings. Strong winds damaged a radar system and lights along the runway of the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport, though most airport facilities received light damage. The Andersen Air Force Base also sustained heavy damage, with hundreds of downed trees and many facilities left damaged. Across Guam, damage was estimated at . About 100 people were injured, but the typhoon caused no deaths on the island. In 1998, Governor Carl Gutierrez ran for reelection with Lieutenant Governor Madeleine Z. Bordallo. There were two Democratic teams that challenged the Gutierrez- Bordallo team in the primary. Senator Thomas C. Ada and Senator Lou A. Leon Guerrero ran as a team, as did Senator Angel L.G. Santos and Jose \"Pedo\" T. Terlaje.

In the 1998 Gubernatorial election against former governor Joe Ada, an election challenge by Ada/Camacho went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision by the Supreme court was 9-0 in favor of Gutierrez/Bordallo, thus ending the Republican challenge. Just following the reelection of Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez and Madeleine Z. Bordallo, President William Jefferson Clinton visited Guam on November 23, 1998.Clinton Library. President Clinton's Visit to Guam The visit was the first since 1986 when a sitting U.S. president had visited Guam. Thousands of Guamanians gathered on the field in front of the Ricardo J. Bordallo Governor's Complex to see President Clinton. The crowd was treated to a rousing rendition of the Star Spangled Banner by Joseph \"Uncle Tote\" Cunningham and several speakers addressed the assembled crowd.Zita Y. Taitano.

Hagatna, 13 July 2012. ===Second Gutierrez-Bordallo Administration=== Gutierrez/Bordallo Gutierrez's credibility and integrity have been under constant attack by those who oppose him and his style of leadership. Beginning when he was still in office, efforts are continuing to try to find him guilty of purported crimes. He has never been found guilty of any crime, winning all cases that went to trial. Other cases were thrown out of court because they had no merit. His second term in office was marked by political instability caused by the 1998 election challenges, a super majority Republican (12-3) Guam Legislature, an unsuccessful Recall Movement in 2000 after the Supreme court decision came out giving Gutierrez/Bordallo the win, the \"rolling\" power outages left behind by the Ada/Blas administration, the destruction of the island's infrastructure by Supertyphoons Chata'an, Paka, and Pongsona. ==Public life after the Gutierrez- Bordallo Administration (2003-present)== ===Gutierrez-Cruz Gubernatorial Ticket (2006)=== Former Governor Carl T.C.
