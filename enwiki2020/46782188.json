It is the woman's wing of the Popular Front of India, an extremist and militant Islamic fundamentalist organisation in India. In the view of the NWF, \"the world's largest democracy still has women marginalized and oppressed\". == Background == The status of Indian women is progressing towards gender equality, but women continue to encounter patriarchal standards. Despite the steps towards gender equality, women still face abuse from society. India has a high rate of rapes, while physical assault and acid attacks are on the rise as well. The National Women's Front was founded with the hope of empowering women in the fight for justice and equality. ===History of the organization=== Although NGOs and humanitarian organizations lend support to women's rights in India, western approaches to feminism may not provide the relief necessary.Subramaniam, M. (2004). The Indian Women's Movement. Contemporary Sociology, 33(6), 635\u2013639. In 2009, the National Women's Front was launched, under the guidance of the controversial Popular Front of India, to \"create a platform for women through which women can stand up against injustice and fight for their rights\". The organization started and worked in three states, but is now working within eight states. The aim is to provide support and encourage women living in rural communities that are often overlooked by the government to fight for their equality. == Programs and campaigns== A workshop on Women Safety was organized by the National Women's Front at the India Islamic Cultural Center in New Delhi in 2013 where a participant noted that \u201cthe main reason behind the recent rape incident in December 2012 [Referring to Nirbhaya Rape Case] was alcohol, but no one stressed on the probation of alcohol which lead for this heinous crime. A stop this kind of violence we should work on awareness campaign against alcohol.\u201d. In September of the same year National Women's Front organized the national campaign \"Right to Hijab\" across the country to create awareness about hijab and also promote the right to cultural identity. In 2014, the NWF Delhi State unit held an International Women's Day celebration with their nationwide campaign \"Women Representation \u2013 The Power to Empower\". In November of the same year, the NWF organised a conference \u2018Awakening\u2019 to debate issues concerning Indian women at Coimbatore. On the eve of the conference, an expo on women's rights and issues was inaugurated by Popular Front of India state president A.S.Ismail. Graphic illustrations of domestic violence, rape, female foeticide and riots victims have been presented at the expo. NWF conducted a campaign related to human rights and legal awareness in various States of India. The Kerala State committee of National Women's Front organized a campaign against the Uniform Civil Code, as a part of national level of initiative to create awareness of the threat posed by the Code to the cultural diversity of India. They termed the Uniform Civil Code \"anti-national\" as it eliminates the diversity of different communities ultimately destroying Indian Nationalism. According to them it is a manifestation of anti-Muslim tendencies of Hindutva groups. It strongly condemned the disgraceful attack on muslim women at the Mandsaur railway station in Madhya Pradesh. She called for an end to violence, for the culprits to be brought to justice, and for the Government to control hate speakers. Irom Chanu Sharmila has been fasting since 2000 demanding the withdrawal of Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) imposed in Manipur. Her arrest, after the release order from the Imphal Sessions Court, was condemned by the NWF national secretariat members who gathered a meeting in their headquarters. When she called an end to her 16 long year fast to enter politics, she received a negative response from the people of Manipur itself. But NWF and other minorities group supported her decision in this cause. == References == == External links == Category:Feminist organisations in India ",
