    "text": "The Ch\u00e2teau de Sully, situated between Autun and Beaune (Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire), is the largest of the Renaissance ch\u00e2teaux of southern Burgundy. Paired outbuildings of a more vernacular character face each other across a grassed forecourt, while to the rear is the vegetable garden, fenced by fruit trees. The ch\u00e2teau is approached by an axial stone bridge across its moat. The fa\u00e7ades express the traditionally defensive character of the rez-de-chauss\u00e9e, the ground floor, and the richer, more open aspect of the piano nobile, articulated by pilasters. Under the central pediment that breaks the line of a traditional sloping slate roof, the arched portal is scaled to admit riders and carriages. Four similarly-treated ranges, flanked by matching angled corner towers with pyramidal roofs and surrounded by the moat, enclose a Renaissance courtyard built for the Mar\u00e9chal de Saulx-Tavanes, confident of Catherine de' Medici. The splendor of the interior courtyard shows that this ch\u00e2teau, though symmetrical and regular, still looks inwards. A rusticated ground floor with arch-headed windows supports a main floor where paired pilaster-defined bays that alternate between windows and coved niches. The historic chateau of the MacMahon family, from the marriage of the heiress Charlotte de Morey, with Jean-Baptiste de MacMahon, Sully was the birthplace of the monarchist Field Marshal, Patrice MacMahon, duc de Magenta, who was President of the French Third Republic from 1873 to 1879. The Ch\u00e2teau de Sully remains the home of the present duchesse de Magenta and her family. The ch\u00e2teau of Henri IV's minister, Maximilien de B\u00e9thune and the ducs de Sully, is the Ch\u00e2teau de Sully-sur-Loire. ==Gallery== File:Chateau de Sully 01.jpg|Courtyard alley with Common buildings on either side File:Chateau de Sully 06.jpg|Closeup of the Neo-Renaissance facade of the castle File:Chateau de Sully 15.jpg|The west facade and the bridge of Pierre Sully, Chateau de ",
