The school also offers part-time and holiday courses in the performing arts. The school had been accredited by Drama UK (organization dissolved in 2016), and it offers Qualifications and Curriculum Authority recognised qualifications validated by the City University London or Trinity College, London. ArtsEd is one of twenty-one specialist performing arts schools approved to offer government-funded Dance and Drama Awards, a scheme established to subsidise the cost of professional dance and drama training for the most talented students at leading institutions.Gov.uk: Dance and Drama 10023485 In 2013 ArtsEd was awarded a grant by the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation to fund a refurbishment project. The money was spent on the main theatre, costume storage, the School of Film and Television and the school's access facilities. In 2015 the school was rated \"Outstanding\" by Ofsted. It is a member of the Federation of Drama Schools. ==History== ArtsEd originated from two schools: one founded in 1919 by Grace Cone, the other in 1922 by Olive Ripman. Both offered curricula combining a general academic education with training in dance, drama, music and art, in preparation for professional careers in or connected with the theatre. In 1939 the two schools amalgamated to form the Cone Ripman School, later named the Arts Educational Schools. The school was first based at Stratford Place in London, but following the outbreak of World War II, relocated to Tring, Hertfordshire, sharing premises with Rothschild Bank at Tring Park. In 1941, the school reopened at Stratford Place, while the second school continued to operate in Tring. In 1947, both schools were renamed the Arts Educational Schools. The London school was later based at Golden Lane House in the Barbican until 1986 when the school purchased the former buildings of Acton and Chiswick Polytechnic. This building is now known as Cone Ripman House. In the 2000s the two schools became independent of each other, and the Tring school has been renamed Tring Park School for the Performing Arts. Today, Arts Educational Schools London is a co\u2013educational Independent Day School and Sixth Form for pupils aged 11\u201318, and a professional conservatoire specialising in acting and musical theatre, as well as a range of part-time courses. For many years, the president of the school was prima ballerina assoluta Dame Alicia Markova and Dame Beryl Grey became Director in the 1960s. Dame Alicia was succeeded in 2007 by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Iain Reid was dean of the schools from 1999 until his retirement in December 2006. He was succeeded by John Baraldi, former chief executive of Riverside Studios, and former director of the East 15 Acting School; Baraldi left the school in early 2009, and was succeeded by Jane Harrison. The current dean is Chris Hocking. == Notable former pupils == * Julie Andrews (The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins) *Kai Alexander (The Stranger, Catastrophe) * Samantha Barks (Les Mis\u00e9rables on stage and screen) * Darcey Bussell (Former Principal with the Royal Ballet, Strictly Come Dancing judge) * Gary Carr (Death in Paradise, Downton Abbey) * Adam Cooper (Former Principal with the Royal Ballet and Matthew Bourne's New Adventures) * Martin Clunes (Doc Martin, Men Behaving Badly) * Finola Hughes (Former dancer with the Northern Ballet, Cats) * Laura Haddock (Da Vinci's Demons, Luther) * Nigel Harman (EastEnders, Shrek The Musical) * Nigel Havers (Chariots of Fire, Coronation Street) * Finn Jones (Game of Thrones, Marvel's Iron Fist) * Bonnie Langford (Spamalot, EastEnders) * Margaret Lockwood (The Wicked Lady, The Lady Vanishes) * Lashana Lynch (Still Star-Crossed) * Madeleine Mantock (Charmed, Into the Badlands) *Megan McKenna (Ex on the Beach, The Only Way Is Essex) * Tuppence Middleton (Dickensian, War and Peace) * Joshua Sinclair-Evans (The Lodge) * Hugo Speer (The Full Monty, The Musketeers) * Michaela Strachan (Springwatch, The Hit Man and Her) * Oliver Tompsett (Wicked, We Will Rock You) * Sally Anne Triplett (Mamma Mia!, Chicago) * Will Young (Pop Idol Winner) * Yungblud (Musician) ==Qualifications and courses== Full Time * GCSE, A Level and BTEC Courses * BA Hons in Acting (validated by City University, London) * BA Hons in Musical Theatre (validated by City University, London) * MA in Acting (validated by City University, London) * MA in Musical Theatre Creative Practise (validated by City University, London) * Level 6 Diploma in Professional Acting (validated by Trinity College London) * Level 6 Diploma in Musical Theatre (validated by Trinity College London) * Acting Foundation Course * Musical Theatre Foundation Course Part Time * Post-Diploma BA Hons in Performance Studies (validated by City University, London) * Excelerate Evening Courses - Skills training and audition preparation * Holiday and Weekend Courses ==See also== * List of schools in Hounslow ==References== ==External links== * \u2013 official site *Profile on the Independent Schools Council website Category:The Arts Educational Schools Category:1939 establishments in England Category:Arts organizations established in 1939 Category:Buildings and structures in Chiswick Category:Chiswick Category:Dance schools in the United Kingdom Category:Drama schools in London Category:Educational institutions established in 1939 Category:Independent co-educational schools in London Category:Independent schools in the London Borough of Hounslow Category:Member schools of the Independent Schools Association (UK) ",
