At the age of 14 she sang for the first time at the Oper Frankfurt. At the age of 19 she received a two-year contract there in 1914 and made her debut in Das Nachtlager von Granada by Conradin Kreutzer. In 1916 she moved to Schwerin before she went to Berlin in 1920. There she was engaged at the Berlin State Opera from 1920 to 1924, and afterwards at the Deutsche Oper Berlin.
