    "text": "Mihai Codreanu (; July 25, 1876 \u2013 October 23, 1957) was a Romanian poet, particularly noted for his sonnets. A native and lifelong resident of Ia\u0219i, he published his first volume of verse in 1901, followed by another two years later that solidified his reputation. Aside from another book of sonnets in 1914 and two during the 1920s, he authored three highly successful translations of French plays. He also edited a series of newspapers and wrote widely for an array of literary reviews. Attracted to the stage from early on, he led and reformed the main theatre in his city for several years after World War I, and during the 1930s presided over the arts school in Ia\u0219i. Beginning in 1905, he suffered from an eye disease that soon left him unable to read or write, tasks that he accomplished through intermediaries. == Biography == === Origins and education === He was born in Ia\u0219i. His father Mihail Costache Codreanu, a native of T\u00e2rgu Ocna, was a judge and a Latin teacher at the National College who died of tuberculosis in September 1877.Viorel Ili\u0219oi, \"Necunoscutul Mihai Codreanu (2)\" , Jurnalul Na\u021bional, May 6, 2014 His mother Natalia was born in 1843 to Dimitrie M\u00e2nzariu, who later changed the family name to M\u00e2rzescu; she worked as an inspector at a maternity hospital. Her brother was Gheorghe M\u00e2rzescu, while Mihai's first cousin was Gheorghe Gh. M\u00e2rzescu.Viorel Ili\u0219oi, \"Necunoscutul Mihai Codreanu (3)\" , Jurnalul Na\u021bional, May 7, 2014 He attended secondary school from 1887 to 1894 in Ia\u0219i, Bac\u0103u and Bucharest, and probably moved around schools due to poor conduct.Viorel Ili\u0219oi, \"Necunoscutul Mihai Codreanu (4)\" , Jurnalul Na\u021bional, May 13, 2014 Codreanu's poetic debut came in Lumea ilustrat\u0103 magazine in 1891. From 1896 to 1900 he studied at the law faculty of the University of Ia\u0219i, also taking courses in medicine, philosophy and philology. His thesis focused on the patria potestas in Roman and Romanian law. He studied declamation at the Ia\u0219i Conservatory from 1897 to 1899. In the summer of 1899, after graduation but before receiving his diploma, he attended a theatrical performance by State Dragomir, and began whistling to express his disapproval. An outraged Dragomir demanded punishment; the school's leadership met to discuss its options, and resumed its investigation in autumn. Finally, the Education Ministry decided to withhold his diploma for two years. === Poetic debut and rising reputation === Title page of Din c\u00e2nd \u00een c\u00e2nd, in the 1905 Bucharest edition Codreanu took private lessons in dramatic arts with Eug\u00e8ne Silvain at Paris in 1900. While there, he saw a performance of Cyrano de Bergerac and decided to write a translation after receiving written permission from Edmond Rostand. Work on the project went slowly, but he published it in 1920 to great enthusiasm in the cultural milieu; the play premiered in Ia\u0219i in 1928. Other translations, which sold widely, include Jean Richepin's La Martyre (1901) and Rostand's La Princesse lointaine (1903). Both translations were successfully staged for many years at the Ia\u0219i National Theatre. In spite of an adolescence spent dreaming of an actor's career, Codreanu's only role on stage came in 1912, when he appeared in his translation of La Martyre.Viorel Ili\u0219oi, \"Necunoscutul Mihai Codreanu (5)\" , Jurnalul Na\u021bional, June 25, 2014 His first volume of poetry, Diafane (\"Diaphanous Forms\"), was published in 1901. He convinced Titu Maiorescu to write a preface for the Charles Baudelaire- and Mihail Eminescu- influenced verses. The resultant piece suggested that the young poet drop the imitation of Baudelaire and focus instead on Eminescu's style, which prompted Codreanu to drop the preface entirely. The contemporary press praised his uncluttered style and the classical beauty of his verses.Voicu, p. 5 Din c\u00e2nd \u00een c\u00e2nd (\"From Time to Time\") was published in 1903; and when reviewing this work, critics began to regard him as an authentic poet rather than a novice. The volume, initially published at Ia\u0219i, appeared two years later as part of the prestigious Bucharest-based Biblioteca pentru to\u021bi. In 1905, he developed an incurable and hereditary eye disease that prevented him from reading and writing for the rest of his life; the sonnets that form his legacy were thought up and memorized, before he dictated them in final form. He wore dark glasses and often leaned on friends' shoulders when he walked; the disease progressed gradually, so that colors and light slowly disappeared and he was almost entirely blind in old age. He also lost his abundant hair early and took to wearing theatrical wigs. Later, the baldness was somewhat reversed, but as the newer hair was not as rich as the wigs, he invariably appeared in a beret. In 1914, he published Statui (\"Statues\"), a collection of 99 sonnets, several of which he had composed for the dedication ceremonies of statues in his city. The work was hugely successful, garnering praise from Tudor Arghezi, Eugen Lovinescu and Gala Galaction, as well as from his friends Garabet Ibr\u0103ileanu and Octav Botez, although Izabela Sadoveanu-Evan was dismissive. He edited newspapers in his native city, including Noutatea \u0219i Propaganda (1897\u20131898), Liberalul (1904\u20131906) and the newly established Mi\u0219carea (1909); not coincidentally, his cousin M\u00e2rzescu was director at Liberalul in the same period, and founded Mi\u0219carea. In 1908, he was among the founding members of the Romanian Writers' Society. Magazines that published his work include Via\u021ba, Evenimentul, Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103, Flac\u0103ra, Convorbiri Literare, Adev\u0103rul literar \u0219i artistic and Revista Funda\u021biilor Regale. Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 was especially important in advancing his reputation, and his Statui appeared at its publishing house. A prolific writer, his articles ranged from filler articles about how to catch rats, to political and literary analyses and reflections on patriotism, education and morals. In 1914, he became a substitute professor at the conservatory, where he taught diction, expressive reading and criticism; he was full professor from 1920 to 1938. His mother died in January 1916. While Ia\u0219i, where M\u00e2rzescu was serving as mayor, would soon become the temporary capital of Romania during World War I, Codreanu's poetry was untouched by the dramatic events taking place around him.Viorel Ili\u0219oi, \"Necunoscutul Mihai Codreanu (7)\" , Jurnalul Na\u021bional, July 3, 2014 Around this period, he lived in a small old apartment in the yard of what is now the Union Museum. === Theatre director === Vila Sonet, Codreanu's home in his later years, and now a museum From 1919 to 1923, Codreanu headed the Ia\u0219i National Theatre, taking over from his friend Mihail Sadoveanu. Following the creation of Greater Romania, he saw the theatre's mission as the propagation of a national culture in an enlarged state where part of the population had only tenuous links to the national consciousness. After sending his troupe of actors on an extended tour throughout the Moldavia region, he accepted an invitation from Tiberiu Brediceanu to have the actors perform in Transylvania, newly emerged from Austro-Hungarian rule. They also reached Cern\u0103u\u021bi, the capital of formerly Austrian Bukovina, where they helped inaugurate a national theatre. Additionally, Codreanu reformed the way the theatre operated: instead of having plays rotate after four or five shows, he kept only the best parts of the repertoire and divided the troupe in two (one for comedy and drama, the other for tragedy). In his second year as director, the theatre turned a profit for the first time. As a result, actors and playwrights became much better paid and their professions rose in prestige. He also obtained funds for repairing the building, badly worn out during the war. Codreanu served as general inspector of theatres in 1924, and returned to head the theatre on an interim basis from January to November 1928.Viorel Ili\u0219oi, \"Necunoscutul Mihai Codreanu (8)\" , Jurnalul Na\u021bional, July 31, 2014 Meanwhile, he wrote C\u00e2ntecul de\u0219ert\u0103ciunii (\"The Song of Vanity\", 1921), praised by Ibr\u0103ileanu but scorned by Lovinescu. In the event, he went on to become the second winner of an annual national prize for poetry in 1925. In 1927, Sadoveanu persuaded him and P\u0103storel Teodoreanu to join the Cantemir Lodge of the Romanian Freemasonry; the three were also linked through membership in the Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 circle. Ion Simu\u021b, \"Sadoveanu francmason\" , in Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103, Nr. 10/2008 After the review moved to Bucharest, its place in the cultural life of Ia\u0219i was taken in 1936 by \u00censemn\u0103ri ie\u0219ene, which he co-directed with Sadoveanu from 1937. His last volume of original sonnets was the 1929 Turnul de filde\u0219 (\"The Ivory Tower\") and in 1939, he published Statui. Sonete \u0219i evad\u0103ri din sonet (\"Statues. Sonnets and Escapes from the Sonnet\"), which collected his prior work while adding a few new sonnets. He was the conservatory's acting rector in 1932, and held the post in his own right from 1933 to 1939, once again showing his skills as an administrator. === Mature years and legacy === In 1942, he was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy, from which he was purged by the new communist regime in 1948. Near the end of his life, he published Sonete (\"Sonnets\"), a volume of selected sonnets, with the help of Teodoreanu. In the intervening decades since his last original book in 1939, his writing was confined to magazines. His distinctions included: House Order of Hohenzollern, first class (1914); chevalier of the Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques (1921); the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur (1929) and the Order of Labor, first class (1956).Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, vol. I, p. 359. Pite\u0219ti: Editura Paralela 45, 2004. He died in 1957, and was buried in Eternitatea cemetery.Voicu, p. 7 Codreanu's first marriage, in April 1906, was to Sofia Betina Veker, who also served as secretary and caregiver. She died in 1946, and the 70-year-old widower quickly married Ecaterina Hare, a 35-year-old native of Bravicea in Bessarabia who had worked as his housekeeper since age 19. Arriving illiterate in his home, she managed to complete fourth grade, with a low passing score, in 1940. In addition to caring for her aged husband, she kept his personal objects in their original state after he died. He is rumored to have fathered a love child, but this individual, who became a university professor, denied the story his entire life.Viorel Ili\u0219oi, \"Necunoscutul Mihai Codreanu (6)\" , Jurnalul Na\u021bional, June 26, 2014 From 1934, until his death, Codreanu lived in a house called Vila Sonet, built on land donated to him the year before by the Ia\u0219i authorities in recognition of his achievements. (Sadoveanu sold rather than build a house on an adjacent plot he was given, saying he did not wish to live in Codreanu's backyard.) Since 1970, the house has been a museum almost entirely preserved as it was during his lifetime, including his personal library, office, dining room and bedroom. Codreanu walked around with a cane; the one kept in the museum was reportedly used during his Masonic initiation, and conceals a 70-cm blade of Toledo steel that he used to defend himself from drunkards and the jealous husbands of the women who thronged around him. Once, it was stolen while he was with a prostitute in a brothel, but it was later recovered.
