    "text": "Bill Spears was a near unanimous selection. The 1927 College Football All- Southern Team consists of American football players selected to the College Football All-Southern Teams selected by various organizations in for the 1927 Southern Conference football season. ==Composite eleven== John Barnhill as coach. The All-Southern eleven compiled by the Associated Press included: *John Barnhill, guard for Tennessee, second-team AP All-American, later head coach at his alma mater. *Elvin Butcher, center for Tennessee. His play against Vanderbilt helped secure the spot on the eleven, as he outplayed Vandy center Vernon Sharpe, who arguably had the better season. *Dick Dodson, halfback for Tennessee, set a record with a 91 yard run versus Transylvania. It's still the second longest run in Tennessee history, broken with a 99 yard run by Kelsey Finch against Florida in 1977. In the Tennessee-Vanderbilt game of '27, Dodson carried the ball but four times, yet was the main reason for Tennessee keeping the game a tie. *Herdis McCrary, fullback for Georgia, second-team AP and UP All-American. Known as \"Bull,\" he played in the National Football League for the Green Bay Packers from 1929 to 1933. *Tom Nash, end for Georgia, consensus All-American. He played professionally for the Green Bay Packers, selected All-Pro in 1932. *Fred Pickhard, tackle and captain for Alabama, second-team CP and UP All-American. *Ivey Shiver, end and captain for Georgia's \"dream and wonder team.\" Known as \"Chick,\" he was first-team AP All- American. He played professional baseball for the Detroit Tigers and Cincinnati Reds. *Gene Smith, guard for Georgia, third-team AP All-American. He played in the NFL for the Portsmouth Spartans. *Bill Spears, quarterback for Vanderbilt, nearest to a unanimous selection, first-team AP All-American, inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1962. He was speedy and rarely threw an interception. *Stumpy Thomason, halfback for Georgia Tech, played in the NFL for the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Eagles. *Jess Tinsley, tackle for LSU, cousin of Gaynell Tinsley. He played in the NFL for the Chicago Cardinals. ==Composite overview== Bill Spears received the most selections from the Associated Press composite.
