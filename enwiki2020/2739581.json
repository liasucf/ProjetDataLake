The 2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup season was the 56th season of professional stock car racing in the United States and the 33rd modern-era Cup series season. The season began on Saturday, February 7, and ended on Sunday, November 21. Kurt Busch with Roush Racing driving a Ford was the Nextel Cup champion. This was the first season that NASCAR utilized the Chase for the Nextel Cup format that began with the Sylvania 300 on Sunday, September 19. Under the format rules, the top 10 drivers (and any additional drivers within 400 points of the leader) by the end of the 26th race would be eligible to compete in a final 10-race playoff to determine the NASCAR Nextel Cup champion. Following the 26th race, the eligible drivers would have their points reset to bring the drivers closer together in the standings, with only five points separating each driver. The season would then continue as normal, with the driver with the most points at the end of the season becoming the champion. The NASCAR Manufacturers' Championship was won by Chevrolet when they captured 26 wins and 266 points. Ford finished in second place with 10 wins, and 224 points, while Dodge followed in third with 4 wins and 194 points. This was the first year for the new series sponsorship. Mobile phone provider Nextel assumed sponsorship of the NASCAR championship series from cigarette brand Winston. Winston was the title sponsor of the Cup Series for 33 seasons, from 1971 to 2003. Nextel would become only the second title sponsor in Cup Series history. This was also the first year for Sunoco as it replaced Unocal's 76 Brand as the official fuel of NASCAR. Sunoco would become only the second gas company to be NASCAR's official fuel since Unocal had been the official fuel since the sport's inception in 1948. The season was also marked by tragedy. On October 24, a charter airplane owned by Hendrick Motorsports crashed at Bull Mountain in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, near Martinsville Speedway. Ten people aboard the plane died, including four relatives of team owner Rick Hendrick, as well as Randy Dorton, Hendrick's chief engine builder. Jimmie Johnson, a Hendrick driver, had won the race, but the post-race victory ceremony was canceled as word spread of the incident. 2004 was the first season without Pontiac (though a few Pontiacs without factory support ran several early-season races). It was also the last season before Denny Hamlin and Clint Bowyer join NASCAR as drivers (They would join as full-time in 2006). ==Teams and drivers== ===Full-time schedule=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" !Make !Team ! !Driver !Crew chief |- ! rowspan=23 | Chevrolet | rowspan=2 | Dale Earnhardt, Inc. | 8 | Dale Earnhardt Jr. | Tony Eury Sr. |- | 15 | Michael Waltrip |Slugger Labbe |- | rowspan=2 |Haas CNC Racing | rowspan=2 |0 | Ward Burton | rowspan=2 |Bootie Barker |- | Mike Bliss |- | rowspan=4 | Hendrick Motorsports | 5 | Terry Labonte | Jim Long |- | 24 | Jeff Gordon | Robbie Loomis |- | 25 | Brian Vickers (R) | Peter Sospenzo |- | 48 | Jimmie Johnson | Chad Knaus |- | rowspan=2 | Joe Gibbs Racing | 18 | Bobby Labonte | Brandon Thomas |- | 20 | Tony Stewart | Greg Zipadelli |- | rowspan=2 | MBV Motorsports | 01 | Joe Nemechek |Ryan Pemberton |- | 10 | Scott Riggs (R) |Doug Randolph |- | rowspan=3 |Morgan-McClure Motorsports | rowspan=3 |4 | Kevin Lepage | rowspan=3 |Chris Carrier |- | Jimmy Spencer |- | Mike Wallace |- | rowspan=2 |PPI Motorsports | rowspan=2 |32 | Ricky Craven | rowspan=2 |Harold Holly |- | Bobby Hamilton Jr. |- | rowspan=6 | Richard Childress Racing | 29 | Kevin Harvick |Todd Berrier |- | rowspan=4 |30 | Johnny Sauter | rowspan=4|Kevin Hamlin |- | Dave Blaney |- | Jim Inglebright |- | Jeff Burton |- | 31 | Robby Gordon |Chris Andrews |- ! rowspan=12 | Dodge | BAM Racing | 49 | Ken Schrader |David Hyder |- | Bill Davis Racing | 22 | Scott Wimmer (R) |Frank Stoddard |- | rowspan=3 | Chip Ganassi Racing | 40 | Sterling Marlin |Tony Glover |- | 41 | Casey Mears |Jimmy Elledge |- | 42 | Jamie McMurray |Donnie Wingo |- | rowspan=2 | Evernham Motorsports | 9 | Kasey Kahne (R) |Tommy Baldwin Jr. |- | 19 | Jeremy Mayfield |Kenny Francis |- | rowspan=3 | Penske- Jasper Racing | 2 | Rusty Wallace |Larry Carter |- | 12 | Ryan Newman |Matt Borland |- | 77 | Brendan Gaughan (R) |Shane Wilson |- | rowspan=2 | Petty Enterprises | 43 | Jeff Green |Greg Steadman |- | 45 | Kyle Petty |Bill Henderson |- ! rowspan=14 | Ford | rowspan=4 |Kirk Shelmerdine Racing | rowspan=4 |72 | Kirk Shelmerdine | rowspan=4 | Phil Harris |- | Tom Hubert |- | Ted Christopher |- | Brad Teague |- | rowspan=2 | Robert Yates Racing | 38 | Elliott Sadler |Todd Parrott |- | 88 | Dale Jarrett |Mike Ford |- | rowspan=7 | Roush Racing | 6 | Mark Martin |Pat Tryson |- | 16 | Greg Biffle |Doug Richert |- | 17 | Matt Kenseth |Robbie Reiser |- | 97 | Kurt Busch |Jimmy Fennig |- | rowspan=3|99 | Jeff Burton | rowspan=3|Bob Osbourne |- | Carl Edwards (R) |- |Dave Blaney |- | Wood Brothers Racing | 21 | Ricky Rudd | Michael McSwain |- |} === Limited schedule === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" !Make !Team ! !Driver !Crew Chief !Rounds |- ! rowspan=27 | Chevrolet | Brewco Motorsports | 27 | David Green | | |- | rowspan=2 |Competitive Edge Motorsports | rowspan=2 |51 | Kevin Lepage | rowspan=2 | | |- | Tony Raines | |- | Conely Racing | 79 | Stan Boyd | | |- | rowspan=4 | Dale Earnhardt, Inc. | rowspan=4 | 1 | John Andretti | rowspan=4 |Pete Rondeau | |- | Ron Fellows | |- | Martin Truex Jr. | |- | Kenny Wallace | |- | rowspan=2 |Gary Keller Racing | rowspan=2 |35 | Mike Wallace | rowspan=2 | | |- | Kenny Hendrick | |- | GIC-Mixon Motorsports | 93 | Geoffrey Bodine | | |- | Haas CNC Racing | 60 | Jason Leffler | | |- | Hendrick Motorsports | 84 | Kyle Busch | Gary DeHart | |- | Hollenbeck Motorsports | 62 | Larry Hollenbeck | | |- | rowspan=3 |Joe Gibbs Racing | rowspan=2 |11 | J.

Joe Ruttman arrived at the track without a pit crew for a start and park, Andy Hillenburg was involved in a crash after running slow, and Kirk Shelmerdine was black-flagged for failing to maintain a minimum speed. NASCAR added a mandate of a full pit crew in an attempt to stop the start and park. * NASCAR also announced, in light of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, at the drivers' meeting that a points penalty would also be assessed to anyone involved on a race team who uses inappropriate language. Previously, a fine had been assessed. === UAW-DaimlerChrysler 400 === The UAW-DaimlerChrysler 400 was held on March 7 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

Hermie Sadler drove the 02 car for Pontiac's final ever race. === Samsung/Radio Shack 500 === The Samsung/Radio Shack 500 was held on April 4 at Texas Motor Speedway.

Andy Belmont failed to make the race. Carl Long, Andy Belmont, and Hermie Sadler however, did run a combined 4 races (which all 4 races were consecutive) in a Pontiac at the beginning of the season, driving the number 02 car for Sadler Brothers Racing, a single-car team. Carl Long raced the car at Las Vegas, then the next 2 weekends, Andy Belmont raced at Atlanta and Darlington, and finally, one week later, Hermie Sadler raced at Bristol. The Bristol race marked the final race ever for Pontiac, and those 4 races would be the final 4 races for Pontiac in NASCAR. Andy Belmont attempted Rockingham in February along with this race but failed to make both events. After failing to make this race, Pontiac left NASCAR for good. Pontiac leaves the sport with 3 Manufacturer's Championships (1961, 1962, and 1993), and scoring 154 Career NASCAR wins. Rusty Wallace is the all-time winner in a Pontiac at 31. Only 4 drivers have won the Series Championship driving a Pontiac: Joe Weatherly (1962 and 1963), Rusty Wallace (1989), Bobby Labonte (2000), and Tony Stewart (2002). *This race marked the last career pole for Bobby Labonte. === Advance Auto Parts 500 === The Advance Auto Parts 500 was held on April 18 at Martinsville Speedway.

Jeff Gordon would run into the broken up part of the track, damaging his race car. The race was red flagged to repair the track, and while NASCAR would not grant the 24 team's request to be able to repair the car during the red flag, Gordon was able to fight back in the second half of the race for a sixth-place finish. *Rusty Wallace broke a winless streak of 106 races, dating all the way back from April 29, 2001, at Auto Club Speedway. *This would be the 55th and final career win for Rusty Wallace. With this win, he passed Lee Petty on NASCAR's win list. === Aaron's 499 === The Aaron's 499 was held on April 25 at Talladega Superspeedway. Ricky Rudd won the pole. * Complete results Top ten results #24- Jeff Gordon #8- Dale Earnhardt Jr. #29- Kevin Harvick #48- Jimmie Johnson #31- Robby Gordon #6- Mark Martin #99- Jeff Burton #41- Casey Mears #42- Jamie McMurray #18- Bobby Labonte Failed to qualify: Larry Foyt (#14), Todd Bodine (#98), Kirk Shelmerdine (#72) *The race ended under controversy when Brian Vickers crashed with four laps to go. At the same time, Jeff Gordon was about to be passed by Dale Earnhardt Jr. As Gordon's car was still ahead of Earnhardt's, he kept the lead for the following caution. However, the race never was restarted, and Gordon won the race under the caution, prompting angered fans to throw beverage cups at his car while he celebrated his victory by doing doughnuts on the track. The issue was very similar to the 2002 Indianapolis 500 controversial finish when H\u00e9lio Castroneves and Paul Tracy raced when the caution signal was given during Tracy's attempted pass of Castroneves. This led to the implementation of the green-white-checker finish rule in order to avoid such situations in the future. *This would be Jeff Gordon's 1st Restrictor Plate win since this event in 2000. *The event marked the last career pole for Ricky Rudd. === Auto Club 500 === The Auto Club 500 was held on May 2 at California Speedway.

The winner of the battle was dark horse candidate Kasey Kahne, who went from a 41st-place finish at the season opening Daytona 500, to being narrowly defeated by Matt Kenseth the next week at Rockingham, and he never looked back, grabbing fourteen top ten finishes and thirteen top-five finishes, as well as a couple of pole positions. Pre-season favorites Scott Wimmer and Brian Vickers struggled, although Wimmer placed third in the Daytona 500, but neither made competitive strides during the season. Brendan Gaughan was a pleasant surprise, posting four top tens and finishing runner-up to Kahne for the award, while Scott Riggs only had two-top ten finishes. The only other rookie, Johnny Sauter, was released from his ride mid-season and never made a challenge for the top honor. ==See also== *2004 NASCAR Busch Series *2004 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series *2004 Chase for the Nextel Cup == References == == External links == * Racing Reference Category:NASCAR Cup Series seasons ",
