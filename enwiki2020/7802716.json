    "text": "General elections were held in Mexico on 21 August 1994.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p453 The presidential elections resulted in a victory for Ernesto Zedillo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), whilst the PRI won 300 of the 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 95 of the 128 seats in the Senate. Voter turnout ranged from 77.4% in the proportional representation section of the Chamber elections to 75.9% in the constituency section. These were the first presidential elections in Mexico that were monitored by international observers. To date, the 1994 elections mark the last time a presidential candidate won in all 31 states and Mexico City. Although tension did not reach the level it did around the 1988 election, most political analysts agree that voters (in the aftermath of the Zapatista uprising that began in January and the assassination of the original PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio), opted for continuity by allowing the PRI to remain in power, fearing that the country might otherwise be destabilized. == Background == The 1994 election took place in an atmosphere of political instability after the rise of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) on 1 January that year. The insurgency was a serious hit on the image that the Government wanted to portray of a developed, advanced country, and it highlighted the negative effects of the neoliberal reforms enacted by the Salinas administration. In the past six years, the right-wing opposition Partido Acci\u00f3n Nacional (PAN) had won many state elections, and was seen as a serious contender for the presidency in 1994. On the other hand, the left-wing Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD), while building a wide social base, had failed to win any state governorship, which its leaders blamed on repression and electoral fraud by the PRI-controlled federal government. == Campaign == Luis Donaldo Colosio was the original PRI presidential candidate before his assassination on 23 March. ===Nominations=== Outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari chose his Secretary of Social Development, Luis Donaldo Colosio, to be the PRI presidential candidate. Salinas' choice sparked a brief internal conflict in the government, as Manuel Camacho Sol\u00eds, who was then Mayor of Mexico City, had expected himself to be the PRI candidate, and quit his position in protest. President Salinas immediately appointed Camacho as Minister of Foreign Relations to hide the conflict, and tried to appease him. In the aftermath of the Zapatista uprising, Camacho was designated Peace Commissioner in Chiapas. The PAN chose Diego Fern\u00e1ndez de Cevallos as their candidate through an internal convention. Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas ran for the presidency once again, this time as the candidate of the PRD, the party he founded in 1989. Six other parties presented their own candidates. ===Early campaign=== In the initial months of the campaign, PRI candidate Colosio expressed dissatisfaction with his campaign management, as polls indicated his popular support was far lower than earlier PRI candidates. Colosio's campaign lacked funding and had problems getting media coverage in the wake of the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas. Due to this poor performance, the PRI leadership considered replacing Colosio as the presidential candidate. With Camacho's own popularity rising due to his role as mediator in the Zapatista conflict. At one point, President Salinas had to state to the media \"Don't get confused, Colosio is the candidate\". Due to his campaign's underperformance, Colosio tried to distance himself from the outgoing President. On 6 March 1994, the anniversary of the PRI's founding, Colosio broke with Salinas in a controversial-but-popular speech in front of the Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n in Mexico City. In his speech, Colosio spoke against government abuse, and in support of indigenous peoples and the people's independence from government. The speech was controversial, as it echoed many of the beliefs of the ZANL platform.Discurso de Luis Donaldo Colosio, durante el acto conmemorativo del LXV Aniversario del PRI en el Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n. Marzo 6, 1994 On 22 March, Camacho himself stated that he was not interested in being the PRI candidate, instead focusing on the Chiapas conflict. The day after Camacho's statement, Colosio was killed. ===Assassination of Colosio=== At 5:05 PM PST on 23 March, at a campaign rally in Lomas Taurinas, a poor neighborhood of Tijuana, Colosio was shot in the head with a .38 Special by Mario Aburto Mart\u00ednez at a distance of a few centimeters. Colosio collapsed and was rushed to the city's main hospital after plans to fly him to an American hospital were cancelled. His death was announced a few hours later amid inconsistent eyewitness reports. The assassination of Colosio was the first magnicide to occur in Mexico since the murder of \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n in 1928. The assassination had a profound impact on the Mexican public opinion, already tumultuous by the conflict in Chiapas. A number of conspiracy theories about the assassination persist, including that it was orchestrated by drug traffickers.Patenostro, Silvana. \"Mexico as a Narco-democracy.\" World Policy Journal 12.1 (1995): 41-47. However, the most accepted theory among the Mexican people is that he was betrayed by his own party and that the murder was orchestrated by high members of PRI, including President Salinas, as Colosio had begun to reject Salinas's political agenda. ====The assassin, Mario Aburto Mart\u00ednez==== The shooter, Mario Aburto Mart\u00ednez, was arrested at the site and never wavered from his story that he had acted alone. Nonetheless, many theories still surround the assassination. The authorities were criticized for their poor handling of Aburto, having shaved, bathed and given him a prison haircut before showing him to the media, which started rumors about whether a man who looked so different from the one arrested was really the murderer. Colosio received three bullet wounds, and it was never clear if they could have been done by a single person or not. The case was officially closed after many different prosecutors investigated it, but after the many mishandlings of the investigation and contradictory versions, the controversy continues. Aburto remains imprisoned at the high-security La Palma facility in Almoloya de Ju\u00e1rez. === Selection of the new PRI candidate === President Salinas declared three days of national mourning after Colosio's death, while all the opposition candidates lamented the assassination and called for an end to political violence. In the aftermath, many PRI members sought to replace the dead candidate. In the end, President Salinas chose Ernesto Zedillo, who had been Colosio's campaign manager, as the new PRI presidential candidate. Zedillo had been Secretary of Education, a relatively unimportant ministry; he had resigned to run the campaign of Colosio. Zedillo had never held elective office, sharing that trait with De la Madrid and Salinas, but Zedillo was not otherwise experienced politically. He was perceived as a weak candidate. There were speculation that Salinas wished to perpetuate his power as Plutarco El\u00edas Calles had in the wake of the 1928 assassination of president-elect Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n, controlling successor presidents.Thomas Legler, \"Ernesto Zedillo\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1641 === Televised debates === For the first time in Mexican history, the 1994 campaign featured televised debates between the Presidential candidates. On 12 May, the three main contenders Zedillo, Fern\u00e1ndez de Cevallos and C\u00e1rdenas participated in the first Presidential debate in Mexican history. An estimated audience of 34 million watched the debate. Polls after the debate indicated that the PAN candidate, Diego Fern\u00e1ndez de Cevallos, had defeated the other two candidates, and had become capable of defeating the PRI candidate in the elections. However, in the aftermath of the debate Fern\u00e1ndez de Cevallos seemed to decrease his media presence, and Zedillo continued in the first place at the polls; on the other hand, the polls also indicated that Zedillo might win with less than 50% of the popular vote, something unprecedented for a PRI candidate (notwithstanding previous controversial elections in which the PRI was accused of fraud). After the 12 May debate between the main three contenders, there was also a debate between the Presidential candidates of smaller parties. ==Opinion polls== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=text-align:center !
