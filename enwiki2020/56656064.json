The conservation park occupies land in section 157 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Short on the southern side of the Robe - Penola Road. The land first acquired protected area status as the Calectasia National Parks Reserve proclaimed on 7 September 1967 under the National Parks Act 1966. On 27 April 1972, it was renamed as the Calectasia Conservation Park upon the proclamation of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 which repealed the former act along with other statutes concerned with conservation. As of 2016, it covered an area of . In 1980, the statement of significance provided for the now-defunct Register of the National Estate states that it \u201cpreserves a population of the blue tinsel lily\u2026 now rare in South Australia and a small seasonal swamp important for water birds and eastern swamp rats.\u201d In 1990, the conservation park was described as consisting of a \u2018\u2019stranded dune system\u201d remnant divided into two areas by a low-lying area which accounts for about 70% of the conservation park's area and which is \u201csubject to inundation during the wetter months of the year.\u201d The area in the south supports a brown stringybark woodland with an understorey of Austral grass tree, the \u2018low-lying area\u2019 supports \u201ca dense grassland of mainly introduced species\u201d while the area in the north supports a \u201clow woodland of brown stringybark with large scattered desert banksia\u2026 and a dense heath understorey.\u201d The blue tinsel lily grows in the north east part of the conservation park where a protective enclosure has been erected around the main stand of the plant. Additional protection exists for the species in the form of a vermin proof fence to the perimeter of the conservation park. The conservation park was within the part of the state that was burnt during the Ash Wednesday bushfires in February 1983. The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category IV protected area. ==See also== *Protected areas of South Australia ==References== * ==External links== *Calectasia Conservation Park webpage on the Protected Planet website Category:Conservation parks of South Australia Category:Protected areas established in 1967 Category:1967 establishments in Australia Category:Limestone Coast Category:South Australian places listed on the defunct Register of the National Estate ",
