    "text": "Quilted maple back & side on Gibson Dove 1 of 20 Quilt or quilted maple refers to a type of figure in maple wood. It is seen on the tangential plane (flat-sawn) and looks like a wavy \"quilted\" pattern, often similar to ripples on water. The highest quality quilted figure is found in the Western Big Leaf species of maple. It is a distortion of the grain pattern itself. Prized for its beauty, it is used frequently in the manufacturing of musical instruments, especially guitars. ==See also== Flame maple ==References== ==External links== Category:Maple Category:Wood ",
