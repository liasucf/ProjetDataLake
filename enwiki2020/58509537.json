Ros\u00e9 signed with South Korean label YG Entertainment following an audition in 2012, training there for four years. She eventually made her debut as the main vocalist in the girl group Blackpink in August 2016. As a solo artist, she has featured in labelmate G-Dragon's 2012 track \"Without You\", which peaked at number ten on the Gaon Music Chart. == Life and career == === 1997\u20132015: Early life and career === Roseanne Park (; Park Chae-young) was born on 11 February 1997 in Auckland, New Zealand, to South Korean immigrant parents. She has an older sister. In 2004, at the age of seven, Ros\u00e9 and her family moved to Melbourne, Australia. Ros\u00e9 initially attended Kew East Primary School graduating in 2009, attending Canterbury Girls' Secondary College in Melbourne for her secondary schooling. She began singing and learned to play guitar and piano as a child and performed in church choirs. In 2012, 16-year-old Ros\u00e9 attended an audition in Australia for South Korean record label YG Entertainment at her father's suggestion and was ranked first among 700 participants. Within two months, she dropped out of school, signed with the label and moved to Seoul. Ros\u00e9 initially thought her father's idea was a joke due to the distance and difficulty of becoming a singer overseas, stating: The same year, Ros\u00e9 was given an opportunity to feature on labelmate G-Dragon's song \"Without You\" off his EP One of a Kind (2012). Her name was not publicised at the time of release with her credit revealed following her announcement as a Blackpink member. The song peaked at number ten on South Korea's Gaon Music Chart and at number 15 on the Billboard Korea K-pop Hot 100. === 2016\u2013present: Debut with Blackpink === Ros\u00e9 trained at YG Entertainment for four years before her announcement as a member of Blackpink in June 2016.

The singer has also appeared on a variety of broadcast programmes such as music shows King of Masked Singer and Fantastic Duo 2. Her vocal performance on King of Masked Singer was met with a warm reception by the audience, to which Ros\u00e9 commented that she \"didn't know if the audience would like [her] singing\" and that she felt \"happy and relieved\" at the positive result. Ros\u00e9 later appeared as a performer on the second season of Fantastic Duo. The show's production staff stated that her appearance was intended to \"reveal Ros\u00e9's vocal appeal, which is different from Blackpink\". On June 2, 2020, YG Entertainment announced that Ros\u00e9 would debut solo in 2020, following the release of Blackpink's first full album. == Artistry == Ros\u00e9's voice has received acknowledgement in the K-pop industry for its distinct vocal timbre, following her debut as a member of Blackpink. Following Ros\u00e9's performance on an episode of Fantastic Duo 2, South Korean singer Gummy, whom Ros\u00e9 cited as a musical role model, stated that \"[Ros\u00e9's] voice is so unique, it's the [type of] voice young people love\". Through a radio interview, Ros\u00e9 cited labelmate senior Big Bang's Taeyang as her role model towards her musical career. As a musician, Ros\u00e9 also considers American singer Tori Kelly an inspiration on her musical style. == Endorsements == In 2018, Ros\u00e9 and fellow Blackpink member Jisoo were selected as endorsement models for the South Korean cosmetics brand Kiss Me.
