    "text": "The Yugoslavia national under-21 football team existed in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the state's dissolution in 1992, the following teams were formed: *Bosnia and Herzegovina national under-21 football team *Croatia national under-21 football team *Macedonia national under-21 football team *Slovenia national under-21 football team *FR Yugoslavia national under-21 football team (succeeded by Serbia national under-21 football team and Montenegro national under-21 football team in 2003) Following the realignment of UEFA's youth competitions in 1976, Yugoslavia's Under-21 team was formed. The team had a varied record, reaching the last four in four tournaments and failing to qualify for four. Yugoslavia won the inaugural competition in 1978. Since the under-21 competition rules insist that players must be 21 or under at the start of a two-year competition, technically it is an U-23 competition. Yugoslavia's record in U-23 competitions is also shown. ==UEFA European Under-23 Challenge Cup== Yugoslavia were randomly chosen to play holders Bulgaria for the title, which they won. They then faced (and beat) other randomly chosen teams until the competition was abandoned in summer 1970 for a larger competition. * October 26, 1968: Bulgaria 1\u20132 Yugoslavia * June 6, 1969: Yugoslavia 3\u20130 Spain * November 6, 1969: Yugoslavia 2\u20130 Sweden * March 24, 1970: Greece 1\u20135 Yugoslavia * 1972: Did not qualify.
