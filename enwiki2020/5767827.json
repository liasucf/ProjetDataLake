    "text": "William Courtney Rodgers (also known as Bill Rodgers and Avalon) (born 1965; died December 21, 2005) was an environmental activist, animal rights activist and a co-proprietor of the Catalyst Infoshop in Prescott, Arizona, USA. He was one of six environmental activists arrested December 7, 2005 as part of the FBI's Operation Backfire. His charge was one count of arson for a June, 1998 fire set by the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) at the National Wildlife Research Center in Olympia, Washington. He was found dead in his jail cell on December 21, 2005. According to police, Rodgers committed suicide using a plastic bag. ==Biography== === Before ELF === Rodgers first adopted deep ecology style thinking and engaged in Earth First! activism at Mt. Graham telescope project protests of the early 1990s in Arizona. He lived out of his Toyota 4\u00d74 as he traveled North America's wild lands and became involved in many Earth First demonstrations of that time. Rogers was one of the few long-term activists to camp out in snow caves in central Idaho's deepest wilderness during the Cove/Mallard timber sale in the winter of 1994\u20131995. His experiences and exposure in some of the last true wild lands of this planet must have further radicalized Avalon beyond the civil disobedience activism of Earth First! (EF). EF style civil disobedience was at the time was under consideration as possible terrorism by the US Congress in hearings of select subcommittees. Avalon was a long-term EF activist, one of the occupation activists of the Cove / Mallard timber sale protests for years, and was one of four protesters whom constantly camped out in snow-caves in the winter of January\u2013March 1995 in 12 foot deep snow and sub-zero temps, monitoring the logging traffic on Noble Road. After witnessing the destruction of \"America's Amazon Jungle\", Avalon became disenchanted with mere civil-disobedience tactics and grew more radical.William C. Rodgers Avalon briefly secluded himself in Spring 1995 only to reappear at the Earth First 11 month-long occupation of the Warner Creek timber sale or 'Free Cascadia' in Oregon. During these times Avalon always spoke of being a witness for the defenseless and was a peaceful presence. While participating in the occupation of Warner Creek Oregon, Rogers first met Jacob Ferguson aka \"Donut\", the man who years later turned FBI informant against this cell of Earth Liberation Front activists, to avoid prison time for heroin possession.Associated Press 05/24/2007 by Jeff Barnard Ironically, Rodgers openly debated with other radical environmentalists against the effectiveness of targeted property destruction operations, during the mid-1990s. ===ELF and later=== The Catalyst Infoshop Between 1996 and 2001 the ELF cell Rogers was involved in is alleged to have started fifteen fires across the West. Rodgers wrote an article for the Earth First Journal about how drug abuse was sapping the will & strength of the environmental movement as activists got depressed and sought solace from the emotional pain by smoking marijuana or drinking heavily. After an action involving burning SUVs in March 2001, the Police become suspicious of ELF cell member Ferguson. Rogers, worried of getting caught and tired of infighting, moved to Prescott, Arizona. In 2004, Rogers co-founded the Catalyst Infoshop with Katie Rose Nelson. === Arrest and Death === Rodgers was arrested in an FBI raid on December 7, 2005 at the Catalyst Infoshop. The FBI were working on information provided by Ferguson, an informer from the same ELF cell as Rodgers. Rodgers wrote a suicide note which he mailed to a number of his friends: == Government claims == The FBI has claimed that Rodgers was a criminal \"mastermind\" and the anonymous author of Setting Fire with Electrical Timers, an Earth Liberation Front Guide,Prosecutors portray close-knit arson team, The Seattle Times, 21 January 2006. which explained in detail how to create an incendiary device known as a \"cat's cradle\". Authorities said that once the guide was published they no longer were able to tell with certainty when the ELF cell connected to Rodgers was responsible for an arson. == Continuing influence == Rodgers has had a continuing impact on various anarchist and radical environmentalist movements. A number of acts have been dedicated to his memory. Among these have been the removal of 28 beagle puppies from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the Independent University of Madrid28 beagles rescued by ALF, Bombs and Shields, 12 January 2006. and the burning of a partially constructed development in Guelph, Ontario, Canada.Anti-Sprawl ELF Action in Memory of William Rodgers , Mostly Water, 10 February 2006. == See also == * Rod Coronado * Eco-terrorism * Green anarchism * Green Scare == References == == External links == * No Compromise Memorial * Tales of Passion and Conviction Category:1965 births Category:Earth Liberation Front Category:American anarchists Category:American environmentalists Category:Eco-terrorism Category:Year of birth missing Category:2005 deaths Category:Deaths from asphyxiation Category:Activists who committed suicide Category:People from Prescott, Arizona Category:Deaths in police custody in the United States Category:Suicides by asphyxiation Category:Animal rights activists Category:Male suicides ",
