It was the second edition of the Wimbledon Championships in the Open Era and the 83rd since its formation. It was held at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club at Wimbledon, London from Monday 23 June until Saturday 5 July 1969. Ann Jones became the first British champion of the open era, the first victor since 1961; Britain would have to wait 8 years, until the 1977 tournament to see another British winner in the singles competition \u2013 Virginia Wade. Rod Laver won the men's singles title, his fourth Wimbledon crown after 1961, 1962 and 1968, and went on to win his second Grand Slam after 1962. 41-year-old Pancho Gonzalez beat Charlie Pasarell in a first-round men's singles match by a score of 22\u201324, 1\u20136, 16\u201314, 6\u20133, 11\u20139. At 112 games and 5 hours 20 minutes it was by far the longest match of the time. The match led to the introduction of the tiebreak in tennis. The 112-game record lasted 41 years until the Isner\u2013Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships. ==Prize money== The total prize money for 1969 championships was \u00a333,370. The winner of the men's title earned \u00a33,000 while the women's singles champion earned \u00a31.500. {|class=wikitable style=font-size:90%;text-align:center |- | style=\"width:130px; background:#dfe2e9;\"|Event | style=\"width:80px; background:lime;\"|W | style=\"width:85px; background:thistle;\"|F | style=\"width:85px; background:#ff0;\"|SF | style=\"width:85px; background:#ffebcd;\"|QF | style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 16 | style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 32 | style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 64 | style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 128 |- | style=\"background:#ededed;\" |Men's Singles |\u00a33,000 |\u00a31,500 |\u00a3800 |\u00a3450 |\u00a3175 |\u00a3125 |\u00a380 |\u00a350 |- | style=\"background:#ededed;\" |Women's Singles |\u00a31,500 |\u00a3750 |\u00a3350 |\u00a3200 |\u00a3125 |\u00a390 |\u00a370 |\u00a350 |- | style=\"background:#ededed;\" |Men's Doubles * |\u00a31,000 |\u00a3600 |\u00a3400 |\u00a3200 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 | |- | style=\"background:#ededed;\" |Women's Doubles* |\u00a3600 |\u00a3400 |\u00a3200 |\u00a3100 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 | |- | style=\"background:#ededed;\" |Mixed Doubles* |\u00a3500 |\u00a3350 |\u00a3175 |\u00a3100 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 |} * per team ==Champions== ===Seniors=== ====Men's Singles==== Rod Laver defeated John Newcombe, 6\u20134, 5\u20137, 6\u20134, 6\u20134 ====Women's Singles==== Ann Jones defeated Billie Jean King, 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20132 ====Men's Doubles==== John Newcombe / Tony Roche defeated Tom Okker / Marty Riessen, 7\u20135, 11\u20139, 6\u20133 ====Women's Doubles==== Margaret Court / Judy Tegart defeated Patti Hogan / Peggy Michel, 9\u20137, 6\u20132 ====Mixed Doubles==== Fred Stolle / Ann Jones defeated Tony Roche / Judy Tegart, 6\u20132, 6\u20133 ===Juniors=== ====Boys' Singles==== Byron Bertram defeated John Alexander, 7\u20135, 5\u20137, 6\u20134 ====Girls' Singles==== Kazuko Sawamatsu defeated Brenda Kirk, 6\u20131, 1\u20136, 7\u20135 ==Singles seeds== ===Men's singles=== # Rod Laver (Champion) # Tony Roche (Semifinals, lost to John Newcombe) # Tom Okker (Quarterfinals, lost to John Newcombe) # Ken Rosewall (Third round, lost to Bob Lutz) # Arthur Ashe (Semifinals, lost to Rod Laver) # John Newcombe (Final, lost to Rod Laver) # Clark Graebner (Third round, lost to Bob Hewitt) # Cliff Drysdale (Quarterfinals, lost to Rod Laver) # Roy Emerson (Fourth round, lost to Cliff Drysdale) # Andr\u00e9s Gimeno (Fourth round, lost to Clark Graebner) # Fred Stolle (Fourth round, lost to John Newcombe) # Pancho Gonzales (Fourth round, lost to Arthur Ashe) # Ray Moore (First round, lost to John Alexander) # Bob Hewitt (First round, lost to Cliff Richey) # Dennis Ralston (Fourth round, lost to Tony Roche) # Stan Smith (First round, lost to Allan Stone) ===Women's singles=== # Margaret Court (Semifinals, lost to Ann Jones) # Billie Jean King (Final, lost to Ann Jones) # Virginia Wade (Third round, lost to Pat Walkden) # Ann Jones (Champion) # Nancy Richey (Quarterfinals, lost to Ann Jones) # Kerry Melville (Second round, lost to Rosemary Casals) # Julie Heldman (Quarterfinals, lost to Margaret Court) # Judy Tegart (Quarterfinals, lost to Billie Jean King) ==References== ==External links== * Official Wimbledon Championships website Wimbledon Championships Wimbledon Championships Wimbledon Championships Wimbledon Championships ",
