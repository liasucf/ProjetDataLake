The Tigers were victorious 8\u20132. The winning pitcher was Detroit starter Brian Moehler. The losing pitcher was Jeff Suppan. ===The pregame ceremony=== Prior to the final game at Tiger Stadium, a ceremony was held. It was emceed by then current Tiger broadcaster and Ford C. Frick Award recipient Ernie Harwell. At the ceremony, owner Mike Ilitch spoke along with then Michigan governor John Engler, then Detroit mayor Dennis Archer and Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig. Also featured at the ceremony was longtime Tiger right fielder and Hall of Famer Al Kaline. Instead of both managers exchanging lineups before the game, both clubs appointed honorary captains. Representing the Tigers was Kaline and representing the Royals was former MVP and Hall of Fame third baseman George Brett. ===The postgame ceremony=== The game ended at 7:07 pm. The grounds crew then surrounded home plate. Groundskeeper Charlie McGee, using a pick axe, dug up home plate at 7:13. It would then be transported by Tiger pitchers Matt Anderson, Jeff Weaver, and Francisco Cordero, with police escort, to Comerica Park. Ernie Harwell then read a history of Tiger Stadium accompanied by music from the movie Field of Dreams. He introduced a film containing images of such Tiger legends as Ty Cobb, Sam Crawford, Hughie Jennings and Harry Heilmann. In addition, the Tigers Hall of Famers were honored: Heinie Manush, Mickey Cochrane, Charlie Gehringer, Hank Greenberg, Hal Newhouser, George Kell, and Harwell. Following remarks from Willie Horton and former manager Sparky Anderson, there emerged from the center field gate players from times past, including Mark Fidrych, Bill Freehan, Dick McAuliffe, Dave Bergman, Mickey Stanley, Willie Horton, Kirk Gibson, Cecil Fielder, Al Kaline, the combination of Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker, and Elden Auker. A line was formed from the center field flagpole to home plate, along which was passed the flag that had flown from the pole in dead center over the finale. After Auker passed the flag to catcher Brad Ausmus, players threw souvenirs into the stands as some reached over and put dirt from the warning track into plastic bags. It was at this time that Harwell gave his final goodbye: \"Tonight, we say good-bye. ... Farewell, old friend Tiger Stadium. We will remember.\" At 8:19, the scoreboard was shut off. At quarter to nine, a final team picture was taken, and by 9 the stands were empty. As the last of the fans left, a sign was hung on the famous right-center field overhang which read: \"Today, there is crying in baseball. So long, old friend.\" ===Ernie Harwell's farewell=== \"Ladies and gentlemen, less than six months ago, we began a warm season of farewells, and with each passing day we came a little bit closer to this historic occasion. \"The Lions, Joe Louis and Nelson Mandela. 6,873 regular-season games, 35 postseason contests and a trio of spectacular All-Star Games, Tiger Stadium has been home to this great game of baseball. But more than anything, it has been a cherished home to our memories. \"Will you remember that last base hit? The last out? How about that last pitch? Or maybe it's the first time as a child when you saw that green, green grass that will forever be etched into your mind and soul. \"Tonight, we say good-bye. But we will not forget. Open your eyes, look around and take a mental picture. Moments like this shall live on forever. \"It's been 88 moving years at Michigan and Trumbull. The tradition built here shall endure along with the permanence of the Olde English D. But tonight we must say good-bye. \"Farewell, old friend Tiger Stadium. We will remember.\" ==Player stats== ===Batting=== Note: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"46%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | AB ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | H ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | Avg. ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | HR ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | RBI |- align=\"center\" |Brad Ausmus ||127 ||458 ||126 || .275||9 ||54 |- align=\"center\" |Tony Clark ||143 ||536 ||150 || .280||31 || 99 |- align=\"center\" |Damion Easley ||151 ||549 ||146 || .266|| 20||65 |- align=\"center\" |Dean Palmer || 150||560 ||147 || .263||38 || 100 |- align=\"center\" |Deivi Cruz ||155 ||518 ||147 || .284||13 || 58 |- align=\"center\" |Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n || 132||509 ||130 || .255||19 ||74 |- align=\"center\" |Gabe Kapler ||130 ||416 ||102 || .245||18 || 49 |- align=\"center\" |Bobby Higginson || 107||377 ||90 || .239||12 ||46 |- align=\"center\" |Luis Polonia ||87 ||333 ||108 || .324||10 || 32 |- align=\"center\" |Karim Garc\u00eda ||96 ||288 || 69|| .240||14 || 35 |- align=\"center\" |Frank Catalanotto ||100 ||286 ||79 || .276|| 11|| 18 |- align=\"center\" |Gregg Jefferies ||70 ||205 || 41|| .200||6 || 14 |- align=\"center\" |Bill Haselman || 48||143 ||39 || .273||4 || 3 |- align=\"center\" |Kimera Bartee ||41 ||77 ||15 || .195||0 || 0 |- align=\"center\" |Brian Hunter ||18 ||55 ||13 || .236||0 || 4 |- align=\"center\" |Gabe Alvarez ||22 ||53 ||11 || .208||2 || 8 |- align=\"center\" |Jason Wood ||27 ||44 ||7 || .159||1 || 1 |- align=\"center\" |Robert Fick ||15 ||41 ||9 || .220||3 || 3 |- align=\"center\" |Luis Garc\u00eda ||8 ||9 ||1 || .111|| 0|| 0 |- align=\"center\" |Jos\u00e9 Mac\u00edas || 5||4 || 1|| .250||1 || 1 |} Note: pitchers' batting statistics not included ===Starting pitchers=== Note: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"46%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | IP ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO |- align=\"center\" |Justin Thompson || 24||142.7 || 9||11 ||5.11 || 83 |- align=\"center\" |Jeff Weaver ||30 ||163.7 ||9 ||12 ||5.55 || 114 |- align=\"center\" |Willie Blair ||39 || 134.0 ||3 ||11 ||6.85 ||82 |- align=\"center\" |Brian Moehler ||32 ||196.3 ||10 ||16 ||5.04 ||106 |- align=\"center\" |Dave Mlicki ||31 || 191.7||14 ||12 ||4.60 ||119 |- align=\"center\" |} ===Relief pitchers=== ==== Pitching ==== Note: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"46%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | IP ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SV ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO |- align=\"center\" |Todd Jones ||65 ||66.3 ||4 ||4 ||30 ||3.80 ||106 |- align=\"center\" |Masao Kida ||49 ||64.7 ||1||0 ||1 ||6.26 ||50 |- align=\"center\" |Matt Anderson ||37 ||38.0 ||2 ||1 ||0 ||5.68 ||32 |- align=\"center\" |Doug Brocail ||70 ||82.0 ||4 ||4 ||2 ||2.52 ||78 |- align=\"center\" |C.
