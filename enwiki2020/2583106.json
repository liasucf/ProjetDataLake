    "text": "Buddhamitr\u0101 (born c. 60) was a Buddhist nun from India during the Kushan Empire. She is remembered because of dated inscriptions on images of bodhisattvas and the Buddha that she erected in three cities near the Ganges river. They mark her success in attracting money and patronage to the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, the sect of Buddhism to which she belonged. ==Life and work== Buddhamitr\u0101 was born around 60 in Mathur\u0101. Her parents were wealthy Buddhists. She entered into the sangha and became a Buddhist nun. Her teacher was a monk named Bala, who belonged to the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, an early school of Buddhism. Both teacher and student were educated in the entire threefold knowledge of Buddhism (the Tripi\u1e6daka) and were noted for their efforts. Accompanied at first by a monk named Pushyavuddhi, beginning in about 117, Buddhamitr\u0101 and Bala built monuments at \u015ar\u0101vast\u012b and at S\u0101rn\u0101th. They had the help of two of the region's satraps or governors, Vanaspara and Kharapall\u0101na, the \"great satrap\". For the next six years, or until about 123, Buddhamitr\u0101 then went to Kosam, where she built several monuments. For example, one of the images at Kosam is a standing stone bodhisattva which today can be seen in the Allahabad Museum. Satya Shrava gives a translation of the inscription, originally written in Br\u0101hm\u012b characters in a mixture of the Sanskrit and Pr\u0101krit. It reads, \"In the year 2 of mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kanishka, in the 2nd month of hemanta, i.e., the winter season, on the 8th day, the image of Bodhisattva is set up by the nun Buddhamitr\u0101, well versed in the Tripitaka, at the promenade of the Lord Buddha.\" Buddhamitr\u0101 and Bala were not interested in only converting others to their religion. To quote A Rough Guide to Kushan History, \"[P]atronage, not conversion was the goal of Buddhamitra.\" She sought, successfully, money from wealthy and powerful people to promote Buddhism, and specifically for followers of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da school. The prestige of each patron enhanced the legitimacy of Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da. Her desire was to reach the leaders of the Kushan Empire. Buddhamitr\u0101 lived at the time of the Fourth Buddhist council and it is likely given her political connections and learning that she was involved.\"No women are mentioned in the sources. Yet the importance of women in inscriptions implies that some were probably involved.\" in She is a remarkable figure, because despite living in a patriarchal society she has left a mark in history where many male kings have been entirely forgotten. Her niece, who was a nun named Dhanavati (or Dhanadev\u012b), in 148 built a memorial in honor of Buddhamitr\u0101 in the city of her birth. Shrava gives a translation of the inscription: ==Record== The female gender of someone named Buddhamitr\u0101 has been known since at least the 1960s or 1970s. A Rough Guide to Kushan History says, \"The evidence for Buddhamitra comes completely from inscriptions.\" Just as other scholars have, Theo Damsteegt catalogs these inscriptions, in his case, in his 1978 doctoral dissertation, Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit, which identifies Buddhamitr\u0101 as a nun.\"...In Kosam III the donor is the nun Buddhamitr\u0101; in S\u0101rn\u0101th I\u2013II it is the monk Bala, with the same nun Buddhamitr\u0101 as one of the co-donors (S\u0101rn\u0101th I); at Set-Mahet it is the monk Bala. Both Bala and Buddhamitr\u0101 are, moreover, referred to in a Mathur\u0101 inscription which dates from the year 33 (I Ros., Pl.) and records a donation of a sister's daughter of Buddhamitr\u0101, viz. M 24.\" in Including all of the known works by and about Buddhamitr\u0101, in 1993, Satya Shrava published a book of the inscriptions of the Kushan Empire rulers of India that have dates, along with a photograph of each one. Peter Skilling refers to this historical record and to a female named Buddhamitr\u0101 in 2001, in \"Nuns, Laywomen, Donors, Goddesses: Female Roles in Early Indian Buddhism\". Thea Mohr and Jampa Tsoedren give the female gender of someone named Buddhamitr\u0101 in a footnote in their book Dignity & Discipline: Reviving Full Ordination for Buddhist Nuns (2010), which identifies Buddhamitr\u0101 as a nun, one who had committed the entire Tripitaka to memory.\"Not only the Buddhist canonical scriptures, but also inscriptions in ancient India testify to the learnedness of Buddhist nuns. One of these inscriptions indicates that a nun had performed the impressive deed of memorizing the entire Tripitaka.\" and part of the footnote: \"Inscriptions no. 38 and 925 in L\u00fcders 1973; 8 and 94 refer to the nun Buddhamitra as a tr\u00e9pitik\u00e5....\" in ==Further reading== * and ==Notes== Category:Indian Buddhists Category:Kushan Empire Category:60 births Category:Buddhist nuns Category:Buddhism and women Category:Year of death unknown Category:Indian Buddhist nuns Category:1st-century Buddhist nuns ",
