Fries Cotton Arista Mills. The 1836 Salem Cotton Mill is a three-story, brick building with a monitor roof. The 1880 mill is a three-story brick building, 14 bays long, with bracketed eaves with timber supports. A two-story roughly triangular brick building was added about 1900. The 1836 building has been converted to a hotel known as The Historic Brookstown Inn.
