    "text": "Cotton Fort was a small fortification in Melcombe, now part of the town of Weymouth, Dorset. No trace of the fort exists today. ==History== The fort was likely constructed during the reign of Henry VIII of England, although others suggest it may be Elizabethan. It took the form of a rampart, with three cannon mounted. It was constructed to the north of Melcombe, which these days is south of Weymouth railway station, but a lack of detail makes it impossible to trace the exact location. ==See also== *Block House (Melcombe) *Nothe Fort ==References== Category:Forts in Dorset Category:Buildings and structures in Weymouth, Dorset Category:History of Weymouth, Dorset Category:Former castles in England ",
