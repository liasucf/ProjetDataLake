It was originally incorporated as a village on December 31, 1947. == History == Situated along the Badger Creek, the original location of Cartwright (also known as the Badger, or Old Cartwright) was established in 1879 by pioneers following the Boundary Commission Trail. Old Cartwright began on two townsites, one owned by P.C. McKibbin, the other by J.C. Waugh. The two men admired Sir Richard Cartwright and agreed to name their communities \"Cartwright.\" Waugh's land, being directly on the Boundary Commission Trail, became the area truly considered Cartwright. In 1885, the location of Cartwright was moved 3.2 kilometres south to its present location to coincide with the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway line through that area. Cartwright's original location was along the Badger Creek and the Boundary Commission Trail and was known as the Badger, about two miles north of where it is today. Cartwright moved to its current location in 1885 with the building of the railway through this area. The community of Cartwright is located at the corner of Highway #5 and Highway #3 in the RM of Roblin, within the Province of Manitoba, in Canada. Ponderosa Days, Cartwright's annual summer celebration, is held on August long weekend. == Industry == Manitoba Pool Elevator and Federal Elevator in 1985, Cartwright.
