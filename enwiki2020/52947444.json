The nearest higher peak is Mount Temple, to the northeast. ==History== The first ascent was made in 1901 by Charles S. Thompson and G.M. Weed, with Hans Kaufmann as guide. The peak was named in 1908 by Arthur O. Wheeler on account of its great height; its name is an allusion to the Eiffel Tower. The mountain's name was made official in 1952 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. ==Geology== Eiffel Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Eiffel Peak is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.
