An 18-year-old marketing student at the University of Aleppo when the uprising began in 2011, we watch as she falls in love, gives birth to her first daughter Sama and navigates motherhood all while the conflict begins to engulf the city. She and her husband, a doctor at one of the few remaining hospitals in the city, face an agonising decision to flee to safety or stay behind to help the innocent victims of war. ==Cast== * Hamza al-Kateab * Sama al-Kateab * Waad al-Kateab ==Reception== === Critical response === On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 99% based on 95 reviews, with an average rating of 9.00/10.

Ian Freer of Empire, wrote \"It will break your heart\", and he further added, \"For Sama powerfully mixes the personal and the political to thought-provoking, emotional ends. The result is one of the best documentaries of 2019\". David Jenkins of the Little White Lies wrote, \"This tough but vital documentary depicts the savage bombardment of Aleppo from a female perspective\". Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"[For Sama] The result is a series of deeply powerful images showing the human casualties of a war that most of us witnessed from our TV sets or computer screens, but that al-Kateab and her husband lived on a daily basis for many years\". Guy Lodge of the Variety wrote, \"This ragged, remarkable act of cinematic witnessing sees a young woman finding her voice \u2014 as an activist, as an artist and as a parent \u2014 above the crashing, whistling din of warfare. Amid a surfeit of devastating reports from the ruins, it\u2019s one we haven\u2019t yet heard\". === Awards and nominations === For Sama made history by becoming the BAFTA's most-nominated feature documentary.
