    "text": "Dragonfly is the second studio album by English band Strawbs. It contains the lengthy and rather progressive ballad \"The Vision of the Lady of the Lake\" describing the hardships of a boatman who encounters and battles all kinds of mystical creatures on a lake, with a sword that was given to him by the lady of the lake. The album marked the first collaboration of Rick Wakeman with the band; he would eventually join them on their next album, Just a Collection of Antiques and Curios, in 1970. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Dave Cousins \u2013 Vocals, Acoustic guitar, Dulcimer, Chinese piano, Percussion *Tony Hooper \u2013 Vocals, Acoustic & Electric Guitars, Tambourine, Percussion *Claire Deniz \u2013 Cello *Ron Chesterman \u2013 Double bass ;Additional personnel : *Tony Visconti \u2013 Recorder on Dragonfly & Young Again *Rick Wakeman \u2013 Piano on The Vision of The Lady of the Lake *Paul Brett \u2013 Lead guitar on The Vision of The Lady of the Lake *Bjarne Rostvold \u2013 Drums on The Vision of The Lady of the Lake ==Recording== Recorded at Rosenberg Lydteknik, Copenhagen with additional work at Morgan Studios, London.
