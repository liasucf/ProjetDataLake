    "text": "Benjamin James Sobieski (born May 3, 1979) is a former American football player. He attended Mahtomedi Senior High School and the University of Iowa before being drafted in the fifth round of the 2003 NFL Draft (number 151 overall) by the Buffalo Bills. A Parade and SuperPrep All-American who also lettered in track and hockey, Sobieski's career was hampered by injuries. He spent six years at Iowa under two head coaches (Hayden Fry and Kirk Ferentz), missing both the 1999 and 2000 seasons due to shoulder injuries. After being released by Buffalo, Sobieski was signed to the practice squad of the San Francisco 49ers. He was brought up to the regular team, but never played due to injury. ==References== ==External links== *NFL player profile *Pro Football Reference profile Category:1979 births Category:American football offensive guards Category:Buffalo Bills players Category:Iowa Hawkeyes football players Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:People from Mahtomedi, Minnesota ",
