The film was released on 4 March 2016 in the United States. ==Plot== Set in 1985, war photographer Avery Taggert (Zo\u00eb Bell) has built a solid career with her stark and honest imagery, all the while remaining emotionally distant from her subjects. When she embeds in the jungles of Colombia with a squad of missionaries led by a beloved and charismatic Spaniard known as \"El Guero\" (Nacho Vigalondo), she finds herself in the middle of a conflict as violent as any she's photographed. One night, she happens upon El Guero committing a heinous atrocity, capturing the vile act on film, an image with the potential to discredit and destroy El Guero. Knowing this brilliant psychopath will employ every tactic at his disposal to destroy that photograph - and the photographer who took it - Avery flees into the harsh jungle with nothing but the camera hanging around her neck to escape from missionaries twisted into violent guerrillas by the madman intent on destroying all enemies. ==Cast== * Zo\u00eb Bell as Avery Taggert, a photographer * Nacho Vigalondo as Guillermo, leader of El Guero * Francisco Barreiro as Tomas * Sheila Vand as Marianna * Tenoch Huerta Mej\u00eda as Alejo * Dominic Rains as Daniel * Kevin Pollak as Daniel * Jason Canela as Sebastian * Nancy Gomez as Luna ==Release== The film was released on 4 March 2016 in limited in the United States, and release in DVD in select countries. ==Reception== The film critics aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 27% based on 17 reviews and an average rating of 5.3/10, calling it:\"A competent but unmemorable B-movie that eschews any real political content in favor of simple, brutal survival melodrama with scant room for surprises in plot, character or directorial style\". ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2015 films Category:American films Category:American action thriller films Category:English-language films ",
