    "text": "Carnival of Fear is a 1993 fantasy horror novel by J. Robert King, set in the world of Ravenloft, and based on the Dungeons & Dragons game. ==Plot summary== In a centuries-old grand carnival in the realm of l'Morai run by the Puppetmaster, the apparent murder of a carnival dwarf leads to a trial to find the killer. ==Reception== A reviewer from Publishers Weekly comments that King \"offers a simple but effective message about the evils of scapegoating in his fantasy-horror tale [...] King's careful progress from a basic murder to a much larger mystery, which ultimately encompasses the entire carnival, gives the book the momentum needed to keep the pages turning.\"Kaganoff, Penny (June 14, 1993). \"Paperbacks \u2013 Carnival of Fear by J.
