The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1980. ==Overview== Following the Taika reforms of 645 AD and the establishment of the Ritsury\u014d system, Japan was administratively divided into provinces which were further subdivided into districts, each with an administrative center and tax warehouses designed per a common template. The Shida County Administrative Complex site was discovered during construction work on a housing development in 1977 and was excavated starting in 1980. The foundations of 30 buildings, with a well, gates, and roads were uncovered. The site was compactly arranged on narrow alluvial land measuring 80 meters east- west and 60 meters north-south. The complex was destroyed in rebuilt several times through the Heian period. Artifacts included roof tiles and numerous items, such as pottery, wooden tags, and tableware with the word \"Shida\" written in black ink. Together with the layout of the ruins, it was determined that this was the government center for Shida County from the early 8th to late 9th century. The housing development project was cancelled, and site was made into an archaeological park, with reconstructed buildings and a museum.
