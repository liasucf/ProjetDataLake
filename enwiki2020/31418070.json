    "text": "Keralup is a suburb straddling the southern boundary of the metropolitan area of Perth, Western Australia, on the eastern side of the Kwinana Freeway, and consists entirely of a government strategic landholding. The suburb will ultimately contain 90,000 people, with the majority of development being on the eastern side of the Serpentine River. The name was chosen from a newspaper poll; it was proposed by local Nyoongar leader, Trevor Walley, as it was the name of a pool in the Serpentine River in which he and his friends played as children. == References == *Department of Housing: Keralup *City of Rockingham: Keralup Category:Suburbs of Perth, Western Australia * ",
