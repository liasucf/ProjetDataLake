    "text": "{| |} The Nieuport-Delage NiD 50 HB.4 was a twin-engined bomber / reconnaissance floatplane, designed in the latter half of the 1920s, to the 1928 HB.4 specification from the Service Technique de l'A\u00e9ronautique (STA\u00e9), for a four-seat seaplane bomber. Development was cancelled before the first prototype was completed. ==Development== Issued in January 1928, the STA\u00e9 published an offshore torpedo bomber seaplane HB.4 specification. Nieuport- Astra responded and exhibited the partially complete NiD 50 HB.4 at the 1928 Paris Aero Salon. The aircraft was a large monoplane skinned entirely with light alloy sheet supported on two long all-metal floats and powered by two Gnome & Rh\u00f4ne 9A Jupiter radial engines. The 4 crew members were to have consisted of a gunner in the nose, pilot, navigator and gunner in the rear fuselage. ==Specifications (NiD-50 HB.4) == Nieuport-Delage NiD 50 HB.4 3-view drawing from L'A\u00e9ronautique June,1928 ==References== Category:1920s French aircraft ",
