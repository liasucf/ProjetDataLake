    "text": "Funkentelechy vs. the Placebo Syndrome is a funk album by Parliament, released in 1977 (see 1977 in music). It is a loose concept album warning the listener of falling into the \"Placebo Syndrome,\" which according to George Clinton is consumerism, and listening to disco music, which he saw as a simplification of funk music in attempt to gain commercial success. The album spawned the R&B; number #1 single in \"Flash Light\", which features a funky synthesizer bass line played on a Minimoog by keyboardist Bernie Worrell. The album became Parliament's fourth consecutive gold album and second platinum album. The song \"Sir Nose d'Voidoffunk (Pay Attention \u2013 B3M)\" contains nursery rhymes \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\" and \"Three Blind Mice\"; the lyrics were changed to make reference to drug use. The original vinyl release contained a 22\" by 33\" inch poster of the character \"Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk\", as well as an 8-page comic book that explains the concept behind the LP. Both the poster and the comic book were illustrated by Overton Loyd. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Vocals \u2013 George Clinton, Ray Davis, Glenn Goins, Garry Shider, Debbie Wright, Jeanette Washington, Lynn Mabry, Dawn Silva, Cordell Mosson, Mallia Franklin was not included on liner notes. *Keyboards and synthesizers \u2013 Bernie Worrell (Keyboard bass on \"Flash Light\") *Guitars \u2013 Michael Hampton, Glenn Goins, Garry Shider; Phelps Collins on \"Flash Light\" *Bass guitar \u2013 Cordell Mosson, Bootsy Collins *Drums and percussion \u2013 Jerome Brailey; Bootsy Collins on \"Flash Light\" *Horns \u2013 Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker, Rick Gardner, Richard Griffith, Clay Lawrey, Darryl Dixon, Valerie Drayton, Danny Cortez *Extra- extra terrestrial funk bearing alumni-Strokers, Chokers, Clappers and Chanters \u2013 Bootsy Collins, Phelps Collins, Frank Waddy, Rick Gilmore, Gary Cooper, Robert Johnson, Billy Nelson, Ron Ford, Lou Goldman, Joel Johnson, Bootsy's Rubber Band, The Brides of Funkenstein, Parlet, and The Horny Horns.
