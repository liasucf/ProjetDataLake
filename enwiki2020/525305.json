    "text": "Man on Fire is a 2004 action thriller film directed by Tony Scott from a screenplay by Brian Helgeland, and based on the 1980 novel of the same name by A. J. Quinnell. The novel, which was based on true accounts, had previously been adapted into a feature film in 1987. In this film, Denzel Washington portrays John Creasy, a despondent, alcoholic former Special Activities Division operative/U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance officer-turned bodyguard, who goes on a revenge rampage after his charge, nine-year-old Lupita \"Pita\" Ramos (Dakota Fanning), is abducted in Mexico City. The supporting cast includes Christopher Walken, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini, Marc Anthony, Rachel Ticotin and Mickey Rourke. The film was a box office success despite mixed reviews. ==Plot== John W. Creasy (Washington) is former Force Recon Marine and assassin who comes to Mexico to visit his old friend and brother-in-arms, Paul Rayburn (Walken). Rayburn recognizes his friend's poor physical and emotional state and convinces him to take a bodyguard position to give him something to do. Creasy reluctantly agrees, and is later offered the job by Samuel Ramos (Anthony), a wealthy automaker in Mexico City whose young daughter Lupita \u201cPita\u201d Ramos (Fanning) requires a bodyguard before she can return to school and the kidnapping insurance policy takes effect. While initially uninterested in befriending Pita, Creasy reaches a low point in his depression and attempts to commit suicide with his own gun. The bullet in his gun misfires, however, and Creasy is given a second chance. He soon bonds with Pita, and his friendship with her imparts a renewed sense of purpose in his life. Noticing that Pita, a competitive swimmer, becomes startled by the starter gun at her swim meets, Creasy begins to coach her at home, and she gradually learns to react to the starter gun and dive into the water instead of flinching, eventually winning a swim meet with his training. One day, while waiting for Pita outside of her piano lesson, Creasy notices suspicious activity, including a car with two men circling the area, and two uniformed Federal Police officers who block the street without explanation and appear out of place. As Pita emerges from the lesson, Creasy realizes the danger and yells at Pita to run, but she freezes in fear and confusion. The car Creasy noticed pulls up and the men attempt to grab Pita, but Creasy fires his gun in the air, causing her to react and run away. Creasy attempts to fend off the attackers, killing three (the two police officers and a third kidnapper), and wounding another, but he is critically wounded himself. Pita runs back to him crying and is subsequently abducted by the remaining kidnappers. While recovering from his injuries, AFI Agent Miguel Manzano (Giannini) has Creasy relocated to a veterinarian clinic for his protection, explaining to Rayburn that he believes the corrupt police will want revenge on Creasy for the deaths of their colleagues. When he comes to he is questioned by Manzano though, Creasy refuses to divulge any information despite recognizing one of the suspected kidnappers. He then meets reporter Mariana Garcia Guerrero (Ticotin), a reporter for La Reforma, a newspaper that often receives threats for exposing corruption. She offers to help Creasy in his own investigation, knowing how intertwined the kidnapping rings and the police are. The ransom drop for Pita fails when the kidnappers are ambushed by rival criminals. The leader of the kidnappers, \"The Voice,\" is enraged at the death of his nephew during the botched drop and informs Pita's mother, Lisa (Mitchell), that Pita will be lost to her and Samuel forever as retribution. Creasy uses this lead to wage war on the kidnapping ring and police corruption that are responsible for Pita's apparent death. He successfully tracks down, interrogates, and kills the getaway driver, officer Jorge Gonzalez (Zaragosa), followed by \u201cJersey Boy\u201d who acted as a middle man, and Victor Fuentes (Ochoa) who is the head of the anti-kidnapping division with the police and coordinated the ransom drop. From Fuentes, Creasy learns that most of the ransom money had been stolen before the ambush at the drop and that Jordan Kalfus (Rourke) Samuel's lawyer who suggested the kidnapping insurance, loaded the money into the vehicle selected to bring Samuel to the drop. When inspecting Kalfus\u2019 residence, he discovers Kalfus dead in his swimming pool and a fax with suspicious bank account information leading him back to Samuel. When Creasy confronts Samuel and Lisa, Samuel explains that his father left him a ruined auto empire full of debt, and that Kalfus recommended arranging a kidnapping that he could claim the insurance payout for and pay his debts; $5 million would go to Samuel, and the rest would be split between the kidnappers and Kalfus. They were promised that Pita would be unharmed. After the drop went bad, Samuel held Kalfus responsible for Pita's apparent death and killed him in a rage. A horrified Lisa, who was unaware of Samuel's involvement, tells Creasy to \u201ckill him or {she} will\u201d. Creasy leaves his gun and the bullet that he used to attempt suicide with Samuel, telling him \u201cA bullet never lies\u201d, and suggesting Samuel atone for his sins. After he leaves, Samuel loads the bullet into the gun and places it to his head. This time, the bullet fires, killing him. Creasy then learns from Guerrero that an ATM card he recovered earlier from Jersey Boy's co-conspirators is linked to a man who lives in the barrio on the edge of the city. At the same time, Manzano's people, acting on Guerrero's information, infiltrate the man's home and find a picture of \"The Voice\". Despite a death threat, Guerrero runs a front-page story in her paper headlined, \"Fear has a Voice\", revealing the ringleader to be a man named Daniel Sanchez. The man linked to the ATM card turns out to be Daniel's brother Aurelio. Creasy breaks into the home and takes Aurelio and his family prisoner, despite being shot in the chest in the process. Creasy calls Daniel to tell him he's going to kill his entire family. However, Daniel reveals that Pita is still alive, and offers to trade her for his brother and Creasy himself. Creasy agrees to meet Daniel's men along the highway near Puebla. He crosses the overpass between them on foot, meeting Pita in the middle. He says goodbye and assures her that he loves her before sending her to Lisa waiting for her back by his car. Creasy brings Aurelio to Daniel's men and surrenders to them, but succumbs to his wounds while in transit. Meanwhile, Manzano tracks Daniel to his home where he kills him, officially stating that Daniel died during the course of arrest. ==Cast== * Denzel Washington as John W.

J. Quinnell, into a film in 1983. Journalist Paul Davies theorized that movie producers likely believed that Scott, whose only directorial work as of the time was 1983's The Hunger, lacked the experience to direct this as his second film. The novel was first adapted into the 1987 film Man on Fire, starring Scott Glenn as Creasy. This movie, like the novel, was set in Italy, then a major center of kidnapping. When a remake was first under consideration, producer Arnon Milchan (who also produced the 1987 version) looked at Michael Bay and Antoine Fuqua to direct, before asking Scott if he was still interested.Davies, Paul.

Retrieved on January 18, 2011. \"Creasy is hired to serve as a bodyguard for the Balletto family of Naples (although since the film is being shot in Mexico City perhaps the story's locale has been changed since this draft was written).\" and \"Rika Balletto (Mitchell), the beautiful wife of struggling but well-to-do businessman Ettore, convinces her aloof husband to hire protection for their precocious young daughter Pinta (Fanning).\" Scott argued that if the setting would be Italy, then the film would have to be a period piece, since by the 2000s kidnappings became a rare occurrence in Italy. Mexico City became the setting of the 2004 film because Mexico City had a high kidnapping rate, and due to other reasons. As a result, the character Rika Balletto was renamed Lisa Martin Ramos, and Pinta Balletto was renamed Lupita \"Pita\" Ramos. Ettore Balletto became Samuel Ramos. Robert De Niro was originally offered the role of Creasy. Prior to his death, Marlon Brando was the original choice to play Rayburn.Man on Fire (2004) - Trivia, IMDb, retrieved Tuesday 16th September 2014. ==Reception== Man On Fire opened in the U.S. on April 23, 2004 in 2,980 theaters and grossed $22,751,490 with an average of $7,634 and ranking #1 at the box office.

Davies argues that \"most critics missed\" Creasy not taking \"sadistic pleasure\" in the killings since he kills to get information to get to all of the people involved in the kidnapping of Pita Ramos, and does not like harming innocent parties.Davies, Paul.
