Bridget was a daughter of Sir James Harington (1542-1614) of Ridlington, Rutland, and Frances Sapcote (d. 1599) daughter and co-heir of Robert Sapcote of Elton, Huntingdonshire.Simon Healy, 'HARINGTON, Sir James (c.1555-1614)', The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1604-1629, ed. Andrew Thrush and John P. Ferris, 2010. She was a cousin of the influential courtier Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford. ==Marriage and the court== In 1598 she married Sir Anthony Markham (1577-1604) of Sedgebrook, Lincolnshire. He had been educated at Caius College, Cambridge and Gray's Inn.John Venn, J. A. Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses: A Biographical List of All Known Students, vol. 1 (Cambridge, 2011), p. 141. They were married at Ridlington, in Rutland, by the Rector, Thomas Gibson. She had four children. He died on 10 December 1604.Arthur Roland Maddison, Lincolnshire Wills: 1600-1617 (Lincoln, 1891), p. 9-10 \"Anthonie Markham of Sydebrooke\". After her husband's death, Bridget became a lady of the bedchamber to Anne of Denmark, Queen consort of King James VI and I. This appointment was due to the influence of her cousin the Countess of Bedford. She continued to manage her lands at Sedgebrook. Bridget, Lady Markham, died at Twickenham Park, a house belonging to the Countess of Bedford, on 4 May 1609. A relation, and fellow courtier and prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the Countess of Bedford, Cecily Bulstrode was also ill at Twickenham, and she died on 6 August 1609. ==Legacies and Elegies== A Latin inscription at St Mary's Church, Twickenham records her close friendship with Lucy, Countess of Bedford, her appointment to the queen's privy chamber, her marriage and death on 4 May 1609.Richard Stutely Cobbett, Memorials of Twickenham (London, 1872), p. 86.

John Donne's poem alludes to Markham's mortal remains, her 'flesh' refined by her death like Chinese porcelain clay in an alembic to reveal the precious stones that comprise her soul: > But as the tide doth wash the slimy beach, > And leaves embroidered works upon the sand, > So is her flesh refined by death's cold hand. > As men of China, after an age's stay > Do take up porcelain, where they buried clay; > So at this grave, her limbeck, which refines > The diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls, and mines, > Of which this flesh was, her soul shall inspire > Flesh of such stuff, as God, when his last fire > Annuls this world, to recompense it, shall, > Make and name then, th'elixir of this all.John Carey, \"John Donne: The Major > Works\" (Oxford, 1990), p. 181 Bridget's eldest son Robert Markham of Sedgebrook (1597\u20131667) was a Royalist; a younger son Henry fought for Parliament.M. P., 'Lady Markham', Notes and Queries, 3rd Series, 25 June, 1864, pp. 522-3. As recorded by the inscription at Twickenham, and in her will, she had two more children, John and Frances. Bridget's will was \"published\" on 3 May 1609, the day before she died. She hoped Frances would inherit and use her \"childbed linen\" at Sedgebrook, and her sons would go to Cambridge University. She left a legacy of \u00a320 to Catherine Widmerpoole, a servant of the Countess of Bedford. She gave her sister Anne Harington, Lady Foljambe, a locket with a picture of the Countess of Bedford, and her latest husband Sir John Molyneux of Teversal was made her administrator. To the Countess of Bedford she left her coach and mares, with the household silver she had pawned in London, a crimson velvet gown and a suite of tawny clothes embroidered with cloth of silver, and Bedford was to look after Frances with an allowance of \u00a350 yearly. She gave her fellow courtier Jane Meautys (1581-1659) her ruby and diamond buttons. She wanted three memento mori rings with \"death's heads\" bought as gifts for Sir Henry Carey, the poet Benjamin Rudyerd, and John Gill.'Will of Briget Markham, Widow of Sudbrooke, Lincolnshire', TNA PROB 11/114/485. Rudyerd was a contributor to the \"Newes, from Anywhence\" anthology, with Markham's kinswoman Cecily Bulstrode, and married another cousin Elizabeth Harington.Julie Crawford, Mediatrix: Women, Politics, and Literary Production in Early Modern England (Oxford, 2018), pp. 148-9: Peter Redford, The Burley Manuscript (Manchester, 2017), pp. 53-4.
