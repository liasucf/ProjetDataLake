He studied law, and after this became a civil servant in the Kingdom of Bavaria. He served as a prosecutor in Neustadt an der Weinstra\u00dfe, and later in F\u00fcrth.

As the prime minister of Bavaria, Siebert did not have the power and authority his predecessors had in the Weimar Republic. In this position, he was engaged in a power struggle with the Reichstatthalter of Bavaria, Franz Ritter von Epp, which he won. In May 1933, Siebert arrived in Passau for the opening of the Ostmarkmuseum.Anna Rosmus: Hitlers Nibelungen, Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 69ff He also held the posts of Minister of Finances (1933\u20131942) and for Economy (1933-1934/1936-1942). He initiated the so-called \"Siebert Program\" to fight unemployment in Bavaria. The program turned out to be insufficient to create new employment due to lack of funds within the Bavarian government and support from the German government.Hitler's Economy: Nazi Work Creation Programs, 1933\u20131936 google book review, author: Dan P. Silverman, publisher: Harvard University Press, Page 85 Siebert also had personal orders from Hitler to look after the restoration of all castles in Germany and was especially interested in the restoration of the historical town of Rothenburg ob der Tauber from 1937 to 1941.
