The collection was soon carried at national retailers Neiman Marcus, Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, and Marshall Field's; United Kingdom-based Harrods and Harvey Nichols; as well as the United States specialty stores Stanley Korshak, Mitchells, Richards, and Linda Dresner.
