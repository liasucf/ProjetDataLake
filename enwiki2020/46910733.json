    "text": "The 2009 NCAA Bowling Championship was the sixth annual tournament to determine the national champion of women's NCAA collegiate ten-pin bowling. The tournament was played at Super Bowl Lanes in Canton, Michigan during April 2009. Nebraska defeated Central Missouri in the championship match, 4 games to 1, to win their third national title. ==Qualification== Since there is only one national collegiate championship for women's bowling, all NCAA bowling programs (whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III) were eligible. A total of 8 teams were invited to contest this championship, which consisted of a modified double-elimination style tournament. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team ! Appearance !
