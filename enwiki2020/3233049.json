The band has been inactive since October 2008. ==History== The band released their first CD Arrows on Candlelight Records in 2006.Review, Allmusic They received excellent reviews from national newspapers television and radio in Norway. When Stonegard was but one of many bands trying to make it, one of their means to promote themselves were through the Norwegian website NRK Ur\u00f8rt which helps unsigned bands, singers and musicians. Their page was quite popular, and it helped them make a name for themselves. The Stonegard page is now taken down, as they are no longer an unsigned band. Their motto is \"Mer metal til folket\", which means \"More metal to the people\". Stonegard is also strongly against drugs. Several Stonegard music videos have run on the popular Norwegian TV show \"Svisj\" and the pay-channel ZTV. From Arrows, the songs \"Barricades\", \"Arrows\" and \"Hunter\" received air time throughout 2005, as did From Dusk Til Doom, the title track of their second album, in 2008.
