    "text": "James Sunter BA (1839 \u2013 10 July 1909), commonly referred to as Canon Sunter, was rector of St Paul's Church, Adelaide, from 1890 to 1909. ==History== Sunter was born in Yorkshire and educated at St John's College, Hurstpierpoint. He was an apt and conscientious student, winning bursaries and exhibitions that helped pay his way through Durham University, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1877. He was ordained deacon in 1871, and priest in 1872 by the Bishop of Durham. He was appointed curate, serving at Wallsend 1871\u20131873; Tynemouth 1873\u20131875; Holy Trinity, North Shields, 1875\u20131879 and acting chaplain of Wellesley training ship in 1875. He was appointed vicar of St Anthony's church, Newcastle-on-Tyne, serving 1879\u20131890 and as honorary canon of St Nicholas' Cathedral from 1887 to 1890, when he was offered the incumbency of St Paul's, Adelaide by Bishop Kennion. He arrived in South Australia by the RMS Ormuz with his family on 4 November 1890, succeeding Rev. J. W. Owen, resigned, and was inducted by Bishop Kennion on 9 November 1890. He found the church building in need of a great deal of attention, and with that well underway, had the pipe organ renovated at a cost of over \u00a3500. Extensive additions were made to the Sunday-school buildings, so that something like \u00a32,000 was spent during his incumbency, all without increasing the church debt. Sunter's great ambition was completion of the church tower in time for the church Jubilee in 1910, the foundation stone having been laid by Sir Richard MacDonnell in 1860, but he did not live to see it completed. His death, after a few days' illness, was quite unexpected. He had reached the Biblical span of seventy years, quite unknown to most of his parishioners, who thought of him as a much younger man, carrying out his duties in a vigorous and conscientious way. He was a great believer in religious education, and had contributed greatly to the success of St Paul's school for girls and the Pulteney Street school for boys (later Pulteney Grammar), for both of which he taught regularly. He was also a governor of St Peter's College and on the council of St Barnabas College. He also believed in Bible reading in State schools, and regularly lobbied Parliament on the subject. He actively promoted the welfare of young people by the formation of guilds and societies, which he was tireless in promoting. He acted as examining chaplain for Bishop Harmer from 1896 to 1905, and in the later part of his career was appointed chaplain to the Yatala Labor Prison (\"The Stockade\"). He was believed to have a positive influence on those prisoners with whom he came in contact, making visits there every Sunday and Thursday, and maintained contact with many after their discharge. He was a founder of the Lady Kintore Cottages, a charity for supporting widows and deserted wives. His eulogy was read by Bishop Nutter Thomas, who preached at St. Paul's Church from the text \"Well done, good and faithful servant.\" He referred to Sunter's theological treatises, and to the literary outputs of his predecessors, Dean Russell, who died on 20 May 1886, and the Rev. John W. Owen BA, who was also an author. ==Bibliography== Sunter, James The Doctrine of the Trinity \u2014 Not Opposed to Reason and Scripture ==Family== James Sunter (1839\u20131909) married Miss Hepworth, of Bradford, in England.
