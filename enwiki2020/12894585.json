The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 1998. Downloaded on 18 September 2015. Leaf Almost extinct species of this tree has been rediscovered after a gap of 180 years from a sacred grove in Kollam district. Scientists at the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI) have identified the tree as Madhuca diplostemon (family Sapotaceae), a threatened species of the Western Ghats whose specimen was first collected in 1835. The lone mature tree was located at the Koonayil Ayiravilli Siva temple at Paravur, Kollam, Kerala. Locally it was believed to be the common attilippa. Shailaja Kumari, one of the authors of this paper, had collected a specimen and brought it to the JNTBGRI two years ago as part of her Ph.D. dissertation. Survey in other sacred groves in Kollam district failed to find another tree of the species. Since the species is represented by only one specimen in a single locality, it is eligible to be categorized as 'Critically Endangered' by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), the JNTBGRI has noted. ==References== Category:Endemic flora of India (region) diplostemon Category:Endangered plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
