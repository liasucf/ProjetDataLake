    "text": "The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is an annual programming competition for secondary school students in Canada, organized by the Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing at the University of Waterloo. Stage 1 is written at high schools and can be written in the programming language of the students' choice, with only a few, such as Maple and Mathematica, disallowed. There are two levels of problems presented, Junior and Senior. The top 20 (or so) students in the Senior division are invited to the University of Waterloo to participate in Stage 2, the Canadian Computing Olympiad (CCO). CCO participants are restricted to languages permitted at the IOI, which currently includes only Java, C and C++. (Pascal was discontinued in 2019). The CCO is used to select students to represent Canada at the IOI. The questions in the CCC are algorithmic in nature, designed to test a student's ability to design and code algorithms rather than their knowledge of APIs or language-specific features. Stage 2 is more difficult than Stage 1, but still easier than the IOI. The problems generally have memory or time constraints, forcing the programmer to find efficient solutions to earn full marks. The contests are also open to students from Hong Kong (since 2005) and Beijing (since 2007), although they are not eligible to participate on the Canadian IOI team. ==Contest Stages== ===Stage 1=== The contest is three hours long. There are five questions, each worth 15 points, for a total of 75 points. The grading is done on the CCC Grader. The algorithms used in the Junior competition ranges from straightforward, simple loops and flow control structure, and sometimes recursion. The tasks in the Senior competition are generally more difficult than the Junior competition, ranging from simple implementation to advanced techniques such as dynamic programming. ===Canadian Computing Olympiad (CCO)=== The CCO is two days long, with three hours to do three questions each day. There are six questions, each weighted 25 points. Contestants' combined stage 1 and CCO scores are used to determine final scores for the Canadian Computing Competition. Bronze, silver, and gold medals are awarded, with each competitor receiving a medal; winners of gold medals are invited to represent the Canadian team at the IOI. ==See also== * Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing * ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest * DWITE ==External links== *CCC Website *Solutions to Stage One Problems Category:Programming contests ",
