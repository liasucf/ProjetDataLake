Most of the auditions were held at the GMA Network's headquarters and at SM Supermalls throughout the Philippines. The pilot episode was aired on March 20, 2004. Like the senior version, the same rules were applied in selecting the Ultimate Survivors. This junior version of StarStruck is shown only on weekdays; Mondays to Thursdays would be tests and Fridays would be the elimination night. It became an emotional journey for the kids who had to leave the show. Nonetheless, they thoroughly enjoyed the workshops. The show held it's the Final Judgment on June 26, 2004, at the Aliw Theater. ==Selection process== In the spin-off year of the reality-talent search, out of hundreds who auditioned nationwide, only the top 100 were chosen for the first cut.

The Final 14K underwent various workshops and training in order to develop their personalities, talents, and charisma. Every week, one or two hopefuls from the junior final 14 may have to say goodbye until only four remain. Those who were eliminated were dubbed as the juniors StarStruck Avengers. The Final 4K will vie for the coveted the junior Ultimate Survivors titles, the juniors Ultimate Male Survivor and Ultimate Female Survivor, both of them would receive P1,000,000 pesos each plus an exclusive management contract from GMA Network.
