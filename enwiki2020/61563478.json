The opening ceremony was reportedly inspired by the opening ceremonies of the 2017 Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The organizers announced plans to conduct a digital lighting of the flame during the event but added that they have a backup plan for a \"normal, traditional opening ceremony\".

Collaborating with Ryan Cayabyab, he performed a remix of his troupe's song rendered in Filipino traditional instruments and orchestral accompaniment. Previously the organizers negotiated with another Filipino-American artist, Bruno Mars, to do the same. In August 2019, organizers planned to have local artists Lea Salonga and Arnel Pineda perform in the opening ceremony. However, on November 25, Salonga announced that she will not be able to perform due to her prior commitments with Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Pineda was also unable to perform. ==Preparations== Organizers are coordinating with the Department of Transportation regarding logistics for the games including the possible closure of the North Luzon Expressway to the public for 12 hours leading to the opening ceremony.
