Meanwhile, Stoke City ended their nine-year wait for top flight promotion by attaining First Division status after winning an impressive 56 points over the campaign. Hull City and Brentford were also promoted; meanwhile Everton won their second-ever FA Cup; they defeated Manchester City 3-0 in the final, with lower league Walsall having surprisingly knocked out Arsenal in an earlier round. ==Events== 5 November 1932 - Gillespie Road station on the London Underground - the station local to Arsenal Stadium - is renamed to Arsenal (Highbury Hill), on the suggestion of Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman. By 1960, the station would become Arsenal tube station. It is the only Tube station named directly after a football club.Several tube stations, including and , share their names with football clubs, but only Arsenal was named directly after a club rather than the associated area. ==Honours== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"width:15em\"|Competition!!style=\"width:15em\"|Winner!!style=\"width:15em\"|Runner- up |- |First Division||Arsenal (2)||Aston Villa |- |Second Division||Stoke City||Tottenham Hotspur |- |Third Division North||Hull City||Wrexham |- |Third Division South||Brentford||Exeter City |- |FA Cup||Everton (2)||Manchester City |- |Charity Shield||Everton||Newcastle United |- |Home Championship|||| |} Notes = Number in parentheses is the times that club has won that honour. * indicates new record for competition ==Football League== ===First Division=== ===Second Division=== ===Third Division North=== ===Third Division South=== ===Top goalscorers=== First Division *Jack Bowers (Derby County) \u2013 35 goals Second Division *Ted Harper (Preston North End) \u2013 37 goals Third Division North *Bill McNaughton (Hull City) \u2013 39 goals Third Division South *Clarrie Bourton (Coventry City) \u2013 40 goals ==Notes== ==References== ",
