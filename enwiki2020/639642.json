    "text": "\"I'll Be There for You\" is a song recorded by American duo The Rembrandts. It is best known as the main theme song to the NBC sitcom Friends, which was broadcast from 1994 to 2004. The song was also released as the first single from the group's third studio album LP, reaching the top 10 in Australia, New Zealand and Norway, as well as in Ireland and the United Kingdom in both 1995 and 1997. In Canada, the song reached number one for five weeks and was the highest-selling single of 1995, while in the United States, the song reached number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart for eight weeks. ==Background== \"I'll Be There for You\" was co-written by Friends producers David Crane and Marta Kauffman, Kauffman's husband, composer Michael Skloff, and songwriter Allee Willis, along with Phil S\u014dlem and Danny Wilde, both of the Rembrandts. The original theme, which is under one minute long, was later re-recorded as a three-minute pop song. After Nashville program director Charlie Quinn, along with radio announcer and music director Tom Peace, looped the original short version into a full-length track and broadcast it on radio station WYHY, it became so popular that they had to re-record it. \"Our record label said we had to finish the song and record it. There was no way to get out of it,\" lead singer Phil S\u014dlem said. ==Critical reception== In 2009, the song was listed by Blender as one of the \"50 Worst Songs Ever\". On the other hand, several magazines have listed the song as one of the best TV theme songs, including Paste, Complex, and Observer. ==Chart performance== When \"I'll Be There for You\" was released in 1995, it topped the US Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart for eight weeks and also peaked atop the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary and Mainstream Top 40 charts. On the Billboard Hot 100, it reached number 17 as a double A-side with \"This House Is Not a Home\". The song experienced the best commercial success in Canada, where it peaked at number one for five consecutive weeks and was the best-selling single of 1995. In the United Kingdom, it reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, and it peaked at the same position on the Irish Singles Chart the same year. In Scotland, it topped the country's singles chart. While the song did not immediately make a significant commercial impact in Australia, peaking at number 86 in October 1995, it soon re-entered the ARIA Singles Chart in August 1996 and peaked at number three on the week of October 13, spending a total of 20 weeks in the top 50. In 1997, when re-released in Europe, the song reached the top 10 in Ireland and the United Kingdom once more, placing two positions shy of its number-three peak in both countries. This re-release also saw the song reach the top 40 in Flemish Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. ==Music video== The video features the band performing in a studio while the cast members of Friends join in. ==Track listing== European CD maxi-single # \"I'll Be There for You\" \u2013 3:09 # \"Fixin' to Blow\" \u2013 5:03 # \"Just the Way It Is, Baby\" \u2013 4:06 # \"Snippets Medley\" \u2013 6:46 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1995\u20131997) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |20 |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |10 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1995) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM) |1 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) |24 |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |52 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |42 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |22 |} {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1996) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |24 |} {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1997) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) |56 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |50 |} ==Certifications== ==Cover versions== * American pop rock band The Goo Goo Dolls recorded their own version of this song which contained slightly altered lyrics, and a more upbeat tempo, rockier sound, as well as a glockenspiel in the rhythm track. * Yakko, Wakko, and Dot parodied the theme song as \"We Won't Ever Leave\" during a 1997 Animaniacs episode entitled \"Acquaintances\" (which is itself a spoof of Friends). * American punk rock band Pink Lincolns covered this song under the title \"Friends\" for a 1997 compilation album titled Show & Tell. * British girl pop band Loose Chippins covered this song on a single which failed to reach the charts. * Fictional American band Alvin and the Chipmunks covered this song for their 2007 video game Alvin and the Chipmunks. * \"Weird Al\" Yankovic had planned to record a parody for his Bad Hair Day album called \"Theme for Home Improvement or I'll Repair For You\". Although the Rembrandts were fine with the parody idea, the producers of Friends were not, fearing that the show's theme would be overexposed. \"Theme for Home Improvement\" is nevertheless a concert favorite. * Meghan Trainor covered the song on September 22, 2019 to celebrate for the Friends 25th Anniversary at the Empire State Building light show. ==In popular culture== The 2013 comedy film We're the Millers, which stars Jennifer Aniston, features a (staged) blooper during the credits where Jason Sudeikis flips through radio stations and ends up on \"I'll Be There for You\". Sudeikis, Emma Roberts, and Will Poulter begin singing the song as Aniston covers her face laughing. On the 25th anniversary of the show, Jonas Brothers appeared in a music video of the theme song featuring Priyanka Chopra, Sophie Turner and Danielle Jonas. ==See also== * List of number-one singles of 1995 (Canada) * List of number-one adult contemporary singles of 1995 (U.S.) * List of Billboard Mainstream Top 40 number-one songs of the 1990s ==References== ==External links== * Category:1994 songs Category:1995 singles Category:1997 singles Category:American alternative rock songs Category:American pop rock songs Category:American power pop songs Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:Billboard Adult Contemporary number-one singles Category:Billboard Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs) number-one singles Category:East West Records singles Category:Friends (1994 TV series) Category:Jangle pop songs Category:Number-one singles in Scotland Category:The Rembrandts songs Category:RPM Adult Contemporary number-one singles Category:RPM Top Singles number-one singles Category:Songs about friendship Category:Songs written by Allee Willis Category:Television theme songs ",
