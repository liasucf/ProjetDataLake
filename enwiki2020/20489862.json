    "text": "The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Class C was a class of 0-8-0 steam locomotives. They were two cylinder simple expansion rebuilds of the three- cylinder Class A designed by F.W. Webb. Fifteen Class As (16 according to the LNWR Society) were converted to Class C between 1904 and 1906 by George Whale. ==Class C1== The Class A boilers proved inadequate for the 19\u00bd inch bore cylinders of the Class C so the next 34 Class A conversions were to Class C1 with 18\u00bd inch bore cylinders. ==Numbering== All passed into LMS ownership in 1923, and the LMS allocated them the numbers 8953-67, though not all were applied before withdrawal. ==Rebuilding== The LMS rebuilt five of the Class Cs (LMS Nos 8953/4/62/4/6) to Class G1 between 1925-1927. ==Withdrawal== The remaining 10 engines were withdrawn between 1927 and 1932. None was preserved. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * Category:0-8-0 locomotives C Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1904 Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain Category:D n2 locomotives ",
