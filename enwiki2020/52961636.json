    "text": "Human Story 3 is a studio album by American electronic musician James Ferraro, self-released on June 14, 2016. The album's concept revolves philosophically and structurally on how technology that can be used meaningfully is often used less usefully for commerce and, as a result, how the technology may eventually end up subverting humanness. The record landed at number seven on Tiny Mix Tapes' year-end list of the best albums of 2016. ==Composition and concept== Human Story 3 conceptually and, by its ambiguous narrative, revolves around a \"smart planet\" where service robots, performed by text-to-speech voices, attempt to cognitively interpret the world around them but are at the same time musically shown as still performing repetitive tasks. The aim and moral of the record is that while technology can do a lot of commands that are beneficial, it ends up only being used less usefully for commerce and, as a result, the technology may eventually end up subverting humanness.Gaca, Anna (August 18, 2016). \"A Conversation With James Ferraro, Critical Futurist\". Spin. SpinMedia. Retrieved January 22, 2017. The word salads in the titles of cuts such as \"Immanent Cloud,\" \"Security Broker,\" or \"Plastic Ocean\" cause the meaning of symbols to be changed, much like how marketers alter the meaning of some objects to create what Ferraro described as strange and \"contradictory\" products.Grunenberg, Robert. \"James Ferraro and Mall Aesthetics\". SSense. Retrieved January 23, 2017. The text-to-speech voices often display slight mispronunciations, which give the album a surrealistic feel regarding how technology sometimes fails to replicate human cognition. As Ferraro said, \"Certain newer apps tend to bring people together \u2013 in a mechanical, artificial way \u2013 in shared space. I think that\u2019s probably the trend, post- this hyper-individual era. So it\u2019s obviously going to be unnatural if it\u2019s being manipulated through a third party like that\u2014a bit alien.\" Human Story 3 follows several text-to-speech characters, male and female voices, that repeat brand names, buzzwords and phrases like \"IKEA,\" \"GPS,\" \"Starbucks,\" \"market crash,\" \"mobile payments,\" \"FedEx,\" \"smart car\" and \"latte\" at musical swells and crescendos, along with detailed speeches. Mehan Jayasuriya of Pitchfork wrote that this dialogue feels \"like a torrent of audio pop-ups that can\u2019t be blocked.\"Jayasuriya, Mehan (July 1, 2016). \"James Ferraro: Human Story 3\". Pitchfork. Conde Nast. Retrieved January 23, 2017. The name of Human Story 3 is a play on the title of the Pixar film Toy Story 3 (2010). Ferraro named the album, given that the company's works were the \"mimesis of our reality.\" He said, \"we aggressively celebrate Pixar's cloud-like performance of human emotion, building emotional relationships with CGI characters and accepting them as powerful vehicles of meaningfulness. I personally see them as a marker of the hyper-individualistic age we live in.\" The instrumental backing often moves into separated moods, repetitive structures and pauses throughout each song, along with abrupt key changes which signify dissonance.Cook-Wilson, Winston (August 17, 2016). \"James Ferraro\u2019s Neo-Classical, GPS-Obsessed Americana\". Bandcamp Daily. Retrieved January 23, 2017. Musically, Human Story 3 is a modern classical album that returns to the commercial-like, overloaded vaporwave style of Ferraro's Far Side Virtual (2011), only sounding more 'clean' and less focused on pop structures. Most of the digitally made textures and clanging synthesizer sounds on the album blend in with organic instruments such as strings, woodwinds, pianos and professionally recorded real-life choirs. The choral vocals were performed by the Trojans choir of the University of Southern California. Ferraro's biggest reference point for Human Story 3 was 20th century American composer Aaron Copland. Ferraro described Copland as \"the purest musical spirit,\" reasoning that \"his music wasn\u2019t just appealing to the common denominator\u2014it\u2019s pandering toward their higher mind. He does that really well: just bringing in all of humanity. It represented something really, really virtuous for me.\" Ferraro was also influenced by the works of Igor Stravinsky, Erik Satie and Charles Ives in composing Human Story 3. Anna Gaca of Spin magazine compared Human Story 3's feel to that of the Ridley Scott film Blade Runner (1982), where the record's futuristic mood comes from how some of its parts are exaggerated or emotionally amplified. ==Release and promotion== Human Story 3 was announced on May 18, 2016, with a trailer and Ferraro summarizing the album on Twitter as \"a musing on hyper individualism and the marketability of neotenous plastics.\"Bowe, Miles (May 18, 2016). \"James Ferraro announces new album Human Story 3\".
