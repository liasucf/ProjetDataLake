    "text": "The Cinemanila International Film Festival is an annual film festival held in Manila, the Philippines. It was founded by Filipino filmmaker Amable \"Tikoy\" Aguiluz in 1999. The focus of the festival is on the cinema of the Philippines as well as Southeast Asian cinema. The Cinemanila icon is the bulol, a deity whose presence ensures good harvest. The Cinemanila International Film Festival invokes the bulol as a blessing towards the Filipino film industry in general \u2013 as a prayer towards good harvest, a plentiful bounty of excellent Filipino films. In the festival's competitive section, the top award is the Lino Brocka Award, given in honor of the acclaimed Filipino director, Lino Brocka. Another award, the Ishmael Bernal Award for Young Cinema, was first given at the 2000 festival, in honor of Filipino director Ishmael Bernal, to young independent Filipino filmmakers. One of Cinemanila's running components is Sine Barangay - a three-day event with free film appreciation and education workshops, culminating in an outdoor screening to barangay residents.\"Filmfest in your neighborhood\" , by Gerry Plaza, Philippine Daily Inquirer, 2008-10-24 It was previously held at the Marikina Riverbanks and Bonifacio High Street. In 2012, Cinemanila will launch the \"Cinemanila Moonlight Series\", regular outdoor screenings expanded from Sine Barangay, to take place over the course of Manila's dry season. ==History== The second Cinemanila was held from July 3 to 10, 1999 in Mandaluyong City. It was the first international film festival in the Philippines since the Manila International Film Festival, which had been held in the 1980s. (There is the Metro Manila Film Festival, but it is a national festival screening only Filipino films.) The festival featured a lecture on cinematography by Australian-Hong Kong cinematographer Christopher Doyle. The festival has typically been a low-key affair in terms of red-carpet visits by foreign celebrities. However, in 2003, the festival honored Hollywood stars with Filipino-American roots, and was graced by Lou Diamond Phillips, Tia Carrere, Dean Devlin and Rob Schneider. The same year, the first Lifetime Achievement Award was given, honoring Indonesian actress Christine Hakim. In 2007, director Quentin Tarantino and Thai director Chatrichalerm Yukol were among the Lifetime Achievement recipients. A retrospective of Tarantino's feature films was shown, from Reservoir Dogs to Kill Bill. He attended the awards ceremony at Malaca\u00f1an Palace, accepting the award from President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Both the president and the honoree were late to ceremony due to being stuck in a traffic jam. Tarantino, accompanied by festival founder Tikoy Aguiluz, took a pedicab to make it to the ceremony, and showed up without leather shoes as required to enter the palace. He was given a new pair of shoes by Aquiliuz. The festival is closely identified with its founder, filmmaker Tikoy Aguiluz, who has a reputation as a maverick. In 2006, he accused the Philippine media of not doing enough to promote the festival and independent films, stating at a news conference: \"All I want from you writers are three lines and a picture promoting the festival. Why do you think it's so hard for independent producers to have success here, locally? I haven't seen any support from either broadsheet or tabloids with any story on independent cinema.\" Among the world community of film festivals, Cinemanila has gained respectability with its programming of independent Asian film. Jurors at past festivals have included Christian Jeune, director of the film department of the Cannes Film Festival. Early incarnations of the festival were held outside of Manila, though still in the Metro Manila area, in Makati City, and for a time was known as the Makati Cinemanila International Film Festival. In 2005, the festival moved to the Manila city limits, with screenings held at SM City Manila and Robinsons Ermita cinemas. ==Awards== ===1999=== The inaugural year for the festival included a lecture on cinematography by Christopher Doyle.

We applaud the directors or their sharp eye for details, their patience and their restraint. They let the mundane details of the daily life of a poor blind boy speak to the audience directly but quietly... For trusting these details to resonate with the audience universally and ..for not exploiting a subject that could be easily exploited. * Tumbang Preso by Antoinette Jadaone as Best Short Film, - (Citation) We applaud the film Tumbang Preso for the clever use of one set of dialogue to contrast and parallel the world of Estong as a child and Estong as a grown-up. The director understands the short film medium and has the discipline to work within the limitations of it to produce a fun and very watchable short film. * Ishmael Bernal Award: Christopher Gozum for Surreal Random MMS Texts (Surreal Random MMS Texts for a mother, a sister, and a wife who longs for you: landscape with figures) - (Citation) We found Christopher Gozum\u2019s flm inspiring. He was able to combine the beauty of Carlos Bulasan\u2019s poetry with minimalist and random images of LCD screens, daily life, creating rhythm light and sound from them to convey the longing and displacement of a Filipino working in the Middle East. Revelatory and humbling, we hope this award will encourage the director to continue his quest of mapping the human heart through film. ====Southeast Asia Film Competition==== * Frou Frou... Shhh, Huwag Mong Sabihin kay Itay by Michael Juat as Best Southeast Asian Short Film - (Citation) Clever appropriation of cinematic, media and cultural clich\u00e9s done with finely tuned comedy. uses a glossy exterior and high production values to deceptively comment of notions of artistic expression and satirises everything from a cynical but biting point of view. * Confessional by Jerrold Tarog and Ruel Dahis Antipuesto as Best SEA Film, - (Citation) Clever execution of the mockumentary style to comment on the art of filmmaking, personal relationships, politics, and culture. The film was well orchestrated in the use of film making production elements to support a point of view and engage the audience. Showed great ability in amalgamating seemingly disparate elements to a cohesive whole. * Anita Linda - Best Actress for Adela. - (Citation) A beautifully understated performance rich in emotional nuances. Showing a great reflective understanding of the relationships between the different characters within the film\u2019s microcosm. * Mario Maurer - Best Actor for The Love of Siam. - (Citation) Mature acting choices within a wide range of situations.
