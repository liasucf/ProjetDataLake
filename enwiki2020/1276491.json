He next went to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. He learned to play the piano as a child on a Broadwood piano which his father had bought with the winnings from a hundred-to-one bet during the Grand National.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kbg3g0zJnw ==Discography== ===Film=== ====1990s==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
