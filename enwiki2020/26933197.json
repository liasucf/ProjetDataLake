Zulma Bouffar. In: The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Macmillan, London and New York, 1997. ==Life and career== At the age of six, Bouffar appeared in La fille bien gard\u00e9e in Marseille, and followed this with successful performances in Lyon. Her father then toured with her around western Europe and Scandinavia. After her father\u2019s death in 1854 she continued travelling, bringing into her repertoire some of the contemporary songs of Offenbach, who heard her sing in Hamburg in 1864. The same year Bouffar appeared at Bad Ems in Offenbach's Lischen et Fritzchen, and repeated her success in Paris.G\u00e4nzl K. The Encyclopaedia of the Musical Theatre. Blackwell, Oxford, 1994. From this time for about 12 years Bouffar was probably Offenbach's mistress \u2013 his longest extra-marital liaison.Harding J. Jacques Offenbach, a biography. John Calder, London, 1980. She created Nani in Les g\u00e9orgiennes, \u00c9ros, L'Intendant and Jeannet in Les bergers, Gabrielle in La Vie parisienne, Drogan in Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant, Toto in Le ch\u00e2teau \u00e0 Toto, Fragoletto in Les Brigands, Robin Luron in Le Roi Carotte, Ginetta in Les braconniers, Moschetta in Il signor Fagotto and Prince Caprice in Le voyage dans la lune \u2013 a range of men's and women's roles. In 1873 Bouffar was reported in the Parisian press to have been considered for the title role of Bizet's new opera, Carmen. Although the composer refuted the story, the singer did attend the premiere of the piece in 1875.Curtiss M. Bizet and his world. New York, Vienna House, 1958. From 1891\u201393 Bouffar became the manager of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Ambigu-Comique. In the latter part of her stage career, Bouffar appeared in operettas by Lecocq and Strauss, and sang around Europe. She announced her retirement from the stage in 1902. ==References== Category:1841 births Category:1909 deaths Category:French operatic sopranos Category:French operatic mezzo-sopranos Category:People from N\u00e9rac Category:French theatre managers and producers Category:Women theatre managers and producers Category:19th-century French singers Category:19th-century women singers ",
