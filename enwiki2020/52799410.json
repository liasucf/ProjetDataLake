First a photographer by training, (for three years she was a freelance fashion photographer) she studied literature at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Her meeting with her professor of foreign literature, Eva Le Grand, was decisive in her beginnings as a writer. She paid tribute to her in Montr\u00e9al priv\u00e9, \u00e9ditions Jacques Lanct\u00f4t, (2003). The writer decided to take a sabbatical year to write her first novel, Cette fois, Jeanne... (1987) which received a favorable reception of the Quebec press. She was then recruited to work on screenwriting, short films and a TV movie. The Prix de la Rel\u00e8ve 16/26 for the screenwriting of Alice au Pays des Merguez, (1990) gave her access to several television projects as a screenwriter. She has been living in Switzerland since 1991. A native French speaker, Louise Anne Bouchard speaks also English, German and Italian. == Bibliography / novels == * 1987: Cette fois, Jeanne...
