The island forms part of the low-lying maraj\u00f3 v\u00e1rzea, the inundated land in and around the mouth of the Amazon River. The island is an excellent place to observe the tidal bore called the pororoca, where the Amazon river waters meet the incoming Atlantic tides and form a standing wave, and is a birdwatchers' haven. ==External links== * Category:River islands of Brazil Category:Islands of the Amazon Category:Landforms of Par\u00e1 ",
