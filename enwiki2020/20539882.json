The house was founded in 1811 by Pierre-Nicolas Perrier and Rose Ad\u00e9laide Jou\u00ebt, and produces both vintage and non-vintage cuvee, approximately 3,000,000 bottles annually, with its prestige label named Belle Epoque. Perrier-Jou\u00ebt owns 266 acres of vineyards in the Champagne region. Today the house is under the Pernod Ricard umbrella of brands. Perrier-Jou\u00ebt owns over 160 acres of vineyards, with more than half in the Grand Crus of Cramant and Avize. The correct pronunciation of the label is : the two dots on the e of Jouet mean that the next letter t should be pronounced (but softly, like wet).personal e-mail: \"We are pleased to confirm that, having two dots on the \"e\", the next letter \"t \" should be pronounced. You have to say perrier zhou-ette. Yours faithfully, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique BAVERET, VIP & Hospitality Manager, Champagne Perrier-Jou\u00ebt\" Perrier-Jou\u00ebt in Avenue de Champagne ==History== This origin story of those house dates to 1810, when the \u00c9pernay-based cork supplier Pierre Nicolas Perrier married Rose Ad\u00e9laide Jou\u00ebt, the daughter of a Calvados producer. Perrier's family owned vineyards in Dizy, Chouilly, A\u04f1. Having been married just one year, the newlyweds begin producing champagne under the name Perrier-Jou\u00ebt. Ad\u00e8le focused on vineyards and winemaking; Pierre Nicolas focused on sales and marketing. Shipments to Great Britain began in 1815 and to the United States in 1837. Charles Perrier succeeded to his parents in 1854 to 1878. After his death Henri and Octave Gallice became Perrrier-Jou\u00ebt directors. Henri Gallice and his younger brother Octave were both art lovers, but while Henri managed the family business in \u00c9pernay, Octave spent much of this time in Paris, sharing in the excitement of the \"Belle Epoque\" those heady years at the start of the 20th century when France was swept along by whirlwind progress in science and arts. In the capital, he met Emile Gall\u00e9, one of the pioneers of the Art Nouveau movement, the revolutionary artistic expression of the period. At the brother's request, Emile Gall\u00e9 created a design for Maison Perrier-Jou\u00ebt, drawing on his own passion for botany to imagine a spray of Japanese white anemones. Four magnums enamelled with this delicate motif were delivered in 1902, becoming the iconic emblem, not only of the prestigious Perrier-JOu\u00ebt Belle Epoque cuv\u00e9e, but of Maison Perrier-Jou\u00ebt itself.Perrier-Jou\u00ebt, the essence of Champagne, Jean Pierrre Devroye, Stock, 1999, 978-2-234-05112-6 One of the three bottles of the world's oldest champagne, a Perrier-Jou\u00ebt (vintage 1825) was opened and tasted in 2009.
