    "text": "American Hot Rod is a reality television series that originally aired between 2004 and 2007 on The Learning Channel and Discovery Channel. The series followed renowned car designer Boyd Coddington and his crew as they built hot rods and custom vehicles at his wheel and car shop in La Habra, California. The show was known for its frequent rows and bust ups, and a high staff turnover rate. Some crew members went to work for Overhaulin's Chip Foose, a former partner of Coddington's, for a more relaxed environment; even Boyd's own son could not work there for long. The series ended when Boyd Coddington died, following complications from surgery, in February 2008. The car shop closed on June 20, 2008.Boyd Coddington Wheels is Still Rolling On Custom cars built during the series included the \"Alumatub\", a '61 Impala Bubbletop, a '63 Chevy Corvette Stingray, and a '42 Woodie.
