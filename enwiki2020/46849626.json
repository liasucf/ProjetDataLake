Meyer composed the film's music and Gopi Sundar scored the background music. R. Rathnavelu and Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao handled the film's cinematography and editing, respectively. Released on 20 May 2016, the film received unfavourable response from both critics and the audience, and failed at the box office. ==Plot== Many characters in this film were either unnamed or given informal names. The movie runs in Samantha Akkineni's narration. Chantibabu (Sathyaraj), a well established paint business entrepreneur and well-respected persona in family and society, lives in Vijayawada with his wife Mahalakshmi (Revathi) and son Babu (Mahesh Babu), a friendly and charming bachelor who looks after his father's business and his younger daughter lives in London with her husband. Mahalakshmi is the foster daughter of Rohini Hattangadi, and her four stepbrothers Peddabbai (Rao Ramesh), Naresh, Sayaji Shinde, and Krishna Bhagavan run the business with Chantibabu. Although their families live in different houses, they celebrate every occasion together. Peddabbai, Mahalakshmi's eldest stepbrother, is envious about his brother-in-law's fame as his father lends Chantibabu 400 rupees for his business establishment. Everyone confers the credit to Chantibabu. Peddabbai stays separate from the crowd and celebration. His wife Rajyalakshmi (Jayasudha) suggests marrying their daughter (Pranitha Subhash) to Babu to reduce his pain. Peddabbai struggles on how to put this idea in front of his brother-in-law. Chantibabu comes to know of his intentions and decides to speak with Babu. Enters Kasi Annapurna (Kajal Aggarwal), a free-spirited NRI from Australia who comes to India. Her father (Subhalekha Sudhakar) was a friend to Chantibabu and drops her at their home. Babu and Kasi develop feelings for each other but differ on the idea of living with family as Kasi loves to live more individually and wants to explore more in life. The family goes on a tour to Ooty, where Kasi expresses her thoughts to Babu, and they decide to break up. Before bidding goodbye, the two kiss. Peddabbai then leaves Ooty. This worries Chantibabu, so he calls everyone home to settle down the disturbances. Peddabbai bursts out on Chantibabu and asks to leave him and his family. Saddened, Chantibabu dies. Babu's sister's friend (Samantha Akkineni) from London visits the family while on her way to Brahmotsavam. Babu tries to rebuild the relation with Peddabbai, which does not work. He leaves for a road trip with Samantha. He meets, interacts, and shares experiences with his distant relatives of seven generations. In the due course, he and Samantha get closer and meet Peddabbai, who is now a big shot. Pranitha is about to get hooked with a minister's son. Peddabbai willingly does this to show off but wants Babu to be his son-in-law. He reaches Samantha Ruth Prabhu and asks her to leave Babu for the sake of her daughter. Respecting his words, she leaves for Brahmotsavam, kissing Babu tearfully. Peddabbai decides to go after the minister's son alliance. He holds a grand wedding and does not invite Babu and Mahalakshmi. In order to keep his father's pride, Babu and Mahalakshmi go to the marriage. Peddabbai insults them. After a series of confrontations, he comes to know that Chantibabu has left the whole property on his name, stating \"Peddabbai was there in each and every moment of his life, in his good and bad times, and he is completely worth it\".

Mahesh was impressed with Addala's new script and accepted to work with him after completing his existing commitments. Addala worked on the film's script for more than a year. The filming was expected to begin in May 2015 once Mahesh completes the shoot of Srimanthudu (2015). The film was tentatively titled as Brahmotsavam and Addala said in late December 2014 that it would be a family drama adding that he would begin the casting process soon. Prasad V. Potluri accepted to bankroll the film under the banner PVP Cinema and wanted Mahesh to sign a three-film deal once he returns from his holiday in Dubai; this film being the first of the three and the remaining two in 2016. On 8 January 2015, Addala told IANS that the film is almost confirmed and added that it is too early to share any more information. Mahesh chose to act in this film disregard to the box office performance of Addala's previous film Mukunda (2014) and the film was expected to be a romantic entertainer. Mickey J. Meyer was signed in on to compose the film's music. R. Rathnavelu was confirmed as the film's director of photography in early May 2015. A special logo of the film's title featuring both Venkateswara feet and a poorna kumbham in addition was released on 30 May 2015, a day before the official launch ceremony. The poster confirmed A. Sreekar Prasad and Thota Tharani as the film's editor and art director respectively. An official statement from the makers confirmed that the film would be a bilingual shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil with the same title, marking Mahesh's first direct Tamil film. After opining that the script has the potential to commercially succeed in both the languages without making much changes, Mahesh accepted the proposal of a Telugu-Tamil bilingual. However, the plan was later on dropped. === Casting === The makers tried to approach Rajinikanth for a brief yet key role as per the film's script. They approached Rakul Preet Singh to play the female lead and she evinced interest to be a part of the film after the first round of discussions. The film's team announced a casting call on 4 March 2015 for male and female characters; the requirements being an age group of 15 \u2013 50 years and four photographs two full size and close up photographs each. A source from the film's unit reported Samantha Ruth Prabhu as one of the three female leads of the film in a statement to IANS on 15 April 2015, adding that Taapsee Pannu and Pranitha Subhash were called for a look test on the next day for the other two female lead roles. Of the three female lead roles, the first two reportedly would have full-length roles while the third would pale in comparison. Sources close to the film's unit later added that parallel, wide open discussions were on regarding the female lead selection where a section of the technicians believe that fresh faces should be cast opposite Mahesh while a few opted for the inclusion of established female leads. A 30-day audition was held at Hyderabad from mid-April 2015. Mahesh, however, insisted that he would work with the actresses whose pairing with him received positive response from his fans. Rakul Preet Singh's manager confirmed her inclusion as one of the three female leads days later to the media. Though she denied signing the film during the promotions of Pandaga Chesko (2014), an official statement confirmed her and Pranitha as the female leads. Jayasudha, Rao Ramesh and Tanikella Bharani were confirmed as a part of the film's supporting cast during the official launch ceremony. The makers chose Sathyaraj to play Mahesh's father in the film. The film's unit told IANS that his presence in a major role would appeal to Tamil audience as the film was promoted as a Telugu-Tamil bilingual. Mannara was rumoured to be approached by the makers for the second female lead role. The film's executive producer Rajiv later revealed that Mannara was never approached for any character in the film. Rajiv added that her manager approached the makers for a role after the rumour began spreading and they rejected the proposal as no character suited her.

At the same time, PVP Cinema announced another casting call for real life families who are interested in participating in the film's shoot. Saranya Ponvannan inclusion in the film's cast was confirmed in mid-February 2016. In mid March 2016, Pranitha revealed that she plays a girl-next-door character of a traditional Telugu girl from a very protective family who consider herself a very bubbly girl who takes only the good from any situation that comes my way in life and will be seen sporting simple kurtis and patiala pants.

During the film's official launch ceremony, Addala spoke about the film's theme by stating, \"There would be beauty and happiness if some people are together. If there is a family with many members and if they celebrate every moment like a Utsavam, it is a Brahmotsavam\", adding that the film's story would be on the lines of his previous directorial Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2013) which featured Mahesh and Samantha in the lead roles along with Daggubati Venkatesh and Anjali. A source from the film's unit revealed that Brahmotsavam is all about family values and celebrating traditions. The bonding between the protagonist and his father along with the backdrop of his mother's family are the centerpiece of the film. The three female leads play an important role in the manner in which the protagonist realises the value of family when they go out on a journey exploring the family lineage and their place in the larger scheme of family links. == Music == Mickey J. Meyer was signed to compose the film's soundtrack and background score. In early March 2015, Meyer recorded a song whose vocals were provided by Abhay Jodhpurkar.

A suit for damages of Rs. 25 lakhs was filed against the makers for copying the first 36 seconds of the Tulu song A...lele...yereg madme by Dr. Vamana Nandaavara found in the Deepanalike CD composed for Siri channel. The song was used in the movie in a sequence involving the lead actor who while accompanying his family on a tour dances to the tune of the hit Tulu song.http://epaper.udayavani.com/archive/home.php?edition=Sudina%20(Mangalore)&date;=2017-03-23&pageno;=6&pid;=UVANI_MAN == Release == The makers aimed for a Dusherra release in the film's pre- production stage clashing with Ram Charan' Bruce Lee: The Fighter, and Nandamuri Balakrishna Dictator, his 99th film as an actor.
