Founded in 1946, its expansion coincided with the country's growth, and by the mid 1970s, the Juffali Group had firmly established itself as the largest business house in the Middle East, with 49,218 employees worldwide. Juffali was responsible for developing the first power generation (electricity), and telecommunication in Saudi Arabia as-well as television concessions. Later on the Al Juffali group introduced many other fields to Saudi Arabia such as power utilities, construction, insurance, telecommunications, and vehicle manufacturing and distribution. Their joint venture partners include international companies such as, Daimler AG, Bosch, Dow Chemical, Fluor Corp, Carrier, DuPont, Ericsson, IBM, Liebherr, Michelin, Massey Ferguson, Siemens AG, and Nabors Industries. The group's growth was steered in large part by Sheikh Ahmed bin Abdullah Al-Juffali (1924\u20131994). The company was later run by his sons, Sheikh Khaled Juffali and Sheikh Walid Al Juffali (1955-2016) and supported by professional staff managing a wide range of investments, manufacturing, finance, real estate, distribution, and oil drilling throughout the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and North America. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1948 establishments in Saudi Arabia Category:Conglomerate companies established in 1948 Category:Companies of Saudi Arabia Category:Companies based in Jeddah Category:Saudi Arabian families Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1948 Category:Energy companies established in 1948 ",
