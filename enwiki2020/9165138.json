    "text": "Mibolerone, also known as dimethylnortestosterone (DMNT) and sold under the brand names Cheque Drops and Matenon, is a synthetic, orally active, and extremely potent anabolic\u2013androgenic steroid (AAS) and a 17\u03b1-alkylated nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) derivative which was marketed by Upjohn for use as a veterinary drug. It was indicated specifically as an oral treatment for prevention of estrus (heat) in adult female dogs. ==Side effects== ==Pharmacology== ===Pharmacodynamics=== Mibolerone has both higher affinity and greater selectivity for the androgen receptor (AR) than does the related potent AAS metribolone (17\u03b1-methyl-19-nor-\u03b49,11-testosterone), although potent and significant progestogenic activity remains present. However, another study found that mibolerone and metribolone had similar affinity for the progesterone receptor (PR) but that mibolerone only had around half the affinity of metribolone for the AR. {| class=\"wikitable center sortable mw- collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:600px; text-align:left; margin- left:auto; margin-right:auto; border:none;\" |+ class=\"nowrap\" | Relative affinities (%) of mibolerone and related steroids |- !

It is the 17\u03b1-methyl derivative of trestolone (7\u03b1-methyl-19-nortestosterone; MENT). Other related AAS include metribolone (17\u03b1-methyl-\u03b49,11-19-nortestosterone) and dimethyltrienolone (7\u03b1,17\u03b1-dimethyl-\u03b49,11-19-nortestosterone). ===Synthesis=== Nandrolone (1) appears to be used to make mibolerone. For comparison, also see bolasterone and calusterone. The first step involves extending the conjugation of the enone function by an additional double bond. Chloranil (tetrachloroquinone) is the forerunner of dichlorodicyanoquinone (DDQ), a reagent used extensively for introducing additional unsaturation in the progestin and corticoid series. Preparation of Mibolerone: ; J. C. Babcock, J. A. Campbell, (1962, 1967 both to Upjohn). In the case at hand, heating acetate (1) with chloranil gives the conjugated dienone (2), and reaction of that compound with methylmagnesium bromide in the presence of cuprous chloride leads to addition of the methyl group to position 7 at the end of the conjugated system (3). The stereochemistry of the product again illustrates the preference for additions from the backside. The alcohol at C17 is then oxidized to a ketone (4). Enamines are commonly used to activate adjacent functions; they are also not infrequently used, as in this case, as protecting groups. Thus, reaction of the intermediate with pyrrolidine gives dienamine (5). This transformation emphasizes the clear difference in reactivity between ketones at C7 and C17. A second methyl Grignard addition gives the corresponding 17\u03b1-methyl derivative. Hydrolysis of the enamine function then affords mibolerone (6). The same structure of 3 and 4 also containing an 11\u03b2-fluoro group has also been described in the patent literature. (2008 to Bayer Schering Pharma Ag). ==History== Mibolerone was first synthesized in 1963. ==Society and culture== ===Generic names=== Mibolerone is the generic name of the drug and its , , and . It is also known as dimethylnortestosterone (DMNT) and by its former developmental code name U-10997. ===Brand names=== Mibolerone has been marketed under the brand names Cheque Drops and Matenon. ==References== ==External links== * Cheque Drops (mibolerone) - William Llewellyn's Anabolic.org Category:Abandoned drugs Category:Tertiary alcohols Category:Androgens and anabolic steroids Category:Estranes Category:Hepatotoxins Category:Enones Category:Progestogens Category:World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited substances ",
