This is the second album to feature Rob Dukes on vocals and Lee Altus on guitars, but it also marks the second comeback of longtime original Exodus drummer Tom Hunting. Hunting's last appearance was on Exodus's 2004 album Tempo of the Damned. ==Title== The album takes its name from an experimental novel of the same name by J.G. Ballard published in 1970. The name of the album is the same as a planned album that was to be released by the Los Angeles thrash metal outfit Dark Angel in 1992. Guitarist Gary Holt has stated it is named \"Exhibit A\" because Exodus had planned to release a follow up Exhibit B album soon afterward, although that album was not released until 2010. ==Release and reception== On October 17, 2007 the entire album was uploaded on the band's MySpace page, however, many of the people that pre-ordered the album from CM Distro received it on October 19. The single released from the album was \"Funeral Hymn\". There was also a music video released for \"Riot Act\". The song \"Riot Act\" was released as DLC for the video game Rock Band 2 via the Rock Band Network on June 6, 2010. The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A was well received by the Metal press.
