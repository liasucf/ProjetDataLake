    "text": "Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o da Silva Ramos (born 25 March 1983), known simply as Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o, is a former Portuguese footballer who played as a right winger. ==Club career== Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o was born in Lyon, France. After playing youth football with FC Porto he made his senior debuts with the B-team in the third division, going on to spend four years with them in that tier. Released in the summer of 2005 without one single official appearance for the main squad, he joined Primeira Liga club F.C. Penafiel, but left after a couple of months and moved to Leix\u00f5es S.C. in the second level, where he appeared very rarely over the course of two (incomplete) seasons. In late December 2007, Cristov\u00e3o signed with AEP Paphos FC from Cyprus. In the 2009 off-season he joined fellow First Division team Anorthosis Famagusta FC, making his league debut on 30 August in a 0\u20130 away draw against Ermis Aradippou. On 3 February 2012, Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o moved to Bulgaria with PFC Levski Sofia, signing a two-and-a-half-year contract. He scored on his first First Professional Football League appearance, helping his team to a 2\u20131 win over PFC Cherno More Varna; on 29 April 2012, he netted the only goal in a derby success against PFC CSKA Sofia. Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o was released by Levski in summer 2013 (alongside some of the other foreign players) mainly due to his high salary, but he returned to the club after the winter break. ==Club statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=2|League !colspan=2|Cup !colspan=2|Europe !colspan=2|Total |- !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- | rowspan=5|Porto B |2001\u201302 |4||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4||1 |- |2002\u201303 |25||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||3 |- |2003\u201304 |35||9||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||35||9 |- |2004\u201305 |34||5||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||34||5 |- ! colspan=1 | Total ! 98!!18!!0!!0!!0!!0!!98!!18 |- | rowspan=2|Penafiel |2005\u201306 |11||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||12||0 |- ! colspan=1 | Total ! 11!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!12!!0 |- | rowspan=3|Leix\u00f5es |2005\u201306 |6||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||0 |- |2006\u201307 |2||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||0 |- ! colspan=1 | Total ! 8!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!9!!0 |- | rowspan=3|AEP |2007\u201308 |15||4||?||?||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||15||4 |- |2008\u201309 |25||4||?||?||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||4 |- ! colspan=1 | Total ! 40!!8!!0!!0!!0!!0!!40!!8 |- | rowspan=4|Anorthosis |2009\u201310 |21||2||?||?||4||0||25||2 |- |2010\u201311 |26||5||?||?||8||1||34||6 |- |2011\u201312 |11||0||?||?||2||1||13||1 |- ! colspan=1 | Total ! 58!!7!!0!!0!!14!!2!!72!!9 |- | rowspan=2|Levski Sofia |2011\u201312 |13||3||1||0||0||0||14||3 |- ! colspan=1 | Total ! 13!!3!!1!!0!!0!!0!!14!!3 |- ! colspan=2 | Career total ! 215!!33!!3!!0!!14!!2!!231!!35 |} ==References== ==External links== * *National team data *Levski official profile Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:French people of Portuguese descent Category:Sportspeople from Lyon Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:FC Porto B players Category:F.C.
