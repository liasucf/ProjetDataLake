    "text": "\"Night Bird Flying\" is a rock song written by Jimi Hendrix. It is a complex piece with multiple guitar parts and reflects a variety of styles. Lyrically, Hendrix continues to explore an idealized feminine figure, as in his 1967 song \"Little Wing\". Hendrix recorded the piece in the summer of 1970 at his new Electric Lady Studios with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Billy Cox. He proposed the song for his fourth album and it is one of the few that are seen as largely complete. \"Night Bird Flying\" was initially released on the first Hendrix posthumous album, The Cry of Love (1971). The track is included on several subsequent Hendrix compilations. ==History== Hendrix used elements of the song's rhythm pattern in jams at TTG Studios in Los Angeles in October 1968. In early 1969, he started to develop it as \"Ships Passing in the Night\" and several demos were recorded before Hendrix attempted a proper recording in his newly built Electric Lady Studios on June 16, 1970. After 32 takes, he completed the master. Overdubs were recorded on July 19 and August 22, before a final mix was accomplished on August 24, 1970. Hendrix and all involved in the recording were very pleased with the song and it was presented on the opening party of Electric Lady on August 26. The song was chosen as a B-side for \"Dolly Dagger\" and a master for a single was prepared by Reprise Records. However, the single was cancelled when Hendrix died on September 18, 1970. In 1971, the song was included on the posthumous Hendrix album, The Cry of Love. In the UK, it was released as the single B-side to \"Angel\" on Track Records. ==Personnel== *Jimi Hendrixvocals, guitar, production, audio mixing *Billy Coxbass guitar *Mitch Mitchelldrums, production *Eddie Kramerproduction, audio engineering, mixing ==References== ==External links== *[https://www.vevo.com/watch/jimi-hendrix/night-bird-flying-(behind-the- scenes)/USSM21201813 \"Night Bird Flying\" (Behind the Scenes) on Vevo]: Eddie Kramer (with Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox) demonstrates some of the mulitrack guitar parts recorded at Electric Lady Studios, New York City.
