    "text": "The Data processing inequality is an information theoretic concept which states that the information content of a signal cannot be increased via a local physical operation. This can be expressed concisely as 'post-processing cannot increase information'. ==Definition== Let three random variables form the Markov chain X \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z, implying that the conditional distribution of Z depends only on Y and is conditionally independent of X. Specifically, we have such a Markov chain if the joint probability mass function can be written as :p(x,y,z) = p(x)p(y|x)p(z|y) In this setting, no processing of Y , deterministic or random, can increase the information that Y contains about X. Using the mutual information, this can be written as : : I(X;Y) \\geqslant I(X;Z) With the equality I(X;Y) = I(X;Z) if and only if I(X;Y|Z)=0 , i.e. Z and Y contain the same information about X, and X \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow Y also forms a Markov chain. ==See also== * Garbage in, garbage out ==References== ==External links== *http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Mutual_information Category:Data processing ",
