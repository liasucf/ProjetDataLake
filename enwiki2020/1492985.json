    "text": "Unity Party (Australia) was a small multiculturist party in Australia, formed in 1997 and with the aim of opposing the rise of the controversial anti- immigration politician Pauline Hanson. Although initially billed as a party to unite Australians of all ethnicities against racism, Unity failed to draw significant support outside Australia's East Asian ethnic communities. After the demise of Pauline Hanson as a political force, Unity has accordingly shifted its focus onto ethnic community affairs at a local government level. ==History== ===Formation=== Unity attracted much attention when it was founded in 1997, and ran candidates in almost every House of Representatives seat at the 1998 election. While they had hopes of winning a Senate seat in New South Wales with lawyer Jason Yat-Sen Li, he fell well short. However, the party outpolled the Australian Democrats and Australian Greens in some House of Representatives seats. In the NSW Federal seat of Fowler, investment banker Andrew Su outpolled both the Democrats and One Nation. Subsequently, in the 1999 NSW State Election, Su went on to poll more than the Liberals, Greens and Democrats in the safe Labor seat of Cabramatta. ===Decline=== As the Hanson movement began to disintegrate, it also negated Unity's main platform, and the party soon fell into internal tensions. The party's founder, Dr. Peter Wong, won a seat in the New South Wales Legislative Council with just 1% of the vote. This came against the backdrop of a series of resignations, including that of Li. Wong soon stepped down as leader in favour of a white Australian in an attempt to broaden the party's base. Unity's activities largely died down throughout 2000 and Wong acted as a virtual independent in the Legislative Council. However, with the re-emergence of Hanson's One Nation party at the 2001 Western Australian state election, the party again came together and put together a large slate of candidates for the federal election that year. Despite having several prominent candidates (such as former Melbourne City Council member Wellington Lee in Victoria), they fell even further short of winning a seat in either house of federal parliament. After their failure to break into federal parliament in 2001, Unity largely shifted its attentions to local government, running a number of candidates for local councils in largely non-white areas, primarily in suburban Sydney. It did not run any candidates in the 2004 federal election. Wong continued to represent Unity in the NSW Parliament, until the expiry of his term in March 2007. At the March 2007 NSW state election, lead Unity Upper House candidate, Le Lam, won 1.2% of the vote, which was insufficient to gain election. Consequently, Unity no longer holds seats in any Australian parliament. The party did not contest the 2011 NSW state election although Pauline Hanson did. The party contested one New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat (Kogarah) in the 2015 state election, receiving 7.9% of the vote in that seat. ==Past presidents== * Peter Wong, 1997\u20131999, 2007\u20132009 * Ernest Wong ==Prominent past and present members== * Randa Abdel-Fattah, writer * Cr.
