He continued his studies in Germany at Munich, G\u00f6ttingen, Bonn, and Berlin. He took part in the political movements of the time. Sturdza was private secretary to Prince Alexander John Cuza. He afterwards turned against the increasingly unsanctioned rule of Cuza: He became Minister of Public Instruction in 1859, and was one of the most zealous promoters of the overthrow of Cuza. In 1866, he joined Ion Br\u0103tianu and others in the deposition of Cuza, and the election of Prince Charles of Hohenzollern (later Carol I of Romania). He became a member of the Liberal government. In the cabinet of Bratianu, 1876\u201388, he repeatedly held ministerial posts. In 1892 he was elected leader of the National Liberal Party in succession to Br\u0103tianu, and was four times Prime Minister. For his last time in office, in 1907, Sturdza was called by King Carol I to handle the crisis created by the peasants' revolt of March. Although noted for his capacity for work, he was also a nationalist, resentful of \"aliens\" (in line with the anti-Jewish policies of his party), and supported blocking non-Romanians from a large number of social positions. He was appointed permanent secretary of the Romanian Academy, and became a recognized authority on Romanian numismatics. As secretary of the academy he was instrumental in assisting the publication of the collections of historic documents made by (30 vols., Bucharest, 1876-1897), and other acts and documents besides a number of minor political pamphlets of transitory value. His son Alexandru Sturdza, by then a Colonel in the Romanian Army, defected to the Germans in 1916, during the World War I. ==Works== * La Marche progressive de la Russie sur le Danube (1878) * Uebersicht der M\u00fcnzen und Medaillen des F\u00fcrstentums Rum\u00e4nien (1874) * Europa, Russia, Romania (1888) * La question des portes de fer et des cataractes du Danube (1899) * Charles I., roi de Roumanie (1899 et seq.) ==See also== * Sturdza family ==Notes== ==References== * Ion Luca Caragiale, Tr\u0103darea rom\u00e2nismului!
