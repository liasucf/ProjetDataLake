The Aikoku K\u014dt\u014d was formed in January 1874 by Itagaki Taisuke, Et\u014d Shinpei, Got\u014d Sh\u014djir\u014d and others as part of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement. Its purpose was to petition the Meiji government to establish a national assembly. Fearing arrest after the failed Saga Rebellion, Itagaki disbanded it soon after its foundation. However, Itagaki revived the party in the 1890s, and it later merged with the Jiyut\u014d. The Aikoku K\u014dt\u014d can be regarded as the first political party in Japan. It should not be confused with the Aikokusha movement or with later ultranationalist movements with similar names. ==See also== *Liberalism in Japan *List of liberal parties *Liberal democracy ==References== * Japan 1870s Category:Defunct political parties in Japan Category:Meiji Restoration Category:Political parties established in 1874 Category:1874 establishments in Japan Category:Political parties with year of disestablishment missing ",
