(The sample knife is a deba b\u014dch\u014d knife) Nakiri b\u014dch\u014d (\u83dc\u5207\u308a\u5305\u4e01, translation: knife for cutting greens) and usuba b\u014dch\u014d (\u8584\u5203\u5305\u4e01, thin knife) are Japanese-style vegetable knives. They differ from the deba b\u014dch\u014d in their shape, as they have a straight blade edge suitable for cutting all the way to the cutting board without the need for a horizontal pull or push.http://www.knife-making-supplies.net/japanese-kitchen- knives.html Japanese Kitchen Knives These knives are also much thinner. While the deba b\u014dch\u014d is a heavy blade for easy cutting through thin bones, the blade is not suitable for chopping vegetables, as the thicker blade can break the vegetable slice. The nakiri b\u014dch\u014d and the usuba b\u014dch\u014d have a much thinner blade. This does not help with cutting small bones in fish or meat, but is useful for cutting vegetables. Nakiri b\u014dch\u014d are knives for home use, and sometimes have a black finished, or Kurouchi, blade. The cutting edge is angled from both sides, called ry\u014dba in Japanese. This makes it easier to cut straight slices. Usuba b\u014dch\u014d are vegetable knives used by professionals. They differ from the Nakiri b\u014dch\u014d in the shape of the cutting edge. While the nakiri b\u014dch\u014d is sharpened from both sides, the usuba b\u014dch\u014d is sharpened only from one side, a style known as kataba in Japanese. The highest quality kataba blades have a slight depression on the flat side. This kataba style edge gives better cuts and allows for the cutting of thinner slices than the ry\u014dba used for nakiri b\u014dch\u014d, but requires more skill to use. The sharpened side is usually the right side for a right hand use of the knife, but knives sharpened on the left side are available for left hand use. The usuba b\u014dch\u014d is heavier than a nakiri b\u014dch\u014d, although still much lighter than a deba b\u014dch\u014d. ==See also== * Japanese kitchen knives * List of Japanese cooking utensils ==References== Category:Japanese kitchen knives ja:\u83dc\u5207\u308a\u5305\u4e01 ",
