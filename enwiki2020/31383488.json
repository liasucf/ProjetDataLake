    "text": "Mariprofundus ferrooxydans is a neutrophilic, chemolithotrophic, Gram-negative bacterium which can grow by oxidising ferrous to ferric iron. It is one of the few members of the class Zetaproteobacteria in the phylum Proteobacteria. ==Discovery== Yellow iron oxide-covered lava rock on the flank of L\u014d\u02bbihi The bacterium was isolated from iron-rich microbial mats associated with hydrothermal vents at a submarine volcano, L\u014d\u02bbihi Seamount, near Hawaii, and has only 85.3% 16S similarity to its nearest cultivated species Methylophaga marina. It has a doubling time at 23 \u00b0C of 12 hours and a curved rod (about 0.5\u00d72\u20135 \u00b5m) morphology. ==Etymology== Despite being validly published,VALIDATION LIST N\u00b0 135. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol., 2010, 60, 1985-1986 the etymology of the generic epithet is grammatically incorrect, being a concatenation of the Latin neutral mare -is (the sea) with the Latin masculine adjective profundus (deep) intended to mean a deep-sea organism (the neuter of profundus is profundum). The specific epithet is ferrum (Latin noun), iron and oxus (Greek adjective), acid or sour, and in combined words indicating oxygen. (N.L. v. oxydare, to make acid, to oxidize; N.L. part. adj. ferrooxydans, iron-oxidizing.) ==See also== * Proteobacterial phylogeny for more on placement ==References== ==External links== *Type strain of Mariprofundus ferrooxydans at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Zetaproteobacteria Category:Bacteria described in 2010 ",
