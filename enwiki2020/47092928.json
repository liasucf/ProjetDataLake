It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Song at the 11th Academy Awards with the song A Mist Over the Moon, with music by Ben Oakland and lyric by Oscar Hammerstein II. Although the writing credits differ, this film bears a striking resemblance to Columbia's 1933 film, Ann Carver's Profession.http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie;=6540 ==Plot== Bill Hayward's years as a college athlete and singer are behind him, and while he struggles financially, his attorney wife Ann is prospering, promoted to junior partner in her law firm. While she's in Washington, D.C., on business, Bill accompanies friends June and George to a New York City nightclub where they have been hired to entertain. He is persuaded to get on stage and sing himself, but resists the temptation to get into a romantic situation with June, a former girlfriend from their school days. June gets inebriated and a stumble results in her accidental death. Bill, however, is charged with her murder. Ann offers to defend him in court, but Bill can't bear that thought. When the case goes badly against him, however, Ann volunteers information that results in Bill's acquittal and their reconciliation. ==Cast== * Lanny Ross as William Hayward * Gloria Stuart as Ann Adams Hayward * Joan Marsh as June Lane * Roy Benson as George Martin * Pierre Watkin as Mr. Harper * Robert Paige as Ken Harper * Arthur Loft as Charles Clarke * Stanley Andrews as Baker * Jane Buckingham as Mrs. Harper (Jan Buckingham) * Bess Flowers as Miriam Harper * Ann Doran as Miss Hollins * Vesey O'Davoren as Langham ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1938 films Category:1938 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Erle C.
