    "text": "Public holidays in Canada, known as statutory holidays, stat holidays, or simply stats, consist of a variety of cultural, nationalistic, and religious holidays that are legislated in Canada at the federal or provincial and territorial levels. While many of these holidays are honoured and acknowledged nationwide, provincial and territorial legislation varies in regard to which are officially recognized. There are five nationwide statutory holidays, and six additional holidays for federal employees. Each of the 13 provinces and territories observes a number of holidays in addition to the nationwide days, but each varies in regard to which are legislated as either statutory, optional, or not at all. Currently, the provinces of Alberta and Prince Edward Island have the most legislated holidays in comparison to other provinces and territories, with 12 days off. Many public and private employers, as well as school systems, provide additional days off around the end of December, often including at least a full or half-day on December 24 (Christmas Eve) or December 31 (New Year's Eve), or in some cases the entire week between Christmas and New Year. While not officially legislated in any capacity, internationally notable cultural holidays such as Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Halloween, Mother's Day, and Father's Day are traditionally observed by Canadians as part of Canadian culture. == Statutory holidays == A statutory holiday (also known as \"stats\" or \"general\" or \"public\" holiday) in Canada is legislated either through the federal, or a provincial or territorial government. Most workers, public and private, are entitled to take the day off with regular pay. However, some employers may require employees to work on such a holiday, but the employee must either receive a day off in lieu of the holiday or must be paid at a premium rate \u2013 usually 1\u00bd (known as \"time and a half\") or twice (known as \"double time\") the regular pay for their time worked that day, in addition to the holiday pay (except for high technology workers in British Columbia). In most provinces, when a statutory holiday falls on a normal day off (generally a weekend), the following work day is considered a statutory holiday. Statistics Canada shows an average of 11 paid statutory holidays per year in regard to all firms and corporations operating within the province. === Nationwide statutory holidays in Canada === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! style=\"width:12%;\"| Date ! style=\"width:15%;\"| English name ! style=\"width:15%;\"| French name !| Remarks |- valign=top | January 1 || New Year's Day || Jour de l'An || Celebrates the first day of every year in the Gregorian calendar. |- valign=top | Variable date between March 20 and April 23 || Good Friday || Vendredi saint || Commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus, on the Friday before Easter.

Not a statutory holiday in any province or territory; however, in Quebec employers must give either Good Friday or Easter Monday as a statutory holiday, though most give both days. Banks remain open (legally they cannot close for more than three consecutive days except in emergencies), but employees often receive a \"floating\" paid day off to be taken on or near the holiday. This is not one of the nine \"General Holidays\" as defined by the Canada Labour Code \u2013 Part III. As such, there is no legal requirement for private sector employers in federally regulated industries to provide Easter Monday as a paid holiday to employees. However, many federal government offices will be closed on this day. |- valign=top | Monday before May 25 || Victoria Day || officially la F\u00eate de Victoria (more commonly called la F\u00eate de la Reine) or Journ\u00e9e nationale des Patriotes || Celebrates the birthday of the reigning Canadian monarch; however, the date does not change with the change of monarch, being instead fixed on the birthday of Queen Victoria, the sovereign at the time of Canadian Confederation and establishment of dominion status in 1867.

Although prescribed as public holidays, Victoria Day, Thanksgiving, and Boxing Day are not paid public holidays. Provincial statutory * Family Day \u2013 third Monday in February (since 2018) * New Brunswick Day \u2013 first Monday in August * Remembrance Day \u2013 November 11 Optional * Victoria Day * Thanksgiving * Boxing Day === Newfoundland and Labrador === * Five nationwide and one provincial statutory holiday. Thanksgiving is not a statutory holiday. Canada Day is not a statutory holiday as July 1 is Memorial Day. Provincial statutory * Memorial Day (July 1) * Armistice Day (November 11) Optional * Saint Patrick's Day (March 17) * Saint George's Day (April 23) * Discovery Day (June 24) * Orangemen's Day (July 12) These have not been observed as statutory holidays since 1992. They are, however, observed by the provincial government. Unlike most other provinces, there is no province-wide holiday on the first Monday in August. It may be seen as redundant due to the Royal St. John's Regatta, which is observed as a civic holiday in St. John's on the first Wednesday in August (or, in case of poor weather, the next suitable day thereafter). Harbour Grace and Labrador City have a similar holiday for their regatta in late July. All other municipalities are entitled to designate one day a year as a civic holiday, however many do not take advantage of this. === Northwest Territories === Five nationwide holidays and five territorial statutory holidays. Territorial statutory * Victoria Day \u2013 Monday preceding May 25 * National Aboriginal Day \u2013 June 21 * Civic Holiday \u2013 first Monday in August * Remembrance Day \u2013 November 11 * Thanksgiving \u2013 second Monday of October === Nova Scotia === Five nationwide holidays plus two provincial holidays. Victoria Day, Thanksgiving, and Boxing Day are not statutory holidays but most businesses and retail are closed Boxing Day. Most statutory holidays can be substituted for a mutually agreeable alternative paid day off in lieu or employers can require employees to work at a premium rate of pay. Several types of employment, including workplaces covered by a collective agreement, are exempt from provincial rules governing statutory holidays. Provincial statutory * Heritage Day \u2013 This holiday is held on the third Monday of February since 2015, and celebrates notable people, events and locations from the province's history. In 2015, Heritage Day celebrated Black Nova Scotian civil rights activist and businesswoman Viola Desmond. * Remembrance Day \u2013 November 11; this holiday has been governed separately from all other public holidays in Nova Scotia since 1981: it is illegal for any person to offer any goods or real property for sale on this date, or to accept or offer employment in exchange for gain or reward. There are special exemptions for workers who are employed in certain categories but an alternative day off with pay must be offered in lieu. Optional * Natal Day \u2013 first Monday in August; not a statutory holiday but a common day off in Halifax Regional Municipality. === Nunavut === Five nationwide and four territorial statutory holidays. Boxing Day is not a statutory holiday.

It became a \u00bd day holiday for Government employees in 1999 and a full day in 2001. Most employers give the day off with the notable exceptions being the Federal Government and the North West Company. Not a statutory holiday. === Ontario === Five nationwide and four provincial statutory holidays plus one common municipal holiday. Martin Luther King Jr. Day is officially recognized only in Toronto and Ottawa, though not as a paid holiday.https://www.chfi.com/2018/01/15/martin-luther-king-jr-day- toronto/http://blackhistoryottawa.weebly.com/2019-martin-luther-king-day.html Provincial statutory * Family Day \u2013 third Monday in February * Victoria Day \u2013 Monday preceding May 25 * Thanksgiving \u2013 second Monday of October * Boxing Day \u2013 December 26 Optional * August Civic Public Holiday \u2013 first Monday in August.

Provincial statutory * Islander Day \u2013 third Monday in February (originally second). * Remembrance Day \u2013 November 11 Optional * Gold Cup Parade Day celebrated mainly in the capital city of Charlottetown on the third Friday in August marking the end of the Provincial Exhibition and the Gold Cup and Saucer race at the Charlottetown Driving Park, which is a bank and contract holiday for some Civil Servants (others get the first Monday of August as a Civic Holiday). * Easter Monday * Victoria Day \u2013 Monday preceding May 25 * Civic Holiday \u2013 first Monday in August (Federal government only) * Thanksgiving \u2013 second Monday of October * Boxing Day \u2013 December 26 === Quebec === In Quebec, there are five nationwide and three provincial statutory holidays.

The official statutory holidays are: * January 1 (New Year\u2019s Day) * Good Friday or Easter Monday at the employer\u2019s choice * Monday preceding May 25 (National Patriots' Day) * June 24 (National Holiday) * July 1. If this date falls on a Sunday: July 2 (Canada Day) * First Monday in September (Labour Day) * Second Monday in October (Thanksgiving) * December 25 (Christmas Day). Optional * Construction Holiday () takes place during the last two weeks of July and also the last two weeks of December for Christmas holidays.

In addition, Easter Monday, Boxing Day, and Heritage Day are statutory for public service workers. Many employers give their employees days off that may not be statutory holidays in the particular province, particularly Boxing Day. Territorial statutory * Victoria Day \u2013 Monday preceding May 25 * Discovery Day \u2013 third Monday in August * Thanksgiving \u2013 second Monday in October * Remembrance Day \u2013 November 11 * National Aboriginal Day \u2013 June 21 since 2017http://www.community.gov.yk.ca/stat_holidays.htmlhttp://www.gov.yk.ca/news/17-098.html Optional * Heritage Day \u2013 Friday before the last Sunday in February \u2013 optional for non-public service workers === Municipal holidays === Some municipalities also have local statutory holidays. For instance, the morning of the Stampede Parade is often given as a half-day holiday in the city of Calgary. In Ontario, the August Civic Holiday is not defined provincially, but by each municipality. == Civic holidays == In Canada, there are two definitions of the term \"civic holiday\": === Legal definition === By law, a civic holiday is defined as any holiday which is legally recognized and for which employers are obliged to offer holiday pay. === August Civic Holiday === In parts of Canada, the term \"Civic Holiday\" is a generic name referring to the annual holiday on the first Monday of August. However, this definition is far from uniform nationwide as Quebec, Newfoundland, and Yukon do not recognize it at all (in the Yukon the civic holiday is celebrated instead on the third Monday of August as Discovery Day). Five other provinces (Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island) do not oblige employers to offer holiday pay on this day, thus not making it a civic holiday in the legal sense. No universal name is recognized for this holiday \u2013 the official name varies between the provinces and even between municipalities within Ontario. In Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, it is a statutory holiday. The Civic Holiday is meant to replace a city's birthday, also known as Natal Day. Instead of each city and town having a separate birthday celebration and day off, the August Civic Holiday is observed. For example, the Halifax Regional Municipality is made up of the former cities of Halifax and Dartmouth and the town of Bedford. Each of these places used to hold civic birthday celebrations on different days. Many people lived in one jurisdiction but worked in another. This meant significant confusion arose as to which day a person would be excused from work. This holiday is commonly referred to as \"August Long Weekend\" but this is not a government term. == Proposed holidays == The other leading candidate for a new holiday is a weekend in February to celebrate the anniversary of the Canadian flag, or more likely a general \"Heritage Day\". February 15 is already designated as Flag Day, but this is simply a day of commemoration, not a statutory holiday. In the province of Nova Scotia, which has relatively few days off, a bill has been introduced for a new holiday for the third Monday in February, to start in 2015. In November 2014, Bill C-597 passed second reading in the House of Commons by a margin of 258 to 2. If the bill becomes law, Remembrance Day would become a federal holiday in Canada. In 2001, members of the 14th Legislative Assembly passed the National Aboriginal Day Act making the Northwest Territories the first jurisdiction in Canada to recognize this day as a formal statutory holiday. == Holidays occurring on non-work days == For federally regulated workers, if a holiday occurs on a day that is normally not worked, then \"...another day off with pay will be provided\". When New Year's Day, Canada Day, Remembrance Day, Christmas Day or Boxing Day falls on a Saturday or Sunday which a federally regulated worker would not normally work, they are entitled to a holiday with pay on the working day immediately before or after the holiday. If one of the other holidays falls on a weekend, then the employer must add a holiday with pay to their employees\u2019 annual vacation or give them a paid day off at another mutually convenient time. == Other observances == * Raoul Wallenberg Day, January 17 * Groundhog Day, February 2 * Valentine's Day, February 14 * National Flag of Canada Day, February 15 * International Women's Day, March 8 * Commonwealth Day, the second Monday in March. This has been observed as a holiday in some Commonwealth countries. * Saint Patrick's Day, March 17 * April Fool's Day, April 1 * Tartan Day, April 6 * Earth Day, April 22 * Victory in Europe Day, May 8 * Mother's Day, second Sunday of May * Father's Day, third Sunday of June * Loyalist Day, June 19, celebrating Canada's Loyalist heritage, particularly in Ontario and New Brunswick (also the day Upper Canada was created, now Ontario) * National Indigenous Peoples Day, June 21 as part of the Celebrate Canada series * Canadian Multiculturalism Day, June 27 as part of the Celebrate Canada series * National Peacekeepers' Day, August 9 observed on the closest Sunday * National Grandparents' Day, second Sunday in September * National Family Week, week before Thanksgiving * Halloween, October 31 * National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, December 6 == See also == * List of festivals in Canada * List of holidays by country == References == == Further reading == * == External links == * Statutory Holidays in British Columbia * Statutory Holidays in Quebec * iCal Calendars found for \u2018Canada\u2019 iCalShare * Overview of Canadian statutory holidays Canada ",
