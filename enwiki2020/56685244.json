The series currently airs on Netflix in the United States, on OUTtv in Canada, and Amazon Prime in the United Kingdom and Australia. The series is created and hosted by the Boulet Brothers, who challenge a different set of eleven drag artists from around the world to compete in an underground style drag competition each season. The artists compete for the chance to win a cash prize and the crown of \"Dragula - the World\u2019s Next Drag Supermonster\". The show celebrates underground and alternative drag art, and bases each episode's challenges on the four principles of the show - \"Drag\", \"Filth\", \"Horror\" and \"Glamour\". Competitors on the show are tasked week to week in a variety of challenges ranging from costume creation, special-effects makeup, live performance and acting abilities. Each episode a winner is chosen, and the two contestants who end up on the bottom must face extreme \"extermination challenges\" which test them physically and psychologically to prove they have the punk spirit required by the judges to remain in the competition. ==History== The Boulet Brothers, at Los Angeles DragCon 2018 The Boulet Brothers Dragula is created and produced by the Boulet Brothers, and their production company Boulet Brothers Productions. The reality show is loosely based on their club event and nightlife pageant of the same name. The first season of The Boulet Brothers Dragula premiered on October 31, 2016 and aired as a six episode pilot series on the YouTube channel Hey Qween!. Later that year, the show was picked up by Canadian network OutTV who ordered a full remastered and expanded version of Season 1, as well as a full second season of the show. Season 2 premiered on October 31, 2017 and aired on Amazon Prime and WOW Presents in the United States. The season aired on Amazon Prime in the United Kingdom, OUTtv in Canada and SBS Viceland in Australia. The series' third season premiered on Amazon Prime on August 27, 2019. Dragula became the first American reality television competition to feature a drag king after Landon Cider appeared as a contestant in Season 3. Beginning October 31, 2019, seasons 2 and 3 of the series moved to the American streaming service Netflix. == Format == Each episode opens with a scripted scene starring the Boulet Brothers that introduces the episode\u2019s theme and challenge. The rest of the episode is filmed in a reality TV documentary format. The competitors are issued that week\u2019s challenge, and must work among each other, work out their interpersonal issues and create their looks and performances for that week. === Floor show === Each episode features a main \u201cFloor Show\u201d where each of the competitors display their looks and performance on the main stage. The performances and looks are judged, and one competitor is chosen the winner while the two or more lowest scoring competitors are put up for \u201cextermination\u201d. === Extermination challenges === The show features \"Extermination Challenges\", fear-based physical and psychological tests created to push the competitors to \u201cface their fears\u201d in order to remain on the show. Past extermination challenges have included being buried alive in a coffin, being pierced with gauged needles, skydiving, eating cow intestines, and surviving an evening in an extreme haunted house. The competitor who fails the extermination challenge is \"killed off\" by the Boulet Brother's in a scripted scene at the end of each episode. == Judges == The Boulet Brothers serve as the primary judges on the show, and are the only regular judges on the panel. Each episode they are joined by a rotating cast of celebrity musicians, directors, writers and horror alumni including Henry Rollins, Milly Shapiro, Amanda Lepore, Bonnie Aarons, Felissa Rose, Danielle Harris, Rachel True, and Cig Nuetron. American horror film director Darren Stein and drag legend Peaches Christ are the only judges to have appeared in all three seasons of the show. ==Series overview== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:90%; width:100%; text-align:center\" |- style=\"height: 4em;\" ! style=\"width:2em;\"|Season !

Vice writer Jeff Leavell reviewed the series as being \"loud, weird\" and that it \"pisses on heteronormativity\". He also said that Dragula should not be thought of as \"just a show about drag queens who love grotesque, hardcore queer performance art\", and that \"in its own way, it's encouraging us to stand united, whether you're a supermonster or not\". Adam Zee of Wussy Magazine praised the series for its philosophy towards drag, exemplified by the Boulet Brothers' statement that \"We are not here to judge your drag. Drag is art and art is subjective.\" Zee commented that: > \"While it seems simple, this simple idea is what truly distinguishes The > Boulet Brother's\u2019 Dragula from RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race and most other reality > competitions. The Boulets place significant value in the artistic merit and > anti-establishment traditions of drag. They have directed their focus on > drag artistry that is unpredictable, outlandish and disturbing rather than > getting queens to conform to show business standards. The only molds > contestants must fit into are challenge-based or the loose overarching > tenets of Filth, Glamour and Horror. Even then, 2 out of 3 is usually good > enough to get by.\" The show has also received favorable coverage for its inclusion of all genders and types of drag performers in the competition, and the series was the first televised U.S. show to feature a drag king and an AFAB drag artist. ==See also== * List of programs broadcast by OUTtv * List of reality television programs with LGBT cast members ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * ==External links== * * * * * * Category:2010s LGBT-related reality television series Category:2010s Canadian reality television series Category:2010s American LGBT-related television series Category:Drag (clothing) television shows Category:Television series by World of Wonder (company) Category:OutTV (Canadian TV channel) original programming Category:2010s Canadian LGBT-related television series Category:American LGBT- related web series Category:2020s Canadian LGBT-related television series Category:2020s American LGBT-related television series Category:Canadian LGBT- related web series ",
