    "text": "Osmund (fl. ) was a King of Sussex, apparently reigning jointly with Oswald, \u00c6lfwald, and Oslac. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, version D, Osmund was reigning in Sussex when Archbishop Cuthbert died in 760, so his rule commenced before that event. Osmund issued a charter, dated 762 in error for 765, as Osmundus. Osmund also issued a charter dated 770 in which he is listed as Osmundus rex. So Osmund\u2019s reign was from in or before 760 to between 770 and 772, as he witnessed a charter of Offa, King of Mercia, dated 772 as Osmund dux. Evidently he was demoted from king to ealdorman following Offa's conquest of Sussex. ==References== ==External links== * Category:770s deaths Category:South Saxon monarchs Category:8th-century English monarchs Category:Year of birth unknown ",
