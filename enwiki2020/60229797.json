The Falcons were led by first-year head coach Scot Loeffler and played their home games at Doyt Perry Stadium in Bowling Green, Ohio. They competed as members of the East Division of the Mid-American Conference (MAC). ==Preseason== ===Coaching changes=== Seven games into the 2018 season, Bowling Green fired third-year head coach Mike Jinks; defensive coordinator Carl Pelini served as interim head coach for the remainder of the season. On November 28, 2018, the school announced that Scot Loeffler had been hired to become the new head coach. Loeffler had spent the previous three seasons as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Boston College. On December 4, Loeffler announced that he would retain Pelini as defensive coordinator and hired former Western Michigan tight ends coach Terry Malone to be the new offensive coordinator. On December 10, former Louisville defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder was announced as the new linebackers coach. He was promoted to defensive coordinator in February 2019 after Carl Pelini left to pursue other opportunities. ===MAC media poll=== The MAC released their preseason media poll on July 23, 2019, with the Falcons predicted to finish in sixth place in the East Division. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |align=\"center\" Colspan=\"3\" |East Division |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 1 || Ohio || 144 (24) |- align=\"center\" | 2 || Miami || 107 |- align=\"center\" | 3 || Buffalo || 100 |- align=\"center\" | 4 || Kent State || 62 |- align=\"center\" | 5 || Akron || 54 |- align=\"center\" | 6 || Bowling Green || 37 |} ==Schedule== Bowling Green's non-conference schedule will consist of home games against Morgan State of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) and Louisiana Tech of Conference USA; and road games against Kansas State of the Big 12 Conference and Notre Dame, a football independent.
