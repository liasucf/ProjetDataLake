    "text": "Salt the Wound was an American deathcore band from Cleveland, Ohio, formed in 2001. The band is signed to Rotten Records and have released three full-length studio albums. After the release of their debut album, Carnal Repercussions the band would continuously tour to an overwhelming extent, which led to their disbandment during the first half of 2010. With later negotiations, the group reformed in 2011 with original as well as new members releasing their next full-length studio album Kill the Crown. ==Biography== ===Formation=== Salt the Wound was founded on September 11, 2001 as a duo by their original drummer, James Anthony Agrippe, and guitar player Mike Kawkabany. The group continued on as duo until 2003, where additional members joined and assumed the requirements of a full band. Vocalist Kevin Schafer was welcomed during this year, which then shortly led to these three recruiting Abe Zieleniec as the band's bassist and Jake Scott as another guitar player. ===Rotten Records and disestablishment=== The band released two EPs in 2004 and 2005 respectively, but didn't record and release their demo that had them searching for a label until 2007, which led to Salt the Wound being signed to Rotten Records. Salt the Wound achieved underground success in 2008 through their debut studio album, Carnal Repercussions which attracted radio airplay as well as touring requests. By 2009, the album collectively sold 75,000 copies worldwide. By mid of 2009, the group finished recording their second full- length album, entitled Ares, which was released September 15, 2009 and features Matthew Wessoly, their final vocalist incepted into the band before their disbandment. On October 30, 2009, Salt the Wound announced that they were \"hanging up the towel\". They held a farewell tour at the beginning of 2010, holding their final show in the states in their hometown of Cleveland.Salt the Wound to Disband in 2010, Announces Final Tour metalunderground.com.

Retrieved 2009-11-11 ===Reformation and second disestablishment=== Salt the Wound announced in November, 2010 that they have officially reformed (with original vocalist Kevin Schaefer, original guitar player Jake Scott, and The Analyst drummer Brandon Tabor). The band released their third full-length album entitled Kill the Crown in March 2011, which was produced by Brian White. Their next studio album was supposedly confirmed to have been in the works as stated by guitarist Scott, although its status has been unknown since 2014. Their social media pages have been inactive since 2015 as well, thus leading to the presumption of their second disbandment. ==Musical style== Salt the Wound's musical style is essentially deathcore but also includes influences of melodic death metal in their music. Their vocal style contains death metal-stylized death growl vocals along with metalcore screaming and \"pig squeal\" vocals in earlier albums. The drumming is described as \"ultra- fast\" and includes blast beats. The guitar work features a lower tuning for the rhythm guitar position, but a higher tuning for the lead position, and is usually played at intricate riffs. Salt the Wound have stated that they are primarily influenced by bands such as All Shall Perish, The Black Dahlia Murder, and The Dillinger Escape Plan. ==Band members== ;Current members * Jake Scott - guitars (2003-2010, 2010\u20132015) * Kevin Schaefer - vocals (2003-2008, 2010\u20132015) * Brandon Tabor - drums (2008-2009, 2010-2015) * Brian White - guitars (2011\u20132015) * Cole Martinez - bass (2011\u20132015) ;Former members * James Anthony Agrippe - drums (2001-2006) * Mike Kawkabany - guitars, vocals (2001-2004) * Abe Zieleniec - bass (2003) * Vince Stropki - bass, guitars (2003-2004, 2008-2010) * Nick Cetrone - drums (2007-2008) * Brian \"Brooklyn\" Martinez - bass (2008-2009) * Tim McCullough - drums (2008-2009) * Matthew Tanner - vocals (2008-2009) * Rob Walters - drums (2009-2010) * Mat Wessoly - vocals (2009-2010) * Dave Mihalik - bass (2010-2011) ==Timeline== ImageSize =width:800 height:auto barincrement:25 PlotArea =left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:0 Alignbars =justify DateFormat =mm/dd/yyyy Period =from:09/11/2001 till:12/12/2015 ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2002 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2002 TimeAxis =orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend =orientation:horizontal position:bottom Colors= id:vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitars id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:studio value:black legend:Studio_albums id:other value:gray(0.5) legend:Demos/EPs id:bars value:gray(0.95) LineData= at:12/01/2004 color:other layer:back at:07/01/2004 color:other layer:back at:09/01/2004 color:other layer:back at:08/18/2005 color:other layer:back at:01/01/2007 color:other layer:back at:02/05/2008 color:black layer:back at:09/15/2009 color:black layer:back at:03/15/2011 color:black layer:back BackgroundColors= bars:bars BarData= bar:Kevin text:\"Kevin Schaefer\" bar:Matt text:\"Matthew Tanner\" bar:Matt2 text:\"Matthew Wesolly\" bar:Mike text:\"Mike Kawkabany\" bar:Jake text:\"Jake Scott\" bar:Brian text:\"Brian White\" bar:Abe text:\"Abe Zieleniec\" bar:Vince text:\"Vince Stropki\" bar:Brian2 text:Brian Martinez\" bar:Dave text:\"Dave Mihalik\" bar:Cole text:\"Cole Martinez\" bar:Jim text:\"Jim Agrippe\" bar:Nick text:\"Nick Cetrone\" bar:Brandon text:\"Brandon Tabor\" bar:Tim text:\"Tim McCullough\" bar:Rob text:\"Rob Walters\" PlotData = width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Kevin from:01/01/2003 till:09/01/2008 color:vocals bar:Kevin from:11/01/2010 till:01/01/2015 color:vocals bar:Matt from:09/01/2008 till:11/01/2009 color:vocals bar:Matt2 from:11/01/2009 till:02/01/2010 color:vocals bar:Mike from:09/11/2001 till:06/01/2004 color:guitar bar:Mike from:09/11/2001 till:06/01/2004 color:vocals width:2.5 bar:Jake from:01/01/2003 till:02/01/2010 color:guitar bar:Jake from:11/01/2010 till:01/01/2015 color:guitar bar:Brian from:11/01/2011 till:01/01/2015 color:guitar bar:Abe from:01/01/2003 till:06/01/2003 color:bass bar:Vince from:06/01/2003 till:12/31/2004 color:bass bar:Vince from:01/01/2008 till:06/01/2010 color:bass bar:Vince from:01/01/2008 till:06/01/2010 color:guitar width:2.5 bar:Brian2 from:01/01/2008 till:12/01/2009 color:bass bar:Dave from:06/01/2010 till:02/01/2011 color:bass bar:Cole from:11/01/2011 till:01/01/2015 color:bass bar:Jim from:09/11/2001 till:06/01/2007 color:drums bar:Nick from:06/01/2007 till:01/01/2008 color:drums bar:Brandon from:03/01/2008 till:05/01/2009 color:drums bar:Brandon from:11/01/2010 till:01/01/2015 color:drums bar:Tim from:04/01/2008 till:02/01/2009 color:drums bar:Rob from:02/01/2009 till:06/01/2010 color:drums ==Discography== ;Albums * Carnal Repercussions (2008, Rotten) * Ares (2009, Rotten) * Kill the Crown (2011, Rotten) ;Demos and EPs * It's Taken Too Long (2004, demo) * Perceiving the Beauty of Nothing (2004, demo) * 3 Song Demo (2004, demo) * Bedsprings and Bloodshed (2005, self-released EP) * Demo 2007 (2007, demo) ==References== ==External links== * Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Ohio Category:American deathcore musical groups Category:American melodic death metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2001 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2010 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2011 Category:Musical groups from Cleveland Category:2001 establishments in Ohio ",
