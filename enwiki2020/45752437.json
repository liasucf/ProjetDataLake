    "text": "Lisa L. Moore is a Canadian-born American academic and poet. She is known for her writing about lesbian literature, art and garden history, and poetry. == Life and education == Lisa Moore was born in Calgary, Canada. Principal themes in Moore\u2019s work include the centrality of love between women to literary genres such as the novel, the landscape arts, and the sonnet; the transatlantic and multi-racial history of feminist art and thinking; and the importance of poetry to second-wave feminist, womanist, and lesbian cultures and politics. She earned a B.A. in English with honors at Queen's University in 1986, and then completed her doctorate at Cornell University in 1991. Moore joined the faculty at the University of Texas at Austin in 1991, where she is Archibald A. Hill Professor of English and Professor of Women's and Gender Studies. She is currently Director of the LGBTQ Studies Program at The University of Texas at Austin. == Work == Lisa Moore has published two single- authored books: Sister Arts: The Erotics of Lesbian Landscapes (Minnesota, 2011), which was awarded Lambda Literary Award in LGBT Studies in 2011 and named a finalist for the Publishing Triangle Judy Grahn Award; and Dangerous Intimacies: Toward a Sapphic History of the British Novel (Duke, 1997). In 2015, Moore published a scholarly edition of The Collected Poems of Anna Seward (Routledge). She also co-edited two books: Transatlantic Feminisms in the Age of Revolutions (Oxford, 2011) (with Joanna Brooks and Caroline Wigginton), which won the Choice Outstanding Academic Book Award for 2012; and Experiments in a Jazz Aesthetic: Art, Activism, Academia and the Austin Project (2010) (with Omi Osun Joni L. Jones, and Sharon Bridgforth), an anthology of creative writing and theory by women of color and allies. She has published articles in GLQ, Eighteenth-Century Studies, Cultural Critique, Feminist Studies, and Textual Practice, as well as more than 40 other book chapters, essays and reviews. Moore's poetry chapbook, 24 Hours of Men, was published by Dancing Girl Press in 2018. Her poems have also appeared in Texas Borderlands Poetry Review, Tinderbox Poetry Journal, Nimrod International Journal, and other venues. Her public scholarship includes essays for the Los Angeles Review of Books, The Women's Review of Books, and Diversity and Democracy.
