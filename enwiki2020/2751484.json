    "text": "More Fun Comics, originally titled New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine a.k.a. New Fun Comics,New Fun #v1#1 (Feb. 1935) at the Grand Comics Database. The entry notes that while the logo appears to be simply Fun, the indicia reads, \"New FUN is published monthly at 49 West 45th Street, New York, N.Y., by National Allied Publications, Inc.; Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, President ... Inquiries concerning advertising should be addressed to the Advertising Manager, New FUN,....\" was a 1935\u20131947 American comic book anthology that introduced several major superhero characters and was the first American comic-book series to feature solely original material rather than reprints of newspaper comic strips. It was also the first publication of the company that would become DC Comics. ==Publication history== Cover photo of the first issue of the series. In the latter half of 1934, having seen the emergence of Famous Funnies and other oversize magazines reprinting comic strips, Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson founded National Allied Publications and published New Fun #1 on January 11, 1935 (cover-dated February 1935). A tabloid-sized, 10-inch by 15-inch, 36-page magazine with a card-stock, non-glossy cover, it was an anthology of humor features, such as the funny animal comic \"Pelion and Ossa\" and the college-set \"Jigger and Ginger\", mixed with such dramatic fare as the Western strip \"Jack Woods\" and the \"yellow peril\" adventure \"Barry O'Neill\", featuring a Fu Manchu-styled villain, Fang Gow. The first issue also featured humor strip \"Caveman Capers\", an adaptation of the 1819 novel Ivanhoe, spy drama \"Sandra of the Secret Service\", and a strip based on an early Walt Disney creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Most significantly, however, whereas some of the existing publications had eventually included a small amount of original material, generally as filler, New Fun #1 was the first comic book containing all-original material. Additionally, it carried advertising, whereas previous comic books were sponsored by corporations such as Procter & Gamble, Kinney Shoes, and Canada Dry beverages, and ad-free. The first four issues were edited by future Funnies, Inc., founder Lloyd Jacquet,New Fun #v1#4 (May 1935) at the Grand Comics Database. the next, after a three-month hiatus, by Wheeler-Nicholson himself.New Fun #v1#5 (Aug. 1935) at the Grand Comics Database. Issue #6 (Oct. 1935) brought the comic-book debuts of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the future creators of Superman, who began their careers with the musketeer swashbuckler \"Henri Duval\" (doing the first two installments before turning it over to others) and, under the pseudonyms \"Leger and Reuths\", the supernatural adventurer Doctor Occult. They would remain on the latter title through issue #32 (June 1938), following the magazine's retitling as More Fun (issues #7\u20138, Jan.-Feb. 1936),. and More Fun Comics (#9-on).. In issue #101 (Feb. 1945), Siegel and Shuster introduced Superboy, a teenage version of Superman, in a new feature chronicling the adventures of the Man of Steel when he was a boy growing up in the rural Midwestern United States.Superboy at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

More Fun became a humor title that spotlighted the children's fantasy feature \"Jimminy and the Magic Book\".\"Jimminy and the Magic Book\" at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.
