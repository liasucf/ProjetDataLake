    "text": "Locharbriggs Locharbriggs is a village in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. It is located near the Lochar Water north-northeast of the town of Dumfries. It was one of several villages that stood on the edge of the Lochar Moss which was largely reclaimed in the 19th Century. According to the 2011 Census, the Locharbriggs locality (which also includes neighbouring Heathhall) was 6,031. Locharbriggs is known for the quarrying of distinctive red sandstone which has been used for buildings in towns and cities including Dumfries, Glasgow and Edinburgh. The stone has also been exported further afield, including for the construction of the steps of the Statue of Liberty in New York. Only one quarry now remains active. The village's amenities include bus services, three local shops, a public house (the Lochar Inn), a social club, a Chinese takeaway, fish and chip shop, hairdressers, community centre, a library, and a primary school. ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in Dumfries and Galloway Category:Dumfries ",
