Raised Catholic, he married Myriam Verbauwen in February 1962. They joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in June of that year, becoming Argentine pioneers. Due to their financial situation at the time and the lack of temples in South America, Sant\u00e1ngelo and his wife were not able to be sealed together in the temple until 11 years after their baptisms.
