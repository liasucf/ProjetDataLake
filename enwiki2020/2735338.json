Concord West is located 16 km west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Canada Bay. Concord is a separate suburb, to the east.

It shares the postcode of 2138 with Rhodes.

It was the site of the Battle of Concord, the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131778). Some historians believe the suburb was named Concord, to encourage a peaceful attitude between soldiers and settlers. The first land grants in the area were made in 1793.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, p.68 , page 286 Concord West was under the jurisdiction of Concord Council, until it amalgamated with Drummoyne Council in 2000 to form the City of Canada Bay. The surrounding parish is also named Concord Parish. A major historical figure in the area was Thomas Walker (1804\u20131886), a philanthropist who lived in the Victorian Italianate mansion, Yaralla, on the shores of Parramatta River. When he died, Walker left substantial funds for the establishment of a convalescent hospital in the area. The hospital\u2014known as the Thomas Walker Hospital\u2014was designed by Sir John Sulman in the Federation Free Classical style and built on a large site north-west of Yaralla. It is now listed on the Register of the National Estate. Since the late 1970s, it has functioned as Rivendell Child, Adolescent and Family Unit, which specialises in the treatment of young people with psychological problems. Walker's philanthropic work was continued by his daughter Dame Eadith Walker (1861\u20131937), who was awarded a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919, and was made a Dame 1929.Parramatta River Walk, Department of Planning, New South Wales, 1989, p.16 The family home, Yaralla, eventually became the Dame Eadith Walker Hospital; like the Thomas Walker Hospital, it was listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/23 Dame Eadith also aided in establishing the Concord Repatriation General Hospital. == Heritage listings == Concord West has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Hospital Road: Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital Buildings * The Drive: Yaralla Estate ==Commercial area== Concord West has a group of shops beside Concord West railway station.
