He had been promoted to first lieutenant by the time of the sieges of Kaiserswerth and Venlo. From 1702 he became general adjutant of Dubislav Gneomar von Natzmer. With Natzmer's help, Platen became a deputy in the Gensdarmes' regiment. In 1703 he was involved in the siege of Bonn.

He participated in the conquests of Lille and Ghent as well as in Mons. In 1709 he fought in the decisive Battle of Malplaquet. There, he impressed Frederick William, then the Prussian crown prince, who introduced him to the king and rewarded him with estates at Putzermin and half of Fritzow. Platen fought in 1710 at Douay, Bethune and Aire and, in 1711, at Bouchain.

On 12 May 1743, Frederick II appointed him general of the cavalry, but whether he ever learned of it is unclear, since he died in 17 May 1743 in Mohrungen. ==Sources== Category:1743 deaths Category:1668 births Category:Generals of Cavalry (Prussia) Category:German military personnel of the War of the Austrian Succession Category:Platen family ",
