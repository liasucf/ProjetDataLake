His father, Gil MacDougall, played for the Balmain Tigers and Western Suburbs Magpies NSWRFL.List of family relations in rugby league#MacDougall brothers In retirement, MacDougall founded a nutrition company that produces the popular meal replacement product, The MAN Shake. ==Background== MacDougall was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. ==Sydney Roosters== MacDougall made his first-grade debut for the Sydney City Roosters in the 1995 ARL season. ==Newcastle Knights== MacDougall is third on the club's all time try scorers list and sixth on the club's all time point- scorers list. In MacDougall's first season with Newcastle he scored five tries in eleven games that culminated in the club's victory in the 1997 ARL Grand Final where he famously, but accidentally stood on the head of Manly-Warringah captain Geoff Toovey after being tackled by the Manly halfback. In 1998, MacDougall made his representative debut for New South Wales rugby league team after a stellar start to the season. On 8 July 1998, MacDougall tested positive to stimulants ephedrine and amfepramone. MacDougall's A and B samples both also recorded an epitestosterone to testosterone level greater than the allowable 6:1 ratio \u2013 indicating the possible use of steroids. On 28 August he pleaded guilty to using one banned stimulant and was found to have inadvertently used another and received an 11-match ban along with teammates Robbie O'Davis and Wayne Richards who each received 22-week bans. It was revealed during his appeal that MacDougall had suffered a severe head injury in 1993 that damaged his pituitary gland and it was essential that he take prescribed medication, called Sustanon 250, which included a banned steroid. This medication restored normal hormone levels in his body and without it, he would suffer potentially serious side effects and not be able to lead a normal life, let alone play football.The Herald Performance drug use report shocks After just two games back for the Knights in 1999, MacDougall was recalled to the New South Wales rugby league team.
