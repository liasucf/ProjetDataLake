A peaceful protest about the event escalated into several days of rioting that spread across London and beyond,Gyamfi, Akua, \"Mark Duggan documentary The Hard Stop: \u2018It\u2019s an independent, observational, cinematic film\u2019\", BFI, 4 August 2016. and for a time made news headlines around the world. ==Background== The film begins with Martin Luther King Jr.'s quote: \"A riot is the language of the unheard\",Dannreuther, Anna, \"EXCLUSIVE: Interview With George Amponsah, Director of The Hard Stop\", Rights Info, 9 June 2016. which Catherine Bray of Variety says \"intelligently informs and underpins the entire pic\" as it \"grapples sincerely with the cultural context of a wave of riots that broke out across England in the summer of 2011, in the wake of the fatal police shooting of London resident Mark Duggan.\"Bray, Catherine, \"Film Review: \u2018The Hard Stop\", Variety, 29 October 2015. Picking up the story in the period after media coverage of it waned, Amponsah's film sheds light on the environment from which Mark Duggan came. Focusing on two of his childhood friends, Marcus Knox-Hooke and Kurtis Henville, against the backdrop of their home on Broadwater Farm \u2014 an estate that notoriously was the scene of a 1985 riot triggered by tensions between the police and local black people \u2014 the film follows the journey of the two young black men over 24 months, until the 2012 verdict that found Duggan to have been \"lawfully killed\".Portocarrero, Marta, \"The Hard Stop: Mark Duggan's best friend says 'one day police will tell the world what actually happened'\", The Independent, 14 July 2016. Marcus Knox-Hooke was accused of being the instigator of the 2011 riots and, though that charge was dropped, he was sentenced to 32 months' imprisonment following a prosecution for other offences. Producer Dionne Walker has said: \"We started with Marcus but then he went to prison. There was a whole inquest\u2026 [then] you see in the film where it was a clear decision to follow Kurtis and his home life, which helped set the context of the film. It\u2019s a microcosm, but there were wider issues going on.\u2026 It\u2019s not an investigative Panorama-esque TV format documentary. It\u2019s an independent, observational, cinematic film.\" In the words of Amponsah, \"Our objective is to tell a story and engage an audience. When Marcus is in the cab on his way to being sentenced and starts crying because of the frustration of his friend and what\u2019s about to happen to him, I don\u2019t put down the camera.... The story that you see on the screen, we\u2019re talking about over 130 hours of footage. It all came down to the editing.\u2026 The emotional investment is in the edit.\" ==Reception== The Hard Stop had its world premiere on 14 September 2015 at the Toronto International Film Festival,Barnes, Henry, \"'These things are universal': new film examines story of Mark Duggan killing\", The Guardian, 13 September 2015.\"The Hard Stop\", British Films Directory, British Council.Sexton, David, \"The Hard Stop, film review: Mark Duggan film offers rare insight into anger of black youths\", Evening Standard, 15 September 2015. in addition to being screened on 17 October 2015 at the London Film Festival,Palmer, Jim, \"12 London-set films ready to wow audiences at London Film Festival\", Wandsworth Guardian, 21 September 2015.\"The Hard Stop (2015) | Release Info\", IMDb. prior to general release in the UK on 15 July 2016.\"Insight: 'The Hard Stop', a new documentary to be released on 15 July 2016\", Bindmans LLP, 7 July 2016.
