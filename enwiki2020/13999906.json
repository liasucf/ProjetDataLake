The invitation incited an uproar amongst the predominantly conservative Utah County community. Vogel subsequently wrote a book about the experience entitled Free Speech 101; the book became a 2007 Independent Publisher Book Award Finalist. An award-winning documentary, This Divided State (in which Vogel appears), also recounts the story of Michael Moore's controversial visit to Utah Valley. ==Published works== * * * * * * * ==Notes== ==External links== *Joseph Vogel Official web site Category:1981 births Category:American music critics Category:American music journalists Category:Writers from Rochester, New York Category:Utah Valley University alumni Category:University of Rochester Category:Living people it:Joseph Vogel ",
