He received it at the second session of AVNOJ in the Bosnian town of Jajce on November 29, 1943, and held it until his death on May 4, 1980. Understanding the propaganda effects uniforms had on the general population, Tito had more than 70 different marshal uniforms. ==Adjutants to the Marshal of Yugoslavia== Colonel General (pictured in 1944), longest-serving Adjutant to the Marshal of Yugoslavia {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! !
