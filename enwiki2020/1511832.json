    "text": "Zbur\u0103tor is a Romanian word for \"flyer\". The Flyer is a Romanian folklore roving spirit who makes love to maidens by night. He is sometimes called zmeu, another dragon-like creature, with more human-like aspects. It has a tail of fire and is a wolf-headed dragon. The \"zbur\u0103tor\" or \"sbur\u0103tor\" can also refer to a demon that takes the shape of a young handsome man, visiting women in their sleep, like the incubus. Dimitrie Cantemir wrote about the myth concerning it in Descriptio Moldaviae (1714\u20131716). The \"zburator\" appears as \"a ghost, a young, handsome man who comes in the middle of the night at women, especially recently married ones and does indecent things with them, although he cannot be seen by other people, not even by the ones who waylay him\". Later references to this myth appear in the romantic poem by Ion Heliade R\u0103dulescu Zbur\u0103torul. The myth reappears in the late romantic literature, in poems such as C\u0103lin (file de poveste) (C\u0103lin (story pages)) and Luceaf\u0103rul (The Evening Star) (1884) by Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu. ==References== * Dracones, Enciclopedia Dacica (in Romanian) ==External links== Category:Romanian mythology Category:European dragons Category:Romanian legendary creatures ",
