    "text": "\"Lust\" (stylized as \"LUST.\") is a song by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, from his fourth studio album Damn, released on April 14, 2017. The ninth track on the album (sixth on the Collector's Edition of Damn), the song was written by Lamar, DJ Dahi, Mark Spears Sounwave, and BadBadNotGood, and was produced by DJ Dahi, Sounwave, and BadBadNotGood. The song features guest vocals from record-producer Kaytranada, of which he is uncredited. Although not released as a single, the song charted in multiple countries in 2017. == Lyrics == The song is about routine; the things we allow to interrupt them, along with romantic lust and material desire. The song's lyrics also reflect Lamar's reaction to the 2016 presidential election, specifically the anger and confusion some of the nation felt in the wake of it. Specifically, Lamar speaks about the protests against Donald Trump, including the struggle to keep the energy up and sustain the protests long-term, without getting fatigued. By the end of the song, the theme of acceptance comes into play. The song features guest vocals from electronic musician Kaytranada, and marks the first time he has worked with Lamar. Jazz saxophonist Kamasi Washington, who played on Lamar's third studio album, To Pimp a Butterfly, assisted with the string arrangements. == Critical reception == Kathleen Johnston of GQ Magazine described \"Lust\" as the best song on Damn. == Live performances == Lamar performed \"Lust\" live at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 23, 2017. He performed the song seated in a cage accentuated by strings of LED lights. Lamar has performed \"Lust\" on the Damn tour. == Samples == The song contains a sample of Rat Boy's song \"Knock Knock Knock\", which first appeared on his 2015 mixtape Neighborhood Watch. When he found out about the sample, Rat Boy tweeted his appreciation. == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from the official Damn digital booklet. *Kendrick Duckworth \u2013 songwriter *Dacoury Natche \u2013 songwriter, producer *Mark Spears \u2013 songwriter, producer, strings *Chester Hansen \u2013 songwriter, producer *Alexander Sowinski \u2013 songwriter, producer *Matthew Tavares \u2013 songwriter, producer *Leland Whitty \u2013 songwriter, producer *Kamasi Washington \u2013 strings *Kaytranada \u2013 additional vocals *Rat Boy \u2013 additional vocals *Derek Ali \u2013 mixing *Tyler Page \u2013 mix assistant *Cyrus Taghipour \u2013 mix assistant == Short film == Months after the release of \"Lust\" and Damn, creative collective Combined Culture released a short film inspired by the track on June 17, 2017, in celebration of Lamar's 30th birthday earlier in June. == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 36 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) | 36 |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==Certifications== ==References== == External links == * Category:2017 songs Category:Kendrick Lamar songs Category:Songs written by Kendrick Lamar Category:Songs written by DJ Dahi Category:Songs written by Sounwave ",
