Holb\u00e6k Ladeg\u00e5rd was for centuries a home farm under Holb\u00e6k Castle, which was built to protect Holb\u00e6k and was held in fee by royal vassals. ==History== The estate is first mentioned in 1199 in a letter of gift from Bishop Absalon in which he grants it to Sor\u00f8 Abbey. Holb\u00e6k later developed into a small market town, which Holb\u00e6k Castle was built to defend during troubled times. The castle was held in fee by royal vassals and Holb\u00e6k Ladeg\u00e5rd served as the administrative center of the land. The estate was pawned several times and for a while referred to as the Duchy of Holb\u00e6k. Christoffer Festenberg Pax was granted the land in 1563 and farmed it until his death in 1608. He constructed a new home farm at the Castle but it later fell into neglect. A new home farm was finally built after a report in 1627 described the old one as \"dilapidated\". Holb\u00e6k Castle was destroyed by Swedish troops in 1659. The castle was not rebuilt but Holb\u00e6k Ladeg\u00e5rd with its tenant farms was instead sold to Henrik Thott, the owner of Boltinggaard. He ran into economic difficulty and had to sell the estate in 1667. The new owner was Bertel Bartholin, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, but he soon sold it again. The estate then changed hands many times. The estate was purchased by Gregers Juel in 1706. His son, Peder Juel, sold it to Hans Hansen Seidelin in 1752. He was already the owner of nearby Hagestedg\u00e5rd. He had no male heirs and the two estates were therefore entailed to his nephew, Hans Diderich de Brinck-Seidelin. It was the intention that he should create a stamhus for future generations of the Brinck-Seidelin famiy. The legal effect of a stamhus was that the estate could neither be sold nor divided between several heirs. Brinck-Seidelin purchased Eriksholm in 1753 and the stamhus was finally established from the three estates in 1769. Brinck-Seidelin's son, Hans de Brinck-Seidelin, inherited the estates in 1772. He demolished the old buildings of the three estates and replaced them with a single one at a new site in 1798. The stamhus was dissolved with royal approbation in 1809. Holb\u00e6k Ladeg\u00e5rd was then sold to Hans Peder Kofoed, a merchant and shipowner from Copenhagen. His widow took over the estate after his death in 1812. She managed it with great skill during the agricultural crisis of the 1820s. After her death in 1839, it was acquired by F. V. Rottb\u00f8ll. He sold most of the tenant farms to the tenant farmers. The remaining part of the estate was sold at auction after his death. The buyer was Baron Herman Frederik L\u00f8venskiold. The estate then changed hands several times before it was purchased by Paul Dahl in 1913. He commissioned the architect Thorvald J\u00f8rgensen to refurbish the main building and also expanded the farm buildings. Paul Dahl's son sold the estate to Holb\u00e6k Municipality in 1962. The land was then sold off in lots for new housing while the buildings and park were turned into a folk high school. ==List of owners== * ( -1661) The Crown * (1661-1667) Henrik Thott * (1667-1676) Bertel Bartholin * (1676-1684) Mouritz Podebusk * (1684-1691) Frederik Vittinghof Scheel * (1691-1706) Schack Brockdorff * (1706-1731) Gregers Juel * (1731-1752) Peder Juel * (1752) Hans Seidelin * (1752-1772) Hans Diderich de Brinck-Seidelin * (1772-1809) Hans de Brinck-Seidelin * (1809-1812) Hans Peder Kofoed * (1812-1839) Marie Kofoed * (1839-1866) F.
