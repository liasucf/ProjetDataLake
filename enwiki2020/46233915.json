    "text": "The Battle of Bloody Run was fought in 1656 near Richmond, Virginia. In 1654, the expansion of the Iroquois Nation (during the Beaver Wars) displaced several tribes from their homelands around Lake Erie. One tribe moved south into Virginia, settling temporarily around the James River. Records of the time refer to these people as the \"Richahecrians\", while James Lederer said they were \"Mahocks and Nahyssans\". The colonists in nearby Richmond were uneasy with the proximity of a potentially hostile force. Within two years, the Virginia General Assembly had given permission to Colonel Edward Hill to remove the Indian presence. His orders specifically stated that he was not to use force unless necessary.Noel, Tricia. The Battle of Bloody Run. Church Hill People\u2019s News. 2014-12-02. Web. Retrieved 2015-03-23. The Battle of Bloody Run that war should only be a last resort. Colonel Hill led the Colonial Rangers, reinforced by 100 Pamunkey warriors under Chief Totopotomoi. When five \"Richahecrian\" chiefs came to negotiate, Hill ordered they be taken and killed, which resulted in the attack by the opposing force. During the battle, Hill and his men retreated, resulting in the slaughter of their Indian allies, including Totopotomoi himself. The large number of casualties\u2014nearly all of the Pamunkey warriors, and a good part of the Colonial Rangers\u2014earned the site its name of Bloody Run, as the creek was said to have run red with blood. Afterward, Hill was disgraced because of his defeat, censured by the Virginia Assembly, and stripped of his rank. The creek was the site of another bloody battle 20 years later,Howe, Henry (1852).
