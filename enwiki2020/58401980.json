    "text": "The Tigre Juan Award () is a Spanish literary award created in 1977 in honor of the novel Tigre Juan. El curandero de su honra by Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez de Ayala. It is awarded to the best narrative work in Spanish published in the preceding year. It has had different sponsors: the founders, the Cervantes Bookstore, the Asturian Center, the City Council of Oviedo (1986\u20132009) and the Tribuna Ciudadana cultural association. ==History== The award was conceived with the aim of rewarding the best unpublished novella \u2013 regardless of whether the author was established or unknown \u2013 with input from Oviedo cultural figures such as , Juan Benito Arg\u00fcelles, , , Belarmino \u00c1lvarez Otero, Jaime Herrero, and Pepe Grossi (who all joined the Tribuna Ciudadana cultural association which was instituted three years later). It was presented for the first time at the Tigre Juan pub, located at Calle Mon No. 16, a meeting place for artists in the old area of Oviedo that was owned by \u00c1lvarez Otero, the award's first sponsor. In 1986, the Municipal Culture Foundation of the City Council took over the award, expanding its monetary prize and providing it with an organizational infrastructure in order to achieve a greater national presence. Four years later the bases of the contest were modified in order to reward the best first published narrative work, and made the award into the first one that supported, in addition to the author, the publisher who was taking a risk on a writer's first work. Its winners were generally young (although the 26th edition was won by 74-year-old filmmaker and novelist Jos\u00e9 Luis Borau). This second stage, in which the award achieved its greatest prominence, lasted until 2003. A new change in the bases led to awards from 2004 to 2007 for unpublished novels by established or well-known authors, but in 2008 it resumed the modality of awarding the best first narrative work in Spanish. The first endowment of this award was 100,000 pesetas; the 2009 award was \u20ac54,000 (\u20ac40,000 for the author and the rest for the publisher). The award was canceled in January and was delivered in May of the following year during the Oviedo Book Fair. In November 2009, citing the economic crisis as a reason, the city council announced that it was suspending its financing. Now the prize \u2013 a statuette inspired by an engraving by the Asturian artist Jaime Herrero and representing the character Tigre Juan \u2013 is given in the autumn and has no financial endowment. The award was given in 2010 and 2011 at the , and in 2012 at the Traslaburra restaurant in Oviedo. ==Winners== * 1978, for Jon\u00e1s (later published by KRK Ediciones) * 1979, Luis Mara\u00f1\u00f3n for Ojos en la noche (later self-published by the author) * 1980, for Jard\u00edn de Orates (later published by the Cervantes Bookstore and Ediciones del Serbal) * 1981, for Otras mujeres y Fabia (later published by Argos Vergara) * 1982, for Cosas de la transici\u00f3n (later published by Argos Vergara) * 1983, Santiago Ara\u00faz de Robles for La agon\u00eda florida de Carlos Brito (later published by Argos Vergara) * 1984, for La cruzada del perro (later published by J\u00facar) * 1985, for El cad\u00e1ver bajo el jard\u00edn (later published by J\u00facar) * 1986, for El viaje del obispo de Abisinia a los Santuarios de la Cristiandad (later published by J\u00facar) * 1987, for Sasia la viuda (later published by J\u00facar) * 1988, Luis Sep\u00falveda for Un viejo que le\u00eda novelas de amor (later published by J\u00facar) * 1989, Antonio Belmonte for La armada invendible (later published by J\u00facar) * 1990, for Qu\u00e9 te voy a contar, Anagrama * 1991, Francisco Casavella for El triunfo, Versal * 1992, Enriqueta Antol\u00edn for La gata con alas, Alfaguara * 1993, Bel\u00e9n Gopegui for La escala de los mapas, Anagrama * 1994, for Cuentos de un escritor sin \u00e9xito, Pretextos * 1995, Ismael Grasa for De Madrid al cielo, Anagrama * 1996, for Los seres heridos, Ediciones Nobel * 1997, for Fabulosas narraciones por historias, Lengua de Trapo * 1998, Imma Mons\u00f3 for Nunca se sabe, Tusquets * 1999, Fernando Palazuelos for La trastienda azul, Lengua de Trapo * 2000, Rodrigo Brunori for Me manda Stradivarius, Debate * 2001, Pablo Tusset for Lo mejor que le puede pasar a un cruas\u00e1n, Lengua de Trapo * 2002, Manuel Moyano for El amigo de Kafka (short stories), Pretextos * 2003, Jos\u00e9 Luis Borau for Camisa de once varas (short stories), Alfaguara * 2004, for El sue\u00f1o de Borges (later published by Algaida) * 2005, Ra\u00fal Argem\u00ed for Siempre la misma m\u00fasica (later published by Algaida) * 2006, Esther Bendahan for La cara de Marte (later published by Algaida) * 2007, for Ni\u00f1os de tiza (later published by Algaida) * 2009, \u00d3scar Calavia for Las botellas del se\u00f1or Klein, Lengua de Trapo * 2010, for Bajo el influjo del cometa (short stories), Salto de P\u00e1gina * 2011, for Diarios, 1999-2003, Pepita de Calabazas (finalist: \u00d3scar Esquivias with Pampanitos verdes) * 2012, Mario Mart\u00edn Gij\u00f3n for Inconvenientes del turismo en Praga y otros cuentos europeos, KRK (finalist: with Ensimismada correspondencia, Lengua de Trapo) * 2013, ex aequo: Marta Sanz for Daniela Astor y la caja negra, Anagrama and for La hora violeta, Mondadori (finalist: Yuri Herrera for La transmigraci\u00f3n de los cuerpos, Perif\u00e9rica) * 2014, for Contarlo todo, Mondadori (finalist: Selva Almada for Ladrilleros, Mar dulce) * 2015, Samanta Schweblin for Distancia de rescate (finalist: for Sin m\u00fasica) * 2016, for Nemo (finalist: Juan Jos\u00e9 Becerra for El espect\u00e1culo del tiempo) * 2017, Pedro Mairal for La uruguaya (finalist: for Kanada) * 2018, for A\u00f1os de mayor cuant\u00eda (finalist: Pablo Matilla for La sabidur\u00eda de quebrar huesos) ==References== Category:1977 establishments in Spain Category:Awards established in 1977 Category:Spanish literary awards ",
