Methone () was a town and polis (city-state) on the Pagasetic Gulf of Magnesia in ancient Thessaly.Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, p. 25 The town is mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad as belonging to Philoctetes. It is also mentioned in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax as a city in Magnesia, together with Iolcus, Coracae, Spalauthra and Olizon.Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, 65. Some accept that the town's location is on a hill called Nevestiki (), near the current village of Lekonas, where remains of a fortification have been found, but that location has been suggested by others as the site of Coracae. ==References== Category:Ancient Magnesia Category:Populated places in ancient Thessaly Category:Locations in the Iliad Category:Cities in ancient Greece Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Thessalian city-states ",
