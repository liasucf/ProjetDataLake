She was narrowly beaten in the July Cup and ended her career with a six length win in the Prix du Rond Point. After being retired from racing she came a broodmare and produced several minor winners. ==Background== Golden Opinion was a chestnut filly with white socks on her front feet bred in Kentucky by her owner, Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Slew o' Gold an outstanding performer on dirt in the United States who won Eclipse Awards in 1983 and 1984. Golden Opinion was the first foal of her dam Optimistic Lass who showed top-class form in a brief racing career, winning the Musidora Stakes and the Nassau Stakes in 1984. She later produced Joyful, the grand-dam of the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Samitar. Golden Opinion was sent to Europe and entered training with Andr\u00e9 Fabre in France. She was ridden in all of her races by Cash Asmussen. ==Racing career== ===1989: three-year-old season=== Golden Opinion was unraced as a two-year-old and never contested a maiden race, beginning her racing career with a win in the Listed Prix Montenica over 1600 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 21 April. She was then stepped up to Group One class for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches at Longchamp Racecourse on 14 May. She turned into the straight in fourth place before taking the lead 200 metres from the finish but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third behind Pearl Bracelet and the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Pass the Peace. The unplaced runners included Tersa (Prix Morny), Oczy Czarnie (Prix de la Salamandre) and Mary Linoa (Prix Marcel Boussac). On 4 June, the filly started 3/5 favourite for the Group Three Prix de Sandringham at Chantilly Racecourse and won by three quarters of a length from Bubbling Danseuse. Seventeen days after her win at Chantilly, Golden Opinion was sent to England to contest the 140th renewal of the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. She was made the 7/2 favourite in a twelve-runners field which included Tessla (Fillies' Mile), Aldbourne (third in the 1000 Guineas) and Comic Talent, the winner of her last five races. Asmussen tracked the leaders and was third on the final turn before making a challenge in the straight. Golden Opinion overtook the outsider Magic Gleam inside the final furlong and won by half a length, with a gap of four lengths back to Guest Artiste in third place. She was the first French-trained winner of the race since Barbaresque in 1960.French winners of Group One races in England In July the filly was dropped in distance as well as being matched against colts and older horses when he returned to England to contest the Group One July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse.
