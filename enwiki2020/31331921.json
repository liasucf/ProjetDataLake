The Stranski-Krastanov growth and the Kossel-Stranski model have been named after him. * Dimitar Ivanov Popov - Ivanov reaction == Technology == * Assen Jordanoff, inventor, engineer, and aviator. == Medicine == * Stamen Grigorov - discovered Lactobacillus bulgaricus, patented bacteria used for the production of yogurt in 1905. The bacterium feeds on lactose to produce lactic acid, which is used to preserve milk. *Ivan Mitev - discovered the sixth heart sound. * Samuel Refetoff - discovered the Refetoff syndrome, resistance to thyrotropin (RTSH) and the inherited defect that affects the metabolism of thyroid hormones through mutations in SECISBP2 gene.SAMUEL REFETOFF, MD, Interview conducted by Michael Chappelle, June 4, 2011 == Pharmacology == * Stamen Grigorov - Dr. Grigorov made a major contribution to the creation of an anti-tuberculosis vaccine. * Dimitar Paskov - created the medicine Nivalin, used for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and various other memory impairments, in particular those of vascular origin. == Astronomy == *Dimitar Sasselov - in 2002 sighted the farthest planet from the Earth discovered until then - OGLE-TR-56b. == Aircraft == Assen Jordanoff, inventor, engineer, and aviator-pioneer. *Assen Jordanoff - Jordaphone - the predecessor of the modern answering machine and tape recorder. Frozen Gasoline System for airplanes. Reverse Thrust device for jet engines. *Simeon Petrov - Captain Simeon Petrov, Bulgarian Air Force, invented the world's first purpose-built air-to-surface bomb in 1912. The innovations included aerodynamically stabilized x-tail and an impact detonator. The majority of aircraft bombs to date follow Petrov's design. The Bulgarian Air Force deployed the original prototype, thus becoming the first military force in the world to conduct tactical airplane bombing in a full-scale war in 1912. == Automotive == * Roumen Antonov - invented a revolutionary continuously variable transmission,Linde, Arvid, 2011, Preston Tucker & Others: Tales of Brilliant Automotive Innovations, Veloce Publishing PLC, Antonov Transmission which was never produced.Mysterie achter Antonov zal nog blijven voortleven. Financieel Dagblad, May 6th, 2013 * Assen Jordanoff - invented the airbag for aircraft pilots that is nowadays used in automobiles. == Literature == Elias Canetti, Nobel laureate in Literature (1981). * Elias Canetti - Nobel laureate in Literature 1981 \"for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power\" == Art == * Early Renaissance - The world famous frescos in the Boyana Church from 1239 AD have been described by Andre Grabar and many scholars, as Early Renaissance or precursors of Renaissance Art well before this period started in Italy. The murals are work of the unknown Boyana Master and his disciples who are believed to have been representatives of the Tarnovo Art School in the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185-1396 AD). The frescos have been compared to the work of Giotto who is generally considered the first in a line of great artists who contributed to the Italian Renaissance. The Boyana Church has been declared by UNESCO a World Heritage site.
