    "text": "\"Vukovi umiru sami\" (Wolves die alone) was the Croatian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005, performed in Croatian by Boris Novkovi\u0107 (with members of Lado). As Croatia was not pre-qualified for the final, the song was performed twentieth in the semi-final, following Switzerland's Vanilla Ninja with \"Cool Vibes\" and preceding Bulgaria's Kaffe with \"Lorraine\". Here, it received 169 points to place 4th in a field of 25 and qualify for the final. In the final, it was performed eighteenth, following Germany's Gracia with \"Run & Hide\" and preceding Greece's Elena Paparizou with \"My Number One\". At the close of voting, it had received 115 points to finish 11th and require Croatia to qualify through the semi-final again. The song is a dramatic \"Balkan Ballad\", with Novkovi\u0107 describing the end of a relationship as he realises that \"This love was a vision, this is not my time\". It is well- remembered for the backing singers' line of \"Dunavom, Dunavom\" (\"Down the Danube, Down the Danube\") immediately prior to the key change. It was succeeded as the Croatian representative at the 2006 Contest by Severina with \"Moja \u0161tikla\". ==References== Category:Eurovision songs of 2005 Category:Eurovision songs of Croatia Category:2005 songs ",
