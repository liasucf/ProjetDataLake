O stranger, put your foot on the land, We all reach out so friendly to you. Come in, come in, come in, You will be our dear relative. And once you did your duty fairly, Then you can approach the Father in the Heaven, Then people praise you and enjoy you, And cradle you in the slumbering grave. To rest, to rest, to rest, So you belong to the [heavenly] homeland. |} == Music == The 25-bar long work in D-flat major is scored for choir. The ' (ardent) first 12 bars, in periods of 4 bars, have to be repeated three times - presumably foreseen for four couplets, of which only one has been retrieved. From bar 13, Und hast du das deine dann redlich getan, the Schubert-like song evolves slower to the end. == References == == Sources == * August G\u00f6llerich, Anton Bruckner.
