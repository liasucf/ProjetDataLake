She was owned and bred by Brian Healy and foaled in 1998. Sumthingaboutmaori was a daughter of Pine Chip, her dam Maori Princess (by Entrepreneur) was out of the famous Maori Miss family. Her usual driver was Gavin Lang, although throughout her career other drivers were used. She was a horse that may not have had the success of other horses in other eras, but due to her racing nature she endeared herself to the harness racing public, which was highlighted in 2006 when she led out the field for the Inter Dominion final at Moonee Valley as highlights of her career were shown on a big screen.
