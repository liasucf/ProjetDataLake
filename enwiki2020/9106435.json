    "text": "The Rome II Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 is a European Union Regulation regarding the conflict of laws on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations. From 11 January 2009, the Rome II Regulation creates a harmonised set of rules within the European Union to govern choice of law in civil and commercial matters (subject to certain exclusions) concerning non-contractual obligations, including specific rules for tort/delict (harm caused by failure to perform a duty) and specific categories of tort/delict,Rome II Regulation, Arts. 4 (general rule), 5 (product liability), 6 (competition), 7 (environmental damage), 8 (IP infringements), 9 (industrial action) unjust enrichment,Rome II Regulation, Art. 10 negotiorum gestioRome II Regulation, Art. 11 (acting as an agent without permission) and culpa in contrahendo (misleading negotiation of a contract).Rome II Regulation, Art. 12 Additionally, in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, the parties may choose the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation.Rome II Regulation, Art. 13 Analogous rules were established for contractual obligations by the Rome Convention of 1980. The Rome Convention has, in turn, been replaced by the Rome I Regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Reg. (EC) No. 593/2008). The regulation applies to all EU member states except Denmark. ==Background== Initially submitted by the Commission in July 2003, an amended text was finally adopted on 11 July 2007 and published in the Official Journal on 31 July 2007. It applies from 11 January 2009. It may apply to obligations arising from events giving rise to damage occurring from 20 August 2007, although the text of the Regulation is unfortunately silent on this point.Rome II Regulation, Arts. 31-32. See http://conflictoflaws.net/2009/rome-ii-regulation-applicable-in-eu/comment- page-1/#comment-191002/ To accommodate concerns earlier raised by the European Parliament at Second Reading stage in January 2007, the commission is mandated to draw up a study by December 2008 on applicable law in defamation and privacy disputes, which have been excluded from the Regulation as a result of the difficulties in agreeing appropriate choice of law rules for these matters. That study has not yet been formally published. This is in addition to their preparing a report within 4 years on the results of practical application of the Regulation, including a specific study of its effects in road traffic accident disputes. ==See also== *Rome I Regulation (Applicable law in contractual obligations) *Rome III Regulation (Applicable law in divorce cases) *Tort (conflict) *Brussels Regime, governing jurisdiction ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * text adopted. * European Commission tracking page on the proposal * Text initially proposed by the European Commission (July 2003) * Text of Common Position adopted by the Council of Ministers (September 2006) * Amendments proposed by the European Parliament at Second Reading (January 2007) * Press Release summarising the European Parliament amendments * Article for the Lawyer magazine, 15 January 2007 by Diana Wallis MEP, rapporteur for the Regulation in the European Parliament. * romeii.eu - Legislative materials and news on the Rome II Regulation Category:2007 in law Category:Conflict of laws Category:European Union regulations Category:2007 in the European Union Category:Law of obligations ",
