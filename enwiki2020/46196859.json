CPHA's objective was to establish professional standards for the field of public health and to advance research in the area. Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn was named as the patron of the new organization, and its first president was T.A. Starkey of McGill University. CPHA received a federal charter in 1912. The organization celebrated its centenary in 2010.
