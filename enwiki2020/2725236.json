    "text": "John McKissick (September 25, 1926 \u2013 November 28, 2019) was a head football coach of Summerville High School in Summerville, South Carolina. In 2012, he became the first American football coach in history (high school, college, or professional) to win 600 career games. His 600th win came against Summerville's Ashley Ridge High School.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/highschool/10/26/summerville- john-mckissick-win-600.ap/index.html Up until 2013, he had never missed a game in 62 years and was the longest serving high school football coach of all time. He led Summerville to 10 state championships. With 621 wins, McKissick holds the record for most wins by a football coach at any level. He graduated from Kingstree Senior High School in Kingstree, South Carolina, then went to Presbyterian College for two years before being drafted into the Army (as a paratrooper). He returned to Presbyterian to graduate with a degree in economics in 1951. He then worked for his father for a while before finally getting the coaching job at Summerville High. He coached all three of his grandsons, Richard and Joe Call, and Donny McElveen. He was elected to the National High School Hall of Fame in 1990. After McKissick's retirement ahead of the 2015 season, grandson Joe who had been his offensive coordinator was named head coach. McKissick was mentioned in Pat Conroy's The Prince of Tides novel in 1986 and the film that was released five years later. In Conroy's novel, South of Broad, McKissick is given dialogue in a fictional game played between Summerville High School and Peninsula High School. ==References== ==External links== * *Summerville High School Athletics Department *NFLHS.COM \u2013 Legends of HS Football: John McKissick *USATODAY.com \u2013 Football coach all alone at brink of 500 wins *2005 High School Football Preview *USATODAY.com \u2013 Winningest football coach at 532 and not about to stop * Category:1926 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from Kingstree, South Carolina Category:People from Summerville, South Carolina Category:Players of American football from South Carolina Category:American football fullbacks Category:Brevard Tornados football players Category:Presbyterian Blue Hose football players Category:Military personnel from South Carolina Category:Coaches of American football from South Carolina Category:High school football coaches in South Carolina ",
