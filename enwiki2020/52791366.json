    "text": "Poverty Made Happy () \u2013 Polish opera (operetta) in 2 acts by Maciej Kamie\u0144ski. Libretto was written by Wojciech Bogus\u0142awski, based on a same-named cantata by Franciszek Bohomolec (1777). Its premiere took place on 11 July 1778 in Radziwi\u0142\u0142 Palace in Warsaw. For two centuries N\u0119dza uszcz\u0119\u015bliwiona was considered the first Polish opera performed in public theatre. In 2005 Jerzy Go\u0142os published an anonymous comic opera (found in a manuscript held in Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144), which he named Heca albo polowanie na zaj\u0105ca. It dates ca.1680. There were also two operas by Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Ogi\u0144ski staged before N\u0119dza uszcz\u0119\u015bliwiona (in S\u0142onim, 1771): Opuszczone dzieci and Filozof zmieniony. == Roles == * Podstaro\u015bci \u2013 baryton * Anna, poor peasant \u2013 soprano * Kasia, her daughter \u2013 soprano * Jan, wealthy burgher \u2013 bass * Antek, farm worker \u2013 tenor The scene is staged in a noble village. == Editions == * Maciej Kamie\u0144ski, Wojciech Bogus\u0142awski.
