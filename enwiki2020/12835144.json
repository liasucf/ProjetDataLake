    "text": "Xiao Wu (), also known as The Pickpocket, is a 1997 Chinese movie directed by Jia Zhangke. The film was the directorial debut of Jia Zhangke, one of the major figures of the so-called Sixth Generation of Chinese cinema and stars Wang Hongwei in the titular role along with Hao Hongjian and Zuo Baitao. Xiao Wu was filmed in the city of Fenyang in 16 mm. ==Synopsis== The film is set in 1997, with the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong being mentioned in the background. The place is a small provincial town, dirty and poor. Xiao Wu is one of a group of pickpockets, most of whom have moved on to become small traders and legal or semi-legal. One of them, formerly a close friend, is getting married and decides not to invite Xiao Wu, a reminder of the past. He drifts around, discontent with this, but makes no effort to change. He acquires a girlfriend, a prostitute who takes a liking to him, but she drops him when she finds someone better. He visits his poor-peasant family but ends up quarrelling with his parents and saying he won't ever come back. Finally he gets arrested and we last see him handcuffed in the middle of the street with a disapproving crowd watching him. There is a big crack-down on crime, something mentioned at the start of the film, so his fate is likely to be harsh. ==Production history== While a student in the mid-1990s, Jia Zhangke remained a relative unknown at China's prestigious Beijing Film Academy. While still in school, Jia directed the short film Xiao Shan Going Home which he was eventually able to screen abroad, winning the top prize at the 1997 Hong Kong Independent Short Film & Video Awards This success brought Jia into contact with cinematographer Yu Lik-wai and producer Li Kit Ming. With their support, Jia was able to begin work on Xiao Wu, which would become his first feature film. Xiao Wu was shot on a mere 400,000 RMB budget (or about $50,000 US). ==Reception== Xiao Wu was praised by the American filmmaker Martin Scorsese, a noted fan of Jia's works. ===Awards and nominations=== *Berlin International Film Festival, Forum section, 1998 ** NETPAC Award ** Wolfgang Staudte Award *Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema, 1999 ** Official selection *Nantes Three Continents Festival, 1998 ** Golden Montgolfiere (Tied with Wand\u00e2furu raifu) *Pusan International Film Festival, 1998 ** New Currents Award *San Francisco International Film Festival, 1999 ** SKYY Prize *Vancouver International Film Festival 1998 ** Dragons and Tigers Award ==Notes== ==External links== * * *Xiao Wu at the Chinese Movie Database * Category:1997 films Category:1998 films Category:1997 drama films Category:Chinese films Category:Chinese independent films Category:Films directed by Jia Zhangke Category:Films set in 1997 Category:Films set in China Category:Films set in Shanxi Category:Mandarin-language films Category:1998 directorial debut films Category:1997 directorial debut films Category:1998 drama films ",
