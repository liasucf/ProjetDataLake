    "text": "Khronos is the sixth full-length album by Greek extreme metal band Rotting Christ. Following Sleep of the Angels, this record continues to show the band's experimentation with doom and gothic metal musical elements, but also a return to their more extreme earlier years as well. Some traces of industrial music can also be heard, particularly in the band's cover of Current 93's \"Lucifer Over London\", but also on other tracks as \"Glory of Sadness\". It was produced by Peter T\u00e4gtgren's (Hypocrisy) Abyss Studios, whose previous credits also include releases by Dimmu Borgir and Immortal. ==Track listing== All songs written by Sakis Tolis, except where noted. #\"Thou Art Blind\" \u2013 2:47 #\"If It Ends Tomorrow\" \u2013 4:28 #\"My Sacred Path\" \u2013 5:38 #\"Aeternatus\" \u2013 3:14 #\"Art of Sin\" \u2013 5:18 #\"Lucifer Over London\" (David Tibet) \u2013 5:15 #\"Law of the Serpent\" \u2013 2:08 #\"You Are I\" \u2013 3:27 #\"Khronos\" \u2013 6:37 #\"Fateless\" \u2013 4:10 #\"Time Stands Still\" \u2013 5:04 #\"Glory of Sadness\" \u2013 11:32 #\"Phobia [Brazil Edition]\" \u2013 5:34 ==Credits== *Sakis Tolis \u2013 guitar, vocals *Kostas Vassilakopoulos \u2013 guitar *Andreas Lagios \u2013 bass *Georgios Tolias \u2013 keyboards *Themis Tolis \u2013 drums ==References== Category:2000 albums Category:Rotting Christ albums Category:Albums produced by Peter T\u00e4gtgren Category:Century Media Records albums ",
