    "text": "\"Samba de uma Nota S\u00f3\" (\"One-Note Samba\") is a bossa nova and jazz standard song composed by Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim with Portuguese lyrics by Newton Mendon\u00e7a. The English lyrics were written by Jon Hendricks. It was first recorded by Jo\u00e3o Gilberto in 1960 for his album O Amor, o Sorriso e a Flor. The song title refers to the main melody line, which at first consists of a long series of notes of a single tone (typically D, as played in the key of G) played over a descending chord progression in a bossa nova rhythm. The first eight measures consist of D, followed by four measures of G, and then four measures of D. This is followed by eight measures of a more conventional, scalar melody line. This well-known song first reached a wide audience on the Grammy-winning bossa nova LP Jazz Samba (Getz/Byrd/Betts),1963 Grammy Awards which reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 in 1963.Jazz Samba#Chart positions Another well-known release is the Sergio Mendes-Brasil '66 version, in medley with \"Spanish Flea\". The song was featured in a prominent scene of \"A Man Without a Skin\", a 1963 episode of Naked City. The song was mentioned in the song \"Astrud\" by Basia.
