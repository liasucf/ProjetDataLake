It was founded by Edmonton pioneer Frank Oliver, a future Liberal politician and cabinet minister in the Canadian Government. Oliver co-founded the paper with Alex Taylor, the city's first telegraph operator, in 1880. It was Edmonton's undisputed foremost newspaper until the Edmonton Journal was founded in 1903. The Journal took an editorial stance friendly to the Conservative Party, in contrast to the Bulletin which was the Liberal Oliver's mouthpiece. The Bulletin folded on January 20, 1951. ==References== *History of the Edmonton Journal *Real Estate Weekly biography of Frank Oliver Category:Defunct newspapers published in Alberta Category:History of Edmonton Category:Publications established in 1880 Category:Publications disestablished in 1951 Category:Daily newspapers published in Alberta Category:Newspapers published in Edmonton ",
