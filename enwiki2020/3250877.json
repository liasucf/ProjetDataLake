    "text": "La mujer de mi hermano (\"My brother's wife\", literally, \"The woman of my brother\") is a 2005 Peruvian film directed by Ricardo de Montreuil, based on the novel of the same name by the Peruvian writer, journalist and TV host Jaime Bayly. It starred B\u00e1rbara Mori, Manolo Cardona, Christian Meier, and Ang\u00e9lica Arag\u00f3n. Its soundtrack was given by Pakistani singer Atif Aslam. ==Plot== ===Structure=== La Mujer De Mi Hermano ( \"My Brother's Wife\") could be considered in a category of films that critic Alissa Quart calls 'hyperlink movies', in which multiple stories take place, each affecting the other in ways that characters are unaware of, all the while using radically different aesthetic and cinematic techniques to define the mise en sc\u00e8ne of each storyline. ==Synopsis== Zoe (B\u00e1rbara Mori) is a beautiful woman who has been married to Ignacio (Christian Meier) for nearly a decade. While Zoe still loves her husband, she feels the spark has gone out of their relationship, and she's become restless and anxious. Hoping to find the excitement she craves in forbidden fruit, Zoe falls into an affair with Gonzalo (Manolo Cardona), Ignacio\u2019s rough-edged but handsome brother. During their encounters, she complains to Gonzalo that Ignacio seems uninterested in her sexually as he only makes love to her on Saturdays and rejects her advances regularly. Reciprocating her negative thoughts of Ignacio, Gonzalo accuses him of being jealous as he has gone on to work in his passion of painting. On the other hand, Ignacio is running the family business and blatantly states that Gonzalo is a good-for-nothing and a moocher as he doesn\u2019t work and simply collects his monthly stipend. Ignacio further deems Gonzalo\u2019s painting a waste of time. Zoe confides in and seeks advice about the affair from her best friend, Boris (Bruno Bichir). One night after sex, Gonzalo comments that he suspects Ignacio of being gay. Zoe again seeks council from Boris, who states he can confirm her suspicions about Ignacio\u2019s sexuality due to his lack of sexual interest in her. Zoe and Gonzalo's passionate affair is satisfying to them both, but the adulterous couple must deal with the sharp sting of betrayal when Ignacio finds out they've been sleeping together. However, the story takes a big turn when it is revealed the affair has only been a revenge towards his brother for Gonzalo. He confronts Ignacio admitting he remembers being raped by him when he was younger, therefore, Gonzalo is set on destroying his life. To further complicate the love triangle, Zoe becomes pregnant with Gonzalo\u2019s child, which he adamantly denies is his and demands Zoe abort. Zoe leaves Ignacio a Dear John letter and leaves their house. Ignacio writes a letter in return, stating that he still loves her and is willing to forgive her affair with Gonzalo. Ignacio meets Zoe at her hotel and declares that while he deeply loves her, he is sexually attracted to men. Zoe agrees to stay married to Ignacio and he agrees to raise the baby his own on the condition that Zoe allow him male lovers at his discretion. Zoe agrees to the terms and Ignacio sends Gonzalo an email in which Gonzalo is led to believe that Ignacio remained oblivious of the affair and that the baby is his. The film closes with Ignacio and Gonzalo\u2019s mother telling Ignacio how much the baby looks like him. ==Cast== * B\u00e1rbara Mori as Zoe * Manolo Cardona as Gonzalo * Christian Meier as Ignacio * Bruno Bichir as Boris * Gaby Espino as Laura * Ang\u00e9lica Arag\u00f3n as Cristina * Beto Cuevas as Padre Santiago * David Leche Ruiz as Jorge ==Adaptation== For this film, director Ricardo de Montreuil and novelist Bayly intended to take the story in a separate and somewhat different direction than the novel. \"When Mar\u00eda Eugenia Argomedo and I began collaborating on the script, we were hoping to make something new out of the material, rather than simply reproducing the book onto film,\" said Montreuil on an IFC interview. ==Reviews== The film received mixed reviews from critics.
