It also urged ABC affiliates not to broadcast the program and citizens to boycott sponsors of Blue. About a quarter of the 225 existing ABC stations followed suit, but such affiliates were mostly in rural areas of the US. The AFA campaign increased hype for the show in larger American media markets, and Blue became one of the most popular shows of the 1993\u20131994 television season. In 1996, the AFA launched a boycott against Walt Disney Company when the company began giving benefits to same-sex employees in domestic partnerships.

It uses these websites to organize boycotts and urge activists to send emails to mainstream companies employing advertising, selling products, or advertising on television shows they find offensive. In 2012, the group started and then backed off from a failed campaign against the hiring of talk show host Ellen DeGeneres as a spokesperson for department store chain J. C. Penney.

The American Family Association supplied several 11-by-14-inch posters to school systems and vowed to defend any legal challenges to the displaying of the posters. == Criticism and controversy == In 2015, the organisation officially repudiated views of former director of issues analysis Bryan Fischer, including the claim that black people \"rut like rabbits\"; that the First Amendment applies only to Christians; that Hispanics are \"socialists by nature\" and come to the U.S. to \"plunder\" the country; that Hillary Clinton is a lesbian, and that \"Homosexuality gave us Adolf Hitler, and homosexuals in the military gave us the Brown Shirts, the Nazi war machine and six million dead Jews.\" ===Religious exercise=== Sandy Rios, the Family Association's director of governmental affairs, has criticised \"powerful Jewish forces behind the ACLU\" and stated that secular Jews often \"turn out to be the worst enemies of the country\" while the AFA's president Tim Wildmon stated \"Most of the Jews in this country, unfortunately, are far-left.\" Bryan Fischer, former director of issues analysis, has described Muslims as \"Parasites Who Must Convert or Die\" and stated that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects only the religious practice of Christianity, writing in a blog post \"The real object of the amendment was, not to countenance, much less to advance Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity; but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects... So the purpose of the First Amendment was most decidedly NOT to \"approve, support, (or) accept\" any \"religion\" other than Christianity.\" Fischer has suggested Jews and Muslims are not included in religious freedom protections in the US, saying: \"I have contended for years that the First Amendment, as given by the Founders, provides religious liberty protections for Christianity only.\" He later wrote: \"We are a Christian nation and not a Jewish or Muslim one.\" In a 2015 press release denouncing Fischer's views, the AFA stated \"AFA rejects the idea expressed by Bryan Fischer that \"Free exercise of religion\" only applies to Christians. Consequently, AFA rejects Bryan's assertions that Muslims should not be granted permits to build mosques in the United States.\" === Stance on homosexuality === The AFA has been criticized by a number of organizations for their stance against gay rights.\"Letter from GLAAD in SF Bay Times.\" San Francisco Bay Times.

In late 2012, the AFA called the project \u2013 begun 11 years earlier and held in more than 2,500 schools \u2013 \"a nationwide push to promote the homosexual lifestyle in public schools\", urging parents to keep their children home from school on October 30, 2012, and to call the schools to protest the event. \"I was surprised that they completely lied about what Mix It Up Day is\", Maureen Costello, the director of the center's Teaching Tolerance project, which organizes the program, told The New York Times. \"It was a cynical, fear-mongering tactic.\" In October, Bryan Fischer was taken off air during a CNN interview with Carol Costello for repeating his belief that \"Hitler recruited homosexuals around him to make up his Stormtroopers.\" In 2012, as jury selection was to begin in a trial on charges of kidnapping of a lesbian couple's daughter, Fischer wrote on Twitter in support of kidnapping of children from same-sex households and smuggling them to what he calls \"normal\" homes.Edwards, David (August 8, 2012). \"Fischer calls for 'Underground Railroad\u2019 to kidnap children of LGBT parents\".

In January 2013, Fischer compared the Boy Scouts of America's change in views on gay scouts and scoutmasters to Jerry Sandusky, saying allowing gay scoutmasters was inviting pedophiles into the tents of children. In March 2013, Fischer compared homosexuality to bank robbery when Senator Portman announced his views on same-sex marriage had changed due to having a gay son. Fischer also stated that homosexuality should be banned like trans fats for being \"a hazard to human health\" and likened homosexuals to thieves, murderers and child molesters. On January 28, 2015, Tim Wildmon, president of the American Family Association, demoted Fischer from being a spokesperson. Fischer went on to state that he will still be hosting the AFA's American Family Talk radio. In order to avoid being categorised as a hate group by Israel, the AFA issued a press release denouncing some of Fischer's views, rejecting his claim that Hillary Clinton is a lesbian, and stating: \"AFA rejects the statement by Bryan Fischer that, 'Homosexuality gave us Adolf Hitler, and homosexuals in the military gave us the Brown Shirts, the Nazi war machine and six million dead Jews.' AFA rejects the policy advocated by Bryan Fischer that homosexual conduct should be illegal. AFA rejects the notion advocated by Bryan Fischer that, 'We need an underground railroad to protect innocent children from same-sex households.'\" ====Criticism of homosexuality==== In 1998, the Internet filtering software CyberPatrol blocked the AFA's web site, classifying it under the category \"intolerance\", defined as \"pictures or text advocating prejudice or discrimination against any race, color, national origin, religion, disability or handicap, gender or sexual orientation...\" AFA spokesman Steve Ensley told reporters, \"Basically we're being blocked for free speech.\" CyberPatrol cited quotes from the AFA for meeting its intolerance criteria, which included: \"Indifference or neutrality toward the homosexual rights movement will result in society's destruction by allowing civil order to be redefined and by plummeting ourselves, our children, and grandchildren into an age of godlessness\"; \"A national 'Coming Out of Homosexuality' provides us a means whereby to dispel the lies of the homosexual rights crowd who say they are born that way and cannot change\"; and \"We want to outlaw public homosexuality...We believe homosexuality is immoral and leads ultimately to personal and social decay.\" On October 19, 1998, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, led by Leslie Katz, wrote a letter to the AFA in response to an advertisement placed in the San Francisco Chronicle by the AFA regarding homosexuality and Christianity. The letter stated: > Supervisor Leslie Katz denounces your rhetoric against gays, lesbians and > transgendered people. What happened to Matthew Shepard is in part due to the > message being espoused by your groups that gays and lesbians are not worthy > of the most basic equal rights and treatment. It is not an exaggeration to > say that there is a direct correlation between these acts of discrimination, > such as when gays and lesbians are called sinful and when major religious > organizations say they can change if they tried, and the horrible crimes > committed against gays and lesbians. During the same time, the City and County of San Francisco passed two resolutions. Resolution No. 234-99 \"calls for the Religious Right to take accountability for the impact of their long-standing rhetoric denouncing gays and lesbians, which leads to a climate of mistrust and discrimination that can open the door to horrible crimes such as those committed against Mr. Gaither\"On February 19, 1999, in Coosa County, Alabama, Billy Jack Gaither was beaten to death with an axe handle and his body was burned because he was homosexual. and Resolution No. 873-98 was specifically directed at \"anti-gay\" television advertisements. AFA unsuccessfully challenged these actions as violating the Free Speech and Free Exercise clauses of the First Amendment in American Family Association v. City and County of San Francisco. In 1998, multiple organizations voiced criticism of a series of AFA-sponsored full-page newspaper advertisements that promoted religious ministries involved in the ex-gay movement. In response to the advertisements, the Religious Leadership Roundtable said the ads employed \"language of violence and hatred to denounce other people\". IntegrityUSA criticized the ads, calling them \"evil\" disregarding Christian teachings about the \"dignity of every human being\". DignityUSA also criticized the advertisements, which they said were \"misleading and destructive\".Tooley, Mark. \"Homosexual Radicals Demonize Religious Beliefs of Opponents\". The Washington Times (August 1, 1998). Vol. 14 No. 13 Pg. 30 . In July 2000, the AFA sent out emails and letters calling for openly gay Arizona Republican United States House of Representatives member Jim Kolbe to be barred from speaking at the Republican National Convention. The AFA also said that Kolbe should be arrested when he returned to his home state, as because Kolbe is gay, he was violating an Arizona law that banned sodomy. Equality Mississippi, a statewide LGBT civil rights organization which has voiced opposition and criticism towards the AFA's activism regarding homosexuality, felt that AFA's action was constituting and encouraging violence towards the gay community. In 2005, Equality Mississippi publicly spoke out against the AFA for the use of copyrighted images on the AFA web site in its boycott against Kraft Foods for being a sponsor of the 2006 Gay Games in Chicago. The photographs, which were used without permission, were owned by and retrieved from ChrisGeary.com. Equality Mississippi encouraged ChrisGeary.com to file suit against the AFA and offered to support the suit. , the images were still on AFA's web site.AFA.net: The following photos were taken at the last Gay Games events and are shown here for the sole purpose of educating Kraft customers to the types of activities Kraft is supporting. In June 2008, AFA's news website, OneNewsNow \u2013 which had begun replacing all instances of \"gay\" with \"homosexual\" in re-posted Associated Press articles \u2013 changed an AP profile of Olympic sprinter Tyson Gay, rendering his name as \"Tyson Homosexual\". OneNewsNow similarly altered the name of basketball player Rudy Gay, naming him \"Rudy Homosexual\". The gay rights website GoodAsYou.org, which \"has long chronicled the AFA's practice of changing AP copy to suit its conservative agenda\", spotted the errors. Tyson Gay was upset with the mistake. === Intellectual freedom === Individuals in the media industry have criticized Donald Wildmon, the founder of AFA. Gene Mater, senior vice president of CBS Television, has stated, \"We look upon Wildmon's efforts as the greatest frontal assault on intellectual freedom this country has ever faced\" and Brandon Tartikoff, then NBC Entertainment President, stated that Wildmon's boycott campaign was \"the first step toward a police state.\"About Don Wildmon. American Family Association. Retrieved on June 16, 2007. () === Marilyn Manson === Paul Cambria, lawyer for rock band Marilyn Manson, sent a cease and desist letter to AFA on April 25, 1997, in response to allegations published in the AFA Journal that Manson encouraged audience members to engage in sexual and violent acts in its concerts. AFA Journal relied on testimony by two anonymous claimed teenage concertgoers. The allegations were independently proven to be false. Wildmon responded that his organization as a whole was not responsible, but rather the AFA's Gulf Coast chapter in Biloxi, Mississippi. ===Hate group listing=== The Southern Poverty Law Center, in a 2005 report, stated that the AFA, along with other groups, engaged in hate speech to \"help drive the religious right's anti-gay crusade.\" Mark Potok of the SPLC determined that the turning point was 2003's Lawrence v. Texas, in which the Supreme Court struck down Texas's anti-sodomy laws. After that, the Christian right spent millions on advertisements, and on pastor briefings organized by activists such as \"born-again\" Christian David Lane. Lane helped AFA put constitutional opposite-sex marriage amendments on the ballots of 13 states. In November 2010, the SPLC changed their listing of AFA from a group that used hate speech to the more serious one of being designated a hate group. Potok said that the AFA's \"propagation of known falsehoods and demonizing propaganda\" was the basis for the change. The AFA was greatly displeased with the designation as a hate group, calling the list \"slanderous\". In response to the SPLC's announcement, some members of the Christian right \"called on Congress to cut off their funding.\" J. Matt Barber of The Washington Times said that the SPLC was \"marginalizing\" themselves by giving the AFA the same hate group designation shared by the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis. Tony Perkins, the president of Family Research Council (FRC) \u2013 an organization also named a hate group \u2013 asked the SPLC to strike the new designation, but they held their position. Ken Williams commented that in reaction, the FRC and the AFA joined with other \"pro-family\" organizations targeted by the SPLC to establish a new website, an online petition called \"Start Debating/Stop Hating\" to counter the SPLC, and they took out full page ads in two Washington D.C. newspapers, defending their work \"to protect and promote natural marriage and the family.\" The advertisement stated the \"undersigned stand in solidarity\" with the organizations designated as hate groups, and that they \"support the vigorous but responsible exercise of the First Amendment rights of free speech and religious liberty that are the birthright of all Americans.\" House Speaker\u2013Designate John Boehner and the governors of Louisiana, Minnesota and Virginia were among those signing the statement. The SPLC addressed the new website statement; Potok was quoted by David Weigel of Slate magazine as saying, \"the SPLC's listings of these groups is based on their propagation of known falsehoods \u2013 claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities \u2013 and repeated, groundless name-calling.\" Mark Potok is quoted as saying, \"the SPLC's listings of these groups is based on their propagation of known falsehoods \u2013 claims about LGBT people that have been thoroughly discredited by scientific authorities \u2013 and repeated, groundless name-calling.\" The American Independent News Network (AINN) noted that the AFA had recently denounced Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan as a lesbian unfit for office \u2013 AINN stated that \"she's not\" a lesbian \u2013 and that Fischer said Hitler's savage and brutal methods were only possible because he and most of his stormtroopers were gay. Jillian Rayfield of Talking Points Memo noted the irony in the website calling the SPLC a \"radical Left\" group \"spreading hateful rhetoric\" yet elsewhere declaring that the debates of the Christian right \"can and must remain civil \u2013 but they must never be suppressed through personal assaults that aim only to malign an opponent's character.\" == See also == * Abiding Truth Ministries * Christian fundamentalism * Christian right * Culture War * List of organizations designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as anti-gay hate groups * New Right * Radical right (United States) * Religion and homosexuality ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * American Family Association official site *American Family Association Collection (MUM00008) owned by the University of Mississippi, Archives and Special Collections.
