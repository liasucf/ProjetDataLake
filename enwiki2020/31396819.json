Her Taranaki Iwi names are Ng\u0101ti Mutunga and Ng\u0101ti Tama. She has three siblings; Todd, Brooke and Sally. In 1986 she enrolled at Victoria University and graduated with a BA in English. She graduated from New Zealand acting school Toi Whakaari in 1990. Wolfe married fellow actor Tim Balme in 1994, and together they have two children; daughter Edie (b. 2001) and son Nikau (b. 2006). Wolfe also has a step-son, Sam (b. 1987). == Career == Her first professional acting job was at Dunedin's Fortune Theatre, followed by several episodes of NHNZ's children's nature series Wild Track, as the presenter. Her first television role was as Ginny Gannaway on the series Marlin Bay, a role which lasted three years, and her big screen debut was in The Last Tattoo, in which she played the missing girlfriend of a World War II GI. Recently Wolfe has moved into directing. Her first 2 short films \"This is Her\" and \"Redemption\" both premiered at Sundance, and went on to screen in Berlinale, New York and Telluride. Her first feature-length film, titled Kawa, was an adaptation of Witi Ihimaera's book, Nights in the Gardens of Spain. Wolfe joined seven other M\u0101ori women to direct the omnibus film, Waru (2017). Each woman contributed a 10-minute segment of events circling around the tangi of a boy named Waru. After its debut at the 2017 NZ International Film Festival, Waru earned significant social media attention, and screened at the Toronto and ImagineNATIVE festivals. == Filmography - screen credits == ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
