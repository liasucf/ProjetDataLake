    "text": "Atanasije I () was the Archbishop of Pe\u0107 and Serbian Patriarch, head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, from 1711 until 1712. Before he became Serbian Patriarch, Atanasije served as Metropolitan of Skopje, from 1706, under Serbian Patriarch Kalinik I. That was a very prominent position, so when old patriarch died in 1710, Atanasije was elected as his successor in 1711. His seat was in the Patriarchal Monastery of Pe\u0107. As new Serbian Patriarch, he strengthened ties with newly created Metropolitanate of Kru\u0161edol, an autonomous ecclesiastical province of Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 in Habsburg Monarchy. His rule was not long, since he died on April 23, 1712. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * ==External links== * Official site of the Serbian Orthodox Church: Serbian Archbishops and Patriarchs Atanasije I Category:Serbian Orthodox metropolitans of Skopje Category:Eastern Orthodox Christians from Serbia Category:18th-century Eastern Orthodox archbishops Category:18th-century Serbian people Category:Serbs of the Ottoman Empire ",
