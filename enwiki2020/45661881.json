To declare it a great book would be to burden it with an ambition it has lightly rejected, but it is the sort of elegant diversion we can enjoy and esteem. It is a hilarious account of political and romantic intrigue in Venice.Fun in Venice Retrieved 2015-03-13. and Kirkus Reviews concludes \"Occasionally hilarious, sometimes poignant (with Robert's mum back in England), but more often merely the ultimate in offbeat charm \u2014 a polished yet subdued Spark-ler from a one- of-a-kind talent.\"TERRITORIAL RIGHTS by Muriel Spark | Kirkus Retrieved 2015-03-13. However other reviews were scathing, with Edith Milton in the New York Magazine complaining that Spark's characters were \"so completely passionless that that one does not for one minute suppose that their sexual and temperamental gyrations could be caused by anything deeper than the demand of the narrative. And those are horrendously complicated, though the plot is not intended to convince...Spark works on this dark landscape with the fever of farce, desperate to keep her plot and characters going...Experimenting with the disease of pettiness, the novel itself finally comes down with a fatal case\".New York Magazine 28 May 1979, pages 82 & 84 Retrieved 2015-03-15. ==Publication history== *1979, UK, Macmillan, , Pub date 1979, Hardback *1979, US, Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, , Pub date May 1979, Hardback *1980, UK, Panther, , Pub date Jan 1980, Paperback *1984, US, Perigee, , Pub date Feb 1984, Paperback *1985, US, G K Hall, , Pub date Jun 1985, Audio cassette *1991, UK, Penguin, , Pub date Oct 1991, Paperback *1995, US, Chivers, , Pub date Aug 1995, Audio cassette, read by Nigel Hawthorne *2014, UK, Virago, , Pub date Mar 2014, Paperback *2014, US, New Directions, , Pub date May 2014, Paperback www.fantasticfiction.co.uk Retrieved 2015-03-16. == References == Category:1979 British novels Category:Novels by Muriel Spark Category:Novels set in Venice Category:Macmillan Publishers books ",
