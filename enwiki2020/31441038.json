On 6 March 2016, he scored his first goal with the club in a 2\u20130 home win against Atromitos. On 28 October 2017, thanks to a close-range effort by the Argentinian attacking midfielder, Panathinaikos won 1\u20130 at Super League derby clash against champions Olympiacos.

After three days of negotiations, Panathinaikos agreed with Alanyaspor for a total transfer amount of \u20ac1.2 million.
