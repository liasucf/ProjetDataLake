    "text": "William Peckover was a gunner in the Royal Navy and served on several vessels most notably commanded by James Cook and William Bligh. He was born 17 June 1748, son of Daniel Peckover and Mary Aviesin, in Chelwell Valley, Northamptonshire. == Early navy career == Peckover joined Captain Cook's Endeavour expedition aged 21, on 25 July 1768 as an Able-bodied seaman. On the return to Britain, he petitioned Joseph Banks requesting to gain him a berth as a midshipman on Cook's next voyage. He was unsuccessful and was appointed on 4 February 1772 as gunner's mate. On Cook's third and final voyage (on the Discovery), which he joined on 16 February 1776, Peckover was appointed ships gunner. == Bounty voyage == By the time Peckover was a crewmember on the HMAV Bounty he was one of the most experienced on the vessel. He sailed on all three of Captain James Cook's pacific expeditions, had already visited Tahiti four times and was fluent in the Polynesian language. Bounty landed at Tahiti October 1788, where Bligh had Peckover supervise trading negotiations with the islanders while breadfruit plants were collected for transportation. == During the mutiny and subsequent events == On April 28, 1789, during the return voyage to England, Peckover had been on watch duty from midnight to 4:00 am and was still asleep when Fletcher Christian seized control of the ship. Peckover was confined to his cabin during the mutiny, and not allowed up on deck until Bligh and his loyalists were being cast off the ship into the 23-foot launch. Peckover survived the 3,500 nautical mile voyage in Bounty's launch to the Dutch East Indies port of Coupang on Timor and later during the mutineer's court martial in Britain, testified in favour of Midshipman Peter Heywood. In July 1792, Commodore Pasley, (Peter Heywood's uncle) planned to contact Peckover, who at the time was living in Woolwich. According to a footnote to the \"Report of the Court Martial of Ten of the Mutineers\", in May 1794, he was living at No. 13 Gun Alley, in Wapping, London. == Later navy career == Peckover served on various ships during Britain's involvement in the American Revolution and Napoleonic Wars. Royal Navy records state Peckover served as a gunner on the following vessels: * 30 Oct 1780 - HMS Dictator * 15 Jul 1782 - HMS Resistance * 11 Jun 1784 - HMS Recovery * 16 Dec 1784 - HMS Warspite * 27 Jan 1785 - HMS Amphitrite * 24 Aug 1787 - HMAV Bounty * 01 Dec 1790 - HMS Antelope * 06 Jun 1791 - HMS Sultan * 23 Jan 1792 - HMS Antelope * 06 Feb 1792 - HMS Ocean * 23 May 1798 - HMS Bedford * 30 Aug 1798 - HMS Irresistible * 14 May 1801 - HMS Gelykheid Peckover applied for a position as gunner on HMS Providence (the second breadfruit expedition to Tahiti) but was refused by Bligh. In a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, July 17, 1791 (two weeks before departure), Bligh wrote: \u2018\u2018Should Peckover my late Gunner ever trouble you to render him further services I shall esteem it a favour if you will tell him I informed you he was a vicious and worthless fellow \u2013 He applied to me to render him service & wanted to be appointed Gunner of the Providence but as I had determined never to suffer an officer who was with me in the Bounty to sail with again, it was for the cause I did not apply for him.\u2019\u2019 Bligh\u2019s refusal to appoint Peckover was partly due to Edward Christian\u2019s polemic testimony against Bligh in an effort to clear his brother\u2019s name. Christian states in his appendix: \"In the evidence of Mr. Peckover and Mr. Fryer, it is proved that Mr. Nelson the botanist said, upon hearing the commencement of the mutiny, \"We know whose fault this is, or who is to blame, Mr. Fryer, what have we brought upon ourselves?\" In addition to this, it ought to be known that Mr. Nelson, in conversation afterwards with an officer (Peckover) at Timor, who was speaking of returning with Captain Bligh if he got another ship, observed, \"I am surprized that you should think of going a second time with (Bligh), (using a term of abuse), who has been the cause of all our losses.\" The last known record of Peckover mentions him serving on the HMS Gelykheid in 1801,and is not mentioned any further in navy records. Peckover died 16 May 1819, aged 71 and resting place is at the Holy Trinity church, Colchester, Essex. == References == == External links == * A Voyage to the South Seas (William Bligh) Project Gutenberg * Bounty crew list (Pacific Island Study Center) * The Mutiny on the Bounty (Fateful Voyage) * Testimony of William Peckover at Mutineers trial Category:Crew of HMS Bounty Category:18th-century Royal Navy personnel ",
