The area was dedicated to hawkers before the Second World War, but underwent a renaissance in the mid-1980s. It is now a popular expatriate haunt in Hong Kong for drinking, clubbing and dining. The street Lan Kwai Fong is L-shaped with two ends joining with D'Aguilar Street. ==Location== Lan Kwai Fong as an area is defined by D'Aguilar Street and the smaller lane, Lan Kwai Fong, an L-shaped, cobble-stoned lane. Both streets turn 90 degrees to form a rectangle. It is near the Mid-Levels. Its eating and drinking establishments are considered upmarket in price and the area is also considered a tourist spot. From the west side of the rectangle, Wo On Lane and Wing Wah Lane extend to host several more spots for drinks and food. The area arguably extends to Wellington Street and Wyndham Street, through to the Hong Kong Fringe Club. It is also home to a small number of art galleries. ==History== Before the Second World War, Lan Kwai Fong was dedicated to hawkers. In early days, the square housed many mui yan (\u5a92\u4eba), or marriage arrangers, a role exclusively held by females. Mui yan were marriage intermediaries between two families in traditional times. It was thus known as Mui Yan Hong or Hung Leung Hong. Between 2011 and 2015, a massive change was underway, following Zeman's decision to replace his block in Lan Kwai Fong. This led to a substantial area of Lan Kwai Fong becoming a construction site. ==Special occasions== The crowds during special occasions such as Halloween or New Year's Eve put the place at a literal standstill with the large numbers. Police control is employed at such times, to manage the crowds.\u862d\u6842\u574a\uff1a\u5eff\u56db\u5473\u8207\u5564\u9152\u5171\u5b58 ==Street culture== In recent years, street performing has become a new scene in Hong Kong's street culture. Some of the performers decide to set their stages at Lai Kwai Fong, usually with the medium of singing and playing guitar in an acoustic setting. ==Stampede== Stampede location On 1 January 1993, 21 people were killed and 62 injured in a large-scale human stampede whilst celebrating the New Year's Day in Lan Kwai Fong. More than 15,000 people were crammed into the area for the New Year countdown at the time.King of the hill looks to Hollywood's heights SCMP, 27 Mar 2006 The Hong Kong government appointed then-Court of First Instance judge Kemal Bokhary to conduct an inquest into the disaster.
