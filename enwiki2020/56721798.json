    "text": "\"Pop Singer\" is a song by American singer-songwriter John Mellencamp (then under the stage name \"John Cougar Mellencamp\"), released on April 29, 1989, from Mellencamp's tenth studio album Big Daddy. Mellencamp wrote the song himself, in response to how the music industry was attempting to hide his \"real\" image, which included adopting one of his previous stage names, Johnny Cougar. The single was moderately successful worldwide, reaching number one in Canada and New Zealand, number eight in Australia, and number 15 on the US Billboard Hot 100. ==Background== In a 1987 interview with Creem, Mellencamp said, \"The most crucial thing for me is that I want it to be real.\" Referring to his false image in his early years as a musician, Mellencamp was upset with the choices his manager made, including performing under the stage name \"Johnny Cougar\". Mellencamp wanted to focus solely on his music and not his image, so he began to exert more control over his musical career. As a result, he avoided common practices that musicians undertake, including meet-and- greets and radio station concerts. Many fans appreciated this change of style, particularly the devotion he had to his work. Mellencamp wrote \"Pop Singer\" in the midst of a divorce with Victoria Granucci, at which point he began to analyze what he had become as a musician, referring to his image as a \"monster\" in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine. He also claimed, \"Things were changing. Everybody was having to kiss everybody's ass. If you want to be on MTV, then come here and do this. All these backroom deals were getting made. I was like, 'I don't want any part of this.'\" ==Track listings== 7\" Single #\"Pop Singer\" \u2013 2:45 #\"J.M.'s Question\" \u2013 3:38 Europe 12\" Single Side A #\"Pop Singer\" \u2013 2:45 Side B #\"J.M.'s Question\" \u2013 3:38 #\"Like a Rolling Stone\" (Live) \u2013 6:27 Europe Maxi/CD Single #\"Pop Singer\" \u2013 2:45 #\"J.M.'s Question\" \u2013 3:38 #\"Like a Rolling Stone\" (Live) \u2013 6:27 #\"Check It Out\" (Live) \u2013 4:45 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1989) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1989) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM) |align=\"center\"|27 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |align=\"center\"|37 |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1989 songs Category:1989 singles Category:John Mellencamp songs Category:Mercury Records singles Category:Number-one singles in New Zealand Category:Songs written by John Mellencamp Category:RPM Top Singles number-one singles ",
