    "text": "QWERTY, one of the few native English words with Q not followed by U, is derived from the first six letters of a standard keyboard layout. A souq in Marrakech, Morocco. Like 32 of the 72 other English words that use a q not followed by a u, souq is of Arabic origin. In English, the letter Q is usually followed by the letter U, but there are some exceptions. The majority of these are anglicised from Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Inuktitut, or other languages that do not use the English alphabet, with Q representing a sound not found in English. For example, in the Chinese pinyin alphabet, qi is pronounced (similar to \"chi\" in English) by an English speaker, as pinyin uses \"q\" to represent the sound , which is approximated as (ch) in English. In other examples, Q represents in standard Arabic, such as in qat, faqir and Qur'\u0101n. In Arabic, the letter \u0642, traditionally romanised as Q, is quite distinct from \u0643, traditionally romanised as K; for example, means \"heart\" but means \"dog\". However, alternative spellings are sometimes accepted, which use K (or sometimes C) in place of Q; for example, Koran (Qur'\u0101n) and Cairo (al-Q\u0101hira). Of the 72 words in this list, 68 are nouns, and most would generally be considered loanwords; the only modern-English words that contain Q not followed by U and are not borrowed from another language are freq, qiana, QWERTY, and tranq. However, all of the loanwords on this list are considered to be naturalised in English according to at least one major dictionary (see References), often because they refer to concepts or societal roles that do not have an accurate equivalent in English. For words to appear here, they must appear in their own entry in a dictionary; words that occur only as part of a longer phrase are not included. Proper nouns are not included in the list. There are, in addition, many place names and personal names, mostly originating from Arabic-speaking countries, Albania, or China, that have a Q without a U. The most familiar of these are the countries of Iraq and Qatar, along with the derived words Iraqi and Qatari. Iqaluit, the capital of the Canadian territory of Nunavut, also has a Q that is not directly followed by a U. Qaqortoq, in Greenland, is notable for having three such Qs. Other proper names and acronyms that have attained the status of English words include: Compaq (a computer company), Nasdaq (a US electronic stock market), Qantas (an Australian airline), and QinetiQ (a British technology company). Saqqara (an ancient burial ground in Egypt) is a proper noun notable for its use of a double Q. ==Words== Unless noted otherwise, all words listed here are assumed to be pluralized by adding -s or -es. References in the \"Sources\" column relate to the headword in column one; variant spellings are then separately referenced. The sources given are selective, and the absence of a reference to a particular dictionary does not necessarily mean that the word does not appear in that dictionary. In American and Canadian English, there are currently 4,422 words with Q and no U including the following words in the table below. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto; clear:both;\"
