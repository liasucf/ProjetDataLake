Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion wrote \"Midway, Pandigai changes genre. It becomes a heist movie. Instead of settling down with the (oft-told) story of a fighter, why not give us the (oft-shown) mechanics of a heist? Double the genre and halve the clich\u00e9s.\"https://www.filmcompanion.in/pandigai- movie-review/ == References == Category:Indian films Category:2010s Tamil- language films Category:Indian boxing films Category:2017 films Category:Indian action thriller films Category:2017 directorial debut films ==External links== * ",
