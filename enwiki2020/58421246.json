    "text": "People Reform Party () is a political party in Thailand. The party was established and registered at the Election Commission on 2 March 2018 by Paiboon Nititawan. In the 2019 general election, the party's stance was to support military junta head General Prayut Chan-o-cha to be an outsider prime minister. It won a single seat, with Paiboon becoming its only MP. On 22 August 2019, Paiboon revealed that the party executive committee had unanimously voted to dissolve the party, as the party only had a single MP and most party executive directors did not have time to organize its branches. On 26 August 2019, the Election Commission of Thailand approved the dissolution of the party, which was officially published in the Royal Thai Government Gazette on 6 September 2019. Paiboon announced that he had applied to become a member of Palang Pracharath Party on 9 September. ==References== Category:2018 establishments in Thailand Category:2019 disestablishments in Thailand Category:Conservative parties in Thailand Category:Defunct conservative parties Category:Defunct political parties in Thailand Category:Political parties disestablished in 2018 Category:Political parties established in 2011 Category:Populist parties ",
