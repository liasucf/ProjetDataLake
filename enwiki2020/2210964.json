He was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. ==Early life== Gathright attended Bonnabel High School in Kenner, Louisiana, where he played baseball and football as a junior and boxed. He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 32nd round of the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft, and signed in August after playing that summer in a Louisiana Sugar Cane League in Sorrento, Louisiana. ==Major league career== ===Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2004-06)=== He made his major league debut with the Devil Rays on June 25, 2004. Gathright was arguably one of the fastest players in major league baseball when he made his major league debut, and led all major league outfielders in range factor (3.06) in 2006. He does not hit for power (with only one home run in his MLB career). From 2006 to 2009, he had the lowest slugging average of players with at least 1000 plate appearances at .298. He has a .263 lifetime batting average going into the 2009 season. Gathright was clocked at 6.1 seconds in the 60-yard dash. While in high school, he jumped over his coach's car.Topkin, Mark (2004) Rays tales. St. Petersburg Times That jumping ability proved useful on the field, as in a 2008 spring training game Gathright jumped over Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hiroki Kuroda, who was trying to tag him out en route to first base. In 2005, he hit .276 in 76 games, and drew 10 walks. ===Kansas City Royals (2006-08)=== On June 20, 2006, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals, along with infielder Fernando Cortez, for left-handed pitcher J.

In 2008 Gathright saw his range factor fall to 2.53, below all but one center field starter in the league. He also hit .254 with a .311 on-base percentage, and only a .272 slugging percentage\u2014below that of all starting outfielders in the major leagues.
