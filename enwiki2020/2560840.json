It is all one large scarlet scream.\" == Cast == * Charles Chaplin - Charlie * Edna Purviance - Nursemaid * Leo White - The Count, Elegant Masher * Leona Anderson - The Count's Fancy * Bud Jamison - Edna's Beau * Billy Armstrong - Sausage Thief * Ernest Van Pelt - Sausage Seller == External links == * * Category:1914 films Category:American films Category:1914 comedy films Category:American comedy films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Essanay Studios films Category:Short films directed by Charlie Chaplin Category:Articles containing video clips Category:1914 short films Category:Comedy short films ",
