    "text": "Aucilla Wildlife Management Area conserves 50,471 acres of hydric hammock, mesic flatwoods, upland forest, and spring-run river twelve miles southeast of Tallahassee in Jefferson County, Florida. == Fauna == The expanse of Aucilla WMA and its diversity of habitats provides a home to a large diversity of animal species. Mammals range from Florida black bears and bobcats to North American river otters and white-tailed deer. The property is part of the Great Florida Birding and Wildlife Trail due to its abundance of warblers, limpkins and wood storks, along with many other migratory and resident bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are represented by species such as eastern diamondback rattlesnakes, gopher tortoises and American alligator s. == History == Evidence of Aucilla Wildlife Management Area's history dates back at least 12,000 years. Bones of prehistoric mammals such as mastodons and giant ground sloths have been found in the Wacissa River, Aucilla River and sinkhole ponds located on the property. Arrow points, pottery and human remains point to the heavy use of this area by Native Americans over the past several thousand years. Slaves modified an existing channel that connected the Aucilla and Wacissa River in an attempt from their masters to enhance access to the Gulf of Mexico from northern markets. Seminole Indians hid out in the dense swamps during offensive campaigns during the Seminole Wars. In the early 1900s, the area saw increased human use as its old-growth bald cypress and longleaf pine was heavily logged. == Recreational Activities == The size and composition of Aucilla Wildlife Management Area allow for a range of recreational activities. The Aucilla and Wacissa Rivers are two of the most popular paddling streams in the Florida Panhandle. The Aucilla River passes karst formations and is considered to be a more challenging paddle. The clear, spring-fed Wacissa River is more popular with tubers and those seeking a more relaxing paddle. The Aucilla Sinks Trail, along with portions of the Florida National Scenic Trail, give hikers access to karst features like sinkholes and solution holes. Goose Pasture Campground along the Wacissa River contains a number of campsites available on a first-come, first-served basis. The sloughs and rivers of Aucilla WMA contain strong populations of largemouth bass, Suwannee bass and bream. Wild turkeys, white-tailed deer and, especially, feral hogs are abundant in the area and hunters may pursue them during the appropriate seasons. == References == Category:Protected areas of Jefferson County, Florida Category:Wildlife management areas of Florida ",
