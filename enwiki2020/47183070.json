    "text": "Hallalhotsoot, with his noted mix of an \"American\" hat with its Niim\u00edipu ornamentation Original Nez Perce territory (green) & reduced reservation of 1863 (brown) Hallalhotsoot, also Hal-hal-tlos-tsot or \"Lawyer\" (c. 1797-1876) was a leader of the Niim\u00edipu (Nez Perce) and among its most famous, after Chief Joseph. He was the son of Twisted Hair, who welcomed and befriended the exhausted Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805. His name appears as early as 1836 in a meeting with Marcus Whitman, and received the nickname \"Lawyer\" for his eloquence. He served as a guide for Whitman. In 1855, he took part in the Walla Walla Council and signed the Treaty of Stevens. This obtained for him a reservation to the greater part of his territory, between the Clearwater and Salmon rivers. After gold was discovered in Pierce in 1860, Lawyer agreed to new cessions of land in the Treaty of 1863, in 1868, which Old Joseph (c.1785\u20131871) did not accept and considered it a betrayal. Therefore, in 1872, Hallalhotsoot was displaced by Chief Joseph as the only head of the tribe. Lawyer Creek in north central Idaho, a tributary of the Clearwater River, is named for him. It carved the deep Lawyer's Canyon, between Ferdinand and Craigmont, and flows east to its mouth at Kamiah. He died in Kamiah and is buried at its Nikesa Cemetery at the Presbyterian church, where he was an elder. == References == ==External links== *Idaho State Historical Society \u2013 Reference Series \u2013 Lawyer and the 1863 Nez Perce Treaty *Idaho Genealogy \u2013 Idaho Indian Tribes Project \u2013 Nez Perce *Nez Perce.com \u2013 Political elements of Nez Perce history during mid-1800s *Historic sites and antiques \u2013 Lawyer Canyon, Idaho * Category:1790s births Category:1876 deaths Category:19th- century Native Americans Category:Indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest Category:Native American leaders Category:Nez Perce people ",
