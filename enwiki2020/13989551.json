During the 1989 World Championship he can be seen in a rather famous photo of cycling history showing the agony of defeat in 2nd place behind Greg Lemond's display of the intensity of victory. In 1990 Konyshev would become the first ever rider from the Soviet Union to win a stage in the Tour de France. While the Soviet's would not allow their riders to join the professional teams until a short while before the end of the Cold War in the 1991 Tour de France Soviet riders had remarkable success winning 5 stages. One by Viatcheslav Ekimov, two by Djamolidine Abdoujaparov who also won the Green Jersey and two stage wins by Konyshev. His victory in stage 17 also made him the last rider for the Soviet Union to win a Tour de France stage. All total in his professional career Konyshev would win nine Grand Tour stages becoming one of the few riders to win a stage in all three Grand Tours. He won 4 apiece in the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia, and he also won a single stage in the Vuelta a Espana. He followed his silver medal at the 1989 World Championship with a Bronze medal in 1992 at Benidorm and later in his career during the 2000 Giro d'Italia he won the Points Classification, as well as the overall Combativity Award. ==Major results== ;1989 :1st, Coppa Ugo Agostoni :1st, Giro dell'Emilia :1st, Stage 2, Settimana Bergamasca :2nd, UCI Road World Championships ;1990 : National Road Race Championship :1st, Stage 17, Tour de France ;1991 :1st, Stage 3, Tirreno\u2013Adriatico :1st, Stages 19 and 22, Tour de France ;1992 :1st, Stage 6, Vuelta a Asturias :3rd, UCI Road World Championships ;1993 : National Road Race Championship :1st, Stages 5 and 12, Giro d'Italia ;1994 :1st, Stage 1, Ronde van Nederland ;1995 :1st, Giro del Friuli ;1996 :1st, Overall, Hofbrau Cup ::1st, Stages 1 and 4 :1st, Stage 18, Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a ;1997 :1st, Grand Prix de Wallonie :Giro d'Italia ::1st, Combination Competition ::1st, Inter Giro Competition ::1st, Stage 9 :1st, Stage 6, Tirreno\u2013Adriatico :1st, Stage 4, Vuelta a Murcia :1st, Stage 6, Tour de Pologne ;1998 :1st, Stage 4, Vuelta Valenciana ;1999 :1st, Coppa Sabatini :1st, Grand Prix de Fourmies :1st, Stage 14, Tour de France ;2000 :1st, Giro della Romagna :20px Points classification, Giro d'Italia ::1st, Stage 6 ;2001 : National Road Race Championship :1st, Coppa Sabatini :1st, Stage 5, Tour de Suisse ;2004 :1st, Tour du Lac L\u00e9man :1st, Stage 4a, Euskal Bizikleta ;2005 :1st, Stage 1, Vuelta a Asturias ==References== ==External links== * *Palmar\u00e8s by cyclingbase.com Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Soviet male cyclists Category:Russian male cyclists Category:Olympic cyclists of Russia Category:Cyclists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Russian Giro d'Italia stage winners Category:Russian Tour de France stage winners Category:Russian Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a stage winners Category:Tour de Suisse stage winners Category:Tour de France Champs Elys\u00e9es stage winners Category:Sportspeople from Nizhny Novgorod Category:Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a cyclists Category:Tour de France cyclists Category:Giro d'Italia cyclists ",
