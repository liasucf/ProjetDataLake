Farmers fell a tract of forest, burn the dead trees, and plant crops in the ashes for as long as the soil remains fertile. Then, the field is abandoned and, although forest trees may recolonize, grass takes over on the bare ground (succession), becoming luxuriant enough to burn within a year or so.https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/grasslands.php#:~:text=A%20third%20type%20of%20savanna,as%20the%20soil%20remains%20fertile.&text;=Savannas%20are%20sometimes%20classified%20as%20forests. ==References== Category:Mountain ranges of Nigeria ",
