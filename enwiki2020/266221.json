Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 23 February 2012 was a French-Canadian Jesuit missionary who founded Michigan's first European settlement, Sault Ste. Marie, and later founded St. Ignace, Michigan. In 1673, Marquette, with Louis Jolliet, an explorer born near Quebec City, was the first European to explore and map the northern portion of the Mississippi River Valley. ==Early life== Jacques Marquette was born in Laon, France, on June 1, 1637. He came of an ancient family distinguished for its civic and military services. Marquette joined the Society of Jesus at age 17. He studied and taught in France for several years, then the Jesuits assigned him to New France in 1666 as a missionary to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. When he arrived Quebec, he was assigned to Trois-Rivi\u00e8res on the Saint Lawrence River, where he assisted Gabriel Druillettes and, as preliminary to further work, devoted himself to the study of the local languages and became fluent in six different dialects.Spalding, Henry. \"Jacques Marquette, S.J.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 15 February 2019 ==Explorations== In 1668, Marquette was moved by his superiors to missions farther up the Saint Lawrence River in the western Great Lakes region. That year he helped Druillettes found the mission at Sault Ste. Marie in present-day Michigan.Monet, J., \u201cMarquette, Jacques\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 1, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2003 Other missions were founded at St. Ignace in 1671 (St. Ignace Mission) and at La Pointe on Lake Superior in present-day Wisconsin. At La Pointe, he encountered members of the Illinois tribes, who told him about the important trading route of the Mississippi River. They invited him to teach their people, whose settlements were mostly farther south. Because of wars between the Hurons at La Pointe and the neighboring Lakota people, Marquette left the mission and went to the Straits of Mackinac; he informed his superiors about the rumored river and requested permission to explore it. Lamprecht (1838\u20131906), at Marquette UniversityThe painting was rendered as an engraving on a US commemorative postage stamp, 1898 (Illustration) Leave was granted, and in 1673 Marquette joined the expedition of Louis Jolliet, a French-Canadian explorer. They departed from St. Ignace on May 17, with two canoes and five voyageurs of French-Indian ancestry. They sailed to Green Bay and up the Fox River, nearly to its headwaters. From there, they were told to portage their canoes a distance of slightly less than two miles through marsh and oak plains to the Wisconsin River. Many years later, at that point the town of Portage, Wisconsin was built, named for the ancient path between the two rivers. From the portage, they ventured forth, and on June 17 they entered the Mississippi near present- day Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. Map of the discovery made in the year 1673 in North America The Joliet-Marquette expedition traveled to within of the Gulf of Mexico but turned back at the mouth of the Arkansas River. By this point they had encountered several natives carrying European trinkets, and they feared an encounter with explorers or colonists from Spain.Catton, Bruce (1984). Michigan: A History, p. 14. W. W. Norton & Company. They followed the Mississippi back to the mouth of the Illinois River, which they learned from local natives provided a shorter route back to the Great Lakes. They reached Lake Michigan near the site of modern-day Chicago, by way of the Chicago Portage. In September, Marquette stopped at the mission of St. Francis Xavier, located in present-day Green Bay, Wisconsin, while Jolliet returned to Quebec to relate the news of their discoveries.Campbell, T.J., \"James Marquette\", Pioneer priests of North America, 1642-1710, Vol. 3, Fordham University Press, 1910 Grave of Marquette, St. Ignace, Michigan. Marquette and his party returned to the Illinois territory in late 1674, becoming the first Europeans to winter in what would become the city of Chicago. As welcomed guests of the Illinois Confederation, the explorers were feasted en route and fed ceremonial foods such as sagamite. ==Death== In the spring of 1675, Marquette traveled westward and celebrated a public mass at the Grand Village of the Illinois near Starved Rock. A bout of dysentery which he had contracted during the Mississippi expedition sapped his health. On the return trip to St. Ignace, he died at age 37 near the modern town of Ludington, Michigan. A Michigan Historical Marker at this location reads: The Ojibway Museum on State Street in downtown St. Ignace is in a building that was constructed adjacent to Marquette's gravesite during urban development. ==Legacy== ===Places=== * Marquette County, Michigan; Marquette County, Wisconsin * Several communities, including: Marquette, Michigan; Marquette, Wisconsin; Marquette, Iowa; Marquette, Illinois; Marquette Heights, Illinois; Pere Marquette Charter Township, Michigan; and Marquette, Manitoba * Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin * Marquette Island in Lake Huron * Lake Marquette in Minnesota; Marquette Lake in Quebec * Pere Marquette River and Pere Marquette Lake, which drain into Lake Michigan at Ludington, Michigan * Marquette River in Quebec; Pere Marquette River in Michigan * Pere Marquette Park in Milwaukee, WI * Pere Marquette State Park near Grafton, Illinois * Marquette Park, Chicago, Illinois * Marquette Park, Gary, Indiana * Pere Marquette Beach, a public beach in Muskegon, Michigan * Pere Marquette State Forest, in Michigan * The Pere Marquette Railway * \"Cit\u00e9 Marquette\", former US-City-Base (1956\u20131966) built by Americans based on the NATO Air Force Base in Couvron (38th Bombardment Wing), Laon, France (his birthplace). * Marquette Transportation Company, a towboat company using a silhouette of the Pere in his canoe as their emblem. * Marquette Building in Chicago; Marquette Building in Detroit; Marquette Building in St. Louis; Pere Marquette Hotel in Peoria, Illinois ===Monuments=== Marquette is memorialized by various statues, monuments and historical markers: * Father Marquette National Memorial near St. Ignace, Michigan * Chicago Portage National Historic Site, along with Louis Jolliet, near Lyons, Illinois * Statues have been erected to Marquette various locations, including at: Detroit, Michigan; Fort Mackinac, Michigan; Marquette, Michigan; Milwaukee, at Marquette University; Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, Utica, Illinois; Laon, France; the National Statuary Hall of the United States Capitol; the Quebec Parliament Building *The Legler Branch of the Chicago Public Library displays \"Wilderness, Winter River Scene,\" a restored mural by Midwestern artist R.
