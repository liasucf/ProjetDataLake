    "text": "The 1968 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 39th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 9, 1968, at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas the home of the Houston Astros of the National League, making this the first All-Star Game to be played indoors. The game resulted in the National League defeating the American League 1\u20130. It is the only All-Star Game played without a run batted in (RBI). This was the first night All-Star Game since 1944. Apart from the 1969 game (which was originally scheduled to be played at night but was postponed to the following afternoon due to rain), all subsequent All-Star Games have been played at night. ==Game summary== The American League was limited to three hits, unable to get a rally going against Don Drysdale, Juan Marichal, Steve Carlton and Tom Seaver, all future Hall of Famers. A first- inning run scored by Willie Mays on a single, an errant pickoff attempt, a wild pitch by Luis Tiant and a double-play ball gave the winning National league the only run they would need. Don Wert's eighth-inning double momentarily gave the AL a threat to tie the game, but Seaver struck out the side. In the ninth, with two out, Jerry Koosman was brought in from the bullpen to face Carl Yastrzemski, whose strikeout ended the game. ==Line score== === Line score === ==External links== *Baseball Almanac *Boxscore at Baseball-Reference Major League Baseball All-Star Game Category:Major League Baseball All-Star Game Category:Baseball in Houston Major League Baseball All- Star Game Category:Sports competitions in Houston Category:July 1968 sports events Category:1960s in Houston ",
