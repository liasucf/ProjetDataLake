    "text": "Artificial seawater (abbreviated ASW) is a mixture of dissolved mineral salts (and sometimes vitamins) that simulates seawater. Artificial seawater is primarily used in marine biology and in marine and reef aquaria, and allows the easy preparation of media appropriate for marine organisms (including algae, bacteria, plants and animals). From a scientific perspective, artificial seawater has the advantage of reproducibility over natural seawater since it is a standardized formula. Synthetic seawater is also known as artificial seawater and substitute ocean water. ==Example== The tables below present an example of an artificial seawater (35.00\u2030 of salinity) preparation devised by Kester, Duedall, Connors and Pytkowicz (1967).Kester, D. R., Duedall, I. W., Connors, D. N. and Pytkowicz, R. M. (1967). Preparation of Artificial Seawater . Limnology & Oceanography 12, 176\u2013179. The recipe consists of two lists of mineral salts, the first of anhydrous salts that can be weighed out, the second of hydrous salts that should be added to the artificial seawater as a solution. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: center; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em;\" |+ Gravimetric salts |- !

C. and McCarthy, J. J. (1978). Steady-state growth and ammonium uptake of a fast-growing marine diatom . Limnology & Oceanography 23, 695\u2013703. make use of trace solutions of vitamins or organic compounds. ==Standard== The International Standard for making Artificial Seawater can be found at ASTM International. The current standard is named ASTM D1141-98 (the original standard was ASTM D1141-52) and describes the standard practice for the preparation of substitute ocean water. ==Uses== There are various applications for ASTM D1141-98 synthetic seawater including corrosion studies, ocean instrument calibration and chemical processing. Typically, laboratory-grade water is used when making synthetic salts ==See also== * Algaculture * Aquarium ==References== ==External links== * Artificial seawater media, Goldman & McCarthy (1978) * Modified Artificial Seawater Media (MASM), Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa * Synthetic Seawaters for Aquaria and Laboratories, Calypso Publications (1979) Category:Seaweeds Category:Aquariums Category:Aquatic ecology Category:Biological oceanography Category:Chemical oceanography Category:Liquid water Category:Marine biology Category:Planktology ",
