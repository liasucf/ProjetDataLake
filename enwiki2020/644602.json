The Leave It to Beaver show still generates merchandise revenue today, many years after its original production run ended. The original sitcom has been shown in over 80 countries in 40 languages. Mathers has noted that the Leave It to Beaver phenomenon is worldwide. \"I can go anywhere in the world, and people know me,\" Mathers has said. \"In Japan, the show's called 'The Happy Boy and His Family.' So I'll be walking through the airport in Japan, and people will come up and say, 'Hi, Happy Boy!'\" When asked in a 2014 television interview whether he had known at the time of the filming of the Leave it to Beaver series that the show was special, and would be in perpetual syndication, Mathers responded: \"No, not at all. I had worked since I was two years old. I did movies. I didn't do any other series, but I had done a lot of movies and things like that so, in fact, every year it was a question whether we would come back for the next year 'cause you had to be picked up. So you would do 39 shows and then we would go to New York and meet all the press, and then we'd go to Chicago to meet the ad people, then we'd come back and take about five to six weeks off, and if we got picked up, then we'd start again. So we did that for six years because that was the length of the contracts at those times. So that's why there are 39 [episodes] for six years, and then it was off the air. Not off the air, but we didn't film any new ones [after that.]\" Mathers remained friends with Barbara Billingsley, who played his TV mother, June Cleaver, and remembered her after her death as \"a good friend and an even better mentor. For me she was like the favorite teacher that we all had in school.\" ===Music=== In 1962, near the end of the run of Leave It to Beaver, Mathers recorded two songs for a single 45 rpm: \"Don't 'Cha Cry,\" and for the flip side, the twist ditty \"Wind-Up Toy.\" During his high school years, Mathers had a band called Beaver and the Trappers. ==Later career== 250px As he moved into his teenage years, Mathers retired from acting to concentrate on high school.
