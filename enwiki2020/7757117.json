The genus name ' is from the Greek in reference to the hairy lips of the flowers of this genus; the specific epithet ' is from the Greek bombylios (bumblebee) in reference to the appearance of the flowers of this species. Ophrys bombyliflora is pollinated by males of solitary bees of the genus Eucera (which are not bumblebees)., p. 349 As with other species of Ophrys, the flowers mimic the females in appearance and scent.
