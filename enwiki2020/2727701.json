The \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0 also recorded that the nation's capital was Phong Ch\u00e2u in present-day Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd Province. It was bordered to the east by the East Sea, to the west by Ba Th\u1ee5c (present-day Sichuan), to the north by Dongting Lake (Hunan), and to the south by Champa. ==Origin of name== ===H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng=== The Vietnamese name is the Sino-Vietnamese pronunciation of characters \"\" assigned to this dynasty in early Vietnamese-written histories in Chinese.

The Vietnamese language provides some clues to the cultural mixture of the Vietnamese people. The area now known as Vietnam has been inhabited since Palaeolithic times, with some archaeological sites in Thanh H\u00f3a Province reportedly dating back around half a million years ago. The prehistoric people had lived continuously in local caves since around 6000 BC, until more advanced material cultures developed.Ancient calendar unearthed. Retrieved 2014-01-05. Some caves are known to have been the home of many generations of early humans.6,000-year-old tombs unearthed in northeast Vietnam. Retrieved 2014-01-19. As northern Vietnam was a place with mountains, forests, and rivers, the number of tribes grew between 5000 and 3000 BC.Lamb, p. 52 Prior to the beginning of the H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng period, the land was settled by autonomous villages. Vietnamese pre-dynastic society was anarchic and did not have any management mechanism. They lived together in groups as tribes. Archaeologists have found many images on the wall of caves which showed the daily living of ancient people. ===The first H\u00f9ng king (c. 2879 BC)=== During a few thousand years in the Late Stone Age, the inhabitant populations grew and spread to every part of Vietnam. Most ancient people were living near the H\u1ed3ng (Red), C\u1ea3 and M\u00e3 rivers. The Vietnamese tribes were the primary tribes at this time. Their territory included modern meridional territories of China to the banks of the H\u1ed3ng River in the northern territory of Vietnam. Centuries of developing a civilization and economy based on the cultivation of irrigated rice encouraged the development of tribal states and communal settlements. Legend describes a significant political event occurred when L\u1ed9c T\u1ee5c came into power in approximately 2879 BC. He consolidated the other tribes and succeeded in grouping all the vassal states (or autonomous communities) within his territory into a unified nation. L\u1ed9c T\u1ee5c proclaimed himself Kinh D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng and called his newly born nation X\u00edch Qu\u1ef7. L\u1ed9c T\u1ee5c inaugurated the earliest monarchical regime as well as the first ruling family by heirdom in Vietnam's history. He is regarded as the ancestor of the H\u00f9ng kings, as the founding father of Vietnam, and as a Vietnamese cultural hero who is credited with teaching his people how to cultivate rice. ===Early H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng (c. 2879 \u2013 c. 1913 BC)=== As rule was passed to the H\u00f9ng king's male heirs, Kinh D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng was succeeded by his son L\u1ea1c Long Qu\u00e2n, who founded the second dynasty of H\u00f9ng kings in c. 2793 BC. Starting from the third H\u00f9ng dynasty since c. 2524 BC, the kingdom was renamed V\u0103n Lang, and the capital was set up at Phong Ch\u00e2u (in modern Vi\u1ec7t Tr\u00ec, Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd) at the juncture of three rivers where the Red River Delta begins from the foot of the mountains. The evidence that the Vietnamese knew how to calculate the lunar calendar by carving on stones dates back to 2200\u20132000 BC. Parallel lines were carved on the stone tools as a counting instrument involving the lunar calendar. ===Middle H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng (c. 1912 \u2013 c. 1055 BC)=== By 1500 BC, the coastal residents developed a sophisticated agricultural society.Vietnam \u2013 History ===Late H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng (c. 1054 \u2013 c. 258 BC)=== The tidal irrigation of rice fields through an elaborate system of canals and dikes started by the sixth century BC. The H\u00f9ng ruler of the Eighteenth Dynasty led the armies to conquer what is modern-day Ngh\u1ec7 An and H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Provinces. A rival people, the proto-Cham people based in modern-day Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province, resisted and a clash between the two sides was inevitable. The H\u00f9ng forces defeated the proto-Chams, annexing the land. The H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng epoch ended in the middle of the third century BC on the advent of the military leader Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n's conquest of V\u0103n Lang, dethroning the last H\u00f9ng king. ===Final moments (c. 258 BC)=== Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n (An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng), the ruler of the neighbouring upland \u00c2u Vi\u1ec7t tribes, overthrew the last H\u00f9ng king in c. 258 BC. After conquering V\u0103n Lang, Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n united the L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t tribes with the \u00c2u Vi\u1ec7t ones to form a new kingdom of \u00c2u L\u1ea1c, building his capital and citadel, C\u1ed5 Loa Citadel in Hanoi's Dong Anh district.. V\u0103n Lang ended BC when Shu prince Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n, the ruler of the neighbouring upland \u00c2u Vi\u1ec7t tribes, overthrew the last H\u00f9ng king in approximately 258 BC. After conquering V\u0103n Lang, Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n united the L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t tribes with the \u00c2u Vi\u1ec7t tribes to form a new kingdom of \u00c2u L\u1ea1c. He proclaimed himself An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng and built his capital and citadel, C\u1ed5 Loa Citadel, in the modern-day Dong Anh district of Hanoi. ===Continued influence=== The L\u1ea1c lords maintained their feudal influence long after demise of the H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng era. These feudal lords faded into history only after the defeat of the Tr\u01b0ng Sisters in mid 1st-century AD. ==Government and economy== ===Organization=== The first H\u00f9ng King established the first Vietnamese state in response to the needs of co-operation in constructing hydraulic systems and in struggles against their enemies. This was a very primitive form of a sovereign state with the H\u00f9ng king on top and under him a court consisted of advisors \u2013 the l\u1ea1c h\u1ea7u. The country was composed of fifteen b\u1ed9 \"regions\", each ruled by a l\u1ea1c t\u01b0\u1edbng; usually the l\u1ea1c t\u01b0\u1edbng was a member of the H\u00f9ng kings' family. B\u1ed9 comprised the agricultural hamlets and villages based on a matriarchal clan relationship and headed by a b\u1ed9 ch\u00ednh, usually a male tribal elder. The eastern border of the country was the Pacific Ocean. Originally, the northern border stretched to the southern part of present-day Hunan, and the southern border stretched to the C\u1ea3 River, including parts of modern Guangxi, Guangdong and Northern Vietnam.Kh\u00e2m \u0111\u1ecbnh Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed th\u00f4ng gi\u00e1m c\u01b0\u01a1ng m\u1ee5c, Vol. 1 Faced with China's southward expansions, beginning in the early first millennium BC, V\u0103n Lang gradually lost its northern territory; and by around 500 BC, its northern border was equivalent to that of the modern Vietnam state. However, simultaneously, the H\u00f9ng kings sought to expand V\u0103n Lang's borders southward. During the last (Eighteenth) dynasty of H\u00f9ng kings, the southern border extended to northern parts of modern-day Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province.Tracing the origin of ethnic and ancestor land during the H\u00f9ng King Age. According to Tr\u1ea7n Tr\u1ecdng Kim's book, Vi\u1ec7t Nam s\u1eed l\u01b0\u1ee3c (A Brief History of Vietnam), the country was divided into 15 regions as in the table below: {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Regions of V\u0103n Lang |- !

Especially, the skill of bronze casting was at a high level. The most famous relics are \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n Bronze Drums on which are depicted houses, clothing, customs, habits, and cultural activities of the H\u00f9ng era. The H\u00f9ng V\u01b0\u01a1ngs ruled V\u0103n Lang in feudal fashion with the aid of the L\u1ea1c T\u01b0\u1edbng, who controlled the communal settlements around each irrigated area, organized construction and maintenance of the dikes, and regulated the supply of water. Besides cultivating rice, the people of V\u0103n Lang grew other grains and beans and raised stock, mainly buffaloes, chickens, and pigs. Pottery-making and bamboo-working were highly developed crafts, as were basketry, leather- working, and the weaving of hemp, jute, and silk. Both transport and communication were provided by dugout canoes, which plied the network of rivers and canals. ==Culture== ===Pottery=== The period between the end of the third millennium and the middle of the first millennium BC produced increasingly sophisticated pottery of the pre-Dong Son cultures of northern Viet Nam and the pre-Sa Hu\u1ef3nh cultures of southern Vietnam. This period saw the appearance of wheel-made pottery, although the use of the paddle and anvil remained significant in manufacture.Hoang and Bui 1980 Vessel surfaces are usually smooth, often polished, and red slipping is common. Cord-marking is present in all cultures and forms a fairly high percentage of sherdage. Complex incised decoration also developed with rich ornamental designs, and it is on the basis of incised decoration that Vietnamese archaeologists distinguish the different cultures and phases one from another. The pottery from the successive cultural developments in the Red River Valley is the most well known. Vietnamese archaeologists here discern three pre-Dong Son cultures: Ph\u00f9ng Nguy\u00ean, \u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1eadu, and G\u00f2 Mun. The pottery of these three cultures, despite the use of different decorative styles, has features that suggest a continuity of cultural development in the Red River Valley. In the Ma River Valley in Thanh H\u00f3a Province, Vietnamese archaeologists also recognize three pre-Dong Son periods of cultural development: Con Chan Tien, Dong Khoi (Bai Man) and Quy Chu. In the areas stretching from the Red to the C\u1ea3 River valleys, all the local cultures eventually developed into the \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture, which expanded over an area much larger than that of any previous culture and Vietnamese archaeologists believe that it had multiple regional sources. For instance, while \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n bronzes are much the same in different regions of northern Viet Nam, the regional characters of the pottery are fairly marked. On the whole, \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n pottery has a high firing temperature and is varied in form, but decorative patterns are much reduced in comparison with preceding periods, and consist mainly of impressions from cord-wrapped or carved paddles. Incised decoration is virtually absent. ==Demographics== ===Ethnic minorities=== Contemporary Vietnamese historians have established the existence of various ethnic minorities now living in the highlands of North and Central Vietnam during the early phase of the H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng Dynasty.Phan Huy L\u00ea, Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c V\u01b0\u1ee3ng, H\u00e0 V\u0103n T\u1ea5n, L\u01b0\u01a1ng Ninh, p. 99 ==Technology== ===Bronze tools=== Image on the Ngoc Lu bronze drum's surface By about 1200 BC., the development of wet-rice cultivation and bronze casting in the M\u00e3 River and Red River plains led to the development of the \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture, notable for its elaborate bronze drums. The bronze weapons, tools, and drums of \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n sites show a Southeast Asian influence that indicates an indigenous origin for the bronze-casting technology. Many small, ancient copper mine sites have been found in northern Vietnam. Some of the similarities between the \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n sites and other Southeast Asian sites include the presence of boat-shaped coffins and burial jars, stilt dwellings, and evidence of the customs of betel-nut-chewing and teeth-blackening. ===Canals and dikes=== An important advancement occurred by the 6th century BC: the irrigation of rice fields (lac dien) through an elaborate system of canals and dikes. This type of sophisticated farming system would come to define Vietnamese society. It required tight-knit village communities to collectively manage their irrigation systems. These systems in turn produced crop yields that could sustain much higher population densities than competing methods of food production.eHistory, Ohio State University.
