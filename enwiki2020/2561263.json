    "text": "Sheep on Drugs are a British techno/Industrial music group, formed by Duncan X ( King Duncan) (vocals) and Lee Fraser (a.k.a. Dead Lee) (guitar/keyboards) and currently composed of Fraser and Johnny Borden (vocals/keyboards). ==Biography== Originally classified as part of the rave movement, the duo emerged in the early 1990s with a string of singles, including \"Motorbike,\" \"15 Minutes of Fame\" and \"Track X\" (later covered by Grace Jones as \"Sex Drive\"). \"15 Minutes of Fame\" reached the lower reaches of the UK Singles Chart as did \"From A To H And Back Again\". Their Gareth Jones produced debut album, Greatest Hits, was released on Island Records in 1993 to some acclaim from the UK music press. However, with their Grand Guignol style stage shows, and a musical mixture of sleazy rock, hard techno and punk nihilism, SoD found themselves pigeonholed as an industrial band. Their 1994 follow-up album, ...On Drugs was a commercial and critical disappointment. > \"For the 'On Drugs' album, it was basically me and Duncan locked in a room, > with no guidance about what direction we were to take it in, no producer. > Markus Dravs, who did the production for that album, he's a brilliant artist > in his own right, but he wasn't the producer we needed. He was just brought > into the studio to mix, it wasn't like he was an active part of the team, so > they fucked that up. So, no wonder the second album wasn't as commercial as > they were expecting, because they didn't give us any guidance,\" according to > Lee. After being dropped by Island, the band independently released two EPs: Suck in 1994 and Strapped for Cash in 1995. The band was then signed to Martin Atkins' Invisible Records and headed to the United States. With Invisible, they released the two EPs as Double Trouble in 1996, their third studio album, One for the Money and a remix collection, Never Mind the Methadone in 1997, and a live recording, Two for the Show in 1998. By this time, they had tired of their situation in the States and were unsatisfied with Invisible. Frontman Duncan X departed Sheep on Drugs shortly afterwards to become a professional tattooist (though he does perform live with the band on rare occasions). Fraser continued his relationship with Invisible Records, releasing two more albums as 'Bagman' and was briefly a member of Atkins' bands Pigface and The Damage Manual, usually under the moniker \"Lee 303\". Fraser revived the group in 2002 with himself as the frontman and released a new album, F**K, on Invisible in 2005. A best of compilation album called Best of a Bad Bunch was released in 2006. After the release of F**K, Lee Fraser met and began working with Johnny Borden, herself a singer and musician working within similar circles. Johnny was soon brought on board as Lee's partner in Sheep On Drugs' new 21st century incarnation and they began gigging, developing new material which was released on their new album MEDICATION TIME (released digitally on 6 December 2010). The album was to be released by a French record label on physical CDs in 2011 to accompany a tour in February. CLUB MEDS, an album of remixes of trackes from Medication Time followed in 2012. Lee and Johnny continued to perform live until their self released album DOES DARK MATTER on vinyl and download formats in 2019. This album sees an orthaganol shift in Sheep On Drugs sound with melodic and dub sounds. A cassette E.P of remixes 2 light 2 dark followed in late 2019 on cassette. During lockdown caused by COVID_19 Johnny and Lee managed to very creatively release a single Moonlight Man. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Greatest Hits (Island, 1993) * ...On Drugs (Island, 1994) * Double Trouble (Invisible, 1996) - compilation and re-release of Drug Squad EPs. * One for the Money (Invisible, 1997) * Never Mind the Methadone (Invisible, 1997) - remixes * Two for the Show (Invisible, 1998) - live * F**K (Invisible, 2005) * Best Of A Bad Bunch (Underground, Inc., 2006) - compilation and remixes * MEDICATION TIME (digital, 2010) * Club Meds (Real Recordings, 2012) * Does Dark Matter {Sheep on Drugs, 2019} ===EPs=== * From A to H and Back Again (Smash/Island, 1994) * Strapped for Cash (Drug Squad, 1995) * Suck (Drug Squad, 1995) * 2 Light 2 Dark {Sheep on Drugs, 2019} ===Singles=== * \"Catch 22\" / \"Drug Music\" (Transglobal, 1991) * \"Motorbike\" / \"Mary Jane\" (Transglobal, 1992) * \"Track X\" (Transglobal, 1992) * \"TV USA\" (Transglobal, 1992) * \"15 Minutes of Fame\" (Island, 1993) * \"Let the Good Times Roll\" (Island, 1994) * \"Moonlight Man\" [Sheep On Drugs 2020] As Bagman (Lee Fraser solo) * \"Wrap\" (Invisible, 1998) * \"Trax\" (Underground, Inc., 2004) ===Tribute Albums=== * \"Back in Black\" (with Pigface) on Covered In Black: An Industrial Tribute To The Kings Of High Voltage AC/DC (Cleopatra, 1997) * \"California \u00dcber Alles\" on Dread Kennedys: A Tribute To Dead Kennedys / In Dub We Trust (Invisible, 1999) * \"Wish\" on Covered In Nails: A Tribute To Nine Inch Nails (Cleopatra, 2000) * \"Money\" on Don't Blow Your Cover: A Tribute to KMFDM (Cleopatra, 2000) ===Soundtracks=== * \"Cathode Ray\", \"Uberman\", and \"15 Minutes Of Fame\" on The Young Americans (Island, 1993) * \"Machine Sex\" on Prey (2K Games, 2006) ==References== ==External links== *The official Sheep on Drugs site *[ Sheep on Drugs] on Allmusic *Band history *Sheep on Drugs @ Invisible Records *Sheep on Drugs myspace page *bandcamp Category:Musical groups established in 1990 Category:British techno music groups Category:British electronic music groups Category:Electronic rock musical groups Category:Dance-punk musical groups Category:Underground, Inc. artists Category:Rhythm King artists ",
