    "text": "Vincente Fortunato is fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as an elderly crime boss and enemy of the superhero Spider-Man. He first appeared in Spider- Man #70. He is affiliated with the Maggia and HYDRA, and a competitor to the Kingpin. ==Publication history== The character first appeared in Spider-Man #70 (July 1996) and was created by Howard Mackie and John Romita Jr. ==Fictional character biography== When the Kingpin (Wilson Fisk) was absent from New York for a long period of time, Fortunato stepped into the power vacuum and, using his Hydra ties, was able to force the other crime lords, such as the Slug and Hammerhead, into accepting him as the new kingpin. His elder son Giacomo is present at the meeting where Fortunato portrays his power. The Don brings out the killer Tombstone to be executed. Then he brings out random civilians from each of the crime lord's territories. The plan is to have each crime lord kill a civilian, showcasing how Fortunato would punish disobedience by civilian massacres. Jimmy 6, horrified, pulls a gun on his father in front of the crowd of people. The spectators do not intervene, wishing to see how Fortunato would handle this. Ben Reilly (then Spider-Man), intervenes, soon joined by Daredevil. The innocent civilians are freed but they and the heroes are cornered, pursued by various members of the meeting. Jimmy-6 shows up in an attack helicopter, killing the pursuers and rescuing the civilians and the superheroes. Jimmy eventually reconciles with his father, but extends his debt to Ben to Peter Parker. Fortunato's dominance was eventually shattered when the Kingpin returned, launching a massed simultaneous attack on New York's crime lords and taking command during the confusion. The assassin Nitro attacks Fortunato on the Kingpin's orders, leaving him comatose. Jimmy-6 was seen leading his organization for several months afterward. Later, the elderly Fortunato re-emerged and bought the Venom Symbiote at an auction for his younger son, the awkward 18-year-old Angelo. Angelo attempts to use the suit to kill Spider-Man, but the symbiote rejects him as unworthy and allowed him to fall to his death.Marvel Knights: Spider- Man #8 It was also confirmed that Jimmy-6 had somehow made peace with his father, as Fortunato briefly referred to him as \"My Beautiful Giacomo\", showing no signs of ill will. ==References== ==External links== *Don Fortunato on the Marvel Wiki Category:Characters created by John Romita Jr. Category:Characters created by Howard Mackie Category:Comics characters introduced in 1996 Category:Fictional crime bosses Category:Fictional mobsters Category:Marvel Comics supervillains Category:Spider-Man characters ",
