The Scarlet Knights played their home games at HighPoint.com Stadium in Piscataway, New Jersey and competed as members of the East Division of the Big Ten Conference. They were led by third-year head coach Chris Ash. Rutgers began the year with a 35\u20137 victory over Texas State, but things quickly turned south for the team. After a blowout loss to Ohio State in Rutgers' conference opener, the team traveled to play Kansas, who had lost 39 of their previous 42 games against FBS opponents. Note: the source lists 39 of 41 as of the beginning of the 2018 season, and Kansas defeated FBS team Central Michigan the week prior. Rutgers lost in a blowout, 55\u201314. The next week, the team was blown out 42\u201313 by Buffalo of the Mid-American Conference. In the remainder of conference play, the Scarlet Knights were mostly outmatched, losing the rest of their games, despite holding fourth quarter leads in games against Northwestern and Michigan State. Rutgers' final record of 1\u201311 matched the previous school record for losses in a season with their 1\u201311 2002 team and 0\u201311 1997 team. Freshman quarterback Artur Sitowski led the team in passing, finishing with 1,158 passing yards, 4 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions. Sophomore running back Raheem Blacksheer led the team in both rushing and receiving yards, and had 953 yards from scrimmage on the year. On defense, senior linebacker Trevor Morris finished in sixth in the conference with 105 total tackles. He concluded his career in ninth on the school's all-time leaderboard for total tackles. ==Previous season== The Scarlet Knights finished the 2017 season 4\u20138, 3\u20136 in Big Ten play to finish in fifth place in the East Division. ==Offseason== ===Recruits=== The Scarlet Knights signed a total of 21 recruits. ===Award watch lists=== Listed in the order that they were released {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |John Mackey Award |Jerome Washington |TE |SR |} ==Schedule== ==Roster and coaching staff== ==Game summaries== ===Texas State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" |colspan=3|First meeting |} ===at No. 4 Ohio State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 0\u20134 | 2017 | L, 0\u201356 |} ===at Kansas=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 1\u20130 | 2015 | W, 27\u201314 |} ===Buffalo=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 5\u20131 | 2007 | W, 38\u20133 |} ===Indiana=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 2\u20132 | 2017 | L, 0\u201341 |} ===Illinois=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 2\u20132 | 2017 | W, 35\u201324 |} ===at Maryland=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 6\u20137 | 2017 | W, 31\u201324 |} ===Northwestern=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 3\u20130 | 1991 | W, 22\u201318 |} ===at Wisconsin=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 0\u20132 | 2015 | L, 10\u201348 |} ===No. 4 Michigan=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 1\u20133 | 2017 | L, 14\u201335 |} ===No. 16 Penn State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 2\u201326 | 2017 | L, 6\u201335 |} ===at Michigan State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 3\u20136 | 2017 | L, 7\u201340 |} ==Players drafted into the NFL== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- style=\"text-align:center; \" | Round || Pick || Player || Position || NFL Club |- | 6 || 177 || Saquan Hampton || S || New Orleans Saints |- | 6 || 196 || Blessuan Austin || CB || New York Jets |} ==References== Rutgers Category:Rutgers Scarlet Knights football seasons Rutgers Scarlet Knights f ",
