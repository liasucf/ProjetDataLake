After his superior was killed in a battle, upon the request of the citizens, he moved to Ahlat (now a district center in Bitlis Province of Turkey, then an important Islamic cultural center) where he fought against Marwanids and captured the city on behalf of the Great Seljuk Empire in 1100.Prof. Ya\u015far Y\u00fcce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T\u00fcrkiye tarihi Cilt I, AKDTYKTTK Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, \u0130stanbul, 1991 p 155 ==Beylik== S\u00f6kmen captured the nearby settlements to the north and west of the Lake Van and increased his power of influence. His most successful conquest is the conquest of Silvan (now a district center in Diyarbak\u0131r Province of Turkey, then known as Mayyafaraqin).Islam Encyclopaedia But he was always loyal to the Seljukid sultan Mohammad I Tapar and participated in the campaigns of the sultan. Mohammad in turn granted Ahlat to S\u00f6kmen as an ikta in 1110. Thus this date is now considered to be the date of the establishment of Ahlatshahs Beylik. In some documents the name of the beylik is \"S\u00f6kmenli\" referring to S\u00f6kmen. ==Death== In 1111, he was invited to participate in a Seljukid campaign. With his troops he joined the main Seljukid army. But during the siege of Turbessel (a castle near Gaziantep) he died in August 1111. His coffin was sent to Ahlat. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:Turkic rulers Category:1111 deaths Category:11th-century births Category:History of Bitlis Province Category:People of the Seljuq Empire Category:11th-century Turkic people Category:Ethnic Turkmen people ",
