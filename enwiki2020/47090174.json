    "text": "James Archibald Mackinnon (1841 - 2 September 1910) was an Australian politician. He was born in Benalla and was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne. He worked as a station agent around the Murray River, and eventually owned land around Young. In 1882 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Young. In 1885 he was defeated by two votes, in a result that was overturned and resulted in Mackinnon resuming his seat. Initially associated with the Protectionists, he joined the Labor Party when it formed in 1891, but refused to sign the pledge and was defeated as a Protectionist in 1894. He later moved to Grenfell, where he died in 1910. ==References== Category:1841 births Category:1910 deaths Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:Protectionist Party politicians ",
