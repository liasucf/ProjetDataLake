He studied at The Lee Strasberg Institute & the Atlantic Theater Company, and at Tisch's Experimental Theater Wing (both in America and Amsterdam). ==The Dell Dude== As part of a commercial advertising campaign, Curtis portrayed the character Steven. The casting call asked for a boy 12 to 17 years old; Curtis was 20. This advertising campaign popularized the phrase \"Dude, you're getting a Dell\". The commercials would usually feature Steven informing prospective buyers of all the perks of owning a Dell. When the party was sold on the idea he would close with the catchphrase \"Dude, you're getting a Dell.\" The campaign was a success and brought prominence to Dell and Curtis.\"The mystery of the Dell dude.\" \u2014 by Rob Walker \u2014 Slate Magazine Curtis' tenure with Dell ended shortly after he was arrested and accused of buying a bag of marijuana in 2003. Dell terminated the role and according to Curtis, he was blacklisted from the entertainment community, and it was difficult for him to find work. ==Life after Dell== In 2005, Curtis played the role of Christian in the Off-Broadway comedy Joy by John Fisher.
