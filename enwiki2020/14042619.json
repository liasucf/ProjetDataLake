Elbeg was the younger brother of Jorightu Khan and ruled for seven years. His reigning title Nig\u00fcles\u00fcgchi Khagan means \"Merciful Emperor\" in Mongolian language. Border skirmishes with Ming China and the Oirat rebellion plagued his reign. ==Reign== During his reign, the Oirats began to openly challenge the Borjigin family and the Ming repulsed Mongolian invasions. According to Tsagaan Sechen, Elbeg was charged with responsibility for all things wrong. To prevent hostilities from the Taifu's family, he gave his daughter Samur Gunj in marriage to the Taifu's son. Ugetchi Khashikha who was ruler of the Oirads at the time, resisted the Khagan's decision to appoint a new ruler over his tribes. He persuaded Batula that the violent khan who had killed his own kin could was not fit to be Emperor. Batula wanted to avenge the death of his father as well. In 1399, Elbeg Nig\u00fcles\u00fcgchi Khagan was defeated by the Four Oirats and was killed by their leaders, Ugetchi Khashikha and Batula, as a result. Several months after his death, his crown was succeeded by his eldest son G\u00fcn Tem\u00fcr Khan. Allied with the late khan's principal consort Kobeguntai who was jealous of Elbeg's issue with Oljeitu, Ugetchi Khashikha seized his harem and all his properties. ==Issue== #G\u00fcn Tem\u00fcr Khan #\u00d6r\u00fcg Tem\u00fcr Khan #Samur Gunj ==See also== * List of khans of the Northern Yuan dynasty ==References== *Jack Weatherford - The Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire Crown 2010 Category:1361 births Category:1399 deaths Category:Northern Yuan rulers Category:14th-century Mongol rulers Category:Filicides ",
