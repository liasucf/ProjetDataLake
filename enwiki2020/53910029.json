    "text": "Anbox is a free and open-source compatibility layer that aims to allow mobile applications and mobile games developed for Android to run on GNU/Linux distributions. Canonical introduced Anbox Cloud, for running Android applications in a cloud environment. == Technical overview == It executes the Android runtime environment by using LXC (Linux Containers), recreating the directory structure of Android as a mountable loop image, whilst using the native Linux kernel to execute applications. It makes use of Linux namespaces through LXC for isolation. Applications do not have any direct hardware access, all accesses are sent through the Anbox daemon. == See also == * Android-x86 - An open source project that makes an unofficial porting of Google's Android mobile operating system to run on devices powered by AMD and Intel x86 processors, rather than RISC-based ARM chips. * The SPURV compatibility layer is a similar project developed by Collabora. *Wine - A Windows compatibility layer for Unix-like systems. == References == == External links == * Anbox * Port to Sailfish OS Category:Android emulation software Category:Compatibility layers Category:Free system software Category:Linux emulation software ",
