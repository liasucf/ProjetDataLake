Blazier; and commissioned on 21 February 1943, Lieutenant Eskil A. Bjork, USNR, in command. ==Service history== During World War II, LST-462 was assigned to the Asiatic-Pacific theater. She took part in the Hollandia operation in May 1944; the Western New Guinea operations, the Biak Islands operation in May and June 1944, the Noemfoor Island operation in July 1944, the Cape Sansapor operation in July and August 1944, and the Morotai landing in September 1944; the Leyte operation in October 1944; the Lingayen Gulf landings in January 1945; and the Balikpapan operation in June and July 1945. Following the war, LST-462 returned to the United States and was decommissioned on 21 March 1946, and struck from the Navy list on 1 May, that same year. On 15 December 1948, the tank landing ship was sold to Hughes Bros., Inc., of New York City, and subsequently scrapped. ==Honors and awards== LST-462 earned five battle stars for her World War II service. == Notes == ;Citations == Bibliography == Online resources * * * ==External links== * Category:1942 ships Category:World War II amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:LST-1-class tank landing ships of the United States Navy Category:S3-M2-K2 ships Category:Ships built in Vancouver, Washington ",
