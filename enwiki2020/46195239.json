    "text": "The Catholic Secondary Schoolgirls' Sports Association (CaSSSA) is a sporting association for girls from fourteen Catholic secondary schools based in south- east Queensland, Australia. Competition is offered to girls from Years 7 to 12. The association was formed in 2014 as an amalgamation of the Catholic Secondary Girls' Schools Sports Association (CSGSSA, which organised Swimming, Athletics, and Cross country), the Catholic Schools Tennis Association (CSTA, founded in 1930) and the Brisbane School Girls Sports Association (BSGSA, founded in 1996 and organising other team sports). The championships for Swimming, Cross Country, and Track and Field (Athletics) are split into two competitions. The larger schools (9 in total) compete for the CaSSSA Cup while the other schools (5 in total) compete for the CaSSSA Shield. == Schools == === Members === {| class=\"wikitable\" !School !Location !Enrolment !Founded !Denomination !Boys/Girls !Day/Boarding !Year Entered Competition !School Colours |- |All Hallows' School |Fortitude Valley |1550 |1861 |Roman Catholic |Girls |Day | |Blue, White & Rust |- |Brigidine College |Indooroopilly |700 |1929 |Roman Catholic |Girls |Day | |Green, blue & yellow |- |Downlands College |Toowoomba |900 |1931 |Roman Catholic |Girls and Boys |Day & Boarding | |Blue & Red |- |Loreto College |Coorparoo |710 |1928 |Roman Catholic |Girls |Day | | |- |Lourdes Hill College |Hawthorne |910 |1916 |Roman Catholic |Girls |Day | |Purple |- |Mary MacKillop College |Nundah | |1964 |Roman Catholic |Girls |Day | | |- |Mt Alvernia College | Kedron |800 |1956 |Roman Catholic |Girls |Day | |Maroon & Grey |- |Mount St Michael's College |Ashgrove |900 |1929 |Roman Catholic |Girls |Day | |Blue & Gold |- |Our Lady\u2019s College |Annerley | |1964 |Roman Catholic |Girls |Day | | |- |St John Fisher College |Bracken Ridge | |1981 |Roman Catholic |Girls |Day | | |- |St Mary's College |Ipswich |650 |1863 |Roman Catholic |Girls |Day | | |- |St Rita\u2019s College |Clayfield |1100 |1926 |Roman Catholic |Girls |Day | |Brown, White & Yellow |- |San Sisto College |Carina |817 |1961 |Roman Catholic |Girls |Day | |Red & Green |- |Stuartholme School |Toowong |705 |1920 |Roman Catholic |Girls |Day & Boarding | |Red, Gold & Blue |} == Sports == A range of sports are offered during each trimester within a year. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Trimester 1 !style=\"width:9em;\"|Sport !Year level |- |Australian football |align=center| 7\u201312 |- |Touch football |align=center| 7\u20138 |- |Volleyball |align=center| 9\u201311 |- |Tennis |align=center| 7\u201312 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Trimester 2 !style=\"width:9em;\"|Sport !Year level |-pooo |Volleyball |align=center| 9\u201312 |- |Netball |align=center| 9\u201312 |- |Soccer |align=center| 7\u201312 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Trimester 3 !style=\"width:9em;\"|Sport !Year level |- |Basketball |align=center| 7\u201312 |- |Touch football |align=center| 9\u201312 |- |Netball |align=center| 7\u20138 |} ==See also== *List of schools in Queensland *Head of the River (Queensland) ==References== Category:Australian school sports associations Category:Sports governing bodies in Queensland Category:2014 establishments in Australia Category:Sports organizations established in 2014 ",
