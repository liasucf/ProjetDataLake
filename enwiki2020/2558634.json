    "text": "Robert Gould \"Bobbie\" Shaw III (18 August 1898 \u2013 10 July 1970) was an American-born English socialite. He was the only son of Nancy Witcher Langhorne and Robert Gould Shaw II, a landowner and socialite. After his parents' divorce in 1903, he moved to England with his mother Nancy, who later married Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor and became the first woman in Britain to take her seat as a member of parliament. ==Life== Robert Gould Shaw III was born on 18 August 1898 in Beverly, Massachusetts. Through his father, he was a grandson of investor Quincy Adams Shaw and cousin of Civil War Union casualty Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. His maternal grandparents were railroad millionaire Chiswell Dabney Langhorne and Nancy Witcher (n\u00e9e Keene) Langhorne.Marlowe, Derek; Nancy Astor: The Lady from Virginia; Dell Publishing (1982); Robert Gould Shaw III's father had a limited role in his life while he had a close, if occasionally difficult, relationship with his mother. His parents divorced in 1903, and in 1904 he moved to England with his mother Nancy where she would marry Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor in 1906, with whom she had five more children, including William Astor, 3rd Viscount Astor. In 1919, she was the first woman to take her seat as Member of Parliament and served as MP for Plymouth until 1945. After moving to England, Robert Gould Shaw III was educated at Shrewsbury School. He briefly served in the Life Guards but his increasing alcoholism caused difficulty. ===Troubles and death=== Robert Gould Shaw III had long had suicidal tendencies and his life mostly went adrift from an early point. In 1931, he was imprisoned for six months for homosexual offences. His alcoholism, his mother's death, and the death of his half-brother William in 1966 may have increased his suicidal tendencies. He killed himself 10 July 1970. His ashes are buried in the Octagon Temple, the estate chapel of Cliveden. John Singer Sargent did a 1923 charcoal portrait of Shaw in his military uniform. His mother gave the portrait to Alfred E. Goodey, art collector and Shaw's partner, and it was later sold in England in 2011 for \u00a323,000. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1898 births Category:1970 deaths Category:English socialites Category:American socialites Category:LGBT people from England Category:People prosecuted under anti-homosexuality laws Category:Socialites who committed suicide Category:Suicides in England Robert Category:American people of English descent Category:American people of Swiss descent Category:English people of Swiss descent Category:People educated at Shrewsbury School Category:British Life Guards officers ",
