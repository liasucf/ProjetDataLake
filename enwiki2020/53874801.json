    "text": "The Nun is a 2018 American gothic supernatural horror film directed by Corin Hardy and written by Gary Dauberman, from a story by Dauberman and James Wan. It is a spin-off of 2016's The Conjuring 2 and the fifth installment in the Conjuring Universe franchise. The film stars Demi\u00e1n Bichir, Taissa Farmiga and Jonas Bloquet, with Bonnie Aarons reprising her role as the Demon Nun, an incarnation of Valak, from The Conjuring 2. The plot follows a Roman Catholic priest and a nun in her novitiate as they uncover an unholy secret in 1952 Romania. Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema announced The Nun, a spin- off film to The Conjuring 2, which had opened five days earlier, with Safran and Wan producing. The initial script for the film was written by David Leslie Johnson. Hardy had signed on to direct The Nun with a new screenplay from Wan and Dauberman. Principal photography began in May 2017 in Bucharest, Romania, and during filming, the set was blessed by a Roman Catholic clergyman. The Nun was released in the United States on September 7, 2018, by Warner Bros. Pictures. Critics praised its performances and atmosphere but criticized its weak narrative and over-reliance on jump-scares. It grossed $365million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of the series. A sequel is currently in development with Akela Cooper penning the script and James Wan and Peter Safran co-producing the project. ==Plot== In 1952 Romania, two nuns living at the Saint Cartha's monastery are attacked by an unseen evil force after entering a tunnel to retrieve an ancient Christian relic. The surviving nun, Sister Victoria, flees from the attacker, a demon appearing as a nun, and hangs herself. Her body is discovered by Frenchie, a villager who transports supplies to the nuns. The Vatican learns of the incident and summons Father Burke to Rome, where they ask him to travel with Sister Irene, a nun in her novitiate, to Romania in order to investigate the situation. While Sister Irene is teaching children the relationship between religion and science in a school, her Mother Superior interrupts her and informs her that Burke has arrived in order to request Irene's accompaniment in his trip to Romania. The pair travels to Romania and meets with Frenchie, who leads them to the abbey. They discover Victoria's body and take a key from her corpse. Inside, they encounter the Abbess, who informs them that the nuns observe a period of silence during the night and offers them lodging at the attached convent if they wish to return tomorrow. Frenchie is attacked by a demon as he returns to the village, but escapes. Burke tells Irene that a boy he exorcised in the past, Daniel, was fatally injured during the ritual, and Burke has carried the burden of the boy's death with him ever since. Irene reveals that as a girl, she had visions and each of them concluded with \"Mary points the way\", causing the Church to take an interest in her. That night, Burke is rescued by Irene after being buried alive in the graveyard by the demonic entity. The next day, Irene and Burke return to the abbey, but only Irene can enter as it is cloistered. She meets some of the other nuns and learns that they are praying constantly, swapping in shifts, to keep the evil entity at bay. Sister Oana reveals the abbey's history: it was built in the Middle Ages as a castle by a duke obsessed with the occult. The duke summoned the demon through a rift in the catacombs but was killed by Christian knights, who sealed the rift with a vial filled with the Blood of Christ. However, the bombings during World War II accidentally reopened the rift, unleashing the evil entity once more. Burke identifies the demon as Valak and discovers the Abbess has been dead all along. Frenchie heads back to the abbey to help Irene and Burke. Irene is attacked by Valak and joins the nuns in desperate prayer to ward off the demon. When the group reunites, Irene discovers that none of the nuns she had seen and talked to were real and she had been praying alone, later realizing that Victoria had been the last nun in the abbey and had sacrificed herself to stop Valak from possessing her body and unleashing evil. Theorizing that Valak can only be stopped if they seal the rift with the blood of Christ contained in the reliquary, the trio retrieves the vial with the key Victoria possessed. Irene then informs Burke that God has called her to make her solemn vows as a nun and asks Burke to elevate her to the status of a professed nun, which he does in the abbey's chapel. After the trio unlocks the tunnel door, Irene is lured into a pentagram and possessed by Valak. Frenchie smears some of the blood of Christ on her face, casting out the demon. Burke is wounded by Daniel's ghost as Valak starts to drown Irene in a flooded chamber. Irene expels the blood of Christ in the demon's face, banishing it as the blood of Christ seals the rift. After Frenchie resuscitates Irene, he reveals his real name is Maurice. Unbeknownst to the others, Maurice has been possessed by Valak, as evidenced by an inverted cross on his neck. Twenty years later at a university seminar, in Wakefield, Massachusetts, Carolyn Perron watches as Ed and Lorraine Warren present footage of their attempt to exorcise a possessed Maurice. In the footage, Maurice grabs Lorraine, giving her visions of Ed dying, which initiates the Warrens' investigation of the Perron farmhouse haunting. ==Cast== Additionally, Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Christof Veillon, Lili Taylor and Shannon Kook appear in archive footage from The Conjuring as Ed and Lorraine Warren, the older Maurice Theriault, Carolyn Perron and Drew Thomas respectively. Sterling Jerins appears in archive footage from The Conjuring 2 as Judy Warren. ==Production== ===Development=== On June 15, 2016, Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema announced The Nun, a spin-off film to The Conjuring 2, which had opened five days earlier. Peter Safran and James Wan produced. The initial script for the film was written by David Leslie Johnson. On February 17, 2017, it was announced that Corin Hardy had signed on to direct The Nun with a new screenplay from Wan and Gary Dauberman. During the filming of Annabelle: Creation, Safran revealed that The Nun would chronologically come first in the Conjuring Universe, making it a further prequel to The Conjuring series and Annabelle series. He said, \"We have a board that we created that has what we hope will ultimately be our series of movies. We have it in chronological order, so we can keep track of where it all happens.\" ===Casting=== On April 5, 2017, Demi\u00e1n Bichir was cast in the film, as a priest investigating a nun's mysterious suicide. Taissa Farmiga was cast shortly after, as a Roman Catholic nun in her novitiate. Corin Hardy later said that he initially did not want to cast Farmiga due to her being the sister of The Conjuring star Vera Farmiga, but changed his mind when he saw her auditions, \"I watched 100 auditions for this role and she had some kind of presence outside of her own body that is evident, and she's phenomenal.\" Bonnie Aarons was then set to reprise her role as the \"Demon Nun\" character Valak from The Conjuring 2. Charlotte Hope, Jonas Bloquet, and Ingrid Bisu were subsequently announced to star, rounding out the main cast. ===Filming=== Principal photography for the film began on May 3, 2017, at Castel Film Studios in Bucharest, Romania, with Maxime Alexandre serving as cinematographer. Film director Corin Hardy had a Roman Catholic priest bless the set prior to filming. Scenes were filmed in the Palace of the Parliament building in June, for a fee of \u20ac5,000 per hour. Filming also took place at the Corvin Castle in Hunedoara and in Sighi\u0219oara, Transylvania. Hardy saw a handprint in the dust while filming in Mogo\u0219oaia, which he believed to be that of a ghost. Hardy announced on his social media accounts that production had wrapped on June 23, 2017, after 38 days. ===Post-production=== The Nun reportedly went under extensive reshoots. The Curse of La Llorona cinematographer Michael Burgess had worked on the film. Wan also worked as a second unit director under Hardy. ==Music== The original musical score for The Nun was composed by Abel Korzeniowski, and was released on August 31, 2018, by WaterTower Music. ==Release== Warner Bros. Pictures had initially scheduled The Nun to be released in the United States on July 13, 2018. In February 2018, it was announced that the film's release date would be pushed back to September 7, 2018. On June 13, 2018, a teaser trailer was released. In August 2018, a short advertisement for the film was removed from YouTube due to an unskippable jump scare that violated the platform's \"Shocking Content\" policies. The studio spent an estimated $90million on prints and advertisements for the film. The film was released on Digital HD on November 20, 2018, and on Blu-ray and DVD on December 4, 2018. ==Reception== ===Box office=== The Nun grossed $117.5million in the United States and Canada, and $248.1million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $365.6million, against a production budget of $22million, becoming the highest-grossing film in the franchise. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $155million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues. In the United States and Canada, The Nun was released alongside Peppermint and God Bless the Broken Road, and was originally projected to gross $32\u201337million in its opening weekend. By the week of its release, forecasts had been increased to $36\u201345million from 3,876 theaters. It made $22.4million on its first day, including $5.4million from Thursday night previews, both the highest such numbers for The Conjuring films. It went on to debut to $53.8million, also marking the best figure of the franchise, and became the first film in almost a month to finish ahead of Crazy Rich Asians at the box office. In other territories, it currently ranks as the highest- grossing horror film of all time in twelve markets, including the Philippines (where it has grossed $5million in its first week), Indonesia, Brazil, Romania and UAE.http://woman.ph/the-nun-is-a-holy-terror-at-the-box-office- crossing-300-million-worldwide/https://pop.inquirer.net/62525/nun- amasses-200m-worldwide-p239-8m-ph ===Critical response=== On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 26% based on 193 reviews, and an average rating of 4.43/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The Nun boasts strong performances, spooky atmospherics, and a couple decent set-pieces, but its sins include inconsistent logic and narrative slackness.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale, the lowest of the series. The Plugged In review for the film summarized the spirituality evident in the film: \"Evil is real, the movie tells us, but so is God. Spiritual trappings are everywhere. And when in doubt or danger, you can't go wrong with a little prayer.\" In her review of the film published in the National Catholic Reporter, Sr. Rose Pacatte, a nun belonging to the Daughters of St. Paul, stated \"that there are two Catholic theological aspects of this film that are accurate: one is that the devil exists, and the other is that Mary, the Mother of Jesus, will show us the way.\" Another religious sister, Nicole Reich, stated in her review of the film published on Syfy Wire that if Valak was a real demon, he would never be able to reveal himself while the \"sisters were in perpetual adoration...because the Lord was present\". ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

He stated there was a \"really fun\" storyline planned for the film, and commented that there was an \"inevitability to another The Nun movie\". Later that month, Akela Cooper signed onto the project as screenwriter, while Safran and James Wan will serve as producers. Bonnie Aarons will be reprising her role as Valak, the demon nun. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2018 films Category:2018 horror films Category:2010s ghost films Category:2010s monster movies Category:American films Category:American monster movies Category:American ghost films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:The Conjuring Universe Category:Demons in film Category:English-language films Category:Films about exorcism Category:Films about nuns Category:Films produced by James Wan Category:Films produced by Peter Safran Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in Transylvania Category:Films set in 1952 Category:Films set in 1971 Category:Films shot in Bucharest Category:Films shot in Romania Category:Film spin-offs Category:Gothic horror films Category:IMAX films Category:New Line Cinema films Category:Religious horror films Category:Films with screenplays by Gary Dauberman Category:Films with screenplays by James Wan Category:Warner Bros. films ",
