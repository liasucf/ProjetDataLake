She has released eleven solo albums. Her guitar work and composition style ranges from jaggedly dissonant to traditional folk.

Her father was a professor at Salve Regina University in Newport and her mother a special educational needs teacher. She was interested in music at an early age and wanted to learn guitar chords; as such, her father gave her a guitar when she was nine. Her parents separated when Hersh was eleven, and her mother married the father of her best friend Tanya Donelly. Hersh talked Donelly into starting a band, then called The Muses when they were fourteen.Strauss, Neil (March 9, 1995). \"My So-Called Double Life: Kristin Hersh of Throwing Muses Finds the Common Ground Between Motherhood and Rock & Roll\".

While at Salve, Hersh befriended film actress Betty Hutton, who was attending the school in her sixties; Hutton also attended several early Throwing Muses shows in Newport. The Throwing Muses were signed to 4AD, the first American group to be signed on the British label, and released the EP Chains Changed in 1987. Two releases followed, The Fat Skier and the album House Tornado.

In a 2014 interview, Hersh stated, \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, music is not a commodity. It\u2019s something that people have earned by being human. They have a right to hear it, and a right to share it, as they always have in churches and parties. That\u2019s how music happens.\u201d ===2000 to present=== Hersh at the Bowery Ballroom, New York, 2007 In 2001, Hersh released the Sunny Border Blue solo album, on which she again played nearly all instruments.

In 2003, she released The Grotto, an acoustic solo album of song sketches with personal lyrics set in Providence, Rhode Island, with Andrew Bird on violin and Howe Gelb on piano.

She expressed that she wanted a complete break with the music industry, stating, \"Because we differ from the recording industry ethically, we had been asked to dumb down our product so many times. I have been asked to act and look like a bimbo so many times and I just decided, 'I\u2019m not going to turn my back on my music. I\u2019m not going to turn my back on women.'

She has an occasional vibrato that punctuates some of her more dramatic phrasing. Candid about her episodes of mental illness and despair, her songs cover a vast spectrum of topics, including childbirth (\"Hysterical Bending\"), love (\"Tar Kissers\", \"Lavender\"), surreal vignettes (\"Delicate Cutters\", \"Fish\"), death (\"Limbo\"), emotional anguish (\"The Letter\"), loss of custody of her first son (\"Candyland\"), and the shedding of a relationship's anxiety (\"Snake Oil\"). Simon Reynolds in The New York Times pointed to Hersh's \"mesmerizing\" explorations of \"rage, aggression and mental chaos\" as evidence of female rock artists of the early 1990s pushing against gender role boundaries to express \"more than simply vulnerability or defiance\" in their work. Ann Powers, also in the Times, wrote of Hersh's musical style: \"Her plastic, sometimes obsessively circular song structures emphasize staggered rhythms and extreme dynamic shifts, and her voice, a carnal cry that pushes through her body gathering up air, lends her often oblique lyrics an oracular veneer.\" ===Influences=== Hersh has said her parents' album collections, featuring Patti Smith, the Carter Family, Stevie Wonder, Robert Johnson, Talking Heads, The Clash, Steve Miller, The Beatles, Philip Glass, and traditional music all influenced her when she was growing up. Among her early contemporary musical influences are The Raincoats, The Pretenders, Talking Heads, Violent Femmes, Meat Puppets, Dead Kennedys, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, Velvet Underground, R.E.M., and X. ==Author== Hersh's illustrated children's book Toby Snax was published in 2007 and further developed in 2011 as an interactive app for children.
