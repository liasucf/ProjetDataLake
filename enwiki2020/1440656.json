The name \"tater tot\" is a registered trademark of the American frozen food company Ore-Ida, but is often used as a generic term. \"Tater\" is short for potato. ==History== Tater tots were invented in 1953 when American frozen food company Ore-Ida founders F. Nephi Grigg and Golden Grigg were trying to figure out what to do with leftover slivers of cut-up potatoes.

When the price was raised, people began buying it. Today, Americans consume approximately of tater tots, or 3,710,000,000 tots per year.
