    "text": "Dalby () is a locality and short-lived (11th century) former Latin Catholic diocese situated in Lund Municipality, Sk\u00e5ne County, Sweden with 6732 inhabitants in 2019. It is located about 10 km East-southeast of Lund, and about 20 km East-northeast of Malm\u00f6. Dalby was a municipality up until 1974, when it became part of Lund municipality. Between 1941 and 1954, Dalby was also a municipal urban area (\"municipalsamh\u00e4lle\"). The Dalby S\u00f6derskog national park is situated just northwest of Dalby. The old quarry Stenbrottet is located a couple of kilometres east of Dalby. It's a popular place for swimming and fishing and for couples to become engaged. == Bishopric == Dalby has the oldest stone church in Scandinavia, for which the cathedral in Hildesheim served as a model. In 1060 the Danish King Svend Estridsen initiated the creation of a religious centre in Dalby, and also constructed his royal residence there.https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/8d9a39a7-31aa-4104-9255-ba83059c0caa From 1060, Dalby was a bishopric, on territory split off from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Roskilde, under the bishop Egino, appointed by the German Archbishop Adalbert of Bremen. But as early as 1066 the English anti-bishop Henrik was enthroned in Lund, probably elected by the people and the clergy. In 1085 Canute the Saint decided to build a new cathedral in Lund and in 1104 Lund became the archbishopric over Scandinavia. Another source holds the diocese was established in 1048 and suppressed in 1060. Until the Protestant Reformation in Denmark in 1536, Dalby retained some importance as the site of an Augustinian monastery and a demesne of the Danish Crown. == Famous people == *Nils Grandelius, chess grandmaster *Fredrik \u00d6nnevall, journalist. ==Gallery== File:Dalby (church).JPG|The entrance to the Holy Cross Church File:Dalby Norreskog Nature Reserve, Dalby, Lund, Scania, Sweden - May 2015.jpg|Dalby Norreskog Nature Reserve File:Windmill in Dalby, Sweden.JPG|Windmill in Dalby == References == ==Sources and external links== * GCatholic Category:Populated places in Sk\u00e5ne County Category:Romanesque architecture in Sweden Dalby Category:Former municipalities of Sweden Category:Populated places in Lund Municipality ",
