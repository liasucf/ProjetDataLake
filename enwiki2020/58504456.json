    "text": "Kenny Clarke & Ernie Wilkins is an album by the Kenny Clarke-Ernie Wilkins Septet recorded in 1955 and first released on the Savoy label.Savoy Records Catalog: 12000 series accessed September 17, 2018Discography of the Savoy/Regent and Associated labels accessed September 17, 2018 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow stated: \"Overall this is an excellent outing for all concerned\". On All About Jazz, Marc Myers noted \"By 1955, Wilkins' charts had developed a knack for tightly wound swing and swagger, typically resulting in a polished shout chorus at the end. With Wilkins, every arrangement was an aerodynamic adventure, and he never relied on gimmicks or repeated phrases. His originals always sounded modern--the blues retrofitted with an automatic transmission and air conditioning ... For me, this is a perfect mid-1950s jazz album of seductive beauty crafted for a small group that thinks it's a big band\".Myers, M.
