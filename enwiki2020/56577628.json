    "text": "Aedan: Garden of Desire is a 2018 Indian Malayalam film directed by Sanju Surendran. The film stars Abhilash Nair, George Kurian, Prasant, Nandini Sree, Sunny, Jojo George, and Dileep Kumar. Aedan is more of a folktale in its elemental qualities and evocation of eternal human passions. Following the tradition of Indian epic narration, the structure of the film is that of a story within a story. The stories attempt a microscopic examination of the human psyche. As the story reverses through the emotional universes of the characters, the idyllic landscape of a beautiful Kerala village takes on diabolic dimensions in the night. ==Cast== *Abhilash Nair as Immanuel as Hari *Nandini Sree as Jeevan Raj as Neetu *Prasant M.
