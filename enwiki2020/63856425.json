    "text": "Eriospermum zeyheri is a species of geophytic plant of the genus Eriospermum, indigenous to South Africa. ==Description== The leaf is a rounded heart-shape (100mm x 65mm), and is prostrate, held flat against the ground. Several related species, such as Eriospermum capense, Eriospermum breviscapum and Eriospermum pubescens, have a similar heart-shaped leaf. However, the leaf of E.zeyheri is generally a lighter green above, and not a reddish colour below. It is also always pressed flat against the ground. The irregular-shaped tuber of E.zeyheri is white-ish inside. The pale, greenish-cream-coloured, fragrant, star-shaped flowers appear on a tall, thin inflorescence in December to March. ==Distribution== This species occurs in renosterveld vegetation, in clay soils, across the southern Cape, South Africa, extending from McGregor as far east as the town of Grahamstown.Perry, P.L.
