    "text": "The 1991 Central Michigan Chippewas football team represented Central Michigan University in the Mid-American Conference (MAC) during the 1991 NCAA Division I-A football season. In their 14th season under head coach Herb Deromedi, the Chippewas compiled a 6\u20131\u20134 record (3\u20131\u20134 against MAC opponents), finished in second place in the MAC, and outscored their opponents, 205 to 157. The team's four ties is tied for the NCAA record for most ties in a season.2015 Media Guide, p. 85. The team played its home games in Kelly/Shorts Stadium in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, with attendance of 96,700 in five home games.2015 Media Guide, p. 87. The highlight of the season was a 20\u20133 victory over No. 18 ranked Michigan State at Spartan Stadium on September 14, 1991. Michigan State had been favored by 21-1/2 points, and coach Deromedi called it the biggest win in school history. On the opening drive, Michigan State quickly took the ball to the goal line. On fourth down from the one-yard line, Michigan State opted to go for the touchdown rather than kick a field goal. Chippewa linebacker Doug Adler stopped Tico Duckett for no gain, and the goal-line stand was reported to be an inspirational moment for the Chippewas. Adler called the top \"the biggest play I ever made.\" Later in the first quarter, Central Michigan tailback Billy Smith scored on a 15-yard run. The Chippewas expanded their lead in the second quarter on a 57-yard touchdown pass from Jeff Bender to Ken Ealy and led 14\u20133 at halftime. Chuck Selinger also kicked two field goals in the second half for Central Michigan. Billy Smith rushed for 162 yards on 40 carries in the game. The team's statistical leaders included quarterback Jeff Bender with 1,754 passing yards, tailback Billy Smith with 1,440 rushing yards, and flanker Ken Ealy with 724 receiving yards. Smith's 374 rushing attempts in 1991 remains a single season record at Central Michigan, and his 1,440 rushing yards was the third highest single season total in school history up to that time.2015 Media Guide, p. 81. Smith received the team's most valuable player award and was selected as a first- team All-MAC player.2015 Media Guide, pp 92, 95. Other Central Michigan players to receive first-team All-MAC honors were offensive tackle Jim Wyatt and defensive tackle Mike Nettie.2015 Media Guide, p. 92. Nettie had nine sacks in 1991, which was at the time tied for the school's single season record.2015 Media Guide, p. 82. ==Schedule== ==References== Central Michigan Category:Central Michigan Chippewas football seasons Central Michigan Chippewas football ",
