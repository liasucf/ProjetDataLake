    "text": "Peter Bjur (; born 2 February 2000) is a Danish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Danish Superliga club Br\u00f8ndby IF. He has represented Denmark at youth level. He is the son of former Danish international and Br\u00f8ndby legend Ole Bjur. == Early life == Peter Bjur was born in R\u00f8dovre, a suburb of Copenhagen. His father, Ole Bjur, is a former professional player for Br\u00f8ndby IF and the Denmark national team. He also has a mother and a sister, with whom he has lived in R\u00f8dovre his entire life. His uncle, Jan Bjur, is also a former professional footballer. == Club career == === Early career === Bjur began his career at BK Avarta, having his first practice the day after turning five years old. He played in Avarta for several years before moving to B.93 as an under-15 player. He made his senior-team debut as a seventeen-year-old on 1 March 2017, coming on as a 35th-minute substitute in a 3\u20130 loss to Danish Superliga club F.C. Copenhagen in the Danish Cup round of 16 at Parken Stadium. === Br\u00f8ndby === ==== 2017\u201320 ==== On 1 July 2017, Bjur signed a three-year contract with Br\u00f8ndby IF and joined the club on under-17 level. On 15 August 2019, he made his first team debut as a 73rd-minute substitute for Simon Hedlund against Portuguese opposition Braga in Br\u00f8ndby's UEFA Europa League play-offs, scoring an 85th-minute goal. A few days later, on 18 August, Bjur made his Danish Superliga debut coming on as a second-half substitute against AaB. As the summer transfer window closed, the club stated that they did not want to loan out Bjur, despite the squad being too large. On 13 December, he signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract with Br\u00f8ndby, running until 2023. He made his only second league appearance for the club on 5 July 2020, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 0-2 loss to AaB in the Superliga. ==== 2020\u201321 ==== Prior to the 2020\u201321 season, in pre-season friendlies against N\u00e6stved Boldklub, FC Helsing\u00f8r, OB and English side Crystal Palace, Bjur was utilised at the left wing-back position. On his positional change, he stated: \"Of course, moving down and playing on the wing-back is a bit of an upheaval. But many of the skills I have previously used on the right wing are some of the same things that recur on the wingback\". Head coach Niels Frederiksen subsequently praised Bjur's performances on the new position. On 13 September, on the first match-day of the new season, Bjur made his first start for Br\u00f8ndby at the left wing-back position in a 3-2 home win over Nordsj\u00e6lland. == International career == Bjur has won 2 caps for Denmark at U17 and U18 level. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"3\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\"|B.93 |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"1\"|Danish 2nd Divisions |14||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||15||2 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total !14!!2!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!15!!2 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Br\u00f8ndby IF |2019\u201320 |rowspan=\"2\"|Danish Superliga |3||0||0||0||1||1||4||1 |- |2020\u201321 |3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total !6!!0!!0!!0!!1!!1!!7!!1 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !20!!2!!1!!0!!1!!1!!22!!3 |} *(-) Not qualified == References == == External links == * * Peter Bjur at brondby.com * Peter Bjur at dbu.dk Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:People from R\u00f8dovre Category:BK Avarta players Category:Boldklubben af 1893 players Category:Br\u00f8ndby IF players Category:Danish footballers Category:Denmark youth international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Danish Superliga players Category:Sportspeople from Copenhagen ",
