    "text": "In the analytic theory of continued fractions, a chain sequence is an infinite sequence {an} of non-negative real numbers chained together with another sequence {gn} of non-negative real numbers by the equations : a_1 = (1-g_0)g_1 \\quad a_2 = (1-g_1)g_2 \\quad a_n = (1-g_{n-1})g_n where either (a) 0 \u2264 gn < 1, or (b) 0 < gn \u2264 1\\. Chain sequences arise in the study of the convergence problem - both in connection with the parabola theorem, and also as part of the theory of positive definite continued fractions. The infinite continued fraction of Worpitzky's theorem contains a chain sequence. A closely related theoremWall traces this result back to Oskar Perron (Wall, 1948, p. 48). shows that : f(z) = \\cfrac{a_1z}{1 + \\cfrac{a_2z}{1 + \\cfrac{a_3z}{1 + \\cfrac{a_4z}{\\ddots}}}} \\, converges uniformly on the closed unit disk |z| \u2264 1 if the coefficients {an} are a chain sequence. ==An example== The sequence {\u00bc, \u00bc, \u00bc, ...} appears as a limiting case in the statement of Worpitzky's theorem. Since this sequence is generated by setting g0 = g1 = g2 = ... = \u00bd, it is clearly a chain sequence. This sequence has two important properties. *Since f(x) = x \u2212 x2 is a maximum when x = \u00bd, this example is the \"biggest\" chain sequence that can be generated with a single generating element; or, more precisely, if {gn} = {x}, and x < \u00bd, the resulting sequence {an} will be an endless repetition of a real number y that is less than \u00bc. *The choice gn = \u00bd is not the only set of generators for this particular chain sequence. Notice that setting :: g_0 = 0 \\quad g_1 = {\\textstyle\\frac{1}{4}} \\quad g_2 = {\\textstyle\\frac{1}{3}} \\quad g_3 = {\\textstyle\\frac{3}{8}} \\;\\dots :generates the same unending sequence {\u00bc, \u00bc, \u00bc, ...}. ==Notes== ==References== *H.
