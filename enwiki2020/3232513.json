    "text": "Flush is a young adult novel by Carl Hiaasen first published in 2005, and set in Hiaasen's native Florida. It is his second young adult novel, after Hoot. The plot is similar to that of Hoot but it doesn't have the same cast and is not a continuation/sequel. The plot centers around Noah Underwood, a boy whose father enlists his help to catch a repeat environmental offender in the act. Noah Underwood\u2019s Dad failed to prove that the Coral Queen was dumping their waste in Thunder Beach. So Noah and his sister Abbey will find a way to tell the community about the Coral Queen's secret. == Plot == A young kid named Noah Underwood was obsessed with a social media star named G3NIUS, and once him and his favorite social media star actually met at a festival, they had bigger problems on their hands. A person named Dusty Muleman was dumping waste in the ocean, and they were the only ones who figured it out. Now they needed to prove Dusty Muleman, owner of a casino boat named the Coral Queen, was a fraud. ==References to actual history, science, and current events== *Noah says his sister is named after \"one of Dad's favorite writers, some weird old bird who's buried out west in the middle of a desert.\" This is a clear reference to Edward Abbey, the author of The Monkey Wrench Gang, often cited as an inspirational work by radical environmentalists.
