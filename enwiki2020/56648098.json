The Deputy Principal had monitored her email. The Deputy then insinuated to other staff that she was in a personal relationship with another employee. The UK claimed the College could monitor Copland\u2019s emails and use of the internet. The college\u2019s statutory powers enabled it to do \u2018anything necessary or expedient for the purposes of providing higher or further education\u2019. \u2018The applicant also believed that there had been detailed and comprehensive logging of the length of calls, the number of calls received and made and the telephone numbers of individuals calling her. She stated that on at least one occasion the DP became aware of the name of an individual with whom she had exchanged incoming and outgoing telephone calls.\u2019 An internet \u2018monitoring took the form of analysing the web sites visited, the times and dates of the visits to the web sites and their duration and that this monitoring took place from October to November 1999.\u2019 She claimed this violated her right to private life and correspondence under ECHR article 8. ==Judgment== The European Court of Human Rights held an implied right to monitor internet \u2018unpersuasive\u2019. ==See also== *United Kingdom labour law *English contract case law ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * Category:English contract case law Category:United Kingdom labour case law ",
