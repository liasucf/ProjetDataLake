    "text": "Sweet Polly Oliver is an English broadside ballad (Roud #367), traceable from 1840 or earlier. It is also known as \"Pretty Polly Oliver\" and has several variant sets of lyrics, set to a single anonymous melody. It is one of the best known of a number of folk songs describing women disguising themselves as men to join the army to be with their lovers. Thomas Root wrote a symphonic band arrangement and Benjamin Britten wrote an arrangement for voice and piano. ==Lyrics== : As sweet Polly Oliver lay musing in bed, : A sudden strange fancy came into her head. : \"Nor father nor mother shall make me false prove, : I'll 'list as a soldier, and follow my love.\" : So early next morning she softly arose, : And dressed herself up in her dead brother's clothes. : She cut her hair close, and she stained her face brown, : And went for a soldier to fair London Town. : Then up spoke the sergeant one day at his drill, : \"Now who's good for nursing? A captain, he's ill.\" : \"I'm ready,\" said Polly. To nurse him she's gone, : And finds it's her true love all wasted and wan. : The first week the doctor kept shaking his head, : \"No nursing, young fellow, can save him,\" he said. : But when Polly Oliver had nursed him back to life : He cried, \"You have cherished him as if you were his wife\". : O then Polly Oliver, she burst into tears : And told the good doctor her hopes and her fears, : And very shortly after, for better or for worse, : The captain took joyfully his pretty soldier nurse. ==References== The main theme of Terry Pratchett\u2019s book, Monstrous Regiment, in which a young woman named Polly, who has heard the song sung in her father's inn, joins the army (as a man) to find her brother, taking the name Oliver. ==External links== Several versions of \"Polly Oliver\" survive as undated broadside ballad sheets in the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford. http://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/view/edition/4134 Category:English folk songs Category:Songs about fictional female characters Category:Female wartime cross-dressers Oliver, Polly Category:Year of song unknown Category:Roud Folk Song Index songs ",
