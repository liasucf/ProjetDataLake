    "text": "The Spanish city of Bilbao contains a dense urban rail network served by multiple operators, track gauges and types. It currently consists of thirteen lines, counting those of metro and tram as well as suburban rail; complemented by a wide-covering bus network, as well as other means of transportation including funiculars. The services are offered by different companies, whose activity is coordinated by the Consorcio de Transportes de Bizkaia (Transport Consortium of Bizkaia), which integrates their respective operators and facilitates and encourages their use. The three major operators of the rail transport network are Metro Bilbao (2 lines), Euskotren (5 lines of Euskotren Trena and 1 of Euskotren Tranbia) and Renfe (3 lines of Cercan\u00edas Bilbao and 2 of Renfe Feve). The lines converge in the capital and reach six of the seven regions of the province: Arratia-Nervi\u00f3n, Busturialdea-Urdaibai, Duranguesado, Gran Bilbao, Las Encartaciones and Uribe. Thus, the only region without rail lines is Lea-Artibai. Areas that lack rail service are serve s by Bizkaibus.
