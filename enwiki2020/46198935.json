However, when Leo and Neil remove a tree stump from Leo's garden they find an underground lake under all London which expands to flood the entire world. Leo makes a raft from their living room and as they float they meet the wife of the man who abused Neil. ==Productions== Rafts and Dreams was first presented at the Royal Court Theatre in 1990.
