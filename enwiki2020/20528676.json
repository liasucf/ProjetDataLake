The oral of \u03b5-amanitin is approximately 0.1 mg/kg. == Toxicology == Like other amatoxins, \u03b5-amanitin is an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II. Upon ingestion, it binds to the RNA polymerase II enzyme which completely prevents mRNA synthesis, effectively causing cytolysis of hepatocytes (liver cells) and kidney cells. == See also == * Mushroom poisoning == References == == External links == *Amatoxins REVISED *Poisonous Mushrooms (German) Category:Cyclic peptides Category:Amatoxins Category:Hepatotoxins Category:Tryptamines ",
