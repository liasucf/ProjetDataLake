However, he is disappointed with the extremism in the Palestinian camp, saying, \"Radical Palestinians still say that the only solution would be for all Jews to pack their bags and return to where their grandparents came from. When there are no more Jews left in the Middle East, then the problem is solved, according to their logic. As long as they continue to think that way, there will be no peace. We are here and we are going to stay. Only after that fact is generally accepted can progress be made.\"Israeli author Meir Shalev: Even the left was in favor of striking Hamas, Der Spiegel, 2 January 2009, retrieved 15 April 2020 == Awards and recognition== * Bernstein Prize (original Hebrew novel category) (1989)Meir Shalev Tel Aviv University accessed 14 July 2011 * Brenner Prize (Israel) for A Pigeon and a Boy *National Jewish Book Award for A Pigeon and a Boy (2007) * Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, along with Michal Govrin, in 2018 == Published works == === Fiction === * 1988 The Blue Mountain (1988, originally published in Hebrew as Roman Rusi) English translation in 1991 by Hillel Halkin.
