They lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle governed by traditional laws, which had their origins in the Dreamtime. Their homes were bark huts called 'gunyahs'. They hunted kangaroos and emus for meat, and gathered yams, berries and other native plants. Shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in Australia in 1788, an outbreak of smallpox decimated the local indigenous communities and made it easier for settlers to dispossess them of their land. ===European settlement=== The first land grant in the area was made to Samuel Terry in 1818. He named the area Terry Brook. By the 1860s it was known as Llandilo after a Welsh town.
