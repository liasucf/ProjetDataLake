    "text": "Sabresuchus is an extinct genus of neosuchian crocodyliform from the Cretaceous of Europe. The name is derived from 'Sabre' in reference to the enlarged and curved fifth maxillary tooth, and 'suchus' from the Ancient Greek for crocodile. ==Taxonomy== Two valid species are currently recognized: Sabresuchus ibericus from eastern Spain, and Sabresuchus symplesiodon from Romania,. Both species were previously assigned under the genus Theriosuchus, as T. ibericus and T. symplesiodon respectively. A 2016 cladistic analysis recovered it as a neosuchian more closely related to members of the family Paralligatoridae than to atoposaurids. ==References== Category:Neosuchians Category:Crocodyliforms Category:Cretaceous Romania Category:Fossils of Romania Category:Cretaceous Spain Category:Fossils of Spain Category:La Hu\u00e9rguina Formation Category:Fossil taxa described in 2016 ",
