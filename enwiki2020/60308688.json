Four pots will be used for the draw with teams seeded according to their previous performance in the 2017 Southeast Asian Games. Defending champions Thailand and hosts Philippines are seeded in Pot 1. The Vietnam Football Federation filed a complaint regarding the seeding of the Vietnam national team in Pot 4 for the men's football tournament questioning the fact that their national team, who collected ten points in the group stage of the 2017 edition of the games, was seeded lower than the two teams who collected less points and were seeded Pot 3 (Myanmar with nine points and Singapore with six points). Vietnam was later elevated to Pot 3 and Singapore was relegated to Pot 4. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\" |- !width=25%|Pot 1 !width=25%|Pot 2 !width=25%|Pot 3 !width=25%|Pot 4 |- | ' ' | | | |} ==Officials== Referees * Ismaeel Habib Ali (Bahrain) * Chen Hsin-chuan (Chinese Taipei) * C.
