    "text": "David Morgan (born 12 May 1721 Christiana, New Castle, Delaware died 19 May 1813) \"The Indian Fighter\" was a notable soldier and frontiersman in what is now the state of West Virginia. He was the third child of Morgan Morgan and Catherine Garretson Morgan, traditionally stated to be the first white settler in West Virginia. Family tradition claims he was a friend of George Washington and Patrick Henry. Morgan was hired to help George Washington to survey the lands of Lord Fairfax's Virginia land holdings in 1746 and establish the northern border of Fairfax estate. This boundary became the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania. A monument placed at the northern branch of the Potomac River is known as Fairfax Stone. Morgan participated in many battles of the Revolutionary War and helped defend Fort Duquesne. A younger brother Zackquill (Zackwell) Morgan founded Morgantown, West Virginia which is the town where West Virginia University is located. In 1745, Morgan built a log cabin at Bunker Hill, Frederick (now Berkeley) County, (West) Virginia. (This structure was later expanded and became the Morgan-Gold House; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.) In 1772, he moved to Marion County, (West) Virginia. Morgan is the 3rd great grandfather of West Virginia Governor Ephraim F. Morgan (1869\u20131950) and Congressman William S. Morgan (1801\u20131878). ==Military Service== ===French and Indian War=== During the French and Indian War, David fought under the command of Captain Charles Lewis.
