The most notable sports team for Carleton is the men's basketball team. In men's basketball, the Ravens have won 15 of the last 18 national men's championships, more than any top division college in Canada or the United States.Peter Gross, sports report, March 13, 2017, CFTR 680 News, Toronto The Ravens went on an 87-game winning streak from 2003 to 2006. They also had a 54-game home winning streak. The Ravens finished 2nd in the World University Basketball Championships in 2004.

The Men's Hockey team also placed 3rd in the province and made an appearance at nationals. Carleton participates in the Ontario University Athletics (OUA) Conference for all varsity sports, except the Women's Hockey and Rugby teams who play in Quebec Student Sport Federation (RSEQ). == Rivalry with the Gee-Gees == Carleton's biggest rivals are the Ottawa Gee-Gees of the University of Ottawa. An annual football game, known as the Panda Game is played between the cross-town rivals. It is the most well known rivalry game in Canadian collegiate football . Since its inception in 1955, the Gee-Gees have won 33 to Carleton's 13. From 1998 to 2012, Carleton did not have a football program so the Panda Game was not held. Today, the rivalry is also extremely heated between the schools' basketball teams, as both universities have men's and women's teams that finish near the top of the standings. On January 23, 2007, the two men's basketball teams faced off at Scotiabank Place, now known as Canadian Tire Centre, in front of nearly 9,720 spectators, which was a record crowd for a regular season U Sports basketball game. The Ottawa Gee-Gees won the inaugural event 64\u201362. The event, now known as the Capital Hoops Classic, has been expanded to include the women's teams as well, with the Classic featuring a doubleheader of both teams. The January 28, 2009 edition of the game broke the 2007 record with 10,523 fans attending the two games, with both of Carleton's teams posting victories over Ottawa.Carleton hosts Ottawa in 5th Capital Hoops Classic In the 2013\u201314 season the teams faced each other both in the provincial and national finals, with uOttawa winning the OUA championship and Carleton winning the national title. In 2014-15, the two teams also faced off in national championship games, with Carleton once again winning. == Teams == * men's basketball * women's basketball * fencing *Carleton Ravens football * golf * men's hockey * women's hockey * nordic skiing * rowing * women's rugby * men's soccer * women's soccer * swimming * men's water polo * women's water polo. * 15 club sports: http://goravens.ca/clubs/ == Men's basketball == The Ravens have won 15 of the last 18 national championships (2003 to 2007, 2009, 2011 to 2017, 2019, 2020).
