    "text": "Eadric (\u00c6dric) (fl. 942-949) was a tenth-century ealdorman of Wessex. He was the youngest of four sons of \u00c6thelfrith, an ealdorman in Mercia, and his wife \u00c6thelgyth. From 946 until his death in 949 Eadric was the second most senior ealdorman in England, surpassed only by his brother \u00c6thelstan Half-King. ==Biography== Eadric was born to \u00c6thelfrith, an ealdorman who ruled territory in southern and eastern Mercia, and his wife \u00c6thelgyth, who came from a family with considerable wealth that owned land in Buckinghamshire. Eadric was the youngest of four brothers, the other three being \u00c6lfstan, \u00c6thelstan Half-King, and \u00c6thelwold, all four of whom were made ealdormen between 925 and 950.Hart 2004 \u00c6lfstan, the eldest brother, succeeded to his father's ealdordom upon the death of his father around 915, though he died in 934. \u00c6thelstan Half-King was made Ealdorman of East Anglia in 932, though his jurisdiction also included Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, Huntingdonshire and parts of Lincolnshire. \u00c6thelwold was granted an ealdordom in 940, ruling over Kent and neighbouring counties including Essex. Eadric was the last of the four brothers to be granted an ealdordom, ruling over central Wessex from 942 onwards.Woolf, p. 182 He succeeded a man named \u00c6lfhere as ealdorman.Hart 1973, p. 108 By about 945 Eadric and his two surviving brothers between them controlled over half the kingdom.Lapidge et al., p. 58 Beginning in 943 \u00c6thelstan is listed first among the king's ealdormen when witnessing charters, indicating his premier position. \u00c6thelwold is listed second and Eadric is listed between third and sixth depending on the particular charter. \u00c6thelwold died in 946, leaving land in Sussex and on the Berkshire Downs to Eadric. A later charter by King Eadred details land at these same two places to be given to Eadric, though it is not known whether this refers to new land or is simply of a confirmation of the land left to Eadric by his brother. Following \u00c6thelwold's death Eadric is listed second only to his brother \u00c6thelstan when witnessing royal charters. Eadric died in 949 and was succeeded as ealdorman by \u00c6thelsige. It is possible that Eadric was the father of \u00c6thelweard (historian), if true then he had at least four children, the others being \u00c6thelweard's siblings \u00c6lfweard, \u00c6lfgifu and \u00c6lfwaru. This identification rests on \u00c6lfgifu's possession of the estate of Risborough, which had belonged to Eadric's mother, \u00c6thelgyth. \u00c6lfgifu is often identified with \u00c6lfgifu, wife of Eadwig, and that queen's documented mother, \u00c6thelgifu, would then be Eadric's wife. ==Notes== ==Citations== ==Sources== * * Subscription or UK public library membership required. * * ==External links== * Category:Anglo-Saxon ealdormen Category:9th-century English people Category:Year of birth unknown Category:949 deaths ",
