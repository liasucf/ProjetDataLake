Article - Ecorcheurs They were mercenaries without employment since the Treaty of Arras which ended disputes between the Armagnacs and Burgundians in 1435. Rodrigo de Villandrando was known as the \"Emperor of Pillagers\" (empereur des brigands) and \"L'\u00c9corcheur\" (the slaughterer). ==History== From the mid-14th century the French royal forces, whether voluntary or semonc\u00e9es had become institutionalized.Philippe Contamine, La Guerre au Moyen \u00c2ge, Nouvelle Clio, Puf The permanence of conflicts during the Hundred Years War (1337-1453) had created career soldiers, paid by the king or nobles. These were not mercenaries, as their vassals and clientelistic ties remained parallel to their economic interest in war.Philippe Contamine, Guerre, \u00c9tat et soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin du Moyen \u00c2ge. \u00c9tudes sur les arm\u00e9es des rois de France (1337-1494), vol. 1 et 2, Paris, \u00c9ditions de l'\u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), coll. \u00ab R\u00e9-impressions \u00bb, 2004 (1re \u00e9d. 1972), p450 & p334. During times of peace or truce, these unemployed warriors gathered in bands and lived on pillage and ransoms. In the 14th century, after the Peace of Br\u00e9tigny- Calais (1360), large armies of mercenaries armies were disbanded, on occasion without receiving their pay. Those who did not have the financial means to go home or wanted to continue their martial lifestyle, which was highly profitable, then formed autonomous bands of the road which exert pressure on the regions of France.Boris Bove, Le temps de la guerre de Cent ans : 1328-1453, (Paris, Belin, coll. \u00ab Histoire de France \u00bb, 2009), Vol1&2 p669. These were the Great Companies (not be confused with the Grandes companies, which are rather the result of political instability in fifteenth century France and were mercenaries in the strict sense). ==See also == *Routiers *White Company *Free company ==References== Category:Mercenary units and formations of the Middle Ages Category:Military terminology Category:People of the Hundred Years' War Category:Military units and formations of the Hundred Years' War Category:15th-century military history of France ",
