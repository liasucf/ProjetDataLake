    "text": "Shiv Sadan is a large farm and spiritual community in Uttar Pradesh, India, on the shores of the Ganges. At the time of its development in the late 1980s by Sikh spiritual leader Baba Virsa Singh Ji (Babaji), no one believed that such an area could be farmed successfully. The area was a sandy, alkaline, treeless wasteland prone to flooding, and had been condemned by the Indian government. Prior to the arrival of Babaji and his devoted followers there existed no roads, electricity, telephones, nor schools or healthcare services. Currently Shiv Sadan is one of the most productive farms in India, with its major crops consisting of wheat, rice, sugarcane, oilseeds, and a variety of vegetables grown for seed production. The living area consists of a guest complex, offices, havans (eternal sacred fires), and a Darbar Sahib, which houses the Sikh scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib. Sadan, Shiv ",
