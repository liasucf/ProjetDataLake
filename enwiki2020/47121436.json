He inherited a coal mining business from his father and built a business empire with over 94 companies, including the Greenbrier, a luxury resort. In 2015, Justice announced his candidacy for governor in the 2016 West Virginia gubernatorial election. Although Justice was a registered Republican before running for governor, he ran as a Democrat and defeated the Republican nominee, Bill Cole. Less than seven months after taking office, Justice switched back to the Republican Party after announcing his plans at a rally with U.S. president Donald Trump in the state. ==Early life and education== James Conley Justice II was born in Charleston, the son of James Conley Justice and Edna Ruth (n\u00e9e Perry) Justice.

Justice founded Bluestone Farms in 1977, which now operates of farmland, and is the leading producer of grain on the East Coast of the United States. During that time, he also developed Stoney Brook Plantation, a 15,000-acre hunting and fishing preserve in Monroe County. Justice is a seven- time national corn growing champion. After the death of his father in 1993, Justice inherited ownership of Bluestone Industries and Bluestone Coal Corporation. In 2009, he sold some of his coal business to the Russian company Mechel for $568 million. In 2015, after a huge drop in the price of coal which led Mechel to close some of the mines, he bought the business back for just $5 million. Since buying back the mine from Mechel, Justice re-opened several of the mines and hired over 200 coal miners. Justice's mining companies have been under the spotlight for alleged cases of safety violation and unpaid taxes; in 2016, NPR called him the \"top mine safety delinquent\" in the United States. Justice allegedly owed millions of dollars to the government in back taxes, and unpaid coal mining fees and fines: \"His mining companies owe $15 million in six states, including property and minerals taxes, state coal severance and withholding taxes, and federal income, excise and unemployment taxes, as well as mine safety penalties, according to county, state and federal records.\"Two debt-related lawsuits were settled in 2019, and in 2020 mining companies owned by Justice or his family agreed to pay $5 million in delinquent safety fines.Companies Tied To W.Va.

Justice National Scout Camp at The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve, $5 million for Marshall University, and $10 million to the Cleveland Clinic. Justice gives away more than $1 million in Christmas gifts annually through the Dream Tree for Kids campaign. Before taking office as governor, Justice resigned from all the executive positions he held at his business. He placed his daughter Jill in charge of the Greenbrier and his son Jay in charge of his mining and agriculture businesses. He has said he will place all his assets in a blind trust, but that the process will take time because of their complexity. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Justice and his family's businesses received at least between $11 million and $24 million in aid through the Paycheck Protection Program. His luxury resort, the Greenbrier Hotel Corporation, received a loan of between $5 million and $10 million, but the company did not promise to retain any jobs in exchange for the aid. As Governor of West Virginia, he is in charge of the state agencies that regulate many of his businesses. ==Political career== Jim and Cathy Justice meeting Vice President Mike Pence in March 2017 In 2015, Justice declared his candidacy for Governor of West Virginia in the 2016 election as a member of the Democratic Party.

To improve West Virginia's budget situation, he has proposed raising the state's revenue by $450 million, primarily by increasing the consumer sales tax, reinstituting the business and occupation (B & O) tax, and establishing a \"rich man's\" tax. He also opposed plans to cut health and education spending. On April 13, 2017, while vetoing a budget bill passed by the Republican-controlled West Virginia Legislature, Justice said the bill was \"nothing more than a bunch of political you-know-what\" and showed a prop featuring bull feces on a print copy of the bill. On August 3, 2017, Justice announced that he had rejoined the Republican Party. He made the announcement at a Donald Trump rally in Huntington and also confirmed his support for the sitting president. Justice said that he was returning to the GOP because he could not support President Trump as a member of the Democratic Party. The announcement came as a surprise to his own staff. This also made Justice the first Republican governor of West Virginia since Cecil Underwood in 2001. Even after switching to the Republican Party, Justice initially supported incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin for his reelection campaign in the 2018 Senate election in West Virginia. However, later in the general election, Justice endorsed Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey. ===Tenure=== ====Political positions==== Justice began his gubernatorial campaign and political career as a conservative Democrat.

He also signed a bill legalizing hunting on Sundays on private land. =====Healthcare===== Justice supports West Virginia's Medicaid expansion, which was implemented by the previous governor under provisions of the Affordable Care Act. =====LGBTQ rights===== Justice stated that he respects the Supreme Court's decision on Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, and that it is settled law. In 2017, Justice opposed a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to LGBTQ customers. =====Environmental policy===== According to the Charleston Gazette\u2013Mail, Justice has equivocated on the scientific consensus on global warming. In a 2016 interview with the paper, he said: \"There's documentation that would give one concern, and I don't think you should ignore that\", he said. \"At the same time, I think there's an awful lot of research that still should be done. [...] I surely wouldn't sit here and say I am a believer in global warming, but I wouldn't sit here and say that I am not concerned.\" ==Personal life== Justice met his wife, Cathy (n\u00e9e Comer) in high school.

He is being sued about his residency by state house assistant minority whip Isaac Sponaugle, on the basis that Justice is not actually living in the West Virginia Governor's Mansion in Charleston. The state constitution requires the governor to \"reside at the seat of government\", Charleston. The lawsuit is now before the West Virginia State Supreme Court. ===Youth sports=== Since 1992, Justice has been president of Beckley Little League. His participation has helped the program expand to over 1,000 children playing on 80 teams. Having lived in Lewisburg since 2001, he has been the girls basketball coach at Greenbrier East High School since 2003, having won the state championship in 2012. In 2011, he also became the head coach for the boys basketball teams, a position from which he stepped down in September 2017. He was the only coach at the AAA level (the state's largest classification) who coached both the girls and boys basketball teams. Justice stated that though he will place his business interests in a blind trust upon becoming governor, he will still coach basketball while serving. In discussing the coaching position, Justice said, \"There are three things I know that I can do, and that's shoot a shotgun, make a deal and coach basketball. I'm excited about it.\" ==Electoral history== ==See also== * List of American politicians who switched parties in office * List of richest American politicians * Party switching in the United States ==References== ==External links== * Governor of West Virginia official government website * * \"Jim Justice\" article in The West Virginia Encyclopedia * Poll Numbers on Jim Justice * |- |- |- |- |- Category:1951 births Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:21st-century American businesspeople Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American billionaires Category:American business executives Category:American businesspeople in the coal industry Category:American male golfers Category:American philanthropists Category:Businesspeople from West Virginia Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:Golfers from West Virginia Category:Governors of West Virginia Category:High school basketball coaches in West Virginia Category:Living people Category:Marshall Thundering Herd men's golfers Category:Marshall University alumni Category:People from Lewisburg, West Virginia Category:Republican Party state governors of the United States Category:Tennessee Volunteers men's golfers Category:West Virginia Democrats Category:West Virginia Republicans ",
