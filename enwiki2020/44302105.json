    "text": "The 2015\u201316 DFB-Pokal was the 73rd season of the annual German football cup competition. Sixty-four teams participated in the competition, including all teams from the previous year's Bundesliga and the 2. Bundesliga. It began on 7 August 2015 with the first of six rounds and ended on 21 May 2016 with the final at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, a nominally neutral venue, which has hosted the final since 1985. The DFB-Pokal is considered the second-most important club title in German football after the Bundesliga championship. The DFB-Pokal is run by the German Football Association (DFB). The defending champions were Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg, after they beat Borussia Dortmund 3\u20131 in the previous final on 30 May 2015. They were knocked out of the competition in the second round by record title-holders Bayern Munich, losing 1\u20133. The Bavarians ultimately progressed to the final where it defeated Borussia Dortmund 4\u20133 on penalties, as the match finished 0\u20130 after extra time, to win their eighteenth title, and third in four years. The winner of the DFB-Pokal earns automatic qualification to the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League group stages. However, as Bayern Munich already qualified for the UEFA Champions League via their league position, Mainz 05, the sixth placed team in the 2015\u201316 Bundesliga took this Europa League place, and Mainz's Europa League third qualifying round spot went to Hertha BSC. As Bayern Munich won the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal, completing a double, Borussia Dortmund, the runners-up of the Bundesliga will host the 2016 DFL-Supercup. ==Participating clubs== The following 64 teams qualified for the competition: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background-color:#d6e2b3; text-align:center; vertical-align:top\" | style=\"width:33%\" | Bundesliga the 18 teams of the 2014\u201315 season | style=\"width:33%\" | 2.

The 36 teams of the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, along with the top 4 finishers of the 3. Liga were automatically qualified for the tournament. Of the remaining slots, 21 were given to the cup winners of the regional football associations, the Verbandspokal. The 3 remaining slots were given to the three regional associations with the most men's teams, which at the rime were Bavaria, Lower Saxony, and Westphalia. The runner-up of the cup for Lower Saxony was given the slot. The best amateur team of the Regionalliga Bayern and Oberliga Westfalen were given the slot for Bavaria and Westphalia, respectively. As every team was entitled to participate in local tournaments which qualified for the association cups, every team could in principle compete in the DFB- Pokal. Reserve teams were not permitted to enter. No two teams of the same association or corporation could participate in the DFB-Pokal. ===Draw=== The draws for the different rounds were conducted as following: For the first round, the participating teams were split into two pots of 32 teams each. The first pot contained all teams which had qualified through their regional cup competitions, the best four teams of the 3. Liga, and the bottom four teams of the 2. Bundesliga. Every team from this pot was drawn to a team from the second pot, which contained all remaining professional teams (all the teams of the Bundesliga and the remaining fourteen 2. Bundesliga teams). The teams from the first pot were set as the home team in the process. The two-pot scenario also applied for the second round, with the remaining 3. Liga and/or amateur team(s) in the first pot and the remaining Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga teams in the other pot. Once again, the 3. Liga and/or amateur team(s) served as hosts. This time the pots did not have to be of equal size though, depending on the results of the first round. Theoretically, it was even possible that there could be only one pot, if all of the teams from one of the pots from the first round beat all the others in the second pot. Once one pot was empty, the remaining pairings were drawn from the other pot with the first-drawn team for a match serving as hosts. For the remaining rounds other than the final, the draw was conducted from just one pot. Any remaining 3. Liga and/or amateur team(s) were the home team if drawn against a professional team. In every other case, the first-drawn team served as hosts. ===Match rules=== Teams met in one game per round. A match took place for 90 minutes, with two halves of 45 minutes. If still tied after regulation, 30 minutes of extra time were played, consisting of two periods of 15 minutes. If the score was still level after this, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. A coin toss decided who took the first penalty. ===Cards=== If a player received five yellow cards, even throughout multiple seasons, he was then banned from the next cup match. If a player received a second yellow card, they were banned from the next cup match. If a player received a red card, they were banned a minimum of one match, but more could be added by the German Football Association. ===Champion qualification=== The winner of the DFB-Pokal earns automatic qualification for the group stage of next year's edition of the UEFA Europa League. As winners Bayern Munich had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League by winning the Bundesliga, the spot went to the team in sixth, Mainz 05, and the league's second qualifying round spot went to the team in seventh, Hertha BSC. As Bayern won both the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal, completing a double, the runner-up of the Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund, hosted the 2016 DFL-Supercup at the start of the next season. ==Schedule== The Olympiastadion in Berlin hosted the final.
