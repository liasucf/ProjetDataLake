    "text": "Yuzu (Citrus junos, from Japanese or ) is a citrus fruit and plant in the family Rutaceae of East Asian origin. It is believed to have originated in central China as a hybrid of mandarin orange and the ichang papeda. The yuzu is called yuja (from Korean ) in Korean cuisine. Both Japanese yuzu and Korean yuja are borrowings of the Chinese y\u00f2uzi (), though this Chinese word now refers to the pomelo. == Description == The fruit looks somewhat like a small grapefruit with an uneven skin, and can be either yellow or green depending on the degree of ripeness. Yuzu fruits, which are very aromatic, typically range between 5.5cm (2.16in) and 7.5cm (2.95in) in diameter, but can be as large as a regular grapefruit (up to 10cm (3.93in) or larger). Yuzu forms an upright shrub or small tree, which commonly has many large thorns. Leaves are notable for a large, leaf-like petiole, resembling those of the related kaffir lime and ichang papeda, and are heavily scented. Yuzu closely resembles sudachi (Citrus sudachi, a Japanese citrus from Tokushima Prefecture, a yuzu\u2013mandarin orange cross) in many regards, though unlike the sudachi, yuzu eventually ripen to an orange colour and there are subtle differences between the flavours of the fruit.

File:Yuzuandmandarine.JPG|Yuzu (left) compared to mandarin orange (right) == Cultivation == The yuzu originated and grows wild in central China and its Tibet region. It was introduced to Japan and Korea during the Tang dynasty, and is still cultivated there. It grows slowly, generally requiring 10 years to fruit. To shorten duration to fruiting, it may be grafted onto karatachi (P. trifoliata). It is unusual among citrus plants in being relatively frost-hardy, due to its cold-hardy Ichang papeda ancestry, and can be grown in regions with winters as low as \u22129 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) where more sensitive citrus would not thrive. == Varieties and similar fruits == In Japan, an ornamental version of yuzu called \"flower yuzu\" is also grown for its flowers rather than its fruit. A sweet variety of yuzu known as the yuko, only present in Japan, became severely endangered during the 1970s and 1980s; a major attempt has been made to revive this varietal in southern Japan. Another variety of yuzu in Japan, with knobby skin, is called .photo Dangyuja, a Korean citrus fruit from Jeju Island, is often considered a type of yuzu due to its similar shape and flavour, but it is genetically a variety of pomelo. == Use == ===East Asia=== ==== Culinary use ==== ===== Japan ===== A bottle of yuzu vinegar Though rarely eaten as a fruit, yuzu is a common ingredient in Japanese cuisine, where the aromatic zest (outer rind) as well as juice are used much in the same way that lemons are used in other cuisines.

It is an integral ingredient (along with sudachi, daidai, and other similar citrus fruits) in the citrus-based sauce ponzu, and yuzu vinegar is also produced.

In Japan, bathing with yuzu on T\u014dji, the winter solstice, is a custom that dates to at least the early 18th century. Whole yuzu fruits are floated in the hot water of the bath, sometimes enclosed in a cloth bag, releasing their aroma. The fruit may also be cut in half, allowing the citrus juice to mingle with the bathwater. The yuzu bath, known commonly as yuzu yu (\u67da\u5b50\u6e6f), but also as yuzu buro (\u67da\u5b50\u98a8\u5442), is said to guard against colds, treat the roughness of skin, warm the body, and relax the mind. The body of the taepyeongso, a Korean traditional oboe, close to the Chinese Suona or the Zurna, is often made from jujube, mulberry or yuzu wood. === Elsewhere === Beginning in the early 21st century, yuzu has been increasingly used by chefs in the United States and other Western nations, achieving notice in a 2003 article in The New York Times. In the United States the Department of Agriculture banned the import of fresh yuzu from abroad \u2014 both the fruit and the trees. == See also == * Calamansi * Dangyuja == References == Category:Citrus Category:Fruits originating in Asia Category:Japanese fruit Category:Korean cuisine ",
