It began on January 28th 2011 at a secret show at Velvet Jones in Santa Barbara, California where they debuted the album in full. The tour included dates across Europe, Oceania, North and South America and included festival dates such as Reading and Leeds Festival as well a series of performances in hardcore fans' garages which was documented in their \"Garage Tour\" documentary on YouTube. ==Background== The tour started with a series of secret intimate shows across California including at The Roxy. They also played at the Shockwaves NME Awards 2011 show at O2 Brixton Academy and was their first performance at the venue since the There Is Nothing Left to Lose tour.
