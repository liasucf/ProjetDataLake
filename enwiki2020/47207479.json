    "text": "The Chad wild dog (Lycaon pictus sharicus), also known as the Shari River hunting dog, the Saharan wild dog or the Central African wild dog, is a subspecies of the African wild dog native to Central Africa. It is possibly extinct in the northern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Due to poor populations in Central Africa, the Chad wild dog is critically endangered and is close to extinction.Fanshawe, J. H., Ginsberg, J. R., Sillero-Zubiri, C. & Woodroffe, R., eds. 1997. The Status & Distribution of Remaining Wild Dog Populations. In Rosie Woodroffe, Joshua Ginsberg & David MacDonald, eds., Status Survey and Conservation Plan: The African Wild Dog: 11\u201356. IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group. In the Central African Republic, the Chad wild dogs currently live in only one protected area, the Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park. ==Taxonomy== The Chad wild dog was first described by both naturalists Oldfield Thomas and Robert Charles Wroughton in 1907 under the trinomen Lycaon pictus sharicus from the lower Shari River and eastern Lake Chad. It is also sometimes mistakenly known as Lycaon pictus saharicus, named after the Sahara Desert. The specimens from Tanezrouft, Algeria were indicated as a distinct race, though it is possibly applicable to the Shari River subspecies.Thomas, O. & Wroughton, R. C. (1834). (Lycaon pictus sharicus). Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College (1939): 190. ==Distribution and habitat== Once widespread, the Chad wild dog lived in northern Congo, Chad, the Central African Republic, Niger, southern Algeria, Libya and eastern Sudan. ==References== Category:African wild dogs Category:Mammals described in 1907 Category:Carnivorans of Africa Category:Fauna of Central Africa Category:Mammals of North Africa Category:Mammals of Chad Category:Mammals of the Central African Republic Category:Mammals of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ",
