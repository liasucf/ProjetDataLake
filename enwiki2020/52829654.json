Terryglass Castle is listed as having contributed to taxation of the diocese in 1302-1307 and is mentioned as having a covered chancel in the Royal Visitation of 1615, although by the Civil Survey of 1654\u201356 only a churchyard is mentioned. ==Building== Terryglass is a four- towered keep built by the Marshall family. The castle was constructed between 1219 and 1232 by John Marshall. By 1232, John Marshall was listed as having significant debts to King Henry III, who used the castle and surrounding lands as security against the debts. The castle was to change hands many times passing to Nicholas Dunheaued in 1275\u201376, Theobald le Botiller, 2nd Chief Butler of Ireland in 1289, William Marshall in 1290, Richard \u00d3g de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster in 1323 and James Butler in 1589. ==References== Category:National Monuments in County Tipperary Category:Castles in County Tipperary ",
