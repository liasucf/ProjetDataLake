On 26 October 2014, Kalles\u00f8e got his debut for Randers FC at the age of 17. Kalles\u00f8e started on the bench, but replaced Kasper Fisker in the 80nd minute in a 3\u20130 victory against OB. In October 2016 in a game between Lyngby Boldklub and Randers, Kalles\u00f8e suffered a horrible concussion, which was the fifth concussion in his career. The concussion kept Kalles\u00f8e sidelined for 6 months and was close to make an end of his football career. Since this incident, Kalles\u00f8e has played with either a helmet or a special headband. ====On loan to Viborg FF==== On 31 August 2017, Kalles\u00f8e was loaned out to Viborg FF for the rest of 2017. Kalles\u00f8e played 12 games for Viborg the first half year. Viborg wanted to keep the player, but both the player and Randers FC rejected that, and he returned to Randers. ==References== ==External links== * Mikkel Kalles\u00f8e on randersfc.dk * * Mikkel Kalles\u00f8e on DBU Category:Living people Category:1997 births Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Danish footballers Category:Danish Superliga players Category:Randers FC players Category:Denmark youth international footballers Category:People from Lemvig ",
