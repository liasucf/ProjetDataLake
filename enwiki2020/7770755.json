    "text": "Fernando Jorge Lima de Moraes (born 21 January 1980), commonly referred to as Fernando, is a Brazilian-Australian retired footballer who last played for South Melbourne in the Victorian Premier League. He is also a member of the Australia national futsal team. ==Career== Fernando initially specialised in futsal while playing in Brazil, and played his first match in the outdoor version of the game at the age of 21. He first played for PSB Palestra S\u00e3o Bernado in Brazil before moving to Australia (where his sister lives) to play for South Melbourne FC, having seen them play at the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship. He joined the team for the 2005 Victorian Premier League season. In 2006, he left the club to undertake an unsuccessful 4-week trial at Greek Super League club Egaleo FC, after which he returned to Australia and played a vital role in securing the championship for South Melbourne as their highest scoring player (with a total of 12). He was signed by A-League club New Zealand Knights FC shortly after the championship victory on a short-term contract, for a fee of \u00a390,000 (\u20ac100,000), that was extended several times, but did not feature in the Knights' line-up and was soon relegated to the bench. He returned to South Melbourne at the conclusion of the Knights' season and joined the squad for pre-season matches, eventually signing a new 2-year contract. One of his most important goals for South Melbourne came during the 2010 Singapore Cup when his goal put South Melbourne 2-1 up against Thai Premier League champions Bangkok Glass, however it would not be enough, as Bangkok would ultimately tie 3-3 allowing them to go through on aggregate, knocking out South Melbourne in the process. In January 2014, de Moraes officially retired from playing football. ==Honours== With South Melbourne: * Victorian Premier League Championship: 2006 Individual * Victorian Premier League player of the year: 2010 * Hummel F-League Golden Boot: 2013 With North Melbourne Futsal Club: * Futsal Oz V-League Premiership: 2011 With Vic Vipers Futsal Club: * Hummel F-League Champions: 2013 ==References== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:People from S\u00e3o Paulo Category:Brazilian emigrants to Australia Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazilian men's futsal players Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:New Zealand Knights FC players Category:South Melbourne FC players Category:A-League players Category:Australian men's futsal players Category:Expatriate association footballers in New Zealand Category:Naturalised citizens of Australia Category:Australian people of Brazilian descent Category:Naturalised soccer players of Australia Category:Association football midfielders ",
