    "text": "Thunderbunny is a comic book about a boy who transforms into a superhero resembling a large pink humanoid rabbit. It was created by Martin Greim.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/g/greim_marty.htm ==Publication history== Thunderbunny's first appearance published by a major company was Charlton Bullseye #6 (Mar. 1982), published by Charlton Comics. Thunderbunny made a subsequent appearance in that title's 10th issue. The character then moved briefly to Archie Comics, appearing in Thunderbunny #1 as part of Red Circle Comics, a short-lived revival of the Archie Comics superhero characters. Thunderbunny appeared in Blue Ribbon Comics #13 (Oct.1984), co- starring in a story also featuring the Fly, the Shield, the Web and the Jaguar, The All New Adventures of the Mighty Crusaders #7, and Pep Comics #393 (March 1984). Thunderbunny then moved to WaRP Graphics for a six-issue run (June 1985 \u2013 Feb. 1986), with an additional story in Warp Graphics Annual #1. Issues #7\u201312 were published by Apple Comics (Apr. 1986 \u2013 Nov. 1987). ==Character history== Thunderbunny was the last survivor of an alien race of humanoid animals. The essence of this world's greatest hero was transferred into a special box-shaped device and subtly presented to a young boy named Bobby Caswell. When Bobby placed his hands in two hand-shaped impressions on the box, power transferred into his body and gave him the ability to transform into Thunderbunny. His powers include super-strength and flight. Bobby finds the bunny form to be embarrassing. Furthermore, the longer he stays in that form, the more difficult it is to form the essential mental image of his original form to change back. This combination of concerns makes him most reluctant to use his superhero identity, but he has still had adventures as Thunderbunny. ==See also== *Hoppy the Marvel Bunny ==References== ==External links== *Thunderbunny's page at International Superheroes Category:Charlton Comics superheroes Category:WaRP Graphics titles Category:1982 comics debuts Category:Comics characters introduced in 1982 Category:Fictional hares and rabbits Category:Animal superheroes Category:Archie Comics superheroes Category:Archie Comics titles Category:Comics about rabbits and hares ",
