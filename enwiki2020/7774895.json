It was brought into force by the Indian government from 26 October 2006. The Act provides for the first time in Indian law a definition of \"domestic violence\", with this definition being broad and including not only physical violence, but also other forms of violence such as emotional/verbal, sexual, and economic abuse. It is a civil law meant primarily for protection orders and not for meant to be enforced criminally. == Definitions == The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 different from the provision of the Penal Code - section 498A[1][1] of the Indian Penal Code - in that it provides a broader definition of domestic violence. Domestic violence is defined by Section 3 of the Act as \"any act, omission or commission or conduct of the respondent shall constitute domestic violence in case it: # harms or injures or endangers the health, safety, life, limb or well-being, whether mental or physical, of the aggrieved person or tends to do so and includes causing physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal and emotional abuse and economic abuse; or # harasses, harms, injures or endangers the aggrieved person to coerce her or any other person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any dowry or other property or valuable security; or # has the effect of threatening the aggrieved person or any person related to her by any conduct mentioned in clause (a) or clause (b); or # otherwise injures or causes harm, whether physical or mental, to the aggrieved person.\" The Act goes on, through the section Explanation 1, to define \"physical abuse\",\"sexual abuse\", \"verbal and emotional abuse\" and \"economic abuse\". == Scope == Primarily meant to provide protection to the wife or female live-in partner from domestic violence at the hands of the husband or male live-in partner or his relatives, the law also extends its protection to women living in a household such as sisters, widows or mothers.

Harassment by way of unlawful dowry demands to the woman or her relatives would also be covered under this definition. The salient features of the Protection from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 are as follows: * The Act seeks to cover those women who are or have been in a relationship with the abuser where both parties have lived together in a shared household and are related by consanguinity, marriage or a relationship in the nature of marriage, or adoption; in addition relationship with family members living together as a joint family are also included.

The Act provides for the woman\u2019s right to reside in the matrimonial or shared household, whether or not she has any title or rights in the household. This right is secured by a residence order, which is passed by a court.

Similarly, non-compliance or discharge of duties by the Protection Officer is also sought to be made an offence under the Act with similar punishment. While \"economic abuse\" includes deprivation of all or any economic or financial resources to which the victim is entitled under any law or custom whether payable under an order of a Court or otherwise or which the victim requires out of necessity including, but not limited to, household necessities for the aggrieved person and her children, if any, stridhan, property, jointly or separately owned by her, payment of rental related to the shared household and maintenance and disposal of household effects, any alienation of assets whether movable or immovable, valuables, shares, securities, bonds and the like or other property in which the victim has an interest or is entitled to use by virtue of the domestic relationship or which may be reasonably required by the victim or her children or her stridhan or any other property jointly or separately held by the victim and prohibition restriction to continued access to resources or facilities which the victim is entitled to use or enjoy by virtue of the domestic relationship including access to the shared household, \"physical abuse\" means any act or conduct which is of such a nature as to cause bodily pain, harm or danger to life, limb, or health or impair the health or development of the victim and includes assault, criminal intimidation and criminal force. ==Application to the magistrate== An application regarding domestic violence can be presented to the magistrate seeking one or more reliefs mentioned in sections by: *The aggrieved person, *Protection officer on behalf of aggrieved person *Any other person on behalf of aggrieved person ===Jurisdiction of court=== The first class magistrate court or metropolitan court shall be the competent court within the local limits of which *The aggrieved person permanently or temporary resides or carries on business or is employed *The respondent permanently or temporally resides or carries on business or is employed or *The cause of action arises.

Batra v. Taruna Batra, 136 (2007) DLT 1 (SC): 1 (2007) DMC 1 (SC): 2007 (1) UJ 2 (SC). Case no. 5837; Civil appeal. C.A. No.-005837-005837 - 2006. Diary no. 5318-2005. Bench: S.B. Sinha & Markandey Katju. Supreme Court of India. Judgement regarding shared household (original): \"It is well settled that any interpretation which leads to absurdity should not be accepted. Learned counsel for the respondent Smt Taruna Batra has relied upon Section 19(1)(f) of the Act and claimed that she should be given an alternative accommodation. In our opinion, the claim for alternative accommodation can only be made against the husband and not against the husband\u2019s in-laws or other relatives. As regards Section 17(1) of the Act, in our opinion the wife is only entitled to claim a right to residence in a shared household, and a \u2018shared household\u2019 would only mean the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband, or the house which belongs to the joint family of which the husband is a member. The property in question in the present case neither belongs to Amit Batra nor was it taken on rent by him nor is it a joint family property of which the husband Amit Batra is a member. It is the exclusive property of appellant No. 2, mother of Amit Batra. Hence it cannot be called a \u2018shared household\u2019. No doubt, the definition of \u2018shared household\u2019 in Section 2(s) of the Act ... we have to give it an interpretation which is sensible and which does not lead to chaos in society\". Judgement regarding shared household (alternate): \"In section 2(5) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 the court has to give an interpretation which is sensible and which does not lead to chaos in society\". Date of Judgement: 15 December 2006. *Directing the respondent to secure same level of alternate accommodation for the aggrieved person as enjoyed by her or to pay rent for the same if the circumstances so require. No order shall be made against women under this section. Magistrate may impose additional condition and pass any other order to protect the safety of the aggrieved person or her child. Magistrate is also empowered to order direction the concerned station house officer of the police station to give protection to the aggrieved person to assist in implementing his order. Magistrate may also impose on the respondent to direct stridhan or any other property or valuabale security she is entitled ====Monetary relief==== The magistrate may direct the respondent to pay monetary relief to meet the expenses of the aggrieved person and any child as a result of domestic violence and such relief include *Loss of earnings *Medical expenses *Loss caused due to destruction or removal or damage of any property *Pass order as to maintenance for the aggrieved person as well as her children if any Including the order under or in addition to an order of maintenance under section 125 criminal procedure code or any other law.

There are several gaps in the implementation of laws.Shalu Nigam (2019) Women and Domestic Violence Law in India: A Quest for Justice https://www.amazon.in/Women-Domestic-Violence-Law-India/dp/1138366145 However, groups involved in drafting the law believed this would provide more rapid and flexible relief for the victim.Pandey, Geeta, et. al., BBC News, \"100 Women 2014: Violence at home is India's 'failing'\", 29 October 2014, BBC NewsHornbeck, Amy; Bethany Johnson; Michelle LaGrotta; & Kellie Sellman; \"The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act: Solution or Mere Paper Tiger?\", Loyola University Chicago International Law Review, Volume 4, Issue 2, Spring/Summer, 2007, pp.273-307, Loyola University, Chicago (also online at: ) Men's organizations such as the Save Indian Family Foundation have opposed the law, arguing that it might be misused by women during disputes. It has been noticed by women's groups that such claims emerge only when special provisions are made for the marginalised. Renuka Chowdhury, the Indian Minister for Women and Child Development, agreed in a Hindustan Times article that \"an equal gender law would be ideal. But there is simply too much physical evidence to prove that it is mainly the woman who suffers at the hands of man\". Former Attorney General of India Soli Sorabjee has also criticized the broad definition of verbal abuse in the act. According to the then President of India, Pratibha Devisingh Patil, \"Another disquieting trend has been that women themselves have not been innocent of abusing women. At times women have played an unsavory, catalytic role in perpetrating violence whether against the daughter-in-law, the mother-in-law or female domestic helps. Instances exist whereby protective legal provisions for the benefit of women have been subjected to distortion and misuse to wreak petty vengeance and to settle scores. Some surveys have concluded that 90 percent of dowry complaints are false and were registered primarily to settle scores. It is unfortunate if laws meant to protect women get abused as instruments of oppression. The bottom-line therefore, is the fair invocation of legal provisions and their objective and honest implementation.\" ==See also== * Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 * Domestic violence in India * Honor killing in India * Dowry system in India * Dowry death in India * Bride burning * Dowry system in India * Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 * Violence against women * The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 ==References== ==External links== * Domestic Violence Act 2005 Category:Acts of the Parliament of India 2005 Category:Indian family law Category:Women's rights in India Category:Women's rights legislation Category:Violence against women in India Category:2005 in women's history ",
