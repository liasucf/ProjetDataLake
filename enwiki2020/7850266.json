Portions of it were once a single county together with the county of the same name in South Korea; other portions were added from neighbouring counties in the 1952 reorganization of local governments. After the initial division of Korea, the entire county lay to the Northern side of the dividing line, but in the course of the Korean War part of the county was taken by the South. ==Geography== The county's terrain is mountainous in the north, but gradually more level towards the south. The Masingryong Mountains pass through the county; the highest point of which is the Taehwang Peak (\ub300\uc655\ub355\uc0b0). The chief watercourse is the Rimjin River. Approximately 54% of the county's area is occupied by forests. ==Administrative divisions== Ch'\u014frw\u014fn county is divided into 1 \u016dp (town) and 36 ri (villages): {| |- | valign=\"top\" | * Ch'\u014frw\u014fn-\u016dp * Ch\u014fksal-li * Ch\u014fktong-ri * Ch\u014fngdong-ri * Ch\u014ft'am-ri * Chunggang-ri * Hasinch'\u014fm-ri * Hoesal-li * Kalhy\u014fl-li * Kangsal-li * Kas\u016dng-ri * K\u014fmsa-ri * Mabang-ri | valign=\"top\" | * Majang-ri * Miram-ri * Munam-ri * Naemul-li * Odong-ri * Oehang-ri * Ot'al-li * Paengrosal-li * Pans\u014fng-ri * Pomang-ri * Puap-ri * Rips\u014fng-ri | valign=\"top\" | * Ryonghang-ri * Ryudaep'o-ri * Samsa-ri * Sangha-ri * Sangmasal-li * Sinjil-li * Songhy\u014fl-li * Taej\u014fng-ri * Tokk\u014fm-ri * Tomil-li * W\u014flam-ri * Yuj\u014fng-ri |} ==Economy== The chief local industry is agriculture.
