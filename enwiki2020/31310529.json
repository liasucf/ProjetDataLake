    "text": "The FFSA GT Championship (Championnat de France FFSA GT) is a French Grand Touring-style sports car racing series that began in 1997. It is the main event of the Championnat de France des Circuits (formerly called Super S\u00e9rie FFSA and GT Tour). It is controlled by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise du Sport Automobile (FFSA) and organized by racing company Oreca. Since the demise of the French Supertouring Championship after the 2005 season, the French GT has become France's major circuit racing championship. ==History== Founded by Patrick Peter in 1997 as an offshoot of the international BPR Global GT Series, this national version featured a wide variety of Grand Touring-style cars in multiple classes competing at the same time on mostly French courses. In 1998 saw the SRO Group took over the series as the classes were reorganized to reflect the changes made in the new FIA GT Championship, continuing in a similar formula today. In 2011, the series was handed over from SRO to Oreca, a French racing team, constructor, and organiser of the Sportscar Winter Series and the former Formula Le Mans Cup. The main class has used GTS car regulations from 1997 to 2004, GT1 from 2005 to 2009, and FIA GT3 from 2010 to 2016. The championship featured classes for both professionals and amateurs. GT3 rules included extensive performance balancing and handicap weights to make cars artificially more equal. In 2016, grids depleted and Oreca cancelled the championship was cancelled. For the 2017 season, the SRO Group became again the promoter and the GT4 regulations were adopted. ==Circuits== * Circuit d'Albi (1997, 2002-2011) * Circuit Bugatti (1998-1999, 2001-2006, 2012-2015) * Circuit de Charade (1998) * Circuit Dijon-Prenois (1997-1998, 2000, 2002-2012, 2017-2018) * Circuit de L\u00e9denon (1999-2015, 2019) * Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours (1997-2015, 2017-2019) * Circuit de Pau (1999, 2001-2003, 2005, 2017-2019) * Circuit Paul Armagnac (1997-2011, 2014, 2016-2019) * Circuit Paul Ricard (1997, 2009, 2011-2015, 2017-2019) * Circuit du Val de Vienne (1997, 2000-2001, 2003-2015) * Spa-Francorchamps (1998, 2008, 2013-2015, 2019) * Circuit Ricardo Tormo (1999) * Circuito de Navarra (2012, 2015) * Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya (2017-2018) * Hungaroring (2000) * Autodromo Nazionale Monza (2001) * Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari (2013) ==Champions== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\" !Season !Driver !Car !Team |- ! 1997 | Patrice Goueslard | Porsche 911 GT2 | Larbre |- ! 1998 | Jean-Pierre Jarier Fran\u00e7ois Lafon | Porsche 911 GT2 | Sonauto |- ! 1999 | Jean-Pierre Jarier | Porsche 911 GT2 | Sonauto |- ! 2000 | Dominique Dupuy Fran\u00e7ois Fiat | Chrysler Viper GTS-R | DDO |- ! 2001 | Dominique Dupuy Fran\u00e7ois Fiat | Chrysler Viper GTS-R | DDO |- ! 2002 | Philippe Soulan Patrice Goueslard | Porsche 911 GT2 | Nourry |- ! 2003 | Didier Defourny Patrice Goueslard | Chrysler Viper GTS-R | Larbre |- ! 2004 | Patrick Bornhauser | Chrysler Viper GTS-R | VBM |- ! 2005 | Olivier Th\u00e9venin Patrick Bornhauser | Chrysler Viper GTS-R | VBM |- ! 2006 | Soheil Ayari Bruno Hernandez | Saleen S7-R | Oreca |- ! 2007 | Soheil Ayari Raymond Narac | Saleen S7-R | Oreca |- ! 2008 | Christophe Bouchut Patrick Bornhauser | Saleen S7-R | Larbre |- ! 2009 | Eric Debard | Chevrolet Corvette C6.R | DKR |- ! 2010 | Laurent Groppi Patrick Bornhauser | Porsche 911 GT3 R | Larbre |- ! 2011 | Laurent Pasquali Anthony Beltoise | Porsche 997 GT3 R | Pro GT |- ! 2012 | Henry Hassid Anthony Beltoise | Porsche 997 GT3 R | Pro GT |- ! 2013 | Morgan Moulin- Traffort Fabien Barthez | Ferrari 458 Italia | Team Sofrev ASP |- ! 2014 | Raymond Narac Nicolas Armindo | Porsche 911 GT3 R | IMSA Performance Matmut |- ! 2015 | S\u00e9bastien Dumez Raymond Narac Olivier Pernaut | Porsche 911 GT3 R | IMSA Performance Matmut |- ! 2016 | Soheil Ayari Laurent Pasquali Nicolas Tardif | Ferrari 458 Italia GT3 | Sport Garage |- ! 2017 | Mike Parisy Gilles Vannelet | Porsche Cayman Clubsport MR GT4 | Speed Car |- ! 2018 | Gr\u00e9gory Guilvert Fabien Michal | Audi R8 LMS GT4 | Saint\u00e9loc Racing |- ! 2019 | Gr\u00e9gory Guilvert Fabien Michal | Audi R8 LMS GT4 | Saint\u00e9loc Racing |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Sports car racing series Category:Group GT3 Category:Auto racing series in France Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1997 Category:1997 establishments in France ",
