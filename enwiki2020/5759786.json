    "text": "Toussaint Louverture International Airport (, ) is an international airport in Tabarre, a commune of Port-au-Prince in Haiti. The airport is currently the busiest in Haiti and is an operating hub for Salsa d'Haiti, Tortug' Air, Sunrise Airways, and Haiti Aviation. It is informally called \"the Mais-G\u00e2t\u00e9 airport\", named after the area in the Cul-de-Sac Plain where the airport was built. == History == During the 1940s, a military and civil airfield, Bowen Field, the smaller military airport in Chancerelles, not the international airport - was established near Baie de Port-au-Prince providing passenger air service by Compagnie ha\u00eftienne de transports a\u00e9riens. In the 1950s and the 1960s, it served as an airbase for the US military in Haiti. Developed with grant money from the US government and mostly money collected from Haitian people (taxes, lottery, etc.), the current airport opened as Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier International Airport in 1965, after the Haitian president at the time, Fran\u00e7ois \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier. Duvalier's son and successor, Jean-Claude Duvalier, resigned in 1986. The airport was renamed Port-au-Prince International Airport. Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide renamed the airport again as Toussaint Louverture International Airport in 2003 to honor Toussaint Louverture, the leader of the Haitian Revolution. The airport was badly damaged by the 2010 Haiti earthquake. On 25 November 2012, Haitian President Michel Joseph Martelly opened the newly-repaired arrivals terminal. == Facilities == Aerial view of Runway 10 The main building of the airport works as the International Terminal. It is a two-story concrete and glass structure. Lounges and a few retail stores are on the second floor of the main building. Check-in counters, gates and immigration facilities are on the lower floor. The Guy Malary Terminal (named after former Haitian Justice Minister Guy Malary) is used for domestic flights. There are further buildings used for general aviation and cargo flights. The airport has 3 jet bridges, but most passengers walk onto aircraft from mobile stairs. The ramp area can handle 12 planes.Globe and Mail, \"A once sleepy airport is now Haiti's overstretched lifeline\", Paul Koring, 19 January 2010 (accessed 20 January 2010) The airport is to be re-designed completely by the year 2015. The re-making of the airport is to add 14 gates to the terminal and also will make the main passenger terminal bigger. As of June 15, 2016, a taxiway is under construction to increase traffic capacity, as taxiing aircraft currently must use the active runway to taxi to their takeoff position. Work is being performed by China National Automation Control System Corporation which has multiple large construction contracts with the Haitian government. ==Airlines and destinations== ===Passenger=== PAP aerial view ===Cargo=== == Access == Terminal aerial view The airport can be accessed by car (with parking space next to the terminal building) or by National Bus Route 1. ==Accidents and incidents== * 3 March 1980: A Learjet (N211MB) operating on a corporate charter flight on behalf of 'Merchant Bank' crashed in the hills on arrival at airport.
