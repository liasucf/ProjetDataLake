    "text": "The Joliet Transportation Center is a multimodal mass transit center linking passenger bus routes, Metra commuter trains, and Amtrak passenger trains in the city of Joliet, Illinois. It has replaced Joliet Union Station as the commuter and passenger train station serving Joliet. Union Station ceased to provide train service in September 2014, and groundbreaking for the new station took place late in 2016, with construction beginning shortly afterward. After several delays, the station officially opened to Amtrak and Metra traffic on April 11, 2018. ==References== Category:Amtrak stations in Illinois Category:Buildings and structures in Joliet, Illinois Category:Metra stations in Illinois Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Will County, Illinois Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 2018 ",
