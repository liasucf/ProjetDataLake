    "text": "Passiflora pectinata is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean. ==Taxonomy== Passiflora pectinata has been assigned to subgenus Passiflora, section Dysosmia. ==Etymology== The species is named for the pectinate (comb- shaped) involucral bracts. ==Distribution and Habitat== Passiflora pectinata is native to the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and the Turks and Caicos, where it is frequently found growing in sand dunes and low scrub. ==Description== The vine is glabrous throughout. The stem is subangular, striate, and rather stout. Stipules are deeply cleft into linear or subulate, gland-tipped segments. Petioles are 1 to 2 cm long, often bearing a few stiff, gland-tipped hairs. Leaves are cordate-deltoid, 4 to 7 cm long, 3 to 6 cm wide, obscurely hastate or not lobed, acute or obtusish at apex, deeply cordate at base, repand-crenulate (often with minute glands in the sinuses of the crenations at the tips of the nerves), 5-nerved, coriaceous, often sublustrous. Peduncles are solitary, 2 to 3 cm long. Bracts are 2 to 3 cm, long pectinate or once pinnatifid (segments gland-tipped, scarcely longer than width of rachis), rarely bipinnatifid, but the rachis at least 2 mm. wide. Flowers are 5 to 8 cm wide, white. Sepals are linear or linear- lanceolate, 2.5 to 3.5 cm long, 5 to 8 mm wide at base, obtuse, corniculate just below apex, the horn being up to 7 mm long, subfoliaceous. Petals are linear, 2 to 3 cm. long, 4 to 6 mm wide, obtuse, white. Coronal filaments are in several series, with the 2 outer narrowly ligulate, the outermost 1 to 1.5 cm long, the second 6 to 8 mm long, the succeeding 2 or 3 series consisting of filiform threads 2 to 3 mm long. The operculum is membranous, barely 1 mm high, denticulate. The ovary is ovoid, tapering at apex. Fruit is subglobose, 2 to 3 cm in diameter, deep pink. Seeds are oblong, about 5 mm. long, 4 mm. wide, tridentate at apex, shallowly coarsely reticulate. ==References== ==External links== * pectinata Category:Flora of the Caribbean ",
