    "text": "Chey Chettha III (; 1639-1673) or Batom Reachea II was a Cambodian king from 1672 to 1673. Chey Chettha III was the only son of Batom Reachea. In 1671, he became the son-in-law of his uncle, King Barom Reachea V, by marrying his eldest daughter, Princess Sri Thida Kshatriyi. In December 1672, he murdered his father-in-law and seized the throne, and forced his cousin Bhagavatti Dav Kshatriyi (also the wife of his uncle Prince Ang Tan) to be his wife. Chey Chettha III was assassinated by the Chams and Malays in the employ of his wife, Gama Kshatriyi, just five months after his coronation, in April (or May) 1673. ==References== * Phoeun Mak, Dharma Po. \u00ab La deuxi\u00e8me intervention militaire vietnamienne au Cambodge (1673-1679)\u00bb dans: Bulletin de l'\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient.
