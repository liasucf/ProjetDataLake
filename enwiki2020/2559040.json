    "text": "Gordes is a commune in the Vaucluse d\u00e9partement in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region in southeastern France. The residents are known as Gordiens. The nearest big city is Avignon; smaller cities nearby include Cavaillon, L'Isle- sur-la-Sorgue and Apt. ==Geography== The territory of Gordes occupies some of \"Les Monts de Vaucluse\", a group of mountains and hills, part in the valley of the Calavon (a local river) also called the \"Luberon Valley\". === Access === The main access to the village of Gordes is the departmental road D2 then the departmental road D15, coming from Cavaillon. It is from the latter road, below the Bel-Air rock, that you can observe the most famous and photographed point of view of the village. Gordes is located 38 kilometres east from Avignon and its TGV station, 75 kilometres from the Marseille Provence international airport and 87 kilometres from Marseille. The closest \"gares SNCF\" (normal train station) are located in L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue and Cavaillon. ===Neighboring communes=== Neighboring villages are Venasque and Murs to the north, Joucas and Roussillon to the east, Goult, Saint-Pantal\u00e9on, Beaumettes and Opp\u00e8de to the south and Cabri\u00e8res-d'Avignon and Saumane-de- Vaucluse to the west. === Topography === Located between two geographic area, Gordes is one of the biggest communes of the area with 4,804 hectares. The north is defined by the southern edge of the Vaucluse Mountains. The highest point of the commune (635 meters) is in this area, next to la Pouraque and les Trois Termes. The south of the commune is made by the Calavon valley, also called the Luberon Valley, and a few hills in the area. The lowest height of the commune, at 111 meters, is in the south in the area called plan de l'Alba. The village itself is located in the center of the commune, on a giant calcareous rock from the Vaucluse Mountains, dominating the valley. === Geology === With a wide variation of the land, geology of the commune is divided into several distinct zones. In the north, on the Vaucluse Mountains, are soils dating mainly from Upper Jurassic with urgonian limestone and calcareous clay. There are also, in very low amounts and primarily localized over the Senanque Abbey, soils dating from the Eocene / Oligocene, composed of limestone, sand, and clay. Geology in the south of the village is more complex. The plain in Gordes (southeast) is composed of soil dating from the Quaternary (fluvial deposits, colluvium and scree) and soils of the Late Jurassic period (calcareous clay and blue marl). The hills area of \"les garrigues\" (in the south) is composed of soil dating from the Cretaceous \u2013 Paleocene period (calcareous sandstone, calcareous lacustrine clay, colorful, white and ocher sands and some ferruginous) and from the Miocene period (molasses limestone, sand and marl). Finally, the soil of the territory down to the plain of Calavon with some slightly higher ground dating from the Miocene and one lower from the Quaternary. ===Climate=== Gordes has a Mediterranean climate characterised by relatively dry summers and cool, damp winters. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. In summer, high temperatures associated with a reduced amount of rain creates a drought of almost one or two months a year according to the \"Gaussen index\" (temperatures in Celsius degrees twice higher than rains in millimeters). Atlas du parc du Luberon ==History== The name \"Gordes\" derives from the Celtic word \"Vordense\". Vordense was pronounced Gordenses, then Gordae/Gordone, and finally G\u00f2rda then translated into French \"Gordes\".GORDES notes d'histoire by Jean-Louis Morand page 9. === Early history === Occupation by the Roman empire.GORDES notes d'histoire by Jean-Louis Morand page 17 to 24 / \"L'\u00e9poque romaine\". The area is full of evidence of their occupation especially the Roman road passing through Apt and Carpentras and crossing the valley. Gallo-Roman remains were found in \"Bouisses\" district (skeletons, amphorae, columns) or Gallo-Roman substructures in the hamlet of \"les Gros\". The view from north of the castle shows the ancient and the Renaissance parts. === Middle Ages and Renaissance === In the 8th century, a Benedictine abbey known as Saint-Chaffret was founded by monks of the Abbey of Saint-Chaffre in Monastier-en-Velay on the site of an ancient cella (Roman temple) destroyed during the Arab invasions.GORDES notes d'histoire by Jean-Louis Morand page 39 to 53, \"Histoire de Saint Chaffret\" In 1031, a castle was built and the Latin word \"castrum\" was added to what thus became \"Castrum Gordone\". The castle was re-enforced in 1123 to become a \"nobile castrum\", the only one known among the many castles nearby.GORDES notes d'histoire by Jean-Louis Morand page 249 to 253 \"Le ch\u00e2teau de Gordes\" then page 205 to 216 / \"G\u00e9n\u00e9alogie des familles\". In 1148 the S\u00e9nanque Abbey was established under the patronage of Alfant, Bishop of Cavaillon, and Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona, Count of Provence, by Cistercian monks who came from Mazan Abbey in the Ard\u00e8che. After the death of King Ren\u00e9 of Provence, the territory of Provence was incorporated in 1481 into the kingdom of France as a \"province royale fran\u00e7aise\" (French royal province). An insurrection broke out in the former states of Agoult- Simiane and County of Forcalquier. Gordes is distinguished by a strong opposition to French centralism but will pay heavily for its claims of independence. A year later, with the wedding of his son, Jacques Raybaud de Simiane takes the title of \"Baron de Gordes\". === Second World War === During World War II, Gordes was an active resistance village and was later awarded a medal, the Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945. On 21 August 1944, almost a week after the beginning of the Operation Dragoon on the Proven\u00e7al coast, a German patrol was attacked by the resistance. The day after, 22 August, the village was subject to violent reprisals. The Germans forced the inhabitants to enter their homes, shooting those who were late or that were not cooperating, and started to shoot from the rock on the other side with a canon and destroyed a dozen houses. On the other side of the village, the rest of the troops set fire to a chariot, pieces of wood and houses, blocking potential followers. More than twenty houses were destroyed. After the Liberation the resistance destroyed another part of the village, including the notarial house with all the archives. All this destruction brought the municipality the sad privilege to appear amongst three \"stricken cities\" of the Vaucluse department. By war's end, thirteen persons had been killed or executed in Gordes, twenty inhabitants had been shot by the enemy and five inhabitants were deported. === After World War II === After a period of reconstruction, the village started to attract artists like Marc Chagall or Jean Deyrolle who discovered the village in 1947 and will in turn attract artist friends such as Serge Poliakoff, Vasarely, Dewasne, etc. ===Armory=== The primary ones are reported in 1696 in the Armorial G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de France and coming from the Gordes-Simiane family. === Other historical language names === in classical norm of provencal, in Mistralian norm == Administration == The \"Hotel Simiane\", historical building with the new town office. The commune of Gordes has numerous infrastructures of public utility like the \"gendarmerie\", the fire brigade, the post office, a tax office, a library, etc. ===Sister cities=== * Annet-sur-Marne, France, since 1985.

In the immediate vicinity of Gordes is the Romanesque S\u00e9nanque Abbey (Cistercian) and the Village des Bories, a village of dry stone huts that is now a museum.

File:Gordes - monument aux morts by JM Rosier.jpg|The war memorial and the castle File:Cave Saint Firmain Gordes by JM Rosier 1.jpg|The Saint- Firmin Palace cellars === Building regulations === A calade in the village. All new buildings in Gordes are made of stone with terracotta roof tiles. No fences are allowed, only stone walls. All electrical and telephone cables are underground, except in some pre-existing installations on the borders of the commune. Some streets inside the village are paved with stone and are called calades. === The hamlets === There are several ancient hamlets around the village, whose names are mostly based on the names of the local families (Gros, Imbert, Martin, Cortasse) or from the activities performed there (les bouillons, les bouilladoires). The largest hamlet is les Imberts, in the valley 5km to the southwest. Les Imberts church was built between 1785 and 1792; other buildings also have 18th century architectural details. Gourdes' two football pitches are in Les Imberts: one for official matches and the other for training. Les Imberts has a nursery and a school and once had several small shops, but in 2011 it had only a petrol station. Les Gros and les Martins are two former hamlets close to each other, between les Imberts and the commune of les Beaumettes. The hamlets of les Sauvestres, les Pourquiers, les Marres and les Cortasses are in the plain to the south-east of Gordes. Some of the buildings in these hamlets date back hundreds of years. == Economy == === Agriculture === Vinyard and olive trees with the roofs of Gordes in the back As in many villages in the Vaucluse department, agriculture is important. Historically, almond trees were the most planted in the area, and though they are still present, olive trees have largely replaced them. Thus olive oil is important to local commerce. You can also find vineyards, with the production of table grapes or wine in AOC Ventoux.INAO, April 2007 ===Tourism=== Tourism is a major part of the local economy of Gordes.
