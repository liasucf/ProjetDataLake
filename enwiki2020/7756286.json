    "text": "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me is the fourth album of singer Dusty Springfield to be released in the USA, issued on the Philips Records label in 1966. The album was more or less a retitled re-issue of Springfield's British album Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty, recorded and released in 1965, with the addition of the two hit singles \"You Don't Have To Say You Love Me\" and \"Little By Little\", both released in 1966. In fact, Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty had been released in the US a few months prior, but as the title track of You Don't Have to Say You Love Me became a huge hit single for Springfield, Philips USA decided to repackage and retitle the album after the single. The album was first released on CD by Mercury Records/Universal Music in 1999, then with the remaining three tracks from Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty as bonus features. ==Track listing== All tracks from 1965 album Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty unless otherwise noted Side A #\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\" (Pino Donaggio, Vito Pallavicini, Simon Napier-Bell, Vicki Wickham) - 2:47 #* First release: Philips UK single BF 1482 (A-side), 25 March 1966 #\"Won't Be Long\" (J.
