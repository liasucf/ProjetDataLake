Al Zahra serves some 400,000 outpatients and 23,000 inpatients annually, with a capacity of 137 beds. Facilities at the hospital include a 9-bed Intensive Care Unit and a 14-bed long term care and rehabilitation unit as well as seven operating theatres and a number of specialised units. == History == Established in 1981, the hospital was one of the first and largest such facilities in the UAE. The building was originally intended to be a hotel and construction started in March 1975 but was re- purposed in 1978, with Mumbai-based architects Karani and Sanghoi Associates instructed by the building's owner to redevelop it into a hospital. The adjacent Concord Cinema was developed at the same time. The hospital was acquired in March 2017 by Abu Dhabi-based NMC Healthcare for $560 million from previous owner Gulf Medical Projects Company, which continues to own and operate Al Zahra Hospital, Dubai. Al Zahra Hospital, Sharjah, recorded 2015 revenues of $130.4 million, with a net income of $38.8 million. The hospital employs some 1,250 staff, including 170 doctors. It also offers facilities to visiting doctors. In May 2018, the hospital signed an MoU with the Sharjah Health Authority to offer 30% discounts to elderly Emirati citizens. It also opened a cosmetic surgery facility that month, under the NMC-owned CosmeSurge brand. == References == Category:Hospitals in the United Arab Emirates Category:Hospitals established in 1981 ",
