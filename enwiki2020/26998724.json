    "text": "{| |} The American Aircraft International Penetrator was a military helicopter prototype conceived in 1990 as a gunship conversion of the Bell UH-1 Iroquois, aimed at ground insertion, close support and counter-insurgency roles. ==Design and development== A single prototype was built in 1991 but the manufacturer never won any contracts for production. It was first designed by the American Aircraft Corporation (AAC) and was marketed by a separate company, American Aircraft International (AAI). The stated goal of the project was to convert existing Vietnam-era UH-1 airframes to upgrade them with modern armor and weapons systems, particularly targeting third-world militaries with aging fleets. This conversion could be performed at a fraction of the cost, much faster than ordering new aircraft. The Penetrator required a crew of four (pilot, forward weapons officer, and two rear-facing weapons operators) and could carry six to eight additional passengers. ==Operational history== The prototype aircraft was overhauled by Robert Laura and flying as of 2004. ==References== Category:United States military helicopters Category:1990s United States helicopters ",
