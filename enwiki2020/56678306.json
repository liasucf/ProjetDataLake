It was built in 1887, and it is one of the few commercial structures that remains along the west side of the Cedar River from that era. Besides the Cedar Rapids Milk Condensing Company, the building was also used by the Knutsons for their junk business. It was used for storage and it was also used as a haunted house before it could no longer be occupied. The building has been transformed into 18 market-rate apartments called the Chelsea. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. ==References== Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1887 Category:Apartment buildings in Cedar Rapids, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cedar Rapids, Iowa Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa ",
