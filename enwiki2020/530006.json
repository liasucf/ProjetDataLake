Legislation passed later in the same session of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada provided instead for it to be reconstituted as the United Counties of Huron, Perth and Bruce, with the territory of the Bruce Peninsula withdrawn and annexed to Waterloo County. The Bruce Peninsula was later withdrawn from Waterloo and transferred to Bruce in 1851. The County of Perth was given its own Provisional Municipal Council at that time,S.Prov.C. 1849, c. 96, s. 3 and was separated from the United Counties in 1853. In 1849, the Huron District Council initially united the area of the county with the United Townships of Wawanosh and Ashfield as a single municipality, which lasted until 1851 when Wawanosh and Ashfield were withdrawn. The area then became known as the \"United Townships in the County of Bruce\", which lasted until its division into municipalities in 1854. Canada West in 1857. Bruce County is marked in light green. A Provisional Municipal Council was established for Bruce County at the beginning of 1857, Walkerton was initially proclaimed as the county seat, in preference to Kincardine, but local opposition (including an abortive attempt to have the county divided into Bruce and Saugeen) forced the proclamation to be deferred until each town and village had presented a case for its selection. A subsequent proclamation confirmed Walkerton's selection. In 1863, the provisional council promoted a bill in the Legislative Assembly to divide the county into the counties of Bruce and Wallace, but it only went as far as second reading and did not proceed further.Bill 292, 2nd Session, 7th Parliament (1863) The provisional council later asked for legislation to provide for a referendum as to whether Walkerton, Paisley, Kincardine or another place would be the most acceptable choice. The referendum was held in September 1864, and Paisley received a plurality of the votes. In early 1865, the provisional council asked for legislation to confirm the result, but changed its mind later in the year in favour of Walkerton. Confirming legislation was passed in 1866 to provide for the dissolution of the United Counties on January 1, 1867, with Huron and Bruce becoming separate counties for all purposes., implementing ===Indigenous issues=== The Saugeen First Nation, with offices near Southampton, Ontario, states that the legal name of the band is \"Chippewas of Saugeen\".https://saugeenfirstnation.ca/, Saugeen First Nation Parts of Bruce County (including reservations) are owned by the band.https://www.saugeenlandmgt.com/, Saugeen Land Management In the areas around Sauble Beach and Southampton, some cottages are on land previously owned by a community or the County but now defined as part of the band's Native lands.https://www.saugeenlandmgt.com/, Saugeen Land Management Years earlier, the Saugeen First Nation had successfully reclaimed the land that \"runs south from the Sauble Beach sign toward Southampton, 18 kilometres away\", acccording to one news report.https://www.thespec.com/living- story/6776379-sauble-beach-is-changing-but-it-is-still-a-place-for-family/, Sauble Beach is changing but it is still a place for family A lease relationship exists between the Saugeen First Nation and those who had built seasonal homes on most of the land in the lakeside area between urban Southampton and Sauble Beach.
