    "text": "The 1954 Washington State Cougars football team was an American football team that represented Washington State College during the 1954 college football season. Led by third-year head coach Al Kircher, the team was 4\u20136 overall and 3\u20134 in the Pacific Coast Conference. Three home games were played on campus in Pullman at Rogers Field, with one in Spokane in late September. The Cougars defeated rival Washington for the second straight year, but were shut out at home by neighbor Idaho in the Battle of the Palouse, which was the Vandals' first win in the series in 29 years, since their three-peat in 1925. The Washington rivalry game (now the Apple Cup) was held in Pullman for the first time since 1948 and was the last until 1982; all three were Cougar victories. Of the fifteen games played in Spokane from 1950 through 1980, Washington State won only three (1958, 1968, 1972), while winning five times in Seattle. ==Schedule== ==NFL Draft== Four Cougars were selected in the 1955 NFL Draft, which was thirty rounds (360 selections). {| class=wikitable style=\"text- align:center\" |- |Duke Washington |Back |10 |118 |Philadelphia Eagles |- |Tom Gunnari |Tackle |23 |274 |San Francisco 49ers |- |Bob Peringer |End |27 |317 |Green Bay Packers |- |Bruce Nevitt |Center |27 |319 |Los Angeles Rams |} : *List of Washington State Cougars in the NFL Draft ==References== ==External links== *Game program: Oregon State at WSC \u2013 October 9, 1954 *Game program: Idaho at WSC \u2013 October 23, 1954 *Game program: Washington at WSC \u2013 November 20, 1954 Washington State Category:Washington State Cougars football seasons Category:1954 in sports in Washington (state) ",
