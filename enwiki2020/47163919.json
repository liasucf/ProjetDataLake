Beginning in 2007 he spent 44 months in Taft Correctional Institution in Taft, California, before being re-sentenced to time served in 2010.Bloomberg: CA's Richards' Sentence Cut by Judge to Time Served https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-14/ca-s-richards-s-sentence- cut-by-judge-to-time-served-for-securities-fraud ===Step by step=== On September 22, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud chargesSEC Litigation Release 18891 https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18891.htm against Computer Associates International, Inc., and three executives; Sanjay Kumar \u2013 CEO and Chairman, Stephen Richards \u2013 Executive Vice President, Ira Zar \u2013 Chief Financial Officer and Steven WoghinNew York Times: 2 Years in Prison for Ex- Software Executive https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/17/business/17compute.html?_r=0 \u2013 General Counsel.

The Commission's complaints against defendants Kumar, Richards and Woghin allege that, based on this conduct, they violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10(b)-5 and 13b2-1 thereunder. The complaints further allege that under Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act, Kumar, Richards and Woghin aided and abetted Computer Associates' violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. ===The 35 day month=== The fraud, \"what came to be known by Computer Associates employees as a 35-day month\", involved backdating of contracts to prop up quarterly revenues and earnings figures to meet market expectations. The SEC said the scheme began in 1998, possibly earlier, and continued through September 2000. In all, the company prematurely reported $3.3 billion in revenues from 363 software contracts. This violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, which state that revenues should not be counted until both parties have properly signed a contract. During the four quarters of fiscal 2000, for example, the practice improperly inflated revenues by 25%, 53%, 46% and 22%, respectively. The SEC said the goal was to meet or beat per-share earnings estimates of Wall Street analysts, a key to keeping a company\u2019s stock price rising. The most extreme incident was the second quarter of 2000, when the company reported $557 million in revenues beyond the $1.047 billion it could properly claim. The company thus reported 60 cents in earnings per share, beating the consensus Wall Street forecast of 59 cents. Without the padded revenue, earnings would have been a mere 5 cents per share and the stock price might well have fallen.Wharton University of Pennsylvania: How Serious Was the Fraud at Computer Associates? http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/how-serious-was-the-fraud-at- computer-associates/ In April 2004 Computer Associates International restated $2.2 billion in sales that had improperly during 1999 and 2000.

Leo Glasser.InfoWorld: Former CA Sales Exec Gets Seven Years in Jail http://www.infoworld.com/article/2641878/techology-business/former-ca-sales- exec-gets-seven-years-in-jail.html ;Incarceration: He was incarcerated at Taft Correctional Institution in Taft, California. Due to an error on the part of the Bureau of Prisons, Richards was initially placed in a minimum security prison \u2013 which would have been appropriate given the charges, except that he was not a US citizen \u2013 meaning he was not eligible for minimum security regardless of the crime. He was then placed in solitary confinement for 6 weeks whilst the paper work was processed, after which time he was released into general population with the low security prisoners. ;Re-sentencing: In August 2010 a federal appeals court ordered that he be re-sentenced because the district judge failed to give Richards credit for accepting responsibility for his actions, and in October 2010 his lawyers successfully appealed his original convictions, with Judge Leo Glasser re-sentencing him to time served.AM Law Daily Memorandum Re: Re-Sentencing of Stephen Richards http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:zXxpAFsnRHIJ:amlawdaily.typepad.com/stephen%2520richards%2520--%2520letter.doc+&cd;=1&hl;=en&ct;=clnk\u2277=auNew Zealand Herald: New Zealand's Biggest White Collar Crim Wins Early Release http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/nz-s-biggest-white-collar-crim-wins-early- release-la-jail-131831 ;Release: He was released from Taft Correctional Institute in October 2010.
