He was a military ruler and gained power by deposing Rafael Antonio Guti\u00e9rrez, a man he had previously helped achieve control of the country by taking part in a conspiracy to oust Carlos Ezeta four years earlier. Elected to a four-year term in 1899, he promoted the construction of railways, declared an amnesty for political exiles, and began the construction of the beautiful Santa Ana Theater. Upon leaving office, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador and was appointed Minister of War by his handpicked successor Pedro Jos\u00e9 Escal\u00f3n. During a war against Guatemala in 1906 he led a Salvadoran invasion force and went into battle. Seriously wounded, he soon died on the 11th of June . His coup d'\u00e9tat led to the dissolution of the Greater Republic of Central America after his government withdrew from it.Walker, Thomas W. Nicaragua, the Land of Sandino. Boulder: Westview Press, 1981., p. 17. Regalado was the last in a series of presidents who had come to power by force during the 19th Century. His peaceful transfer of power to Pedro Jos\u00e9 Escal\u00f3n in 1903 allowed for a degree of political stability that persisted until the events of 1931-32. ==References== Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:1861 births Category:1906 deaths Category:People from Santa Ana, El Salvador Category:Leaders who took power by coup Category:Defence ministers of El Salvador Category:Salvadoran military personnel ",
