It also became his tenth number-one on the R&B; chart, and his fourth on the adult contemporary chart; it spent three weeks at the top of both charts, and for the same weeks as on the Hot 100.\"I Just Called to Say I Love You\" topped the Billboard Hot 100, Adult Contemporary, and R&B; charts simultaneously from October 13 to 27, 1984: * * * The song also became Wonder's only solo UK number-one success, staying at the top for six weeks, in the process also becoming Motown Records' biggest-selling single in the UK, a distinction it still held . In addition, the song won both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Original Song. The song also received three nominations at the 27th Grammy Awards for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Instrumental Performance. The song's lyrics have Wonder surprising his love interest with an unexpected telephone call. Throughout the song, Wonder lists events in a yearly calendar that might prompt someone to call a loved one. Yet he explains no special annual event such as New Year's Day or Halloween spurred the call. He simply wants to tell her he loves her from the bottom of his heart. There was a dispute among Wonder, his former writing partner Lee Garrett, and Lloyd Chiate as to who actually wrote the song. Chiate claimed in a lawsuit that he and Garrett wrote the song years before its 1984 release. However, a jury ultimately sided with Wonder. ==Personnel== *Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead and backing vocals, synthesizers, programming, Roland VP-330, LinnDrum, and drums ==Music video== A music video of the song has Wonder, during a concert, singing into a telephone receiver while seated at a piano.
