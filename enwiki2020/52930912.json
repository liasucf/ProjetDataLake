    "text": "Erica Louise Stanford (born Poppelbaum in 1978) is a New Zealand politician and Member of Parliament in the House of Representatives for the National Party. ==Personal life== Stanford lives in Okura in the Auckland region and is the daughter of a Dutch immigrant. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in politics from the University of Auckland, and cites a lecturer, Dr Raymond Miller, as the reason for her passion for politics. She is married, meeting her husband Kane while at Rangitoto College, and has two children. Stanford has worked in export sales as well as producing local television shows. This included being the producer of a reality TV show called Noise Control, in which she and a camera operator followed a noise control team around Auckland. In filming one episode, a person pointed a gun at her and her cameraman; the episode was one of the most watched in the series. She also produced the show Last Chance Dog, and wrote scripts and did other work on Piha Rescue for more than six years. ==Political career== In 2013, Stanford started working in the office of Murray McCully, the MP for . She joined the National Party at the same time. When she started in the office, she worked there two days a week as one of three jobs while also having two children. She later worked there full time, and prior to running for parliament, she held the role of Senior MP Support. Stanford describes McCully as her mentor, calling him \"a political master.\" McCully retired from Parliament in 2017, and the National Party selected Stanford as his replacement for . Stanford had not previously stood for parliament or other office. The East Coast Bays electorate has been a safe seat for National since 1987; since then McCully held either East Coast Bays or , which covered a similar area. In the 2017 general election, Stanford won the electorate easily, with 66% of the vote. In the 2020 election, Stanford stood again for East Coast Bays. During the campaign she also attended a debate of Auckland Central candidates, as National had not selected a new candidate for the electorate by the debate. According to preliminary results, Stanford retained East Coast Bays, albeit with a reduced margin, winning 55% of electorate votes. === Political views === In her maiden speech Stanford spoke on matters of conservation, sustainability, marriage based on love rather than gender, and a desire to see political parties work with one another to seek enduring, practical solutions. In a 2018 interview with a local magazine, she said her priorities in her first term included resourcing police stations in her electorate, improving local roading projects, and supporting local schools. Stanford's political views sit more on the progressive side of the National Party. Stanford supported both the abortion and euthanasia conscience votes in 2019. She has sat on the environmental select committee and has been involved in developing National's environmental policies. In 2019 she supported students who were striking for climate action, despite her party leader and many other National MPs initially opposing them. She believes that the Green Party could work with National, saying that if the Greens \"could just relax a little bit... they could do so much good.\" Stanford says that her blood \"runs blue and it always will\", but acknowledges a touch of green, saying \"maybe it's a tealy blue\". ==References== Category:Living people Category:New Zealand National Party MPs Category:Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:New Zealand women in politics Category:New Zealand MPs for Auckland electorates Category:Women members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:Candidates in the 2017 New Zealand general election Category:1978 births Category:New Zealand people of Dutch descent ",
