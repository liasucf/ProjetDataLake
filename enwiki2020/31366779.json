In group theory, a branch of mathematics, an opposite group is a way to construct a group from another group that allows one to define right action as a special case of left action. Monoids, groups, rings, and algebras can be viewed as categories with a single object. The construction of the opposite category generalizes the opposite group, opposite ring, etc. == Definition == Let G be a group under the operation *. The opposite group of G, denoted G^{\\mathrm{op}}, has the same underlying set as G, and its group operation \\mathbin{\\ast'} is defined by g_1 \\mathbin{\\ast'} g_2 = g_2 * g_1. If G is abelian, then it is equal to its opposite group. Also, every group G (not necessarily abelian) is naturally isomorphic to its opposite group: An isomorphism \\varphi: G \\to G^{\\mathrm{op}} is given by \\varphi(x) = x^{-1}. More generally, any antiautomorphism \\psi: G \\to G gives rise to a corresponding isomorphism \\psi': G \\to G^{\\mathrm{op}} via \\psi'(g)=\\psi(g), since : \\psi'(g * h) = \\psi(g * h) = \\psi(h) * \\psi(g) = \\psi(g) \\mathbin{\\ast'} \\psi(h)=\\psi'(g) \\mathbin{\\ast'} \\psi'(h). == Group action == Let X be an object in some category, and \\rho: G \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(X) be a right action. Then \\rho^{\\mathrm{op}}: G^{\\mathrm{op}} \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(X) is a left action defined by \\rho^{\\mathrm{op}}(g)x = x\\rho(g), or g^{\\mathrm{op}}x = xg. == See also == * Opposite ring * Opposite category == External links == * http://planetmath.org/oppositegroup Category:Group theory Category:Representation theory ",
