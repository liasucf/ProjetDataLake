In 2010, he spent five days in Pyongyang, North Korea with Lord Alton of Liverpool and Baroness Cox of Queensbury, both members of the House of Lords. They met with North Korean officials and summarised their concerns about the nation's human rights abuses. They encouraged officials to invite Marzuki Darusman, who was the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the time, into the country to open prison camps in North Korea to international monitors including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and to suspend executions.

Rogers regularly briefs senior Government ministers and officials, UK Members of Parliament, the European Union, United Nations officials, US Congressional offices and the State Department on human rights and freedom of religion in Asia. He has also testified in hearings at the House of Commons, the European Parliament, the National Diet of Japan and the United States Congress. He has also organised several investigative humanitarian trips to Burma's borders for British and European parliamentarians. He is a regular contributor to international media, including The Wall Street Journal, International Herald Tribune and The Huffington Post. He wrote for the Hong Kong Standard between 2000 and 2002. ===Barred entry to Hong Kong=== On 11 October 2017, Rogers was barred entry to Hong Kong. He arrived at Hong Kong International Airport on a flight from Bangkok but was escorted away by immigration officials and placed on a flight back to Thailand. He had previously been warned by a contact in the Chinese embassy in London that he might be refused entry to Hong Kong. Rogers, who lived in Hong Kong between 1997 and 2002, has criticised China's increasing threat to democracy in Hong Kong and has campaigned against the imprisonment of pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson demanded an explanation from the Hong Kong authorities and the Chinese government. Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, later responded that the move was within China's sovereignty and said: \"Whether this person's trip to Hong Kong involved an intention to intervene in Hong Kong's internal affairs and judicial independence \u2013 he knows very well himself.\" The following day, Rogers announced he would form a non-governmental organization (NGO) to monitor the rule of law and human rights in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Watch was launched at a reception hosted in Speaker's House, House of Commons in the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 11 December 2017. ==Works== ===Books=== * A Land Without Evil: Stopping the Genocide of Burma's Karen People (2004) () * On the Side of Angels: Justice, Human Rights and Kingdom Mission \u2013 with Joseph D'souza (2007) () * Than Shwe: Unmasking Burma's Tyrant (2010, Silkworm Books) () * The Very Stones Cry Out: The Persecuted Church \u2013 Pain, Passion and Praise \u2013 with Baroness Caroline Cox (2011) () * Burma: A Nation at the Crossroads (2012, Random House) () ===Reports=== * Carrying the Cross: The military regime's campaign of restriction, discrimination and persecution against Christians in Burma (CSW, 2007) * Indonesia: Pluralism in Peril \u2013 The Rise of Religious Intolerance Across the Archipelago (CSW, 2014) * Burma's Identity Crisis (CSW, 2019) ==References== Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:British human rights activists Category:British male journalists Category:British expatriates in China Category:British expatriates in East Timor Category:British expatriates in Hong Kong Category:British expatriates in the United States Category:British Roman Catholics Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Anglicanism Category:Journalists from London Category:Alumni of Royal Holloway, University of London Category:Alumni of SOAS University of London ",
