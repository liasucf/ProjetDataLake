Mason in April 1885 as the second Chief Intelligence Officer of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), and while serving in that capacity he fostered closer ties between ONI and the United States Department of State, as they shared a mutual interest in Panama, Samoa, and the Kingdom of Hawaii. His tenure was also marked by ONIs first forays in cryptography, and he further encouraged research into new advances in naval technology through U.S. naval attach\u00e9s, as well as keeping a close watch over European colonial interests in South America. In 1890, the year after his departure from ONI, the Navy transferred ONI from the Bureau of Navigation to the office of the United States Secretary of the Navy, which increased the demand on ONI for information, and despite Rodgerss efforts to make improvements during his tour, a weakness in its gathering of intelligence would be revealed in the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898.Arlington National Cemetery Website: Raymond P. Rodgers, Rear Admiral, United States Navy After leaving ONI in 1889, Rodgers served until 1892 aboard the protected cruiser , which at the time was the flagship of the Squadron of Evolution.

On 6 October 1909, Rodgers became President of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island; he also became Commandant of Naval Station Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, that month.http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/raymondp.htm At the time, the college participated actively in U.S. Navy war planning. Acting on a suggestion by Captain William Ledyard Rodgers \u2013 who had learned it at the United States Army War College \u2013 Raymond P. Rodgers introduced the \"applicability system\" or \"estimate of the situation\" into Navy war planning, requiring that planning be developed through a four-step process involving \"statement of mission, assessment of enemy forces and intentions, assessment of own forces, and evaluation of possible courses of action,\" which has remained fixed in Navy war planning ever since.Miller, p. 16. Toward the end of Rodgers tour, the United States Secretary of the Navy, George von Lengerke Meyer, removed war planning functions from the college, which favored more cautious approaches in plans for war with Japan, placing all planning responsibilities in the more aggressive General Board of the United States Navy.Miller, pp. 24, 46, 70, 80-81.
