    "text": "Musical Revue is a live album featuring Prince Far I and Suns of Arqa released on ROIR Europe in 1988. The album was produced by Phil Rainford and features a live recording of Prince Far I with Suns of Arqa at Band on the Wall in Manchester on 7 December 1982. The sound is fairly rough with Suns of Arqa low in the mix and Prince Far I a little too close. There is much dub mixing, delays, reverbs, and repeats flying left and right, and the music appears improvised in places. The music here is more complex than reggae, sometimes moving towards variations on jazz/highlife (e.g. \"Brujo Magic\"). This album captured Prince Far I's last concert. He was murdered in Kingston, Jamaica in 1983. ==Track listing== # \"Steppin' To The Music\" \u2013 1:33 # \"Throw Away Your Guns\" \u2013 10:15 # \"Brujo Magic\" \u2013 6:15 # \"Version Galore\" \u2013 5:36 # \"83 Struggle\" \u2013 7:48 # \"Trancedance Music\" \u2013 4:34 # \"Foggy Road\" \u2013 4:56 # \"What You Gonna Do On The Judgement Day\" \u2013 8:53 ==Personnel== Prince Far I - Vocals Helen Watson - Vocals Marcel King - Lead Vocal on 'Version Galore', Backing Vocals Snuff - Drums Danny Sheals - Drums Spliff - Bass Wayne Worm - Bass Michael Wadada - Rhythm Guitar Mustaphafakir - Lead Guitar Anton Behrendt - Keyboards Tony Trundel - Fiddle Marek Miczyk - Violin Brian Jones - Saxophone Prince Hammer - MC Keshav Sathe - Tabla ==References== Category:1983 albums Category:Suns of Arqa albums ",
