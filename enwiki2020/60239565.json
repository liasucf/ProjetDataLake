A logistics platform, the company uses predictive load technologies and smart matching to connect carriers with available loads. The company's Series A funding raised a total of $5 million from China Equity Group, Shea Ventures, Simon Nixon and individual investors. The firm raised $21 million in Series B funding in January 2018. Sequoia Capital led the second round of funding. NEXT Trucking's mobile app specializes in drayage solutions designed to streamline the process of moving goods from ports to a shipper's warehouse and ease congestion at the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, which together account for more than 40 percent of containerized imports to the U.S. and 30 percent of exports. In 2019, the firm raised $97 million in Series C funding led by Brookfield Ventures, with participation from Sequoia Capital, GLP, and others. This round of funding brought NEXT's total amount raised to more than $125 million. ==References== Category:Companies based in Los Angeles Category:Privately held companies of the United States Category:Transport companies established in 2015 Category:Transportation companies of the United States ",
