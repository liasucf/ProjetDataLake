As its name suggests, is adjacent to the Victoria Tower, the south-western corner of the Palace of Westminster. The park, which extends southwards from the Palace to Lambeth Bridge, sandwiched between Millbank and the river, also forms part of the Thames Embankment. Victoria Tower Gardens is a Grade II* listed park created in 1864\u20131870, following the embankment of the Thames. It is in a Conservation Area, is partly within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Westminster, and is designated a zone of Monument Saturation. ==History== The site of Victoria Tower Gardens in 1865. The Gardens were created during the 1870s by Joseph Bazalgette, and was part of a project for the Metropolitan Board of Works to provide London with a modern sewerage system. The gardens were later expanded. This expansion was discussed in parliament in 1898 in the 'Victoria Embankment extension and St John's improvement bill'. A number of wharves were compulsorily purchased, including Dorset Wharf (shown on 1885 map) which was purchased from George Taverner Miller, son of Taverner John Miller, from where he ran a \"Sperm Oil Merchants and Spermaceti refining\" business. The effects from this business and others were sold in 1905. ==Features== The park features: *A cast of the sculpture The Burghers of Calais by Auguste Rodin, purchased by the British government in 1911 and positioned in the gardens in 1915. *A 1930 statue of the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst by Arthur George Walker, now entitled the Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst Memorial *The Buxton Memorial Fountain \u2013 originally constructed in Parliament Square, this was removed in 1940 and placed in its present position in 1957. It was commissioned by Charles Buxton MP to commemorate the abolition of slavery in 1834, dedicated to his father Thomas Fowell Buxton, and designed by Gothic architect Samuel Sanders Teulon (1812\u20131873) in 1865. * A stone wall with two modern-style goats with kids \u2013 situated at the southern end of the Gardens. * From 4 to 11 August 2014 the light installation spectra by Japanese artist Ryoji Ikeda was situated in the gardens to commemorate the centenary of the start of the First World War.

At that stage three particular sites were proposed: the Imperial War Museum, Potter's Field near London City Hall, and on Millbank, south of the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. However, in July 2016 it was announced that Victoria Tower Gardens had been chosen for both the memorial and underground learning centre. A design competition was launched, and in October 2017 the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation jury announced their chosen design. The proposed construction will be submitted for planning permission to Westminster City Council who will have to consider breaching their own rules on new monuments in this zone and the effect on heritage views of the Palace of Westminster. The memorial plans attracted strong opposition to the use of this small park, both from the grassroots campaign of local residents through the 'Save Victoria Tower Gardens' and international organisations like the UNESCO advisor ICOMOS. ==Transport== The nearest London Underground stations are Westminster and Pimlico. ==References== ==External links== *Boundary Commission map from 1885 *Waterloo, Westminster, Lambeth map 1896 *Save Victoria Tower Gardens Category:1870s establishments in England Category:Parks and open spaces in the City of Westminster Category:Palace of Westminster ",
