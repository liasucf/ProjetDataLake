    "text": "Omari Johnson (born November 26, 1989) is a Jamaican-American professional basketball player. Johnson played college basketball with the Oregon State Beavers and graduated from high school at Susan Miller Dorsey High School in Los Angeles, California. He has played professional basketball in the NBA, the NBA G League, Canada and Spain. ==High school career== Johnson played high school basketball for Dorsey in Los Angeles. In his junior season, he came off the bench and averaged 11 points and 7 rebounds per game. As a senior, he averaged 18.3 points, 10.1 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game, being named to the All-CIF LA first team. Led by Johnson, Dorsey reached the sectional semifinals of CIF LA. ==College career== Omari Johnson played for Oregon State between 2007 and 2011. After considering offers from Wyoming, South Florida and Long Beach State, Johnson verbally committed to Oregon State. He stated that the fact that Corvallis is a college town was his motive behind choosing Oregon State, along with him feeling needed by his future teammates and having the opportunity to compete against top talent in Pac-10. He achieved a career- high performance in scoring with 19 points as a freshman, as the Beavers lost 76\u201363 to Arizona. He tied that feature as a sophomore, also recording his first double-double, with 10 rebounds, helping his team get past Nebraska with a narrow 64\u201363 win. Although 6-foot-7 when he started college, Johnson grew more than two inches before his junior season to reach a height of 6-foot-9. Coach Craig Robinson expected Johnson to become Oregon State's focal point in offense, but was mainly used as a reserve player due to his sub-par effort on the defensive end. Johnson had a breakout game in the 2010 Civil War rivalry game versus the Oregon Ducks, scoring a season-high 18 points on 4-of-6 three- pointers. In his senior season Johnson achieved a career-high with 13 rebounds, also adding 15 points for his second career double-double, as Oregon State lost 83\u201380 to Seattle. A few days later, he had a career-high 6 steals, also adding 13 points, as Oregon State lost 66\u201360 to Texas Southern. Prior to the game against local rivals Oregon, Johnson commented on his opponents that they are \"a feisty little bunch of dudes.\". Further commenting on the game he said \"They bump us more, you get elbows in the back a little more than other games, it's just physically and verbally more intense.\", but he also clarified \"I wouldn't call 'em dirty\". In four seasons with the Beavers, Johnson appeared in 120 games, starting 67 of them and averaged 6.4 points and 4.0 rebounds per game. ===College statistics=== Source: |- | align=\"left\" | 2007\u201308 | align=\"left\" | Oregon State | 23 || 13 || 21.5 || .392 || .309 || .667 || 4.3 || .4 || .4 || .5 || 7.3 |- | align=\"left\" | 2008\u201309 | align=\"left\" | Oregon State | 34 || 14 || 19.9 || .432 || .344 || .577 || 3.2 || .8 || .5 || .4 || 6.6 |- | align=\"left\" | 2009\u201310 | align=\"left\" | Oregon State | 32|| 10 || 15.5 || .370 || .267 || .677 || 2.6|| .6 || .5 || .2|| 4.7 |- | align=\"left\" | 2010\u201311 | align=\"left\" | Oregon State | 31 || 27 || 26.7 || .459 || .239 || .519 || 6.2 || 1.0 || .8 || .3 || 7.2 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career | 120 || 64 || 20.8 ||.418 ||.293 ||.600||4.0||.7||.6||.3||6.4 |- ==Professional career== ===Oshawa Power (2011\u20132012)=== After graduating from college, Johnson was selected by the Oshawa Power to play in their 2011 pre-season squad.
