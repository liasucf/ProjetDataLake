    "text": "Jean Baptiste Louis George Seroux D'Agincourt (5 April 1730 \u2013 24 September 1814) was a French archaeologist and historian. Born in Beauvais, he was a descendant of the counts of Namur, and in his youth he served as an officer in a regiment of cavalry. Finding it necessary to quit the army in order to take charge of his younger brothers who had been left orphans, he was appointed a farmer-general by Louis XV. In 1777 he visited England, Germany and the Dutch Republic; and in the following year he travelled through Italy, with the view of exploring thoroughly the remains of ancient art. He afterwards settled in Rome and devoted himself to preparing the results of his researches for publication. He died in 1814, leaving the work, which was being issued in parts, unfinished; but it was carried on by M. Gence, and published complete under the title L'Histoire de l'Art par les monuments, depuis sa d\u00e9cadence au quatri\u00e8me si\u00e8cle jusqu'\u00e0 son renouvellement au seizi\u00e8me (6 vols. fol. with 325 plates, Paris, 1823). In the year of his death D'Agincourt published in Paris a Recueil de fragments de sculpture antique, en terre cuite. == References == ==Notes== * Category:People from Beauvais Category:1730 births Category:1814 deaths Category:French archaeologists Category:French art historians Category:18th-century French historians Category:Holders of the office of fermier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ",
