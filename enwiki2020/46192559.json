It is located just outside one set of medieval city walls and the Arco di San Maurizio.

A fountain at the site is documented since 1293, prior to this it was a simple cistern. In 1351, the Biccherna funded construction of the fountain which was only completed in 1452. It has been reconstructed across the ages. The center has a coat of arms (1583) of the Medici.Siena Beniculturali. ==References== Category:Fountains in Siena ",
