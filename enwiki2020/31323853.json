    "text": "Before the Lightning Strikes ()Bevor der Blitz einschl\u00e4gt on DEFA Foundation's website. is an East German comedy film directed by Richard Groschopp. It was released in 1959. ==Plot== Heinz, an ambitious reporter of the Berlin am Morgen newspaper, had made a fatal error when he prepared an article about a locomotive's factory, confusing the successful and motivated Schneider Workers' Brigade with the negligent Schindler Brigade. He also presented the tyrannical manager as a paragon of virtue. Heinz's editor, Christine, decides to send him to the factory for another mission, and this time he should mingle with workers by joining them. Heinz, who takes the new assignment with little enthusiasm, becomes a highly motivated laborer and even manages to influence the Brigades' members to stop quarrelling. He also helps the manager to reconnect with his subordinates. Heinz's second article is welcomed as brilliant. ==Cast== * Christine Laszar as Christine Koch * Horst Drinda as Heinz Engelhardt * Johannes Arpe as Paul Jordan * Margret Homeyer as Otti Sch\u00fctz * Traute Sense as Claudia Lindner * Werner Dissel as Sylvio O.
