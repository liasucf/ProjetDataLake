    "text": "adidas Boost (white) depicted in the midsole of Adidas NMD R1 shoes Boost is a trademarked polymer used by Adidas, in the form of pellets which are compressed and molded for various shoe models the company sells, especially the Ultraboost, Energy Boost and NMD lines of sneakers. The pellets consist of proprietary thermoplastic urethane (TPU) that is formed into a small pill shape. Adidas collaborated with the German chemical company BASF to develop this material. Boost in itself is not a raw material and its characteristic bounciness is obtained by processing the thermoplastic urethane. This material is claimed to be extremely comfortable on the wearer's feet. == History == Prior to its first integration into the Adidas running line in 2013, Adidas Boost was developed as a joint effort by the Adidas Innovation Team and chemists at BASF as an improvement upon what was then the industry standard for sneaker midsoles: ethylene vinyl-acetate, or EVA for short. Adidas saw that EVA was contradictory in its promise for softness and responsiveness in terms of cushioning ability, and therefore sought out to create Boost specifically for delivering comfort and energy return in the same package. == References == Category:Adidas Category:Thermoplastics ",
