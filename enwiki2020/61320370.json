Blackland farmers shipped cotton, wheat, and oats. At the beginning of the 20th century, the population dipped to 50 people. The school in Blackland employed two teachers who taught 79 students. The post office closed in 1903. In 1904, the population bumped up again to 114 people and declined to 14 in 1940. However, its closeness to Rockwall, Texas, the county seat, restricted its growth. The 1990 census showed 49 people still living in the town. The town is considered an historical subject by the Texas State Historical Association, who maintains an article discussing it on their website. === Historical rodeo connection === The 1880s when the town was at its largest happened to coincide with the early days of bronc riding. A Blackland man named William Brooks owned a bucking horse, a stallion named Burgett. One of the bronc riders who rode Burgett was Jim Woods in September 1893. One man, Foghorn Clancy, who witnessed it said later, \"I cannot shut out the picture of the ride Jim Woods had on this great man-killing stallion, in September of 1893, as being one of the greatest rides I have ever seen\". == Modern times== Blackland, Texas, is located in Rockwall County. The town is almost nearly a ghost town. The grist mill, which had a major hand in keeping the town active, is closed.
