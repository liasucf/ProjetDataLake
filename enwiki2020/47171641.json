    "text": "Crosbie Garstin (7 May 1887 \u2013 19 April 1930) was a poet, best-selling novelist and the eldest son of the Newlyn School painter Norman Garstin. He is said to have been \"'untameable as a child\", and to have \"died in mysterious circumstances\" after a boating accident in the Salcombe estuary. He is known for the Penhale trilogy of novels based in 18th-century Cornwall. ==Personal life== Crosbie was born in Mount Vernon, Newlyn, Cornwall to Norman Garstin and Louisa \u2018Dochie\u2019 n\u00e9e Jones. He was the eldest of three children; Denys (later Denis) (1890 \u2013 1918) and Alethea (1894 \u2013 1978). He was educated at Brandon House, Cheltenham, Elstow School, Bedford and in Germany. He was head- boy of his school due to sporting prowess in rugby union and swimming. As a young man he travelled and worked as a bronco buster in Montana, United States and as a lumberjack in Canada. He also travelled to China, Hawaii, Japan and Morocco. On returning home his father, fed-up with Crosbie's inability to get suitable qualifications and hold down a job, sent him to South Africa. From 1912, he ran a cattle ranch in Bechuanaland, and acted as a bush ranger to the Tati Concessions. With the outbreak of the First World War he came back to Britain and in October 1914 joined B Squadron of King Edward's Horse as a private. The cavalry regiment, which was open to colonials, was initially based in Watford and in the following spring, Bishop's Stortford. The regiment left for France on 21 April 1915 and Garstin was promoted to lance corporal shortly before leaving. He was commissioned on the battlefield as a 2nd lieutenant on 14 September 1915, and joined C Squadron, which was attached to the 47th (London) Division at N\u0153ux-les-Mines and was involved in the Battle of Loos and on the Italian Front. In 1916 he was posted to Dublin as an Intelligence Officer during the rebellion there. As well as writing poetry he made contributions to Punch which were well received. Garstin disappeared when returning from a party to a friend's yacht Osprey in the Salcombe estuary on 19 April 1930. The rowing boat capsized and his body was never found despite Garstin being a strong swimmer and other two occupants of the boat surviving. He left an estate of gross value \u00a33,424, and \u00a31,549 net. His widow, Lillian (n\u00e9e Barkworth) was mayor of Penzance in 1962\u201363. ==Works== * Up the Line to Death \u2013 contributor to the poetry anthology * Vagabond Verses (1917) * The Mud Larks (1918) * The Sunshine Settlers (1918) * The Mud Larks Again (1919) * The Black Knight \u2013 with Mrs Alfred Sidgwick (1920) * The Ballad of the Royal Ann (1922) * The Coasts of Romance (1922) * The Owls\u2019 House \u2013 Penhale trilogy, book 1 (1923) * Samuel Kelly, an Eighteenth Century Seaman \u2013 editor (1925) * High Noon \u2013 Penhale trilogy, book 2 (1925) * The West Wind \u2013 Penhale trilogy, book 3 (1926) * The Dragon and the Lotus (1928) * Houp-la!
