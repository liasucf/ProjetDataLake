    "text": "Postcards from Buster is a children's television series containing both live action and animation that originally aired on PBS. It is a spin-off of the Arthur TV series. The show stars Arthur's best friend, 8-year-old anthropomorphic rabbit Buster Baxter. Based by a backdoor pilot episode of Arthur entitled \"Postcards from Buster\", the television series was created by Cookie Jar Group (now known as DHX Media), WGBH Boston and Marc Brown Studios. The pilot was aired on December 22, 2003 as an episode of Arthur. The official series aired from October 11, 2004 to February 24, 2012, on PBS Kids and PBS Kids Go!. Buster's interests include eating anything, reading comic books, and playing video games. Buster's personality is that of a fairly intelligent and curious child. He also believes that extraterrestrials are real. Buster's parents are divorced; in this series, Buster is seen with his father, Bo Baxter. Arthur Read and many other characters from the PBS Kids animated television series Arthur make cameo appearances in this series, and most episodes have an Arthur character playing a minor role. The series went on hiatus between November 2008 and February 2012. ==Overview== Postcards from Buster centered on Buster traveling to different places around North America and worldwide, usually in the United States but also in the Caribbean, Canada and other places, with his father, who is a pilot for a band of musicians. In each episode, Buster meets children in the location, who show him views of their real-life families and global culture. The sequences with Buster are animated, while the portions featuring the children are live-action (viewed from the viewpoint of Buster's video camcorder). After each location, Buster sends to Arthur a \"video postcard\" video tape summarizing what he's done and who he's met in each location. The children and their families that appeared on the series are meant to be multicultural and diverse, and range from a Mormon family in Utah to a Mestizo family in Texas. ==Episodes== ==Voice actors and their characters== * Daniel Brochu \u2013 Buster Baxter * Ellen David \u2013 Bitzi Baxter * Marcel Jeannin \u2013 Bo Baxter * Elyzabeth Diaga (season 1) and Stephanie Martin (seasons 2\u20133) \u2013 Mora of Los Viajeros * Norman Groulx (season 1) and Glenn Coulson (seasons 2\u20133) \u2013 Carlos of Los Viajeros * Cameron Ansell (seasons 1\u20132) and Dallas Jokic (season 3) \u2013 Arthur Read * Jason Szwimmer (seasons 1\u20132) and Robert Naylor (season 3) \u2013 D.W.

This includes Buster's Outdoor Journeys (featuring episodes Sugartime, Meet Me at the Fair, The Giant Pumpkins and Bayou by Me), Buster's Got the Beat (featuring episodes Beats by the Bay, Buster and Beatrice, The Music Mystery and Buster's Sweet Song), Buster's Buddies (featuring episodes Buster's League of Champions, Best Friends, A Sense of Direction and Sleepy in Seattle) and Buster's World of Sports (featuring episodes Winter Gold, Swimming in the Desert, Rock and Roll and Rodeo Cowgirl). VHS releases, however, only include the first two episodes from the DVDs. On October 12, 2010, Mill Creek Entertainment released the complete first season on DVD in Region 1. For some unknown reason, the cover art for the DVD states that this is 'The complete series', when in fact it is not as there are 16 more episodes. ==Criticism and controversy== In January 2005, Margaret Spellings, United States Secretary of Education, revealed that the show had explored same-sex marriage. Episode #33, \"Sugartime!\", which features Buster visiting Hinesburg, Vermont, to learn about the production of maple sugar, includes Buster meeting several children who have lesbian parents. Vermont was one of the first states to legalize civil unions for same-sex couples. In the episode, the word lesbian or homosexual is never said, and the episode \u2014 like all Postcards episodes \u2014 has no sexual content. Buster meets the children and comments, \"Boy, that's a lot of moms!\"; one girl mentions her \"mom and stepmom,\" adding that she loves her stepmother very much, and no other comments are made about the couple. PBS vice president of media relations Lea Sloan said at the time, \"The fact that there is a family structure that is objectionable to the Department of Education is not at all the focus of the show, nor is it addressed in the show.\" Spellings demanded that PBS return all federal funding that had been used in the production of the episode, claiming that \"many parents would not want their young children exposed to the lifestyles portrayed in this episode.\" PBS decided not to air this episode, but some member stations across the country chose to air the episode, including WNET in New York, KCET in Los Angeles, and KERA in Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, which are flagship stations; and the show's co-producer, WGBH in Boston (which distributed the episode directly to public television stations after PBS's decision). It was, however, included in both the VHS and DVD version of the collection \"Buster's Outdoor Journeys\" which was distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment. Some of these stations opted to air this episode in prime- time, with some following the episode with a local discussion on the controversy. Shortly after the controversy, PBS's CEO announced she would step down when her contract expired in 2006. Cusi Cram, a writer for Arthur, later wrote a play titled Dusty and the Big Bad World, based on this controversy. ==References== ==External links== * * * Online NewsHour article covering the Sugartime! controversy Category:2000s American animated television series Category:2010s American animated television series Category:2004 American television series debuts Category:2012 American television series endings Category:2000s Canadian animated television series Category:2010s Canadian animated television series Category:2004 Canadian television series debuts Category:2012 Canadian television series endings Category:PBS original programming Category:American animated television spin-offs Category:Canadian animated television spin-offs Category:Canadian children's animated adventure television series Category:Canadian children's animated comedy television series Category:Canadian children's animated fantasy television series Category:Canadian television shows based on children's books Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated comedy television series Category:American children's animated fantasy television series Category:American television shows based on children's books Category:Television series by WGBH Category:Television series by Cookie Jar Entertainment Category:Television series produced in Ontario Category:Television series produced in Massachusetts Category:Television shows set in New York City Category:Television shows set in Chicago Category:PBS Kids shows Category:Arthur (TV series) Category:American animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Canadian animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:American television series with live action and animation Category:Canadian television series with live action and animation Category:Animated television series about children Category:Animated television series about rabbits and hares ",
