    "text": "The British Haiku Society (BHS) was formed in 1990 and aims to promote haiku and to teach and publish Haiku in English. ==Activities== The BHS holds an Annual Haiku Award. From the 1990s until 2004 the Society also offered a Sasakawa Prize. In 1992 the BHS published The Haiku Hundred, an anthology of haiku in English to bring haiku to the attention of UK readers. In 2009, the then president of the society, Annie Bachini, complained about the quality of haiku being submitted to a haiku string competition where the winning entries, which were flashed on a screen at London King's Cross railway station, were judged by Yoko Ono and Jackie Kay. The London Haiku Group meets under the auspices of the BHS and covers London and the South East of England. ==Publications== ===Journal=== The journal of the BHS is Blithe Spirit, which was named in honour of Reginald Horace Blyth and is currently edited by Caroline Skanne.
