Lines are blown left and right, cuts within scenes don't match, and the performances would be unacceptable in a home movie ... If you've ever wondered what it's like at the bottom of the barrel, this film will take you on a guided tour.\"Kart, Larry (March 23, 1981). \"'Dirty Tricks' hits bottom\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 4. Variety wrote, \"Despite the efforts of a willing and able cast, 'Dirty Tricks' flounders as a would-be chase comedy, done in by lame writing and misjudged direction.\"\"Film Reviews: Dirty Tricks\". Variety. June 3, 1981. 14. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times stated, \"Elliott Gould is such fun and so full of sweet mischief in 'Dirty Tricks' (selected theaters) it's a shame that it wastes both him and an amusing premise ... There are lot of car chases ending in routinely spectacular crashes, lots of trite spoofing of the Mafia and the FBI and lots of bloody violence, all of which is scarcely amusing.\"Thomas, Kevin (May 1, 1981). \"Mischief of Gould in 'Dirty Tricks'\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 10. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called the film \"so shabby that it almost makes 'Foul Play' look classy.\"Arnold, Gary (November 20, 1981). \"Reaching for Laughs in the Halls of Academe\". The Washington Post. C3. David Macfarlane of Maclean's wrote, \"Dirty Tricks is crass, witless and boring. Its humor is invariably sexist, its violence gratuitous. The acting is abysmal, the screenplay atrocious, and the direction beyond the pale. Any film that is little more than a vehicle for Gould's just-got-out-of-bed-where's-the-coffee style is obviously in very big trouble.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1981 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Boston Category:American comedy films Category:1981 comedy films Category:Films directed by Alvin Rakoff Category:Embassy Pictures films ",
