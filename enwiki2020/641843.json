The area surrounding the town is known as the Granite Belt. ==Geography== Stanthorpe lies on the New England Highway near the New South Wales border from Brisbane via Warwick, north of Tenterfield and 811 m above sea level. Stanthorpe was developed around Quart Pot Creek which meanders from south-east through the centre of town and then out through the south-west, where its confluence with Spring Creek forms the Severn River. Quart Pot Creek forms part of the south-western boundary of the locality, while the Severn River forms part of the south-western boundary. The New England Highway passes through the town from Applethorpe to the north to Severnlea in the south. Originally it passed through the town centre along the main street, Maryland Street. However, it now bypasses to the west of the main developed area of the town. The Stanthorpe-Texas Road connects Stanthorpe to Broadwater to the west and then travels south-west to Texas. The land within the boundaries of Stanthorpe is primarily used for urban purposes: housing, recreational, commercial and industrial with some undeveloped land on the hillier slopes. Although an agricultural centre of the Granite Belt, there is little agriculture within the town's boundaries. Crops grown in the surrounding area include vegetables, apples, grapes and stone fruit. Wine is also produced in the area, and sheep and cattle grazing is also prevalent. The town lies in the valley of Quart Pot Creek and its tributary Funkers Gap Creek () at above sea level. Lees Hill is the south of the town () and rises to . Mount Banca is to the north-west of the town () and rises to , while Mount Marlay is to the north-east of the town () and rises to . ==History== Stanthorpe Post Office, 2015 Coat of arms, Stanthorpe Post Office, 2015 Father Jerome Davadi, promoter of wine growing in the Stanthorpe area Stanthorpe was founded by tin miners. People came from many countries to mine tin from 1872. Prior to 1872 this area boasted some large pastoral runs and a few prospectors in bark huts. At that time, the area was known as 'Quart Pot Creek'. The Private Township of Stannum existed in the area along one side of the present main street. With the discovery of tin and the influx of miners and new businesses, a 'more suitable' name was sought by the town fathers. Thus, Stanthorpe became the name which encompassed all, as this area became for a time, the largest alluvial tin mining and mineral field in Queensland. Stanthorpe literally means 'tintown', as Stannum is Latin for 'tin' and thorpe is Middle English for 'village'. The Queensland Surveyor General, Augustus Charles Gregory, is credited with coining the name in 1872. When the tin prices fell, many miners turned to farming. The subtropical highland climate was very suitable for growing cool climate fruits and vegetables. Grapes were first planted here in the 1860s with encouragement from the local Catholic parish priest Father Jerome Davadi to produce altar wine. His Italian descent made grape growing and wine production a familiar pastime and the notion caught on in the area. There were plenty of Italian settlers and wine was made for home enjoyment. Mount Marlay was named after Edward Marlay, a selector and tin miner. On 3 July 1827 he purchased Allotment 1, Section 1 in the Town of Stanthorpe. St Joseph's Catholic School was established in October 1872 by four Sisters of Mercy: Sisters M Agnes, Emilian, Muredach and Malachy. Stanthorpe State School opened on 9 March 1874. The railway reached Stanthorpe in May 1881. The Post Office with a clock tower and an elaborate coat of arms was constructed in Maryland Street in 1901 in the Arts and Crafts style. Following Federation, the Commonwealth Government took charge of post and telegraphic services. However, they contracted the construction of post offices in Queensland to the Public Works Department of the Queensland Government and the Stanthorpe Post Office is believed to be one of the first ordered by the Commonwealth Government. It was designed by the first Commonwealth Government Architect John Smith Murdoch. The cool dry climate was valued as an aid to health from the early nineteenth century especially for those suffering from tuberculosis or chest conditions. Following the First World War, Stanthorpe was a major resettlement area for soldiers recovering from mustard gas exposure. Many of these Soldier Settlers took up the land leased to them in the areas around Stanthorpe which now bear the names of First World War battlefields. Stanthorpe State High School opened on 23 January 1961. Stanthorpe Adventist Primary School opened on 25 January 1982 and closed on 2002. The College of Wine Tourism was opened in 2007.
