    "text": "Bromham and Rowde Halt was the railway station serving Bromham and Rowde in Wiltshire, England between 1909 and 1966. The station was a stop on the Devizes Branch Line, between Seend and Devizes. The single-platform halt was at Sells Green in the northeast of Seend parish, close to the Devizes\u2013Melksham road. It handled vegetables grown in the Bromham area, as well as milk. After the completion of the Devizes line in 1858, the junction at Holt allowed the fastest route from London to the West Country. However the Devizes line lost to competition and returned to a branch line in 1900. == Closure == Bromham and Rowde suffered from reduced traffic after the completion of the Patney and Chirton-Westbury line, that by-passed the Devizes Branch Line to shorten the London to Bristol journey by five miles. As a result, Bromham and Rowde later lost its stationmaster in 1952. The line and the halt were closed in 1966 under the Beeching cuts and the station was demolished in 1970. == Sources == * * Category:Disused railway stations in Wiltshire Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1909 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1966 Category:Beeching closures in England ",
