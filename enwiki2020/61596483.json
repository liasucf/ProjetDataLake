    "text": "Drag Queen Story Hour (DQSH), Drag Queen Storytime, and Drag Story Time are children\u2019s events first started in 2015 by author and activist Michelle Tea in San Francisco with the goals to \u201cinspire a love of reading, while teaching deeper lessons on diversity, self-love and an appreciation of others.\u201d The events, usually geared for children aged 3\u201311, are hosted by drag queens who read children\u2019s books, and engage in other learning activities in public libraries. The DQSH concept is seen as unconventional as the libraries are usually more reserved, and the queens traditionally are associated with bars and nightlife. Jonathan Hamilt, who co-founded the New York chapter as a nonprofit, said that as of June 2019, DQSH has 35 U.S. and five international chapters. The program strives to \u201cinstill the imagination and play of gender fluidity of childhood and gives kids glamorous, positive, and unabashedly queer role models.\u201d According to ThinkProgress, \u201cit has been a common tactic among the far right to disrupt DQSH.\u201d == History == Drag Queen Story Hour started in 2015 in San Francisco, and was created by author Michelle Tea, then the Executive Director of the nonprofit Radar Productions; the first events were organized by Juli Delgado Lopera and Virgie Tovar. Tea, who identifies as queer, came up with the idea after attending children's library events with her newborn son and finding them welcoming but heteronormative. She imagined an event that was more inclusive and affirming to LGBTQ families. The first event was held at the Eureka Valley/Harvey Milk Memorial Branch Library in the LGBT Castro neighborhood of San Francisco and featured drag queen Persia and was well received. Other early DQSH events in San Francisco featured several drag queens of color, including Honey Mahogany, Yves St. Croissant, and Panda Dulce. As of February 2020, there are 50+ official chapters of DQSH, spread internationally, as well as other drag artists holding reading events at libraries, schools, bookstores, and museums. In 2017 the New York chapter incorporated as a non-profit and has received funds from the New York Public Library, Brooklyn Public Library, and two city council members. The funds buy books, some DQSH events do book giveaways, go for paying the queens, and training to ensure the queens \u201ctalk effectively to children and their parents about gender identity and drag.\u201d The books read include children's classics and works featuring LGBT characters and issues. One popular book at DQSH is This Day in June, written by Gayle Pitman and illustrated by Kristyna Litten, which introduces the reader to the idea of an LGBTQ pride parade. Pitman also authored Sewing the Rainbow, about rainbow flag creator Gilbert Baker, she is also on faculty at Sacramento City College teaching psychology and women and gender studies. She feels it important to teach LGBTQ kids, including children in LGBTQ families, about subjects outside two tropes she's seen: gay and lesbian parents; and gender non-conforming children, like in 10,000 Dresses. Pitman feels that children are smarter than given credit for, and can understand complex issues like intersex bodies, if the explanation is simplified. In March 2020, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic which has accompanying shelter in place and avoid group gatherings orders, DQSHs are among events postponed. Nina West and other drag queens have started live- streaming readings. West authored the children\u2019s album Drag Is Magic, featured RED: A Crayon Story by Michael Hall as the first book of the online series. RED is about \u201ca crayon who suffers an identity crisis when he is labeled wrong.\u201d ==Reception== Some of the DQSH events have met with opposition towards the drag queens, and the books being read. The DQSH concept is seen as unconventional as the libraries are usually more reserved, and the queens traditionally are associated with bars and nightlife. An event organizer and performer noted, \u201cJust like an actor can do an R-rated movie and a G-rated kids\u2019 movie, we have different levels of how we entertain and how we can put on our character as well.\u201d John Casey, an adjunct professor at Wagner College in New York City, posits in The Advocate, In a May 2019 First Things article and a subsequent debate with David A. French, Sohrab Ahmari argued that drag queen story hours presented a challenge to proponents of \"conservative liberalism\" who emphasized personal autonomy and opposed \"the use of the public power to advance the common good, including in the realm of public morality\". Steven Greenhut responded in a Whittier Daily News editorial that, although he perceived the story hours to be \"bizarre and agenda driven\", banning them would be an overreach of governmental power and an attempt to legislate morality. In August 2019, a petition by LifeSiteNews and Personhood Alliance, both anti-abortion activism groups, asked the American Library Association (ALA) to stop promoting the story hours; it gathered nearly 100,000 signatures. The ALA responded by affirming its support for DQSH events, stating that it \"strongly opposes any effort to limit access to information, ideas and programmes that patrons wish to explore\" and \"includes a commitment to combating marginalisation and underrepresentation within the communities served by libraries through increased understanding of the effects of historical exclusion.\" According to ThinkProgress, \u201cit has been a common tactic among the far right to disrupt DQSH\". In April 2019, two members of the white nationalist group American Identity Movement (formerly Identity Evropa) dressed as clowns and disrupted a DQSH in New Orleans, Louisiana. In June 2019, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)\u2014an organization that monitors and reports on anti-LGBTQ hate groups\u2014released \u201cWhite Nationalist Threats Against Transgender People Are Escalating\u201d reporting \u201cwhite nationalist and former U.S. Congressional candidate Paul Nehlen announced on June 19 a plan he called 'PROJECT DOX TRANNY STORYTIME.'\" Using Telegram, which SPLC characterized as \u201ca platform favored by white nationalists and terrorists,\u201d he urged followers to gather photos and vehicle license plates of DQSH participants for doxing, the Internet-based practice of researching and broadcasting private or identifying information (especially personally identifying information) about an individual. The SPLC sees conflating DQSH with the increasing public support for LGBTQ people\u2014specifically transgender people\u2014and culture as the reason \u201ctransphobic rhetoric, some of it violent,\u201d has \u201c[increased] among white nationalists and neo-Nazis.\u201d According to the SPLC, \u201cfor far-right extremists, the increased visibility of transgender people is a sign of the growing \u2018degeneracy\u2019\u201d from \u201cleftists and Jews as part of an assault on white, Christian families and strict gender roles.\u201d The extremists \u201cbelieve that trans people, like immigrants and non-whites, are hastening the destruction of an idealized white, Western culture.\u201d An anonymous Telegram poster also called for doxing participants. The SPLC reported that events such as DQSH were \"a big draw for far-right extremists\". In September 2019, Family Research Council, designated as an anti-gay hate group by the SPLC, sent out a daily prayer email in which they described DQSH as child grooming. They cited Romans 1:18\u201332, which LGBTQ Nation interpreted as \"[calling] for death\". === Drag queens entertaining children, and gender expression === Nina West, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race season eleven contestant and winner of Miss Congeniality, and producer of Drag Is Magic, an EP of kids music about the art form, says she hopes to inspire them to \u201cdream big, be kind, and be their perfect selves.\u201d West feels drag is \u201can opportunity for children to get creative and think outside the boxes us silly adults have crafted for them.\u201d Marti Gould Cummings said something similar when a video of them performing \u201cBaby Shark\u201d at a drag brunch went viral. \u201cAnyone who thinks drag isn\u2019t for children is wrong,\u201d said Cummings, \u201cDrag is expression, and children are such judgment-free beings; they don\u2019t really care what you\u2019re wearing, just what you\u2019re performing.\u201d As of May 2019, the video has been viewed over 806,000 times. West\u2019s responded to critics who question if children are too young to experience drag, saying, \u201cDrag is an opportunity for anyone \u2013 including and especially children \u2013 to reconsider the masks we are all forced to wear daily.\u201d West added, \u201cChildren are inundated with implicit imagery from media about what is \u2018boy\u2019 and what is \u2018girl.\u2019 And I believe that almost all kids are really less concerned about playing with a toy that's supposedly aligned to their gender, and more concerned with playing with toys that speak to them.\u201d The New York Times noted \u201cLaura Edwards-Leeper, a clinical psychologist in Oregon who works with queer and trans kids, said that experimenting with gender expression isn\u2019t necessarily linked to being queer or trans. 'It\u2019s normal at basically any age for boys to dress up as princesses and girls in male superhero outfits,' she said. What's changed is parenting. 'When there\u2019s no judgment, kids are more likely to feel free to explore,' Dr. Edwards-Leeper said.\u201d == See also == * Picture books * Early reader * Chapter books * Young adult fiction * List of drag groups * List of drag kings * List of drag queens * Banned Books Week * Lists of banned books ==References== == External links == * American Library Association resources for Drag Queen Story Hour * Official site Category:Public libraries Category:Drag events Category:Social phenomena Category:Controversies in the United States ",
