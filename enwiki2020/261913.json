    "text": "The Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) is a college athletic conference which competes in NCAA Division III. All 13 of the member schools are located in Minnesota and are private institutions, with only two being non-sectarian. ==History== On March 15, 1920, a formal constitution was adopted and the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference with founding members Carleton College, Gustavus Adolphus College, Hamline University, Macalester College, Saint John's University, St. Olaf College, and the College of St. Thomas (now University of St. Thomas). Concordia College joined the MIAC in 1921, Augsburg University in 1924, and Saint Mary's University in 1926. Carleton dropped membership in 1925, rejoining in 1983. St. Olaf left in 1950, returning in 1975. The University of Minnesota Duluth was a member of the MIAC from 1950 to 1975. Bethel University joined in 1978. The MIAC initiated women's competition in the 1981\u201382 season. Two all-women's schools subsequently joined the conference, St. Catherine University in 1983 and the College of St. Benedict in 1985. The conference did not play sports from the fall 1943 to the spring of 1945 due to World War II. Saint Mary's discontinued its football program in 1955. Macalester football left the conference in 2002, but still retains its MIAC membership in other sports. St. Catherine and St. Benedict, being both women's colleges, also do not sponsor football. Together with Saint John's, one of only a handful of men's colleges, St. Benedict forms a joint academic institution, known commonly by the initialism CSB/SJU. From 1947 to 2003 the MIAC had a strong men's wrestling program, which was discontinued following the 2002\u201303 season. The strongest teams over the history of the conference were Augsburg with 31 team championships, and Saint John's with 14 team championships. The MIAC teams and individual wrestlers demonstrated a strong national and Olympic presence in the 1970s and beyond. On May 22, 2019, the University of St. Thomas was involuntarily removed from the MIAC effective at the end of spring 2021, and on May 28, 2020, the conference announced the addition of the College of St. Scholastica after leaving the Upper Midwest Athletic Conference also in 2021. ==Member schools== ===Current members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Institution !Nickname !Location (Minnesota) !Founded !Type !Undergrad Enrollment !Colors !Joined |- |Augsburg University |Auggies |Minneapolis | align=center| 1869 |Private/Lutheran (ELCA) | align=center| 2,550 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | align=center| 1924 |- |Bethel University |Royals |Arden Hills | align=center| 1871 |Private/Converge | align=center| 2,965 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | align=center| 1977 |- |Carleton College |Knights |Northfield | align=center| 1866 |Private/Non-Sectarian | align=center| 2,105 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | align=center| 1920, 19831 |- |Concordia College |Cobbers |Moorhead | align=center| 1891 |Private/Lutheran (ELCA) | align=center| 2,114 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | align=center| 1921 |- |Gustavus Adolphus College |Gusties |St. Peter | align=center| 1862 |Private/Lutheran (ELCA) | align=center| 2,230 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | align=center| 1920 |- |Hamline University |Pipers |St. Paul | align=center| 1854 |Private/Methodist (UMC) | align=center| 2,184 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | align=center| 1920 |- |Macalester College2 |Scots |St. Paul | align=center| 1874 |Private/Non- Sectarian | align=center| 2,146 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | align=center| 1920 |- |College of Saint Benedict3 |Bennies |St. Joseph | align=center| 1913 |Private/Catholic | align=center| 1,958 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | align=center| 1985 |- |St. Catherine University3 |Wildcats |St. Paul | align=center| 1905 |Private/Catholic | align=center| 3,176 | style=\"text- align:right;\" | | align=center| 1983 |- |Saint John's University4 |Johnnies |Collegeville | align=center| 1857 |Private/Catholic | align=center| 1,754 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | align=center| 1920 |- |Saint Mary's University |Cardinals |Winona | align=center| 1912 |Private/Catholic | align=center| 1,590 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | align=center| 1926 |- |St. Olaf College |Oles |Northfield | align=center| 1874 |Private/Lutheran (ELCA) | align=center| 3,040 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | align=center| 1920, 19755 |- |University of Saint Thomas |Tommies |St. Paul | align=center| 1885 |Private/Catholic | align=center| 6,199 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | | align=center| 1920 |} # Carleton left the MIAC after the 1924\u201325 season, and re-joined in the 1983\u201384 season. # Macalester will rejoin the conference in football beginning in 2021.
