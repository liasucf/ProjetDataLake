    "text": "KIII, virtual channel 3 (VHF digital channel 8), is an ABC-affiliated television station licensed to Corpus Christi, Texas, United States. The station is owned by Tegna Inc. KIII's studios are located on South Padre Island Drive (SH 358) in Corpus Christi, and its transmitter is located near Robstown, Texas. On cable, KIII is available on Charter Spectrum and Grande Communications channel 5. ==History== ===KVDO=== The station was originally launched in 1954 as KVDO-TV, broadcasting on channel 22 as the Corpus Christi market's first television station. KVDO was a primary affiliate of the DuMont network,\"Around the Dial with Dorothy Stanich\". Corpus Christi Times, May 3, 1964. but carried secondary affiliations with NBC until KRIS-TV took the air in May 1956, CBS until KZTV signed on in September 1956,\"KVDO gets CBS Cable Service\". Corpus Christi Times, July 15, 1956. and ABC.\"ABC 'Racket Squad' Sold in Two Languages\". Billboard, January 19, 1957. It was one of several television stations across the United States that took part in a 1956 lawsuit to prevent VHF stations from being added in their markets, on the grounds that UHF stations in that era typically suffered financially or even went out of business entirely if they had any VHF competition.\"Court Is Asked to Keep TV Stations Off Air\". Elwood Call-Leader, April 19, 1956. The lawsuit was unsuccessful, however, and KRIS and KZTV were both on air as VHF stations by fall 1956. Around the same time as the VHF stations were launched, as well, the DuMont network collapsed. KVDO carried on as an independent station, and was sold to H. J. Schmidt's South Texas Telecasting Company in April 1957.\"TV Sale Okayed\". Austin American-Statesman, April 5, 1957. It temporarily suspended broadcast operations in August pending what was announced at the time as a reorganization of its studio layout,\"KCCT Has New Link Transmitter\". Corpus Christi Caller-Times, August 24, 1957. but a federal tax lien was filed against the station by the Bureau of Internal Revenue in September.\"Federal Tax Lien Filed Against KVDO\". Corpus Christi Caller-Times, September 26, 1957. In October the station received FCC approval to stay off the air until January 1958,\"KVDO-TV Gets Extension of Time Off Air\". Corpus Christi Caller-Times, October 16, 1957. but by November 1957, the former KVDO studio had been sold to KRIS-TV,\"KRIS-TV Starts Operating In New Studio Tomorrow\". Corpus Christi Caller-Times, November 14, 1957. and the station did not relaunch. ===Dormancy and relaunch as KIII=== Following the demise of the original KVDO, South Texas Telecasting petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to add a third VHF allocation on Channel 3 at Corpus Christi due to KVDO's failure as a UHF station. Other cities also wanted the Channel 3 allocation; however, following a lot of struggle, channel 3 was ultimately allocated to Corpus Christi, and hearings to award the channel began in 1961.\"FCC To Begin Oral Hearings Monday on Channel Three\". Corpus Christi Caller-Times, November 12, 1961. South Texas Telecasting was one of three applicants for the channel, alongside Nueces Telecasting and the Corpus Christi Caller-Times,\"Oilman Is Principal In TV Application\". Corpus Christi Caller-Times, July 28, 1960. but the Caller-Times withdrew its application in 1962 after its owner, Harte-Hanks Newspapers, acquired the San Antonio Express-News.\"Caller-Times Will Drop TV Station Application\". Corpus Christi Caller-Times, April 16, 1962. South Texas Telecasting was awarded channel 3 in December 1962,\"FCC Examiner Recommends that KVDO Get Channel 3\". Corpus Christi Caller-Times, December 4, 1962. but Nueces Telecasting then filed a protest alleging that awarding the channel to South Texas Telecasting would violate the FCC's regulations on concentration of media ownership.\"Channel 3 Deadline For Reply Extended\". Corpus Christi Caller-Times, February 11, 1963. Nueces withdrew its petition in June 1963 after South Texas Telecasting agreed to pay the company $40,000.\"Channel 3 TV Competitor Withdraws Its Application\". Corpus Christi Caller-Times, June 28, 1963. ===KIII=== The station relaunched on May 4, 1964 as a full ABC affiliate,\"Open House Slated Today At New Station, KIII-TV\". Corpus Christi Caller-Times, May 10, 1964. and retains that network affiliation today. It was originally planned to retain the original KVDO call sign, but its call sign was changed to KIII by the time it launched. South Texas Telecasting, which had by this time added Clinton D. McKinnon as its major stockholder and executive vice president but still retained most of its original board of directors, later evolved into McKinnon Broadcasting, who remained the station's owners until 2010. In 1969, KIII started a satellite in Victoria, Texas, KXIX (channel 19), to bring ABC programming to that area. In 1976, KXIX was sold to local ownership. It now operates as Fox affiliate KVCT. On April 29, 2010 it was announced that KIII would be acquired by London Broadcasting Company.http://www.caller.com/news/2010/apr/29/dallas-based-company-to-buy- kiii-tv/ which the sale was closed on August 31.http://www.caller.com/news/2010/aug/31/dallas-company-buys-kiii- tv/?partner=newsletter_headlines On September 18, 2011, KIII began broadcasting newscasts in high definition. On May 14, 2014, the Gannett Company announced that it would acquire KIII and five other LBC stations for $215 million. Gannett's CEO Gracia Martore touted that the acquisition would give the company a presence in several fast-growing markets, and opportunities for local advertisers to leverage its digital marketing platform. The company also owns fellow Texas ABC affiliates WFAA and KVUE, which it had acquired in its purchase of Belo Corporation. The sale was completed on July 8.Gannett Completes London Broadcasting Buy, TVNewsCheck, Retrieved 8 July 2014. 13 months later, on June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. KIII was retained by the latter company, named Tegna. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Channel ! Video ! Aspect !

The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 8. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 3. ==Programming== KIII carries the entire ABC schedule, with a half- hour delay on Friday late-night programming during the UIL/TAPPS high school football season for an extended newscast with Friday night highlights. Syndicated programming on KIII includes The Big Bang Theory, Live with Kelly and Ryan, Wheel of Fortune, and Modern Family. Corpus Christi is one of the few television markets to carry both Wheel and Jeopardy! on separate stations; Jeopardy! airs on NBC affiliate KRIS-TV. ==News operation== KIII currently airs 21\u00bd hours of local news programming each week (with 3\u00bd hours each weekday and two hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station also produces its own high school football highlight show when in season; the program airs on Fridays immediately after the 10 p.m. newscast. The station has been rated #1 consistently, beating its nearest competitor, KRIS by a significant margin. ==References== ==External links== *Official site *TV Programming Guide * * Category:Television channels and stations established in 1964 Category:ABC network affiliates Category:MeTV affiliates Category:Cozi TV affiliates III Category:Tegna Inc.
