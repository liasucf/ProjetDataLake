One was published to accompany his obituary by Morrison (1975). Robert Charles Zaehner (1913\u20131974) was a British academic whose field of study was Eastern religions. He understood the original language of many sacred texts, e.g., Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic. Earlier, starting in World War II, he had served as an intelligence officer in Iran. At Oxford University his first writings had been on the Zoroastrian religion and its texts. Appointed Spalding Professor, his books addressed such subjects as mystical experience (articulating a widely cited typology), Hinduism, comparative religion, Christianity and other religions, and ethics. He translated the Bhagavad-Gita, providing an extensive commentary based on Hindu tradition and sources. His last books addressed similar issues in popular culture, which led to his talks on the BBC. He published under the name R. C. Zaehner.Before becoming an Oxford professor he had been known as Robin Zaehner. Peter Wright, Spycatcher (1987), pp. 243\u2013244. ==Life and career== ===Early years=== Born on 8 April 1913 in Sevenoaks, Kent, he was the son of Swiss\u2013German immigrants to England. Zaehner \"was bilingual in French and English from early childhood. He remained an excellent linguist all his life.\"Ann K. S. Lambton, Richard Charles Zaehner in BSOAS 38/3: 823\u2013824, at 823 (1975). She identifies his ancestry as \"Swiss German\",Editorial insert, \"The Author\", in Zaehner, The Teaching of the Magi (1956; 1976), p. 5 (bilingual). Educated at the nearby Tonbridge School, he was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied Greek and Latin, and also ancient Persian including Avestan, gaining first class honours in Oriental Languages. During 1936\u201337 he studied Pahlavi, another ancient Iranian language, with Sir Harold Bailey at Cambridge University. Thereafter Zaehner held Prof. Bailey in high esteem.Zaehner called Prof. Bailey \"perhaps the greatest Indo-Iranian philologist of our time\". Zaehner's 1972 \"Preface to the New Printing\" to his Zurvan, A Zoroastrian Dilemma (1972), p. vi. \"My debt to him, as always, remains immense.\" He then began work on his book Zurvan, a Zoroastrian Dilemma, a study of the pre-Islamic religion of Iran.Alana Howard, \"Gifford Lecture Biography.\"Lambton, Richard Charles Zaehner in BSOAS (1975). Zaehner enjoyed \"a prodigious gift for languages\". He later acquired a reading knowledge of Sanskrit (for Hindu scriptures), Pali (for Buddhist), and Arabic (for Islamic).Michael Dummett, \"Introduction\" pp. xi\u2013xix, at p. xiii (quote), to Zaehner's posthumous The City within the Heart (1981). In 1939 he taught as a research lecturer at Christ Church, Oxford. During this period, he read the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, and the Sufi poet of Iran Rumi, as well as studying the Hindu Upanishads. Zaehner came then to adopt a personal brand of \"nature mysticism\". Yet his spiritual progression led him a few years later to convert to Christianity, becoming a Roman Catholic while stationed in Iran.Geoffrey Parrinder, \"Robert Charles Zaehner (1913\u20131974)\" in History of Religion 16: 66\u201374, 74 (1976). ===British intelligence=== During World War II starting in 1943, he served as a British intelligence officer at their Embassy in Tehran. Often he was stationed in the field among the mountain tribes of northern Iran. After the war he also performed a more diplomatic role at the Tehran embassy.Alana Howard, \"Gifford Lecture Biography.\"Nigel West, At Her Majesty's Secret Service. The chiefs of Britain's intelligence agency MI6 (Naval Institute Press 2006) at 117. Nigel West is the pen name of Rupert Allason. Decades later another British intelligence officer, Peter Wright, described his activities: > \"I studied Zaehner's Personal File. He was responsible for MI6 > counterintelligence in Persia during the war. It was difficult and dangerous > work. The railway lines into Russia, carrying vital military supplies, were > key targets for German sabotage. Zaehner was perfectly equipped for the job, > speaking the local dialects fluently, and much of his time was spent > undercover, operating in the murky and cutthroat world of countersabotage. > By the end of the war his task was even more fraught. The Russians > themselves were trying to gain control of the railway, and Zaehner had to > work behind Russian lines, continuously at risk of betrayal and murder by > pro-German or pro-Russian... .\"Peter Wright, Spycatcher. The candid > autobiography of a senior intelligence officer, with Paul Greengrass > (Richmond: Heinemann Australia 1987), pp. 243\u2013246, at 244\u2013245 (quote). Zaehner continued in Iran until 1947 as press attach\u00e9 in the British Embassy,Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, \"R. C. Zaehner\" {website}. and as an MI6 officer. He then resumed his academic career at Oxford doing research on Zoroastrianism. During 1949, however, he was relocated to Malta where he trained anti-Communist Albanians. By 1950 he had secured an Oxford appointment as lecturer in Persian literature. Again in 1951\u20131952 he returned to Iran for government service. Prof. Nancy Lambton, who had run British propaganda in Iran during the war, recommended him for the Embassy position. Journalist Christopher de Bellaigue describes Robin Zaehner as \"a born networker who knew everyone who mattered in Tehran\" with a taste for gin and opium. \"When Kingsley Martin, the editor of the New Statesman, asked Zaehner at a cocktail party in Tehran what book he might read to enlarge his understanding of Iran, Zaehner suggested Alice through the Looking Glass.\"Christopher de Bellaigue, Patriot of Persia. Muhammad Mossadegh and a tragic Anglo-American coup (2012). pp. 193\u2013194 (Lambton), p. 194 (description of Zaehner, Martin quote).Ann Lambton, RCZ (1975), p. 623. In Iran stationed at the British Embassy during 1943\u20131947, and 1951\u20131952. Zaehner enjoyed a \"large number of Persian friends.\"'Ali Mirdrakvandi, an Iranian peasant from Luristan, worked awhile for Zaehner. He wrote a fantastic story in his self-taught English. It was later edited by John Hemming and published, with a foreword by Zaehner, as No Heaven for Gunga Din. Consisting of the British and American Officers' Book (London: Victor Gallancz 1965).Cf., Zaehner, \"Zoroastrian survivals in Iranian folklore\" (1965), pp. 87\u201396, at 88\u201389 re 'Ali Mirdrakvandi and his book. Also: Part II (1992). Zaehner publicly held the rank of Counsellor in the British Embassy in Tehran. In fact, he continued as an MI6 officer. During the Abadan Crisis he was assigned to prolong the Shah's royal hold on the Sun Throne against the republican challenge led by Mohammed Mossadegh, then the Prime Minister. The crisis involved the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company which had been in effect nationalised by Mossadegh. Zaehner thus became engaged in the failed 1951 British effort to topple the government of Iran and return oil production to that entity controlled by the British government.Mehrzad Boroujerdi, Iranian Intellectuals and the West. The tormented triumph of nativism (Syracuse Univ. 1996) at 33, 38\u201339. The 1951 coup staged by Britain alone failed due to Mossadegh's popularity and Iranian nationalism. Later in 1953 a joint American and British coup toppled Mossadegh, returned the Shah to power, and restored oilfields to Britain, but henceforth other countries, too. Yett the coup sowed the seeds of a lasting mistrust. \"[T]he plot to overthrow Mossadegh and give the oilfields back to the AIOC was in the hands of a British diplomat called Robin Zaehner, later professor of Eastern religions at Oxford.\"Robert Fisk, \"Another Fine Mess\", Information Clearing House (2003). \"It was Zaehner who had cultivated the Rashidian brothers, each of whom had worked against German influence in Iran during the Second World War.\" They were key players in the 1951 coup attempt. Fisk knew Robin Zaehner, \"the British classics scholar who helped mastermind it.\"During the 1951 attempted overthrow, Zaehner is said to have enlisted support of politicians, editors, aristocrats, army officers, tribal chiefs, businessmen, and others, including several associates of Mossadegh. Ervand Abrahamian, Komeinism (1993) cited in N.C.R.I.-F.A.C.de Bellaigue, Patriot of Persia (2012), pp. 193\u2013195, 197. Such Anglo and later American interference in Iran, which eventually reinstalled the Shah, has been widely criticized.Fakhreddin Azimi, The Quest for Democracy in Iran. A century of struggle against authoritarian rule (Harvard University 2008), p. 153. \"The defeat of [Mossadegh's civic-nationalist] movement was a watershed that marked renewed antagonism between the rulers and the ruled, as well as intensified abhorrence of Western imperialism.\"de Bellaigue, Patriot of Persia (2012), pp. 271-278.Cereti (1957), \u00b6\u00b617-20. In the 1960s, MI5 counterintelligence officer Peter Wright questioned Zaehner about floating allegations that he had doubled as a spy for the Soviet Union, harming British intelligence operations in Iran and Albania during the period following World War II. Zaehner is described as \"a small, wiry-looking man, clothed in the distracted charm of erudition.\" In his 1987 book Spycatcher Wright wrote that Zaehner's humble demeanor and candid denial convinced him that the Oxford don had remained loyal to Britain. Wright notes that \"I felt like a heel\" for confronting Zaehner.Peter Wright, Spycatcher (1987) at 245\u2013246. Wright states that, \"I felt bitter at the ease with which the accusation had been made,\" and for his subjecting a loyal colleague to hearing the false charges made against him. \"In that moment the civilized cradle of Oxford disintegrated around him; he was back behind the lines again, surrounded by enemies, alone and double- crossed\" (p. 246 quote). Although in the intelligence service for the benefit of his Government, on later reflection Zaehner did not understand the utilitarian activities he performed as being altogether ennobling. In such \"Government service abroad\", he wrote, \"truth is seen as the last of the virtues and to lie comes to be a second nature. It was, then, with relief that I returned to academic life because, it seemed to me, if ever there was a profession concerned with a single-minded search for truth, it was the profession of the scholar.\"Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), p. 6 (quote).de Bellaigue, Patriot of Persia (2012), p. 194. The job MI6 gave to Zaehner in Tehran was \"ugly: to sow chaos in the heart of a sovereign government.\" Prof. Jeffrey Kripal discusses \"Zaehner's extraordinary truth telling\" which may appear \"politically incorrect\". The \"too truthful professor\" might be seen as \"a redemptive or compensatory act\" for \"his earlier career in dissimulation and deception\" as a spy.Jeffrey Kripal, Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom (2001), p. 162. Kripal comments on Zaehner's Gifford lectures and his earlier Spalding inaugural lecture.Wright, Spycatcher (1987), p. 245\\. Wright mentions an apparently contrary view: \"The cords which bind Oxford and British Intelligence together are strong.\" ===Oxford professor=== Zaehner worked at the University until his death on 24 November 1974 in Oxford. \"[A]t the age of sixty-one he fell down dead in the street on his way to Sunday evening Mass.\"Dummett, \"Introduction\" (1981) p. xviii (quote). The cause of death was a heart attack.Kripal (2001), p.198 (heart attack).Cf., Lambton (1975). ====University work==== Before the war Zaehner had lectured at Oxford University. Returning to Christ Church several years after the war, he continued work on his Zurvan book,Zaehner, Zurvan, a Zoroastrian dilemma (1955). and lectured in Persian literature. His reputation then \"rested on articles on Zoroastrianism, mainly philological\" written before the war.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), p. 8. In 1952 Zaehner was elected Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics to succeed the celebrated professor Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who had resigned to become Vice-President (later President) of India.Sarvepalli Gopal, Radhakrishnan. A Biography (Delhi: Oxford University Press 1989), pp. 249\u2013250, 257 (VP); 304\u2013307 (P); during his last three years at Oxford, Radhakrishnan had served concurrently as India's ambassador to the Soviet Union (pp. 213\u2013215, 228, 248, 257). He was the first Spalding professor, starting in 1936 (pp. 132\u2013133, 145).S. Radhakrishnan, Eastern Religions and Western Thought (Oxford University 1939, 2d ed. 1940; 1960), p. 20. Regarding his Spalding post: \"the unprecedented appointment of an Asian to the Oxford Chair [is] motivated, I take it, by a desire to lift Eastern Thought... [indicating] its enduring value as a living force in shaping the soul of the modern man.\"Vishwanath S. Naravane, Modern Indian Thought (New Delhi: Orient Longman 1978), p. 249. Radhakrishnan's \"role has been described as that of a 'liaison officer' between East and West... as a 'philosophical bilinguist'... as a bridge builder facilitating intellectual commerce... .\" Zaehner had applied for this position. Radhakrishnan previously had been advancing a harmonizing viewpoint with regard to the study of comparative religions, and the academic Chair had a subtext of being \"founded to propagate a kind of universalism\". Zaehner's inaugural lecture was unconventional in content. He delivered a strong yet witty criticism of \"universalism\" in religion.Zaehner's 1953 Spalding lecture, \"Foolishness to the Greeks\", was incorporated as an Appendix, pp. 428\u2013443, in his book Concordant Discord (1970). It drew controversy. Prof. Michael Dummett opines that what concerned Zaehner was \"to make it clear from the start of his tenure of the Chair that he was nobody else's man.\"Michael Dummett, \"Introduction\" (1981) to Zaehner's posthumous The City within the Heart, at pp. xii-xiii, p. xii (quotes).Cf. Gopal, Radhakrishnan (1989). During the last decades of the Indian independence movement, Prof. Radhakrishnan had criticized Christianity's unique claims (pp. 39\u201344, 195\u2013197). He promoted an optimistic view of \"a shrinking world\" in which his generation would provide \"spiritual oneness and create an integrated human community\" (p. 149 quote). His Eastern Religions and Western Thought (Oxford 1939) discussed, e.g., Hindu influence on the ancient Greeks, and \"common elements in Christianity and Hinduiism\" (pp. 159\u2013160). Zaehner continued an interest in Zoroastrian studies, publishing his Zurvan book and two others on the subject during the 1950s.See Zoroastrian sections below. Since 1952, however, he had turned his primary attention further East. \"After my election to the Spalding Chair, I decided to devote myself mainly to the study of Indian religions in accordance with the founder's wishes.\"Zaehner, Zurvan (reissued 1972) \"Preface to the New Printing\", pp. v (quote) and vi (Hinduism and Buddhism). He served Oxford in this academic chair, while also a fellow at All Souls College, until his death in 1974, and never married.Alana Howard, \"Gifford Lecture Biography.\"Cf. Kripal, Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom (2001), p. 189. In his influential 1957 book Mysticism Sacred and Profane, Zaehner discussed this traditional, cross-cultural spiritual practice. Based on mystical writings, he offered an innovative typology that became widely discussed in academic journals. He also analyzed claims that mescalin use fit into this spiritual quest. His conclusion was near dismissive. Yet he revisited his harsh words on the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of drug mysticism in his 1972 book Zen, Drug and Mysticism. His warnings became somewhat qualified by some prudent suggestions. He carefully distinguished between drug-induced states and religious mysticism. Then the BBC began asking him to talk on the radio, where he acquired a following. He was invited abroad to lecture.Fernandes, The Hindu mystical experience (2004), p.6 (BBC talks, lectures abroad), pp. 10\u201311 (writing on drug mysticism).See Popular & drug culture section below. His delivery in Scotland of the Gifford Lectures led him to write perhaps his most magisterial book. Zaehner traveled twice to the University of St. Andrews during the years 1967 to 1969. The subject he choose concerned the convoluted and intertwined history of the different world religions during the long duration of their mutual co- existence. He described the interactions as both fiercely contested and relatively cross-cultivating, in contrast to other periods of a more sovereign isolation. The lectures were later published in 1970 \"just four years before his death\" by Oxford University as Concordant Discord. The interdependence of faiths.Kripal, Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom (2001), p. 181 (quote).See Gifford Lecture section below. ====Peer descriptions==== As a professor Zaehner \"had a great facility for writing, and an enormous appetite for work\u2026 [also] a talent for friendship, a deep affection for a number of particular close friends and an appreciation of human personality, especially for anything bizarre or eccentric\". Nonetheless, \"he passed a great deal of his time alone, most of it in his study working.\"Dummett, \"Introduction\" (1981), pp. xiii-xiv (quote). An American professor described Zaehner in a different light: \"The small, birdlike Zaehner, whose rheumy, color-faded eyes darted about in a clay colored face, misted blue from the smoke of Gauloises cigarettes, could be fearsome indeed. He was a volatile figure, worthy of the best steel of his age.\"Newell, Struggle and Submission. R. C. Zaehner on mysticisms (1981), p. iv (quote). His colleague in Iran, Prof. Ann K. S. Lambton of SOAS, recalled, \"He did not, perhaps, suffer fools gladly, but for the serious student he would take immense pains\". Prof. Zaehner was \"an entertaining companion\" with \"many wildly funny\" stories, \"a man of great originality, not to say eccentricity.\"Lambton, \"Obituary\" (1975), p. 624 (quote). \"Zaehner was a scholar who turned into something different, something more important than a scholar,\" according to Michael Dummett, a professor of philosophy at Oxford, who wanted to call him a penseur [French: a thinker]. With insight and learning (and his war-time experience) Zaehner shed light on key issues in contemporary spiritual life, writing abundantly. \"His talent lay in seeing what to ask, rather than in how to answer... .\"Dummett, \"Introduction\" (1981) at xi (quotes). Prof. Dummett here may refer especially to Zaehner's later, more popularizing books, e.g., on those counterculture drug users who associated their experience with mysticism. Yet Zaehner's work shed light on many regions. About Zaehner's writing style, Wilfred Cantwell Smith compared it to a merry-go-round, so that the reader is not sure he is \"actually going somewhere. A merry-go-round of such engaging colour, boisterous sound effects, and bouncing intellectual activity, however, is itself perhaps no mean achievement.\"Smith, \"Review of Concordant Discord, in The Journal of Religion, v.53 (1973), p.381; in Newell (1981), p.iii. In theology he challenged the ecumenical trend that strove to somehow see a uniformity in all religions. He acted not out of an ill will, but from a conviction that any fruitful dialogue between religions must be based on a \"pursuit of truth\". If such profound dialogue rested on a false or a superficial \"harmony and friendship\" it would only foster hidden misunderstandings, Zaehner thought, which would ultimately result in a deepening mistrust.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), pp. 6 & 7 (quotes).Gregory Baum, \"Foreword\" to Newell (1981), p. xi. ==His writings== ===Zoroastrian studies=== ====Zurvan==== Initially Zaehner's reputation rested on his studies of Zoroastrianism, at first articles mostly on philology in academic journals. He labored for many years on a scholarly work, his Zurvan, a Zoroastrian dilemma (1955). This book provides an original discussions of an influential theological deviation from the Zoroastrian orthodoxy of ancient Persia's Achaemenid Empire, which was a stark, ethical dualism. Zurvanism was promoted by the Sasanian Empire (224\u2013651) which arose later during Roman times. Until the Muslim conquest, Zurvanism in the Persian world became established and disestablished by turns.Zaehner, Zurvan (1955, 1972). The oldest reference for Zurvan found dates to the 12th (name), and 4th (sources unclear) centuries BCE (p. 20). Zurvanism had been installed at start of Sasanid rule as its state religion (p. 90), yet its status varied (pp. 112\u2013113).Touraj Daryaee, Sasanian Iran 224\u2013651 CE (Mazda Publishers, Costa Mesa 2008), King Ardaxsir I founded Sananid rule as Zoroastrian, with labors by the priest Kerdir (p, 16); Zurvan in edict (p. 62).Zaehner differs with Mary Boyce as to whether, during the prior Parthian period (247 BCE to 224 CE) in Iran, Zoroastrianism survived if not flourished, or was little practiced, confused and inauthentic. Zaehner chose the latter (the Sasanians \"restored the Zoroastrian faith\"). Compare: her Zoroastrians. Their Religious Beliefs and Practices (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul 1979, 1985), pp. 80\u201382; and, his Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism (1961), pp. at 22 (quote), 175. Zurvan was an innovation analogous to Zoroastrian original doctrine. The prophet Zoroaster preached that the benevolent Ahura Mazda (the \"Wise Lord\"), as the creator God, fashioned both Spenta Mainyu (the Holy Spirit), and Angra Mainyu (the Aggressive Spirit) who chose to turn evil. These two created Spirits were called twins, one good, one evil. Over the centuries Ahura Mazda and his \"messenger\" the good Spenta Mainyu became conflated and identified; hence, the creator Ahura Mazda began to be seen as the twin of the evil Angra Mainyu. It was in this guise that Zoroastrianism became the state religion in Achaemenid Persia. Without fully abandoning dualism, some started to consider Zurvan (Time) as the underlying cause of both the benevolent Ahura Mazda and the evil Angra Mainyu. The picture is complicated by very different schools of Zurvanism, and contesting Zoroastrian sects. Also, Ahura Mazda was later known as Ohrmazd, and Angra Mainyu became Ahriman.Zaehner, Zurvan (1955, 1972), pp. 3\u20135 (dualism of Zoroaster, and development of Zurvan).Zaehner, Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism (1961) at 34, 42\u201346 (Zoroaster's teaching); 178\u2013183, 246\u2013247 (Zoroastrian sects).Mary Boyce, Zoroastrians. Their religious belief and practices (1979), dualism: pp. 19\u201321, cf. 9-10; Zurvan heresy: pp. 67\u201370, 112\u2013113, 118\u2013123.Alessandro Bausani, Persia religiosa (Milano 1959, Rome 1960), translated as Religion in Iran (New York: Bibliotheca Persica 2000), pp. 42\u201347, 63 (Zurvan). Zurvan could be described as divinized Time (Zaman). With Time as 'father' twins came into being: the ethical, bountiful Ohrmazd, who was worshipped, and his satanic antagonist Ahriman, against whom believers fought. As Infinite Time, Zurvan rose supreme \"above Ohrmazd and Ahriman\" and stood \"above good and evil\". This aggravated the traditional 'orthodox' Zoroastrians (the Mazdean ethical dualists).Zaehner, Zurvan. A Zoroastrian dilemma (1955, 1972): Zurvan supreme (pp. 90, 91 quote).Farhang Mehr, The Zoroastrian Tradition (Element, Rockport 1991), moral dualism (pp. 71\u201376). Zoroastrian cosmology understood that \"finite Time comes into existence out of Infinite Time\". During the 12,000 year period of finite Time (Zurvan being both kinds of Time), human history occurs, the fight against Ahriman starts, and the final victory of Ohrmazd is achieved. Yet throughout, orthodox Mazdeans insisted, it is Ohrmazd who remains supreme, not Zurvan. On the other hand, his adherents held that Zurvan was God of Time, Space, Wisdom, and Power, and the Lord of Death, of Order, and of Fate.Zaehner, Zurvan (1955, 1972), finite Time, victory of Ohrmazd (pp. 106\u2013107 quote, and 100\u2013101); Zurvan as God (p. 219), as Lord (pp. 239, 248, 254). ====Teachings of the Magi==== The Teachings of the Magi (1956)A short (156 pages) book published by George Allen and Unwin for a series, Classics East and West. was Zaehner's second of three book on Zoroastrianism. It presented the \"main tenets\" of the religion in the Sasanid era, during the reign of Shapur II, a 4th-century King. Its chief sources were Pahlavi books written a few centuries later by Zoroastrians. Each of its ten chapters contains Zaehner's descriptive commentaries, illustrated by his translations from historic texts. Chapter IV, \"The Necessity of Dualism\" is typical, half being the author's narrative and half extracts from a Pahlavi work, here the Shikand Gumani Vazar by Mardan Farrukh.Zaehner (1956), Chapter IV, pp. 52\u201366. The \"main tenants\" quote at p. 11. ====Dawn and Twilight==== In his The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism (1961), Zaehner adopted a chronological dichotomy. He first explores origins, the founding of the religion by its prophet Zoroaster. He notes that the Gathas, the earliest texts in the Avesta, make it obvious that \"Zoroaster met with very stiff opposition from the civil and ecclesiastical authorities when once he had proclaimed his mission.\" \"His enemies... supported the ancient national religion.\" On moral and ecological grounds, Zoroaster favored the \"settled pastoral and agricultural community\" as against the \"predatory, marauding tribal societies\". His theological and ethical dualism advocated for \"the followers of Truth the life-conserving and life-enhancing forces\" and against the \"destructive forces\" of the Lie.Zaehner, Dawn and Twilight (1961), p. 25 (Gathas); p. 35 (quote \"opposition\"), p. 37 (quote \"enemies\"); p. 40 (quotes \"settled\", \"marauding\"); p. 42 (quote \"Truth\" and \"Lie\"). For the dates of the prophet's life, Zaehner adopted the traditional 6th century BCE dates.Zaehner, Dawn and Twilight (1961), p. 33 (dates [of Sasanian priests] were pegged to year of Alexander's conquests).Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin, La religion de l'Iran ancient (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France 1962) translated as Religion of Ancient Iran (Bombay: Tata 1973), pp. 99\u2013100. Classic Greeks assigned his dates to 6000 years before Plato. The \"native tradition\" of the 7th century CE placed him 258 years before Alexander (early 6th century BC). The author here concludes 600 BC at the latest (concurrent with Buddha and Confucius), but perhaps 1000 BC per \"linguistic evidence\".Josef Wieseh\u00f6fer, Ancient Persia (London: I. B. Tauris 1996), pp. 96, 272. Now \"very few scholars\" dissent to prophet's date of circa \"1000 BC\".Boyce, A History of Zoroastrianism, volume 1 (Leiden/K\u00f6ln: E. J. Brill 1975) at 190. Boyce notes that the 6th-century dates were suggested by Sasanian priests, but are known to be artificial. She favors an earlier dating, 1400 to 1000 BC, for the prophet Zarathushtra or Zoroaster. His Gathas are linguistically comparable to the Rig Veda, dated at 1700 BC, and the pastoral social economy described in the Gathas fits that time period.Mehr, The Zoroastrian Tradition (1991), pp. 3\u20135. Mehr's discussion gives a date of 1750 BC for Zoroaster, stating reasons similar to those of Boyce. Zoroaster reformed the old polytheistic religion by making Ahura Mazdah [the Wise Lord] the Creator, the only God. An innovation by Zoroaster was the abstract notions, namely, the Holy Spirit, and the Amesha Spentas (Good Mind, Truth, Devotion, Dominion, Wholeness, Immortality). Zaehner interpreted them not as new substitutes for the excluded old gods, \"but as part of the divine personality itself\" which may also serve \"as mediating functions between God and man\". The Amesha Spentas are \"aspects of God, but aspects in which man too can share.\"Zaehner, Dawn and Twilight (1961), pp. 54-55 (Ahura Mazdah); 45-46 (\"mediating\" quote), 71 (\"aspects\" quote). Angra Mainyu was the dualistic evil.See above: Zurvan section. Dating to before the final parting of ways of the Indo-Iranians, the Hindus had two classes of gods, the asuras (e.g., Varuna) and the devas (e.g., Indra). Later following the invasion of India the asuras sank to the rank of demon. Au contraire, in Iran the ahuras were favored, while the daevas fell and opposed truth, spurred in part by Zoroaster's reform. In the old Iranian religion, an ahura [lord] was concerned with \"the right ordering of the cosmos\".Zaehner, Dawn and Twilight (1961), pp. 37 (Varuna as asura, Indra as deva), 39 (asuras lawful), 66 (Ahura Mazdah and Vouruna), 82-83 (laws of Zoroaster, asura), 132 (Rig Veda, Avesta). Regarding another subject, the application of Georges Dum\u00e9zil's theories to Zoroastrian theology, Zaehner criticizes its accuracy (pp. 49-50).Boyce, A History of Zoroastrianism, v. 1 (1975): Vedic deva and Avestan daeva, Vedic asura and Avestan ahura (p. 23); deva Indra (p. 32), Varuna as asura (p. 36); the lawful Ahura Vouruna in Iran as forerunner of Ahura Mazda (pp. 48, 53); Zoroaster rejects the heroic warrior Indra as daeva, as \"violent, lavish, reckless\" (p.53).Gherardo Gnoli, \"Indo-Iranian Religion\" (2004, 2012 update) in Encyclopaedia Iranica [2018-06-09]. Ahura/asura, daeva/deva distinctions (\u00b65), after Zoroaster condemned polytheism.Nalinee M. Chapekar, Ancient India and Iran (Delhi: Ajanta 1982), pp. 19-22: ahura/asura, daeva/deva, Iran/India. In Part II, Zaehner discussed the long decline of Zoroastrianism.Wieseh\u00f6fer,Ancient Iran (1996), pp. 96-97. The period between the Dawn and the Twilight was not uneventful. Scholars often differ over conflicting theories of Zoroaster's original message by turns compromised and transformed, a schism that split the religion, survivals of the preexisting pantheon, rise of Mithraism, and political opportunism. Also (pp. 134-135): the confusion added by a \"loss of historic memory\" during the Parthian era, a regional commingling of oral history and heroic tales. There arose the teachings about Zurvan i Akanarak [Infinite Time]. The Sasanid state's ideological rationale was sourced in Zoroastrian cosmology and sense of virtue. The Amesha Spentas provided spiritual support for human activities according to an articulated mean (e.g., \"the just equipoise between excess and deficiency\", Zoroastrian \"law\", and \"wisdom or reason\"). As an ethical principle the mean followed the contours of the 'treaty' between Ohrmazd [Ahura Mazda] and Ahriman [Angra Mainyu], which governed their struggle in Finite Time. Other doctrines came into prominence, such as those about the future saviour Saoshyans (Zoroaster himself or his posthumous son). Then after the final triumph of the Good Religion the wise lord Orhmazd \"elevates the whole material creation into the spiritual order, and there the perfection that each created thing has as it issues from the hand of God is restored to it\" in the Frashkart or \"Making Excellent\".Zaehner, Dawn and Twilight (1961), pp. 181\u2013184, 193\u2013247 (Zurvan); pp. 284\u2013301 (Sassanid state: the mean at 285, 286 & 289, 287: quotes; the treaty at 286\u2013287, castes at 284\u2013285); pp. 58\u201360, 299, 317-318 (Saoshyans); pp. 228\u2013229 quote, 296, 302 (the Frashkart).Cf. Boyce, A History of Zoroastrianism, vol.1 (1975), p.232: Ohrmazd's cosmic triumph ushers in this \"glorious moment\" at the end of the era, \"termed Fra\u0161o.k\u01ddr\u01ddti (Pahlavi \"Fra\u0161egird\"), the \"Making Wonderful\". Humankind enters an eternity of \"untroubled goodness, harmony and peace.\" Boyce on the \"Fra\u0161egird\": pp. 245 (and N\u00f5 R\u00f5z), 246 (\"perfect men in the perfect kingdom\"), 291 (\"the Last Judgment will take place, the earth will be cleansed of evil\"), 292 (renewal).Cf., Zaehner, Matter and Spirit (1963), where the Zoroastrianism of the Sasanid era is compared with the ethical vision of quasi-utopian Marxists. ====Articles, chapters==== Zaehner contributed other work regarding Zoroaster and the religion began in ancient Iran. The article \"Zoroastrianism\" was included in a double-columned book he edited, The Concise Encyclopedia of Living Faiths, first published in 1959.1959 article at pp. 209-222, Also were his several articles on the persistence in popular culture of the former national religion, \"Zoroastrian survivals in Iranian folklore\".The two related articles (1952, 1965), and its posthumous \"Part II\" (1992). Chapters, in whole or part, on Zoroastrianism appeared in a few of his other books: At Sundry Times (1958), aka The Comparison of Religions (1962);Chapter IV, \"Prophets outside Israel\" pp. 134\u2013164, Zoroaster discussion at pp. 135\u2013153 (1962). The Convergent Spirit, aka Matter and Spirit (1963);Chapter 5, \"Solidarity in God,\" pp. 130-156 (1963). and Concordant Discord (1970).Chapter XIX, \"Beneath the Sun of Satan\" pp. 385\u2013403, at pp. 387\u2013394 (1970). ===Comparative religion=== In addition to the two titles below, other works of Zaehner are comparative or have a significant comparative element.See Zaehner Bibliography. Zaehner, editor: Encyclopedia of the World's Religions (1959, 1988). Among these are: Concordant Discord (1970),The Giford lecture discussed below. and Our Savage God (1974).Discussed in subsection \"'New Age' drug culture\". ====Choice of perspective==== In the west the academic field of comparative religion at its origins inherited an 'enlightenment' ideal of an objective, value-neutral rationalism. Yet traditional Christian and Jewish writings provided much of the source material, as did classical literature, these being then joined by non-western religious texts,E.g., Muslim, Zoroastrian, Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian, Shinto. then eventually by empirical ethnological studies.Zaehner, Foolishness to the Greeks (1953; 1970).Academic study itself split into several diverse fields: hybrid sociological and anthropological works, evolutionary theories, contending philosophical analysis, rival psychologies, innovative proposals for harmonizations, updated traditional apologetics, ethical discourse, political dimensions. The privileged 'enlightenment' orientation in practice fell short of being value-neutral, and itself became progressively contested by different camps.Secular rationalism of the Enlightenment only aspired to a value neutrality, as it inherited or developed conflicting stands, e.g., Aristotle's prime mover, Descartes' radical doubt, Spinoza's pantheism, Hume's natural religion, Kant's rational critiques, Hegel's historicism, Kierkegaard's existentialism, Nietzsche's irrationalism, Freud's psychology (or Jung's), Weber's sociology (or Durkheim's), etc. As to value-neutral criteria, Zaehner situated himself roughly as follows: > \"Any man with any convictions at all is liable to be influenced by them even > when he tries to adopt an entirely objective approach; but let him recognize > this from the outset and guard against it. If he does this, he will at least > be less liable to deceive himself and others.\" \"Of the books I have written > some are intended to be objective; others, quite frankly, are not.\" \"In all > my writings on comparative religion my aim has been increasingly to show > that there is a coherent pattern in religious history. For me the centre of > coherence can only be Christ.\" Yet \"I have rejected as irrelevant to my > theme almost everything that would find a natural place in a theological > seminary, that is, Christian theology, modern theology in particular.\" \"For > what, then, do I have sympathy, you may well ask. Quite simply, for the > 'great religions' both of East and West, expressed... in those texts that > each religion holds most sacred and in the impact that these have > caused.\"Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), quotes: p.10 (\"Any man\"), p.9 > (\"Of the books\"), p.16 (\"In all\"), p. 17-18 (\"I have\"), p.19 (\"For what\"). > Cf. his criitique of a plague of theology, pp. 15-16.Cf., Zaehner, > Comparison (1958, 1962), pp. 12-13: rational agnostics before the \"basically > irrational\" nature of religion seem unable.Cf., Fernandes (2004), pp. 8, > 12-16, 198-200. Accordingly, for his primary orientation Zaehner chose from among the active participants: Christianity in its Catholic manifestation. Yet the academic Zaehner also employed a type of comparative analysis, e.g., often drawing on Zoroastrian or Hindu, or Jewish or Islamic views for contrast, for insight.Cf., Zaehner, Christianity and other religions (1964), p.78: Venturing to compare the Neo-Confucian Li with the Greek Logos, Zaehner refers to Mahayana Buddhism and the Tao, and mentions the Hindu tradition. Often he combined comparison with a default 'modernist' critique, which included psychology or cultural evolution.Zaehner, Comparison (1958, 1962), pp. 42-43 (Carl Jung), 49 (Wm. James), 76-78 (Aristotle and Jung), 174-175 (Mircea Eliade).Kripal (2001), pp. 156-157. Zaehner's later works are informed by Vatican II (1962-1965) and tempered by Nostra aetate.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), pp. 12-15, esp. p.15 re his limits on Nostra Aetate. Pursuit of his chosen point of view was not without criticism, including from other academics.Shri Krishna Saksena, Essays on Indian Philosophy (University of Hawaii Prss 1970), chapter \"Professor Zaehner and the Comparison of Religions\" at pp. 102-116. Zaehner, however, had declared in his 1962 Preface that his book (original title At Sundry Times) was based on lectures which specifically required a Christian orientation; hence the book discuss \"how a Christian should regard the non-Christian religions\" (in a few books his aim had been other than a thorough-going objectivity). Prof. Saksena pointedly described perceived defects, but was by no means abusive, writing Zaehner \"often shows great insight\" (p.105).Mary Boyce, A History of Zoroastrianism, vol.1 (Leiden/K\u00f6ln: E. J. Brill 1975), pp. 164-165, re Zaehner on the Haoma sacrifice.Cf., Sethna (1981).Cf., Kripal (2001), pp. 192-194, re a view on conflicts in Zaehner's writings. Nor did Zaehnerr's Christian belief prevent him from disclosing his own obvious, truth-be-told criticism of the historical church.Zaehner, Evolution in Religion (1971), p.112: \"[I]f the Church is indeed the 'mystical' body of Christ, living by the breath of the Holy Spirit, how are we to account for its disgraceful, blood-stained history?\" The \"root- sin of the Church has, ever since the conversion of Constantine, been its betrayal of its spiritual mission in the interests of worldly power\" and its loss of \"Christ's gift of love\" resulting in its \"criminal career of persecution and intolerance.\" ... The Church is \"tormented by the wickedness\" but \"ennobled by the sanctity\". ====At Sundry Times==== In his 1958 book At Sundry Times. An essay in the comparison of religions,Reissued by Beacon Press, Boston, in 1962, as The Comparison of Religions. Page references here are to this 1962 edition. The At Sundry Times title is from Hebrews, chap. I, verse 1 (p.28). Based on lectures at University College of Wales, which required relevance to Christianity. An appendix (195-217) is added (pp. 9, 10, 195). Zaehner came to grips with \"the problem of how a Christian should regard the non-Christian religions and how, if at all, he could correlate them into his own\" (p. 9 [Preface]). It includes an Introduction (1), followed by chapters on Hinduism (2), on Hinduism and Buddhism (3), on \"Prophets outside Israel\", i.e., Zoroastrianism and Islam (4), and it concludes with Appendix which compares and contrasts the \"Quran and Christ\". Perhaps the key chapter is \"Consummatum Est\" (5), which \"shows, or tries to show, how the main trend in [mystical] Hinduism and Buddhism on the one hand and of [the prophetic] Zoroastrianism on the other meet and complete each other in the Christian revelation\" (Preface, p. 9, words in brackets added). The book opens with a lucid statement of his own contested hermeneutic: \"with comparative religion,\" he says, \"the question is who's to be master, that's all\" (p. 9).This concludes a conversation between Humpty-Dumpty and Alice, at page 11 in the Beacon edition. He starts by saluting E. O. James. Next Zaehner mentions Rudolph Otto (1869-1937) and al-Ghazali (1058-1111) as both being skeptics about any 'reasonable' writer with no religious experience who expounds on the subject. Here Zaehner acknowledges that many Christians may only be familiar with their own type of religion (similar to Judaism and Islam), and hence be ill-equipped to adequately comprehend Hindu or Buddhist mysticism (pp. 12\u201315). Zaehner then compared the Old Testament and the Buddha, the former being a history of God's commandments delivered by his prophets to the Jewish people and their struggle to live accordingly, and the later being a teacher of a path derived from his own experience, which leads to a spiritual enlightenment without God and apart from historical events (pp. 15\u201319, 24-26). Needed is a way to bridge this gap between these two (pp. 15, 19, 26, 28). The gap is further illustrated as it relates to desire and suffering (p. 21), body and soul (pp. 22\u201323), personality and death (pp. 23\u201324). He announced a 'method' special to the book: \"I shall concern myself with what sincere men have believed\" (p. 29). ====Christianity & other Religions==== The 1964 book,New York, Hawthorn; concurrently published in London by Burns and Oates as The Catholic Church and World Religions. following its introduction, has four parts: India, China and Japan, Islam, and The Catholic Church. Throughout Zaehner offers connections between the self-understanding of 'other religions' and that of the Judeo-Christian, e.g., the Upanishads and Thomas Merton (pp. 25\u201326), Taoism and Adam (p. 68), Sunyata and Plato (p. 96), Al-Ghazali and St. Paul (p. 119-120), Samkhya and Martin Buber (pp. 131\u2013132). In the introduction, Zaehner laments the \"very checkered history\" of the Church. Yet he expresses his admiration of Pope John (1881-1963), who advanced the dignity that all humanity possesses \"in the sight of God\". Zaehner then presents a brief history of Christianity in world context. The Church \"rejoiced to build into herself whatever in Paganism she found compatible\" with the revelation and ministry of Jesus. Her confidence was inferred in the words of Gamaliel (pp. 7\u20139).Zaehner, Christianity (1964), p.9: The Jewish teacher Gamaliel stated that nothing will stop Christianity \"if it be of God\". While Europe has known of Jesus for twenty centuries, 'further' Asia has only for three. Jesus, however, seemed to have arrived there with conquerors from across the sea, and \"not as the suffering servant\" (p. 9).Matthew 4, 8-10 is quoted by Zaehner, Christianity (1964), p.9, regarding the temptation of Jesus in the desert, by Satan who promised him all the kingdoms of the world. As to the ancient traditions of Asia, Christians did \"condemn outright what [they had] not first learnt to understand\" (pp. 11, 13). Zaehner thus sets the stage for a modern review of ancient traditions. \"The Catholic Church\" chapter starts by celebrating its inclusiveness. Zaehner quotes Cardinal Newman praising the early Church's absorption of classical Mediterranean virtues (a source some term 'heathen').Cf., Zaehner, Our Savage God (1974), where Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato, and Aristotle are extensively discussed. For \"from the beginning the Moral Governor of the world has scattered the seeds of truth far and wide... .\"Zaehner, Christianity (1964), p.128 (term 'heathen'; Newman quote). There may be some danger for Christians to study the spiritual truths of other religions, but it is found in scripture.Acts 17:26-28, (St. Paul at the Areopagus in Athens). Zaehner (1964) then artfully quotes St. Paul's words to the philosophers (pp. 128-129). Zaehner counsels that the reader not \"neglect the witness\" of Hinduism and Buddhism, as they teach inner truths which, among Christians, have withered and faded since the one-sided Reformation. The Church perpetually struggles to keep to a \"perfect yet precarious balance between the transcendent... Judge and King and the indwelling Christ\". Writing in 1964, Zaehner perceived \"a change for the better\" in the increasing acceptance of the \"Yogin in India or Zen in Japan\". Nonetheless, a danger exists for the 'unwary soul' who in exploring other religions may pass beyond the fear of God. Then one may enter the subtleties of mystical experience, and \"mistake his own soul for God.\" Such an error in distinguishing between timeless states can lead to ego inflation, spiritual vanity, and barrenness.Zaehner, Christianity (1964), quotes: first 129, three at 130, last 131. Zaehner further discusses the 'mystic mistake' at pp. .Fernandes (2004), p.89 (spiritual pride may lead to barrenness).Cf. Asin Palacios, St. John of the Cross and Islam (1981), pp. 11-14, 25: renunciation of 'expansion' (bas\u1e6d, anchura); 20-22: danger of \"spiritual vanity\". Zaehner offers this categorical analysis of some major religious affiliations: a) action-oriented, worldly (Judaism, Islam, Protestantism, Confucianism); b) contemplation-oriented, other-worldly (Hinduism, Theravada Buddhism, Taoism); c) in-between (Mahayana Buddhism, neo-Confucianism, the reformed Hinduism of Gandhi, the Catholic Church).Zaehner, Christianity (1964), p.22. ===Mystical experience=== Mysticism as an academic field of study is relatively recent, emerging from earlier works with a religious and literary accent. From reading the writings of mystics, various traditional distinctions have been further elaborated, such as its psychological nature and its social-cultural context. Discussions have also articulated its phenomenology as a personal experience versus how it has been interpreted by the mystic or by others.Cf. Michael Stoebel, \"The comparative study of mysticism\" in the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion (New York 2015). Accessed 2015-4-22. Professor Zaehner made his contributions, e.g., to its comparative analysis and its typology. ====Sacred and Profane==== After Zaehner's initial works on Zoroastrianism, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957) was his first published on another subject. It followed his assumption of the Spalding chair at All Souls College, Oxford. The book's conversational style delivers clarity and wisdom on a difficult subject, and along the way are found many illuminating digressions and asides. The profane side is first addressed with regard to the use of mescaline. Zaehner himself carefully took this natural psychedelic drug. He discussed in particular Aldous Huxley, especially in his popular 1954 book The Doors of Perception (pp. 1\u201329, 208-226). Next, the subject of nature mystics is described and appraised, including two examples from literature: Proust and Rimbaud (pp. 30\u201383). 'Madness', it is also pointed out, may sometimes result in mental states that accord with those of the mystics (p. 84-105). A chapter \"Integration and isolation\" takes a comparative view, discussing mystics of Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam, as well as Jung's psychology. Integration is described as nature mysticism joined to the intellect, whereby reason and the unconscious nourish one another (p. 114). Isolation refers to Samkhya mysticism, whereby the purusa (the soul) and prakrti (nature) are separated (p. 106-128). About the Hindu mystics, Zaehner contrasts Samkhya, a dualist doctrine associated with the Yoga method, and non-dualist Vedanta, a monism inspired by the Upanishads. The relative merits of Monism verses Theism, and vice versa, are discussed (pp. 153\u2013197). Near the end of his conclusion, Zaehner repeats his view that the monist and the theistic are \"distinct and mutually opposed types of mysticism\" (p. 204). ====Hindu and Muslim==== His innovative 1960 book compares the mystical literature and practice of Hindus and Muslims. He frames it with a theme of diversity.Zaehner, Hindu and Muslim Mysticism (1960, 1969), \"Preface\" at vii\u2013viii. On experiential foundations, Zaehner then commences to explore the spiritual treasures left to us by the mystics of the Santana Dharma, and of the Sufi tariqas. Often he offers a phenomenological description of the reported experiences, after which he interprets them in various theological terms.Quoted at length is Martin Buber on mystical experience, at pp. 17\u201318 in Zeahner (1960, 1969). Following Surendranath N. Dasgupta, Zaehner describes five different types of mysticism to be found in Indian tradition: \"the sacrificial, the Upanishadic, the Yogic, the Buddhistic, and that of bhakti.\"Surendranath N. Dasgupta, Hindu Mysticism (Chicago: Open Court 1927; republished by Frederick Unger, New York, 1959). His book is based on his six lectures: Sacrificial, Upanishads, Yoga, Buddhistic, Classical Devotional, and Popular Devotional (the last two on Bhakti). Starting in 1922, the University of Cambridge published Dasgupta's A History of Indian Philosophy in five volumes. Zaehner leaves aside the 'sacrificial' (as being primarily of historic interest), and the 'Buddhist' (due to contested definitions of nirvana),Zaehner, Hindu and Muslim Mysticism (1960, 1969) at 6\u201311. Zaehner credits (p.6) Dasgupta's Hindu Mysticism for the initial typology. so that as exemplars of mystical experience he presents: *(a) the Upanishadic \"I am this All\" which can be subdivided into (i) a theistic interpretation or (ii) a monistic; *(b) the Yogic \"unity\" outside space and time, either (i) of the eternal monad of the mystic's own individual soul per the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali or (ii) of Brahman, the ground of the universe, per the advaita Vedanta of Sankara; and, *(c) the Bhakti mysticism of love, according to the commentary on the Bhagavad Gita by Ramanuja.Zaehner, Hindu and Muslem Mysticism (1960, 1969) at 19, 6 & 10; (a) 7\u20139, 17; (b) 9\u201310, 13, 17; (c) 11, 14\u201316, 17\u201318. Based on the above schematic, the resulting study of the mystics of the two religions is somewhat asymmetrical. Zaehner chose to treat initially Hindu mystics, because of their relative freedom from creed or dogma. The mystics and sufis of Islam selected are from all over the Islamic world, e.g., Junayd of Baghdad, and Al-Ghazali.Junayd at pp. 135-153, Ghazali at 153\u2013175. Zaehner (1960, 1969). Included are mystics from the Mughal era. Both Hindu and Muslim are given careful scrutiny, Zaehner discussing their insight into mystical experience. ====Comparative mysticism==== In his work on comparative religion, Zaehner directly addressed mysticism, particularly in Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. He criticized the then widely-held view that in mystical experience was to be found the key to the unity of all religions. He based his contrary views on well-known texts authored by the mystics of various traditions. Zaehner, after describing their first-hand reports of experiences of extraordinary states of consciousness, presented also their traditional interpretations. The result seems to indicate a great variety of mystical experience, and clear differences in how these were understood theologically. Many experiences seems to evidence a particular world view, e.g., theisms, monisms, dualisms, pantheisms, or agnostic.E.g., Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957, 1961) at 168.Cf., Dummett (1981), p. xiii. His critique challenged the thesis of Richard Bucke, developed in his 1901 book, Cosmic Consciousness. Bucke describes certain lesser facilities, followed by accounts of the prized 'cosmic' state of mind. Fourteen exemplary people of history as presented, shown as each reaching a somewhat similar realization: the plane of cosmic consciousness.Richard Maurice Bucke, Cosmic Consciousness. A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind (Philadelphia: Innes and Sons 1901; reprints: University Books 1961, Dutton 1969), range of experience pp. 55-56; summary description 14, 65\u201366; exemplars: fourteen pp. 67, 69\u2013209, an additional thirty-six 211\u2013302. The 14: Gautama the Buddha, Jesus the Christ, Paul, Plotinus, Mohammad, Dante, Bartolom\u00e9 Las Casas, John Yepes, Francis Bacon, Jacob Behmen, William Blake, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Walt Whitman, Edward Carpenter ('Christian' except 1, 4 & 5).Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), pp. 40-50. This idea, called the Perennial philosophy, has been variously advanced, e.g., by Aldous Huxley, by Frithjof Schuon, by Houston Smith. Zaehner does not dispute that these spiritual visionaries reach a distinguishable level of awareness. Nor does he deny that by following a disciplined life sequence over time one may be led to mystical experience: withdrawal, purgation, illumination. Instead, what Zaeher suggests is a profound difference between, e.g., the pantheistic vision of a nature mystic, admittedly pleasant and wholesome, and the personal union of a theist with the Divine lover of humankind.Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957), pp. 118, 149, 204; cf., 66-67.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), pp. 46\u201348.Reardon (2011).Newell (1981), pp. 1-5, 53-55.Schebera (1978), pp. 20-24. Schebera includes among advocates of an accessible mystical unity of historically diverse religions: Ramakrishna (1836-1886), Carl Jung, and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (p.20). ====Gender: Soul & Spirit==== Zaehner's study of mystical writings also incorporated its psychological dimensions, yet as a supplement, not as definitive.Zaehner, Hindu and Muslim mysticism (1960, 1969), p.169. Zaehner dismisses the reductionism of Leuba, \"his thesis that mysticism can be explained in terms of pure psychology without any reference to God as a reality distinct from the soul.\"James H. Leuba, The Psychology of Religious Mysticism (New York: Harcourt, Brace 1925). In the Preface Leuba writes that the \"hortatory, apologetic, and romantic character\" of most literature on mysticism \"accounts for its scientific insignificance.\" While using the factual arguments of Sigmund Freud, Leuba is not in total agreement with him. Later, at p.318, Leuba writes, \"For the psychologist who remains within the province of science, religious mysticism is a revelation not of God but of man.\" About the experience of unusual states of consciousness, many mystics have written using as a descriptive metaphor language associated with marriage symbolism or sexuality.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), p.85: sexual imagery in Christian mystics, in Hindu.Zaehner, Zen, Drugs and Mysticism (1972), p.68. \"there is scarcely a form of religious mysticism... in which sexuality does not turn up.\" He mentions commentary on the biblical Song of Songs. \"Divine love and human love at their highest are both, it would seem, sexual, for sexual love surpasses even parental love\".Kripal (2001), re Zaehner: pp. 181, 183 (erotic), 184-185, 187-188 (gender). According to Kripal, Zaehner \"privileges human sexuality as the locus classicus of the very highest stages of mysticism and sexual language as the most appropriate expression of these states\" (p.183).E.g., Sidney Spencer, Mysticism in world religions (Penguin 1963): \"The Spiritual Marriage\" in Christianity (pp. 253-256). The united oneness with deity is \"not merely a passing experience\" but \"a permanent state of life\" (p.25x quote). Later he quotes Jakob Boehme, \"I was embraced with love as a bridegroom embraces his bride\" (p.269). Abrahamic religions traditionally identify the gender of the supreme Being as male. In Islam and in Christianity, the soul of the often male sufi or mystic, following his spiritual discipline, may encounter the holy presence of the male Deity.Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957), p.120: soul as feminine, biblical and koranic God as masculine.Kripal (2001), pp. 192-193: \"In blunt terms\" Kripal attacks this metaphor as \"clearly a psychosexual product of patriarchy, which defines divinity as male, [and] essentializes women (and secondarily, male souls) as passive... .\" The result is that male heterosexuals cannot be understood to act \"as threats to a single male God.\" The Christian Church as a whole, as a community of souls, for millennia has been self-described as the Bride of Christ.Zaehner, Zen, Drugs and Mysticism (1972), pp. 68, 134-135.Cf., Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), p.160: The human-divine relationship in 'spiritual marriage' is \"the love of the bride for her spouse\" and \"the human role in relation to God is always that of female to male.\" In a Hindu sect, \"the soul is regarded as the bride, and God as the bridegroom\" (p.168).Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957), p.141 (\"the soul as the bride of Christ\").Evelyn Underhill, Mysticism (London 1911, reprint Dutton 1961), p.426: from Orphic mysteries to Christianity, \"the Spiritual Marriage between God and the Soul\". She then quotes Rumi. Across centuries and continents, mystics have used erotic metaphors and sexual analogies in descriptions of Divine love. The special states of consciousness they recorded have become the subject of modern psychological studies, e.g., by the school of C. G. Jung (often favored by Zaehner).Zaehner, \"Jungian depth psychology\" a subsection at pp. 403-406 in his article \"A new Buddha and a new Tao\" (1959, 1967). Zaehner often referenced Jung's analytic psychology. > When Jung equates the \"God-image\" with the archetype of the \"self\", he is > expressing in his own psychological terminology the old Hindu identification > of the atman, the human soul or self, with the Brahman, the ground of the > entire universe. Zaehner (1959, 1967), p.414 (quote). Cf., e.g., Jolande Jacobi, The psychology of C. G. Jung (Zurich 1939; London 1942, Yale University 1943, 6th ed. 1962). In abstract, the ego's animating figure and also entryway to the unconscious is contrasexual, that is, archetypes called the feminine anima for men, and the masculine animus for women. Yet a person's center of wholeness (the goal of individuation) is their inner Self, an archetype that may also be synonymous with the god image and deified. Here some terminologies may function somewhat as near equivalents: the soul for the unconscious, and spirit for figures (archetypes) of the unconscious.Cf., Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957), pp. 118-123. Here Zaehner enters on a sustained critique of Carl Jung's psychology. While praising Jung's ability to heal, Zaehner nonetheless alleges missteps per alchemy, the hieros gamos, the trinity's 'square halo', theodicy, Zoroaster, pride and the split personality. \"Jung takes from religion only what confirms and illustrates his psychology.\" (p.120 quote) Among Christian mystics Teresa de Jes\u00fas (1515-1582) employed the spiritual marriage metaphor in writing about her experiences.Teresa of Avila, The Interior Castle ([1577]; NY: Sheed & Ward 1946, reprint 1989 by Image Doubleday), the fifth mansion concerns Spiritual Betrothal, the seventh Spiritual Marriage.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), p.320: provocative quote from her 'autobiography', Vida de la Madre Teresa de Jes\u00fas (1588). Mechthild von Magdeburg (c.1208-1282/1294)Mechthild of Magdeburg, The Flowing Light of the Godhead (Mahwah: Paulist Press 1997), translated and introduced by Frank Tobin.John P. Dourley, Love, celibacy, and the inner marriage (Toronto: Inner City 1987), pp. 29-43: discussion of Mechthilde's writings, e.g., her being among the \"brides of Christ\" and the \"frankly sexual nature of her imagery\" (pp. 30-31), and the Trinity (pp. 34-36). At p.42 Dourley opines about Mechthilde, applying Jung's psychology: \"the archetypal truth of celibacy lies in the immediate and unprojected experience of the contrasexual, and through it of the Self\". Dourley (1936-2018) was a Catholic priest, a professor of religion, and Jungian analyst.Dourley, Jung and his mystics (Routledge 2014), pp. 38-55 (Mechthilde, e.g., in context: the Beguines pp. 37-40; sexual imagery pp. 40-48; Eckhard pp. 49, 76; Jung pp. 48-51). \"The process of intercourse with the animus, a divine/human figure in Mechthild's imagery, gives birth to the power of God in consciousness.\" \"Mechthild was among the pioneers... to make this interiority conscious\" (p.50, quotes).C. G. Jung, Symbols of Transformation (1912, rev. 1952; Bollingen 1956, 1967: CW, v5), p.90 (Mechthild quoted); p.433 (the hieros gamos, adopted by early Christianity).C. G. Jung, Psychological Types (1921; Bollingen 1971: CW, v6), p.232 (Mechthild and 'Christ-eroticism'), p.237 (spiritualization of eroticism, libido and symbol). provides a special example of the woman mystic.Underhill, Mysticism (1911, 1961), p.92 (Mechthilde quote); but cf. p.267 re Angela of Foligno.Fiona Bowie, Beguine Spirituality (New York: Crossroad 1990). Along with other authors, Zaehner writes of the mystics' marriage symbolism and erotic imagery. He quotes an exemplary passage of Fran\u00e7ois de Sales (1567-1622),Francis de Sales, Trait\u00e9 de l'amour de Dieu [Treatise on the Love of God]. then continues: > \"Both in mystical rapture and in sexual union reason and intelligence are > momentarily set at naught. The soul 'flows' and 'hurls itself out of > itself'. ...all consciousness of the ego has disappeared. As the Buddhist > would say, there is no longer any 'I' or 'mine', the ego has been swallowed > up into a greater whole.\"Zaehner, Zen, Drugs and Mysticism (1972), p.69 > (Zaehner quote, de Sales); pp. 66-68, 70, 79 (mystical states of religion > compared to LSD, and sex).Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), pp. 158-169, > 171 (sexuality: Hindu and Christian).Cf., Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and > Profane (1957), p.168: in the Hindu 'trinity' sac-cid-ananda Being Aware > Bliss, the Brahman when viewed as bliss is ananda, which is \"the ordinary > word used for sexual pleasure\".Cf., Joseph Mar\u00e9chal, The Psychology of the > Mystics (Bruges 1924; London 1927, reprint Dover 2004), pp. 227-231: sexual > pleasure as a possible element in the mystic ecstasy, experienced by the > nonetheless chaste, whether religious or laity. \"A kernel of truth is hidden > under a mass of error\" (p.230). Yet, when approaching this delicate subject, especially at the chaotic threshold to a New Age, the rapid changes afoot may confound sex talk and conflate opposites, which elicits diverse commentary.E.g., Zaehner, The City within the Heart (1981), p.114: \"contrary to all ancient traditions, the moderns tend to regard the male as the more concupiscent of the two.\"Sylvia Brinton Perera, Descent to the Goddess (Toronto: Inner City 1982).Clarissa Pinkola Est\u00e9s, Women Who Run with the Wolves (Routledge 1992, 1998).Cf., Shulamith Firestone, The Dialectic of Sex (New York: William Morrow 1970). Regarding the transcultural experience of mystical states, however, the traditional analogy of marriage symbolism continues to endure, drawing interest and advocates. Augmenting the above examples is the Dutch mystic Jan van Ruusbroec (1239-1381).Bernard McGinn, The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism 1350-1550 (New York: Herder & Herder 2012), pp. 38-47. Discussion of Jan van Ruusbroec and his \"Bridal mysticism\". Developed is the gospel parable of Christ as the groom, and as the bride the soul of the mystic. Prof. McGinn follows the text of his book The Spiritual Espousals (c.1340).Jan van Ruysbroeck, The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage. Nicolas-Hays, Berwick 2005.Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (9157), p.171. He paraphrases Jan van Ruysbroeck: when the soul finds 'rest in God', the soul may become ablaze in God's love; then the soul's \"living flame kindled by the fire of God is reunited with the divine fire\".Evelyn Underhill, Ruysbroeck (London: Bell & Sons 1914; reprint 2003), pp. 74-75, quoting from Ruysbroeck's The Mirror of Eternal Salvation (1359): > That measureless Love which is God Himself, dwells in the pure deeps of our > spirit, like a burning brazier of coal. And it throws forth brilliant and > fiery sparks which stir and enkindle heart and senses, will and desire, and > all the powers of the soul, with a fire of love; a storm, a rage, a > measureless fury of love. Mommaers & van Bragt, Mysticism Buddhist and Christian. Encounters with Jan van Ruusbroec (New York: Crossroad 1995), pp. 148-149. Zaehner evolved into a committed Christian, whose ethics and morals were founded on his Catholic faith. Accordingly, sexuality is blessed within the context of marriage.Zaehner, Mysticism: Sacred and Profane (1957), p.152. Otherwise sex may become \"a desecration of a holy thing.\" His sexual orientation before and during World War II was said to have been homosexual. During his later life, while a don at Oxford, he became wholly devoted to teaching, research and writing; he abstained from sexual activity.Kripal (2001), pp. 189-193, suggests as part of the story: Zaehner suffered from the era's bias.Ann K. S. Lambton (1975).Zaehner, Our Savage God (1974), pp. 156-160, on Plato's roles regarding a pagan spirituality, as portrayed in Phaedrus, the Symposium, and the Laws (156-158); misuse of Yoga in a \"jujitsu\" of the body (158); and \"the enforced uniformity of Soviet man\" (159-160). ===Typology of mysticism=== In 1958, Zaehner presented a general analysis of the range of mystical experience in the form of a typology. Dasgupta was a source, which Zaehner modified, truncated and refashioned.Cf., Zaehner, Hindu and Muslim mysticism (1960, 1969), p.6. See above, section \"Mystical experience\", subsection \"Hindu and Muslim\".Dasgupta, Hindu Mysticism (1927, 1959). A typology of mystical practice and experience was derived by Dasgupta from the Hindu tradition, texts and literature. The resulting schema of the typology aimed to reflect both the mystic's report of the experience itself and the mystic's personal 'explanation' of it. Commentaries by others found in traditional spiritual literature (spanning centuries) were also referenced. The 'explanations' usually drew the mystic's religious heritage. Of the various typologies suggested by Zaehner,Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957), pp. 66, 168*, 184, 192, 198, 204.Zaehner, At Sundry Times (1958), p.172 (Samkhya- Yogin, Nature, Theistic, Monist).Zaehner, Hindu and Muslim Mysticism (1960), p.19.Zaehner, The Bhagavad Gita (1969), p.2.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), pp. 59, 129, 199-204 (Hindu).Zaehner, Drugs, Mysticism and Make- believe (1972), p.93. the following has been selected here.Zaehner, At Sundry Times (1958), p.172. *(1) Nature mystics, e.g., secular 'oceanic'; *(2) Isolation, interpreted as either:Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy (London: George Allen, Unwin 1923, 2d ed. 1930; reprint Oxford 1989, 2006), volume two. Samkhya and Yoga, and Vedanta, are three of the six orthodox Brahmanical Systems (pp. 19-20). These six \"apparently isolated and independent systems were really members [that could not be completely understood] without regard to their place in the historic interconnection\" (18-19). \"The Samkhya is not a living faith\" (p.28). \"Vedanta determines the world view of the Hindu thinkers of the present time\" (p.430). ** Dualist, e.g., Samkhya-Yogin, or ** Monistic, e.g., non-dualist Vedanta; *(3) Theistic, e.g., Abrahamic religions. An endemic problem with such an analytic typology is the elusive nature of the conscious experience during the mystical state, its shifting linguistic descriptions and perspectives of subject/object, and the psychology of spiritual awareness itself. In addition, each type category is hardly pure, in that there is a great variety of overlap between them.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), pp. 199-200. Furthermore, each religion appears to field contending schools of mystical thought, and often interpretations of subtle conscious states may differ within each of the schools.Reardon (2012), pp. 170-174. When a list of the several proposed typologies suggested by Zaehner over the years are mustered and compared, Fernandes found the results \"unstable\".Fernandes (2004), p.25, cf. pp. 23-25. Accordingly, an observer might conclude that the spiritual map of possible mysticisms would present a confused jumble through which snake perplexing pathways, difficult of analysis. Zaehner's proposals suffer from such endemic difficulties.Newell (1981), p. vi.Schebera (1978), pp. 87-100. Nota bene: Kripal remarks that Zaehner is known for a \"tripartite typology of mystical states\".Kripal (2001), pp. 181, 187. However here four types are discussed. Zaehner's \"Isolation\" composite is divided in its two components: the Dualist, and the Monistic. These two types may be deemed functionally equivalent, yet as self-defined the Monistic experience (of Vedanta) is not an isolated event but instead is connected to the cosmic unity.Reardon (2012), pp. 170-186, discussion regarding the complexities of the nature of Zaehner's \"Isolation\" type. ====Nature mysticism==== Nature mysticism is a term used to catalogue generally those spontaneous experiences of an oceanic feeling in which a person identifies with nature, or is similarly thrown back in awe of the unforgettable, vast sweep of the cosmos. Such may be described philosophically as a form of pantheism, or often as pan-en-hen-ic.Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957), pp. 28; 93, 118, 168, Nature mysicism may also include such a state of consciousness induced by drugs. Like Aldous HuxleyAldous Huxley, The Doors of Perception (New York: Harper and Row 1954). he had taken mescalin, but Zaehner came to a different conclusion. In his 1957 book Mysticism. Sacred and Profane. An Inquiry into some Varieties of Praeternatural Experience, there is a narrative description of the author's experience under the influence of mescalin.Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957), pp. 212-226: a December 1955 mescaline episode supervised by Dr. Smythies of the Psychological Laboratory, Cambridge, with the assistance of Mr. Osborn of the Society for Psychic Research. In part, about nature mysticism, Zaehner relies on William James,Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957, 1961), pp. 36-39, 42-44.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), pp. 41-42.William James, Varieties of Religious Experience.

The Hindu Upanishads were viewed by Zaehner as \"a genuine bridge\" between nature mysticism and theistic mysticism.Zaehenr, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957), p.140. The Hindu aphorism Tat Tvam Asi or thou art that, in referring the individual's unifying Self to the presence of the Deity, may describe the insight that completes the link. Cf., p.118. Such a bridge may otherwise be interpreted as going from nature to monistic mysticism.Cf., Geoffrey Parrinder, \"Robert Charles Zaehner (1913\u20131974)\" in History of Religion 16: 66\u201374, at p.74 (1976). Zaehner himself in his mid-twenties had intensely engaged Rimbaud, Jalal ad-Din Rumi, and the Upanishads; he was becoming a self-described \"nature mystic\". Eventually he converted to Catholicism. A primary aims of Zaehner appeared to be making the distinction between a morally open experience found in nature mysticism as contrasted with the beatific vision of the theist.Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957, 1961), p. xi, 22-23 (union of soul and God), 33 (satcitananda and the beatific vision), 37, 93-94.Cf., Zaehner, Our Savage God (1974), pp. 10\u201312. Zaehner set himself against Aldous Huxley's style of the Perennial Philosophy which held as uniform all mystical experience. Accordingly, he understood Huxley's interpretation of 'nature mysticism' as na\u00efve, self-referent, and inflated, an idea seeded with future misunderstandings.Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957, 1961), pp. v-vi, 1-29.Aldous Huxley, The Perennial Philosophy (New York: Harper and Brothers 1945). Huxley, The Doors of Perception (New York: Harper and Row 1954).Cf., subsection \"Comparative mysticism\". Yet, considering Huxley's conversion to Vedanta and to his immersion in Zen, Zaehner arrived at an appraisal of Huxley that was nuanced, and selectively in accord.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), positive: pp. 37-38 (where he \"rightly saw... the true nature of the soul\"); negative: 438 (\"manifest error\"), 442-443. ====Dualism, e.g., Samkhya==== Samkhya philosophy is an ancient dualist doctrine of India.Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957). Samkhya's understanding of the subjective self seen as an advance on nature mysticism (pp. 125, 109, 60-61). In appraising the experienced world, Samkhya understood it as composed mostly of prakrti (nature, unconscious matter), but also of purusa (the human soul aware). Its dualism puts in contrast the objective seen (prakriti) and the subjective seer (purusa). Long ago Yoga adherents adopted doctrines of Samkhya.Mircea Eliade, Patanjali et le Yoga (Paris: Editions du Seuil 1962; [1969 Eng.tr.], reprint Schocken 1975). Samkhya is oldest of six darsanas (p.11). Patanjali in his Yoga Sutras sought to fit Samkhya teachings to traditional Yoga practice, hence their great similarity. While Samkhya is explicitly atheistic, Yoga darsana was known as \"theistic\" (Eliade's term, p.16), it allowed a small role for the deity Isvara as \"guru of the sages\" (pp. 73-76, 75 quote).Vivekananda, Raja Yoga ([1896], reprint Ramakrishna- Vivekananda Center, 1970). \"Samkhya philosophy [is that] upon which the whole of Raja-Yoga is based\" (pp. 18-19 quote, 160-162). Samkhya darsana is one of Six Orthodox Hindu Astika (p.291). On Hatha Yoga: pp. 23-24.Note Bene: The yoga tradition became transformed, stressing the posture practice of modern yoga. Zaehner's interest, however, was yoga's darsana (point of view), not its asana (postures). Zaehner, Concordant Discord (Oxford 1970), p.97.Mark Singleton, Yoga Body. The origins of modern posture practice (Oxford University 2010). \"Today yoga is virtually synonymous in the West with the practice of asana\" or postural yoga (p.3). \"[P]opular postural yoga came into being in the first half of the twentieth century as a hybridized product of [its] dialogical encounter with the worldwide physical culture movement\" (p.81). For example, Vivekananda (1863-1902) explicitly warned against Hatha Yoga, which he associated with asana or posture practice (pp. 4 and 70-75). As a person pursues his spiritual quest under Samkhya-yoga, his immortal soul (purusa) emerges, becomes more and more defined and distinct, as it separates from entangling nature (prakriti). Prakriti includes even the nature affecting personal qualities, such as the three gunas (modes), the buddhi (universal intellect), the mind (manas), the body, the ahamkara (the ego): all of which the purusa sheds. Of the resulting refined and purified purusa there is yielded the eternity of the yogin's true Self in isolation.Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957), Yoga (pp. 96-99, 111), prakriti and purusa (98, 108, 124-125), gunas (98, 107-108), buddhi (108, 125), the mind or lower soul {Sufi term nafs} (102, 125), the body (125), ahamkara (108, 126).Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), p.97, buddhi is the \"highest and most subtle form of matter\", as \"the seat of cognition\" it determines \"right conduct\".Newell (1981), pp. 160-161, 167-170 (prakriti and purusa re Samkhya). An advanced mystic may attain a recurrent state of tranquil, steady illumination in meditative isolation. The Samkhya understands this as the benign emergence within the practicing yogin of his own purified, immortal purusa. A plurality of purusas exist, as many as there are people. A mystic's own purusa generally is about identical to the many other isolated purusas, each separately experienced from within, by millions of other humans.Kovoor T. Behanan, Yoga. A scientific evaluation (London: Macmillan 1937; reprint Dover 1959, 1964). \"The doctrine of the plurality of souls in the samkhya constitutes an uncompromising departure from the monism of the Upanishads... .\" The monist notion was that \"Brahman was the only reality and individual souls were mere reflections... \" (p.64). Cf. 49, 50. The author studied under Swami Kuvalayananda (pp. xix, 251).Nikunja Vihari Banerjee, The spirit of Indian philosophy (New Delhi: Arnold Heinemann 1974), p. 182-183 (the Samkhya's plurality of purusas). Under the Samkhya, Hindus may refer to this personal, isolated experience of immortality as the purified self, the purusa, or otherwise called the personal atman (Sanskrit: self). Au contraire, a Hindu mystic following a rival school of Vedanta may understand the same tranquil, steady illumination differently (i.e., as not Samkhya's purusa). As Zaehner proposed: the same or similar mystical experience may result in very different theological interpretations.Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957). The Samkhya-yoga and the Advaita Vedanta may interpret differently what is a very similar mystical experience (pp. 146, 153, 164, 204). A major thrust of Zaehner's 1957 book is his typology, i.e., he demonstrates the actual variety of mystical experiences (of what many had assumed were the same); then he divides them into three or four categories (168,184,198). Yet, ironically, Zaehner here also shows that the same or similar experiences may be interpreted very differently, e.g., as Samkhya-yoga or as Advaita Vedanta.Zaehner, Hindu and Muslim (1960), pp. 38-39 (Yoga and Vedanta compared).Fernandes (2004), pp. 57-58. Instead of the isolated purusa experience of Samkhya, the Advaita Vedanta mystic might interpret it as the experience of the Self, which illuminates the mystic's direct connection to the all-inclusive entity of cosmic totality. Such a numinous, universal Self is called Brahman (Sanskrit: sacred power),Zaehner, The City within the Heart (1981), p. 21 (etymologies: Brahman, Atman). or Paramatma.Zaehner, Hinduism (1962, 1966), Brahman (pp. 36-56), the Brahman-Atman synthesis, \"Brahman- Atman-Purusha\" (49-50).B. K. S. Iyengar, Light on Yoga (London 1965, reprint NY: Schocken 1966), p.21. In not-Samkhya Hinduism, the individual yogin's \"Antaratma (the inner self)\" may be realized as connected to the sacred Paramatma (pp. 21, 23-24), also called the Brahman (pp. 314, 315, 325). Here, the Samkhya understands an isolated, purified, eternal purusa (self); the contrary Vedanta mystic would experience a connection to the cosmic Brahman.Fernandes (2004), p.35 (mystical experience similar, theological interpretation different).Cf., John P. Dourley, \"Jung's equation of the ground of being with the ground of the psyche\" in The Journal of Analytical Psychology (Routledge 2011), v. 56/4, pp. 514-531. Hence, the mystical experience (briefly outlined here) is differently interpreted; the subject: (1) may achieve, by separation from prakriti (nature), the goal of immortality of her purusa, purified in isolation within herself; or (2) may become absorbed by discovery of her direct identity with the divine, immortal, luminous Brahman,Iyengar, Light on Yoga (1965, 1966). Iyengar declares that his view of yoga leads one to experience the \"Supreme Universal Spirit\" or Paramatma (p.21), and to a conscious state of \"Supreme Bliss\" (p.53). Cf. p.49: \"union with the Creator\". Thus, Iyengar indicates that his yoga does not follow Samkhya (it might be a hybrid Vedanta or Bhakti yoga). Accordingly, in Zaehner's terms, such experience may be either (1) a dualistic Samkhya atheism, or (2) a monistic type of Advaita Vedanta. Neither for Zaehner can be called theistic, i.e., in neither case is there an interactive, sacred experience with a numinous personality.Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957), pp. 173-174, 181, 203, 206; but 140; see chapters 6, 8, 9.See below, subsection \"Monistic, e.g., Vedanta\". ====Monism, e.g., Vedanta==== [Under construction] In non-dualist Vedanta,Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy (1923, 2d ed. 1930; reprint 2006), volume two.Mysore Hiriyanna, Essentials of Indian Philosophy (London: George Allen & Unwin 1949, reprint Mandala 1978). The Vedanta is divided: Absolutist or Theist, i.e., Brahma understood either as a monism or as a god (p.152).Fernandes (2004), pp. 41-57. About the Vedanta, \"Zaehner focuses his attention primarily on Sankara's Advaita and Ramanuja)'s Visistadvaita.\" Both are non-dualist (p.41, quote). the Hindu mystic would understand reality as nothing but the Divine Unity, inclusive of the mystic subject herself. A special, awesome, impersonal Presence may be experienced. The persistent Hindu, after years of prescriptive discipline to purge her soul, may discover a sacred ocean or inner stream of Being, the Brahman. Such conscious spiritual energy conveys bliss, and transformation.Zaehner, City within the Heart (1981), pp. 141-142 (the bliss of Brahman: the ananda of \"Sat-Cit-Ananda, Being-Thought-Joy\"). What is called 'nature' (prakriti in Samkhya), philosophically, does not exist, according to the Advaita Vedanta of Samkara.Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy (1923, 1930; 2006), v.2, pp. 561-594: Maya, and Advidya (ignorance).Rasvihari Das, Introduction to Shankara. Being parts of Shankara's commentary on the Brahma Sutras rendered freely into English (Calcutta: Firma KLM 1968, 1983). Brahman by Maya (illusion) and ignorance makes the world seem real (pp. iiii-xiii, xv-xvii, xxiv). The objective 'other' is ultimately an illusion or maya.Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and Profane (1957), p.143, pp. 134-135: \"What the Samkhya calls prakrti (Nature)... the Vedanta calls maya or 'illusion'\".Newell (1981). A realized person's antaratma or inner self is directly identical the paramatma, the Supreme Soul or Brahman. As the Upanishads states to the seeker, \"thou art that\", Tat Tvam Asi, i.e., the personal atma is the divine Atma. What Samkhya darsana mistakes for an isolated purusa (self) is really the Brahman: the whole of the universe; all else is illusion.Zaehner, Hindu and Muslim (1960, 1972), pp. 94-95, 97 (\"thou art that\").Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy (1923, 2006), v.2, p.282: even the purusa of the Samkya, however truncated, originated in the concept of the atma found in the Upanishads. Brahma is being, consciousness, bliss.Zaehner, The Comparison of Religions (1970), p.193 (Sac, Cid, Ananda compared to the Trinity).Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy (1923, 1930; 2006), v.2, pp. 539, 483, 539 (saccidananda); pp. 439, 687 (Tat tvam asi). Zaehner focused especially on some Hindu forms of mysticism, i.e., the Astika of the dualist Samkhya and of the non-dualist Vedanta. Not addressed as well were other forms of mysticism, e.g., the Theravada, the Mahayana, the Islamic, and Sankara, Ramauja, as well as various Sufis.Schebera (1978).Fernandes (2004).Reardon (2012).The experience of samadhi as understood in mystical epistemology would not be utterly new but, paradoxically, constitute a person's discovery of a pre-existing, abiding identity to cosmic awareness. The non-dualist finds a complete unity within a subjective sovereignty: ultimately absorption in a numinous presence, the absolute; its is a meditative perception of an all-encompassing \"we\" without any \"they\". The Samkhya dualist, however, understands that in transcendent meditation he will perceive himself as an isolated purusa, purified from enmeshment in an 'objective' prakrti. The mystic experience itself as found in Hindu literature Zaehner presents, as well as its theological filter of explanation.Zaehner, At Sundry Times (1958), pp. 41-43 (Samkhya), pp. 93-94 (Vedanta and Samkhya). ====Theism, e.g., Christian==== [Under construction] Theistic mysticism is common to Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Also Hinduism includes its own form of theistic worship that enjoys a mystical dimension. Ramanuja () articulated its theological schema which departs from the Advaita of Sankara (). According to Zaehner, Christianity and theistic religions offer the possibility of a sacred mystical union with an attentive creator God, whereas a strictly monistic approach instead leads to the self-unity experience of natural religion.Zaehner, Mysticism. Sacred and profane (1957): two chapters discuss Theism and Monism, another two Mescalin (drug-induced states). The Triune Divinity of Christianity is briefly addressed at pp. 195\u2013197.William Lloyd Newell, Struggle and Submission: R. C. Zaehner on Mysticisms (University Press of America 1981), pp. 5-6. Yet Zaehner remained hopeful in the long run of an ever-increasing understanding between religions. \"We have much to learn from Eastern religions, and we have much too to give them; but we are always in danger of forgetting the art of giving--of giving without strings... .\"Zaehner, Christianity and Other Religions (1970), p. 147 (quote).Beatific Vision; contra: Concordant Discord (1970), p.333. Mystical union between the mystic and the Deity in a sense confounds the distinction between dualistic and monistic mysticism. For if the two are identical already, there is no potential for the act of union. Yet the act of divine union also negates a continuous dualism.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), pp. 164-171, discussing Saiva Siddhanta, especially p.168. During the 1940s spent in Iran he returned to the Christian faith. Decades later he published The Catholic Church and World Religions (1964), expressly from that perspective. As an objective scholar, he drew on his acquired insights from this source to further his understanding of others. Zaehner \"did not choose to write to convince others of the truth of his own faith,\" rather \"to frame questions\" was his usual purpose.Michael Dummett, \"Introduction\" (1981), p. xvi (quote). ===Hindu studies=== His translations and the Hinduism book \"made Zaehner one of the most important modern exponents of Hindu theological and philosophical doctrines... . The works on mysticism are more controversial though they established important distinctions in refusing to regard all mysticisms as the same,\" wrote Prof. Geoffrey Parrinder.Parrinder. RCZ (1975), pp. 66\u201374, at p. 74. For Zaehner's Hindu and Muslim Mysticism (1960), and like analyses, see \"Comparative Mysticism\" section. ====Hinduism==== While an undergraduate at Christ Church in Oxford, Zaehner studied several Persian languages. He also taught himself a related language, Sanskrit, used to write the early Hindu sacred books. Decades later he was asked by OUP to author a volume on Hinduism. Unexpectedly Zaehner insisted on first reading in Sanscrit the Mahabharata, a very long epic.Pripal, Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom (2001), pp. 159\u2013160. More than an heroic age story of an ancient war, the Mahabharata gives us the foremost compendium on Hindu religion and way of life.Barend A. van Nooten, The Mahabharata (New York: Twayne 1971). The most influential work of literature in India; yet not a revealed text like the Vedas, but on par with ancient law books and puranas (p. 81). Written in Sanskrit (p. 52), by \"the mythical saint Vyasa\" (\"arranger\") about the 4th century BCE (p. 43). The resulting treatise Hinduism (1962) is elegant, deep, and short. Zaehner discusses, among other things, the subtleties of dharma, and Yudhishthira, the son of Dharma, who became the King of righteousness (dharma raja). Yudhishthira is the elder of five brothers of the royal Pandava family, who leads one side in the war of the Mahabharata. Accordingly, he struggles to follow his conscience, to do the right thing, to avoid slaughter and bloodshed. Yet he finds that tradition and custom, and the Lord Krishna, are ready to allow the usual killing and mayhem of warfare.\"The Mahabharata is a strange kind of book,\" writes Zaeher. As a major hero \"Yudhishthira shows sympathy\" for criticism about the \"injustice\" in the caste laws (dharma) for warriors (kshatriya). Zaehner, Hinduism (1962, 1966), p. 108 (quotes).Cf. van Nooten, The Mahabharata (19171), synopsis pp. 5-42. As explained in Hinduism, all his life Yudhishthira struggles to follow his conscience.Chapters 3 moksha, and 5 dharma. Yet when Yudhishthira participates in the battle of Kuruksetra, he is told by Krishna to state a \"half truth\" meant to deceive. Zaehner discusses: Yudhishthira and moksha (liberation), and karma; and Yudhishthira's troubles with warrior caste dharma.Zaehner, Hinduism (1962, 1966), Yudhishthira: pp. 64-66 (moksha); 107-108, 111, 115-125 (dharma). Warrior caste karma (p.59), dharma (pp. 108\u2013111, Yudhishthira's protest at 111). The Bhagavad Gita describes Krishna's teaching to the Pandava brother Arjuna before the battle of Kuruksetra (pp. 92-100). Yudhishthira is \"ordered to do so by the Lord Krishna\", i.e, to \"lie\" (p.117, quote).Cf. Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), pp. 180-185 et seq. (Krishna advocates war prompting Yudhishthira's dilemma, and opposition), pp. 154, 181 (following Krishna's urging Yudhishthira utters a \"lie\").Buddhadeva Bose, The Book of Yudhisthir (Hyderabad: Sangam 1986), pp.66-70 (Krishna and Yudhishtriya, at Kuruksetra), at 67 (the \"half truth\"). In the last chapter, Yudhishthira 'returns' as Mahatma Gandhi.Zaehner, Hinduism (1962), Chapter 8, Gandhi at pp. 170\u2013187, Gandhi and Yudhishthira at pp. 170-172, 174, 178, 179, 184. \"Gandhi's dilemma was the same as Yudhishthira's\". Was dharma a tradition, or was it his conscience? (p. 170 quote, p. 171). The book closes with the modern poet Rabindranath Tagore (pp. 187-192). Other chapters discuss the early literature of the Vedas, the deities, Bhakti devotional practices begun in medieval India, and the encounter with, and response to, modern Europeans.Hinduism (1962), Chapters 1, 2 & 4, 6, 7. ====Yudhishthira==== Zaehenr continued his discussion of Yudhishthira in a chapter of his book based on his 1967-1969 Gifford Lectures.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), Chapter IX, \"The Greatness of Man and the Wretchedness of God\", pp. 172\u2013193, which devotes attention to Yudhishthira (pp. 176-193).See section below \"Gifford Lectures\". Zaehner finds analogies between the Mahabharata's Yudhishthira and the biblical Job. Yet their situations differed. Yudhishthira, although ascetic by nature, was a royal leader who had to directly face the conflicts of his society. His realm and his family suffered great misfortunes due to political conflict and war. Yet the divine Krishna evidently considered the war and the destructive duties of the warrior (the kshatriya dharma) acceptable. The wealthy householder Job, a faithful servant of his Deity, suffers severe family and personal reversals, due to Divine acquiescence. Each human being, both Job and Yudhishthira, is committed to following his righteous duty, acting in conforming to his conscience.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970): Yudhishthira and Job (pp. 178, 179, 355). The Book of Job proper becomes focus of Zaehner in Ch. XVII, pp. 346-355. Yudhishthira and Krishna (177\u2013182, 184\u2013185, 188\u2013190); kshatriya's \"duty of killing and being killed in war\" (p. 176).Book of Job, ch. 1; ch. 2, v. 1\u201310: God permits Satan to devastate Job and his family. Later without guile Job disputed accusations that he was being punished for commensurate sins, e.g., he says aloud to God, \"You know very well that I am innocent\" (ch. 9, v. 7). When the family advisor Vidura reluctantly challenges him to play dice at Dhrtarastra's palace, \"Yudhishthira believes it is against his moral code to decline a challenge.\"Van Nooten, The Mahabharata (1971), p. 16 (quote).The Mahabharata. 2. The Book of the Assembly Hall 3. The Book of the Forest (University of Chicago 1975), translated and edited by J. A. B. van Buitenen, Book 2, chapter 51 (pp. 125-127, at 125\u2013126): Yudhishthira first agrees to the game of dice at Hastinapura. The second time Yudhishthira agrees to roll the dice, it is expressly stated because he cannot disobey his elder, Dhrtarastra (bk. 2, ch. 67, v. 1\u20134; p. 158). Vidura and Dhrtarastra are his uncles. Despite, or because of, his devotion to the law of dharma, Yudhishthira then \"allowed himself be tricked into a game of dice.\" In contesting against very cunning and clever players, he gambles \"his kingdom and family away.\" His wife becomes threatened with slavery.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970). p. 179 (quotes about the dice game).Zaehner, Hinduism (1962, 1966), p. 107 (the fateful game of dice).Bose, The Book of Yudhisthir (1986), pp. 26, 29:n1, 87:n1 (Yudhishthira rolls the dice, commentary). Among nobles of India then, dice games were an \"addiction\" or \"chief indulgence\", p. 29:n1. Even so, initially Yudhishthira with \"holy indifference\" tries to \"defend traditional dharma\" and like Job to \"justify the ways of God in the eyes of men.\" Yet his disgraced wife Draupadi dramatically attacks Krishna for \"playing with his creatures as children play with dolls.\" Although his wife escapes slavery, the bitter loss in the dice game is only a step in the sequence of seemingly divinely-directed events that led to a disastrous war, involving enormous slaughter. Although Yudhishthira is the King of Dharma, eventually he harshly criticizes the bloody duties of a warrior (the kshatriya dharma), duties imposed also on kings. Yudhishthira himself prefers the \"constant virtues\" mandated by the dharma of a brahmin. \"Krishna represents the old order,\" interprets Zaehner, where \"trickery and violence\" hold \"an honorable place\".Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970, p. 177 (quote: holy); p. 179 (quotes: defend, justify); p. 177 (Draupadi's quote about Krishna). Yudhishthira at first \"defends the established order\" (pp. 178\u2013179). He prefers the brahmin's dharma over the kshatriya's (pp. 177, 179, 184, 188). Draupadi attacks Krishna (pp. 177-178, 347), attacks Yudhishthira (p. 186). Yudhishthira does not attack Krishna, but becomes disgusted with \"a warrior's duty to kill,\" saying after the destructive war: > \"Cursed be the kshatriya code, cursed be physical strength, cursed be > violence through which we have been brought to our present pass. Blessed be > long-suffering, self-control, purity, freedom from strife and slander, > refusal to do another harm, truthful speech, the constant virtues... \"(p. > 184). The Mahabharata [Bks. 2 & 3], trans. and ed. by von Buitenen (1975), Yudhishthira about the brahmins (cf. bk. 3, ch. 177; pp. 563-565). [under construction]. ====Translations==== In his Hindu Scriptures (1966) Zaehner translates ancient sacred texts, his selections of the Rig-Veda, the Atharva- Veda, the Upanishads, and the entire, 80-page Bhagavad Gita. He discusses these writings in his short Introduction. A brief Glossary of Names is at the end.Zaehner (1966), Introduction, pp. v-xxii; e.g., Upanishads, pp. 33\u2013245. \"Zaehner's extraordinary command of the texts\" wast widely admired by his academic peers.Reardon, A Theological Analysis of R. C. Zaehner's Theory of Mysticism (2012), pp. 134\u2013135, at 135 quote. That year Zaehner also published an extensively annotated Bhagavad Gita.The Bhagavad Gita with commentary based on the original sources (1966) by R. C. Zaehner, translated with introduction and appendix. Following a 40-page Introduction: Text translation pp. 43-109, Commentary 111\u2013403, Appendix 405-464, (cf. pp. 4\u20135). which is a prized and celebrated episode of the Mahabharata epic. Before the great battle, the Lord Krishna discusses with the Pandava brother Arjuna the enduring spiritual realities and the duties of his caste dharma. Krishna \"was not merely a local prince of no very great importance: he was God incarnate--the great God Vishnu who has taken on human flesh and blood.\" After his translation, Zaehner provides a long Commentary, which is informed by: the medieval sages Sankara and Ramanuja, ancient scriptures and epics, and modern scholarship. His Introduction places the Gita within the context of the Mahabharata epic and of Hindu religious teachings and philosophy. Issues of the Gita are addressed in terms of the individual Self, material Nature, Liberation, and Deity. The useful Appendix is organized by main subject, and under each entry the relevant passages are \"quoted in full\", giving chapter and verse.Zaehner, The Bhagavad Gita (1966). Quote re Vishnu (p.6); Sankara and Ramanuja (pp. 3, 4, 8; Ramanuja p.40).Gopal, Radhakrishnan (1989), pp. 179, 204\u2013205. His Spaulding chair predecessor at Oxford, Prof. Radhakrishnan, had published a translation of the Gita in 1948. Cf. Zaehner, BG (1966), p.1, n2. ====Sri Aurobindo==== In his 1971 book Evolution in Religion, Zaehner discusses Sri Aurobindo Ghose (1872\u20131950), a modern Hindu spiritual teacher, and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881\u20131955), a French palaeontologist and Jesuit visionary.Zaehner had written on Teilhard for his 1963 book The Convergent Spirit, American title: Matter and Spirit. Their convergence in Eastern Religions, Marx, and Teilhard de Chardin. See \"Cultural evolution\" and \"Materialist dialectics\" subsections below.Teilhard de Chardin, The Phenomenon of Man (Paris 1955; New York: Harper and Row 1959, 1965), was the book that established his public profile. Zaehner discusses each, and appraises their religious innovations.Zaehner delivered the same three lectures in Delhi, Calcutta [Kolkota], and Madras [Chinnai], and at Christian colleges, and a fourth lecture at Madras University. These four lectures comprise his Evolution in Religion (1971). An Appendix contains his short meditation on Death (pp. 115\u2013121), given at St. Stephen's College, Delhi. Aurobindo at age seven was sent to England for education, eventually studying western classics at Cambridge University. On his return to Bengal in India, he studied its ancient literature in Sanskrit. He later became a major political orator with a spiritual dimension, a prominent leader for Indian independence. Hence he was jailed. There in 1908 he had a religious experience. Relocating to the then French port of Pondicherry, he became a yogin and was eventually recognized as a Hindu sage. Sri Aurobindo's writings reinterpret the Hindu traditions.E.g., Aurobindo, Essays on the Gita (Arya 1916-1920; republished: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, 9th ed. 1996; reprint: Lotus Press, Wisconsin, 1995). Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, later President of India, praised him.Radhakrishnan wrote in 1950, \"Aurobindo was the greatest intellectual of our age and a major force for the life of the spirit.\" Quoted in D. Mackenzie Brown, The White Umbrella. Indian political thought from Manu to Gandhi (University of California 1958), pp. 124 [179:n7]. Chap. X on Aurobindo, pp. 122-138. \"As a poet, philosopher, and mystic, Sri Aurobindo occupies a place of the highest eminence in the history of modern India.\"Vishwanath S. Naravane, Modern Indian Thought. A philosophical survey (Bombay: Asia Publishing House 1964; [rev'd ed.]: Orient Longman, Bombay, 1978), quote p.198. 1978 rewritten chapter on \"Sri Aurobindo\" at pp. 193-219, his biography at 195-198. Aurobindo also called 'Aravinda' (p.vi). Before Gandhi he advocated a spiritual basis for Indian politics (p.197).Rudolph & Rudolph, The Modernity of Tradition (1969), p.193. Aurobindo's early career was as a top political leader in India.Peter Heehs, The Lives of Sri Aurobindo (Columbia University 2008). Aurobindo, Zaehner wrote, \"could not accept the Vedanta in its classic non-dualist formulation, for he had come to accept Darwinism and Bergson's idea of creative evolution.\" If the One being was \"totally static\" as previously understood \"then there could be no room for evolution, creativity, or development of any kind.\" Instead, as reported by Zaehner, Aurobindo considered that \"the One though absolutely self sufficient unto itself, must also be the source... of progressive, evolutionary change.\" He found \"the justification for his dynamic interpretation of the Vedanta in the Hindu Scriptures themselves, particularly in the Bhagavad-Gita.\"Zaehner, Evolution in Religion (1971), pp. 10, 11 (quotes). Aurobindo's teaching was a \"clear break\" from both Sankhya Yoga which \"made the sharpest distinction between Spirit and matter\" and from the Vedanta of Sankara (p.10). Aurobindo retained the outlook of a political reformer and, e.g., with regard to caste, \"makes a clean break with traditional values\" (p. 29).K. D. Sethna, in his 1981 book on Zaehner and Teilard Spirituality of the Future, found Zaehner well-read and in \"fine sympathy\" with Aurobindo. Yet however \"well-grounded\" his grasp was not total, e.g. Sri Aurobindo was not influenced by Henri Bergson (pp. 9-10 quotes, 29-30 Bergson). Sethna was the editor of Mother India. Cf. section \"Popular & drug cultures\" for Sethna's stronger criticism of Zaehner. According to Aurobindo, the aim of his new yoga was: > \"[A] change in consciousness radical and complete\" of no less a jump in > \"spiritual evolution\" than \"what took place when a mentalised being first > appeared in a vital and material animal world.\" Regarding his new Integral > Yoga: \"The thing to be gained is the bringing in of a Power of > Consciousness... not yet organized or active directly in earth-nature, > ...but yet to be organized and made directly active.\"Sri Aurobindo, On Yoga, > part 2 (Pondicherry 1958), 6: pp. 105, 107\u2013108, quoted by Sethna (1981), pp. > 31\u201332, [37:n2+n3].Joseph Veliyathil, The Philosophy of Sri Aurobindo. His > idea of evolution (Alwaye, Kerala: Pontifical Institute 1972), pp. 50-51: > Yoga accelerates nature's evolution of consciousness. \"The liberation that > Aurobindo's yoga aims at is not only personal but collective\" (p.53). Aurobindo foresaw that a Power of Consciousness will eventually work a collective transformation in human beings, inviting us as a specie then to actually be able to form and sustain societies of libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9.Zaehner, Evolution in Religion (1971). The Power of Consciousness is also called the divine \"descent of the 'Supermind',\" a spirit of pure consciousness. Otherwise, without such a divine transformation of selfish humans, Aurobindo considered any utopia impossible, and that promised by communists as a vain illusion leading to tyranny (pp. 28-29, 30-31). Zaehner analogizes the Power of Consciousness (Supermind) to Jesus as Logos (pp. 35, 38-39, 77, but cf. 31); Zehner further compares Christian pilgrim journey and sac-cid-\u0101nanda [Being-Consciousness-Joy] (pp. 13, 48, 74). Adherents of Aurobindo's new Integral Yoga (Purna Yoga)Haridas Chaudhuri, Integral Yoga (Wheaton: Quest 1965, 1970), p. 53: \"Integral yoga represents the crowning fulfillment of the yoga systems of India.\" Hatha, Raja, Tantra, Jnana, Bhakti, and Karma are synthesized. seek to lead India to a spiritual awakening, by facilitating an increasingly common soul-experience, in which each person achieves a mystic union with the One. Such a gnosis would be guided by the Power of Consciousness. In choosing to pursue the spiritual realization of social self-understanding, India would hasten the natural evolution of humanity.Naravane, Modern Indian Thought ([1964], 1978): The process of cosmic evolution is preceded by an involution (p. 207), by which the material world is infused with consciousness by the Absolute; thereafter comes the creative evolution. Eventually humans appear and advance until the Supramental links us to pure consciousness, an Absolute: then everyone becomes transformed (pp. 204\u2013205). Aurobindo's \"aim is to combine the western and eastern theories of evolution\" (p. 208). The divine goal of Yoga at p.203. \"Humanity will be transformed into a race of gnostic beings\" (p.212).Sri Aurobindo, On Yoga. I The Synthesis of Yoga (Pondicherry: Sri Aurobindo Ashram 1957, originally in Arya 1914-1921). \"The gnostic (vijnanamaya) being is in its character a truth- consciousnress\" (pp. 557-558). The state of gnosis \"is impossible without ample and close self-identification of ourselves with all existence\" (p.558). To \"learn how to be one self with all\" is key, \"without it there is no gnosis\" (p.559). Gnosis changes \"all our view and experience of our soul-life and of the world around us\" as it is \"the decisive transition in the Yoga\" (p.542). Yet we must \"remember that the gnostic level... is not the supreme plane of our consciousness but a middle or link plane\" (p.553). Hence furthering the conscious commitment everywhere, to collaborate with the hidden drive of creative evolution toward a spiritual advance, is high among the missions of Aurobindo's new 'Integral Yoga'.Sethna, Spirituality of the Future (1981), p. 267: Such human collaboration [in evolutionary time] is a spiritual quest that \"by a concentrated effort of the entire being [may] accomplish in a short time the results that, with less clear vision and less inward pressure, might take millennia.\"Sri Aurobindo, The Future Evolution of Man. The Divine Life upon Earth, compiled with a summary and notes by P. B. Saint-Hilaire (Pondicherry 1963), e.g., pp. 25-29 ('Life evolves out of Matter, Mind out of Life, Spirit out of Mind'), 40-41 (reason and inspiration), 64-66 (justice and freedom), 72-73 (spiritual experience and inner realization), 93-94 (the power to transform our being), 123-126 (personality of the gnostic beings), ~~~~131 (wholly aware of one's self/being), 137-143 (entirely new and conscious human facilities). Cf., Michael Murphy, The Future of the Body (Los Angeles: Tarcher 1992), re Aurobindo, pp. 47, 173, 182-182, 187-190, 229-230, 553-554. \"It must be remembered that there is Aurobindo the socialist and Aurobindo the mystic.\"Zaehner, Evolution in Religion (1971), p. 36 (quote). ===Gifford lecture at St Andrews=== Zaehner gave the Gifford Lectures in Scotland during the years 1967\u20131969. In these sessions he revisits comparative mysticism and Bucke, focuses on Hinduism and Buddhism, Yudhishthira and later Job, discusses Taoist classics, Neo-Confucianism, and Zen. He doesn't forget Jung or Zoroaster, Marx or Teilhard. The result is a 464-page book: Concordant Discord. The Interdependence of Faiths. In the course of the discourse, he mentions occasionally a sophisticated view: how the different religions have provided a mutuality of nourishment, having almost unconsciously interpenetrated each other's beliefs. The historically obfuscated result is that neighbouring religions might develop the other's theological insights as their own, as well as employ the other's distinctions to accent, or explain, their own doctrines to themselves. Although Zaehner gives a suggestive commentary at the conjunction of living faiths, he respects that each remains distinct, unique. Zaehner allows the possibility of what he calls the convergence of faiths, or solidarity.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970). Preface. Zaehner writes of the \"missing link\" between Zen and theism ( p. 304), and \"the Hindu bridge\" (p. 297), as pathways to convergence.Newell, Struggle and Submission (1981), pp. 24-33 (convergence, solidarity). A false convergence is also possible (p. 252). Regarding the world religions Zaehner held, however, that we cannot use the occasional occurrence of an ironic syncretism among elites as a platform from which to leap to a unity within current religions. His rear-guard opinions conflicted with major academic trends then prevailing. \"In these ecumenical days it is unfashionable to emphasize the difference between religions.\" Yet Zaehner remained skeptical, at the risk of alienating those in the ecumenical movement whose longing for a festival of conciliation caused them to overlook the stubborn divergence inherent in the momentum. \"We must force nothing: we must not try to achieve a 'harmony' of religions at all costs when all we can yet see is a 'concordant discord'... At this early stage of contact with the non-Christian religions, this surely is the most that we can hope for.\"Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), p. 383 (\"unfashionable\" quote), p. 7 (\"force nothing\" quote). Cf. p. 296-299: ecumenical strategies Christian and Zen. ===Social ideology and ethics=== ====A militant state cult==== Zaehner used a comparative-religion approach in his several discussions of Communism, both as philosophical- religious theory (discussed below),For dialectical materialism of Marx and Engels: section below. and here in its practical business running a sovereign state. In its ideological management of political and economic operations, Soviet party rule was sometimes said to demonstrate an attenuated resemblance to Catholic Church governance. Features in common included an authoritarian command structure (similar to the military), guided by a revered theory (or dogma), which was articulated in abstract principles and exemplars that could not be questioned.Zaehner, \"A new Buddha and a new Tao\", per section \"Marxian communism and dialectical materialism\" at 406-412; and his \"Conclusion\" 413-417, at 415-416, 417, in his Concise Encyclopedia (1967). Here Marxism is the \"new Tao\".Zaehner, Dialectical Christianity (1971), pp. 32, 37-38 (Communist theory).Cf., Gustav A. Wetter, Dialectical Materialism ([Wien: Herder 1952]; rev. ed., New York: Praeger 1958), pp. 554-561; at p.560: Communism a perverse \"counter-church\". For the Marxist-Leninist adherent, the 'laws of nature', i.e., dialectical materialism, was the orthodox, mandatory scientism. It dominated the political economy of society through its application, historical materialism.Herbert Marcuse, Soviet Marxism. A critical analysis (Columbia University 1958, Vintage 1961), pp. 128-130. The split of materialism into dialectical and historical was foreign to Karl Marx, but was orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, where as \"codified into an ideology and interpreted by officials of the Party, [it] justified policy and practice\" (p.129 quote). Accordingly, a complex dialectic involving class conflict provided a master key to these \"natural\" laws, however difficult to decipher.J. M. Bochenski, Soviet Russian Dialectical Materialism ([Bern: Francke 1950]; 3d ed. rev., Dordrecht: Reidel 1963), pp. 102-103 (Communist party fights the class warfare on behalf of the proletariat). Called \"diamat\" in 'Soviet speak' it was the cutting edge of the ideology (p.1).Leon Trotsky, Their Morality and Ours (New York: Pathfinder 1969), the 1938 title essay (pp. 15-53).

For self-consciousness which transforms man into a rational animal is a qualitative leap in the evolutionary process... life becomes conscious of itself.Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), p.326 (quote). Zaeher next quotes Bucke favorably on same subject.The Tao Te Ching (c.600 BCE), 38, is quoted by Zaehner a few pages earlier (Concordant Discord p.329), as he raised the possibility, regarding Adam's sin, that knowledge itself is evil, as it meddles with the original harmony of nature, the 'uncarved block' of the Taoists. Cited also is the traditional Jewish view of Adam's disobedience, p.333.Cf., Erich Neumann, Depth Psychology and a New Ethic (Zurich 1949; New York: G. P.
