    "text": "\"Djibouti\" (, , Arabic: \u062c\u064a\u0628\u0648\u062a\u064a Jibuti ) is the national anthem of Djibouti. ==History== The Djibouti national anthem was adopted upon independence from France in 1977. The words are in Somali, and were written by Aden Elmi. The melody was composed by Abdi Robleh. The anthem was first officially played at an independence ceremony on June 27, 1977. ===Historical references=== Thematically, Elmi's lyrics reference the country's flag as it relates to Djibouti's struggle for independence. The French had staked claim to the region known as French Somaliland in the mid-1800s. For the next century, the region was overseen by a series of French governors. The area served as a backdrop for French battles with various opponents including Russia and Italy. In 1958, a referendum was held in Djibouti to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France,Barrington, Lowell, After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States, (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p. 115 but there were reports of vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls.Kevin Shillington, Encyclopedia of African history, (CRC Press: 2005), p. 360 . In August 1960, an official visit to the territory by then French President, General Charles de Gaulle, was also met with demonstrations and rioting.A Political Chronology of Africa, (Taylor & Francis), p. 132.Newsweek, Volume 81, (Newsweek: 1973), p. 254. On 19 March 1967, a second plebiscite was held. Similar to the 1959 referendum, voting was also divided along ethnic lines, with the resident Somalis generally voting for independence, with the goal of eventual reunion with Somalia, and the Afars largely opting to remain associated with France. There were again reports of vote rigging on the part of the French authorities.American Universities Field Staff, Northeast Africa series, Volume 15, Issue 1, (American Universities Field Staff.: 1968), p. 3. Announcement of the results sparked civil unrest, including several deaths. France also increased its military force along the frontier.Jean Strouse, Newsweek, Volume 69, Issues 10-17, (Newsweek: 1967), p. 48.Alvin J. Cottrell, Robert Michael Burrell, Georgetown University. Center for Strategic and International Studies, The Indian Ocean: its political, economic, and military importance, (Praeger: 1972), p. 166. Soon after, the territory was renamed French Territory of the Afars and Issas, but a growing Somali and Afar population united led to a vote for independence in 1977, officially marking Djibouti's independence.Elections in Djibouti African Elections Database ==Music== The melody by Abdi Robleh is written in common 4/4 time. It consists of twenty measures. ==Anthem== {|class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"15\" rules=\"cols\" align= border=1 cellpadding=7 cellspacing=0 style=\"margin: 0 0 0 1em; background: #ffffff; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; text-align:left; font- size: 95%;\" |- style=\"text-align:center; background: lightblue; border- bottom:2px solid black;\" !
