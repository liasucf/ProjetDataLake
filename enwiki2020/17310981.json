    "text": ", also known as , is a sh\u014dnen horror manga written and illustrated by Yoshiki Tonogai. The series focuses on the \"Rabbit Doubt\" cell phone game, with rules similar to Mafia. The players must find the wolf, or killer, amongst their group of rabbits as they are picked off one-by-one. Six players of this game find themselves trapped in a building with one of the group already dead; to avoid the same fate, the remaining five must play a real-life game of \"Rabbit Doubt\" and find the wolf (liar) hiding among them. The manga was first serialized in Square Enix's Monthly Sh\u014dnen Gangan on July 12, 2007 and ended its run on February 12, 2009. Square Enix also released the first volume on December 22, 2007 and released the fourth and final volume on February 12, 2009. The series has continued with two spiritual sequels, titled Judge, from January 12, 2010 to August 11, 2012, and Secret, from October 12, 2013 to February 12, 2015. ==Plot== Doubt revolves around a fictional cell phone game called \"Rabbit Doubt\", in which the players are rabbits in a colony; one of these players is randomly chosen to act as a wolf infiltrating the group. Each round, the rabbits guess which is the wolf as the rabbits are eaten one-by-one until only the wolf is left. In the story, four players of the \"Rabbit Doubt\" game Y\u016b Aikawa, Eiji Hoshi, Haruka Akechi, Rei Hazama and a non-player Mitsuki H\u014dyama meet to relax together. They are knocked unconscious and awaken in an abandoned psychiatric hospital, filled with security cameras, to meet Hajime Komaba, a medical student, and discover Rei hanged. The group finds Rei's cell phone and realize that they're playing a real-life game of \"Rabbit Doubt\". To survive, the wolf, described as the liar, must die. Later, the groups tries to find an exit and the wolf using bar codes found imprinted on their bodies. However, their chances are limited as each bar code will open only one door. Y\u016b discovers that he does not have a barcode anywhere on his body. He tries to hide this fact by lying, saying his code was on his stomach so no one would doubt him and say he was the wolf. Eiji is furious that this game has someone killing each other and only ceases to cause pain and anger. Accusing Hajime, who was not with the group when captured, of being the wolf and hitting Y\u016b, he is locked in a room. After unlocking a room with surveillance cameras in them, the group find a mysterious guy under a rabbit's headgear. He later dies from a poison thumbtack under the headgear, which, when removed, would prick the unknown guy. They use Hajime's barcode to unlock a library, and there they find a book of everyone's hidden secrets, even Mitsuki. This causes the group to doubt one another. Haruka accuses Mitsuki being the wolf, attacks her and locks her in the bathroom. The group tie up Y\u016b in the surveillance room where he witnesses Eiji's death for a brief second. Hajime unties Y\u016b to check on Eiji, just to find his hand chopped off and the door stuck. Afterwards, the roles are reversed and Hajime is tied up and Mitsuki is placed in the hospital bed from Haruka's attack. Y\u016b checks the wolf's room which was unlocked thanks to the mysterious guy's barcode. He checks the rabbit headgears and finds Haruka's head in one of them. Y\u016b runs back to check on Mitsuki only to find Hajime on the floor, untied and attacked, and Mitsuki has been hung. Both accuse each other of being the wolf. Later, Hajime is attacked by Mitsuki, who had faked her own death. Mitsuki accuses Y\u016b of lying to not only the group, but to her, personally. She says she gave everyone a barcode except Y\u016b to throw suspicion on him so they would lock him up, so Mitsuki could kill everyone and escape with Y\u016b. Mitsuki reveals to Y\u016b how everyone in the group had lied. Eiji had lied about being a friendly guy, but in reality he had gotten someone killed when he went to war with a neighboring city. Haruka seemed charismatic and kind but was actually the leader of her high school's prostitution ring, where she even blackmailed the customers. Hajime had killed a little girl while practicing at his father's hospital, but the news was swept under the rug to protect him. She receives a call on her cellphone and steps away to answer. It is revealed to be Mitsuki's father (who has planned the game) calling. He had agreed to be the guarantor on a friend's loan, but he was betrayed and saddled with an enormous debt, and he attempted suicide. For this Mitsuki explains that she wants to punish all liars to achieve her father's revenge, and thus she no longer trusts Y\u016b, because he lied to her about not being able to hang out with her after school a week ago. In reality, he had been out with a female classmate to secretly buy Mitsuki a birthday present, but Mitsuki saw them together and assumed that they were a couple, even killing the classmate. When Mitsuki leaves to kill Hajime, Hajime reaches Y\u016b and reveals his real identity as a detective investigating teenage disappearances and hands him a scalpel to use as a weapon. Y\u016b and Hajime successfully knock Mitsuki out. When Y\u016b tries to open the exit with Mitsuki's bar code, Rei is revealed to be alive and she identifies herself as the actual wolf. Previously, Mitsuki had gone to Rei seeking advice help to ease her pain with hypnosis, but led her down a path of revenge. Rei is seeking revenge because the media believed her hypnosis was a sham, causing her parents who supported her to commit suicide. In order to achieve revenge, she lied about her accident, manipulated Mitsuki, using hypnosis to pretend to be her father, who actually died in the hospital, and giving her orders as 'him'. Rei had used the mysterious man to kill previous players of Rabbit's Doubt. Rei orders Mitsuki to kill Yuu, however, the love Mitsuki has for Y\u016b occasionally overpowers the hypnosis. Rei releases the surviving players and calls the police. Mitsuki, who has fallen into a coma, is accused of the murders as there is no evidence of Rei being there. At the hospital, Y\u016b receives a call from Rei. She reveals that the reason there was no evidence of her presence at the game site is because one of the forensics agents working the scene is one of her Wolves, and although Y\u016b tries to contact Hajime (who is at the scene to find evidence) about it, he is too late to save him from being strangled. Rei also tricks him into saying a phrase that causes Mitsuki to awaken in her \"wolf mode\": 'For the ones I love'. In the last scene, she approaches Y\u016b with a knife. ==Characters== *Y\u016b (Yuu) Aikawa: a kind and caring student, he knows how to be cold-blooded but also takes action if necessary.

Two years later, he wakes up one day handcuffed in a dark building, wearing a heavy rabbit mask. After a few steps, he enters a courtroom where seven other teenagers, also dressed in animal masks, await him, as well as a young boy who has died. Each animal mask represents one of the seven deadly sins: gluttony (pig), avarice (fox), sloth (bear), pride (lion), lust (cat), envy (rabbit) and anger (horse). A video tells them through a stuffed toy the rules of the game in which they are forced to participate: every twelve hours, a voting takes place during which they would have to choose to sacrifice one of them until only four survivors remain in the game. * Hiroyuki \"Hiro\" Sakurai: he is the main character of the manga. He was in love with his childhood friend Hikari, who was dating his older brother Atsuya. He decides one day, nevertheless, to confess his feelings, by shifting an appointment that she had with Atsuya, but this initiative indirectly caused the death of the latter, hit by a truck. Two years later, Hiro finds himself in a dark place, handcuffed and wearing a rabbit mask, symbol of the sin of envy, for provoking the death of his brother, before meeting eight other teenagers in a courtroom, one of whom died before his arrival. The end of the manga reveals that Hiro was the mastermind of the game alongside Hikari, with both aiming to make the judge and jury members who acquitted the drunken truck driver who ran over his brother watch their family members die before being killed themselves.

The third victim of the game, killing himself with a poisoned needle. * Rina Okamoto: a high-school girl whose alleged sin is avarice, represented by a fox mask, although she shows no trace of this trait.

After seeing her grandfather in another game, she vowed to somehow save him. Killed by Hayato's father with a cross-bow arrow shot through her forehead. * \"The Pig Guy\": an overweight boy, found dead next to a pig mask as soon as the other participants were allowed to remove their masks, due to removing his mask before he was authorized to do so by Kazu.

Later, Kazuyaki falls and is hung with a pipe and chain. *Hikari: a sweet-looking girl, who is best friends with Hiro. She had gotten advice to ask out the person she loves and asks out Hiro's brother, Atsuya, without knowing Hiro has deep feelings for her.

During the events of the game, Hiro and Hikari had been planning to exact revenge on the judges, jury and their loved ones who had been paid off to say the driver was innocent when proof showed the driver was not. With the loved ones playing the game, the judges and jury watch. Kazuyuki was the only one to figure out their plans, but it was too late.

Kunikida had found Toono's bookmark that she gave to Futami and was planning to throw it over the roof. Futami grabs her and lets go of the bookmark, which causes Futami to leap over the roof's railing in an attempt to catch it. As he does, he falls to his death.

Due to catching a fever, he did not go on the field trip. Leaving a suicide note behind, he jumps off the roof and dies. In the note, he reveals he has survivor's guilt, but his mother and Sanada did not believe this was the case. After finding evidence proving he was never suicidal, Sanada puts the clues together and finds out it was Kunikida who wrote the note and accidentally forced Futami to jump off of the roof after confessing her unrequited love for him. Due to his apparent suicide, a suicide net is placed on the roof of the school. *Ami Toono: a classmate who died in the bus accident. Shima liked her due to her kindness. Toono was dating Futami and was pregnant with his child. It is believed Futami committed suicide due to her and the baby's death. During the accident, Sanada believes he killed Toono by pulling a metal rod out of her back, but that was not the case since she would have burned alive. Later, it is revealed Toono is Mitomo's sister and that Mitomo had a one-sided incestuous love for her. *Ryou Shimizu: a classmate who is a known heartbreaker that was killed after the bus had crashed. When the accident had occurred, Shimizu was trapped under seats. He bribes Shima to save him implying he would use Toono and then throw her so Shima could pick her up in an emotional state.
