Pell was cared for by her paternal uncle, Stephen Hyatt Pell (1874\u20131950) and raised at Fort Ticonderoga, the family mansion on Lake Champlain. The house is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and a U.S. National Historic Landmark. Her other uncle was tennis player Theodore Pell.

Welsh reads the proclamation renaming the plaza in Puget-Th\u00e9niers in honor of Isabel Pell as Pell looks on In 1921, Pell went to work in a dress shop, a position felt to be below her social standing. In 1922 she quit to become an actress, playing a small part in Fools Errant at the Maxine Elliott Theatre. In 1930, Pell worked for the real estate firm Pell and MacMillen in New York. She collaborated with the fashion writer Lois Long and the interior decorator Elsie de Wolfe. While in France during World War II, Pell took the name of \"Fredericka\" and joined the Maquis. She moved inland in the mountain and served for four years, until September 1944, and was known among the resistance as \"the girl with the blonde m\u00e8che (lock)\". Pell was captured by Italian soldiers and interned at Puget-Th\u00e9niers, but continued to smuggle information to the resistance during her daily walks at the camp. When she was released, she disguised herself as a peasant and went to a mountain forest with her lover, the Marquise Claire Charles-Roux De Forbin (1908\u20131992). A report in the Associate Press recounts how, in 1944, Pell rescued a contingent of American soldiers surrounded by the enemy in Tanaron. Pell was wearing the badge of Free France and came out from her hiding place, leading the men to safety. On November 28, 1944, the plaza in Puget-Th\u00e9niers was renamed in her honor. ==Personal life== Eleanora Sears (right) attending a tennis tournament with her date, Isabel Pell, in the 1920s In February 1924, Pell was briefly engaged to R.
