    "text": "The Hyundai \u03b2-series engines are 1.6 L to 2.0 L straight-4 built in Ulsan, South Korea. All \u03b2-series engines are dual overhead camshaft valvetrain (DOHC) design. The \u03b2-series engine uses a direct-acting overhead cam valvetrain arrangement which places the camshaft in the cylinder head above the pistons and combustion chamber and operates the valve tappets/lifters directly. The \u03b2-series engine's ignition system is designed to ignite the fuel/air charge that enters each cylinder by producing a high voltage spark at the exact moment for maximum efficiency. All \u03b2-series versions are equipped with a Distributorless Ignition System (DIS). The system consist of the ignition coil assembly, Camshaft Position Sensor (CMP), Powertrain Control Module (PCM), spark plug wires and spark plugs. The \u03b2-series or the Beta family includes the following engine codes: G4GR, G4GB, G4GC, G4GF and G4GM. == \u03b2-1.6D G4GR == The 1.6-liter Hyundai G4GR (\u03b2-1.6D) engine was assembled from 1995 to 2001 at the Ulsan plant. Unlike other representatives of the Beta series, this engine did not receive the second generation and was replaced by the power unit Alpha II. In a number of markets, a deferred version of 90 hp was sold.https://otoba.ru/dvigatel/hyundai/g4gr.html#tth The \u03b2-1.6D (Engine code: G4GR) is an in-line, spark-ignition 4-stroke, dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) 16 valve engine and had two (2) variants depending on the vehicle's sub-model. There was a Beta I G4GR DOHC 16v version for the GL sub-models (Europe Germany market) with an advertised power of 66 kW/ 89 hp/ 90 PS (ECE) and 126 Nm/ 93 lb-ft of torque and the Beta I G4GR DOHC 16v version for the GLSi and LSi sub- models (Europe UK market) advertised power of 84 kW/113 hp/114 PS (ECE) with 143 Nm / 105 lb-ft of torque.

The vehicles sold in this market were equipped with an Adjusting Potentiometer, idle mixture (OEM part: 3950022000) All models except the Hyundai Coupe-I equipped with the Beta-I G4GR DOHC did not include a Mass Air Flow (Air Mass) sensor which can be purchased separately. For aftermarket barometric pressure (MAP) sensor installation, an integrated Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) and the Intake Air Temperature (IAT) sensor is available. The Beta-I series G4GR 66 Kw (89 hp) engine was equipped on the following vehicles listed below: Hyundai Elantra (J2) 1.6 16v GL (four-door sedan) from 11-1995 to 09-2000 The Beta-I series G4GR 84 Kw (115 hp) engine was equipped on the following vehicles listed below: Hyundai Coupe-I (RD) 1.6 16v from 03-1998 to 06-2000 Hyundai Coupe-I (RD) 1.6 16v from 06-2000 to 04-2002 Hyundai Elantra (J2) 1.6 16v GLSi (four-door sedan) from 11-1995 to 09-2000 Hyundai Elantra (J2) 1.6 16v GLSi (four-door sedan) from 11-1995 to 09-2000 Hyundai Elantra (J2) 1.6 16v LSi (four-door sedan) from 11-1995 to 09-2000 Hyundai Elantra (J2) 1.6 16v GLS (Wagon) from 02-1996 == \u03b2-1.8D G4GM == The 1.8-liter Hyundai G4GM engine (\u03b2-1.8D) was manufactured from 1995 to 2003 at the Ulsan enterprise and was put on several popular models of the Korean concern, for example the Elantra and Coupe. The motor was assembled for eight years and after it was replaced with a similar in volume unit of the Beta II series. SPECIFICATIONS: Cylinder bore: 82 mm (3.228 in.) Stroke: 85 mm (3.346 in.)

The motor was produced only five years and after it gave way to the power unit of the Beta II series, which became a real bestseller. The G4GF (also called the 2.0 D) is the 2.0L (1975cc) version, having debuted in 1997 as the uplevel engine for the original Hyundai Tiburon. It shares the 82 mm bore of the 1.8 but is stroked to 93.5 mm. It has a cast iron engine block and aluminum DOHC cylinder head. It uses MFI fuel injection, has four valves per cylinder and features powdered cast steel connecting rods. OPA Output is 140 hp (102 kW) at 6000 rpm and ==\u03b2-1.8D G4GB== The 1.8-liter Hyundai G4GB engine was manufactured from 2000 to 2010 in Korean Ulsan and was put on such popular models of the concern as Elantra, Cerato and Matrix. The motor belonged to the Beta II series therefore had an upgraded design relative to its predecessors. ==\u03b2-2.0D G4GC== The 2.0-liter Hyundai \u03b2-2.0D G4GC engine was produced from 2001 to 2012 at the company in Ulsan and was put on numerous popular models of the concern, such as Elantra, Sonata and Tucson. The power unit belonged to the \u03b2-2.0D G4GC (Beta II) series and since 2003 it was equipped with a phase regulator at the inlet.https://otoba.ru/dvigatel/hyundai/g4gc.html#tth The \u03b2-2.0D G4GC engine is equipped with the CVVT timing system. The engine is reliable and unpretentious, has a high resource of more than 300 thousand km. The \u03b2-2.0D G4GC is the oldest model of the 2nd generation \u03b2-series (Beta II) family. Four-stroke, four-cylinder petrol with electronic control system of fuel injection and ignition, with in-line arrangement of cylinders and pistons rotating one common crankshaft, with the top arrangement of two camshafts (with the CVVT system). The engine has a closed-type liquid cooling system with forced circulation. The lubrication system is combined: under pressure and spraying. The head of the block of cylinders' \u03b2-2.0D G4GC' is made of an aluminum alloy. The drive of the camshafts is carried out by a toothed belt. The belt itself drives only the exhaust camshaft and the intake camshaft is driven from the exhaust by means of a chain, it is in the rear of the cylinder head as is the mechanism for changing the valve timing. On the engine there are no hydraulic compensators, adjustment of backlashes of valves is required at run in 90 thousand in km. During 2001-2002, the new \u03b2-2.0D G4GC engine made its debut in models such as the XD Elantra and GK Tiburon. Output is 138 hp (102 kW) at 6000 rpm with of torque at 4500 rpm. It has a cast iron engine block and aluminum DOHC cylinder heads. The latest version of the 2.0L Beta engine (G4GC) features CVVT, which exists only on the intake side, a first for Hyundai/Kia. The following changes were noted. * Redesigned block with external contouring of cylinder bores (instead of flat sides), extra ribbing and one extra transaxle fixing point (now 5)(less NVH) * Crankshaft now has 8 counterweights instead of 4.(NVH) * Cast & ribbed aluminium sump pan (instead of pressed steel sheet) with stronger joint to transaxle (NVH) * Reshaped combustion chambers, ports & pistons (performance, [fuel] economy, emissions) * longer intake rams, 8% smaller surge tank, resonator added, spark timing and valve lift optimized, lighter valve springs, denser conrod bearings, returnless fuel system (instead of return type) with higher fuel pressure and smaller injectors (torque spread and economy) * Cylinder head machined to more precise tolerances * Head gasket now 2-layer (instead of 3) * Idle speed reduced to 700 rpm from 800 rpm (NVH) * Hydraulic engine mounts (4) instead of rubber (NVH) * Heat shield installed between engine and air filter, reducing heating of induction air. * New camcover with I-piece high-specific gravity polypropylene baffle (ilo 2-piece pp) * Oil flow reduced (economy) * Mechanical valve lash adjusters (solid lifters) replace hydraulic, improving valve clearance precision (durability). * Lower valve spring load reduces valve train friction (performance). * Engine cover installed (NVH and dress up engine bay) * Catalytic converter now upstream adjoining exhaust manifold (ilo under car) (emissions) * Other detail changes to: alternator, intake manifold brace, power steering & a/c pulleys, idle speed actuator, oil filler cap & drive plate between engine & torque converter In 2008 the Beta II was modified to produce and of torque. ===Applications=== * Hyundai Elantra * Hyundai i30 * Hyundai Lavita * Hyundai Santamo * Hyundai Tiburon * Hyundai Trajet * Hyundai Tucson * Kia Cee'd * Kia Cerato * Naza Citra * Kia Soul (MY2009-2011) * Kia Spectra * Kia Sportage ==See also== * List of Hyundai engines ==References== ==External links== *Autoweb - Hyundai Tiburon Scene Stealer Beta Category:1995 introductions Category:Inline-four engines Category:Gasoline engines by model ",
