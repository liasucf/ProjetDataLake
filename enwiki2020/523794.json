The village is named after one of the two girls Agamemnon took from Lesbos during the ten- year Trojan War. Five kilometers south is the famous Vatera beach. On June 12, 2017 Vrissa was severely damaged in an earthquake that struck approximately 12 km South of the town of Plomari. Most people could not return to their homes, rendering the village effectively a \"ghost village\". ==See also== *List of settlements in Lesbos Category:Populated places in Lesbos ",
