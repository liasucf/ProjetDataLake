The community takes its name from Frederick Avenue in St. Joseph, Missouri. Originally located just west of the 102 River, Avenue included a telephone exchange and a few stores. Avenue City later became associated with two stores located east of the 102 River. Currently only one store remains, which includes a gas station and small grocery store. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Andrew County, Missouri Category:Unincorporated communities in Missouri ",
