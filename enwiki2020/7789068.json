The episode has received generally positive reviews from critics. Robert Canning on IGN named it as one of the three \"outstanding\" episodes of the eighteenth season. He gave it an 8.5/10 rating and commented that it was \"by far one of the best Simpsons episodes from the past few seasons. Jokes and gags came fast and furious, all while telling a great story in a cleverly unconventional way,\" and added that \"At its core, 'Springfield Up' was a simple story about Homer feeling the need to impress the snooty British documentarian, but then realizing his life wasn't as bad as he thought. It's a tale we've seen on The Simpsons time and again, but the fresh twist of having it presented within Desmond's documentary made it very memorable.\" TV Squad's Adam Finley wrote: \"I didn't love it, and I didn't hate it \u2014 for the most part, this week's episode was 'just okay' in my opinion. It was nice to see Eric Idle return [...], but the episode felt like two different episodes battling for the same thirty-minute space. [...] In this episode we spend a lot of time learning about those who grew up in Springfield, but Homer's story is also wedged into the mix \u2014 it seems the episode should have just been about Homer feeling depressed about his life, or a lighter episode focusing on all the resident of Springfield. I'm not saying the episode was a complete write off, because I think it was still funny, just a little thinner than I come to expect from this series.\" ==References== == External links == * * Category:The Simpsons (season 18) episodes Category:2007 American television episodes ",
