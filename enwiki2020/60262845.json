    "text": "Poland\u2013South Korea relations is the diplomatic relationship between the Republic of Poland and Republic of Korea. ==History== Poland and Korea first had official contacts in 20th century when they were subjects of Russian Empire and Empire of Japan respectively. Due to suffering similar oppression, the Koreans and Poles shared strong sympathy, and the March 1st Movement, which aimed to form an independent Korea, made Koreans compared to the Poles of Asia. However, relations between the Polish People's Republic and Republic of Korea did not exist after World War II, when the republics were established and aligned with opposing blocs in the Cold War. Poland supported North Korea against South Korea and virtually no relations between Poland and South Korea existed throughout the Cold War, in which the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was recognized by Polish People's Republic as the legitimate representative of all Korea. It was not until the 1990s when the Cold War ended that Poland and South Korea established relations. ==Today== Following the end of Cold War, Poland and South Korea's relations dramatically improved and eventually became a strategic partnership. South Korea was the first Asian country to officially loaned 450$ million economic aids to Poland. With the relations head higher, Poland and South Korea aimed to increase their good relationship. South Korea deputy minister of Foreign Affairs, Kim Hyung-zhin, praised Poland as one of the best and most influential countries. Investments from South Korea continues to increase as for the result of the good relationship between two countries. Poland is also a consumer of Korean networking technology and mobile communications technology. In 2018, Polish President Andrzej Duda expressed his wish to support a United Nations-led initiative over Korea, aiming for peaceful unification between the two halves of the Korean peninsula. == Resident diplomatic missions == * Poland has an embassy in Seoul. * South Korea has an embassy in Warsaw.
