    "text": "For the \"Rote Fl\u00fch\" feature on the North Face of the Eiger, see Eiger. The Rote Fl\u00fch is a peak in the Tannheim Mountains, a sub-range of the Allg\u00e4u Alps. It is 2,108 metres high. The Rote Fl\u00fch is built from Wetterstein limestone. It gets its name (which means \"red rock face\") from the layers of embedded particles of red limestone rock that appear reddish as the sun goes down. == Location and surrounding area == The ar\u00eate of Judenscharte links the Rote Fl\u00fch with the Gimpel to the north. The optically unimpressive ridge of the east ar\u00eate bears its own name, the Hochwieseler, on account of the number of climbing routes on its south face. Along the almost two-kilometre-long West Ar\u00eate, from which the Schartschrofen rises, runs the Friedberger Klettersteig to the col of F\u00fcssener J\u00f6chl which is served by a cable car. The prominence of the Roten Fl\u00fch is at least 108 metresExact value not known; given value is a minimum, (but it could be up to 19 metres higher). It was deduced from the spacing of the 20-metre-contour lines on the 1:25,000 series topographic map. Its isolation is 300 metres, the Gimpel being the reference summit. == Alpinism == There are several climbing tours of the Rote Fl\u00fch ranging from alpine routes on the (short) north face to sports climbing at grade nine on the south face.Walter H\u00f6lzer: My nine routes on the Roten Fl\u00fch South Face . Retrieved on 1 September 2010. The normal route is classed as relatively straightforward and therefore very frequently used. From the Gimpelhaus or the Tannheimer Hut the path runs through a cirque on the eastern side of the summit block, which is partially secured by cables. In good weather queues often form at this bottleneck.Dieter Seibert: Alpine Club Guide alpin \u2013 Allg\u00e4uer Alpen und Ammergauer Alpen. 17th edn., Bergverlag Rother, Munich, 2008 (pp. 240f). Due to its location in the \"front row\" of the Alps,the Rote Fl\u00fch has outstanding views both of the flat Alpine Foreland as well as the lake of Haldensee, just under 1,000 metres below in the valley of Tannheimer Tal. The east ar\u00eate, a ridge called the Hochwiesler, on whose south face there are also several climbing routes. From it there is a 30-metre abseiling point to the north and a 100-metre abseiling piste to the south, whose first half has a 45-metre free hanging drop. In sunny weather the mountain can be climbed to within about 2-3 rope lengths of the summit on the often snow-free south face. After an anchor broke causing a roped team to fall with the loss of three lives, all frequently used south face routes were equipped with climbing bolts. The easiest one is the normal south face route (IV). Two abseil pistes (100 metres) run back to the foot of the south face. == Literature == * Toni Freudig: Klettern auf der Tannheimer Sonnenseite. 1999, * Achim Pasold: Kletterf\u00fchrer alpin \u2013 Allg\u00e4u incl.
