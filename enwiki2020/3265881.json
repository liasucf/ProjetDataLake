    "text": "Flag of Acadia The flag of Acadia flying in Moncton, New Brunswick The flag of Acadia was adopted on August 15, 1884, at the Second Acadian National Convention held in Miscouche, Prince Edward Island, by nearly 5,000 Acadian delegates from across the Maritimes. It was designed by Father Marcel-Francois Richard, a priest from Saint-Louis-de-Kent, New Brunswick. The Mus\u00e9e Acadien at the Universit\u00e9 de Moncton has the original flag presented by Father Richard to the 1884 Convention. It was sewn by Marie Babineau. According to Perry Biddiscombe: > The Tricolour represents the Motherland of the Acadians. The yellow star, > the Stella Maris, is the symbol of Mary, Acadian national symbol and patron > of the mariners. It is set on the blue stripe, because blue is the colour of > Mary. The yellow colour of the star represents the Papacy. Father Richard selected the French flag as the basis of the Acadian one to underline the adherence of the Acadians to the French civilization: > I wish that Acadia had a flag reminding not only that its children are > French, but also that they are Acadians Father Richard saw the star in the blue band as \"the distinctive emblem of our Acadian nationality\", representing the star of the Blessed Virgin of the Assumption, patron of the Acadians. The star also represented the starfish that guides the sailor \"through storms and reefs\".The Cajuns website The gold colour of the star was chosen by Father Richard because it is the colour of the Pope, in order to show both the adherence of the Acadians to the Roman Catholic Church and the role of the Church in the history of Acadia. The flag's creation was an important part of the Acadian Renaissance, and its final design reflects the political and religious considerations of that period.Biddiscombe, Perry. \u201cLe tricolour et l\u2019\u00e9toile: The Origin of the Acadian National Flag, 1867-1912,\u201d Acadiensis 20, no. 1 (1990).
