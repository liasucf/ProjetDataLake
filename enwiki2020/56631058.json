    "text": "Dysgedydd y plant (Welsh Journal) Dysgedydd y Plant was a Welsh language periodical produced for use by Congregationalist Church Sunday schools. It was first published in Dolgellau by W Hughes in 1871. The articles it contained covered religious and general educational subjects, including biographies. Its editors included David Griffith (1823\u20131913) and Richard Roberts (1871\u20131935). At a time when state schools punished children for speaking Welsh, children's publications such as this were important in preserving the skills of reading and writing in the Welsh language. == References == Category:Periodicals published in Wales Category:Welsh-language magazines Category:Music magazines published in the United Kingdom ",
