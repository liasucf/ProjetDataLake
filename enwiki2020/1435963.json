    "text": "Robert Oscar Blood (November 10, 1887 \u2013 August 3, 1975) was an American physician and Republican politician from Concord, New Hampshire. He served in both houses of the New Hampshire legislature and two terms as governor. Blood was born in Enfield, New Hampshire, and studied at Dartmouth College and then Dartmouth Medical School, graduating in 1913 and establishing a long-standing practice in Concord from 1915 (lasting until just a few years before his death). He served in the U.S. Medical Corps 1917-1919, leaving the service a lieutenant-colonel with decorations from both Britain and France. Blood began his political career in 1935, serving in the state's House (1935\u201336) and Senate (1937\u201340, president 1939-40). He won a close contest in the Republican direct primary for governor and won the election by just 800 votes. He was re- elected in 1942, but lost in 1944. His time in office was dominated by the war, but he championed his long-standing interest in veterans' affairs and was active in improving the financial condition of the state government. He lost the Congressional primary in 1946. From 1944 to 1960, Blood was the New Hampshire delegate to Republican National Convention. He married Pauline Shepard in 1916 and they had three children: Robert Oscar Blood, II, Horace Shepard Blood, and Emily Blood. Blood died at Concord in 1975 and is buried at the Blossom Hill Cemetery there. His collection of fine porcelain was donated to the state after his death and was placed in Bridges House - the Governor's mansion. == External links == * Blood at New Hampshire's Division of Historic Resources Category:1887 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Governors of New Hampshire Category:Geisel School of Medicine alumni Category:American Congregationalists Category:New Hampshire Republicans Category:New Hampshire state senators Category:Presidents of the New Hampshire Senate Category:Members of the New Hampshire House of Representatives Category:Republican Party state governors of the United States Category:20th- century American politicians Category:People from Enfield, New Hampshire ",
