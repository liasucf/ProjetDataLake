The two species have historically been included in the genus Myotis (family Vespertilionidae), but molecular studies show that the genus is distinct from all other Vespertilionidae, and in fact distinctive enough to be placed in its own family, Cistugidae.Lack et al., 2010 The two species are:Simmons, 2005, p. 499 *Cistugo lesueuri Roberts, 1919 \u2013 Lesotho and southern South Africa *Cistugo seabrai Thomas, 1912 \u2013 southwestern Angola through Namibia and northwestern South Africa ==References== ==Literature cited== *Lack, J.B., Roehrs, Z.P., Stanley, C.E., Ruedi, M. and Van Den Bussche, R.A. 2010.
