Jean-Baptiste Le Roy (15 August 1720, Paris \u2013 20 January 1800, Paris) was an 18th-century French physicist and one of the major contributors to the Encyclop\u00e9die by Diderot and d\u2019Alembert for technology. The son of 18th-century Parisian clockmaker and watchmaker Julien Le Roy, he had three brothers: Pierre (1717\u20131785), a brilliant clock-maker in his own right, Julien-David (1724\u20131803), a neo-classical architect and archaeologist, and Charles a physician and Encyclop\u00e9diste. In the field of science, Jean-Baptiste Le Roy worked on a variety of topics; of particular importance were his research on electricity. Together with Patrick d'Arcy, he constructed in 1749 the first electrometer, a device for detection of electrical charges and voltages. He also experimented with lightning conductors and with the use of electricity in the treatment of diseases. As contributor to the Encyclop\u00e9die, he wrote more than 130 articles under the author abbreviation \"T\", including those related to watchmaking, locksmith and mathematical instruments. From 1772 to 1777 Le Roy was deputy director and from 1773 to 1778, director of the Acad\u00e9mie royale des sciences. == Bibliography == ; Sources * Zu Le Roys T\u00e4tigkeit an der Acad\u00e9mie des sciences: Archives de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie des sciences de l\u2019institut de France, dossier personnel de Jean-Baptiste Le Roy. * Some letters by Le Roy were published in: Leonard W.
