    "text": "The Lady's from Kentucky is a 1939 film directed by Alexander Hall and starring George Raft and Ellen Drew. It was written by Malcolm Stuart Boylan from a story by Rowland Brown. The screenplay involves a failing bookie (Raft) who becomes half owner of a racehorse, with a Kentucky lady (Drew) owning the other half. ZaSu Pitts plays a supporting role. ==Plot== A gambler, Marty Black, wins a fifty percent interest in a thoroughbred owned by Penelope \"Penny\" Hollis, a prim and proper Kentucky horsewoman. Marty can't wait to wager on his new possession, Roman Son, but the health of the horse is foremost to Penny, who would rather nurture it than race it. After he enters Roman Son in a race without her knowledge, Marty sees the horse's condition deteriorate. Penny permits him to run Roman Son in the Kentucky Derby and a romance develops after the horse's victory, particularly when Marty agrees to retire Roman Son rather than race any more. ==Cast== *George Raft as Marty Black *Ellen Drew as Penny Hollis *Hugh Herbert as Mousey Johnson *ZaSu Pitts as Dulcey Lee *Louise Beavers as Aunt Tina *Lew Payton as Sixty *Forrester Harvey as Nonny Watkins *Edward Pawley as Spike Cronin *Gilbert Emery as Pinckney Rodell *Jimmy Bristow as Brewster *Stanley Andrews as Doctor *George Anderson as Joe Lane ==Production== The film was originally known as Racing Form.\"SCREEN NEWS HERE AND IN HOLLYWOODD: Selznick Picks Billie Burke for Role of Mrs. Carleton in 'The Young in Heart' ALMA LLOYD GETS PART ' Invisible Enemy,' With Alan Marshall, Tala Birell, Opens Today at Criterion Of Local Origin\" New York Times 29 Apr 1938: 17.
