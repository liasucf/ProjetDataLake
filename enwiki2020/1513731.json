    "text": "The Awareness League (AL) was a Nigerian anarchist organisation active since 1991 to 1999. The Awareness League has gone through several periods of repression, making its own organizational efforts and continuity sporadic, as well as communications with the rest of the anarchist movement. AL was known to be anarcho-syndicalist in orientation, having joined the IWA-AIT at its Madrid congress in December, 1996. The membership of the AL was primarily students, professors, university teachers, journalists, and other activists on the Nigerian left. Its militants have been active in several public service strikes. Sam Mbah, author of African Anarchism: History of a Movement, was an active member in AL. ==See also== * African Anarchism == References == ==External links== * Interview with general Secretary of Awareness League Category:Anarchism in Nigeria Category:Anarchist organizations in Africa Category:International Workers' Association Category:Political organizations based in Nigeria Category:Anarchist organizations ",
