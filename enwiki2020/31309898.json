    "text": "The 2011 AFL season was the 15th season contested by the Port Adelaide Football Club, and was Matthew Primus's first full year as senior coach of the club. Domenic Cassisi was confirmed to retain the captaincy for the 2011 season as part of a seven-man leadership group. Port Adelaide recorded its worst ever season in the AFL, with only three wins in the year, against in Round 4, in Round 10, and in Round 24. They also became the first team to lose to expansion club after Port's Justin Westhoff missed a kick after the siren that would have won the game for Port Adelaide. Port narrowly avoided last place on the ladder and the wooden spoon with their final round win over Melbourne, which lifted them above on the ladder. ==2011 squad== ==2011 results== ===Pre-season=== ====NAB Cup==== =====Group stages===== ====NAB Challenge==== =====First round===== =====Second round===== =====Third round===== ===Home and Away season=== ====Round 1==== ====Round 2==== ====Round 3==== ====Round 4==== ====Round 5==== ====Round 6==== ====Round 7==== ====Round 8==== ====Round 9==== ====Round 10==== ====Round 11==== ====Round 12==== ====Round 13==== ====Round 14==== ====Round 15==== ====Round 16==== ====Round 17==== ====Round 18==== ====Round 19==== ====Round 20==== ====Round 21==== ====Round 22==== ====Round 23==== ====Round 24==== ==Ladder== ==Leading Goalkickers== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:95%; border-collapse:collapse; width:100%;\" |- style=\"background:#C1D8FF;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" | Rank !! rowspan=\"2\" | Player !! rowspan=\"2\" | Goals !! rowspan=\"2\" | Behinds !! colspan=\"2\" | Best Performance |- !
