    "text": "Diacylglycerol kinase beta is a protein that in humans is encoded by the DGKB gene. ==Function== Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) are regulators of the intracellular concentration of the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) and thus play a key role in cellular processes. Nine mammalian isotypes have been identified, which are encoded by separate genes. Mammalian DGK isozymes contain a conserved catalytic (kinase) domain and a cysteine-rich domain (CRD). The protein encoded by this gene is a diacylglycerol kinase, beta isotype. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
