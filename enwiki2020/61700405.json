    "text": "'Jeannette and Jeannot' is a popular piece of music written in 1847Morning Post, November 6, 1847 by British theatre orchestra violinist and composer, Charles William Glover (1806-1863). It inspired other works on the theme of military conscription, and the tune was still being played by musicians around the world more than a century and a half later. The original lyrics depict two young French lovers about to separate because of war. Jeannette expresses concern that Jeannot may forget her: Glover incorporated the title song into \u2018The Jeannette and Jeannot Quadrille\u2019, a dance music routine. The sheet music was illustrated by the well-known lithographic artist John Brandard (1812-1863). Combined with Glover\u2019s music and lyrics, Brandard\u2019s lithographs were then used to help put \u2018Jeannette and Jeannot\u2019 into British theatres. The prolific playwright Edward Stirling (1807-1894) produced \u2018Jeannette and Jeannot\u2019, also known as \u2018The village pride\u2019. Promoted as a \u2018musical drama in two acts\u2019, it was first performed at London\u2019s Olympic Theatre in October 1848.Stirling, Edward, Jeannette and Jeannot or, The village pride: a musical drama, in two acts; C. Jefferys, London (1848)\u201cIf it had been produced earlier in the season, before the public had been almost cloyed with Glover's very pretty ballads, we should have anticipated a long run,\u201d wrote The Theatrical Times. \u201cThe plot of course, is told in the title, and Miss Rebecca Isaacs, as Jeannette, looked very much like Brandard's clever lithographs on the music.\u201dThe Theatrical Times, November 11, 1848 A drawing by John Brandard depicting Jeannette and Jeannot farewelling each other. In Stirling\u2019s play, Jeannot was leaving to fight in the French revolutionary wars as an army conscript. A new French system of conscription introduced in 1798, making men aged 20 to 25 liable for five years of army service, is seen as the beginning of modern European conscription.Linch, Kevin: Conscription, in: European History Online (EGO), published by the Leibniz Institute of European History (IEG), Mainz 2012-01-30. URL: http://www.ieg-ego.eu/linchk-2012-en In 1852, the London actor and singer William Hawthorne Eburne produced a second musical called \u2018Jeannette and Jeannot or The Conscript\u2019s Vow\u2019. By the 1860s, the names \u2018Jeannette\u2019 and \u2018Jeannot\u2019 were being used by some publications to symbolically represent all young French lovers separated by the country\u2019s conscription system.https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/01/archives/the-conscription-in- france.html The original lyrics of Glover\u2019s \u2018Jeannette and Jeannot\u2019 have often been parodied. This is an extract from one example (sung to the same tune) from 1849:Monmouthshire Merlin, March 3, 1849, p. 4 The tune of \u2018Jeannette and Jeannot\u2019 is still played in the 21st Century by guitarists, violinists, pianists and other musicians. Glover\u2019s numerous other productions included sentimental ballads like the well-known \u2018Rose of Tralee\u2019, and semi-comedic compositions.Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Vol. 22, p. 1 == References == == External links == * Full lyrics *Sheet music *International Music Score Library Project Category:1847 songs Category:Conscription Category:Political songs ",
