    "text": "Unplugged is a 1992 album by Eric Clapton, recorded at Bray Studios, England in front of an audience for the MTV Unplugged television series.Clapton's guitar smashes record BBC News Retrieved 28 January 2011 It includes a version of the successful 1991 single \"Tears in Heaven\" and an acoustic version of \"Layla\". It won six Grammy awards at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in 1993 and became the bestselling live album of all time, and Clapton's bestselling album, selling 26 million copies worldwide. ==Recording== Clapton performed the show in front of a small audience on 16 January 1992 at Bray Film Studios in Windsor, England. In addition to the final album tracks, the performance included early versions of \"My Father's Eyes\" and \"Circus Left Town\" along with \"Worried Life Blues\" and a version of \"Rollin' and Tumblin'\". Shortly after telling the studio audience \"that's it,\" Clapton said they needed to do \"two \u2013 no, three - no, five\" songs over again, adding \"if you don't mind, I don't mind.\" After the second take of \"My Father's Eyes\" there was a brief break and cameras were off. Clapton broke into an impromptu \"Rollin' and Tumblin'\", which he had last performed with Cream. The seasoned musicians quickly picked up on it and the crowd clapped along. The director signaled the crew to record, which is why there is such an abrupt start to the song mid- verse. Clapton was so pleased with it that when the song ended, he asked the director, \"did you get that?\" Clapton played Martin 000-42 acoustic guitars for much of the performance, and in 2004, one of the guitars sold for $791,500 (\u00a3434,400) in auction.Fretbase: Eric Clapton Unplugged \u2013 His Guitars and Gear ==Critical reception== The album was released on 25 August 1992 to some of the best reviews of his career. The album renewed the public's interest in Clapton, and boosted his popularity. Critical reception has been mixed though muted; in general, reviewers report that the album, if unremarkable, is \"relaxed\" and \"pleasant\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine for AllMusic feels that people have misrepresented and mythologised the album; that though it came after Paul McCartney's MTV Unplugged album, Unplugged (The Official Bootleg) (1991), people often mistake it for \"the first-ever MTV album\", that they often feel that \"it alone was responsible for revitalizing Clapton's career\", and that \"Tears in Heaven\" was first recorded here. Erlewine feels that the songs are \"lively and relaxed\", that Clapton turns \"Layla\" from an \"anguished howl of pain into a cozy shuffle and the whole album proceeds at a similar amiable gait\" while \"Clapton is embracing his middle age\". Robert Christgau was sharper in his comments, feeling that in an effort to be inoffensive \"Clapton-the-electric-guitarist\" has been relegated \"to the mists of memory\", and that \"Layla\" was turned into a \"whispery greeting card\". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune calls the release a \"blues album for yuppies\" and rates it with 2.5 of 4 stars, saying it is between fair and good. Entertainment Weekly journalist Steve Simels scores the album an A- calling the album \"a charmer, a collection of blues standards and recent Clapton songs rendered with just the right combination of intensity (a deeply felt version of \"Tears in Heaven\") and giddy fun (Clapton actually plays kazoo on \"San Francisco Bay Blues\")\". Steve Hochman in the Los Angeles Times felt that \"Tears in Heaven\" was \"maudlin but moving\", \"Layla\" was \"low-key but seductive\", but the blues numbers performed in an intimate setting makes the album \"Clapton's most passionate collection in years\". Commenting on the popularity of the album in his 2007 autobiography, Clapton wishes the reader to understand the great emotional toll he experienced around that time, and suggests that they visit the grave of his son Conor in Ripley to do so. It was voted number 788 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums (2000). ==Accolades== Clapton was nominated for nine Grammy Awards at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in 1993 and won six, including Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Performance - Male, Best Rock Vocal Performance \u2013 Male, and Best Rock Song. Although \"Tears in Heaven\" also earned three Grammy Awards, it was the version from Rush that the judges awarded.Billboard 6 Mar 1993 Billboard Retrieved 28 January 2011 {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year!!Organisation!!Award!!Work!!Result!!Ref. |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1992||align=\"center\"|Guitar World||Best guitar-albums of 1992||align=\"center\" rowspan=\"4\"|Unplugged||bgcolor=\"#efefef\" align=\"center\"|#9||align=\"center\"| |- |align=\"center\"|Musikexpress||Best albums of 1992||bgcolor=\"#efefef\" align=\"center\"|#8||align=\"center\"| |- |rowspan=\"4\"|1993||align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|NARAS||Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance||bgcolor=\"#B9FFC5\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|Won||align=\"center\"| |- |Grammy Award for Album of the Year||align=\"center\"| |- |Grammy Award for Best Rock Song||align=\"center\"|Layla||align=\"center\"| |- |align=\"center\"|NCTA||CableACE Award||align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|Unplugged||bgcolor=\"#FFCBCB\" align=\"center\"|Nominated||align=\"center\"| |- |2000||align=\"center\"|Q||Best British albums||bgcolor=\"#efefef\" align=\"center\"|#71||align=\"center\"| |- |2005||align=\"center\"|Musikexpress||Best albums of the 1990s||bgcolor=\"#efefef\" align=\"center\"|#32||align=\"center\"| |} ==Personnel== * Eric Clapton \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar, dobro, kazoo * Andy Fairweather Low \u2013 acoustic guitar, mandolin, harmonica * Chuck Leavell \u2013 acoustic piano, harmonium * Nathan East \u2013 acoustic bass, backing vocals * Steve Ferrone \u2013 drums, percussion * Ray Cooper \u2013 percussion * Katie Kissoon \u2013 backing vocals * Tessa Niles \u2013 backing vocals ===Production=== ;Studio Credits * Russ Titelman \u2013 producer * James \"Jimbo\" Barton \u2013 recording engineer * Steve Boyer \u2013 mixing at The Power Station (New York, NY). * Victor Deygilo \u2013 mix assistant * Ted Jensen \u2013 mastering at Sterling Sound (New York, NY). * Bill Smith Studio \u2013 sleeve design ;Live Credits * Milton Lage \u2013 film director * Alex Coletti \u2013 producer for MTV. * Joel Gallen \u2013 executive producer for MTV. * Mick Double \u2013 production manager, stage manager * Tom Kenny \u2013 lighting operator * Wil Roberts \u2013 head electrician engineer * Buford Jones \u2013 sound engineer * John Roden \u2013 monitor engineer * Doug Hall \u2013 sound technician * Les Dickson \u2013 guitar technician for Eric Clapton. * Tom Calcaterra \u2013 guitar technician * Alan Roger \u2013 guitar technician * Tim Myer \u2013 keyboard technician * John Collins \u2013 drum technician ==Commercial performance== In Germany the album peaked at #3 in the German Albums Chart and sold a total of 1.25 million copies, becoming one of the best-selling albums in Germany.

The album includes the original 14 tracks, remastered, as well as a bonus disc with six additional tracks, including two versions of \"My Father's Eyes\". The DVD includes a restored version of the concert, as well as over 60 minutes of unseen footage from the rehearsal. ==Track listing== Notes: *signifies arranged by ==Single releases== The acoustic rework of \"Layla\" was released as the single \"Layla (Acoustic)\", sometimes titled as \"Layla (Unplugged)\" in September 1992. The release reached top positions in both 1992 and 1993, reaching No .1 in the RPM Canadian Top Singles chart as well as peaking at No. 4 in the Canadian Adult Contemporary Tracks the same year. It also became popular in the US reaching No. 4 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart, peaking at No. 9 in the Mainstream Rock chart and reaching place 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also reached the top ten five of other countries. Clapton's acoustic version of \"Nobody Knows You When You\u2019re Down and Out\" was released as a single in Argentina only on 27 September 1992. Journalist Morten Holgersson from Norway liked the cover version noting that Clapton recorded the song more sinfully and in a more modern style than any other artist before. This, recalls Holgersson, is due to the changing of Clapton's finger picking and guitar playing with a pick. He therefore ended his review saying this was \"tactful and percussive\". American music critic Will Branson also liked Ray Cooper's and Chuck Leavell's work on their instruments. \"Running on Faith\" was not released as a single, but reached No. 15 on the Billboard Mainstream rock chart in 1993 as well as No. 28 on the Adult Contemporary chart which are based on radio airplay. \"Tears in Heaven\" was not released as a single from Unplugged but from the soundtrack for the film Rush. ==Chart positions== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Chart (1992\u20132015) !Peak position |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Australian Music DVD (ARIA) |12 |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian Albums (RPM) |1 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian Albums (The Record) |1 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Danish Albums (Hitlisten) |1 |- !scope=\"row\"|Danish Music DVD (Hitlisten) |1 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Finnish Albums (IFPI) |2 |- !scope=\"row\"|German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) |3 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Hungarian Music DVD (MAHASZ) |9 |- !scope=\"row\"|Japanese Albums (Oricon) |1 |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Portuguese Albums (AFP) |2 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Spanish Albums (AFYVE) |align=\"center\"|2 |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|US Top Video Sales (Billboard) |2 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !style=\"width:17em;\"|Chart (1992) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (ARIA) |45 |- !scope=\"row\"|Austrian Albums (\u00d63 Austria) |25 |- !scope=\"row\"|Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade) |25 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200 |36 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !style=\"width:17em;\"|Chart (1993) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (ARIA) |2 |- !scope=\"row\"|Austrian Albums (\u00d63 Austria) |7 |- !scope=\"row\"|Dutch Albums (MegaCharts) |2 |- !scope=\"row\"|Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade) |7 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200 |3 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !style=\"width:17em;\"|Chart (1994) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Dutch Albums (MegaCharts) |47 |} ===Decade-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! style=\"width:17em;\" | Chart (1990s) ! style=\"width:5em;\" | Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Austrian Albums (\u00d63 Austria) |20 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200 |30 |} ==Certifications== ===Album=== ===VHS and DVD=== == See also == *List of best-selling albums *List of best-selling albums in Argentina *List of best-selling albums in Brazil *List of best-selling albums in Germany *List of best-selling albums in Ireland *List of best-selling albums in the United States ==References== Category:Eric Clapton live albums Category:Grammy Award for Album of the Year Unplugged (Clapton, Eric album) Category:Albums produced by Russ Titelman Category:1992 live albums Category:Reprise Records live albums Category:Warner Records video albums Category:Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance ",
