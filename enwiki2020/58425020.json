He describes his music style as \"High-Tech Minimal.\"https://djmag.com/longreads/alternative- top-100-djs-2019-powered-beatport He uses the \"joker mask\" as his signature look, being inspired by the Carnival in Rio, at the times when he was performing for the first time, in Brazil. Since then, he has been performing at clubs around the world and at some of the biggest festivals such as Tomorrowland, Timewarp and Exit festival. Boris and his friends Ann Clue and Deniz Bul founded the label \"Fckng Serious\" in 2015. In August, 2019, he performed for the first time in Ibiza at H\u00ef Ibiza club. At age 6, he was a victim of the Ramstein air show disaster. This left him badly burnt and affected his outlook on life as a whole. He states in an interview; \"this was a special incidence in my life. I was alone, I was a little boy and I was in an extreme situation\". On the 24 January 2020, Brejcha released his 6th album Space Diver.
