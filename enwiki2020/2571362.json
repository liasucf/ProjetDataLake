    "text": "Airlines is an MS-DOS based construction and management simulation game created by 'Interactivision', which would later be renamed as 'InterActive Vision'. The main object of the game was to successfully set up an airline by buying aircraft, planning routes, setting ticket prices and dealing with events such as hostage and oil crises. The game had 4 airlines, a minimum of one of which was human controlled, with the rest being computer-controlled. The game begins with the year set as 1970 and as time progresses more aircraft models become available, corresponding with their first flights in reality. The aircraft in the game used real aircraft names, illustrations and model specifications, unlike most other airline simulation games. left ==Sequel== In October 2002, Interactivison released Airlines 2, despite the fact that the original Airlines game was largely unknown. Airlines 2 appeared to have slightly better market success. Features of Airlines 2 include 110 aircraft types with animation; 250 airports with 15 possible regions to start with; and more than 300 routes being available at the same time == Similar games == * Aerobiz * Airline Tycoon * Airport Tycoon == References == Category:1994 video games Category:Business simulation games Category:DOS games Category:DOS-only games Category:Video games developed in Denmark ",
