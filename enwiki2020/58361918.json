Glogojanu was one of the Romanian commanders during the Siege of Odessa. He became chief military administrator of Odessa on October 22, but was killed by an explosion at his headquarters, set up by Soviet agents, only a month after the fall of the city. His death, and the death of 60 others in that explosion, served as the catalyst for the Odessa massacre. == References == Category:1888 births Category:1941 deaths Category:People from R\u00e2mnicu S\u0103rat Category:Romanian Land Forces generals Category:Romanian military personnel of World War I Category:Romanian military personnel killed in World War II Category:Recipients of the Order of the Crown (Romania) Category:Recipients of the Order of Michael the Brave ",
