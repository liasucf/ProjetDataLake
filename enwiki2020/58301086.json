    "text": "2018 T10 League was the second season of the T10 League. The matches had a 10-over-a-side format with a time duration of 90 minutes. The tournament was played as a round robin followed by semifinals and the final. It was played from 21 November to 2 December 2018 at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium. Three new teams, Sindhis, Rajputs and Northern Warriors, joined the tournament with the exclusion of Team Sri Lanka from last season. Before the start of the tournament, Karachians changed their name to Sindhis after a Pakistan court order had objected to their title, citing a clash of identity with the Pakistan Super League team Karachi Kings. ==Squads== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"width:280px;\"| Kerala Knights ! style=\"width:280px;\"| Maratha Arabians ! style=\"width:280px;\"| Pakhtoons ! style=\"width:280px;\"| Northern Warriors |- | * Eoin Morgan (Icon Player, Captain) * Sohail Tanvir * Kieron Pollard * Paul Stirling * Dasun Shanaka * Chris Gayle * Junaid Khan * Sandeep Lamichhane * Tom Curran * Fabian Allen * Niroshan Dickwella * Imran Nazir * Benny Howell * Wayne Parnell * Reetinder Singh Sodhi * Mohammad Naveed * Abdul Shakoor * Upul Tharanga * Jonny Bairstow | * Rashid Khan (Icon Player) * Dwayne Bravo (Captain) * Kamran Akmal * Alex Hales * James Faulkner * Lasith Malinga * Liam Livingstone * James Vince * Brendan Taylor * Adam Lyth * Roelof van der Merwe * Najibullah Zadran * Richard Gleeson * Hazratullah Zazai * Zahoor Khan * Subramaniam Badrinath * Amir Hayat | * Shahid Afridi (Icon Player, Captain) * Mohammad Irfan * Liam Dawson * Colin Ingram * David Willey * Colin Munro * Andre Fletcher * Sohail Khan * Sharafuddin Ashraf * Chadwick Walton * Shapoor Zadran * Gulbadin Naib * Cameron Delport * R.
