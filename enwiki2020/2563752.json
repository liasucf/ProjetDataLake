Total Agrawal population in India is estimated to be around 10-15 million, which makes them around 1% of the Indian population. Agrawals are at the forefront of the larger trader community, which includes other mercantile communities like Maheshwari and Oswals. Members of the Agrawal community are known for their business skills and have for many years been influential and prosperous in India. In 2016, the most common surname of the directors of the companies listed in the National Stock Exchange of India was Agarwal (and its variations). The second most common surname was Gupta.https://qz.com/india/669503/whats-an-indian-boardroom-without-an- agarwal-or-a-gupta/ Even in modern-day tech and ecommerce companies, they continue to dominate. It was reported in 2013, that for every 100 in funding for e-commerce companies in India, 40 went to firms founded by an Agrawal. Of a total of 4 startups out of India that have crossed $10 Billion valuation (see List of unicorn startup companies), all except Paytm were founded by an Agrawal. Notably, many Agrawals use their Gotras (or surnames falling under their respective Gotras) as their surnames. ==Legend== The Agrawals claim descent from Kshatriya King Majaraja Agrasen of the mythological Solar Dynasty. Literally, Agrawal means the \"children of Agrasen\" or the \"people of Agroha\", a city in ancient Kuru Panchala, near Hisar in Haryana said to be founded by Agrasen. ==History== The Agrawal community traces it origins to Agreya Agroha, near Hisar, Haryana. The view is supported by historical evidence. *In Pradumna Charita of samvat 1411, the Agrawal poet Sadharu wrote \"\u0905\u0917\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0932 \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0940 \u091c\u093e\u0924, \u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0906\u0917\u0930\u094b\u090f \u092e\u0939\u093f \u0909\u0924\u092a\u093e\u0924\" (\"My j\u0101ti is Agarwal, and I trace my roots to the city of Agroha).Dr. Kasturachand Kasliwal, Khandelwal Jain Samaj ka Vrihad Itihas, 1969, p. 49 * In his Padma PuranaMuni Sabhachandra aur Unaka Padmapurana, Kasturchanda Kasliwal, 1984 of VS 1711, Muni Sabhachandra writes \"\u0905\u0917\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0939\u0947 \u0928\u093f\u0915\u091f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u0941 \u0920\u093e\u0922\u0947 \u091c\u094b\u0917, \u0915\u0930\u0948\u0902 \u0935\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0928\u093e \u0938\u092c \u0939\u0940 \u0932\u094b\u0917|| \u0905\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0932 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0915 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092c\u094b\u0927, \u0924\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092a\u0928 \u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092c\u0924\u093e\u0908 \u0938\u094b\u0927||\", (When Lohacharya was near Agroha, he taught the 53 actions to the Agrawal shravakas). *In a Sanskrit inscription, the Agrawals are referred to as Agrotaka (\"from Agroha\"): \"\u0938\u0902 \u0967\u0969\u0968\u096f \u091a\u0948\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0935\u0941\u0926\u0940 \u0926\u0936\u092e\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u092c\u0941\u0927\u0935\u093e\u0938\u0930\u0947 \u0905\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0939 \u092f\u094b\u0917\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0930\u0947 \u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e\u0935\u0932\u093f-\u0938\u092e\u0932\u0928\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0924 \u0917\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0926\u0940\u0928 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u092f\u0947 \u0905\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924 \u0905\u0917\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0924\u0915 \u092a\u0930\u092e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0915 \u091c\u093f\u0928\u091a\u0930\u0923\u0915\u092e\u0932\".Parmananda Jain Shastri.

In 1354, Firuz Shah Tughluq had started the construction of a new city near Agroha, called Hisar-e-Feroza (\"the fort of Firuz\"). Most of the raw material for building the town was brought from Agroha.The story of Hisar The town later came to be called Hisar. Hisar became a major center of the Agrawal community. Some Agrawals are also said to have moved to the Kotla Firoz Shah fort in Delhi, built by Firuz Shah Tughlaq. ===Migration to Rajput kingdoms=== Many marwari farmer migrated from Rajasthan. They form large fraction of the merchant population of Shekhawati region. Along with Maheshwari, Khandelwal and Oswals, they form the Marwari farmer community. In the early 15th century, Agrawals (sweet maker) flourished as a Halwai trader community, under the Tomaras of Gwalior.Kashtha Sangha Bhattarakas of Gwalior and Agrawal Shravakas, Dr. K. C. Jain According to several Sanskrit inscription at the Gwalior Fort in Gwalior District, several traders (Sanghavi Kamala Simha, Khela Brahmachari, Sandhadhip Namadas etc.) belonging to Agrotavansha (Agrawal clan) supported the sculptures and carving of idols at the place.

While they are generally present in business and politics, the community has produced a lot of successful scientists, inventors, authors, etc. ==Gotras== Historically, there has been no unanimity regarding number and names of gotras, and there are regional differences between the list of gotras. The Akhil Bhartiya Agrawal Sammelan, a major organization of Agrawals, has created with a standardized list of gotras, which was adopted as an official list by a vote at the organization's 1983 convention. Because the classification of any particular gotra as \"half\" is considered insulting, the Sammelan provides a list of following 18 gotras: The existence of all the gotras mentioned in the list is controversial, and the list does not include several existing clans such as Kotrivala, Pasari, Mudgal, Tibreval, and Singhla. == See also == * Agrawal Jain == References == Notes Citations == Further reading == * Category:Bania communities Category:Indian family names Category:Social groups of Rajasthan Category:Social groups of Haryana Category:Social groups of Delhi Category:Social groups of Uttar Pradesh Category:Social groups of Punjab, India Category:Social groups of Himachal Pradesh Category:Social groups of Uttarakhand Category:Hindu surnames Category:Jain surnames ",
