Harper was added to the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on November 29, 2008. After 15 years on the run, he was captured in Wyoming by the FBI on July 23, 2009. ==Background== ===Early life and family=== Edward Eugene Harper was born in New Mexico to Nell Trimue Harper, a Baptist from Forrest City, Arkansas. Edward Harper has at least three sisters, he has been married twice and has two children. ===Personal life=== Harper, who had little formal education has worked as a truck driver, mechanic and a ranch worker. He reportedly subscribed to Sovereign Citizen Movement ideology and claimed to be a member of the Montana Freemen, although authorities have never been able to confirm his affiliation with the group. Harper was diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder by a behavioral psychologist in Mississippi, shortly after his 1994 arrest. The disorder is characterized by a desire for social isolation, social anxiety and odd behavior. Harper is described as a survivalist, who has lived outside of modern society, but according to FBI Special Agent Ryan Arton he \"could distinguish right from wrong\". ==Child molestation accusations== From fall of 1993 to March 1994, Harper allegedly molested two girls in Hernando, Mississippi. In 1993, Harper, who was forty-eight years old, lived with his eighteen-year-old wife, Debra Busby,http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/oct/20/longtime-fugitive- found-guilty/ in a trailer park in DeSoto County, Mississippi.http://courts.ms.gov/Images/HDList/..%5COpinions%5CCO75694.pdf According to Arton, the FBI Special Agent, Harper and his then-19-year-old wife began to look after one of his alleged victims, a three-year-old girl, whose homeless mother could not take care for her. Alleged sexual abuse by Harper and his wife Debra began within a month. The second alleged victim was an eight-year-old girl who lived in the neighborhood. Arton said Harper threatened his wife and alleged victims with violence if they ever told anyone of the abuse. In March 1994, after the girls told their parents about the alleged sexual abuse, police obtained a search warrant. When Harper's trailer home was raided, he had already fled. After the raid, a highway officer in Utah performed a routine traffic stop and pulled over Harper and his wife. When the officer ran his name, the warrant came to his attention. Harper was arrested and extradited back to Mississippi.AMW.com - Edward Harper - Fugitive (HTML) America's Most Wanted.

Harper lived a nomadic lifestyle, living in a truck with a camper top, moving from place to place, and earning a living by doing odd jobs and herding sheep. He would make trips to buy groceries and tobacco to the general store in Kaycee, which was said to be the nearest town to his camp. Harper himself told the judge he had been living on and off for 15 years in the Broken Horn Creek area. ==Capture== The FBI received a telephone tip in June at the Denver office regarding Harper, and brought a SWAT team and a hostage negotiation team to apprehend him. He was captured in Washakie County, Wyoming in the southern portion of the Big Horn Mountains on July 23, 2009 by FBI and Wyoming Game and Fish Department officers after nearly 15 years on the run. Harper surrendered without an incident and admitted his identity. He had an unspecified number of handguns and rifles in his truck but was not carrying them when he was apprehended. Harper was transported to Casper, where he was being held at the Natrona County jail and extradited to Mississippi in September 2009. ==Trial and conviction== At trial, Harper testified that he never abused the girls, and that he fled because he did not feel he would get a fair trial. Harper was convicted by the DeSoto County Circuit Court of six counts of sexual battery, two counts of fondling, and two counts of conspiracy to commit sexual battery in October 2010. Harper was sentenced to a total of fifty years to serve in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. ==See also== *List of fugitives from justice who are no longer sought ==References== ==External links== *FBI press release announcing Harper's addition to the list *FBI press release announcing Harper's capture *Harper's FBI Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitive Alert *Harper's profile on America's Most Wanted Category:1946 births Category:American nomads Category:American prisoners and detainees Category:American ranchers Category:American truck drivers Category:Criminals from New Mexico Category:FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives Category:Formerly wanted fugitives Category:Living people Category:People extradited within the United States Category:People from Hernando, Mississippi Category:People from New Mexico Category:People with schizotypal personality disorder Category:Prisoners and detainees of Mississippi ",
