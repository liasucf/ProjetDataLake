He soon started writing these novels also under the name of Sant\u014d Ky\u014dden; several novels are labeled as written by Sant\u014d Ky\u014dden and illustrated by Kitao Masanobu. He wrote kiby\u014dshi and sharebon in great numbers, and became a popular writer. During this time he married twice, both his wives being licensed workers of Yoshiwara, the red-light district of Edo.

This incurred the anger of the stricter government and he was chained in manacles to his house for fifty days as punishment.Keene (1976: 408)Kubota (2007: 167) Ky\u014dden then broke off all ties with sharebon and turned to writing yomihon. Kyokutei Bakin joined with Ky\u014dden to write gesaku jointly, and independently Ky\u014dden also wrote essentially historical texts on the manners and customs of the Edo period. Ky\u014dden was an acute observer of life in the Edo period. While at ease with exaggeration, comedy and linguistic fun, his writing was primarily realistic. Fiction writers prior to Ky\u014dden generally wrote fiction as a hobby without any expectations of payment. Ky\u014dden was one of the pioneers in turning this hobby into a livable profession. == Major works == === Kiby\u014dshi === * (1782) * (1785) * (1788) * (1790) === Sharebon === * (1785) * (1787) * (1787) * (1790) * (1790) * (1791) * (1791) * (1791) === Yomihon === * (1799) * (1804) * (1805) * (1806, translated by Carmen Blacker as \"The Straw Sandal Or The Scroll of the Hundred Crabs\", Global Oriental, 2008, ) === Historical works === * (1804) * (1813) == See also == *Kiby\u014dshi *Sharebon *Tsutaya J\u016bzabur\u014d ==Notes== == References == * * * * * This article incorporates material from the equivalent article in the Japanese Wikipedia. == External links == * * \u4f50\u85e4 \u85cd\u5b50. \u4eac\u4f1d\u306e\u8aad\u672c\u6587\u4f53. \u6771\u4eac\u5927\u5b66\u56fd\u6587\u5b66\u8ad6\u96c6 (3), 115-127, 2008-05.
