Billboard noted: \"An accomplished pianist and guitarist, Rosana Arbelo's extraordinary voice gives Lunas Rotas an intimate quality. [\u2026] Gypsy flamenco-pop sisters Az\u00facar Moreno are among those who have recorded her songs, and like that of Az\u00facar Moreno, Arbelo's music has a distinct Caribbean and Latin influence\".
