In Irish folklore she is commonly known as Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol (anglicised as Granuaile) and is a well-known historical figure in 16th-century Irish history. Her name was also rendered in contemporary English documents in various ways, including Gr\u00e1inne O'Maly, Graney O'Mally, Granny ni Maille, Grany O'Mally, Grayn Ny Mayle, Grane ne Male, Grainy O'Maly, and Granee O'Maillie. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille is not mentioned in the Irish annals, so documentary evidence for her life comes mostly from English sources, especially the eighteen \"Articles of Interrogatory\", questions put to her in writing on behalf of Elizabeth I.See the supplement to Chambers, 2003. She is also mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind.Lambeth Palace Library, ms. no 601, p. 10, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 85 Upon her father's death she took over active leadership of the lordship by land and sea, despite having a brother, D\u00f3nal an Ph\u00edopa \u00d3 Mh\u00e1ille. Marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh (D\u00f3nal \"the warlike\") \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh brought her greater wealth and influence, reportedly owning as much as 1,000 head of cattle and horses. In 1593, when her sons Tiob\u00f3id a B\u00farc (Tibbot Bourke) and Murchadh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh (Murrough O'Flaherty), and her half-brother D\u00f3nal an Ph\u00edopa (\"D\u00f3nal of the Pipes\"), were taken captive by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille sailed to England to petition for their release. She formally presented her request to Queen Elizabeth I at her court in Greenwich Palace. ==Early life== N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was born in Ireland around 1530, when Henry VIII was King of England and held the title Lord of Ireland. Under the policies of the English government at the time, the semi-autonomous Irish princes and lords were left mostly to their own devices. However, this was to change over the course of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's life as the Tudor conquest of Ireland gathered pace. Eoghan Dubhdara \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, her father, and his family were based in Clew Bay, County Mayo. He was lord of the \u00d3 M\u00e1ille dynasty and ruler of Umall, descended from Maille mac Conall. The U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille were one of the seafaring families of Connacht, and they built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory. They controlled most of what is now the barony of Murrisk in south-west County Mayo and recognised as their nominal overlords the Mac William \u00cdochtar branch of the Bourkes, who controlled much of what is now County Mayo. The Bourkes (De Burca) were originally Anglo-Norman but by N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's lifetime completely Gaelicised. Her mother, Margaret or Maeve, was also a N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had a paternal half- brother called D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa. Although typically during this period sons would inherit, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille \"was considered to be the legal retainer of the family land and seafaring activities\".O'Connell With shore castles like Carrickkildavnet, the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille taxed all those who fished off their coasts, which included fishermen from as far away as England. The head of the family was known simply by his surname as \u00d3 M\u00e1ille (anglicised as The O'Malley). Local folklore had it that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille, as a young girl, wished to go on a trading expedition to Spain with her father. Upon being told she could not because her long hair would catch in the ship's ropes, she cut off most of her hair to embarrass her father into taking her. This earned her the nickname \"Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol\" (; from maol meaning bald or having cropped hair), usually anglicised as Granuaile ().as used to name the ships ILV Granuaile of the Commissioners of Irish Lights The nickname may also come from \"Gr\u00e1inne Umhaill\" (\"Gr\u00e1inne of Umhall\", Umhall being a historical district of west Connacht dominated by the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille). As a child she most likely lived at her family's residence of Belclare and Clare Island, but she may have been fostered to another family, for fosterage was traditional among Irish nobility at the time. She was probably formally educated, since she is believed to have spoken in Latin with Queen Elizabeth I in 1593. ==Marriage to \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh == Clare Island, associated with Gr\u00e1inne N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was married in 1546 to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh, t\u00e1naiste or heir to the \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh (O'Flaherty) title, which would have been a good political match for the daughter of the \u00d3 M\u00e1ille chieftain. As \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh t\u00e1naiste, D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh had expectations of one day ruling Iar Connacht, the area roughly equivalent to modern Connemara. She bore three children during her marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh: * Eoghan (Owen): The eldest child, known to be kind and forgiving. Sir Richard Bingham tricked him; Owen was murdered as a result, and Bingham and his troops took over his castle. * M\u00e9adhbh (Maeve): Said to be much like her mother, she married Ricard Deamhan an Chorr\u00e1in a B\u00farc, 'the Devil's Hook', with whom she had several children. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille and a B\u00farc were supposedly very close, more than once saving her from death. * Murchadh (Murrough): Murrough was said to take after his father, for he enjoyed warfare. He often beat his sister Maeve, and refused to listen to his mother because of her sex. Many sources report that he betrayed his family and joined forces with Sir Richard Bingham after the murder of Owen. When N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille heard of this she swore she would never speak to Murrough again for the rest of her life, though she would often insult him. After D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh's death, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille left Iar Connacht and returned to \u00d3 M\u00e1ille territory, taking with her many \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh followers. In 1565, D\u00f3nal was killed in an ambush while hunting in the hills surrounding Lough Corrib; this was, undoubtedly, part of D\u00f3nal's wider struggle with the Joyces for control of Hen's Castle on the lough. Gr\u00e1inne returned to her own lands and established her principal residence on Clare Island (now called Granuaile's Castle). She allegedly took a shipwrecked sailor as her lover. The affair only lasted briefly as he was killed by the MacMahons of Ballyvoy. Seeking vengeance, Gr\u00e1inne attacked the MacMahon castle of Doona in Blacksod Bay and killed her lover's murderers on Cahir Island. Her attack on Doona Castle earned her the nickname 'Dark Lady of Doona'. ==Marriage to Burke== Rockfleet Castle By 1566, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had married a second time, this time to Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn (\"Iron Richard\") Bourke, his nickname deriving from his ironworks at Burrishoole, the place of his principal castle and residence. The 1st Viscount Mayo was a child of this marriage. Still not satisfied with her revenge, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself. Her attack against the MacMahons was not the first time she interrupted someone at their prayers. Legend tells of another lord who stole property from her and fled to a church for sanctuary. She was determined to wait out the thief, maintaining that he could starve or surrender. The thief dug a tunnel and escaped, however, and the hermit who took care of the church broke his vow of silence to scold her for attempting to harm someone who had sought sanctuary. Her reply is not recorded. More than twenty years after her death, an English Lord Deputy of Ireland recalled her ability as a leader of fighting men, noting the fame she still had among the Irish people.Calendar of State Papers Relating to Ireland (James I) 1623, no. 997. (London 1860\u20131912) ==Autonomous status== In 1576, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille engaged in the surrender and regrant process with the Lord Deputy Sir Henry Sidney in respect of her lands. Because Rockfleet was over a week's march from Dublin, and as she was so often at sea, control by the Crown was very weak. In 1593, in his letter to protest N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's claims against him, Sir Richard Bingham claimed that she was \"nurse to all rebellions in the province for this forty years\".Lambeth Palace Library MS 601, p. 111 Bingham was Lord President of Connacht, tasked with controlling local lords who had, until then, been mostly autonomous. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had every reason, and used every opportunity, to limit the power of the Kingdom of Ireland over her part of the country. An expedition from Galway led by Sheriff William \u00d3ge Martyn attacked her castle at Clare Island in March 1579. However, they were put to flight and barely escaped. ==Meeting with Elizabeth== The meeting of Grace N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille and Queen Elizabeth I (a later illustration from Anthologia Hibernica, vol. 11, 1793) In the late 16th century, English power steadily grew in Ireland and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's power was steadily encroached upon. In 1593, when her two sons Tibbot Burke and Murrough O'Flaherty, and her half- brother D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa were captured by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille sailed to England to petition Queen Elizabeth I for their release. Elizabeth I famously sent N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille a list of questions, which were answered and returned to Elizabeth. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille then met with the Queen at Greenwich Palace, wearing a fine gown; the two of them were surrounded by guards and the members of Elizabeth's royal court. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille refused to bow before Elizabeth because she didn't recognise her as the \"Queen of Ireland\". It's also rumoured that she had a dagger concealed about her person, which guards found upon searching her. Elizabeth's courtiers were said to be very upset and worried, but N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed the Queen that she carried it for her own safety. Elizabeth accepted this and seemed untroubled. Some also reported that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had sneezed and was given a lace-edged handkerchief from a noblewoman. She apparently blew her nose into it and then threw the cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to the shock of the court. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed everyone that in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was properly destroyed. Their discussion was carried out in Latin, as N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille spoke no English and Queen Elizabeth I spoke no Irish. After much talk, the women came to an agreement that included that Elizabeth would remove Bingham from his position in Ireland, and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille would stop supporting the Irish lords' rebellions. Bingham was removed but several of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's other demands (including the return of the cattle and land that Bingham had stolen from her) remained unmet, and soon Elizabeth sent Bingham back into Ireland. Bingham continued to plague N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille and in 1594 troops were quartered on her lands. As the Nine Years' War escalated, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille sought to retrench her position with the crown. On 18 April 1595 she petitioned Lord Burghley, complaining of the activities of troops and asking to hold her estate for Elizabeth I.Calendar of State Papers Ireland, 1592-6, p. 321 She added that 'her sons, cousins, and followers will serve with a hundred men at their own charges at sea upon the coast of Ireland in Her Majesty's wars upon all occasions...to continue dutiful unto Her Majesty, as true and faithful subjects'.Petition of Grany Ny Maelly, of Connacht, to Burghley, 17 April 1595, Nat Archives Kew, PRO SP 63/179/f. 7 Throughout the war she encouraged and supported her son Tibbot Burke to fight for the Crown against Tyrone's confederation of Irish lords. She most likely died at Rockfleet Castle around 1603, the same year as Elizabeth's death, though the year and place of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's death are disputed. Her family's usual burial place was in Clare Island Abbey. ==Biographical sources== In her 2006 biography of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille, Irish historian and novelist Anne Chambers described her as: > a fearless leader, by land and by sea, a political pragmatist and > politician, a ruthless plunderer, a mercenary, a rebel, a shrewd and able > negotiator, the protective matriarch of her family and tribe, a genuine > inheritor of the Mother Goddess and Warrior Queen attributes of her remote > ancestors. Above all else, she emerges as a woman who broke the mould and > thereby played a unique role in history. Granuaile: Grace O'Malley: Grace > O'Malley - Ireland's Pirate Queen, by Anne Chambers; Foreword; Gill & > Macmillan Ltd, 2006; , 9780717151745 Documentary evidence for N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's life comes mostly from English sources, as she is not mentioned in the Irish annals. The \u00d3 M\u00e1ille family \"book\", a collection of eulogistic bardic poetry and other material of the sort kept by aristocratic Gaelic households of the period, has not survived. There are no contemporary images of her. An important source of information is the eighteen \"Articles of Interrogatory\", questions put to her in writing on behalf of Elizabeth I.See the supplement to Chambers, 2003. She is also mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind, an example being a letter sent by the Lord Deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, to his son Phillip in 1577: \"There came to mee a most famous femynyne sea captain called Grace Imallye, and offred her service unto me, wheresoever I woulde command her, with three gallyes and two hundred fightinge men ...\"Lambeth Palace Library, ms. no 601, p. 10, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 85 Local traditions concerning her were collected by Irish scholar John O'Donovan in the 1830s and 1840s on behalf of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. In a letter of 1838 he describes her as being \"most vividly remembered by tradition and people were living in the last generation who conversed with people who knew her personally\". > Charles Cormick of Erris, now 74 years and six weeks old, saw and conversed > with Elizabeth O'Donnell of Newtown within the Mullet, who died about 65 > years ago who had seen and intimately known a Mr Walsh who remembered > Gr\u00e1inne. Walsh died at the age of 107 and his father was the same age as > Gr\u00e1inne.Gaisford St Lawrence Papers, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 73 A story is recorded of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille chiding her son T\u00edobo\u00edd in the course of an attack on Kinturk Castle, when she thought he was shirking the battle: \"An ag iarraidh dul i bhfolach ar mo th\u00f3in at\u00e1 t\u00fa, an \u00e1it a dt\u00e1inig t\u00fa as?\" (\"Are you trying to hide in my arse, the place that you came out of?\").Ordnance Survey Letters, Mayo, vol. II, cited in Chambers 2003, spelling modernised. She is also recorded as saying, with regard to her followers, \"go mb'fhearr l\u00e9i l\u00e1n loinge de chlann Chonraoi agus de chlann Mhic an Fhail\u00ed n\u00e1 l\u00e1n loinge d'\u00f3r\" (that she would rather have a shipload of Conroys and MacAnallys than a shipload of gold). ==Westport House== Statue of Gr\u00e1inne N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille in Westport House Westport House in County Mayo, Ireland, was the seat of the Browne dynasty, Marquesses of Sligo, direct descendants of Gr\u00e1inne N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille. The current house was built close to the site of Cahernamart (Cathair na Mart - \"fort of the beef market\"), an \u00d3 M\u00e1ille fort. The original house was built by Colonel John Browne, a Jacobite, who was at the Siege of Limerick (1650\u201351), and his wife Maude Bourke. Maude Bourke was N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's great-great granddaughter. A statue of Gr\u00e1inne N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille by the artist Michael Cooper \u2013 the brother-in-law of the 11th Marquess of Sligo \u2013 is on display in Westport House, and a bronze casting of the statue is situated on the grounds near the house.'Westport House A Brief History' Westport House 2008 Westport House also contains a comprehensive exhibition on the life of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille compiled by author Anne Chambers, a leading authority on Granuaile. ==Cultural impact== N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's life has inspired many musicians, novelists, and playwrights to create works based on her life and adventures and she has been used as a personification of Ireland: > Her name has been frequently used by our Bards, to designate Ireland.
