    "text": "Scintillation is a fluctuation in the amplitude of a target on a radar display. It is closely related to target glint, or wander, an apparent displacement of the target from its mean position. This effect can be caused by a shift of the effective reflection point on the target, but has other causes as well. The fluctuations can be slow (scan-to-scan) or rapid (pulse- to-pulse). It appears especially at seaside level. Scintillation and glint are actually two manifestations of the same phenomenon and are most properly linked to one another in target modeling. ==References== * * Category:Radar ",
