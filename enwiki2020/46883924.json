    "text": "The building in 2007 Sparkhill Library is a library located in Sparkhill. The Library falls under the jurisdiction of Birmingham City Council. In 2014 it was saved from being sold on the open market after local councillors made a plea for it to be offered for community use first. Sparkhill Police Station, which includes the West Midlands Police Museum is next door. Also next door to the library is the Sparkhill Pool which houses a swimming pool alongside several other facilities. The large building currently houses a social/cultural centre in which events or daily lessons are held; however in more recent years a neighbourhood office that was once situated within the building has closed. The library opened to the public in 1987. == References == Category:Libraries in Birmingham, West Midlands Library Category:Clock towers in the United Kingdom Category:Individual clocks in England ",
