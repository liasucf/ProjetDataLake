    "text": "PvE, player vs environment (also known as player versus monster, or PvM in some communities), is a term used for both single player and online games, particularly MMORPGs, CORPGs, MUDs, other online role-playing video games and survival games to refer to fighting computer-controlled enemies--in contrast to PvP (player versus player). In survival games a large part may be fighting the elements, controlling hunger and thirst, learning to adapt to the environment and exploration. Usually a PvE mode can be played alone, with human companions or with AI companions. The PvE mode may contain a storyline that is narrated as the player progresses through missions. It may also contain missions that may be done in any order. ==Examples== Guild Wars narrates its story by displaying in-game cut scenes and dialogue with non- playable characters (NPCs). To enhance replayability, missions can often be completed many times. Characters playing in this mode are often protected against being killed by other players and/or having their possessions stolen. An example of a game where this is not the case is Eve Online, where players can be, and often are, ambushed by other human players player versus player while attempting to complete a quest. Some games, such as World of Warcraft, offer the player the choice of participating in open-world PvP combat or doing quests without PvP interruption through use of specialty servers and temporary player flags. ==See also== * Player versus player * Cooperative gameplay * Deathmatch * Single player video game ==References== Category:MUD terminology Category:Role-playing game terminology Category:Video game gameplay Category:Video game terminology ",
