Versatile is a Canadian brand of agricultural equipment that has produced augers, swathers, and combine harvesters. In the 1960s, it was an independent operation, founded by Peter Pakosh and Roy Robinson, which had 70% of the 4WD tractor market. Versatile was the first company to mass-produce articulated four-wheel-drive tractors, starting in 1966 with the D100 and G100 four-wheel drives. Those ground-breaking tractors were primitive by modern standards, with a 6-cylinder diesel or 8-cylinder gas engine producing 100 horsepower. 1966 models sold for less than CA$10,000. A Versatile 856 tractor in Carrollton, Ohio Daniel Pakosh also developed the first bi-directional tractor in the world. The Versatile 150 launched in 1977. The Versatile brand, known historically for four-wheel drive tractors, has expanded to include front-wheel assist tractors, self- propelled sprayers, precision seeding & tillage equipment, and combines. In its earlier days (1970s to 1980s), the company made iconic tractors colored red, yellow, and black. The tractors were also known for their flat, boxy appearance, and hardly any curvature as seen on modern tractors. A great example of this is the Versatile 856 (Pictured Below). Four-wheel drive demand increased significantly, with Versatile becoming one of the leaders in four- wheel-drive development and production. By the late 1970s, the Versatile lineup included tractors ranging from 220 to 330 horsepower. With the 1980s came an expanded line of four-wheel-drive tractors that stretched to 470 horsepower in the Versatile 1150. They entered the race to build the largest tractor in the world with \"Big Roy\", named after one of the founders, in 1977. Roy produced 600 HP on the draw bar. In 1987, Ford New Holland brought Versatile. Ford New Holland quickly started assimilating the Versatile range of tractors, the decals were replaced with the Ford name and Versatile name was reduced in size and placed below the model number. As well that, the iconic Versatile colors were replaced with the iconic blue and white of the Ford tractors. Throughout Versatile's time under Ford-New Holland, various changes and updates were made to the line. Two of the most notable changes were the transition from the flat square sheetmetal, to a more rounded and modernized design, and the addition of a powershift transmission. In 1991, Fiat Geotech purchases Ford New Holland to create New Holland. Then in 1999, New Holland merges with Case Corporation to create CNH Global, as part of this merger Versatile had to be sold, as the Case Corporation had the Steiger brand since 1986. Versatile was sold to Buhler Industries Incorporated, returning the iconic red to the tractors, but replacing yellow with white. On November 1, 2007, Combine manufacturer Rostselmash Inc. acquired 80% of the common shares of Versatile and it was announced that the Versatile brand name will again be the sole name associated with the tractor division. In 2016, Versatile expanded its tractor range by adding the DeltaTrack system of four tracks replacement of the wheels on their Articulated tractors. In 2017 Versatile returned to its iconic color scheme of red, yellow, and black. == Models == === 4 Wheel Drives (Articulated) === * D100-1966 * G100 -1966 * 118 1967-71 (118 HP) * 125 1967-68 (125 HP) * 145 1967-71 (145 HP) * 700 1972-77 (210 HP) * 900 1972-77 (300 HP) * 300- 1973 (155 HP) * 800 1973-77 (235 HP) * 850 1973-77 (250 HP) * 150 1977-81 (71 HP) * 500 1977-79 (192 HP) * 825- 1977 (250 HP) * 950 1977-82 (350 HP) * 1080- 1977 (600 HP) * 835 1978-84 (230 HP) * 855 1978-83 (250 HP) * 875 1978-84 (280 HP) * 555 1979-84 (210 HP) * 895 1980-84 (310 HP) * 1150 1981-85 (470 HP) * 160 1982-83 (84 HP) === 2 Wheel Drives === ==References== * Versatile Tractors (A Farmer Boy's Dream), by Jarrod Pakosh, published by Japonica Press, ==External links== * * Versatile Tractor Brand *http://www.tractordata.com/farm-tractors/tractor- brands/versatile/versatile-tractors.html Category:Tractor manufacturers of Canada Category:Manufacturing companies based in Winnipeg Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1966 Category:1966 establishments in Canada Category:Canadian brands ",
