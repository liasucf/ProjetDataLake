She favours classical and Celtic/folk songs, but also sings pop and jazz on occasion. ==Early life== Owen was born on 4 October 1993 in North Wales and lived in the Anglesey village of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch (or Llanfairpwllgwyngyll for short) before moving to Australia with her family in November 1995. At a young age, Owen was encouraged to join the Adelaide Girls Choir (now Young Adelaide Voices) and the St Aloysius College) school choir, where she became a regular soloist. Owen began her classical voice training at age nine, with singing teachers Naomi Hede and Norma Knight. She entered her first Eisteddfod around this time winning an Honourable Mention in the nine to thirteen age group. It wasn't long before Owen started winning Eisteddfods, most notably the Classical Voice sections. ==First performances== Owen's first solo performance on stage came just after her 10th birthday, in 2003, when she sang in a Riverdance Style show called \"Shades of Green\", organised by the Adelaide Irish Dancing Association, which toured South Australian theatres. When she was 12, Owen gave her first major solo performance, singing a traditional Irish song at the Adelaide Festival Theatre to an audience of 2,500. The same year, Owen received a Music Scholarship from St Aloysius College and a Choral Scholarship from St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral Choir, where she remained a soloist and chorister for over three years. In August 2007, aged 13, Owen gave her first solo concert for Recitals Australia. She continues to perform for Recitals Australia every year. ==Harp== In 2008, Owen received media attention when asked to sing at the Adelaide Fringe Festival with French singer/harpist C\u00e9cile Corbel after they met on Myspace.\"Online friends go onstage\" by Sam Kelton, The Advertiser (Adelaide), 13 February 2008 Owen was so inspired by Corbel's harp playing that she decided to start playing harp. She had harp lessons from renowned Adelaide singer/harpist Emma Horwood, and was soon accompanying herself with harp in Celtic and Folk Festivals, concerts and recitals.
