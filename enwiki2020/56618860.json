The series is licensed by Yen Press. An anime television series adaptation by Geek Toys aired from January 8 to June 24, 2020. ==Plot== Set in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by numbers, every human being has their worth measured by a special \"Count\" imprinted somewhere on their bodies, which defines any number related to an important aspect of their lives. However, if this Count decreases to 0, the person will be dragged down into \"the abyss\", and is said to be dead for all eternity. For young Hina, her Count corresponds to how many hundreds of kilometers she has walked. Ever since her mother was dragged into the abyss, she has been searching for the Legendary Ace from her mother's last wish for the last five years. Hina's grueling journey takes a sudden turn when she meets a strange masked knight known as Licht Bach with a negative-numbered Count. ==Characters== ; : :First appearing as a strange pervert wearing a mask, Licht is later revealed to be a Legendary Fabled Ace (powerful heroes that lived over 300 years ago where they put an end to the ongoing waste war) while seemingly carrying two counts (a ballot), it is hinted that he may have another.
