Jerry Saslav, Massachusetts National Guard Public Affairs , Mass Guard receives diversity award, March 16, 2011 ===Suspension and retirement=== On March 29, 2012 he was suspended with pay from the National Guard by Governor Patrick pending the outcome of an investigation into an allegation that he raped a servicewoman in his unit in 1984 during training at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The accusations resurfaced in 2010 during court martial proceedings against Lt. Col. Mark Murray who serves as the Massachusetts National Guard's quartermaster. Carter initiated court martial proceedings against Murray \"after state and federal investigations uncovered a range of alleged improprieties, including misusing federal money, hiring a convicted felon to do legal work, and threatening a whistleblower\" and after Murray refused to resign in lieu of court martial. During the court martial, Murray alleged that the charges against him were retaliation by Carter for his role as investigating officer when the charges were first raised two years after the alleged attack. The court martial found that Murray had \"failed to comply with federal law in managing Guard funds\", but they voted 3 to 2 to allow Murray to retain his job. After the verdict, Murray was stripped of most of his responsibilities. It was alleged that Carter also retaliated against two of the judges in that court martial by trying to have them forced out because he was not happy with the verdict. Further investigation into the rape accusations was in part the result of a background check required for Carter's federal promotion to Major General. The promotion \"must be approved by the Army and confirmed by the US Senate\". During the investigation, Carter alleged that the rape charges against him are part of a long running smear campaign against him. He states that the accusations are the result of his efforts to change a law that made firing certain state military division employees impossible without a court martial. He also claims senior officials were also angry with him for changing the National Guard's work week from a ten-hour-a-day four-day-a-week work schedule to an eight-hour-a-day five-day-a-week work schedule. Carter claimed he did not remember the soldier who made the accusations and had \"categorically denied the allegation\". Carter also claimed to have not known of the allegations until they were raised during the 2010 court martial. This is in contrast to a statement by Murray who claims Carter was questioned during the investigation about the incident and stated \"Well I hope this doesn't impact me some time in my future.\" Part of Carter's denial was also contradicted by his former company commander who stated he recalled the night in question and remembered Carter helping the woman after a night of socializing. He stated that Carter and the victim got out of a car near the beach, and that Carter later returned alone. On April 3, 2012, Governor Patrick selected Massachusetts Air National Guard Major General L. Scott Rice to serve as acting Adjutant General during Carter's suspension. On September 19, 2012 BG Carter agreed to retire from the Massachusetts National Guard after a report from military investigators that \"found probable cause that he indecently assaulted a subordinate while the two were on a training exercise in Florida in 1984\". Investigators stated that they did not find evidence to substantiate a charge of rape, but concluded that \"he probably touched her inappropriately, engaged in conduct unbecoming of an officer, and later made false claims about the incident\". Carter released a statement stating that he was \"vindicated because the Army did not deem the most serious allegation against me to be credible\" but was \"disappointed that the Army has found probable cause for other alleged offenses. I never assaulted anyone, and I cooperated fully with CID's investigation and told the truth\". He further stated that he was retiring to prevent the \"unfounded allegations\" from becoming a distraction to the National Guard. ==Education== ===Civilian=== Carter holds a Bachelor's degree in Organizational Behavior and Management from Lesley College and Master of Arts degree in Criminal Justice Administration from Atlanta University. ===Military=== Carter is a 1992 graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College and a 2002 graduate of US Army War College obtaining a Master of Strategic studies degree. ===Law Enforcement=== Carter is a graduate of the FBI National Academy's 140th Session; a 1986 graduate of the Police Executive Research Forum's Senior Management Institute for Police; a 1991 graduate of the ABA's National Judicial College - Administrative Law Judge course; as well as a graduate of numerous other federal, state and military law enforcement programs. ==See also== * Adjutant General of Massachusetts * National Guard of the United States ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * * * * * *CIVIL ACTION NO. 04-10927-RGS RONALD JORDAN and ROBERT MACKAY v.
