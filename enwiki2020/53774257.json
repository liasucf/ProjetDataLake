She ran as part of the British team at the 2000 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, as well as winning a number of domestic races. Green was selected to run as part of the British women's team in the 2000 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships along with Paula Radcliffe, Marian Sutton, Sue Reinsford and Sarah Young-Wilkinson. In the build-up to the race she won the Bristol Half Marathon in a personal best time, 1:13:28, a minute ahead of Sue Reinsford who was second. Ultimately in the Mexican heat, only herself, Radcliffe, and Young-Wilkinson competed, with Radcliffe winning the race and the team of three finishing sixth. Green was selected again in 2002 alongside Amanda Wright-Allen but did not compete. ==Competition Record== {| |- !colspan=\"6\"|Representing |- |2000 |Paddock Wood Half Marathon |Paddock Wood, United Kingdom |bgcolor=gold|1st |Half marathon |1:16:05 |- |2000 |Bristol Half Marathon |Bristol, United Kingdom |bgcolor=gold|1st |Half marathon |1:13:28 (PB) |- |2000 |IAAF World Half Marathon Championships |Veracruz, Mexico |45th |Half marathon |1:24:53 |- |2001 |Bristol Half Marathon |Bristol, United Kingdom |bgcolor=gold|1st |Half marathon |1:14:56 |- |2001 |Hastings Half Marathon |Hastings, United Kingdom |bgcolor=gold|1st |Half marathon |1:17:08 |- |2001 |Tunbridge Wells Half Marathon |Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom |bgcolor=gold|1st |Half marathon |1:15:36 |- |2001 |Stroud Half Marathon |Stroud, United Kingdom |bgcolor=gold|1st |Half marathon |1:13:56 |- |2002 |Reading Half Marathon |Reading, Berkshire, United Kingdom |bgcolor=gold|1st |Half marathon |1:16:36 |- |2003 |The Morpeth |Morpeth, Northumberland, United Kingdom |bgcolor=gold|1st |Half marathon |1:15:36 |- |2013 |Milton Keynes Marathon |Milton Keynes, United Kingdom |bgcolor=gold|1st |Marathon |3:04:23 |} ==References== == External links == * * * Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:British female long-distance runners Category:English female long-distance runners ",
