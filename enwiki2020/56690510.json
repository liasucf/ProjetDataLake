She is a Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge and a Professor in Applied and Computational Analysis in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge. She is the author of the book Partial Differential Equation Methods for Image Inpainting (Cambridge University Press, 2015), on methods for using the solutions to partial differential equations to fill in gaps in digital images. Sch\u00f6nlieb earned a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Salzburg in 2004. She completed her Ph.D. at Cambridge in 2009. Her dissertation, Modern PDE Techniques for Image Inpainting, was supervised by Peter Markowich. After postdoctoral study at the University of G\u00f6ttingen she returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in 2010. In 2016 Sch\u00f6nlieb won the Whitehead Prize of the London Mathematical Society \"for her spectacular contributions to the mathematics of image analysis\". She won a Philip Leverhulme Prize in 2017, and is the 2018 Mary Cartwright Lecturer of the London Mathematical Society. Since 2016 she has also been a Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute. Carola is Director of the Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information and she is Co-Director of the Centre for Mathematical Imaging in Healthcare\u2014both are based at the University of Cambridge. ==References== ==External links== *Home page * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Austrian mathematicians Category:Women mathematicians Category:University of Salzburg alumni Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:Fellows of Jesus College, Cambridge Category:Cambridge mathematicians ",
