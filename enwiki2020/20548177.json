Retrieved on December 4, 2008. ==Contents== Martial Power, the first supplement in the Power series of books in Dungeons & Dragons, 4th edition, published and debuted new options for the classes that were in the Martial power source. It also expanded and refined the first builds of each class (originally in the Player's Handbook) by giving new powers and paragon paths. ===Fighter=== The fighter, the martial defender, received two new builds to be used in conjunction with the builds in Player's Handbook. The battlerager fighter works as a berserker fighter, which utilizes the new Invigorating keyword, which grants the battlerager temporary hit points to make up for their lack of armor. The tempest fighter is a dual wielding fighter build with great mobility. ===Ranger=== The ranger, a martial striker, received one new build in Martial Power, the beastmaster. Instead of choosing an archery or a two weapon fighting benefit as detailed in the Player's Handbook, the ranger could instead gain a beast to fight alongside with. The beast is used with new beast powers, which grant it attacks and their own effects. ===Rogue=== The rogue, a martial striker, gained two new builds in Martial Power, the aerialist rogue and the cutthroat rogue. The aerialist rogue uses the Acrobatics skill to maneuver around enemies and the cutthroat uses the Intimidation skill to rattle and shake foes. ===Warlord=== The warlord, the martial leader, can use two new builds in conjunction with the two builds in Player's Handbook. The bravura warlord uses daring, and often brash, tactics that could harm the warlord but give great benefits to their allies. The resourceful warlord is a soldier on the battlefield that adapts to certain situations. ==Publication history== Martial Power was published in November 2008 and was designed by Rob Heinsoo, David Noonan, Chris Sims, and Robert J.
