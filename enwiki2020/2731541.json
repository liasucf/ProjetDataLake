    "text": "Watkins Island is a low lying, ice-covered island long, lying SW of Lavoisier Island in the Biscoe Islands. The island was first mapped by the French Antarctic Expedition under Jean-Baptiste Charcot, 1903\u201305 and 1908\u201310, but remained unnamed until resighted by the BGLE under Rymill, 1934\u201337. He gave the name Mikkelsen Island after Ejnar Mikkelsen, Danish Arctic explorer. In applying the name, Rymill was unaware of the existence of Mikkelsen Islands southwestward, named in 1908\u201310 by Charcot. To avoid confusion of the two, the UK-APC recommended in 1952 that the Rymill naming be amended. The new name, Watkins Island, commemorates Gino Watkins, leader of the British Arctic Air Route Expedition, 1930\u201331. A new feature, Mikkelsen Bay, has been named for Ejnar Mikkelsen. == See also == * List of Antarctic islands south of 60\u00b0 S Category:Islands of the Biscoe Islands ",
