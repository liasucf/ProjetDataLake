    "text": "\"Sayang Naman\" (English: \"Only Wasted\") is a pop ballad written by Emil Pama and produced by Ferdie Marquez and Filipino R&B; singer Mike Luis for Nina's second album, Smile (2003). It was released as the album's third single in the second quarter of 2004 in the Philippines. It is known to be Nina's first (and only) Tagalog single. == Release == It was released as the third and final single for the album. A fan requested the song to be the next single after the smash hits of \"Make You Mine\" and \"A Girl Can Dream\". Though the song failed to establish the same impact as the previous hits, the song was praised for its ability to maintain consistency with the album's focus. The whistle register is very evident in the song and is considered one of Nina's powerful songs when it comes to using the whistle register. == Video == A scene from the music video. Special effects are used all the time in the video with Nina seen as part of a mail being sent to a loved one. It is the first video that featured only Nina and no other person in the video.
