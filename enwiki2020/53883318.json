    "text": "Surviving texts indicate that there was a belief in rebirth in Germanic paganism. Examples occur in eddic poetry and sagas, potentially associated with naming and/or through the family line. Scholars have discussed the implications of these attestations and proposed theories regarding belief in reincarnation among the Germanic peoples prior to Christianization and potentially to some extent in folk belief thereafter. ==North Germanic textual mentions== In the Helgi lays of the Poetic Edda, Helgi and his valkyrie lover are said to have been reborn: in the prose at the end of \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hj\u00f6rvar\u00f0ssonar\", there is a statement that Helgi Hj\u00f6rvar\u00f0sson and Sv\u00e1va were subsequently born again, and at the end of \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana II\", that according to \"ancient lore\" now dismissed as \"old women's lying tales\", Helgi Sigmundsson was reborn as Helgi Haddingjaskati (prince of the Haddingjar) and Sigr\u00fan as Kara H\u00e1lfdanard\u00f3ttir.Hilda Roderick Ellis, The Road to Hel: A Study of the Conception of the Dead in Old Norse Literature, Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1943, repr. New York: Greenwood, 1968, , p. 139.Jan de Vries, Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte, Grundri\u00df der germanischen Philologie 12.1, Berlin: De Gruyter, 1935, rev. ed. 1956, repr. as 3rd ed. 1970, , p. 183 .\"Haddingjar\" in: John Lindow, Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs, Santa Barbara, California: ABC-Clio, 2001, repr. Oxford: Oxford University, 2002, , p. 157.N. K. Chadwick, \"Norse Ghosts (A Study in the Draugr and the Haugb\u00fai\", Folklore 57.2, June 1946, pp. 50\u201365, pp. 57\u201359. Conversely in \"Sigur\u00f0arkvi\u00f0a hin skamma\", H\u00f6gni expresses the wish that Brynhildr not be reborn.Ellis, p. 140. In the Flateyjarb\u00f3k version of \u00d3l\u00e1fs saga helga, the \"\u00de\u00e1ttr \u00d3lafs Geirsta\u00f0a Alfs\" recounts how the dead \u00d3laf Geirsta\u00f0a \u00c1lfr gives instructions in a dream for his barrow to be robbed and his body mutilated, and his belt used to ease the birth of a boy who is to be named after him and given his sword and knife; the boy becomes Olaf II of Norway, St. Olaf, and is rumoured among his followers to be the earlier Olaf reincarnated.Ellis, pp. 138\u201339.E. O. G. Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia, History of Religion, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1964, , pp. 193\u201395: \"We can safely say that some people thought that St \u00d3laf was his older namesake reborn\". Nora Chadwick suggested that in the older Olaf's name and elsewhere, the \u00e1lfar (elves) referred to souls awaiting rebirth.Chadwick, p. 58 and note 18. There are also mentions in two legendary sagas of boys being born with the marks of wounds that were dealt to an ancestor: in Gautreks saga, a poem by Starka\u00f0r alludes to the marks supposedly on his body from his grandfather's eight arms being torn off by the god Thor, and in one version of \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0ar saga hr\u00e6\u00f0u, \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0r is born with a mark on his left arm corresponding to a wound his father had received.Ellis, pp. 140\u201341. ==Names== In \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana II\", the second Helgi receives his name while sitting on a barrow; King Olaf was named after a man buried in a barrow at the latter's request; and in another tale in Flateyjarb\u00f3k and in Vatnsd\u00e6la saga, Svarfd\u00e6la saga and Finnboga saga, dead and dying men ask for their names to be passed on, often to future sons of those they are speaking to. Hilda Ellis Davidson saw a connection between name- giving and the idea of rebirth in these passages.Ellis, pp. 139\u201342. Gustav Storm proposed this interpretation in an 1893 article;Gustav Storm, \"Vore Forf\u00e6dres Tro paa Sj\u00e6lvandring og deres Opkaldelsessystem\", Arkiv f\u00f6r nordisk filologi (1893) 119\u201320; cited in Ellis, pp. 143\u201344. a study of Icelandic genealogies by Max Keil supported the conclusion but cast into question Storm's idea that there was a change in practice from name-giving using variation to name-giving using repetition, and also distinguished a belief in rebirth from transmigration of souls as it is understood in Eastern religion, involving a progression over a series of lives.Max Keil, Altisl\u00e4ndische Namenwahl, Palaestra 176, Leipzig: Mayer & M\u00fcller, 1931, ; cited in Ellis, pp. 142, 144\u201345. Both scholars noted that a grandfather's name was most commonly re-used\u2014Jan de Vries saw the derivation of the German word for 'grandson', Enkel, from Old High German eninchil\u00ee, 'little grandfather', as support for the idea that a belief in rebirth underlay the custom of skipping one generation in namingDe Vries, p. 218.\u2014and rarely that of a still living person, and Keil also concluded that what genealogical evidence there is on women suggests the same practice in naming as for men. Sami customs of naming also rest on a belief that people are reborn into the same family.Ellis, p. 146.Thomas A. DuBois, Nordic Religions in the Viking Age, The Middle Ages Series, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1999, , p. 75. ==Historical reports== In the 2nd century CE, Appian wrote in his Roman History that the Teutons had no fear of death because they hoped to be reborn.Cited in de Vries, p. 217. ==Archaeology== K. A. Eckhardt, who published a book on the concept of rebirth within the extended family or clan, suggested that the burial position with the legs drawn up against the body emulated the position of the foetus in the womb and was therefore evidence of the belief in rebirth.Karl August Eckhardt, Irdische Unsterblichkeit: germanischer Glaube an die Wiederverk\u00f6rperung in der Sippe, Studien zur Rechts- und Religionsgeschichte 1, Weimar: B\u00f6hlau, 1937, , p. 128, cited in de Vries, Volume 1, p. 79, note 2. ==See also== * Norse_cosmology#Time_and_space, discussion regarding cyclic time in Norse cosmology * S\u00e6hr\u00edmnir, a creature killed, eaten, and brought back to life every day in Valhalla, an afterlife hall in Norse mythology * Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str, the North Germanic god Thor's goats, which may be consumed and resurrected by the god ==References== Category:Germanic mythology Category:Reincarnation ",
