    "text": "Desovo (, ) is a village in the municipality of Dolneni, North Macedonia. == History == The village of Desovo was a center of the Albanian Movement in the area. In September 1912, Serb majors M. Vasi\u0107 and Vasilije Trbi\u0107, a Chetnik commander operating from Pore\u010dje region, gathered 30 Chetniks and travelled to the village of Desovo where they shot 111 Albanian men and razed the village. Desovo was once again razed in 1929 by Serb Chetnik bands active in the region. The event led to the first wave of migrations of Desovo Albanians mainly to Turkey, with some others going abroad to the United States and Australia. In 1948 Desovo numbered around 1,500 inhabitants mostly Albanians. Due to the sociopolitical pressures experienced within post war communist Yugoslavia under Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107, between 1963\u20131968 most of the remaining Albanians in Desovo migrated to Turkey. In the 21st century, the village population is made up of Macedonians, Bosniaks and national Albanian sentiments among remaining Albanians have somewhat dissipated with assimilation being an issue. An Albanian school functions for the small Albanian community. p. 239. \"P\u00ebr Desov\u00ebn dhe desovar\u00ebt mund t\u00eb shkruhet deri n\u00eb vitin 1963, kur ndodhin shp\u00ebrnguljet masive p\u00ebr n\u00eb Turqi...
