After three years the team was transformed from an amateur team into a professional UCI team, and is invited to compete in major races all over Europe. The team itself no longer consists purely of British riders. Since 2019 the team includes women of seven different countries (Germany, Austria, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, France and Canada) giving it an even greater international flavour. 2019 saw a big expansion and inclusion of high-level riders into the team roster such as Kirsten Wild, Lisa Brennauer and Ane Santesteban. Due this expansion the team made the step-up into the top 10 of the UCI-ranking, with a ranking of 7th place. In 2020 the team signed Maria Giulia Confalonieri of Italy and Julie Leth of Denmark, both double European Champions. ===2017=== Ahead of the 2017 season, WNT made another leap in the team's progression by applying for a UCI Women's team licence, with former Scottish Cycling head coach Graeme Herd as their directeur sportif. Expanding its roster outside the UK and Ireland, gaining Austrian Anna Badegruber and Luxembourger Elise Maes from Austrian team Vitalogic Astrokalb Radunion N\u00f6 as it stepped away from its UCI Women licence in 2017. The team won its first professional race in its first outing as a UCI team in March 2017, on stage 4 of Setmana Ciclista Valenciana when Irish Champion Lydia Boylan soloed to victory. The team's second UCI victory came at the Lotto Th\u00fcringen Ladies Tour on stage 3, when Hayley Simmonds attacked in the closing kilometres, taking a solo victory of over a minute, and consequently moved into the yellow jersey. Simmonds finished 3rd place on general classification behind Lisa Brennauer. At the end of 2017, the team's service course moved from the UK to Reutte, Austria, the hometown of WNT's parent company, Ceratizit, although the team's address registered with the Union Cycliste Internationale was still located in Sheffield. ===2018=== 2018 saw a further internationalisation of the roster, with the additions of German Lea Lin Teutenberg and Dutchwoman Aafke Soet. Spanish bicycle component manufacturer, Rotor signed onto Team WNT as a second naming sponsor, setting the team to be the first to race full-time on hydraulic shifting and braking groupset. WNT-Rotor took on a greater Spanish influence with its switch from long time frame partner Specialized to Orbea. The team also joined as one of five UCI women's teams to transition to disc brakes in 2018, moving from its already new hydraulic Rotor rim brake groupset to debut the disc brake version at Dwars door Vlaanderen. Shortly after the team completed Setmana Ciclista Valenciana, it was announced that Graeme Herd would leave the team immediately, with Dirk Baldinger taking up Herd's role as DS. Former rider, Canadian Gabrielle Pilote-Fortin was a late signing for 2018 at the end of March. Half the team's then ten rider roster were selected to compete on the road and track at the 2018 Commonwealth Games; for Northern Ireland, Lydia Boylan, for Wales, Hayley Jones, for Scotland, Eileen Roe, and for England Melissa Lowther and Hayley Simmonds. While Melissa Lowther had been selected for both the time trial and road race, but due to an administrative error by Team England, Lowther was barred from starting the individual time trial. Hayley Simmonds earned a bronze medal in the Commonwealth Games individual time trial, behind recent ITT world championship medallist Katrin Garfoot and former time trial world champion Linda Villumsen. Aafke Soet earned WNT Rotor's first win of the 2018 season at the start of April by winning the last stage of the Healthy Ageing Tour in solo breakaway, the victory was also her first-ever elite-level win. Soet would back up that road race win at her next race appearance, with the fastest time in the time trial event at Omloop van Borsele. ===2019=== The Season 2019 started very successfully for the WNT- ROTOR Pro Cycling Team. After wins at the Six Days in Bremen (Germany) on the track the new team member Clara Koppenburg won stage 3 of the Seltmana Ciclista Valenciana and took over the General Classification jersey. The team defended this jersey on stage 4 and also won the team classification. One-week later Kirsten Wild and Lisa Brennauer won in total 5 medals at the Track World Championships in Pruszkow, Poland. (Kirsten: Gold in Madison and omnium, Silver in the scratch race and Bronze in the points race. Lisa: Silver medal at the individual pursuit and a new German record). The team won its first UCI Women's World Tour race at Driedaagse Brugge-De Panne with Kirsten Wild who won the bunch sprint after a big lead out form Lisa Brennauer. Three days later, Kirsten Wild won our second UCI Women's World Tour race, Gent-Wevelgem, becoming the first rider to win the Belgian spring classic twice. In total the team amassed 15 victories in road racing during the 2019 season with four different riders. Kathrin Hammes won the overall classification of the Lotto Th\u00fcringen Ladies Tour after being in the breakaway on stage 1. The team helped defended the yellow, where Kathrin was able to win her home tour by 11 seconds. On the 28th November 2019, the team announced that the CERATIZIT Group, who are the parent company of WNT would be joining as title sponsor of the team. ==Sponsorship== The WNT company is part of the CERATIZIT Group which offers high quality tools and a unique service to the metal cutting industry. The Ceratizit Group is a privately owned company, based in Mamer, Luxembourg which develops and manufactures highly specialised carbide cutting tools, inserts and rods made of hard materials as well as wear parts. With over 9,000 employees at 34 production sites and a sales network of over 70 branch offices, the Group is a global player in the carbide industry. Cycling has a close connection to WNT products. Many bicycle components are manufactured using metal cutting technology. Important customers, such as the British firm Hope Technology or the Spanish company Rotor Bike Components, use WNT's quality tools to produce their high-quality bicycle parts. Therefore, cycling sponsorship is an ideal marketing tool for WNT to increase brand awareness and make products more accessible to the general public outside of the narrow target groups. Despite this, cycling embodies exactly this same spirit, which is already present within the company and its values. For the 2018 season ROTOR joined the team as a named sponsor, with the team running their high quality bike components. ROTOR not only sells its products, the company is also developing and manufacturing its products. The manufacturing is mainly done via CNC machining and this is where the cooperation between Rotor and WNT started already a few ago. As a supplier for metal cutting tools, WNT has always been a reliable partner for ROTOR and therefore the partnership within the WNT-ROTOR Pro Cycling Team is another perfect fit. Other Partners in 2019 are Orbea, Cuore, Seitz, Suplest, Edco, Repente, Wahoo, Tubolito, Wolfpack, Velotoze, Lizardskins, Gairrit and DryFluid. The team's partners for 2020 are Orbea, ROTOR, Cuore, Seitz, Suplest, Schmolke Carbon, Repente, Wahoo, Tubolito, Wolfpack, Velotoze, Lizardskins, Gairrit, Morgan Blue, KCNC, KMC, Powerbar, Kask, KOO and Scicon. ==Team roster== ==Major wins== ;2017 :Stage 4 Semana Ciclista Valenciana, Lydia Boylan :Stage 3 Th\u00fcringen Rundfahrt der Frauen, Hayley Simmonds :Round 2 Stoke-on-Trent Tour Series, Katie Archibald :Round 6 Bath Tour Series, Eileen Roe :Round 7 Motherwell Tour Series, Eileen Roe :Round 8 Team Time Trial, Stevenage Tour Series, Katie Archibald, Emily Kay, Keira McVitty, Gabriella Shaw, Lydia Boylan ;2018 :Stage 5 Healthy Ageing Tour, Aafke Soet :Omloop van Borsele Time Trial, Aafke Soet :20px Young rider classification Emakumeen Euskal Bira, Aafke Soet ;2019 :20px Overall Setmana Ciclista Valenciana, Clara Koppenburg ::Stage 3, Clara Koppenburg :1st 15px Three Days of De Panne, Kirsten Wild :1st 15px Gent-Wevelgem, Kirsten Wild :Stages 3 & 5 Healthy Ageing Tour, Kirsten Wild :Stage 4b Healthy Ageing Tour, Lisa Brennauer :20px Overall Festival Elsy Jacobs, Lisa Brennauer ::20px Points classification, Lisa Brennauer ::Stage 2, Lisa Brennauer :20px Basque rider classification Emakumeen Euskal Bira, Ane Santesteban :20px Overall Th\u00fcringen Rundfahrt der Frauen, Kathrin Hammes :Stages 1 & 2 Tour de Bretagne F\u00e9minin, Kirsten Wild :1st 15px Stage 1 Individual Time Trial CERATIZIT Madrid Challenge by La Vuelta Lisa Brennauer :20px Overall CERATIZIT Madrid Challenge by La Vuelta Lisa Brennauer ==National, European and World Championships== ;2015 :20px Irish Road Race, Lydia Boylan ;2016 :20px Irish Road Race, Lydia Boylan ;2017 :20px British Track (Individual pursuit), Katie Archibald :20px British Track (Points race), Katie Archibald :20px British Track (Scratch race), Katie Archibald :20px British Track (Omnium), Katie Archibald :link=National cycling champion jersey British Criterium, Katie Archibald :20px World Track (Omnium), Katie Archibald :20px Irish Road Race, Lydia Boylan :20px Irish Track (Scratch race), Lydia Boylan :20px European Track (Individual pursuit), Katie Archibald :20px European Track (Omnium), Katie Archibald ;2018 :20px Irish Track (Omnium), Lydia Boylan :20px European U23 Time Trial, Aafke Soet :20px Irish Track (Scratch Race), Lydia Boylan ;2019 :20px World Track (Omnium), Kirsten Wild :20px World Track (Madison), Kirsten Wild :20px European Track (Omnium), Kirsten Wild :20px European Track (Elimination Race), Kirsten Wild :20px European Track (Individual Pursuit), Franziska Brausse :20px European Track (U23 Individual Pursuit), Franziska Brausse :20px German Road Race, Lisa Brennauer :20px German Track (Madison), Franziska Brausse :20px German Track (Madison), Lin Teutenberg :20px German Track (Omnium), Franziska Brausse :20px German Track (Team Pursuit), Franziska Brausse :20px German Track (Individual Pursuit), Franziska Brausse ;2020 :20px World Track (Madison), Kirsten Wild :20px World Track (Scratch), Kirsten Wild :20px Denmark Track (Omnium), Julie Leth :20px German Road Race, Lisa Brennauer :20px European Team Time Trial, Lisa Brennauer :20px Denmark Track (Individual Sprint), Julie Leth :20px European U23 Track (Individual pursuit), Franziska Brau\u00dfe ==References== ==External links== * Category:UCI Women's Teams Category:Cycling teams established in 2014 Category:Cycling teams based in Germany ",
