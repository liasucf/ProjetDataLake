They are designated as a Special Protection Area and a Site of Special Scientific Interest for wildlife conservation purposes. == Loch of Spiggie == Bathymetrical Survey of the Lochs of Spiggie and Brow, Shetland from a survey in 1903 The Loch of Spiggie was historically a voe (Shetland Dialect: fjord or inlet) in which a sand bar formed, cutting off the sea. It is considered \"the only moderately large loch\" in the South Mainland of Shetland, and is the fourth longest loch in Shetland. It is roughly rectangular, with the longest dimension approximately north\u2013south, and the maximum width is almost ; its area is roughly 1 km2. The loch is an RSPB nature reserve. The loch supports many species of birds, including lapwing, tufted duck, redshank, snipe and whooper swan. Additionally, various seasonal visiting birds also make use of the loch \u2013 in spring, long-tailed duck and skylark; and in summer, oystercatcher, curlew, mallard, arctic tern, kittiwake and great skua. The birds breed in the marshes and farmland next to the loch. == Loch of Brow == The Loch of Brow is a smaller loch, about 0.25 km2 in area, lying to the south-east of the Loch of Spiggie, into which it outflows. The remains of a broch can be found on a small island in the loch. It used to be accessible by a number of stepping stones which formed a \"rough causeway\", however these now lie under water. The remnants of a circular hollow approximately in diameter can be seen, which is thought to have been the interior lining of the broch. A small portion of an outward-facing wall was excavated at the north end that suggested the broch's walls may have been between thick. == References == == Sources == * * * * * == External links == *Special Protection Area designation *RSPB Loch of Spiggie website Category:Special Protection Areas in Scotland Category:Royal Society for the Protection of Birds reserves in Scotland Spiggie and Brow Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Shetland Category:Protected areas of Shetland Category:Mainland, Shetland ",
