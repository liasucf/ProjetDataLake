Both are the same age, and both are pretty, but that's where the similarities end. While Margrid is roaming the streets of Paris in rags, Marie Antoinette dances and flirts at the Palais-Royal. The French Revolution changes all that. Margrid Arnaud rises and Marie Antoinette falls, and when the two women eventually meet two worlds collide and the drama unfolds. The musical uses the events of the French Revolution as a spectacular backdrop to the fate of the unhappy Queen. Margrid Arnaud personifies the nemesis of the monarchy, eventually leading to the extinction of Marie Antoinette and her world. ==Background== In an interview on his website, Kunze said that producers had offered to stage the show in German and English-speaking countries, but he that he wanted to have the Kuriyama production all over the world. His previous musicals were adapted for the country they were played in. Kunze believes that the production MA is the best interpretation of one of his Libretti so far. He praised the director and the cast.
