    "text": "In geometric group theory, a presentation complex is a 2-dimensional cell complex associated to any presentation of a group G. The complex has a single vertex, and one loop at the vertex for each generator of G. There is one 2-cell for each relation in the presentation, with the boundary of the 2-cell attached along the appropriate word. == Properties == * The fundamental group of the presentation complex is the group G itself. * The universal cover of the presentation complex is a Cayley complex for G, whose 1-skeleton is the Cayley graph of G. * Any presentation complex for G is the 2-skeleton of an Eilenberg\u2013MacLane space K(G,1). == Examples == Let G= \\Z^2 be the two- dimensional integer lattice, with presentation : G=\\langle x,y|xyx^{-1}y^{-1}\\rangle. Then the presentation complex for G is a torus, obtained by gluing the opposite sides of a square, the 2-cell, which are labelled x and y. All four corners of the square are glued into a single vertex, the 0-cell of the presentation complex, while a pair consisting of a longtitudal and meridian circles on the torus, intersecting at the vertex, constitutes its 1-skeleton. The associated Cayley complex is a regular tiling of the plane by unit squares. The 1-skeleton of this complex is a Cayley graph for \\Z^2. Let G = \\Z_2 *\\Z_2 be the Infinite dihedral group, with presentation \\langle a,b \\mid a^2,b^2 \\rangle. The presentation complex for G is \\mathbb{RP}^2 \\vee \\mathbb{RP}^2, the wedge sum of projective planes. For each path, there is one 2-cell glued to each loop, which provides the standard cell structure for each projective plane. The Cayley complex is an infinite string of spheres. == References == * Roger C. Lyndon and Paul E. Schupp, Combinatorial group theory.
