Barwani district has an area of 5,427 km\u00b2 and a population 1,385,881 (2011 census). The district lies in the southwestern corner of Madhya Pradesh; the Narmada River forms its northern boundary. The Satpura Range lies to its south. The district is bordered by Maharashtra state to the south, Gujarat state to the west, Dhar District to the north and Khargone District to the east. ==History== In the historical context, Barwani district is described as a rich and fertile land due to Narmada basin. District and its headquarters share the same name. Carved out of Khargone (West-Nimar) district Barwani was formed on 25th May 1998. Between the ranges of Vindyachal and Satpura, the Narmada Valley was the region of Aadi manav the early man. The excavation carried out by Archaeological survey of India near the village Chikhalda on the bank of Narmada river in between Khaperkheda and Barwani at village Pipri shows the presence of human civilization some five thousand years back, inhabited by the tribals practising shifting cultivation called Jhum. The name Badwani originated from the forests of Bad (Banyan tree) which had surrounded the city in old times. Wani is the old word for the garden and hence city got its name Badwani which means garden of Bads. Barwani is still pronounced as Badwani but it spells Barwani. Although the old district west Nimar was ruled by the Satavahanas, Kardamakas, Abhiras, Imperial Gupta, Kalachuris, Vardhana, Chalukyas, Rastrakutas, Pratiharas and the Paramaras; yet there was evidence in the form of copper plate of Subandhu to confirm that the district was under the rule of an independent chief Maharaja Subandhu during the fifth century (468 A.D.). Till 1311 no other evidence found to be determined the dynasty which ruled over the state except the Sesodias of Barwani.The district came under the reigns of Sultans of Malwa almost from the end of 14th century. The fertile valley of Narmada witnessed ups and downs of imperialism. The founder of the Barwani empire was belonging to Guhilot, Suryavanshi dynasty.His forefathers lived in village Sisoda of Rajasthan for quite sometime, so also are called Sisodiyas. In the 14th century by a Sisodia Prince from Mewar, who migrated into the Narmada Valley, and settled at Avasgarh, a hill in the Satpuras, about 78 kilometres southwest of the present capital. Until 1650, the state was called Avasgadh, after its original capital. The Rana family of Udaipur came in search of livehood in the Nimar region and slowly seized the simple tribals on the basis of their subordination. It is said that the Barwani state was established by Dhanak, a warrior who made his kingdom at Awasgarh. Rana Limbaji of Badwani state was succeeded by his eldest son Rana Chandra Singh in 1640 who founded modern Barwani town. He made Badwani as his capital formerly known as Sidhnagar. Later on the Marathas appeared in the scene of administration from 1703 to 1823. From the beginning of the 18th century the power of the Ranas of Barwani gradually declined; their country, originally of considerable extent and situated between the Narmada and the 11 Tapti, was devastated by the Marathas, and at the time of Malcolm\u2019s settlement of Malwa (1819), only a strip of the Satpura range, 207 kilometres in length, with the lowlands on either side, remained to them. They did not, however, become tributary to any of the Malwa Chiefs. From 1823 to 1854 Nimar was under the superior control of the Resident at Indore and after 1854, the Agent to the Governor General in central India. Unrest started all over the district during the first 20 years of British utter mismanagement, devolvement of military officers and all. The district had a record that under the able leadership of Bhima Nayak, one Khajia Naik of Sangir made an attempt to rise against the British in 1857 by cutting telegraph wires, by looting their treasury on the high road and by plundering a few places of Nimar. In October 1858 Tatya Tope, one of the foremost leaders of the Great revolt, crossed the Narmada river and reached Khandwa, but was compelled to escape to central India by way of Khargone in order to escape from the hands of British troops trying to pounce upon him. Khajia Naik, Bhil Chief Bhima and Mawasim joined Tatya Tope at Rajpur. The second fight was fought at Dhaba Baoli, a village in Barwani after which Bhima was caught. Later on, Khajia Naik was also trapped and caught by Major Suntherland with the help of some Makrani detectives and decapitate Barwani state was merged with the Madhya Bharat state after independence in 1948.
