    "text": "The Roulettes were a British rock and roll and beat group formed in London in 1961. They were recruited to play as the backing group to singer Adam Faith the following year, and continued to perform and record until the late 1960s. ==History== The group originated among friends at Sutton High School for Boys, including guitarist Peter Thorp. Originally called the Strangers, they were seen by publicist Leslie Perrin, who recommended them to Adam Faith's manager Eve Taylor. Faith was looking for a touring band that would enable him to perform similar music to that of the beat bands then emerging from Merseyside. Renamed as the Roulettes, the band - then comprising Peter Thorp, Martin Blackwell, Tony Burgess and John Roberts - first performed with Faith at the Royal Albert Hall in September 1961.Eddy Bonte, \"Soon You'll Be Leaving Me\", Shindig! magazine, issue 84, October 2018 The group toured widely with Faith between 1961 and 1963, with several changes of personnel, and recorded one unsuccessful single for Pye, \"Hully Gully Slip'n'Slide\". By early 1963, the group comprised Thorp (guitar), John Rogers (bass), Bob Henrit (drums), and Russ Ballard (guitar and keyboards). They recorded a lengthy series of short 15-minute shows with Adam Faith for Radio Luxembourg. John Rogers was killed in a car crash in May 1963; he was replaced by John 'Mod' Rogan, previously of Hartlepool group the Hartbeats. They began recording with Adam Faith - who had previously recorded with session musicians - for the Parlophone label, and their records were credited to \"Adam Faith with The Roulettes\". They enjoyed a run of chart hits in the mid-1960s, including the UK chart hits; \"The First Time\", \"We Are in Love\", \"I Love Being in Love With You\", \"If He Tells You\", and \"Someone's Taken Maria Away\". They also recorded in their own right for Parlophone, recording several early compositions by Chris Andrews, though none of their singles reached the charts. Their only album Stakes And Chips was released in 1965 with similar success. As well as backing Adam Faith on record, they accompanied him on tour until October 1965, most notably backing him on a 'Live' album. Early in 1967 they joined the Philips Fontana label but still the charts eluded them, although they toured Europe until later that year when the group split up.[ Biography], Allmusic.com Band members Russ Ballard and Bob Henrit went on to join Unit 4 + 2 formed by original Roulettes' member Brian Parker (on whose 1965 number one song, \"Concrete and Clay\", they had both previously played); the two would later also become members of rock band Argent. In addition Ballard had later success as a solo artist and songwriter, whilst Henrit became a renowned session drummer and also replaced The Kinks' long serving drummer Mick Avory in their later years. Adam Faith's song \"Cowman, Milk Your Cow\" was written by Bee Gees members Barry and Robin Gibb on which the Roulettes (Ballard, Rogan and Henrit) played, Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green also played guitar on the song. ==Members== *Peter Thorp \u2013 lead guitar, rhythm guitar (born 25 May 1944, Wimbledon, South West London) (replaced Parker in the band) *Brian Parker \u2013 lead guitar (born Brian William Parker, 1940, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, died 17 February 2001) (though left within short space of time) *Johnny Rogers \u2013 bass guitar (born John Rogers, 1941, Hertfordshire, died 27 May 1963, Lincolnshire from injuries sustained in a car crash) *Alan 'Honk' Jones \u2013 saxophone *Norman Stracey \u2013 rhythm guitar, also keyboards (born Norman Henry Stracey, 1941, Ware, Hertfordshire) (replaced Jones in the band when a saxophone player was no longer required) *Bob Henrit \u2013 drums (born Robert John Henrit, 2 May 1944, Broxbourne, Hertfordshire) *Russ Ballard \u2013 March 1963 onwards, keyboards, later lead guitar and lead vocals (born Russell Glyn Ballard, 31 October 1945, Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire) (replaced Stracey in the band, was recruited to play keyboards but was soon sharing lead guitar with Thorp) *John 'Mod' Rogan \u2013 bass guitar, May 1963 onwards (born John George Rogan, 3 February 1944, Hartlepool, County Durham) (replaced Rogers following his unfortunate demise) ==See also== *List of 1960s one-hit wonders in the United States ==References== ==External links== *[ The Roulettes biography] at Allmusic website Category:British rock music groups Category:Beat groups Category:Musical groups established in 1962 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1967 ",
