It operates worldwide air freight and logistics services and is headquartered at Frankfurt Airport, the main hub of Lufthansa.\"Lufthansa Cargo appoints new regional managers .\" Lufthansa Cargo. 6 February 2008.

Retrieved on 28 May 2011. \"Lufthansa Cargo AG Flughafenbereich West Tor 25, Geb\u00e4ude 451 D-60546 Frankfurt am Main\" Besides operating dedicated cargo planes, the company also has access to cargo capacities of 350 passenger aircraft of the Lufthansa Group. ==History== Lufthansa operated a cargo subsidiary, called German Cargo, between 1977 and 1993 (earlier still, cargo operations were executed in-house, under the Lufthansa Cargo name), when \u2013 in an effort to restructure the company \u2013 the cargo division was re-integrated into its parent, and split up into two parts (one for scheduled operations using Lufthansa-owned aircraft, and one for freight and logistics services using chartered or leased aircraft). Lufthansa Cargo was created as a limited stock company on 30 November 2004, along with Lufthansa Cargo Charter. Lufthansa Cargo uses LH (the same IATA code as Lufthansa), as well as GEC (the former ICAO code of German Cargo) as airline codes. Lufthansa is unique compared to its major European competitors like British Airways and Air France in that the cargo business is organized in an entirely different airline entity. For some years, Lufthansa Cargo (including the freight transported in the cargo holds of mainline Lufthansa passenger aircraft) was the leading cargo airline in terms of international freight tonne-kilometres carried, but has since been surpassed by Cathay Pacific and Korean Air Cargo. ==Operations and subsidiaries== D-ALFA, the first Boeing 777F delivered to Lufthansa Cargo As of 2011, all Lufthansa Cargo aircraft are based at Frankfurt Airport, the seventh busiest freight hub in the world, where the airline enjoys a strong co-operation with Fraport, the operator of the airport. Cargo facilities at the airport are divided into two places (Cargo City North and South), of which the first one is nearly exclusively used by Lufthansa Cargo. In earlier years, Lufthansa Cargo had a secondary base at Leipzig/Halle Airport, the European hub for DHL Express, from where it operated flights on behalf of DHL. Activities at this airport gradually came to an end following the formation of AeroLogic as a joint venture between Lufthansa and DHL, which henceforth caters for the DHL flights, allowing Lufthansa Cargo to concentrate on other services.AeroLogic outlines launch and expansion plans Flight Global, 28 January 2008 In 1996, Hinduja Cargo Services was founded as a joint venture between Hinduja Group and Lufthansa Cargo. The company operated a fleet of Boeing 727 freighters, flying from airports in the Indian subcontinent to feed Lufthansa Cargo's hub at Sharjah airport. The airline suspended operations in 2000 in favour of direct services from Frankfurt using Lufthansa Cargo aircraft. In 2000, Lufthansa Cargo was a founding member of the WOW Alliance, a global cargo airline alliance, but left in 2007 as it did not see any benefits for the future. Lufthansa Cargo used to operate a hub for intra-Asian flights at Astana International Airport in Kazakhstan, but was forced to relocate it to Yemelyanovo Airport in Russia in 2007, because otherwise the airline would have been banned from entering Russian airspace, in what was described as an act of economic blackmail by the Russian authorities.Russia 'Blackmails' Lufthansa over Cargo Hubs Spiegel Online International 11/02/2007 In 2008, Jade Cargo International was founded as a joint venture between Shenzhen Airlines, Lufthansa Cargo, and the German Investment Corporation, a German governmental entity. Jade ended operations in 2011. In May 2011, Lufthansa Cargo opened another hub at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad, to transport temperature-sensitive goods, especially pharmaceuticals, between South East Asia and Europe (and onwards to the United States). ==Destinations== As of October 2013, Lufthansa Cargo serves 57 cities worldwide with its cargo aircraft. ==Fleet== ===Current fleet=== Lufthansa Cargo McDonnell Douglas MD-11F As of September 2020 the Lufthansa Cargo fleet consists of the following aircraft: {| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;text-align:center\" |+ Lufthansa Cargo fleet |-style=\"background:#0A1D3D; color=white;\" !Aircraft !In service !Orders !Notes |- |Boeing 777F |9 |-- | |- |McDonnell Douglas MD-11F |6 |-- |Retirement delayed due to high freight demand related to COVID-19 |- !Total !15 !-- | |} With the delivery of the first Boeing 777F, Lufthansa Cargo started to name their aircraft in a scheme referring to typical greetings of the countries they serve. The first 777F was named Good day, USA, while an MD-11F was named Buenos d\u00edas M\u00e9xico for example. ===Fleet development=== A former Lufthansa Cargo Boeing 747-200 featuring the WOW Alliance logo in 2004 A former Lufthansa Cargo McDonnell Douglas DC-8-73 in 1994. The initial fleet of Lufthansa Cargo had previously belonged to German Cargo, and was expanded by cargo-converted former Lufthansa mainline Boeing 747-200s. From 1998, the airline began to gradually phase out all other aircraft types in favour of a fleet entirely consisting of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 (which Lufthansa received as freighter versions in 2001 after MD-11 production ended) version and its successor, the Boeing 777 freighter. In March 2011, the order of five Boeing 777F was announced, the same aircraft type which had earlier been chosen for AeroLogic. Almost the entire Lufthansa Cargo fleet today is composed of purpose-built freighter aircraft. Over the years, the following aircraft types were operated: {| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;text-align:center\" |+ Lufthansa Cargo fleet development |-style=\"background:#0A1D3D; color=white;\" !Aircraft !Introduced !Retired |- |Boeing 737-300F |1994 |1997 |- |Boeing 747-200F |1994 |2005 |- |Boeing 777F |2013 |-- |- |Douglas DC-8-73F |1994 |1997 |- |McDonnell Douglas MD-11F |1998 |-- |} ==Accidents and incidents== * On 7 November 2004 at 16:35 local time, a Boeing 747-200 freighter, owned and operated by Air Atlanta Icelandic, overshot the runway upon take-off at Sharjah International Airport and was damaged beyond repair. The aircraft, registered TF-ARR, had been leased by Lufthansa Cargo to operate Flight 8457 to Frankfurt Airport. The pilots had decided to abort the take-off run even though the remaining runway length did not suffice to bring the aircraft to a halt because of a burst tyre and the ATC notification of an alleged fire (which turned out to be not true). The four people on board were not injured. * On 27 July 2010 at 11:38 local time, Lufthansa Cargo Flight 8460, an MD-11 registered D-ALCQ, crashed upon landing at King Khalid International Airport, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and was damaged beyond repair in the ensuing fire. The Pilot in command and the First Officer -- the only two persons on board -- were able to leave the aircraft by themselves. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Airlines of Germany Category:IATA members Category:Cargo airlines of Germany Category:Airlines established in 1994 Category:Lufthansa Group Category:Germany\u2013Russia relations Category:1994 establishments in Germany ",
