    "text": "Mrs. Doubtfire is a musical with a book by Karey Kirkpatrick and John O'Farrell and music and lyrics by Wayne and Karey Kirkpatrick, based on the 1993 Twentieth Century Fox film of the same name (which is based on the 1987 novel Madame Doubtfire by Anne Fine). == Background == On January 22, 2015, Entertainment Weekly reported that a musical adaptation of Mrs. Doubtfire was in the works, with music by Alan Menken, lyrics by David Zippel, and a book by Harvey Fierstein (who played Frank Hillard in the movie). Producer Kevin McCollum had previously spoken to The New York Times in 2013 about the 1993 movie's musical prospects, noting that the plot was \"tailored for Broadway audiences\". However, in 2016, Menken told Digital Spy that the project was put on 'creative hiatus', citing changes in the creative team as the problem. Nevertheless in 2018, McCollum revealed that the adaptation was still aiming for a Broadway bow, but with an entirely different creative team which includes Karey and Wayne Kirkpatrick composing the score, and John O'Farrell and Karey Kirkpatrick writing the book. Tony Award-winner Jerry Zaks was also announced as the director of the show. In 2019, the musical held a reading with a cast including Rob McClure, Kate Baldwin, Mario Cantone, and Jake Ryan Flynn. == Production == The musical is directed by Jerry Zaks with choreography by Lorin Latarro.
