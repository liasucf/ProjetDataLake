It is located on Mexican Federal Highway 1 between Guerrero Negro and Santa Rosal\u00eda. The town had a 2010 census population of 6672010 census tables: INEGI inhabitants and grew at the site of the Cochim\u00ed settlement of Kadakaam\u00e1n and the Jesuit Mission San Ignacio founded in 1728Sigismundo Taraval. 1967 by Juan Bautista Luyando. ==Natural history== The locale has certain basaltic soils, providing clues as to the volcanic history of this region. There are a variety of desert flora and fauna in the vicinity of San Ignacio, notably including the elephant tree, (Bursera microphylla).C. Michael Hogan. 2009 At San Ignacio, Baja California's arid Central Desert terrain gives way to a large grove of lush green date palms. A large spring-fed pond and small river on the outskirts of town feeds into the central plaza and village next to the eighteenth-century Jesuit mission. San Ignacio serves as the gateway to San Ignacio Lagoon, the winter time sanctuary of the Pacific gray whale. ==Location== San Ignacio is located approximately 866 km/567 miles from the San Diego, California|/Tijuana border crossing, about a 10- to 12-hour drive. One can travel on Mexican Federal Highway 1 by vehicle to arrive in San Ignacio. Highway 1 is a well-maintained, four-lane, toll highway from Tijuana to Ensenada. South of Ensenada, Highway 1 becomes a narrow (but relatively well-maintained) two-lane highway. Slow but steady progress is being made to support the tourism industry and Pemex gas stations are now located in every major town through which Highway 1 travels on the way to San Ignacio, both from the North and from the South. Driving only during daylight hours is recommended, due to livestock that frequently cross the road at night, and decreased visibility of the narrow and winding roads through the mountain sides. The nearest airports are located to the north at Guerrero Negro Airport in Guerrero Negro, or to the south at Loreto International Airport in Loreto. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * C.
