He was profoundly learned, and had extensive knowledge and mastery over the Islamic traditions and heritage and attained such a station in it that none of his contemporaries or anyone of those who came after him, or even most of the celebrities of the preceding centuries, have been able to attain. He spent his entire noble life in fathoming the mysteries of religiosity and in the defence of Islam and the realm of sincere religion. I don't know of anyone in the latter centuries who waged a jihad like him and sacrificed everything in his possession in the way of everlasting truths. The times, in all ages and periods, will never see a compeer of him in his research, his extensive knowledge, his precision, intelligence, and the immensity of his memory and retention.\" == Works == He wrote the following books: # Asf\u0101r al-anw\u0101r \u02bfan waq\u0101\u02bei\u02bf af\u1e0dal al-asf\u0101r, Zayn al-was\u0101\u02beil and al-Dhar\u0101\u02bei\u02bf. # Abaqat al'anwar fi imamat al 'A'immat al'athar is popular among Twelver Shi'a scholars worldwide, and quoted even today.GHADEER-E-KHUM WHERE THE RELIGION WAS BROUGHT TO PERFECTION By I.H.
