It runs south-west to north-east from Gordon Street to Woburn Place. The south- west end becomes Gower Place after the junction with Gordon Street. Taviton Street and Endsleigh Street run off the south side. Endsleigh Gardens was formerly the south side of Euston Square, which in 1878 was the site of the \"Euston Square Murder\".

In 1877 or 1878, number four Euston Square was the site of a murder that became popularly known as the \"Euston Square Murder\" after the body of Matilda Hacker was found in the coal cellar of the house in 1879. She had last been seen in 1877. Hannah Dobbs, a former servant at the house and mistress of the leaseholder Severin Bastendorff, was arrested after it was found that she had pawned some of Hacker's possessions. In 1879 she was tried for murder at the Old Bailey, but acquitted due to lack of evidence.Unsolved murders of women in Victorian London. Jan Bondeson, The History Press. Retrieved 21 March 2018. ==Renaming== As of 25 September 1879, the Metropolitan Board of Works of London recorded the receipt of a letter from the Vestry of Saint Pancras, asking that the south side of Euston Square be renamed Endsleigh Gardens, and the houses renumbered. The vestry had received the request from George Cubitt, M. P., a freeholder of the south side of Euston Square, along with a petition signed by \"nearly the whole of the leaseholders and occupiers of the houses there\". The vestry meeting had voted in favour, 69 to 3. As of 28 November 1879, a committee reported to the Metropolitan Board of Works in favour of the request, and as of 5 December 1879, the change was moved, seconded and resolved. The reasons for the request are not recorded in the Board of Works' minutes. Some accounts suggest that the name was changed to avoid the notoriety of the Euston Square Murder.\"Home Industries\", Journal of the Royal Society of Arts, Vol. 59, No. 3031 (23 December 1910), pp. 146\u2013148 (p. 148) \"An instance of the name of a place being changed owing to its association with a murder is the case of the Euston- square mystery in the 'seventies.
