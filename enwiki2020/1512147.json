    "text": "Porter Mountain is one of the Adirondack High Peaks. It is number 38 in order of height, and one of the easier hikes of the Adirondack Forty-Sixers. It is named after Noah Porter, one of the first to climb it, later president of Yale University. It is often climbed to with Cascade Mountain. While it lacks the pseudo-alpine open summit of Cascade, there are nevertheless wide views available from the summit, particularly of the Johns Brook Valley to the east (which Porter blocks from Cascade); it is often less crowded than Cascade. A yellow-blazed trail leaves the trail to Cascade about short of that mountain's summit, and leads down into the mountain pass between the two peaks about to Porter's summit. It is also possible to follow this trail from its other terminus, over neighboring Blueberry Mountain from Keene Valley, although that involves a greater vertical ascent and a longer trip. The trailhead to Blueberry Mountain and subsequently Porter Mountain is accessible from a parking lot next to Marcy Airfield on route 73. ==References== ==External links== Category:Mountains of Essex County, New York Category:Adirondack High Peaks Category:Mountains of New York (state) ",
