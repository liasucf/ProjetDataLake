    "text": "Christopher Summers (born 6 January 1972) is a Welsh former professional footballer who played as a forward. He began his career with Cardiff City where he made his professional debut in 1990. After making three further appearances, he was released by the club and joined Inter Cardiff for the inaugural League of Wales season. After spells with Ton Pentre and Barry Town United, he signed for Cwmbr\u00e2n Town. During the 1999\u20132000 season, he won the League of Wales' Golden Boot as the division's top goalscorer with 28 goals. He went on to play for Merthyr Tydfil, Cwmbr\u00e2n again, Carmarthen Town and Haverfordwest County before returning to Cwmbr\u00e2n for a fourth spell in 2002. In his second season, he set a Welsh Premier League record by scoring in eleven consecutive league matches. He briefly played for Cardiff Grange Harlequins in 2005 before dropping into the Welsh Football League with spells at Pontypridd Town, ENTO Aberaman Athletic and Bridgend Town. He scored 177 goals in 243 appearances in the Welsh Premier League which ranks him as the third highest goalscorer in the competition's history. He also represented Wales at semi-professional level. ==Career== Born in Cardiff, Summers represented Wales at youth level. He began his senior career with his hometown side Cardiff City having joined the club on a YTS contract in 1990. He made his professional debut on 3 November 1990 in the Fourth Division as a substitute during a 3\u20130 defeat to Maidstone United. He featured as a substitute on two more occasions during November, once in the league and once in the Associate Members' Cup. However, he fell out of favour and made one further appearance in May 1991 before being released at the end of the season. In 1992, he joined Inter Cardiff for the inaugural League of Wales season. He spent two seasons with the side scoring 46 goals across two seasons. He joined Ton Pentre in 1994, scoring eight goals in eight appearances, before joining Barry Town United where he failed to score in four appearances. After a brief spell with Cwmbr\u00e2n Town in 1996, he returned to the side in 1998 having spent time with Merthyr Tydfil. He scored 21 goals for the club in his first season before winning the League of Wales' Golden Boot award for the league's top goalscorer during the 1999\u20132000 season with 28 goals. He played for Carmarthen Town and Haverfordwest County between 2000 and 2002. He returned to Cwmbr\u00e2n Town for a fourth spell in 2002. During the 2003\u20132004 season, Summers set a new club record for Cwmbr\u00e2n after scoring in six consecutive league matches, achieving the milestone with both goals during a 2\u20130 victory over Newtown. He continued his prolific scoring run and went on to break the Welsh Premier League record previously held by Eifion Williams by scoring in eleven consecutive matches. Having equalled the record by scoring in ten consecutive matches against Aberystwyth Town, he set a new record in his eleventh by scoring against Welshpool Town. His scoring exploits lifted Cwmbr\u00e2n out of the relegation zone, into the top half of the table. Summers later revealed that he had considered quitting football earlier in the season after struggling to maintain his enthusiasm for playing. He commented, \"I wasn't enjoying my football and was on the verge of jacking it all in.\" However, discussions with his wife and Cwmbr\u00e2n manager Brian Coyne prompted him to continue. After a second spell with Carmarthen, Summers dropped out of the Welsh Premier League to join Pontypridd Town but returned at the start of the 2005\u20132006 season to sign for Cardiff Grange Harlequins. Summers enjoyed a strong start to the season, scoring six goals in seven matches and was named the league's player of the month in the opening month. However, the club soon encountered financial difficulties and Summers returned to Pontypridd in November 2005. His tally of 177 goals in the Welsh Premier League ranks him as the third highest scorer in the competition's history, behind Marc Lloyd-Williams and Rhys Griffiths. With Pontypridd, he helped the club gain promotion to Division One. When Pontypridd suffered financial difficulties of their own in 2007, Summers moved to ENTO Aberaman Athletic. He later played for Bridgend Town before returning to Pontypridd in 2012. ==Personal life== Alongside playing football, Summers works as a fireman in Caerphilly. ==Honours== * League of Wales Golden Boot winner: 1999\u20132000 ==References== Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Welsh footballers Category:Footballers from Cardiff Category:Cardiff City F.C. players Category:Cardiff Metropolitan University F.C. players Category:Ton Pentre F.C. players Category:Barry Town United F.C. players Category:Cwmbr\u00e2n Town A.F.C. players Category:Carmarthen Town A.F.C. players Category:Haverfordwest County A.F.C. players Category:Pontypridd Town A.F.C. players Category:Aberdare Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Cymru Premier players Category:Association football forwards ",
