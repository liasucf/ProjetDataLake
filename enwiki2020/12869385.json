Although operating principally in that archipelago, the ship on occasion, voyaged to Borneo, Morotai, and Manus. ===Heading home for decommissioning=== Ultimately, Beaverhead sailed for home on 5 December. She transited the Panama Canal on 19 January 1946 and arrived in New York 11 days later. She moved to Norfolk, Virginia, during the second week in February and was decommissioned there on 8 March 1946.
