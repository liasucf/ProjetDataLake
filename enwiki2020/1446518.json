DeKoven St. As this view suggests, the neighborhood was congested with mean wooden buildings and a variety of industry, a condition which helped to spread the fire of 1871 as rapidly as it did. A strong wind blowing towards the northeast spared the O'Leary cottage and the buildings seen here to its west. From a stereoptican view by A.H. Abbott, Photographer, whose studio at 976 (now 2201) N. Clark Street was consumed by the flames. DeKoven Street is a street in Chicago, Illinois named for John DeKoven, one of the founders of the Northern Trust Company. ==History== The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 started in the barn behind the cottage of Patrick and Catherine O'Leary at 137 (after 1909, 558) DeKoven Street. Although the popular story is that a cow kicked over a lantern to start the fire, Michael Ahern, the Chicago Republican reporter who created the cow story, admitted in 1893 that he had made it up because he thought it would make colorful copy. At the time, the street was in a less prosperous neighborhood of Chicago. The site is now occupied by the Chicago Fire academy, near the intersection of Roosevelt Road and Canal Street, just southwest of the Loop. The address of the academy \"...by design is the same as that where legend has it that Mrs. Mollie (sic) O'Leary's cow kicked over the lantern that started the Great Chicago Fire.\" ===Landmark=== The site is a designated landmark of the City of Chicago. ==References== ==External links== * http://www.chipublib.org/cplbooksmovies/cplarchive/chidisasters/greatfire.php Category:Streets in Chicago ",
