The other main villages were settled shortly thereafter (between 1802 and 1806). In the early 1900s, the royal court advanced funds to build a horse-drawn carriage road from Biysk south through the district to Mongolia; this road became the Chuysky Highway. Altai District was formally founded on May 27, 1924. ==Economy== The district's economy centers on agriculture, primarily livestock and the related forage crops. The flat plains of the district support grain and sunflower crops, and there is a fish-cultivation center. In recent years, tourism has become more of a focus, with over 10,000 visitors in recent summers drawn by the summer camps and a new tourist-recreational area called \"Turquoise Katun\". ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * Category:Districts of Altai Krai ",
