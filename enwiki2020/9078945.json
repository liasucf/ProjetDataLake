The name of the flower derives from the Greek \u1f00- a- (\"not\") and \u03bb\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 lyssa (\"mania\"); the flower was formerly thought to cure skin diseases. It shares many variants in common with the name Alice and is occasionally considered a form of that name as well. It has been a popular name in the United States, where it ranked as the 19th most popular name given to baby girls born in 2009, having ranked among the top 100 names for girls since 1986 and among the top 20 names since 1997.
