    "text": "Don Jeffrey \"Jeff\" Meldrum (born May 24, 1958) is a Professor of Anatomy and Anthropology and a Professor of the Department of Anthropology at Idaho State University. Meldrum is also Adjunct Professor of Occupational and Physical Therapy. Meldrum is an expert on foot morphology and locomotion in primates. ==Biography== Meldrum received his B.S. in zoology specializing in vertebrate locomotion at Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1982, his M.S. at BYU in 1984 and a Ph.D. in anatomical sciences, with an emphasis in biological anthropology, from Stony Brook University in 1989 (then referred to as State University of New York at Stony Brook). He held the position of postdoctoral visiting assistant professor at Duke University Medical Center from 1989 to 1991. Meldrum worked at Northwestern University's Department of Cell, Molecular and Structural Biology for a short while in 1993 before joining the faculty of Idaho State University where he currently teaches. Meldrum has published numerous academic papers ranging from vertebrate evolutionary morphology, the emergence of bipedal locomotion in modern humans and Sasquatch (Bigfoot) and is a co-editor of a series of books on paleontology. Meldrum also co-edited From Biped to Strider: The Emergence of Modern Human Walking with Charles E. Hilton. Meldrum, who is an \"active member\" of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has also studied and commented upon issues of genetics and the Book of Mormon in his book \"Who Are the Children of Lehi?\", written with Trent D. Stephens. ==Cryptozoology== Meldrum has attracted media attention due to his interest in Bigfoot. Meldrum believes that Bigfoot exists and his research on the topic has been criticized as pseudoscientific.\"Idaho professor\u2019s Bigfoot research criticized\". The Seattle Times. Meldrum authored Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science in 2006. The book was heavily criticized in a detailed review in the Skeptical Inquirer. Anthropologist David J. Daegling commented that author was \"unable or unwilling to distinguish good research from bad, science from pseudoscience\" and the book failed to provide a thorough scientific analysis. Matt Cartmill reviewed the book in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology. Meldrum was present at a 2011 conference in Siberia regarding the Siberian Snowman, which included among other things investigating alleged footprints that had been spotted in a Kemerovo cave. He acknowledged that the results of the Russian field trip to the cave site were most likely fraudulent. He suggested that the supposed evidence found was simply an attempt by local government officials to drum up publicity. ==References== ==External links== * Meldrum's Idaho State University profile * Meldrum's ResearchGate profile Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:American anthropologists Category:American Latter Day Saints Category:Bigfoot Category:Brigham Young University alumni Category:Cryptozoologists Category:Duke University faculty Category:Idaho State University faculty Category:Stony Brook University alumni ",
