Osborn went on to hold a Fulbright Fellowship to Iceland, 1978\u201379 and 1983-84. Arising from this work in Scotland and Iceland, Osborn and her collaborator, Gillian Overing, pioneered the application of place study to early medieval literary studies in their book Landscape of Desire (1994), which was dismissed or ignored by some scholars at the time, but is now recognised as pioneering ecocriticsm. Osborn's translation of Beowulf, published as a Verse Translation with Treasures of the Ancient North (1983), brought together material culture from across northern Europe to 'help us visualise the world of the poem'. Osborn is well known for her work on medieval work in translation, especially the Old English poem Beowulf. In 2003, the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies published Marijane Osborn's annotated list of over 300 translations and adaptations.
