    "text": "Lajos Drahos (7 March 1895 \u2013 2 June 1983) was a Hungarian Communist politician, who served as Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary between 1949 and 1951. He was the ambassador to Poland from May 1951 to his retirement (1955). He was totally unsuitable (locksmith) for his function, because he did not speak any languages, and he was unprepared and inexperienced in diplomacy.
