    "text": "Ridgewood is a historic apartment building located at 1703\u20131713 Ridge Avenue (at Church Street) in Evanston, Illinois. The Chicago architectural firm of Atchison & Edbrooke designed the building in 1905; while the firm was only active from 1904 to 1908, it designed several buildings in Evanston. The building has a Prairie School design, a popular residential style at the time that was nonetheless unusual for an apartment complex. The three-story brick building is shaped in a \"U\" and features half-octagonal bays at regular intervals. Six apartments are on each floor; each features Prairie woodwork, cabinets built into the walls, and a fireplace. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 4, 1978. ==References== Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Prairie School architecture in Illinois Category:Residential buildings completed in 1905 Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Cook County, Illinois Category:Buildings and structures in Evanston, Illinois Category:1905 establishments in Illinois ",
