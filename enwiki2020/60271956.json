    "text": "The ION CubeSat Carrier is a free flying CubeSat deployer and technology demonstrator, developed by Italian company D-Orbit. It is scheduled to be launched on Vega flight VV16 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana in 2020. The CubeSat carrier will host multiple CubeSats to be deployed once in orbit. == Mission overview == The carrier will deploy the CubeSats one by one using a spring release mechanism once positioned in a sun-synchronous orbit at 500 km. The 60 cm cubic dispenser allows for several combinations of 1U, 2U, 3U, 3U+, 6U, 6U+, 12U and 12U+ Cubesats along the vertical axis. After completion of the up to one month long deployment phase, ION CubeSat Carrier will initiate a validation phase of its payloads directly integrated on the platform. == Frequency violation == The onboard telemetry transmitter operates at 437.515 MHz which is a frequency within a Amateur Radio band without being an Amateur Radio payload or service.https://twitter.com/ppapadeas/status/1304068013495332865 ==See also== *NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer *Planned Vega launches ==References== ==External links== *InOrbit NOW *D-Orbit Category:2020 in spaceflight ",
