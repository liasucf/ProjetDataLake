Later, he was President of the National Commission for the Fight Against Corruption from 2007 to 2012. ==Political career== Nzoungou was a member of the Kongo ethnic group and a native of Boko, located in the Pool Department.Cheikh Y\u00e9rim Seck, \"L'adieu aux armes s'\u00e9ternise\", Jeune Afrique, 29 March 2004 . As of 1973, he was working at the Ministry of Labour and Justice as Administrator of Labour Services as well as Technical Adviser and Head of the Planning Department.Human Resources and Development Planning in Africa: Proceedings of an Expert Group Meeting (1973), OECD Development Centre, page 29. He was first appointed to the government as Minister of Justice, in charge of Administrative Reforms, on 13 August 1989.R\u00e9my Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo: essai de sociologie historique (1997), Karthala Editions, page 297 .Gaston-Jonas Kouvibidila, Histoire du multipartisme au Congo-Brazzaville: La marche \u00e0 rebours, 1940-1991 (2000), L'Harmattan, pages 126-127 . Nzoungou was also a member of the Central Committee of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT).Patrick Quantin, \"Congo: Transition d\u00e9mocratique et conjoncture critique\", in Transitions d\u00e9mocratiques africaines: dynamiques et contraintes (1990-1994) (1997), eds. Jean-Pascal Daloz and Patrick Quantin, Karthala Editions, page 157 . Amidst the introduction of multiparty politics, he was retained as Minister of Justice in the government appointed on 14 January 1991.Kouvibidila, La marche \u00e0 rebours, page 247 . The National Conference, which was held from February 1991 to June 1991, initiated a transition to multiparty elections, establishing a transitional government headed by Prime Minister Andr\u00e9 Milongo. Nzoungou was not initially included in the transitional government, but Milongo later appointed him as Minister of the Interior and Relations with the Higher Council of the Republic (CSR), on 21 May 1992, shortly before a parliamentary election and a presidential election were scheduled to be held.Jeune Afrique, number 2,444 (1992), page 9 .Gaston- Jonas Kouvibidila, Histoire du multipartisme au Congo-Brazzaville: Les d\u00e9buts d'une crise attendue, 1992-1993 (2000), L'Harmattan, page 66 . The first round of the parliamentary election was held on 24 June 1992. The PCT, which performed poorly, called for the results to be annulled due to problems in the election, but Nzoungou did not accede to that demand. As Minister of the Interior, he announced the results of the second round of the parliamentary election on 23 July 1992.Kouvibidila, Les d\u00e9buts d'une crise attendue, page 129 . In August 1992, following the second round of the presidential election, Nzoungou announced that Pascal Lissouba had prevailed over Bernard Kol\u00e9las, receiving 61% of the vote.\"Ex-Prime Minister Wins Congo Presidential Election\", Jet, 19 October 1992, volume 82, number 26, page 9. After taking office as President, Lissouba retained Nzoungou in the government as Minister of Labour, Employment, and the Management of Human Resources on 6 September 1992.Africa Research Bulletin: Political Series, volumes 28-29 (1992), page 10,707 .West Africa (1992), page 1,632. That government was short-lived, surviving only a few months before being brought down by its lack of parliamentary support.Joachim Emmanuel Goma-Thethet, \"Alliances in the political and electoral process in the Republic of Congo 1991\u201397\", in Liberal Democracy and Its Critics in Africa: Political Dysfunction and the Struggle for Social Progress (2005), ed. Tukumbi Lumumba-Kasongo, Zed Books, pages 110-114. Later, Nzoungou was Secretary-General of the Government, with the rank of Minister, as of June 1997.\"Minutes of the 269th Session\", International Labour Office, June 1997. Considered a \"neutral and respected figure\", Nzoungou was assigned to lead a working group in February 2004 as part of the implementation of a peace agreement between the government and the Pool-based rebel group led by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bintsamou. The purpose of the working group headed by Nzoungou was to \"define the status of the rebel leader\". Later, Nzoungou was appointed as President of the National Commission of the Fight Against Corruption,\"Les membres de la Commission nationale de lutte contre la corruption, la concussion et la fraude ont pr\u00eat\u00e9 serment au palais de justice de Brazzaville\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 10 November 2007 . a body tasked with the implementation of government anti-corruption policies,Rock Ngassakys, \"La Commission nationale de lutte contre la corruption, la concussion et la fraude tient sa cinqui\u00e8me assembl\u00e9e pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 25 April 2009 . on 29 August 2007. The 16 members of the Commission were sworn in at a ceremony in Brazzaville on 9 November 2007. On 9 December 2007, in a statement to mark the International Anti- Corruption Day, Nzoungou called for the Congolese people to battle corruption; echoing the words of President Denis Sassou Nguesso, he stressed that corruption was an obstacle to development.Faustin Akono, \"Le pr\u00e9sident de la Commission nationale de lutte contre la corruption, Alphonse Nzoungou : \u00ab Combattons tous la corruption parce qu'elle freine le d\u00e9veloppement socio- \u00e9conomique \u00bb\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 11 December 2007 . Nzoungou remained in his post as President of the National Commission for the Fight Against Corruption until he died in Paris on 7 September 2012; he was 74 years old. ==References== Category:2012 deaths Category:Government ministers of the Republic of the Congo Category:Congolese Party of Labour politicians Category:1930s births ",
