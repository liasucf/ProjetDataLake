    "text": "Bernard (died 1148) was the first Norman Bishop of St David's (1115\u20131148). Originally an erudite layman, serving as Chancellor to Queen Matilda,P. Dalton, C. Insley and L. J. Wilkinson, Cathedrals, Communities and Conflict in the Anglo-Norman World (Boydell, 2011), p.105 he was abruptly appointed the Bishop of St. David's on 18 September 1115, when King Henry I (Matilda's husband) summoned the chapter of St. David's to London, and persuaded them to choose Bernard as next Bishop (the previous Bishop having died that year).Dictionary of Welsh Biography, John Edward Lloyd, London, 1959, entry for Bernard (died 1148), bishop of S. Davids Immediately, Bernard was sent to the Church of St. Mary Overie and made a priest, that same day; the following day he was made a Bishop, in Westminster Abbey. At that time, the lands of the Bishop were a quasi-sovereign territory,Francis Jones, The Lordship and Manors of Dewsland in Journal of the Historical Society of the Church in Wales, Volume 16, page 15 a status confirmed that year by Henry I when Bernard, after acknowledging Henry as suzerain of the Bishop's realm, was given a charter by the king which designated the lands - Dewisland - as a Marcher Lordship.Judgement in Crown Estate Commissioners v (1) Mark Andrew Tudor Roberts (2) Trelleck Estate Ltd: ChD (Mr Justice Lewison), 13 June 2008 Bernard was thus the head of the Judicial system in Dewisland, could mint coinage, levy tax, raise an army, and declare war on other Marcher Lords, without falling foul of the king. Furthermore, Bernard disputed the authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury over him, arguing that he himself was the metropolitan of Wales; he was the last bishop to dispute the primacy of the see of Canterbury. Bernard founded Whitland Abbey.Burton Monastic and Religious Orders p. 229 ==Notes== ==References== * Category:Bishops of St David's Category:12th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:1148 deaths ",
