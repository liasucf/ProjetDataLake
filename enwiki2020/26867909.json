    "text": "\"You and Your Heart\" is a song by Hawaiian singer-songwriter Jack Johnson and is the lead single from his fifth studio album, To the Sea. The song was released to radio in early April 2010, and was released via download on April 6. In Canada, the song premiered on CKOI-FM in Montreal on April 1, 2010. ==Background and song meaning== Johnson told MTV News in regards to the inspiration of You and Your Heart, \"[That song] started off with this guitar riff that I had around for a while, actually had it on the last record, and we liked it, but we didn't have any words for it yet, nothing came natural, so I didn't use it. And at some point, some of the books I was reading started leading me in a certain direction, kind of like this broken king character. That area you get in sometimes, where you stop trusting your heart and you start thinking too much about logic and this and that. So it's basically about that separation that can happen between the self and the heart and trying to trust your heart again.\"You and Your Heart Song Facts (accessed May 29, 2014) ==Reception== Sara D. Anderson of AOL called the song \"another breezy, rhythm guitar-driven hit\" for Johnson, and noted that \"the chorus is no different to other Johnson tracks, but the catchy guitar melody\u2014prominent in the track's intro\u2014is slightly more upbeat\". In April 2010, the single entered the Billboard Rock Songs chart. A week later, the song debuted at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100, his highest-peaking single to date. It has since re-entered at #99 and climb to #65, due to digital increase, after the album release. But like with most of his singles, it reached No. 1 on the Triple A chart.
