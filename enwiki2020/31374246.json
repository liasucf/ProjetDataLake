    "text": "The parable of the arrow (or 'Parable of the poisoned arrow') is a Buddhist parable that illustrates the skeptic and pragmatic themes of the C\u016b\u1e37am\u0101lukya Sutta (The Shorter Instructions to M\u0101lukya) which is part of the middle length discourses (Majjhima Nikaya), one of the five sections of the Sutta Pitaka. The P\u0101li text contains a number of hapax legomena or otherwise obscure archery terms and these are generally poorly dealt with in English translations. ==Narrative== The sutta begins at Jetavana where the monk Malunkyaputta is troubled by Gautama Buddha's silence on the fourteen unanswerable questions, which include queries about the nature of the cosmos and life after the death of a Buddha. Malunkyaputta then meets with Gautama Buddha and asks him for the answers to these questions, he says that if he fails to respond, Malunkya will renounce his teachings. Gautama responds by first stating that he never promised to reveal ultimate metaphysical truths such as those and then uses the story of a man who has been shot with a poisoned arrow to illustrate that those questions are irrelevant to his teachings. ==Commentary== Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh comments on the way the parable of the poisoned arrow illustrates Gautama Buddha's anti-metaphysical views: Sangharakshita notes that \"The important thing is to get rid of the arrow, not to enquire where it came from.\" The parable is considered a teaching on being practical and dealing with the situation at hand.} ==Chinese sources== The story is also preserved in two Chinese translations of Prakrit sources. * \u7bad\u55bb\u7d93 Ji\u00e0n y\u00f9 j\u012bng (Arrow Metaphor S\u016btra), T 1.26 (p0804a21), \uff08\u4e8c\u4e8c\u4e00\uff09\u4e2d\u963f\u542b\u4f8b\u54c1 (\u00c8r \u00e8r y\u012b) Zh\u014dng \u0101 h\u00e1n, L\u00ec p\u01d0n. Madhy\u0101gama 221, Chapter on Examples. Translated from an Indic language (possibly G\u0101nd\u0101r\u012b) into Chinese by a Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Tripi\u1e6daka master, Gautama Sa\u1e45ghadeva, from Kashmir in the Eastern Jin Dynasty ca. Dec 397 \u2013 Jan 398 CE. * \u4f5b\u8aaa\u7bad\u55bb\u7d93 F\u00fa shu\u014d ji\u00e0n y\u00f9 j\u012bngThe Buddha\u2019s Talk on the Arrow Metaphor S\u016btra) T 1.94 (p.0917c21). Translator unknown, dated only to the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317\u2013420 CE) Each of these uses different translation strategies. T 1.26 transposes the various archery terms into items and materials familiar to a Chinese audience; while T 1.94 uses transliterated Indic terms that do not match the P\u0101li in most cases. Thus the obscure P\u0101li terms remain largely obscure for now. A third Chinese text, Mah\u0101praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101upade\u015ba (T 1509 at T XXV 170a8-b1) contains a paraphrase of this text. ==References== ==External links== *Parable at Buddhanet Category:Majjhima Nikaya Category:Parables Category:Buddhist philosophical concepts Category:Theravada Buddhist texts Category:Pali Buddhist texts ",
