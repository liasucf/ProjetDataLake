He studied medicine at Columbia University, and botany under John Torrey, Asa Gray and George Engelmann. He moved to Davenport, Iowa in 1846 where he practiced as a doctor for a short time before joining the United States and Mexican Boundary Survey (1848-1855) as surgeon and botanist. He made extensive plant collections along the U.S.-Mexico border in California, and later in Colorado, Utah and other western states, many of which proved to be new species. Important plants he discovered include the Torrey pine and Engelmann spruce, which he named in honour of his mentors. Several plants are also named after him, including the Parry Pinyon, Parry's Lily and Parry's Penstemon. In addition, the genera Neoparrya and Parryella were named in his honor.Mathias, Mildred E. 1929. Studies in the Umbelliferae II. Ann. Mo. Bot. Gard. 16:393-394, Plate 33.Gray, Asa. 1868.

Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 7: 397. 1868 Parry made the first barometric measurements of the heights of many of Colorado's mountains. Although he did not reach the summit, he estimated the height of Longs Peak, and he was the first to climb and measure Grays Peak. Parry Peak (4,082 m / 13,391 feet) in Colorado is also named after him.W. H. Brewer, Explorations in the Rocky Mountains and the High Peaks of Colorado, Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York, Vol 3 (1872); pages 193-215. His archive is held at Iowa State University. ==References== ==External links== *Iowa State University: Parry archives *Charles Christopher Parry Digital Collection *Eastern Sierra Native Plants biography *Charles Christopher Parry - King of Colorado Botany ( University Press of Colorado) *Torrey Pines Reserve bio *Parry Peak Category:English botanists Category:English taxonomists Category:1823 births Category:1890 deaths Category:Botanists active in North America Category:Botanists with author abbreviations Category:American mountain climbers Category:English mountain climbers Category:Union College (New York) alumni Category:English emigrants to the United States Category:People from Gloucestershire Category:Sportspeople from Gloucestershire Category:19th-century American botanists Category:19th-century British botanists Category:Scientists from New York (state) ",
