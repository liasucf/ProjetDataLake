    "text": "The Lauderdale Road Spanish & Portuguese Synagogue is a religious building close to Maida Vale (Lauderdale Road) in the West End of London. Like other Sephardi synagogues in London and Manchester, it maintains close links with the \u2018mother\u2019 congregation and some accept its ecclesiastical authority. Lauderdale Road Synagogue was opened in 1896 to accommodate the drift of Spanish and Portuguese members from Bevis Marks to West London (it was a successor to the Sephardi synagogue in Bryanston Street, near Marble Arch). The Congregation's senior rabbi today is Rabbi Joseph Dweck who also usually attends Lauderdale Road Synagogue. ==Architecture== The synagogue building itself was constructed in the Byzantine style by architects Davis & Emanuel. It has a large domed ceiling, huge stained glass windows set in arched recesses, tapestry carpets across the polished wooden floors, as well as a large ark. ==References== Category:Synagogues in London Category:Portuguese diaspora in the United Kingdom Category:Sephardi Jewish culture in the United Kingdom Category:Sephardi synagogues Category:Orthodox synagogues in England Category:Spanish diaspora in Europe Category:Portuguese-Jewish diaspora Category:Spanish-Jewish diaspora ",
