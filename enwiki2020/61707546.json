    "text": "Croatia originally planned to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020. The Croatian broadcaster Hrvatska radiotelevizija (HRT) used the national selection Dora 2020 to decide their representative. However, due to 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the contest was cancelled. ==Background== Prior to the 2020 Contest, Croatia had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest twenty- five times since its first entry in . Croatia's highest placing in the contest, to this point, has been fourth place, which the nation achieved on two occasions: in 1996 with the song \"Sveta ljubav\" performed by Maja Blagdan and in 1999 \"Marija Magdalena\" performed by Doris Dragovi\u0107. Following the introduction of semi-finals for the 2004 contest, Croatia had featured in seven finals. In 2019, Croatia failed to qualify to the final, placing 14th in the second semi-final with the song \"The Dream\" performed by Roko. ==Before Eurovision== ===Dora 2020=== Dora 2020 was the twenty-first edition of the Croatian national selection Dora, which selected Croatia's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2020. The competition consisted of up to 16 entries competing in one final. ====Format==== The combination of points from a viewer vote and ten regional jury groups determined the winner. According to the competition rules, in the event of a tie for the first place, the winner was the entrant ranked highest by the public televote. ====Competing entries==== Artists and composers were able to submit their entries to the broadcaster between 5 November and 15 December 2019. An expert committee selected sixteen artists and songs for the competition from the received submissions. The list of competing artists and songs were released on 23 December 2019. Shortly after the list was released, Goran Karan withdrew from the competition. As a result of this, Elis Lovri\u0107 and her song \"Ju\u0161to\" participated in the national selection instead. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\" |- ! Artist !

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 28 January 2020, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Croatia was placed into the first semi-final, to be held on 12 May 2020, and was scheduled to perform in the second half of the show. However, due to 2019-20 pandemic of Coronavirus, the contest was cancelled. ==References== ==External links== * Eurovision Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 Category:Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest ",
