Founded in 1964 as the team of the Gala\u021bi steel works, O\u021belul spent the first two decades of their history in the lower leagues. They reached Liga I for the first time in 1986 and have spent a total of twenty-seven seasons playing in the top flight, while also securing several seasons of European football. O\u021belul won the league title at the end of the 2010\u201311 campaign, becoming the first and only Romanian champion from the region of Moldavia to date; this triumph was accompanied by winning the 2011 Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei. Their best result in the Romanian Cup is reaching the 2004 final. Internationally, O\u021belul's best performances are qualifying for the group stages of the 2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League, and being one of the eleven co-winners of the 2007 UEFA Intertoto Cup. O\u021belarii's team colors are red, white and blue, and they play at the Stadionul O\u021belul. ==History== ===Early years of football in Gala\u021bi (1910\u20131964)=== Football spread to Romania shortly before 1900, appearing in the cities of Arad and Bucharest. It arrived in Gala\u021bi about 10 years later, through foreign trade companies and offices in the city, and the efforts of Officer Vladovici, a career soldier who had studied in France and brought football game regulations and equipment to Gala\u021bi. The first games took place , when Vladovici's team from the 3rd Artillery Regiment played groups of English sailors stationed in the harbor. A year later, the Cavalry Regiment of Gala\u021bi established a second team in the city. This led to the organization of several football matches, and the press highlighted the fact that matches were also possible with the sailors from British naval ships present in the Port of Gala\u021bi. The students of Vasile Alecsandri High School (LVA) formed a team in 1919. A year later, emigrants from Turkey, Greece or Armenia set up (with support of the bourgeoisie) the teams of Olimpia and Niki, consisting largely of players coming from Italy, Greece and Turkey, where football was much more developed as a sport. A benchmark match took place on 7 May 1921, in an exhibition game (\"sports propaganda\"), when Triumf Bucure\u0219ti defeated Interna\u021bionala Gala\u021bi (a temporary team of foreign players established in Gala\u021bi) 2\u20131. In the same year, the team of HMS Ladybird defeated Interna\u021bionala Gala\u021bi 6\u20132. Though there were too few teams for organized competitions, inter-city matches intensified with Br\u0103ila, Tulcea, and Reni. There were also continuing matches with local teams Interna\u021bionala, Niki, Olimpia, \u015eoimii Dacia, Atlas and LVA, as well as military teams. Chart of O\u021belul's yearly table positions in the Romanian Football League from 1966 to the present In 1922, Dacia Soimii and LVA merged to found Dacia Vasile Alecsandri Gala\u021bi (DVA), a team that gained great popularity and for two decades was considered among the most powerful football clubs in the southern Moldavia and eastern Muntenia. Other new teams included Macabi, Avia\u0163ia, \u015ecoala Comercial\u0103, Sportul, and Baza Naval\u0103. The new teams and increasing popularity allowed different competitions to emerge, and championships took place at the town and district level. Club structures grew with teams of seniors, reserves, youths and children. The Greek bourgeoisie teams of Ermis, Acropolis, and Foresta were created. In 1926, the first district championship took place. There were ten teams from Gala\u021bi (including the neighborhood teams \u015eoimii and Gloria), two from Reni (Macabi and Dun\u0103rea) and one team representing Tulcea. The competition was a commercial success with DVA the first champions. In the next round DVA defeated Concordia Ia\u0219i 6\u20131 and advanced to a final tournament for the national trophy. Ten teams took part, among them Chinezul Timi\u0219oara, Unirea Tricolor Bucure\u0219ti, Col\u021bea Bra\u0219ov and AMEFA Arad. Lacking experience at this level of competition, DVA lost to Brasov 1\u20137. Because at that time military teams were in fashion, Captain Sl\u0103tineanu transferred from Bra\u015fov the team of Fulgerul. However, due to financial difficulties, Fulgerul had a short life. 1920s regulations did not allow the team to participate in the district championships. Instead, it took part in a series of international matches and competitions. This allowed the new Gala\u021bi team to gain experience playing the powerful teams MTK Budapest, Vasas, \u00dajpest, OFK Beograd, \u017dAK Subotica and Rapid Wien. These matches were played with the ticket office closed. In the late 1920s, economic hardships (affected by the economic crisis) led to the dissolution of most of the 20 clubs that had existed. At one time only three clubs took part in the district championship: DVA, Gloria, and \u0218oimii. In 1927, these latter two clubs, which had been founded as neighbourhood teams in Gala\u021bi, merged as Gloria \u015eoimii. In 1932, at the initiative of the railroad workers, Gloria \u015eoimii and CFR Gala\u021bi (the Gala\u021bi railway football club) merged as Gloria CFR Gala\u021bi. Gloria CFR immediately joined the Lower Danube District Championship, alongside teams already experienced in official competitions such as: DVA, Ermis, Marina Danubian\u0103 and Unirea Tulcea. Gradually the team progressed and in the 1934\u201335 season became the champion of the Lower Danube District, then immediately promoted to Divizia C. A year later it was promoted to Divizia B. This promotion was possible after three promotion play-offs (in Bucharest, Gala\u021bi, and Constan\u0163a) against Telefon Club Bucure\u0219ti, but also due to the Romanian Football Federation which recognized the value of the team. In the 1937\u201338 season, \"the Railroad Workers\" had a spectacular performance of 16 wins, a draw and a single defeat, and were promoted to Divizia A. In 1937, the club Metalosport Gala\u021bi was formed in the city and had important results in the second and third leagues. The championship schedule was interrupted by World War II and restarted in 1946. Gala\u021bi was then represented by Gloria CFR in Divizia B, while Metalosport, \u015eantierul Naval and FC Arsenal were in the Divizia C. In the early 1950s, DVA was dissolved due to financial problems and Gloria CFR was relegated to Divizia C. The club Dinamo Gala\u021bi (later renamed Siderurgistul Gala\u021bi) was formed in 1955 and came very close to promotion to the country's premiere league in 1961 and 1962. Constructorul Gala\u021bi was founded in 1950, and reached the Cupa Rom\u00e2niei final in 1973. Siderurgistul was promoted in 1963 and in spite of oscillating results it was the best team of the town until the mid-1960s. ===O\u021belul, founding and ascension (1964\u20131985)=== In 1964, following the reorganization of football in Gala\u021bi, the club O\u021belul was formed to represent the newly established Gala\u021bi steel works. After three seasons in Divizia D, O\u021belul was promoted to Divizia C at the end of the 1966\u201367 season and to Divizia B after another season. The 1968 promotion was in a close contest with Gloria B\u00e2rlad; both teams ended the season with 35 points, but O\u021belul had a +23 goal differential to Gloria's +21. O\u021belul's 1968 promotion squad included: \u015eerb\u0103noiu, Berechet, Rusu, Florea\u2013Boeru, Coman, Sec\u0103\u015feanu, Luban, Halmagy, Mo\u015fneagu, Cernega, Bru\u015ftiuc, Niculescu, Morohai, Leca, Ion Ionic\u0103, Ailoaiei, Obreja, C\u00e2mpeanu, Dr\u0103ghiescu and Ogescu; with coaches Gh. Dr\u0103ghiescu and Pompiliu Ionescu. The rise of O\u021belul led to the decline of Siderurgistul, which had been the city's primary team and had played the 1963 Cupa Rom\u00e2niei final. In 1967, Siderurgistul gave up its place in the second league to Politehnica Gala\u021bi and disappeared from Romanian football. After O\u0163elul completed two seasons in the second league, reaching 9th place in both 1968\u201369 and 1969\u201370, there was another reorganization of local football and O\u0163elul changed its name to FC Gala\u021bi and later to FCM Gala\u021bi, essentially forming a new club, known later mainly as Dun\u0103rea Gala\u021bi. Between 1974 and 1980, this team achieved three seasons in Divizia A. Meanwhile, some of the players of the former O\u021belul transferred to Divizia C club Dacia Gala\u021bi, which in 1972 revived the name O\u021belul. O\u021belul Gala\u021bi (1985\u201386) and the celebration of promotion O\u021belul had not completely lost its identity after this maneuver and in the 1973\u201374 season returned to the second league, finishing 7th. However, the team finished the 1974\u201375 season in 17th place with only 24 points and was relegated to Divizia C, then disbanded. In 1976, the management of the steel industry decided to re- establish O\u021belul, joining the county championship (Divizia D), and climbing to Divizia C and B. From 1976 to 1977 to 1980\u201381, their rankings were: 1st (Divizia D); 11th, 10th, 9th, and 1st (Divizia C). The 1980\u201381 squad of O\u021belul included: \u0218erb\u0103noiu, C\u0103lug\u0103ru, Cucu, Bor\u0219, C\u0103st\u0103ian, Morohai, Ceacu, Ciurea, P\u0103tra\u0219cu, Pavel, Gheorghiu, Adamache, Ion Ionic\u0103, Basal\u00eec, Ticu, Potorac, and Pode\u021b; with coach Petru Mo\u021boc. The progress and growth of O\u021belul was more difficult than that of traditional Romanian football clubs, due to the 1970 dissolution of the club in favor of Dun\u0103rea Gala\u021bi, the 1972 reformation of Dacia Gala\u021bi and the 1975 refounding. In 1980, immediately after the promotion of the team in the second league, a political decision of Gala\u021bi County gave its place to Victoria Tecuci, some of the players reaching the team from Tecuci and the others signing with Divizia C side Metalosport Gala\u021bi, owned by the Cristea Nicolae factory. However, in the summer of 1982, there was a turnabout when Metalosport was sacrificed for O\u021belul, allowing O\u021belul to reach for prominence after years of being held back. O\u021belul took advantage of this political trust and finished third in the 1982\u201383 season, eighth in 1983\u201384 and third in 1984\u201385 \u2013 after Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti and local rival Dun\u0103rea Gala\u021bi. O\u021belul finished this last season with a 24\u20134\u20136 record, and 86 goals scored with 29 conceded, and were promoted to Divizia A. The squad that obtained that performance included: C\u0103lug\u0103ru, Ionel Dinu, Gh. Stamate, Oprea, Ciobanu, Popescu, Stoica, Radu, Ciurea, Burcea, Smadu, M. Stan, A.Stamate, Petrescu, Basalic, Rusu, Vai\u015fcovici, Antohi, Bejenaru, Dumitru, Rotaru, Lala, Anghelinei, C. Stan, and Ralea; with coaches Costic\u0103 R\u0103dulescu and Ioan Sdrobi\u015f. ===Divizia A and UEFA Cup first seasons (1986\u20131999)=== Juventus, a year later In its first year in the top stage of Romanian football, O\u0163elul finished at 11th place, climbing to 4th place the following season which qualified the club for the European Cup tournament in the 1988\u201389 UEFA Cup season. In the first match, before 30,000 supporters, O\u021belul beat Italian side Juventus 1\u20130, the goal scored by Ion Profir from penalty. The team lost the second match to G\u0103l\u0103\u021benii, 5\u20130. The squad that played against Juventus in the first European match of the club included: C\u0103lug\u0103ru \u2013 G. Popescu, Anghelinei, Agiu, Borali (Adrian Oprea) \u2013 Nae Burcea, Marius Stan, I. Profir, Oct. Popescu \u2013 Ralea (Dr\u0103goi), Puiu Antohi. For Juventus: Stefano Tacconi, Nicol\u00f2 Napoli, Alessandro Altobelli, Rui Barros and Michael Laudrup all played; with coaches Dino Zoff and Cornel Dinu. At the end of the regular season, O\u0163elul was relegated. The club finished third in 1989\u201390 Divizia B and missed promotion against rival Progresul Br\u0103ila. In the 1990\u201391 season, Under the management of Marius Stan and Mihai Stoica, the club was promoted with an advance of 6 points in front of Gloria Buz\u0103u. \"The Steelworkers\" remained in the top division until 2015. Following O\u021belul's 1991 promotion, the club finished in the middle of the league: 8th in 1991\u201392 and 10th in 1992\u201393. The club participated in the 1991\u201392 Balkans Cup where it lost the final 0\u20131 on aggregate against Turkish side Sar\u0131yer. O\u021belul had a last-minute rescue from relegation in the 1993\u201394 season, which it finished one point above the relegation line. The team coach was replaced with Vasile Simiona\u0219, former star of Politehnica Ia\u0219i, and after two seasons finished at 13th place. At the end of the 1995\u201396 season, the club lost star players Radu Ca\u0219uba and Valentin \u015etefan, but maintained a foundation moving forward with players such as: Iulian Arhire, Stelian Bordieanu, Gheorghe Bos\u00e2nceanu, Gheorghe Cornea, Daniel Florea, Sorin Haraga, Gigi Ion, Viorel Ion, Costin Male\u0219, D\u0103nu\u021b Oprea, Tudorel Pelin, Emil Spirea, Adrian State, Viorel T\u0103nase and C\u0103t\u0103lin Tofan. The 1996\u201397 season brought total football to O\u021belul Stadium. Led by squad captain Valentin \u015etefan, O\u021belul finished the season at 4th place, with Viorel Ion in great form. The first signal arrived in the first round, against Steaua Bucure\u0219ti, when \"the Steelworkers\" controversially lost after a foul committed against Daniel Florea in the penalty area, allowing a goal by Gigi Ion; another goal was scored by Viorel T\u0103nase from 25 metres. A few rounds later, O\u021belul beat then-leader Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti 3\u20131. Later, a 4\u20133 win at Giule\u0219ti Stadium against Rapid Bucure\u0219ti became held as a historic victory for the club. Then was an unexpected 5\u20131 victory against FC U Craiova and O\u021belul climbed to 2nd place in the rankings. With a 3\u20131 victory at FC Na\u021bional (Romania's runners-up at the end of the season), G\u0103l\u0103\u021benii were only 3 points behind the leader. Winning the final match 3\u20130 against Sportul Studen\u021besc, Simiona\u0219 became Romanian coach of the year, Viorel Ion and Valentin \u015etefan made their way to the national team and O\u021belul finished 4th, matching their previous best finish. Simiona\u0219 remained as coach at Gala\u021bi for two more seasons and obtained another 4th place in 1997\u201398 and 6th in 1998\u201399. Highlights include 14 goals scored by Valentin \u0218tefan as a defensive midfielder at the end of the 1997\u201398 season, a 7\u20130 win against Jiul Petro\u0219ani with Male\u0219 scoring O\u021belul's 400th goal in the first league, and dramatic victories against Rapid Bucure\u0219ti (1\u20130) and Progresul Bucure\u0219ti (3\u20132). After achieving 4th place in 1997, O\u021belul competed for the UEFA Cup for the second time. They played in the first qualifying round against Slovenian side HIT Gorica and after a 0\u20132 defeat in Slovenia, O\u021belul led 4\u20130 in the second match, but Gorica scored twice at 88 and 90 minutes, Protega and Enes Demirovi\u0107 qualifying Gorica dramatically. O\u021belul also qualified for the 1998\u201399 UEFA Cup season where they passed the first round, after a 4\u20131 on aggregate against Macedonian side Sloga Jugomagnat. O\u021belul stopped in the second round after a 0\u20136 loss on aggregate against Vejle Boldklub of Denmark. In this period the club received nicknames such as: Cimitirul Granzilor () or Campioana Provinciei (\"The Provincial Champion\"). The squad was also called Genera\u021bia de Aur (\"The Golden Generation\"), a nickname that was later overshadowed by the 2010\u201311 team. However this generation could be considered one of the O\u021belul's best three teams together with the 1988 and 2011 squads. Simiona\u0219 was fired in 1999 after a conflict with sporting manager Mihai Stoica. ===Golden Age of O\u021belul (1999\u20132012)=== After Simiona\u0219 was fired, Dumitru Dumitriu became the new coach and O\u021belul fell to 8th place at the end of the 1999\u20132000 season. Next season O\u021belul dropped to 12th place, but then rose to 5th place, with Victor Ro\u0219ca and then Marius L\u0103c\u0103tu\u0219 as coach. Emil Jula, O\u021belul's top scorer in 2007\u201308 This oscillation continued in 2002\u201303 when O\u021belul finished at 13th place, and faced a relegation play-off against Bihor Oradea (called FC Oradea at that time). At Gala\u021bi, \"the Steelworkers\" won 2\u20131, goals scored by Gheorghe Cornea and Mihai Guri\u021b\u0103, but at Oradea, in front of 20,000 supporters and a motivated FC Oradea team \u2013 which had the chance to play in Divizia A again after a 12-year absence \u2013 O\u021belul lost 1\u20133. Bogdan Vr\u0103jitoarea scored a hat-trick for the hosts, while Viorel T\u0103nase scored for O\u021belul. It was a difficult defeat for the team. However, there was an unexpected turn of events: top division clubs Astra Ploie\u0219ti and Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti merged, leaving a vacant place in the league table for O\u021belul. The club was then bought by Nicolai Boghici, a businessman from Gala\u021bi. O\u021belul had a strong 2003\u201304 Divizia A season under coach Sorin C\u00e2r\u021bu and finished at 5th place, while also making the club's first appearance in the Cupa Rom\u00e2niei Final, where it lost 0\u20132 to Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti. Immediately after this final, it was discovered that the association holding the club had debts of over 15 billion Romanian leu (ROL). O\u021belul earned a position for the 2004\u201305 UEFA Cup competition, starting from the first qualifying round. O\u021belul passed the first round after an 8\u20131 on aggregate against Dinamo Tirana, but stopped in the second round after a 0\u20131 on aggregate against Partizan. In the 2004\u201305 Divizia A season O\u021belul finished 8th. Marius Stan was appointed as the club's president starting in the 2005\u201306 season. In the first part of that season, O\u0163elul had failed to obtain more than 9 points and the team was rebuilt, coach Aurel \u015eunda replaced by Petre Grigora\u015f and 18 new players brought to the team. The changes turned the team's season around, beginning with a 3\u20130 victory against Dinamo, and O\u021belul finished in 9th place. In the Romanian Cup, O\u0163elul was eliminated in the quarterfinals in penalty shoot-outs against FC Na\u021bional. Dorinel Munteanu, coach who won the only Romanian title with O\u021belul In the 2006\u201307 season O\u021belul finished 5th in the standings. At the end of this season, prominent player Viorel T\u0103nase retired, scoring a goal in his last match. Thanks to good positioning in the league table, the team qualified for the UEFA Intertoto Cup. In the Romanian Cup, O\u021belul was once again eliminated in penalties, this time by Steaua Bucure\u0219ti. The debut of the 2007\u201308 season was made in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, where O\u021belul met Slavija Sarajevo (3rd place in the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina). The match played in Bosnia and Herzegovina at Ko\u0161evo Stadium ended 0\u20130. The second match played at Gala\u021bi was an unexpected 3\u20130 win for O\u021belul, with goals by Emil Jula (at 31 and 42 minutes) and Gabriel Paraschiv (70 min). In the finals, O\u021belul faced well-known Turkish side Trabzonspor (4th place in the S\u00fcper Lig). O\u0163elul won the first match in Gala\u021bi 2\u20131 in front of 5,000 spectators. Daniel Stan opened the score (28 min), Ersen Martin tied (83 min) and the match was decided by the goal of Gabriel Paraschiv (87 min). The second match was played at H\u00fcseyin Avni Aker Stadium before more than 20,000 spectators. The Turkish side opened the score with a 15-metre-long shot in the corner by Ceyhun Eri\u015f (8 min). J\u00e1nos Sz\u00e9kely scored five minutes later, then G\u0103l\u0103\u021benii defended and counterattacked, Tadas Labukas and Emil Jula passing next to the second goal (77 min). After a counterattack, a Turkish defender made a penalty (88 min), and Emil Jula scored and qualified the team for the preliminary round of the UEFA Cup. In the UEFA Cup, O\u021belul faced Lokomotiv Sofia (3rd place in the A PFG). The first match played on Balgarska Armia Stadium in Sofia was lost 1\u20133. In the second match O\u021belul attacked but failed to score, and a 0\u20130 draw eliminated the team. In the Liga I, O\u0163elul finished at 8th place. Emil Jula took 2nd place in the league's top scorers table, with 17 goals. For these feats head coach Petre Grigora\u0219 was called cel mai tare din ora\u0219 (\"the best of the city\"). Problems arose in the 2008\u201309 season. O\u021belul finished 12th and the club had reached a situation close to bankruptcy. The following season brought great changes as Petre Grigora\u015f left and was replaced by Dorinel Munteanu. In the 2009\u201310 season, O\u021belul achieved 8th place. O\u021belul achieved its best performance in the 2010\u201311 season, winning the first league, defeating main rival FC Timi\u015foara in a direct match for the title. Two months later, the club won the Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei in a 1\u20130 victory over Steaua Bucure\u0219ti. The squad which won included: goalkeepers Branko Grahovac, Cristian Br\u0103ne\u0163, and Gabriel Abraham; defenders Cornel R\u00e2p\u0103, Samoel Cojoc, Cristian S\u00eerghi, Milan Perendija, Sergiu Costin, Enes \u0160ipovi\u0107, Constantin Mi\u0219el\u0103ricu, Adrian Salageanu, and Silviu Ilie; midfielders Ionu\u021b Neagu, Gabriel Giurgiu, Ioan Filip, Ciprian Milea, Liviu Antal, Lauren\u0163iu Iorga, Lauren\u0163iu Petean, John Ibeh, Gabriel Viglianti, R\u0103zvan Ochiro\u015fii, Lauren\u0163iu Bu\u015f, and Gabriel Paraschiv; and forwards Bratislav Puno\u0161evac and R\u00f3bert Elek; with coach Dorinel Munteanu. In the 2011\u201312 season O\u021belul finished at 6th place, and also participated in the UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time. Their group had prominent opponents Manchester United, Benfica and FC Basel, and it was a huge moment for the club to play against top European teams. O\u021belul did not obtain a single victory, losing at the limit: 2\u20133 and 0\u20131 against FC Basel, double 0\u20131 against Benfica and a double 0\u20132 against Manchester United. ===Decline and bankruptcy (2012\u20132016)=== O\u021belul's 50th anniversary logo, used between 2014 and 2016 After two fantastic seasons O\u021belul faced difficulty as the club's shareholders wanted the money the club had received for Champions League participation. In the 2012\u201313 season Marius Stan left to become mayor of Gala\u021bi, and Dan Adamescu became the new owner of the club. O\u021belul lost Dorinel Munteanu as coach; Viorel T\u0103nase, a star player who had retired in 2007, was named as his replacement. T\u0103nase managed to finish the first part of the season outside the relegation zone, but during the winter break was replaced with Petre Grigora\u015f. O\u021belul finished 11th with 43 points. In the Romanian Cup, they reached the semi-finals, where they were eliminated by Petrolul, the winner of the competition. On 10 July 2013 O\u021belul went into insolvency, despite 22 million earned from its participation in the UEFA Champions League the previous season, being one of the strangest cases in Romanian football. Ewald Lienen, coach who saved O\u021belul from relegation in 2014, despite a difficult financial situation Grigora\u015f left the club at the end of the 2013\u201314 season and Ionu\u0163 Badea was hired for the new season. Poor results led to Badea's resignation and the arrival of Ewald Lienen, a German coach trained in the Bundesliga. He managed to finish the season with O\u021belul at 10th place. Unfortunately, after this season the team broke up; Lienen and almost all of the players left due to poor financial situations. The 2014\u201315 season brought huge changes at O\u021belul. Dan Adamescu was arrested in a case of bribery and the transfers were made in inadequate conditions. Among the coaches brought in and subsequently fired were: Michael Wei\u00df, Tibor Selymes and Florin Marin. Additionally, the Liga I reorganized so that the last 6 places were relegated, instead of 4. O\u021belul finished 17th and was relegated to Liga II, after 23 consecutive seasons in the top flight of the Romanian football. O\u021belul had 27 seasons of Liga I, holding 16th place in the Liga I All-time table. It is also the second-best Moldovan team in this ranking, surpassed only by FCM Bac\u0103u \u2013 but it is the only Moldovan side to win a national title. The next season spent in the Liga II was painful one for many of O\u021belul's fans. The team had to fight in many of the games with the youth squad, ending last in the first series of the second league. The sporting relegation was followed by the club's bankruptcy, declared on 1 April 2016 by the Bucharest Tribunal. Less than 5 years after winning the first champion title, the club had suddenly disappeared. The fall of O\u021belul gave rise to many concerns in the Romanian media. In 2016, Marius Stan accused Adamescu for the devaluation of the club: In 2017, Adamescu's son, Alexander Adamescu, accused Stan of defective management and that the club was his piggybank: ===Refounding and recent history (2016\u2013present)=== After the dissolution of the club, O\u021belul supporters founded a new association called Asocia\u021bia Supporter Club O\u021belul Gala\u021bi and registered it to compete in Liga IV. On 19 July 2016, ASC O\u021belul Gala\u021bi was officially born with the objective of continuing the tradition of O\u021belul and of football in Gala\u021bi. ASC O\u021belul Gala\u021bi was considered the spiritual successor of the old club because it wore the same colors, it played in the same stadium and was supported by the same fans. However, it didn't own the brand and league record of the old club, which had been bought at auction for 10,000. However, the winner of the auction did not pay the bid which became void. With the aid of a law firm, ASC O\u021belul gained possession of the record and brand and became the official successor of the club on 12 September 2017. At the end of its first season, ASC O\u021belul won Liga IV \u2013 Gala\u021bi County and defeated the champions of Ia\u0219i County, Unirea Mirce\u0219ti, in a play-off to win promotion to the Liga III. Under coach Stelian Bordieanu, a former player of the club, O\u021belul won 30 of its 32 matches in all competition, setting a record for Romanian football. ==Youth program== The youth academy of O\u021belul Gala\u021bi was never a big one and had an important local rival, Dun\u0103rea Gala\u021bi football academy, from which many important footballers developed. O\u021belul developed young players including: Iulian Arhire, Florin Cernat, Romulus Chihaia, Daniel Florea, Silviu Ilie, Lauren\u021biu Iorga, George Miron, Ionu\u021b Neagu, D\u0103nu\u021b Oprea, Cornel R\u00e2p\u0103, Viorel T\u0103nase, C\u0103t\u0103lin Tofan or Alexandru Tudorie. ==Grounds== O\u021belul Stadium The club plays its home matches on Stadionul O\u021belul in Gala\u021bi. Over time, O\u021belul also used other local venues such as Stadionul Nicolae Rainea, Stadionul Siderurgistul and Baza Sportiv\u0103 Zoltan David, but only for short periods of time or for a few matches. ==Support== O\u0163elul supporters in 2007 O\u021belul has many supporters in Gala\u021bi and Gala\u021bi County, but also in the region of southern Moldavia. O\u021belul Gala\u021bi has many ultras groups such as: Steel Boys, Ultra Sud, Sidexplozia, SCOG and New Order. Regular fans that are not affiliated to any ultras groups can join the Liga Suporterilor G\u0103l\u0103\u0163eni 1993 (The Gala\u021bi Supporters League 1993) organization. After the 2016 dissolution of the club, O\u021belul fans from the aforementioned groups founded Supporter Club O\u021belul Gala\u021bi and enrolled the team in the Liga IV; this action saved the club from a final disappearance, and their actions proved the attachment of the fans to \"the red, white and blue\" side. ===Rivalries=== The bitter rivals of O\u021belul Gala\u021bi are Dacia Unirea Br\u0103ila, who they face in a competition known as Derby-ul Dun\u0103rii de Jos (\"The Lower Danube Derby\"). Any Gala\u021bi\u2013Br\u0103ila match is considered a derby, taking this term from a regional derby in the early years of football. Another important local rivalry is against Dun\u0103rea Gala\u021bi, a club born from the breakup of O\u021belul. O\u0163elul fans also share a rivalry with Poli Ia\u015fi supporters, following a series of clashes between the two sets of fans. A much newer rivalry is one against FC Vaslui. At a national level O\u021belul had important rivals over time, but most of them were conjuncture rivals such as: Steaua Bucure\u0219ti, Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti or Rapid Bucure\u0219ti, especially in the 1990s, with later isolated episodes and Politehnica Timi\u0219oara between 2010 and 2011, when the two teams were fighting for the national title. ==Honours== ===Domestic=== ====Leagues==== *Liga I **Winners (1): 2010\u201311 *Liga II **Winners (2): 1985\u201386, 1990\u201391 *Liga III **Winners (2): 1967\u201368, 1980\u201381 **Runners-up (1): 1972\u201373 *Liga IV \u2013 Gala\u021bi County **Winners (2): 1976\u201377, 2016\u201317 ====Cups==== *Cupa Rom\u00e2niei **Runners-up (1): 2003\u201304 *Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei **Winners (1): 2011 ===European=== *UEFA Intertoto Cup **Winners (1): 2007The UEFA Intertoto Cup: Past Winners.
