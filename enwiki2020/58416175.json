It consists of a lyc\u00e9e as well as BTS assistant manager and BTS bank staff courses. It takes the name of Jean Racine, playwright and historiographer to the King. The main site is served by the m\u00e9tro stations of Saint-Lazare, Saint-Augustin and Europe. The second site (Naples) is served by the stations Villiers, Europe and Miromesnil. == History == Porch. Lyc\u00e9e Racine was built by the architect Paul Gout and opened in 1886. It was the second girls' school to open in Paris, after the lyc\u00e9e F\u00e9nelon. The establishment bears the name of Jean Racine, French playwright of the 17th century. == Organisation == The lyc\u00e9e is split into two sites: the main site is located at 20 rue du Rocher (Rocher), and the second site is located at 38 rue de Naples (Naples). The acquisition of the second site allowed the school to increase capacity, and start bilingual and trilingual BTS classes. The sport classes take place in the gymnasium of Naples and in the outside areas. However, there are also some sport activities at Rocher. Each site has its own school life, its own canteen, and its own library. Classes are run between the two sites, apart from the science track (S) and part-time courses (double courses in music and dance) which take place at Rocher for practical reasons. == Classes == The lyc\u00e9e Racine includes part- time classes for those students involved in arts at a high level in national or regional conservatoires, etc. It has its own orchestra and choir. Students are able to use their free time to practice the arts, and are offered parallel baccalaur\u00e9ats in literature and science.
