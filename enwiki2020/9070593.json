Whilst in exile, the maid wakes one night to find her lover at her window mounted upon a fine horse. They go out riding together until the man complains he has a headache; the maid tends to him and ties her handkerchief around his head. She returns to her father, who gives her the news that her young lover has in fact died of grief, whereupon she goes to his grave and digs up the bones, finding that her handkerchief is tied round the skull. In broadside versions she dies of grief shortly afterwards. ==Words== > The Lover's Ghost It's of a farmer in our town, His election goes the > country round; He had a daughter, a beauty bright, In every place was her > heart's delight. Many a young man a-courting came, But none of them would > her favour gain, Till a young man came, of low degree, Came underhanded and > she fancied he. Soon as her father came this to hear, He separated her from > her dear, For four score miles this maid was sent, To her uncle's home for > his discontent. Nine days after this young man died, And his ghost appeared > at her bedside - \"Rise, rise, my love and come with me, And break these > chains and set me free.\" This maid arose and got up behind, And he drove as > swift as the very wind, And not a word did this young man speak, But - \"My > dearest dear, how my head does ache!\" She had a handkerchief of the holland > kind, And around his head she did him bind; She kissed his pale lips, and > thus did say - \"My dearest dear, you're as cold as clay.\" He drove her up to > her father's door, And saw her father standing on the floor - \"O father > dear, did you send for me By such a kind messenger, kind sir?\" said she. He > wrung his hands and tore his hair, Much like a man in deep despair; He tore > the hair all from his head, Crying - \"Daughter dear, the young man is dead.\" > Early next morning this maid arose, And straightaway to the churchyard goes, > She rose the corpse that was nine day's dead, And found her handkerchief > bound round his head. O parents, parents, a warning take, Don't chide your > children, for heaven's sake! Don't chide your children, for heaven's sake, > Or you'll repent when it is too late.
