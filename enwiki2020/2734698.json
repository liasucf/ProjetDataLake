    "text": "\"Jeffty Is Five\" is a fantasy short story by American author Harlan Ellison. It was first published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in 1977, then was included in DAW's The 1978 Annual World's Best SF in 1978 and Ellison's short story collection Shatterday two years later. According to Ellison, it was partially inspired by a fragment of conversation that he misheard at a party at the home of actor Walter Koenig: \"How is Jeff?\" \"Jeff is fine. He's always fine,\" which he perceived as \"Jeff is five, he's always five.\" Additionally, Ellison based the character of Jeffty on Joshua Andrew Koenig, Walter's son. He declared: ==Plot== Jeffty is a boy who never grows past the age of five \u2014 physically, mentally, or chronologically. The narrator, Jeffty's friend from the age of five well into adulthood, discovers that Jeffty's radio plays all-new episodes of long-canceled serial programs, broadcast on radio stations that no longer exist. He can buy all-new issues of long-discontinued comic books such as The Shadow and Doc Savage, and of long- discontinued pulp magazines with all-new stories by long-dead authors like Stanley G. Weinbaum, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Robert E. Howard. Jeffty can even watch films that are adaptations of old pulp fiction novels like Alfred Bester's The Demolished Man. The narrator is privy to this world because of Jeffty's trust, while the rest of the world (the world that got older as Jeffty did not) is not. While waiting in line at the local movie house, Jeffty borrows a portable radio. He tunes in a radio show from the past. The other children, upset that they cannot return the radio to the broadcast of a ball game, beat him badly. Once returned to his home, Jeffty\u2019s mother drowns him in the bathtub. ==Reception== \"Jeffty Is Five\" won the 1977 Nebula Award for Best Short StoryNebula Award Winners 1965-2011, at Science Fiction Writers of America; retrieved February 26, 2017 and the 1978 Hugo Award for Best Short Story,1978 Hugo Awards , at TheHugoAwards.org; retrieved February 26, 2017 and was nominated for the 1978 World Fantasy Award\u2014Short Fiction.Nominees, at the World Fantasy Convention; retrieved February 26, 2017 It was also voted in a 1999 online poll of Locus readers1999 Locus Poll, at Locus Online (via archive.org) as the best short story of all time.
