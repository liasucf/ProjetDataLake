He joined the Kantonsschule Z\u00fcrcher Unterland (KZU) with a focus on ancient languages and philosophy. Kaufmann received his master's degree in Neuroscience and Economics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich and Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, United States. ==Career== In 2012, while at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the University of Zurich Kaufmann initiated and developed a humanoid robot called Roboy, with Prof. Dr. Rolf Pfeifer. Roboy combines the latest insights from the field of embodied intelligence research and the most recent advances in the field of robotics. Kaufmann takes on a more sceptical view on the current state of AI, in particular about the analogy that the brain is comparable to a computer. His vision \"to think with the power of 1,000 brains\" gave rise to the concept of the \"Corporate Brain\" which is today the core technology of the software company Starmind International which he founded with Marc Vontobel in 2010. The company is based in Kuesnacht, Switzerland and has operations in New York and Frankfurt. In 2017, Kaufmann initiated the non-profit Mindfire foundation dedicated to progressing AI openly, responsibly and ethically. Ultimately, to use the power of human level AI to solve our most pressing global challenges. ==References== Category:1978 births Category:Living people ",
