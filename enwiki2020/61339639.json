In 2014, the company introduced Redd's Wicked Apple, which is 8% alcohol, \"to provide a refreshing alternative to drinkers during occasions that typically have been exclusive to spirits,\" according to David Kroll, MillerCoors vice president of insights and innovation. Other flavors the company has announced were Green Apple and Wicked Mango; Cranberry Ale, Blueberry Ale and Ginger Apple Ale; Blueberry Ale; and Raspberry Ale and Peach Ale. As an ale, Redd's get its alcohol from fermented and malted grain, in contrast to a hard cider, which gets its alcohol from fermented apple juice. As of 2014, Redd was in third place with a 12.4 percent market share in the \"malternative\" category. ==References== ==External links== *Home | Redds Apple Ale Category:Flavored malt beverages ",
