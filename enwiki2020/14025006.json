    "text": "In enzymology, a phenol O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :S-adenosyl-L-methionine + phenol \\rightleftharpoons S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + anisole Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and phenol, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and anisole. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L- methionine:phenol O-methyltransferase. This enzyme is also called PMT. This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism. == References == * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure Category:O-Methylated natural phenols metabolism ",
