    "text": "Sex report films (German: Report-Filme) were pseudo-documentaries that had sexual life as their subject matter. Effectively sexploitation films, the genre was particularly popular in the early 1970s Europe. ==Background== Mostly a German (or Germanophone) phenomenon, these films followed the wake of the Kinsey and Masters and Johnson type reports as well as maintaining elements from the German-speaking educational films (Aufkl\u00e4rungsfilme) tradition. Producers Erwin C. Dietrich (particularly in the late 1960s) and Wolf C. Hartwig were active in the genre: the latter produced the Schulm\u00e4dchen-Report films, which may be considered a subgenre on their own. ==After Schulm\u00e4dchen-Report== The success of the Schulm\u00e4dchen-Report: Was Eltern nicht f\u00fcr m\u00f6glich halten in 1970 triggered a range of new films that had titles ending with the word -Report per norm, which ostensibly focused on certain populations and gradually lost their pseudo-documentary tone. Hausfrauen-Report (1971), Ehem\u00e4nner-Report (1971), Lehrm\u00e4dchen-Report (1972), Krankenschwestern-Report (1972), Teenager-Report (1973) were among the most distinguished specimens of the genre, where Ernst Hofbauer was exalted as a pioneering director. ==References== * * Category:Sexploitation films Category:German-language films Category:Film genres ",
