    "text": "The FIDM Museum & Library, Inc. was founded in 1978 to serve the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (FIDM) and the community. Since January 1999, the museum's operations have been separate from the Library in order to offer more specialized care and attention to the specific needs of a costume collection, and museum-trained personnel have been added to the staff. ==Contents== The museum is located on the ground floor of the Los Angeles campus of the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, and houses a collection of over 12,000 costumes, accessories and textiles from the 18th century through the present day, including film and theater costume. The FIDM Museum also houses the early Hollywood Costume Collection on loan from the City of Los Angeles, Department of Parks and Recreation. It presents the annual Motion Picture Costume Design exhibition at the galleries. The Annette Green Perfume Museum is in permanent residence at the FIDM Museum & Galleries, located on the 2nd floor. ==References== ;Sources * ;External links * Fidm site map. fidm.edu.
