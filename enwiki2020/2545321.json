    "text": "The 1960\u201361 NHL season was the 44th season of the National Hockey League. The Chicago Black Hawks defeated the Detroit Red Wings in the 1961 Stanley Cup Final four games to two to win the Stanley Cup. It was the first series since with two American-based teams. It was Chicago's first Cup win since ; they would not win another until . Gordie Howe of the Red Wings became the first player in NHL history to achieve the career mark of 1,000 regular-season points. It would be seven more seasons before the Montreal Canadiens' Jean Beliveau would match the feat. ==League business== The original Hart Trophy was retired, as all its plaques were filled and its general condition had deteriorated. A new trophy was commissioned and the award was renamed the Hart Memorial Trophy. ==Off-season== On September 15, 1960, Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard announced his retirement from hockey. During his career, he had led all scorers with a record 544 goals plus 82 for the playoffs. Despite the league expanding the number of games in a season to 70 games from 50 since Richard's famous 50 goals in 50 games, Richard remained the only player to score 50 goals in a season, until this season. ==Regular season== By this season, the Chicago Black Hawks were a strong team. They had an especially powerful defense, which had Pierre Pilote, Al Arbour, Jack Evans, and Elmer Vasko. Up front, youngsters Bobby Hull and Stan Mikita led the offense, and goaltender Glenn Hall was the Hawks' steady presence between the pipes. It was reported that Eddie Shore, the great Boston Bruins defenseman and four-time league MVP from the 1930s, had been stricken with a heart attack, but was resting comfortably in a Springfield, Massachusetts hospital. On October 13, the Canadiens routed the Rangers 8\u20134, with Bernie Geoffrion and Dickie Moore each scoring hat tricks. Jack McCartan got his only NHL shutout for the New York Rangers by blanking the Black Hawks 2\u20130 on October 19. Chicago's Reg Fleming set a record with 37 penalty minutes in this game. They included three major penalties for battles with Dean Prentice, Eddie Shack, and John Hanna, a misconduct, and a game misconduct. On December 1, the Canadiens, who had traded Andr\u00e9 Pronovost to Boston for Jean-Guy Gendron, defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 6\u20133 at the Montreal Forum. Gendron had a goal, but the main feature was the 21 penalties referee Frank Udvari had to call, including several majors in the third period. Henri Richard took on Frank Mahovlich, Dickie Moore squared off with Bob Pulford, and Marcel Bonin scrapped with Bobby Baun. Toronto general manager and head coach George \"Punch\" Imlach was in a bad mood following the game and said to the press among other things that Udvari and linesmen Loring Doolittle and George Hayes should have been picked as the three stars for the help they gave to Montreal. Imlach's comments were brought to the attention of NHL president Clarence Campbell, who fined the Leafs bench boss $200. In the new year, Stan Mikita helped to spark Chicago. He scored two goals in a 3\u20132 win over the Rangers on January 4 and scored the winner when the Black Hawks beat Boston 4\u20133 the following night. Former Canadiens defenceman Leo Lamoureux died in Indianapolis on January 11 at age 45. Chicago defeated the Rangers 4\u20133 on March 8. New York goalie Gump Worsley pulled a hamstring muscle and Joe Shaefer replaced him with the score 1\u20131. The next night, the Rangers were eliminated from the playoffs as Bernie Geoffrion potted a hat trick in a 6\u20131 pasting by the Canadiens. Toronto's Johnny Bower, who appeared on his way to winning the Vezina Trophy, strained a leg muscle and would have to take a rest. Cesare Maniago played in goal for the Leafs on March 16 and lost 5\u20132. It looked like two players, Toronto's Frank Mahovlich and Montreal's Bernie \"Boom Boom\" Geoffrion, were going to hit 50 goals, but Mahovlich ended up slumping near the end of the season and missed 50 by two goals. Geoffrion scored his 50th goal that night and got a wild ovation. He also added 45 assists and led the league in scoring. Toronto played a 2\u20132 tie with the Rangers in their final game of the season and Bobby Baun was a victim of his own hard hitting. Camille Henry of the Rangers ran into Baun and Henry's skate cut Baun in the neck. Baun returned for the third period, but after the game, while boarding the team bus, he began to gasp desperately. He groped for attention and waved his arms, and his teammates finally realized he was in trouble and rushed him to the hospital where an emergency operation was performed to permit breathing. Baun missed some action in the playoffs as the result of the injury. ===Final standings=== ==Playoffs== For the Montreal Canadiens, two streaks came to an end. The Canadiens' streak of ten consecutive Finals appearances and five consecutive Finals wins came to an end with a defeat to eventual Stanley Cup champion Chicago Black Hawks in the first round. The Detroit Red Wings defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in the other semifinal to set up an all-American final between Chicago and Detroit. ===Playoff bracket=== ===Semifinals=== ====(1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (3) Chicago Black Hawks==== ====(2) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (4) Detroit Red Wings==== ===Stanley Cup Finals=== Chicago defeated the Red Wings in six games to win their first Cup since 1938, and their last until 2010. ==Awards== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\" colspan=\"2\" | 1960\u201361 NHL awards |- |Prince of Wales Trophy: (Regular season champion) || Montreal Canadiens |- |Art Ross Trophy: (Top scorer) || Bernie Geoffrion, Montreal Canadiens |- |Calder Memorial Trophy: (Best first-year player) || Dave Keon, Toronto Maple Leafs |- |Hart Memorial Trophy: (Most valuable player) || Bernie Geoffrion, Montreal Canadiens |- |James Norris Memorial Trophy: (Best defenceman) || Doug Harvey, Montreal Canadiens |- |Lady Byng Memorial Trophy: (Excellence and sportsmanship) || Red Kelly, Toronto Maple Leafs |- |Vezina Trophy: (Goaltender of team with the best goals-against average) || Johnny Bower, Toronto Maple Leafs |} ===All-Star teams=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
