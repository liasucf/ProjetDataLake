An additional 4 teams will qualify through having the fastest times at approved qualifying events during the qualifying period (1 March 2019 to 30 May 2020). ==Competition format== The competition consists of two rounds: heats and a final.

Mixed medleys must consist of two men and two women, but the choice of order (and therefore stroke) is left to the team. ==Schedule== All times are Japan standard time (UTC+9) {| class=\"wikitable\" !Date !Time !Round |- |TBC |19:00 |Heats |- |TBC |10:30 |Final |} ==Results== ===Heats=== The relay teams with the top 8 times, regardless of heat, advance to the final. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !
