The tower house was transferred to state ownership in 1930. ==The tower house== The tower house (caiseal) rises to the chemin de ronde, off which are four evenly spaced machicolations. It is five storeys tall with slit windows and large fireplaces on the second and fourth levels. A hole in the north wall on the fourth level leads to a secret chamber set into the walls.
