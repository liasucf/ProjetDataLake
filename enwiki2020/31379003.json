    "text": "Kentchurch is a small village in Herefordshire, England. It is located some south-west of Hereford and north-east of Abergavenny, beside the River Monnow and adjoining the boundary between England and Wales. The village name probably derives from an original dedication of the church to a 5th-century nun, Cein, or her sister Ceingar, who were daughters of Brychan, king of Brycheiniog. The area was historically Welsh-speaking and part of the land known as Archenfield. According to one version of the legend, Kentchurch was the home of the folk figure Jack o' Kent. ==Kentchurch Court== Kentchurch Court is a historic house and Grade I listed building, dating back largely to the 14th century. It was enlarged in the late 17th or early 18th century, and was partly remodelled in the Gothic revival style by John Nash after 1795. Further reconstruction took place in the 1820s. The estate contains a large deer park, dating from the time when the land was owned by the Knights Templar.
