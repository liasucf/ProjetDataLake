    "text": "3T is an American R&B;/pop music trio featuring the three sons of Tito Jackson (from The Jackson 5) and Delores \"Dee Dee\" Jackson. The band members include, from eldest, Tariano Adaryll Jackson, Jr. (also known as Taj), Taryll Adren Jackson and Tito Joe Jackson (also known as T. J.). Their uncle, Michael Jackson, mentored the trio and signed them to his label, MJJ Entertainment. ==History== ===Brotherhood (1995\u20131997)=== 3T released their debut album Brotherhood in 1995. The album sold approximately three million copies worldwide. The group achieved an international hit with their debut single \"Anything\". 3T released several hit singles in Europe, including \"24/7\", \"Why\" (a duet with their uncle Michael Jackson), \"I Need You\" (with a brief appearance by Michael), \"Tease Me\" and \"Gotta Be You\". In 1996, they were ranked second behind the Spice Girls, as the biggest-selling group in Europe. 3T have also written and produced songs for soundtracks to films such as The Jacksons: An American Dream, Free Willy, Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home, Men in Black and Trippin'. In early 1997, they went on a hugely successful European tour with their album Brotherhood, which included all of the songs from the album, as well as a Jackson 5 tribute (featuring Tito 'Poppa T') and a surprise performance of the Oasis hit, \"Wonderwall\". 3T completed an album after the release of Brotherhood, with over 20 songs being recorded and 12 planned to be included on the final track list. The album was never released by Sony due to a strained relationship with Michael Jackson (MJJ Music), and is considered by many fans to be The Lost Album. Also they are of Dominican ancestry on their moms side.\"The Lost Album\". 3T.com. Retrieved: 2014-08-12 ===Identity (2003\u20132005)=== Taryll and T.
