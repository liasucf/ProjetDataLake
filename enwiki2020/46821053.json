The street is officially named after the Swiss Baroque architect Giovanni Antonio Viscardi, but took its nickname from the 1930s, when locals could circumvent the nearby Nazi memorial to the martyrs of the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, thus avoiding the requirement to render a Hitler salute to the guarded structure. ==References== Category:Streets in Munich Category:Society in Nazi Germany ",
