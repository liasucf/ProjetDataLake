    "text": "Anatole Bailly (; Orl\u00e9ans, 16 December 1833 \u2013 12 December 1911, Orl\u00e9ans) was a French Hellenist, author of the famous Dictionnaire grec-fran\u00e7ais (Greek- French Dictionary), published in 1895. == Biography== Anatole Bailly was born at Orleans on 16 December 1833 to a family of moderate wealth - his father was a director of the auditing company L'Orl\u00e9anaise and his mother ran a small store selling groceries, fruit and sewing supplies. He studied at a college in Orleans and obtained a bachelor of letters. He was then sent to Paris to prepare for entry into the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in a private institution, which he graduated from in 1853. Anatole Bailly began his career in education as a substitute at the lyc\u00e9e in Lyons. There he successfully achieved the agr\u00e9gation de grammaire. Named a professor at the lyc\u00e9e in Lyon, he left this city in 1859 for a job at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand in Paris. In 1861 he was hired by the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand in Orleans, his home town. He spent the rest of his career in this post, from which he retired in 1889. A competent and conscientious, but very modest, professor, Bailly authored numerous textbooks, grammars and dictionaries of Greek and Latin which were popular in French schools at the end of the 19th century. He was equally interested in history and wrote many biographical accounts of overlooked people from Orleans. He became a member of Orleans scholarly societies of Orleans: the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Agriculture, Sciences, Belles-lettres et Arts d'Orl\u00e9ans and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 arch\u00e9ologique et historique de l'Orl\u00e9anais. At a national level, he was a member of the Conseil acad\u00e9mique de Paris and the Association pour l'encouragement des \u00e9tudes grecques en France (from its foundation in 1867), in addition to being appointed a correspondent of the Institut de France in the Acad\u00e9mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres in 1889. Among other roles, Bailly was an officer of the Acad\u00e9mie, a knight of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, and a knight of the royal order of the Sauveur de Gr\u00e8ce. After the publication in 1885 of the Dictionnaire \u00e9tymologique latin which he co-authored with Michel Br\u00e9al, Bailly completed the Dictionnaire grec-fran\u00e7ais with the assistance of \u00c9mile Egger in 1895. This last work assured his scholarly reputation. The abridged version, which was about half the length of the original, appeared in 1901. He was in the process of producing a revised edition of what would come to be known as Le Bailly, when he died suddenly on 12 December 1911 in his family home, in which he had spent the greater part of his life. A college in Orleans established in June 2008 is named in his honour. == References == * Serge Vannier, Les Hommes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres du XXe dans le Loiret, Romorantin, CPE, 2001. * A.
