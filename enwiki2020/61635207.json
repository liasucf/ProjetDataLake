Both of his parents are teachers. ==Career== ===N\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g=== Uj became an intern at N\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g in 1990, later becoming a full-time employee in 1993. While at N\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g, he also worked on other projects such as CD magazine ABCD, rock magazine Wanted, satirical magazine H\u00f3cip\u0151, as well as working on documentaries and radio shows. He left the paper in 2000 when he became the editor-in-chief of Index.hu, although he stayed there as a columnist until the paper's eventual closure in October 2016, releasing an article on every Wednesday. ===Index=== Uj, together with Andr\u00e1s Ny\u00edr\u0151, G\u00e1bor Ger\u00e9nyi and Bal\u00e1zs K\u00e9ki, founded Index on 17 May 1999 as a successor to Ny\u00edr\u0151's Internetto. Although Uj was a regular contributor to both Ny\u00edr\u0151's previous endavour, ABCD, and Internetto, with many of the website's staff already considering him a member, this was never an official relationship. This changed with the founding of Index as Uj became Index's news editor, and he eventually resigned from N\u00e9pszabads\u00e1g. Shortly afterwards, Ny\u00edr\u0151 resigned as editor-in-chief of Index in December 1999, paving the way for Uj to become the website's new editor-in-chief in 2000. He stayed in this position until his resignation in 2011. In 2016, Uj claimed that he left Index because one of Index's employees got fired after publishing an article critical of Viktor Orb\u00e1n. ===Origo=== In 2012, Uj reunited with his former Index colleague, Albert Gazda at Origo.hu to help transform the website. ===444=== In March 2013, news reports broke that Uj was working on a new website, reportedly under the name Jeti V\u00e1lasz (literally: Yeti Answer, a parody of conservative weekly Heti V\u00e1lasz) or Magyar Jeti. A month later, Uj launched 444.hu with the intention of competing with Index and Origo. He was also joined by several of his former colleagues at Index, with Uj becoming the website's editor-in-chief and part-owner. As of August 2019, Uj remains as 444's editor-in-chief. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Hungarian journalists Category:People from Szolnok Category:20th-century Hungarian male writers Category:21st-century Hungarian male writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
