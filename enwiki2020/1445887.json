    "text": "Helsinki commuter rail (, , literal translation Local traffic of the capital region) is the commuter rail system serving Greater Helsinki, Finland. The network is part of the HSL network, and is operated by VR, the Finnish state- owned national railway company. Together with the Helsinki Metro, buses, and trams, the network forms the heart of Helsinki's public transportation infrastructure. Trains run primarily above ground in the Helsinki metropolitan area. Within the municipalities of Espoo, Helsinki, Kauniainen, Kerava, Kirkkonummi, Siuntio, Vantaa and Tuusula, the system uses tickets that are interchangeable with the bus, metro, and tram networks managed by HSL. The HSL area is divided into four zones (A-D).https://www.hsl.fi/uudetvy%C3%B6hykkeet HSL (in Finnish). Retrieved 2019-5-22 Travelling beyond the HSL area, one must use VR commuter tickets. Passengers travelling from the HSL area to stations located within J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 (Ainola, J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4, Saunakallio, Haarajoki) and vice versa can use both VR and HSL commuter tickets, despite J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 not being within the HSL area. This is due to its being situated between the Kerava and Jokela stations, both of which belong in the HSL area. The network is composed of 14 separate services, pictured in the network map below. They operate on four branches of railway lines that all begin, and terminate, at the Helsinki Central Station. The system has a total of 70 stations, 14 of which are located within the city of Helsinki. There are about 676 departures every weekday. The commuter rail services carried a total 70 million passengers in 2018. Tickets used to be sold aboard all the commuter trains by conductors until June 2017. Afterwards conductors have been repurposed to inspect tickets, assist passengers and do light maintenance tasks. Nowadays the tickets must be purchased beforehand, from ticket-vending machines, kiosks or via mobile. In September 2018, HSL prequalified seven parties that had expressed interest in operating the services from June 2021 until 2031, namely VR, Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead Group, MTR Nordic, SJ and Transdev.Seven approved to bid for Helsinki operating contract Railway Gazette International 4 September 2018 On 5 May 2020, HSL announced that VR has been selected to continue to operate the Helsinki commuter rail in said upcoming contract, citing higher than expected cost savings in VR's proposal.https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-11335123 ==History== Local train services were initiated in the Helsinki region on 1 June 1886 with four services per day in each direction: two services terminated in Malmi, one in Kerava and one in J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4. At first, until 1896, these services only ran from June to September. === Rantarata === The Rantarata (\"coastal line\") was completed in 1903. In 1904, the railway was used by three services in each direction, two running between Helsinki and Kirkkonummi and one between Karis and Helsinki. This line was built mostly with commuter traffic in mind. The construction of housing began near the stations. By 1910, the number of daily services had increased to 10. === Steam locomotive era === During the steam locomotive era, local traffic was handled with locomotives like the Pr1 and wooden carriages with wide doors for embarkment. The number of trips increased vastly after Finland gained independence in 1917, with 4 million trips made in 1920 and 9 million in 1924. The depression of the 1930s decreased the number of commuters; at its lowest, there were only 3 million trips per year. By 1939, the amount of trips had risen back to 4 million.Herranen, Timo (1988) Fr\u00e5n h\u00e4stomnibussar till metro. Helsingfors stads publikationer nr 39 === Diesel locomotive era === During the short diesel locomotive era from the end of the 1950s to the beginning of the 1970s, commuter services used DMUs of classes Dm7, Dm8, and Dm9. === Electrification === The tracks were not upgraded during either the steam or diesel eras. Both P\u00e4\u00e4rata and the beginning of Rantarata west to Kirkkonummi were the only sections of track to accommodate long- distance, freight, and commuter trains. Parts of Rantarata are still single- tracked between Kirkkonummi and Turku. Operation similar to the system's current state started in 1969 when the first stretch, between Helsinki and Kirkkonummi, was electrified. Electrification of the Helsinki\u2013Riihim\u00e4ki railway followed suit soon after, and EMU traffic on the Helsinki\u2013Hiekkaharju section started on 1 September 1970. Electrification was extended further to Kerava in early December 1970 and to Riihim\u00e4ki in early 1972. With electric traction came a significant drop in journey times: while the Dm7 railbus took an hour to reach Kirkkonummi from Helsinki while stopping at all stations, the Sm1 EMU did the same in 45 minutes. Route designation letters were introduced on 28 May 1972. The system was inspired by the designations of the Copenhagen S-train network, and the first letters (A, H, K, L, N, P, R, S and T) were deliberately selected to minimize the risk of ambiguity between both the appearance and pronounciation of the letters. In the same year, a third track was added between Helsinki and Tikkurila. The third track was extended up to Kerava in 1981. === Martinlaakso extension === The railway branch from Huopalahti to Martinlaakso, opened in 1975, was built exclusively for commuter trains, being the first of its kind in Finland. It was later further extended to Vantaankoski in 1991. Currently, on the track sections between both Helsinki and Lepp\u00e4vaara and Helsinki and Kerava, the commuter services use rails parallel to, but separate from those used by long-distance trains, following the German-style S-Bahn principle. The fourth track, which enabled separate city track traffic, was ready up to Tikkurila in 1996 and extended to Kerava in 2004. On the Rantarata, the section between Pasila and Lepp\u00e4vaara was upgraded directly from dual track to four tracks in 2001. === Z service to Lahti === The railway branch from Kerava to Lahti, opened in 2006, was built as a shortcut for long-distance services, and also for the use of the new commuter service line Z. === Ring Rail Line === Service on the Ring Rail Line, connecting Helsinki Airport to the existing railway network at Vantaankoski and Tikkurila, started on 1 July 2015. The station at the airport was opened later, with the Tietotie entrance opening on 10 July and the direct connection to the terminal opening later in the fall. The newly built line extended the Vantaankoski branch via Aviapolis and Helsinki Airport to the P\u00e4\u00e4rata just north of Tikkurila station. The extension introduced five new stations with reservations for three more. Unlike other tracks, a section of the Ring Rail Line beneath the airport runs underground with tunnel stations serving both the airport and Aviapolis. It is possible to construct a branch line to Klaukkala in the future. ==Future extensions== The map with planned extensions. Thick brown lines represent lines with dedicated commuter rail tracks located entirely within the HSL zone. The Helsinki commuter rail itself extends beyond the boundaries of this map. There are plans to extend the four track line from Lepp\u00e4vaara to Espoo. This would enable a shorter headway service to Kauklahti and also benefit long-distance traffic to Turku, which is now hampered by commuter trains on the same tracks on the section between Kirkkonummi and Lepp\u00e4vaara. A major increase in capacity of the Helsinki Central railway station has been planned, as rail capacity at Helsinki station is fully used at peak hours, preventing increases in service. The City Rail Loop would feature an underground, drop-shaped section of rail beginning south of Pasila station and coming back after traveling in a loop around under the city centre. There would be three underground stations: T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 (west), Helsinki city centre (south), and Hakaniemi metro station (east). The Rail Loop will be long. The extension is estimated to cost about \u20ac956 million and is planned to be completed in the 2020s. The Kerava\u2013Porvoo rail line (fi; sv), which is still operated from Kerava to Kilpilahti oil refinery as a freight line and from Olli to Porvoo as a museum railway (fi:Porvoon museorautatie), is currently not in use for passenger traffic, however there are proposals to reinstate commuter traffic up to Nikkil\u00e4 using this line. A branch from Petas on the Ring Rail Line to Klaukkala is also proposed. In the longer term, once the ELSA-rata high speed rail line from Espoo to Salo is completed, commuter services will operate to Lohja. ==Routes== ===Rantarata (Coastal/Turku Line)=== : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Huopalahti \u2013 Lepp\u00e4vaara \u2013 Kauklahti \u2013 Masala \u2013 Kirkkonummi \u2013 Siuntio The Y line is the longest line on the Coastal Line. It operates between Helsinki and Siuntio with very few intermediate stops. The services run quite infrequently, with seven daily departures in each direction on weekdays and with no departures on weekend. One Y-line service is operated from Karis to Helsinki, departing Karis on early morning. When Finland's first electrified line (from Helsinki to Kirkkonummi) was opened, the first service was Y. In 1987 the former Y train service ended and was replaced by S and U trains in 1988. In 2002, the route designation Y was introduced again, as after the Lepp\u00e4vaara city tracks were finished, there was a possibility to add a fast commuter train connection to Karis. Before this, a few of the S and U services continued from Kirkkonummi to Karis. In March 2016 the Y line was shortened to Siuntio. In August 2019, the Y train started stopping at Kauklahti station.https://www.hs.fi/kaupunki/art-2000006187119.html hs.fi. Retrieved on 2019-10-09. This change was made due to increased passenger amounts on the coastal line and in order to equalize the passenger amounts on both the Y train and the slower U train. : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Huopalahti \u2013 Lepp\u00e4vaara \u2013 Kilo \u2013 Kera \u2013 Kauniainen \u2013 Koivuhovi \u2013 Tuomarila \u2013 Espoo \u2013 Kauklahti \u2013 Masala \u2013 Jorvas \u2013 Tolsa \u2013 Kirkkonummi \u2013 Siuntio Train U runs from Helsinki to Kirkkonummi. The line operates with 30 minutes intervals, and aside from Pasila and Huopalahti makes stops all stations after the latter. The line was originally introduced in 1988, but had only few departures during peak hours back then and stopped at fewer stations then nowadays. As of 10 August 2020, the line X designates those services that proceed further to Siuntio after calling in Kirkkonummi. In March 2016, the two lesser used stations of Mankki and Luoma between Kauklahti and Masala were closed and U train began to operate every 30 minutes, replacing the S line. : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Ilmala \u2013 Huopalahti \u2013 Valimo \u2013 Pit\u00e4j\u00e4nm\u00e4ki \u2013 M\u00e4kkyl\u00e4 \u2013 Lepp\u00e4vaara \u2013 Kilo \u2013 Kera \u2013 Kauniainen \u2013 Koivuhovi \u2013 Tuomarila \u2013 Espoo \u2013 Kauklahti \u2013 Masala \u2013 Jorvas \u2013 Tolsa \u2013 Kirkkonummi Train L runs from Helsinki to Kirkkonummi. The service runs only at nights and on weekend mornings, stopping at all stations. One late L train service operates from Helsinki up to Karis, making a stop also at Siuntio. The L train was originally the basic train on the route Helsinki-Kirkkonummi operating primarily with 1 hour intervals. When Lepp\u00e4vaara city tracks were opened for traffic in 2002, the L train became a low traffic train. : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Huopalahti \u2013 Lepp\u00e4vaara \u2013 Kilo \u2013 Kera \u2013 Kauniainen \u2013 Koivuhovi \u2013 Tuomarila \u2013 Espoo \u2013 Kauklahti Train E runs from Helsinki to Kauklahti, making most of its stops at stations in Espoo. The line operates with 30 minute intervals. The E train was originally introduced in 1974 as an additional line to the L train and used to stop at all stations until 2002, when Lepp\u00e4vaara city tracks were opened for traffic. The route was continued in August 2007 to Kauklahti from the former terminus at Espoo station. If city tracks extension from Lepp\u00e4vaara to Espoo station is constructed, E train will form backbone of commuter traffic on the Coastal Line, calling at every station between Helsinki and Kauklahti and replacing the current A train. : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Ilmala \u2013 Huopalahti \u2013 Valimo \u2013 Pit\u00e4j\u00e4nm\u00e4ki \u2013 M\u00e4kkyl\u00e4 \u2013 Lepp\u00e4vaara Train A runs from Helsinki to Lepp\u00e4vaara, stopping at all stations. The train operates with 10-minute intervals during rush hours, otherwise at 20-minute intervals on working days and at 30-minute intervals on weekends. The route designation A was originally used from 28 May 1972 to 25 May 1974 for Kirkkonummi service, and it was re-introduced in June 2002. ===Ring Rail Line and Vantaankoski Line=== A map showing the Ring Rail Line with potential future stations : & Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Ilmala \u2013 Huopalahti \u2013 Pohjois-Haaga \u2013 Kannelm\u00e4ki \u2013 Malminkartano \u2013 Myyrm\u00e4ki \u2013 Louhela \u2013 Martinlaakso \u2013 Vantaankoski \u2013 Vehkala \u2013 Kivist\u00f6 \u2013 Aviapolis \u2013 Airport \u2013 Leinel\u00e4 \u2013 Hiekkaharju \u2013 Tikkurila \u2013 Puistola \u2013 Tapanila \u2013 Malmi \u2013 Pukinm\u00e4ki \u2013 Oulunkyl\u00e4 \u2013 K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Helsinki Trains P and I run in opposing directions to each other in a ring pattern between Helsinki and Helsinki Airport in Vantaa. The P train does this clockwise (in the order listed above), while the I train does this counterclockwise (in reverse order). The Ring Rail line was completed in 2015, and acted as a continuation of the Vantaankoski Line, simultaneously replacing the M train with P, and extending the I train past its original stop at Tikkurila. ===Main/Riihim\u00e4ki Line=== : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 \u2013 Oulunkyl\u00e4 \u2013 Pukinm\u00e4ki \u2013 Malmi \u2013 Tapanila \u2013 Puistola \u2013 Tikkurila \u2013 Hiekkaharju \u2013 Koivukyl\u00e4 \u2013 Rekola \u2013 Korso \u2013 Savio \u2013 Kerava Train K runs from Helsinki to Kerava, stopping at all stations. During 1970's and 1980's the train did not stop at any station between Pasila and Tikkurila. Malmi was added to the stopping pattern in 1988 and Puistola was added in 1996. Oulunkyl\u00e4 was added only after completion of city tracks to Kerava in 2004. In August 2019, the K train started to stop at all stations between Helsinki and Kerava, replacing the N train entirely. This change was made in order to make the stopping pattern of commuter trains on Kerava city tracks clearer by having the trains (I, P, K, T) stopping all stations. The change should also make the operation of commuter trains easier during traffic disruptions. An extension of the line to Nikkil\u00e4 in Sipoo has been planned using a part of existing branch to Kilpilahti oil refinery. : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Tikkurila \u2013 Kerava \u2013 Ainola \u2013 J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Saunakallio \u2013 Jokela \u2013 Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki \u2013 Ryttyl\u00e4 \u2013 Turenki \u2013 H\u00e4meenlinna \u2013 Parola \u2013 Iittala \u2013 Toijala \u2013 Viiala \u2013 Lemp\u00e4\u00e4l\u00e4 \u2013 Tampere Train R runs from Helsinki to Riihim\u00e4ki, making stops at the largest towns on its way and operating primarily with 30 minute intervals. Some of the services continue from Riihim\u00e4ki further to Tampere, making stops at all stations after. These trains are operated with a more irregular interval. All R trains have low floor fleet and timetable requires trains to be capable of 160 km/h speed. R is an original letter from 1972 and has been running on same stop scheme since the inception with one exception which was adding Tikkurila stop in the 80s and both Ainola and Saunakallio in March 2016. The R train also increased the service frequency when the H train was discontinued. On weekends, one commuter train service on R-line, departing Helsinki at 0:40 a.m. is operated all up to H\u00e4meenlinna.https://www.vr.fi/cs/vr/doc/3_Helsinki-Tampere_12-2019.pdf Retrieved 2019-12-30. : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Tikkurila \u2013 Kerava \u2013 J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki \u2013 Ryttyl\u00e4 \u2013 Turenki \u2013 H\u00e4meenlinna Train D runs from Helsinki to Riihim\u00e4ki. It is operated only on weekdays during peak hour, with three morning departures from Riihim\u00e4ki and two afternoon departures from Helsinki. The D train departing Helsinki at 15:50 is operated up to H\u00e4meenlinna, also making stops on two intermediate stations. The first D train service towards Helsinki in the morning is operated all up from H\u00e4meenlinna. The trains are operated with three to four Sm2 class train units, the D train operated to H\u00e4meenlinna however is operated with Sm4 class train units. The D train was introduced in March 2016, replacing the former peak hour services that did not use any letter. The trains were originally operated with Eil/Eilf class commuter coaches pulled by a locomotive. The original stops were at Pasila, Tikkurila, J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 and Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4. In August 2016, the stop at Tikkurila was abolished and replaced by a stop at Kerava. Tikkurila was re- added to the stopping pattern in June 2017, when the D train was started to be operated with Sm2 class train units, replacing the commuter coaches. : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 \u2013 Oulunkyl\u00e4 \u2013 Pukinm\u00e4ki \u2013 Malmi \u2013 Tapanila \u2013 Puistola \u2013 Tikkurila \u2013 Hiekkaharju \u2013 Koivukyl\u00e4 \u2013 Rekola \u2013 Korso \u2013 Savio \u2013 Kerava \u2013 Ainola \u2013 J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Saunakallio \u2013 Jokela \u2013 Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki Train T runs at night once in an hour from Helsinki to Riihim\u00e4ki, stopping at all stations. The line has three services during weekdays and eight during weekends. ===Lahti Line=== : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Tikkurila \u2013 Kerava \u2013 Haarajoki \u2013 M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 \u2013 Henna \u2013 Lahti \u2013 Vill\u00e4hde \u2013 Nastola \u2013 Uusikyl\u00e4 \u2013 Kausala \u2013 Koria \u2013 Kouvola Train Z runs from Helsinki to Lahti via the Kerava-Lahti railway line, making stops at significant junction points in the Helsinki area as well as at all stations between Kerava and Lahti. Two Z trains depart from Kouvola in the morning and return there in the evening rush hour; these services make stops at all stations between Lahti and Kouvola. These trains are driven with Sm2 class train units. All Z trains have low floors and timetable requires trains to be capable of 160 km/h speed. The Z trains are often crowded during peak hours, especially between Helsinki and Kerava and are therefore operated with longer trains. ===Riihim\u00e4ki\u2212Lahti Line=== : Riihim\u00e4ki \u2013 Hiki\u00e4 \u2013 Oitti \u2013 Mommila \u2013 Lappila \u2013 J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 \u2013 Herrala \u2013 Lahti Train G runs from Riihim\u00e4ki to Lahti, and is one of two lettered services not terminating in Helsinki. The train makes intermediate stops at three stations in Hausj\u00e4rvi, two in K\u00e4rk\u00f6l\u00e4 and one in Hollola, and is operated with one hour intervals. The letter G was reintroduced on this route in 2017, replacing earlier services that didn't use any letter. ===Tampere\u2212Pori Line=== : Toijala \u2013 Viiala \u2013 Lemp\u00e4\u00e4l\u00e4 \u2013 Tampere \u2013 (Tesoma) \u2013 Nokia The present-day train M designation was introduced on 15 December 2019 as the second service not terminating in Helsinki; primarily serving the Pirkanmaa region around Tampere. Most of the services on the route are segmented on the route Tampere\u2212Nokia; only several services a day use the entire route from Toijala to Nokia.VR timetable for the period August 10\u2212October 24 2020 All services will also stop on the Tesoma halt after the completion of its construction. ===Former services=== : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 \u2013 Oulunkyl\u00e4 \u2013 Pukinm\u00e4ki \u2013 Malmi \u2013 Tapanila \u2013 Puistola \u2013 Tikkurila \u2013 Hiekkaharju Train P ran from Helsinki to Hiekkaharju, stopping at all stations. The service was started in 1972 and stopped in August 2004. The letter P was reintroduced in 2015 as a clockwise Ring Rail train. : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Ainola \u2013 J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Saunakallio Train G ran from Helsinki to Saunakallio. The line had six services a day in both directions and it was the only train with letter designation on the Helsinki\u2013Riihim\u00e4ki route that did not stop at Tikkurila. The service was started on 4 June 2007. It was abolished in 2011 in order to improve management of traffic and timetable keeping on the Main Line especially during winter conditions. The letter G was reintroduced in 2017 on the previously unlettered line between Riihim\u00e4ki and Lahti. : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Ilmala \u2013 Huopalahti \u2013 Pohjois-Haaga \u2013 Kannelm\u00e4ki \u2013 Malminkartano \u2013 Myyrm\u00e4ki \u2013 Louhela \u2013 Martinlaakso \u2013 Vantaankoski Train M ran from Helsinki to Vantaankoski. The train operated with 10\u201330 minutes intervals, stopping at all stations. The service ran continuously between 1975, when the track to Martinlaakso was completed, and 2015, when the Vantaankoski Line was continued by the Ring Rail Line. In 1991, the line was continued one stop further to Vantaankoski. The letter M stood for Martinlaakso, though the M train was substituted in 2015 with the P train, to avoid confusion with the Helsinki Metro. The letter M is now (since 2019) used for a commuter train service entirely operating in the Tampere region (shown above). : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Ilmala \u2013 Huopalahti \u2013 Lepp\u00e4vaara \u2013 Kilo \u2013 Kera \u2013 Kauniainen \u2013 Koivuhovi \u2013 Tuomarila \u2013 Espoo \u2013 Kauklahti \u2013 Masala \u2013 Kirkkonummi Train S ran from Helsinki to Kirkkonummi. The train was operated with one hour intervals in both directions. Of the two daytime trains running between Helsinki and Kirkkonummi, the S trains were faster. From 28 May 1972 to 25 May 1974, the S trains were running between Helsinki and Kauniainen. The route was continued to Kirkkonummi on 27 September 1987. The S train was abolished in March 2016 when two small stops located between Kauklahti and Masala and served only by the U-line were closed and the U line now runs twice an hour. : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Huopalahti \u2013 Lepp\u00e4vaara \u2013 Espoo \u2013 Masala \u2013 Kirkkonummi Train X ran from Helsinki to Kirkkonummi and was the fastest commuter train service on Helsinki-Kirkkonummi line along with the Y train. The X train had only one service in both directions on weekdays. The X train was introduced in March 2016 and abolished in June 2018. : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 Tikkurila \u2013 Kerava \u2013 (Kyt\u00f6maa) \u2013 (Ristinummi) \u2013 Ainola \u2013 J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 Saunakallio \u2013 Purola \u2013 Nuppulinna \u2013 (Huikko) \u2013 Jokela \u2013 (Takoja) \u2013 (Palopuro) \u2013 Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 \u2013 (Monni) \u2013 Riihim\u00e4ki Train H ran from Helsinki to Riihim\u00e4ki and operated with an interval of one hour. After stopping in Pasila, Tikkurila and Kerava, the line proceeded to stop at all stations. The letter H is an original designation from 1972. Several stops (listed above in parentheses) were procedurally closed in 1990\u201398 due to low passenger numbers and the H trains disturbing other traffic by being too slow. In March 2016, the Purola and Nuppulinna stations were closed and the H trains were replaced with the R train that now has two additional stops and double the frequency. : Helsinki \u2013 Pasila \u2013 K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 \u2013 Oulunkyl\u00e4 \u2013 Pukinm\u00e4ki \u2013 Malmi \u2013 Tapanila \u2013 Puistola \u2013 Tikkurila \u2013 Hiekkaharju \u2013 Koivukyl\u00e4 \u2013 Rekola \u2013 Korso \u2013 Savio \u2013 Kerava Train N ran from Helsinki to Kerava, stopping at all stations. On its final years in operation, the train operated only on early morning and on evening during weekdays, with 30 minute intervals. On weekends the train operated more frequently with 10 minute intervals on Saturday and 15 minute intervals on Sunday. The N train was abolished in August 2019 and was replaced by K train, which started to stop at all stations. ===Lengths of the lines=== *Helsinki\u2013Riihim\u00e4ki (54 min) *Helsinki\u2013Tampere 187 km (116 mi) (2h 8 min) *Helsinki\u2013Lahti (61 min) *Helsinki\u2013Kerava (23 min) *Helsinki\u2013Siuntio 51 km (32 mi) (41 min) *Helsinki\u2013Kirkkonummi (30 min) *Helsinki\u2013Kauklahti (29 min) *Helsinki\u2013Lepp\u00e4vaara (12 min) *Helsinki\u2013Airport via Huopalahti 26 km (16 mi) (32 min) *Helsinki\u2013Airport via Tikkurila 23 km (14 mi) (27 min) === Schematic of the linesCommuter train stations and region map === ==Rolling stock== Starting in July 2017, all commuter train services within the HSL zone will be operated by Sm5 FLIRT trains. The outgoing Sm2- and Sm4-trains will be repurposed for longer-distance lines by VR. Currently used units: * Sm2, 50 units delivered in 1975\u201381 (Valmet/Str\u00f6mberg) * Sm4, 30 units delivered in 1998\u20132005 (Fiat Ferroviaria/CAF/Alstom) * Sm5, 81 units delivered in 2008\u201317 (Stadler, model FLIRT). These trains are run by VR but owned by P\u00e4\u00e4kaupunkiseudun Junakalusto Oy. The first Sm5 unit started commercial operations in November 2009. A total of 81 units were ordered and the series replaced aging Sm1 and Sm2 units in the local traffic services. * In 2019 VR launched the acquisition of about 40 new commuter trains which will replace the sm2 fleet. * Sm1, 50 units delivered in 1968\u201373 (Valmet/Str\u00f6mberg), now phased out by Sm5 fleet. Removed from regular traffic in 2016. * Eil/Eilf commuter traffic cars pulled by a locomotive, 57 cars delivered in 1982\u201387 (so-called \"red cars\"). Use in regular traffic suspended between June 2017 and early-2020. Commuter traffic was the last type of commercial traffic where wooden-bodied cars were utilized on Finnish railways. They were retired in the late 1980s when the Eil cars replaced them. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Transport in Helsinki Category:1969 establishments in Finland Category:Passenger rail transport in Finland ",
