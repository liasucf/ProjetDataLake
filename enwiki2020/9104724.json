    "text": "Dinesh Baboo (also known as Dinesh Babu) (born in Trivandrum, India) is an Indian film director, cinematographer, producer, actor and screenwriter. He has worked in both Malayalam cinema and Kannada cinema. His directorial ventures were chiefly with Kannada films. His popularity also is largely as a director rather than a cinematographer due to his many popular films in Kannada, some of which went on to become blockbusters. ==Career== ===Cinematographer=== His career in cinema started as a cinematographer. He stood behind the camera for noted Malayalam films like Dhruvam, King, Ullasa Poonkattu and the blockbuster movie Commissioner which was instrumental in raising Suresh Gopi, currently a superstar in Malayalam movie world to stardom. Great talent in cinematography was the springboard that launched him to great success in the world of cinema. This also helped him to have first hand knowledge of every technical aspect of cinema, which a director need not be necessarily familiar with. He also directed a Malayalam film named Mazhavillu starring Kunchacko Boban and Preeti Jhangiani. Although his camera skills were widely appreciated in Mollywood, his ambition took him to the world of Kannada films where he chose to direct rather than handle the camera. ===Director=== His directorial career in the Kannada film world took off with a hugely successful thriller Idu Saadhya in 1989. The movie, featuring eight stars, was actually made on a shoestring budget of just 1.5 million INR and shot at a single location within 48 hours.https://web.archive.org/web/20080214153031/http://www.cscsarchive.org/MediaArchive/art.nsf/(docid)/E9447519F20B26DF65256941001E4B68?OpenDocument It set a Guinness record of fastest completion of an Indian film. A drama theatre where the film was shot mingles into the theme and almost becomes a character of the movie. Idhu Sadhya became a trend setter because of its brilliant direction, screenplay and cinematography. His inspiration for this film came from the theme of Michele Soavi's Deliria (film). (Stagefright) must also have been an influencing factor for this film. Suprabhatha is another major success of Dinesh Baboo. The story revolves around a single location, this time, a gas filling station. A film with Super Star Dr.Vishnuvardhan and Suhasini, became a box office looter creating many records and gave a major boost to the career of Dinesh babu. As a director, his craftsmanship has been lauded by columnists and reviewers. ===Actor=== He is appearing in front of camera for the first time as a Police officer in the film Accident which is Directed by Ramesh Aravind. ==Personal life== Dinesh Baboo had a failed marriage and had divorced his first wife. He married his assistant director Chethana in 2010. ==Filmography== ===Films=== ;Cinematographer only {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\" !
