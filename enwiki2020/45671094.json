    "text": "The Constitution of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, officially titled Charter of the Social Contract, is the provisional constitution of the self-proclaimed autonomous region of Syria known as the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria. It was adopted on 29 January 2014, when the Democratic Union Party (PYD), claiming to represent the population of the autonomous region, declared the three regions it controls autonomous from the Syrian government. Article 12 states the autonomous region remains an \"integral part of Syria\", tentatively implementing an expected future federal Syrian governance in Northern Syria. The constitution has gained much international attention and is most noted for its explicit affirmation of minority rights and gender equality and a form of direct democracy known as 'democratic confederalism'. On 27\u201328 June 2016, the executive committee to organize a constitution for the region, to replace the 2014 constitution, presented its draft. == Background == Areas controlled and claimed by Syrian Kurds and allies (Feb. 2014). When the Syrian Civil War broke out in 2011, the Syrian Kurdish parties avoided taking sides. When Syrian government forces retreated in mid-2012 to fight the mostly Arab rebels elsewhere, Kurdish groups gradually took control. On 12 July 2012, the two main political alliances in the autonomous region, the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and the Kurdish National Council (KNC) formed Kurdish Supreme Committee (KSC) as the overarching governing body of all three self-proclaimed cantons of Afrin, Kobane and Jazira. A committee was appointed to write a transitional constitution. The PYD and its armed wing People's Protection Units (YPG) soon became the dominant force, and started establishing a one-party dominated governance in November 2013. == Contents == === Preamble === Text of the preamble: > We, the people of the Democratic Autonomous Regions of Afrin, Jazira and > Kobani, a confederation of Kurds, Arabs, Syriacs, Arameans, Turkmen, > Armenians and Chechens, freely and solemnly declare and establish this > Charter.
