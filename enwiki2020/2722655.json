    "text": "Mutant is the fifth album by Twiztid. Released on July 26, 2005, it is the second half of the Man's Myth/Mutant double album, released one month after its companion album, Man's Myth. On November 4, 2015, Twiztid announced they were remixing and remastering Mutant for a 2016 re-release. == Music and lyrics == While Man's Myth featured a hip hop-oriented sound, Mutant featured a rock oriented sound. According to Jamie Spaniolo, \"I've always wanted to do a Rock album and to date that was the closest thing to it we have ever done, so it holds a special place in my heart.\" Allrovi said that \"the sound of this album is far closer to Eminem's side of the Detroit hip-hop axis, specifically the cartoonish but musically fierce live-instruments-plus-samples sound of the best D12 tracks.\" == Reception == AllRovi wrote that Mutant was better than its predecessor, Man's Myth; AllRovi also said that Mutant is \"the best album of Twiztid's career, [...] the one on which the duo finally steps out from the shadow of their mentors the Insane Clown Posse\". == Track listing == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"center\" width=\"30\"|# !align=\"center\" width=\"150\"|Title !align=\"center\" width=\"20\"|Time !align=\"center\" width=\"100\"|Producer(s) !align=\"center\" width=\"135\"|Performer(s) |- |1 |\"The Transformation of a New Civilization\" |2:47 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky |Twiztid |- |2 |\"Get Off Of Me!\" |3:40 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky |Twiztid |- |3 |\"Stardust\" |3:56 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky |Twiztid |- |4 |\"Familiar\" |3:16 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky Monoxide |Twiztid |- |5 |\"Madness\" |3:58 |Violent J |Twiztid |- |6 |\"Fuck U Part 2\" |1:00 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky |Twiztid |- |7 |\"Jenny's A Fat Bitch\" |0:34 | |Madrox Rich |- |8 |\"Fantasy\" |3:38 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky |Twiztid |- |9 |\"Who Am I?\" |2:22 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky |Twiztid |- |10 |\"The Truth Will Set You Free\" |3:47 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky |Twiztid |- |11 |\"Respirator\" |4:03 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky |Twiztid |- |12 |\"Triple Threat\" |3:12 |Lavel |Triple Threat |- |13 |\"Starve Your Fear\" |3:01 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky |Twiztid |- |14 |\"Manakin\" |3:37 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky |Twiztid Violent J |- |15 |\"Note 2 Self\" |4:09 |Fritz \"The Cat\" Van Kosky |Twiztid |} ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\"|Chart (2005) !align=\"center\"|Peak Position |- |Billboard 200 |align=\"center\"|80 |- |Top Independent Albums |align=\"center\"|11 |- |Top Rap Albums |align=\"center\"|20 |} == References == Category:2005 albums Category:Twiztid albums Category:Rap rock albums by American artists Category:Psychopathic Records albums ",
