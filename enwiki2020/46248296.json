    "text": "The Hockey East Goaltending Champion is an annual award given out at the conclusion of the Hockey East regular season to the goaltender who held the lowest Goals Against Average (GAA) in conference games during the regular season. The Goaltending Champion was first awarded in 1985 and every year thereafter. The current record for lowest GAA against conference opponents in a season is held by Jimmy Howard of Maine with a 1.15 Goals Against Average, set during the 2003\u201304 season. Six players have won the award multiple times, with Scott King winning three times. The others, Derek Heriofsky, Michel Larocque, Ty Conklin, Matti Kaltainen and Cayden Primeau won twice. King, Larocque and Primeau managed to win the award in consecutive years. The title has twice been awarded to the goalie with the highest save percentage, rather than goals allowed average. First, in 2016\u201317 to Collin Delia of Merrimack (.928 SV%, 2.21 GAA), with Jake Oettinger of Boston University's having a GAA mark of 2.09. Again, it was awarded to Jeremy Swayman of Maine in 2019\u201320 (.934 SV%, 2.27 GAA) whereas Matt Murray of Massachusetts held a 1.88 GAA in league play. ==Award winners== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Year !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winner !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| GAA |- | 1984\u201385 || Chris Terreri || Providence || 3.49 |- | 1985\u201386 || Scott Gordon || Boston College || 3.42 |- | 1986\u201387 || Scott King || Maine || 3.06 |- | 1987\u201388 || Scott King || Maine || 2.97 |- | 1988\u201389 || David Littman || Boston College || 3.04 |- | 1989\u201390 || Scott King || Maine || 2.35 |- | 1990\u201391 || Scott LaGrand || Boston College || 3.02 |- | 1991\u201392 || Derek Heriofsky || Boston University || 2.45 |- | 1992\u201393 || Garth Snow || Maine || 2.01 |- | 1993\u201394 || Derek Heriofsky || Boston University || 2.27 |- | 1994\u201395 || Blair Allison || Maine || 2.72 |- | 1995\u201396 || Tom Noble || Boston University || 2.89 |- | 1996\u201397 || Michel Larocque || Boston University || 2.57 |- | 1997\u201398 || Michel Larocque || Boston University || 1.74 |- | 1998\u201399 || Ty Conklin || New Hampshire || 1.64 |- | 1999\u201300 || Scott Clemmensen || Boston College || 1.98 |- | 2000\u201301 || Ty Conklin || New Hampshire || 1.83 |- | 2001\u201302 || Mike Ayers || New Hampshire || 1.79 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Year !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winner !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| GAA |- | 2002\u201303 || Matti Kaltainen || Boston College || 2.20 |- | 2003\u201304 || Jimmy Howard || Maine || 1.15 |- | 2004\u201305 || Matti Kaltainen || Boston College || 1.81 |- | 2005\u201306 || Cory Schneider || Boston College || 1.96 |- | 2006\u201307 || John Curry || Boston University || 1.85 |- | 2007\u201308 || Kevin Regan || New Hampshire || 1.83 |- | 2008\u201309 || Brad Thiessen || Northeastern || 2.09 |- | 2009\u201310 || Carter Hutton || UMass Lowell || 2.35 |- | 2010\u201311 || John Muse || Boston College || 1.84 |- | 2011\u201312 || Parker Milner || Boston College || 1.85 |- | 2012\u201313 || Connor Hellebuyck || UMass Lowell || 1.38 |- | 2013\u201314 || Thatcher Demko || Boston College || 1.35 |- | 2014\u201315 || Jon Gillies || Providence || 1.74 |- | 2015\u201316 || Kevin Boyle || UMass Lowell || 1.80 |- | 2016\u201317 || Collin Delia || Merrimack || 2.21 |- | 2017\u201318 || Cayden Primeau || Northeastern || 1.79 |- | 2018\u201319 || Cayden Primeau || Northeastern || 2.12 |- | 2019\u201320 || Jeremy Swayman || Maine || 2.27 |- |} ===Winners by school=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winners |- |Boston College || 10 |- |Maine || 7 |- |Boston University || 6 |- |New Hampshire || 4 |- |Northeastern || 3 |- |UMass Lowell || 3 |- |Providence || 2 |- |Merrimack || 1 |} ==See also== *Hockey East Awards == References == === General === * * === Specific === ==External links== *Hockey East Awards (Incomplete) Category:College ice hockey trophies and awards in the United States Category:College ice hockey goaltender awards in the United States ",
