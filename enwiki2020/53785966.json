    "text": "Brian K. Horton (born March 23, 1970) is an American geologist, currently the Alexander Deussen Professor of Energy Resources at the Jackson School of Geosciences, University of Texas at Austin. He studies sedimentary geology and tectonics, with emphasis on foreland basins and fold and thrust belts. His research addresses nonmarine depositional systems (including fluvial megafans), sediment provenance, river catchment evolution, and mountain building along convergent plate margins (including the Tibetan Plateau, Zagros Mountains, and North American Cordillera), with a focus on the evolution of the Andes Mountains and Amazon Basin. Horton received the Geological Society of America Donath Medal (Young Scientist Award) in 2004, an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation fellowship in 2005-2006, and the Society for Sedimentary Geology (SEPM) William R. Dickinson Medal in 2018. He is a fellow of the Geological Society of America and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. ==References== Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:University of Texas at Austin faculty Category:University of California, Los Angeles faculty Category:Louisiana State University faculty Category:University of Arizona alumni Category:Montana State University alumni Category:University of New Mexico alumni Category:20th-century geologists Category:21st-century American geologists Category:Fellows of the Geological Society of America Category:Alexander von Humboldt Fellows ",
