    "text": "200px Wojciech Belon (March 14, 1952 in Kwidzyn \u2013 May 3, 1985 in Krak\u00f3w), also known as Wojtek Bellon, was a Polish poet, songwriter and folksinger. His best known ballad Majster Bieda (Master Poor) and most of his compositions have never been released by government controlled media which at that time was dominated by establishment approved songwriters such as Agnieszka Osiecka, though most college students and Polish youth knew them by heart from amateur tapes recorded at student and tourist festivals and similar musical events in Cracow 1974, Zielona G\u00f3ra 1985, Busko Zdr\u00f3j, Tarn\u00f3w, Gda\u0144sk. In Poland you can hear them until this very day as part of the repertoire of many bands. Belon was a symbol of youth frustration of the so-called lost generation of the late-1960s, 1970s and early-1980s in Poland. His writings were inspiring in the way Bob Dylan's songs in America were. The circumstances of his death in 1985 have never been disclosed. ==References== ==Bibliography== * SLM Ballada \u2013 biography (Polish) * Stachuriada \u2013 poetry (Polish) * \u2013 music (by a band formed originally by Belon himself) * \u2013 music (by a Boys Scouts group) Category:1952 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Polish songwriters Category:Sung poetry of Poland Category:People from Kwidzyn Category:Polish male singers Category:Polish folk singers Category:20th-century Polish poets Category:20th-century Polish singers Category:20th-century male singers ",
