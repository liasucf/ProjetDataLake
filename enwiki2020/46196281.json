    "text": "|} The Terry Biddlecombe Challenge Trophy was a Grade 2 National Hunt chase in England which was open to horses aged five years or older. It was run at Wincanton over a distance of 2 miles and 5 furlongs (4,224 metres), and was scheduled to take place each year in November. The race was named in honour of the jockey Terry Biddlecombe and was last run in 2004. It was won by some of the great names in steeplechasing during the eighties, but the races were often uncompetitive with the winner starting long odds-on. The race was awarded Grade 2 status in 1990, and the following year was renamed the Desert Orchid South Western Pattern Chase. In 1994 the race became a Limited Handicap, although it maintained its Grade 2 status. In its final year it was run as the Desert Orchid Silver Cup, a Class C Handicap, with the Grade 2 status being transferred to the Old Roan Chase at Aintree, run on the same day. There is still a race at Wincanton, now sponsored, where the winning owner receives the Desert Orchid Silver Cup. Run in October it is now run over a distance of just less than 3 miles 3 furlongs. ==Winners since 1976== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" | style=\"width:36px\" | Year | style=\"width:160px\" | Winner | style=\"width:30px\" | Age | style=\"width:180px\" | Jockey | style=\"width:180px\" | Trainer |- |1976||April Seventh||10||Andy Turnell||Bob Turnell |- |1977||Border Incident||7||John Francome||Richard Head |- |1978||Kininvie||9||Philip Hobbs||A Dunn |- |1979||Silver Buck||7||Tommy Carmody||Tony Dickinson |- |1980||Diamond Edge||9||Bill Smith||Fulke Walwyn |- |1981||Silver Buck||9||Robert Earnshaw||Michael Dickinson |- |1982||Silver Buck||10||Robert Earnshaw||Michael Dickinson |- |1983||Brown Chamberlin||8||Ben de Haan||Fred Winter |- |1984||Wayward Lad||9||Robert Earnshaw||Michael Dickinson |- |1985||The Tsarevich||9||John White||Nicky Henderson |- | 1986 | Half Free | 10 | Peter Scudamore | Fred Winter |- | 1987 | Desert Orchid | 8 | Colin Brown | David Elsworth |- | 1988 | Desert Orchid | 9 | Simon Sherwood | David Elsworth |- | 1989 | Panto Prince | 8 | Brendan Powell Snr | Chris Popham |- | 1990 | Panto Prince | 9 | Brendan Powell Snr | Chris Popham |- | 1991 | Sabin Du Loir | 12 | Peter Scudamore | Martin Pipe |- | 1992 | Remittance Man | 8 | Richard Dunwoody | Nicky Henderson |- | 1993 | Panto Prince | 12 | Simon McNeill | Chris Popham |- | 1994 | Givus A Buck | 11 | Paul Holley | David Elsworth |- | 1995 | Coulton | 8 | Richard Dunwoody | Oliver Sherwood |- | 1996 | Coulton | 9 | Jamie Osborne | Oliver Sherwood |- | 1997 | Gales Cavalier | 9 | Adrian Maguire | David Gandolfo |- | 1998 | Super Tactics | 10 | Andrew Thornton | Robert Alner |- | 1999 | No Retreat | 6 | Tony Dobbin | Steve Brookshaw |- | 2000 | Fadalko | 7 | Mick Fitzgerald | Paul Nicholls |- | 2001 | Celibate | 10 | Noel Fehily | Charlie Mann |- | 2002 | Valley Henry | 7 | Mick Fitzgerald | Paul Nicholls |- | 2003 | Edredon Bleu | 11 | Jim Culloty | Henrietta Knight |- | 2004 | Cameron Bridge | 8 | Richard Johnson | Philip Hobbs |} ==References== *Racing Post **, , , , , , , , , **, , , , , , Category:Wincanton Racecourse Category:National Hunt races in Great Britain Category:National Hunt chases Category:Discontinued horse races Category:Recurring sporting events disestablished in 2004 ",
