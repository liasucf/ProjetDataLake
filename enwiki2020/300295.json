    "text": "Dichloromethane (DCM or methylene chloride) is an organochloride compound with the formula CH2Cl2. This colorless, volatile liquid with a chloroform-like, sweet odour is widely used as a solvent. Although it is not miscible with water, it is polar, and miscible with many organic solvents.Rossberg, M. et al. (2006) \"Chlorinated Hydrocarbons\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . ==Occurrence== Natural sources of dichloromethane include oceanic sources, macroalgae, wetlands, and volcanoes. However, the majority of dichloromethane in the environment is the result of industrial emissions. ==Production== DCM is produced by treating either chloromethane or methane with chlorine gas at 400\u2013500 \u00b0C. At these temperatures, both methane and chloromethane undergo a series of reactions producing progressively more chlorinated products. In this way, an estimated 400,000 tons were produced in the US, Europe, and Japan in 1993. :CH4 \\+ Cl2 \u2192 CH3Cl + HCl :CH3Cl + Cl2 \u2192 CH2Cl2 \\+ HCl :CH2Cl2 \\+ Cl2 \u2192 CHCl3 \\+ HCl :CHCl3 \\+ Cl2 \u2192 CCl4 \\+ HCl The output of these processes is a mixture of chloromethane, dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride as well as hydrogen chloride as a byproduct. These compounds are separated by distillation. DCM was first prepared in 1839 by the French chemist Henri Victor Regnault (1810\u20131878), who isolated it from a mixture of chloromethane and chlorine that had been exposed to sunlight.Regnault, V. (1839) \"De l'action du chlore sur les \u00e9thers hydrochloriques de l'alcool et de l'esprit de bois, et de plusieurs points de la th\u00e9orie des \u00e9thers\" (On the action of chlorine on the hydrochloric ethers of ethanol and methanol, and on several points of the theory of ethers), Annales de chimie et physique, series 2, 71 : 353\u2013431; see especially: \"Seconde partie. De l'action du chlore sur l'\u00e9ther hydrochlorique de l'esprit de bois\" (Second part. On the action of chlorine on the hydrochloric ether of methanol [i.e., chloromethane]), pages 377\u2013380. Regnault gives dichloromethane the name \u00e9ther hydrochlorique monochlorur\u00e9 (monochlorinated hydrochloric ether). Note: Regnault gives the empirical formula for dichloromethane as C2H4Cl4 because during that era, chemists used incorrect atomic masses. Reprinted in German in: * See p. 328. * See p. 210. ==Uses== DCM's volatility and ability to dissolve a wide range of organic compounds makes it a useful solvent for many chemical processes. In the food industry, it has been used to decaffeinate coffee and tea as well as to prepare extracts of hops and other flavorings. Its volatility has led to its use as an aerosol spray propellant and as a blowing agent for polyurethane foams. ===Hydrogen bonding=== Methylene chloride is a Lewis acid that can hydrogen bond to electron donors. It is classified as a hard acid and is included in the ECW model. It is a solvent that has been used in many thermodynamic studies of donor-acceptor bonding. The donor hydrogen-bonding corrections of methylene chloride in these thermodynamic studies has been reported. The E&C; parameters used in this paper are older parameters. Improved E&C; parameters are listed in ECW model ===Specialized uses=== Near IR absorption spectrum of dichloromethane showing complicated overlapping overtones of mid IR absorption features. The chemical compound's low boiling point allows the chemical to function in a heat engine that can extract mechanical energy from small temperature differences. An example of a DCM heat engine is the drinking bird. The toy works at room temperature. It is also used as the fluid in Christmas lights that have the colored bubbling tube above a lamp as a source of heat and a small amount of rock salt to provide thermal mass and a nucleation site for the phase changing solvent. DCM chemically welds certain plastics. For example, it is used to seal the casing of electric meters. Often sold as a main component of plastic welding adhesives, it is also used extensively by model building hobbyists for joining plastic components together. It is commonly referred to as \"Di-clo.\" It is used in the garment printing industry for removal of heat-sealed garment transfers, and its volatility is exploited in novelty items: bubble lights and jukebox displays. DCM is used in the material testing field of civil engineering; specifically it is used during the testing of bituminous materials as a solvent to separate the binder from the aggregate of an asphalt or macadam to allow the testing of the materials. Dichloromethane extract of Asparagopsis taxiformis, a seaweed fodder for cattle, has been found to reduce their methane emissions by 79%. It is also the principal component of paint stripper, although replacements exist. ==Toxicity== Even though DCM is the least toxic of the simple chlorohydrocarbons, it has serious health risks. Its high volatility makes it an acute inhalation hazard. It can also be absorbed through the skin. Symptoms of acute overexposure to dichloromethane via inhalation include difficulty concentrating, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headaches, numbness, weakness, and irritation of the upper respiratory tract and eyes. More severe consequences can include suffocation, loss of consciousness, coma, and death. DCM is also metabolized by the body to carbon monoxide potentially leading to carbon monoxide poisoning. Acute exposure by inhalation has resulted in optic neuropathy and hepatitis. Prolonged skin contact can result in DCM dissolving some of the fatty tissues in skin, resulting in skin irritation or chemical burns. It may be carcinogenic, as it has been linked to cancer of the lungs, liver, and pancreas in laboratory animals. Other animal studies showed breast cancer and salivary gland cancer. Research is not yet clear as to what levels may be carcinogenic. DCM crosses the placenta. Fetal toxicity in women who are exposed to it during pregnancy, however, has not been proven. In animal experiments, it was fetotoxic at doses that were maternally toxic but no teratogenic effects were seen. In people with pre-existing heart problems, exposure to DCM can cause abnormal heart rhythms and/or heart attacks, sometimes without any other symptoms of overexposure. People with existing liver, nervous system, or skin problems may worsen after exposure to methylene chloride. ===Regulation=== In many countries, products containing DCM must carry labels warning of its health risks. In February 2013, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health warned that at least 14 bathtub refinishers have died since 2000 from DCM exposure. These workers had been working alone, in poorly ventilated bathrooms, with inadequate or no respiratory protection, and no training about the hazards of DCM.OSHA QuickTakes, February 1, 2013; OSHA has since then issued a DCM standard.Methylene Chloride. Occupational Safety & Health Administration. osha.gov In the European Union, the European Parliament voted in 2009 to ban the use of DCM in paint-strippers for consumers and many professionals.\"EU Banning Most DCM Paint Strippers,\" PaintSquare News, retrieved 1/5/14. The ban took effect in December 2010. In Europe, the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values (SCOEL) recommends for DCM an occupational exposure limit (8 h time-weighted average) of 100 ppm and a short-term exposure limit (15 min) of 200 ppm. Concerns about its health effects have led to a search for alternatives in many of these applications. On March 15, 2019, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule to prohibit the manufacture (including importing and exporting), processing, and distribution of methylene chloride in all paint removers for consumer use, effective in 180 days however it does not affect other products containing methylene chloride including many consumer products not intended for paint removal . ==Environmental effects== ===Ozone=== Dichloromethane is not classified as an ozone-depleting substance by the Montreal Protocol. The U.S. Clean Air Act does not regulate dichloromethane as an ozone depleter. According to the EPA, the atmospheric lifetime of dichloromethane is very short, such that the substance decomposes before reaching the ozone layer. Ozone concentrations measured at the midlatitudes from the ground up through the stratosphere from 1998 to 2016 have declined by 2.2 Dobson units. The reasons for this decline are unclear, but one unverified hypothesis is the presence of short-lived substances such as dichloromethane in the lower atmosphere. ==See also== *Chloromethane *Trichloromethane *Tetrachloromethane *List of chemical compounds *List of organic compounds *Carbon monoxide- releasing molecules ==References== ==External links== * * * National Pollutant Inventory \u2013 Dichloromethane Fact Sheet * Dichloromethane at National Toxicology Program * IARC Summaries & Evaluations Vol. 71 (1999) * Canadian Environmental Protection Act Priority Substances List Assessment Report *Organic Compounds Database *Sustainable uses and Industry recommendations Category:Chloroalkanes Category:Halomethanes Category:Aerosol propellants Category:Hazardous air pollutants Category:Refrigerants Category:Halogenated solvents Category:IARC Group 2A carcinogens Category:Fetotoxicants Category:Testicular toxicants Category:Halogen-containing natural products Category:GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators Category:Climate change mitigation ",
