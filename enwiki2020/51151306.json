Through history, the street bore the following names: * 1870s-1920, Schule stra\u00dfe (School street); * 1920-1940, Father Stanis\u0142aw Konarski street;Plan Miasta Bydgoszczy, 1933 * 1940-1945, Schule stra\u00dfe;Stadt Bauamt, Bromberg, 10 VII 1941 * Since 1945, Father Stanis\u0142aw Konarski street.

Despite the high tuition fee, the edifice was too large and exceeded the needs. Hence, the school was split in 1909-1911 into an urban high school, a four-year teachers' college and a two- year school for educators nurseries and kindergartens (). In these schools, most of the students were from German origin. In 1920, the building housed the Faculty for girls, as men's one was located in the same street at N\u00b02. In 1928, this girls institution received the patron name of Maria Konopnicka. Despite its success (719 pupils in 1925), the 1932 new education system put an end to the university: in 1935, the facility was combined with men's high school and moved to a building at Chwytowo street 16.
