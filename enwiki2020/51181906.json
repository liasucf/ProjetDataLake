The architecture of the building was similar to buildings of the Soviet period. Hospital tr\u0451hluchevoy was designed in a star shape, with branchings at the ends. The three wings of the building came together in the middle, the side parts form three courtyards, with porches. Next to the main building was an annex housing the pathology department. Due to the unfinished construction in some places there were only fragments of walls and floors. The basements were also flooded. According to one story construction was halted due to a lack of funding. Another story states shortcomings of the project prevented it from being completed. According to an old map of Moscow in 1952, the hospital was to be built by the river Likhoborka and surrounding wetlands. Sewage treatment facilities were located nearby. The abandoned building was well known among fans of urban legends as one of the most mystical places in Moscow. Among urban explorers, the hospital became known as \"The Umbrella\"' for its shape. It was similar to both the Umbrella Corporation logo from the video game and film series Resident Evil and the biohazard symbol. == History == Construction of the hospital began in 1980 and was suspended in 1985. Since then, the building was unfinished and dilapidated until its demolition in 2018. The hospital was designed to have a capacity of 1300 beds. The building was built in the style of brutalism. Since the mid-1980s, the hospital was a frequent place for urban explorers to visit. It was also a popular spot for industrial climbers.\u0425\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 yurgaforum.ru\u0425\u0417\u0411, \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430, 27 \u043c\u0430\u044f 2011 There are also urban legends about the ghosts of hospital staff, satanists,\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430: \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u041a\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438\u043d \u2014 \u00ab\u0425\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0414\u044c\u044f\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0442\u0430\u00bb the homeless and other criminal elements.
