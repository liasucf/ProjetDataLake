    "text": "The Fort de Bois l'Abb\u00e9, or Fort Poniatowski, is part of the fortifications of \u00c9pinal, France. It was built near the village of Uxegney between 1883 and 1885. It is an example of a S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system fortification. It escaped significant alteration in the years prior to World War I and is maintained as a museum. ==Description== The Fort de Bois l'Abb\u00e9 stands to the east of its larger neighbor, the Fort d'Uxegney, at an altitude of . Its stone construction provides an excellent example of an un-modified S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res position. The four-sided fort is somewhat smaller than the Fort d'Uxegney, with caponiers defending the protective ditch in lieu of the more modern counterscarps of Uxegney. It was constructed in 1884-1885 to watch the road from Dom\u00e8vre-sur-Axi\u0117re. A program of reinforcement was proposed in 1911, but never pursued. Original armament comprised four 120mm guns and two 90mm guns, with additional smaller arms. It was upgraded with 75mm anti-aircraft guns in 1915, while the larger guns had been removed. The fort lost strategic importance as it became clear that its views were obstructed by the Bois de Souche. A number of smaller positions were built in the Bois de Souche in lieu of improving the main fort. These were not completed at the time of mobilization in 1914. Between 1900 and 1906 infantry shelters of a spiral queue de cochon or \"pig's tail design were installed around the fort. In 1913-14 the fort received electricity, fed from the local power grid. The fort served as a central bakery, providing bread to the Fort d'Uxegney and the Fort de la Grande Haye. ==History== Interior of caponier at Fort de Bois l'Abb\u00e9 The Fort de Bois de l'Abb\u00e9 saw no action during World War I, as the Germans did not advance into the area around \u00c9pinal. Concrete platforms were placed on the surface of the fort for 75mm anti-aircraft guns following the aerial bombardment of \u00c9pinal, but the guns were never installed. Between World War I and World War II the fort remained military property and was used as an ammunition depot. During World War II the Germans used Bois l'Abb\u00e9 to house occupying forces and continued to use it for ammunition storage. The French army maintained an ammunition depot at the Fort de Bois l'Abb\u00e9 until 1960. It was used after 1960 by private tenants, but was restored by the ' (ARFUPE) beginning in 1995. The fort may be visited on special occasions. ==References== ==External links== *Site de l'Association pour la Restauration du Fort d'Uxegney et de la Place d'Epinal *Fort de Bois l'Abb\u00e9 at fortiffsere.fr Category:S\u00e9r\u00e9 de Rivi\u00e8res system Category:Fortifications of \u00c9pinal Category:World War I museums in France Category:Ammunition dumps ",
