    "text": "The 1966 Canadian Football League season was the league's ninth season since the 1958 merger of the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union and the Western Interprovincial Football Union to create a national league. ==CFL news in 1966== The Canadian Football League made several rule changes. The league started to legalize unlimited blocking on rushing plays and introduced their new goose-necked goal posts. The league rewrote its rule book and reduced it in size. The Canadian Rugby Union, owners of the trophy, granted trusteeship of the Grey Cup to the Canadian Football League in exchange for annual financial support for amateur football. One of the more notable games of the regular season was Montreal's 1\u20130 victory over Ottawa, the lowest scoring game in CFL history, and only the second 1\u20130 game since a 1949 win by Winnipeg over Calgary in the WIFU. ==Regular season standings== Note: GP = Games Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, PF = Points For, PA = Points Against, Pts = Points {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:1em\" |+ Western Football Conference !
