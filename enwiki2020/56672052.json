    "text": "Kimberly Daniels (born 1961/1962) is an American minister who performs exorcisms, religious author, politician, former sex worker and mother of six from Jacksonville, Florida. She is currently serving her second term as the representative for Florida House of Representatives District 14 (part of Duval County) as a member of the Democratic Party, but recently lost her party's primary election to Angie Nixon. ==Early life== Daniels is a graduate of Florida State University where she obtained a bachelor's degree in Criminology. Daniels has a master's degree in Christian Education and a Doctorate in Christian Counseling from Jacksonville Theological Seminary. Daniels has expressed thankfulness to God for slavery and for her time in a crackhouse, which she saw as ultimately leading to her religious conversion: \"If it wasn\u2019t for slavery, I might be somewhere in Africa worshipping a tree.\" Daniels also said, \"You can talk about the Holocaust, but the Jews own everything.\" In 2011 Daniels was elected to the Jacksonville City Council as an at-large member. On March 9, 2015, then-City Councilwoman Daniels was involved in a profanity-laced squabble with council candidate Sirretta Williams, also a local minister. Daniels and her husband Ardell were divorced in 2015/6. ==Florida House of Representatives== In March 2017, it was reported that Daniels was under investigation by the Florida Elections Commission after it found probable cause that she used campaign funds for personal expenses and later falsely reported information on finance reports. In early 2018, Daniels introduced HB 839, a bill that requires public schools to display the motto \"In God We Trust\" in a conspicuous place. On Tuesday, January 23, 2018, the bill received unanimous approval from the House PreK-12 Innovation Subcommittee. Later, in a vote on February 21, 2018, the bill passed 97 to 10 in the House. The measure was eventually adopted as law in March 2019 as part of an education bill. On August 28, 2018, Daniels defeated Paula Wright in the Democratic Party primary election for the District 14 seat. In early 2019, Daniels sponsored legislation to require schools to teach courses on the Bible. The Florida House PreK-12 Quality Subcommittee approved the measure. Daniels championed a $1 million-dollar contract for SCLC World Wide, run by Reverend Gary Johnson. In the summer of 2019, Florida Department of Juvenile Justice sued SCLC World Wide for not delivering on its commitments. The following day, Daniels was sued by a former staffer, Karen Riggien, who claimed to have been wrongfully fired in February 2018 in connection with interactions with Gary Johnson, a man Riggien described as Daniels' boyfriend. On July 23, 2019, the Freedom from Religion Foundation wrote to Representative Daniels requesting that she stop blocking users on Facebook. Daniels' book Breaking the Power of Familiar Spirits is a class textbook at Jacksonville Theological Seminary. On August 18, 2020, Daniels lost renomination in the Democratic primary election to Angie Nixon.https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/politics/elections/state/2020/08/18/angie- nixon-ousts-kimberly-daniels-florida-house-district-14-seat/5600765002/ ==Authored works== * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==References== ==External links== *Apostle Kimberly Daniels Ministries International *BREAKING THE POWER OF FAMILIAR SPIRITS by Kim Daniels Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women writers Category:21st-century American women politicians Category:African-American state legislators in Florida Category:African-American women in politics Category:African-American women writers Category:Christian writers Category:Florida Democrats Category:Florida State University alumni Category:Living people Category:Jacksonville, Florida City Council members Category:Members of the Florida House of Representatives Category:Women state legislators in Florida Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Women city councillors in the United States Category:American prostitutes Category:American exorcists Category:American women writers ",
