Georgians live scattered throughout Turkey, although they are concentrated on two major regions of residence: * Black Sea coast, in the provinces Giresun, Ordu, Samsun, and Sinop, with extension to Amasya and Tokat. Chveneburi, particularly in Fatsa, \u00dcnye, Ordu, Terme, and \u00c7ar\u015famba, largely preserve their language and traditions. * Northwestern Turkey, in the provinces D\u00fczce, Sakarya, Yalova, Kocaeli, Bursa, and Bal\u0131kesir. Magnarella estimated the number of Georgians in Turkey to have been over 60,000 in 1979.Peter A. Andrews & R\u00fcdiger Benninghaus (1989), Ethnic Groups in the Republic of Turkey, Vol. 1, p. 174. Reichert, . == Imerkhevians == Imerkhevians (Shavshetians) are an ethnographic subgroup of Georgians who speak the Imerkhevian dialect (imerkheuli) of the Georgian language, which shares many common features with the neighboring Adjarian.Tuite, Kevin (1998), Kartvelian morphosyntax: number agreement and morphosyntactic oritntation in the South Caucasian languages, p. 178. Lincom Europa. Imerkhevians are indigenous population of Artvin Province. The majority of the Imerkhevians today live in an area they call Imerkhevi, the name of the cultural region traditionally inhabited by the Imerkhevian. The population of Imerkhevi is largely composed of ethnic Georgians, who inhabit 14 hamlets around Meydanc\u0131k, formerly known as Diobani. These settlements have both official Turkish and unofficial Georgian names. Reflecting some internal differentiation persisting in Turkey's Georgian community, the Imerkhevians claim a different origin from the Georgians in the Bor\u00e7ka area, who have adopted an inclusive Adjar identity. The Imerkhevians are Sunni Muslims, closely integrated with the Turkish society. Almost all are bilingual in Georgian and Turkish. == Chveneburi == Chveneburi had arrived in Turkey basically in three waves of migration due to pogroms and what is now termed ethnic cleansing of Caucasians by the Russian Empire. The first wave was during and after the Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829 when the Sublime Porte consigned its sovereignty over several parts of Georgia to the Russian Empire. Minor immigrations had also followed until the end of Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878 when Ottoman Empire allowed Chveneburis to immigrate, the major wave of immigration involved at least 500,000 people from historic Georgian regions that had considerable Muslim populations such as Batumi and Kars. This wave of being muhajirs, known as muhajiroba (\u10db\u10e3\u10f0\u10d0\u10ef\u10d8\u10e0\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0) had left many Muslim-majority regions of Georgia virtually depopulated. The last sizable wave of immigration was in 1921 when Turkey finally gave up its claims on Adjara in the Treaty of Kars with the Soviet republics. This last wave also involved Turkish-speaking Muslims from Upper Adjara. Adjarians were also known by their places of origin, such as Batumlular for people from Batumi, \u00c7\u00fcr\u00fcksulular for people from Kobuleti.Ali Pasha of \u00c7\u00fcr\u00fcksu (front row, middle) and Ottoman Georgians during the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378). At the end of the war, the re- settlement of Ottoman Georgians in Fatsa was supervised by Ali Pasha.BERAT YILDIZ, EMIGRATIONS FROM THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TO THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE: AN ANALYSIS IN THE LIGHT OF THE NEW ARCHIVAL MATERIALS, BILKENT UNIVERSITYChveneburi (, ), meaning \"of us\" in Georgian, is an autonym of Muslim immigrants of Georgian descent who had settled in non-Georgian majority regions of Turkey, thus, \"of us\" signifies a triple distinction from Christian Georgians, Muslim Turks, and autochthonous Muslim Georgians from Artvin. As with most Turkish citizens, most Chveneburi subscribe to the Hanafi madh'hab of Sunni Islam. === Press === The most important Georgian cultural magazine in Turkey also bears the name \u00c7veneburi. It was founded in 1977 in Stockholm, Sweden by Shalva Tevzadze. It is distributed in Turkey by Ahmet \u00d6zkan Melashvili, who also wrote the book G\u00fcrc\u00fcstan (Georgia) in 1968. In 1980, \u00d6zkan was assassinated in Bursa by the Grey Wolves.. Since then, Fahrettin \u00c7ilo\u011flu has been in charge of the magazine (1993). Between 1997 and 2006, Osman Nuri Mercan was the editor of the magazine. The magazine's content is almost completely in Turkish and presents articles on Chveneburi as well as the present situation and the history of Georgia and Georgians worldwide. Another journal, Pirosmani, bilingual in Georgian and Turkish, is published in Istanbul, sponsored by theGeorgian Catholic Simon Zazadze. === Group identity === Group identity is shaped basically by the schism with Christian Georgians. Chveneburi usually restrain from using the word Kartveli (\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10d8) as a self-designation because they think it indicates being a Christian. They prefer to use Gurji (G\u00fcrc\u00fc) (\u10d2\u10e3\u10e0\u10ef\u10d8) when referring to their more precise ethnic background. Intermarriage with other Sunni groups is common. In some regions, specifically \u00dcnye for instance, Chveneburi women are sought-after brides, seen by the local rural Turkish population as beautiful and hard-working wives. This phenomenon further accelerates cultural and linguistic assimilation of the community. == Laz people == Laz people are an indigenous Kartvelian-speaking ethnic group inhabiting the Black Sea coastal regions of Turkey and Georgia.1 Minorsky, V. \"Laz.\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E . Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2010. Estimates of the total population of the Laz people today vary drastically, with numbers as low as 45,000 to as high as 1.6 million people, with the majority living in northeast Turkey. The Laz speak the Laz language, a member of the same Kartvelian language family as Georgian, Svan, and Mingrelian.BRAUND, D., Georgia in antiquity: a history of Colchis and Transcaucasian Iberia 550 BC \u2013 AD 562, Oxford University Press, p. 93 == See also == *Georgia\u2013Turkey relations *Peoples of the Caucasus in Turkey *Islam in Georgia *Adjarians *Pontic Greeks *Hamshenis *Iranian Georgians == References == == Bibliography == * Black Sea: Encyclopedic Dictionary (\u00d6zhan \u00d6zt\u00fcrk.
