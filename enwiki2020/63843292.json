Haber is credited with expanding the library\u2019s focus on women's social history to include food- related books and cookbooks, as well as fiction and memoirs, despite critics that were originally against it. She has authored and co-written books on subjects related to culinary history. == Life and career == Haber was born and raised in Milwaukee. In 1968, she began a part-time job at a then-small women's history library, the Schlesinger Library. For over 30 years, Haber curated books and organized events at the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at Harvard University. During her time at Schlesinger, she expanded the library's collection from 8,000 to about 80,000 books\u201416,000 of which were food-related books or cookbooks. Her addition of cookbooks to the library was initially controversial. The debate on whether cookbooks should have a substantial role in the library's collection started in 1943, and up until the late 1980s, the library generally did not allow the purchase of cookbooks. Critics were concerned about adding cookbooks to a feminist library. Speaking about the controversy, Haber said, \"For some reason, cooking, more than any other household chore\u2026 was the symbol of the patriarchy.\" In the early 1990s, culinary history was not seriously considered as an academic subject. During that time, however, Haber was a supporter of creating academic studies on the role of food in culture and establishing more formal degrees on subjects like \"Culinary History\". In 1989, Julia Child added to the library's collection, donating 500 rare cookbooks from the American Institute of Wine and Food. In 1997, the James Beard Foundation honored Haber with a Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America award. Her 2002 book, Hardtack to Home Fries: An Uncommon History of American Cooks and Meals, drew on materials in the Schlesinger Library to explore a range of culinary history topics, including its connection to society, politics, and economics. Haber retired from the Schlesinger Library in 2003 to pursue writing full-time. With Arlene Voski Avakian, Haber co-authored From Betty Crocker to Feminist Food Studies, a culinary history book published in 2005. In 2005, Haber joined the James Beard Foundation awards board of governors. She later became a Committee Chair of the Who\u2019s Who of Food and Beverage in America. ==Works== *Women in America: A Guide to Books, 1963-1975 (1981) *Hardtack to Homefries: An Uncommon History of American Cooks and Meals (2002) \\- *From Betty Crocker to Feminist Food Studies (2005, with Arlene Voski Avakian) ==References== Category:Writers from Milwaukee Category:Harvard University staff Category:21st-century American women writers Category:American food writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ",
