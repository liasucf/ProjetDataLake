CUSM received preliminary LCME accreditation in February 2018, and will enroll students for classes conferring an M.D. degree beginning July 2018. The new CUSM university has two lecture halls, nine college rooms, 15 clinical skills rooms and three labs. More than 2,200 applied to CUSM's inaugural class. The California University of Science and Medicine currently is affiliated with Arrowhead Regional Medical Center as the primary teaching hospital. CUSM is one of the newer medical schools in the nation. It is a world class medical university established as a public-private partnership to focus on the critical shortage of physicians, address the needs of underserved areas, improve health disparities and population health in the Inland Empire in California. CUSM has great support and was made possible because of Prime Healthcare Foundation, Arrowhead Regional Medical Center and the County of San Bernardino. CUSM takes a different approach in medical school training and focuses on a new kind of physician leader, one who is committed to providing health care in underserved communities where there is a continuing amount of physician shortages. San Bernardino County has only 34.5 primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, going under the benchmark of 60 to 80 doctors per 100,000. CUSM aims to fulfill its commitment to increase the quality of health care in the Inland Empire by training talented students and inspiring them to give back to the local community or to other underserved areas across the world. The majority of the students in the class of 2023 (70%) comes from California. == References == Category:Medical schools in California Category:Educational institutions established in 2018 Category:Private universities and colleges in California ",
