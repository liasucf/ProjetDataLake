    "text": "Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is a procedure that involves placement of an endovascular balloon in the aorta to control bleeding, augment afterload and maintain blood pressure temporarily in traumatic hemorrhagic shock. REBOA is considered a minimally-invasive alternative to thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamping (ACC). ==Methods== The technique involves inserting a small balloon directly into the patient's aorta and inflating it. The balloon blocks the artery and temporarily stops the blood flow giving doctors time to operate. It maintains blood circulation in the brain and heart. However, the parts of the body below the balloon are cut off from the normal blood flow and this may result in short- or longer-term problems. ==References== Category:Bleeding Category:Medical emergencies Category:Interventional radiology ",
