Born in Coanwood in Northumberland, Shield became a coal miner before winning election as a checkweighman. A supporter of the Labour Party, he was elected to Northumberland County Council, and also served as a magistrate. At the 1922 election, he stood unsuccessfully in the Conservative- held Hexham constituency in Northumberland, coming third with 24% of the votes. Shield did not stand again until 1929, when he was elected as Member of Parliament for the Wansbeck constituency at a by-election on 13th February, and returned at the 1929 election. He was defeated at the 1931 election by the Conservative candidate Bernard Cruddas, and did not stand again. == References == * * Category:1876 births Category:1935 deaths Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Miners' Federation of Great Britain- sponsored MPs Category:UK MPs 1924\u20131929 Category:UK MPs 1929\u20131931 ",
