    "text": "In mathematics, specifically in category theory, a semi-abelian category is a pre-abelian category in which the induced morphism \\overline{f}:\\operatorname{coim}f\\rightarrow\\operatorname{im}f is a bimorphism, i.e., a monomorphism and an epimorphism, for every morphism f. ==Properties== The two properties used in the definition can be characterized by several equivalent conditions.Kopylov et. al., 2012. Every semi-abelian category has a maximal exact structure. If a semi-abelian category is not quasi-abelian, then the class of all kernel-cokernel pairs does not form an exact structure. ==Examples== Every quasi-abelian category is semi-abelian. In particular, every abelian category is semi-abelian. Non quasi-abelian examples are the following. * The category of (possibly non Hausdorff) bornological spaces is semi-abelian.Bonet et. al., 2004/2005.Sieg et. al., 2011, Example 4.1.Rump, 2011, p. 44. * Let Q be the quiver \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & \\xrightarrow{} & 2 & \\xleftarrow{} & 3 \\\\\\ \\downarrow{} & & \\downarrow{}& & \\downarrow{}\\\\\\ 4 & \\xrightarrow{} & 5 & \\xleftarrow{} & 6\\\\\\ \\end{array} and k be a field. The category of finitely generated projective modules over the algebra kQ is semi-abelian.Rump, 2008, p. 993. ==History== The concept of a semi-abelian category was developed in the 1960s. Raikov conjectured that the notion of a quasi-abelian category is equivalent to that of a semi-abelian category. Around 2005 it turned out that the conjecture is false.Rump, 2011, p. 44f. ==Left and right semi-abelian categories== By dividing the two conditions on the induced map in the definition, one can define left semi- abelian categories by requiring that \\overline{f} is a monomorphism for each morphism f. Accordingly, right quasi-abelian categories are pre-abelian categories such that \\overline{f} is an epimorphism for each morphism f.Rump, 2001. If a category is left semi-abelian and right quasi-abelian, then it is already quasi-abelian. The same holds, if the category is right semi-abelian and left quasi-abelian.Rump, 2001. == Citations == == References == * Jos\u00e9 Bonet, J., Susanne Dierolf, The pullback for bornological and ultrabornological spaces.
