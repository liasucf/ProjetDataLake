    "text": "The nullity theorem is a mathematical theorem about the inverse of a partitioned matrix, which states that the nullity of a block in a matrix equals the nullity of the complementary block in its inverse matrix. Here, the nullity is the dimension of the kernel. The theorem was proven in an abstract setting by , and for matrices by . Partition a matrix and its inverse in four submatrices: : \\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} E & F \\\\\\ G & H \\end{bmatrix}. The partition on the right- hand side should be the transpose of the partition on the left-hand side, in the sense that if A is an m-by-n block then E should be an n-by-m block. The statement of the nullity theorem is now that the nullities of the blocks on the right equal the nullities of the blocks on the left : : \\begin{align} \\operatorname{nullity} \\, A &= \\operatorname{nullity} \\, H, \\\\\\ \\operatorname{nullity} \\, B &= \\operatorname{nullity} \\, F, \\\\\\ \\operatorname{nullity} \\, C &= \\operatorname{nullity} \\, G, \\\\\\ \\operatorname{nullity} \\, D &= \\operatorname{nullity} \\, E. \\end{align} More generally, if a submatrix is formed from the rows with indices {i1, i2, \u2026, im} and the columns with indices {j1, j2, \u2026, jn}, then the complementary submatrix is formed from the rows with indices {1, 2, \u2026, N} \\ {j1, j2, \u2026, jn} and the columns with indices {1, 2, \u2026, N} \\ {i1, i2, \u2026, im}, where N is the size of the whole matrix. The nullity theorem states that the nullity of any submatrix equals the nullity of the complementary submatrix of the inverse. == References == * . * . * . Category:Matrix theory ",
