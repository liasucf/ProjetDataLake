    "text": "Joseph Louis Bernardin (April 2, 1928 \u2013 November 14, 1996) was an American Cardinal of the Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Cincinnati from 1972 until 1982, and as Archbishop of Chicago from 1982 until his death in 1996 from pancreatic cancer. Bernardin was elevated to the cardinalate in 1983 by Pope John Paul II. == Biography == Joseph Bernardin was born on April 2, 1928, in Columbia, South Carolina, to Joseph and Maria Simion Bernardin, an Italian immigrant couple. He was baptized and confirmed at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Columbia. His father died of cancer when Bernardin was six. He took responsibility for his younger sister, Elaine, while his widowed mother worked as a seamstress. Bernardin's original academic ambition was to become a physician, inspiring him to enroll in the pre-medical program at the University of South Carolina. He then transferred to Saint Mary Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy in 1948, and subsequently enrolled in The Catholic University of America to complete his theological studies. On April 26, 1952, Bernardin was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Charleston by John J. Russell at St. Joseph Church. This diocese covers the entire state of South Carolina. During his 14-year tenure at the Diocese of Charleston, Father Bernardin served under four bishops in capacities including chancellor, vicar general, diocesan counselor, and, when the See was vacant, diocesan administrator. In 1959, Pope John XXIII named Bernardin a Papal Chamberlain with the title Very Reverend Monsignor. === Auxiliary Bishop of Atlanta === On March 9, 1966 Pope Paul VI appointed Monsignor Bernardin titular Bishop of Liguria and Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Atlanta. His episcopal consecration took place on April 26, 1966 at the hands of his mentor, the Archbishop of Atlanta, Paul Hallinan. Bernardin, only 38 years old, thus became the youngest bishop in America. From 1966 to 1968, Bishop Bernardin served as rector of the Cathedral of Christ the King in Atlanta, Georgia. According to Monsignor Kenneth Velo, a former executive aide to Bernardin and head of the Catholic Church Extension Society, it was in the predominantly Baptist American South that Bernardin learned ecumenism. === General Secretary of National Conference === In 1968, he resigned as auxiliary bishop of Atlanta to become the first General Secretary of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, a post he held until 1972. In 1969 Bishop Bernadin was instrumental in founding one of the conference's most influential and successful programs, the anti-poverty Campaign for Human Development. === Archbishop of Cincinnati === Pope Paul VI appointed Bernardin Archbishop of Cincinnati on November 21, 1972, and he was installed there December 19, 1972. Bernardin served the Metropolitan See of Cincinnati for nearly ten years. While there he appointed the first woman editor of the archdiocesan newspaper, The Catholic Telegraph. While Archbishop of Cincinnati, Bernardin was named to the Sacred Congregation of Bishops, elected to the permanent council of the Synod of Bishops, and was elected president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. He worked to improve relations between Catholics and Jews, strove for better understanding between the Catholic Church and Protestant denominations, and made pastoral visits to both Poland and Hungary. === Archbishop of Chicago === Following the death of Cardinal John Cody of Chicago, Pope John Paul II chose Archbishop Bernardin, already prominent among his fellow American bishops, to lead the Archdiocese of Chicago. He was appointed the twelfth Bishop and seventh Archbishop of Chicago on July 10, 1982. On August 25, 1982, he was formally installed in that role by the Apostolic Delegate, Pio Laghi. Bernardin found an archdiocese in disarray, its priests disheartened by years of arbitrary administration and charges of financial misconduct. \"With his patient charm and willingness to listen, Bernardin won back the confidence of the clergy and the laity....\"Death as a Friend \"Death as a Friend\", The New York Times Magazine\", December 1, 1996] === Elevation to Cardinal === In the Consistory of February 2, 1983, he was elevated to the Sacred College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II as Cardinal-Priest of Ges\u00f9 Divino Lavoratore (Jesus the Divine Worker) as his titular church. === Honorary degrees and awards === In 1989, Bernardin was awarded the F. Sadlier Dinger Award by educational publisher William H. Sadlier, Inc. The award is presented annually in recognition of an outstanding contribution to the ministry of religious education in America. In 1983, Bernardin delivered commencement addresses and received honorary degrees at the College of the Holy Cross and Notre Dame. In 1995, Bernardin was granted the University of Notre Dame's highest honor, the Laetare Medal, given in recognition of outstanding service to the Roman Catholic Church and society. Joseph Bernardin was posthumously inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State's highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1997 in the area of Religion. === Clerical abuse scandal === Bernardin implemented a policy concerning priests accused of sexual misconduct with minors. He removed more than a score of priests and established a new review board, made up primarily of lay people. Bernardin's reforms concerning this issue soon served as a model for other dioceses across the nation. Bernardin himself said in a press conference that he had been accused of sexual misconduct. Former seminarian Stephen Cook claimed to have been abused by Bernardin and another priest in the 1970s. However, Cook subsequently dropped Bernardin from his lawsuit, being no longer certain that his memories, which had emerged while he was under hypnosis, were accurate. The two later reconciled. Cook later said that he had relied on people who told him things that were not true, \"asserting that he is absolutely convinced of Bernardin's innocence\".Galloway, Paul. \"Bernardin, Ex- accuser Reconcile\", Chicago Tribune, January. 5, 1995 === Final illness === Cardinal Bernardin's Final Resting Place In June 1995, following a string of international visits and pilgrimages, Bernardin underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer. On August 30, 1996, Bernardin told his flock that the cancer had returned, was in his liver, and was inoperable. He turned over the day-to-day administration of the Archdiocese to his vicar general and auxiliary bishop, Most Rev. Raymond Goedert. Bernardin then began to focus much of his ministry on the sick, and became the \"unofficial chaplain\" to Chicago cancer patients.Feister, John Bookser. \"Cardinal Joseph L. Bernadin\", St. Anthony Messenger On September 23, Bernardin traveled to Rome to visit with Pope John Paul II and visit Assisi. It was on that trip that Bernardin made his funerary arrangements. Upon his return to Chicago, he arranged for the care for his mother, whom he visited daily at her nursing home, and the distribution of his personal possessions. Bernardin arranged for his personal papers and administrative files to be transported from the Residence and Pastoral Center to the Archdiocese of Chicago's Archives and Records Center. Two weeks before his death, he completed his best-selling book about the end of life and about his own approaching death in particular, called The Gift Of Peace, with the help of his friend and biographer Eugene Kennedy. In his final weeks, he was also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. He gave a major \"Seamless Garment of Life\" address at Georgetown University, where he received an award from and conversed with Father Leo J. O'Donovan, S.J., then Georgetown's president. He said goodbye to 800 of the diocesan and religious clergy of the Archdiocese at Holy Name Cathedral weeks before his death. On October 7, Bernardin met with the Presbyterate, and by the end of October, he withdrew from his active ministry due to his deteriorating strength. In his last days, Bernardin wrote to the United States Supreme Court against assisted suicide. On November 14, 1996, Bernardin died from pancreatic cancer at the age of 68. The funeral homily was given by his friend Reverend Monsignor Kenneth Velo. In the weeks before his death, Bernardin emphasized to the faithful and the public that he was at peace because of his life's profound reliance on God's sustaining grace in his ministry and his struggles with cancer, seeing death as \"a continuation and a friend to prepare properly for by conducting ourselves well and letting go to abandon one's self to God in the end\". He was interred in the Bishops' Mausoleum at Mt. Carmel Cemetery, Hillside, Illinois, following a Funeral Mass celebrated by his good friend, Cardinal Roger Mahony, and a wake for priests at which his good friend Father Scott Donahue spoke. == Views == === Seamless garment of life === In 1983 Bernardin developed the \"Consistent Ethic of Life\", an ethic for an age where new techniques brought new challenges to the sanctity of human life. The Consistent Ethic of Life is sometimes called the \"Seamless Garment\" (a reference to the seamless robe of Jesus at his death: John 19, 23). The Seamless Garment philosophy holds that induced abortion, capital punishment, violent war and mercy-killing (on the one hand) and social and economic justice (on the other) point to a need for consistent application of moral principles that value the sacredness of human life. He maintained that the ethic did not describe all threats to life as equal but did hold that all were related: \"A systemic vision of life seeks to expand the moral imagination of a society, not partition it into airtight categories... A consistent ethic of life seeks to present a coherent linkage among a diverse set of issues. It can and should be used to test party platforms, public policies\" and candidates for office\". === Other social issues === In 1981, Bernardin became head of the new NCCB Ad Hoc Committee on War and Peace, formed to draft a pastoral letter on nuclear proliferation. The resulting book-length letter, \"The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response\", was published in 1983. An influential statement of Catholic social teaching, the document condemns nuclear warfare and states that nuclear deterrence is \"not an adequate strategy as a long-term basis for peace; it is a transitional strategy justifiable only in conjunction with resolute determination to pursue arms control and disarmament\". In relation to his work on the nuclear question, Bernardin was featured on the front cover of a 1982 issue of Time Magazine entitled \"God and the Bomb\". Bernardin became a mediator between the diverging parties in the changing Post-Conciliar Church. In 1996, Bernardin inaugurated the Catholic Common Ground Initiative and was among the authors of its founding document \"Called to Be Catholic: Church in a Time of Peril,\" released August 12, 1996. Bernardin is also noted for his interest in the concern of young adults, which was in part evidenced by his involvement in the nascent Theology on Tap lecture movement in the early 1980s. In 1985, he told attendees of a special Theology on Tap Mass, \"If I had children of my own, they would be your age. You are very special to me and to this Archdiocese.\" The Windy City Gay Chorus performed at Bernardin's funeral, reportedly at his request. In 1985, Bernadin established an AIDS task force to determine how the Archdiocese might best care for those stricken by the AIDS crisis. In 1989, he dedicated Bonaventure House with the help of the Alexian Brothers, a residential facility for people suffering with AIDS. Bernardin was also lauded for his anti-pornography work, his leadership of the U.S. bishops, and the presidency of the Catholic Church Extension Society. In his final years, he relied heavily on the assistance of his adviser Monsignor Kenneth Velo, director of Catholic Extension. One of his final works was writing a book about his own dying, an excerpt of which served as a Newsweek magazine cover story, and which admirers saw as a lesson in dying.\"A time to reach out: in his final testament, Cardinal Bernardin urges the dying to bask in the light of others: It's hard to do alone,\" Newsweek, November 25, 1996 (Joseph Cardinal Bernardin) (Excerpt from \"The Gift of Peace') (cover story). === Interfaith relations === Bernardin promoted ecumenism. While Archbishop of Cincinnati, Bernardin engaged in interfaith dialogue with Jews, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and Lutherans. In 1984, he began the Council of Religious Leaders of Metropolitan Chicago, the successor group to the Chicago Conference on Religion and Race, and was the council's first president. Under Bernardin, the Archdiocese of Chicago established covenants with the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago in 1986 and with the Metropolitan Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in 1989. Bernardin attended the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1993. In 1995, he led an interfaith pilgrimage to the Holy Land to meet with government and religious leaders in Israel and Palestine and promote peace. Bernardin condemned violence in Lebanon, Israel, and Northern Ireland and called for the Catholic Church to become a \"peace church\". == Legacy == Joseph Bernardin was an influential figure in the Catholic Church in the United States following the Second Vatican Council; George Weigel called him \"arguably the most powerful Catholic prelate in American history\". Two Catholic schools in the Archdiocese of Chicago were named after him: the Cardinal Joseph Bernardin School in Orland Hills, Illinois,Cardinal Joseph Bernardin School, Orland Hills, Illinois and the Cardinal Bernardin Early Childhood Center. Loyola University of Chicago's Cancer Treatment Center is named the \"Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center.\" In his hometown of Columbia, South Carolina, at the church of his Baptism and Confirmation, St. Peter's, consecrated the Cardinal Bernadin Center; and the University of South Carolina established the annual \"Joseph Cardinal Bernardin Lecture\" in 1999. Cardinal Bernardin Way in Chicago is named after him. Catholic Theological Union (CTU) in Chicago is home to the Bernardin Center for Theology and Ministry, which hosts Bernardin's Catholic Common Ground Initiative (CCGI). The U.S. bishops' Catholic Campaign for Human Development (CCHD) established for youth achievers the Cardinal Joseph Bernardin New Leadership Award. ==See also== * Catholic Church in the United States * Historical list of the Catholic bishops of the United States * Italians in Chicago * List of Catholic bishops of the United States * Lists of patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops == References == ==Sources== *Millies, Steven P.
