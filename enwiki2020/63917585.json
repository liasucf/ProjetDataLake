    "text": "Calvin Datze Sun (born November 20, 1986) is an American emergency room doctor. He is the founder and CEO of the travel company, The Monsoon Diaries. Sun is notable for his first-hand reporting on the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City emergency rooms. ==Early life and education== Sun was born in New York City. His parents came from China separately, meeting in New York City. His father came via Taiwan, but was from the Hunan region of China. In 2006, after Sun's father died from a heart attack, Sun discovered a camera lens, which inspired him to travel and take pictures using the lens. Sun's mother has Parkinson's disease. In 2004, Sun graduated from Trinity School cum laude. During high school he also attended Manhattan School of Music where he studied piano. In 2008, Sun graduated with a B.A. in biochemistry on a pre-med track from Columbia University. While at sophomore at Columbia, Sun was a research assistant to molecular biologist Dr. Richard Axel at the Columbia University Medical Center. In 2014, Sun received an M.D. from SUNY Downstate College of Medicine where he specialized in emergency medicine and completed four years of residency at Jacobi/Montefiore Emergency Medicine Residency Program of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. ==Career== ===Medicine=== Sun works as an attending physician and clinical assistant professor in Emergency Medicine at multiple emergency departments in the New York City area. ====COVID-19==== During the COVID-19 pandemic, Sun is working as a per diem emergentologist, rotating among different hospitals in New York City during the height of the early days of the pandemic. During this time, Sun did first person reporting of his experiences and his thoughts on how the disease manifests itself on his Instagram. He also gave many interviews to media outlets in the United States and abroad, and with interviewers like Katy Tur from MSNBC, Willie Geist from The TODAY Show In his interview with Katie Couric, he likened working on the front-lines of the pandemic to being like going to war every day. Sun discussed his initial concerns with national shortages of ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE), issues with cross-contamination in crowded ER rooms, the importance of testing and staying home in the interest of public safety. Both of Sun's grandparents (who lived separately from him) contracted COVID-19 within their communities where his grandfather died of the disease shortly after contracting the virus. ===The Monsoon Diaries=== The Great Pyramids, Winter 2019 In 2010 while beginning medical school, Sun began to document his international travels in an online photo blog called The Monsoon Diaries. In 2011, Sun traveled to North Korea where he was one of the first foreigners to photograph and document his experience of accidentally discovering the mysterious hidden 5th floor of the Yanggakdo International Hotel, the largest hotel in North Korea. The 5th floor is a source of curiosity among many foreigners because it is off-limits to hotel guests. Around Winter 2012, as a way to organize the emerging ad hoc accidental travel blog turned community of fellow travelers, Sun turned his blog into a travel company so that participants can travel in spontaneously formed groups on budget-conscious loosely structured and last minute short trips while still being able to work full-time jobs and be in school full-time as Sun was still was at the time. ===Filmmaking=== In July 2007, Sun's short film, Asian American Beauty: A Discourse on Female Body Image, won the One to Watch Award at the 30th Asian American International Film Festival in New York City. ===Public speaker=== Sun has given keynote addresses and public speaking engagements at many institutions and organizations. ==Personal life== Sun lives and works in New York City.
