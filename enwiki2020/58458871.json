    "text": "Pudsey Park is a public park in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, England, approximately west of Leeds city centre. The park is the second most popular in Leeds after Roundhay Park. Facilities include a children's playground, a skate park, bowling green and a caf\u00e9. The park has a visitor centre, which hosts local wildlife displays, open from 10am to 3.30pm daily. A road roller vehicle was gifted to the park in 1959 after it was no longer required by the West Riding County Council. It was used by children to play on until it was removed in 1990 due to fears of asbestos flaking off the vehicle. A campaign is underway to restore the road roller to working condition. == References == ==External links== *Aerial imagery of the park from 1928 Category:Parks and commons in Leeds ",
