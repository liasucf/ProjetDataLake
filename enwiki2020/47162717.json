    "text": "The HTR-PM is a small modular nuclear reactor under development in China. It is a high-temperature gas-cooled (HTGR) pebble-bed generation IV reactor partly based on the earlier HTR-10 prototype reactor. The reactor unit has a thermal capacity of 250 MW, and two reactors are connected to a single steam turbine to generate 210 MW of electricity. Work on the first demonstration HTR-PM power plant, composed of two reactors driving a single steam turbine, began in December 2012 in Shidao Bay Nuclear Power Plant. The pressure vessels of the two reactors were installed in 2016. The steam generator shell, hot gas duct shell and reactor pressure vessel shell of the first reactor in the HTR- PM demonstration project were successfully paired on 28 April 2020, paving the way for the installation of the main helium fan and lays a solid foundation for cold performance tests, which are due to be completed in 2020. There is some scientific critics on HTR-PM with respect to safety and waste disposal.Rainer Moormann, R.
