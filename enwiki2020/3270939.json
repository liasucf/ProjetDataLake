The debut album by Moralny Kodex was called Sotryasenie Mozga (Russian for brain concussion), and was filled with strict big-beat drums in combination with INXS-like guitar riffs and lyrics by Pavel Zhagun. The song Do Svidanya, Mama (Russian for Goodbye mama) became a main single of this album. Several video clips were shot in 1990. In the early 1990s, Moralny Kodex was recognized as the most promising and popular rock band in Russia but their second album Gibkij Stan (here Slender Body) wasn't very successful. Some in-band disagreements appeared after this release, due to frontman Sergey Mazayev's problems with alcohol.\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f \u0438 \u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439 The band temporarily left the Russian mainstream scene.

In 2004 drummer Yuriy Kistenev left the band, and Mazaev invited new drummer Zack Sullivan from New York City. After a while the band made some new recordings for the next album at the Abbey Road Studios in London. Chris Kimsey, who worked with Rolling Stones and INXS, was the record producer for the album Slavianskie Tancy. The band played a popular set on the Moscow stage as part of the 2005 Live 8 concert.
