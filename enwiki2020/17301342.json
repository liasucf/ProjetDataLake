He was awarded posthumously the Argentine Nation to the Heroic Valour in Combat Cross and promoted to the rank of Captain. ===Burial place=== He was first buried at Puerto Belgrano, but owing to a letter from his 13-year-old daughter to President Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn in 1985, his remains were moved to Mar del Plata, the hometown of his family.\"La primera v\u00edctima fatal argentina\" El D\u00eda, 2 April 2007 The naval base of Mar del Plata was also the headquarters of the forces he led in combat at the time of his death.Capit\u00e1n de Fragata Pedro E. Giachino Armada Argentina website ==Alleged human rights violations during the 1976 dictatorship== A number of witnesses' statements surfaced in 2011, accusing Giachino of being the commander of the illegal repression of militants in the area of Z\u00e1rate-Campana, in northern Buenos Aires Province, between 1976 and 1977, during the dirty war. One of the main witnesses, former marine NCO Alfredo Molinari had several run ins with Giachino after being caught in possession of Karl Marx literature and later deserted his unit and took refuge in his parents house in Santiago del Estero. \u201cUn librito de Carlos Marx\u201d, By Gustavo Veiga, P\u00e1gina/12, 10 July 2011 Another of his accusers, Victor Basterra, a Montoneros guerrilla\"La historia del represor reciclado\", P\u00e1gina/12, by Susana Viau being held at the Navy Mechanics School in Buenos Aires, claimed in an interview that Giachino had been part of the security apparatus there. Circumstantial evidence also mentions him as being in charge of the external security of Mar del Plata's naval base, at a time when a part of the military facilities was used as a detention and interrogation center. His death prevents any further legal investigation, but the pressure of Human Rights groups compelled the City Council of Mar del Plata to remove his portrait from the chamber, where both the fallen soldiers from Mar del Plata and the local victims of the Argentine dictatorship are honoured.\"El h\u00e9roe que result\u00f3 represor\" Pagina 12, 10 July 2011 On 13 July 2011, retired commander Fernando Mar\u00eda Azcueta (former submarine ARA San Luis skipper that sortied against the Royal Navy in the Falklands War) announced that he would be returning the meritorious citizen diploma he received on the part of the Mar del Plata authorities, in protest at their decision to remove Giachino's portrait from the main hall.Los submarinistas del San Luis devuelven distinci\u00f3n al Concejo Deliberante de Mar del Plata Fellow veterans that served in the submarines San Luis and Santa Fe also returned their awards as news spread in social media groups of Azcueta's decision.Submarinistas de Malvinas devolver\u00e1n \u201cM\u00e9rito Ciudadano\u201d ==References== Category:People from Mendoza, Argentina Category:People from Mar del Plata Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:Argentine Navy personnel Category:Argentine military personnel killed in the Falklands War Category:Argentine military personnel of the Falklands War Category:1947 births Category:1982 deaths ",
