During the 2014 Geneve Motor Show an offroad version of Panda, named Cross, was launched: this contributed to keep the model as one of the Italian most sold cars. In 2015 the new Tipo, a compact car assembled at the Tofa\u015f plant in Bursa, Turkey, was launched. It won the Best Buy Car of Europe Award from Autobest, voted by a panel of 26 journalists from 26 European countries. Moreover, in 2016 the 124 spider made its first appearance: it was previously seen at 2015 LA Auto Show. The two passenger roadster recalls, for name and exterior styling, the Fiat 124 Sport Spider designed by Pininfarina and manufactured from 1966 to 1985. In 2019 the electric Fiat Concept Centoventi, translated as hundred and twenty in recognition of the company's 120th anniversary, was unveiled at the Geneve Motor Show. It \u201creimagines the Fiat Panda supermini as an electric car for the 21st century\u201d. The launch of the new Panda Trussardi in September 2019, has been accompanied by an innovative communication campaign that celebrates its unique style, changing the rules of automotive communications and positioning the new car as a fashion item. Panda Trussardi features in the video clip of Ava Max's new single \"Torn\", and the spot is \u201cjust\u201d a cut from the video clip. The new commercial was directed by Joseph Kahn who directed video clips for artists such as Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Sting and Shaggy. == Remarkable Commercials and Campaigns == === Super-Bowl Commercials === Fran\u00e7ois has often used the Super Bowl commercials renowned as one of the most expensive advertising slots in the world. In 2011 he conceived the Eminem- starring Chrysler Super Bowl commercial \"Imported from Detroit\", a 2 minutes homage to the rebirth of the automotive industry within Detroit. The ad won an Emmy\u00ae-Award as \u201cOutstanding Commercial\u201d. In 2012 he chose Clint Eastwood for a new Chrysler campaign named \u201cHalftime in America\u201d, which was described by the New York Post as \u201cone of the few touchdowns in last night\u2019s advertising Super Bowl\u201d and by CNN Money as \u201cking of the Super Bowl spots\u201d. For the 2014 Super Bowl, Fran\u00e7ois employed Bob Dylan as the testimonial for the launch of the new Chrysler 200. The campaign went further than promoting the car, the brand clearly tried to establish a broader message than the fact that it is associated with Detroit. For the 2015 Super Bowl, a new commercial for Fiat 500X was launched, named \u201cthe FIAT Blue Pill\u201d campaign. In the spot, a blue pill transforms a classic 500 into the 500X crossover. This commercial was described as \u201ca clever and humorous way to introduce the 500X\u201d. === Other Commercials === In 2008, Fran\u00e7ois dedicated a TV commercial for Lancia to Nobel Prize winners.

For the 2014 launch campaign of the Dodge Durango, he cooperated with Paramount Pictures and Will Ferrell (as the fictionary anchor Ron Burgundy). The commercial was used as marketing campaign for the release of the film \u201cAnchorman 2: The Legend Continues.\u201d In 2016 he worked again with Paramount Pictures, this time cooperating with the star of the film Zoolander 2, Derek Zoolander (played by Ben Stiller) to promote the Fiat 500X. The new spot entitled \"Selfie\u201d directed by Jeff Mann was screened for the first time at the Golden Globes ceremony. The campaign went on to receive a gold award for entertainment by the Clio Awards 2017 was 60th birthday of Fiat 500: to mark such a special occasion for the brand Fran\u00e7ois enrolled the Oscar winning American actor and producer, Adrien Brody. The film debuted the celebrative special series, the 500 Anniversario. In 2018, under Fran\u00e7ois supervision, Fiat choose Christopher Lloyd for the new 500X commercial.
