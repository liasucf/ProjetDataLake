It is one of many commercial buildings constructed in Fremantle during the gold boom period in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The two storey building was constructed in 1890 in the Inter-War Stripped Classical style. It is a combination of offices and warehouse space. The building was gutted by fire in 1922, causing between \u00a340,000 and \u00a350,000 worth of damage. The building was classified by the National Trust in 1974 and placed permanently on the Register of the National Estate in 1978. Changes were made to the facade in the 1990s. ==See also== * List of heritage places in Fremantle ==References== Category:Phillimore Street, Fremantle Category:Heritage places in Fremantle Category:1890 establishments in Australia Category:State Register of Heritage Places in the City of Fremantle ",
