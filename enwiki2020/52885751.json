She went on to study gender studies at Leeds University. While at Leeds, she took up fell-running, finding immediate success, winning the Blackshaw Head fell race in 2008. She later joined Todmorden Harriers athletics club, and went on to win the 2010 Three Shires Fell Race, the 2011 Liverpool Half Marathon, the 2010, 2011, and 2012 English, and 2012 British Fell Running Championships. After moving to Wales she joined Aberystwyth Athletics Club. ==Attempted murder== In June 2015, UK Athletics told Jeska that she would be required to provide blood tests to prove that her hormone levels were within normal female range, as there was no documentation for Jeska's 2000 castration. Jeska found this requirement distressing as she felt it would reveal her transgender status publicly. She failed to provide the samples required.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-39266777 In March 2016 she attacked Ralph Knibbs, a former professional rugby player and UK Athletics HR manager, with a knife because she feared UK Athletics would strip Jeska of her records and her eligibility to compete against female athletes. Jeska stabbed Knibbs in the head and neck, resulting in a 2cm hole with blood pumping out.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-39266777 Jeska also attacked Tim Begley and Kevan Taylor, employees of UKA who came to Knibbs' aid. In September 2016, she pleaded guilty to attempted murder, plus two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on Begley and Taylor, and weapons charges for knife possession. On 15 November 2016, she was scheduled to be detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983, but the hearing was adjourned for a month pending further psychiatric reports. Jeska was found during these investigations to have autism. In March 2017, Jeska was jailed for 18 years for the crimes, which severed nerves in Knibbs' body leaving him with restricted movement, difficulty eating, and limited vision in both eyes. It was revealed during sentencing that Jeska had twice asked for psychiatric help from the NHS prior to the attacks, but had not been referred for any treatment. Jeska is currently serving her sentence at HM Prison Foston Hall. Her racing results were declared null and void.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- england-birmingham-39266777 ==See also== *Transgender people in sports ==References== Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:English female long-distance runners Category:British fell runners Category:LGBT sportspeople from England Category:Transgender and transsexual sportspeople Category:Transgender and transsexual women Category:LGBT track and field athletes Category:21st-century English criminals Category:English people convicted of assault Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:People from Lancaster, Lancashire Category:People educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School Category:Alumni of the University of Leeds Category:British people convicted of attempted murder Category:Prisoners and detainees of England and Wales Category:People on the autism spectrum ",
