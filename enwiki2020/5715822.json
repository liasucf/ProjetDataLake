    "text": "The Voice of Vietnam (also Radio the Voice of Vietnam, Vietnamese: \u0110\u00e0i Ti\u1ebfng n\u00f3i Vi\u1ec7t Nam) is the Vietnamese national radio broadcaster. The first Vietnamese-language radio transmission was made on 2 September 1945, when the President Ho Chi Minh read out the Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. As of 2004, it was estimated that VOV programs reached more than 90% of all households in Vietnam. == History == Prior to 1945, the Vietnamese were banned from owning radio receivers, and broadcasting was under control of the French colonial government, which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s. Vietnam's national radio station, now called the Voice of Vietnam, started broadcasting from Hanoi just a week after the declaration of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with the declaration \"This is the Voice of Vietnam, broadcasting from Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\" During the Vietnam War, Radio Hanoi operated as a propaganda tool of North Vietnam. In August 1968, Voice of Vietnam commenced shortwave broadcasts for Vietnamese living abroad. South Vietnam set up its own network in Saigon in 1955. Following Reunification, all of the radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978. ==Station== Hanoi VOV1:675kHz/100.0MHz VOV2:549kHz/96.5MHz VOV3:102.7MHz VOV5:105.5MHz VOV Transportation:91.0MHz VOV English:104.0MHz Power:500kW (1)/200kW (2) VOVTV: Television channel of VOV Dong Hoi VOV1:630kHz VOV2:729kHz Power:200kW Danang VOV1:594kHz VOV2:702kHz Power:10kW (Day)/50kW (Night) Qui nhon VOV1:648kHz VOV2:740kHz (June:738kHz) Power:50kW (January)/100kW (June) Nha Trang VOV1:666kHz VOV2:576kHz Power:50kW (January)/100kW (June) Dak Lak VOV1:675kHz VOV2:819kHz Power:10kW (January)/100kW (June) Ho Chi Minh City VOV1:657kHz/94.0MHz VOV2:558kHz/96.5MHz VOV3:102.7MHz VOV Transportation:91.0MHz Power:100kW (January)/200kW (June) Can Tho VOV1:711kHz VOV2:783kHz Power:500kW (1)/200kW (2) Other VOV4:747kHz/873kHz VOV FS:1242kHz Power:200kW (TPHCM)/500kW (Can Tho) Location:TPHCM (747)/Can Tho (873/1242) ==See also== * Media of Vietnam ==References== ==External links== * Voice of Vietnam (in Vietnamese) * Voice of Vietnam (in English) * Vietnam Radio Stations Online; Full List Updated 2013 Category:1945 establishments in Vietnam Category:International broadcasters Category:Government of Vietnam Category:Radio stations established in 1945 Category:Radio stations in Vietnam ",
