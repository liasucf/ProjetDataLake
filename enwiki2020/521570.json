(listed as \"Aldwinckle David Christopher\") On becoming Japanese, he changed his name to , taking his wife's surname. They divorced in 2006. ==Activism== ===Arudou v. Earth Cure=== The \"Japanese only\" sign at the Yunohana Onsen, as it appeared in 1999 Arudou objected to the policies of three bathhouses in Hokkaido, Japan, in the late 1990s that had posted \"No Foreigners\" or \"Japanese Only\" signs on their doors. Arudou led a multinational group of 17 people of various nationalities (United States, Chinese, German, and Japanese) to enter the Yunohana bathhouse in Otaru and test the firmness of the \"No Foreigners\" policy posted on its door. The group attempted the walk-ins twice. Arudou returned to Yunohana in October 2000 for a third time as a naturalized Japanese citizen, but again was refused entry. The manager accepted that Arudou was a Japanese national, but refused him entry on the grounds that his foreign appearance could drive Japanese customers to take their business elsewhere. Arudou and two co-plaintiffs, Kenneth Lee Sutherland and Olaf Karthaus, in February 2001 sued Earth Cure in district court pleading racial discrimination, and the City of Otaru for violation of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, a treaty which Japan ratified in 1996. On November 11, 2002, the Sapporo District Court ordered Earth Cure to pay the plaintiffs \u00a51 million each in damages.\"THE WORLD; Japanese Court Ruling Favors Foreigners; Bathhouse must pay three men who were denied entry\". Los Angeles Times. November 12, 2002. The court stated that \"categorically refusing all foreigners constitutes irrational discrimination, exceeds social norms, and amounts to an illegal act\". The Sapporo District and High Courts both dismissed Arudou's claim against the city of Otaru for not creating an anti- discrimination ordinance. According to the Sapporo High Court ruling, \"The convention has only general, abstract provisions recommending appropriate measures to eliminate racial discrimination, and the Otaru government does not have any obligation to institute ordinances to ban such discrimination.\" It stated that \"issues such as which measures to take, and how to implement them, are properly left to the discretion of Otaru\". The Sapporo High Court upheld these rulings on September 16, 2004, and the Supreme Court of Japan denied review on April 7, 2005. ===Other protests=== In 2003, Arudou and several other long-term foreign residents dressed up as seals to protest the granting of an honorary j\u016bminhy\u014d (residency registration) to Tama-chan, a male bearded seal, in Nishi Ward, Yokohama. The protesters asserted that if the government could grant j\u016bminhy\u014d to animals and animation characters, as was the case in Niiza and Kasukabe Cities, Saitama Prefecture, then there was no need to deny foreign residents the same. At the time, non-Japanese residents were registered in a separate alien registration system.Asahi Shinbun, 22 February 2003 In February 2007, Arudou participated in a protest against an over-the- counter Japanese-language publication titled Ky\u014dgaku no Gaijin Hanzai Ura File \u2013 Gaijin Hanzai Hakusho 2007 (Secret Files of Foreigners' Crimes). The magazine highlighted alleged crimes committed by foreigners. Arudou, calling the magazine \"ignorant propaganda\" that \"focuses exclusively on the bad things that some foreigners do, but has absolutely nothing about crimes committed by Japanese\". Arudou posted a bilingual letter for readers to take to FamilyMart stores protesting discrimination against non-Japanese residents of Japan. In June 2008, Arudou lodged a complaint with the Hokkaido Prefectural Police that its officers were targeting foreigners as part of a security sweep prior to the 34th G8 summit in T\u014dyako, Hokkaido. This followed an incident where Arudou asserted his right under the Police Execution of Duties Law to not need to show identification when requested by a police officer at New Chitose Airport. After meeting with police representatives at their headquarters, Arudou held a press conference covered by a local television station.STV News. June 25, 2008. In August 2009, Arudou\u2014acting as the chair of FRANCA (the Foreign Residents and Naturalized Citizens Association)\u2014began a letter-writing campaign to protest an advertisement by McDonald\u2019s Japan featuring a bespectacled, mildly geeky, 43-year-old American Japanophile known as Mr. James\u2014a burger mascot who proclaims his love for the fast-food outlet in broken katakana Japanese. Writing in The Japan Times, Arudou argued that the \"Mr. James\" campaign perpetuates negative stereotypes about non-Japanese Caucasian minorities living in Japan, and demanded that McDonald\u2019s Japan withdraw the advertisement: \"Imagine McDonald's, a multinational that has long promoted cultural diversity, launching a McAsia Menu in America featuring a deep-bowing, grimacing Asian in a bathrobe and platform sandals saying 'Me likee McFlied Lice!' or 'So solly, prease skosh honorable teriyaki sandrich? Time magazine's Coco Masters concluded: \"To protest Mr. James as a stereotype of a minority population in Japan because the Ohio native fails to speak or write Japanese fluently, dresses like a nerd and blogs about burgers only ends up underscoring the fact that there really aren't a lot of foreigners who fit the bill running around Japan.\" Japanologist Alex Kerr has criticized Arudou for his \"openly combative attitude\", an approach that Kerr thinks usually \"fails\" in Japan and may reinforce the conservative belief \"that gaijin are difficult to deal with\". Eric Weiner described Arudou as an \"outspoken man that rejects the notion that there's one Japanese way of doing anything\"; and himself as a \"loudmouth with an Internet connection\". Doug Struck described Arudou as emerging \"as the Outraged Man, tilting at uncomfortable truths about Japanese racial discrimination\". Paul Murphy described Arudou as \"the quintessential indefatigable civil rights campaigner\". ==Publications== Arudou had a book published about the 1999 Otaru hot springs incident, originally in Japanese, and then in 2004 in an expanded English version, .
