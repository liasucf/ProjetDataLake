He received his doctorate under the supervision of Giovanni Jona-Lasinio. From 1976 to 2011 Doplicher was professor ordinarius of quantum mechanics in the mathematics department of the Sapienza University of Rome, retiring there in 2011 as professor emeritus. He is known for his research based on the Haag\u2013Kastler axioms and collaborated with Rudolf Haag. Doplicher also coauthored a number of papers with John Elias Roberts (1939\u20132015), who worked for a long time in Rome. With Roberts and Haag he examined superselection rules in the algebraic quantum field theory. Doplicher and Roberts proved a reconstruction theorem for the quantum fields and gauge groups from the algebra of the observables.Halvorson, M\u00fcger, Algebraic Quantum Field Theory, 2006 DHR Superselection theory, nLab Later in his career, Doplicher dealt with mathematical fundamentals of quantum gravity (non-commutativity of space-time coordinates).

In 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.
