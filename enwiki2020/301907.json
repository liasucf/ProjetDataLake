The remaining two languages form a subgrouping known as Northern Tiwa. Northern Tiwa consists of Taos spoken by 800 people in Taos Pueblo and Picuris spoken by around 220 people in Picuris Pueblo. The extinct language of Piro Pueblo may also have been a Tiwan language, but this is uncertain (see Piro Pueblo language). ==History== After the Pueblo Revolt against the Spanish conquistadors in 1680, some of the Tigua and Piro peoples fled south with the Spanish to El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico). There they founded Ysleta del Sur, Texas; Socorro, Texas; and Senec\u00fa del Sur, Mexico.Marshall, Michael P. and Walt, Henry J., (1984) \"Chapter 11: Pre-Revolt Place Names: Senec\u00fa,\" in Rio Abajo: Prehistory and History of a Rio Grande Province, New Mexico Historic Preservation Division, Santa Fe, p. 252, Their descendants live in these communities to this day.Eickhoff, Randy Lee (1996) Exiled: The Tigua Indians of Ysleta del Sur, Republic of Texas Press, Plano, Texas, ==See also== * Jornada del Muerto ==Notes== Category:Tanoan languages Category:Languages of the United States Category:Indigenous languages of the Southwestern United States Category:Indigenous languages of the North American Southwest Category:Tiwa Category:Pueblo culture ",
