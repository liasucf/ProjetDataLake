By 1960 WKW had 45 stores in Austria. In 1961 the chain was renamed Billa, a portmanteau of \"billiger Laden\", German for 'cheap shop', started selling food and went over to self-service. In 1965 the company had grown to 109 stores. REWE Group acquired Billa in 1996. ==Present locations== Billa operates stores in six European countries: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Country !
