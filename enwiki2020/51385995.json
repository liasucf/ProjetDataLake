Only individual championships were officially contested during the first thirteen- NCAA sponsored swimming and diving championships. Unofficial team standings were kept but a team title was not officially awarded until 1937. Michigan is acknowledged as the unofficial team champion, the Wolverines' third such title. ==See also== *List of college swimming and diving teams ==References== Category:NCAA Division I Men's Swimming and Diving Championships NCAA Swimming And Diving Championships NCAA Swimming And Diving Championships ",
