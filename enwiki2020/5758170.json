He was a member of the French Communist Party (PCF) and worked with Louis Aragon in the evening daily '. == Early life == Bloch was born into a Jewish family. His father was an engineer with the SNCF. ==Literary career== He became a professional writer in 1909, after having worked for two years in a high school as an aggregated teacher. By this time, he was already known as a left-leaning intellectual. In 1910 he launched L\u2019Effort libre, a \"review of revolutionary civilization\". He joined the French Army in World War One and was injured three times on the battlefields of the Marne and in Verdun. After the war, he felt remorse for having joined the army. He also suffered from neurosis caused by the horrors of war and by the premature death of his youngest daughter, Solange. It was during this time that Bloch traveled to Africa on the advice of a friend. His logbook made during this maritime voyage was published in newspapers and magazines of the period and was later serialized into a three volume book set. In 1937, he was responsible for organising Naissance d'une cit\u00e9, a \"popular spectacle\" performed on 19 October as part of the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. ==Family life== Andr\u00e9 Maurois was his brother in law. == Literary works == * A Publisher of \"L'Effort Libre\", 1910\u20131914 (left-wing literary magazine) * L\u00e9vy, 1912 * ... et Compagnie, 1918 (novel) * La nuit Kurde (novel) * Sybilla, 1932 (novel) * Carnaval est mort, 1920 (critic) * A leader of \"Europe\" (with Jean Gu\u00e9henno) * Offrande \u00e0 la musique, 1930 (ballet) * Destin du si\u00e8cle, 1931 * Naissance d'une culture, 1936 * Toulon (a play) * De la France trahie \u00e0 la France en armes, 1949 ==References== ==External links== Category:20th-century French novelists Category:20th-century French male writers Category:Jewish novelists Category:French Jews Category:French literary critics Category:20th-century French dramatists and playwrights Category:French Communist Party members Category:1884 births Category:1947 deaths Category:French male novelists Category:French male dramatists and playwrights Category:French senators elected by the National Assembly ",
