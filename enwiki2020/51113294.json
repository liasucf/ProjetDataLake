This forum is associated with numerous controversial topics and people regarding terrorism and terror financing. ==Description== Its objective, as stated by the general coordinator of the conference, Fahd Albmal, was to create a union to mirror that of the GCC, aimed at discussing broad political reforms and social and political development throughout the gulf. He also indicated that it required four months of planning through the formation of a number of committees and Gulf leaders to complement the GCC. Adel Ali Abdullah, the spokesperson for the conference, stated that these countries, including UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman, were looking to ensure the stability of these countries and hopefully have Yemen join the league. Additionally, he indicated that they hoped to combat the dangers facing the region that threaten their Islamic identity and foreign security risks. Throughout its promotion, the forum indicated that it gathered political and intellectual elites ranging from academic thinkers, writers, politicians, and journalists from all of the Gulf States in the pretext of a forum or conference, representing all spectrums of society and doctrines of thought. ==Conference== The conference was attended by 400 individuals from the 6 GCC countries, and hoped to publicize further this union.https://www.facebook.com/Ugforumgulf/info?tab=page_info It featured a series of seminars by 6 speakers over two days.
