    "text": "{| |} Na\u00efade was a 20-gun Coquette-class corvette. She took part in the Indian theatre of the Anglo-French War with the squadron under Suffren. The British Royal Navy captured her in 1783 but never commissioned her; it sold her in 1784. ==French service== On 11 February 1782, Na\u00efade departed Brest. She called Isle de France (Mauritius) and arrived at Cuddalore on 10 March 1782 to support the squadron under Suffren. In November 1782, she was at Ceylon under Costebelle. On 11 April, Captaine de Br\u00fblot Villaret de Joyeuse was given command of Na\u00efade. Suffren sent her to Madras to warn the French blockading squadron, composed of the 74-gun Fendant, the 64-gun Saint-Michel and the frigates Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre and Coventry, of the imminent arrival of a superior British force. Three days after her departure, on 11 April 1783, Na\u00efade spotted the 64-gun HMS Sceptre, under Captain Graves; after trying without success to elude his much stronger opponent, Villaret was forced into battle, and struck his colours after a five-hour fight. When Villaret surrendered his sword, Graves allegedly told him \"Sir, you have given us a fairly beautiful frigate, but you made us pay dearly for her!\"; some authors add that Graves returned Villaret his sword. ==British service== The British armed Na\u00efade with twenty- two 12-pounder guns, and two 18-pounder and six 12-pounder carronade, but never commissioned her. From 26 April 1783, she was under Lieutenant Richard Strachan. == Fate == Na\u00efade was sold on 17 August 1784. ==Notes, citations, and references == Notes Citations Bibliography * * * * * * Category:1780 ships Category:Corvettes of the French Navy Category:Captured ships Category:Sloops of the Royal Navy ",
