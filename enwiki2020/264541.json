    "text": "Joseph Boniface de La M\u00f4le (c. 1526 \u2013 30 April 1574) was a French nobleman. He was the son of Jacques Boniface, seigneur de la M\u00f4le et de Colobri\u00e8res, of Marseille. ==Life== La M\u00f4le was the Proven\u00e7al lover of Marguerite de Valois, among others, during the early part of her marriage to Henry of Navarre, the future king of France. He served Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Anjou and Alen\u00e7on, Marguerite's brother and youngest son of King Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici. He represented the Duc d\u2019Alen\u00e7on during marriage negotiations with Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1572. In 1574 he was implicated in a Malcontent conspiracy against the reigning king, Charles IX, who was gravely ill, supported by the duke of Alen\u00e7on. He was accused of making an attempt on the king's life when a wax figurine pricked with needles, which he had obtained from the astrologer Cosimo Ruggeri, was found in his possession. After being subjected to questioning and torture, he was condemned to death. He was quartered and beheaded at the Place de Gr\u00e8ve in Paris with his co- conspirator, . It has been rumoured that Marguerite embalmed la M\u00f4le's head and kept it in a jewelled casket.See E.R. Chamberlin, Margaret of Valois (NY: 1974) and Charlotte Haldane, Queen of Hearts (London, 1968). ==In popular culture== William Shakespeare seems to have heard of the incident. In Act IV, scene I of 2 Henry VI, the character William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk and lover of Queen Margaret, is beheaded. In scene iv, Margaret brings his head to a conference at the palace, where she weeps over and embraces it. A major character of Alexandre Dumas's novel La Reine Margot, la M\u00f4le is transformed into Joseph-Hyacinthe Boniface de Lerac de la Mole, a Protestant nobleman saved by Queen Marguerite during the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. The figure who was saved after stumbling into the Queen's bed chamber was not, in fact, la M\u00f4le, who took part in the Massacre, but rather was a gentleman named M. de Teian. Fictional descendants of La M\u00f4le also feature prominently in Stendhal's novel The Red and the Black. He is portrayed by Swiss actor Vincent P\u00e9rez in the film La Reine Margot and Dmitry Kharatyan in the Russian miniseries \"La Reine Margot\" (\"\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0433\u043e\" (1996)). ==References== Category:1520s births Category:1574 deaths Category:Huguenots Category:French torture victims Category:Executed French people Category:16th-century executions by France ",
