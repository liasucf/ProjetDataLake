Wright scored his first senior goal in a 3\u20131 defeat to Wrexham on 18 August 2015, it was his only goal in 12 league appearances for Kidderminster. The loan spell at Kidderminster was cut short in November 2015 to allow Wright to join fellow National League relegation contenders Torquay United on loan, initially until 2 January 2016. The loan deal was extended until the end of the 2015\u201316 season, with Wright going on to score three goals in 22 league appearances to help Torquay survive relegation from the National League, at the expense of former club Kidderminster Harriers. After featuring for West Brom's Under-23 side against Millwall in the EFL Trophy in August 2016, Wright was loaned out to Coventry City until 9 January 2017. Wright scored his first league goal for Coventry City in a 2\u20132 draw with AFC Wimbledon at the Ricoh Arena, in what would prove to be Tony Mowbray's final game as Coventry City manager. On 17 January 2017, Wright agreed to join League Two side Yeovil Town on loan until the end of the season, but the deal collapsed on 18 January 2017, due to rules governing the number of clubs a player can represent in one season. On 1 September 2017, after numerous trials with Football League sides, Wright opted to return to Kidderminster Harriers on a one-year deal. In July 2019 it was announced that Andre had signed for League of Ireland Premier Division side Bohemians until the end of the 2019 season. Wright scored 4 goals in a single game for Bohs as they defeated fellow Dublin club UCD in August 2019. ==Career statistics== https://int.soccerway.com/players/andre-wright/413068/ {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |West Bromwich Albion |2015\u201316https://ie.soccerway.com/players/andre- wright/413068/ |Premier League |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- |Kidderminster Harriers (loan) |2015\u201316 |rowspan=\"2\"|National League |12||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||12||1 |- |Torquay United (loan) |2015\u201316 |22||3||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||2||28||5 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|West Bromwich Albion |2016\u201317 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|West Bromwich Albion Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0 |- |Coventry City (loan) |2016\u201317 |EFL League One |11||2||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||12||2 |- |Brighton & Hove Albion |2016\u201317 |EFL Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Kidderminster Harriers |2017\u201318 |National League North |8||0||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||12||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Kidderminster Harriers Total !20!!1!!3!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!1!!0!!24!!2 |- |Nuneaton Town |2017\u201318 |National League North |2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Torquay United |2018\u201319 |National League South |6||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||6||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Torquay United Total !28!!3!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!6!!2!!34!!5 |- |Gloucester City |2018\u201319 |National League South |13||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||13||0 |- |rowspan=3|Bohemians |2019 |rowspan=2|League of Ireland Premier Division |10||5||4||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||16||7 |- |2020 |15||7||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||7 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Bohemians Total !25!!12!!4!!2!!1!!0!!1!!0!!1!!0!!32!!14 |- !colspan=3|Career total !99||22||8||3||3||1||1||0||14||4||117||19 |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:West Bromwich Albion F.C. players Category:Kidderminster Harriers F.C. players Category:Torquay United F.C. players Category:Coventry City F.C. players Category:National League (English football) players Category:English Football League players Category:Nuneaton Borough F.C. players Category:Gloucester City A.F.C. players Category:Bohemian F.C. players Category:League of Ireland players Category:Expatriate association footballers in the Republic of Ireland ",
