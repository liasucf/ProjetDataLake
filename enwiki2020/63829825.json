    "text": "Jordan McCabe (born September 3, 1998) is an American college basketball player for the West Virginia Mountaineers of the Big 12 Conference. ==Early life== In second grade, McCabe began training with Jason Otter. At age 12, while attending Beaver Lake Middle School in Sammamish, Washington, he drew national attention for his dribbling ability. In December 2010, he featured in a KOMO-TV segment. In the following months, McCabe appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to put on a dribbling exhibition and was showcased in an ABC News segment. He performed at halftime in collegiate and professional basketball games and at the NBA All-Star Game. In June 2011, McCabe was drafted by the Harlem Globetrotters, who intended to sign him after his graduation from college. He was held back in seventh grade as a \"family decision.\" ==High school career== McCabe was a four-year varsity basketball player for Kaukauna High School in Kaukauna, Wisconsin under head coach Michael Schalow. As a sophomore, he was named Fox Valley Association (FVA) Player of the Year and led his team to the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association (WIAA) Division 2 state championship, scoring 24 points in the title game. Before his junior year, McCabe committed to play college basketball for West Virginia over offers from DePaul, Minnesota and Missouri, among others. In his junior season, he averaged 25.1 points per game. As a senior, McCabe averaged 26.7 points and 7.8 assists per game, sharing FVA co- Player of the Year honors with Tyrese Haliburton while being named Wisconsin Mr. Basketball. He led Kaukauna to another WIAA Division 2 state championship. In the title game, McCabe led all scorers with 32 points, recorded his team's final eight points, and made the game-winning shot with 3.5 seconds left. ==College career== McCabe made his debut for West Virginia in a November 9, 2018 loss to Buffalo. On February 26, 2019, he recorded 25 points, 11 assists and six steals, all of which were freshman season-highs, in 50 minutes during a 104\u201396 triple overtime win over TCU. McCabe became the first college player to record at least those numbers in one game since Ohio's D. J. Cooper in 2010. On March 4, he was named Big 12 Conference Newcomer of the Week. As a freshman, McCabe averaged 5.8 points and 2.5 assists per game, shooting 32.2 percent from the field, and led his team with 88 total assists. He earned Big 12 Academic All-Rookie Team honors. McCabe continued to struggle shooting the ball in his sophomore season. He scored a season-high 10 points on two occasions and averaged 3.1 points in 13.5 minutes per game, despite starting in 29 of his 31 appearances as a sophomore. ==Career statistics== ===College=== |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2018\u201319 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| West Virginia | 35 || 15 || 18.5 || .322 || .338 || .743 || 1.6 || 2.5 || .9 || .0 || 5.8 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"| 2019\u201320 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| West Virginia | 31 || 29 || 13.5 || .311 || .209 || .760 || 1.0 || 1.6 || .5 || .0 || 3.1 |- class=\"sortbottom\" | style=\"text- align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career || 66 || 44 || 16.2 || .318 || .294 || .750 || 1.3 || 2.1 || .7 || .0 || 4.5 ==References== ==External links== *West Virginia Mountaineers bio Category:Living people Category:1998 births Category:American men's basketball players Category:Point guards Category:West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball players Category:People from Kaukauna, Wisconsin Category:Basketball players from Wisconsin ",
