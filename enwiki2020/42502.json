Bacon also completes Opus Minus, a summary of Opus Majus, later in the same year. The only source for his date of birth is his statement in the Opus Tertium, written in 1267, that \"forty years have passed since I first learned the alphabet\". The 1214 birth date assumes he was not being literal, and meant 40 years had passed since he matriculated at Oxford at the age of 13. If he had been literal, his birth date was more likely to have been around 1220. * The leadership of Vienna forces Jews to wear Pileum cornutum, a cone-shaped head dress, in addition to the yellow badges Jews are already forced to wear. * In England, the Statute of Marlborough is passed, the oldest English law still (partially) in force. === By place === ==== Asia and Africa ==== * The \"Grand Capital\" is constructed in Khanbaliq (present-day Beijing) by Kublai Khan, having moved the capital of the Mongol Empire there three years prior. * Malik ul Salih establishes Samudra Pasai, the first Muslim state in Indonesia. * Spain attempts an invasion of Morocco, but the Marinids successfully defend against the invasion, and drive out Spanish forces. == Births == * February 3 (or February 3 1266) - Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel (d. 1302) * August 10 - King James II of Aragon (d. 1327) * Giotto di Bondone, Italian artist who marked the shift from medieval art to Proto- Renaissance art.
