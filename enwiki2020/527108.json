    "text": "Landvarnarflokkurinn was an Icelandic political movement which operated from 1902 to 1912, founded because of discontentedness with a clause in the Icelandic constitution that stated that the Icelandic minister should bring up cases in the Danish Council of State. The clause was in the constitution from 1903 to 1915, at which point the Danish king ordered that it should be removed. The founders of Landvarnarflokkurinn, who included Einar Benediktsson, Bjarni J\u00f3nsson and J\u00f3n Jensson, were the most radical fighters for Iceland's independence of that time. ==References== * \u00cdslenska Alfr\u00e6\u00f0ior\u00f0ab\u00f3kin H-O. 1990.
