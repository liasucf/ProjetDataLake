Later on, Trang improved due to Quang & Huong's concerns. As they arrived in Phan Thiet City sand dunes together with Samuel, Hang followed by taking an ATV ride. There can be not just one, but two challenges that they need to test themselves. First challenge would be walking on the sand dunes by carrying the libra scale balance without the support. The starting point would be the blue flag while the red flag would be its terminal point. Phong & Phuong got a just right comment, Quang, Duong & Lan got a minimal concern from Hang while Thanh, Chau, Tram, Nha & Huong stood positive and eager to face new challenges as Hang is speechless for a great impression and Trang struggles the most because she didn't carry the libra scale correctly due to heavy weights and poor catwalks. As altogether went to red flag, they are surprised that there would be another challenge for them, is to pose at the back side of a driver when the ATV is kept on moving at the sand dunes as Samuel takes pictures to them. Lan rides first to exhibit her variety of poses, followed by Chau, Phong, Huong, Trang (who raised her both arms to fly the sleeved tassels on it as she flies like an eagle), Tram (who struggled first but later on, improved), Phuong (who raised her scarf for her exceptional aura), Thanh (despite for her short height), Quang (who is ever since adventurous and has an exciting behavior), Duong & Nha (who struggles the most). As Samuel expressed his thanks to the guest photographer for the benefit of the contestants, there can be no winners of the challenge announced since the second challenge is the combination/crossover between the second challenge and a pre-photo shoot as all of them made their way to the next photo shoot. At the photo shoot, they were surprised that there would be a terrarium (with the hole at the bottom for them to insert his/her head as a sign of surprise) that is filled with sands, plants & some creepy animals like iguana, snake, baby crocodiles, frog and even large spiders that will be given to them. Nha was the first one to encounter with an iguana and a large spider for her beauty shots. Phong followed next with a baby crocodile, Tram with a snake (but she was frightened at first) and a spider (for her courageous dare), Quang with a baby crocodile and a spider, Trang with a spider (but she was terrified and then, struggled), Lan with a toad & a fast-running spider (also frightened and struggled like Trang), Thanh with a snake (because she loves it) and an iguana (that made her way to success by being courageous), Duong with a baby crocodile and a spider, Chau with an iguana and a spider, Phuong with an iguana & a snake (that made her shocked and struggled like Lan & Trang) & lastly, Huong with a crawling snake (that made her struggled at first, but later on, she ended up with a courage).

As they celebrate the Mooncake Festival, all 8 finalists went to Water Puppet Theatre to know the stories first that portrayed in a theatrical play before they used these props and effects for their poses in coincidence with the said festival. As a result, after she suffered in the bottom group in episodes 6 & 9, Trang made a mark in this episode due to her large improvement in portraying a good variety of poses. Subsequently, Phuong, Quang, Chau & Thanh delivered their good performance as well that brought Huong, Tram & Lan in a bottom three for their oversimplified expression which don't gave life to their photos.
