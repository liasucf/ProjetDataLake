He was co- founder and chairman of Lanz Incorporated, a designer and manufacturer of dresses and nightgowns. The Lanz flannel granny nightgown became a staple of women's nightware in the late 1950s. As a large landowner, Scharff has been called a pioneer of Venice Beach in Los Angeles for contributing to the development and expansion of the city. His investments include the Cadillac Hotel, Beach House on Ocean Front Walk, L.A. Louver, and James Beach Cafe. == Early life == Scharff was born in Landau, Germany the youngest of three brothers. His father, a grocer, died when he Scharff was 10, forcing him to leave school and join the family's grocery business. By age 20, Scharff, with the family business failing, used his savings to move in 1937 with his brother Kurt to start a new business in New York, arriving as political refugees. == Career == Once in New York, Scharff and his brother partnered with Austrian retailer Sepp Lanz, an \u00e9migr\u00e9, in his Austrian-style clothes and sleepwear retail store. Scharff soon discovered there was a demand for the clothing line in the California region. In 1938, the Scharffs and Lanz relocated to Los Angeles to open a store location on Wilshire Boulevard, specializing in Austrian-inspired ski clothing and sleepwear. When American film actress Hedy Lamarr wore their clothes in the film Ziegfeld Girl, the company received film credits, which gave the Lanz line national attention. In 1946, the Scharff brothers bought the business from Lanz and focused on manufacturing. The same year, Scharff encouraged nearby clothing retailers to sell their line in their stores. At the same time, the company established a wholesale business with department stores worldwide. === Lanz flannel granny nightgown === In 1953, Scharff designed and unveiled a nightgown line, \"the granny gown,\" which was made of inexpensive cotton flannel and became Lanz Inc.\u2019s signature product. It was based on a dress that Scharff's landlady had worn. By the late 1950s, the gown became a popular cover-up for women. As a result, the company expanded to 30 retail stores and establish a manufacturing division. Playwright Wendy Wasserstein was known to have worn a Lanz nightgown while writing. === Venice Beach === In the 1950s, Scharff began buying property in the Venice Beach area of southern California and rehabilitating them. During a lengthy downturn with businesses on the oceanfront, he helped design a master plan for the community that included storefronts. He became one of the largest property owners in Venice. Scharff also commissioned artwork, including building murals that include a Van Gogh tribute \"Starry Night\" at Wave Crest and Ocean Front Walk and a portrait of Venice founder Abbot Kinney that highlights a five-story brick apartment building Scharff once owned on Venice Boulevard. == Personal life == Scharff was married three times and was divorced twice. Also, the children whom Scharff had with his first wife, Eleanor Mace, were Peter Scharff and Alexis Scharff. The child whom Scharff had with his second wife, Alexandra Scharff is Christopher Scharff. He then married his third wife Simone Hormel Scharff, who had children from her previous marriage to Thomas Hormel, including Smokey (Gregory) Hormel, an extremely accomplished and renowned guitarist, Michele Hormel, Angela Hormel and Christopher Hormel. == Death == In the early 2000s, Scharff was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease.
