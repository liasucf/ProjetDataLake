    "text": "The Oregon Museum Tavern shooting occurred on May 7, 1981, at Oregon Museum Tavern in Salem, Oregon. == Incident == Lawrence William Moore, 25, of Scio, Oregon, an unemployed mill worker walked into the crowded Oregon Museum Tavern on Front Street NE which was hosting a Ladies' night and without saying a word started to fire his 9mm Browning handgun. Moore first fired at the bar, before turning the weapon at patrons who began to flee. Once the magazine had run out he reloaded and continued firing. One of the times he was reloading several patrons at the tavern overpowered him, wrestled him to the ground and held him, waiting for the police to arrive. The killing spree ended with the killing 3 people at the scene and injuring 20 others; one of these died in hospital later that night, and Dennis Scharf died nearly 32 years later from injuries sustained. == Fatalities == *Lori J. Cunningham, 22 \u2013 died at the scene *John W. Cooper, 27 \u2013 died at the scene *Robert E. Hamblin, 24 \u2013 died at the scene *Allen L. Wilcox, 24 \u2013 died at hospital *Dennis Scharf, 56 \u2013 died January 19, 2013, due to complications from injuries sustained == Legal and aftermath == At trial, beginning on October 6, 1981, he pleaded innocent to the murder charges, citing mental disease or defect as a defense; however, he admitted to being the gunman. Moore stated the reason for the shooting that he was trying to get members of a 'syndicate' of millionaires, Jews and criminals who had been trying to poison him. Moore was subsequently found guilty of four counts of aggravated murder and sentenced to four life terms in prison. === Memorial === The names of the deceased victims are included in a joint memorial wall at Oregon City's Mountain View Cemetery that memorializes some 390 people that were murdered. The memorial was dedicated by The Greater Portland Area chapter of Parents of Murdered Children. == See also == *List of massacres in the United States *List of rampage killers in the United States == References == Category:1981 in Oregon Category:1981 mass shootings in the United States Category:1981 murders in the United States Category:Attacks in the United States in 1981 Category:Deaths by firearm in Oregon Category:History of Salem, Oregon Category:Mass murder in 1981 Category:Mass shootings in Oregon Category:May 1981 events in the United States Category:Murder in Oregon Category:Workplace violence in the United States Category:Mass shootings in the United States ",
