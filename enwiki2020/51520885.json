    "text": "A Damn the Weather (or Damn-the-Weather) is a Prohibition Era cocktail made with Gin, sweet vermouth, orange juice, and a sweetener (either Triple Sec or Cura\u00e7ao). It is served shaken and chilled, often with a slice of orange or other citrus fruit. ==History== Like many prohibition-era cocktails, the Damn the Weather was conceived as a way to hide the scent and flavor of poor quality homemade spirits, in this case bathtub gin. The original recipe was included in Harry Craddock's 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book. A bar/restaurant in Seattle takes its name from the drink. ==Variations== * The Despite the Weather cocktail is made with shochu, pisco, orange juice, lemon, passion fruit, and ginger syrup. * The drink may be served over ice in a short glass. * Grand Marnier or Cointreau may be substituted for the sweetener. ==References== Category:Cocktails with gin ",
