Retrieved on 2015-08-08. == History == Serpentine Running Club was established after an appeal in the \u2018Fun Runner\u2019 column of Running magazine (now Runner\u2019s World) following the inaugural London Marathon in 1981, calling for volunteers to form a team to run the second London Marathon. About 50 runners responded and arranged to meet by the bridge over the Serpentine on May 30, 1981 at 9.45am. From the original group of 50 runners, 42, including Geoffrey Cannon, went on to complete the 1982 marathon and decided to carry on running afterwards. There was also a clear majority wanting to form their own club, with the Serpentine name emerging after some discussion. By the early Nineties the club was competing in cross-country, track and field and road running, but it almost folded in the late Nineties. However, aided by an increasing interest in running, combined with the launching of the club\u2019s extensive website, the club enjoyed a revival early in the 21st century. Serpentine organise the New Year\u2019s Day 10km \u2013 attracting more than 600 entries each year \u2013 the Jekyll and Hyde Park Duathlon in October, and the Last Friday of the Month 5km in Hyde Park\u2013 run continuously since 1992, inheriting the London Road Runners\u2019 original 5km handicap format, and converted into the popular open race it is today.Jones, Ruth (2016-06-01). .
