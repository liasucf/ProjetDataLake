    "text": "\"Borderline\" is a song by Australian psychedelic music project Tame Impala. It is the third track on the 2020 studio album The Slow Rush, and was released as a single on 12 April 2019 through Modular Recordings. The song was written by Kevin Parker, who performed all instruments and vocals. It was debuted during the band's performance on Saturday Night Live on 30 March. The single release of \"Borderline\" in 2019 predated any details about The Slow Rush, which was delayed until 2020. Parker reworked the song for its inclusion on the album, making musical and lyrical changes. After releasing of the album, the single version was removed from all streaming devices. When Triple J asked about the change, Parker explained \u201cThe way I describe it is the way it sounds now is the way I was hearing it when I released it the first time. So for me, the drums sounded just heaps more hard-hitting. And it was just things that I could hear in the song that I didn\u2019t realise no one else could, for example, the bassline, which was just kind of an example of lack of perspective when you\u2019re working on a song, or anything that anyone\u2019s working on ever. You lose perspective when you\u2019re working on it, which is good, too, it\u2019s kind of beautiful that you have no idea what you\u2019re doing.\u201d ==Critical reception== In a mention of the band's Saturday Night Live performance, Music Feeds called the song a \"groovy, toe-tapping lounge chiller\". ==Promotion== Tame Impala announced the release of the song through Instagram, posting the cover art with the caption \"Friday\". ==Personnel== * Kevin Parker \u2013 vocals, instrumentation, production, mixing, engineering * Dave Cooley \u2013 mastering ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019\u20132020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 58 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) | 17 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 63 |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 1204 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Rock Songs (Billboard) | 57 |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Tame Impala songs Category:Songs written by Kevin Parker (musician) ",
