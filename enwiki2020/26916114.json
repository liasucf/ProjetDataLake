    "text": "Adam James Barton (born 7 January 1991) is a professional footballer who is a central midfielder and is currently a free agent. Born in England, he has played internationally for both Northern Ireland, in a senior friendly, and Republic of Ireland at under-21 level. ==Club career== ===Preston North End=== Born in Clitheroe, Barton started in the youth ranks at Blackburn Rovers before being released at the age of sixteen due to a serious back injury. Although originally seen as a gamble due to his injury, Preston North End gave Barton a youth scholarship and his performances at youth and reserve team level earned him a two-and-a-half-year contract in December 2008. In the 2009\u201310 season, Barton moved to Conference National side Crawley Town on a one-month loan. After making two appearances for the club he returned to Preston, where he made an appearance in the club's reserve side. Due to manager Darren Ferguson starting to use youngsters in the first team, Barton made his full debut in a home 3\u20132 win over Scunthorpe United on 10 April 2010, being replaced at half-time due to a head injury. At the start of the 2010\u201311 season, Barton signed a two-year contract to keep him at Preston until 2013. He scored his first goal in the 4\u20133 defeat to Burnley in September 2010. After scoring his first goal, Barton established himself in the first team, where he made thirty-five appearances in all competitions, scoring once. However, Barton was unable to help the club avoid relegation to League One. Ahead of the 2011\u201312 season, Barton was linked with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers. Despite this, newly appointed manager Phil Brown said he believed Barton could be a key figure to the club this season, quoting: \"That is the position for him, sitting in front of the back four and making us play, like an orchestra leader. He has got that ability but he has to demand the ball and get on it more times.\" However, Barton's season didn't go as planned, as he mostly spent time on the bench at the start of the season. He scored his first goal of the season, in the League Cup Third Round, in a 2\u20131 loss against Southampton. On 25 February 2012, Barton suffered a suspected triple leg break and a dislocated ankle in a 0\u20130 draw against Walsall after making a challenge with Walsall's Richard Taundry. As a result of his injury, new Preston manager Graham Westley said he believed Barton would come back stronger once he had recovered, while Taundry said he believed the tackle was innocuous, though he wished Barton a speedy recovery. Following surgery Barton was ruled out for the remainder of the season. ===Coventry City=== On 6 August 2012, Barton signed a three-year contract with Coventry City. He made his league debut for the club, in the opening game of the season as Coventry drew 1\u20131 with Yeovil Town. Three weeks after signing for the club, he scored his first goal, in a 2\u20132 draw against Bury. He finished the season with 3 goals in 22 League games. On 27 March 2014, Barton joined League Two side Fleetwood Town on loan for the remainder of the 2013\u201314 season. After making 27 League appearances for Coventry in the 2014\u201315 season, he was released by the club at the end of the season. ===Portsmouth=== On 24 June 2015 Barton signed a two-year deal with Portsmouth. ===Partick Thistle=== Barton signed for Scottish Premiership club Partick Thistle on 31 August 2016, moving for an undisclosed transfer fee. He scored his first Partick Thistle goal in a 2\u20131 home defeat to Aberdeen, scoring a header from a corner into the top left corner of the goal. He was also awarded Man of the Match for his performance. On 9 November 2016, Barton was named as Premiership Player of the Month for October 2016. In the same month Barton also won Partick Thistle's McCrea Financial Services Player of the Month award as voted for by the Partick Thistle supporters. Barton scored his second Thistle goal in a 1\u20130 away win over St Johnstone in the Scottish Cup.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38865417 In May 2017 Barton was named the club's player of the Year in his first season with Thistle. ===Dundee United=== Following Partick Thistle's relegation from the Premiership, Barton signed a two-year contract with Scottish Championship club Dundee United in July 2018. ===Connah's Quay Nomads (loan)=== In January 2019 he switched to the Welsh Premier League signing on loan for Connah's Quay Nomads.https://www.wpl.cymru/news/January-2019-Transfer-Deadline-Day-Round- Up/116450/ ===Wrexham=== On 4 July 2019, Barton signed for Wrexham on a two- year deal. Barton left Wrexham in February 2020 having made 10 appearances in all competitions.https://www.wrexhamafc.co.uk/news/news-adam-barton-departs- wrexham-afc ==International career== Barton was named in a Northern Ireland squad in September 2010, having previously been named in an under-21 squad, qualifying for the country through his parents. He withdrew from the squad the day after its announcement, in order to remain eligible for the England team, which would have no longer been the case had he represented Northern Ireland in a competitive fixture. On 12 November 2010 Barton was called up for Northern Ireland's friendly against Morocco after a number of withdrawals, playing the full 90 minutes in the 1\u20131 draw on 17 November. On 15 March 2011, more question marks over Barton's international status were raised when he was called up to Noel King's Republic of Ireland under-21 squad for a friendly match against Portugal, making his debut appearance and playing the full 90 minutes for them in that game on 26 March 2011. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Preston North End |2008\u201309 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2009\u201310 |Championship |1||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- |2010\u201311 |Championship |33||1||0||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||35||1 |- |2011\u201312 |League One |16||0||1||0||3||1||2Appearances in the Football League Trophy||1||22||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !50!!1!!1!!0!!5!!1!!2!!1!!58!!3 |- |Crawley Town (loan) |2009\u201310 |Conference Premier |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||2||0 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Coventry City |2012\u201313 |League One |22||3||2||0||2||0||0||0||26||3 |- |2013\u201314 |League One |14||0||2||0||0||0||1||0||17||0 |- |2014\u201315 |League One |27||0||1||0||0||0||2||0||30||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !63!!3!!5!!0!!2!!0!!3!!0!!73!!3 |- |Fleetwood Town (loan) |2013\u201314 |League Two |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Portsmouth |2015\u201316 |League Two |16||0||2||0||0||0||3One appearance in the Football League Trophy and two in the League Two play-offs||0||21||0 |- |2016\u201317 |League Two |3||0||0||0||1||0||1Appearance in the EFL Trophy||0||5||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !19!!0!!2!!0!!1!!0!!4!!0!!26!!0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Partick Thistle |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"2\"|Scottish Premiership |31||1||3||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||34||2 |- |2017\u201318 |33||0||2||0||6||0||2Two appearances in the Scottish Premiership play-offs||0||43||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !64!!1!!3!!1!!6!!0!!0!!0!!53!!2 |- |Dundee United |2018\u201319 |Scottish Championship |7||0||0||0||3||1||0||0||10||1 |- |Connah's Quay (loan) |2018\u201319 |Welsh Premier League |8||2||3||0||0||0||2Two appearances in the Scottish Challenge Cup||0||13||2 |- |Wrexham |2019\u201320 |National League |7||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||2||0||11||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career totals !220!!7!!18!!1!!17!!2!!15!!1!!270!!11 |} ==Honours== ===Individual=== * Scottish Premiership Player of the Month (1): October 2016 ==References== ==External links== * * * *Republic of Ireland profile at Soccer Scene Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:People from Clitheroe Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Republic of Ireland under-21 international footballers Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Northern Ireland international footballers Category:English footballers Category:English people of Irish descent Category:English people of Northern Ireland descent Category:Association football midfielders Category:Preston North End F.C. players Category:Crawley Town F.C. players Category:Coventry City F.C. players Category:Fleetwood Town F.C. players Category:Portsmouth F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Partick Thistle F.C. players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:Dundee United F.C. players Category:Connah's Quay Nomads F.C. players Category:Wrexham A.F.C. players ",
