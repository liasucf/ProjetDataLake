    "text": "Cointreau (, ,\"Cointreau\" (US) and ) is an orange-flavoured triple sec liqueur produced in Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy-d'Anjou, France. It is consumed as an ap\u00e9ritif and digestif, and is a component of several well-known cocktails. It was originally called Cura\u00e7ao Blanco Triple Sec. Despite the orange bottle, Cointreau is colourless. == Production == Cointreau Distillery was set up in 1849 by Adolphe Cointreau, a confectioner, and his brother Edouard-Jean Cointreau. Their first success was with the cherry liqueur guignolet, but they also found success when they blended sweet and bitter orange peels and pure alcohol from sugar beets. The first bottles of Cointreau were sold in 1875. An estimated 13 million bottles are sold each year, in more than 150 countries. Ninety percent of production is exported. Cointreau & Cie SA was family-owned until 1990, when it merged with R\u00e9my Martin to form R\u00e9my Cointreau, now a publicly traded company. The production methods and recipe are a family secret, but tours of the facility are open to the public. Photography is restricted in many areas to protect the production process from being copied. == Cocktails == In addition to being consumed neat (or often on ice), Cointreau is used in many popular cocktails. The official IBA recipes for both the margarita and the cosmopolitan include Cointreau. When mixed with water, Cointreau exhibits the Ouzo effect. == Publicity == In the 1980s, Avirex, now Cockpit USA, issued an A-2 limited-edition leather flight jacket featuring Cointreau Original Margarita nose art on the back of the jacket. In early 2008, burlesque entertainer Dita Von Teese became the new face of Cointreau's \"Be Cointreauversial\" advertising and marketing campaign,Cointreau, Dita Von Teese Unite, 17 January 2008. a campaign created in 2003Re/Max Wants More Personality, 17 March 2003. by the New York advertising agency KraftWorks.Kraftworks NYC == References == == External links == * * R\u00e9my Cointreau Category:Products introduced in 1875 Category:French liqueurs Category:Orange liqueurs ",
