This opening sought to boost bilateral relations between the two countries, focusing such cooperation on certain aspects:Ficha de Yemen Office of Diplomatic Information. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Bilateral Relations. * Development Cooperation: Yemen is not included in the Master Plan for Spanish Cooperation for the period 2012\u201314. It is important that Spain becomes a bilateral donor to help promote the political, social and economic stability of this country. * Commerce: Yemen is a country with possibilities for Spain, the sectors that most interest are: fishing, infrastructure and natural resources. In this regard, a series of bilateral Memoranda and Agreements for bilateral collaboration in the different sectors have been signed. * Consular: After the transfer to Spain in July 2010 of the Spanish citizen sentenced to death in Yemen Nabil Manakli, consular affairs have normalized and focus today on the protection of the Spanish colony in the current context of crisis. In this regard, the Embassy evacuated the bulk of the colony in March 2011, except for those of its members who voluntarily decided to remain in Yemen. == Economic relations == There are no Spanish companies established in Yemen, although some multinationals are present in the market through distribution contracts. The most promising sectors for Spanish companies are, without a doubt, infrastructure, fishing derivatives and the development and rehabilitation of tourist areas. To this it is possible that the desalination of seawater is added in the coming years. A sector that is not at all exploited and perhaps interesting for Spanish companies is that of renewable energy. Solar energy is not just exploited in Yemen and would be an important business niche at this time of drastic fall in oil production.Ficha de Yemen Office of Diplomatic Information.

In 2011, the company, \"The Valencian Machinist\" signed a contract for the installation of five lighthouses on the Red Sea islands.
