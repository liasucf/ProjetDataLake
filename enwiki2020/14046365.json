    "text": "CJWW is a Canadian radio station, airing a country music format at 600 AM in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The station is owned by Elmer Hildebrand via licensee 629112 Saskatchewan Ltd., trading as Saskatoon Media Group. It shares studios with sister stations CKBL-FM and CJMK-FM at 366 3rd Avenue South. Originally launching at 1370 AM on January 12, 1976, it moved to 750 in 1985,Decision CRTC 85-159 and finally to 600 (the former AM location of sister station CFQC radio) in 1995. CJWW's country music format has been in place since its launch in 1976; most of its contemporaries from that era have since changed broadcast format (some several times), leaving CJWW one of the only longstanding Saskatoon radio stations still following its original mandate. ==References== ==External links== * CJWW * * JWW JWW Category:Radio stations established in 1976 Category:1976 establishments in Saskatchewan ",
