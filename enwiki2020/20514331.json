    "text": "Defension Secunda was a 1654 political tract by John Milton, a sequel to his Defensio pro Populo Anglicano. It is a defence of the Parliamentary regime, by then controlled by Oliver Cromwell; and also defense of his own reputation against a royalist tract published under the name Salmasius in 1652, and others criticism lodged against him. ==Background== Only a few months after Cromwell was made Lord Protector over England, Milton published a tract titled Pro Populo Anglicano Defensio Secunda. The work was one of the last times that Milton discussed Cromwell's character.Keeble 2003 p. 134 It is a defence of the Parliamentary regime, controlled by Cromwell, and sought the support of a European audience.Wootton 1994 p. 75 In addition to this purpose, the work serves a reply to the attacks on his Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce by Herbert PalmerWheeler 2003 p. 134 and attacks on his Defensio pro Populo Anglicano by Salmasius. A further anonymous pamphlet attack from the royalist side, Regii sanguinis clamor ad coelum, he rebutted with an ad hominem attack on Alexander Morus, whom Milton wrongly took to be the actual author (who was in fact Pierre Du Moulin). Milton used scurrilous gossip against Morus; scholars have decided that his sources of scandal were at least reasonably accurate.Christopher Hill, Milton and the English Revolution (1977), p. 183. However, the act of writing further strained his failing eyes, to the extent that he could no longer rely on his sight.Rumrich 2003 p. 154 ==Tract== Milton begins his work by addressing claiming to fight for truth and freedom who will help reform Europe: :\"I have in the First Defence spoken out and shall in the Second speak again to the entire assembly and council of all the most influential men, cities, and nations everywhere\".Milton 1966 p. 554 He continues by discussing parts of his life, and explains why he writes instead of fighting as a soldier:Lares 2001 p. 36 :\"I did not avoid the toils and dangers of military service without rendering to my fellow citizens another kind of service that was much more useful and no less perilous\". After defending why he writes, Milton explains his purpose in writing: > It is the renewed cultivation of freedom and civic life that I disseminate > throughout cities, kingdoms, and nations. But not entirely unknown, nor > perhaps unwelcome, shall I return if I am he who disposed of the contentious > satellite of tyrants, hitherto deemed unconquerable, both in the view of > most men and in his own opinion. When he with insults was attacking us and > our battle array, and our leaders looked first of all to me, I met him in > single combat and plunged into his reviling throat this pen, the weapon of > his choice.Milton 1966 p. 556 After Milton was accused of being a worse person than Cromwell, he wrote in the work that it was \"the highest praise you could bestow on me\".Milton 1966 p. 662 Later in the tract, Milton discusses his Areopagitica and argues that in the work, he warns against the idea of truth being determined by a limited few. Milton also discusses his early divorce tracts, claiming that they were a discussion of religious freedom, domestic freedom, and civil freedom,Patterson 2003 p. 279 the \"three varieties of liberty without which civilized life is scarcely possible\".Milton 1966 p. 624 ==Themes== Milton, through the work, becomes a defender of the individual against the control of a government or religious authority. He also attacks the concept of titles and other forms of pomp, a theme that reoccurs later in the figure of Satan from his Paradise Lost.Loewenstein 2003 p. 354 Besides discussing his views on politics, Milton dwells on parts of his biography, including a description of his early years with education and literature.Lares 2001 p. 23 ==Notes== ==References== * Keeble, N.
