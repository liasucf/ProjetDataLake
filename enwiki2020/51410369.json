    "text": "Angola competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 September to 18 September 2016. == Disability classifications == Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. == Delegation == The country sent a team of 4 athletes, 2 men and 2 women, along with 4 officials to the 2016 Summer Paralympics. ==Athletics== ;Men's Track {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Events !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |- !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left rowspan=3|Jose Chamoleia (Guide \u2013 Nicolau Palanca) |align=left|100 m T11 |colspan=2|Disqualified |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|200 m T11 |23.33 |3 Q |23.46 |7 |colspan=2|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|400 m T11 |53.00 |5 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left rowspan=3|Octavio Santos (Guide \u2013 Luis Manuel) |align=left|100 m T11 |11.68 |2 Q |11.71 |4 |colspan=2|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|200 m T11 |24.13 |3 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|400 m T11 |53.14 |6 |colspan=4|Did not advance |} ;Women's Track {|class=wikitable style=\"font- size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Events !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |- !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left rowspan=3|Esperanca Gicasso (Guide \u2013 Alaine Baptista) |align=left|100 m T11 |12.61 |9 |colspan=4|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|200 m T11 |26.67 |11 Q |26.92 |12 |colspan=2|Did not advance |-align=center |align=left|400 m T11 |1:04.17 |9 |colspan=4| Did not qualify |-align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Befilia Buya (Guide \u2013 Eduardo Chimboto) |align=left|400 m T11 |colspan=6 | Did not start |-align=center |align=left|1500 m T11 |5:24.01 |8 |colspan=4 | Did not qualify |} == See also == *Angola at the 2016 Summer Olympics == References == Category:Nations at the 2016 Summer Paralympics 2016 Category:2016 in Angolan sport ",
