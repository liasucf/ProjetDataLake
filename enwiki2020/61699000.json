From 1987 to 1991, \u010caslav Brukner has studied physics at the University of Belgrade, and subsequently completed a degree in physics at the University of Vienna in 1995. He then worked as a research assistant at the Institute for Experimental Physics at the University of Innsbruck. In 1999 he received his doctorate in quantum physics at the Vienna University of Technology. In 2003, he completed his habilitation in the field of quantum physics at the University of Vienna, where he was an associate professor until 2014. He has had several research experiences abroad: in 2004 at Imperial College in London, and from 2005 to 2008 as professor at the Tsinghua University in Beijing.
