The club was founded in 1945 and was named after Jovan Miki\u0107 Spartak, the leader of the Partisans in Subotica, who was a national hero and was killed in 1944. The club was named Spartak Subotica until the end of the 2007\u201308 Serbian League Vojvodina season when it was merged with Zlatibor Voda who won promotion to the Serbian First League thus gaining the name Spartak Zlatibor Voda. In 2013, the board decided to return the original name of the club: \"FK Spartak Subotica.\" However, the practice of adopting a sponsorship name returned in 2018 with the club accepting sponsorship from a vinary and renaming itself Spartak \u017ddrep\u010deva krv after the name of the popular wine brand produced in Serbia.

They participated in the first after-war club championship, in the 1946\u201347 Yugoslav First League and from then on, they played always in between the first and second national leagues. The biggest success of the club was achieved when the club played in the 1993\u201394 FR Yugoslavia Cup final against Partizan (1\u20136 loss). After the dissolution of \u017dAK Subotica, club that played in the pre-war period until 1945, the players who did not want to belong to any of the two newly formed clubs, Radni\u010dki or Gra\u0111anski, decided to form the FK Spartak. The new club was named after the nickname of a legendary Subotica athlete and World War II commander Jovan Miki\u0107 \u2013 Spartak. The club was very active in its early years, continuing the tradition of Subotica football. Many club players later played for the biggest clubs in the country or internationally, having some played for the national team, as well. Beside the players, the stadium, the colors and the fans, Spartak also inherited from \u017dAK the tradition of being backed by the Yugoslav Railways.gradsubotica.co.rs Spartak\u2019s biggest success since Serbia became an independent country came in the 2018\u201319 UEFA Europa League qualifying rounds.
