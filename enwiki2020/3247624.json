    "text": "Republic Day (Maltese: Jum ir-Repubblika') is a public holiday celebrated in Malta celebrated on 13 December. It celebrates the anniversary of the creation of the Republic of Malta. On 13 December 1974, the constitution of Malta revised, which resulted in the transforming the State of Malta into a republic, effectively abolishing the role of Re\u0121ina ta' Malta (Queen of Malta) in the country. That same year, Sir Anthony Mamo was named as the first president of the country. British troops did not leave the country until 31 March 1979. ==Events on 13 December== The main state sponsored celebrations take place in the center of the country's capital, Valletta. The National Festivities Committee is responsible for organizing Republic Day events annually.https://www.officeholidays.com/countries/malta/republic_day.phphttps://www.visitmalta.com/en/event- details/2018-12/republic-day-11113https://www.wincalendar.com/Republic-Day- Maltahttps://publicholidays.com.mt/republic-day/ ===Awards ceremony=== The President of Malta usually presents awards to those who have served Malta in the military/political sphere and public figures who are considered to be effective representatives of the country. ===Fireworks=== A fireworks display is annually held over the Grand Harbour. ===Monument=== A wreath laying ceremony is held at the Republic Day Monument in Marsa.
