    "text": "Scott McNeil is an Australian-born Canadian actor and voice actor. He currently resides in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. One of the most well-known Canadian voice actors of all time, McNeil has provided voices to many characters in animated shows, most notably The Wacky World of Tex Avery, ReBoot, Beast Wars: Transformers, Storm Hawks, Dragon Ball Z, Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, InuYasha, Ranma \u00bd, Fullmetal Alchemist, X-Men: Evolution, League of Super Evil and Mega Man. He has done live action work as well. ==Early life== McNeil was born in Brisbane, Australia, but moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada when he was 4 years old in 1966. He first appeared on stage at the age of three. He first learned that people were paid to do different voices after a trip to Disneyland at the age of 12. That was when he learned that Paul Frees, the person who provided the voice that greeted visitors entering the Haunted Mansion, was the same person who provided the voice of the Pillsbury Doughboy. Even though he knew about voice acting, McNeil pursued the theater. He studied at Studio 58. After leaving, he tried to find acting jobs and worked as an Elvis impersonator for a short time. It was in the late eighties when he found himself on his way into the world of voice acting. A casting director at the time told McNeil that he had wished that he'd met him a week before; he was casting for the G.I. Joe cartoon. ==Professional career== McNeil states his first role was providing voices on The New Adventures of He-Man. His first anime role was for Project A-ko, where he provided the voices for three women. After appearing in a few films and two episodes of Highlander: The Series, he provided voices for Beast Wars, as Waspinator, Dinobot, Rattrap, and Silverbolt. He has described this as the work he is most proud of. On another fan favorite show, Dragon Ball Z, he was cast as the original voice of Piccolo and various other characters. He then provided the voice of Duo Maxwell on Mobile Suit Gundam Wing and Principal Kuno on Ranma \u00bd. He eventually got the call stating he was cast as Wolverine on X-Men: Evolution. He continued to play the role of Logan/Wolverine for a total of four seasons from 2000-2003. McNeil was then cast in another fan favorite anime, InuYasha as Koga. He provided the voice of the Fullmetal Alchemist character Hohenheim of Light, Foghorn Leghorn on Baby Looney Tunes, Grumpy Bear on Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-Lot, Amergan, Gregor and the lab director on Highlander: The Search for Vengeance, and Stork on Storm Hawks. He still appears in live action shows occasionally and was in Scooby- Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed and The Green Chain. As of October 2007, he estimates that he has provided voices to 8,500 characters. McNeil is appreciative of fans because he knows what it is like to see your favorite voice actor talk as the character they provide the voice for. He says that he is inspired by Paul Frees, Maurice LaMarche, and Mel Blanc. If he had a chance to meet the late Mel Blanc, McNeil has said that he would \"fan boy all over him.\" ==Filmography== ===Japanese animation dubbing=== * Adieu Galaxy Express 999 - Captain Harlock * Beyblade Burst Evolution - Raul Comas (ep. 1-20) * Black Lagoon - Verrocchio and Chinese Man * Black Lagoon: The Second Barrage - Verrocchio * A Chinese Ghost Story: The Tsui Hark Animation \u2014 Demon King and Solid Gold * Dragon Ball Z \u2014 Piccolo, Majin Buu, Old Supreme Kai, Android 16, Dr. Brief, Jeice, Turtle, South Kai, Dabura, Killa, Mercenary Tao, Farmer, King Piccolo and Mez (FUNimation-Saban dub and Westwood Media dub) * Dr. Slump \u2014 Mr. Skop, Race Car Driver, Syoppaman, Mr. Salad, Akira Toriyama's Dad, Suppaman, Ultraman, Alien Kid, Alligator, Charmy Yamada, Jubei Norimaki. * Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone \u2014 Piccolo (FUNimation-Pioneer dub) * Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might \u2014 Piccolo and Daiz (1997 FUNimation-Saban dub) * Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might \u2014 Piccolo, Daiz, Rasin and Oolong (1998 FUNimation- Pioneer dub) * Dragon Ball Z: The World's Strongest \u2014 Piccolo and Turtle (FUNimation-Pioneer dub) * Dragon Drive \u2014 Saizou Toki and Magna * Dragon Warrior - General Rudolph * Elemental Gelade \u2014 Beazon * Fullmetal Alchemist \u2014 Hohenheim of Light * Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa \u2014 Hohenheim of Light * Galaxy Express 999 \u2014 Captain Harlock * Hakkenden: Legend of the Dog Warriors \u2014 Hachiro T.
