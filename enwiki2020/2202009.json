    "text": "Still, Alive... and Well? is a Megadeth compilation album released on September 10, 2002 and is the last Megadeth release with bassist and co- founder David Ellefson until his reunion with the band eight years later. The album was released to fulfil Megadeth's record contract with Sanctuary Records after Dave Mustaine dissolved the band seemingly indefinitely when he sustained a serious nerve injury in 2002. The album's name is a quote from Dave Mustaine's answer to an interviewer's question: \"What do you want written on your tombstone?\" The first six tracks (except track 1 & 2 though recorded on the same date as the others) are taken from the live album Rude Awakening and the remaining tracks are selections from The World Needs a Hero. ==Track listing== ==Credits== *Dave Mustaine \u2013 vocals, guitars *David Ellefson \u2013 bass guitar *Al Pitrelli \u2013 guitars, backing vocals *Jimmy DeGrasso \u2013 drums ==References== Category:Megadeth compilation albums Category:2002 greatest hits albums Category:Heavy metal compilation albums Category:Megadeth live albums ",
