After holding the Yankees hitless through his first seven innings, the no-hitter was broken up in the eighth stanza on a sharp single off the bat of New York Yankees outfielder Johnny Callison. He pitched 8 innings, allowed four hits, struck out five, and gave up two earned runs.

The lyrics to the song included these lines: \"Move over, Babe. Here comes Henry and he's swinging mean. Move over, Babe. Hank's hit another; he'll break that 714.\" The song was covered that same year, by Richard \"Popcorn\" Wylie. Released in the United States and Japan, the song got airplay on radio and the NBC Game of the Week. The song is included on Rhino Records' CD \"Baseball's Greatest Hits.\" One biographer of Aaron had this to say about Slayback: \"Slayback, who provided the music, was something of a Renaissance man. He sang, played numerous instruments, painted, sketched, and made furniture.\" Tom Stanton, Hank Aaron and the Home Run that Changed America (Harper Collins 2005), p. 116\\. In 2006, Slayback issued a new CD titled \"Lady Dancing on Fire.\" Tigers manager Jim Leyland gave it a positive review: \"I have something that I want the Tigers to play at Comerica Park, 'Lady Dancing on Fire' by Billy Slayback. It's outstanding; it has all the stuff; it's tremendous. He did all the music, all the instruments, he played them all.\" ==Personal life== Slayback died on March 25, 2015, aged 67. ==See also== * 1972 Detroit Tigers season ==References== ==External links== *Bill Slayback's Web Site Category:1948 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Baseball players from California Category:Batavia Trojans players Category:Cal State Northridge Matadors baseball players Category:Glendale Vaqueros baseball players Category:Evansville Triplets players Category:Gulf Coast Tigers players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Lakeland Tigers players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Montgomery Rebels players Category:People from Hollywood, Los Angeles Category:Rocky Mount Leafs players Category:Toledo Mud Hens players ",
