    "text": "Reroute to Remain (subtitled: Fourteen Songs of Conscious Insanity, and on reissue: Fourteen Songs of Conscious Madness) is the sixth studio album by Swedish metal band In Flames, released in September 2002. The album saw a major change in musical style and was met with rejection among many of the band's fanbase. The album's more accessible sound attracted many new fans and popularized In Flames' name within the American heavy metal scene, helping to secure a top spot at Ozzfest. It was the band's first album to present singles, which were \"Trigger\" and \"Cloud Connected\". ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== Despite initially receiving a mixed response from fans, the album received mostly favorable reviews.
