    "text": "St Mary's Church, Barnes is the parish church of Barnes, formerly in Surrey and now in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It is a Grade II* listed building. St Mary's Barnes is a thriving Christian community with an electoral roll of 350 and strong links across the local community. Along with the parishes of St Michael and All Angels, Barnes and Holy Trinity Barnes it forms the Barnes Team Ministry; the current Team Rector is Rev'd James Hutchings. ==History== The church was built of coursed flint some time between 1100 and 1150. It was enlarged and re-consecrated in 1215, after the signing of Magna Carta, by Cardinal Stephen Langton (c. 1150\u20131228), who was Archbishop of Canterbury from 1207 to 1228. It was extended to the west in the 13th century, and later to the east, creating a chancel. A west tower was added in the late 15th century. The north wall was demolished in the late 18th century to create a north aisle. The full set of eight bells in the tower was completed in 1897 to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. A major fire on 8 June 1978 destroyed parts of the church, but left the tower and Norman chapel almost intact. The church was restored by Edward Cullinan with the inclusion of elements of its former structure. The north wall contains a Gothic Revival east window. The church was re-dedicated in February 1984, with the original building now named as the Langton Chapel, commemorating Archbishop Stephen Langton. ==Notable burials== * Major General Roger Elliott (c. 1665\u20131714), who lived at Byfeld House in Church Road, Barnes, was buried in the churchyard in May 1714. *John Moody (c. 1727\u20131812), actor, who lived at 11 The Terrace, Barnes, c.1780 until his death, is buried in the churchyard with his two wives. ==References== ==Further reading== *Official Guidebook to The Parish Church of St. Mary, Barnes ==Gallery== File:St Mary's Church, Barnes 02.JPG|Exterior view File:Entrance to St Mary's Church, Barnes.jpg|Church entrance File:St Mary's Church, Barnes 14.JPG|Clock File:20th Century Extension to the Church of Saint Mary, Barnes.jpg|20th- century extension File:Barnes, St Mary's Church, interior.jpg|Interior view File:Barnes, St Mary's Church, Langton Chapel.jpg|Langton Chapel File:Barnes, St Mary's Church, monumental brass to Edith and Elizabeth Wylde, 1508.jpg|1508 brass monument to Edith and Elizabeth Wylde in Langton Chapel ==External links== * Category:1100s establishments in England Barnes Barnes Category:Churches in Barnes, London Category:Flint buildings Category:Grade II* listed churches in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Category:History of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Category:Rebuilt churches in the United Kingdom ",
