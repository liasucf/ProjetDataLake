    "text": "Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics is a peer-reviewed journal that publishes theoretical and experimental research into nuclear physics, particle physics and particle astrophysics, including all interface areas between these fields. The editor-in-chief is Jacek Dobaczewski, University of York, UK. ==Scope== The journal publishes research articles on: * theoretical and experimental topics in the physics of elementary particles and fields; * intermediate-energy physics and nuclear physics; * experimental and theoretical research in particle, neutrino, and nuclear astrophysics; * research arising from all interface areas among these fields. Research is published in the following formats: * Research Papers: Reports of original and high-quality research work; * Research Notes: Contributions from individuals (or small groups) within large collaborations, containing early results of analyses, detector development, simulations, etc. which might not otherwise be published in the wider literature; * Topical Reviews: Specially commissioned review articles on areas of current interest; * LabTalk: Article summaries written by the researchers themselves which introduce the findings, techniques, and possible applications of their research.Journals Catalogue 2013. iop.orgJournal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics.
