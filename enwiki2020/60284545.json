The station bears its name after the Niciarniana street, which runs closely to the station. The station was opened during inter-war period of the 1920s and 1930s as a station for local thread factory workers, it also served a branch line leading to the factory. The current name of the station was given in 1951. From 1951 to 2011 the station was used mainly for regional and commuter services, as well as special trains with football fans arriving for games played on the stadium of Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a football club. In 16 October 2011, the station was closed, and demolished one year later. During the major reconstruction of the railway line between Fabryczna and Widzew stations, the station was rebuilt from scratch, this time in the form of a single island platform located on top of the railway viaduct. The street, which ran next to the station and had a secured crossing before the reconstruction, was routed under the new viaduct. The new station was opened on 11 December 2016. == Gallery == File:PKP Lodz-Niciarniana.jpg|Station in 2007 File:Lodz Niciarniana 1.jpg|Old platform of the station File:Lodz Niciarniana 2.jpg|Old building of the station File:Lodz Niciarniana 3.jpg|A defunct branch line between station and thread factory File:1.
