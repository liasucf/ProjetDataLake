He held the seat until 1768, when he was elected MP for New Shoreham. He represented New Shoreham until 1774, when he stood for Ilchester. Though he was declared to have been returned, a subsequent petition uncovered evidence of bribery and the election was declared void. Cust did not stand in the resulting re-election, but instead stood for Grantham in 1776, to which seat he was elected. He represented Grantham until 1780, when he again stood for Ilchester, and this time was declared duly elected. He was re-elected to the seat in 1784, and died the following year on 2 January 1785. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1723 births Category:1785 deaths Category:People educated at The King's School, Grantham Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1761\u20131768 Category:British MPs 1768\u20131774 Category:British MPs 1774\u20131780 Category:British MPs 1780\u20131784 Category:Directors of the British East India Company Peregrine 1723 ",
