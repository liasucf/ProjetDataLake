    "text": "The Northern Michigan Football League is an interscholastic athletic conference affiliated with the Michigan High School Athletic Association. It is located in Northern Michigan and contains nineteen teams that encompasses twelve counties: Antrim, Benzie, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Crawford, Emmet, Grand Traverse, Kalkaska, Leelanau, Luce, Mackinac, and Otsego. ==History== The League formed from the merger of the Lake Michigan Conference and the Northwest Conference, for football only. The schools were then split up based on enrollment and competitiveness, with the larger schools forming the Legends Division, and the smaller ones forming the Legacy Division. Mesick, who was a member of the Northwest Conference, declined to join the league, leaving the Legacy Division with one school less than the Legend Division. Before the 2015 season, it was announced that the six members of the Ski Valley Conference not dropping to Eight-man Football as well as Cheboygan, Onekema and Traverse City Christian High Schools would join the league during the 2016 season, causing the league to expand to three divisions; the Leaders, Legends, and Legacy divisions.http://www.record-eagle.com/sports/local_sports/onekama-cheboygan- join-nmfl-more-on-the- way/article_2d333bde-3e18-5d63-a86d-cc2cbc8a4bb4.htmlhttp://www.record- eagle.com/sports/local_sports/conference-up-to-teams- divisions/article_3e22c4c3-1125-5aa2-8b7e-d9be547a8dc8.html The league is also considering the applications of several other schools, and the possibility of further divisions to help with travel costs. On October 6, 2015, Traverse City Christian announced that it would not be joining the NMFL and that Mesick would be replacing them in the conference on a two-year trial basis. For the 2017 season, more changes will be happening, as four schools will be making the move to eight-man football.

However, for the 2018 season, Newberry, from the former Mid Eastern Football Conference, was brought into the league.http://www.miningjournal.net/sports/prep-sports/2017/06/west-pac-to- add-three-football-teams-in-2018-newberry-to-join-nmfl/ This did not last long, however, as for the 2019 season, Newberry, along with Gaylord St. Mary announced their own move to the 8 man game as well. Starting in 2020, the league will welcome Sault Ste. Marie and West Branch-Ogemaw Heights, who both previously were independent. In corresponding moved Kalkaska and Boyne city will move from the Legends Division to the Leaders Division, and Frankfort will move from the Leaders Division to the Legacy Division. This aligns the league, with the exception of Traverse City St. Francis, to divisions based on enrollment sizes, with the Legends being the largest, Leaders being the middle, and Legacy being the smallest schools.https://www.petoskeynews.com/sports/northern-michigan-football-league- changes-coming-at-start-of- season/article_d0ad593f-831f-59f3-a605-f2ed029a6598.html ==Member schools== ===Current members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !School !Location !Joined !Type !Enrollment !Nickname !Colors !All-Sports Conference |- ! colspan=\"9\" style=\"background:#000000; color:white;\" | Legends Division |- |Benzie Central |Benzonia Township |2014 |Public |421 |Huskies | |Northwest Conference |- |Cheboygan |Cheboygan |2016 |Public |594 |Chiefs | |Independent |- |Grayling |Frederic Township |2014 |Public |431 |Vikings | |Lake Michigan Conference |- |Kingsley |Kingsley |2014 |Public |473 |Stags | |Northwest Conference |- |Sault Ste.
