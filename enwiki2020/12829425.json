    "text": "44 Magnum (stylized as 44MAGNUM) are a Japanese heavy metal band, originally formed in Osaka Prefecture in mid-1977. They were one of the first Japanese metal bands. ==History== After the group disbanded in 1989, they had a thirteen-year hiatus before reuniting and releasing their seventh album Ignition in 2002. In 2009, they released the self-titled album 44Magnum, which features Paul's son Stevie as a lead singer along with Paul on most of the tracks. In early 2012, frontman and sole original member Paul announced he would stop performing live with 44 Magnum to focus on treatment for Parkinson's disease, which he was diagnosed with in 2005. However, he will continue to record and write songs with the band. ==Members== * Tatsuya \"Paul\" Umehara \u2013 vocals (1977\u20131989, 2002\u2013present) * Satoshi \"Jimmy\" Hirose \u2013 guitar (1979\u20131989, 2002\u2013present) * Satoshi \"Joe\" Miyawaki \u2013 drums (1982\u20131988, 2002\u2013present) * Stevie Umehara \u2013 vocals (2009\u2013present) * Hironori \"Ban\" Yoshikawa \u2013 bass (1979\u20131989, 2002\u20132009, 2013\u2013present) ;Former members * Akira Nagamori \u2013 guitar * Taka Tanaka \u2013 bass * Hirofumi Miyamoto \u2013 drums * Teruki Iga \u2013 drums (1979\u20131982) * Shuse (La'cryma Christi) - bass (2009\u20132012) * Anarchy Bad Ray - support - bass (\"Live at Alive\" in 2010) ==Timeline== ==Discography== ;Studio albums * Danger (1983) * Street Rock'n Roller (1984) * Actor (1985) * Love or Money (1987) * Emotional Color (1988) * Still Alive (1989) * Ignition (2002) * 44Magnum (2009) * Angel Number (2015) * Prisoner (2019) ;EPs * 44Magnum (1983) * Four Figures (1985) * Beast (2013) ;Singles * \"It's Raining\" (1987) * \"I Miss You\" (1988) ;Live albums * The Live (1985, EP) * Live Act II (1986) * 2016 04 03 04 Special Live (2017) ;Compilations * Anthology (1989) * Live & Rare (2000, 10-CD boxset) * The Bootleg-MK.I (2001, 2CD & DVD) * The Bootleg-MK.II (2011, CD & DVD) * 44Magnum 35th Anniversary Ultimate Collection (March 21, 2012, SHM-CDs) :Includes Danger, Street Rock'n Roller, Actor, Live + Four Figures, Live Act II -Complete- and Ignition. ;Videos * The Beginning (1985) * The Bootleg-MK.I (2001, DVD & 2CD) * Live at Alive (2010) * The Bootleg-MK.II (2011, DVD & CD) * 44Magnum on 30th Anniversary Tour 2013 Bombard Attack (2014) * Bombard Attack 44Magnum on Tour 2014 2014.10.18 Tokyo (2015) * 2016 04 03 04 Special Live (2016) ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Official MySpace Category:Japanese heavy metal musical groups Category:Japanese hard rock musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1977 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1989 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2002 Category:Musical quintets Category:Musical groups from Osaka Prefecture ",
