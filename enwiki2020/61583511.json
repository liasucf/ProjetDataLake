    "text": "The Battle of Aden, also known as the Battle for Aden or the Aden Battles was a series of clashes in the city of Aden between the pro-Hadi government troops backed by Saudi Arabia and Southern Transitional Council forces backed by the United Arab Emirates. == Clashes == === Battle in Aden === Clashes erupted on 7 August 2019 between the STC and pro-Hadi forces in Aden after a missile strike by Houthis killed several soldiers of Security Belt forces in the city during a military graduation. The soldiers killed included Brig. Gen. Munir Mahmoud Ahmad al-Mashali al-Yafaei, more commonly known as Abu Yamamah al- Yafaei, a leading figure and commander in the Security Belt. The southerners accused the Hadi-led government as well as Al Islah party members who are part of the Hadi-led government but harbor deep resentment with the STC, for enabling the attack. The STC released a statement calling the attack \"treacherous\". The next day, three people were killed and ten were injured in clashes between the pro-Hadi presidential guard based in Aden and southern separatists on 8 August 2019 following the funeral for the victims killed in the Houthi attack. STC took control of Aden's Crater District on 9 August 2019. The STC captured the Badr Camp and the presidential palace on 10 August and a total of 20 people were killed. The Saudi-led coalition launched airstrikes against the STC on the same day. === Ceasefire === Clashes ceased briefly on 11 August 2019 following a meeting between the Saudi Crown Prince and UAE. The STC agreed to withdraw from several checkpoints it had captured during the clashes and UAE denied supporting STC's clashes against the Saudi- led coalition. STC vacated some positions in Aden on 17 August 2019. === Continued clashes === Clashes continued with lower intensity in Aden on 16 August 2019 after STC forces refused to withdraw from some of their captured positions. On 21 August UAE rejected allegations that it was behind the developments in Aden. On 28 August 2019 Hadi-led forces recaptured most of the neighborhoods they had lost to the STC, including Aden's International Airport. By the next day, however, STC forces recaptured most of Aden again. The Hadi-led Government accused the UAE of launching airstrikes against its troops, killing at least 30 === Clashes elsewhere in Yemen === Clashes between the STC and Hadi forces erupted in Shabwah Governorate on 22 August 2019 after STC forces refused to withdraw from al-Akaf checkpoint. There were dead and wounded in the clashes which included heavy weapons. The Hadi government accused the command of the STC for blowing up the situation in Shabwah. Clashes occurred in Abyan Governorate on 20 August 2019 after STC forces took control of a camp in Az Zanjabar; several were killed in the clashes. == See also == *Aden unrest (2015\u2013present) *South Yemen insurgency == References == Category:Conflicts in 2019 Category:Battles involving Yemen Category:2019 in Yemen Category:August 2019 events in Yemen Category:Separatism in Yemen Category:Yemeni Crisis (2011\u2013present) Category:Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present) Category:21st century in Aden Category:2010s in Aden ",
