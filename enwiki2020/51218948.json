    "text": "The Mexico City International Tournament is the original name of the Mexican Open of Badminton that was promoted by both the Mexican Association of Badminton and the Centro Deportivo Chapultepec. The Mexican Open of Badminton is an international tournament organised in Mexico.Herbert A. E. Scheele ed., The International Badminton Federation Handbook for 1965 (Bromley, Kent, England: J. A. Jennings Ltd. 1965) p 212. The first competition was organised in 1949; there were four more editions held in 1952, 1958, 1959 and 1961. Since 1964, the tournament was officially called the Mexican National Open Championship. However, in 2009, the Mexican Association of Badminton decided to start counting the event as a new one; hence, the 2014 Mexican Open is considered as the fifth Mexican Open. The Mexican Open is one of the most important Latin American Badminton Championships together with the Pan American Badminton Championships and Pan American Games. == Winners == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Men\u00b4s singles !Women\u00b4s singles !Men\u00b4s doubles !Women\u00b4s doubles !Mixed doubles |- |1949 |Ernesto Villareal | Margaret Varner | Ernesto Villareal Ruben Mejia |No competition |No competition |- |1952 | Ernesto Villareal | Pat Gallagher | Ernesto Villareal Ruben Mejia | Shirley Fry Peggy Vilbig |No competition |- |1958 | W.
