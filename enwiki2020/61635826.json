It will be the first Brazilian mission in deep space, as well as the first directed to the Moon. The CubeSat will be launched by an Indian rocket PSLV-C11 as part of the Pathfinder mission, which will pioneer deep space commercial exploration through a partnership between British private companies with the UK Space Agency (UKSA) and the European Space Agency (ESA).http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england- cornwall-36774579https://www.sstl.co.uk/Press/2016-News-Archive/SSTL-and- Goonhilly-announce-partnership-and-a-call ==Mission objectives== The Garat\u00e9a-L spacecraft aims to investigate extreme living space conditions by conducting tests that will evaluate the effects of cosmic ray exposure on bacterial colonies and on human tissues, contributing to the area of astrobiology. and space medicine. Since the spacecraft will be placed in a highly eccentric orbit around the Moon, it is also planned to collect multi-spectral images of the South Pole\u2013Aitken basin on the far side of the Moon.http://mensageirosideral.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2016/11/29/grupo-anuncia- projeto-para-lancar-a-primeira-sonda-brasileira-a-orbita-da-lua/ Mission leaders also want to boost Brazilian students' interest in careers related to STEM. ==Preparation and costs== The preparations for the mission are both technical and financial. On the technical side there is the experience in the development of nanosatellites by INPE and ITA. Circuits prepared to avoid radiation problems are worked by IMT, while payload will be developed by Zenith-USP group of EESC (USP). And in turn, the other institutions (LNLS/CNPEM, IQ-USP, IO-USP, UFSC, Microgravity Centre and USRA-EUA) are responsible for the experiments that will be carried out to carry out astrobiological and medical research on microgravity. The financial part will be made possible through private investments (sponsorship, royalties and eventual patents) and public investments (development agencies). The estimated total cost is R$ 35 million, or about $10.3 million dollars.University of Sao Paulo targets the Moon for 2020.
