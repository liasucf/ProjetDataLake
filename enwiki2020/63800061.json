    "text": "Kingdoms of the Dump is an upcoming independent role-playing video game being developed by Roach Games. The game takes heavy inspiration from classic 16-bit JRPGs like EarthBound, Chrono Trigger, and Final Fantasy VI. Development of the game was initially funded fully out-of-pocket, with the developers working full-time as custodians; this inspired the theming of the game around garbage. The developers launched a Kickstarter campaign in July 2019 for additional funding; following its success, they are currently targeting an October 2022 release. The game is planned to release on Microsoft Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux via Steam or a DRM-free copy. == Gameplay == turn-based battle system that employs a 3x3 grid in which the player can strategically position their party. Kingdoms of the Dump is a role-playing game that features platforming and adventure elements. On the field, the player controls one character, but can switch between a total of six characters at will; each character has a unique ability that the player can use to explore the environment, solve puzzles, and progress. Platforming and elevation in general play a large role in the exploration of towns and dungeons. The game does not have random battles; instead, players approach enemies on the field and enter a separate battle screen. Kingdoms of the Dump features a turn-based battle system that employs a 3x3 grid in which the player can position their party around to maximize damage, avoid traps and spells, and strategize. The game takes heavy inspiration from several 16-bit role-playing games. The battle system features timed hits, a mechanic inspired by Super Mario RPG. The player will be able to unlock an airship and be able to traverse a vast Mode 7-like world map, inspired by Final Fantasy VI. The game also uses an \"oblique\" EarthBound-inspired perspective, an angle the developers used to help show depth during platforming segments. == Plot == The game is set in the \"Lands of Fill\", made up of five and a half kingdoms. The king of one of the kingdoms, Garbagia, has been \"trashpicked\", and a disgraced squire, Dustin Binsley, is blamed for it. He must embark on a mission across the kingdoms of the Lands of Fill to rescue the King, clear his name and uncover the evil organization trying to destroy the kingdoms. Dustin, the trashcan knight, is accompanied on his journey by his best friend, Ratavia, librarian Walker Jacket, bard Lute, laundromancer Cerulean, and master of disguise Musk. Along his journey Dustin and his party must also stop the Toxic Grimelin Army and prevent the Lands of Fill from war. == Development and release == Development of Kingdoms of the Dump began in 2016 by Roach Games, made up of pseudonymous developers Roach and Everdredd. Roach had initially been working on an EarthBound fangame titled Eagleland for several years before cancelling it and assembling a new team for an original IP. Roach and Everdredd both work as custodians full-time and funded the game's development out-of-pocket until July 2019, when they launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. The campaign officially launched on July 15, 2019, with a goal of $60,000, and was successfully funded, with a final pledge count of $76,560. Roach primarily took inspiration from several role-playing games on the Super Nintendo, including but not limited to EarthBound, Chrono Trigger, Super Mario RPG, and Final Fantasy VI. Roach and Everdredd's custodial professions inspired the theming of the game as well. The game's art was developed by DM404 using a combination of Microsoft Paint, Adobe Photoshop, and GraphicsGale. The game's music is primarily being composed by Bobby Ghostly, with guest composer William Kage handling music engineering using SNES soundfonts. Composer Hiroki Kikuta will be composing a guest track for the game's soundtrack as well, following the Kickstarter campaign reaching one of its stretch goals. Kingdoms of the Dump is being developed using the Godot game engine, version 2.1. Roach has confirmed that the game will have controller support. The game is currently set for release in October 2022, on Microsoft Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux via Steam or a DRM- free copy; Roach has stated the game will not be exclusive to the Epic Games Store. == References == == External links == * Category:Upcoming video games Category:Windows games Category:macOS games Category:Linux games Category:Platform games Category:Adventure games Category:Indie video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Role-playing video games ",
