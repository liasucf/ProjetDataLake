He was working in his father's business when Louis Beno\u00eet Alphonse R\u00e9vial (1810-1871) a tenor from Toulouse already studying at the Conservatoire de Paris convinced him to study singing and facilitated his entry to the conservatory in 1830. After studying singing there under Louis Nourrit, Couderc made his debut as Rodolphe in Boieldieu's Le petit chaperon de rouge at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in 1834. He created several roles with the company between 1834 and 1841 and was greatly admired for his acting ability. He sang in Belgium from 1842 until 1850 when he returned to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique where he remained for the rest of his career singing leading tenor and later baritone roles.Duckett, William (ed.) (1853). \"Couderc, Charles\", (). Dictionnaire de la conversation et de la lecture, Vol. 6. M. L\u00e9vy Fr\u00e8res One of Couderc's last role creations was that of Baladon in Jacques Offenbach's Vert-Vert in March 1869. He was originally to have sung the role of the Prince in the premiere of Offenbach's Fantasio the following year. Rehearsals had begun in early 1870, but were suspended when the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War caused the closure of the Paris theatres. When the opera finally premiered in 1872, Couderc had retired from the stage. In his later years he taught at the Paris Conservatory. He died in Paris at the age of 65.Kutsch, Karl-Josef and Riemens, Leo (2004). \"Couderc, Joseph-Antoine- Charles\". Gro\u00dfes S\u00e4ngerlexikon, Vol. 4, p. 929.
