It was released in 2001 on East West Records. ==Background== Acoustica was recorded during three concerts held in February 2001 at the Convento do Beato in Lisbon, Portugal.Acoustica Tour 2001 @ www.the-scorpions.com It was a most unusual set for the band, as Klaus Meine comments on the DVD. The group was supported by female backing vocalists, a percussionist, an extra guitarist, and Christian Kolonovits on keyboards. Kolonovits also collaborated on rearranging the songs for the acoustic set. He had previously worked with the band as a conductor and arranger on the Moment of Glory album. Scorpions performed four new songs: \"Life Is Too Short\", \"Back to You\", \"I Wanted to Cry\" and \"When Love Kills Love\", the last of which was released as a single.When Love Kills Love single @ www.the-scorpions.com All the new songs were featured on the VHS, while \"Back to You\" and five others previously recorder songs were omitted from the CD. Acoustica also contains cover versions of The Cars' \"Drive\", Kansas' \"Dust in the Wind\", and the Queen hit \"Love of My Life\". In 2003, an official 'Platinum Edition' was released by Warner Music Thailand, which coupled the original CD with a VCD. The VCD features behind-the-scenes and rehearsal footage as well as a band interview, conducted in English by a Thai television crew. ==Reception== The album attained gold status in Brazil, and the DVD attained platinum status.
