The sports hall of fame honours athletes, teams, and sport builders that are from the Canadian province of New Brunswick. New nominees to the hall of fame are inducted to the hall of fame on an annual basis. Established in 1970, the organization operates as an independent non-profit charity with a mandate to \"preserve and celebrate\" the sports heritage of New Brunswick. The New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame museum holds exhibits about inducted builders, individual athletes, and groups/teams. ==Museum== The Sports Hall of Fame operates a Sports Museum at 503 Queen Street in the province's capital city of Fredericton. The museum is situated within the John Thurston Clark Memorial Building. The museum is equipped with interactive exhibits and one of the largest collection of charcoal portraits in the province, one for each of its Hall of Fame inductees. The building was originally opened as a customs and post office in 1881. The building was later named after the son of William George Clark, the Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick. The New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame moved into the John Thurston Clark Memorial Building in 1976. ==Hall of Famers== As of 2019, over 250 in individuals and teams have been inducted in the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame. Inductees are formally categorized into two categories, builders or players, the latter category including individual athletes and entire groups or teams.
