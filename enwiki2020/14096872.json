    "text": "Grizzlys Wolfsburg are a professional ice hockey club of the German professional ice hockey league Deutsche Eishockey Liga. They play their games at Eisarena in Wolfsburg. The professional team is named after the title character of The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams, while the parent club is known as EHC Wolfsburg. The team enjoys substantial financial support from the Czech automobile manufacturer \u0160koda Auto, which in turn belongs to the Wolfsburg-based Volkswagen Group. Grizzlys themselves have been engaged in providing support to a nearby bear park. ==History== Wolfsburg earned their first promotion to the DEL in 2004. However after one season, they were relegated back to 2.Bundesliga due to their arena not meeting league standards. In 2006, Eisarena Wolfsburg opened, allowing the club to return to the DEL, where they have remained since. The 2010\u201311 season marked the first time the club advanced to the league championship series, but they were swept by Eisb\u00e4ren Berlin. ==Honors== ===Winners=== *Deutscher Eishockey-Pokal: 2009 ===Runners-up=== *Deutsche Eishockey Liga Championship: 2011, 2016, 2017 ==Season records== Old logo {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Season!!
