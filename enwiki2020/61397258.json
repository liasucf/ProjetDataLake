On March 16, 2020, despite having already canned its episodes, the show suspended airings and its production was put on hiatus due 2020 Luzon enhanced community quarantine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. Its timeslot was temporarily filled by Wildflower, iWant Originals and Tubig at Langis. Thereafter, the show's future would be placed in doubt after the temporary closure of ABS-CBN following the cease and desist order issued by the National Telecommunications Commission on account of its franchise expiration. However, on June 4, 2020, it was announced that the show would make its return on June 15, 2020 with a brand new season on cable-and- satellite channel Kapamilya Channel. ==Reception== ===Ratings=== ===Controversies=== ====Depiction of Butuan City==== The show came under fire early in the show's run for its perceived \"unrealistic\" and \"offensive\" depiction of Butuan. The scene in question was from the show's pilot episode showing the bombing of a market in the city. In a statement, Agusan del Norte 1st District Representative Lawrence Fortun asked ABS-CBN \u201cto immediately air an appropriate disclaimer, review and reconsider the content and story elements of the teleserye in order not to further besmirch the reputation of our historic city.\u201d ABS-CBN, for its part, apologized on January 23, 2020. Its statement read: \u201cABS-CBN would like to apologize to Agusan Del Norte Rep. Lawrence Fortun and the people of Butuan City if the scenes in the TV series \u2018A Soldier\u2019s Heart\u2019 have offended them. While the incident portrayed in the series was fictitious, there was mention of the city name.\u201d \u201cWe would like to assure them that there was no deliberate intention to portray Butuan City negatively in the show. We acknowledge that Butuan is one of the most beautiful and peaceful cities in the country,\u201d it added. On January 24, 2020, ABS-CBN executives headed by Cory Vidanes and Laurenti Dyogi met with Fortun to further clear the issue. After said meeting, Fortun noted that aside from airing specific disclaimers, ABS-CBN has removed all production elements, scenes, and references that may be offensive to Butuan. ==See also== * List of programs broadcast by ABS-CBN * List of programs broadcast by Kapamilya Channel * List of ABS-CBN drama series ==References== ==External links== * * Category:ABS-CBN drama series Category:Philippine action television series Category:Philippine military television series Category:2020 Philippine television series debuts Category:2020 Philippine television series endings Category:Filipino-language television shows Category:Television shows set in the Philippines Category:Television productions suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic ",
