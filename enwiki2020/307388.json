    "text": "Hagar (, H\u0101\u1e21\u0101r, of uncertain origin; H\u0101jar; , Hag\u00e1r; ) is a biblical person in the Book of Genesis. She was an Ancient Egyptian servant of Sarah, who gave her to Abraham to bear a child. The product of the union was Abraham's firstborn, Ishmael, the progenitor of the Ishmaelites, generally taken to be the Arabians. Various commentators have connected her to the Hagrites (sons of Agar), perhaps claiming her as their eponymous ancestor. The name of the Egyptian servant Hagar is documented in the Book of Genesis; she is acknowledged in all Abrahamic religions. Hagar is alluded to in the Quran, and Islam acknowledges her as Abraham's second wife. According to Islamic tradition, Hagar the Egyptian is named as the \"Grand Mother of Arabians\" and her husband Abraham the Mesopotamian as the \"Grand Father of Arabians\". ==Hagar in Genesis== This is a summary of the account of Hagar from and 21. === Hagar and Abraham === Sarah offering Hagar to Abraham Hagar was the Egyptian slave of Sarah, Abraham's wife. Sarah had been barren for a long time and sought a way to fulfill God's promise to Abraham that Abraham would be father of many nations, especially since they were getting older, so she offered Hagar to Abraham as a second wife. Hagar became pregnant, and tension arose between the two women. Sarah complained to Abraham, and treated Hagar harshly, and Hagar ran away. Hagar fled into the desert on her way to Shur. At a spring en route, an angel appeared to Hagar, who instructed her to return to Sarah, so that she may bear a child who \"shall be a wild ass of a man: his hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren\" (). Then she was told to call her son Ishmael. Afterward, Hagar referred to God as \"El Roi\".13 And she called the name of the that spoke unto her, Thou art a God of seeing; for she said: 'Have I even here seen Him that seeth Me?' She then returned to Abraham and Sarah, and soon gave birth to a son, whom she named as the angel had instructed. ===Hagar cast out=== Francesco Cozza Later, Sarah gave birth to Isaac, and the tension between the women returned. At a celebration after Isaac was weaned, Sarah found the teenage Ishmael mocking her son. She was so upset by it that she demanded that Abraham send Hagar and her son away. She declared that Ishmael would not share in Isaac's inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed but God told Abraham to do as his wife commanded because God's promise would be carried out through Isaac; Ishmael would be made into a great nation as well because he was Abraham's offspring. Early the next morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. Abraham gave Hagar bread and water then sent them into the wilderness of Beersheba. She and her son wandered aimlessly until their water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, she burst into tears. God heard her and her son crying and came to rescue them. The angel opened Hagar's eyes and she saw a well of water. He also told Hagar that God would \"make a great nation\" of Ishmael. Hagar found her son a wife from Egypt and they settled in the Desert of Paran. ==Religious views== ===Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed traditions=== According to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, the B\u00e1b was a descendant of Abraham and Hagar,Apocalypse Secrets: Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Interpretation of the Book of Revelation, p. 219, John Able (2011) and God made a promise to spread Abraham's seed. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Publishing House released a text on the wives and concubines of Abraham and traces their lineage to five different religions.Spirit of Faith: The Oneness of Humanity, p. 142, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Publishing (2011) ===Christianity=== Hagar in the Wilderness by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. In the New Testament, Paul the Apostle made Hagar's experience an allegory of the difference between law and grace in his Epistle to the Galatians chapter 4 ().Zondervan Illustrated Bible Dictionary, 2011, p. 561 Paul links the laws of the Torah, given on Mount Sinai, to the bondage of the Israelite people, implying that it was signified by Hagar's condition as a bondswoman, while the \"free\" heavenly Jerusalem is signified by Sarah and her child. The Biblical Mount Sinai has been referred to as \"Agar\", possibly named after Hagar.Charles Forster (1844). The Historical Geography of Arabia, Duncan and Malcolm, p. 182. Augustine of Hippo referred to Hagar as symbolizing an \"earthly city\", or sinful condition of humanity: \"In the earthly city (symbolised by Hagar) ... we find two things, its own obvious presence and the symbolic presence of the heavenly city. New citizens are begotten to the earthly city by nature vitiated by sin but to the heavenly city by grace freeing nature from sin.\" (The City of God 15:2) This view was expounded on by medieval theologians such as Thomas Aquinas and John Wycliffe. The latter compared the children of Sarah to the redeemed, and those of Hagar to the unredeemed, who are \"carnal by nature and mere exiles\".Jeffrey, David L., A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1992, p. 326 The story of Hagar demonstrates that survival is possible even under harshest conditions.Susanne Scholz, \"Gender, Class, and Androcentric Compliance in the Rapes of Enslaved Women in the Hebrew Bible\", Lectio Difficilior (European Electronic Journal for Feminist Exegisis), 1/2004 (see especially section \"The Story of Hagar (Genesis 16:1\u201316; 21:9\u201321)\". ===Islam=== H\u0101jar or Haajar (Arabic: \u0647\u0627\u062c\u0631), is the Arabic name used to identify the wife of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (Abraham) and the mother of Ism\u0101'\u012bl (Ishmael). Although not mentioned by name in the Qur'an, she is referenced and alluded to via the story of her husband. She is a revered woman in the Islamic faith. According to Muslim belief, she was the Egyptian handmaiden of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm's first wife Sara (Sarah). She eventually settled in the Desert of Paran with her son Ism\u0101'\u012bl. H\u0101jar is honoured as an especially important matriarch of monotheism, as it was through Ism\u0101'\u012bl that Muhammad would come. Neither Sara nor H\u0101jar are mentioned by name in the Qur'an, but the story is traditionally understood to be referred to in a line from Ibr\u0101h\u012bm's prayer in Sura Ibrahim (14:37): \"I have settled some of my family in a barren valley near your Sacred House.\"Barbara Freyer Stowasser, Women in the Qur'an, Traditions, and Interpretation, New York: Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 47. While H\u0101jar is not named, the reader lives H\u0101jar's predicament indirectly through the eyes of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. She is also frequently mentioned in the books of hadiths. According to the Qisas Al-Anbiya, a collection of tales about the prophets, H\u0101jar was the daughter of the King of Maghreb, a descendant of Salih. Her father was killed by Pharaoh Dhu l-'arsh and she was captured and taken as a slave. Later, because of her royal blood, she was made mistress of the female slaves and given access to all of Pharaoh's wealth. Upon conversion to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm's faith, the Pharaoh gave H\u0101jar to Sara who gave her to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. In this account, the name \"H\u0101jar\" (called Hajar in Arabic) comes from Ha ajruka, Arabic for \"here is your recompense\". According to another tradition, H\u0101jar was the daughter of the Egyptian king, who gave her to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm as a wife, thinking Sara was his sister. According to Ibn Abbas, Ism\u0101'\u012bl's birth to H\u0101jar caused strife between her and Sara, who was still barren. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm brought H\u0101jar and their son to a land called Paran-aram or (Faran in Arabic, in latter days held to be the land surrounding Mecca). The objective of this journey was to \"resettle\" rather than \"expel\" H\u0101jar. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm left H\u0101jar and Ism\u0101'\u012bl under a tree and provided them with water. H\u0101jar, learning that God had ordered Ibr\u0101h\u012bm to leave her in the desert of Paran, respected his decision. The Muslim belief is that God tested Ibr\u0101h\u012bm by ordering this task. H\u0101jar soon ran out of water, and Ism\u0101'\u012bl, an infant by that time, began to cry from hunger/thirst. H\u0101jar panicked and ran between two nearby hills, Al-Safa and Al-Marwah, repeatedly in search for water. After her seventh run, an angel appeared over the location of the Zamzam and then hit the ground with his heel (or his wing) and caused a miraculous well to spring out of the ground. This is called the Zamzam Well and is located a few metres from the Kaaba in Mecca. The incidentMuhammad, Martin Lings, Chapter 1. The House of God, Suhail Academy Publishing of her running between the Al-Safa and Al-Marwah hills is remembered by Muslims when they perform their pilgrimage (Hajj) at Mecca. Part of the pilgrimage is to run seven times between the hills, in commemoration of H\u0101jar's courage and faith in God as she searched for water in the desert (which is believed to have then miraculously appeared from the Zamzam Well), and to symbolize the celebration of motherhood in Islam. To complete the task, some Muslims also drink from the Zamzam Well and take some of the water back home from pilgrimage in memory of H\u0101jar. ===Rabbinical commentary=== Rabbinical commentators asserted that Hagar was Pharaoh's daughter. The midrash Genesis Rabbah states it was when Sarah was in Pharaoh's harem that he gave her his daughter Hagar as servant, saying: \"It is better that my daughter should be a servant in the house of such a woman than mistress in another house\". Sarah treated Hagar well, and induced women who came to visit her to visit Hagar also. However Hagar, when pregnant by Abraham, began to act superciliously toward Sarah, provoking the latter to treat her harshly, to impose heavy work upon her, and even to strike her (ib. 16:9). Some Jewish commentators identify Hagar with Keturah ( Q\u0259\u1e6dur\u0254h), the woman Abraham married after the death of Sarah, stating that Abraham sought her out after Sarah's death. It is suggested that Keturah was Hagar's personal name, and that \"Hagar\" was a descriptive label meaning \"stranger\".\"The Return of Hagar\", commentary on Parshat Chayei Sarah, Chabad.\"Who Was Ketura?\", Bar-Ilan University's Parashat Hashavua Study Center, 2003.\"Parshat Chayei Sarah\" , Torah Insights, Orthodox Union, 2002. This interpretation is discussed in the MidrashBereshit Rabbah 61:4. and is supported by Rashi, Judah Loew ben Bezalel, Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz, and Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura. Rashi argues that \"Keturah\" was a name given to Hagar because her deeds were as beautiful as incense (hence: ketores), and/or that she remained chaste from the time she was separated from Abraham\u2014 derives from the Aramaic word \"restrained\". The contrary view (that Keturah was someone other than Hagar) is advocated by the Rashbam, Abraham ibn Ezra, David Kimhi, and Nachmanides. They were listed as two different people in the genealogies in . ==Arts and literature== The Banishment of Hagar by Jan Mostaert, c. 1520\u201325, Thyssen- Bornemisza Museum. Many artists have painted scenes from the story of Hagar and Ismael in the desert, including Pieter Lastman, Gustave Dor\u00e9, Frederick Goodall and James Eckford Lauder. William Shakespeare refers to Hagar in The Merchant of Venice Act II Scene 5 line 40 when Shylock says \"What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?\" This line refers to the character Launcelot, whom Shylock is insulting by comparing him to the outcast Ishmael. It also reverses the conventional Christian interpretation by portraying the Christian character as the outcast. Hagar's destitution and desperation are used as an excuse for criminality by characters in the work of Daniel Defoe, such as Moll Flanders, and the conventional view of Hagar as the mother of outcasts is repeated in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's play Zapolya, whose heroine is assured that she is \"no Hagar's offspring; thou art the rightful heir to an appointed king.\" Hagar and the Angel, by Cecco Bravo In the nineteenth century a more sympathetic portrayal became prominent, especially in America. Edmonia Lewis, the early African-American and Native American sculptor, made Hagar the subject of one of her most well-known works. She said it was inspired by \"strong sympathy for all women who have struggled and suffered\". In novels and poems Hagar herself, or characters named Hagar, were depicted as unjustly suffering exiles. These include the long dramatic poem Hagar by Eliza Jane Poitevent Nicholson (pen name Pearl Rivers), president of the National Woman's Press Association; Hagar in the Wilderness by Nathaniel Parker Willis, the highest-paid magazine writer of his day; and Hagar's Farewell by Augusta Moore. In 1913 this was joined by the overtly feminist novel Hagar, by the American Southern socialist and suffragist Mary Johnston's.Mary Johnston, Suffragist Marjorie Spruill Wheeler The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography Vol. 100, No. 1, \"Working out Her Destiny\": Virginia Women's History (Jan., 1992), pp. 99\u2013118 (article consists of 20 pages), published by Virginia Historical Society Hall Caine gave the name A Son of Hagar to 1885 book set in contemporary England and dealing with the theme of illegitimacy. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet's unfinished painting of Hagar and Ishmael. A similarly sympathetic view prevails in more recent literature. The novel The Stone Angel by Margaret Laurence has a protagonist named Hagar married to a man named Bram, whose life story loosely imitates that of the biblical Hagar. A character named Hagar is prominently featured in Toni Morrison's novel Song of Solomon, which features numerous Biblical themes and allusions. In the 1979 novel Kindred, by Octavia Butler, the protagonist Dana has an ancestor named Hagar (born into slavery) whom we meet towards the end of the novel, as part of Dana's time travel back to Maryland in the 1800s. Hagar is mentioned briefly in Salman Rushdie's controversial novel The Satanic Verses, where Mecca is replaced with 'Jahilia', a desert village built on sand and served by Hagar's spring. Hagar is mentioned, along with Bilhah and Zilpah, in Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, a dystopian novel which centres around the women whose duty it is to produce children for their masters, assuming the place of their wives in a rape ceremony based upon the biblical passage. In the recent book of nonfiction, The Woman Who Named God: Abraham's Dilemma and the Birth of Three Faiths, by Charlotte Gordon provides an account of Hagar's life from the perspectives of the three monotheistic religions, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. ==Contemporary influence== ===Israel=== Since the 1970s, the custom has arisen of giving the name \"Hagar\" to newborn female babies. The giving of this name is often taken as a controversial political act, marking the parents as being supporters of reconciliation with the Palestinians and Arab World, and is frowned upon by many, including nationalists and the religious. The connotations of the name were represented by the founding of the Israeli journal Hagar: Studies in Culture, Polity and Identities in 2000.Oren Yiftachel, Launching Hagar: Marginality, Beer-Sheva, Critique Retrieved 2015-10-16 ===African Americans=== Several black American feminists have written about Hagar, comparing her story to those of slaves in American history. Wilma Bailey, in an article entitled \"Hagar: A Model for an Anabaptist Feminist\", refers to her as a \"maidservant\" and \"slave\". She sees Hagar as a model of \"power, skills, strength and drive\". In the article \"A Mistress, A Maid, and No Mercy\", Renita J. Weems argues that the relationship between Sarah and Hagar exhibits \"ethnic prejudice exacerbated by economic and social exploitation\".Bailey, Wilma Ann Black and Jewish women consider Hagar, Encounter, Winter 2002 ===Assisted reproduction=== Hagar bearing a child for an infertile woman is an example of what is now called surrogacy or contractual gestation, except in Hagar's case she had no choice in the matter. Critics of this and other assisted reproductive technologies have used Hagar in their analysis. As early as 1988, Anna Goldman-Amirav in Reproductive and Genetic Engineering wrote of Hagar within \"the Biblical 'battle of the wombs' [which] lay the foundation for the view of women, fertility, and sexuality in the patriarchal society\".Goldman-Amirav, Anna (1988). \"Behold, the Lord Hath Restrained Me from Bearing\" , Reproductive and Genetic Engineering: Journal of International Feminist Analysis Volume 1 Number 3. ===Family tree=== ==See also== * Abraham and Hagar * Abraham and Ishmael * Lech-Lecha * Vayera * Hagar in Islam ==References== ==External links== * Category:20th-century BC people Category:20th-century BC women Category:Abraham Category:Book of Genesis people Category:Ancient Egyptians Category:Angelic visionaries Category:Jewish concubines Category:Servants Category:Lech-Lecha Category:Vayeira Category:Women in the Hebrew Bible ",
