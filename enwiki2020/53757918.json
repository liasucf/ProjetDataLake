    "text": "Visitation is a studio album by American jazz bassist Sam Jones which was recorded in March, 1978 for the Danish SteepleChase Records label. This is his ninth album as a leader. The record was re-released on CD in 1994 and as a LP in 2014 with three bonus tracks. ==Reception== Ken Dryden of Allmusic noted \"this 1978 session, just a few years prior to his premature death, finds him leading a powerful post-bop quintet, his regular group at the time, with cornetist Terumasa Hino, tenor saxophonist Bob Berg, pianist Ronnie Mathews, and drummer Al Foster. Jones primarily plays a supporting role through a good part of the date, though he is prominently featured in the interpretation of Paul Chambers' \"Visitation,\" while he also revisits his breezy bop vehicle \"Del Sasser.\" Reviewer of Jazz Journal wrote \"this latest album by Sam Jones is well up to standard....an excellent band....As for Sam Jones, he is in splendid form on all tracks, perhaps inspired by the feeling that he has managed to gather about him a cracking good band.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Band *Ronnie Mathews \u2013 baby grand piano *Sam Jones \u2013 bass *Terumasa Hino \u2013 cornet *Al Foster \u2013 drums *Bob Berg \u2013 tenor saxophone Production *Per Grunnet \u2013 cover *J\u00f8rgen Frig\u00e5rd \u2013 liner notes *Freddy Hansson \u2013 mixing *Nils Winther \u2013 producer, photography *Elvin Campbell \u2013 recording == References == Category:Sam Jones (musician) albums Category:1978 albums Category:SteepleChase Records albums ",
