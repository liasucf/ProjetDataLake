    "text": "The Battle of Brumath in 356 AD was part of Roman Emperor Julian's campaigns against the Germanic tribes. Following the Battle of Reims, Julian's forces pursued several Germanic war bands through the Gallic countryside. Outside Brocomagus (Brumath), one war band met Julian in open battle and the Romans were victorious. > Hearing therefore that Strasburg, Brumath, Saverne, Seltz, Speyer, Worms, > and Mayence were held by the savages, who were living on their lands (for > the towns themselves they avoid as if they were tombs surrounded by nets), > he first of all seized Brumath, but while he was still approaching it a band > of Germans met him and offered battle. Julian drew up his forces in the form > of a crescent, and when the fight began to come to close quarters, the enemy > were overwhelmed by a double danger; some were captured, others were slain > in the very heat of the battle, and rest got away, saved by recourse to > speed. Although casualties were not numerous,Goldsworthy, In the Name of Rome, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 2003 the Germanic defeat was sufficiently great to have a deterrent effect on other tribal groups in the area, and to partially restore order.Goldsworthy, In the Name of Rome, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 2003, Following Brumath, Julian went on to re-occupy Cologne (Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium), and then went into winter quarters in Senonae, modern Sens, where he was besieged by Frankish forces. ==References== Category:356 Brumath Brumath Brumath Brumath Category:History of Bas-Rhin Category:350s in the Roman Empire Category:4th century Category:4th century in Roman Gaul Category:Julian (emperor) ",
