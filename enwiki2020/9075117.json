    "text": "The Manchester Road Race is a 4.748 mile (7.641 km) footrace held annually on Thanksgiving Day in Manchester, Connecticut. Race proceeds are donated each year to Muscular Dystrophy research and about 18 other local charities. Beginning promptly at 10:00am every Thanksgiving Morning, the race attracts athletes of all ages and abilities. First run in 1927, the race regularly attracts accomplished runners from across the United States as well as internationally recognized competitors. ==History== The race was first held in 1927 with only twelve runners participating in the race. The race was conceived and promoted by the captain of the Manchester High School cross country team Frank \"Duke\" Haraburda, who competed and placed second in the inaugural race. The race continued annually until 1934, when the economic crisis during the Great Depression resulted in the race's cancellation. Consequently, the race was not held for 10 years (from 1935 to 1944), but began running again from 1945 to 2019, and will resume in 2021.Manchester Road Race Celebrates 70th Running In 1967 the race was recognized as the second largest race in the country, with more than 200 participants. Due to growing interest and participation in this event, the race surpassed 1,000 runners in 1976 and just ten years later attracted more than 6,000 runners. In 1994 the number of runners had reached 10,000 and in 2009 over 12,000 people officially ran the race. \"The Manchester Road Race has grown to be the largest race in Connecticut, the third largest in New England and in the top 25 largest distance races in the country.\" (Manchester Road Race Committee) In 1960, Julia Chase-Brand entered Manchester in hopes of participating in the road race, but she was turned down due to her gender.

The runners will go off in waves of 25 people using designated start marks.https://www.fox61.com/article/sports/manchester-road-race/manchester- road-race-2020-covid-19-plans- registration/520-65788e22-792a-4255-8aff-9990a7fbcfed ==Overview== The official registration has been over 9,000 every year since 1991, with the highest registration of 15,000 in 2010.

The race committee estimates that approximately 1,000 unregistered runners participated in the 2005 race.2005 Manchester Road Race Summary In addition to the competitive spirit of the road race, Manchester Road Race enthusiasts are attracted every year to further enhance the good spirit of the event. Also giving this race a unique and high-spirited atmosphere, runners and fans wear costumes and may enter a competition to see who has the best costume each year. Famous among these costumed runners are the \"Blues Brothers\" and \"Safety Man.\" Of note, \"Safety Man\" also reminds runners and the crowd lining the streets that a safe morning means an enjoyable Thanksgiving afternoon. In a historic Manchester Road Race tradition preceding the race, \"Safety Man\" will lead the cavalcade of elite runners and alert spectators along the course that the race has begun and runners are approaching. ==Notable runners== ===Joe McCluskey=== Years won: 1930, 1931, 1932, 1947 Joe McCluskey was an American Olympic bronze medalist in the 1932 steeplechase who is recognized for winning the race four times.

This was a bit controversial, since they should have rounded up to 21:20, but they gave him a tie anyway, because they didn't know how they had rounded, up or down, back in 1995 when Philemon Hanneck set the record, because they didn't have the technology to determine his time in tenths of a second. ===Edward Cheserek=== Year won: 2018 Edward Cheserek, a Kenyan-born athlete who ran for the University of Oregon, set the course record in 2018 with a time of 21:16. ==See also== *Turkey Trot *Road running ==References== ==External links== *Official Manchester Road Race website Category:Long- distance running competitions Category:Sports in Manchester, Connecticut Category:Tourist attractions in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Road running competitions in the United States ",
