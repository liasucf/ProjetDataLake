    "text": "The Complexo do Alem\u00e3o massacre () was the result of an ongoing conflict between drug dealers and the police in the borough of the same name in Rio de Janeiro, which consisted of a group of large favelas in the northern region of the city. The massacre happened on June 27, 2007, when a large Military and Civil Police operation killed 19 people and injured several others. The Order of Attorneys of Brazil issued a report claiming that at least eleven of the people killed had no relations with drug trafficking whatsoever.\"OAB suspeita de execu\u00e7\u00e3o em opera\u00e7\u00e3o no Rio\" (\"OAB suspects of execution in police operation in Rio\") . \u00daltimo Segundo. June 29, 2007. Retrieved November 2, 2007. Until the end of the XV Pan-American Games a large siege was formed by the police in the region--to secure the safety of the international event, some people claim.\"O Haiti \u00e9 aqui, no Complexo do Alem\u00e3o\" (\"Haiti is here, in the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o\") . Luciana Candido. United Socialist Workers' Party website. June 29, 2007. Retrieved November 2, 2007. While it eventually got attached the demotic sobriquet Gaza strip, a report published by the federal government revealed that there were executions at the operation.\"Relat\u00f3rio da Uni\u00e3o acusa opera\u00e7\u00e3o policial no Rio de \"execu\u00e7\u00e3o sum\u00e1ria\" (\"Federal government report accuses the operation in Rio of being an execution\"). Folha de S.Paulo. November 1, 2007. Retrieved November 2, 2007. ==Victims== ===Killed=== According to official records as of late-June 2007, at least 44 people were killed by the police in Complexo do Alem\u00e3o since May 2, 2007. Nineteen people were killed by the police at the June 27, 2007 operation. ==Response== ===Federal government=== The Special Secretariat for Human Rights, an office attached to the Office of the President of the Republic, issued a report claiming that there were executions at the operation, beside the fact that no exact number is given. Accordingly, the nineteen people killed received an average of 3.84 shots each. Fourteen were killed with a shot in the upper part of the body, six of them in the face. ===Rio de Janeiro government=== Jos\u00e9 Mariano Beltrame, the officer in charge of the Public Security Department in the state of Rio de Janeiro, responded to the federal government report by saying that \"it was done in a hurry by those who misrepresent the fair cause of the human rights. This report reveal little about the facts, generating just a confusion\". Also according to him, the federal government report is \"disqualified\" because the forensic doctors have not gone to Rio de Janeiro after the operation. ==See also== *List of massacres in Brazil ==References== Category:2007 crimes in Brazil Category:Mass murder in 2007 Category:Massacres in Brazil Category:June 2007 events in South America Category:Organized crime conflicts in Brazil Category:Police brutality in Brazil Category:2007 murders in South America Category:2000s murders in Brazil ",
