    "text": "Erin Leslie Fleming (August 13, 1941 - April 15, 2003 citing U.S. Social Security Administration, Death Master File, database (Alexandria, Virginia: National Technical Information Service, ongoing).) was a Canadian actress best known as the companion and manager of Groucho Marx in his final years. ==Early career== Fleming was born Marilyn Suzette Fleming on August 13, 1941, in New Liskeard, Ontario, Canada. She appeared in minor roles in six films between 1965 and 1976, during which time she became acquainted with Groucho Marx and was hired as his secretary. She appeared in the 1972 Woody Allen movie Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask). ==Relationship with Groucho Marx== Fleming's influence and relationship with Marx were controversial. She was initially (and extemporaneously) hired as his secretary, but eventually assumed the role of his manager. Many close to Marx acknowledged that she did much to revive his popularity, by arranging a series of personal appearances and one-man shows culminating in a sold-out performance at Carnegie Hall, which was released on a best-selling record album. She also lobbied for the honorary Academy Award Marx received in 1974. Others, including Groucho's son Arthur, charged her with embezzling money and pushing the increasingly frail Marx to the limits of his endurance, largely for her own personal gain. There were also charges of mental and possibly physical abuse. Marx's friend, writer Sidney Sheldon wrote a roman \u00e0 clef on Fleming's relationship with Marx titled A Stranger in the Mirror, published in 1976. In a 1993 television adaptation, Lori Loughlin performed the role inspired by Fleming. Marx died in August 1977. Litigation over his estate, which extended into the early 1980s, was eventually resolved in favour of Arthur Marx; Fleming was ordered to repay $472,000 to the Marx estate. ==Later life and death== Fleming was a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic. She was arrested in June, 1990 on suspicion of carrying a concealed loaded firearm, which she brought into the West Hollywood sheriff's office. She spent much of the last decade of her life impoverished, homeless, delusional, and in and out of various psychiatric facilities. Fleming died of suicide in Hollywood on April 15, 2003, at age 61. She is buried in Hornings Mills Cemetery, Horning's Mills, Ontario.Resting Places ==Filmography== * The Legend of Blood Mountain (1965) - Phyllis Stinson * Hercules in New York (1970) * Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) - Cafe Customer (uncredited) * Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (1972) - The Girl * Sheila Levine Is Dead and Living in New York (1975) - Girl * McCullough's Mountain (1975) - Phyllis Stinson ===Television=== * The Dick Cavett Show (December 16, 1971-1972) - Herself * Adam-12 (Episode: \"Venice Division\", 1973) - Suzanne Martin ==Sources== * Stefan Kanfer, Groucho: The Life and Times of Julius Henry Marx (2000), * Miriam Marx Allen, Love, Groucho: Letters from Groucho Marx to his Daughter Miriam (1992), * Arthur Marx, My Life with Groucho (1992) revised from Life With Groucho (1954), * Steve Stoliar, Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House (1996), * Charlotte Chandler, Hello, I Must Be Going (1978), ==References== ==External links== * from the May 9, 1977 issue of People. * an article by Erin Fleming from the July 1983 issue of Movie Star. * 'The Marx Brothers Council Podcast' episode featuring a 1979 interview with Erin Fleming * Category:1941 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Canadian film actresses Category:Canadian television actresses Category:People from Temiskaming Shores Category:Canadian actresses who committed suicide Category:Suicides by firearm in California Category:Actresses from Ontario Category:20th-century Canadian actresses ",
