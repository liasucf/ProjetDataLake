    "text": "C2 Montr\u00e9al is a nonprofit organization which holds an annual 3-day international conference in Montreal, Quebec. Its intention is to stimulate the economy in the province of Quebec by facilitating collaboration and networking within the business and creative communities. The conference was conceived by the Montreal-based creative agency Sid Lee in partnership with Cirque du Soleil and has been held every year in May since 2012. C2 Montr\u00e9al is subsidized by profits generated by C2 International Inc. == Conference == Intended to represent an \"intersection of commerce and creativity\" (the \"Cs\" of C2), C2 Montr\u00e9al was founded in 2012 by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bouchard from Sid Lee and Daniel Lamarre from Cirque du Soleil, with Beno\u00eet Berthiaume appointed as executive producer at the time. It is held every year in Montreal, Quebec in the month of May. Over 72 partners currently sponsor the conference, including Royal Bank of Canada, Cirque du Soleil, Solotech, BMW, and Facebook. Formal minutes following the conference have been made available since 2015. The conference requires active participation from the attendees. Participant activities include attending speaker segments, participating in workshops, and one-on-one meetings with other participants (referred to as \u201cBraindates\u201d). Due to the media exposure generated by the conference, attending participants are required to agree to a recording and image waiver. === History === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Theme(s) ! colspan=\"3\" |Speakers !Attendees |- |2012 |Thinking Pattern Multi-disciplinary Thinking Creative Spaces Corporate Culture Flexible Business Models Research and Development Success Indicators Collective Creation Path Dependency Startup Mentality |Francis Ford Coppola Marc Chapman Patrick Pichette Arianna Huffington Michael Eisner Robert Safian |Winy Maas Daniel Lamarre Ian Schrager Jennifer Yuh Nelson Robert Wong Bertrand Cesvet |Dr. Rex Jung Carl Bass Lotfi EL-Ghandouri Sakchin Bessette Jonah Lehrer Deborah Dugan |1,500 participants |- |2013 |Connection Inspiration Experimentation Celebration |Sir Richard Branson Barry Diller Philippe Starck Neri Oxman Diane von F\u00fcrstenburg Arkadi Kuhlmann Chris Bangle |Fred Dust Tom Gentile John Mackey Tracey Bleckzinski Blake Mycoskie Andy Nulman |Stephan Ouaknine Nicole Piasecki Will Travis Hilary Mason Sanjay Poonen Steve Brown |2,500 participants |- |2014 |Inspiration Experimentation & Connection Celebration |James Cameron Prof. Muhammad Yunus Tony Hsieh Abigail Posner Bobby Dekeyser Stefan Sagmeister Bjarke Ingels Zita Cobb Simon Berry Esther Lee |Ray Davis John Hardy Denys Lapointe Noreena Hertz Philip Sheppard Andrew Wilson Jonas T\u00e5hlin James Murphy Nathalie Bondil Jonathan Becher |Kevin O'Brien Marie Saint Pierre Rad Hourani Welby Altidor Graham Douglas Rafik Belmesk Catherine Hoke Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud George Stromboulopoulos |4,000 participants |- |2015 |Choices |Alec Baldwin Chelsea Clinton Andre Agassi Carolyn Everson Kimbal Musk Leilani M\u00fcnter Jonathan Martin Phyllis Lambert David Shing |Morten Alb\u00e6k Bertrand Piccard Andr\u00e9 Borschberg Marika Anthony-Shaw Terry Stuart Adam Garone Jane McGonigal David Rose Kara Medoff Barnett Michelle Dennedy |Ayah Bdeir Marije Vogelzang Alex Kazaks Joe Kiani David Edelman Carsten Thoma Jordan Brown Rangu Salgame Robert T.

For its first conference in 2012, the organization received grants totalling 40% of its total budget from the federal government. In 2017, the grants had been reduced to 15% of the organization's total budget as C2 Montr\u00e9al had successfully secured more significant funding from their private sponsors. The Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions, an agency working within the Government of Canada providing assistance to Quebec-based organizations, has awarded a $1.5 million non-repayable grant to C2 Montreal, with half of the amount allocated to the 2018 conference and the other half allocated to the upcoming 2019 conference. == C2 International Inc. == Created in 2015, C2 International Inc. specializes in the facilitation and logistical services for international high-profile events. It is owned by the Montreal- based creative agency Sid Lee. Earnings gained by C2 International finance C2 Montr\u00e9al. The for-profit company shares expenses with C2 Montr\u00e9al, which includes employees. C2 International also produces the Movin' On Summit and C2 Melbourne (now cancelled). === C2 Melbourne === C2 International was preparing for the C2 Melbourne conference, scheduled for October 2018. Arrangements for this event came to a halt upon an announcement from its creator Martin Enault, claiming health issues. It would later be confirmed by current president of C2 Montr\u00e9al, Richard St-Pierre, that low ticket sales and the retraction of a major partner were the cause of cessation of C2 Melbourne. Thirty employees were discharged from C2 International as a result. == Criticism == Economics professors Fran\u00e7ois Vaillancourt of Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and Amine Ouazad of HEC Montr\u00e9al stated that C2 Montr\u00e9al's $167.5 million economic impact affirmed in a 2017 study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers produced \"exaggerated\" claims. The professors declared issues with the study, one being that C2 Montr\u00e9al doesn't follow the method mandated by Tourisme Qu\u00e9bec to calculate economic impact, and the other being that the value of the contracts between the participating Qu\u00e9bec institutions and C2 Montr\u00e9al is unknown. ==References== Category:2012 establishments in Quebec Category:Business in Canada Category:Non-profit organizations based in Montreal ",
