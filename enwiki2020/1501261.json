He earned the job of \"left-handed bat off the bench\" on the opening day roster in by batting .296 with a team high three home runs during spring training, and quickly moved into a platoon with Cleon Jones in left field. In the first game of a September 8 doubleheader with the St. Louis Cardinals, Milner became the first Mets rookie in franchise history to record a five-hit game. For the season, he batted .238 with a team high 17 home runs and 38 runs batted in to finish third in National League Rookie of the Year balloting behind teammate Jon Matlack.

He returned to the club in mid-May, but went into a 12-for-82 slump that saw his batting average fall to .216. He returned to form by the end of the season to lead his team with 72 runs batted in and a career high 23 home runs as the Mets completed their improbable run to their second National League East crown. The Mets pulled off the surprise victory over Cincinnati's \"Big Red Machine\" in the 1973 National League Championship Series, but lost in seven games to the Oakland Athletics in the 1973 World Series.

Milner was dealt from the Mets to the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first four- team blockbuster deal in Major League Baseball history on December 8, 1977 that also involved the Texas Rangers, Atlanta Braves and a total of eleven players changing teams. The Pirates also acquired Bert Blyleven from the Rangers. The Mets got from the Braves Willie Monta\u00f1ez and from the Rangers Tom Grieve and Ken Henderson who was sent to New York to complete the transaction three months later on March 15, 1978. The Rangers received Al Oliver and Nelson Norman from the Pirates and Jon Matlack from the Mets.
