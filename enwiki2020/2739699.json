    "text": "Metal rubber is a broad, informal name for several conductive plastic polymers with metal ions produced by NanoSonic, Inc, in cooperation with Virginia Tech. This self-assembling nanocomposite is flexible and durable to high and low pressures, temperatures, tensions, most chemical reactions, and retains all of its physical and chemical properties upon being returned to a ground state. NanoSonic\u2019s Metal Rubber\u2122 is an electrically conductive and flexible elastomer. It can be mechanically strained to greater than 1000 percent of its original dimensions while remaining electrically conductive. As Metal Rubber can carry data and electrical power and is environmentally rugged, it has use as a flexible and stretchable electrical conductors in the aerospace/defense, electronics and bioengineering markets. ==Properties== Metal rubber only needs to contain around one percent metal ions to maintain its conductive properties, allowing the material to retain the elastic quality as well as keeping the costly metal component low. Metal rubber has a strain of 300% although the sheet itself can be mechanically strained to greater than 1000% its original dimensions. The elastic modulus is 0.01 GPa and the service resistivity per square sheet is .1\u2013100 ohms. The maximum service temperature 170 degrees Celsius (338 degrees Fahrenheit), while the minimum service temperature is \u201360 degrees Celsius (\u201376 degrees Fahrenheit). It carries an electrical charge that can be used to transport power and data. It is typical of an elastomer to be an insulator but metal rubber is highly conductive like metals. == Applications == Metal Rubber is made through a modified molecular- level self-assembly production process using precursors NanoSonic produces in- house. Materials are manufactured in a variety of sizes and geometries. The possible uses of such a product include superior body armor, durable electronic sensors, various aerospace-building materials, and alternate commercial building materials. Several industries have unique needs that are met by metal rubber's characteristics. 1\\. Aerospace/Defense :Very robust under harsh conditions (High and low temperature/pressure). 2\\. Electronics :Stretchable electrical conductors/sensors. 3\\. Bioengineering Markets :Very flexible but absolutely no corrosion. Very useful for joint replacement instead of heavy metal implants. :The thicker dimensions of the metal rubber can be used for artificial muscles because of the flexibility and conductive properties for bio-electrical signals. ==Current products== NanoSonic currently offers a variety of products that incorporates metal rubbers unique properties. 1\\. Metal Rubber Cables :This product can be used to replace heavy metal power and data cables as well as make conductive fabrics and CNTs. Also used in improved lightweight EMI shielding and can be used as an elastomer cover for hoses and tubing. 2\\. Metal Rubber Shielding :Based on nanostructured metal rubber and carbon nanotubes, it is lightweight, environmentally durable and allows radios wave frequency selection and broadband connection. 3\\. Metal Rubber Sensors :Allows for very thin shear force and pressure sensors in addition to water and wind tunnel analysis at moderate/high air pressure. ==External links== *Science Central \u2013 Metal Rubber video, 2004-Sep-14 *Science Daily's report on Metal Rubber *NanoSonic's website *Video of Electrostatic Self-Assembly Process Animation Category:Virginia Tech Category:Conductive polymers ",
