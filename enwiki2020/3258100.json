He started his career at Czech side FC Karvin\u00e1 and moved in summer 2000 to FC Ban\u00edk Ostrava for four years. In 2003, he won the Talent of the Year award at the Czech Footballer of the Year awards. He won the Czech championship with Ban\u00edk in the 2003\u201304 season. ===Shakhtar Donetsk=== The next step in his career was Ukrainian top club Shakhtar Donetsk. He played a couple of Champions League and UEFA Cup matches this time. ===Fulham=== He joined Fulham on 31 August 2006, just prior to the close of the transfer window. He made his Fulham league debut on 2 December 2006 in a 2\u20130 loss against Blackburn Rovers. On 1 January 2007, he came on as a second-half substitute for the injured Antti Niemi against Watford, where throughout the game the Fulham fans cheered his every kick or save, as they feared he would make a mistake and cost them the game. The game ended 0\u20130. He left Fulham in May 2007 to return to his parent club. ===VfL Bochum=== Ukrainian League regulations called for all tems to field at least four domestic players each match, and so Shakhtar loaned La\u0161t\u016fvka to German side VfL Bochum until the end of the 2007\u201308 season as a replacement for compatriot Jaroslav Drobn\u00fd, who left the club for Hertha BSC Berlin. La\u0161t\u016fvka started the season as first-choice keeper, but after some mistakes his position was threatened by the reserve keepers. After an injury, then third-choice keeper Ren\u00e9 Renno got his place. Renno started quite well but also made some mistakes before the winter break, so coach Marcel Koller claimed that all three keepers (La\u0161t\u016fvka, Renno and Philipp Heerwagen) started at zero in the preparations for the second season half. After the winter break La\u0161t\u016fvka was first-choice again and started with a very good match against Werder Bremen, which was rewarded with a nomination in the \"Team of the Day\" by Germany's leading football magazine kicker. At the end of the season Bochum were interested in signing him, but, due to the \u20ac4 million transfer fee, they decided to sign Portuguese keeper Daniel Fernandes from PAOK F.C. instead. ===West Ham United=== On 3 August 2008 La\u0161t\u016fvka signed for West Ham on a year- long loan deal. He made his debut for West Ham United in a Football League Cup third round tie away defeat at Watford on 23 September. On 26 May 2009, it was announced that La\u0161t\u016fvka was returning to Shakhtar Donetsk, having made only one appearance for West Ham. ===Dnipro=== On 4 August 2009, La\u0161t\u016fvka signed a three-year deal with Ukrainian team FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk for \u20ac3 million. In the summer of 2016, he left Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk.\u041b\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0443\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0448\u0438\u0432 \u0414\u043d\u0456\u043f\u0440\u043e\u041b\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0443\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0454 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0443 \u0437 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0447\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0449\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0438\u0432\u0456\u0437\u0456\u043e\u043d\u0443 \u0447\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0456\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0443 \u0427\u0435\u0445\u0456\u0457 ===Czech First League=== He rejoined the newly promoted MFK Karvin\u00e1 in the Czech First League as a free agent in 2016. After one year, he moved to SK Slavia Prague on a free transfer to replace Bundesliga-bound Ji\u0159\u00ed Pavlenka. After only half year later La\u0161t\u016fvka moved back to his former club Ban\u00edk Ostrava. ==International career== La\u0161t\u016fvka was called up to the Czech Republic national football team for the first time in May 2010. He made his full debut at Hampden Park against Scotland in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier on 3 September 2011. He was part of the Czech squad which reached the quarter-finals of the tournament before elimination by Portugal, but did not enter the field of play, with Petr \u010cech playing each match in goal. ==Honors== Ban\u00edk Ostrava * Czech First League : 2003\u201304 Shakhtar Donetsk *Ukrainian Championship (2): 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306 Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk *UEFA Europa League (1): runner-up 2014\u201315 ==References== ==External links== * Jan La\u0161t\u016fvka at FA\u010cR (in Czech) * * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:People from Hav\u00ed\u0159ov Category:Czech footballers Category:Czech Republic youth international footballers Category:Czech Republic under-21 international footballers Category:Czech Republic international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:MFK Karvin\u00e1 players Category:Czech First League players Category:FC Ban\u00edk Ostrava players Category:SK Slavia Prague players Category:Ukrainian Premier League players Category:FC Shakhtar Donetsk players Category:Premier League players Category:Fulham F.C. players Category:West Ham United F.C. players Category:Bundesliga players Category:VfL Bochum players Category:FC Dnipro players Category:Czech expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Ukraine Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:UEFA Euro 2012 players Category:Czech expatriate sportspeople in Ukraine Category:Czech expatriate sportspeople in Germany Category:Czech expatriate sportspeople in England ",
