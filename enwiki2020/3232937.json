    "text": "Galija (; trans. Galley) is a Serbian and former Yugoslav rock band from Ni\u0161. The central figures of the band are brothers Nenad Milosavljevi\u0107 (vocals, acoustic guitar and harmonica) and Predrag Milosavljevi\u0107 (vocals). Galija was formed in 1976, and its first several releases were progressive rock-oriented, but in the mid-1980s, the band moved towards more mainstream-oriented sound. In the late 1980s, the band started to cooperate with lyricist Radoman Kanjevac, releasing the album trilogy consisting of Daleko je Sunce (1988), Korak do slobode (1989) and Istorija, ti i ja, with which they achieved huge mainstream popularity. The band managed to sustain their popularity throughout the 1990s, but went on a hiatus at the end of the decade. Since the return to the scene in the mid-2000s, the band remains one of the top mainstream acts of the Serbian rock scene. ==Band history== ===1976 \u2013 1984: progressive rock years=== Galija frontman Nenad Milosavljevi\u0107 started performing as singer- songwriter while still in his teenage years. Influenced by Hippie movement, he performed his songs playing acoustic guitar and harmonica. He had his first public appearance 1975, on the Evening of Poetry and Music at the Ni\u0161 Film Festival, performing his own songs and songs by Jos\u00e9 Feliciano. In 1976, he performed at the Festival Omladina in Subotica and Belgrade Spring Festival. He composed music for the amateur theatre Tre\u0107a polovina (Third Half). On 11 April 1977 he held a concert in the National Theatre in Ni\u0161, on which he was accompanied by the members of the band Dva Lustera (Two Chandeliers). After the concert, Nenad Milosavljevi\u0107 and Dva Lustera members agreed to start working together as a band. The first lineup of Galija featured Nenad Milosavljevi\u0107 (guitar and vocals), Goran Ljubisavljevi\u0107 (guitar), Predrag Brankovi\u0107 (bass guitar), Nenad Tan\u010di\u0107 (drums) and Branislav Stamenkovi\u0107 (keyboards). The band was named Galija after the famous kafana in Ni\u0161. Tan\u010di\u0107 soon left the band due to his army obligations, and was replaced by Boban Pavlovi\u0107, who would, during the following years, remain one of the rare permanent members of the band. In 1978, with the new keyboard player, Zoran Stankovi\u0107, Galija won the first place at the Gitarijada Festival in Zaje\u010dar. At that time they used to appear on stage in 18th century uniforms. Several months after Gitarijada, they performed at the Festival Omladina in Subotica with Ljubodrag Vukadinovi\u0107 playing the keyboards. During 1978, they performed as the opening band on Smak tour, at the end of the year they performed at the BOOM Festival in Novi Sad. In 1979, the band released their debut album Prva plovidba (The First Sail) to mixed reviews by the critics. Nenad Milosvaljevi\u0107's brother Predrag Milosavljevi\u0107 appeared on the album on vocals as a guest musician, and also wrote most of the album lyrics. The album brought hits \"Avanturista\" (\"Adventurer\"), \"Gospi\" (\"To the Lady\") and \"Decimen\". After the band's performance at Bijelo Dugme's rock spectacle on JNA Stadium, on which they performed alongside Bijelo Dugme, Kako, Mama Rock, Formula 4, Aerodrom, Opus, Senad od Bosne, Boomerang, Prva Ljubav, Prljavo Kazali\u0161te, Toma\u017e Domicelj, Metak, Suncokret, Parni Valjak, Generacija 5, Siluete and other acts, Ljubisavljevi\u0107, Brankovi\u0107 and Vukadinovi\u0107 left the band. The bass guitarist Zoran Radosavljevi\u0107, the guitarist Du\u0161an Radivojevi\u0107 and the keyboardist Neboj\u0161a Markovi\u0107 became the band's new members. In 1980, the band released their second album, Druga plovidba (The Second Sail). The album was produced by Gordi guitarist Zlatko Manojlovi\u0107. The songs were composed by Nenad, and the lyrics were written by Predrag Milosavljevi\u0107. Druga plovidba was the first Galija album to feature Predrag Milosavljevi\u0107 as the official band member. During the same year, the band performed at the Split festival, playing at Poljud Stadium with Azra, Metak, Drago Mlinarec, Generacija 5, Senad od Bosne, Aerodrom, Dado Topi\u0107 and other acts. During this period, Galija achieved huge success with the audience in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and until the beginning of Yugoslav wars the band had the biggest fanbase in Bosnia. Boban Stamenkovi\u0107 left the band in 1980, and was replaced by Zoran Stamenkovi\u0107. During that summer, they performed in Makarska, and during the following years they would continue to hold regular concerts in the town. In 1981, the band performed, alongside Pomaran\u010da, Tunel, Radomir Mihajlovi\u0107 To\u010dak Trio, Piloti, Bulevar, Siluete and other acts, at the Belrade Rock Festival in Pionir Hall. In 1982, the album Ipak verujem u sebe (Nevertheless, I Believe in Myself) was released, bringing hits \"Jo\u0161 uvek sanjam\" (\"I'm Still Dreaming\") and \"Burna pijana no\u0107\" (\"Stormy Drunken Night\"). At the beginning of 1982, Boban Pavlovi\u0107 returned to the band. In 1983, Galija performed as the opening band at Joe Cocker's concert in Pionir Hall in Belgrade, and on 10 June 1983 they held a big concert at Belgrade's Ta\u0161majdan Stadium with Potop and Kerber as the opening bands. Potop leader, keyboardist Sa\u0161a Lokner, soon became a member of Galija. ===1984 \u2013 1988: shift to mainstream rock=== In October 1983, Galija recorded their fourth studio album Bez naglih skokova (Without Bounces). The album, released in 1984, was recorded in Manchester and was produced by Nightwing bass guitarist Gordon Rowley (who previously worked with another band from Ni\u0161, Kerber), and mixed in California. The material was offered to record label Jugoton, but the label refused the material, so the band once again signed with PGP-RTB. Unlike the band's previous releases, Bez naglih skokova did not bring any hits. After the album release, the band performed, together with Bajaga i Instruktori, Laboratorija Zvuka and Leb i Sol, on a fundraising concert in Sarajevo, dedicated to the victims of the 1983 Kopaonik earthquake. At the end of 1984, Galija were voted \"The Best Live Act on the Shore\" by Split youth. During the year, the band started to hold regular concerts in Music Club 81 in Ni\u0161, on which they performed covers of foreign rock hits. During the same year, Lokner joined Bajaga i Instruktori, and was replaced by Aleksandar Ralev. Jean- Jacques Roscam, a Belgian of Zaire origin, a former Pe\u0111a D'Boy Band member, soon joined Galija as the lead guitarist. In 1986, the band released album Digni ruku (Raise Your Hand), with the title track becoming a hit. The band wanted the album cover to feature a provocative image of the Hero of Socialist Labour Alija Sirotanovi\u0107 with a blindfold, which the record label refused. The album featured Roscam's song \"Winter's Coming\", with lyrics written by Dani Klein, the singer of the Belgian band Vaya Con Dios. ===1988 \u2013 1994: cooperation with Radoman Kanjevac and album trilogy=== Galija in the late 1980s In the late 1980s, the band was joined by the keyboard and flute player Bratislav \"Bata\" Zlatkovi\u0107, who graduated from Sarajevo Music Academy, and started to work with the lyricist Radoman Kanjevac, the two bringing new ideas. Kanjevac brought up an idea of releasing an album trilogy which would deal with problems of SFR Yugoslavia in transition, and Zlatkovi\u0107 introduced folk music influences into Galija's sound. The album Daleko je Sunce (Distant is the Sun), named after Dobrica \u0106osi\u0107's novel, featured numerous guest musicians: Kornelije Kova\u010d, Sa\u0161a Lokner, Nenad Stefanovi\u0107 \"Japanac\", Ivan Vdovi\u0107, Fejat Sejdi\u0107 Trumpet Orchestra and others. Songs were named after the works of writers Dobrica \u0106osi\u0107, Branko \u0106opi\u0107, Ivo Andri\u0107, Laza Lazarevi\u0107 and Aleksa \u0160anti\u0107. The album's biggest hits were the ballad \"Da li si spavala\" (\"Did You Sleep\") and the folk-oriented \"Mi znamo sudbu\" (\"We Know the Destiny\"). The other hits included \"Intimni odnosi\" (\"Intimate Relationship\"), \"Orlovi rano lete\" (\"Eagles Start Flying Early \") and \"Kao i obi\u010dno\" (\"Like Usual\"). The song \"Zebre i bizoni\" (\"Zebras and Buffalos\") was dealing with the enigma of Josip Broz Tito's residence at Brijuni. As the record label considered the song politically problematic, \"Zebre i bizoni\" lyrics were not printed on the inner sleeve. Due to lyrics perceived as politically provocative, the editors of Radio Belgrade and Radio Zagreb marked two songs from Daleko je sunce unsuitable for broadcasting, while the editors of Radio Sarajevo decided not to broadcast four songs from the album. After Daleko je Sunce was released, Zoran Radosavljevi\u0107 left the band, and was replaced by Predrag Milanovi\u0107. The second part of the trilogy, Korak do slobode (One Step to Freedom) was released in 1989. The album was produced by Sa\u0161a Habi\u0107. While Daleko je sunce lyrics were written by both Kanjevac and Predrag Milosavljevi\u0107, the lyrics for Korak do slobode were written by Kanjevac only. The song \"Sloboda\" (\"Freedom\") featured Kerber frontman Goran \u0160epa on vocals. The album hits included \"Na tvojim usnama\" (\"On Your Lips\"), \"Kopaonik\", \"Korak do slobode\" and \"Kad me pogleda\u0161\" (\"When You Look at Me\"). Roscam's reggae song \"Ljubavna pesma\" (\"Love Song\") had ironic lyrics dealing with the growing nationalism in Yugoslavia. During the same year, Nenad Milosavljevi\u0107 won the Composer of the Year Award at MESAM festival, although Zlatkovi\u0107 was the band's main author. The new bass guitarist Du\u0161an Karad\u017ei\u0107 soon joined Galija. The band promoted the album with a concert in Du\u0161anova Street in Ni\u0161 in front of some 20,000 people. At the beginning of 1990, Galija, alongside Riblja \u010corba, Valentino, Viktorija and Bajaga i Instruktori, performed in Timi\u0219oara, Romania, at the three-day concerts organized two months after the Romanian Revolution. All five acts performed on three concerts in Timi\u0219oara Olympia Hall in front of some 20,000 people each night. During the same year, the compilation album Jo\u0161 uvek sanjam (Najve\u0107i hitovi) (I'm Still Dreaming (Greatest Hits)) was released, with some of the old songs re-recorded. At the time of the first multi-party elections in Yugoslavia, Galija, after the idea of Kanjevac and journalist Petar \"Peca\" Popovi\u0107, recorded an EP with songs \"On je isti kao on\" (\"He Is just Like Him\", which compared Josip Broz Tito and Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107), \"Ti si moja jedina partija\" (\"You Are My Only Party\"), \"Posle svega\" (\"After Everything\") and \"Komunista\" (\"Communist\", which featured Romani musician \u0160aban Bajramovi\u0107 on vocals). The EP featured provocative lyrics dealing with the uncertain future of the country, and was, because of the political censorship, never released. With the album Istorija, ti i ja (History, You and Me), released in 1991, the trilogy was complete. The album was produced by Valentino member Nik\u0161a Brato\u0161 and featured Sa\u0161a Lokner, Slavi\u0161a Pavlovi\u0107, flutist Bora Dugi\u0107 and the group Renesans as guests. Istorija, ti i ja featured some of the band's biggest hits: \"Skadarska\" (\"Skadarska Street\"), \"Trube\" (\"Trumpets\"), \"Da me nisi\" (\"If You Haven't\"), \"Trava\" (\"Grass\") and \"Seti se maja\" (\"Remember May\"). Soon after the album release, Roscam left Yugoslavia because of the growing tensions in the country. and Dragutin Jakovljevi\u0107 replaced him in Galija. In June, Galija was the opening band on Bob Dylan's concert in Zemun. The band, in the new lineup, released the compilation album Ni rat ni mir (Odlomci iz trilogije) (Neither War nor Peace (Passages from the Trilogy)), which consisted of songs from the trilogy, and two new songs \"Pravo slavlje\" (\"Real Celebration\", also a word play, as \"Pravoslavlje\" means \"Orthodoxy\") and \"Na Drini \u0107uprija\" (\"The Bridge on the Drina\"). The 7\" single with these two songs was given as a present to the members of the audience on their concert in Sava Centar, which featured Fejat Sejdi\u0107 Trumpet Orchestra, St. George Choir and pianist Milo\u0161 Petrovi\u0107 as guests. A year later, they held another concert in Sava Centar, as a part of celebration of the publishing house Srpska knji\u017eevna zadruga hundred years of existence. For this occasion, they recorded another gift-single, entitled Jednom u sto godina (Once in a Hundred Years), with a cover of Film song \"Mi nismo sami\" (\"We Are Not Alone\") and a cover of Indexi song \"Sanjam\" (\"I'm Dreaming\"), the latter cover featuring a recording of Ivo Andri\u0107's voice. At the beginning of 1993, Zlatkovi\u0107 left the band. Oliver Jezdi\u0107 became the new keyboard player, and Bratislav Milo\u0161evi\u0107 became the new bass guitarist. The double album, Karavan (Caravan), was recorded in Cyprus and produced by Sa\u0161a Habi\u0107. Part of the album lyrics were written by Kanjevac, and part by Predrag Milosavljevi\u0107. The album featured Generacija 5 guitarist Dragan Jovanovi\u0107 on acoutic guitar as guest. The album featured a cover of traditional song \"Petlovi\" (\"Roosters\"). With Karavan Kanjevac ended his cooperation with the band. ===1994 \u2013 2000: after Kanjevac, without Predrag Milosavljevi\u0107 and hiatus=== During the summer of 1994, Karavan was promoted with a large number of free concerts, one of them being a concert in the park outside Belgrade's Old Palace. At the time, Galija started to promote the Socialist Party of Serbia, which has provoked a part of the critics and fans, who have proclaimed Galija a \"state's band\". In 1996, the album Trinaest (Thirteen) was released. Alongside Predrag Milosavljevi\u0107's lyrics, Trinaest songs featured lyrics from Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107, Stevan Rai\u010dkovi\u0107 and Petar Paji\u0107's poems. During the next year, the band released the compilation album Ve\u010dita plovidba (Eternal Sail), and the studio album Voleti voleti (To Love to Love), which featured the hit \"Kotor\".
