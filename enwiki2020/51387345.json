    "text": "Fondi '91 is a 2013 feature film set in Fondi, Italy, directed by Dev Khanna and starring Raymond Ablack. It received mixed reviews from critics upon release. == Plot == Fondi '91 follows the lustful adventures of Anil and his Jersey-based high school soccer team's two week trip to the town of Fondi, Italy. == Reception == The National Post called the film \"A nice-looking coming-of-age film that doesn't quite get there.\" NOW Magazine wrote a negative review: \"A certain sensitivity and intelligence are required to deal with rape on film. Fondi '91 exhibits little of either, which is why it ends up being shocking, exploitative and profoundly infuriating.\" In a mixed review, Toronto Film Scene wrote: \"What starts out as a coming of age story from the point of view of four high school boys, each with their own varying levels of testosterone fueled sexual desire, quickly breaks down into a confused story of sexual assault, misguided guilt, and incredibly awkward and unbelievable sexual encounters. It\u2019s a bit of a shame as well, since the first thirty minutes of Fondi \u201991 is actually a lot of fun.\" == References == == External links == * Category:2013 films Category:Films set in Italy Category:Canadian films Category:2010s coming-of-age drama films Category:Canadian sports drama films Category:Canadian coming-of-age drama films Category:2010s sports drama films ",
