    "text": "Michael Nikolai Skr\u00e5mo, (born 2 November 1985, presumed dead in March 2019) was a Swedish-Norwegian terrorist and member of the Islamic State (ISIS). He was a recruiter of IS-terrorists from the Nordic region. His mother revealed to SVT that she had received information that her son had died in early March 2019, during the final battles in the Syrian city of Al-Baghuz Fawqani. ==Biography== Michael Skr\u00e5mo grew up in Gothenburg and also had Norwegian citizenship, training to become a chef. He converted to the Islam faith after becoming interested in religions during his studying years. In 2015, he travelled to Egypt where he studied the Arabic language and Islam, and after that he travelled throughout Sweden and Europe preaching salafism and announced his support for Islamic terrorist attacks. While in Egypt he called himself Abdul Samad and became known under that name in the salafist movement's social media posts. He told close relatives in Sweden that he planned to travel to Syria, but only told them that he would be working as a chef in an Islamic State controlled hospital. He travelled from Gothenburg to Raqqa, Syria in 2014 along with his wife who also had converted to Islam, and he became a recruiter of members of the terrorist group by posting photos and videos of himself on social media wearing military clothes, using Facebook under the names of Abou Ibrahim al-Swaidi and Abdulsamad al-Swaidi. Al-Swaidi is arabic for \"the swede\" and his recruitment targeted mostly Sweden and the other Nordic countries. In videos on social media he called for terror cells in Europe to proceed to engage in terrorist attacks in Europe. His wife was killed in a grenade attack in Baghouz in north western Syria in December 2018. In March 2019, during the final battle against ISIS in Baghouz it was reported by media that Skr\u00e5mo had been arrested by Kurdish forces, but his name was missing from the official lists of captured IS terrorists; later on his mother in Sweden announced that she had received information about his death. Norwegian security police opened an investigation into terrorism crimes committed by Michael Skr\u00e5mo and he is wanted internationally by Interpol. On 18 April, Swedish authorities announced that Skr\u00e5mos' seven children would be able to leave the al-Hol refugee camp in Syria to be transported to the Swedish consulate in Erbil, Iraq. The children which Skr\u00e5mo fathered with his now deceased wife were transported to Erbil in early May, and on the 14 May they returned to Sweden where they were placed in child protective custody. ==References== Category:People from Gothenburg Category:Possibly living people Category:1985 births ",
