    "text": "Nayagarh district is one of the 30 districts of Odisha state in eastern India. It was created in 1992 when the erstwhile Puri District was split into three distinct districts, namely Khurdha, Nayagarh and Puri. It is home to the Baisipali Wildlife Sanctuary. It is like a Hill station, so far as natural scenery is concerned. Chhena Poda is the favourite sweet for which Nayagarh is famous in Odisha. The name Odisha originated from Odra or Udra tribes that inhabited the central coastal belt (Khordha District and Nayagarh District) of modern Odisha. In ancient times the vast area from the river Ganges in the north to that of the Godavari in the south and from the Bay of Bengal in the east to the Amarkantaka hill in the west, was occupied by four important tribes and it is after them that the political units were named as Kalinga, Kosala, Odra and Utkala. Of these four Kalinga in ancient times exercised her control over rest of the three units, but later on it was confined to the region between the Mahanadi and the Godavari rivers. Kosala on the western sector, comprised the territories, now in Raipur, Bilaspur districts of Chhattisgarh and Sambalpur, Sundargarh, Bolangir and Kalahandi districts of modern Orissa. Rest of Orissa to the north of the river Mahanadi up to the Ganges in ancient times, was known as Utkala and Odra. ==History== Nayagarh princely state was created around the 13th century and is considered as an important part in the history of Odisha. King Suryamani of Baghela dynasty came to Puri and established his kingdom at Nayagarh. Present Nayagarh District consists of the four Garjat states (small provincial states ruled by the local kings) of ex-states Ranpur, Nayagarh, Khandapara and Daspalla. The aboriginal Savaras and Khonds are the indigenous people of Nayagarh District. The Indo-Aryans came later. Nayagarh District with its ex-states of Nayagarh, Khandapara, Daspalla and Ranpur played a major role in the freedom struggle of India. The birth history of Nayagarh in the 13th century is an important chapter in the political history of Odisha. Suryamani of Baghela dynasty came to Puri on a pilgrimage from Rewa State in Madhya Pradesh and established his kingdom at Nayagarh. On the way to Puri, both Suryamani and his brother Chandramani took rest at night at Gunanati. The area was full of tigers and at night a tiger attacked him. Both the brothers fought the tiger and killed it. The local people praised the brave brothers and elected Suryamani as their leader. Suryamani gradually built his fort at Gunanati and married a Mali girl. After the death of his first wife, he again married a Kshatriya girl. From there, he then attacked Haripur and Ralaba. Ralaba was a very beautiful place. While sleeping a tiger attacked him at Ralaba; he again fought and killed it. At that moment, he saw a lady with an empty pot passed by to fetch water. Astonishingly, she returned with a little boy. Immediately, Suryamani obstructed the way of that lady and wanted to know about the mystery. The lady told she was Bouri Thakurani (a local worshiped goddess) and the tiger that the king killed was the boy. She advised Suryamani to kill her and worship her as his deity. From that date Suryamani worshiped Bauri Thakurani at Ralaba and built his fort there and adopted Tiger Head as a state symbol. Ninth king of this dynasty Bagel Singh (1480\u20131510) came on a hunting to a place in between Rukshi and Balaram mountains and saw a wonderful sight that a rabbit pressed down a dog there. After seeing this extraordinary event, he selected and shifted his capital to this place. As per his name, this place was known as Baghua Nayagarh. The place where such an event occurred is now known as \"Kukur Tasara\". 12th King of Nayagarh Raghunath Sing (1565\u20131595) was highly powerful. During this time Muslims had already captured Odisha and the atmosphere of the coastal Odisha was fully indiscipline. Last independent king Mukunda Dev (1565) was defeated in Gohritikira and died. By taking the advantages of the political situations of coastal Odisha, Raghunath Singh attacked Ranapur and captured Odagaon, Sarankul and Baunsiapara area from Ranapur estate and dispossessed Nayagarh-Daspalla border area from the King of Boudh and Sunamuhin area of Odgaon from the King of Ghumusar. He also captured a portion from Banpur. Before death, Ragunath Singh divided his estate between his three sons. Harihar Singh was in possession of Nayagarh and Jadunath Singh got four Khandagrams (large area of land) which was later known as Khandapada. Gadadhar Singh was the son of Harihar Singh. When he was engaged in a fight with Ranpur estate, the king of Ghumusar attacked Nayagarh. Pindik Patsahani of village Sunalati with 150 soldiers fought the great army of Ghumusar and defeated him. But, in subsequent war he was captured by the enemy and sacrificed his life. Gadadhar Sing's daughter married the great poet Upendra Bhanja of Ghumusar who settled at Malisahi of Nayagarh estate after marriage. When British captured Odisha, Binayak Singh Mandhata was the King of Nayagarh and the great Jadumani (Utkal Ghanta) was his poet. There were several Princely States in Nayagarh District. Nayagarh District was created in the year 1995. Prior to 1995 it was a subdivision of Puri district.Princely States of Nayagarh DistrictPrincely States Daspalla State was founded in the 15th century. === Rulers === Dasapalla State. Legend says that a demon named Gosinha was ruling this land during the epic period.Whose fort was located inside the Baisipalli Sanctuary, which was known as Goshinhagada during the epic period. Available records, writings, books reveal that at first there was no such place known as Daspalla. Rather it was a part of Boudh State ruled by Bhanj Kings. During the rule of Bira Bhanj there was a rift in between Bira Bhanj and his cousin, Sal Bhanj. The dissident Sal Banj left Boudh and proceeded to meet the Gajapati of Puri through the ages old Jagannath Sadak. While resting with his followers at Padmlatola Forest, the king of Nayagarh got the news and made alliance with Sal Bhanj and declared him the king of that area. Getting the news, Bir Bhanj of Boudh got angry and sent a troop to capture Sal Bhanj. But the troop of Boudh got defeated at the hands of Sal Bhanj and Nayagarh soldiers. As Sal Bhanj got Yasha (Fame), he named his kingdom as Yashpalla or Daspalla. Other historians tell that king Sal Bhanj had only das (oriya for 10) Pallies (villages) so Daspalli got renamed as Daspalla. This incident took place in 1495. King Sal Bhanj ruled for 3 years only and then his son Naran Bhanj ascended the throne. But records found at Boudh state reveal that Daspalla was formed by Naran Bhanj in 1498 during the reign of Siddya Bhanj. However, it is a fact that Daspalla was formed during the last part of 15th century being separated from Baudh. The headquarters of Daspalla changed from Badmul to Gania, Gania to Madhyakhand, Madhyakhand to Puruna Daspalla. The ninth king of Daspalla Padmanav Bhanj, during hunting, saw a wonderful thing that a wild dove was hunting and defeating a Chhanchan (Bird of prey). So, he thought the place a heroic one and decided to change his capital to that place. At that time there was a Kandha chieftain named Kunj Malik. King Padmanav Bhanj defeated Kunj Malik and started his capital here but after the name of Kunja Malik the capital got named as Kunjabanagarh.
