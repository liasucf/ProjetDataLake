    "text": "Alphonse Royer, (10 September 1803 \u2013 11 April 1875) was a French author, dramatist and theatre manager, most remembered today for having written (with his regular collaborator, Gustave Va\u00ebz) the librettos for Gaetano Donizetti's opera La favorite and Giuseppe Verdi's J\u00e9rusalem. From 1853 to 1856, he was the director of the Od\u00e9on Theatre and from 1856 to 1862 director of the Paris Op\u00e9ra, after which he was appointed France's Inspecteur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Beaux-Arts (Inspector General for the Fine Arts). In his later years, he wrote a six volume history of the theatre and a history of the Paris Op\u00e9ra. He also translated the theatrical works of the Italian dramatist Carlo Gozzi, as well those of the Spanish writers, Miguel de Cervantes, Tirso de Molina, and Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n. A Chevalier and later Officier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, Royer died in Paris, the city of his birth, at the age of 71. ==Biography== ===Early years and first success=== Alphonse Royer was born in Paris to a prosperous family with various commercial interests. His father was a commissaire-priseur (auctioneer) and lawyer. As a young man, Royer belonged to a literary circle inspired by Romanticism and Liberalism, movements for which he maintained a sympathy throughout his life.Vapereau (1880) p. 1588La Presse (13 April 1875) p. 2 He initially trained to be a lawyer, but was more interested in poetry and the theatre and longed to travel.Va\u00ebz (1840) His father sent him abroad where for several years he travelled in Italy and the Middle East, and carried out several minor diplomatic and business missions. Royer was in Constantinople during the 1826 revolt of the Janissaries against Mahmud II and later wrote an account of it in his 1844 novel, Les janissaires. His experiences during those years also served as the inspirations for several other works, including his novels Venezia la bella (1834) and Robert Macaire en Orient (1840) and a collection of novellas, Un Divan (1834). On his return to Paris, Royer made his literary debut with a novel set in the Middle Ages, Les Mauvais Gar\u00e7ons, which he co-authored with Henri Auguste Barbier. It was published in 1830, the same year as his first venture into drama, Henry V et ses compagnons, co-authored with Auguste Romieu. The play premiered to great success at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Nouveaut\u00e9s on 27 February 1830 with incidental music by Giacomo Meyerbeer, Carl Maria von Weber, and Louis Spohr. ===Librettist and playwright=== Gustave Va\u00ebz In the ensuing years, Royer wrote several more novels and plays, contributed articles to a variety of Parisian periodicals, and formed a close friendship and working partnership with the Belgian playwright and poet, Gustave Va\u00ebz. Their first major collaboration was the translation and adaptation of Donizetti's opera, Lucia di Lammermoor for the French stage. The successful premiere of Lucie de Lammermoor, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance in 1839 led to several similar commissions, as well as commissions for original librettos, most notably Donizetti's La favorite (1840), and Verdi's J\u00e9rusalem (1847). During the period of the July Monarchy, Royer and Va\u00ebz became a major force in the adaptation of Italian operas for French audiences and had a virtual monopoly of the Italian repertoire at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique. They always worked closely with the composers and were praised for the way their writing respected the movement and rhythm of the music. In the case of translated librettos, this was made all the more difficult by having to adapt their poetry to a pre-existing score intended to be sung in another language.Everist (2009) pp. 31 and 35 An anonymous critic in L'Illustration wrote of their translation for Rossini's Otello: > By virtue of work and skill, MM. Royer and Va\u00ebz have forced our language, so > cold and so unmalleable, so constrained by consonants, so loaded with > epithets, to enter without too many cuts and bruises into this narrow and > flexible mode of Italian poetry.Quoted in Everist (2009) p. 35 Although their collaboration on the Italian operatic repertoire ended in 1847 with J\u00e9rusalem, they later wrote the original libretto for Fran\u00e7ois-Auguste Gevaert's 1853 op\u00e9ra comique, Georgette ou Le moulin de Fontenoy. In addition to their work on opera librettos, Royer and Va\u00ebz co-wrote many plays, ranging from serious drama to com\u00e9die en vaudeville, several of which premiered at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on. During this period, Royer had also achieved a minor reputation as an orientalist, partly though his novels and travel writing which were widely read at the time, but also through his biography of Mahmud II and his articles on Mahmud's legislative reforms for the legal journal, Gazette des tribunaux. He held salons at his apartment in the Rue de Navarin, attended by literary figures, artists, composers and journalists, all of whom were close friends. According to Xavier Eyma,Louis Xavier Eyma (1816-1876) was French author and diplomat born in Martinique. who attended the salons at that time, they resembled a \"miniature divan in Constantinople\", with Turkish tobacco smoked on traditional Turkish pipes and Turkish coffee consumed in tiny cups.Eyma (1866) p. 220 Amongst Royer's circle of friends at this time, in addition to Barbier and Va\u00ebz, were Alphonse Karr, Camille Rogier (who travelled with Royer to Constantinople in 1840),Camille Rogier (1810-1896) was French artist, most known for his depictions of life in Turkey, but also for his illustrations of E. T. A. Hoffmann's stories. See Schreier (2006) especially pp. 75-77. Joseph M\u00e9ry, Balzac, G\u00e9rard de Nerval, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier and Heinrich Heine. Heine, Gautier and Royer had a particularly close friendship. At several points they all lived near each other on the Rue de Navarin, at times sharing the same lodging. Royer and Gautier and their mistresses were also frequent visitors to Heine's summer house in Montmorency. In 1841, Gautier and Royer were Heine's seconds in his duel with Salomon Strauss which had involved them in lengthy negotiations with Strauss over the time, place and weapons.Claveau (1867) p. 749. Strauss had challenged Heine to a duel after he had published scandalous accusations of a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois involving Strauss, Strauss' wife, Jeanette Wohl, and the poet Ludwig B\u00f6rne. Strauss had wanted a duel with swords, while Heine wanted pistols. In the end, pistols were chosen, and the duel took place on 7 September 1841 in the Forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Heine shot into the air. Strauss's shot gave Heine a slight wound on the hip. For an account in English of the duel and the events surrounding it, see Holub (1989) pp. 145-156. Several of Royer and Gautier's letters to Strauss' representatives concerning arrangements for the duel are published in Gautier (1985) They were also the witnesses at Heine's marriage to his long-time mistress, Mathilde, which took place a week before the duel.Fejt\u0151 (1946) p. 205 ===Theatre manager=== Nadar ca. 1857) Royer had been spoken of as a possible successor to Vedel,Vedel was the stage name of Alexandre-Furcy Poulet (1783-1873) the director of Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais, who resigned his post in 1840. In suggesting him for the directorship, La Presse wrote: > ... M. Alphonse Royer, a man of taste, tact and charming demeanor. The > government would find in him an experienced and skilful supporter and an > enlightened defender of our great literary traditions.La Presse (2 January > 1840) p. 2. Original French: \"M. Alphonse Royer, homme de go\u00fbt, de tact, et > de rotations charmantes. Le gouvernement trouverait en lui un partisan > \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des jet\u00e9es d'ordre, et l'art un d\u00e9fenseur \u00e9clair\u00e9 de nos grandes > traditions litt\u00e9raires.\" In the end, Vedel was succeeded by Fran\u00e7ois Buloz. However, in 1853 Royer was appointed director of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on, where several of his plays had premiered in the 1840s. Va\u00ebz joined him at the Od\u00e9on as a stage and artistic director and then went with him to the Paris Op\u00e9ra in 1856 when Royer became the director there. During Royer's tenure, the Op\u00e9ra produced the world premieres of operas by Giuseppe Verdi (Le trouv\u00e8re, the French version of Il trovatore), Fromental Hal\u00e9vy (La Magicienne), F\u00e9licien David (Herculanum), Prince Poniatowski (Pierre de M\u00e9dicis), and Charles Gounod (La reine de Saba) as well as ballets by Ernest Reyer (Sacountal\u00e2), Daniel Auber (Marco Spada), and Jacques Offenbach (Le papillon). Managing an opera house in Paris during the Second French Empire often meant managing the audience as well. On one notable occasion, Royer did not succeed. Napoleon III had ordered a performance of Wagner's Tannh\u00e4user at the Op\u00e9ra which was to be its French premiere. Royer told the composer that for the opera to have any success with Parisian audiences, it required the customary ballet, specifically at the beginning of the second act. Royer explained that the influential members of the Jockey-Club de Paris (all of whom held season tickets) were primarily interested in watching their favourites in the corps de ballet. They usually dined during the first act of operas, only entered their boxes when the second act began to watch the ballet, and departed immediately afterwards. Wagner adamantly refused to add a ballet to the second act, but compromised by adding one to the first act.Norton (2004) pp. 241-242 The result was the famous fiasco of the \"Paris Tannh\u00e4user\". On its opening night in 1861, the Jockey Club members duly arrived at the beginning of Act 2 and caused an uproar of shouts, whistles and laughter. Wagner recalled that when the whistling began, Royer turned to him in complete resignation and said, \"Ce sont les Jockeys; nous sommes perdus.\" (\"It's the Jockeys; we're lost.\")Wagner (1911) p. 765 The two successive performances were even more seriously disrupted. Wagner never permitted another production in Paris. In his autobiography, Wagner described Royer in one of their early encounters: > On one of these occasions Bulow accompanied me, and we were both struck by a > ridiculous habit peculiar to this singular old man, whom BelloniGaetano > Belloni (1810-1887) was Franz Liszt's secretary and agent. said he had known > in his youth as a box-office clerk at the Scala Theatre in Milan. He > suffered from involuntary spasmodic movements of the hands, the result of > certain not very creditable physical infirmities, and probably to conceal > these he continually toyed with a small stick, which he tossed to and fro > with seeming affectation.Wagner (1911) p. 735 ===Later years=== P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery with Paris in the distance Royer remained director of the Paris Op\u00e9ra until Va\u00ebz's death in 1862, after which he left to become France's Inspecteur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Beaux-Arts (Inspector General for the Fine Arts). In his later years, he devoted himself to writing a six volume history of the theatre (the last two volumes of which were published posthumously) and a history of the Paris Op\u00e9ra. He also translated the collected theatrical works of the Italian dramatist Carlo Gozzi, as well those of the Spanish writers, Miguel de Cervantes, Tirso de Molina, and Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n. Royer's 1865 Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Alarc\u00f3n was the first time any of Alarc\u00f3n's plays had been published in French translation.See Douhair (1865) p. 224 and Royer (1865) p. 1 He had been made a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1844, and in 1867 was promoted to Officier. Alphonse Royer died of pneumonia in Paris on 11 April 1875 at the age of 71. His funeral took place at the \u00c9glise de la Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, followed by burial in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery. Jean-Baptiste Faure sang the Pie Jesu during the Requiem Mass,Faure had composed the Pie Jesu himself, originally for the funeral of his teacher, the tenor Louis Antoine Ponchard (1787-1866). and there were spoken tributes by Olivier Halanzier, director of the Paris Op\u00e9ra, Ferdinand Dugne of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des auteurs dramatiques, and Emmanuel Gonzal\u00e8s of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des gens de lettres. Halanzier's address at the graveside emphasized Royer's personal modesty and kindness and his contribution to opera and to the Paris Op\u00e9ra in particular, concluding with: > This is why his memory will live on with us. This is why his memory will be > always dear to the Op\u00e9ra. Finally, gentlemen, why all of you share my words, > my regrets, my tears!Le M\u00e9nestrel (18 April 1875) pp. 155-156. Original > quote in French: \"Voil\u00e0 pourquoi sa m\u00e9moire vivra parmi nous, voil\u00e0 pourquoi > son souvenir sera toujours cher \u00e0 l'Op\u00e9ra, pourquoi enfin, Messieurs, vous > tous qui m'entourez, vous vous associez \u00e0 mes paroles, \u00e0 mes regrets, \u00e0 mes > larmes!\" Little has been written about Royer's personal life, although Fritz H. Eisner in his analysis of four letters by Heinrich Heine, describes one of them (circa 1843) as \"written to Dolores Royer, the wife of Heine's friend Alphonse Royer\".Eisner (1961) p. 281 Royer's death was announced by his executor, Charles Narrey,Charles Narrey (1825-1895) was a French author and playwright of Irish descent who had collaborated with Royer and Va\u00ebz on several comedies and vaudeville pieces. and his nephew, Edmond Turquet,Edmond Turquet, (1836\u20131914) was the Deputy for Aisne, and later France's Under-Secretary of State for Public Instruction and the Fine Arts. who led the mourners at his funeral.For Halanzier's complete tribute, see Le M\u00e9nestrel (18 April 1875) pp. 155-156. The details of Royer's death and funeral are from La Presse (13 April 1875) p. 2; La Presse (15 April 1875) p. 3; Le M\u00e9nestrel (18 April 1875) pp. 155-156; and Duval (1876) p. 143, ==Principal works== Rosine Stoltz and Gilbert Duprez in the premiere of La favorite, Paris 1840 In addition to the works listed here, Royer was a regular contributor of articles, literary and music criticism, and serialized fiction (romans feuilleton) to several French periodicals, including L'Europe litt\u00e9raire, Revue de Paris, Le Figaro, Le M\u00e9nestrel, Revue des Deux Mondes, and L'Artiste. ===Opera librettos=== The date and theatre given for a translated libretto is the date of the first performance using that translation.Premiere venue and date information in this section is from Casaglia (2005) *Lucie de Lammermoor (Donizetti) \u2013 French translation and adaptation (with Gustave Va\u00ebz), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance, Paris 1839 *La favorite (Donizetti) \u2013 Original libretto (with Gustave Va\u00ebz and Eug\u00e8ne Scribe), Paris Op\u00e9ra (Salle Le Peletier), 1840 *Don Pasquale (Donizetti) \u2013 French translation (with Gustave Va\u00ebz), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royal de la Monnaie, Brussels 1843 *Otello (Rossini) \u2013 French translation (with Gustave Va\u00ebz), Paris Op\u00e9ra (Salle Le Peletier), 1844 *Robert Bruce (Rossini and Niedermeyer, pastiche opera) \u2013 Original libretto (with Gustave Va\u00ebz), Paris Op\u00e9ra (Salle Le Peletier), 1846 *Les premiers pas (Adam, Auber, Carafa, and Hal\u00e9vy) \u2013 Original libretto (with Gustave Va\u00ebz), Op\u00e9ra-National (Cirque Olympique), Paris 1847 *J\u00e9rusalem (Verdi) \u2013 Original libretto (with Gustave Va\u00ebz), Paris Op\u00e9ra (Salle Le Peletier), 1847 *Georgette ou Le moulin de Fontenoy (Gevaert) \u2013 Original libretto (with Gustave Va\u00ebz), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique, Paris 1853 *Alessandro Stradella (Flotow) \u2013 French translation (with Gustave Oppelt), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royal de la Monnaie, Brussels 1859 ===Plays=== Charles Volnys as Henry in Royer's first play, Henry V et ses compagnons *Henry V et ses compagnons (with Auguste Romieu), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Nouveaut\u00e9s, Paris 1830Premiere venue and date information in this section is from Everist (2009) pp. 42-45 and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on *Le Voyage \u00e0 Pontoise (with Gustave Va\u00ebz), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on, Paris 1842 *Le Bourgeois grand seigneur (with Gustave Va\u00ebz), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on, Paris 1842 *Mademoiselle Rose (with Gustave Va\u00ebz), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on, Paris 1843 *La Comtesse d'Altenberg (with Gustave Va\u00ebz), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on, Paris 1843 *La Dame de tr\u00e8fle (with Gustave Va\u00ebz and Charles Narrey) Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vaudeville, Paris 1850 *Les Fantaisies de Milord, (with Gustave Va\u00ebz and Charles Narrey), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s, Paris 1850 *Le Jour et la nuit, (with Gustave Va\u00ebz), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s, Paris 1850 *Un ami malheureux, (with Gustave Va\u00ebz) Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vaudeville, Paris 1850 *Chodruc- Duclos, ou l'Homme \u00e0 la longue barbe, (with Gustave Va\u00ebz and Michel Delaporte), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9, Paris 1850 *D\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 d'hier, (with Gustave Va\u00ebz and Charles Narrey), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s, Paris 1852 *Grandeur et d\u00e9cadence de M.
