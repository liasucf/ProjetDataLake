He became 6th Tokugawa daimy\u014d of Owari Domain on the unexpected death of his brother Tokugawa Yoshimichi, and Yoshimichi's son Tokugawa Gor\u014dta in 1713. He was severely reprimanded by the domain's senior retainer, Takenokoshi Masatake, for having thrown a celebratory party immediately on his succession, ignoring the customary mourning period. Tsugutomo was awarded lower 4th Court Rank and the ceremonial position of Captain of the Left Guards on January 11, 1713, and was promoted to 3rd Court Rank and was given a kanji from the name of Sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ietsugu. He advanced to the ceremonial post of Ch\u016bnagon on December 26, 1715. Whereas his predecessor, Yoshimichi, had enjoyed the high regard of the 6th sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ienobu, Tsugutomo was viewed with suspicion by senior shogunal retainers Manabe Akifusa and Arai Hakuseki, as Tsugutomo had the closest claim by direct descent to the position of sh\u014dgun, and the 7th sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Ietsugu had no heirs. Tsugutomo's position was also bolstered by the fact that his official wife was the daughter of the kampaku Konoe Iehiro, with ties to the powerful faction led by Tenei-in within the \u014coku of Edo Castle. Despite his blood ties and political connections, Tsugutomo was bypassed by the shogunal succession, and Tokugawa Yoshimune from Kii Domain was selected to become 8th sh\u014dgun instead. Tsugutomo was noted for his fiscal acuity from an early age, and reformed the finances of Owari Domain. He also supported Yoshimune's Ky\u014dh\u014d Reforms, which left the domain with a very considerable fiscal surplus. The castle town of Nagoya prospered under his administration, increasing in population, and attracting merchants such as Echigoya from Edo. Tsugutomo died on January 5, 1731, without an heir (his only son, by a concubine, having died in infancy). The leadership of the domain passed to his younger half-brother, the 19th son of Tokugawa Tsunanari, Tokugawa Muneharu. Tsugutomo's grave is at the Owari Tokugawa clan temple of Kench\u016b-ji in Nagoya. ==Family== * Father: Tokugawa Tsunanari * Mother: Izumi later Senkoin * Wife: Konoe Yasuko * Concubine: Ukyo no Kata * Son: Hachisaburo by Ukyo == References == * Nakai, Kate Widman.
