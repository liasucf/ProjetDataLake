The Shengold Jewish Encyclopedia. Rockville, Md: Schreiber Pub, 2003. pp. 109, 212 It was founded and edited by Jehuda L\u00f6b Kantor.Waxman, Meyer. A History of Jewish Literature: From the Close of the Bible to Our Own Days. [5-6], From Eighteen-Eighty to Nineteen-Thirty Five. [Whitefish (Mont.)]: Kessinger Publishing, 1941. pp. 46, 435-436The Renascence of Hebrew Literature (1743-1885), p. 167 Ha-Yom was the first daily Hebrew newspaper. When it was launched Ha-Yom had a daily circulation of around 2,400. By 1887 the number of subscribers had fallen to around 1,600.Kouts, Gideon. The first Hebrew newspapers in Europe. Economic and Organizational Aspects Ha-Yom was characterized by a modern, Europeanized form of journalism, previously unknown in the Hebrew-language press. It was the first Hebrew-language newspaper to rely on telegraphic news agency material for its coverage. Moreover, Kantor contracted correspondents in Jewish centres in Western Europe and the United States.Waxman, Meyer. A History of Jewish Literature: From the Close of the Bible to Our Own Days. [5-6], From Eighteen-Eighty to Nineteen-Thirty Five. [Whitefish (Mont.)]: Kessinger Publishing, 1941. pp. 441-442 Prominent contributors to Ha-Yom included D. Frischman, A. Rosenfeld and L. Katzenelson. The launching and initial success of Ha-Yom provoked the existing Hebrew- language publications Ha-Meliz and Ha-Tsefirah to convert themselves into daily newspapers. Competition with Aleksander Zederbaum's Ha-Meliz became fierce. Prior to the founding of Ha-Yom, Ha-Meliz had monopolized the Jewish press in the Russia.Orbach, Alexander. New Voices of Russian Jewry: A Study of the Russian-Jewish Press of Odessa in the Era of the Great Reforms. Studies in Judaism in Modern Times, V. 4. Leiden: E.J.Brill, 1980. p. 65 The fact that Ha-Yom subscribed to the \"Northern Company\" telegraphic news agency forced Ha- Meliz to do the same. The subscription costs (3,000 rubles per year) became a heavy economic burden for both publications. At an early stage Ha-Yom became the newspaper of choice of many followers of the Lovers of Zion movement. However, Ha-Meliz was able to convince a large portion of them to shift their subscriptions back to Ha-Meliz, thus significantly undercutting the popularity of Ha-Yom. In 1887 the literary Ben-Ami (\"Son of my people\") was introduced as a monthly supplement to Ha-Yom. Four issues of Ben-Ami were published.Be\u012dzer, M., and Martin Gilbert.
