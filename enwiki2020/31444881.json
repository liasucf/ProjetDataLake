    "text": "Gentiana Ismajli (born 12 April 1984), known professionally as Genta Ismajli, is an Kosovo-Albanian singer, songwriter, and actress. ==Career== Ismajli was born in Gjilan to an Albanian family. Before Genta was born, they moved to Gjilan. A few months after her birth, her parents decided to move to Chicago, Illinois in the United States, where she was raised. At the age of 19, she went to Kosovo and released the single \"Dridhem\". The song became a hit, which ignited Ismajli's music career. She later relocated permanently to Kosovo, and has participated in several music competitions, both in Albania and Kosovo. She won K\u00ebnga Magjike in 2005 with the song \"S'dua tjet\u00ebr\" composed by Adrian Hila, an Albanian composer, receiving 292 points. Ismajli continued her career in Albania and Kosovo for three more years. She had great success; she then went back to the United States to spend some time with her parents, and came back to Albania with new projects in mind. Ismajli sings mostly commercial pop songs, similar to other Balkan pop. Lascivious stage movements with challenging clothes are a part of her image. Ismajli is known for her energetic dance performances as well as catchy pop and hip hop rhythms. She participated in the first edition of Dancing with the Stars (Albania), where she ranked second overall. She began singing in the English language, recording songs that were released in her then-upcoming 2008 album, her first all-English album. Many of these songs leaked onto the internet prior to the release of the album. The majority of the songs on the album were written by American songwriter Kara DioGuardi. In her interviews, Ismajli says she wants to be a famous singer, and in America she is working with known composers and songwriters.\"Singer wants hits in U.S. after topping charts in Plainfield parents' homeland\", Joliet Herald-News, November 8, 2009 (pay site). She released a half English, half Albanian album in 2011 entitled Guximi. Her English songs included \"One Shot\", \"Accident\", \"Something to Remember Me By\", \"Idolize Me\", \"Intoxicated\", \"Choose\", and her debut English single, \"Planet Me\", written and produced by Kara DioGuardi ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Mos m\u00eb Shiko (2004) #Pranoje #Pse Nuk Vall\u00ebzoni? #Un\u00eb t\u00eb Dua #Mos m\u00eb Shiko #Melodi Pa Fund #Dridhem *M\u00eb e Fort\u00eb Jam Un\u00eb (2005) #Un\u00eb Jam Fati Yt #P\u00ebr Ty Jam e Vdekur #Zor Me Mu' e Keq Pa Mu' #Pse t\u00eb Dua Ty #M'puq, M'puq #S'do t\u00eb Pres #M'u Largo #Gabova #Luj Me Mu *Posesiv (2006) #Nj\u00eb Lutje #Posesiv #Nuk Harrohet #Hajde Bukuri #Shko #Largohu #E Kam Shpirtin Eksplosiv #Fjal\u00eb Me Bisht #Lutem #Me Hare *Zero Zero (2008) #Nj\u00eb Her' n\u00eb Vit #S'dua t'jem e Tjet\u00ebr Kujt #Zero Zero #E Pamundur #Qeni q\u00eb Leh #Sa Ilaqe #Relax #Jan's Picikato *Guximi (2011) #Guximi #One Shot #Hajde, Qka po Pret #Pa Ty #Pini Sonte #Pse Ike? #Mos u Ndal #Accident #Number One (Remix) #Shkune Tune (Remix) *Guximi (Bonus Tracks Version) (2011) #Guximi #One Shot #Hajde, Qka po Pret #Pa Ty #Pini Sonte #Pse Ike? #Mos u Ndal #Accident #Something to Remember Me By #Idolize Me #Choose #Intoxicated #Planet Me #Something to Remember Me By (Remix) #Number One (Remix) #Shkune Tune (Remix) #Outro ===Compilation Albums=== *Dekada (2014) ==Awards and nominations== K\u00ebnga Magjike |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2005 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"Nuk Dua Tjeter\" |First Prize | |- |Internet Prize | |- ||2014 ||\"Maje\" |Best Performer | |} Kult Awards |- ||2009 ||\"Zero Zero\" |Best Album of the Year | |} Netet e Klipit Shqiptar |- ||2006 ||\"Pse t\u00eb dua ty\" |Best Video / First Prize | |} Poli Fest |- |rowspan=\"3\"|2006 |rowspan=\"3\"|\"Me hare\" |Internet Prize | |- |Public Prize | |- |Second Prize | |} Video Fest Awards |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2005 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"Pranoje\" |Best Female | |- |Best Popular Video | |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2006 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"Luj me mu\" |Best Popular Video | |- |Best Production | |- |rowspan=\"3\"|2006 |rowspan=\"3\"|\"Pse te du\" |Best Female | |- |Best Camera | |- |Best Director | |- ||2007 ||\"Posesiv\" |Best Female | |- ||2008 ||\"Sa llaqe\" |Best Pop Folk Video | |- ||2010 ||\"Si panter I zi\" |Best Performance | |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2012 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"Guximi (ft.Dalool)\" |Best Dance | |- |RTV 21 PLUS Prize | |- ||2013 ||\"Ole Ole(ft.Dj Blunt & Real 1)\" |Best Dance | |- ||2014 ||\"Anuloje\" |Best Pop Folk Video | |} Zhurma Show Awards |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2008 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"Nj\u00eb Her\u00eb N\u00eb Vit\" |Best Pop & Rock Video | |- |Top 10 Vip | |- ||2009 ||\"Si Panter I Zi\" |Best Pop Video | |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2010 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"Shkune Tune\" |Best Video / First Prize | |- |Best Pop | |- |rowspan=\"3\"|2011 |rowspan=\"3\"|\"\"Guximi (ft.Dalool)\" |Best Dance | |- |Best Album | |- |Best Song | |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2012 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"Ole Ole (ft.
