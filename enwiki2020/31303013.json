    "text": "In mathematical complex analysis, Rad\u00f3's theorem, proved by , states that every connected Riemann surface is second-countable (has a countable base for its topology). The Pr\u00fcfer surface is an example of a surface with no countable base for the topology, so cannot have the structure of a Riemann surface. The obvious analogue of Rad\u00f3's theorem in higher dimensions is false: there are 2-dimensional connected complex manifolds that are not second-countable. ==References== * * Category:Riemann surfaces Category:Theorems in complex analysis ",
