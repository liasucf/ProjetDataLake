    "text": "Caterina or Catharina van Hemessen (1528 - after 1565) was a Flemish Renaissance painter. She is the earliest female Flemish painter for whom there is verifiable extant work. She is mainly known for a series of small scale female portraits completed between the late 1540s and early 1550s and a few religious compositions.Jones, 136 Van Hemessen is often given the distinction of creating the first self-portrait of an artist (of either gender) depicted seated at an easel. This portrait, created in 1548, shows the artist in the early stages of painting a portrait and is now part of the collection of the Kunstmuseum Basel.Kemperdick, 15 Other paintings by van Hemessen are in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and in the National Gallery, London. A number of obstacles stood in the way of women of her time who wished to become painters. Their training would involve both the dissection of cadavers and the study of the nude male figure while the system of apprenticeship meant that the aspiring artist would need to live with an older artist for 4\u20135 years, often beginning from the age of 9\u201315. For these reasons, female artists were extremely rare, and those that did make it through were typically trained by a close relative, in van Hemessen's case, by her father, Jan Sanders van Hemessen.Kleiner, 406 ==Life== She was the daughter of Jan Sanders van Hemessen (c. 1500-after 1563), a prominent Mannerist painter in Antwerp who had studied in Italy.Catharina van Hemessen at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Her father is believed to have been her teacher and she likely collaborated with him on many of his paintings She became a master in the Guild of St. Luke and was the teacher of three students. Portrait of a Lady, c. 1551. Bowes Museum, Durham Van Hemessen was a successful painter in her lifetime. She gained an important patron in the 1540s in the person of Maria of Austria, who served as regent of the Low Countries on behalf of her brother Charles V. In 1554, van Hemessen married Christian de Morien, an organist at the Antwerp Cathedral, which was an important position at that time. In 1556, when Maria of Austria returned to Spain, Catharina and her husband moved there, at the invitation of her patron. Two years later, when Maria died, Catharina was given a sizeable pension for life. Catharina and her husband returned to Antwerp where they are recorded in 1561. At that time the couple was childless. Her husband received an appointment to work in 's-Hertogenbosch and the couple moved there around 1565.Karolien de Clippel, Catharina van Hemessen (1528 - na 1567): een monografische studie over een 'uytnemende wel geschickte vrouwe in de conste der schilderyen, Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van Belgie voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten, 2004, p. 32 In her lifetime she was mentioned by two Italian artist biographers, Lodovico Guicciardini in his Description of the Low Countries of 1567 and Giorgio Vasari in his Vite of 1568.Catharina van Hemessen, in: Delia Gaze, Dictionary of Women Artists: Artists, J-Z, Taylor & Francis, 1997, p. 661 ==Work== While van Hemessen did create at least two religious paintings, she was mainly a portraitist. Eight small portraits and two religious pictures, with dates between 1548 and 1552, bearing her signature have survived.Burr Wallen. \"Hemessen.\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 18 April 2015 She portrayed ostensibly wealthy men and women often posed against a dark background. The delicate figures she painted have a graceful charm and are provided with stylish costumes and accessories. Her best-known work is her self-portrait (Kunstmuseum Basel). She inscribed the painting with the year, 1548, and her age, 20 years.Kleiner, 519 Around the same time she also painted a picture of a woman at a spinet, which may have been a portrait of her sister. van Hemessen's portraits are characterized by their realism. The one self-portrait and the half a dozen other portraits that have been attributed to her are small, quiet pictures. The sitters, often seated, were usually seen against a dark or neutral ground, their gazes rarely meeting the viewer's eyes. This type of framing and setting made for an intimate and dignified portrait. She produced religious compositions which were generally less successful than her portraits. There are no extant works later than 1554, which has led some historians to believe her artistic career might have ended after her marriage, which was common in the case of female artists. ==Selected works== *Portrait of a Lady, 1551, National Gallery, London *Portrait of a Lady in 16th Century Dress, Bowes Museum *Young Woman Playing the Virginals, 1548, Cologne, Wallraf-Richartz Museum ==Gallery== File:Catharina van Hemessen - Girl at the Virginal.jpg|Girl at the Virginal, 1548 File:Caterina van Hemessen Portrait of a Woman.jpg|Portrait of a Woman, c. 1540s-early 1550s File:Caterina van Hemessen Portrait of a Woman Rijksmuseum.jpg|Portrait of a Woman, 1548 File:Catharina van Hemessen - Christ meets Veronica.jpg|Christ meets Veronica, 1541\u20131554 ==Notes== ==Sources== * Chadwick, Whitney, Women, Art, and Society, Thames and Hudson, London, 1990 * Jones, Susan Frances.
