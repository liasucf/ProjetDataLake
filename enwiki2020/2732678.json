In the late 1960s, Bird took an active interest in far left politics, being a member of Young Socialists. In this role, along with Tariq Ali of the International Marxist Group, he attended the funeral of Peter Graham of Saor \u00c9ire who was assassinated on 25 October 1971 in an internecine dispute.

In the early 1970s he joined Official Sinn F\u00e9in and in 1973 was their director of elections in Dublin South-Central. ==Career== For many years in the 1990s, Bird was the only point of contact between RT\u00c9 and the Provisional IRA. He witnessed at first hand the ceasefires and the subsequent twists and turns of the peace process. In 1998, Bird and his colleague George Lee broke the story about tax evasion at National Irish Bank. On the international front, Bird reported on both Gulf Wars and was in Syria for the release of Brian Keenan. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from University College Dublin in 2002. Bird was attacked during the Dublin Riots of 25 February 2006, suffering a fractured cheekbone, soft tissue damage and bruising.

Witnesses included Sunday Independent journalist Daniel McConnell, who reported on the event the following day.

Bird provided coverage from the 2010 Haiti earthquake in January 2010. A two- part documentary about his first year in the United States was broadcast later that month on RT\u00c9 One. In it he spoke of his \"madness\" in moving to the country and his lack of contacts and recognition in Washington DC. At the end of the second programme, he announced he would vacate his Washington post. Early viewing figures suggested that the two programmes got viewing averages of 473,000 and 563,000 people.
