In 1928 the City Hospital for infectious diseases moved from its original location on Hedon Road to newly erected buildings on the Hull Sanatorium site. A major expansion of the hospital was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2005. The Queen's Centre for Oncology and Haematology, which was designed by HLM Architects and built by Shepherd Building Group at a cost of \u00a365 million, was completed in August 2008 and was officially opened by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh in March 2009. ==Facilities== Castle Hill Hospital is home to the Daisy Building, the headquarters of the Daisy Charity.
