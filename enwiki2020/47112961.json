A total of 24 teams competed in the group stage to decide the eight places in the knockout stage of the 2015\u201316 CONCACAF Champions League. ==Draw== The draw for the tournament was held on June 1, 2015, 20:00 EDT (UTC\u22124), at the New World Center in Miami Beach, Florida. The 24 teams were drawn into eight groups of three, with each group containing one team from each of the three pots. For the draw, the 24 teams were seeded into three pots. Teams from the same association (excluding \"wildcard\" teams which replace a team from another association) were placed in the same pot such that they could not be drawn into the same group: *Pot 1 contained two teams from El Salvador, one team each from Canada, Nicaragua, and Belize, and three teams from the Caribbean. *Pot 2 contained two teams each from Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama. *Pot 3 contained four teams each from Mexico and the United States. The seeding was changed from previous seasons where teams from the same association were placed in different pots. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=4|Pot 1 |- |width=200| Isidro Metap\u00e1n |width=200| Santa Tecla |width=200| Vancouver Whitecaps FC |width=200| Walter Ferretti |- | Verdes | Central | W Connection | Montego Bay United |- !colspan=4|Pot 2 |- | Saprissa | Herediano | Olimpia | Motagua |- | Comunicaciones | Municipal | \u00c1rabe Unido | San Francisco |- !colspan=4|Pot 3 |- | Am\u00e9rica | Santos Laguna | UANL | Quer\u00e9taro |- | LA Galaxy | Seattle Sounders FC | D.C.
