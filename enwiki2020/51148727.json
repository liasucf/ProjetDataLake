His career spaned the first 7 seasons of Formula One. He managed to score points in 4 races with a best result of 4th in the 1953 Belgian Grand Prix.

He also competed in the 1950 Belgian Grand Prix and the 1951 German Grand Prix, finishing 10th in the former and retiring with engine failure in the latter. Rudi Fischer was the first Swiss driver to reach the podium in Formula One. Despite only starting 7 Grands Prix he made the podium twice; with 2nd in Switzerland and 3rd in Germany, both in 1952. Those were his only points finishes. Switzerland's next driver was Peter Hirt. He entered five races in the early 1950s, culminating in three retirements, a 7th place and an 11th-place finish. Rudolf Schoeller participated in one race; the 1952 German Grand Prix, he retired on lap three with suspension issues.

A lawyer by trade, Ottorino Volonterio entered three Grands Prix between 1954 and 1957. His best result was 11th in the 1957 Italian Grand Prix, a drive he shared with Frenchman Andr\u00e9 Simon.

He finished 14th and one lap down. Switzerland's first Grand Prix winner was Jo Siffert. In a career spanning 10 seasons he won two races (Britain 1968 and Austria 1971) from 96 starts, with a best championship finish of 5th in 1971. His life was cut short following an accident at the non-championship Victory Race in October 1971. Jean-Claude Rudaz entered one race, the 1964 Italian Grand Prix. His engine blew up in the warm-up and as a result he failed to make the grid. Silvio Moser entered 24 races between 1966 and 1971, starting 12 times.

Following his recovery, he began a career as one of Formula One's perennial midfielders.
