    "text": "Songs and Music from the Motion Picture \"She's the One\" is the ninth studio album by American rock band Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, first released in August 1996. The album served as the soundtrack for the 1996 film She's the One, written and directed by Edward Burns. Songs and Music From the Motion Picture \"She's the One\" peaked at #15 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and was certified gold by the RIAA in December 1996. The track \"Walls (Circus)\" peaked at #69 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #6 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. \"Climb That Hill\" also peaked at #6 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, while \"Change The Locks\" peaked at #20. The album was not mentioned on the four-hour documentary Runnin' Down a Dream, though Petty could be seen doing a studio session of the song \"Angel Dream (No. 4)\". Some songs were originally recorded for Wildflowers and were put on this album to fill it out. It is the band's only album not to feature an official drummer, as they had not yet found a permanent drummer following the departure of Stan Lynch. Instead, the album employs several guest drummers. In April 2015, when Petty's back catalog was released in High-resolution audio, this was one of only two albums not included in the series (the other being Wildflowers). \"Walls (No. 3)\" was also featured in the Tom Hanks comedy, Larry Crowne. ==Track listing== All songs written by Tom Petty, except where noted. # \"Walls (Circus)\" \u2013 4:25 # \"Grew Up Fast\" \u2013 5:09 # \"Zero from Outer Space\" \u2013 3:08 # \"Climb That Hill\" (Petty, Mike Campbell) \u2013 3:57 # \"Change the Locks\" (Lucinda Williams) \u2013 4:56 # \"Angel Dream (No. 4)\" \u2013 2:27 # \"Hope You Never\" \u2013 3:02 # \"Asshole\" (Beck Hansen) \u2013 3:11 # \"Supernatural Radio\" \u2013 5:22 # \"California\" \u2013 2:39 # \"Hope on Board\" \u2013 1:18 # \"Walls (No. 3)\" \u2013 3:03 # \"Angel Dream (No. 2)\" \u2013 2:27 # \"Hung Up and Overdue\" \u2013 5:48 # \"Airport\" \u2013 0:57 ==Personnel== Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers *Tom Petty \u2013 vocals, guitars, harmonica, piano, harpsichord, tympani *Mike Campbell \u2013 guitars, piano, Marxophone * Benmont Tench \u2013 organ, piano * Howie Epstein \u2013 bass, background vocals Additional musicians *Curt Bisquera \u2013 drums except on \"Hung Up and Overdue\", \"Hope You Never\", and \"California\" *Lindsey Buckingham \u2013 background vocals on \"Walls (Circus)\", \"Climb That Hill\" and \"Asshole\" *Steve Ferrone \u2013 drums on \"Hope You Never\" and \"California\" *Lili Haydn \u2013 violin *Michael Severens \u2013 cello *Ringo Starr \u2013 drums on \"Hung Up and Overdue\" *Gerri Sutyak \u2013 cello * Chris Trujillo \u2013 percussion *Carl Wilson \u2013 gut string guitar, harmony vocals Production * Mike Campbell \u2013 producer *George Drakoulias \u2013 A&R; *Greg Fidelman \u2013 assistant engineer *Stephen Marcussen \u2013 mastering *Sylvia Massy \u2013 engineer *Tom Petty \u2013 producer *Rick Rubin \u2013 producer *Jim Scott \u2013 engineer, mixer *Rich Veltrop \u2013 assistant engineer *Tom Winslow \u2013 assistant engineer == Charts == Weekly Charts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Charts (1996) !Peak position |- |US Billboard 200 |15 |- |UK Album Charts (OCC) |37 |} === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Year !Single !Chart !Position |- | rowspan=\"3\" |1996 | rowspan=\"2\" |Walls (Circus) |US Billboard Hot 100 |69 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |US Mainstream Rock Chart |6 |- |Climb That Hill |6 |- |1997 |Change The Locks |20 |} == Certifications == ==References== Category:1996 albums Category:1996 soundtrack albums Category:Tom Petty soundtracks Category:Warner Records soundtracks Category:Albums produced by Rick Rubin Category:Albums produced by Tom Petty Category:Albums recorded at Sound City Studios Category:Romance film soundtracks Category:Comedy film soundtracks ",
