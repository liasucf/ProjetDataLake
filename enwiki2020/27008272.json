    "text": "Perrinia is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Chilodontaidae. This genus has a long time been regarded as a subgenus of Turcica H. & A. Adams, 1854. Previously it was considered a (problematic) subgenus of Euchelus Philippi, 1847. ==Description== The imperforate shell is small (less than 20 mm) and has a trochiform shape. The whorls are flattened and cancellated with a strongly indented suture. The aperture is quadrangular. The outer lip is lirate (= with fine linear elevations) within. The columella is short, nearly straight, with several tubercles near the base.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia ==Species== According to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) the following species are included within the genus Perrinia :WoRMS : Perrinia * Perrinia angulifera A.
