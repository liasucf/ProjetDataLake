    "text": "The Keesee House is a historic house at 723 Arkansas Street in Helena, Arkansas. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, built in 1901 for Thomas Woodfin Keesee, the son of a local plantation owner. It is an excellent local example of transitional Queen Anne-Colonial Revival architecture, exhibiting the irregular gable projections, bays and tower of the Queen Anne, but with a restrained porch treatment with Ionic columns. The exterior is sheathed in a variety of clapboarding and decorative shingling, and there are wood panels with carved garland swags. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Phillips County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Queen Anne architecture in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1901 Category:Houses in Phillips County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Phillips County, Arkansas ",
