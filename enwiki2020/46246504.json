When the Maratha forces advanced towards Bengal from Orissa, Mir Jafar and Ataullah Khan, commanders of Nawab Alivardi Khan's army, retreated towards Burdwan without resisting the invaders. As a result, Alivardi Khan dismissed both of them and amassed an army to defend against the invading Maratha forces of Janoji Bhonsle and Mir Habib. After intense fighting, Alivardi Khan managed to repulse the Marathas in this battle. == See also == * First Battle of Katwa * Second Battle of Katwa ==References== Burdwan 1747 Burdwan Category:1747 in India ",
