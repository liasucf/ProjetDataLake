    "text": "The 2002 English language hymn book Sing To The Lord book The earliest Christadelphian hymn book published was the \"Sacred Melodist\" which was published by Benjamin Wilson in Geneva, Illinois in 1860. The next was the hymn book published for the use of Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God (an early name for Christadelphians)Peter Hemingray, John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith 2003 p. 235 by George Dowie in Edinburgh in 1864.Andrew Wilson, History of the Christadelphians 1864\u20131885: the emergence of a denomination 1997, p. 326 \"The Golden Harp\" was put together in 1864 by Scotsman Robert Roberts. This was then followed a year later by first 'official' (as the Christadelphians had not been named as such until then) book, compiled also by Roberts, and was called simply \"The Christadelphian Hymn Book.\" It contained 223 psalms/hymns and 50 anthems but no music. In 1869 Roberts produced a version of this book with music included. The first major revision of the official book took place in 1932 under the guidance of Charles Curwen Walker of Birmingham, England, the editor of The Christadelphian magazine. There were 73 new songs added, including some originals. It was further expanded in 1962 by John Carter, also editor of the magazine, and L G Sargent. Its simple monotone front cover with gold writing gave it the nickname \"The Black Hymn Book.\" The last major revision, this time by various members of the denomination, was in 2002. Subtitled Psalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs the cover colour was changed to green, the number of songs increased to 438 and the hymns and anthems were no longer in separate sections. As most Christadelphians own their own hymn books (i.e. they are not communal) many get their names or initials embossed on them. The 2002 version of the book is also available in E-book format from The Christadelphian publishing office. Christadelphian hymnody makes considerable use of the hymns of the Anglican and British Protestant traditions (even in US ecclesias the hymnody is typically more British than American). In many Christadelphian hymn books a sizeable proportion of hymns are drawn from the Scottish Psalter and non- Christadelphian hymn-writers including Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley, William Cowper and John Newton. Despite incorporating non-Christadelphian hymns however, Christadelphian hymnody preserves the essential teachings of the community. Complimentary (or very rarely alternative) books used by the community have included The Sunday School Union Hymn Book (1897), Suffolk St Christadelphian Hymn Book (1903), Sing to the Lord (1978) and Praise the Lord (1993). Whilst the books mentioned above (or translations thereof) are often used outside the English-speaking world there are a variety of different books in many different languages. ==References== Category:Hymnals Category:Christadelphianism ",
