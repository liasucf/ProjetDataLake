    "text": "Tatchun was an electoral district which returned an MLA to the Legislative Assembly of the Yukon Territory in Canada. It was created in 1978 out of the ridings of Klondike and Pelly River. It was abolished in 1992 when it was amalgamated with the riding of Mayo to form the riding of Mayo-Tatchun. The district included the communities of Carmacks, Pelly Crossing, and Little Salmon. It was situated on the historical territory of the Selkirk First Nation, the First Nation of Na-Cho Ny\u00e4k Dun, the Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation, and the Ross River Dena Council of the Kaska Dena. At creation, the population of the electorate was 325 voters and by abolition it was 418 voters. When partisan politics was introduced to the Yukon in the 1978 election, Tatchun was one of the initial electoral districts established. At the time, it was one of the Yukon's nine rural ridings. It was bordered by the ridings of Mayo, Klondike, Faro, Kluane, Hootalinqua, and Campbell.Report of the Chief Electoral Officer of Yukon on the 1985 General Election (p. 10/26).
