    "text": "Picris (oxtongues) is a genus in the sunflower family described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753. Picris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, such as the grass moth Diasemia reticularis. Schinia cardui feeds exclusively on P. hieracioides. The genus is widespread across Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.Flora of China Vol. 20-21 Page 347 \u6bdb\u8fde\u83dc\u5c5e mao lian cai shu Picris Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 2: 792. 1753.

Linnaeus initially described four species with P. hieracioides, P. echioides, P. pyrenaica and P. asplenioides. In 1913, Britton and Brown proposed P. asplenioides as the type species for the genus. Subsequently, in 1930, Hitchcock and Green alternatively proposed P. hieracioides as the type species. The Hitchcock and Green proposal was adopted by Lack in 1975 and accepted by Jarvis in 1992. Lack argued that Linnaeus never saw P. asplenioides which Linnaeus regarded as an obscure species and no specimen could be found in the Linnean Herbarium. For this reason Lack concluded that P. hieracioides should be designated as the type species. In 1794, the German botanist Conrad Moench described the genus Medicusia and the species M. aspera. This genus has not been accepted and is considered a synonym of Picris. M. aspera has also been determined to be a synonym of P. rhagadioloides. ===Etymology=== Picris is from the Greek picros meaning bitter in reference to the bitter taste of some species in the Genus. ===Species=== ; SpeciesThe Plant List search for Picris ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Cichorieae Category:Asteraceae genera Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
