He was a National Research Council postdoctoral fellow at the Naval Research Laboratory in 1976-77 and a research scientist in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT from 1977 to 1980. He joined the faculty of the University of Maryland in 1980 as a research assistant, where his research interests include nonlinear dynamics and chaos and plasma theory. He was appointed professor at Maryland in 1989. He was named a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2012 for contributions to the theory of magnetically confined plasmas, laser-plasma interactions and high power coherent radiation sources and then a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1986 for contributions to the theory of the stability of high temperature plasmas and the theory of the production of intense ion beams\". He is married with 3 children. == References == Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Cornell University alumni Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:University of Maryland, College Park faculty Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society ",
