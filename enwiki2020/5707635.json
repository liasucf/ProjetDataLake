    "text": "WKYU-TV, virtual channel 24 (UHF digital channel 18), is a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member television station licensed to Bowling Green, Kentucky, United States. Owned by Western Kentucky University as an arm of its Information Technology department, the station is sister to National Public Radio (NPR) member network WKU Public Radio and its flagship station WKYU-FM. The two outlets share studios on College Heights Boulevard on the WKU campus; WKYU-TV's transmitter is located north of Bowling Green along KY 185, on a tower shared with ABC/Fox/CW+ affiliate WBKO (channel 13).http://rabbitears.info/tower.php?request=site&asrn;=1048806 WKYU-TV is a member of PBS' Program Differentiation Plan (PDP), previously known as the \"Beta\" group; as the Bowling Green market's secondary PBS station, it only airs 25% of the network's schedule. ==History== WKYU-TV logo from the early 1990s to 2013 The Broadcasting and Mass Media Department of Western Kentucky University was granted a construction permit by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on February 28, 1986, to build a public television station under the chosen callsign WKYU-TV to match that of its pre-existing NPR member radio outlet WKYU-FM. WKYU-TV would not only compete with locally based Kentucky Educational Television (KET) station WKGB-TV (channel 53), but also be a source for locally produced public affairs programming focusing solely on the south-central Kentucky area. The station signed on the air for the first time on January 15, 1989. Upon signing on, it became the second PBS member station within Kentucky that was not aligned with the statewide PBS member network KET. WKYU-TV became the state's only PBS station not affiliated with KET when Louisville's long-time PBS member station WKPC-TV was purchased by KET in 1997. To date, WKYU-TV is one of the smallest standalone stations in the PBS system and competes with KET, through WKGB and any of KET's other nearby stations, for viewing allegiances. After years of branding as \"WKYU-TV\" or WKYU PBS for most of its history, the station rebranded as WKU PBS in 2013, using the university's logo along with the PBS icon. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

TV stations ending analog service on Feb. 17. NBC News. Retrieved March 19, 2015. The digital signal, which began operation in 2003, continued to be broadcast on its pre-transition channel 18, but through the use of PSIP, viewers see it displayed as virtual channel 24, the station's former analog channel number. ===WKYU-DT2 and DT3=== In 2010, WKYU-TV began airing the Create TV channel that is syndicated by American Public Television on their second digital subchannel, replacing the audio-only simulcast of WKU Public Radio. The Create TV channel features how- to programs and some cooking and travel shows, as well as PBS Newshour, which is broadcast on the DT2 subchannel in order to make room for local programming. Around the same time, WKYU-DT3 began featuring the National Weather Service Fort Campbell weather radar on the screen, and simulcasting NOAA Weather Radio station KIH-45, which operates on 162.400 MHz on the weather band radio dial. It was also previously simulcast on a fourth digital sub-channel before the fourth subchannel was discontinued in late 2010. In 2017, the radar display was upgraded to use GRLevel3 software, discontinuing use of the web image. ==Programming== WKYU-TV's program schedule consists mainly of PBS programs as well as programs syndicated by American Public Television. Its program schedule for the day was previously posted in \"Community Calendar\" slides shown with audio of WKU Public Radio during downtime from 3:00 to 7:00 a.m. CT (11 p.m. to 7 a.m. before 2012). This ended in 2016, when WKYU-TV began to broadcast actual programming 24 hours a day, thus discontinuing the community calendar slides in the overnight hours.. ===Notable local programming=== WKYU-TV's local programming includes public affairs programs such as: *MainStreet \u2013 a look at happenings around the region *Outlook \u2013 interview show *Coach's Corner \u2013 magazine-style program involving WKU athletics (seasonal) *Lost River Sessions \u2013 Emmy award winning concert style show. ===WKU sports broadcasts=== WKYU-TV occasionally airs Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football and men's and women's basketball games that do not appear on regional or national commercial sports networks. The games are broadcast under a banner called \"Hilltopper Sports Satellite Network,\" in which WKYU-TV is the flagship station.\"Hilltopper Sports Satellite Network to Televise 18 WKU Basketball Games\". WKUSports.com. October 14, 2015. Retrieved October 15, 2015. Select WKU men's basketball games on WKYU-TV under that branding were previously simulcast on Fox College Sports, with the audio from the Hilltopper IMG Sports Network. As of 2018, these broadcasts were moved from Fox College Sports to Facebook Live (for exhibitions) and ESPN+. Some of WKU's games may be shown via Sinclair Broadcast Group-operated Stadium's Conference USA syndication package beginning in fall 2014 (when Stadium was known as American Sports Network), hence, WKYU-TV serves as a part-time affiliate of Stadium since Bowling Green has no television station owned by Sinclair. This often takes the form of preempting programming to carry the Stadium linear signal for the duration of the event. ===Newscasts=== WKYU-TV occasionally broadcasts replays of WKU student-produced 6 p.m. newscasts originating from WKU Cable 12, named NewsChannel 12, just before signing off and switching to Community Calendar mode.Student Media WKU.edu.
