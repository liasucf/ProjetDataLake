    "text": "Giovanni Giacomo Monti (born 1692) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. He trained with Agostino Mitelli, the pre-eminent quadratura painter from Bologna. Monti became a colleague of Baldassare Bianchi, Mitelli's son- in-law. This partnership also met with success particularly at Mantua, where they both received regular salaries from the Ducal Court. Their figure-painter was Giovanni Battista Caccioli of Budrio, pupil to Domenico Maria Canuti and a follower of Carlo Cignani. ==References== * Category:People from Bologna Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:18th-century Italian painters Category:Bolognese painters Category:Italian Baroque painters Category:Quadratura painters Category:1692 births Category:Year of death missing ",
