His family were strict Congregationalists, a belief he followed his entire life.Bulcock, Robert (1832\u20131900) \u2013 Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 14 March 2015. Bulcock arrived in Queensland in 1855 and took up farming before becoming a seedsman and produce merchant in Queen Street, Brisbane. He was president of the Temperance Council and his strict adherence to its views made him unpopular in many quarters. In the late 1870s, Bulcock became involved in the publication of the Queensland Evangelical Standard and, although remaining involved with the temperance movement, he retired from business to enter politics. ==Political== In October 1885, Bulcock won the seat of Enoggera in a by-election bought on by the resignation of John Bale. He held the seat for two and a half years but did not stand for re-election at the 1888 colonial election. Bulcock was called up to the Legislative Council in October 1894 and held the seat till his death six years later. ==Personal life== Before he left Clitheroe in England, Bulcock married Elizabeth Grandidge, of Shipton, Yorkshire, and together they had eleven children. Bulcock died in 1900 and was buried in Toowong Cemetery.Bulcock Robert \u2013 Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search. Retrieved 14 March 2015. Bulcock was a man of strong character, and once he decided on a course of action, he would not stray from that line. ==References== Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Council Category:1832 births Category:1900 deaths Category:Burials at Toowong Cemetery Category:19th-century Australian politicians ",
