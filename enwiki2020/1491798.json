    "text": "Gerard Piqu\u00e9 Bernabeu (, ; born 2 February 1987) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Barcelona. Piqu\u00e9 is considered to be one of the best defenders in the world. Originally one of the most promising students at La Masia, Piqu\u00e9 joined the Manchester United academy in 2004, where he remained for four years, in which he had some trouble adjusting to the Premier League football style. He returned to Barcelona in 2008 under Pep Guardiola's leadership and helped the club win trebles in 2008\u201309 and 2014\u201315. He is one of only four players to have won the UEFA Champions League two years in a row with different teams, the others being Marcel Desailly, Paulo Sousa and Samuel Eto'o. Piqu\u00e9 has also represented Spain 102 times, making his debut on 11 February 2009. He played an integral role in the Spain teams that won the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012. He retired from the national team after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Piqu\u00e9 started his career in FC Barcelona's youth teams as a defensive midfielder, but before he signed his first professional contract with the club, he decided to join Manchester United. The Premier League club did not pay a fee for Piqu\u00e9 as he was too young to have a professional contract. ===Manchester United=== Piqu\u00e9 made his debut for Manchester United in October 2004, as a centre-back, a 67th minute replacement for John O'Shea in a 3\u20130 League Cup victory at Crewe Alexandra. He made his full debut in January 2005 in a 0\u20130 FA Cup draw with Exeter City. Pique made his Premier League debut on 15 October 2005, again as a substitute for O'Shea, in a 3\u20131 win over Sunderland. His first league start came on 29 March 2006 against West Ham United at Old Trafford, playing at right-back, as Gary Neville was unavailable through injury. His performances, most notably in the reserve team, earned him a new contract, which he signed in February 2005, to run until the summer of 2009. On 4 August 2006, however, La Liga club Real Zaragoza secured Piqu\u00e9 on a season-long loan. The conditions of the loan involved Piqu\u00e9 having to feature in at least 20 games for the Aragonese club, which he did, as he made 22 first team appearances in a successful spell, alongside Argentine Gabriel Milito, either as a centre-back or a defensive midfielder. On 5 May 2007, it was announced that Piqu\u00e9 would be staying at Old Trafford for the following season. Sir Alex Ferguson had intended to assess Piqu\u00e9's form at La Romareda on 6 May, prior to a meeting where the two parties would discuss Piqu\u00e9's future prospects with the club. However, Ferguson was unable to attend on account of airline difficulties. Piqu\u00e9's return to Old Trafford saw him make nine league appearances during the 2007\u201308 season. In his first start in the UEFA Champions League, a 4\u20130 home win against Dynamo Kyiv on 7 November 2007, Piqu\u00e9 scored the first of Manchester United's four goals in that match. In doing so, he became the 450th player to score at least one goal for the club. His second goal for the club also came in the Champions League, in an away match to Roma on 12 December 2007. ===Return to Barcelona=== Piqu\u00e9 during the 2008 Joan Gamper Trophy On 27 May 2008, Piqu\u00e9 signed a four-year contract with Barcelona, with a \u20ac5 million buy-out clause. Barcelona paid a \u00a35 million fee for the player. He expressed his joy at re- signing with his boyhood club, although he admitted he had enjoyed his spell at Manchester United: Piqu\u00e9's first goal for Barcelona came in the club's 2\u20135 Champions League group stage win at Sporting CP on 26 November 2008. His first domestic goal for the club followed two months later, on 29 January 2009, in a Copa del Rey match against local rivals Espanyol. The goal, which came from a corner kick in the 57th minute, turned out to be the game winner in a 3\u20132 victory for Barcelona. On 2 May 2009, Piqu\u00e9 scored Barcelona's sixth goal in a 2\u20136 El Cl\u00e1sico win against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium, which saw him produce a passionate goal celebration where he grabbed his Barcelona jersey. On 13 May 2009, he picked up the first trophy of his Barcelona career as he helped his club to a 4\u20131 victory over Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey Final. Three days later, Barcelona clinched the league title after Real Madrid lost 3\u20132 to Villarreal, with two games left in the season. Piqu\u00e9 warming up for Barcelona in 2014 On 27 May 2009, Piqu\u00e9 played against his former club Manchester United in the 2009 Champions League Final, which Barcelona won 2\u20130, completing a historic treble. On 19 December 2009, Piqu\u00e9 was in the Barcelona team which beat Argentine club Estudiantes 2\u20131 in the Club World Cup Final. Piqu\u00e9 assisted Pedro's 89th minute equalising goal which took the match to extra-time. On 26 February 2010, Piqu\u00e9 signed a contract extension to keep him at Barcelona until at least summer 2015. On 28 April 2010, Piqu\u00e9 scored in Barcelona's Champions League semi-final second leg against Inter Milan, though his team went out 3\u20132 on aggregate.Barcelona 1 \u2013 0 Internazionale ESPN Soccernet, 28 April 2010 On 28 May 2011, Piqu\u00e9 played in his second Champions League Final. Bar\u00e7a defeated Manchester United 3\u20131 at Wembley Stadium to lift the European Cup for the second time in three seasons. On 1 May 2013, Piqu\u00e9 scored an own goal for Bayern Munich in Camp Nou, making the score 2\u20130 to Bayern. Later, Bayern went on to win 3\u20130 and 7\u20130 on aggregate. ESPN FC, 1 May 2013 On 20 May 2014, Piqu\u00e9 signed a contract extension with Barcelona, keeping him at the club until 2019. On 6 June 2015, Piqu\u00e9 started for Bar\u00e7a in the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final, as the club won its fifth European Cup by beating Juventus at Berlin's Olympiastadion. This made Barcelona the first club in history to win the treble of domestic league, domestic cup and European Cup twice. Piqu\u00e9, Lionel Messi, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, Xavi, Sergio Busquets, Dani Alves and Pedro are the only players to have been a part of both treble-winning teams. On 18 January 2018, Piqu\u00e9 extended his contract again, this time until 2022. On 25 August 2019, he played full 90 minutes in a 5\u20132 win against Real Betis, his 500th game for the club. ==International career== ===Youth teams=== Piqu\u00e9 was a member of the Spain under-19 team that won the 2006 UEFA European Under-19 Championship in Poland.Mel\u00e9ndez's mind focused on final UEFA, 27 July 2006 In a 2\u20131 final win against Scotland, Piqu\u00e9 put in a strong performance in defence and also contributed in attack, hitting the crossbar with a header and providing the assist for striker Alberto Bueno to score Spain's second goal. Subsequently, he played in the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, starting all six of Spain's matches and scoring a goal in the team's come-from-behind 4\u20132 victory over Brazil in the round of 16. However, Piqu\u00e9 missed the deciding penalty in the shoot-out against the Czech Republic, and Spain were eliminated at the quarter-final stage. ===Senior side=== Piqu\u00e9 (back row, first from right) lining up before the UEFA Euro 2012 Final Piqu\u00e9 (right) in action for Spain in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Final On 6 February 2009, Piqu\u00e9 was called up to the senior squad for the friendly against England on 11 February. He played the entire match in a 2\u20130 win, in Seville. In his second match as an international on 28 March 2009, he was called up as a replacement for injured teammate Carles Puyol and he scored the only goal in Spain's victory in the 2010 World Cup qualifier against Turkey at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in Madrid. Four days later, he also started in Istanbul in a 2\u20131 win, also in the group stage. Piqu\u00e9 made his tournament debut for Spain at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, starting in four of the team's five matches as La Roja finished in third place. Piqu\u00e9 was Spain's first-choice centre-back at the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa, playing alongside Puyol. He started all seven matches as Spain won the tournament, defeating the Netherlands 1\u20130 in the final. Piqu\u00e9's partnership with Puyol saw Spain concede only twice in seven World Cup matches and keep four consecutive clean sheets in the knockout stage. In Spain's 1\u20130 group stage defeat to Switzerland, just before Gelson Fernandes scored the only goal of the game, Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok tumbled over Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas and accidentally kicked Piqu\u00e9 in the face, knocking him over and leaving him with a nasty cut beside his right eye. Piqu\u00e9 played every minute of Spain's UEFA Euro 2012 campaign, partnering Sergio Ramos in the centre of defence. He successfully converted the team's third penalty in a semi-final shoot-out win over Portugal. In the final, Spain recorded a fifth consecutive clean sheet in a 4\u20130 win over Italy. Piqu\u00e9 was one of three Spanish defenders included in UEFA's Team of the Tournament as La Roja conceded only one goal in six matches. At the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, Piqu\u00e9 was the third of Spain's seven successful takers in a 7\u20136 shootout win over Italy at the semi-final stage. On 30 June 2013, Piqu\u00e9 was sent off during the final against Brazil. He received a straight red card in the 68th minute for a violent tackle on recently signed Barcelona teammate Neymar. The match finished 3\u20130 to Brazil, ending Spain's world record 29 match unbeaten run in competitive internationals. In Spain's opening group game of UEFA Euro 2016 on 13 June, Piqu\u00e9 scored his fifth goal for his country, a late header in a 1\u20130 victory against the Czech Republic. In Spain's second group match of the 2018 FIFA World Cup on 20 June, a 1\u20130 win against Iran, Piqu\u00e9 made his 100th international appearance. On 11 August 2018, Piqu\u00e9 announced his retirement from international football. On 25 March 2019, Pique won his 10th cap for Catalonia in a friendly match against Venezuela, a few months after he had retired from the Spanish national team and led the team to a 2\u20131 victory. ==Style of play== Piqu\u00e9 is a modern and commanding defender, who combines strength and tackling ability with good technique and passing. Due to his height and physical attributes, he is good in the air. Although he is primarily deployed as a centre-back, he is a tactically versatile player who is capable of playing as a defensive midfielder, a position in which he was initially deployed in his youth; he has also been deployed as a sweeper on occasion, showing similarities to German legend, Franz Beckenbauer, thus earning the sobriquet \"Piqu\u00e9nbauer\". He has also occasionally been known to use his height as an additional attacking threat by advancing into more offensive positions, often functioning as an auxiliary striker, in particular if his team are trailing late on during matches. His ball-playing ability and capacity to read the game enabled him to form an effective central-defensive partnership with the more physical Carles Puyol, both with Barcelona and Spain. Despite his talent in his youth however, he was also initially accused by certain pundits of being error-prone defensively, and has been criticised on occasion for his inconsistency and lack of pace. Considered to be one of the best defenders in world football by pundits, in 2018, his former defensive partner Puyol described Piqu\u00e9 as \"the best centre-back in the world,\" due to his personal development as a player in terms of his intelligence, leadership, positional sense, composure, and anticipation. ==Personal life== Piqu\u00e9 was raised in a Catalan family. His father, Joan, is a businessman, and his mother, Montserrat, is the director of a spinal injuries hospital in Barcelona. He has a younger brother, Marc. His grandfather, Amador Bernabeu, is a former vice-president of Barcelona. During the 2017 Catalan independence referendum, he was seen by many as one of the public faces of the Catalan side of the argument, voting and tweeting his support in Catalan. He subsequently faced backlash from some Spanish fans for his support of the Catalan independence referendum. Since early 2011, Piqu\u00e9 has been in a relationship with Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira. They met when he appeared in the music video for her single \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\", the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Piqu\u00e9 and Shakira share the same birthday, ten years apart. The couple have two children. Piqu\u00e9 was the face of Mango's men's line HE for four consecutive campaign seasons between 2011 and 2012. In 2012, he lent his voice to the Catalan version of The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists! as the Pirate King. ===Media and business interests=== Piqu\u00e9 is the founder and president of Kosmos Holding, a sports and media investment group he started with Hiroshi Mikitani (founder and chairman of Japanese e-commerce firm Rakuten, Inc.), Edmund Chu, Nullah Sarker and Mike Evans. Kosmos has struck a partnership with the International Tennis Federation for a 25-year, $3 billion partnership that will transform the Davis Cup and generate substantial revenues for global tennis development. In August 2018, U.S. billionaire Larry Ellison published a public letter stating that he is joining the Kosmos group. In December 2018, through his firm Kosmos Holding, Piqu\u00e9 bought Spanish football club FC Andorra. The club currently competes in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, the third tier in Spanish football league system. In July 2019, Piqu\u00e9 took over a majority stake in another Spanish football club - Gimn\u00e0stic Manresa. The take over was also completed using his firm Kosmos Holding. ===Philanthropy=== In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic Piqu\u00e9 along with teammates including Lionel Messi committed to a 70% pay cut in their salaries during the crisis. They further committed to donating towards the salaries of all employees at the club during the state of emergency.https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinasettimi/2020/03/30/lionel- messis-coronavirus-wage-cut-could-cost-him-50-million/#1d13da445284 ===Tax fraud=== On 10 July 2019, Piqu\u00e9 was ordered by a Spanish court to pay \u20ac2.1 million to the tax authorities following his conviction for image rights fraud. The defender pretended to hand over his image rights to his Kerad Project company in order to pay less tax from 2008 to 2010. ===Poker tournament results=== On 27 August 2019, Piqu\u00e9 took part of EPT Barcelona \u20ac25,000 Single-Day High Roller Event. He finished in second place and won a prize of \u20ac352,950. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|National Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Europe !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=5|Manchester United |2004\u201305 |Premier League |0||0||1||0||1||0||1||0||0||0||3||0 |- |2005\u201306 |Premier League |3||0||2||0||2||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||7||0 |- |2006\u201307 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0 |- |2007\u201308 |Premier League |9||0||0||0||1||0||3||2||0||0||13||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !12!!0!!3!!0!!4!!0!!4!!2!!0!!0!!23!!2 |- |Real Zaragoza (loan) |2006\u201307 |La Liga |22||2||6||1||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||28||3 |- |rowspan=14|Barcelona |2008\u201309 |La Liga |25||1||6||1||colspan=2|\u2014||14||1||0||0||45||3 |- |2009\u201310 |La Liga |32||2||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||12||2||4||0||49||4 |- |2010\u201311 |La Liga |31||3||7||0||colspan=2|\u2014||12||1||1||0||51||4 |- |2011\u201312 |La Liga |22||2||8||0||colspan=2|\u2014||5||0||3|||0||38||2 |- |2012\u201313 |La Liga |28||2||4||1||colspan=2|\u2014||10||0||2||0||44||3 |- |2013\u201314 |La Liga |26||2||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||9||2||2||0||39||4 |- |2014\u201315 |La Liga |27||5||6||1||colspan=2|\u2014||11||1||colspan=2|\u2014||44||7 |- |2015\u201316 |La Liga |30||2||5||2||colspan=2|\u2014||8||1|||3||0||46||5 |- |2016\u201317 |La Liga |25||2||7||0||colspan=2|\u2014||8||1||1||0||41||3 |- |2017\u201318 |La Liga |30||2||8||1||colspan=2|\u2014||9||1||2||0||49||4 |- |2018\u201319 |La Liga |35||4||5||0||colspan=2|\u2014||11||2||1||1||52||7 |- |2019\u201320 |La Liga |35||1||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||7||0||1||0||45||1 |- |2020\u201321 |La Liga |4||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0||0||0||4||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !350!!28!!61!!6!!colspan=2|\u2014!!116!!12!!20!!1!!547!!47 |- !colspan=3|Career total !384!!30!!70!!7!!4!!0!!120!!14!!20!!1!!598!!52 |} ===International=== Iberian derby against Portugal in the 2018 FIFA World Cup {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by national team and year |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=10|Spain |2009||13||4 |- |2010||16||0 |- |2011||8||0 |- |2012||11||0 |- |2013||11||0 |- |2014||6||0 |- |2015||8||0 |- |2016||12||1 |- |2017||9||0 |- |2018||8||0 |- !colspan=2|Total!!102!!5 |} :As of match played 6 October 2017.
