    "text": "The Twentymile River is a river near the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska. It rises in a remote valley from meltwater of several small glaciers in the Chugach Mountains and flows out into a large, wide valley where it receives the water of the Moraine and Glacier rivers. Eventually, the river empties into Turnagain Arm after flowing to a broad marshy delta alongside the deltas of Portage Creek and the Placer River.The Milepost, 59th edition, page 556, Contrary to popular belief, the source of the river is not Twentymile Glacier. ==References== Category:Rivers of Alaska ",
