Throughout its over 85 years of history, the club was also known as Metalul Brad or Progresul Brad. In the 1940\u201341 season, Aurul Brad played in the Divizia A, the first tier of the Romanian football league system. This was a notable achievement for a small town like Brad and the team was also able to finish in 5th, out of 13. That was the last season before World War II. After WWII, Aurul never managed to play again in the first league, despite it was never relegated. ==Ground== The team plays its home matches in Brad, Hunedoara County, on the Aurul Stadium, with a capacity of 1,500 seats. ==Chronology of names== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\" |- ! style=\"background:#EAEA54;color:#271520;border:1px solid #373435\"|Period ! style=\"background:#EAEA54;color:#271520;border:1px solid #373435\"|Name |- |1934\u20131950 |align=left|Mica Brad |- |1950\u20131957 |align=left|Metalul Brad |- |1957\u20131958 |align=left|Progresul Brad |- |1958\u2013present |align=left|Aurul Brad |} ==Honours== *Liga II **Winners (1): 1939\u201340 *Liga III **Winners (2): 1975\u201376, 1989\u201390 *Liga IV \u2013 Hunedoara County **Winners (2): 1996\u201397, 1997\u201398 *Cupa Rom\u00e2niei \u2013 Hunedoara County **Runners-up (1): 2018\u201319 === Other performances === *Appearances in Liga I: 1 ==Current squad== ==Club Officials== ===Board of directors=== {| class=\"toccolours\" |- ! style=\"background:#EAEA54;color:#271520;border:1px solid #373435\" |Role ! style=\"background:#EAEA54;color:#271520;border:1px solid #373435\" |Name |- | Owner | Brad Municipality |- | President | Mircea Glava |} ===Current technical staff=== {| class=\"toccolours\" |- ! style=\"background:#EAEA54;color:#271520;border:1px solid #373435\" |Role ! style=\"background:#EAEA54;color:#271520;border:1px solid #373435\" |Name |- | Manager | Mihai Leaha |- | Assistant Manager | Viorel Miclean |} ==References== ==External links== * Hunedoreanul.gandul.info * Aurul Brad at liga2.prosport.ro * Aurul Brad at romaniansoccer.ro Category:Football clubs in Romania Category:Football clubs in Hunedoara County Category:Association football clubs established in 1934 Category:Liga I clubs Category:Liga II clubs Category:Liga III clubs Category:Liga IV clubs Category:1934 establishments in Romania Category:Brad, Hunedoara ",
