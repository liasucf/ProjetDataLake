It functions as the word-final y\u0101-ye-majh\u016bl ([]) and y\u0101-ye-s\u0101kin ([]). It is distinguished from the \"cho\u1e6d\u012b ye ( \"lesser ye\")\", which is the regular Perso- Arabic y\u0101\u02be () used elsewhere. ==Character encoding== ==References== Category:Arabic letters Category:Persian letters Category:Arabic calligraphy ",
