He then served as make-up editor, chief of the neighborhood news sections and an assignment editor. More promotions followed, as Kirkpatrick was named city editor in 1961, assistant managing editor in 1963, managing editor in 1965 and executive editor in 1967.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 Kirkpatrick was named the Tribune's editor on January 1, 1969.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 He immediately replaced the Tribune's partisan writing and reporting with balanced, objective coverage.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 Kirkpatrick also altered the design and layout of the Tribune, adding new sections geared toward reader interests. The changes wound up influencing the broader newspaper world.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 In February 1974, Time (magazine) named the Tribune one of the nation's 10 best newspapers.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 == Watergate == In 1974, Kirkpatrick sought for the Tribune to become the first newspaper to publish the Watergate scandal transcripts in their entirety.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 Kirkpatrick and the Tribune's Washington reporters negotiated with Nixon's press secretary, Ron Ziegler, to get the transcripts early and then fly the transcripts on a company jet to Chicago, where a task force quickly prepared them for publication. They were published in a 44-page special section.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 One week later, Kirkpatrick, who previously had been a Nixon supporter, concluded after reading the transcripts that the Tribune should call for Nixon's resignation. He authored a May 9, 1974 editorial that used uncharacteristically blunt language in stating that it was time for Nixon to resign. \"We saw the public man in his first administration, and we were impressed. Now in about 300,000 words we have seen the private man, and we are appalled,\" the editorial read. \"The key word here is immoral. It is a lack of concern for morality, a lack of concern for high principles, a lack of commitment to the high ideals of public office that make the transcripts a sickening exposure of the man and his advisers...He is humorless to the point of being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal.\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 The editorial concluded: \"The President is right in urging a quick end to the Watergate affair. His country needs a swift and merciful termination of this agony. Two roads are open. One is resignation. The other is impeachment. Both are legitimate and would satisfy the need to observe due process.\" That the editorial came from the Tribune\u2014a paper that long had been synonymous with Republican politics\u2014made it especially influential both in the U.S. and overseas.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-22/news/0406220265_1_clayton- kirkpatrick-tribune-editor-chicago-tribune/2 == Later life == In 1979, Kirkpatrick was promoted to become president and CEO of the Tribune Company.
