    "text": "Soulanges is a provincial electoral district in the Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie region of Quebec, Canada that elects members to the National Assembly of Quebec. It includes Rigaud, Saint-Lazare and various other municipalities. It was created for the 1867 election (and an electoral district of that name existed earlier in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada). Its final election was in 1936, and its successor electoral district was Vaudreuil-Soulanges. It was re-created for the 2003 election from parts of Salaberry-Soulanges and Vaudreuil. In the change from the 2001 to the 2011 electoral map, its territory was unchanged. In the change from the 2011 to the 2017 electoral map, the riding will gain Hudson from Vaudreuil. ==Members of the Legislative Assembly / National Assembly== ==Election results== * Result compared to Action d\u00e9mocratique |- |- |- |- |- |} |- |Liberal |Lucie Charlebois |align=\"right\"|10,689 |align=\"right\"|36.03 |align=\"right\"| |- |- } |Independent |Gilles Paquette |align=\"right\"|113 |align=\"right\"|0.38 |align=\"right\"| |} |- |Liberal |Lucie Charlebois |align=\"right\"|13,473 |align=\"right\"|50.99 |align=\"right\"| |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== ;Information: * Elections Quebec ;Election results: * Election results (National Assembly) ;Maps * 2011 map (PDF) * 2001 map (Flash) *:2001\u20132011 changes (Flash) *:1992\u20132001 changes (Flash) * Electoral map of Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie region * Quebec electoral map, 2011 Category:Quebec provincial electoral districts ",
