    "text": "The Los Angeles Dodgers Radio Network is a network that consists of 27 radio stations that air Major League Baseball games of the Los Angeles Dodgers in parts of seven states and one U.S. territory and in three languages. , 20 stations broadcast games in English, while another six broadcast them in Spanish. In 2013, Korean broadcasts were added, making it the only tri-lingual network in Major League Baseball. ==English== Long-time Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully. The primary English-language radio broadcasts are handled by Charley Steiner and Tim Neverett on play-by-play and Rick Monday on color commentary. Until his 2016 retirement, Vin Scully's television play-by-play for SportsNet LA (previously Prime Ticket) was simulcast during the first three innings of games that he called (primarily home games, and away games in California and Arizona). Steiner and Monday called the entire game on radio during games that were nationally televised. For locally televised road games that Scully did not call, Steiner handled the TV commentary with Orel Hershiser and Nomar Garciaparra on color commentary, while Monday called play- by-play on radio with Kevin Kennedy doing color. During the post-season, Scully called the first and last three innings solo, with Steiner and Monday calling the middle innings. Scully retired on October 2, 2016; his commentary was simulcast on radio for the entire game.
