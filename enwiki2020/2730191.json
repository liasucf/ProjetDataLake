    "text": "Circle of Love (Original French title: La ronde) is a 1964 French drama film directed by Roger Vadim and based on Arthur Schnitzler's 1897 play Reigen. The film generated minor controversy due to Jane Fonda's involvement, as she was one of the first major American actresses to do a nude scene in a foreign film. ==Synopsis== In 1913, a sentimental Parisian prostitute offers herself freely to a handsome soldier because he resembles her true love. Seeking to take advantage of all opportunities for lovemaking, the soldier seduces a lonely housemaid and then goes off to make other conquests. Returning home, the despondent maid allows her employer's son to make love to her. Encouraged by the experience, the young gentleman consummates his desire for a married woman. Refreshed by the love session, the married woman makes bold overtures to her stuffy husband. Later, he takes a midinette for his mistress, but the ambitious young woman forsakes him for an author she hopes will write a play for her. Instead, he pursues an established actress with whom he had an affair years before. He has little success, however, for the actress finds satisfaction only with young men, and she has a brief affair with the Count, a young officer. Following their encounter, the Count embarks on a night of wild revelry. Morning finds him in the flat of the sentimental prostitute, who this time collects a fee for her services. The cycle of love is now complete. ==Cast== * Marie Dubois as La fille / Die Dirne - the prostitute * Claude Giraud as Georges / Der Soldat - the soldier * Anna Karina as Rose / Das Stubenm\u00e4dchen - the maid * Jean-Claude Brialy as Alfred / Der 'Junge Herr' - the young man * Jane Fonda as Sophie / Die 'Junge Frau' - the wife * Maurice Ronet as Henri / Der Ehemann - the husband * Catherine Spaak as La midinette / Das 'S\u00fc\u00dfe M\u00e4del' - the midinette * Bernard No\u00ebl as L'auteur / Der Dichter - the author * Francine Berg\u00e9 as Maximilienne de Poussy / Die Schauspielerin - the actress * Jean Sorel as Le comte / Der Graf - the young officer * Denise Beno\u00eet as Yvette Guilbert ==Production== Vadim had just enjoyed a big box office hit with Les Liaisons Dangereuses and this was another adaptation of a classic erotic text.
