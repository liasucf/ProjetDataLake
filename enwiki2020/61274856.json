    "text": "In game theory, asynchrony occurs when gameplay does not proceed in consistently paced rounds. A system is synchronous if agents in a game move in lockstep according to a global timing system, whereas \"in an asynchronous system, there is no global clock. The agents in the system can run at arbitrary rates relative to each other.\"Halpern, J. Y. (2003). A computer scientist looks at game theory.
