    "text": "The building of the National Museum Budapest, Hungarian National Museum The Hungarian National Museum (Hungarian: Magyar Nemzeti M\u00fazeum) was founded in 1802 and is the national museum for the history, art, and archaeology of Hungary, including areas not within Hungary's modern borders, such as Transylvania; it is not to be confused with the collection of international art in the Hungarian National Gallery. The museum is in Budapest VIII in a Neoclassical building, purpose-built during 1837\u201347 by the architect Mih\u00e1ly Pollack. == History== The main stairway The Hungarian National Museum traces its foundation to 1802, when Count Ferenc Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi set up the National Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi Library. This would then be followed a year later by the donating of a mineral collection by Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi's wife. This led to the creation of the Hungarian National Museum as a general history and natural history museum, beyond being simply a library. In 1807, the Hungarian National Parliament passed legislation on the new institution and asked the nation to help donate to the museum. The Hungarian Parliament of 1832\u20131834 helped with the growth of the museum as well. The parliament voted in favor of giving half a million forints to help with the construction of a new building for the museum. During this time the Hungarian National History Museum was officially set up under the Hungarian National Museum. Later, in 1846, the museum moved to its current location of VIII. M\u00fazeum krt. 14\u201316, where the museum resides in a neo- classical style building designed by Mih\u00e1ly Pollack. In 1848, the Hungarian National Museum played a major role in the Hungarian Revolution. The Revolution was partially spurred by the reading of S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi's 12 points and the famous poem Nemzeti dal on the front steps of the museum. This helped make the museum a major site of national importance and identity for Hungary. In remembrance of the revolution, two statues were added to the museum: the first is a statue of J\u00e1nos Arany, unveiled in 1883. In 1890, there was a statue next to the stairs of the museum of a memorial tablet to S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi. Additionally, during this time, the Upper House of the parliament held its sessions in the Cereminial of the museum. This continued until the new house of Parliament was built. Today, festivities held in remembrance of the National Commemorations Day of 1848 are held in front of the museum. In 1949, an act split the ethnographic and natural history part of the Hungarian National Museum off of the main museum. They now comprise the Hungarian Natural History Museum and Ethnographic Museum. This also helped with the setting up of the modern day National Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi Library. All of these separate museums are still interconnected, and other museums and monuments have become affiliated with them over time. The most recent addition was the Castle Museum in Esztergom, which joined in 1985. == Exhibitions == The Byzantine enamel plaques of the 11th century Monomachus Crown showing Constantine IX Monomachus and Empress Zoe; one of the internationally famous objects in the collection The Hungarian National Museum has seven permanent displays. The general history of Hungary is covered in two sections: the archaeology from prehistory to the Avar period ending in 804 AD on the first (ground) floor (\"On the East- West frontier\"), and the history from 804 to modern times on the first floor. This display covers topics such as the age of the Arpads, the long Turkish occupation, Transylvania and royal Hungary. More modern and Contemporary history covered begins with the R\u00e1k\u00f3czi War of Independence, showing different sections of his military attire and various coins. The history section then ends with the rise and fall of the communist system in Hungary. In another hall on the second floor one can find out about the Scholar Hungarians who made the twentieth century. A room on the first floor displays the medieval Hungarian Coronation Mantle. The ground floor's permanent exhibit is focused on Medieval and Early Modern stone inscriptions and carvings. This exhibit looks at various stone relics and the carvings that have been made into them. The majority of the items in this collection were discovered during the 1960s and 1970s, since they looked for more relics post World War II. The final permanent exhibit is placed in the basement of the museum. This is the Roman Lapidary exhibit, which is a collection of ancient Roman stone inscriptions and carvings. == Building == The architect, Mih\u00e1ly Pollack (1773\u20131855), with the elevation of the Museum The building where the Hungarian National Museum is currently located was built from 1837\u20131847. The style of the main building was laid out in a neo-classical style and was added onto by other artists in the form of statues, paintings and other architecture. The statues of the Portico were done by Raffael Monti of Milan. One of these is a famous statue of the allegoric figure of Hungary, holding a shield with the Hungarian coat of arms on it. On the sides of this figure there is Science on one and Art on the other. In addition the paintings that have been in the staircase and on the ceiling since 1875 were done by K\u00e1roly Lotz and M\u00f3r Than. There has also been a garden that is used primarily for various concerts. Various artists have performed here including Ferenc Liszt. Today the garden is the venue of the Museum Festival. Scenes from the movie Evita, starring Madonna were filmed on the steps leading in. The scenes depicted the coffin of Eva Peron being carried into a 'Buenos Aires' government building to lay in State. == See also == * Sevso Treasure * List of museums in Hungary == References == == External links == * Official Hungarian National Museum website\u2014 * Museums in Budapest\u2014 Category:Museums in Budapest Category:National museums of Hungary Category:Art museums and galleries in Hungary Category:Archaeological museums Category:History museums in Hungary Category:Museums of ancient Rome in Hungary Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1802 Category:Museums established in 1802 Category:1802 establishments in Hungary Category:Landmarks in Hungary Category:Neoclassical architecture in Hungary ",
