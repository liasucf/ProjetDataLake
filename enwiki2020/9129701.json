Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave it a positive review and wrote: \"A neatly contained crime whodunit with a nifty setup and an expert lead performance from Samuel L. Jackson.\" Eddie Cockrell of Variety wrote: \"Scrub away a needlessly fussy visual style, trendy narrative tweaks and a climax both morally repugnant and logically absurd, and there's a tough little noir about buried transgressions coming out of the past in Renny Harlin's lackluster thriller \u201cCleaner.\u201d Too mainstream to attract genre interest, and too tangled in its character motivations to sit well with the multiplex crowd, this is a minor stain that should fade quickly and leave only faint traces in ancillary.\" == Home media == Cleaner was released on May 27, 2008 in the U.S. and opened at #5 and sold 75,312 DVD units, which gathered revenue of $1,505,487.
