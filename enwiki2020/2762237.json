    "text": "In numismatics, a matrix is an intermediate mould used in the process of manufacturing coins. The use of a matrix lengthens the production of dies, but makes for a gain in consistency. ==Terminology== The matrix is an \"original die\": indeed it has its design in the same sense as a die. The design is incised into the matrix, which is used to create punches. Creation of a matrix addresses the basic problem for coinage of multiplying dies, i.e. having enough accurate copies of dies to produce long runs of essentially identical coins. The creation of a master punch from a matrix is called \"hobbing\". In contrast, a patrix is a type of master punch with a design in relief, used to create dies. ==References== Category:Numismatic terminology Category:Currency production ",
