Like the rest of the range it is composed of gabbro, a rock with excellent grip for mountaineering. It is named for Alexander Nicolson, who made the first recorded ascent in 1873. Prior to this the mountain had been locally known as Sgurr Biorach.http://www.spns.org.uk/oldnotes4.html Scottish Place-Name Society. Retrieved 4 June 2015 ==Ascent== As with other hills of the Cuillin, a head for heights and scrambling ability are needed to attain the summit. The least technical route follows a feature known as the \"Great Stone Chute\", a scree gully that leads up from the corrie of Coire Lagan to a col just below the main ridge. From this col, a pleasant scramble (Grade 2 standard) up the well scratched east ridge leads to the narrow summit.The Islands of Scotland, Scottish Mountain Club Guidebook (1989 edition). Other routes require scrambling ability or rock climbing; while there are rock climbs directly up the flanks, the only other way of reaching the summit via a ridge is the south-west ridge, a Grade 3 scramble that begins up a scratched chimney which can be accessed from the summit of Sg\u00f9rr Sgumain or from Coir' a' Ghrunnda; there is also a slightly easier route from the top of this chimney directly up a shallow gully on the south face. The summit of Sg\u00f9rr Alasdair can be attained by a short detour (from Sg\u00f9rr The\u00e0rlaich) off the main ridge by climbers undertaking the full traverse of the Cuillin ridge, or by those following the circuit of Coire Lagan. The Great Stone Chute (with pale streak up it) leads up to Sg\u00f9rr Alasdair (which is in the cloud) ==References== ==External links== * Computer-generated virtual panoramas Sg\u00f9rr Alasdair Index Category:Munros Category:Marilyns of Scotland Category:Mountains and hills of the Isle of Skye ",
