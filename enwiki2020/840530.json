In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 3,000 strikeout club is the group of pitchers who have struck out 3,000 or more batters in their careers. Walter Johnson was the first to reach 3,000, doing so in 1923, and was the only pitcher at this milestone for 50 years until Bob Gibson recorded his 3,000th strikeout in 1974. In total, 18 pitchers have reached 3,000 strikeouts, with Justin Verlander, the most recent club member, joining on September 28, 2019. CC Sabathia recently joined Steve Carlton and Randy Johnson as the only left- handed pitchers in this group. Randy Johnson was the quickest pitcher to 3,000 strikeouts, taking fewer games pitched or innings pitched than any other pitcher. C\u00e9sar Ger\u00f3nimo is the only player struck out by two different pitchers for their 3,000th strikeout, first by Gibson in 1974 and then Nolan Ryan in 1980. The Minnesota Twins were the first of four franchises to see multiple pitchers record their 3,000th strikeout on their roster, first Walter Johnson (while the franchise was called the Washington Senators) in 1923 and then Bert Blyleven in 1986. The Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees, and Houston Astros are the others with Ferguson Jenkins and Greg Maddux for the Cubs, Phil Niekro and Sabathia for the Yankees, and Nolan Ryan and Justin Verlander for the Astros. Ten 3,000 strikeout pitchers are also members of the 300 win club. Seven pitchers from this club were named amongst the one hundred greatest players in MLB history as part of the All-Century Team, four of whom were eventually voted as starters for the team by fan vote. Membership in the 3,000 strikeout club is often described as a guarantee of eventual entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Randy Johnson, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, and John Smoltz are the most recently elected individuals, all voted in during 2015 balloting. Of the sixteen eligible members of the 3,000 strikeout club, fourteen have been elected to the Hall. The two who have appeared on a Hall of Fame ballot but have not yet been elected, Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling, both made their first appearances on the ballot for the elections. Each received only about half of the total votes needed for induction, with Schilling earning slightly more votes than Clemens. Clemens' future election is seen as uncertain because of his alleged links to use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). Eligibility requires that a player has \"been retired five seasons\" or deceased for at least six months. ==Key== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !scope=\"row\"|Player |Name of the player |- !scope=\"row\"|Strikeouts |Career strikeouts |- !scope=\"row\"|IP |Career innings pitched |- !scope=\"row\"|Date |Date of the pitcher's 3,000th strikeout |- !scope=\"row\"|Batter |The batter struck out for the pitcher's 3,000th strikeout |- !scope=\"row\"|Team |The pitcher's team for his 3,000th strikeout |- !scope=\"row\"|Seasons |The seasons this player played in the major leagues |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color: #ffffbb\"| |Elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#cfecec;\"| |Player is active |} ==Club members== alt=A man in a gray baseball uniform with \"ARIZONA\" on the chest, a red baseball cap, and a tan baseball glove on his right hand with \"51\" on its side pitches a baseball with his left hand.
