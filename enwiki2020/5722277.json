The facility opened in 2003 and is named in honor of Coby Garrett Brooks and Boni Belle Brooks, children of Robert Brooks. Brooks was a Loris, South Carolina native and was the chairman of Hooters of America, Inc. The stadium is notable for its teal artificial turf. ==History and renovation== Home stands in 2007 Groundbreaking for Brooks Stadium was held on July 30, 2002. Phase I of the stadium construction contained 6,408 seats, while the foundation and infrastructure of the stadium was designed to support future expansion to 20,000 seats. The stadium was formally dedicated on September 6, 2003, as the Chanticleer football team opened its inaugural game vs. Newberry College in front of a crowd of more than 8,000. On October 7, 2006, the field was named James C. Benton Field to honor the family for a large donation they made to the Coastal athletics program earlier in the year. ==2017\u201319 expansion== Rendering of Brooks Stadium following expansion Following the announcement of the university joining the Sun Belt Conference on September 1, 2015, Brooks Stadium underwent construction to expand the stadium to 20,000 seats. The NCAA requires FBS programs to maintain an average attendance of at least 15,000 over a rolling two-year cycle. The expansion project received approval from the state in November 2015, but construction was not expected to begin until January 2017. Coastal Carolina University officials set the project price tag at $38 million. The committee also announced in February 2017 the lead architects for the expansion were Heery International, Inc. architectural firm and Stubbs Muldrow Herin architects. McKnight Construction Company was awarded the project, and groundbreaking took place on March 21, 2017. Construction took place over two phases; the first phase expanded the stadium to the FBS-minimum 15,000 seats by expanding the sidelines and connecting them to the north end zone as well as expanding the press box side upper deck. It was completed in time for Coastal Carolina's season opener against UMass on September 2, 2017. Construction of phase II began in January 2018, and further expanded capacity to over 20,000 seats by adding premium seating and an upper deck to the west side. Phase II was finished in August 2019. ==Marrio & Josh Norman Fieldhouse== Adkins Fieldhouse, located in the north endzone in 2010 (Now the Marrio & Josh Norman Fieldhouse) The $8.5 million fieldhouse opened at Brooks Stadium in June 2010. It was originally named for brothers Mark and Will Adkins (Coastal Carolina '89), who planned to donate $1.5 million to the project. The fieldhouse added 1,600 seats. On November 3, 2018, it was announced that Josh Norman had donated a large amount of money to the athletic department and the Adkins Fieldhouse name changed to Marrio & Josh Norman Fieldhouse. The Marrio & Josh Norman Fieldhouse also includes houses: * Football offices, meeting rooms, and football locker room * Strength & conditioning center for all student-athletes * Men's and women's cross country and track & field offices * Men's and women's soccer offices * Men's and women's golf offices * Men's tennis office * Baseball office * Softball office * Sasser Athletic Hall of Fame ==Attendance records== {| class=\"wikitable\" !style=\"\" |Rank !style=\"\" |Attendance !style=\"\" |Date !style=\"\" |Game Result |- align=\"center\" | 1 || 17,249 || October 12, 2019 || Coastal Carolina 21, Georgia State 31 |- align=\"center\" | 2 || 15,991 || October 7, 2017 || Coastal Carolina 21, Georgia State 27 |- align=\"center\" | 3 || 15,545 || November 11, 2017 || Coastal Carolina 17, Troy 42 |- align=\"center\" | 4 || 15,102 || November 30, 2019 || Coastal Carolina 24, Texas State 21 |- align=\"center\" | 5 || 15,098 || November 2, 2019 || Coastal Carolina 36, Troy 35 |- align=\"center\" | 6 || 14,996 || September 23, 2017 || Coastal Carolina 10, Western Illinois 52 |- align=\"center\" | 7 || 14,857 || November 7, 2019 || Coastal Carolina 7, UL Lafayette 48 |- align=\"center\" | 8 || 14,237 || August 31, 2019 || Coastal Carolina 23, Eastern Michigan 30 |- align=\"center\" | 9 || 13,997 || October 28, 2017 || Coastal Carolina 7, Texas State 27 |- align=\"center\" | 10 || 13,659 || September 14, 2019 || Coastal Carolina 46, Norfolk State 7 |- align=\"center\" |- |} ==See also== * List of NCAA Division I FBS football stadiums ==References== ==External links== * Brooks Stadium \u2013 Coastal Carolina Chanticleer Athletics Category:College football venues Category:Sports venues in South Carolina Category:Multi-purpose stadiums in the United States Category:Sports venues in Horry County, South Carolina Category:Buildings and structures in Conway, South Carolina Category:American football venues in South Carolina Category:2003 establishments in South Carolina Category:Sports venues completed in 2003 ",
