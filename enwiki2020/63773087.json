Having acted in over 150 films, Goldberg is one of the few people to achieve the EGOT, having won the four major American awards for professional entertainers: an Emmy (Television), a Grammy (Music), an Oscar (Film), and a Tony (Theater). Goldberg has received two Academy Award nominations, for The Color Purple and Ghost, winning for Ghost. She is the first African American to have received Academy Award nominations for both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. She has received three Golden Globe nominations, winning two (Best Actress in 1986 for The Color Purple, and Best Supporting Actress in 1991 for Ghost). For Ghost, she also won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in 1991. In February 2002, Goldberg sent her Oscar statuette from Ghost to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to be cleaned and replated. During this time, the statuette was taken from its shipping container and later retrieved by the shipping company, UPS. She won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1985 for \"Whoopi Goldberg: Direct from Broadway,\" becoming only the second solo woman performer\u2014not part of a duo or team\u2014at the time to receive the award, and the first African-American woman. Goldberg is one of only three single women performers to receive that award. She won a Tony Award in 2002 as a producer of the Broadway musical Thoroughly Modern Millie. She has received eight Daytime Emmy nominations, winning two. She has received nine Primetime Emmy nominations. In 2009, Goldberg won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host for her role on The View. She shared the award with her then co-hosts Joy Behar, Sherri Shepherd, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, and Barbara Walters. == EGOT == ===Academy Awards=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Category !Title !Results !Ref. |- |1985 || Best Actress || The Color Purple || || rowspan=2 align=\"center\"| |- |1990 || Best Supporting Actress || Ghost || |- |} ===Grammy Award=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Category !Title !Results !Ref. |- |1986 || rowspan=2|Best Comedy Album || Whoopi Goldberg: Original Broadway Show Recording || || rowspan=2 align=\"center\"| |- |1989 || Fontaine: Why Am I Straight? || |- |} ===Tony Award=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Category !Title !Results !Ref. |- |2002 || Best Musical || Thoroughly Modern Millie || || align=\"center\"| |- |2005 || Best Special Theatrical Event || Whoopi the 20th Anniversary Show || || align=\"center\"| |- |2011 || Best Musical || Sister Act || || align=\"center\"| |- |} ===Primetime Emmy Award=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Category !Title !Results !Ref. |- |1986 || Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series || Moonlighting || || rowspan=9 align=\"center\"| |- |1991 || Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series || A Different World || |- |1994 || rowspan=4|Outstanding Performance in a Variety Program || 66th Academy Awards || |- |rowspan=2|1996 || 68th Academy Awards || |- | Comic Relief VII || |- |2005 || Whoopi: Back to Broadway || |- |2009 || Outstanding Special Class Program || 62nd Tony Awards || |- |rowspan=2|2014 || Outstanding Documentary Special || rowspan=2|Moms Mabley: I Got Somethin' to Tell You || |- |Outstanding Narrator || |- |} ===Daytime Emmy Award=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Category !Title !Results !Ref. |- |1989 || rowspan=2|Outstanding Performer in a Children's Special || CBS Schoolbreak Special || || rowspan=17 align=\"center\"| |- |rowspan=2|1991 || Captain Planet and the Planeteers || |- |Outstanding Children's Special || Tales from the Whoop: Hot Rod Brown Class Clown || |- |1999 || rowspan=4|Outstanding Audience Game Show || rowspan=4|Hollywood Squares || |- |2000 || |- |2001 || |- |rowspan=2|2002 || |- |Outstanding Special Class Special || Beyond Tara: The Extraordinary Life of Hattie McDaniel || |- |2008 || rowspan=9|Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show Host || rowspan=10|The View || |- |2009 || |- |2010 || |- |2011 || |- |2014 || |- |2016 || |- |2017 || |- |2018 || |- |2019 || |- |2020 || Outstanding Informative Talk Show Host || || align=\"center\"| |} == Film Awards == ===British Academy Film Awards=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Category !Title !Results !Ref. |- |1990 || Best Supporting Actress || Ghost || || |- |} ===Golden Globe Award=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Category !Title !Results !Ref. |- |1985 || Best Actress - Drama Film || The Color Purple || || rowspan=3 align=\"center\"| |- |1990 || Best Supporting Actress - Film || Ghost || |- |1992 || Best Actress - Comedy/Musical Film || Sister Act || |- |} == Theatre Awards == ===Drama Desk Award=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Category !Title !Results !Ref. |- |1985 || Outstanding Solo Performance || Whoopi Goldberg || || |- |} ===Outer Critics Circle Award=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Category !Title !Results !Ref. |- |1985 || Outstanding Debut Performance || Whoopi Goldberg || || |- |} ===Theatre World Award=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Category !Title !Results !Ref. |- |1985 || Theatre World Award || Whoopi Goldberg || || |- |} ==See also== * Whoopi Goldberg filmography ==References== ==External links== * * Goldberg, Whoopi ",
