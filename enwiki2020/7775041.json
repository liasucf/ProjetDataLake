    "text": "Roger Harring (born October 4, 1932) is a former American football player and coach. He won 340 games over 42 seasons at both the high school and college levels. Harring graduated from Wisconsin State College\u2013La Crosse (later renamed University of Wisconsin\u2013La Crosse). He graduated in 1958 with a bachelor of science degree in physical education. After graduating from La Crosse, Harring coached high school football at Ladysmith High School in Ladysmith, Wisconsin (1958\u20131962) and at Lincoln High School in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin (1963\u20131968). He won 79 games as a high school coach. In 1969, Harring accepted the head coaching job at his alma mater. At Wisconsin\u2013La Crosse, he had a 261\u201375\u20137 record. He won 15 conference titles and three national championships (1985, 1992, 1995) before his retirement in 1999. Harring was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2005. An attempt to rename the stadium at the University of Wisconsin\u2013La Crosse was controversial in the city of La Crosse and unpopular with the public. Veterans' groups opposed changing the name to \"Harring Stadium\" and filed a lawsuit against the university regents, stating that the regents had violated the state's open meeting laws. The facility is officially called Veterans Memorial Sports Field Complex. ==Head coaching record== ==See also== * List of college football coaches with 200 wins ==References== ==External links== * Category:1932 births Category:Living people Category:Wisconsin\u2013La Crosse Eagles football coaches Category:Wisconsin\u2013La Crosse Eagles football players Category:High school football coaches in Wisconsin Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013La Crosse faculty Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Sportspeople from Green Bay, Wisconsin Category:Educators from Wisconsin ",
