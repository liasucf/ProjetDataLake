After one-and-half-year-long chemotherapy and two surgeries, the tumor was removed. However, due to damaged nerves, she became paraplegic. Currently, she is a student of sport management at Ege University in Izmir. ==Playing career== She began with table tennis playing, and then switched over to wheelchair tennis in February 2009 as she was studying in the high school's fourth grade in Buca.
