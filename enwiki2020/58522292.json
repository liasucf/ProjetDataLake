    "text": "The Future is the second studio album by American rock band From Ashes to New. The album was released on April 20, 2018. It is the first studio album by the band after the departure of lead vocalist Chris Musser and drummer Tim D'Onofrio, instead introducing Danny Case and Mat Madiro. Promotional singles for the album, \"Crazy\" and \"Broken\", were released before the official album release. ==Background== In February 2016, From Ashes to New released their first album Day One. While on tour for Day One, lead singer Chris Musser and drummer Tim D\u2019Onofrio left the band. At the time, From Ashes to New had not started writing The Future. Danny Case was chosen as the new lead singer while Mat Madiro, who temporarily played with the band during a 2016 tour, became their new drummer. In February 2018, the album's title and release date were announced. ==Writing== In previous From Ashes to New works, keyboardist Matt Brandyberry primarily wrote the band's songs. However, on The Future, the rest of the band joined Brandyberry and contributed to the writing stage. Case mentioned to MusicExistence that he believed that From Ashes to New had a quarter of the album done before he and Madiro joined the band as their new members. ==Recording== From Ashes to New recorded The Future alongside Grant McFarland and Carson Slovak at Atrium Audio. McFarland and Slovak were co- writers and co-producers of the band's previous album Day One. For The Future, the duo was joined by producer Nicholas Furlong who was a co-writer of \"Nowhere to Run\". ==Promotion== On February 1, 2018, the lyric video for the band's first single \"Crazy\" was released. A month later, a music video for \"Crazy\" came out on March 3. From Ashes to New's second single \"Broken\" debuted with a lyric video on March 9 before the release of The Future on April 20. An accompanying music video for \"Broken\" premiered on August 14 months after The Future came out. ==Tour== In August 2018, From Ashes to New announced a tour of the United States to be held from September 16 to October 14, 2018. ==Reception== Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic felt The Future was a mixture of the band's previous genres with addition of electronic music. In a more mixed review, Sam Law of Kerrang! felt the mixture of genres sounded \"more like the product of some considered planning meeting than textured, individual personalities\" and gave the album three out of five. ==Track listing== #\"Wake Up\" \u2013 3:50 #\"Crazy\" \u2013 3:05 #\"My Name\" \u2013 3:42 #\"Gone Forever\" \u2013 3:54 #\"Broken\" \u2013 3:20 #\"Forgotten\" \u2013 3:50 #\"Enemy\" \u2013 3:16 #\"Nowhere to Run\" \u2013 3:34 #\"Let Go\" \u2013 3:53 #\"On My Own\" \u2013 3:22 #\"The Future\" \u2013 3:45 == Personnel == * Danny Case \u2013 unclean vocals, clean vocals, acoustic guitar * Matt Brandyberry \u2013 rap vocals, rhythm guitar, bass guitar, keyboards, piano, programming * Lance Dowdle \u2013 lead guitar, bass guitar * Matt Madiro \u2013 drums, percussion ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !
