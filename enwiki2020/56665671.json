    "text": "The Georgenstra\u00dfe is a street in Munich, Germany and runs in an east-west direction north of the city center. It separates the Maxvorstadt in the south from Schwabing in the north. It leads from Leopoldstra\u00dfe in the east to Lothstra\u00dfe in the west. In the street, especially at the beginning are several magnificent buildings, in the western direction are simple rental units. The Georgenstra\u00dfe has little traffic significance and it is quiet despite its relative proximity to the city center; apartments, small shops, cafes and other small businesses are found there. == History == The closed development of Maxvorstadt in the middle of the 19th century, extended from the city center only to the Adalbertstra\u00dfe, a southern parallel street of Georgenstra\u00dfe. The Georgenstra\u00dfe was created between agricultural land areas and was initially referred to as \"Tambosi-Anger\". Since 1851, the plots were parceled along this dirt road, the way served since then as a shortcut or \"Schleichweg\" between the Leopoldstra\u00dfe and the Nordendstra\u00dfe. On 13 November 1856, the mayor Kaspar von Steinsdorf in the police report announced that from 21 November 1856 the connection route should be known as Georgenstra\u00dfe. The question of name sake and meaning remains unclear. Karl Rambaldi explains that the road in the direction of the former swimming school, in the Georgenschwaige in Riesenfeld 2 would have led to the name. Zauner also speak for this naming. Dollinger left the name to this day unchanged. The Georgenstra\u00dfe formed, for a long time, the northernmost east-west road on Munich city, in front of the Burgfriedensgrenze to the, then independent, village of Schwabing. From the address book for Munich of 1859, houses numbered 1 to 17 were listed. Also, a subsequent address book from 1861 lists the then local residents and the buildings and assigns them to the municipality Maxvorstadt. In the years from 1866 to 1891, the Georgenstra\u00dfe was extended to just before the Winzererstra\u00dfe around the newly created building groups, starting from the T\u00fcrkengraben in the western direction to allow a connection point. From then on, it also crosses the district of Schwabing. Starting in 1873, the area between Adalbertstra\u00dfe, Georgenstra\u00dfe, the then Schwabinger Landstra\u00dfe (now Leopoldstra\u00dfe) and the T\u00fcrkengraben (today Nordendstra\u00dfe) was developed by a construction company. With the incorporation of Schwabing in 1890, the Georgenstra\u00dfe formed the northern boundary of Maxvorstadt to the new district of Schwabing, before the border line to Schwabing was further north along the present Hohenzollernstra\u00dfe, Ainmillerstra\u00dfe and Elisabethstra\u00dfe. Due to the border function of the road between Maxvorstadt and Schwabing, currently the odd numbered houses are in Maxvorstadt and the houses with even numbers are in Schwabing. Even in 1905, the Georgenstra\u00dfe formed the northern boundary of the settlement of Maxvorstadt, since between the Georgenstra\u00dfe and the Hohenzollernstra\u00dfe were only sporadic buildings. == Cartography == In the plan of the royal capital and residence state Munich, in all its truce shown from 1858/59, the Georgenstra\u00dfe is completely noted. In the fourth edition of Meyers Conversations Lexicon of 1888, the Georgenstra\u00dfe can be seen in sections on the map of Munich from Leopoldstra\u00dfe. In the fourteenth edition of the Brockhaus Conversation Lexicon of 1891, the street is already presented with a sizeable number of buildings. == Transport history == Until 1906, the tram line crossed the Georgenstra\u00dfe with a yellow and red light from the stop Schlei\u00dfheimer / Georgenstra\u00dfe to the East Cemetery. After the conversion of the line colors to \"Arabic\" line numbers from 12 October 1906, this became the line number 7. Also starting from this time, the line 17 traveled in a deviating direction from the line 7 up to the east cemetery. Since 1904, the line 8 travels to the Riesenfeld in Milbertshofen. A separate track along the Georgenstra\u00dfe never existed. However, in 1917 at the house group Schlei\u00dfheimer road, coming from the G\u00f6rresstra\u00dfe on to the Georgenstra\u00dfe and Zentnerstra\u00dfe a reverse loop was constructed, but this was not rebuilt after the war. == Current traffic connection == * The underground station Giselastra\u00dfe has a southern exit to the stop Georgenstra\u00dfe of the city bus line 154. * From the underground station Josephsplatz there are two exits to Georgenstra\u00dfe. * The stop Nordendstra\u00dfe of the Munich tram is located a few meters south of the Georgenstra\u00dfe. == Historical buildings == Directly on the Georgenstra\u00dfe are 37 historical monuments.

The Thiersch residential building was destroyed during the Second World War. * In the house Georgenstra\u00dfe 16, the Slovenian Anton A\u017ebe maintained a painting school that attracted artists who later became world famous. Among them were Wassily Kandinsky and Alexej von Jawlensky. Among other things, they studied technique and color theory with A\u017ebe. His pupil Kandinsky lived from 1898-1901 near the painting school in Georgenstra\u00dfe 35. * In the house Georgenstra\u00dfe 24, Lion and Marta Feuchtwanger had a condominium in 1917. * In the house Georgenstra\u00dfe 34 lived the German-Jewish composer and conductor Werner R.

In addition to the famous film music, Heymann's work also includes operettas and stage music. Unforgotten are his songs from the UFA film \"The Three from the Filling Station (1930 film)\", which was remade in 1955. * In the house Georgenstra\u00dfe 35 lived \"Hitler\u2019s first enemy\" Konrad Heiden from the summer of 1919. * In the house Georgenstra\u00dfe 71, there is an additional synagogue of the Munich Jewish Community. == References == == External links == Category:Streets in Munich Category:Buildings and structures in Munich Category:Historicist architecture in Munich ",
