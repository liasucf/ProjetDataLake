    "text": "This is a list of Treehouse of Horror episodes produced by the American animated sitcom The Simpsons. Treehouse of Horror episodes have aired annually since the second season (1990) and each episode has three separate segments. These segments usually involve the family in some horror, science fiction, or supernatural setting and always take place outside the normal continuity of the show and are therefore considered to be non-canon. The original \"Treehouse of Horror\" episode aired on October 25, 1990 and was inspired by EC Comics Horror tales. Before \"XI\", which aired in 2000, every episode has aired in the week preceding or on October 31; \"II\" and \"X\" are the only episodes to air on Halloween. Between 2000 to 2008 and 2010, due to Fox's contract with Major League Baseball's World Series, episodes had originally aired in November; from 2011 to 2019, each Treehouse of Horror episode aired in October. Season 32's XXXI was originally schedule for October 18, but was postponed to November 1 due to the 2020 NLCS reaching game 7. From \"Treehouse of Horror\" to \"XIII\", all three segments were written by different writers and in some cases there was a fourth writer that wrote the opening and wraparound segments. The original episode even had three different directors. Starting with season fifteen's \"XIV\", only one writer was credited as having written a Treehouse of Horror episode, and the trend has continued since. As of 2019, there are thirty Treehouse of Horror episodes, with one airing every year. The 31st season included a Thanksgiving-themed spinoff, \"Thanksgiving of Horror\". They are known for being more violent than an average Simpsons episode and contain several different trademarks, including the alien characters Kang and Kodos who have appeared in every episode. Quite often the segments will parody well- known movies, books, radio shows, and television shows. The Twilight Zone has been parodied quite often, and has served as the inspiration for numerous segments. ==Episodes== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\" style=\"width:100%;\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! style=\"background-color: #FADA00\" | Installment ! style=\"background-color: #FADA00\" | Season ! style=\"background-color: #FADA00\" width=6% | in regular series ! style=\"background-color: #FADA00\" | Segments ! style=\"background-color: #FADA00\" | Parody of ! style=\"background-color: #FADA00\" | Directed by ! style=\"background-color: #FADA00\" | Written by ! style=\"background-color: #FADA00\" | Original air date ! style=\"background- color: #FADA00\" | code |- |rowspan=3| I |rowspan=3| 2 |rowspan=3| 16\u2013203 | | Various haunted house films | Wes Archer | John Swartzwelder | rowspan=\"3\" | October 25, 1990 |rowspan=3| 7F04 |- | | \"To Serve Man\" | Rich Moore | Jay Kogen & Wallace Wolodarsky |- | | \"The Raven\" | David Silverman | Sam Simon & Edgar Allan Poe |- | rowspan=3| II | rowspan=3| 3 | rowspan=3| 42\u2013307 | | | \"The Monkey's Paw\" | rowspan=\"3\" | Jim Reardon | rowspan=\"3\" | Al Jean, Mike Reiss Jeff Martin, George Meyer Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder | rowspan=\"3\" | October 31, 1991 | rowspan=3| 8F02 |- | | | \"It's a Good Life\" |- | | | Frankenstein |- |rowspan=3| III |rowspan=3| 4 |rowspan=3| 64\u2013405 | | \"Living Doll\" | rowspan=\"3\" | Carlos Baeza | rowspan=\"3\" | Al Jean & Mike Reiss Jay Kogen & Wallace Wolodarsky Sam Simon, Jon Vitti | rowspan=\"3\" | October 29, 1992 |rowspan=3| 9F04 |- | | King Kong |- | | Various zombie films |- | rowspan=4| IV | rowspan=4| 5 | rowspan=4| 86\u2013505 | | Night Gallery | rowspan=\"4\" | David Silverman | |Conan O'Brien | rowspan=\"4\" | October 28, 1993 | rowspan=4| 1F04 |- | | | \"The Devil and Daniel Webster\" | | Greg Daniels & Dan McGrath |- | | | \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" | | Bill Oakley & Josh Weinstein |- | | | Bram Stoker's Dracula | | Bill Canterbury |- |rowspan=3| V |rowspan=3| 6 |rowspan=3| 109\u2013606 | | The Shining | rowspan=\"3\" | Jim Reardon | Bob Kushell | rowspan=\"3\" | October 30, 1994 |rowspan=3| 2F03 |- | | \"A Sound of Thunder\" | Greg Daniels & Dan McGrath |- | |Soylent Green | David S.
