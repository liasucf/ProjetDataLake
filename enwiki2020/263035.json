    "text": "The Calder Memorial Trophy is an annual award given \"to the player selected as the most proficient in his first year of competition in the National Hockey League (NHL).\" It is named after Frank Calder, the first president of the NHL. Serving as the NHL's Rookie of the Year award, this version of the trophy has been awarded since its creation for the 1936\u201337 NHL season. The voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association at the conclusion of each regular season to determine the winner. == History== NHL president Red Dutton presenting the Calder Memorial Trophy to Gus Bodnar in 1944 The Calder Memorial Trophy is named in honour of Frank Calder, the former President of the National Hockey League (NHL) from its inception in 1917 to his death in 1943. Although Rookie of the Year honors were handed out beginning in 1932\u201333, the Calder Trophy was first presented at the conclusion of the 1936\u201337 NHL season. After Calder's death in 1943 the trophy was renamed the Calder Memorial Trophy. In 1991, goaltender Ed Belfour won the Calder having previously appeared in 32 games with the Chicago Blackhawks over the 1988\u201389 and 1989\u201390 seasons. Belfour was eligible for the award because nine of those appearances came during the 1990 Stanley Cup playoffs, and the other 23 appearances were made during the 1988\u201389 season. The nine playoff games did not count towards the regular season eligibility requirements. In 2010\u201311, Logan Couture was eligible for the Calder Trophy despite having played in 40 previous games (25 in the regular season and 15 in the playoffs, both in 2009\u201310), while Alex Pietrangelo was ineligible despite having played only 17 previous games (eight in 2008\u201309 and nine in 2009\u201310, both times sent back to juniors). The trophy has been won the most times by rookies from the Toronto Maple Leafs, who have won it on ten occasions, with the most recent being Auston Matthews in 2017. The voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association, and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10\u20137\u20135\u20133\u20131 points system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs. ==Winners == Howie Meeker, winner in 1947 Terry Sawchuk, winner in 1951 Eric Vail, winner in 1975 Mario Lemieux, winner in 1985 Pavel Bure, winner in 1992 Daniel Alfredsson, winner in 1996 Alexander Ovechkin, winner in 2006 Gabriel Landeskog, winner in 2012 {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Positions key !
