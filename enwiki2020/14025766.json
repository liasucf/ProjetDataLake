    "text": "In enzymology, a vitexin 2\"-O-rhamnoside 7-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :S-adenosyl-L-methionine + vitexin 2\"-O-beta-L-rhamnoside \\rightleftharpoons S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 7-O-methylvitexin 2\"-O-beta-L-rhamnoside Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and vitexin 2\"-O-beta-L-rhamnoside, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and 7-O-methylvitexin 2\"-O-beta-L- rhamnoside. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:vitexin-2\"-O-beta-L-rhamnoside 7-O-methyltransferase. == References == * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure Category:O-Methylated flavones metabolism ",
