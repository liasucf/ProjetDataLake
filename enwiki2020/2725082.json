Angie Zelter (born 5 June 1951) is a British activist and the founder of a number of international campaign groups, including Trident Ploughshares and the International Woman's Peace Service. Zelter is known for non-violent direct action campaigns and has been arrested over 100 times in Belgium, Canada, England, Malaysia, Norway, Poland and Scotland, serving 16 prison sentences. Zelter is a self-professed 'global citizen'. ==Life== In the 1980s Zelter founded the Snowball Campaign, which encouraged mass civil disobedience with participants each cutting one strand of a fence around US military bases in the UK, then waiting to be arrested. During the campaign, which lasted three years, there were around 2,500 arrests and many of the activists were sent to jail for non-payment of fines. Caroline Lucas, future Green party leader and MP was involved in the campaign, and poet Oliver Bernard was sent to prison. In 1996 she was part of a group that disarmed a BAE Hawk Jet, ZH955, causing \u00a31.5million damage and preventing it from being exported to Indonesia where it would have been used to attack East Timor.SchNEWS 62 - 23 Feb 1996 - Hawk Jet get smashed by Trident Ploughshares women She was acquitted for this action in a victory which forced the issue of arms control onto the mainstream agenda. Along with American Ellen Moxley and Ulla R\u00f8der from Denmark, she became known as one of the Trident Three of the Trident Ploughshares, after the women succeeded in entering Maytime, a floating trident sonar testing station in Loch Goil, and damaged 20 computers and other electronic equipment and circuit boxes, cut an antenna, jammed machinery with superglue, sand, and syrup and tipped logbooks, files, computer hardware, and papers overboard. In December 2001 the Trident Three were awarded the Right Livelihood Award. In March 2012, the South Korean police arrested Angie Zelter for obstructing the construction of the controversial Jeju-do Naval Base. In September 2014, Zelter received in Istanbul the Hrant Dink Award for her fight against nuclear weapons. ===Extinction Rebellion=== During the April 2019 Extinction Rebellion London occupations Zelter was arrested on Waterloo Bridge and in Parliament Square, becoming the first activist to be prosecuted. She was given a conditional discharge in June 2019, after arguing in court that humans faced mass extinction unless governments implemented wide-ranging changes.

She was charged under Section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986, pleaded guilty, and was ordered to pay a \u00a3460 fine, \u00a385 costs and \u00a346 surcharge. ==References== ==External links== *Trident Ploughshares * Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:British anti-war activists Category:British anti\u2013nuclear weapons activists Category:British women activists ",
