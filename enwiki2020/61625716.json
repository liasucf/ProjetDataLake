It publishes analysis, debates, and interviews pertaining to current affairs, politics of the European Union, and general topics of significance to the European green movement. ==Overview== The magazine was established in 2012, with the objective of providing a venue for European- level debate amongst the green movement in Europe. It is the editorially independent publication of the Green European Foundation and is therefore affiliated with other European green actors, such as the European Green Party and Greens\u2013European Free Alliance. As the publication of a political foundation at European level, the magazine is financially supported by the European Parliament. Although based in Brussels, Belgium, the magazine covers analysis on a European-wide context. It has various partner organisations and publications in different European countries, including Bright Green, Krytyka Polityczna, and the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, among others. ==Print edition== The magazine publishes print issues twice yearly. The first issue published in 2012 focussed on the European economic crisis. Subsequent issues have covered various topics, including climate change, degrowth, agriculture, and security, among others. Since 2016, the print issues featured illustrations by the Belgian illustrator Klaas Verplancke. ==Online media== The magazine publishes articles online throughout the year on its website. It publishes predominately in English, but has also published articles and translations in 20 other languages. The magazine also publishes audio versions of selected articles in the form of a podcast titled Green Wave. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2012 establishments in Belgium Category:Biannual magazines Category:Magazines established in 2012 Category:Magazines published in Brussels Category:Political magazines ",
