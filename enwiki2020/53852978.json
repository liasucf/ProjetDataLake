    "text": "Pareidae is a small family of snakes found largely in southeast Asia, with an isolated subfamily endemic to southwestern India. It encompasses 26 species in four genera divided into two subfamilies.V. Deepak, Sara Ruane & David J. Gower (2018) A new subfamily of fossorial colubroid snakes from the Western Ghats of peninsular India, Journal of Natural History, 52:45-46, 2919-2934, DOI: 10.1080/00222933.2018.1557756 Pareidae was once considered a subfamily of Colubridae (called \"Pareatinae\"), but it is now known that pareids are not closely related to colubrids. The correct spelling is Pareidae, not Pareatidae. Many pareids are snail-eating snakes that have asymmetrical lower jaws, allowing them to pry the soft bodies of snails from their spiral shells. One species, Pareas iwasakii, has an average of 17.5 teeth in its left mandible and 25 teeth in its right mandible. Other species lacking asymmetrical jaws, such as Aplopeltura boa and Asthenodipsas malaccanus, feed instead on slugs or lizards. Predation by pareids on dextral (clockwise-coiled or \"right handed\") snails is thought to favor the evolution of sinistral (counter-clockwise or \"left handed\") snails in southeast Asia, where 12% of snail species are sinistral (as opposed to 5% worldwide). ==Genera and species== *Subfamily Pareinae **Aplopeltura (1 species) **Asthenodipsas (8 species) **Pareas (17 species) * Subfamily Xylophiinae ** Xylophis (4 species) ==References== ==External links== * Pareids at Life is Short, but Snakes are Long * Pareids at The Reptile Database Category:Snake families Category:Snakes of Asia Category:Taxa named by Alfred Romer ",
