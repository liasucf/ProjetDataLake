The company, led by brothers Jon and James Slavet, raised $3M in angel funding and a further $16M in a full venture round led by Greylock Partners and August Capital. In a May 2000 interview, Paul Saffo cited Guru.com as an example of a company using the Internet to provide new kinds of services where individuals negotiated directly with potential employers. In May 2001, Ray Marcy, who had been the CEO at Spherion, a Florida staffing company, became CEO of Guru Inc. He hired industrial psychologist Janz and Dan Crow to develop new software. In February 2002, Guru unveiled its SmartMatch technology, which matched r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and other information about job applicants to jobs. The company also developed a candidate profiling system using techniques from Industrial and organizational psychology to better understand a candidate's suitability for a particular job. The company was acquired in December 2002 by Unicru, a human resources software company based in Portland, Oregon. Guru's technology and staff remained with Unicru. ==Merger & Present day== Unicru sold the Guru.com domain name and logo to eMoonlighter.com, and eMoonlighter was renamed Guru.com. ==See also== *Upwork *Fiverr *Freelancer.com *PeoplePerHour ==References== ==External links== *Official Website Category:Online marketplaces of the United States Category:Business services companies established in 1998 Category:Internet properties established in 1998 Category:Freelance marketplace websites Category:Employment websites in the United States Category:Companies based in Pittsburgh Category:1998 establishments in Pennsylvania ",
