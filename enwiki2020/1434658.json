    "text": "\"Superstition\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder. It was released on October 24, 1972, as the lead single from his fifteenth studio album, Talking Book (1972), by Tamla. The lyrics describe popular superstitions and their negative effects. \"Superstition\" reached number one in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and on the soul singles chart. It was Wonder's first number-one single since \"Fingertips, Pt. 2\" in 1963. It peaked at number eleven in the UK Singles Chart in February 1973. In November 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the song number 74 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. ==Writing and recording== Jeff Beck was an admirer of Wonder's music, and Wonder was informed of this prior to the Talking Book album sessions. Though at this point he was virtually playing all of the instruments on his songs by himself, Wonder preferred to let other guitarists play on his records, and he liked the idea of a collaboration with Beck. An agreement was quickly made for Beck to become involved in the sessions that became the Talking Book album, in return for Wonder writing him a song. Between the album sessions, Beck came up with the opening drum beat. Wonder told Beck to keep playing while he improvised over the top of it. He improvised most of the song, including the riff, on the spot. Beck and Wonder created a rough demo for the song that day. After finishing the song, Wonder decided that he would allow Beck to record \"Superstition\" as part of their agreement. Originally, the plan was for Beck to release his version of the song first, with his newly formed power trio Beck, Bogert & Appice. However, due to the combination of the trio's debut album getting delayed and Motown CEO Berry Gordy's prediction that \"Superstition\" would be a huge hit and greatly increase the sales of Talking Book, Wonder released the song as the Talking Book lead single months ahead of Beck's version, the latter being issued in March 1973 on the Beck, Bogert & Appice album. The funky clavinet riff played on a Hohner Clavinet model C, the Moog synthesizer bass, and the vocals were also performed by Wonder. In addition, the song features trumpet and tenor saxophone, played respectively by Steve Madaio and Trevor Lawrence. ==Personnel== * Stevie Wonder \u2013 lead vocal, Hohner Clavinet, drums, Moog bass * Trevor Lawrence \u2013 tenor saxophone * Steve Madaio \u2013 trumpet ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1972\u201373) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Belgium | style=\"text-align:center;\"|16 |- |align=\"left\"|Canada RPM | style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- |align=\"left\"|Germany | style=\"text-align:center;\"|21 |- |align=\"left\"|Netherlands | style=\"text-align:center;\"|10 |- |Spain (AFE) |style=\"text-align:center;\"|18 |- |align=\"left\"|UK | style=\"text- align:center;\"|11 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard R&B; | style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard Adult Contemporary | style=\"text-align:center;\"|38 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1973) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|75 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|26 |} ==Certifications== ==Other recorded versions== * Stevie Wonder performed a live-in-the-studio version of \"Superstition\" on Sesame Street in 1973, episode 514. This version later appeared on the collection Songs from the Street: 35 Years in Music. * Stevie Ray Vaughan recorded a live version in 1986, which was released as a single from his album Live Alive. The accompanying music video features Vaughan and a stage crew setting up for a concert he planned to do on Friday the 13th. Many superstitious acts are featured, most notably a black cat that ultimately gets its revenge on Double Trouble, and Wonder appears at the end, holding the cat. This version is still played on classic rock radio to this day, and is included on two of Vaughan's greatest hits compilations. * Stevie Wonder and Stevie Ray Vaughan performed the song together in 1989 on the MTV special Stevie Wonder: Characters. * British reggae band UB40 covered the song for the 1995 horror comedy Vampire in Brooklyn starring Eddie Murphy. * Raven-Symon\u00e9 covered \"Superstition\" for The Haunted Mansion soundtrack in 2003. ==In popular culture== Wonder's recording is heard prominently near the beginning of John Carpenter's 1982 horror film The Thing. It is also featured in one of the opening scenes in the 2004 film I, Robot, starring Will Smith and directed by Alex Proyas. In addition, the song has been used in a variety of other films, including Vampire in Brooklyn (1995), Stealing Beauty (1996), My Fellow Americans (1996), The 6th Man (1997), The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010), and the 2013 film I Am Atheist. Episodes of the television shows Angel, Supernatural and Scandal have also featured the song. The lyric \"When you believe in things that you don't understand, then you suffer\" is in the dialogue of Episode 2 of Season 3 of The Rockford Files, which aired on October 1, 1976. Wonder appeared in Bud Light commercials that debuted during the Super Bowl in 2013. As part of the \"It's only weird if it doesn't work\" campaign, which showed superstitious fans acting compulsively in an effort to guide their teams to victory, Wonder appeared as a witch doctor in New Orleans (where the 2013 Super Bowl took place). These fans would perform numerous superstitious acts in order to receive good luck charms from him. The song \"Superstition,\" specifically the beginning instrumental portion before Wonder's vocals kick in, plays throughout these commercials. Wonder's version appears in a 2018 TV commercial for McDonald's that promotes a Trick! Treat! Win! game. ==See also== * List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1973 ==References== ==External links== * * List of cover versions of \"Superstition\" at SecondHandSongs.com Category:1972 singles Category:1972 songs Category:1973 singles Category:Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles Category:Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs number-one singles Category:Funk rock songs Category:Motown singles Category:Songs written by Stevie Wonder Category:Stevie Wonder songs Category:Tamla Records singles Category:Songs composed in E-flat minor ",
