    "text": "Mutantes e Seus Cometas no Pa\u00eds do Baurets is the fifth album by the Brazilian rock band Os Mutantes, released in 1972. It is their last official release with vocalist Rita Lee; they would record and release Hoje \u00c9 o Primeiro Dia do Resto da Sua Vida later in that same year, but it would be considered a Lee solo album due to the label being more confident on her success than theirs.
