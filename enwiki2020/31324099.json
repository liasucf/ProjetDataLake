    "text": "Haven Toronto, formerly The Good Neighbours' Club (GNC) is a drop-in centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, for men over fifty years of age who are living in poverty. Haven Toronto provides members with low-cost meals, meals-on-wheels, social work services, basic health services, a housing worker, a concurrent disorders worker, a library with internet access, laundry, showers, mail services, telephones, and social and recreational activities. It is funded by the City of Toronto government, the United Way, the Government of Ontario through the Local Health Integration Network (LHIN), and by private donations. Haven Toronto is located downtown, at Jarvis and Shuter Streets. ==History== Haven Toronto was founded in 1933 by May Birchard (died July 30, 1968), a municipal politician and anti-poverty activist. Birchard intended the organization to serve homeless and unemployed elderly men living in Toronto at the time, many of whom were veterans of the First World War. As a strong believer in the Canadian Social Gospel movement, Birchard was motivated by the Christian principle that \"thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\" ==Paul Croutch and the Day of the Homeless== In 2005, Haven Toronto client, Paul Croutch, was beaten to death by Corporal Jeffery Hall, Corporal Mountaz Ibrahim and Rifleman Brian Deganis. All three were members of the Queen's Own Rifles, a Canadian Forces regiment stationed at the Moss Park Armoury, across the street from the club. Croutch, who was 59 years old and who suffered from serious health problems, was sleeping on a bench at the time. Hall, Ibrahim and Deganis also assaulted bystander Valerie Valen, who attempted to stop their attack on Croutch. In 2009, Haven Toronto started the \"Day of the Homeless\" as a memorial to Croutch and other victims of homelessness and intolerance. The event is held annually in August. In 2010, the event featured an exhibit of photos of clients called \"Expressions of Hope and Despair,\" by photojournalist Rita Leistner and member-photographers. ==Patrons and Board of Directors== Haven Toronto has a patron and a vice-patron. The current patron is Elizabeth Dowdeswell, the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, and the current vice-patron is Mark Saunders, chief of the Toronto Police Service. The club's board of directors includes: * Nick Golding - Chair of the Board * Michael McCarthy - Vice Chair * Arif Ahmad - Secretary to the Board * Dan Demers - Treasurer * Matthew Ellis - Past Chair * Doug Arey * Susan Crawford * Ian Foo * Kristyn Wong-Tam * David Burnes * Joshua Cox == References == == External links == * Official site * Joe Fiorito of the Toronto Star writes about GNC members' attempts to raise funds for disaster victims in Japan * Priyanka Jain of the Ryerson Free Press writes about the GNC * Article from Toronto Life magazine about the murder of Paul Croutch * Actress Caterina Scorsone talks about the GNC on ET Canada * GNC volunteer Carol Ann Cole interviewed on CTS Category:Homelessness organizations Category:Clubs and societies based in Toronto Category:Homelessness in Canada ",
