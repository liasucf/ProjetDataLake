He joined the Bowling Green Curling Club a year after and joined a club league and the university curling league. Lazar participated in the 2001, 2002, and 2003 United States Men's Curling Championships.

Under skip Bryan Wight, he participated in the 2011 United States Men's Curling Championship qualifiers, where he made it to the challenge round (one level under the finals). His team finished tied for last in the challenge round. ==Coaching career== After almost two decades competing on the ice, Lazar moved to a coaching role to begin the 2016-2017 curling season. Lazar joined Team Stopera, a newly formed group within the US Junior High Performance Program. The team consisted of Andrew Stopera at skip, Luc Violette at third, Ben Richardson at second, and Graem Fenson at lead. The team had instant success under Lazar's tutelage, winning the 2017 Junior Nationals and earning the silver medal at the 2017 Worlds. Lazar remained with the team in its subsequent two seasons, repeating as a national champion coach in both 2018 and 2019. The team never experienced the same success at the worlds as it did in its first season, finishing 4th in 2018 and 5th in 2019. Lazar also coached the team to an 8th place finish at the 2019 Winter World University Games.

The team competed at the 2019 World Junior-B Championships in Lohja, Finland, the qualifying tournament for the World Junior Curling Championships.

In the summer of 2020, it was announced that Lazar would be joining Team Sinclair as coach. The team consists of Jamie Sinclair at skip, Monica Walker at third, Cora Farrell at second, and Elizabeth Cousins at lead. ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Season ! scope=\"col\"| Skip ! scope=\"col\"| Third ! scope=\"col\"| Second ! scope=\"col\"| Lead ! scope=\"col\"| Events |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2005\u201306 | Wes Johnson || Leon Romaniuk || Brandon Way || Mark Lazar || 2005 USOCT |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2009\u201310 | Bryan Wight || Michael Moore || Joey Bonfoey || Mark Lazar || 2010 USOCT |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2010\u201311 | Bryan Wight || Michael Moore || Joel Dietz || Mark Lazar || 2011 USMCR |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2011\u201312 | Eric Fenson || Trevor Andrews || Quentin Way || Mark Lazar || 2012 USNCC |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2012\u201313 | Mike Farbelow || Kevin Deeren || Kraig Deeren || Mark Lazar || 2013 USNCC |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2013\u201314 | Mike Farbelow || Kevin Deeren || Kraig Deeren || Mark Lazar || |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2014\u201315 | Dean Gemmell || Bill Stopera || Martin Sather || Mark Lazar || 2015 USNCC |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2015\u201316 | Heath McCormick || Bill Stopera || Dean Gemmell || Mark Lazar || 2016 USNCC |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2016\u201317 | Bill Stopera || Dean Gemmell || || Mark Lazar || |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:American male curlers Category:Sportspeople from Toledo, Ohio Category:American curling coaches ",
