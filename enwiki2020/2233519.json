The tree is found in small, scattered populations, and not in large forests of its species. Hesperocyparis goveniana occurs with Hesperocyparis macrocarpa (Monterey cypress), in the two groves where the Monterey cypress occurs naturally, in Monterey County. It is on the IUCN Red List of endangered species. ==Description== Hesperocyparis goveniana is an evergreen tree with a conic to ovoid-conic crown, very variable in size, with mature trees of under on some sites, to tall in ideal conditions. The foliage grows in dense sprays, dark green to somewhat yellow-green in color. The leaves are scale-like, long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots. The seed cones are globose to oblong, long, with 6 to 10 scales, green at first, maturing brown or gray-brown about 20\u201324 months after pollination. The cones remain closed for many years, only opening after the parent tree is killed in a wildfire, thereby allowing the seeds to colonize the bare ground exposed by the fire. The male cones are long, and release pollen in February/March. Typically, cones of H. goveniana are smaller than those of H. macrocarpa. ===Taxonomy=== The varieties or subspecies, formerly included under Cupressus goveniana by some botanists, include: *Cupressus goveniana var. goveniana \u2014 reclassified as Hesperocyparis goveniana. :Monterey County, strictly coastal, within of the coast and below altitude.
