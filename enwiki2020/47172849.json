In 1937 they moved to London, and in 1939 they completed the script for the socialist film The Proud Valley. At the onset of the World War II the couple became more involved in the theatre. Their most successful production was the London run of Robert Ardrey's anti-fascist play Thunder Rock, which Marshall directed and in which Brilliant acted. The production also starred Michael Redgrave, first at the Neighbourhood Theatre in South Kensington and then at The Globe in London's West End. Marshall produced the Boulting Brothers' film version of Thunder Rock (1942). With his wife he co- wrote Tinker (1949), which Marshall directed. It is a semi-documentary film about the training young boys receive before their first jobs in mines. The film won the Edinburgh Film Festival Award in 1949. In the 1950s and 60s Marshall and Brilliant lived in India. In 1966 they returned to the United States where he was offered a professorship in Soviet and East European studies at the University of Southern Illinois at Carbondale.
