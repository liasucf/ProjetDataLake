    "text": "Parliamentary elections were held in Haiti on 14 October 1930. The elections were authorized by the United States, which wished to pull out of Haiti after a lengthy occupation, and resulted in a majority for nationalist forces. The newly elected National Assembly elected St\u00e9nio Vincent as president on 18 November. Following the elections, the last U.S. Marines left Haiti in 1934. ==References== Category:Elections in Haiti Haiti Category:1930 in Haiti ",
