It was one of four solo albums released by the members of Kiss on September 18, 1978. Reaching number 22 on the US Billboard 200 albums chart, it was the highest-placing of all the four Kiss solo albums. Mainly a hard rock album, it also features choirs and string arrangements on some songs, as well as incorporating various musical genres including Beatles-inspired pop, 1970s funk, and rock and roll. ==Album information== Although he is the bass player in Kiss, Simmons played mainly electric and acoustic guitars on the album, leaving the bass duties to Neil Jason. The album features guest appearances from well-known musicians, including Aerosmith's Joe Perry, Bob Seger, Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen, Donna Summer, Helen Reddy and Cher. Though an unknown at the time, backing vocalist Katey Sagal would go on to a successful television career. Simmons re-recorded \"See You in Your Dreams\" because he reportedly was not happy with the way it was recorded on Rock and Roll Over.Gene Simmons, by Gene Simmons Simmons said that he covered \"When You Wish upon a Star\" because he related to the song and was a fan of Disney movies. \"When I first heard that song I could barely speak English but I knew the words were true. Anybody can have what they want, the world and life can give its rewards to anyone\". The songs \"Burning Up With Fever\", \"Man of 1000 Faces\" and \"True Confessions\" were demoed in August 1975 for the Destroyer album but rejected by Bob Ezrin. https://books.google.se/books?id=LXsZCgAAQBAJ&pg;=PT81&lpg;=PT81&dq;=kiss+%22magna+graphics%22+1975&source;=bl&ots;=aJO9Q0RUH9&sig;=ACfU3U14V3pWW85YnTArG0ky2i47c-ST5Q&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjP8ara65vsAhWM_aQKHS_TBV8Q6AEwFHoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q;=kiss%20%22magna%20graphics%22%201975&f;=false. \"See You Tonite\" was also demoed in 1975, and the demo versions of all four songs are on the Gene Simmons Vault box set, along with a 1976 demo of \"Mr Make Believe\"https://www.kiss-related-recordings.nl/genesimmons_thevault.html On the original CD release in 1988, [826 239-2] the first two songs are split incorrectly. The introduction that leads into \"Radioactive\" is split at the 51-second mark while the rest of \"Radioactive\" and all of \"Burning Up with Fever\" are played in the second track. However, the track listing of the cover lists the two songs as two separate tracks. The rest of the CD is split correctly. The 1997 remastered edition fixes this mistake with \"Radioactive\" and \"Burning Up with Fever\" being split as two separate tracks. The introduction played before \"Radioactive\" is left in as part of the song. ==Reception== The album reached number 22 on the US Billboard 200 albums chart, making it the highest-placing of all the four Kiss solo albums of 1978. It was certified platinum on October 2, 1978, having shipped 1,000,000 copies.
