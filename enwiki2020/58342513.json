    "text": "Pimelea sulphurea is a plant in the Thymelaeaceae family. ==Description== Pimelea sulphurea (Yellow banjine) is a small shrub from 15\u201360 cm high. Its stems are smooth (glabrous) and its elliptic to circular leaves are opposite, and without stalks (sessile - the leaves attaching directly to the stem), and of length 2\u201316 mm, width 1.5\u20139 mm. Both surfaces of the leaves are smooth and of a green to bluish green colour. The inflorescence hangs down (is pendulous), and is compact, with many flowers. The yellow flowers are usually bisexual, but sometimes female only. They are hairy outside and smooth inside. P. sulphurea flowers from July to November. ==Habitat== It usually grows on sand, within woodland or shrubland. ==Distribution== The species occurs in the south-west of Western Australia, in the IBRA regions of Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee, and the Swan Coastal Plain.Florabase: Pimelea sulphurea. Retrieved 1 September 2018. ==Taxonomy== The species was described by C.D.F. Meisner in 1848. In 1852, Walpers assigned it to Meyer's genus of Calyptrostegia (now considered a synonym of Pimelea) thereby giving it the name, Calyptrostegia sulphurea. In 1891, Otto Kuntze redescribed Pimelea as being the genus Banksia and hence gave it (incorrectly) the name Banksia sulfurea. ==References== ==External links== *AVH: Occurrence data for Pimelea sulphurea.
