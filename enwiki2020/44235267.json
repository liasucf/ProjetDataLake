    "text": "' is an exceptionally eccentric trans-Neptunian object and damocloid on an orbit typical of long-period comets but one that showed no sign of cometary activity around the time it was discovered. The unusual object measures approximately in diameter and has a rotation period of 35.4 hours and likely an elongated shape. == Description == orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.5\u2013504 AU once every 4,033 years (semi-major axis of 253 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.99 and an inclination of 30\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. Simulations indicate that it has most likely come from the Oort cloud, with a roughly equal probability of being an extinct comet and a rocky body that was originally scattered into the Oort cloud. The discovery of prompted theoretical research that suggests that roughly 1 to 2 percent of the Oort cloud objects are rocky. was first observed on 9 August 1996 by the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) automated search camera on Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii. It is the first object that is not an active comet discovered on an orbit typical of long-period comets. has a rotation period of hours and a double-peaked lightcurve with a high amplitude of magnitude (). Its spectrum is moderately red and featureless, typical of D-type asteroids and bare comet nuclei. Its spectrum suggests an extinct comet.
