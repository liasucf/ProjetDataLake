    "text": "Stafford services is a pair of motorway service stations on the M6 motorway near Stone, Staffordshire, England. In August 2011 it was rated as 4 stars (northbound - Moto) and 3 stars (southbound - Roadchef) by quality assessors at Visit England. It is unusual, in that the facilities on the northbound (opened 1996) and southbound (1999) sides of the motorway are operated by separate companies: Moto (formerly Granada) and Roadchef respectively. They are apart. ==History== Prior to the construction of the station, a geophysical survey was undertaken to examine cropmarks which possibly marked the location of a ring ditch to ensure that an archaeological site was not destroyed. The ditch was not found, although medieval and post-medieval artefacts were recovered. Blue Boar constructed the southbound services, in addition to their services at Watford Gap but shortly before completion in 1999 they were acquired by Roadchef, who now operate the site.Stafford South, Motorway Services Online, UK. Accessed 16 February 2009. The 2019 Motorway Services User Survey found that Stafford's northbound side was in the top five motorway services in the UK for customer satisfaction. ==Location== The services are located in Staffordshire on the M6 motorway between junctions 14 and 15, and are accessed directly from the motorway. Stoke on Trent is located about to the north, Manchester about to the north, and Stafford is about to the south. By road they are about from London and from Birmingham. ==References== ==External links== * Moto official website \u2014 Stafford North * RoadChef official website \u2014 Stafford South * Motorway Services Trivia website \u2014 Stafford * Stafford North \u2014 Motorway Services Online * Stafford South \u2014 Motorway Services Online Category:1966 establishments in England Category:M6 motorway service stations Category:Moto motorway service stations Category:RoadChef motorway service stations Category:Buildings and structures in Staffordshire Category:Transport in Staffordshire ",
