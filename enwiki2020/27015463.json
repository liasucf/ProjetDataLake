A third installment, Love Off the Cuff, was released on April 27, 2017. ==Plot== Since 2007, the Hong Kong government banned smoking in all indoor areas, causing smokers from neighboring buildings to gather for cigarette breaks during office hours at trash bins with ashtrays near their work premises. The regulars started sharing small talks and dirty jokes like friends at a hot pot dinner and this community became known as the \"Hot Pot Pack\". Jimmy (Yue) is an advertising executive who befriended Cherie (Yeung), a cosmetic sales girl, at a \"Hot Pot Pack\" shortly after Jimmy broke up with his girlfriend who cheated on him. Cherie's flirting with Jimmy during their cigarette breaks, through text messages and excursions at night eventually led to Cherie's break up with her live-in boyfriend. This sudden change in their relationship, including a failed one night stand at a love motel, caused them to confront the change in their relationship and consider whether they are viewing each other as love interests or just as companions during lonely nights. ==Cast== * Miriam Yeung as Cherie, a cosmetics sales girl * Shawn Yue as Jimmy, an advertising executive * Cheung Tat Ming as Joseph, a hotel porter * Miao Felin as a restaurant waitress * Chui Tien-you as a 7-Eleven cashier * Roy Szeto as Jimmy's colleague, an advertising executive and Patty's boyfriend * Sharon Luk as Vivian, Jimmy's ex-girlfriend, an advertising executive * Charmaine Fong as Patty, an advertising executive * Yat Ning Chan as Isabel Cameos * Vincent Kuk as an advertising executive * Jo Koo as Double K, Cherie's best friend * Matt Chow as a Leisure and Cultural Services Department employee ==Reception== Perry Lam of Muse gave a positive review, as he observes that \u2018No other Hong Kong movies in recent memory give a more vivid sense of how Hong Kong people talk in real life.\u2019 China Daily placed the film on their list of the best ten Chinese films of 2010. ==Box office== Love in a Puff had a very poor opening weekend, mainly due to the Category III rating.
