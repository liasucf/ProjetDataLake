These are useful for organising competitive teams in sports and cultural events. On creation, the houses were Ngata, Hillary, Cooper and Batten. In 2014, a new house was added, named Cooper; this house contained the school's media classes. In 2015, Batten was removed, resulting in the current house system. The current house names, with the exception of Cooper, are the same house names used for Awatapu College, also in Palmerston North. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Houses |- | style = \"background:Blue;\"| || Hillary || Named after Sir Edmund Hillary. |- | style = \"background:Red;\"| || Ngata || Named after Sir \u0100pirana Ngata. |- | style = \"background:Yellow;\"| || Sheppard || Named after Kate Sheppard. |- | style = \"background:Green;\"| || Cooper || Named after Dame Whina Cooper. |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Intermediate schools in New Zealand Category:Schools in Palmerston North ",
