Jo\u00e3o of Braganza, Duke of Abrantes jure uxoris (12 June 1726 - 23 October 1780), more commonly known as Jo\u00e3o da Bemposta, was a legitimized natural son of Infante Francisco, Duke of Beja. A grandson of King Pedro II of Portugal, and thus a member of the House of Braganza, Jo\u00e3o held various offices during the reigns of his uncle King Jo\u00e3o V and cousin Queen Maria I. ==Life== Jo\u00e3o was born to the second surviving son of King Pedro II, the Duke of Beja, and Mariana da Silveira, a nun. The popular name \"da Bemposta\" comes from his assuming residence at Bemposta Palace, the seat of the House of the Infantado, of which his father was the lord of. Jo\u00e3o was legitimized, by royal decree, by his uncle, King Jo\u00e3o V, on 26 May 1749. His uncle also issued a decree, on 19 May 1750, placing Jo\u00e3o in the order of precedence lower than the Portuguese Royal Family, but above all other nobles. He served as a counselor of state and mordomo-mor (chamberlain of the royal household) for both his uncle King Jo\u00e3o V and his cousin Queen Maria I. He also served as Captain-General of the Royal Armada, the highest-ranking official of the Portuguese Navy, during the reign of Queen Maria. During the baptism of King Jo\u00e3o VI, he represented the baby's godfather, King Louis XV of France. ==Mariage== Jo\u00e3o married Maria Margarida de Lorena, 2nd Duchess of Abrantes, on 20 February 1757. As the couple did not produce children, his wife's titles were inherited by her cousin, D. Pedro de Lancastre.
