    "text": "Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford. Roger Martin (c. 1526/7 \u2013 3 August 1615) was an English Catholic recusant and churchwarden of Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford, Suffolk from 1554 to 1558/9.William Parker, The History of Long Melford (London: Wyman & Sons, 1873), p. 70. He is chiefly known for his description of the pre-Reformation ceremonies and decorations of Holy Trinity Church.Francis Young, 'Early Modern English Catholic Piety in a Fifteenth- Century Book of Hours: Cambridge University Library MS Additional 10079', Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society Vol. 15, No. 4 (2015), p. 552. As churchwarden during the reign of Queen Mary, Martin endeavoured to restore Catholic worship.Young, p. 554. Mary apparently offered him a Secretaryship of State, which he declined.Young, p. 553. During the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I, Martin was prosecuted for his recusancy and he also sheltered Catholic priests in his home. It was probably during the 1580s that he wrote his account of Holy Trinity Church as it was before the Reformation.Young, p. 552. According to Walter Arthur Copinger: > Roger was a staunch Roman Catholic and eminent as well for his piety as his > liberality. It is recorded that at one period of bitter persecution he was > obliged to hide himself during the daytime under a hay rick, but so popular > and beloved was he by his neighbours and acquaintances that they did > everything in their power for his security and protection. He was a person > of great learning and strict integrity.W. A. Copinger, The Manors of > Suffolk: Notes on Their History and Devolution (London: T. Fisher Unwin, > 1905), p. 208. ==Works== *David Dymond and Clive Paine, The Spoil of Melford Church: The Reformation in a Suffolk Parish (Salient Press, 1989; 2nd edn., 1992). ==Notes== Category:1520s births Category:1615 deaths Category:Recusants Category:English memoirists Category:English Roman Catholics Category:People from Long Melford Category:16th-century English people ",
