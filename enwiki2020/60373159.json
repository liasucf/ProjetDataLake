    "text": "Dead Pixels is a British television sitcom, which began airing on E4 on 28 March 2019. It focuses on the obsession of three friends, Meg, Nicky and Usman, for a fictional massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) called Kingdom Scrolls. In July 2019, E4 renewed the programme for a second series which was expected to begin filming later the same year. ==Cast== The series cast includes: *Alexa Davies as Megan \"Meg\" Jefferies *Will Merrick as Nicholas \"Nicky\" Kettle *Sargon Yelda as Usman *Charlotte Ritchie as Alison *David Mumeni as Russell *Noush Skaugen as Zara ==Development== Dead Pixels started as Avatards, which was a part of the Comedy Blaps series on Channel 4's website in 2016, and has since expanded to what it is now. The series creators have been cited as wanting to create a more well-rounded portrayal of the lives of some gamers, noting that mainstream television does not have the best reputation for how it presents gamers on screen. It hopes to do this by showing both the funny and the thought provoking side of gaming and gaming culture. Both the writer of the series, Jon Brown, and the director, Al Campbell, have been described as \"massive gamers\". ==Reception== The series has been described by The Guardian as \"wickedly entertaining\" and \"the sharpest new sitcom of 2019\". Chortle said that the first episode of the show is \"certainly funny and involving enough to entice any viewer\". The Arts Desk noted that the action shifts are \"cleverly visualised\". ==Syndication== In May 2020, The CW acquired the broadcast rights for the series. Originally procured to plump up the network's Fall 2020 schedule in light of production breakdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, the series was later shifted to the network's Summer 2020 slate instead, with its Fall slot being filled by Devils. ==See also== *The Guild (web series) ==References== ==External links== *Official website * * Category:2010s British sitcoms Category:2019 British television series debuts Category:2020s British sitcoms Category:E4 sitcoms Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows about video games ",
