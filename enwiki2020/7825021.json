    "text": "{| |} The MMS class were a class of 402 coastal minesweepers built for the Royal Navy between 1940 and 1945. They were of wooden construction to counteract magnetic influence mines. The coastal minesweepers had pennant numbers MMS1 to MMS312 and MMS1001 to MMS1090. They were nicknamed \"Mickey Mouse\". Although the motor minesweepers lacked the power to tow sweeps for contact mines they were suitable for handling equipment for combating magnetic mines and some later models were fitted with an acoustic hammer on a retractable \"A\" frame over the bow for countering acoustic mines. The motor minesweepers had limited use post-war so they were quickly disposed of. Three were transferred by Lend-Lease to the Soviet Navy. ==Bibliography== *Minesweeper, The Role of the Motor Minesweepers in World War II, Michael J Melvin ==External links== * http://www.navypedia.org/ships/russia/ru_ms_t108.htm Category:Mine warfare vessel classes Category:Minesweepers of the Royal Navy Category:Ship classes of the Royal Navy ",
