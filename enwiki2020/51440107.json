    "text": "Kathryn Jane Worden is an Australian politician. She is a Labor member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly since 2016, representing the electorate of Sanderson. ==Early life and career== Worden moved to Australia with her family in 1981, attending school in Adelaide. She moved to Ngukkurr in the Northern Territory in 1985. Worden was an Alderman on the City of Darwin Council for three years. She was the Chair of the Community and Cultural, and Arts and Cultural Development Committees. She has been critical of Lord Mayor Katrina Fong Lim. Before entering politics, Worden worked at the Northern Territory Department of Housing overseeing complaints and compliance. Worden has been married twice. She has four children and five grandchildren. ==Politics== Worden challenged Deputy Chief Minister Peter Styles in his seat of Sanderson. She won in a rout, taking over 60 percent of the vote on a swing of over 13 percent amid the CLP's near-meltdown in Darwin, enough to turn Sanderson into a safe Labor seat at one stroke. She actually won enough votes on the first count to take the seat without the need for preferences. Worden consolidated her hold on the seat in 2020, picking up a swing of over eight percent. She now sits on a majority of 19.5 percent, making Sanderson the second-safest seat in the Territory. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Category:Australian city councillors Category:Women members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Category:British emigrants to Australia Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:21st-century Australian women politicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Women local political office-holders in Australia ",
