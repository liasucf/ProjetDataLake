It was defended by a 20,000-strong garrison under the French Republican generals Desjardin and Mayer.Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Hulot, Le Mar\u00e9chal Jourdan, Pygmalion, June 2010 () The Prince was aiming to clear his march on Paris, but he had to raise the siege after the Republican victory at the battle of Wattignies and the prospect of the arm\u00e9e de la Moselle coming to raise the siege. == Course== At the end of summer 1793, the Republican forces came to secure Dunkirk, but the situation on the northern frontier remained delicate. The strongholds of Cond\u00e9, Quesnoy and Valenciennes were effectively in the hands of the First Coalition. The Austrian commander in chief laid siege to Maubeuge, to the east of the main theatre of war, to guarantee his line of advance towards Paris. The French generals defending it were experienced but short on supplies. When he learned of the imminent arrival of the arm\u00e9e de la Moselle, the Prince left a major force of 33,000 men to continue the siege under the count of Clerfayt and moved to the Wattignies plateau to the south of Mauberge. After two days' fighting at Wattignies, the Prince ordered a general retreat on 16 October and raised the siege. After failing to take Maubeuge, the British and Austrian forces withdrew north and temporarily abandoned their plan to march on Paris. == References == Category:Sieges involving Austria Category:Conflicts in 1793 Category:1793 in France Category:Battles of the War of the First Coalition Category:Sieges of the War of the First Coalition Category:Battles in Hauts- de-France ",
