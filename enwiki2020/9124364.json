It is a humanized monoclonal antibody, cantuzumab (huC242) linked to a cytotoxic agent, mertansine (DM1). It was developed by ImmunoGen. ==Mechanism== After the huC242 mab binds to the external domain of CanAg, the cantuzumab mertansine-CanAg complex is internalized, and the DM1 molecules are released intracellularly by cleavage of the DM1-huC242 disulfide bonds. ==Clinical trials== Three phase I clinical studies had reported results by 2003. By 2005, clinical development had been suspended. == See also == *Cantuzumab ravtansine == References == Category:Antibody-drug conjugates Category:Monoclonal antibodies for tumors Category:Experimental cancer drugs ",
