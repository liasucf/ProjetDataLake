    "text": "Stavroula \"Voula\" Mili is a Greek molecular biologist researching the regulation, functional consequences, and disease associations of localized RNAs. She is a NIH Stadtman Investigator at the National Cancer Institute. == Education == Mili obtained her B.S. in Biology from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and a Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Sciences from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai under . Her 2003 dissertation was titled, Ribonucleoprotein Complexes In Gene Expression : Remodeling Events And Common Components In Nuclear And Mitochondrial Mrna Maturation. As a postdoctoral researcher she joined Joan A. Steitz's laboratory at Yale University and subsequently Ian Macara's laboratory at the University of Virginia. == Career and research == Mili joined the laboratory of cellular and molecular biology as a NIH Stadtman Investigator at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in September 2012. She discovered a localization pathway that targets RNAs at cellular protrusions. The goal of Mili's laboratory is to understand the regulation, functional consequences, and disease associations of localized RNAs. == References == == External links == * Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:National Institutes of Health people Category:21st-century Greek scientists Category:Greek medical researchers Category:Women medical researchers Category:Cancer researchers Category:Greek biologists Category:Women molecular biologists Category:National and Kapodistrian University of Athens alumni Category:Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai alumni Category:Greek emigrants to the United States Category:Expatriate academics in the United States Category:21st-century women scientists Category:21st-century biologists ",
