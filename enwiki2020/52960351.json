The movement began with the online publication of a handbook written by Congressional staffers with suggestions for peacefully but effectively resisting the move to the right in the executive branch of the United States government under the Trump administration that was widely anticipated and feared by progressives. According to Peter Dreier, the goal of Indivisible is to \"save American democracy\" and \"resume the project of creating a humane America that is more like social democracy than corporate plutocracy.\" In 2019, Indivisible's Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin were included in Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2019. == Origin == The movement started with the online publication of a 23-page handbook, Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda. The authors of the document, most notably Ezra Levin, Jeremy Haile, Leah Greenberg, and Angel Padilla, were former Congressional staffers. Greenberg worked as an aide to Democratic Representative Tom Perriello of Virginia, while Levin, Greenberg's husband, worked as an aide to Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic Party member of the United States House of Representatives from Texas. After the 2016 presidential election, in mid-December 2016, Levin and Greenberg began working on an online guide in the form of a Google Document on how to make contact with congressional aides as a way of grieving over Trump's victory. Angel Padilla, and Jeremy Haile, and dozens of other staffers for Democratic members of the United States Congress joined in the creation of the online publication. The authors modeled their document after the Tea Party movement, which focused on local activism and obstructing the Democratic Party's agenda following the election of President Barack Obama in 2008. They thought that similar action taken by the left could be effective against what they perceived as Trump's \"bigoted and anti-democratic agenda\". The purpose of the guide was to encourage resistance to Trump's presidency, most notably by targeting Republican elected members of Congress by attending town halls, calling congressional officials, visiting their offices, and showing up at public events. It was first published online on Google Docs on December 14, 2016, with Levin posting a link to it on his personal Twitter account. It soon went viral, with, among others, Robert Reich, Jonathan Chait, George Takei and Miranda July circulating it online. == History == Since the guide's publication, its authors have created a website with further resources on using the guide and organizing local movements. The guide is continuously updated and is available in English and Spanish. By February 4, 2017, less than two months from the publication of the Indivisible Guide, and about two weeks after Trump's inauguration, more than 3,800 local groups identifying as \"Indivisibles\" had formed and declared their support for the movement. In February, they organized as a 501(c) organization. Many groups attended town halls, demonstrated against nominees for Trump's Cabinet, and worked with organizers of the Women's March. John Kasich and Mo Brooks acknowledged that the protests would impact efforts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The movement was cited as a cause for the initial failure of Republicans to pass the American Health Care Act of 2017. In 2018, the group and its volunteers contributed money, endorsement and volunteer time to many House races, helping Democrats win back control of the chamber. In 2019, the group endorsed a series of events aimed at supporting the impeachment of Donald Trump. ==See also== * Tea Party movement ==References== == Further reading == * * * * * ==External links== * Category:2016 in American politics Category:2017 in American politics Category:21st-century social movements Category:Aftermath of the 2016 United States presidential election Category:Civil liberties advocacy groups in the United States Category:History of the United States (1991\u2013present) Category:Immigration political advocacy groups in the United States Category:Left-wing populism in the United States Category:LGBT political advocacy groups in the United States Category:Liberalism in the United States Category:Political advocacy groups in the United States Category:Political terminology of the United States Category:Progressivism in the United States Category:Protests in the United States Category:Social democratic organizations in the United States ",
