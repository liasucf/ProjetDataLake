The company owns Rex Virtual Drilling, which is developed by its Swedish founders. Rex Virtual Drilling is a liquid hydrocarbon indicator that studies resonance information in seismic data to locate hydrocarbons directly. Rex International believes that Rex Virtual Drilling substantially increases the chance of success of finding oil in exploration drilling and is offering the technology as a de-risking tool to other oil exploration companies. Rex International Holding has achieved three offshore oil discoveries since its listing in July 2013; one in Oman and two in Norway. Rex International was publicly listed on 31 July 2013 and is on Singapore Exchange's secondary board, Catalist.Oil & Gas Financial Journal: Rex International Holding Launches IPO on Catalist, retrieved 10 July 2015 ==History== The Company was founded by Dr Karl Lidgren, Mr Hans Lidgen and Mr Svein Kjellesvik. The three then founded Rex Partners, whose subsidiary Rex Commercial and Schroders & Co Bank AG were the initial shareholders of Rex International Holding, a private company incorporated in Singapore on 11 January 2013. 31 July 2013: Rex International Holding was listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited\u2019s (SGX-ST) Catalist Board. It is one of the largest company listed on the Catalist Board.SGX Market Updates: Catalist Companies' Secondary Raisings via Equity Totalled S$553 million in 2014 , retrieved 28 July 2015. At listing, the Company had an initial portfolio of interest in 10 licences in the Middle East, Norway and the US. 24 October 2013: Rex International Holding signed a shareholders\u2019 agreement with Swiss from Ogsonic to set up Rexonic AG.

In its press release dated 21 January 2015, the Company said that its general criteria for investment is a potential of about 50 million barrels of oil in each concession.Offshore Energy Today: Rex looking to benefit from North Energy's drilling campaign in Norway, retrieved 14 August 2015. ===Norway=== One of the main areas of focus for the Company is Norway as it is a matured market with high activity with reputed operators, attractive fiscal policies and good quality seismic data to be analysed with Rex Virtual Drilling. A lot of Norway\u2019s oil production occurs in the North Sea and smaller amounts in the Norwegian Sea. In recent times, new exploration and production activity is occurring in the Barents Sea.EIA: Norway, retrieved 20 July 2015 ===Oman=== Oman is the largest oil producer in the Middle East that is not part of OPEC. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) Oman had 5.5 billion barrels of estimated proved oil reserves as of January 2014. Oman\u2019s 5.5 billion barrels of proved oil reserves rank seventh in the Middle East, and 23rd in the world.EIA: Oman, retrieved 20 July 2015 Located in the East of the Gulf of Masirah, Block 50 Oman is one of the first concessions secured by the founders of Rex International before IPO. The discovery is significant as it is the first offshore discovery in the area after 30 years of exploration activity.

The second exploration well that was drilled in the concession had successfully reached the well target depth of more than 3,000m into the Cambrian formation. Hydrocarbons were discovered in several formations with good oil sample extracted.Rigzone: Masirah Discovers Oil at Block 50 Offshore Oman, retrieved 24 February 2016. Block 50 Oman was one of the first concessions secured by the founders of Rex International Holding before the Company\u2019s IPO. The Company\u2019s founders were involved in Lundin Petroleum\u2019s (then known as International Petroleum Corporation (IPC)) commercial oil discovery in the Bukha field, offshore Oman in 1986. The oil discovery in Block 50 Oman in 2014 is significant as it is the first offshore discovery east of Oman, after 30 years of exploration activity in the area. The discovery won the \u2018Offshore Discovery of the Year\u2019 award, one of six awards presented in conjunction with the launch of the Oil & Gas Year Oman 2014 energy report, produced by publisher Wildcat International, in partnership with the Ministry of Oil and Gas and OPAL (Oman Society for Petroleum Services). During a 48-hour test, hydrocarbons were flowed to the surface and the well achieved light oil flow rate of up to 3,000 stock tank barrels per day (stb/d) with no water production. In March 2014, the Ministry of Oil and Gas of Oman approved Masirah\u2019s entry into the Second Phase of the Minimum Work Obligation, with the fulfilment of the commitments specified in the Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement (EPSA) for this phase. The concession is 17,000 square kilometres.Eugoss: Drilling Commences at Masirah North #1 Well in Oman Block 50, retrieved 24 February 2016 The area explored so far (where the previous two drillings were made) is only a couple of hundred square kilometres. Hence, the Company believes there to be promising remaining potential in the block. ===Norway=== On 22 December 2015, the Company announced that the drilling of exploration well, Rolvsnes, in the North Sea licence PL338C, in which Lime Petroleum Norway AS participated, has been completed as an oil discovery. A production test (DST) was performed in this close to vertical exploration well, achieving a production rate of 315 barrels of oil per day through a 36/64\" choke. The moderate flow rate seems to be caused by limited communication between the reservoir and the wellbore. A frac and injection test was carried out, giving a stable injection rate of some 6,000 barrels per day. Further studies will be done to incorporate all the findings and establish future planning. The operator Lundin gave a total gross resource estimate in the range of 12 to 46 million barrels of oil equivalentsLundin Petroleum: Oil Discovery in the Rolvsnes Prospect, offshore Norway, retrieved 28 January 2016. With the use of Rex International Holding\u2019s proprietary Rex Virtual Drilling technology, the Company identified the key risks associated with the Rolvsnes well to be the irregular porosity and permeability distributions in the unconventional weathered and fractured basement reservoir. This was also the first time that RVD was applied in this kind of rocks. Building on the thorough and innovative G&G; work by operator Lundin, Rex International Holding undertook its own independent prospect analysis. The good alignment of conventional G&G; prognoses and those of RVD, which identified this discovery, is testament to RVD\u2019s role as a powerful tool in reducing exploration risks.Rex International Holding: Oil Discovery in Rolvsnes Prospect, offshore Norway, retrieved 2 February 2016 PL338C is held by operator Lundin at 50 per cent, Lime Norway at 30 per cent and OMV (Norge) at 20 per cent.Norwegian Petroleum Directorate: Factpages, retrieved 2 February 2016 Lime Norway also has 30 per cent participation in the nearby licences PL544 and PL410, all operated by Lundin. ==References== Category:Energy companies established in 2013 Category:Companies listed on the Singapore Exchange ",
