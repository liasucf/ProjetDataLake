    "text": "Aspergillus campestris is a species of fungus in the genus Aspergillus. The species was first described in 1982.Christensen, M. 1982. The Aspergillus ochraceus group: two new species from western soils and a synoptic key. Mycologia. 74(2):210-225 It is from the Candidi section. The fungi in the Candidi section are known for their white spores. It has been shown to produce a high number of secondary metabolites. The genome of A. campestris was sequenced as a part of the Aspergillus whole-genome sequencing project - a project dedicated to performing whole-genome sequencing of all members of the genus Aspergillus.Kjaerbolling I, Vesth TC, Frisvad JC, Nybo JL, Theobald S, Kuo A, Bowyer P, Matsuda Y, Mondo S, Lyhne EK, Kogle ME, Clum A, Lipzen A, Salamov A, Ngan CY, Daum C, Chiniquy J, Barry K, LaButti K, Haridas S, Simmons BA, Magnuson JK, Mortensen UH, Larsen TO, Grigoriev IV, Baker SE, Andersen MR Linking secondary metabolites to gene clusters through genome sequencing of six diverse Aspergillus species. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Jan 23;115(4):E753-E761. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1715954115. Epub 2018 Jan 9. The genome assembly size was 28.26 Mbp. ==Growth and morphology== A. campestris has been cultivated on both Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA) plates and Malt Extract Agar Oxoid\u00ae (MEAOX) plates. The growth morphology of the colonies can be seen in the pictures below.
