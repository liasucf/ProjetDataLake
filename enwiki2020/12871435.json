    "text": "Carex sodiroi is a species of sedge known from a single collection made by Luis Sodiro at some time before 1886. It was found around from Nanegalito, and described as a new species by the sedge expert Georg K\u00fckenthal in 1904. The holotype was deposited in the Berlin herbarium, where it may have been destroyed in the Second World War; if there are no isotypes in Ecuador, then the only record of the species may be a photograph in the Field Museum in Chicago. ==References== * sodiroi Category:Flora of Ecuador Category:Data deficient plants Category:Plants described in 1904 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
