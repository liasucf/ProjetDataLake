Journal of Critical Care, Volume 14, Issue 4, Pages 177\u2013185 It can be used as an indicator of diastolic dysfunction. It can be measured by simultaneous Doppler echocardiography and M-mode sonography, or better still, by simultaneous phonocardiogram and transmitral Doppler.anaesthetist.com >Diastolic dysfunction Lara Hopley and Jo van Schalkwyk. Date of last update: 2009-06-05 Prolonged IVRT indicates poor myocardial relaxation. A normal IVRT is about 70 \u00b1 12 ms, and approximately 10 ms longer in people over forty years. In abnormal relaxation, IVRT is usually in excess of 110 ms. With restrictive ventricular filling, it is usually under 60 ms. ==See also== *Isovolumetric contraction ==References== Category:Cardiovascular physiology ",
