The band is named after Captain Ahab, a character in the 1851 novel Moby-Dick by Herman Melville.

On 15 April 2005, after several months of rehearsing, the band's first demo, The Oath, was released. The demo was limited to 30 hand-numbered copies and contained the band's first song, \"The Stream\", as well as two new songs and an outro track.
