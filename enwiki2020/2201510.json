    "text": "The Groundhogs are a British rock band founded in late 1963, that toured extensively in the 1960s, achieved prominence in the early 1970s and continued sporadically into the 21st century. Tony McPhee (guitar and vocals) is the sole constant member of the group, which has gone through many personnel changes but usually records and performs as a power trio. ==Career== The band was originally formed as The Dollar Bills in New Cross, London in 1962 by brothers Pete and John Cruickshank (born in 1943 and 1945 respectively in Calcutta, West Bengal, India). Tony McPhee (born 22 March 1944), the lead guitarist in an instrumental group called the Seneschals, joined the group later that same year. McPhee steered them towards the blues and renamed them after a John Lee Hooker song, \"Groundhog's Blues\". John Cruickshank suggested they became John Lee's Groundhogs when they backed John Lee Hooker on his 1964 UK tour: they later supplemented Little Walter, Jimmy Reed and Champion Jack Dupree when they toured the UK. McPhee featured on Dupree's From New Orleans to Chicago (1966) alongside Eric Clapton. The Groundhogs issued \"Shake It\" b/w \"Rock Me\" on the Interphon record label in January 1965. Their line-up on their first album, Scratchin' the Surface, (produced by the 19-year-old Head Of A&R; for Liberty Records, Mike Batt) released in November 1968, consisted of McPhee as singer and guitarist; bassist Peter Cruickshank (born 2 July 1945, in Calcutta), Ken Pustelnik on drums (born 13 March 1946 on a farm near Blairgowrie, Angus, Scotland) and Steve Rye on harmonica (born 8 March 1946 in London \u2013 died 19 July 1992, in London). In 1969, the single \"B.D.D.\" (Blind Deaf Dumb) flopped in the UK but hit number one in Lebanon. The group's album releases Blues Obituary (September 1969); Thank Christ for the Bomb (May 1970); Split (March 1971); and Who Will Save the World? The Mighty Groundhogs (March 1972), recorded as a trio without Rye, all but Blues Obituary the Top 10 in the UK Albums Chart. Split reached number 5, spending 27 weeks in the UK Albums Chart and achieved gold record status, while a single release from the album, \"Cherry Red\", was featured on BBC Television's Top of the Pops programme on 22 April 1971. They supported The Rolling Stones on their 1971 British tour at the request of Mick Jagger and released an album of their live set on the Stones tour, recorded at Leeds University and called Live at Leeds. All these albums and live shows were performed by the classic power trio of Cruickshank, McPhee and Pustelnik. 1974's album Solid saw a last return to the charts. After breaking up in 1974, they returned in 1975 with a different line-up. Two albums, Crosscut Saw and Black Diamond, were released in 1976. At times in the 1990s, McPhee alternated two line-ups. After years of performing and recording for a loyal following, original manager Roy Fisher put together a short-lived 'original line-up' to celebrate their fortieth anniversary. McPhee left the band again to pursue an acoustic career, leaving Cruickshank and Pustelnik to continue, subsequently forming 'The Groundhogs Rhythm Section' with invited frontmen, latterly with Eddie Martin, while McPhee embarked on a major tour in 2004 with Edgar Winter and Alvin Lee and issued an acoustic blues album Blues at Ten. McPhee put together a new band in 2007, with long-time Groundhogs bassist Dave Anderson (ex-Hawkwind) and Marco Anderson on drums. This trio toured the UK in 2008 with Focus and Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash. The 2009 line-up of Tony McPhee's Groundhogs comprised McPhee, Anderson and previous long-term drummer Mick Jones. The Groundhogs Rhythm Section's latest recruits, Bob Bowles (guitar, vocals) and Jon Buckett (guitars, keyboards, vocals), joined Ken Pustelnik and Pete Cruickshank in February 2011. As of 2011, the new Groundhogs' lineup consisted of McPhee, Anderson, Joanna Deacon (vocals), and Carl Stokes (drums) from the death rock band 'Cancer'. Due to McPhee's ongoing health issues relating to a stroke in 2009, Tony McPhee & The Groundhogs retired in January 2014; although Tony McPhee and Carl Stokes have since worked with David Tibet's Current 93. ==Personnel== ===Members=== ;Current members * Joanna Deacon \u2013 vocals (2001\u20132003, 2011\u2013present) * Tony McPhee \u2013 guitars, vocals (1963\u20131974, 1976, 1982\u20132004, 2007\u2013present) * Dave Anderson \u2013 bass (1987\u20131988, 2001\u20132003, 2007\u2013present) * Carl Stokes \u2013 drums (2011\u2013present) ;Former members * Peter Cruickshank \u2013 bass (1963\u20131974, 2003\u20132004) * Dave Boorman \u2013 drums (1963\u20131965) * Bob Hall \u2013 keyboards (1963\u20131965) * John Cruickshank \u2013 harmonica, vocals (1963\u20131964) * Ken Pustelnik \u2013 drums (1965\u20131972, 2003\u20132004) * Tom Parker \u2013 keyboards (1965) * Steve Rye \u2013 harmonica (1969; died 1992) * Clive Brooks \u2013 drums (1972\u20131974; died 2017) * Dave Thompson \u2013 bass (1972) * Mick Cook \u2013 drums (1976; died 1997) * Martin Kent \u2013 bass (1976) * Dave Wellbelove \u2013 guitars (1976) * Rick Adams \u2013 guitars (1976) * Alan Fish \u2013 bass (1982\u20131994) * Wilgar Campbell \u2013 drums (1982\u20131984; died 1989) * \"Mighty\" Joe Young \u2013 guitars (1982\u20131983) * Mick Kirkton \u2013 drums (1984\u20131989) * Mick Jones \u2013 drums (1989\u20131994, 2000\u20132003, 2009\u20132011) *Chris Bennett \u2013 drums (1990\u20131991) * Jon Camp \u2013 bass (1989, 2001) * Eric Chipulina \u2013 bass, live guitars (1994\u20131996, 1996\u20132000) * Pete Correa \u2013 drums (1994\u20131996, 1996\u20132000) * Pete Chymon \u2013 bass (1996) * Dale Iviss \u2013 drums (1996) * Brian Jones \u2013 bass (2000\u20132001) * Marco Anderson \u2013 drums (2007\u20132009) ===Lineups=== {| class=\"toccolours\" border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 style=\"float: width: 375px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #E2E2E2;\" width=99% |- !
