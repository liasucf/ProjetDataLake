He went undrafted in the 2014 NFL Draft, but was signed as a free agent by the Baltimore Ravens on May 12, 2014. Leone competed with Sam Koch for the punter position in training camp, and played in three preseason games. He was waived on August 25 before the beginning of the regular season. === BC Lions === Leone was signed by the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL) on October 20, 2014 to their practice roster, but left the team a month later. === Pittsburgh Steelers === On January 27, 2015, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed Leone to challenge Brad Wing for the starting punter position, but he was released in May. === BC Lions (second stint) === Leone returned to the BC Lions (CFL) before their training camp as the Lions reportedly searched for a single player to handle punting, kickoffs, and kicking. Leone remained on the active roster after the preseason as he fulfilled all three kicking duties. He made his CFL debut against the Ottawa Redblacks on July 4, 2015, where he scored two field goals from 11 and 13 yards as well as an extra point. The following game, on July 10, Leone kicked a 56-yard field goal, setting a BC Lions record for longest field goal and tying the game against the Saskatchewan Roughriders 29\u201329 with 31 seconds remaining; a game which the Lions won in overtime.

He began his season with 13 consecutive made field goals before missing a 46-yard kick on August 6 in a game against the Edmonton Eskimos. Leone was named a CFL All-Star as a punter in both the 2015 and 2016 season. Following the 2016 season Leone was granted a release by the Lions so he could sign with an NFL team. ===Arizona Cardinals=== On January 5, 2017, Leone signed a reserve/future contract with the Arizona Cardinals. He was waived on September 2, 2017. ===Ottawa Redblacks=== On April 10, 2018, he was signed by the Ottawa Redblacks. He was named an East Division All-Star as a punter at season's end.
