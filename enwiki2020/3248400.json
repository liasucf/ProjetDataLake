    "text": "The Kansas\u2013Kansas State football rivalry is an American college football rivalry between the Kansas Jayhawks football team of the University of Kansas and Kansas State Wildcats football team of Kansas State University, contested since 1902, making it one of the longest running rivalry games in college football, with 117 match-ups as of 2019. The Governor's Cup is the trophy awarded to the winner of the game. It has been awarded every year since 1969. The rivalry is known as the Sunflower Showdown. Kansas leads the overall series 64\u201348\u20135, including KU's forfeit of the 1980 game imposed by the Big Eight Conference (Kansas disputes the forfeit). Kansas State leads the Governor's Cup series (since 1969) 31\u201319\u20131. The most recent game, played on November 2, 2019, was won by Kansas State 38\u201310. Despite Kansas State\u2019s dominance in the last 31 games, 23\u20138 in favor of Kansas State, Kansas still maintains an 16 game lead in the series due to their 56\u201325\u20135 record in the first 86 games of the series. ==History== The KSU Marching Band performs at halftime of the Sunflower Showdown in Lawrence in 2008 The two teams had a very long history prior to the inauguration of the Governor's Cup: they began play in 1902 and have faced each other every season since 1911, making this the sixth-longest continuous series in college football history. With 117 games played, it is also the 2nd-longest rivalry between two public universities in the same state featuring the names \"University of _ v. _ State University\" (behind Oregon v. Oregon State). The University of Kansas built a large advantage in the series by 1923 (17\u20131\u20133), but the series has subsequently been much more even, with the series tied 47\u201347\u20132 since that time. The two schools disagree on the overall series record, though both agree Kansas leads the series. The difference arises from the 1980 game, which KU won 20\u201318 on the field. However, the Big Eight Conference ordered KU to forfeit the game after a player was ruled ineligible. As a result, KU claims to lead the overall series 65\u201347\u20135, while Kansas State reports that KU leads 64\u201348\u20135. Kansas cites NCAA policy to explain its refusal to reckon the 1980 game as a Kansas State win; the policy states that NCAA schools must acknowledge forfeits imposed by the NCAA or those dictated by the rules of the game, without specifically referencing conference-imposed penalties. ===Trophies presented to the winner=== The Governor's Cup is the third trophy associated with the rivalry. In 1902, in the first match-up, a \"Governor's Trophy\" was given to the winning team. Then, beginning in the 1940 football season, the winner of the KU-KSU contest received the \"Peace Pact Trophy\", which was miniature bronze goalposts. The trophy was intended to keep the winning team's student body from tearing down the loser's goalposts. However, as years went by, these trophies were forgotten. ==Series overview== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Statistic !Kansas !Kansas State |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Games played || colspan=2|117 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Wins || style=\"\"|64 || |48 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Ties || colspan=2|5 (1916, '22, '23, '66, '87) |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Disputed || colspan=2|1 (1980) |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Home wins || style=\"\"|37 || |26 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Road wins || style=\"\"|27 || |22 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Neutral site wins || |\u2014 || |\u2014 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Total points scored in the series || style=\"\"|2070 || |1866 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Most points scored in a game by one team || |55 (1947) || style=\"\"|64 (2002) |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Most points scored in a game by both teams || colspan=2|80 (2011 \u2013 KSU 59, KU 21) |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Fewest points scored in a game by both teams || colspan=2|0 (1916, 1923) |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Fewest points scored in a game by one team in a win || style=\"\"|5 (1909) || |6 (4 times) |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Most points scored in a game by one team in a loss || |22 (1969) || style=\"\"|29 (1968) |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Largest margin of victory || |55 (1947) || style=\"\"|64 (2002) |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Smallest margin of victory || |1 (1967) || |1 (1972) |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Longest winning streak || |10 (1956\u201365) || style=\"\"|11 (2009\u2013present; 1993\u20132003) |- |} ==Notable games== ===1910: The cancelled game=== Kansas and Kansas State have played each other in football every year since 1902, except for 1910. The 1910 game was cancelled after the two teams were unable to agree to eligibility rules for the contest. KU coach A. R. Kennedy tried to compel Kansas State to play the game by publishing provocative comments in the Lawrence newspaper in May 1910, but Kansas State coach Mike Ahearn refused to change his school's rules. ===1927\u20131933: Road wins=== For seven straight years, from 1927 to 1933, the two teams alternated wins, with the visiting team winning every game in contrast to the usual home field advantage in sports. In the six games from 1928 to 1933, every game was also won by shutout. ===1969: First Governor's Cup game=== Kansas State won the first contest in the Governor's Cup series 26\u201322 on October 11, 1969, in Lawrence, Kansas. The game was a classic in the series, contested by two high- quality teams. Kansas was coming off an appearance in the Orange Bowl the previous season, led by future Pro Football Hall of Fame running back John Riggins, while Kansas State in 1969 was an offensive juggernaut led by quarterback Lynn Dickey and running back Mack Herron. The game was not decided until the final play, when two K-State defenders jarred the ball loose from a KU receiver in the end zone. The loss sent KU's season into an irreversible tailspin, and the Jayhawks, suffering greatly from the loss of Bobby Douglass and John Zook to the NFL, finished the season 1\u20139 despite Riggins' brilliance, culminating with a 69-21 loss to Big Eight Conference champion Missouri at home. Following the game, Kansas State fans tore down the goalposts in KU's stadium \u2013 an act with a long history in the rivalry, and that K-State fans would repeat in 1994 after ending an 11-game losing streak in Lawrence. === 1980: The forfeit === On November 1, 1980, Kansas defeated Kansas State 20\u201318 in Manhattan, Kansas to take a 9\u20133 lead in the first dozen years the Governor's Cup was awarded. However, it was later determined that Kerwin Bell, a running back for Kansas in that game, was a partial qualifier despite his high school transcripts indicating otherwise and he was ruled academically ineligible at the time of the 1980 season. In 1982 the Big Eight Conference ordered Kansas to forfeit three conference wins and one tie from the 1980 season, including its victory in the 1980 Governor's Cup game. As a result, the two schools now dispute the overall record in both the Sunflower Showdown and more recent Governor's Cup series, with each school claiming victory in the 1980 game. === 1987: The Toilet Bowl === The lone tie during the Governor's Cup era took place on November 7, 1987, in Manhattan, and is the most infamous game in the history of the series. Termed \"The Toilet Bowl\" and \"The Futility Bowl\" by national commentators, the game featured 1\u20137 KU and 0\u20138 K-State. The contest lived down to expectations and resulted in a 17\u201317 tie, which was secured when Kansas blocked a field goal at the end of the game. Following the tie, both teams lost their last two games of the season. KU coach Bob Valesente was fired following the season. His counterpart Stan Parrish kept his job, but did not make it past 1988 after the Wildcats posted an 0\u201311 campaign to extend a winless streak to 28 games. Parrish's dismissal led to the hiring of Bill Snyder, who would shift the direction of the series in favor of the Wildcats. === 1995: Two ranked teams === The only match-up in history of the rivalry while both teams were ranked occurred on October 28, 1995, in Manhattan. The University of Kansas came into the game 7\u20130 and ranked #6 in the AP Poll, while Kansas State University was 5\u20131 and ranked #14. Both teams would finish the season ranked in the top ten, but this day belonged to Kansas State. KSU started strong and maintained the advantage throughout for a decisive 41\u20137 victory. === 2004: Streak buster === An 11-year winning streak by Kansas State that began in 1993 \u2013 the longest by either team in the series \u2013 was broken on October 9, 2004, when KU won a back-and-forth 31\u201328 thriller in Lawrence. The head coach of the Jayhawks was Mark Mangino, a former Wildcat assistant under KSU coach Bill Snyder. Mangino bested his mentor in Snyder's final visit to Memorial Stadium during Snyder's first term as KSU coach. === 2007: Kansas wins in Manhattan === In 2007, KU won in Manhattan for the first time since 1989 and also posted its only victory ever over a ranked KSU team. Kansas entered the game 4\u20130 while Kansas State had a 3\u20131 record, but KSU was favored in the contest and ranked 24th in the AP Poll. Kansas overcame several mistakes through the course of the first half, tying the contest 14\u201314 at halftime. Following a strong second-half performance by KU, the visitors from Lawrence posted a 30\u201324 victory. Kansas went on to build an 11\u20130 record on the season before losing a game, and secured an at-large bid to the 2008 Orange Bowl. === 2010: A century straight === For the 100th consecutive autumn, KU and KSU faced each other on the football field on October 14, 2010, in Lawrence. This was only the seventh college football rivalry in history played for a century straight. The game was the second since Bill Snyder returned to coach KSU and was reminiscent of earlier blowout Wildcat victories during Snyder's first tenure, with KSU claiming a 59\u20137 victory over KU. The 2010 victory by Kansas State was the second win in an active eleven-game KSU winning streak over KU (tied for the longest winning streak in series history). ==Most recent game== Kansas State defeated Kansas 38\u201310 in Lawrence on November 2, 2019 in a matchup of first-year coaches Chris Klieman (Kansas State) and Les Miles (Kansas). ==Game results== ==See also== * List of NCAA college football rivalry games * List of most-played college football series in NCAA Division I * Aggieville Riots ==Notes== ==References== Category:College football rivalries in the United States Category:Kansas Jayhawks football Category:Kansas State Wildcats football Category:1902 establishments in Kansas ",
