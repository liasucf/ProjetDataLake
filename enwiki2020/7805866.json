The cumulative total passed \u00a31 billion in March 2012. The cumulative total passed \u00a34 billion in June 2016. == Fees == JustGiving charged a 5% fee on donations to cover the cost of running the business until March 2019, when the fee was made voluntary. == Notable fundraisers == In 2010 Charlie Simpson, aged 7, raised over \u00a3210,000 (\u00a3145,000 in the first 48 hours) via his JustGiving page for the 2010 Haiti earthquake relief programme by UNICEF.
