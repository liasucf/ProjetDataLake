    "text": "Stephanie Deste was born in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium on 22 January 1901, as Stephanie Dietz, and she died in Melbourne, Australia on 14 April 1996, having arrived in Australia in 1926. At least as early as 1934, Deste was well known as one of Melbourne's eccentrics with examples of her eccentricity being noted right up to her death in 1996. ==Family== In March 1931 in London, Deste married Remigio Budica, a former opera baritone, whom she had met in Melbourne. They had one daughter, Toti. Budica died in 1944, at the age of 45.https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/remigio-budica- birth-1899-death-1944-australia/143843008 ==Careers== ===Actor and dancer=== Born into a musical family, she trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, London, but she commenced her dramatic career in the United States, where she had some small roles in silent films with Douglas Fairbanks. She also appeared in stage productions with the likes of Tyrone Power Sr. and John Barrymore. In Australia, she first gained public attention as an actor and dancer, particularly through the original 1926 Melbourne production of Rose-Marie. She also appeared in many other J C Williamson's productions throughout Australia. Stephanie Deste was well known for attending most first nights at all Melbourne live theatres. Barry Humphries claims that Deste was one of the inspirations behind his most famous character Dame Edna Everage. This particularly applies to Dame Edna's flamboyant spectacle frames.https://www.facebook.com/1004466366276937/photos/a.1011242952265945/1541543699235865/?type=3&theater;https://www.smh.com.au/national/comic- genius-barry-humphries-20110614-1g1wg.html Perhaps only one photo of Deste wearing pretentious glasses is known to exist in the public domain.https://twitter.com/SKKArchive/status/1290565263759294464/photo/1 Robert Helpmann also cites Deste as one of the influences over his dancing and acting career. ===Beautician=== She owned beauty salons (ladies' hairdressing establishments) in the Melbourne Central Business District, the first being opened in 1938 on the corner of Elizabeth and Collins Streets. Originally, known as Make Ups Pty Ltd, the business name was later changed to Stephanie Deste Pty Ltd. Her initial partner in the business was Doris Rourke, with whom Deste had a major dispute that ended up in court later in 1938. Rourke claimed that Deste was breaking their agreement by spending too much time on theatrical and broadcasting matters. Deste was also accused of rudeness. Mr Justice Lowe agreed with most of what Deste wanted. ===Radio broadcaster=== Just after arriving in Australia in the late 1920s, Deste broadcast Bible stories, and appeared in broadcast plays on the Australian Broadcasting Company, predecessor of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.Wireless Weekly magazine, 29 July 1927Wireless Weekly magazine, 4 January 1929; on-line edition - https://www.americanradiohistory.com/AUSTRALIA/Archive-Wireless- Weekly-AU/1929/Wireless-Weekly-1929-01-04.pdf Her many quirks were particularly noted in her unusual radio style, which were highlighted when she recommenced broadcasting on 3UZ just after World War II, presenting beauty hints and live advertisements for her beauty salons during the morning women's programs. In the late 1940s, Deste transferred to 3DB where she continued to broadcast until the early 1960s. As well as regular appearances in the morning programs, as from February 1954 she presented a half-hour program, Sunday Night with Stephanie Deste at 10.30 pm on a Sunday night.various newspaper radio program guides in the collection of Albert Isaacs, Melbourne The program was sponsored by the Stephie Deste Pty Ltd beauty salons. It is believed that this time-slot was the cheapest offered by 3DB at the time.As from 1 February 1954, 3DB began broadcasting 24 hours per day. Prior to this, the station had closed at 10.30 pm on Sundays. 24 hour broadcasting at 3DB only lasted for a few months, and after this 3DB began closing at 1.00 am every morning. Every evening, a two-hour program called \"The Dunlop Hours, Eleven 'til One\" was broadcast after 11.00 pm. This meant that as from 1 February 1954, there was a half-hour gap in programming after 10.30 pm on Sundays, which is why Stephanie Deste was able to get this time-slot at very cheap rates. For more information on 3DB's broadcasting hours, go to 3DB and scroll down to 2.1 On air times. The program mainly consisted of interviews with show business personalities, both locals but, particularly, with artistes visiting from overseas. However, this eccentric program was usually more about Deste than about the people she was interviewing. Despite its late time-slot, Sunday Night with Stephanie Deste was popular with show-biz aficionados. ==Tribute== In 2013, Deste's grandson Marcus Encel produced a Loloclip video of just under three minutes about his grandmother.https://www.loloclip.com/marcus- encel/7XArA1GdGTAwAG3CA6A5SW.html ==References== Category:1901 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Australian stage actresses Category:Australian film actresses Category:Australian silent film actresses Category:Australian female dancers Category:Beauticians Category:Hairdressers Category:Women in radio Category:People from Li\u00e8ge Category:Belgian emigrants to Australia Category:Radio personalities from Melbourne ",
