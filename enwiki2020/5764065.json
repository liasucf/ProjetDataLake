    "text": "A winning streak, a.k.a. a win streak or hot streak, is an uninterrupted sequence of success in games or competitions, commonly measured by wins that are uninterrupted by losses or ties/draws. In sports, it can be applied to teams, and individuals. In sports where teams or individuals represent groups such as countries or regions, those groups can also be said to have 'winning streaks' if their representatives win consecutive games or competitions, even if the competitors are different. Streaks can also be applied to specific competitions: for example a competitor who wins an event in three consecutive Olympic Games has an Olympic winning streak, even if they have lost other competitions during the period. ==Longest streaks== The longest (in terms of time) recorded winning streak in any professional sports is Spain's Antoni Bou having won 26 consecutive world championships in Motorcycle Trials between 2007 and today, he is still active in the sport. Pakistan's Jahangir Khan's 555 consecutive wins in squash from 1981 to 1986 is also of significant note. In 2013, the Dutch wheelchair tennis player Esther Vergeer retired with an active 10-year-long winning streak of 470 matches, including a streak of 250 consecutive sets won.Ben Rothenberg, Unbeaten Since 2003, Wheelchair Champ Retires, New York Times, February 12, 2013 ==Air sports== ===Aerobatic=== ====Team==== 3 consecutive titles at FAI World Aerobatic Championships \u2013 Russia * Streak started 2001 Burgos, Spain * Streak ended 2007 Burgos, Spain ==Aquatic sports== ===Diving=== ====Olympics==== =====Men's===== ======10m Platform====== 3 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games \u2013 Klaus Dibiasi * Streak started 1968 Mexico City, Mexico * Streak ended 1980 Moscow, Soviet Union 7 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games \u2013 United States * Streak started 1920 Antwerp, Belgium * Streak ended 1956 Melbourne, Australia ======3m Springboard====== 11 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games \u2013 United States * Streak started 1920 Antwerp, Belgium * Streak ended 1972 Munich, West Germany ======Synchronized 10m Platform====== 3 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games \u2013 China * Streak started 2004 Athens, Greece =====Women's===== ======10m Platform====== 7 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games \u2013 United States * Streak started 1924 Paris, France * Streak ended 1960 Rome, Italy ======3m Springboard====== 8 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games \u2013 United States * Streak started 1920 Antwerp, Belgium * Streak ended 1960 Rome, Italy ======Synchronized 10m Platform====== 4 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games \u2013 China * Streak started 2000 Sydney, Australia ======Synchronized 3m Springboard====== 3 consecutive gold medals at Olympic Games \u2013 China * Streak started 2004 Athens, Greece ====World Championships==== =====Men's===== ======1m Springboard====== 5 consecutive gold medals at World Championships \u2013 China * Streak started 2007 Melbourne, Australia ======3m Springboard====== 3 consecutive gold medals at World Championships * Phil Boggs ** Streak started 1973 Belgrade, Yugoslavia ** Streak ended 1982 Guayaquil, Ecuador * He Chong ** Streak started 2009 Rome, Italy ** Streak ended 2015 Kazan, Russia 7 consecutive gold medals at World Championships \u2013 China * Streak started 2007 Melbourne, Australia ======10m Platform====== 3 consecutive gold medals at World Championships *Greg Louganis ** Streak started 1978 West Berlin ** Streak ended 1991 Perth, Australia *Qiu Bo ** Streak started 2011 Shanghai, China ** Streak ended 2017 Budapest, Hungary ======Synchronized 3m Springboard====== 5 consecutive gold medals at World Championships \u2013 China * Streak started 2005 Montreal, Canada ======Synchronized 10m Platform====== 3 consecutive gold medals at World Championships \u2013 United States * Streak started 2007 Melbourne, Australia * Streak ended 2013 Barcelona, Spain =====Women's===== ======3m Springboard====== 5 consecutive gold medals at World Championships \u2013 Guo Jingjing * Streak started 2001 Fukuoka, Japan * Streak ended 2011 Shanghai, China 7 consecutive gold medals at World Championships \u2013 China * Streak started 2001 Fukuoka, Japan ======10m Platform====== 3 consecutive gold medals at World Championships \u2013 China * Streak started 1986 Madrid, Spain * Streak ended 1998 Perth, Australia ======Synchronized 3m Springboard====== 7 consecutive titles at World Championships \u2013 China * Streak started 2001 Fukuoka, Japan ======Synchronized 10m Platform====== 7 consecutive titles at World Championships \u2013 China * Streak started 2001 Fukuoka, Japan ===Swimming=== ====Overall==== =====Johnny Weissmuller===== Weissmuller never lost a swimming race during his entire amateur career, including three individual Olympic gold medals.

The primary schedule overhaul eliminated midweek races, thus cutting the schedule from 48 to around 30 races (36 currently), and a minimum race distance (first , later shortened to ). Since many pre-1972 races were under 100 miles (such as 62.5 mile races held in Islip, New York, and the current non-championship Budweiser Duel then being a championship race at 100 miles until 1967), some NASCAR records are differentiated that way, similar to the NBA differentiating \"fewest points\" records with pre and post-1954 records, when the 24-second shot clock was introduced. ;Post\u20131972 4 wins (tie) (length of shortest race, in miles, in brackets): * 1976 Cale Yarborough (216.8) * 1981 Darrell Waltrip (250) * 1987 Dale Earnhardt (250) * 1991 Harry Gant (250) * 1992 Bill Elliott (300) * 1993 Mark Martin (220.5) * 1998 Jeff Gordon (220.5) * 2007 Jimmie Johnson (263) Note: In seven of the eight instances, at least one of the wins was in a 500-mile race. Mark Martin's 1993 streak ended at Darlington, where the Mountain Dew Southern 500 was stopped 16 laps early because of darkness. ==Basketball== ===FIBA=== * United States men's national basketball team: 58 games from the 1992 Olympic Games to the 2002 FIBA World Championship.Argentina defeats NBA-laden Team USA - USA Today, 4 September 2002 ===Olympics=== 64 games \u2013 1936\u20131972 United States * Streak started August 7, 1936 (defeated Spain, forfeit) * Streak ended September 9, 1972 (defeated by Soviet Union, 51-50) 7 Consecutive Men's titles at Olympic Games \u2013 United States * Streak started 1936 Berlin, Germany * Streak ended 1972 Munich, West Germany 6 Consecutive Women's titles at Olympic Games \u2013 United States * Streak started 1996 Atlanta, United States ===NBA=== 33 games \u2013 1971\u201372 Los Angeles Lakers * Streak started November 5, 1971 (defeated Baltimore Bullets, 110\u2013106) * Streak ended January 9, 1972 (defeated by Milwaukee Bucks, 104\u2013120) ===College (United States)=== ==== NCAA Women's Division I ==== ===== All games ===== 111 games \u2013 UConn * Started November 23, 2014 (defeated Creighton 96\u201360) * Ended March 31, 2017 (defeated by Mississippi State 66\u201364) Note: The Wayland Baptist College women's basketball team achieved a winning streak of 131 games which started November 7, 1953 and ended March 20, 1958 (defeated 46\u201342 by Nashville Business School).

The day after winning his final championship he boarded a 747 and returned to America. He never played again. In seven years in Australia he never missed a game, hit .545 and was clutch when his team needed him the most. He often got the big hit when his team was down, he was an RBI machine. He will forever be known as Mr Baseball in Australia. Davis attributed his success to always going to the batting cages every single day and hitting 100 pitches. =====World Baseball Classic===== 2 consecutive titles \u2013 Japan =====World Cup===== 9 consecutive titles \u2013 Cuba * Streak started 1984 Havana, Cuba * Streak ended 2007 Taipei, Taiwan ====Major League Baseball==== =====By a team===== 26 games \u2013 New York Giants * Streak started September 7, 1916 (defeated Brooklyn Dodgers, 4\u20131) * Streak ended September 30, 1916 (defeated by Boston Braves, 3\u20138) Note: The Giants tied the Pirates in the second game of a doubleheader 1\u20131 on September 18, 1916.
