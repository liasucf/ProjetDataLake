His young apprentice, Mouse, still wavering between an allegiance to black or white magic, returns after a long quest, but finds his master dead and their house destroyed. Enraged but saddened, Mouse is arrested by the Duke and his followers. Fortunately, he escapes by invoking a spell which confuses any followers. He also casts a spell on the Duke that will slowly kill him. Badly wounded, Mouse is discovered by Ivrian, the Duke's daughter, who has also been secretly studying with Glavas Rho. He blames her for betraying him and Glavas Rho. Suddenly, they're both captured by Janarrl, who has Mouse tortured inside the farthest dungeon of his castle. Using the blackest of black magic, in the knowledge that it may rebound on him, Mouse manages to aim a spell at the Duke, using Ivrian as a focus. The Duke dies, his followers flee, and the couple quickly escape into the night. == References == Category:1962 short stories Category:Fantasy short stories Category:American novellas Category:Short stories by Fritz Leiber Category:Nehwon ",
