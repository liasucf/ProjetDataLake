The project was removed by Github who claimed it violated community guidelines and information about the project removed from Twitter and Medium. This prompted WikiLeaks to post a mirror. Experts stated the project was not illegal as all information was already publicly available. == References == == External links == *Official website Category:Living people Category:21st-century American artists Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:New York University alumni Category:1981 births ",
