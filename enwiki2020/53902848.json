    "text": "Marcus Arruntius Aquila was a Roman senator who flourished during the Flavian dynasty. Although he was a suffect consul for the nundinium of September- October 77 with Gaius Catellius Celer, Ronald Syme notes that like the other consuls who came from Patavium (modern Padua), Aquila \"failed to play a role in political life.\"Syme, \"Eight Consuls from Patavium\", Papers of the British School at Rome, 51 (1983), p. 118 His father was Marcus Arruntius Aquila, suffect consul in 66. Either the elder Aquila had his son at a relatively early point in his life, or he acceded to the consulship late in life.Syme, \"Eight consuls\", p. 113 A surviving inscription provides an outline of his career.ILS 980 Despite an auspicious start being selected as one of the tresviri monetales for his term in the vigintiviri, and serving his quaestorship in attendance to an unnamed emperor (likely Nero whose name was commonly omitted from inscriptions due to damnatio memoriae), except for his suffect consulship, Aquila's only other recorded achievement was becoming a member of the Quindecimviri sacris faciundis, one of the more prestigious collegia of Roman priesthoods. Syme notes, \"That college tended to annex senators of cultivated tastes.\" == References == Category:People from Padua Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:1st-century Romans Aquila, Marcus Arruntius 77 ",
