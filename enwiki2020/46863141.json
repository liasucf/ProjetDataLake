The race started in Ghent and finished in Gentbrugge, over a 268 km course. The race was considered one of the weakest editions of the Tour of Flanders ever, causing organizers to restyle the route in subsequent years.Vanwalleghem, Rik (1991), De Ronde van Vlaanderen, Pinguin, Belgium, , p164 ==Course== Eddy Merckx tried to break clear on the Kwaremont and the Muur, but was unable to make a decisive move. At 15 km from the finish, a group of 15 relative outsiders was formed. Evert Dolman, practically unknown, made an ultimate attack and finished two seconds ahead of the group. Frans Kerremans won the sprint for second place ahead of Cyrille Guimard.Vanwalleghem, Rik (1991), De Ronde van Vlaanderen, Pinguin, Belgium, , p164 ==Climbs== There were eight categorized climbs: {| width=50% | valign=top align=left width=50% | * Kwaremont * Kruisberg * Edelareberg * | valign=top align=left width=50% | * Muur * Bosberg * Valkenberg * Berg Hostellerie |} ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccccff;\" ! !Cyclist !Team !Time |- |1 | | Bic | align=right| 6h 12' |- |2 | | Hertekamp - Magniflex - Novy | align=right| + 2\" |- |3 | | Fagor - Mercier - Hutchinson | align=right| s.t. |- |4 | | Molteni | align=right| s.t. |- |5 | | Molteni | align=right| s.t. |- |6 | | Bic | align=right| s.t. |- |7 | | Goudsmit-Hoff | align=right| s.t. |- |8 | | Salvarani | align=right| s.t. |- |9 | | Dreher | align=right| s.t. |- |10 | | Goldor | align=right| s.t. |} ==References== Category:Tour of Flanders Tour of Flanders Tour of Flanders Category:1971 Super Prestige Pernod ",
