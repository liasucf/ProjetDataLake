    "text": "Stay on My Side Tonight is a five-track EP released by Jimmy Eat World through downloads on September 13, 2005 and physically released on October 4, 2005. It consists of 3 unreleased songs, a cover of the Heatmiser song \"Half Right\", and a remix of the Futures track \"Drugs or Me\". The title of the album is taken from a line in the song \"Disintegration\", the EP's opening track. The song features uncharacteristically negative lyrics, and harmonized vocals during the chorus. At 7:44, it is the band's second longest song, the first being \"Goodbye Sky Harbor\", the closing track on Clarity (16:15). This is Jimmy Eat World's only release to feature the Parental Advisory label. ==Track listing== All songs written by Jimmy Eat World, except where noted. #\"Disintegration\" \u2013 7:44 #\"Over\" \u2013 3:46 #\"Closer\" \u2013 5:50 #\"Half Right\" (Heatmiser cover) \u2013 4:42 #\"Drugs or Me\" (Styrofoam remix) \u2013 5:14 ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2005) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 74 |- |} ==References== ==External links== *Stay on My Side Tonight at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed) Category:2005 EPs Category:Jimmy Eat World EPs Category:Interscope Records EPs Category:Albums produced by Gil Norton ",
