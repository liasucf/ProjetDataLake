In 1996 he returned to Poland and settled in Krak\u00f3w. In 2008 he moved back to France.Krystyna D\u0105browska, S\u0142awomir Mro\u017cek. Culture.pl, September 2009. He died in Nice at the age of 83. Mro\u017cek joined the Polish United Workers' Party during the reign of Stalinism in the People's Republic of Poland, and made a living as a political journalist. He began writing plays in the late 1950s. His theatrical works belong to the genre of absurdist fiction, intended to shock the audience with non-realistic elements, political and historic references, distortion, and parody. ==Postwar period== Mro\u017cek's family lived in Krak\u00f3w during World War II. He finished high school in 1949 and in 1950 debuted as a political hack-writer on Przekr\u00f3j. In 1952 he moved into the government-run Writer's House (ZLP headquarters with the restricted canteen). In 1953, during the Stalinist terror in postwar Poland, Mro\u017cek was one of several signatories of an open letter from ZLP to Polish authorities supporting the persecution of Polish religious leaders imprisoned by the Ministry of Public Security. He participated in the defamation of Catholic priests from Krak\u00f3w, three of whom were condemned to death by the Communist government in February 1953 after being groundlessly accused of treason (see the Stalinist show trial of the Krak\u00f3w Curia). Their death sentences were not enforced, although Father J\u00f3zef Fudali died in unexplained circumstances while in prison.. Institute of National Remembrance.

In 1963 Mro\u017cek travelled to Italy with his wife and decided to defect together. After five years in Italy, he moved to France and in 1978 received French citizenship. After his defection, Mro\u017cek turned critical of the Polish communist regime. Later, from the safety of his residence in France, he also protested publicly against the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Long after the collapse of the Soviet empire, he commented thus on his fascination with Communism: His first wife, Maria Obremba, died in 1969. In 1987 he married Susana Osorio-Mrozek, a Mexican woman. In 1996, he relocated back to Poland and settled in Krak\u00f3w. He had a stroke in 2002, resulting in aphasia, which took several years to cure. He left Poland again in 2008, and moved to Nice in southern France. S\u0142awomir Mro\u017cek died in Nice on 15 August 2013. Not a religious person by any means, on 17 September 2013 he was buried at the St. Peter and Paul Church in Krak\u00f3w.

His first full-length play, Tango (1965) written about totalitarianism in the style of Theatre of the Absurd, made him, according to Krystyna D\u0105browska, one of the most recognizable Polish contemporary dramatists in the world. It became also Mro\u017cek's most successful play, according to Britannica, produced in many Western countries. In 1975 his second popular play Emigranci (The \u00c9migr\u00e9s),August Grodzicki, \"Bardzo polska tragikomedia.\" \u017bycie Warszawy nr 5; 7 Jan 1976 a bitter and ironic portrait of two Polish emigrants in Paris, was produced by director Andrzej Wajda at the Teatr Stary in Krak\u00f3w. S\u0142awomir Mro\u017cek literary evening in the Polish Institute, 27 February 2007, Lengyel Int\u00e9zet, Budapest. Mro\u017cek traveled to France, England, Italy, Yugoslavia and other European countries. After the military crackdown of 1981 Mro\u017cek wrote the only play he ever regretted writing, called Alfa, about the imprisoned Solidarity leader Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa who became President of Poland after the collapse of the Soviet empire. See also \"fa\u0142szywka\". After the introduction of martial law in Poland, productions of Alfa were banned, along with two of Mro\u017cek's other plays, The Ambassador and Vatzlav. The later play, in Gda\u0144sk, in the city known as the birth and home to Solidarity (Polish trade union) and its leader Lech Walesa, Theater Wybrzeze courageously premiered \"Vatzlav\". These were the times that the country had food shortages, curfews and a police hour. Many actors were interned including actor Jerzy Kiszkis who played the title role of \"Vatzlav\". A Gda\u0144sk born actress, activist and Solidarity Solidarno\u015b\u0107 (Solidarity)supporter Beata Pozniak, was asked to play Justine, a character that symbolized justice. Censorship in theaters were enforced. It was noted that in this 1982 Gda\u0144sk production, the censor stopped Mrozek's play not allowing many gestures made by actors on stage, including Justine's father wearing a beard, because he reminded her too much of Karl Marx. (Reference: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/world-theatre-day_b_9548710) It was not without reason that Mrozek's plays were often classified as absurd, since the times that everyone lived in were often referred to as absurd. ==List of works== List of plays by Mro\u017cek (below) is based on Ma\u0142gorzata Sugiera's \"Dramaturgia S\u0142awomira Mro\u017cka\" (Dramatic works of S\u0142awomir Mro\u017cek): *Professor / The professorSource: Jerzy Afanasjew, Sezon kolorowych chmur.
