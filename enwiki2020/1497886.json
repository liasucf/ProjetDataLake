    "text": "John Benjamin Ireland (January 30, 1914 \u2013 March 21, 1992) was a Canadian- American actor and film director. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in All the King's Men (1949), making him the first Vancouver- born actor to receive an Oscar nomination. Ireland was a supporting actor in several Western films such as My Darling Clementine (1946), Red River (1948), Vengeance Valley (1951), and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957). His other film roles include 55 Days at Peking (1963), The Adventurers (1970), and Farewell, My Lovely (1975). Ireland also appeared in many television series, notably The Cheaters (1960\u201362). He was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to the television industry. ==Early life== Ireland was born in Vancouver, British Columbia on January 30, 1914. He lived in New York City from a very early age. Ireland's formal education ended at the 7th grade, and he worked to help his family make ends meet. He never knew his natural father; his mother, a Scottish piano teacher Gracie Ferguson, remarried to Michael Noone, an Irish vaudevillian, and had three other children, a daughter Kathryn, a son named Tommy (the future actor-comedian Tommy Noonan), and another son, Michael. Their last name was Noone; Ireland never knew for sure where his last name came from. One of his jobs was in a water carnival where he wrestled a dead octopus. He was a swimmer, once competing with Johnny Weissmuller. He performed underwater stunts at a carnival and worked as a barker. ==Career== ===Theatre=== One day he was passing the Davenport Free Theater in Manhattan. He entered, thinking it offered a free show and instead received free training. He slept in a dressing room and was paid a dollar a day to work backstage while rehearsing lines. In 1941 he made his Broadway debut in a production of Macbeth with Maurice Evans and Judith Anderson. Other Broadway plays followed.\"John Ireland, 78, Longtime Actor With Role in 'All the King's Men'\" Bruce Lambert, THE NEW YORK TIMES, March 22, 1992 ===20th Century Studios=== Ireland signed with 20th Century Studios and made his screen-debut as Private Windy, the thoughtful letter- writing GI, in the 1945 war film A Walk in the Sun, directed by Lewis Milestone. This was followed by Wake Up and Dream (1946); Behind Green Lights (1946) with Carole Landis; and It Shouldn't Happen to a Dog (1946), again with Landis.

Ireland played the lead in Open Secret (1948) for Eagle- Lion, then had a support role in Mann's classic noir, Raw Deal (1948). Ireland had a vital support part in Howard Hawks' 1948 film Red River as the gunslinger Cherry Valance. However, Ireland's part was reduced when Hawks became annoyed with the actor. Ireland was an army captain in the Ingrid Bergman spectacular, Joan of Arc (1948). ===All the King's Men=== In April 1948 Ireland signed a contract with Columbia Pictures at $500 a week going up to $1500 a week.

Ireland was featured as Bob Ford in the low budget I Shot Jesse James (1949) the first movie directed by Sam Fuller.

In December 1949 Columbia suspended him after walking out after filming one scene on One Way Out (released as Convicted). He sued the studio. Lippert Pictures gave him the lead in The Return of Jesse James (1950) and he appeared opposite his then- wife Joanne Dru in support parts in Vengeance Valley (1951) During McCarthyism in the early 50s, he successfully sued two television producers for breach of contract and slander, claiming that they reneged on roles promised to him due to his perceived political undesirability, including the lead in a TV series The Adventures of Ellery McQueen. He received an undisclosed but \"substantial\" cash settlement. Ireland had the leads in some low-budget films: The Basketball Fix (1951); The Scarf (1951); Little Big Horn (1951); The Bushwackers (1952); and Hannah Lee (1953) with his wife. He directed the latter. That film resulted in a lawsuit against the producers. He went to England to make The Good Die Young (1954) and supported his wife in Southwest Passage (1954) and Joan Crawford in Queen Bee (1955). ===Director=== John Ireland turned director with The Fast and the Furious (1955), an early production from Roger Corman; Ireland also starred.

Ireland regularly returned to the stage throughout his career and co-directed two features in the 1950s: the acclaimed Western drama Hannah Lee (1953) and the carjacking B-movie The Fast and the Furious (1955). ==Personal life== Occasionally Ireland's name was mentioned in tabloids of the times, in connection with much younger starlets, including Natalie Wood, Barbara Payton, and Sue Lyon. He attracted controversy by dating 16-year-old actress Tuesday Weld when he was 45. Ireland also had an affair with co-star Joan Crawford while on the set of Queen Bee (1955).
