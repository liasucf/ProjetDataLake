    "text": "The Uhlenhuth test, also referred to as the antigen\u2013antibody precipitin test for species, is a test which can determine the species of a blood sample. It was invented by Paul Uhlenhuth in 1901, based on the discovery that the blood of different species had one or more characteristic proteins. The test represented a major breakthrough and came to have tremendous importance in forensic science in the 20th century.Michael Kurland, Irrefutable Evidence: A History of Forensic Science (p. 200), Dee, 2009, The test was further refined for forensic use by the Swiss chemist Maurice M\u00fcller in the 1960s.Keith Inman, Norah Rudin, Principles and Practice of Criminalistics: The Profession of Forensic Science (p. 32), CRC Press, 2000 ==References== Category:Forensic techniques Category:Serology ",
