    "text": "William Silva de Carvalho (born 7 April 1992) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for Spanish club Real Betis and the Portugal national team as a defensive midfielder. He spent most of his career with Sporting CP since making his debut with the first team at age 18, going on to appear in 192 competitive matches and win the 2015 Ta\u00e7a de Portugal. A full international for Portugal since 2013, Carvalho represented the nation in two FIFA World Cups and UEFA Euro 2016, winning the latter tournament. ==Early life== Born in Luanda, Carvalho moved to Portugal when he was just a few years old. His grandfather Praia and his uncle Afonso were also footballers and played for Angolan club Progresso Associa\u00e7\u00e3o do Sambizanga. ==Club career== ===Sporting CP=== After moving to Portugal, Carvalho first started playing in the streets and was eventually recruited by Recreios Desportivos de Algueir\u00e3o. In 2004, he joined Uni\u00e3o Sport Clube de Mira Sintra, where he was the youngest player in the squad and also their captain. He joined Sporting CP's youth system at age 13, making his official debut with the first team on 3 April 2011 by playing injury time in a 1\u20131 away draw against Vit\u00f3ria S.C. in the Primeira Liga, then spent six months on loan to C.D. F\u00e1tima in the third division. Still under contract to the Lisbon side, Carvalho played one and a half seasons on loan with Cercle Brugge K.S.V. in the Belgian Pro League starting from January 2012, featuring alongside several Sporting teammates who were there on the same basis. His first professional goal came on 7 April in a 6\u20134 home win over OH Leuven, and a year later he helped the team to the final of the Belgian Cup, where they lost 0\u20132 to K.R.C. Genk at the Stade Roi Baudouin. Carvalho returned for the 2013\u201314 campaign, being a defensive mainstay for newly appointed coach Leonardo Jardim and scoring his first goal for the side on 27 October, netting the 1\u20131 equaliser in an eventual 1\u20133 loss at FC Porto. During the following summer, he caught the attention of several European clubs, with Arsenal having their \u00a313 million plus Joel Campbell offer rejected. Sporting only acquired the totality of Carvalho's rights in November 2014, with third-party ownership adding to the difficulties of any possible deal. Carvalho began 2014\u201315 by seeing a red card \u2013 his first ever \u2013 in a 1\u20131 home draw against Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra, receiving his marching orders after a second bookable offense in the 65th minute. He went on to conquer his first club trophy, that season's Ta\u00e7a de Portugal, playing the full 120 minutes in the final win over S.C. Braga. Among continued transfer speculation linking him with a number of English Premier League sides, including Arsenal again, manager Jorge Jesus claimed that Carvalho would remain at the club. On 14 July 2015, Sporting confirmed that the player had suffered a stress fracture in his tibia which would sideline him for three months. In 2017, approaches from West Ham United caused a breakdown in relations between the two clubs that was later resolved. On 15 May 2018, Carvalho and several of his teammates, including coaches, were injured following an attack by around 50 supporters of Sporting at the club's training ground after the team finished third in the league and missed out on qualification to the UEFA Champions League. Despite the events, he and the rest of the team agreed to play in the Portuguese Cup final scheduled for the following weekend, eventually losing to C.D. Aves. ===Betis=== On 13 July 2018, Carvalho joined Real Betis on a five-year contract. The club paid \u20ac16 million plus an additional \u20ac4 million in variable costs for 75% of the player's rights, with \u20ac10 million more to come later for a further 20% of his rights depending on certain conditions and achievements. He made his La Liga debut on 17 August, playing 65 minutes in a 0\u20133 home loss against Levante UD. ==International career== Eligible for both Portugal and Angola, Carvalho chose to represent the former. When he was still part of the Portugal under-20s, the Angolan Football Federation tried to call him up, but was rejected. Carvalho made his debut with the Portuguese under-21 team on 15 October 2012, in a 0\u20131 friendly loss with Ukraine. He scored twice during the 2015 UEFA European Championship qualifiers, in home wins against Norway (5\u20131) and Israel (3\u20130). 2018 World Cup Carvalho was first summoned by full side manager Paulo Bento in November 2013 for the 2014 FIFA World Cup playoffs against Sweden. He won his first cap in the second leg on the 19th, coming on as a 73rd-minute substitute in a 3\u20132 away triumph (4\u20132 on aggregate). On 19 May 2014, Carvalho was named in the final 23-man squad for the tournament proper held in Brazil. He made his debut in the competition on 22 June, playing the second half of the 2\u20132 group stage draw against the United States after replacing injured Andr\u00e9 Almeida. He played all 90 minutes in the next match to help to a 2\u20131 win over Ghana, but the team was eliminated on goal difference. Carvalho played all the matches and minutes at the 2015 European Under-21 Championship. He was elected player of the tournament due to his performances, even though he missed the decisive attempt in the penalty shootout in the final against Sweden, with it saved by Patrik Carlgren after a 0\u20130 draw in Prague. At UEFA Euro 2016 in France, Carvalho was suspended from Portugal's semi-final victory over Wales but regained his place from Danilo Pereira in the final, a 1\u20130 win over the hosts at the Stade de France. He scored his first international goal on 13 November 2016, contributing to a 4\u20131 home defeat of Latvia for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers. In May 2018, Carvalho was selected by Fernando Santos for the upcoming World Cup held in Russia. ==Style of play== Carvalho plays primarily as a defensive midfielder, although he can also be deployed as a central midfielder or a central defender. Known for his passing range and accuracy, ability to control a game and composure on the pitch, he earned praise for his imposing physicality. In spite of lacking pace, Carvalho acted fast when it came to decision-making. He was often compared to Patrick Vieira. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"7\"|Sporting CP |2010\u201311 |rowspan=\"6\"|Primeira Liga |1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2013\u201314 |29||4||1||0||3||0||0||0||33||4 |- |2014\u201315 |30||1||5||0||0||0||7||0||42||1 |- |2015\u201316 |27||2||3||1||1||0||5||0||36||3 |- |2016\u201317 |32||2||3||0||2||0||6||0||43||2 |- |2017\u201318 |24||1||1||0||4||0||9||0||38||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !143!!10!!13!!1!!10!!0!!27!!0!!193!!11 |- |F\u00e1tima (loan) |2011\u201312 |Segunda Divis\u00e3o |13||3||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||13||3 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Cercle Brugge (loan) |2011\u201312 |rowspan=\"2\"|Pro League |19||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||20||1 |- |2012\u201313 |28||2||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||32||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !47!!3!!5!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2013!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2013!!52!!3 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Betis |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"3\"|La Liga |30||0||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||7||0||43||0 |- |2019\u201320 |13||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||13||0 |- |2020\u201321 |5||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||colspan=\"2\"|\u2013||5||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !48!!2!!6!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2013!!7!!0!!61!!2 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !251!!18!!24!!1!!10!!0!!34!!0!!319!!19 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by national team and year |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"9\"|Portugal |2013||1||0 |- |2014||10||0 |- |2015||4||0 |- |2016||14||1 |- |2017||11||1 |- |2018||13||0 |- |2019||6||2 |- |2020||3||0 |- !Total||62||4 |} ===International goals=== (Portugal score listed first, score column indicates score after each Carvalho goal) {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
