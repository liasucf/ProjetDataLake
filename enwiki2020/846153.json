In June 2002 Aghajari gave an address in Hamadan commemorating the 25th anniversary of the death of Dr. Ali Shariati, criticized some of the present Islamic practices in Iran as being in contradiction with the original practices and ideology of Islam, and calling for \"Islamic Protestantism\" and reform in Islam.

Vol. 365, Iss. 8304; pg. 72 Although other controversial death sentences have been reduced on appeal, Aghajari refused to appeal the ruling, announcing through his lawyer that \"those who have issued this verdict have to implement it if they think it is right or else the judiciary has to handle it.\" While in prison his family reported that Aghajari's amputated leg stub was bruised and infected and that he was \"unable to stand up, walk or use the prison's hygiene facilities.\" The human rights group, Amnesty International, campaigned against the sentence.2 December, 2002, Iranian academic facing death The death sentence was denounced by many. The Iranian parliament, President Mohammad Khatami, and Grand Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri condemned it. Demonstrations against the sentence began the day after it was made public on November 6. They are thought to have attracted no more than 5000 participants but nonetheless were \"the most serious protests in Iran since 1999\" and are thought to have provoked Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to order a review of the verdict and a threat to use \"popular forces\" (basij) against the demonstrators.Christopher de Bellaigue, The Struggle for Iran, New York Review of Books, 2007, p.39\"Iran/Iraq\" Nizar Wattad, Paola Rizzuto.

Newsweek. (International ed.). New York: November 25, 2002. pg. 70 The failure of Iran's Hezbollah paramilitaries to make \"a serious attempt to break up\" the peaceful reformist student protests over the sentence was thought to be associated with Supreme Leader Khamenei's implicit criticism of the sentence and the \"impartiality\" of his failing to side with conservative hardliners.\"International: Khatami's last stand, perhaps; Iran's struggle for reform\", The Economist.
