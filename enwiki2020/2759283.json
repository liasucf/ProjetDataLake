The Sierra Railroad Corporation is a privately owned common carrier. Its Sierra Northern Railway freight division handles all freight operations for all branches owned by the Sierra Railroad. The company's Mendocino Railway group operates the diesel- and steam-powered Sacramento RiverTrain (Woodland-Sacramento) and the Skunk Train (Fort Bragg-Willits). The company's Sierra Energy division is for energy projects. ==History== The similarly named Sierra Railway Company of California was founded in 1897 to connect the California Central Valley to the Gold Country foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Its historic western terminus has always been in Oakdale where a junction was once formed with both the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway and the Southern Pacific. The Santa Fe's (now BNSF Railway) Oakdale Branch provided one freight outlet to the AT&SF; mainline at Riverbank, California; the Southern Pacific Oakdale Branch from Stockton was abandoned in 1986 and torn out by 1990. The Sierra Railroad bought the BNSF mainline from Riverbank MP1 to Oakdale in 2008. The portion of the former Sierra Railway conveyed by the railroad's historic owners, the Crocker Family, to the California State Park System are with \"Sierra Railway\", which preserves the original operating name of the entire line and is headquartered at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown, California. ==Beginnings== Sierra Railway route in 1931 The Sierra Railway Company of California was incorporated on February 1, 1897 by founders Thomas S. Bullock, Prince Andre Poniatowski, and William H. Crocker. In May, the first rails were laid in the grain fields just east of Oakdale, and the stops grew to include Occidental (Now called Arnold), Paulsell, Warnerville, Cooperstown, Chinese, and finally on November 8, 1897; Jamestown, California. The railroad owners had no intention of ending the line there, and the line was extended to Tuolumne City, some 16 miles from Jamestown. By 1900, the line had been completed, the same as it is today, with the exception of the abandonment of the Standard to Tuolumne Right-Of-Way. In 1937, the Sierra Railway was sold at a public auction to the new Sierra Railroad Company, and the debts of the original company were settled. In 1955, the railroad made the switch from steam to diesel power, but retained the steam locomotives for movie and television work for which the railroad is famous. In 1971, the Sierra Railroad used its vintage steam locomotives and facilities to its advantage, and opened \"Rail Town 1897\" as a tourist attraction. In 1979, The Crocker Association, which was the sole owner of the railroad at that time, closed Rail Town and put both the Sierra Railroad and the Jamestown complex with equipment up for sale separately. In 1980, the Sierra Railroad was sold to Silverfoot Inc., and in 1982 the California Department of Parks and Recreation purchased the Jamestown facilities and reopened the site as Railtown 1897 State Historic Park. In 1995, Silverfoot resold the operation to the Sierra Pacific Coast Railway, and in 2003 merged with the Yolo Shortline Railway, as it exists today. ==Locomotive Roster== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Number !Builder !Type !Date built !Heritage !Disposition !Notes |- |A |Plymouth |DLC6 |1925 |HC Collins | | |- |1 |Unknown | |Unknown |Prescott & Arizona Central #1 |Sold/Transferred to West Side Lumber Company as Mill Switcher | |- |2 (1st) |Unknown | |Unknown |Prescott & Arizona Central #2 |Scrapped circa 1899 |Only used during construction of the railroad |- |2 (2nd) |New York | |1889 |Northern Pacific |Sold to Lassen Lumber & Box, scrapped in 1940 | |- |3 |Rogers | |1891 |Prescott & Arizona Central #3 |Donated to Railtown 1897, Operational |Known as the \"Movie Star Locomotive\" for its roles in many films and television shows |- |4 |Baldwin | |1882 |Northern Pacific #99 |Sold to Pickering Lumber as #14 and scrapped in 1938 | |- |5 |Schenectady | |1899 |New |Sold to Hawaii Consolidated (converted to a 2-6-2), scrapped in 1947 |Sierra's first new locomotive. |- |6 |Baldwin | |1883 |Northern Pacific #144 |Sold to Atlas- Olympia, later converted to a stationary boiler and scrapped in 1937 |Primarily assigned to passenger service. |- |7 |Baldwin | |1882 |Northern Pacific #93 |Sold |disposition unknown, presumed scrapped. |- |9 |Heisler |Heisler 2-Truck |1899 |New |Sold to Standard Lumber Company as #8, resold to West Side Lumber Co., scrapped in 1947 |Built for service on the Angels Branch. |- |10 |Lima |Shay 2-Truck |1902 |New |Sold to Hofius Stell & Equipment, resold to Walville Lumber Co. then to Diamond Match Co. scrapped in 1942 |Built for service on the Angels Branch. |- |11 |Lima |Shay 2-Truck |1903 |New |Sold to United Commercial Company, resold to Pickering Lumber Co., resold to Verdi Lumber Co. then to Clover Valley Lumber Co., scrapped in 1952 |Built for service on the Angels Branch. |- |12 |Lima |Shay 3-Truck |1903 |New |Sold to Pickering Lumber Co., now owned by the Pacific Locomotive Association, stored serviceable |Sierra's only 3-Truck Shay.
