    "text": "The Portuguese legislative election of 2009 was held on 27 September, to renew all 230 members of the Assembly of the Republic.http://www.mherrera.org/elections.htm The Socialist Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, won the largest number of seats, but didn't repeat the overall majority they gained in 2005.. The Socialist Party of Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates came in first despite losing 9% of the vote and 24 seats. In these elections there were approximately 9.5 million Portuguese at home and abroad called to determine the 230 seats in the Assembleia da Rep\u00fablica and 18th constitutional government in Portugal after 1976. The Socialists won the election with a clear lead over the conservative Social Democrats, with big gains for the People's Party and for the Left Bloc. The election took place during the regular end of the previous four-year legislative period. From 2005 to 2009 ruled by the Socialist Party (PS), led by Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, with an absolute majority. The opinion polls at the beginning of the official election campaign on 12 September 2009, showed a too close to call race between the Socialists and the conservative Social Democrats,. but just days before the election the Socialists increased their lead over the Social Democrats.. A total of 13 parties and two coalitions competed in this election. Focus of the campaign was the impact of global economic, the financial crisis and the construction of new infrastructure projects, including the high-speed rail link Lisbon-Madrid and Lisbon-Porto- Vigo, and the new Lisbon airport. Neither of the two major parties won an absolute majority in the Assembly of the Republic, so, the future prime minister had to form a coalition, or at least rely on other parties to govern. In that case, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was in a better position than Manuela Ferreira Leite, since the Portuguese left won by 54.23% of the vote and 128 seats, against 39.54% and 102 deputies to the right. On 12 October, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates was invited by President An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva to form government. The new cabinet was announced on 22 October and sworn in on 26 October. Voter turnout was one of the lowest in Portuguese election history, as 59.7% of the electorate cast a ballot. == Background == In the February 2005 early elections, the Socialists, under the leadership of Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, won 45% of the votes and 121 MPs, the 1st time the Socialists won a majority and the 1st time a single party won a majority since Cavaco Silva's PSD victory in 1991. The PSD suffered a heavy defeat, achieving their worst results since 1983, and faced with this failure, the then PSD leader and outgoing Prime Minister, Pedro Santana Lopes, resigned from the leadership and called an election for party chair. In the party's congress in April 2005, Lu\u00eds Marques Mendes became party leader winning 56% of the delegates, against the 44% of his rival, Lu\u00eds Filipe Menezes.. During the first months in his government, S\u00f3crates raised taxes to cut the deficit and initiated a policy of strict budgetary rigor. At the same time, he faced a very harsh summer with Wildfires across the country.. That same October, the Socialists suffered a heavy defeat in the 2005 local elections, winning just 108 cities, a drop of 4, against the PSD's 158 mayoral holds. The PS was also unable to retake control of Lisbon and Porto. In January 2006, a new President was elected. An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, PM between 1985-1995, became the first center-right candidate to win a presidential election, although only just. The PS candidate, former PM and President M\u00e1rio Soares polled a disappointing third place with just 14% of the votes. In 2007, a referendum for the legalization of abortion was held. After the failure of the 1998 referendum, the Yes side prevailed winning 59% of the votes against the No's 41%, making abortion legal in Portugal.. While the deficit reduction had been successful, and with the economy growing above 2% of GDP, the government faced heavy opposition for its policies, particularly from teachers unions. In March 2008, more than 100,000 teachers protested in Lisbon against S\u00f3crates and his Education minister, Maria de Lurdes Rodrigues.. At the same time, the Social Democrats (PSD) were in internal crisis. The then PSD leader, Lu\u00eds Filipe Menezes, elected in September 2007, resigned after just 6 months in the job.. In the following leadership elections, held on May 2008, Manuela Ferreira Leite became the first woman to lead a major party in Portugal, winning 38% of the votes, against the 31% of Pedro Passos Coelho and the 30% of Pedro Santana Lopes.. Entering 2009, Portugal was strongly hit by the effects of the financial crisis that was shaking the global economy, and, therefore, the country entered in a recession. As a result, the government adopted stimulus measures that worsened the public finances and increased the deficit and the debt. In the European elections of June 7, 2009, the PSD stunned pundits by winning a European election for the first time since 1989, with 31.7% of the votes. The Socialists suffered a huge defeat, winning just 26% of the votes, a drop of 18%. == Electoral system == The Assembly of the Republic has 230 members elected to four-year terms. Governments do not require absolute majority support of the Assembly to hold office, as even if the number of opposers of government is larger than that of the supporters, the number of opposers still needs to be equal or greater than 116 (absolute majority) for both the Government's Programme to be rejected or for a motion of no confidence to be approved. The number of seats assigned to each district depends on the district magnitude. The use of the d'Hondt method makes for a higher effective threshold than certain other allocation methods such as the Hare quota or Sainte-Lagu\u00eb method, which are more generous to small parties.Gallaher, Michael (1992). \"Comparing Proportional Representation Electoral Systems: Quotas, Thresholds, Paradoxes and Majorities\" == Parties == The parties that partook in the election, and their leaders, were: *Left Bloc (BE), Francisco Lou\u00e7\u00e3 *Democratic Unity Coalition (CDU), Jer\u00f3nimo de Sousa *Socialist Party (PS), Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates *Social Democratic Party (PSD), Manuela Ferreira Leite *People's Party (CDS\u2013PP), Paulo Portas Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, leader of the Socialist Party, was nominated Prime Minister for a 2nd consecutive term. ==Campaign period== ===Party slogans=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:97%; text-align:left;\" |- ! style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Party or alliance !
