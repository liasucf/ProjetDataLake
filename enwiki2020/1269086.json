In the folk arena and among sci-fi friends and fans he was known as Kapit\u00e1n Kid (other pseudonyms included: V\u00e1clav Rabsk\u00fd, C.P. Stonebridge and Ag\u00e1ta B\u00edl\u00e1). ==Life and career== Velinsk\u00fd was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1932. A player of both banjo and swing guitar, he wrote more than 50 country and folk songs, including \"Jenofefa\", \"Krinolina\" and \"Mary Celeste\", and was one of the founders of the Czech folk festival, Porta. His science-fiction books included Engerlings, Notes from Garth, Dzwille, and Continent of Unlimited Possibilities. He was an honorary member of the Ertar-Czech Relations Society, a science-fiction club. He wrote eight staged theater plays and more than 30 detective novels based around a detective named Ota Fink, including Dark Well, Man-eater, Death of a Midget, Lady with a Green Elephant, Very Long Stairs, Murderer's Road, Estimated Solution and others. Velinsk\u00fd founded a one-man publishing house, the Club of Friends of Captain Kid, the club referring to readers of his books and fans of his music. He used the club's data and close contact with his audience to better plan his production. This concerned not just published books and CDs, but deciding between writing music or literature and also selecting themes. The result was a publishing house producing new original books and songs \"on demand\". He was also a miner, metalsmith, and graphic artist. Velinsk\u00fd died of lung cancer in \u00dast\u00ed nad Labem in February 2012, aged 79. ==References== ==External links== *Kkkk.cz Category:20th- century Czech people Category:20th-century writers Category:Czech science fiction writers Category:Czech male writers Category:Writers from Prague Category:1932 births Category:2012 deaths Category:20th-century male writers ",
