    "text": "Karel Geraerts (; born 5 January 1982 in Genk) is a former Belgian football player who last played for Charleroi in 2016 and after being without a club for half a year has announced his retirement in January 2017. ==Career== Geraerts played for Club Brugge from 1998 to December 2003. In 2004 Club Brugge lent him to Lokeren where he scored his first goal in the Jupiler League. In the summer of 2004 he moved to Standard Li\u00e8ge. In June 2007 he went back to Bruges. As a youngster the midfielder played with C.S. Mechelen-aan- de-Maas and Racing Genk (from 1996 to 1998) before he moved to the youth team of Club Brugge. After the 2010\u201311 season, Geraerts was no longer part of the plans at Club Brugge and was told he could look for a new club, which resulted in him signing with newly promoted side Oud-Heverlee Leuven on the last day of the transfer period. Geraerts' contract ended in 2014 and with Oud-Heverlee Leuven just being relegated, it was not renewed. This allowed him to move as a free agent player to Charleroi. In 2005, Geraerts debuted for the Belgium national football team. In his first match in the starting line-up, on 12 October in and against Lithuania in a World Cup qualifier, he scored the opening goal. ==International goals== |- bgcolor=#DFE7F2 | 1. || 12 October 2005 || \u017dalgiris Stadium, Vilnius, Lithuania || || 0\u20131 || 1\u20131 || 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification |- bgcolor=#DFE7F2 | 2. || 20 May 2006 || \u0160tadi\u00f3n Antona Malatinsk\u00e9ho, Trnava, Slovakia || || 1\u20131 || 1\u20131 || Friendly |- bgcolor=#DFE7F2 | 3. || 12 September 2007 || Almaty Central Stadium, Almaty, Kazakhstan || || 0\u20131 || 2\u20131 || UEFA Euro 2008 qualification |- bgcolor=#DFE7F2 | 4. || 17 October 2007 || Stade Roi Baudouin, Brussels, Belgium || || 3\u20130 || 3\u20130 || UEFA Euro 2008 qualification |} ==References== * * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Belgian footballers Category:K.R.C.
