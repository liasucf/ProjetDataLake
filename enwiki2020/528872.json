    "text": "Tolyatti (), also known in English as Togliattigrad and Italian as Togliatti in honor of the Italian communist politician Palmiro Togliatti, is a city in Samara Oblast, Russia. Population: It is the largest city in Russia which does not serve as the administrative center of a federal subject. Preobrazhensky Sobor - Transfiguration Cathedral, Tolyatti Internationally, the city is best known as the home of Russia's largest car manufacturer AvtoVAZ (Lada), which was founded in 1966. It was previously known as Stavropol-on-Volga (until 1964). ==History== It was founded in 1737 as a fortress called Stavropol () by the Russian statesman Vasily Tatishchev.https://tgl.ru/history Informally it was often referred as Stavropol-on-Volga (, Stavropol-na-Volge) to distinguish from Stavropol, a large city in southwest Russia, although Stavropol-on-Volga was never its official name.http://www.edu-sok.ru/upload/Prokofeva%20E_U.pdf The construction of the Kuybyshev Dam and Hydroelectric Station on the Volga River in the 1950s created the Kuybyshev Reservoir, which covered the existing location of the city, and it was completely rebuilt on a new site. In 1964, the city was chosen as the location of the new VAZ automobile plant\u2014a joint venture between Fiat and the Soviet government. It was thus renamed Tolyatti (after Palmiro Togliatti, the longest-serving secretary of the Italian Communist Party, who had been instrumental in setting up the venture with Fiat). Much of the modern city was constructed in the 1960s to house the workers of the factory, and today, AvtoVAZ dominates the economy of the city. ==Administrative and municipal status== City divisions Within the framework of administrative divisions, Tolyatti serves as the administrative center of Stavropolsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the city of oblast significance of Tolyatti\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Charter of Samara Oblast As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Tolyatti is incorporated as Tolyatti Urban Okrug.Law #189-GD ===City divisions=== For the administrative purposes, the city is divided into three districts: *Avtozavodsky (), also called Novy Gorod (literally New City), is the most modern; it was designed to host the workers of the city's AvtoVAZ factory, home of the Lada car; *Tsentralny (), also called Stary Gorod (lit. Old City), home of the city government and industrial center; *Komsomolsky (), the oldest district, built to house Hydroelectrical Plant builders. ==Economy== AvtoVAZ administration building The city's main claim to fame has been automobiles Lada (Zhiguli) manufactured by AvtoVAZ car plant employing some 110,000 people: in cooperation with Italy's Fiat since 1970, with General Motors since 2001 and with the Renault-Nissan Alliance since 2012. Other industries have moved into Tolyatti because it is close to abundant supplies of electricity and water. Petrochemicals are well represented in the city. Among the significant enterprises based there are \"TogliattiAzot\" (Russia's biggest ammonia manufacturer headed by Sergei Makhlai) and \"KuibyshevAzot\" (a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer and Russia's biggest caprolactam and polyamide producer). Other industries include building materials production, ship repair and electrical equipment and electronics. In 2011 the Tolyatti Special Economic Zone was launched in order to develop the region further and diversify the economy of the city. Several auto-component producers (German Mubea and Japanese Sanoh among them) have since been registered, as well as large industrial manufacturers (Praxair and Edscha). By November 2012 the value of project investment totalled 10 billion Rubles and around 3000 jobs were being created. ===Transportation=== River port on the Volga The transport system is well developed in the city. Public transport includes municipal buses and trolley-buses, and so-called \"alternative\" (commercial) transport or marshrutkas. External transport routes are provided by two bus stations, two railway stations and a city harbour. Tolyatti has its airport as well, but it is used by personal aircraft only (the nearest international airport, Kurumoch, is located 40 km away, towards Samara). The city is linked to the federal road network by the M5 \"Ural\" highway. As one of Russia's \"motor cities\", Tolyatti's car population has been greatly expanded, and traffic jams are common during morning and evening rush hours \u2014 Samara Oblast was one of the first regions to receive an additional licence plate code because its existing code did not have enough numbers for all its residents' cars.
