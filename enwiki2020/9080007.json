Retrieved January 27, 2008. Her mother died of breast cancer when Carol Lynn was fifteen. Carol Lynn studied music and theater at Brigham Young University, where she won the award for Best Actress two years in a row. Pearson married actor, musician, and songwriter Gerald Neils Pearson (1942\u20131984), whom she had met in a college production of The Skin of Our Teeth, on September 9, 1966 in Salt Lake City, Utah. The two were devout Latter Day Saints who both descended from several generations of Latter-day Saints. They were married for 12 years and had four children together, settling in Provo, Utah. Gerald had told Carol Lynn while they were engaged that he had had sexual relationships with men, but had left that phase of his life behind. Latter Day Saint authorities also assured the couple that marriage would turn Gerald into a heterosexual. However, he eventually confronted his homosexuality and after a move to California prompted by his desire to explore this side of himself, they separated and were divorced in 1978. He returned to live with her and their children after being diagnosed with AIDS in 1984, and she cared for him until his death. Her book Goodbye, I Love You is about their life together.
