    "text": "Line A is the oldest line of the Buenos Aires Underground. Opened to the public on 1 December 1913, the first underground line in South America, the Southern Hemisphere and the Spanish-speaking world. It made Buenos Aires the 13th city in the world to have an underground transport service. The line stretches 9.8 km from Plaza de Mayo and San Pedrito and runs under all of the Avenida de Mayo and part of the Avenida Rivadavia, and is used by 258,000 people per day. On the first day of public service (18 December 1913), it carried 220,000 passengers.Subterr\u00e1neos de Buenos Aires (Official Page) History of Line A \u2013 Retrieved 2010-11-04 Line A used the cars used at its inauguration for just under a century. These cars were built by Belgian company La Brugeoise starting in 1913 and were refurbished in 1927 when their wooden structure was modified for underground-only use. A peculiarity of the original \"pantograph\" cars on the \"underground tramway\" is that until 1926 they had both low doors at the ends for boarding from the street and high doors in the middle for loading from platforms in the tunnel. For this reason, Line A might also be considered the continent's first \"light rail subway\".Los coches de la l\u00ednea A del subterr\u00e1neo porte\u00f1o (Spanish\u2014Information and photographs) \u2013 Retrieved 2010-11-05 The old wooden cars were removed in 2013, and replaced by modern cars. The line has been extended twice since the completion of the original line in 1914, with the most recent two-station extension of San Jos\u00e9 de Flores and San Pedrito entering service on 27 September 2013. == History == National Congress. Tram leaving the underground and continuing above ground in Caballito (1913). La Brugeoise car at Plaza de Mayo, brought out of retirement briefly to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the line. During the first decade of the 20th century in Buenos Aires, road traffic had sharply increased due to a growing population. In 1903 the city had 895,381 inhabitants and there were 4,791 horse-drawn carriages and 60 cars, while by 1913 there were 1,457,885 people, with 6,211 carriages and 7,438 automobiles. Because it was necessary to create new forms of mass transit, in 1909 the Congress awarded Ferrocarril del Oeste (FCO) (Buenos Aires Western Railway) a concession to build a two-way underground railway that would join the main route of the Buenos Aires Western Railway (currently the Sarmiento Railway) at Once railway station, near Sadi Carnot Street (now Mario Bravo) with the port. But on 28 December of that year the Municipality of the City of Buenos Aires gave a concession to the Anglo- Argentine Tramways Company (AATC), which operated 80% of the tram system at the time \u2013 making it perhaps the largest in the world-Trams Of Argentina (See section; Transportes de Buenos Aires) \u2013 Retrieved 2010-11-30 to build an underground passenger rail service. After a dispute, it was agreed that the Western Railway would the line for freight, but only with one track at a depth that would allow the passage of the CTAA passenger line on a higher plane. Thus, construction of the Anglo-Argentine Line began on 15 September 1911, with the German company Philipp Holzmann & Cia. as contractor. The construction of this line involved hiring 1,500 workers and used 31 million bricks, 108,000 bags of cement, of iron braces, and of insulating layer. The total investment to build the line was m$n 17 million. m$n 3 million was invested in the excavation of the tunnel, m$n 7 million in construction, m$n 2.5 million in the initial 50 trains and m$n 2 million for the Polvor\u00edn Workshop.Justo Solsona y Carlos Hunter (1990).

On the following day it opened to the public, carrying 220,000 passengers. It was the first underground in South America, the Southern Hemisphere and the Spanish speaking world. Buenos Aires thus became the 13th city in the world to have an underground railway, behind London, Athens, Istanbul, Vienna, Budapest, Glasgow, Paris, Boston, Berlin, New York, Philadelphia, and Hamburg.La historia de 100 a\u00f1os del primer subte de Am\u00e9rica del Sur \u2013 Perfil, 1 December 2013. Each station had a length of 100 metres and had friezes of specific colours for easy identification. The construction of the Plaza Miserere station was performed by two companies, CTAA and FCO. At that time the station had two tracks for the railroad in the middle, and two pairs of lines for the underground, which were on the laterals. The outside southern track of the subway was eliminated in 1926 and it was decided to extend the platform to make the rail-underground transfer more convenient. The route was extended to R\u00edo de Janeiro Station on 1 April 1914 and on 14 July of that year to Caballito, renamed Primera Junta in 1923. Beyond Primera Junta a ramp was built in 1915 in the center of Rivadavia Avenue between Cachimayo and Emilio Mitre streets, for trains to access the Polvor\u00edn Workshop on Emilio Mitre and Jos\u00e9 Bonifacio streets, covering a surface loop shared with tram traffic until 1963. This 2 km route has been used since 1980 by Asociaci\u00f3n Amigos del Tranv\u00eda (Association of Friends of the Tram) to run the Buenos Aires Historical Tramway. The ramp had originally taken passengers to the surface to the intersection of Lacarra and Rivadavia Avenues where trains continued to run at street level, a service that was cancelled on 31 December 1926. ===Recent developments=== San Jos\u00e9 de Flores station, opened in 2013.

In the first expansion of the line since 1914, Pu\u00e1n and Carabobo stations were opened in December 2008.

One of the surviving 3 UEC Preston cars at the Polvor\u00edn Workshop. While the line was under construction, the Anglo- Argentine Tramways Company took bids from two companies to provide the rolling stock for the line: the Belgian company La Brugeoise et Nicaise et Delcuve and the British United Electric Car Company. The tram models presented by the respective companies were the La Brugeoise cars and the UEC Preston.Exhibieron la dupla hist\u00f3rica Preston para festejar el Bicentenario \u2013 EnElSubte, 26 May 2010. The latter was noted for its extravagant interior design, featuring exotic materials and UEC sent 4 of these trams to Buenos Aires for the AATC's consideration. Ultimately, the company chose to go with the Belgian trams and 125 of them were built to serve the line, though the 4 Preston trams were also kept to serve on the line. In 1927, the trams were converted to underground cars following the line's extension underground and abandonment of its overground segment. The UEC Preston cars left service in 1977 and the 3 remaining models are today used on the Buenos Aires Heritage Tramway and also for special occasions on Line A of the underground, such as during its 100-year anniversary.Los viejos vagones del subte A realizar\u00e1n viajes tur\u00edsticos \u2013 InfoBAE, 3 September 2013. The Brugeoise cars remained in service, though numerous attempts over the years were made to either modernise the fleet (as was done with a few cars modernised by the Emepa Group in the 1980s) or replace the rolling stock completely. One such attempt to replace the rolling stock was with the purchase of 96 Alstom Metropolis cars in 2001, however these were ultimately assigned to Line D instead of Line A.Ferrofilatelia \u2013 EnElSubte, 6 July 2010. After 96 years of continuous service, the La Brugeoise cars were nearing their final withdrawal from service in 2009. Spare parts for these trains were no longer available on the market so they had to be custom-made by request at Polvor\u00edn Workshop, where La Brugeoise units and other Buenos Aires Underground rolling stock are maintained and repaired by highly skilled and qualified personnel. At this point, it was already being discussed that these surviving vintage cars could continue operating as a tourist attraction on holidays and Sundays. According to Metrov\u00edas, the Buenos Aires Underground private operator, units underwent a routine check-up every 20 days, while every four years heavy maintenance was performed. Despite their 96 years of uninterrupted service, La Brugeoise trains had one of the lowest mechanical failure averages in the network: 19 every 100,000 km.Puesta a punto de los hist\u00f3ricos vagones de la l\u00ednea A, La Naci\u00f3n newspaper, 21 January 2009 (In Spanish\u2014History includes vintage photos and video) \u2013 Retrieved 2009-02-04 ===2013\u2013present=== 200 Series rolling stock, used from 2013 onwards.

They were replaced by new CNR rolling stock, which has been slowly introduced as units arrive from China.

The 45 200 Series CNR cars which arrived in 2013 were not sufficient to cover the entire fleet of the line, so it had to be supplemented by a temporary fleet of 35 Fiat-Materfer cars, which was still not enough to replace the 120 La Brugeoise units.SBASE reconoce que la frecuencia de la l\u00ednea A es \u201cinadmisible\u201d \u2013 EnElSubte, 5 March 2014. Some additional reformed Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel trains were added to the temporary fleet in addition to the Materfer trains, however the replacement of the rolling stock coincided with the opening of the San Jos\u00e9 de Flores and San Pedrito stations in the same year, so the line was still left with a serious defect in its rolling stock causing a decline in passenger numbers.Embarcaron primeros dos trenes de la segunda tanda de CNR \u2013 EnElSubte, 4 February 2015. In the meantime, a further 105 200 Series cars were ordered from China so that the line would be served in its entirety by 150 of these cars, and so the Siemens O&K; cars could be completely retired from service and the Materfer cars moved to Line E in time for its extension to Retiro.Hacienda aprueba contrato de financiamiento para 105 coches CNR \u2013 EnElSubte, 24 July 2014. These cars have been steadily arriving into the country since 2015 and are being incorporated into the line in order to recuperate the declines in frequency and passenger numbers since the retirement of the La Brugeoise cars. The last of the CNR units are expected to arrive between 2016 and 2017, by which time Line A's rolling stock will consist entirely of the 200 Series.Incorporar\u00e1n nuevos trenes a la l\u00ednea A: realizan pruebas \u2013 EnElSubte, 5 June 2015. ==Ghost stations== Two ghost stations exist on the line.
