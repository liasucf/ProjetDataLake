After the death of his brother the Great Khan M\u00f6ngke, Ariq B\u00f6ke claimed the title of the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire and briefly took power while his brothers Kublai (more commonly known as Kublai Khan) and Hulagu (more commonly known as Hulagu Khan) were absent from the Mongolian homeland. When Kublai returned for an election in 1260, rival factions could not agree, and elected both claimants, Kublai and Ariq B\u00f6ke, to the throne, resulting in the Toluid Civil War that fragmented the Mongol Empire. Ariq B\u00f6ke was supported by the traditionalists of the Mongol Empire, while his brother Kublai was supported by the senior princes of North China and Manchuria. ==Early years== Ariq B\u00f6ke was the youngest son of Sorghaghtani Beki and Tolui, the youngest son of Genghis Khan. When Genghis died in 1227, the leadership of the Empire passed to Genghis' third son (Ariq B\u00f6ke's uncle), \u00d6gedei. He peacefully attended the elections of both his uncle, Great Khan \u00d6gedei and \u00d6gedei's successor and eldest son, G\u00fcy\u00fck. After his eldest brother M\u00f6ngke was enthroned in 1250, his family became even more powerful among the Chingisids. His mother was Christian and Ariq B\u00f6ke was also known for being sympathetic towards Christianity; this is known from the account of Franciscan William of Rubruck, an envoy of Louis IX of France who wrote that he observed Ariq B\u00f6ke make the sign of cross and state that \"We know that the Messiah [Jesus] is God\". A Confucian tutor was arranged for Ariq B\u00f6ke, at the behest of his elder brother Kublai Khan, but Ariq B\u00f6ke did not take to Chinese scholars the way his elder brother had.Christopher P. Atwood, Encyclopedia of Mongolian and the Mongol Empire (Facts on File, 2004), 36. ==Succession struggle== ===Great Khan=== Ariq B\u00f6ke defeats Alghu-Rashid al'Din, Jami al Tavarikh. When \u00d6gedei Khan died, a power struggle erupted, with leadership then passing to \u00d6gedei's son G\u00fcy\u00fck in 1246, though G\u00fcy\u00fck died only two years later, in 1248. After another struggle, the sons of Tolui, \u00d6gedei's brother, took power. The first of Tolui's sons to be Great Khan was M\u00f6ngke, who proceeded with Kublai to conquer Southern China and the Southern Song Dynasty. Their brother Hulagu led the Mongol advance westward, conquering Baghdad and proceeding into Syria and towards Palestine. During this time, all affairs of the Heartland were left under the control of their brother Ariq B\u00f6ke. Ariq B\u00f6ke in traditional Mongolian script. When M\u00f6ngke died in 1259, Ariq B\u00f6ke was elected Khan in the absence of his brothers, and had the support of most of the existing ministers and powerful families in the capital of Karakorum, such as M\u00f6ngke's family, and other princes of the Golden family along with other forces in the capital of Karakorum including Torguud royal bodyguards and White Horde elites, as well as the Oirats, who were allied with him as one of the Oirat leaders was married to his daughter. However, when Kublai and Hulagu received news of M\u00f6ngke's death, they aborted their own battles in order to return to the capital to decide the matter of succession. In May 1260, Kublai was elected khan by his own supporters, to rival the claim of Ariq B\u00f6ke. A civil war subsequently broke out between the brothers for the leadership of the Empire. For example, when the Chagatai Khanate needed a new leader, Kublai attempted to send Abishqa, who was loyal to him. But Ariq B\u00f6ke had Abishqa captured and eventually killed, and instead installed his own ally Alghu. Ariq B\u00f6ke ordered Alghu to defend the area from both the forces of Hulagu, and the possible presence of Berke of the Golden Horde. But Alghu deserted Ariq B\u00f6ke, killing his envoys for treasure, while Kaidu remained loyal to Ariq B\u00f6ke. Alghu and Ariq B\u00f6ke were soon in direct conflict, with Alghu winning the first engagement, but then at the second, Ariq B\u00f6ke was victorious, and forced Alghu to flee westward. ===Surrender=== Eventually, as the war continued between Ariq B\u00f6ke and his brother Kublai, the former's forces weakened. Kublai had powerful Mongol cavalry troops, Mongolian, Manchurian, Han, Kazakh and numerous Chinese and Goryeo infantry units. Kublai's supporter Kadan, a son of \u00d6gedei, crushed Ariq B\u00f6ke's force under General Alandar, and Ariq B\u00f6ke twice lost control of the capital of Karakorum. Kublai also blockaded all trade to Mongolia from North China, in order to cut the food supply. Ariq B\u00f6ke finally submitted to Kublai in 1263. He was imprisoned by Kublai and died mysteriously a few years after his surrender, leading to rumors that he had been secretly poisoned. ==Legacy== Tamgha of Ariq B\u00f6ke. According to scholar David Morgan, \"Ariq B\u00f6ke can be seen as representing an influential school of thought among the Mongols, which Kublai through his actions and attitudes after 1260 opposed. Some Mongols felt there was a dangerous drift towards softness, typified in those like Kublai who thought there was something to be said for settled civilization and for the Chinese way of life. In the traditionalist view, the Mongol center ought to remain in Mongolia, and the Mongols' nomadic life be preserved uncontaminated. China ought merely to be exploited. Ariq B\u00f6ke came to be regarded as this faction's figurehead.\"Morgan 2007, pp.104\u2013105 This legacy was continued by Kaidu (Khaidu). Although Ariq B\u00f6ke lost power, some of his descendants later became important figures in the Ilkhanate and the Northern Yuan dynasty, and the lineage of both Ilkhan Arpa Ke'un and Yes\u00fcder can be traced back to Ariq B\u00f6ke. ==See also== *Toluid Civil War ==References== ==Bibliography== * *Ren\u00e9 Grousset Empire of the Steppes * * *Jack Wheaterford Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World *John Man Kublai Khan *H.
