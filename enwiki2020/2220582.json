    "text": "A game of Flash Point: Fire Rescue in progress Cooperative board games are board games in which players work together to achieve a common goal, the result being either winning or losing as a group. As the name suggests, cooperative games stress cooperation over competition.. This type of board game attracts people who enjoy the social aspect of games and is a good way to get new board game players interested in the hobby. Either the players win the game by reaching a pre-determined objective, or all players lose the game, often by not reaching the objective before a certain event ends the game.https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2023/cooperative-play == Definition == In cooperative board games, all players win or lose the game together. These games should not be confused with noncompetitive games, such as The Ungame, which simply do not have victory conditions or any set objective to complete. While adventure board games with role playing and dungeon crawl elements like Gloomhaven may be included, pure tabletop role- playing games like Descent: Journeys in the Dark are excluded as they have potentially infinite victory conditions with persistent player characters. Furthermore, games in which players compete together in two or more groups, teams or partnerships (such as Axis & Allies, and card games like Bridge and Spades) fall outside of this definition, even though there is temporary cooperation between some of the players. Multiplayer conflict games like Diplomacy may also feature temporary cooperation during the course of the game. These games are not considered cooperative though, because players are eliminated and ultimately only one individual can win. == History and development == === 20th century === Early cooperative games were used by parents and teachers in educational settings.https://cooperativegames.com/a-brief-history-of-cooperative-games/ In 1954, a board game version of Beat the Clock, a game show, was released.https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9774/beat-clock-game In 1956, the Lowell Toy Manufacturing Corporation of New York City released a board game version of I've Got a Secret, a panel show, featuring host Garry Moore on the cover of the box.

Zagal, Jochen Rick, and Idris Hsi's \"Collaborative games: Lessons learned from board games\", the lessons the researchers learned highlight what makes a good cooperative board game. * First, the game needs to point out the folly of being competitive by allowing players to make decisions that benefits themselves rather than the whole group. * Second, each player should not need the input of the rest of the group when making a decision. * Third, players need to be able to identify what actions had benefits or consequences. * Fourth, the game should reward selfless players by giving players unique roles or traits. These researchers also point out Challenges in designing collaborative games due to the following pitfalls that must be overcome: * game degenerating into a single player decides the actions for everyone * For a game to be engaging, players should invested in the end result and winning the game should be satisfying * For repeat play, game experience should vary and challenge needs to evolve === Game as the opponent === Participants typically play against the game. Cooperative board games generally involve players joining forces against the game itself, and can be played without any player in the role of the opposition or Gamemaster. In Pandemic, for example, players work together to stop and cure different strains of diseases. Also, in some cooperative games, players actually cooperate with the opposing forces in the game. For example, in Max the Cat, players are mice who keep an aggressive cat at bay by offering him milk and other appeasements. In this way, all participants in the conflict scenario are fulfilled and the resolution is truly cooperative or \"win-win\". === Randomness === In many contemporary cooperative games, randomizing devices help in varying game experience over multiple plays. Dice can be rolled, cards can be drawn each turn from a shuffled deck or various board sections of a modular board revealed to generate random objectives, events and challenges. These provide the conflict or challenge in the game, and make it progressively more difficult for the players. For example, in Save the Whales, players work together to protect whales from the challenges inherent in the game setting\u2014radioactive waste, commercial whaling, etc. === Focus on the Theme === Themes and objectives in cooperative games are either or both of grand scale and highly detailed. This brings an investment in the games objective and the satisfaction of succeeding against the overwhelming magnitude of the odds. The outcome of the effort is often uncertain until the very end, the games try to maintain (and often build) interest and tension. === Cooperation and its Variations === Scotland Yard board Most cooperative games bestow different abilities or responsibilities upon the players incentivizing cooperation. Some cooperative games might have an added layer of intrigue by giving players personal win conditions. In Dead of Winter: A Cross Roads Game, a zombie apocalypse game, in order to win players must achieve the communal victory condition and a personal objective. Gloomhaven is a cooperative board game for 1 to 4 players designed by Isaac Childres and published by Cephalofair Games in 2017 where each player also has a personal objective. ==== Secret Opponent ==== In Scotland Yard and The Fury of Dracula have one player secretly controls the enemy. The other players are cooperating to locate and defeat the enemy. ==== Traitor ==== A traitor game can be seen as a cooperative game with a betrayal mechanism, or as a kind of team game. For this mechanism, traitors begin the game with hidden identities, or are assigned them during the game. Traitors typically win if the other players lose. In Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game, players who receive a \u201cYou Are a Cylon\u201d card when loyalty cards are handed out work in secret to undermine humanity. Other games, like Betrayal at House on the Hill, start out fully cooperative, but assigns a player to be the villain mid-game. Such games may be separated from Cooperative board games.https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2023/str-02-cooperative- games == See also == *Cooperative game (in mathematical game theory) *Cooperative gameplay (in video games) *Eurogame *Amerigame *Board wargame == References == Category:Board game gameplay and terminology Category:Cooperative games ",
