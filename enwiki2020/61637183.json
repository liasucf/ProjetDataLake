    "text": "The men's +82.5 kg weightlifting competitions at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London took place on 11 August at the Empress Hall of the Earls Court Exhibition Centre.Official Report, p. 476. It was the sixth time the heavyweight class competition was held, all at over 82.5 kg. Each weightlifter had three attempts at each of the three lifts. The best score for each lift was summed to give a total. The weightlifter could increase the weight between attempts (minimum of 5 kg between first and second attempts, 2.5 kg between second and third attempts) but could not decrease weight. If two or more weightlifters finished with the same total, the competitors' body weights were used as the tie-breaker (lighter athlete wins).Official Report, p. 481. ==Records== Prior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows. {| class=\"wikitable\" |rowspan=4|World record | Press | | 151 kg | | 1948 |- | Snatch | | 139.5 kg | | 1947 |- | Clean & Jerk | | 174.5 kg | | 1947 |- | Total | | 455 kg | Philadelphia, United States | 26\u201327 September 1946 |- |rowspan=4|Olympic record | Press | | 132.5 kg | Berlin, Germany | 5 August 1936 |- | Snatch | | 125 kg | Berlin, Germany | 5 August 1936 |- | Clean & Jerk | | 165 kg | Berlin, Germany | 5 August 1936 |- | Total | | 410 kg | Berlin, Germany | 5 August 1936 |} ==Results== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !rowspan=2 | Rank !rowspan=2 | Athlete !rowspan=2 | Nation !rowspan=2 | Body weight !colspan=4 | Press (kg) !colspan=4 | Snatch (kg) !colspan=4 | Clean & Jerk (kg) !rowspan=2 | Total |- !1 !2 !3 !Result !1 !2 !3 !Result !1 !2 !3 !Result |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 98.64 || 137.5 || ~~147.5~~ || \u2014 || 137.5 || 127.5 || 137.5 || ~~142.5~~ || 137.5 || 165 || ~~177.5~~ || 177.5 || 177.5 || 452.5 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 92.61 || 117.5 || 122.5 || ~~125~~ || 122.5 || 127.5 || 132.5 || ~~137.5~~ || 132.5 || 160 || 170 || ~~177.5~~ || 170 || 425 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 102.50 || 120 || 125 || 127.5 || 127.5 || 117.5 || 122.5 || 125 || 125 || 150 || 155 || 160 || 160 || 412.5 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 99.20 || 112.5 || 117.5 || ~~122.5~~ || 117.5 || 112.5 || 117.5 || ~~120~~ || 117.5 || ~~145~~ || 145 || 155 || 155 || 390 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 102.60 || 112.5 || 117.5 || 120 || 120 || 110 || ~~115~~ || 115 || 115 || 145 || 150 || ~~155~~ || 150 || 385 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 98.28 || 107.5 || 115 || ~~117.5~~ || 115 || 105 || ~~112.5~~ || 112.5 || 112.5 || 150 || ~~155~~ || 155 || 155 || 382.5 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 101.04 || 115 || 120 || 122.5 || 122.5 || 105 || 110 || ~~112.5~~ || 110 || 140 || 145 || ~~147.5~~ || 145 || 377.5 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 105.25 || 112.5 || 117.5 || ~~122.5~~ || 117.5 || 107.5 || ~~112.5~~ || 112.5 || 112.5 || ~~140~~ || 140 || 145 || 145 || 375 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 96.87 || 105 || ~~110~~ || ~~110~~ || 105 || 105 || 110 || 112.5 || 112.5 || 140 || 150 || 155 || 155 || 372.5 |- | 10 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 97.00 || 112.5 || ~~117.5~~ || 117.5 || 117.5 || 105 || ~~110~~ || ~~110~~ || 105 || 135 || 140 || ~~142.5~~ || 140 || 362.5 |- | 11 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 101.08 || 100 || ~~105~~ || ~~105~~ || 100 || 107.5 || ~~112.5~~ || 112.5 || 112.5 || 145 || ~~152.5~~ || ~~152.5~~ || 145 || 357.5 |- | 12 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 115.70 || 110 || ~~115~~ || ~~115~~ || 110 || 105 || 110 || ~~112.5~~ || 110 || 130 || 137.5 || ~~145~~ || 137.5 || 357.5 |- | 13 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 95.34 || 110 || ~~115~~ || ~~115~~ || 110 || 97.5 || 102.5 || ~~107.5~~ || 102.5 || 130 || 135 || ~~140~~ || 135 || 347.5 |- | 14 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 84.35 || 95 || 102.5 || ~~105~~ || 102.5 || 100 || ~~107.5~~ || ~~107.5~~ || 100 || 125 || ~~130~~ || ~~130~~ || 125 || 327.5 |- | 15 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 86.15 || 90 || 95 || 97.5 || 97.5 || 90 || 95 || 97.5 || 97.5 || 120 || 125 || ~~127.5~~ || 125 || 320 |- | 16 ||align=left|Dandamudi Rajagopal ||align=left| || 91.70 || 87.5 || 92.5 || ~~95~~ || 92.5 || 85 || 90 || ~~92.5~~ || 90 || 112.5 || 117.5 || 122.5 || 122.5 || 305 |} ==New records== {|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- | Press |137.5 kg |align=left| | |- | Snatch |137.5 kg |align=left| | |- |Clean & Jerk |177.5 kg |align=left| |, |- |Total |452.5 kg |align=left| | |} ==References== Category:Weightlifting at the 1948 Summer Olympics ",
