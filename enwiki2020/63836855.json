    "text": "NIRA Intense Import Drag Racing is a drag racing simulation video game developed and published by Bethesda Softworks. ==Reception== IGN rated the game a 7 of 10 saying \"Overall, the game designers did a good job with NIRA Intense Import Drag Racing. I didn't like it quite as much as Burnout: Championship Drag Racing, but it was fun and it did keep me coming back for more, at least for a while. The only big problem with the game is the graphics and sound aren't up to par with other modern racers, and that it's a niche title that appeals to hardcore drag racing fans and may alienate the average gamer who's just looking for some quick fun. Intense Import does have a high learning curve, so expect to spend some time exploring all of the aspects of the game. But if you do have the patience for it, you'll be rewarded with a drag racing game that's surprisingly fun and entertaining.\" Stephen Poole of GameSpot rated the game a 6.4 of 10 saying \"However, it turns out that NIRA Intense Import Drag Racing is little more than an add-on pack for Hot Rod Championship Drag Racing designed to run as a stand-alone product. I'm thankful that Bethesda at least kept the sticker price low ($19.95), but the bottom line is that everything that had kept Hot Rod from introducing drag racing to the gaming masses is still alive and kicking in this latest incarnation\". ==References== Category:Bethesda Softworks games Category:1999 video games Category:XnGine games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows- only games ",
