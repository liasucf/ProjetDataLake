It is the culmination of Nikon's rangefinder development which started in 1948 with the Nikon I, and was \"arguably the most advanced rangefinder of its time.\" Nikon SP It was manufactured by the Japanese optics company Nippon Kogaku K. K. (Nikon Corporation since 1988).http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/discontinue/filmcamera.htm#rangefinder. Further development of Nikon's S series ended with the introduction and success of the Nikon F. In 2005 2,500 models of a repro model were manufactured under the name of \"Nikon SP Limited Edition\". The camera was exclusively sold in Japan and came with a (modern multi-coated) W-Nikkor 3.5 cm f/1.8 lens.Nikon SP Limited Edition, by Nikon ==Features== The Nikon SP has dual viewfinders providing frame lines for a total of six focal lengths. The main viewfinder has 1x magnification and has frame lines for 50 mm, 85 mm, 105 mm and 135 mm (selected by rotating a dial under the rewind crank). The frames are parallax-corrected and the focusing patch appears in the centre of the viewfinder. A separate, smaller viewfinder (less than life size) to the left of the main viewfinder has non-parallax corrected frame lines for 35 mm. The entire window acts as a frame for 28 mm lenses. The camera uses Nikon's 'S' bayonet lens mount which is a modified Contax 'C' bayonet and Contax 'C' lenses are physically compatible but do not accurately focus with the built-in rangefinder. In common with Contax, a small toothed wheel in front of the shutter release is used to focus lenses that use the internal bayonet. The camera does not have a flash sync on its hot shoe. Instead a pc sync socket is provided. The shutter on early models is a horizontally running mechanically timed rubberized silk fabric curtain. In 1959 the shutter curtain was changed to titanium similar to the Nikon F. The camera will advance film at a rate of 3 FPS with an added S-36 motor drive. This made the SP the first rangefinder to have motorized film advance.
