    "text": "North American Neuromodulation Society is a scientific organization that serves to promote and advance neuromodulation as a treatment for various diseases. ==History== NANS was founded in 1994 as the American Neuromodulation Society. It was renamed the North American Neuromodulation Society in 1999. ===American Neuromodulation Society=== The American Neuromodulation Society was the brain-child of Ballard Wright, MD and Barry N. Strauss, MD. Dr. Wright was largely responsible for incorporating and establishing ANS as a non-profit organization in the United States. In the early days, with Dr. Wright volunteering to be the initial Executive Director, the society offices operated through his offices in Lexington, Kentucky. The organization briefly changed its acronym to ANmS to avoid confusion because a company previously named Neuromed adopted the ANS acronym. ===Today=== Now based in Chicago, NANS developed out of the American Neuromodulation Society and has evolved into a national organization whose membership has grown to more than 800 members, signifying growing interest in this specialty. The majority of these members are working in pain-related disciplines, although members in areas such as epilepsy, urinary incontinence, angina, and movement disorders are also represented. Medical specialties represented in the membership include anesthesiology, neurosurgery, neurology, PM&R;, gastroenterology, urology and basic science. In addition, NANS has taken active part in opening forums for presenting the work of those who deal with functional electrical stimulation for patients with tetraplegia (quadriplegia) and paraplegia or paralysis due to brain injury and stroke. Approximately 800-1000 participants attended the annual scientific meeting at the Wynn Las Vegas. The official journal of NANS' parent organization the International Neuromodulation Society and its chapters is Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface. Published eight times per year, the journal is MEDLINE-indexed. ==Presidents== * 1994\u20131998: Michael Stanton-Hicks * 1998\u20132001: John C.

The American Neuromodulation Society independently formed in 1994 and later joined the International Neuromodulation Society as its North American Chapter. ===INS chapter societies worldwide=== * Argentinean Neuromodulation Society (SANE) * Neuromodulation Society of Australia and New Zealand * Benelux Neuromodulation Society * Brazilian Neuromodulation Society * Canadian Neuromodulation Society * Chinese Neuromodulation Society * French Neuromodulation Society * German Neuromodulation Society * The Neuromodulation Society of India * Italian Neuromodulation Society * Japan Neuromodulation Society * Korean Neuromodulation Society * Nordic Neuromodulation Society * North American Neuromodulation Society * Polish Neuromodulation Society * South African Neuromodulation Society * Southeast European Neuromodulation Society * Spanish Neuromodulation Society * Swiss Neuromodulation Society * Turkish Neuromodulation Society * The Neuromodulation Society of the United Kingdom and Ireland ==External links== * North American Neuromodulation Society * International Neuromodulation Society ==References== Category:Neurology organizations Category:Medical and health organizations based in Kentucky ",
