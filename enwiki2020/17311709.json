Released as the second single from their eponymous album, the song was one of the summer hits in France and was the trio's most successful single in terms of ranks on the chart. In 2011, M. Pokora covered the song on his album Mise \u00e0 Jour and released it as a single, which achieved some success in French-speaking countries. The trio also released an English version, To The Deeds We Missed. ==Music and lyrics== The song was written and produced by Jean-Jacques Goldman. It was described by Elia Habib, an expert of French charts, as having \"a lively melody with African accents, [it] celebrates in its lyrics the small failures of the everyday life with a lot of tenderness and humor\". The refrain is performed by Carole Fredericks, while the verses are sung in turn by Jean-Jacques Goldman and Michael Jones. In interviews, Goldman explained that the music was inspired by his travel in the Antilles, where he discovered the zouk. According to him, the song had \"sad lyrics with a bright music\".\"\u00c0 nos actes manqu\u00e9s\" Parler-de-sa-vie.net (Retrieved May 7, 2008) The song is the eighth track on the album Fredericks Goldman Jones.
