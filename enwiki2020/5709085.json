    "text": "Noida Film City houses the Asian Academy of Film & Television and Marwah Films & Video Studios along with prominent news channels from India. It is located in Sector 16-A Noida, India. It was founded in 1988 by Sandeep Marwah, an Indian film producer, founder and chairperson of AAFT. ==Features== Owing to its proximity to Doordarshan (the Prasar Bharti transmission headquarters in New Delhi) and a large number of private broadcasting and transmitting stations that have moved to the NCR region, the Film City has become a first choice for shooting television serials, news and other entertainment-cum- education programs. The Film City is a gateway to Noida's twin brother, Greater Noida, which has developed as an ultra-modern industrial township, evincing interest from large globally established multinational corporations and other corporate houses promising international standards of living. Large- scale activity in all these studios, outdoor locales provided by the Film City, and the twin cities of Noida and Greater Noida have put it on the world map of filmmaking. For the wide range of news, views, and current affairs programs being shot there, the Film City continues to attract a host of politicians, bureaucrats, and celebrities from practically every walk of life, making it one of the most sought-after centers of VIP visits. Foreign delegations and filmmakers from abroad are drawn to the Film City for their interest in studying its success story and for exploring the possibilities of collaborative joint ventures and culture exchange programs with the like- minded Indian media houses there. ==Corporate offices== Corporate office of companies and television channels in the Film City include: * News World India * Indian School of Communicative Arts (ISCA- School of Media Studies) INOX TOWERS * Jubilant Life Sciences Ltd. / Jubilant Industries Ltd. * NTPC Limited.
