His parents divorced when he was young, and he did not graduate from high school. A fan of stand-up comedy since he was a child, Vos was influenced by watching it on television, particularly acts featured on The Ed Sullivan Show. ==Career== Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour in 2006 Vos began his stand-up career in 1984, choosing to pursue it full-time as he \"failed at everything else\", and developed his act in local clubs. In 1995, Vos became the first white comic to perform a set on Def Comedy Jam on HBO, a show usually featuring African American comedians. In July 1999, Vos hosted the Woodstock '99 festival, later calling it a highlight of his career. In 2001, Vos played the bouncer and wrote and performed skits on the British television show The People vs. Jerry Sadowitz. In 2001, Vos released a stand- up comedy album, I'm Killing Here. This was followed by the DVD Vos, consisting of an unedited, 55-minute performance recorded at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey, released in 2004. He went on to produce two half-hour specials on Comedy Central Presents. In 2003, Vos came third on the first season of Last Comic Standing on NBC. During this time he was given the nickname \"The Don\" by Cory Kahaney \"because of my rough and tough demeanor ... maybe it was more because I was the most experienced comic\". At the end of the season, Vos toured with Kahaney and Dave Mordal for eight months. In 2004, Vos was a finalist in its third season. Vos was a frequent guest on the Opie and Anthony radio show, with jokes centered at his expense, most often highlighting his speech impediment or supposed lack of intellect. In 2002, he brought comedian Patrice O'Neal onto the show who also became a popular regular guest. During the show's time on Sirius XM Satellite Radio, Vos hosted a Saturday night program with Bonnie McFarlane. He hosted the 2006 and 2007 editions of the Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour. From 2002 to 2004, Vos was a frequent guest on Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn on Comedy Central. He picked the show as one of his favourites to do as he lived close to its filming location and by the fact that he could do it with his best friends. Between 2006 and 2008, Vos prepared three pilot episodes for a comedy series alongside McFarlane, but neither were picked up by a network. Vos has appeared on Premium Blend. He was featured in a segment of the television show, What Would You Do?

In December 2016, Vos released his fifth comedy album V, of which its material took between one year and a half and two years to develop. It charted at number one on the iTunes and Billboard release charts. == Personal life == After struggling with crack cocaine and alcohol addiction throughout his 20s, Vos completed a one-month rehabilitation course in 1987, three years into his comedy career. He has been clean since. Vos was previously in a marriage that ended in a divorce. He has two daughters with his previous wife, and remained in their lives. He moved into a home two miles away from them so he could see them more. In September 2005, Vos married comedian Bonnie McFarlane, who competed on the second season of Last Comic Standing. In 2007 they had a daughter.
