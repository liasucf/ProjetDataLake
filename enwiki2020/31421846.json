Safa, \"BAHMANJANA\" in Encyclopedia Iranica It takes place on the 2nd day of Bahman. https://www.samita.com/en/blog/the-most-amazing-ancient- persian-festivals ==Festival== In the old Zoroastrian calendar, when the day of the month coincides with the name of the month, then a feast (Persian: Jashn) was held. In this case, the month of Bahman which was the 11th month coincides with the day of Bahman (Bahman-r\u016bz). Bahman is one of the archangels of Zoroastrianism. Henceforth, for each such a day in the calendar, the Middle Persian names of these were formed by addition of the suffix ag\u0101n (association suffix and also a plural suffix) to the day-name. Festivities to celebrate the day took place among both the common people as well as the people associated with the courts. The festival is recorded by many authors including Biruni, Gardizi, Asadi Tusi, Anwari etc. According to Biruni and Gardizi, in Khorasan, an assortment of meat and all sorts of grain, vegetables, and fruits were cooked together in a pot called d\u012bg-e Bahmanjana (the pot of Bahmanag\u0101n). The population cooked this dish, treated each other to this dish and also it was widely sold on the Bazar. According to Gardizi, the flowers of the plant named the red-Bahman (Persian: Bahman-e Sorkh) were mixed with fresh milk. He further continues that the people believed it to beneficial for the memory as well to keep away the evil eye.\u02bfAbd al-\u1e24ayy \u1e24ab\u012bb\u012b, \"Tarikh-e Gardizi\", Tehran, 1347 \u0160./1968. It was usual to wear new clothes for this festival. Today, the modern day Zoroastrian-Iranian festival of Bahmanr\u016bz continues to be an especially holy day for Zoroastrians of Iran. ===Bahman Plant=== This plant is the same as the equivalent modern Persian term zardak-e \u1e63a\u1e25r\u0101\u02be\u012b (a wild carrot), which blooms in the month of Bahman (January\u2013February). It has a red or white root. Since it was a medical plant, it is mentioned in Arabic medical texts from which it passed into Latin and in the form b\u00e9hen into French. Two varieties, b\u00e9hen rouge and b\u00e9hen blanc, are found and still used in medicine. ==Notes== ==References== * Ab\u016b Ray\u1e25\u0101n B\u012br\u016bn\u012b, al-Tafh\u012bm le-aw\u0101\u02beel \u1e63en\u0101\u02bfat al-tanj\u012bm, 2nd ed., Tehran Category:Festivals in Iran Category:January observances Category:February observances ",
