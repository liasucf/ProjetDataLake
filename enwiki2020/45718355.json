    "text": "Leccinellum corsicum is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. It grows in mycorrhizal symbiosis exclusively with rockroses (Cistus species) in Mediterranean Europe and North Africa. The fungus was originally described as new to science in 1896 by French mycologist L\u00e9on Louis Rolland as a species of Boletus. Andreas Bresinsky and Manfred Binder transferred it to the newly circumscribed genus Leccinellum in 2003. The bolete is edible, and is especially appreciated in Portugal. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Edible fungi Category:Fungi described in 1896 Category:Fungi of Africa Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Boletaceae ",
