Dr. Gabriele Rosa noticed him and convinced him to run the 1500 metres. Five months later he won the Olympic bronze medal. His personal best time in the 1500 metres was 3:31.87 minutes, achieved in July 1996 in Lausanne. His last international competition took place in 2001. After his brief athletic career he became a professional soldier. He also owned a farm near Sugoi, an area close to Eldoret in which were living other athletes: Moses Tanui, Joyce Chepchumba and her husband Aron, and David Kiptoo. Kipkorir was killed in a military vehicle crash on the road between Nakuru and Eldoret. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1970 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Kenyan male middle-distance runners Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Kenya Category:Olympic athletes of Kenya Category:Road incident deaths in Kenya Category:Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists in athletics (track and field) ",
