    "text": "Star transits (Reticle 2\u00b0, magnif. ~10, two stars passing the vertical thread). Timing accuracy may be \u00b10,5 s. A star transit is the passage of a star across the field of view of a telescope eyepiece. The precise observation of star transits is the basis of many methods in astronomy and in geodesy. The measurements can be done in different ways: # visually (mostly up to 1990): accuracy 0,1\" to 2\" (depending on the instrument); timing with digital clocks about 0,05\u20130,2 seconds # by CCD and other electro-optical sensors: as above, time often better # semi automatic instruments: Photography or \"impersonal micrometer\", ca. 2 times better than No.1 # by Scanning methods: Astrometry satellites like Hipparcos about 0,01\". ==See also== * Accuracy and precision * Instrument error * Meridian circle * Minute and second of arc * Theodolite * Transit instrument ==Literature== * Karl Ramsayer, 1969: Geod\u00e4tische Astronomie, Vol.2a of Handbuch der Vermessungskunde, 900 p., J.B.Metzler- Verlag Stuttgart. * Ivan I.
