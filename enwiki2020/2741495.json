    "text": "BUKO Pharma-Kampagne is an independent organization based in Bielefeld, Germany, which watches over the marketing practices of German pharmaceutical companies. It has gained wider recognition after being described in a bestselling novel, The Constant Gardener by John le Carr\u00e9. BUKO was mentioned explicitly in the author's afterword as a real counterpart to the novel's fictitious Hippo organisation (also based in Bielefeld, Germany). BUKO is partially financed by the European Union and mostly by private supporters. In early 1981 following a conference in Geneva, co-sponsored by the International Organization of Consumers Unions and by BUKO, it set up Health Action International. ==See also== *The Constant Gardener \u2013 the movie (2005) by Fernando Meirelles *World Health Organization Research Ethics Review Committee ==References== *BUKO Homepage *Health Action International Category:Pharmaceutical industry Category:Medical and health organisations based in North Rhine-Westphalia ",
