    "text": "The 2018 Scottish Challenge Cup Final, also known as the IRN-BRU Cup Final for sponsorship reasons, was a football match that took place on 24 March 2018 at McDiarmid Park, between Dumbarton and Inverness Caledonian Thistle. It was the 27th final of the Scottish Challenge Cup since it was first organised in 1990 to celebrate the centenary of the now defunct Scottish Football League, and the fifth since the SPFL was formed. The match was won by Inverness CT 1-0 with a stoppage time winner, marking their second win in the tournament since its inception and their first silverware since the 2014\u201315 Scottish Cup. ==Route to the final== The competition is a knock-out tournament and was contested by 56 teams from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in 2017-18. Two teams from the Republic of Ireland were added to the competition in 2017-18, following the addition of teams from Wales and Northern Ireland in 2016-17. Those participating were the 30 clubs that played in the 2017\u201318 Championship, League One and League Two of the Scottish Professional Football League along with the top four teams from the 2016\u201317 Highland and Lowland Leagues. The top two teams from the 2016\u201317 Welsh Premier League and 2016\u201317 NIFL Premiership and the U20s squads of the teams competing in the 2016\u201317 Premiership were also invited to compete.
