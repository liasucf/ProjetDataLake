New York county manager Seamus Sweeney, whose team nearly defeated Galway in the 2010 Connacht Senior Football Championship, first became involved in U.S. football after emigrating to Boston as an 18-year-old in the early 1990s, and played for Donegal Boston. They won their first Boston Senior Football Championship title in 2002. In the 2002 final they scored a late goal from a 21-yard free. They won the Boston Junior Football Championship in 2005. In 2008, they won the Boston Junior Football Championship and were Boston Senior Football Championship finalists. They won the 2015 North-East Men's Senior Football Championship. They won the 2018 Boston Senior Football Championship. They did so with Dublin All-Ireland winner Diarmuid Connolly, whose transfer stateside was covered by media nationally in Ireland.
