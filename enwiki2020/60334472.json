Referred to as \"Tiger Mum\" on The Chase, Toh has said, \"My family likes the nickname. It was either me or my father who first suggested it. Many women, especially in the Asian community, regard it as a compliment to be called a 'tiger mum'. For me, I am having a bit of a laugh at myself.\" == References == == External links == Category:Living people Category:Contestants on Australian game shows Category:Australian lawyers Category:Australian television personalities Category:Quiz championship players Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
