GERBRANDIJ, Pieter (1885\u20131961) ==Early life== Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy was born on 13 April 1885 in the village of Go\u00ebnga near Sneek, in the province of Friesland, in the Netherlands. He was an ethnic Frisian, and his name is styled in the traditional Frisian way: first name (\"Pieter\"), patronymic (\"Sjoerds\", meaning \"son of Sjoerd\"), family name (Gerbrandy). Incidentally, the name Gerbrandy is also a patronymic; his great-great-grandfather Jouke Gerbrens (1769-1840) took 'Gerbrandy\u2019 as a family name on 30 December 1811.see www.tresoar.nl, under Familinamen 1811 Pieter applied to Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in June 1904, majoring in Law. He would obtain a doctorate in Law in January 1911, and proceeded to work as a lawyer and prosecutor from 1911 until 1920. ==Politics== Pieter was a member of the Municipal Council of Sneek from April 1916 until January 1930, the Provincial-Council of Friesland from July 1919 until August 1920, and the Provincial-Executive of Friesland from August 1920 until January 1930. From 1920 to 1930, he was a member of the States of Friesland for the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP). He also served as Minister of Justice in 1939, against his party's wishes. ===World War II=== Due to the German victory of the Battle of the Netherlands in 1940, the Dutch royal family and many leading politicians fled to London and formed a government-in- exile. This, combined with Dirk Jan de Geer's resignation the same year, resulted in Queen Wilhelmia appointing Gerbrandy as prime minister of the Dutch government-in-exile. He also served as Minister of Justice and Minister of Colonial Affairs. ===Postwar=== After the liberation of the south in 1945, Gerbrandy formed a new cabinet, but resigned after the total liberation of the Netherlands. He opposed the government's \"Indonesian policy\", and from 1946 to 1950 chaired the National Committee for the Maintenance of the Kingdom's Unity, which opposed Indonesian independence and advocated for the Republic of the South Moluccas. In 1950, Gerbrandy published Indonesia, which offered an explanation of the history of the relationship between the Netherlands and Indonesia, then the Dutch East Indies, from the 1600s to the 1948, which included \"The Indies under Dutch rule\", \"The Rule of Law\", \"The Japanese Occupation\", and \"Chaos\", with each section outlining Gerbrandy's observations.Gerbrandy, P.

In 1956, he was made member of a commission that investigated the affair surrounding Greet Hofmans. 3 years later, Gerbrandy would resign as a member of Parliament. ==Personal life== On 18 May 1911, Gerbrandy married Hendrina Elisabeth Sikkel (26 February 1886 \u2013 4 May 1980).https://www.genealogieonline.nl/stambom- kok/I24714.php Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy died on 7 September 1961 in The Hague, at the age of 76. ==Decorations== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\" |- style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\" | colspan=5 |Honours |- ! style=\"width:80px;\"| Ribbon bar !!
