    "text": "Anne Gillespie Shaw (28 May 1904 \u2013 4 February 1982) was a Scottish engineer and businesswoman. Shaw specialised in time and motion study. She began her own consulting company, the Anne Shaw Organisation Ltd., in 1945. ==Life and career== Shaw was born in Uddingston, Scotland, on 28 May 1904 to David Perston Shaw and Helen Brown Shaw MBE who became MP for Bothwell in 1931. She attended St Leonard's School in St Andrews and Laurel Bank School in Glasgow. She went on to study at the University of Edinburgh before studying for her postgraduate certificate at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Shaw met Dr Lillian Gilbreth at Bryn Mawr College and became Gilbreth's research assistant in the field of Motion Study. Shaw then began working at Gilbreth, Inc. until 1930 when she returned to the UK. She became a personal officer at Metropolitan-Vickers before becoming chief supervisor of women workers in 1933 and was the company's chief motion-study investigator between 1930 and 1945. She was also a consultant to the Associated Electrical Industries group of which Metropolitan-Vickers was a part. Shaw joined the Women's Engineering Society in 1935, and during the thirteenth annual conference of the Women's Engineering Society, Shaw gave a presentation on her study of motion at the Science Museum in Kensington, London. In late 1936, Shaw helped produce a film which demonstrated the application of motion study concerning food preparation in the home. On 31 May 1937, she was selected by the National Institute of Industrial Psychology to lecture on modern developments in the study of time and motion. On 26 November 1937, at the Metropolitan-Vickers Debating Society, Shaw served as an opponent of a motion \"That the Introduction of Female Apprentices to these works is to be deplored\". As a result of her opposing voice and the speech of Dorothy Garfitt, a recently accepted apprentice, the motion lost by a margin of 17 votes. Shaw married John H. Pirie in 1937 and they had three children. Shaw was recruited by the Minister of Aircraft Production, Stafford Cripps, in 1942 and during World War II, she worked on the Production Efficiency Board as an adviser to the aircraft industry. In 1945, Shaw started the Anne Shaw Organisation Ltd. of which she was the chairman and managing director until 1975. Between 1964 and 1979, she was also the director of Wescot Ltd. ==Death and legacy== Shaw died on 4 February 1982 in Macclesfield, Cheshire, aged 77. In 2017, Shaw was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame. ==Publications== She published \u201cAn Introduction to the Theory and Application of Motion Study\" in 1944, \"The Full Application of Motion Study\" in 1950, and \"The Purpose and Practice of Motion Study\" in 1952. ==External links== * Portrait of Anne Gillespie Shaw by Madame Yvonde - National Gallery ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Scottish engineers Category:People from Uddingston Category:People educated at St Leonards School Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Bryn Mawr College alumni Category:Metropolitan-Vickers people Category:20th-century British engineers Category:20th-century women engineers Category:Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame inductees Category:Members of the Women's Engineering Society Category:Women's Engineering Society Category:Engineers Category:Women engineers ",
