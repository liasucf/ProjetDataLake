The Marine base was established on and around N\u00f4ng S\u01a1n mountain, a 200m high hill. At the base of the mountain a reinforced platoon was dug in, a second reinforced platoon occupied the middle level and the third platoon with M40 recoilless rifles and 4.2 inch mortars occupied the mountaintop. On the night of 3/4 July 1967 an estimated 400 People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) attacked the base almost completely overrunning the Marine positions on the summit. The attack was beaten back with the loss of 13 U.S. dead and 42 PAVN. Marine PFC Melvin E. Newlin would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions that night. Following the evacuation of Kh\u00e2m \u0110\u1ee9c in May 1968, Detachment A-105, 5th Special Forces Group relocated their base to N\u00f4ng S\u01a1n adjacent to the Firebase. In July 1974 the base, now known as Da Trach, was occupied by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 74th Ranger Battalion. The 74th Rangers were scheduled to be replaced by the 3rd Battalion, 56th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division who had arrived at Da Trach on 17 July. Shortly after midnight on 18 July the PAVN began bombarding Da Trach and the surrounding outposts at the start of the Battle of Duc Duc. Despite air and artillery support, PAVN ground assaults penetrated the base and by the afternoon of 18 July the ARVN had abandoned the base to the PAVN. The ARVN attempted to recover Da Trach but these attempts were abandoned by 25 July after the ARVN had suffered heavy losses. ==Current use== The base is abandoned and has reverted to jungle. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province Category:Military installations of the United States Marine Corps in South Vietnam Category:Installations of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Category:Military installations closed in the 1970s ",
