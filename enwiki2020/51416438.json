The remains have been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, accessible to the public. This is not to be confused with Cullen House or Castle of Cullen of Buchan. There is also a ruin of a Cullen Castle in County Waterford, Ireland. ==History== Elizabeth de Burgh, the wife of Robert the Bruce died here, although it has been suggested this was at an earlier castle. Vestiges of the castle remained until the 19th century.Coventry, Martin (2001). The Castles of Scotland. Musselburgh: Goblinshead. p. 138 ==Structure== It is believed that the castle, on Castle Hill, was a motte, encircled by a wide ditch and outer rampart, except on the north where a landslip has destroyed it. The ditch is about wide and deep; the outer bank is about wide and high. The mound of the motte has been covered by a network of ancient paths. Excavations were conducted in February\u2013October 2017 to restore parts of the network and minimise erosion. Eight test pits were dug of which seven located the main path. The other one was dug in an area less disturbed by foot traffic and did not locate the path despite being excavated to a depth of . Foundation bases for picnic tables and benches and a replacement flagpole socket were installed during the excavations. No finds or features of archaeological interest were found. ==References== Category:Castles in Moray Category:Former castles in Scotland ",
