The plague of 1619 drove him from his new home, and while in Gaza, where he found refuge, he wrote his Kabalistic work Chesed le-Abraham (Mercy to Abraham; Book of Micah vii.20). It was published after the author's death by Meshullam Zalman ben Abraham Berak of Gorice, in Amsterdam, 1685. The work is a treatise with an introduction, (The Cornerstone; see Talmud Yoma 53b), and is divided into seven \"fountains\" (Book of Zechariah iii.9), each fountain being subdivided into a number of \"streams.\" A specimen of the work Chesed Le- Avraham, taken from the fifth fountain, twenty-fourth stream, p. 57d, of the Amsterdam edition: A popular story about Rabbi Azulai is that of how he retrieved the sultan's sword.
