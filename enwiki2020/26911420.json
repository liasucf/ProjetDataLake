Anciently Fishwick was a possession of Coldingham Priory a cell of the Bishopric of Durham. The superiorities of the Priory became part of the Barony of Coldingham which in 1621 was held by James, 2nd Earl of Home (d. 1633).Historical Manuscripts Commission, MSS of Col. David Milne Home of Wedderburn, HMSO, London, 1902, pps:198, 203-4. A William Purves was a resident in Fishwick in Nov 1577 when he witnessed a Sasine.Hist.MSS.1902, p.208. Just south of the Tweed from Fishwick is the northernmost village in England, Horncliffe. Between Fishwick and Horncliffe is the famous Union Bridge, a very early suspension bridge dating from 1820. When it was opened it was the longest wrought-iron suspension bridge in the world, and it is still carrying traffic, though now only one vehicle at a time. One of the toll cottages was demolished in 1955. The crossing is now toll-free. ==Notes== Category:Villages in the Scottish Borders Category:Berwickshire ",
