Sterner from newmexicohistory.org accessed December 28, 2016. Due to the lowering of the water table by wells drilled for water in the Jornada del Muerto basin since the time of the American Civil War, the old Ojo del Muerto dried up. Lower strata found in McRae Canyon still produce a similar spring just below the confluence of Ca\u00f1on del Muerto with McRae Canyon. == References == Category:Camino Real de Tierra Adentro Category:Jornada del Muerto Category:Springs of New Mexico ",
