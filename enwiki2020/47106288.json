Thirty-seven All-Star Games have been held since the Washington Capitals entered the league in 1974, with at least one player chosen to represent the Capitals in each year. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, and 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games. Washington has hosted one of the games. The 34th took place at the Capital Centre. * Selected by fan vote * Selected as one of four \"last men in\" by fan vote * Selected by Commissioner {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Washington Capitals players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game2014\u201315 Washington Capitals Official Guide, p.275 |- !scope=\"col\" | Game !scope=\"col\" | Year !scope=\"col\" | Name !scope=\"col\" | Position !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References |- ! scope=\"row\" | 28th |1975 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 29th |1976 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 30th |1977 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 31st |1978 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 32nd |1980 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 33rd |1981 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 34th |1982 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 35th |1983 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 36th |rowspan=\"2\" |1984 | (Did not play) | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 37th |rowspan=\"4\" |1985 | | |rowspan=\"4\" | |- | | |- | | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 38th |rowspan=\"2\" |1986 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 39th |1988 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 40th |rowspan=\"2\" |1989 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 41st |1990 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 42nd |1991 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 43rd |rowspan=\"3\" |1992 | | |rowspan=\"3\" | |- | | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 44th |rowspan=\"2\" |1993 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 45th |1994 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 46th |1996 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 47th |rowspan=\"2\" |1997 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 48th |rowspan=\"2\" |1998 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 49th | 1999 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 50th |2000 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 51st |2001 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 52nd |rowspan=\"2\" |2002 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 53rd |rowspan=\"2\" |2003 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 54th |2004 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 55th |2007 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 56th |2008 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 57th |2009 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 58th |rowspan=\"2\" |2011 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 59th |rowspan=\"2\" |2012 | (Did not play) | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 60th |2015 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\"| 61st |rowspan=\"5\" |2016 | | |rowspan=\"5\" | |- | | |- | (Replaced Ovechkin) | |- | (Did not play) | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 62nd |rowspan=\"2\" |2017 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 63rd |rowspan=\"3\" |2018 | | |rowspan=\"3\" | |- | | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 64th |rowspan=\"4\" |2019 | | |rowspan=\"4\" | |- | | |- | (Did not play) | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\" | 65th |rowspan=\"5\" |2020 | | |rowspan=\"5\" | |- | | |- | | |- | (Did not play) | |- | | |} ===All-Star Game replacement events=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Washington Capitals players and coaches selected to All-Star Game replacement events |- !scope=\"col\" | Event !scope=\"col\" | Year !scope=\"col\" | Name !scope=\"col\" | Position !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References |- !scope=\"row\" | |1979 | (Did not play) | | |- !scope=\"row\" | |1987 | | | |} ==Career achievements== ===Hockey Hall of Fame=== The following is a list of Washington Capitals who have been enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Washington Capitals inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame2014\u201315 Washington Capitals Official Guide, p.274 ! scope=\"col\" |Individual ! scope=\"col\" |Category ! scope=\"col\" |Year inducted ! scope=\"col\" |Years with Capitals in category ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2010 |1989\u20131992 |, retrieved June 28, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2015 |2008\u20132009 |, retrieved November 10, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2001 |1979\u20131989 |, retrieved June 28, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2015 |1996\u20131998 |, retrieved November 10, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2002 |1982\u20131993 |, retrieved June 28, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2004 |1983\u20131989 |, retrieved June 28, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2012 |1997\u20132002 |, retrieved June 28, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2007 |1982\u20131990 |, retrieved June 28, 2015 |} ===Foster Hewitt Memorial Award=== One member of the Washington Capitals organization has been honored with the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award.
