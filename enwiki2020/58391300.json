    "text": "Jessie's Jig & Other Favorites is an album by singer/songwriter Steve Goodman, released in 1975. It was Goodman's first release on Asylum Records. Guests include Jethro Burns and Vassar Clements. ==Reception== Robert Christgau assigned it a \"B\" rating, indicating \"Very likable, bright and open and good humored, but like so many solo performers, folkies especially, he can't fill an album... his talent requires mood changes more conspicuous than so subtle an instrumentalist, or so thin a vocalist, can provide.\" In reviewing the 1999 reissue, Allmusic critic Sharon Witmer wrote \"The title cut is a rousing number on which Goodman is joined by a stellar cast of musicians... sounds like an old-timey hoedown. It did Steve Goodman proud and is a fitting way to remember this ephemeral, but brilliant shooting star in the musical firmament.\" ==Track listing== #\"Door Number Three\" (Jimmy Buffett, Steve Goodman) \u2013 3:40 #\"Blue Umbrella\" (John Prine) \u2013 3:54 #\"This Hotel Room\" (Goodman) \u2013 3:36 #\"Spoon River\" (Michael Peter Smith) \u2013 4:52 #\"Jessie's Jig (Rob's Romp, Beth's Bounce)\" (Goodman, Bill Swofford) \u2013 2:22 #\"It's a Sin to Tell a Lie\" (Billy Mayhew) \u2013 2:08 #\"I Can't Sleep\" (Goodman) \u2013 3:57 #\"Moby Book\" (Goodman, David Amran) \u2013 3:10 #\"Lookin' for Trouble\" (Goodman) \u2013 4:38 #\"Mama Don't Allow It\" (Sammy Cahn, Cow Cow Davenport) \u2013 4:35 == Personnel == *Steve Goodman \u2013 vocals, guitar *Jethro Burns \u2013 mandolin *Vassar Clements \u2013 fiddle *Carl Martin \u2013 mandolin, backing vocals *Hugh McDonald \u2013 bass, double bass *Howard Armstrong \u2013 fiddle *Ted Bogan \u2013 guitar *Sheldon Plotkin \u2013 drums, percussion *Bill Swofford \u2013 guitar, backing vocals *Winnie Winston \u2013 banjo, pedal steel guitar *Saul Broudy \u2013 harmonica, harp *Steve Burgh \u2013 guitar *John Burns \u2013 guitar *Jeff Gutcheon \u2013 piano, keyboards *Diane Holmes \u2013 backing vocals *Bonnie Koloc \u2013 backing vocals *Raun MacKinnon \u2013 backing vocals *Jack the Bear \u2013 trumpet *Ken Bloom \u2013 clarinet *Abby Newton \u2013 cello ===Production=== *Steve Goodman \u2013 producer, mixing *Hank Neuberger \u2013 engineer *Glen Christensen \u2013 art direction *Henry Diltz \u2013 photography ==References== Category:Steve Goodman albums Category:1975 albums Category:Asylum Records albums ",
