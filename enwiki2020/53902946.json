In the New Kingdom, Egyptian kings had conquered Lower Nubia. To secure control over the new region they appointed people of the local elite as governors. Miam (modern Aniba) was a town in Lower Nubia, a regional center and capital of the Nubian provinces. Here also resided the Chief of Miam. Heqanefer is known from his badly preserved rock cut tomb found at Toshka. Here he is depicted as Egyptian.William Kelly Simpson: Heka-Nefer and the Dynastic Material from Toshka and Arminna, New Haven and Philadelphia, 1963 Heqanefer is also depicted in the tomb Viceroy of Kush Amenhotep called Huy (TT40). Here he appears in a Nubian delegation and is shown fully as dark skinned Nubian in Nubian costume. N.d.G. Davies/A.H. Gardiner: The Tomb of Huy, Viceroy of Nubia in the Reign of Tutankhamun (no. 40) (The Theban Tombs Series, Memoir 4), London, 1926, pl. 26 The viceroy of Kush was evidently the highest official in the Nubian provinces, while Heqanefer was in the hierarchy under him.
