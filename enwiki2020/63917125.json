    "text": "Odundun I, otherwise known as Odundun Asodedero (Adegboro Adeagbo Osupa; c. 1820 \u2013 1890) was a Nigerian monarch. He ruled the Akure Kingdom from 1882 until 1890. His lineal descendants are today known as the House of Osupa/Odundun. They serve as one of Akure's two legally recognized royal families. ==Early life== Oba Odundun I was born as Prince Adegboro Adeagbo in Benin City around the year 1820. He was the son of Oba Osupa I, who ruled Akure from 1834 until 1846, and through him claimed hereditary kinship with all of the preceding rulers of both Akure and the neighbouring kingdoms of Ijeshaland and Ikereland. Two years before his birth, in 1818, the Kingdom of Benin had invaded his father's homeland and executed Oba Arakale, his paternal grandfather. The invaders spared his father however, who lived in Benin City for a long period of time and ultimately had Odundun. Through his paternal grandmother, who was a daughter of Oba Akengbuda of Benin, he also claimed direct descent from the imperial dynasty that had provided the Oba of Benin since the medieval period, and through it could therefore trace his lineage all the way back to antiquity. It was due to the fact that his grandmother was a Bini princess that his father Osupa \u2013 Akengbuda's grandson through her \u2013 had been spared during the invasion. ==Reign== Odundun returned to his homeland, Akure, when his father became king in 1834. His father died in 1846, and at some point, he married and had several children, including Prince Adegbite,http://heritageechonews.blogspot.com/2015/01/prince-abewaajoye- gbadeyanka-oluwole.html and a daughter, who was later expelled from the kingdom in the early 1890s. In 1882, the Deji of Akure, Oba Ojijigogun \u2013 who was his great uncle (as the younger brother of his father) \u2013 died. This created a vacancy in the office, and several eligible princes sought the throne, including Odundun and his cousins, the three sons of the deceased king: Arosoye, Ifaturoti, and Olofinlade.http://saharareporters.com/2014/01/07/daunting-task-akure-king- makers-dr-wumi-akintide Oba Odundun was selected and crowned shortly afterwards. One of the main things Oba Odundun I did was to sever the ties between Akure and Benin. When his father had become king in 1834, Akure began to pay a yearly tribute to the Benin Kingdom, and had continued doing so until Oba Odundun refused to pay it any longer. It is said that the officers that were sent to enforce control of Akure were oppressive and often raped and killed the people that they met there, so when Oba Odundun heard of this, he refused to pay the tribute anymore.http://saharareporters.com/2015/06/12/reasons-celebrate-his-royal- highness-new-deji-akure-odundun-ii-part-i-dr-wumi- akintidehttps://www.operanewsapp.com/ng/en/share/detail?news_id=3669e075f9ba1e20397b1a68f1dbed2b&news;_entry_id=s30b45b34200227en_ng&open;_type=transcoded&request;_id=DETAIL_EXPLORE_4641b340-7700-4ad5-a9a5-13d50f25d1e9&from;=news Benin was unable to react at the time, as they were fighting against the British occupation that would eventually culminate in the Benin Expedition of 1897.https://www.operanewsapp.com/ng/en/share/detail?news_id=3669e075f9ba1e20397b1a68f1dbed2b&news;_entry_id=s30b45b34200227en_ng&open;_type=transcoded&request;_id=DETAIL_EXPLORE_4641b340-7700-4ad5-a9a5-13d50f25d1e9&from;=news This act gave the Oba his oriki \"Asodedero,\" which means One who makes the town peaceful. Oba Odundun was known to be a brutal and ruthless tyrant, and is often compared to King Henry VIII of England, in that he swiftly executed one of his wives for sharing a joke with him in the bathroom.http://saharareporters.com/2015/06/12/reasons-celebrate-his-royal- highness-new-deji-akure-odundun-ii-part-i-dr-wumi-akintide ==Death and legacy== Oba Odundun I died in 1889 or 1890 at around the age of 70. After this, his father's direct lineage wouldn't produce another monarch for the duration of the succeeding century. His cousin Oba Arosoye became king, and when he died Prince Olofinlade, who had competed for the throne with him in 1882, succeeded. He ruled for the following 60 years as Oba Adesida I, thus establishing the Adesida dynasty that ruled Akure for 100 consecutive years. In the early 1990s, the Osupa family was recognized as one of the official ruling houses of the Akure Kingdom by the military administration of Ondo State. It has since provided two further monarchs, including current incumbent Oba Odundun II. A prominent member of the Osupa/Odundun royal family is Oloye Olu Falae, a descendant of Oba Odundun I's father Oba Osupa and Oba Odundun's great-great nephew. Falae was a civil servant and politician who served as secretary to the Government of the Federation during the administration of Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. He also ran for the office of the president of Nigeria following the resumption of democracy in 1999. Another one of his descendants include his great-grandson Ogunlade Aladetoyinbo Aladelusi, who later became the Deji of Akure, Oba Odundun II, the current king.https://www.medianigeria.com/biography-of-aladetoyinbo-ogunlade- aladelusi/ ==See also== * Oba of Benin * Ogiso * Akure Kingdom ==References== Category:19th-century Nigerian people Category:19th-century rulers in Africa Category:Nigerian royalty Category:Year of birth unknown Category:African royal families Category:Yoruba monarchs Category:19th-century monarchs in Africa ",
