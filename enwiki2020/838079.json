The ingredients are mixed in a drink blender or milkshake blender.Peter W. Smith, New England Country Store Cookbook, (iUniverse, 2003), pg. 146 , (accessed November 26, 2008 on Google Book Search) Among the famous Rhode Island creameries which serve them are Delekta's Pharmacy in Warren, and the Original Vanilla Bean in South Kingstown. Newport Creamery, a chain of family restaurants found almost exclusively in Rhode Island, serve a variation of cabinets made with ice milk under the brand name \"Awful Awful\".
