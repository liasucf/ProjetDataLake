    "text": "The Metro Streetcar, formerly known as the River Rail Streetcar, is a heritage streetcar system operating in Little Rock and North Little Rock in the U.S. state of Arkansas. It has operated since November 1, 2004. After the 2007 expansion of the system, the Metro Streetcar network totaled of track. The Metro Streetcar is operated by Rock Region Metro. ==History== By the 1890s, Little Rock had begun to grow out into the countryside of Pulaski County in large part due to the construction of a street railway system. Similar to many other cities in the South after the Civil War, Little Rock\u2019s lack of development attracted businessmen eager to take advantage of expected economic growth in real estate, banking, and other merchant ventures. Little Rock's first horsecar line (horse tramway) opened in 1876. The horsecars operated until 1895. Steam-powered streetcars operated between July 3, 1888, and 1889. The construction of street railways in the United States began to overlap with real estate and banking enterprises as the lines electrified in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Electric traction in Little Rock was introduced on December 23, 1891, after consolidation by a company formed to run the streetcar system exclusively. Eventually, that company was bought by Arkansas Power & Light. Electric streetcars operated until September 1, 1947, extending as far west as the city's Hillcrest and Stifft's Station neighborhoods. Streetcar crossing the Arkansas River What is now named the Metro Streetcar opened on November 1, 2004, as the River Rail Streetcar, operated by the Central Arkansas Transit Authority. Phase I consisted of a single long line that connects two cities, Little Rock and North Little Rock, situated on opposite sides of the Arkansas River. The line carried 200,000 passengers in its first year of operation. In January 2006, construction began on Phase II, which was a extension to the William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Heifer International headquarters. This section opened on February 16, 2007, with a ribbon cutting by Pulaski County Judge Buddy Villines, Little Rock Mayor Mark Stodola, and North Little Rock Mayor Pat Hays. The extension increased the length of the line by about 33%, making the total mileage . In 2015, the Central Arkansas Transit Authority changed its name to Rock Region Metro, and in line with this rebranding, the River Rail Streetcar was renamed the Metro Streetcar. ==Expansion== Additional extensions to the system are under discussion, the most ambitious of which is a extension to Little Rock National Airport. If the expansion is completed, the status of the line could take on a role as some form of light rail line, instead of its current role as a heritage trolley. The proposed extension, among others in Savannah and Tampa, is considered a hybrid form of transport known as \"rapid streetcar\". The expansion of the River Rail Streetcar line, turning it into a more effective rail rapid transit line, would be the first example of such a system in the United States. ==Rolling stock== Metro Streetcar initially used three replica vintage electric trolleys. Two more streetcars were added as a part of the new Phase II extension. The design of these cars is generally similar to Birney-type streetcars used in Little Rock until after World War II. The original number series for those cars was 400\u2013407. The present cars continue that number series, albeit 60 years later, with the current cars being numbered 408\u2013412. All of the cars in the present fleet were manufactured by the Gomaco Trolley Company. ==Operation== The Metro Streetcar begins operations at approximately 8:30 a.m. Monday through Saturdays and at 10 a.m. Sundays, while it ends at approximately 10 p.m. Monday through Wednesdays, midnight on Fridays and Saturdays and at 5:30 p.m. on Sundays. It consists of two lines: the Blue Line and the Green Line. The Blue Line operates seven days a week, with extended service on Friday and Saturday nights and runs between Little Rock and North Little Rock, while the Green Line operates six days a week only with no Sunday service and runs in a circulator. Frequencies per line consist of 25-minute headways during the day, with 20-minute headways during evening and night-and- weekend service periods. ==Stations== The trolley stops at many downtown attractions, from the Clinton Library to the historic River Market. The stops include the Marriott Hotel, Heifer Intl., and the Historic Arkansas Museum. Stations continue into the rapidly rejuvenating area of North Little Rock known as Argenta. Stops there include access to the USS Razorback (SS-394) WW II submarine, trolley barn, Verizon Arena, and the Dickey-Stephens Park (home of the Arkansas Travelers). The stops are indicated with -tall black signs and yellow sidewalk \"bumps\" curbside with the system map posted at each stop. Trolleys cannot be hailed between stops. Both stops and cars can be sponsored for a donation. ===Stop list=== ====Lines==== Blue Line Green Line Highlighted stops indicate daytime only service {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !No. !Stop !Jurisdiction !Line(s) !Notes |- |colspan=\"5\"|south and east bound |- |1 || Main Street and Bishop Lindsey Avenue || rowspan=\"4\"|North Little Rock || || First stop located past the streetcar garage Serves Argenta Historic District |- |2 || Maple and Sixth Streets || || |- |3 || Maple and Broadway Streets || || |- |4 || 120 Main Street (Verizon Plaza stop) || || Serves North Little Rock City Hall, Riverfront Park and Verizon Arena |- |5 || Scott and Markham Streets (Main Street Bridge stop) || rowspan=\"4\"|Little Rock || || Serves Little Rock Chamber of Commerce |- |6 || President Clinton and River Market Avenues || || Serves Breciding Riverfront Park and Junction Bridge |- |7 || style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|River Market Avenue and Third Street || || Serves River Market District |- |8 || style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|World Avenue and Third Street (Clinton Presidential Center/Heifer International stop) || || Serves Clinton Presidential Center and Heifer International |- |colspan=\"5\"|west and north bound |- |8 || style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|World Avenue and Third Street (Clinton Presidential Center/Heifer International stop) || rowspan=\"8\"|Little Rock || || Serves Clinton Presidential Center and Heifer International |- |9 || style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\"|Third Street and River Market Avenue || || Serves River Market District |- |10 || Second and Rock Streets (Central Arkansas Library System Main Branch stop) || || Serves Central Arkansas Library System Main Library |- |11 || Second and Scott Streets (Historic Arkansas Museum stop) || || Serves Historic Arkansas Museum |- |12 || Second and Center Streets || || |- |13 || West Markham and Spring Streets || || Serves Robinson Auditorium |- |14 || West Markham and Scott Streets (Little Rock Marriott stop) || || Serves Little Rock Marriott Hotel, Capital Hotel and Statehouse Convention Center |- |5 || Scott and Markham Streets (Main Street Bridge stop) || || Serves Little Rock Chamber of Commerce |- |4 || 120 Main Street (Verizon Plaza stop) || rowspan=\"2\"|North Little Rock || || Serves North Little Rock City Hall, Riverfront Park and Verizon Arena |- |15 || Main and Fifth Streets || || final stop before streetcar barn |} ==See also== *List of heritage railways *Streetcars in North America == References == ==External links== *Metro Streetcar on Rock Region Metro website Category:Rock Region Metro Category:Heritage streetcar systems Category:Heritage railroads in Arkansas Category:Railway lines opened in 2004 Category:Streetcars in Arkansas Category:Transportation in Little Rock, Arkansas Category:Tourist attractions in Little Rock, Arkansas Category:600 V DC railway electrification ",
