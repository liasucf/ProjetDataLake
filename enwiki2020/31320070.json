Fascinate was created by Circle and Tariq (Tarik Saleh),Fria Tidningen: H\u00f6g tid f\u00f6r en ny syn p\u00e5 graffiti then 17 years old, in 1989 and was then the largest graffiti painting in northern Europe. It is painted on an outside wall of an industrial building and was made with consent from the property owner. Fascinate is one of the world's oldest still existing graffiti paintings.Stockholms Fria: Oviss framtid f\u00f6r v\u00e4ggm\u00e5lning som skr\u00e4mmer och fascinerar In 1989 graffiti was a relatively new phenomenon in Sweden. The Bromsten industrial area was reconstructed into a residential area starting in 2018.https://xn--vxer-loa.stockholm/omraden/spanga-bromstensstaden/ A discussion took place about possible protection of Fascinate as the Stockholm City Museum considered it culturally valuable. In 2008, however, the center- right majority in the city planning committee decided that the painting should not be maintained, referring to the city's graffiti policy, which says that the city should not \"participate in activities that in any way encourages graffiti\". After a period of uncertainty regarding the future of Fascinate, the wall became the first graffiti work in Sweden to be officially protected in 2015. The rest of the building is to be demolished and the area around the wall transformed into a park. == References == == Further reading== * ETC Stockholm: Klotterpolicy s\u00e4tter stopp f\u00f6r K-m\u00e4rkning av graffiti * Stockholms Fria: Borgarna ska rensa bort skyddsv\u00e4rd graffiti * Stockholms Fria: \u201dStockholms klotterpolicy f\u00f6rbjuder \u00e4ven laglig graffiti\u201d * Fria Tidningen: Borgerligt nej till att skydda graffiti * Fria Tidningen: Stockholms graffiti kan k-m\u00e4rkas Category:Public art Category:Graffiti and unauthorised signage ",
