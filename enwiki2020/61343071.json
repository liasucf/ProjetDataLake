She said: ==Critical reception and reviews== \"This unexpected, quirky tale explores what it means to love the skin you're in. It challenges us to explore how we alter our behavior based on the world's perceptions of us and what it would take for us to stop\" as reviewed by Chimera Ensemble. Pallavi Kanmadikar of Dish Dash described the film as \"a revelation, that will force you to rethink your own opinions about people\" further adding \"because no individual can be defined by what they look like\". Roopa Modha of Urban Asian noted, \"In the era of social media boom, the issue of self-acceptance is a big one and The Color of Me speaks volumes about how we see ourselves and what we are lead to believe are the acceptable norms of the society.
