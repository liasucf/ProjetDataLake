    "text": "The 1973 Wimbledon Championships was a tennis tournament that took place on the outdoor grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom. The tournament was scheduled to be held from Monday 25 June until Saturday 7 July 1973 but rain on the final Friday meant that the women's singles final was postponed until Saturday and the mixed doubles final was rescheduled to Sunday 8 July. It was the 87th staging of the Wimbledon Championships, and the third Grand Slam tennis event of 1973. Jan Kode\u0161 and Billie Jean King won the singles titles. King became the first player in the open era to claim the triple crown, the second time in her career she won all three titles open to women players. Her three victories necessitated playing six matches on the final weekend of the tournament: The singles final, the doubles semi-final and final and the mixed doubles quarter- final, semi-final and final, which was played on the extended Sunday schedule. ==ATP boycott== In May 1973 Nikola Pili\u0107, Yugoslavia's number one tennis player, was suspended by his national lawn tennis association, the Yugoslav Tennis Association, which claimed he had refused to play in a Davis Cup tie for his country against New Zealand earlier that month. The initial suspension of nine months, supported by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), later was reduced by the ILTF to one month, which meant that Pili\u0107 would not be permitted to play at Wimbledon. The recently formed men's players union, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) stated that none should compete if Pili\u0107 were not allowed to compete. As a result, 81 of the top players, including reigning champion Stan Smith, boycotted Wimbledon in 1973 to protest the suspension of Nikola Pili\u0107. Twelve of the 16 men's seeds had withdrawn. This resulted in a large number of qualifiers and lucky losers. Three ATP players, Ilie N\u0103stase, Roger Taylor and Ray Keldie, defied the boycott and were fined by the ATP's disciplinary committee. N\u0103stase unsuccessfully appealed the fine as he insisted that as a serving captain, he was under orders from the Romanian army and government to compete. Some contemporary press speculation and later biographies have suggested N\u0103stase contrived to lose his fourth round match as he supported the ATP boycott, but to have lost any earlier to a considerably less able player would have been too obvious.Evans, Richard. 'Ilie Nastase' May 1978 Aidan Ellis Publishing. Robertson, Max. 'Wimbledon: Centre Court of the Game' May 1984 Parkwest Publications. N\u0103stase never has commented on this speculation. Despite the boycott, the attendance of 300,172 was the second highest in the championships' history to that date. ==Prize money== The total prize money for 1973 championships was \u00a352,400. The winner of the men's title earned \u00a35,000 while the women's singles champion earned \u00a33,000. {|class=wikitable style=font-size:90%;text-align:center |- | style=\"width:130px; background:#dfe2e9;\"|Event | style=\"width:80px; background:lime;\"|W | style=\"width:85px; background:thistle;\"|F | style=\"width:85px; background:#ff0;\"|SF | style=\"width:85px; background:#ffebcd;\"|QF | style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 16 | style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 32 | style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 64 | style=\"width:85px; background:#afeeee;\"|Round of 128 |- | style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Men's Singles |\u00a35,000 |\u00a33,000 |\u00a31,000 |\u00a3550 |\u00a3300 |\u00a3200 |\u00a3125 |\u00a3100 |- | style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Women's Singles |\u00a33,000 |\u00a32,000 |\u00a3700 |\u00a3400 |\u00a3250 |\u00a3150 |\u00a3100 |\u00a375 |- | style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Men's Doubles * |\u00a31,000 |\u00a3600 |\u00a3400 |\u00a3200 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 | |- | style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Women's Doubles * |\u00a3600 |\u00a3400 |\u00a3200 |\u00a3100 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 | |- | style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Mixed Doubles * |\u00a3500 |\u00a3350 |\u00a3175 |\u00a3100 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 |\u00a30 |} * per team ==Champions== ===Seniors=== ====Men's Singles==== Jan Kode\u0161 defeated Alex Metreveli, 6\u20131, 9\u20138(7\u20135), 6\u20133 ====Women's Singles==== Billie Jean King defeated Chris Evert, 6\u20130, 7\u20135 *It was King's 10th career Grand Slam title (her 6th in the Open Era), and her 5th Wimbledon title. ====Men's Doubles==== Jimmy Connors / Ilie N\u0103stase defeated John Cooper / Neale Fraser, 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20134, 8\u20139(3\u20137), 6\u20131 ====Women's Doubles==== Rosemary Casals / Billie Jean King defeated Fran\u00e7oise D\u00fcrr / Betty St\u00f6ve, 6\u20131, 4\u20136, 7\u20135 ====Mixed Doubles==== Owen Davidson / Billie Jean King defeated Ra\u00fal Ram\u00edrez / Janet Newberry, 6\u20133, 6\u20132 *King became the only player to win the 'triple crown' (Singles, Doubles & Mixed Doubles) twice in the post-war era, repeating her success of 1967. ===Juniors=== ====Boys' Singles==== Billy Martin defeated Colin Dowdeswell, 6\u20132, 6\u20134 ====Girls' Singles==== Ann Kiyomura defeated Martina Navr\u00e1tilov\u00e1, 6\u20134, 7\u20135 ==Singles seeds== ===Men's singles=== # Ilie N\u0103stase (Fourth round, lost to Sandy Mayer) # Jan Kode\u0161 (Champion) # Roger Taylor (Semifinals, lost to Jan Kode\u0161) # Alex Metreveli (Final, lost to Jan Kode\u0161) # Jimmy Connors (Quarterfinals, lost to Alex Metreveli) # Bj\u00f6rn Borg (Quarterfinals, lost to Roger Taylor) # Owen Davidson (Fourth round, lost to Vijay Amritraj) # J\u00fcrgen Fassbender (Quarterfinals, lost to Sandy Mayer) The original seeding list before the boycott was: ===Women's singles=== # Margaret Court (Semifinals, lost to Chris Evert) # Billie Jean King (Champion) # Evonne Goolagong (Semifinals, lost to Billie Jean King) # Chris Evert (Final, lost to Billie Jean King) # Rosie Casals (Quarterfinals, lost to Chris Evert) # Virginia Wade (Quarterfinals, lost to Evonne Goolagong) # Kerry Melville (Quarterfinals, lost to Billie Jean King) # Olga Morozova (Quarterfinals, lost to Margaret Court) ==References== ==External links== * Official Wimbledon Championships website Wimbledon Championships Wimbledon Championships Wimbledon Championships Wimbledon Championships ",
