According to the new basic law, the State President was to be elected by an electoral college composed of members of the majority party in each of the chambers of the new tricameral parliament. As such, the electoral college was composed of 50 National Party members elected by the House of Assembly, 25 Labor Party members elected by the House of Representatives, and 13 members of the National People's Party elected by from the House of Delegates. The election came after the South African elections of 1984 to the two new legislative chambers in the South African Parliament: the House of Representatives, filled with representatives of the colored population in South Africa, and the House of Delegates, filled with representatives of the Indian population. The House of Assembly, the assembly representative of the white population last elected in 1981, was not reelected until 1987.
