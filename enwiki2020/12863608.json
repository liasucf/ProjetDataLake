As a result of submissions from Neale, who was supported by the Nelson Progress League, the closure was deferred to allow time for the League to attempt to increase rail use. The League made some progress but insufficient to reach the levels required. The Government announced that the line would therefore be closed. On 17 September 1955, the Nelson Progress League held a protest rally.p238 When Nelson Had a Railway Neale, as MP for Nelson, was one of the speakers. Also speaking at the protest were Jerry Skinner, MP for Buller, and Walter Nash, then Leader of the Labour Party. As a protest on 20 September 1955, Neale crossed the floor at Parliament on one occasion and voted with the opposition.p99 Bread and Roses, Sonja Davies, 1984 It may have been through this turbulent time that he forged a friendship with Mabel Howard, a famous Labour MP. Her bibliographer noted that he was one of a few gentlemanly National MPs who were close friends with her. Neale gave his valedictory speech on 25 October 1957. His obituary later stated that Neale was \"noted for his sincerity of address\" (in Parliament). He died after a period of illness in Nelson on 25 July 1960.
