    "text": "Pallacanestro Messina was an Italian professional basketball team based in Messina, Sicily. ==History== Established in 1976, the club was admitted to the first division Serie A for the 2003-04 season after Virtus Bologna was excluded for financial irregularities. Messina struggled on every front during that season, finishing dead last in the league whilst suffering from financial problems and a lack of interest from the public. With debts too big to allow the club to even take part in other divisions and scaring off clubs that wanted to buy the side's sporting rights, Messina went bankrupt a few months after the season. == Notable players == * Agostino Li Vecchi 3 seasons: '99-'00, '02-'04 * Gerrod Abram 2 seasons: '99-'01 * Marques Bragg 2 seasons: '99-'00, '02-'03 * Malcolm Mackey 1 season: '00-'01 * Scooter Barry 1 season: '00-'01 * Cristiano Grappasonni 1 season: '00-'01 * Chris Carrawell 1 season: '00-'01 * Brian Oliver 2 seasons: '01-'03 * Lamarr Greer 1 season: '01-'02 * Sharif Fajardo 1 season: '01-'02 * Manuel Vanuzzo 1 season: '01-'02 * Saddi Washington 1 season: '01-'02 * Herman Smith 1 season: '02-'03 * Leonardo Busca 1 season: '02-'03 * Matt Bonner 1 season: '03-'04 * Marlon Garnett 1 season: '03-'04 * Marquis Estill 1 season: '03-'04 * Leonardo Busca 1 season: '03-'04 * Vincent Yarbrough 1 season: '03-'04 ==Sponsorship names== Throughout the years, due to sponsorship, the club has been known as: *Ina Sicilia Barcellona (1999-2000) *Media Broker Messina (2000-2001) *Sicilia Messina (2003-2004) ==References== ==External links== *Serie A historical results Retrieved 23 August 2015 Category:1976 establishments in Italy Category:2004 disestablishments in Italy Messina Category:Basketball teams in Sicily Messina ",
