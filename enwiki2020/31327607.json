Andalusian patios are central open spaces in the courtyard houses of Al-Andalus (Spain). The stone patios are an architectural evolution of the Roman atrium. ==Background== It has long been customary to decorate houses and palaces with large open spaces and gardens dominated by fragrant flowers, fountains, canals, wells, ponds, frescoes with mythological scenes, and marble medallions (on walls), forming ornate but harmonious shapes with the intention to represent the Garden of the Paradise as imagined by the Classical and Muslim architects. There are countless examples throughout the region of Andalusia, with prominent examples at the Alhambra of Granada, the Alcazar of Seville and many other buildings and houses in the inner-city of C\u00f3rdoba. ==Architecture== As trends evolved, the addition of windows, fences (in wrought iron or wood), balconies and other viewpoints into the garden from inside the house became commonplace. Some of these were designed to give a view of the patio while obscuring the viewer from outside observers. == See also == *Terrace *Generalife *Sahn, the equivalent within the wider tradition of Muslim architecture. ==References== Category:Andalusian culture Category:History of Andalusia Category:Spanish gardens Category:Garden features Category:Buildings and structures in Andalusia ",
