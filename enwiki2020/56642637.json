He became active in Taiwan's conservation movement shortly thereafter. In 1992, while serving the Taiwan Provincial Government as head of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Sun founded the Taiwan Endemic Species Research Institute. In November of that year, Sun was appointed agriculture minister and retained his position under premier Lien Chan. In June 1996, Sun was succeeded by Tjiu Mau-ying. After stepping down, Sun continued to work with the Council of Agriculture as an ambassador at large and frequently traveled to the United States to promote agricultural cooperation. Sun joined the China-based Taiwan Agricultural Entrepreneurship Garden in September 2009, while chairman of the World Vegetable Center in Taiwan. Several legislators believed this to be a conflict of interest. Additionally, Sun led the 21st Century Foundation. On 21 January 2018, Sun died of pancreatic cancer, aged 80. ==References== Category:1937 births Category:2018 deaths Category:National Taiwan University alumni Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:Purdue University alumni Category:Taiwanese Ministers of Agriculture Category:Politicians of the Republic of China on Taiwan from Tainan Category:Deaths from cancer in Taiwan Category:Nature conservation in Taiwan Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer ",
