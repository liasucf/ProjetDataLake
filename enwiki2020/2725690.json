Both fans and social media users were questioning the physics of Slater falling, thus drawing accusations of diving. Slater also captained the Melbourne Storm for the first time in his NRL Career and during Cameron Smith's suspension absence, against the Manly Sea Eagles in the 4\u201324 loss during Round 11. Slater announced his intentions to retire from representative football after the 2018 State of Origin series and was yet to make a decision on playing only at the club level in 2019. Slater was set to play in the opening game of the Origin series at the MCG; however, he withdrew from the Game 1 squad due to a hamstring injury, in what would have been his last Origin match in Melbourne. He returned from injury in game 2 to play his 30th Origin game, producing an outstanding performance despite Queensland losing game 2 and the series in New South Wales' home game victory at ANZ Stadium. Following an injury to Queensland teammate and captain Greg Inglis, Slater was named captain for game 3 in his final Origin game. Producing yet another outstanding performance, Slater led Queensland to an 18\u201312 victory at Suncorp Stadium, thus avoiding a potential 3\u20130 series whitewash by New South Wales. For his efforts, Slater received the Wally Lewis Medal for Player of the Series, despite having only participated in two of the three Origin games and Queensland's overall series loss. On 8 August, Slater announced that he would be retiring from the NRL at the end of the 2018 season. He played his final game, a grand final loss to the Sydney Roosters, on 30 September 2018. ==Post- playing career== On 10 October 2018, Slater joined Australian Football League (AFL) club in a leadership role. He also joined the Nine Network\u2019s NRL commentary team in 2019 On 14 March 2019 Melbourne Storm Announced the renaming of the Northern Stand of AAMI Park to Slater Stand. On 30 August 2019, Slater was chosen at Fullback in the Queensland Maroons team of the decade. ==Honours== Individual * 2005: Dally M Top Try Scorer (19, tied with Shaun Berrigan) * 2007: Melbourne Storm Team of the Decade (Fullback) * 2008: Dally M Fullback of the Year * 2008: Rugby League World Cup Player of the Tournament * 2008: Rugby League World Cup Top Try Scorer (7) * 2008: Rugby League World Golden Boot Award * 2009: Clive Churchill Medal * 2009: Melbourne Storm Player of the Year Award * 2010: Wally Lewis Medal (State of Origin) * 2011: Dally M Fullback of the Year * 2011: Dally M Medal Player of the Year: * 2017: Dally M Fullback of the Year * 2017: Clive Churchill Medal * 2018: Wally Lewis Medal (State of Origin) Team * 2006 NRL Grand Final Runner-up\u2020 * 2007 NRL Grand Final Winners * 2008 World Club Challenge Runner-up * 2008 State of Origin series Winners * 2008 NRL Grand Final Runner-up\u2020 * 2008 Rugby League World Cup Runner-up * 2009 State of Origin series Winners * 2009 NRL Grand Final Winners * 2009 Rugby League Four Nations Winners * 2010 World Club Challenge Winners * 2010 State of Origin series Winners * 2010 Rugby League Four Nations Runner-up * 2011 State of Origin series Winner * 2011 Rugby League Four Nations Winners * 2012 State of Origin series Winners * 2012 NRL Grand Final Winners * 2013 World Club Challenge Winners * 2013 State of Origin series Winners * 2013 Rugby League World Cup Winners * 2014 State of Origin series Runner-up * 2015 State of Origin series Winners * 2017 State of Origin series Winners * 2017 NRL Grand Final Winners * 2017 Rugby League World Cup Winners * 2018 World Club Challenge Winners * 2018 NRL Grand Final Runner-up \u2020Denotes season in which Melbourne Storm were later to be found in breach of the salary cap. ==Statistics== ===NRL=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | style=\"background:#afe6ba; width:3em;\"|\u2020 |Denotes seasons in which Slater won an NRL Premiership |- | style=\"background:#DD6E81; width:3em;\"|\u2020 |Denotes seasons in which Slater won an NRL Premiership that was later stripped |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; width:85%;\" |- !width=2%|Season !width=8%|Team !width=2%|Matches !width=2%|T !width=2%|G !width=2%|GK % !width=2%|F/G !width=2%|Pts !width=2%|W !width=2%|L !width=2%|D !width=2%|W-L % |- style=\"background:#eaeaea;\" !
