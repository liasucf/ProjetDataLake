    "text": "The July 5th Album is the second compilation album by American pop group The 5th Dimension, released in 1970 by Soul City. It is composed primarily of album tracks from amongst the group's four albums of original material for Soul City Records, many of which were B-sides to charting singles. It also includes one A-side single: the group's cover of The Mamas & the Papas hit \"Go Where You Wanna Go\". The song was originally intended to be the Mamas & the Papas first single but was replaced with the now-iconic \"California Dreamin'\". Choosing that single, and seeing it become successful, became something of a mixed blessing for The 5th Dimension, as they were frequently referred to in the media as \"The Black Mamas & the Papas\", a label the group sought to escape while creating their own unique identity. The July 5th Album was the final album release for Soul City Records' distribution deal with Liberty Records. The 5th Dimension subsequently signed with Bell Records. Released on 15 August 1970, just three months after their prior Greatest Hits (Soul City) album, The July 5th Album eventually peaked at #63 on Billboard Magazine's Top 200 Album Charts (see Billboard charts). Of note: * Neither Greatest Hits nor The July 5th Album included either side of the group's first single, \"Train Keep On Movin'/I'll Be Lovin' You Forever\". * Neither Greatest Hits nor The July 5th Album included the group's third single, \"Another Day, Another Heartache\", although it reached #45 on the charts. * \"It'll Never Be The Same Again\", from the group's 1968 album Stoned Soul Picnic appeared as the B-side of two separate 5th Dimension releases, \"California Soul\" and \"The Girls' Song\". * In the second week of its release, The July 5th Album was one of four albums by The 5th Dimension in the Top 100 of Billboard's album charts: Greatest Hits (Soul City) was at #23, The Age of Aquarius - from which FOUR of The July 5th Album's tracks were pulled - sat at #98, and Portrait appeared at #64. ==Track listing== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center; |- !Track !Song !Album |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 1 |align=left|Sunshine of Your Love | The Age of Aquarius |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 2 |align=left| It'll Never Be The Same Again | Stoned Soul Picnic |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 3 |align=left| Don'tcha Hear Me Callin' To Ya | The Age of Aquarius |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 4 |align=left|Those Were the Days | The Age of Aquarius |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 5 |align=left| The Sailboat Song | Stoned Soul Picnic |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 6 |align=left|Ticket to Ride | The Magic Garden |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 7 |align=left| California My Way | Up, Up and Away |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 8 |align=left|Let It Be Me | The Age of Aquarius |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 9 |align=left|Go Where You Wanna Go | Up, Up and Away |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 10 |align=left|Poor Side of Town | Up, Up and Away |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 11 |align=left| Bobbie's Blues (Who Do You Think Of) |Stoned Soul Picnic |- |rowspan=\"1\"| 12 |align=left| Lovin' Stew | Stoned Soul Picnic |- |} ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1970) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |Australian (Kent Music Report)||14 |} ==Personnel== *Marilyn McCoo - vocals *Florence LaRue - vocals *Billy Davis, Jr. - vocals *Lamonte McLemore - vocals *Ron Townson - vocals Category:The 5th Dimension albums Category:1970 compilation albums ",
