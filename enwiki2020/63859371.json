He played college basketball at the University of Southern California. ==Early years== Clark attended Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Virginia. He played basketball in high school with Oak Hill Academy's basketball prep program. ==College career== In college, he played basketball with the Charlotte 49ers as a freshman in the 2012\u201313 season. Then, he transferred to USC and played two seasons, 2014\u201315 and 2015\u201316, and transferred again as a senior to Grand Canyon Antelopes men's basketball and played for them in the 2016\u201317 season. When he was in USC, he used to hang out a lot with the USC football team and said he began to miss it, he said \"I began thinking about football all the time, and then I began having dreams, where I was playing football very vividly\". Before he went to Grand Canyon, he seriously considered joining the USC football team, but had shoulder surgery so he played his last season at Grand Canyon. ==Professional career== Clark started football camp in January 2018 and attended the USC Pro Day in March 2018, but wasn't drafted in the 2018 NFL Draft. He was invited to the New York Jets rookie minicamp in April of that year, but was not signed afterwards.
