Written and directed by Jang Kun-jae, the film was co-produced with world-renowned filmmaker Naomi Kawase. It made its debut as the opening film of the 5th Nara International Film Festival in September 2014. ==Plot== The film is structured into two halves. Part one First Love, Yoshiko, shot in monochrome and documentary-like, deals with a Korean filmmaker researching to shoot a film in Gojo City, Japan. While Part two Well of Sakura, in colour, tells a tale of romance between a Korean actress and a Japanese man from the area inspired by the research from Part one. ==Cast== * Kim Sae-byuk as Hye-jeong * Iwase Ryo * Lim Hyung-kook ==Production== A Midsummer's Fantasia is a film commission for the Nara International Film Festival (NIFF). The NARAtive is a project to make an original film in Nara prefecture, funded by NIFF.
