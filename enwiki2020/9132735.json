He was drafted by the New Jersey Devils in the 1987 NHL Supplemental Draft. ==Biography== Madill was born in Oshawa, Ontario. As a youth, he played in the 1978 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Oshawa. After playing three seasons with the Ohio State Buckeyes, Madill made his professional debut with the Utica Devils of the American Hockey League in 1987\u201388. Madill played four seasons with Utica before making his National Hockey League debut with New Jersey in 1990\u201391. He played fourteen regular season and seven playoff games with the Devils that season. He also became the first Devil to score his first NHL goal in his debut game. Madill would have no further NHL experience in his career. He played six seasons in the International Hockey League with seven different teams before retiring in 1998. While serving as an assistant coach for the Kansas City Outlaws of the United Hockey League during the 2004\u201305 season, Madill suited up and played in the club's final game of the season. In that game, he showed why he'd been given the nickname \"Mad Dog,\" amassing 21 penalty minutes in just three shifts. His proudest achievement is his daughter and son. ==Awards and honours== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Award !
