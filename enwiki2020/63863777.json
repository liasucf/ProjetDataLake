It was part of a purchase of about of land by Henry Williams on 28 May 1839, from H\u014dne Heke and 30 other M\u0101ori people. He had the property taken care of by shepherds from 1840. One of these was murdered, and the case was reported as the first case of murder dealt with under British justice in New Zealand. In 1851 he transferred the property to his son Edward Marsh Williams, who built a house there in 1860 or 1861, and lived there until 1881. The house, now known as Choat House, is listed as a Category 1 Historic Place. The road between Paihia and Pakaraka, passing through Puketona, was sealed from 1939, although the quality of the new road appears to have been lacking. Electricity was first supplied to the area in the mid 1940s. ==References== Category:Far North District Category:Populated places in the Northland Region ",
