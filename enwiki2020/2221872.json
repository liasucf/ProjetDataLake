    "text": "Colin White (born December 12, 1977) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He previously played with the New Jersey Devils and the San Jose Sharks of the NHL. ==Playing career== White played Midget hockey for the Weeks Major Midget AAA in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, before being drafted 49th overall in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils. In 1997, White won the Memorial Cup with the Hull Olympiques. White had his best season production-wise during the 2000\u201301 season, where he put up 20 points, helping the Devils to the Stanley Cup finals. During the 2007\u201308 pre-season, White suffered a serious eye injury. During a team practice on September 19, \"White was defending against two-on-one rushes when John Madden gave rookie Nicklas Bergfors the puck for a shot that deflected off White's stick and hit him in the nose and near the right eye.\" White was able to return to the lineup on November 21 to play in the Devils' 2\u20131 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins. Despite still suffering from some blurred vision in his right eye, he was able to play over 17 minutes, blocked 2 shots, and was credited with six of the Devils' fifteen hits. White quickly returned to his regular spot in the Devils line-up, where he began wearing a protective visor on his helmet. In the 2008\u201309 season, White played 71 games, finishing the season with one goal, 17 assists and a +18 rating, one of his highest career offensive seasons. On February 2, 2010, for the first time in nearly four years, White fought Maple Leafs defensemen Dion Phaneuf for taking a run at teammate Zach Parise's head. Had White been hit near his previously injured eye during the fight, his career could have been in jeopardy. The following season, White fought for the second time in as many years when he dropped the gloves with Bruno Gervais of the New York Islanders. White had previously hit P. A. Parenteau, which sparked the fight that ended with White fracturing Gervais' cheekbone. White established himself as physical, defensive defenceman, often leading the Devils in penalty minutes to go with his relatively low offensive production. During his Devils tenure, White served several times as an alternate captain. On August 1, 2011, White was placed on waivers by the New Jersey Devils along with Trent Hunter. He was then bought out from the final year of his contract on August 2 after clearing. On August 3, White was signed by the San Jose Sharks to a 1-year, $1M contract. On May 31, 2012, it was announced that White's jersey number 24 was to be retired by his junior team the Gatineau Olympiques, formerly the Hull Olympiques. He became the fifth player to have his jersey retired, joining the likes of Luc Robitaille and Jose Theodore, on November 8, 2012. At the conclusion of the 2012\u201313 NHL lockout, after White accepted an invitation to the St. Louis Blues training camp, on January 18, 2013, the Blues announced that they had released White from his professional tryout. ==Post-retirement== White is an ambassador for the New Jersey Devils' alumni association along with Bruce Driver, Ken Daneyko, Grant Marshall and Jim Dowd.http://fireandice.northjersey.com/fire-ice-1.174987/colin-white- happy-to-be-back-with-devils-as-part-of-alumni-association-1.1148765 ==Personal== White has three children: Hunter, who plays for the Montclair Blues Hockey club, Jordyn, and Cale.http://www.ottawasun.com/2014/12/29/former-olympiques-star-colin-white- returns-with-son White grew up in New Glasgow, N.S.
