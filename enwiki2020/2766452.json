    "text": "Holland Village MRT station is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the Circle line, situated along the boundary of Bukit Timah and Queenstown planning areas in Singapore. Situated close to the junction of Holland Avenue and Holland Road, it primarily serves the area of Holland Village, where its name was derived from. Holland Village is named after the nearby Holland Road, which in turn it was named after an early resident, Hugh Holland, a well- respected architect known for his acting pursuits. The area was once home to European civilian populations and is still regarded today as an expatriate social enclave within an upmarket residential estate, filled with restaurants, drinking establishments and specialist shops popular with expatriates and younger locals alike. ==History== The entrance to the station under construction.
