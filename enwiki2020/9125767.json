The film's plot is set in 1700, when British officer Brian Hawke infiltrates a group of pirates located on Libertatia on the coast of Madagascar, and falls in love with pirate captain \"Spitfire\" Stevens. ==Plot== Lieutenant Brian Hawke, an officer aboard the British merchant ship The Monsoon, volunteers for a dangerous mission to infiltrate the pirates' base at Diego Suarez on the coast of Madagascar. He is to pose as a deserter, and to make his disguise more convincing, he is given twenty lashes. When he arrives in Diego Suarez, he arouses the suspicions of the pirates, especially Captain Roc Brasiliano. Brasiliano orders him to appear before a tribunal of the Coast Captains to decide his fate. If they do not like him, he will be executed. Meanwhile, Hawke has caught the eye of Spitfire Stevens - the only woman among the Coast Captains - who inherited her position from her father. At the tribunal, Hawke duels one of the pirates with boarding pikes, managing to outfight him. Hawke is therefore allowed to join Brasiliano's crew to prove his worth. While cruising the shipping lanes, they come across a Moghul vessel crammed with luxuries and vast wealth. After a tough battle, it is taken and looted. Captured aboard is Patma, the daughter of the Moghul Emperor, who is disguised by her chaperone as just another ordinary woman. She falls in love with Hawke after he rescues her from the burning ship, admitting he is only the third man she has ever seen. When they return to Diego-Suarez, Spitfire becomes jealous of Patma. When Patma is put up for auction, she outbids Hawke (who wanted to protect her from the other pirates) and takes the Indian woman into her service. In a candid moment, Spitfire tells Hawke she is planning to leave for Britain via Brazil, where she can catch a legal ship. She wants Hawke to accompany her there, after which he can take ownership of her ship. Brasiliano's hatred of Hawke grows, as he has a fancy for Spitfire himself. Hawke has slowly been gathering information on the base, and has acquired a map of the defences. It is planned that the Royal Navy ships will sail into the harbour, with Hawke disabling the cannons. Hawke gives a signal to the British ships with a flare, and makes sure the Moghul princess is ready to be rescued. Unfortunately, Hawke's plans are uncovered by Brasiliano. Hawke is tied to a stake on the beach, to be drowned and eaten by crabs. Spitfire pretends to stab him in the back to end his suffering, but instead cuts the ropes binding him to the stake. At that moment, a British warship enters the bay. The pirates hurry to repel it, expecting to easily sink it as they had a Portuguese warship that recently attempted to storm the harbour. To their surprise, the cannons have been double-shotted and explode. Faced with imminent defeat and hanging, Brasiliano tries a final gamble to escape: He places the princess at the front of his ship as he sails past the British warship, knowing they will not dare fire on her. However, Hawke has slipped aboard and manages to reach the hostage, escorting her to safety. With Spitfire aiding him, Hawke squares off against Brasiliano for an epic final sword duel on the decks of the ship. For killing Brasiliano and foiling the pirates, Hawke is granted a boon, which he uses to claim a full pardon for Spitfire, and the two end the film kissing each other. ==Cast== * Errol Flynn as Brian Hawke * Maureen O'Hara as Prudence 'Spitfire' Stevens * Anthony Quinn as Captain Roc Brasiliano * Alice Kelley as Princess Patma * Mildred Natwick as Molvina MacGregor * Robert Warwick as Captain William Kidd * Harry Cording as Gow * John Alderson as Jonathan Harris * Phil Tully as Jones * Lester Matthews as Sir Cloudsley * Tudor Owen as Williams * Maurice Marsac as Captain Moisson * James Craven as Captain Hornsby * James Fairfax as Cruikshank - Barber * Bill Radovich as Hassan ==Production== ===Development=== The film was originally written by Aeneas MacKenzie and director Richard Wallace as a vehicle for Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., who had just made Sinbad the Sailor with Wallace.

It was mostly done on a stage at the Universal Studios in Los Angeles with some location footage shot at Palos Verdes, California.

However she said by the end of filming \"he had won me over. I respected him professionally and was quite fond of him personally. Father Time was slowly calming his wicked, wicked ways, and deep within that devilish rogue, I found a kind and fragile soul.\"O'Hara p 347 O'Hara said that Flynn \"was a pro\" who \"came to work prepared. He rehearsed hard and practised his fencing sequences very meticulously.\" O'Hara did admit Flynn drank on set, often smuggling in alcohol by injecting it into oranges and eating the oranges. She said \"everything good that we got on film was shot early in the day\" and that Flynn would start drinking by morning and be of no use after 4 pm. She had to perform many of her close ups for love scenes opposite a black flag with an \"x\" on it while a script girl read lines. \"It was hard to watch him, very frustrating, but you forgave him because what he had given you earlier in the day had been so terrific.\"O'Hara p 348 On 1 February Flynn broke his ankle during filming, with ten more days of filming still to be completed, most of it featuring Flynn.
