The film was released on October 7, 2016 by FilmRise. ==Plot== Big Ronnie runs a disco-themed walking location tour in his town, alongside his son Big Brayden. Ronnie allows Brayden to live with him on the condition that Brayden prepares excessively greasy food for him. Ronnie is a pathological liar who fabricates stories about disco groups like the Bee Gees. Brayden aspires to be a space fantasy author. Ronnie asserts that Brayden drove his mother away, though Brayden says that she left Ronnie for a man named Ricky Prickles. At night, Ronnie completely covers himself in grease and strangles residents of the town, becoming known as \"The Greasy Strangler.\" After his killings, he cleans himself of the grease by standing in a car wash run by a blind man named Big Paul. During one of the disco walking tours, Brayden meets a woman named Janet, and the two begin a romantic relationship. One night, Ronnie strangles a hot dog vendor he had gotten in an argument with earlier, causing his eyes to pop out of his head, which Ronnie cooks and eats. He later kills Oinker, Brayden's best friend. Brayden and Janet have sex, and the next morning, Ronnie attempts to seduce her. Ronnie takes Janet out to a discotheque, threatening to evict Brayden if he does not allow them to. There, Ronnie attempts to kiss Janet, but she resists, saying that she may be in love with Brayden. Ronnie later has sex with Janet, and leading to a heated argument between him and Brayden. Ronnie and Janet continue a physical relationship, mocking Brayden when he confronts them in despair. One night, Brayden professes his love to Janet. Ronnie overhears this before going to the car wash to strangle and decapitate Paul. The next morning, Brayden calls a detective named Jody and reports that Ronnie may be the Greasy Strangler. Jody - who is actually Ronnie in disguise - comes to the house the next day, and Brayden and Janet show him a spot of oil left behind on the carpet as evidence that Ronnie is the Greasy Strangler. Jody concludes that the oil is meaningless circumstantial evidence, and demands that they end all inquiries about Ronnie having committed the murders. That night, Janet declares her mutual love for Brayden, and they decide to get married. Ronnie, hiding under the bed, reveals himself, claiming Janet as his lover and evicting Brayden. Janet replies that Brayden can stay at her residence, and Ronnie covers himself in grease, slaps Brayden, and drags Janet out of the house with him. Brayden covers himself in grease as well, and follows Ronnie and Janet to a movie theatre, where Ronnie is strangling her. Brayden strangles Janet instead, causing her eyes to pop out of her head, which both he and Ronnie consume. The next day, on a beach, Ronnie reveals that he cares for Brayden, despite his annoyance with him. They bond over, in hindsight, their disgust with Janet. They cover themselves in grease and head to a forest where they murder Ricky Prickles. They then witness themselves being executed by firing squad, watching as confetti and champagne explode from their heads. They venture deeper into the forest, still covered in grease, and primally shake wooden spears at the camera. ==Cast== * Michael St. Michaels as Big Ronnie * Sky Elobar as Big Brayden * Elizabeth De Razzo as Janet * Gil Gex as Big Paul * Joe David Walters as Oinker * Sam Dissanayake as Indian Tourist * Abdoulaye N'Gom as Senegalese Tourist * Holland MacFallister as Scandinavian Tourist * Mel Kohl as Hot Dog Vendor * Carl Solomon as Danny The Crooner * Sal Koussa as Ricky Prickles * Dana Haas as Big Heinie * Jesse Keen as Big Thaddeus * John Yuan as Hot Dog Mourner * Matthew Yuan as Hot Dog Mourner ==Release== The Greasy Strangler premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2016.
