He has one England cap to his name, playing against Spain at Villa Park in 2001. He is the current Under-18s assistant manager at Bolton Wanderers. ==Club career== McCann played junior football for Y.M.C.A juniors in Lytham St Annes. He signed for Everton where he was a product of their academy. In 1998, he moved to Sunderland where he was a member of the side which won the Division One title and promotion to the Premiership with 105 points in 1999. He signed for Aston Villa in 2003, where he had numerous injury setbacks. He scored one goal in the 2006\u201307 season in a 3\u20131 home loss to Manchester City. He was no longer guaranteed first team football, so decided to leave Villa Park, and in June 2007, he signed a five-year contract with Bolton Wanderers. McCann scored his first goal for Bolton in their 1\u20130 UEFA Cup group win over Red Star Belgrade in December 2007 and followed this up with a goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Sporting Clube de Portugal at the Reebok Stadium three months later in the knockout stage of the cup. He scored his first league goal for Bolton in a 1\u20130 victory over Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium on 19 April 2008. In November 2008 he received high acclaim from the Bolton manager Gary Megson who stated that the midfielder was playing some of the best football of his career since moving to the Reebok Stadium. McCann's contract ran out at the end of June 2010, McCann had picked up a knee injury and Owen Coyle said that once he recovered from the injury, he would have a chance to earn a new contract. He was not included in Bolton's 25-man squad for the 2010\u201311 season. In early 2011, teammate Kevin Davies confirmed on the social networking site Twitter that McCann had retired from the game having failed to overcome injury. McCann remained active at Bolton in the backroom at youth level until he left to join Hyde's management team, and is studying for his professional coaching badges.
