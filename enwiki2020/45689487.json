    "text": "The American Premier Soccer League (APSL) was a soccer league sanctioned by the United States Adult Soccer Association (USASA) with teams primarily in Southern Florida. ==Competition format== The official regular season ran from January through September. For the playoffs, the four top seeded teams faced each other in semifinal games with championship being decided between the two winners. The APSL also organized a Fall Season that ran from September to December. ==Organization== The APSL was organized in a mostly decentralized structure and was managed as a team-run league. Each year the member clubs helped elect a Commissioner, Treasurer and Secretary. Each team was individually owned and operated, and was responsible for maintaining league minimum standards. New teams seeking membership into the league were subject to approval from an executive committee of existing team owners. Member clubs had the right to make localized decisions for their respective markets, conferences and regions based on what they believed was best for their particular region. == Teams == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:gray;color:white;\" | APSL Teams |- !
