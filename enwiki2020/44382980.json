Therefore, to understand the language of painting \u2013 to crack the aesthetic code \u2013 we need to understand the psychological world view and philosophy that is reflected through the painter\u2019s style. \"The work of art is driven from emotion to reflect the totality of life, man and nature: to represent the human existential condition, the hopes and hardships, in front of life and death: all style is a statement theologically. The work of art is an attempt to approach, touch, and mimic the same reality enigmatic emerging only when it is created again. The work of art is an act of courtship.
