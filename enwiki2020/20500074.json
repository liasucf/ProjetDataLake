Danelson performed as Tracy nearly 60 times during the tour, and was critically well-regarded, with one Reno reviewer commenting, \"As Tracy, Danelson is the show's centerpiece and she's terrific.\" Born in Union County and raised in Clark,\"Meet the Semifinalists: Christine Danelson\", TAPinto.net, November 15, 2016.

Later that year, she starred as the lead in Hairspray at the Paper Mill Playhouse. Christine was very well received at the Paper Mill and received many outstanding reviews. Peter Filichia of The Star-Ledger suggested that show was better than Broadway stating: > One reason Hairspray is more believable in Millburn is Christine Danelson. > While she dons the requisite fat suit to display Tracy\u2019s girth, Danelson is > one of the most attractive young women to have played the role. And she > seems to go from one frenetic dance number to the next without shedding even > a single bead of perspiration.\" The New York Times also offered its opinion of Danelson's performance at the Paper Mill: > \"A young veteran of the show\u2019s national tour, Christine Danelson is a joyful > sweetheart as Tracy, with a mischievous Bette Midleresque face and a strong, > yet fittingly cooing voice. Effortlessly gyrating through the dances \u2014 even > when she snapped a shoe strap during the finale on opening night \u2014 Ms. > Danelson blesses Tracy with a touch of vulnerability that makes viewers root > for her ingenuous character\u2019s triumph over Baltimore\u2019s racism and skinnier > girls.\" Danelson has been a resident of Somerville, New Jersey.Fowler, Linda. \"N.J. native Marc Shaiman drops in on Paper Mill's production of his Broadway hit Hairspray\", NJ Advance Media for NJ.com, December 23, 2010, updated April 1, 2019.
