Witnesses had observed that the two nuns actively directed Rwandan death squadrons to their refuge and even supplied gasoline to burn down the building with the civilians inside. After serving half of her 12-year sentence in a Belgian prison, Kisito was released in June 2007. ==Testimony from the trial== On April 22, 1994, S\u00e9raphine Mukamana had hidden herself in a garage when militias attacked a convent in Sovu in southern Rwanda. \"We sought refugee in the garage and closed and barricaded the doors. Outside a bloodbath is going on. Suddenly an orphan begins to weep as it gets too hot in the garage. At once, the killers approach the garage.\" As the refugees refuse to come out, the militia leader, Emmanuel Rekeraho, decides to burn them alive in the garage. \"'The nuns are coming to help us. They are bringing gasoline,' I heard [Rekeraho] say. Looking through a hole that the militiamen meanwhile had made in the wall, I indeed saw Sister Gertrude and Sister Kisito. The latter was carrying a petrol can. Shortly upon that, the garage is set on fire.\" \"Vatican Puzzled by Verdict Against Rwandan Nuns,\" retrieved May 26, 2008 == References == == See also == * Butare Four Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Benedictine nuns Category:Members of the clergy convicted of crimes Category:People of the Rwandan genocide Category:Prisoners and detainees of Belgium Category:Rwandan Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Rwandan criminals Category:Rwandan people imprisoned abroad Category:Belgium\u2013Rwanda relations Category:Rwandan people convicted of war crimes ",
