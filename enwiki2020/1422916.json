The neighborhood is represented in the New York State Senate by Andrew Lanza, in the New York State Assembly by Michael Reilly, and in the New York City Council by Joseph Borelli, All three are members of the Republican Party. ==Transportation== Richmond Valley is served by the station of the same name on the Staten Island Railway.
