Not to be confused with batter-fried okra which involves deep frying, this dish is just stir fried or saut\u00e9ed lightly. It can be served as a side dish in accompaniment with steamed rice and dal or with chapati as a form of sabzi. Bhendi (okra) is one of the most popular and nutritious vegetables in India. ==See also== * List of Indian dishes * List of stuffed dishes ==References== ==External links== * Stuffed bhindi recipe * Bharwan bhindi * Batter-fried bhindi or okra * Calories in Bhindi Fry Category:Indian cuisine Category:Nepalese cuisine Category:Vegetarian dishes of India Category:Masalas Category:Okra dishes ",
