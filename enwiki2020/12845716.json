    "text": "{| |} USS Menkar (AK-123) was a , converted from a Liberty Ship, commissioned by the U.S. Navy for service in World War II. She was first named after John White, a settler among those who sailed with Richard Grenville, to present-day North Carolina, in 1585, to found the Roanoke Colony. White acted as artist and mapmaker to the expedition. He became the governor, in 1587, of the colony, and his granddaughter, Virginia Dare, was the first English child born in the Americas. She was renamed and commissioned after Menkar, the second- brightest star in the constellation of Cetus. She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. ==Construction== John White was laid down on 17 November 1943, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1218, by the St. Johns River Shipbuilding Company, Jacksonville, Florida; she was sponsored by Mrs. Cora E. Owens, a yard employee, and launched on 31 December 1943. She was acquired by the U.S. Navy, under a bareboat charter on 17 January 1944, and renamed Menkar. Placed in temporary commission the next day, Lieutenant Commander Edward G. Gummer, USNR, in command, to be ferried to Miami, Florida, where she decommissioned 22 January, for conversion by Dade Drydock Co.; and commissioned 2 June 1944, Lieutenant Commander Niels P. Thompsen, USCG, in command. ==Service history== Menkar sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, 20 June, and following shakedown, was temporarily assigned to NTS. In late July, she loaded on supplies at Norfolk, and got underway for the Panama Canal Zone, via Guantanamo, Cuba, arriving 11 August, for duty with the U.S. Pacific Fleet. In October 1944, Menkar was transferred to the United States Coast Guard for Long Range Navigation (LORAN) work. Construction of stations for LORAN, a navigational system for ships and planes based on the transmission of radio wave pulses, had only begun in the Pacific Ocean a year before; and a cargo ship was needed to transport material and equipment. On 31 October, Menkar reached Saipan, Marianas, to unload cargo for the first LORAN station in the Marianas chain. On 11 November, she anchored in Apra Harbor, and unloaded supplies for the Guam station. She then continued on to Ulithi, Carolines, arriving 13 December. The Marianas stations proved invaluable in the amphibious assault on Iwo Jima, in February 1945, and in the bombing attacks on Japan, begun in March of that year. On 5 March 1945, Menkar was off Angaur, Palaus, with materials to set up a fixed station. Four days later she was anchored at Pulo Anna, Palaus, unloading her cargo. By the end of March, she had supplied the other two stations of the Palau Mortal chain. The cargo ship next helped tighten the LORAN network around Japan, with the construction of the Iwo Jima\u2013Tokyo\u2013Okinawa chain. Menkar reached Kangoku Iwa, off Iwo Jima, 20 April, just 2 months after the U.S. Marines had first landed. Three days later she departed for Ike Shima, arriving 10 May. In the next 4 days she fought off intermittent Japanese air raids while discharging supplies at Okinawa. She continued on to Katchin Wan Harbor, Okinawa, where she again was harassed by enemy planes. On 18 May, Menkar retaliated by shooting down an \"Oscar\" diving directly at the ship. Before construction of the third station at O Shima began, Menkar steamed for the west coast, via Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, arriving Seattle, Washington, 5 August. She remained there through the Japanese surrender 15 August. On 14 September, she departed Seattle, for Pearl Harbor, embarking 307 passengers on arrival on 24 September. She again embarked LORAN units and got underway 9 October, for the Marianas, stopping in the Gilberts and the Marshalls before anchoring at Guam, 26 October. With the construction of a China Sea LORAN chain planned soon after the cessation of hostilities, she continued on to the East China Sea for LORAN duty into the next year. When the project was abandoned, Menkar returned to San Francisco, California, 3 March 1946. ==Decommissioning== On 15 April 1946, she decommissioned and was delivered to the War Shipping Administration for service under MARCOM as John White. She was struck from the Navy List 1 May 1946. She was sold for scrapping to Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, on 7 July 1947, for $48,789.99. She was withdrawn from the fleet on 22 May 1962. == Military awards and honors == Menkars crew was eligible for the following medals: * American Campaign Medal * Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal * World War II Victory Medal * Navy Occupation Service Medal (with Asia clasp) ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * ==External links== * Category:Crater-class cargo ships Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Ships built in Jacksonville, Florida Category:Liberty ships Category:1943 ships Category:Ships transferred from the United States Navy to the United States Coast Guard Category:Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet ",
