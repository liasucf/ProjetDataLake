It was released on 1 March 2018 through the record label Grand Production, after almost a seven-year hiatus, not counting album Izvorne i novokomponovane narodne pesme. The record was primarily produced by Atelje Trag. == Release == Brena announced on 21 February 2018 that her eighteenth album would be titled Zar je va\u017eno dal se peva ili pjeva and released on 1 March 2018. The album's lead single, \"Zar je va\u017eno da l' se peva ili pjeva\", was released on November 28, 2017. On December 28, 2017, Brena released a second single \"Boli\u0161 i ne prolazi\u0161\".

In January and February 2018, Atelje Trag, together with Brena, did finalize the album. For the first time, Brena collaborated with Dragan Brajovi\u0107 Braja on a new album. Braja wrote four songs, two ballads and two songs with modern sound. Marina Tucakovi\u0107 wrote 3 songs for Zar je va\u017eno dal se peva ili pjeva album. This is the 11th album on which Brena and Marina collaborated. Marina has repeatedly stated in the newspaper that she always enjoys working with Brena because she is not too demanding and has absolute confidence in her. Brena's stepson Filip \u017divojinovi\u0107, along with Braja wrote one of the most beautiful ballads in Brena's career, \"Boli\u0161 i ne prolazi\u0161\". For the first time, Brena collaborated with Serbian singer, Pe\u0111a Medenica. He wrote for her a ballad, \"A kako \u0107u ja\". == Background == After she presented the album Izvorne i novokomponovane narodne pesme (2013), Brena said that she was starting to work on a new album and that she wants to be an \"ultra-modern album with urban sound\". However, instead of an entire album, she released only a few singles. And as the reason for this, she cited the authors' crisis for good and quality songs. On December 28, 2013 she released the single \"Ljubav uvek \u010duvam za kraj\". The lyrics were written by the songwriter Marina Tucakovi\u0107, while Srki Boj was responsible for music. She previously announced the song with a snippet on Radio Pingvin, and talked about the new single. She said that the song was a New Year's gift for all her fans. On January 12, 2014 she released the single \"Zaljubljeni veruju u sve\". It is a song written exclusively for her by Hari Vare\u0161anovi\u0107, with whom she sang together at the New Year's Eve. On 14 September 2015 she released the single \"Ljubav nova\". The song was written by Alka Vuica and Amir Kazi\u0107 Leo. High-resolution music video, produced by Toxic Entertainment, was filmed with a movie camera at several locations on the Croatian coast. \"We expect the video to appear shortly after some more frames are edited, but also we have decided to move some of the borders when the video is in question\", Lepa Brena's team said. On February 14, 2016 she released the single \"\u017dali Bo\u017ee\". The text was written by Marina Tucakovi\u0107, and music by Damir Handanovi\u0107. On April 19, 2016 Brena released the single \"Carica\". This song was also written by Tucakovi\u0107 and Handanovi\u0107. The video for the song, as well as \"\u017dali Bo\u017ee\", was produced by Toxic Entertainment. Lepa Brena for the first time collaborated with Dragan \"Braja\" Brajovi\u0107 on the new album. Braja wrote four songs, two ballads and two songs with modern sound, as Brena wanted for the album. == Artwork and packaging == Zar je va\u017eno dal se peva ili pjeva cover art was photographed by Andrej Damjanovi\u0107, in Belgrade.
