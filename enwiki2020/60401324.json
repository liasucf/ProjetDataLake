In 1638, the pagoda was slightly damaged by lightning. ===Qing dynasty=== In 1645, in the 2nd year of Shunzhi period of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), a disastrous fire consumed the pagoda. In 1662, in the period of the Kangxi Emperor, magistrate Gao Tianjue () renovated and refurbished it. Due to the social taboo of \"Ming\" (Ming or Daming means the former Ming dynasty), its name was changed to \"Shuangjiang\" (). In 1754, during the Qianlong era, magistrate Yao Wenguang () supervised the restoration and renamed it \"Juxing\" (). ===Modern China=== In December 1987, it has been designated as a provincial level cultural heritage by the Jiangxi Provincial Government. The pagoda became dilapidated for neglect. In 1992, the restoration project was launched and was completed in October of the following year. In 2013, it inscribed to the seventh batch of \"List of Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Jiangxi\" by the State Council of China. ==Architecture== The pagoda was octagonal with seven stories. It is made of bricks. ==References== Category:Pagodas in China Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1614 Category:Ming dynasty architecture Category:Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Jiangxi Category:1614 establishments in China ",
