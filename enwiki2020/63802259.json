The initiative is made up of a group of people of different profiles, professions and beliefs interested in urban and cultural policies, sustainable urban development and equitable use of shared resources. == Political activities == === Early actions === Citizens of Belgrade have gathered around a civic initiative \"Do not let Belgrade d(r)own\", whose trademark has become a big yellow duck. The initiative have organized a number of actions and protests to criticize the Belgrade waterfront urban project which, according to them, is an extremely harmful project. The public attention was drawn during the protest of 26 April and in 2015 in front of the Belgrade Cooperatives building, during the signing of the Belgrade Waterfront Contract. Then a crowd gathered with the intervention of the police enclosed by stopping two GSP trams in the middle of a roundabout in front of the Cooperative building. The police have halted the performance of NDM BGD during the Belgrade Ship Carnival in 29 August 2015, when the duly registered vessel of the organization was excluded from the procession only because of the prominent inscription \"Do not let Belgrade D(r)own\".\u0411\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0442\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043e\u043c \u201e\u041d\u0435 \u0434\u0430(\u0432\u0438)\u043c\u043e \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u201d \u0443\u0434\u0430\u0459\u0435\u043d \u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430, \u041d1, 29 August 2015. === Activities after the Demolition in Savamala === As a result of the demolition of the facilities in Hercegovacka Street, which was carried out, according to a witness, by individuals with phantom masks, at night between 24 and 25 April 2016, this citizens' movement have organized 8 massive street protests from 11.
