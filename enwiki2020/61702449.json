In 1697 the Franciscans built a school beside it. In 1702 a parish was established and a cemetery was built around the chapel. The church was enlarged between 1728 and 1736, the work was led by master Christian Obergruber. The furnishings of the church are from 1748, including the pulpit and the atarpiece. The crypt was built in 1749. In the foreground is the \"Tab\u00e1n Christ\", a Romanesque tympanum fragment dating back to the 12th century, which was secondary to the wall of St. Catherine's Church. At front of this church was other church, the St Demeter Church of the Racis (Serbs), which was demolished after World War II in 1949. == Gallery == File:Taban20FotoThalerTamas.jpg|The church in 1830 File:Tab\u00e1n, r\u00e1c templom, Szent Katalin-templom, D\u00f6brentei t\u00e9r (1942) Fortepan 10633.jpg|Tab\u00e1n in 1942, to the left the St Demeter Church of the Racis SztKatalinTabanFotoThalerTamas1.jpg|View of the church from the Gell\u00e9rt Hill File:SztKatalinTabanFotoThalerTamas2.jpg|Interior File:TabaniKrisztusFotoThalerTamas.jpg|the 12th-century tympanum \"Tab\u00e1n Christ\" File:AlexandriaiFotoThalerTamas21.jpg|Holy Sepulcher File:Saint Catherine Church.
