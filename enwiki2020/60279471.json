He did not enter a plea. He was released on $500,000 bond. Assistant US Attorney Eric S. Rosen told the court Hodge was a flight risk with \u201cunlimited resources,\u201d and facing a maximum prison term of 20 years if convicted. The allegations detailed how Hodge paid entities controlled by William \u201cRick\u201d Singer (who has entered a guilty plea admitting that he was the ringleader of the scheme) and corrupt school officials, to bribe coaches and college officials to get them to present Hodge's children as sports team recruits, despite them not having the requisite athletic ability. Recruits had a better chance of being admitted, as compared to non-recruits with similar academic credentials.Laura Smith, Special Agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation (11 March 2019). \"Affidavit in Support of Criminal Complaint\". According to an FBI affidavit, Hodge first began paying Singer in 2008, when he wanted to have Georgetown University admit one of his daughters. Hodge's daughter then submitted an application to Georgetown asserting she had won a number of United States Tennis Association (USTA) tournaments, while in fact she had never played in a USTA match. The daughter was accepted to Georgetown with assistance from the tennis coach, who is now also being criminally charged, and she never played tennis at the university. According to the affidavit, in 2013 Hodge used Singer again, this time to help another daughter get into USC. She was falsely presented to a USC committee as a soccer recruit who had played on a national champion tournament team, was co-captain of a Japanese national team, and was an All-American. She was admitted into USC, but did not ever play soccer. Also according to the affidavit, in December 2014 Hodge asked Singer by e-mail if his son, who was in high school, was \u201creally qualified\u201d for USC. He added: \u201cHe would go there in a heartbeat!!\u201d Singer responded: \u201cNo but I can try to work a deal ... maybe Basketball or Football will give me a spot since their kids are not that strong.\u201d The next month Hodge's wife e-mailed Singer that she could not find photos of the son playing football, but had pictures of his brother playing football. Singer forwarded the note to a then-USC assistant soccer coach (who is now criminally charged), writing: \u201cSee below \u2014 I am sure there is a tennis one too. The boys look alike so I thought a football one would help too?\u201d Two days later, Hodge e-mailed a different USC athletic department official (who is now criminally charged): \u201cWe are preparing [my son's] 'sports resume' as you requested and should be able to send it on to you early next week.\u201d His athletic profile during the admissions process stated falsely that he played varsity football as a sophomore through his senior season, was the varsity team's captain, and that he had twice been a New Hampshire \u201cIndependent Schools All-American Selection,\u201d when in fact he had only played freshman football. The son was admitted to USC as a purported football recruit, but never joined the football team. Singer wrote to Hodge in an e-mail: \u201cObviously we have stretched the truth but this is what is done for all kids. Admissions just needs something to work with to show he is an athlete,\u201d the affidavit said. Also according to the affidavit, in August 2018 Hodge called Singer to ask about getting his youngest son into Loyola Marymount University. The FBI had a court-ordered wiretap, and listened in, as Hodge told Singer: \u201cWe don't have to talk in code. We know how this works.\u201d According to the affidavit, in November 2018 in a taped call Singer told Hodge that his charitable foundation was being audited. Hodge assured Singer that \u201cI'm not going off script here... That foundation has \u2014 its stated mission is to help underserved kids basically get into \u2014 you know, through \u2014 get through college. And that's all I'm going to say.\u201d he paid a total of $850,000 to Singer. The charges provide for sentences of a maximum of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. He pleaded guilty in October 2019 to conspiring to commit fraud and money laundering. In February 2020 he was sentenced to nine months in federal prison, and to pay a $750,000 fine and serve 500 hours of community service, as a result of the charges. He is imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville with a release date of 03/21/2021, and his inmate number is 01457-138.
