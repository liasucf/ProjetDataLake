The South Australian Film Corporation (SAFC) did not want to use Henri Safran as director, though, so employed another director from the ABC, Carl Schultz.David Stratton, The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival, Angus & Robertson, 1980 p271-272 The film was shot near Streaky Bay in mid 1978. ===Reshoots=== During post production editor Rod Adamson claimed the film would not cut together. Five weeks after filming had completed, Schultz had to leave the film to take up a directing job at the ABC. Accordingly, Matt Carroll of the SAFC called in Bruce Beresford, who was under contract to them, to re-shoot some sequences. Some of these had to be done using a body double for Hardy Kruger since he had returned to Europe. Schultz was supportive of Beresford stepping in but was unhappy with the fact he supervised the final re-cut.Peter Beilby & Rod Bishop, \"Carl Schultz\", Cinema Papers, Jan-Feb 1979 p242 ==Proposed Remake== In 2017 it was announced the movie would be remade. ==DVD release== A DVD was released on 1 January 2003. ==See also== *Cinema of Australia *South Australian Film Corporation ==References== ==External links== * *Blue Fin at Oz Movies * Blue Fin at the National Film and Sound Archive *Blue Fin at Screen Australia *Blue Fin at The New York Times *Pacific International Enterprises Category:Australian films Category:1978 films Category:1978 drama films Category:1978 independent films Category:Australian drama films Category:Australian independent films Category:Films about fishing Category:Films based on Australian novels Category:Films directed by Carl Schultz Category:Films shot in Adelaide Category:Films set in South Australia Category:Survival films Category:Australian novels adapted into films Category:1978 directorial debut films ",
