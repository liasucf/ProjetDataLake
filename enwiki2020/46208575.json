    "text": "Yoann Barbet (born 10 May 1993) is a French professional footballer who plays as a central defender or left back for Queens Park Rangers. A product of the Bordeaux youth system, Barbet signed his first professional contract with Chamois Niortais ahead of the 2014\u201315 season. He was capped by France at U18 level. ==Club career== === Bordeaux === As a youngster, Barbet represented AS Mouliets, Olympique Saint-Pey and FC Vall\u00e9e de Gamage, before joining the youth setup at Ligue 1 club Bordeaux in July 2007. He made his debut for the club's reserve team in a 3\u20130 win against Saint-Alban on 2 April 2011 and went on to make a further four appearances during the final month of the season, helping the team to promotion to the Championnat de France Amateur. Over the next three seasons, Barbet established himself as a regular in the Bordeaux reserve line-up, making 70 appearances and scoring 12 goals. He finally won his maiden call into the first team squad for a Europa League group stage match versus Maccabi Tel Aviv on 12 December 2013, but remained an unused substitute during the 1\u20130 defeat. It was Barbet's only involvement with the first team and he departed the Stade Chaban-Delmas at the end of the 2013\u201314 season. === Chamois Niortais === Barbet joined Ligue 2 club in Chamois Niortais in July 2014, signing a two-year contract after a successful trial period. Initially signed as a back-up player, Barbet was given his chance at Niort after first-choice central defender Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bong suffered a long-term injury. He made the first professional appearance of his career in a 1\u20131 draw with Cr\u00e9teil on 22 August 2014, partnering Matthieu Sans in central defence. Barbet scored his first goal for the side in a 1\u20131 draw with Orl\u00e9ans the following month. He made 33 appearances and scored two goals during a mid- table season for Niort and departed the club on 25 June 2015. === Brentford === On 25 June 2015, Barbet moved to England to sign a four-year contract with Championship club Brentford for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut with a start in a 4\u20130 League Cup first round drubbing at the hands of Oxford United on 11 August and possibly put through his own net for the Us' second goal, which was credited to Danny Hylton. With Jack O'Connell largely preferred as third-choice centre back behind Harlee Dean and James Tarkowski, Barbet spent long periods in and out of the matchday squad through to the end of 2015. The unavailability of Tarkowski saw Barbet make his first appearance in over four months against Preston North End on 23 January 2016 and he assisted Alan Judge for one of Brentford's three goals in the victory. Tarkowski's subsequent departure from the club saw Barbet become Harlee Dean's partner in central defence through to the end of the 2015\u201316 season. He was sent off for the first time in his career after just five minutes of a match versus Sheffield Wednesday on 13 February, which Brentford eventually lost 4\u20130. On his return to the team in March, Barbet scored his first Bees goal with what proved to be a consolation in a 2\u20131 defeat to Charlton Athletic. He finished the 2015\u201316 season with 19 appearances. After suffering an ankle injury during the 2016\u201317 pre-season, Barbet missed the first five weeks of the regular season. The form of centre backs Harlee Dean, John Egan, Andreas Bjelland and the emergence of teenage left back Tom Field relegated Barbet to a substitute role through the first half of the season, with occasional appearances at left back. After just three appearances in the opening months of 2017, Barbet broke into the team at the expense of centre back John Egan in mid-March and finished the season with 25 appearances. Barbet began the 2017\u201318 season as one of manager Dean Smith's two first-choice centre backs, before dropping to the bench in October 2017. Despite being in and out of the team, he scored three goals in five appearances between September and November. With Rico Henry injured, Barbet was deployed as a left back for much of the season and finished the campaign with 37 appearances and three goals. Entering the final year of his contract, Barbet continued as Dean Smith's first-choice left back during the early months of the 2018\u201319 season and after losing his place to fit-again Rico Henry, he returned to the team in as part of a central defensive trio under Smith's replacement Thomas Frank in December 2018. Barbet continued as a starter in the new formation until suffering a season-ending ankle injury in a match versus Wigan Athletic on 30 March 2019. Barbet rejected a new contract during the season and ended his Brentford career with 118 appearances and seven goals. === Queens Park Rangers === On 18 June 2019, Barbet joined Queens Park Rangers on a three-year deal. https://www.qpr.co.uk/news/club-news/yoann- barbet-signs-for-qpr/ He scored his first goal for the club in a 3-2 defeat to Coventry City in the second game of the 2020-21 season.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/54113088 ==International career== Barbet was capped by the France national under-18 football team on one occasion, playing 45 minutes in a 2\u20132 friendly draw with Belgium on 27 January 2011. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club ! rowspan=\"2\" |Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |Bordeaux |2013\u201314 |Ligue 1 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |- | rowspan=\"5\" |Bordeaux B |2010\u201311 |CFA2 Group F |5||3|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||5||3 |- |2011\u201312 |CFA Group C |16||2|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||16||2 |- |2012\u201313 | rowspan=\"2\" |CFA Group D |30||7|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||30||7 |- |2013\u201314 |24||3|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||24||3 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total ! 75 !! 15 !! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 !! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014!! 75 !! 15 |- |Chamois Niortais |2014\u201315 |Ligue 2 |30||2||2||0||0||0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||32||2 |- | rowspan=\"5\" |Brentford |2015\u201316 | rowspan=\"4\" |Championship |18 |1 |0 |0 |1 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |19 |1 |- |2016\u201317 |23 |1 |2 |1 |0 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |25 |2 |- |2017\u201318 |34 |3 |1 |0 |2 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |37 |3 |- |2018\u201319 |33 |1 |2 |0 |2 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |37 |1 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !108 !6 !5 !1 !5 !0 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 !118 !7 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Queens Park Rangers |2019-20 | rowspan=\"2\" |Championship |27 |0 |0 |0 |2 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |29 |0 |- |2020-21 |2 |1 |0 |0 |0 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |1 |0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !29 !0 !0 !0 !2 !0 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 !31 !1 |- ! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |Total !243!!24!!7!!1!!7!! 0 !0 !0!!255!!24 |} ==References== ==External links== * Yoann Barbet at brentfordfc.com * * * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from Libourne Category:Sportspeople from Gironde Category:French footballers Category:France youth international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:FC Girondins de Bordeaux players Category:Chamois Niortais F.C. players Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:Championnat National 2 players Category:Ligue 2 players Category:English Football League players Category:French expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:French expatriate sportspeople in England ",
