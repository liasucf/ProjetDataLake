    "text": "Brian J. McLaughlin (born ca.1957) is a former member of the Boston City Council, having held the District 9 seat from 1984 through 1995. ==Career== McLaughlin graduated from Stonehill College in Easton, Massachusetts, and before running for office was a community organizer, mainly on housing issues. McLaughlin was first elected to the City Council in November 1983, representing District 9 (Allston\u2013Brighton). He was subsequently re-elected five times, each term being for two years. His November 1987 victory was quite narrow; after finishing second in the preliminary election, McLaughlin won the general election by only 121 votes (4,627 to 4,506), with a recount later confirming his win. His November 1993 re-election also had to be confirmed by a recount. During his time on the council, McLaughlin was a strong advocate of rent control. In March 1995, McLaughlin announced that he would not seek re- election. He later became executive secretary of the Boston Parks and Recreation Commission. ==See also== * Boston City Council election, 1983 * Boston City Council election, 1985 * Boston City Council election, 1987 * Boston City Council election, 1989 * Boston City Council election, 1991 * Boston City Council election, 1993 ==References== ==External links== * McLaughlin election records at ourcampaigns.com Category:Living people Category:20th century in Boston Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Boston City Council members Category:Stonehill College alumni Category:1950s births Category:People from Allston\u2013Brighton ",
