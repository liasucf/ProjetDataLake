The book begins in 1941 when Rob is six and his idol, Rick, is sent off to war. By the time Rick has returned after spending time as a prisoner of war Rob's view of the world has changed markedly and his childhood has ended. ==Critical reception== Maurice Dunlevy came late to the book so didn't review it in The Canberra Times until 1972 when he called it \"not so much a novel as a lyric poem...The Merry-Go-Round in the Sea is a beautiful book, a novel full of controlled evocative prose, a haunting sense of place, and a wonderfully consistent structure of imagery.\"\"Writers' World\" by Maurice Dunlevy, The Canberra Times, 23 December 1972, p8 In a survey of the author's work for Australian Book Review in 2009, Tony Hassall has no doubts about the novel's worth: \"The book captures the contradictory feelings of its author as he looks back on a golden childhood with fierce nostalgic longing, while at the same time seeing it as transient and irrevocably separate from mature experience... In its sensitive exploration of Rob\u2019s reluctant progression into a world of divided allegiances, The Merry-Go-Round in the Sea stands alongside earlier Australian classics like Henry Handel Richardson\u2019s The Fortunes of Richard Mahony and Martin Boyd\u2019s Lucinda Brayford.\"\"Vanishing Wunderkind\" by Tony Hassall, Australian Book Review, September 2009 ==See also== * 1965 in Australian literature ==References== Category:1965 Australian novels Category:Randolph Stow ",
