Since he was a child Mart\u00ednez was connected to photography through his contact with amateur and professional photographers, including his father, Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez, a doctor, historian and photographer. (Gea, J.C., Donde habita la belleza, La Nueva Espa\u00f1a, 12 de julio de 2009, retrieved 19 December 2016). These experiences allowed him to learn how to handle various manual cameras, like the mythical Nikon F, and learned the use and tricks of the dark room, the enlarger, the chemical used in processing and other methods used on that time. Mart\u00ednez studied in the Complutense University of Madrid where he earned a bachelor's degree in Communication Studies, with a major in Audiovisual Communication, in 1989. From 1995 through 2005, Mart\u00ednez lived in Lustenau, in the region of Vorarlberg, Austria where he developed his specialization on architecture. ==Early work== Since 1982 Mart\u00ednez worked as a press and publishers photographer. After his bachelor's degree studies, he studied in the Madrid \u201cFlash\u201d Technical School of Photography, Video and Television (Escuela T\u00e9cnica de Fotograf\u00eda, V\u00eddeo y Televisi\u00f3n \u201cFlash\u201d de Madrid), in the University of Oviedo, and in the City of Dornbirn Museum in Austria. ==Professional career== Since 1995 Mart\u00ednez has worked as an architectural photographer with important influences in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy and Spain, he was hired from architects, institutions, publishers and museums. Mart\u00ednez lived in the region Voralberg, Austria which is characterized by its architecture. Especially the natural landscape combined with construction which are ecologically sustainable. (Contal, Marie-Helen and Revedin, Jana, Sustainable Design, Towards a new ethic in architecture and town planning, Birkhauser, Basel, 2009, p. 62) Following that same characteristics, his photography does not have a traditional perspective, but it is \u201coften mysterious and poetic, more than the pure description of the building\u201d. ( Vorarlberg Nachrichten, 15\u201316 September 2012. P. 16) The renowned Austrian architectural photographer, Margherita Spiluttini, affirmed that Mart\u00ednez is \u201cundoubtedly one of the most important architectural photographers in Europe. His work is characterized by an extremely professional, analytical and sensitive view\u201d. The Vorarlberg National Library in Austria has an extensive catalog of part of his photographic work. The graphic ogram of Ignacio Mart\u00ednez is preserved in the Vorarlber National Library in Austria. Mart\u00ednez is a member of the Architectural Photographers Association in Austria. Currently he lives and works in Navia (Asturias), Spain. One of his most recent works is the photographic documentation about the evolution of the construction of the Asturias Central University Hospital (Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias \u2013 HUCA). ==Artistic work== Expositions * Some of the numerous expositions on which Mart\u00ednez has participated are: * Photographic exhibition \u201cThe Mute Eye\u201d.
