    "text": "Pi Hydrae (\u03c0 Hya, \u03c0 Hydrae) is a star in the constellation Hydra with an apparent visual magnitude of 3.3, making it visible to the naked eye. Parallax measurements put this star at a distance of about from the Earth. The spectrum of this star shows it to have a stellar classification of K1 III-IV, with the luminosity class of 'III-IV' suggesting it is in an evolutionary transition stage somewhere between a subgiant and a giant star. It has a low projected rotational velocity of 2.25 km s\u22121. Pi Hydrae is radiating energy from its outer envelope with an effective temperature of 4,670 K, giving it the orange hue of a K-type star. Pi Hydrae is a type of giant known as a cyanogen-weak star, which means that its spectrum displays weak absorption lines of CN\u2212 relative to the metallicity. (The last is a term astronomers use when describing the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium.) Otherwise, it appears to be a normal star of its evolutionary class, having undergone first dredge-up of nuclear fusion by-products onto its surface layers. The measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening, is . At its estimated distance, this yields a physical size of about 12\u201313 times the radius of the Sun. It has an estimated mass of 2.45 times the mass of the Sun. == References == {0.0046491\\ \\text{AU}/R_{\\bigodot}} \\\\\\ & \\approx 25.1\\cdot R_{\\bigodot} \\end{align} }} ==External links== * Hydrae, Pi Category:Hydra (constellation) Hydrae, 49 068895 Category:K-type giants Category:K-type subgiants 123123 5827 Category:Durchmusterung objects ",
