Defending champions CSKA Moscow claimed their second successive title on 18 November 2006 with an away win over Luch-Energiya Vladivostok. Spartak Moscow finished runners-up, level on points with CSKA but ranked behind due to fewer wins (see Tie-breaking criteria below). Lokomotiv Moscow finished third. Torpedo Moscow and Shinnik were relegated. It was the first time in Torpedo Moscow's history that the club was relegated. == Tie-breaking criteria == Based on paragraph 15.3 of the Russian Premier League regulations for the current season, if two or more teams are equal on points (without having the highest number), the positions of these teams are determined by: # higher number of wins in all matches; # higher goal difference in all matches; # results of matches between the teams in question (1. higher number of points obtained; 2. higher number of wins; 3. higher goal difference; 4. higher number of goals scored; 5. higher number of away goals scored); # higher number of goals scored in all matches; # higher number of away goals scored in all matches; # drawing of lots.
