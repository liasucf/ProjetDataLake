She won several golf events, owned a racehorse, and played lawn tennis. She was a clubwoman, and served as vice president of the Northside Chicago branch of the Illinois Woman Suffrage League. The Chatfield-Taylors were also members of the \"Little Room\", a social gathering of artists, writers, and performers.

She wrote about bookbinding for the Sketch Book magazine. == Personal life == In 1890, Rose Farwell married wealthy writer, social host, and sportsman Hobart Chatfield-Taylor.
