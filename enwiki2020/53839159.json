    "text": "Shahul Hameed Hasbullah (; 3 September 1950 - 25 August 2018) was a Sri Lankan social activist, geographer and academic. ==Early life and family== Hasbullah was born on 3 September 1950 in Erukkulampiddy in northern Ceylon. He was educated at Erukkulampiddy Central College. He obtained a B.A degree from the Peradeniya campus of the University of Sri Lanka in 1975. He also received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of British Columbia. Hasbullah had a son and two daughters. ==Career== Hasbullah was professor of geography at the University of Peradeniya. He was a visiting scholar at the University of Zurich, University of Edinburgh, Norwegian University of Science and Technology and University of British Columbia (2004). He was a visiting Fulbright scholar at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of International Migration. Hasbullah was a resource person during the 2003 Sri Lankan peace talks facilitated by Norway in Thailand, Germany, and Japan and was member of the Sub-committee on Immediate and Humanitarian Needs of the War-torn Areas of Sri Lanka. He was a UGC appointed member of the council of the University of Jaffna. He was a member of the board of directors of the International Centre for Ethnic Studies (ICES). He was a member of the 2017-18 provincial council delimitation committee. On 25 August 2018 Hasbullah suffered a heart attack during a meeting at the University of Jaffna and died after being admitted to Jaffna Teaching Hospital. His death came the day after the delimitation committee's report was rejected by Parliament by 139 votes to nil.
