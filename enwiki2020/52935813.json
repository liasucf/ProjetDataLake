    "text": "In algebraic geometry, a relative effective Cartier divisor is roughly a family of effective Cartier divisors. Precisely, an effective Cartier divisor in a scheme X over a ring R is a closed subscheme D of X that (1) is flat over R and (2) the ideal sheaf I(D) of D is locally free of rank one (i.e., invertible sheaf). Equivalently, a closed subscheme D of X is an effective Cartier divisor if there is an open affine cover U_i = \\operatorname{Spec} A_i of X and nonzerodivisors f_i \\in A_i such that the intersection D \\cap U_i is given by the equation f_i = 0 (called local equations) and A / f_i A is flat over R and such that they are compatible. == An effective Cartier divisor as the zero-locus of a section of a line bundle == Let L be a line bundle on X and s a section of it such that s: \\mathcal{O}_X \\hookrightarrow L (in other words, s is a \\mathcal{O}_X(U)-regular element for any open subset U.) Choose some open cover \\\\{ U_i \\\\} of X such that L|_{U_i} \\simeq \\mathcal{O}_X|_{U_i}. For each i, through the isomorphisms, the restriction s|_{U_i} corresponds to a nonzerodivisor f_i of \\mathcal{O}_X(U_i). Now, define the closed subscheme \\\\{ s = 0 \\\\} of X (called the zero-locus of the section s) by :\\\\{ s = 0 \\\\} \\cap U_i = \\\\{ f_i = 0 \\\\}, where the right-hand side means the closed subscheme of U_i given by the ideal sheaf generated by f_i. This is well-defined (i.e., they agree on the overlaps) since f_i/f_j|_{U_i \\cap U_j} is a unit element. For the same reason, the closed subscheme \\\\{ s = 0 \\\\} is independent of the choice of local trivializations. Equivalently, the zero locus of s can be constructed as a fiber of a morphism; namely, viewing L as the total space of it, the section s is a X-morphism of L: a morphism s: X \\to L such that s followed by L \\to X is the identity. Then \\\\{ s = 0 \\\\} may be constructed as the fiber product of s and the zero- section embedding s_0: X \\to L. Finally, when \\\\{ s = 0 \\\\} is flat over the base scheme S, it is an effective Cartier divisor on X over S. Furthermore, this construction exhausts all effective Cartier divisors on X as follows. Let D be an effective Cartier divisor and I(D) denote the ideal sheaf of D. Because of locally-freeness, taking I(D)^{-1} \\otimes_{\\mathcal{O}_X} - of 0 \\to I(D) \\to \\mathcal{O}_X \\to \\mathcal{O}_D \\to 0 gives the exact sequence :0 \\to \\mathcal{O}_X \\to I(D)^{-1} \\to I(D)^{-1} \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_D \\to 0 In particular, 1 in \\Gamma(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) can be identified with a section in \\Gamma(X, I(D)^{-1}), which we denote by s_D. Now we can repeat the early argument with L = I(D)^{-1}. Since D is an effective Cartier divisor, D is locally of the form \\\\{ f = 0 \\\\} on U = \\operatorname{Spec}(A) for some nonzerodivisor f in A. The trivialization L|_U = Af^{-1} \\overset{\\sim}\\to A is given by multiplication by f; in particular, 1 corresponds to f. Hence, the zero-locus of s_D is D. == Properties == *If D and D' are effective Cartier divisors, then the sum D + D' is the effective Cartier divisor defined locally as fg = 0 if f, g give local equations for D and D' . *If D is an effective Cartier divisor and R \\to R' is a ring homomorphism, then D \\times_R R' is an effective Cartier divisor in X \\times_R R'. *If D is an effective Cartier divisor and f: X' \\to X a flat morphism over R, then D' = D \\times_X X' is an effective Cartier divisor in X' with the ideal sheaf I(D') = f^* (I(D)). == Examples == === Hyperplane bundle === === Effective Cartier divisors on a relative curve === From now on suppose X is a smooth curve (still over R). Let D be an effective Cartier divisor in X and assume it is proper over R (which is immediate if X is proper.) Then \\Gamma(D, \\mathcal{O}_D) is a locally free R-module of finite rank. This rank is called the degree of D and is denoted by \\deg D. It is a locally constant function on \\operatorname{Spec} R. If D and D' are proper effective Cartier divisors, then D + D' is proper over R and \\deg(D + D') = \\deg(D) + \\deg(D'). Let f: X' \\to X be a finite flat morphism. Then \\deg(f^* D) = \\deg(f) \\deg(D). On the other hand, a base change does not change degree: \\deg(D \\times_R R') = \\deg(D). A closed subscheme D of X is finite, flat and of finite presentation if and only if it is an effective Cartier divisor that is proper over R. == Weil divisors associated to effective Cartier divisors == Given an effective Cartier divisor D, there are two equivalent ways to associate Weil divisor [D] to it. == Notes == == References == * Category:Algebraic geometry ",
