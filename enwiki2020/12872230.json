    "text": "The Ontario Tech Ridgebacks are the athletic teams that represent University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. The University of Ontario Institute of Technology was founded in 2002. The Ridgebacks have been competing in Ontario University Athletics since 2006 and have been a member of U Sports since 2008. The Ontario Tech Ridgebacks compete in badminton, soccer, lacrosse, curling, golf, rowing, dance, and hockey. Formerly, the Ridgebacks had a tennis program. However, in 2016 after 10 seasons the university decided to eliminate the tennis program in favour of creating a badminton program. ==Logo and mascot== UOIT's athletic team colours are blue and white. The university's mascot and logo is based on a Rhodesian Ridgeback breed of dog. From the Ridgebacks' website, 2013: > \u201c[The Rhodesian Ridgeback] is a large and well muscled hunting dog that is > legendary for its ability and use in hunting down lions. Strong and > extremely competitive by nature, the Ridgeback is also lightning quick and > deftly alert while constantly paying attention to its surroundings. Known as > a dominant dog with aggressive instincts, the Ridgeback moves, not only like > a hunting dog, but like a dog of prey. It is strong willed and confident and > thrives on vigorous exercise and athletic activities. It is equally as tough > in the water as it is on land.\u201d ==Men's ice hockey== Ridgebacks' goalie Jesse Raymond ready for a face-off (September 2013) Ridgebacks' warming up the goalie (September 2013) The current head coach of the team is Curtis Hodgins.

Craig Fisher, whose hiring was announced two weeks before the start of the 13-14 OUA playoffs, was the result of the university's search for new direction after the disappointment of recent seasons; placing emphasis on improving academics, and team culture. In Curtis Hodgins' inaugural year (2015\u201316) with the Ontario Tech Ridgebacks the team set the new season high in wins and points, earned the team's first ever playoff round victory, and received the team's first ever vote for the CIS Top 10 ranking.

Muylaert ended his seventh season behind the bench early and was let go midway through the '13\u201314 campaign.
