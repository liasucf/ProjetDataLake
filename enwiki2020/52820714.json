    "text": "\"T-Shirt\" is a trap song by American hip hop group Migos. It impacted radio on February 14, 2017 as the second single from their second studio album Culture (2017). The song was produced by American production duo Nard & B, alongside their TrenchWerk cohort XL. The song peaked in the top 20 of the US Billboard Hot 100, and had acquired 235 million YouTube views and 240 million Spotify plays by January 2018. Music critic Simon Reynolds praised \"T-Shirt\" as \"vocal alchemy via Auto-Tune, turning profane tales of fast lane life into a holy trance, a choral weave of glistening rap, ecstatic ad libs, and a wordless backing ripple of Gregorian gurgles and droning moans.\" ==Music video== The music video for the song, directed by DAPS and Quavo, features the trio dressed as Arctic hunters in fur and Versace snow boots, with snowmobiles, spears and practicing archery, alongside three women. It was filmed at a mountain range near Lake Tahoe. The video premiered on January 6, 2017 via Migos' YouTube channel. ==Live performances== On March 23, 2017, Migos performed \"T-Shirt\", alongside The Roots, on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. == Charts == === Weekly charts === {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP) | 127 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseekers (RMNZ) | 5 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Canada (Canadian Hot 100) | 78 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Hot 100 | 52 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) | 25 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Country !scope=\"col\"|Date !scope=\"col\"|Format !scope=\"col\"|Label !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | United States | February 14, 2017 | Urban contemporary | | |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 songs Category:Migos songs Category:300 Entertainment singles Category:Song recordings produced by Nard & B Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:2017 singles Category:Songs written by Quavo Category:Songs written by Offset (rapper) Category:Songs written by Takeoff (rapper) Category:Songs about clothing and fashion ",
