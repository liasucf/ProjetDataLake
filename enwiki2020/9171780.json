    "text": "Mar\u00eda Teresa Vera (February 6, 1895 in Guanajay \u2013 December 17, 1965 in Havana) was a Cuban singer, guitarist and composer. She was an outstanding example of the Cuban trova movement.Calderon, Jorge 1983. Maria Teresa Vera. La Habana. == Career == She started her career as a singer in 1911 in a theatre where she sang the criolla Mercedes of Manuel Corona. Her first guitar teacher was the cigar-roller Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz. Manuel Corona continued her musical education by explaining such things as the different methods for first and second guitar, and eventually taught her his compositions. That was without question of the greatest benefit to the young girl. She formed a duo with Rafael Zequeira from 1916-1924, when he fell ill and died. They had made over a hundred recordings together in New York, most of which have not survived. Then she met Carlos Godinez, a composer, who taught her more about the guitar; the friendship lasted until his death in 1950. She then formed the Sexteto Occidente in 1925 with Miguel Garc\u00eda as first voice, clav\u00e9 and Director (because he knew most about music), Ignacio Pi\u00f1eiro on double bass, Julio Torres Biart on tres, Manuel Reinoso on bongo and Francisco S\u00e1nchez on maracas. They were a group of talented musicians who would have sparkling careers.Tumbao TCD-087 Sexteto Occidente: Yo no tumbo ca\u00f1a liner notes She joined Lorenzo Hierrezuelo as a duet in 1935, and this duet lasted for 27 years. For much of this time Hierrezuelo ran his duo with Vera alongside his partnership with Compay Segundo (Francisco Repilado), as the duo Los Compadres. One of her best compositions, the habanera Veinte a\u00f1os,a bolero\u2013son in the arrangement by Antonio Mar\u00eda Romeu has been performed by a number of Cuban artists; S\u00f3lo pienso en ti, a bolero-son, is also well-known. In 1945 she was contracted to Circuito CMQ for the radio program Cosas de Ayer. In the 1950s, she appeared in the TV program El Casino de la Alegr\u00eda and in the 1960s she received public tributes on her retirement in 1962. == Opinions of her == In his biography Jorge Calder\u00f3n gives the opinions of 32 Cuban composers and musicians on her career. Silvio Rodr\u00edguez said of her: :\"Her voice was without vibrato, dry; hitting the notes, only prolonging a note so as to slide from one tone to another, which gave [her voice] a grace, or, much better, a singular character . Her production seemed nonchalent, natural, colloquial... Always there were variations on the original melody, [since] she was always interpreting [the piece] creatively.\" Pablo Milan\u00e9s contented himself with saying \"Mar\u00eda Teresa is for me the embodiment of Cuban song.\"Calderon, Jorge 1983. Maria Teresa Vera. Opinions on pages 110-143; Rodrigues on p137. La Habana. Mar\u00eda Teresa Linares, the musicologist, said of her and Hierrezuelo: :\"I believe the most important period [for them] was their 27 years as a duet, Lorenzo on first guitar, Vera on second. Hierrezuelo's voice was at its best... [and] Mar\u00eda Teresa's voice was unrivalled at the time. The quality of their appoggiaturas, adornments, refinements, and their interpretation... reached its highest point. All in all, it was the most sublime expression of the Cuban song.\"Ma.
