In 2011, after his mother passed away from cancer, Turpin began making music as an outlet to express his emotions while grieving her loss. == Music career == In 2013, Turpin released his debut single \"Cranes\" which garnered enough interest for him to start performing around Johannesburg.

In 2017, he released his first full-length mixtape \"4am In Jozi\", a musical ode to the night-time anxieties of central Johannesburg.
