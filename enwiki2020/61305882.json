Toronto Star, January 21, 1994. The film stars Don McKellar as Ray Bud, a Toronto man taking a film crew on a walking tour of Thorncliffe Park, ostensibly to show where he purportedly found a mastodon skeleton in childhood, but ultimately revealing much more about his own teenage history of engaging in petty vandalism to cope with his sense of alienation in an urban neighbourhood defined entirely by non-descript concrete high rise apartments.\"Director digs deep to uncover urban life Arrowhead an archeological excursion into highrise life\". Toronto Star, January 19, 1994. Asked to describe the film's themes, Lynch characterized it as \"if you took Jurassic Park, Home Alone and Wayne's World and turned it into a BBC archeology documentary on highrise living, you would get Arrowhead.\" The film was inspired by Lynch's rediscovery as an adult of an old indigenous arrowhead he had found as a child. The film had its theatrical premiere in Toronto in January 1994, as the opening film to screenings of the French film Barjo.Geoff Pevere, \"Film Review: Barjo\". The Globe and Mail, January 21, 1994.
