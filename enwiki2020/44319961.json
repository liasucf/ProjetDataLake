    "text": "Lorenzo Ferguson \"Fuzzy\" Woodruff (May 27, 1884 - December 7, 1929) was an early 20th-century American sportswriter known throughout most of the southeast for his vivid writing. He was also a music and drama critic. He began his newspaper career as a member of the Montgomery Advertiser in 1907. Among the newspapers he served were the Birmingham News, the Birmingham Age- Herald, the New Orleans States, the Mobile Register, the New York Evening World, the Chicago Inter-Ocean, the Chicago Examiner, the St. Louis Dispatch, the Atlanta Constitution, the Atlanta Georgian, and the Atlanta Journal. ==College football== Sewanee's \"Iron Men\" of 1899. Recalling the only game in which the 'Iron Men' of the undefeated 1899 Sewanee Tigers football team, who won five road games in six days, were scored upon-by John Heisman's Auburn team in a close 11 to 10 win, Woodruff wrote: > Under Heisman's tutelage, Auburn played with a marvelous speed and dash that > couldn't be gainsaid and which fairly swept Sewanee off its feet.

Woodruff wrote Dan McGugin \"stood out in the South like Gulliver among the native sons of Lilliput.\" A Sewanee legend of just a few years after, Henry D. Phillips, was called by Woodruff \"the greatest football player who ever sank cleated shoes into a chalk line south of the Mason-Dixon line.\" Of Vanderbilt's winningest coach Dan McGugin, Woodruff wrote \"The plain facts of the business are that McGugin stood out in the South like Gulliver among the native sons of Lilliput. There was no foeman worthy of the McGugin steel.\u201d After the loss of Knute Rockne's Fighting Irish to Georgia Tech in 1928, Rockne wrote of an attack on his coaching in the Atlanta Journal, \"I am surprised that a paper of such fine, high standing [as yours] would allow a zipper to write in his particular vein . . . the article by Fuzzy Woodruff was not called for.\" The last game he ever covered was the Alabama-Tennessee game of 1929. ==Death== Woodruff's tombstone is inscribed \"Copy All In\". Three rifle volleys were fired over the grave and taps played on an army bugle as his casket was lowered into Crestlawn Cemetery, Atlanta. Woodruff was buried in a bloodstained overseas uniform that he brought back. The blood on the uniform was not his own but that of a foreign youth who died in his arms as \"Fuzzy\" led his men over the top at the Battle of Soissons. \"He was a nice boy and I liked him\" declared \"Fuzzy\" in explaining the attachment to the uniform. ==Bibliography== A History of Southern Football, 1890-1928 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1884 births Category:1929 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Montgomery, Alabama Category:University of Alabama alumni Category:Sportswriters from Alabama Category:Journalists from Alabama ",
