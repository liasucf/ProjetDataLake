    "text": "The Carian language is an extinct language of the Luwian subgroup of the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European language family. The Carian language was spoken in Caria, a region of western Anatolia between the ancient regions of Lycia and Lydia, by the Carians, a name possibly first mentioned in Hittite sources. Carian is closely related to Lycian and Milyan (Lycian B), and both are closely related to, though not direct descendants of, Luwian. Whether the correspondences between Luwian, Carian, and Lycian are due to direct descent (i.e. a language family as represented by a tree-model), or are due to dialect geography, is disputed.Melchert, H. C. 2008. \u2018Lycian\u2019. In The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor, ed. R. D. Woodard, 46\u201355 at p. 46. Cambridge. Prior to the late 20th century CE the language remained a total mystery even though many characters of the script appeared to be from the Greek alphabet. Using Greek phonetic values of letters investigators of the 19th and 20th centuries were unable to make headway and classified the language as non-Indo-European. Speculations multiplied, none very substantial. Progress finally came as a result of rejecting the presumption of Greek phonetic values. ==Sources== Carian is known from these sources:. Translator Chris Markham. * Personal names with a suffix of -\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (-assis), -\u03c9\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (-\u014dllos) or -\u03c9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 (-\u014dmos) in Greek records * Twenty inscriptions from Caria including four bilinguals * Inscriptions of the Caromemphites, an ethnic enclave at Memphis, Egypt * Graffiti elsewhere in Egypt * Scattered inscriptions elsewhere in the Aegean world * Words stated to be Carian by ancient authors. == Phonology == === Consonants === In the chart below, the Carian letter is given, followed by the transcription. Where the transcription differs from IPA, the phonetic value is given in brackets. Many Carian phonemes were represented by multiple letter forms in various locations. The Egypto-Carian dialect seems to have preserved semivowels w, j, and \u00fd lost or left unwritten in other varieties. Two Carian letters have unknown phonetic values: \ud800\udeb1 and \ud800\udec6. The letter \ud800\udeb6 \u03c42 may have been equivalent to \ud800\udec7 \u03c4. {| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" ! !Bilabial !Alveolar !Postalveolar !Palatal !Velar !Labiovelar |- align=\"center\" !Plosive |\ud800\udeb7 '''' |\ud800\udead '''' | |\ud800\udeb4, \ud800\ude9b k\u0302 [c] |\ud800\udebc,\ud800\udebd k |\ud800\udea8 q [k\u02b7] |- align=\"center\" !Prenasalized |\ud800\udecc \u03b2 [\u1d50b] |\ud800\udebe \u03b4 [\u207fd] | | |\ud800\udec4 \u014b [\u207fg]? |\ud800\udec0,\ud800\udec1 \u03b3 [\u207fg\u02b7]? |- align=\"center\" !Nasal |\ud800\udeaa '''' |\ud800\udeb5, \ud800\ude9c '''' \ud800\udeb3 \u00f1 [n\u0329, n\u031a] | | colspan=\"2\" | | |- align=\"center\" !Fricative |\ud800\udeac, \u039b b [\u03b2~\u0278] |\ud800\udea2 d [\u00f0~\u03b8] \ud800\udeb0 '''' |\ud800\udeae,\ud800\udeaf,\ud802\udd2d \u0161 [\u0283] |\ud800\udeb8 \u015b [\u00e7] | colspan=\"2\" | |- align=\"center\" !Affricate | |\ud800\udec2 z |\ud800\udec7 \u03c4 [t\u0361\u0283] \ud800\udeb6 \u03c42 [t\u0361\u0283]? | | | |- align=\"center\" !Trill | |\ud800\udea5 '''' | | | | |- !Lateral | |\ud800\udea3, \ud800\udece, \ud800\udec3 l \ud800\udea6, \ud800\udea3 \u03bb [l:, ld] \ud800\udec3, \ud800\udec9 \u013a [l]? | | | | |- align=\"center\" !Approximant |\ud800\udebf '\u2020 | | |\ud800\udec5 '\u2020 |\ud800\udebb,\ud800\udec8,\ud800\uded0 \u00fd [\u0265]\u2020 | |} \u2020 Phonemes attested in Egypto-Carian only. ==== Lateral sounds ==== Across the various sites where inscriptions have been found, the two lateral phonemes /l/ and /\u03bb/ contrast but may be represented by different letters of the Carian script \ud800\udea3/\ud800\udece, \ud800\udea6, and \ud800\udec3/\ud800\udec9 depending on the location.

The dative case is assumed to be present also, based on its relatives and the frequency of dedicatory inscriptions, but its form is quite unclear. Related Anatolian languages also distinguish between animate and inanimate noun genders. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! ! colspan=\"2\" |Animate ! colspan=\"2\" |Inanimate |- !Case !Singular !Plural !Singular !Plural |- |Nominative | -\u2205 |-\u0161 (?) | -n(?), -\u2205 |? |- |Accusative |-n |-\u0161 | -n(?) |? |- |Genitive | -\u015b, -s (?) | rowspan=\"2\" |-\u03c4 (?) |? |? |- |Dative | -\u2205, -e, -i, -s (?) |? |? |- |Locative(?) | colspan=\"4\" |-\u03b4 |} Features that help identify the language as Anatolian include the asigmatic nominative (without the Indo- European nominative ending *-s) but -s for a genitive ending: \ud800\udebf\ud800\udeb8\ud800\udeab\ud800\udea6 w\u015bo\u03bb, \ud800\udebf\ud800\udeb8\ud800\udeab\ud800\udea6\ud800\udeb0 w\u015bo\u03bb-s.. The similarity of the basic vocabulary to other Anatolian languages also confirms this e.g. \ud800\udead\ud800\udeba\ud800\udea2 ted \"father\"; \ud800\udeba\ud800\udeb5 en \"mother\". A variety of dative singular endings have been proposed, including zero-marked and -i/-e suffixation. No inanimate stem has been securely identified but the suffix -n may be reconstructed based on the inherited pattern. Alternatively, a zero ending may be derived from the historical *-od. The locative case is attested in one phrase (\ud800\udea0\ud800\udea3\ud800\udeab\ud800\udeb0\ud800\udebe \ud800\udeb4\ud800\udea0\ud800\udea5\ud800\udeb5\ud800\udeab\ud800\udeb0\ud800\udebe alos\u03b4 k\u0302arnos\u03b4 \"in/from Halicarnassus(?)\"), perhaps originally a clitic derived from the preverb \u03b4 \"in, into\" < PIE *endo. ==Examples== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Carian glosses attested in Stephanus of ByzantiumI.J.

After the fall of the latter the region became the target of heavy immigration by Ionian and Dorian Greeks who enhanced Greek settlements and founded or refounded major cities. They assumed for purposes of collaboration new regional names based on their previous locations: Ionia, Doris. The writers born in these new cities reported that the people among whom they had settled were called Carians and spoke a language that was \"barbarian\", \"barbaric\" or \"barbarian-sounding.\" No clue has survived from these writings as to what exactly the Greeks might mean by \"barbarian.\" The reportedly Carian names of the Carian cities did not and do not appear to be Greek. Such names as Andanus, Myndus, Bybassia, Larymna, Chysaoris, Alabanda, Plarasa and Iassus were puzzling to the Greeks, some of whom attempted to give etymologies in words they said were Carian. For the most part they still remain a mystery. Writing disappeared in the Greek Dark Ages but no earlier Carian writing has survived. When inscriptions, some bilingual, began to appear in the 7th century BCE it was already some hundreds of years after the city-naming phase. The earlier Carian may not have been exactly the same. The local development of Carian excludes some other theories as well: it was not widespread in the Aegean, is not related to Etruscan, was not written in any ancient Aegean scripts, and was not a substrate Aegean language. Its occurrence in various places of Classical Greece is due only to the travel habits of Carians, who apparently became co-travellers of the Ionians. The Carian cemetery of Delos probably represents the pirates mentioned in classical texts. The Carians who fought for Troy (if they did) were not classical Carians any more than the Greeks there were classical Greeks. Being penetrated by larger numbers of Greeks and under the domination from time to time of the Ionian League, Caria eventually Hellenized and Carian became a dead language. The interludes under the Persian Empire perhaps served only to delay the process. Hellenization would lead to the extinction of the Carian language in the 1st century BCE or early in the Common Era. ==See also== *Carian alphabets ==References== ==Sources== * Adiego, Ignacio-Javier.
