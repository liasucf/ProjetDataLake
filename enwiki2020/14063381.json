    "text": "Municipal elections were held in France on 11 and 18 June 1995, more or less than one month after Jacques Chirac's election. The far-right National Front elected 3 mayors in Provence: Toulon, Orange, Marignane. It was the first time the far-right led an executive alone. In other races, Jean Tiberi (RPR) succeeded Jacques Chirac as Mayor of Paris. In Marseille, the UDF-Republican Jean-Claude Gaudin succeeded the socialist Gaston Defferre. In Lyon, former UDF Prime Minister Raymond Barre succeeded to another right-wing incumbent mayor. ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\" |- !colspan=2|Party/Alliance !% (first round) !Seats |- |bgcolor=\"#0000C8\"| |RPR-UDF |53.80 |312,678 |- |bgcolor=\"#E75480\"| |PS-PCF-MDC-MRG |40.10 |191,555 |- |bgcolor=\"#704214\"| |FN |3.90 |1,249 |- |bgcolor=\"#00c000\"| |Les Verts-Other ecologists |1.03 |1,779 |- |bgcolor=\"#C41E3A\"| |Far-Left |0.74 |642 |- |bgcolor=\"gray\"| |Miscellaneous |0.29 |291 |- |bgcolor=\"#dddd00\"| |Regionalists |0.10 |424 |- |bgcolor=\"#80461B\"| |Far-Right |0.04 |114 |} ==Sources== *Locals 1995 1995 Category:1995 elections in France ",
