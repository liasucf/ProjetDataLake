    "text": "Sta\u0144czyk by Jan Matejko The jester is depicted as the only person at a royal ball who is troubled by the news that the Muscovites have captured Smolensk. This event happened in 1514. Sta\u0144czyk (c. 1480-1560) () was a Polish court jester, the most famous in Polish history. He was employed by three Polish kings: Alexander, Sigismund the Old and Sigismund Augustus. ==Name, identity and historicity== Scarcity of sources gave rise to four distinct hypotheses in the 19th century: that he was entirely invented by Jan Kochanowski and his colleagues; or that he was \"perhaps a typical jester dressed by his contemporaries in an Aesopian attire; or perhaps a Shakespearean vision of 19th century writers; or perhaps indeed a grey eminence of the societatis ioculatorum\". In any measure, common consensus among modern scholars is that such a person indeed existed and even if he did not, he had a tremendous importance to Polish culture of later centuries, appearing in works of many artists of the 19th and 20th centuries. Almost nothing is known about Sta\u0144czyk's life and even his name and identity are a matter of dispute. Contemporary sources mention court jesters named G\u0105ska and Sta\u0144czyk. Notably, both names are featured in two short poems by Jan Kochanowski. Both words are diminutives, of the words g\u0119\u015b (goose) and Stanis\u0142aw, respectively, rather than proper names in their own right. All of the above led Aleksander Br\u00fcckner and later scholars to believe that G\u0105ska and Sta\u0144czyk are merely two nicknames of the same person. Because of that hypothesis Sta\u0144czyk is sometimes referred to as Stanis\u0142aw G\u0105ska, a name that resembles a typical Polish name, except it is of much later provenance and was coined in late 19th century rather than during the jester's times.The etymologic analysis of Sta\u0144czyk's name is provided in: By any measure Sta\u0144czyk's fame and legend were already strong during his own time, the Renaissance. The popularity later reappeared in 19th century and remained well-known to present times. Unlike jesters of other European courts, Sta\u0144czyk has been always considered to have been much more than a mere entertainer.The difference between Polish and foreign traditions in this context is discussed in: He is remembered as a man of great intelligence and a political philosopher gifted with formidable insight into Poland's current and future situation. He used his job to criticize and warn his contemporaries by the use of satire. His witty jokes often pertained to current political or court matters. Sta\u0144czyk's remarks and jokes were preserved by numerous contemporary writers and historians, including \u0141ukasz G\u00f3rnicki, Jan Kochanowski, Marcin Kromer, and Miko\u0142aj Rej who praised him for fighting hypocrisy in the name of truth. Some sources even go as far as to call him a \"personal friend to Marcin Kromer, to the dislike of the bishops\". The best known anecdote about Sta\u0144czyk is that of a hunting incident. In 1533 King Sigismund the Old had a huge bear brought for him from Lithuania. The bear was released in the forest of Niepo\u0142omice near Krak\u00f3w so that the king could hunt it. During the hunt, the animal charged at the king, the queen and their courtiers which caused panic and mayhem. Queen Bona fell from her horse which resulted in her miscarriage. Later, the king criticized Sta\u0144czyk for having run away instead of attacking the bear. The jester is said to have replied that \"it is a greater folly to let out a bear that was already in a cage\". This remark is often interpreted as an allusion to the king's policy toward Prussia which was defeated by Poland but not fully incorporated into the Crown. == Sta\u0144czyk as a symbol == Gamrat and Sta\u0144czyk, oil on wood, by Jan Matejko. Ko\u015bciuszko Foundation, New York Sta\u0144czyk became a popular historical figure in Polish literature after the partitions (1795). Some writers treated him as a symbol of Poland's struggle for independence, others provided him with rather Shakespearean traits. He appears in a work of, among others, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz (in Jan z T\u0119czna. Powie\u015b\u0107 historyczna, 1825) and several works by J\u00f3zef Ignacy Kraszewski (1839, 1841). === Teka Sta\u0144czyka === The Prussian Homage (detail). Oil on canvas, by Jan Matejko, National Museum in Krak\u00f3w In 1869 a group of young conservative publicists: J\u00f3zef Szujski, Stanis\u0142aw Tarnowski, and , published a series of satirical pamphlets entitled (Sta\u0144czyk's Portfolio). Only five years after the tragic end of the January Uprising, the pamphlets ridiculed the idea of armed national uprisings and suggested a compromise with Poland's enemies, especially the Austrian Empire, and more concentration on economic growth than on political independence. The political faction which adopted these ideas became known as \"Sta\u0144czycy\" (plural of \"Sta\u0144czyk\"). === Sta\u0144czyk in the arts === Sta\u0144czyk was also one of Jan Matejko's favorite historical figures and he appears in a number of his paintings, such as in the Prussian Homage. Matejko, giving the jester his own facial features, created the popular image of Sta\u0144czyk that is familiar to most modern Poles. The painter always depicted Sta\u0144czyk with a very concerned and reflective look on his face, in stark contrast to his cap and bells and other jester's gear. Matejko's vision of Sta\u0144czyk influenced the way other artists, such as Leon Wycz\u00f3\u0142kowski, later depicted the jester. The most notable appearance of Sta\u0144czyk in literature is in Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski's play Wesele (The Wedding) where the jester's ghost visits the Journalist, a character modeled after , editor of the Krak\u00f3w-based paper Czas (Time), associated with the Sta\u0144czycy faction. In the play, Sta\u0144czyk accuses the Journalist, who calls the jester a \"great man\", of inactivity and passive acceptance of the nation's fate. At the end of their conversation, Sta\u0144czyk gives the Journalist his \"caduceus\" (the jester's marotte) and tells him to \"stir the nation\" but not to \"tarnish the sacred things, for sacred they must remain\". Thus Wyspia\u0144ski reinforced Sta\u0144czyk's role as a symbol of patriotism and skeptical political wisdom. ==References== == Further reading == * * ==External links== * Sta\u0144czyk, WIEM Encyklopedia * Andrzej Solarz, Sta\u0144czyk, Internetowy Kurier Proszowicki - SERWIS Ziemi Proszowickiej * Liliana Sonik, \"Sta\u0144czyk na dworze kr\u00f3lowej Bony wobec straconego Smole\u0144ska\", Dziennik Polski, 26.04.2010 Category:1480s births Category:1560 deaths Category:Jesters Category:Polish comedians Category:15th- century Polish people Category:16th-century Polish people ",
