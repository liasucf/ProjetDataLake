It belongs to Zell im Wiesental in the Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg county of L\u00f6rrach. The mountain, with its steep slopes to the south, west and east, dominates the Wiese valley north of the town of Zell and towers above it by more than 600 metres. To the north a ridge runs from the forested summit region of the Zeller Blauen, between the Kleines Wiesental in the west and the Wiesental in the east, to the Belchen 10 kilometres away. Along the southern flank of the Zeller Blauen are the remains of military earthworks.cf. BFN-Kartendienst, retrieved 19 July 2013 On the west mountainside, at an elevation of about 700 to 800 metres in the parish of Adelsberg, are the hamlets of Blauen and Oberblauen.
