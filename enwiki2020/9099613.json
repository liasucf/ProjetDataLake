    "text": "Gregor Bala\u017eic (born 12 February 1988) is a Slovenian professional footballer who plays for Cypriot club Enosis Neon Paralimni FC as a central defender. In his country, he played for Mura and Gorica. He had spells abroad in Spain, Ukraine, Serbia, Russia and Cyprus, notably having a five-year spell with Karpaty Lviv in the Ukrainian Premier League and winning the 2014\u201315 Serbian SuperLiga with Partizan. Bala\u017eic represented Slovenia at all youth levels, and made his senior debut in 2013. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Born in Murska Sobota, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Bala\u017eic came through the youth academy of NK Mura, who went defunct in 2004. He made his first-team debut in a 2\u20131 home league win against NK Zagorje on 30 April 2005, aged 17, during the club's last competitive season. In the summer of 2005, Bala\u017eic was transferred to S.L. Benfica of Portugal. Until his departure two years later, he played exclusively for their youth sides. ===Spain=== In June 2007, Bala\u017eic moved to Spain and signed with RCD Espanyol, being initially registered for the reserves. However, two months later, he left for \u00c1guilas CF also in the country's Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. Bala\u017eic suffered a knee injury early into the campaign, which resulted in the termination of his contract in December 2007. ===Gorica=== In the winter transfer window of 2008, Bala\u017eic returned to his country and signed for ND Gorica from the Slovenian PrvaLiga. He scored his first goal as a senior on 5 December 2009, helping to a 1\u20131 home draw against NK Olimpija Ljubljana. Bala\u017eic contributed with 29 games in 2009\u201310, helping his team finish in third position and qualify to the UEFA Europa League. ===Karpaty Lviv=== In January 2011, Bala\u017eic signed with FC Karpaty Lviv in the Ukrainian Premier League, penning a four-year deal for \u20ac400.000 in what was the club's most expensive transfer ever. On 6 March he made his competitive debut, netting in a 2\u20132 draw at FC Arsenal-Kyiv. In the first round of 2014\u201315, Bala\u017eic scored in a 2\u20132 away draw to FC Hoverla Uzhhorod. He scored a career-best four goals during that season, in only 13 matches. ===Partizan=== On 4 February 2015, Bala\u017eic signed a two-year contract with FK Partizan. On 28 February he made his first appearance, featuring the full 90 minutes in a 0\u20130 home draw against FK Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161. On 25 April 2015, during the Eternal derby against Red Star Belgrade, Bala\u017eic was fouled in the area by Vuka\u0161in Jovanovi\u0107 in what should have been a penalty for Partizan, but referee Milorad Ma\u017ei\u0107 did not concede it. A week later, against FK Vojvodina, this time it was Bala\u017eic who brought down an opponent but, again, nothing was awarded; later, he admitted he did commit the infraction. During his debut campaign, Bala\u017eic partnered compatriot Branko Ili\u0107 as central defender \u2013 after the departure of the latter in the summer, he started alongside Brazilian Fabr\u00edcio. He scored his first official goal for the team on 22 August 2015, helping to a 3\u20131 away victory over FK Borac \u010ca\u010dak. ===Ural=== On 30 December 2016, Bala\u017eic signed for two and a half years with Russian Premier League club FC Ural Yekaterinburg. On 7 June 2019, he left upon the expiration of his contract. ==International career== Bala\u017eic made his senior debut for Slovenia on 19 November 2013, in a 1\u20130 exhibition game win against Canada in Celje. His second cap came on 7 June of the following year in another friendly, a 0\u20132 loss to Argentina in La Plata. ==Style of play== Bala\u017eic is a quick and strong player, technically gifted and with passing ability. Oleg Kononov, his coach at Karpaty, described him as a \"very intelligent player\" with a \"great potential\". ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|Cup !colspan=2|Continental !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Mura |2004\u201305 |Slovenian PrvaLiga |1||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0 |- |\u00c1guilas |2007\u201308 |Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B |2||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0 |- |rowspan=5|Gorica |2007\u201308 |rowspan=4|Slovenian PrvaLiga |9||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||9||0 |- |2008\u201309 |18||0||3||0||2||0||23||0 |- |2009\u201310 |29||1||3||0||2||0||34||1 |- |2010\u201311 |16||1||3||0||2||0||21||1 |- !colspan=2|Total !72!!2!!9!!0!!6!!0!!87!!2 |- |rowspan=6|Karpaty Lviv |2010\u201311 |rowspan=5|Ukrainian Premier League |5||1||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||5||1 |- |2011\u201312 |19||0||4||0||2||0||25||0 |- |2012\u201313 |17||1||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||19||1 |- |2013\u201314 |25||1||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||27||1 |- |2014\u201315 |13||4||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||15||4 |- !colspan=2|Total !79!!7!!10!!0!!2!!0!!91!!7 |- |rowspan=4|Partizan |2014\u201315 |rowspan=3|Serbian SuperLiga |13||0||3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||16||0 |- |2015\u201316 |10||1||1||0||9||0||20||1 |- |2016\u201317 |15||0||0||0||0||0||15||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !38!!1!!4!!0!!9!!0!!51!!1 |- |rowspan=3|Ural |2016\u201317 |rowspan=2|Russian Premier League |11||0||3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||14||0 |- |2017\u201318 |20||2||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||20||2 |- !colspan=2|Total !31!!2!!3!!0!!0!!0!!34!!2 |- !colspan=3|Career total !223!!12!!26!!0!!17!!0!!266!!12 |- |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! colspan=3 | Slovenia |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2013||1||0 |- |2014||1||0 |- !Total||2||0 |} ==Honours== Partizan *Serbian SuperLiga: 2014\u201315 *Serbian Cup: 2015\u201316 ==References== ==External links== *PrvaLiga profile * * *National team data * * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:People from Murska Sobota Category:Prekmurje Slovenes Category:Slovenian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Slovenian PrvaLiga players Category:NK Mura players Category:ND Gorica players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:RCD Espanyol B footballers Category:Ukrainian Premier League players Category:FC Karpaty Lviv players Category:Serbian SuperLiga players Category:FK Partizan players Category:Russian Premier League players Category:FC Ural Yekaterinburg players Category:Cypriot First Division players Category:Enosis Neon Paralimni FC players Category:Slovenia youth international footballers Category:Slovenia under-21 international footballers Category:Slovenia international footballers Category:Slovenian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Portugal Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in Ukraine Category:Expatriate footballers in Serbia Category:Expatriate footballers in Russia Category:Expatriate footballers in Cyprus Category:Slovenian expatriate sportspeople in Portugal Category:Slovenian expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Slovenian expatriate sportspeople in Ukraine Category:Slovenian expatriate sportspeople in Serbia Category:Slovenian expatriate sportspeople in Russia Category:Slovenian expatriate sportspeople in Cyprus ",
