It was founded by Philopemen Finos in 1942 during World War II. It was the biggest film production company in Greece at the time and one of the biggest, in terms of productivity, in southeast Europe. After 34 years, Finos Films returned to the Greek film scene with the Greek-Italian co-production 'Urania' (2006).
