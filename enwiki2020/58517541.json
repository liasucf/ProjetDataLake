Hamodia, \u00c9dition Internationale en Fran\u00e7ais. 15 December 2010.See Eliezer Shavit. Bernard Picard . 1925-1998. == History == In 1948, Chief Rabbi Jacob Kaplan, with the help of Suzanne Aron, created a Jewish lyc\u00e9e that he named \u00c9cole Yabn\u00e9, in memory of the Yeshiva founded in Yavne by Yohanan ben Zakkai after the destruction of the Second Temple of Jerusalem by the Romans in the 70s CE. He received help from Rabbi \u00c9lie Munk; Chief Rabbi Henri Schilli; and the communities of the Adas Yereim Synagogue (Rue Cadet), the Rue de Montevideo Synagogue, the Rue Pavee Synagogue, and Synagogue Rashi (Rue Ambroise-Thomas), all in Paris. To run the school, Suzanne Aron called upon Albert Cr\u00e9mieux. In 1948, the school was on the grounds of the Gustave de Rothschild Foundation,A former Rothschild school, occupied by the \u00c9cole Ma\u00efmonide at its start (1935-1938), later requisitioned during the Second World War, then used as a reception centre during the Liberation at 60 rue Claude-Bernard, in the Latin Quarter. There was not enough room in the small building to accommodate all the students. The solution was to teach half the students in the morning, and half in the afternoon. Some classes took place in the S\u00e9minaire isra\u00e9lite de France, a rabbinical seminary located at 9 rue Vauquelin. This situation continued until the construction, in the 1960s, of a multi-story building, in the same location, that was far more spacious and could accommodate all classes. This building was opened on 2 May 1965. The building included a gym and a refectory, amenities the school had for the first time. In 1976, in agreement with the centre, Rachi classes took place from the first year to the final year. \u00c9cole Yabn\u00e9 could then accommodate 750 students. In 1993, the school left the Latin Quarter for the Porte d'Italie. It is currently the largest Jewish college in France. It has more than 1000 students from kindergarten to the final year of high school. The primary school is called \u00c9cole Yabn\u00e9-Henri Schilli.See \u00c9cole Yabn\u00e9 Henri Schilli. == Lyc\u00e9e ranking == In 2015, the lyc\u00e9e ranked 47th out of 109 at the departmental level, in terms of teaching quality, and 452nd at the national level. The ranking is based on three criteria: the bac results, the proportion of students who obtain their baccalaur\u00e9at after two years at the establishment, and the added value (based on the social origin of students, their age, and their national diploma results). == Directors == * Albert Cr\u00e9mieux (historian)|Albert Cr\u00e9mieux, (1948-1954) * Rabbi Adrien Guttel,Adrien Guttel died 1965.
