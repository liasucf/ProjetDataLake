Born in , on June 4, 1707, he joined the Franciscan order and was ordained in 1731. He was despatched later that year to the San Antonio de Valero Mission in Texas, later known as the Alamo. At San Antonio, he helped to resolve disputes within the local Spanish community and brokered a peace with the Apache, who had been repeatedly attacking the mission. Santa Ana was an opponent of the enslavement of the Apache and believed that they could be peacefully induced to settle in the missions. In 1745, he personally convinced Viceroy Pedro Cebri\u00e1n y Agust\u00edn to rescind a decree permitting the employment of mission Indians by farms in San Antonio. Santa Ana fell ill in February 1750 and retired from the presidency of the missions. He died in March or April 1761. ==References== Category:1707 births Category:1761 deaths Category:Spanish Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Spanish Franciscans Category:18th-century Mexican people Category:People from San Antonio Category:People from O Ribeiro ",
