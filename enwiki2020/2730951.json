Written by Chris Barlas, the series was a light-hearted comedy drama centred on a teenage girl, Sandy Shelton (played by future Blue Peter and Most Haunted presenter Yvette Fielding), and her younger brother George (Aaron Brown) growing up living at her parents' guest house in Blackpool. Two series each consisting of six episodes were made between 1983 and 1985. The second series introduced a boyfriend for Sandy played by Mark Jordon who went on to star as PC Phil Bellamy in ITV's Heartbeat. ==External links== * Category:BBC television comedy ",
