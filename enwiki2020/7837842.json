    "text": "Laos is divided into 17 provinces (Lao: \u0ec1\u0e82\u0ea7\u0e87, khoueng) and 1 prefecture (kampheng nakhon), or capital city municipality (\u0e99\u0eb0\u0e84\u0ead\u0e99\u0eab\u0ea5\u0ea7\u0e87, nakhon luang). Furthermore, 1 so-called special administrative zone (\u0ec0\u0e82\u0e94\u0e9e\u0eb4\u0ec0\u0eaa\u0e94, khet phiset) existed between 1994 and 2006, when it was re-merged into its surrounding provinces (i.e. Vientiane and Xiangkhoang). The Xaisomboun special administrative zone was later recreated as the 17th province. Each province is subdivided into districts (Lao: \u0ec0\u0ea1\u0eb7\u0ead\u0e87, mueang) and then subdivided into villages (Lao: \u0e9a\u0ec9\u0eb2\u0e99, baan). == Districts of Laos == Districts of Laos :Note \u2014 Each district has a code in parentheses displaying the first two digits as the province and the last two as the district representing that province. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! \u2116 !
