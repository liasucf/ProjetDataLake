    "text": "Gerard Patrick Mannion (21 December 1939 \u2013 15 June 1994) was an English footballer, who played in the Football League for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Norwich City and Chester. ==Career== Mannion joined First Division Wolverhampton Wanderers as a youngster, signing professional forms in November 1957. He spent his early professional days in the reserves before finally making his senior debut in the 1958 Charity Shield where Wolves went down 4\u20131 at Bolton Wanderers. The 1959\u201360 season saw his strongest run of games in a Wolves shirt as he made 10 consecutive appearances in the final run-in. Despite scoring six times in this spell, the club lost out on a third successive league title by a single point to Burnley, denying them a domestic double. He was limited to just 21 appearances in total for the Molineux club, largely due to the presence of Norman Deeley on the wing. With playing opportunities limited, he moved to Norwich City in September 1961, for \u00a313,000. Mannion made 100 league appearances for the Canaries in six and a half years in the Second Division. He scored 17 league goals for the club and played in both legs of their 1962 League Cup triumph. The winger eventually left to join Chester in January 1968 but spent just five months there before dropping into the non-league with Kidderminster Harriers. He died on 15 June 1994, aged 54. == References == * Category:1939 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Footballers from Warrington Category:English footballers Category:English Football League players Category:England under-23 international footballers Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Chester City F.C. players Category:Kidderminster Harriers F.C. players Category:Association football wingers ",
