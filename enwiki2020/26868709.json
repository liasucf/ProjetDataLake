    "text": "The Polder tensor is a tensor introduced by Dirk PolderD. Polder, On the theory of ferromagnetic resonance, The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, 40, 1949 for the description of magnetic permeability of ferrites.G. G. Robbrecht, J. L. Verhaeghe, Measurements of the Permeability Tensor for Ferroxcube, Letters to Nature, Nature 182, 1080 (18 October 1958), The tensor notation needs to be used because ferrimagnetic materials become anisotropic in the presence of magnetizing field. The tensor is described mathematically as: ::B = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mu & j \\kappa & 0 \\\\\\ -j \\kappa & \\mu & 0 \\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\mu_0 \\end{bmatrix} H where: :\\mu = \\mu_0 \\left( 1+ \\frac{\\omega_0 \\omega_m}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2} \\right) :\\kappa = \\mu_0 \\frac{\\omega \\omega_m}{{\\omega_0}^2 - \\omega^2} :\\omega_0 = \\gamma \\mu_0 H_0 \\ :\\omega_m = \\gamma \\mu_0 M \\ and \\gamma = 17.6 \\cdot g \\ [kHz/(A/m)] is a gyromagnetic ratio and g is a factor between 1.9-2.4 depending on ferrite material. Magnetizing frequency (f) is expressed as \\omega = 2 \\pi f, H0 is a bias field, M is magnetization and \\mu_0 is magnetic permeability of free space. ==References== Category:Ferrites ",
