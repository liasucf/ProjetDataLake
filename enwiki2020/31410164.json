In the post-season O'Neill's continued his offensive pace in recording 10 goals and 20 points to help the Monarch's dominate the league and capture the Calder Cup in their final season within the AHL. Prior to the 2015\u201316 season, O'Neill attended the Kings training camp and participated in the pre-season.
