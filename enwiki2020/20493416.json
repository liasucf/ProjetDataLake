    "text": ", lit. \"a nonsense poem\" \u2013 a pejorative term for Zen poetry. It seems that this term was coined in connection with the Zen k\u014dan's that seemed like unintelligible riddles to ordinary people and other Buddhist schools. This term was used by conservative waka poets to refer to the innovative style of Fujiwara no Teika (1162\u20131241), the compiler of the Hyakunin Isshu and Shin Kokin Wakash\u016b, notwithstanding the fact that Teika himself had never been a Zen practitioner. Daruma uta is not the same as the shakky\u014dka, which stands for Japanese Buddhist poetry in a general sense. Category:Japanese_poetry ",
