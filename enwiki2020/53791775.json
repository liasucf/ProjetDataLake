It was the fourth leg of the 1999 UCI Road World Cup, held between Paris\u2013Roubaix and Amstel Gold Race. Belgian Frank Vandenbroucke won the race after a solo attack on the C\u00f4te de Saint-Nicolas. Dutchmen Michael Boogerd and Maarten den Bakker completed the podium. 71 of 191 riders finished the race. ==Race Summary== Frenchman Laurent Jalabert broke away from the peloton at from the finish but was caught later, before the C\u00f4te de La Redoute. On La Redoute, a duel unfolded between Frank Vandenbroucke and Michele Bartoli. Bartoli, seeking a third consecutive win and winner of La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne earlier in the week, attacked on the lower slopes of the climb, before being joined by Vandenbroucke. The two riders sprinted shoulder to shoulder for 10 seconds, before Vandenbroucke broke clear on the steep upper slopes and reached the top with ten seconds on Bartoli, Michael Boogerd and Maarten den Bakker. After the C\u00f4te de La Redoute, with three climbs remaining, a lead group of 17 riders was formed with all key contenders, apart from a worn-out Jalabert. Peter Farazijn did most of the work for his leader Vandenbroucke and countered attacks from Paolo Bettini and Davide Rebellin. On the C\u00f4te de Saint-Nicolas, from the finish, Michael Boogerd attacked early on the climb, but was countered by Vandenbroucke who broke clear and powered on solo to the finish in Ans. Vandenbroucke, who was second in the Tour of Flanders and seventh in Paris\u2013Roubaix in the weeks before, claimed his first and only career monument win. Boogerd finished second at 30 seconds. Michele Bartoli was distanced by Maarten den Bakker in the final kilometre and finished a disappointing fourth. ==Result== ==References== ==External links== * Official website 1999 Category:1999 in Belgian sport Liege-Bastogne-Liege Category:1999 in road cycling Category:April 1999 sports events in Europe ",
