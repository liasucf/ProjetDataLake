    "text": "In functional analysis, a topological vector space (TVS) is called ultrabornological if every bounded linear operator from into another TVS is necessarily continuous. A general version of the closed graph theorem holds for ultrabornological spaces. Ultrabornological spaces were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck (Grothendieck [1955, p. 17] \"espace du type (\u03b2)\"). == Definitions == Let be a topological vector space (TVS). === Preliminaries === :Definition: A disk is a convex and balanced set. :Definition: A linear map between two TVSs is called infrabounded if it maps Banach disks to bounded disks. :Definition: A disk in a TVS is called bornivorous if it absorbs every bounded subset of . A disk in a TVS is called infrabornivorous if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions: 1. absorbs every Banach disks in . while if locally convex then we may add to this list: 2. the guage of is an infrabounded map; while if locally convex and Hausdorff then we may add to this list: 3. absorbs all compact disks. * i.e. is \"compactivorious\". === Ultrabornological space === A TVS is ultrabornological if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions: 1. every infrabornivorous disk in is a neighborhood of the origin; while if is a locally convex space then we may add to this list: 2. every bounded linear operator from into a complete metrizable TVS is necessarily continuous; 3. every infrabornivorous disk is a neighborhood of 0; 4. be the inductive limit of the spaces as varies over all compact disks in ; 5. a seminorm on that is bounded on each Banach disk is necessarily continuous; 6. for every locally convex space and every linear map , if is bounded on each Banach disk then is continuous; 7. for every Banach space and every linear map , if is bounded on each Banach disk then is continuous. while if is a Hausdorff locally convex space then we may add to this list: 8. is an inductive limit of Banach spaces; == Properties == * Every locally convex ultrabornological space is barrelled. * Every ultrabornological space is the inductive limit of a family of nuclear Fr\u00e9chet spaces, spanning . * Every ultrabornological space is the inductive limit of a family of nuclear DF-spaces, spanning . * Every ultrabornological space is a quasi-ultrabarrelled space. * Every locally convex ultrabornological space is a bornological space but there exist bornological spaces that are not ultrabornological. == Examples and sufficient conditions == * Every Hausdorff sequentially complete bornological TVS is ultrabornological. * Thus every compete Hausdorff bornological space is ultrabornological. * In particular, every Fr\u00e9chet space is ultrabornological. * The finite product of locally convex ultrabornological spaces is ultrabornological. * Inductive limits of ultrabornological spaces are ultrabornological. * The strong dual space of a complete Schwartz space is ultrabornological. * Every Hausdorff bornological space that is quasi-complete is ultrabornological. === Counter-examples === * There exist ultrabarrelled spaces that are not ultrabornological. * There exist ultrabornological spaces that are not ultrabarrelled. == See also == * * * * * * * * * == External links == * Some characterizations of ultrabornological spaces == References == * * * * * * * * * Category:Topological vector spaces ",
