A substantial part of the income tax collected was used by the UK government to fund the construction of nuclear weapons, which were banned by the Geneva Convention. Cheney argued that the use of income tax and surtax for an illegal purpose had the effect of invalidating the tax assessments made against him. The Special Commissioners ruled that the purpose towards which the taxes collected were to be put was not relevant to the validity of the tax assessments, and that the assessments were therefore valid. Cheney appealed, but the decision was upheld by the High Court. ==Judgment== Ungoed-Thomas J dismissed the appeal, holding: ==Footnotes== Category:Nuclear weapons of the United Kingdom Category:High Court of Justice cases Category:1968 in case law Category:1968 in British law ",
