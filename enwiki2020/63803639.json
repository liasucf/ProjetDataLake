    "text": "In Chilean folklore the entierros (lit. \"burrowing\") are legendary treasures buried in different locations by different motives. The identity of the alleged burrowers vary from case to case, sometimes being indigenous peoples, pirates and privateers like Francis Drake or the Jesuits.Montencino 2015, p. 268\u2013273 A significant number to the entierro legends relate to the Spanish Conquest of Chile in the 16th century. Associated to this there is a significant folklore on how to unearth the entierros. In the far north of Chile a tale says that because Francis Drake feared falling prisoner to the Spanish he buried his treasure near Arica. Further south in Quintero is Cueva del Pirata (lit. \"Cave of the Pirate\") which is also associated with a treasure of Francis Drake.Montencino 2015, p. 196-197 Some people believe that a nocturnal bird called Alicanto can show to treasure hunters the location of entierros. ==See also== *Carbunclo *City of the Caesars *Cueva de los Pincheira *Robinson Crusoe Island ==References== ;Bibliography * Category:Chilean legends Category:Legendary treasures ",
