    "text": "Akhni () is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of the Sylhet region. It is often considered to be a particular variation of biryani or polao; hence the terms akhni birani and akhni fulaw are also common. The dish is especially popular throughout Bangladesh, as well as among the diaspora across the world. It is made by mixing rice with cooking oil, traditional spices (ginger, garlic, garam masala, tejpata, cumin, onion, salt), ghee, meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb), fruits and vegetables (carrots, potatoes, peas, plums), chili pepper and sour doi. Occasionally, nuts and eggs may also be added. The word 'akhni' is derived from the Arabic term, yakhni, which means stew. It is one of the most popular dishes, which has acquired a niche for itself in Sylheti cuisine. During Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting, the dish is popularly eaten at Iftar meals across Sylhet. ==See also== *List of rice dishes ==References== Category:Bangladeshi rice dishes Category:Bengali cuisine Category:Sylheti cuisine Category:Desi culture Category:Iftar foods ",
