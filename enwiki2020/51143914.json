    "text": "The Pakistan cricket team were scheduled to tour Bangladesh in July 2017 to play two Test matches, three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and a Twenty20 International (T20I) match. In March 2017, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) rejected an invitation by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to play two T20I matches in Pakistan ahead of this tour. In April 2017, the tour was cancelled. The PCB chairman Shahryar Khan said that Pakistan had already toured Bangladesh twice without them reciprocating as the main reason for the postponement. Shahryar went on to say they would \"explore another window in the next year or so\". The chairman of the BCB's media committee said he was \"really surprised\" at the decision. There was no official communication between the PCB and BCB, with the BCB hearing about the cancellation in the media. ==References== Category:2017 in Bangladeshi cricket Category:2017 in Pakistani cricket Category:International cricket competitions in 2017 Category:Pakistani cricket tours of Bangladesh ",
