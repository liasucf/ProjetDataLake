November 2015. == Concept == Designed by the Japanese motorcycle customizer Shinja Kimura and further developed by the Yamaha design team in Monza, Italy, the XSR700 is designed to enhance the classic lines of the Yamaha XS 650 from 1976 combined with the modern technology of Yamaha MT-07. Central technical assemblies of the MT-07 such as engine, frame, chassis and brake system remained unchanged in the XSR 700.

Juli 2015. == 270\u00b0 crankshaft == The XSR700's parallel-twin engine has a 270\u00b0 crankshaft, whose two cylinders in the engine fire at an irregular interval. This format helps to harmonize the inertia forces inside the engine, resulting in a more responsive and \"torquey\" sensation for the rider, a feeling not unlike that of a V-twin. == References == XSR700 Category:Motorcycles introduced in 2016 Category:Standard motorcycles ",
