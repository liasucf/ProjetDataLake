Jack pine and black spruce grow in open stands with a ground cover of lichens. The park is within the Churchill River Upland ecoregion of the Boreal Shield ecozone. Zed Lake greywacke is found to the east and the south of the lake. Its presence is an indication of an ancient ocean that existed approximately 1880 million years ago. ==See also== *List of protected areas of Manitoba *List of provincial parks in Manitoba ==References== ==External links== * Category:Provincial parks of Manitoba ",
