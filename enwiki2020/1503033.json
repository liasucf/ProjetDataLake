Guitarist Mike McCready stated, \"We were so blown away by the movie... Eddie and I were standing around talking about it afterwards and were teary-eyed. We were so emotionally charged and moved by the imagination and humanity that we felt because of the movie.\" ==Lyrics== The wistful song is a young man saying farewell to his father: \"The man of the hour has taken his final bow/Goodbye for now.\" According to Billboard magazine, the \"acoustic-tinged track is accented by wistful slide guitar work, with lyrics reflecting how the father/son bond can be rocked by what seem like insurmountable obstacles.\" According to Vedder at a June 1, 2006 concert in East Rutherford, New Jersey at Continental Airlines Arena, \"Come Back\" from the band's 2006 album, Pearl Jam, is set with the same young man from \"Man of the Hour\" talking to the departed two months later.Vedder, Eddie.

Heather Phares of Allmusic said, \"Though Burton's quirky, eerie aesthetic would normally be at odds with Pearl Jam's earnestness, the two work well together here, with the song touching on the film's warmth and adding a bit of earthiness to its daydreamy nature.\" Barry Walters of Rolling Stone said that \"the star is the film's end-titles' closer, Pearl Jam's \"Man of the Hour\", which captures the darkness of Big Fish's central Oedipal conflict.\"Walters, Barry.
