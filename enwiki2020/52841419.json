As a child, he showed an aptitude for painting, poetry and music and was uncertain which one to pursue. He eventually chose painting and began his studies in 1877, at the University of Applied Arts Vienna. His multiple talents made him a popular guest in local society. He was displeased with the stiffly formal training at the University, however, and in 1879, switched to the Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied with and August Eisenmenger. Once again, he found himself at odds with his teachers, who were too wedded to the Romantic style. He persevered until 1887, when he began travelling between Sankt P\u00f6lten, Melk and Wochein, where his cousin, Friederike, ran a hotel. Eventually, financial problems forced him to return to Vienna. The St\u00f6hr-Haus in Sankt P\u00f6lten In 1895, he organized a successful exhibition of works by the recently deceased Theodor von H\u00f6rmann, an early critic of the Academy. The following year, he became a member of the K\u00fcnstlerhaus Wien. There, he joined the circle of young artists known as \"Die Jungen\", centered around Gustav Klimt. In 1897, he and seventeen other artists left the K\u00fcnstlerhaus to form the Vienna Secession. Over the years, he was a regular contributor to Ver Sacrum, the group's official publication. ===Later career and the loss of his family=== In 1898, he married Friederike and opened a studio in Wochien. That same year, he designed the fa\u00e7ade for a house his brother Hermann (a doctor) was building in Sankt P\u00f6lten; now preserved as the St\u00f6hr-Haus. Later, he bought his own printing press to experiment with printing techniques. The 12th issue of Ver Sacrum was entirely his work. In 1902, he wrote the preface for the catalog accompanying the Secession's \"\". During this time, he was invited to become a guest member of the Hagenbund. Shortly after that exhibition, his beloved uncle, Ludwig, died and he went through a period of severe depression. In 1904, his mother became seriously ill and he returned to Sankt P\u00f6lten to help care for her. After she died, his father suffered through a long illness and died in 1909. Both events were followed by worsening episodes of depression, prompting him to seek relief in religion and philosophy. In 1915, Italy entered World War I, which placed Wochein within the war zone. His paintings, always rather melancholy, began to reflect his increasing despair; dealing largely with hopeless situations and death. In early 1917, he was taken to a hospital in Tulln an der Donau, but was released in a few weeks. Upon his release, he returned to Sankt P\u00f6lten, went to the family home, and hanged himself in the kitchen. == Selected works == File:Stohr-Eldery.jpg|An Elderly Couple at Home File:Stohr-Nude.jpg|Reclining Nude by a Window File:Stohr-Stroller.jpg|The Stroller File:Ernst St\u00f6hr, Vampir, 1899.png|Vampire, from Ver Sacrum == References == ==Further reading== * Gabriele B\u00f6sch: Die Kunst des inneren Sehens: Ernst St\u00f6hr \u2013 Leben und Werk; eine kunsthistorische Analyse, Dissertation, University of Marburg, 1994 * Josef Engelhart (Ed.): Ernst St\u00f6hr zum Ged\u00e4chtnis.
