She competed in women's singles at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, where she tied 9th. At the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, she competed in both women's singles and mixed doubles (with Conrad Langaard). ==Personal life== Dahl was born in Istanbul, the daughter of Silvie Pessi (1863\u20131939) and businessman Joachim Peter (died 1891). As her father died the year after her birth, the family eventually left Istanbul and Dahl grew up in Z\u00fcrich. In 1913 she married Knud Dahl, who graduated as engineer in Z\u00fcrich the same year. From 1915 to 1917 she lived with her husband in the United States, and thereafter in Oslo. She died in Oslo on 21 January 1979. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1890 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Istanbul Category:Norwegian female tennis players Category:Olympic tennis players of Norway Category:Tennis players at the 1920 Summer Olympics Category:Tennis players at the 1924 Summer Olympics ",
