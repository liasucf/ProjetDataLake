The president heads the executive branch. In addition the president has a right to dissolve parliament in certain cases, veto legislation and represents Poland in the international arena. ==History== The first president of Poland, Gabriel Narutowicz, was sworn in as president of the Second Polish Republic on 11 December 1922. He was elected by the National Assembly (the Sejm and the Senate) under the terms of the 1921 March Constitution. Narutowicz was assassinated on 16 December 1922. Previously J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski had been \"Chief of State\" (Naczelnik Pa\u0144stwa) under the provisional Small Constitution of 1919. In 1926 Pi\u0142sudski staged the \"May Coup\", overthrew President Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski and had the National Assembly elect a new one, Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki, thus establishing the \"Sanation regime\". Before Pi\u0142sudski's death, parliament passed a more authoritarian 1935 April Constitution of Poland (not in accord with the amendment procedures of the 1921 March Constitution)., which first appeared in Mo\u015bcicki continued as president until he resigned in 1939 in the aftermath of the German Invasion of Poland. Mo\u015bcicki and his government went into exile into Romania, where Mo\u015bcicki was interned. In Angers, France W\u0142adys\u0142aw Raczkiewicz, at the time the speaker of the Senate, assumed the presidency after Mo\u015bcicki's resignation on 29 September 1939. Following the fall of France, the president and the Polish government-in-exile were evacuated to London, United Kingdom. The transfer from Mo\u015bcicki to Raczkiewicz was in accordance with Article 24 of the 1935 April Constitution. Raczkiewicz was followed by a succession of presidents in exile, of whom the last one was Ryszard Kaczorowski. In 1944\u201345 Poland became a part of Soviet-controlled central-eastern Europe. Boles\u0142aw Bierut assumed the reins of government and in July 1945 was internationally recognized as the head of state. The Senate was abolished in 1946 by the Polish people's referendum. When the Sejm passed the Small Constitution of 1947, based in part on the 1921 March Constitution, Bierut was elected president by that body. He served until the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic of 1952 eliminated the office of the president. Following the 1989 amendments to the constitution which restored the presidency, Wojciech Jaruzelski, the existing head of state, took office. In Poland's first direct presidential election, Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa won and was sworn in on 22 December 1990.
