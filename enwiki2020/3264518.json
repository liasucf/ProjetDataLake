The name Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur literally means Weapon Fjord or Weapon Bay, and comes from the nickname of one of the settlers, Eyvindur vopni. Disputes between local chieftains led to a number of killings in the 10th century. The story of the disputes is told in Vopnfir\u00f0inga saga, one of the classic Sagas of Icelanders, a series of epic family histories written in the 13th century. Little is known about the history of Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur after Iceland lost its independence to Norway in 1264. Foreign merchants sailed to Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur in the early modern age, and it was one of three trade ports in East Iceland in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Danish trading company \u00d8rum & Wulff had extensive operations in Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur in the 19th century. A local cooperative, Kaupf\u00e9lag Vopnfir\u00f0inga, was established in 1918, and was one of Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur's largest employers throughout the 20th century, but filed for bankruptcy in 2004. In the late 19th century, poor farmers were forced to move into the mountains above Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, when they could no longer afford living on densely populated land in the lowlands. For several decades, many families lived in the highlands, experiencing extreme hardship. The highland farms inspired the setting of the novel Independent People by Halld\u00f3r Laxness. The book helped him win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955. Modern infrastructure, including roads, harbors and bridges, was first introduced in Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur in the early 20th century. Today, new infrastructure is of highest standards. ===Emigration to America=== Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur was the largest port of Icelandic emigration to America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Thousands of North Americans have ancestors who lived in Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur. ==Geography== The bay seen from the top of Krossav\u00edk Mountains. Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur is located in Northeast Iceland. The Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur area coastline is characterized by the Tangi peninsula, coastal rocks, islets, coves, river mouths, and black sand beaches. During the Ice Age (up to 10,000 years ago) a large glacier covered the bay. The Ice Age glacier carved the diverse mountains and rock formations that characterize the area. After the Ice Age, the land rose as the heavy load of the glacier fell away, and began to look as it does today. The largest river to run into the bay is Hofs\u00e1, one of the best salmon-fishing rivers in the country. Krossav\u00edk Mountains at , tower over the bay. The village of Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur is located on the Tangi peninsula in the middle of the bay. Surrounding farms reach far into Hofs\u00e1rdalur and Vestur\u00e1rdalur valleys, and to the northern coast of the bay. ==Climate== Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur has a rainy, mild winter subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfc) or a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) depending on the isotherm used, or , similar to the rest of coastal Iceland.Despite its extreme north Atlantic location, Vopnafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur is much warmer than most locations at a similar latitude. Temperatures very rarely drop below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) in the winter. This is because the Icelandic coastal weather in winter is moderated by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.
