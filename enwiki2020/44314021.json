    "text": "Gary Pethybridge (born 6 November 1950) is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s. ==Career== Gary Pethybridge was a Parramatta junior and was graded with the Parramatta Eels in 1970. By 1973 he had moved to St George Dragons and he had a wonderful season in his debut year at Saints which included one representative match for New South Wales in the same year. He helped steer the Dragons into the semi-finals in 1973 and a bright career looked certain, but he suffered a chronic neck injury caused by being kneed in the back in 1974 that derailed his career at St George and he virtually retired. He returned from injury three years later with the Penrith Panthers and he played three seasons with them between 1978-1980 and captained the club before retiring for good in 1981.Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players. 1995 () ==References== Category:1950 births Category:St. George Dragons players Category:Parramatta Eels players Category:Penrith Panthers players Category:New South Wales rugby league team players Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Living people Category:Rugby league centres Category:Rugby league players from Sydney ",
