    "text": "\"Cruel Summer\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, from her seventh studio album Lover (2019). Swift wrote the song with Jack Antonoff and St. Vincent, and produced it with Antonoff. As the second track on the album, it was recorded in 2018 at Electric Lady Studios, New York City. \"Cruel Summer\" is a breezy synth-pop, industrial pop and electropop song with swirling synths, robotic voice effects and distorted vocals. Lyrically, it describes Swift's intense and painful experience while falling for a summer romance. \"Cruel Summer\" received critical acclaim upon release, with praise towards the infectious melody and ethereal production, often being noted as an album highlight and one of Swift's best pop songs. Upon the release of Lover, \"Cruel Summer\" debuted and peaked at number 29 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming one of seven top-forty entries from the album. It peaked inside the top-ten in Singapore and Sweden, top-twenty in Malaysia and New Zealand, and the top-thirty in several other official charts worldwide. In their year-end best music lists, Billboard and Rolling Stone named the song as one of the top-ten best songs of 2019, with the latter naming it the third best song of Swift's career. ==Background== The song was first teased as one of the easter eggs in the music video for \"You Need to Calm Down\", the second single from Lover. In the star-studded video, Adam Lambert appears to be giving Ellen DeGeneres a tattoo on her arms; the tattoo reads \"Cruel Summer\". Fans surmised that it could be the title of a track on Lover. Termed by Swift as a song about a \"summer romance\", \"Cruel Summer\" sees Swift describing an uncertain romantic relationship, with elements of pain and desperation in it. It portrays the challenges faced by pop stars in the public spotlight. The vulnerability of the song's lyrics has drawn comparisons to \"Delicate\", the fifth track on Swift's 2017 album Reputation, while the song's Americana theme has been compared to that of \"Getaway Car\", the ninth Reputation track. In the audio recordings from Lover Secret Sessions, a series of album-listening parties hosted by Swift, she explained that: Billboard's Heran Mamo opined that the song's lyrics see Swift \"wrestling with strong feelings\", where they paint \"the picture of an emotional night out\". Justin Styles of The Ringer wrote that the song tells a \"more humanizing version\" of Swift's \"ill-fated period three years ago\", adding that Swift sings about \"falling in love with current boyfriend Joe Alwyn while her public life was in shambles\". Anna Gaca, writing for Pitchfork, called the song a \"drama-free delight\" with \"magnetic pink glow\". Marcus Jones, writing for Entertainment Weekly, commented that the song's title could be a reference to the compilation album of the same name by GOOD music, a record label owned by American rapper Kanye West. The Spinoff pointed out that Swift's vocals in \"Cruel Summer\" are \"most notable for the modern country cadence\". ==Composition== Alongside Swift and frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff, \"Cruel Summer\" also features writing credits from American singer-songwriter Annie Clark, professionally known as St. Vincent (pictured). Clark also contributed guitar instrumentals to the song's production. \"Cruel Summer\" has been described as a dreamy, melancholy synth- pop, industrial pop and electropop song with a \"ranting\" bridge, driven by a pulsating, throbbing \"synth-swirl\", robotic voice effects, distorted vocals and a hook that consists of a long, high, fluctuating \"ooooh\". The song has a fast tempo of 170 beats per minute with a time signature of . It is played in the key of A major and follows a chord progression of A-Cm-Fm-D. \"Cruel Summer\" was written by Swift, Jack Antonoff and St. Vincent, with a \"burbling\" production from Swift and Antonoff; St. Vincent also took part in the production of the song by playing the guitar. Ravens and Chimes/Bleachers member, Michael Riddleberger, plays drums on the track. == Critical reception == Upon release, \"Cruel Summer\" was acclaimed by critics, with compliments towards the song's \"ethereal\" and \"infectious\" production. In his \"critic's pick\" review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commended the song for its \"thick, ethereal\" pop production and praised Swift's signature vocal motifs such as the \"question-mark syllables\" and the \"hard-felt smears\". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times proclaimed \"Cruel Summer\" to be the best song off of Lover, stating \"Agony and ecstasy as only Swift at her best can render them: 'It\u2019s new, the shape of your body / It\u2019s blue, the feeling I\u2019ve got,' she sings in a razor-sharp, industrial-pop banger about finding love in a hopeless place. The part of the bridge where Swift shrieks about the devil might be the punkest thing you\u2019ll hear all year\". Alex Abad-Santos, writing for Vox, listed \"Cruel Summer\" as one of his top-three best Lover tracks, writing that the song is an \"aquatic robot bop\" featuring \"wobbly\" synths. The Spinoff stated that Swift \"absolutely pulls it off\", comparing it to the Bananarama's 1984 hit of the same name. Writing for The Ringer, Justin Sayles praised the song as a \"better rebuke of her personal drama than anything on her last album [Reputation]\", and added that Swift \"shakes off the bad vibes\" with \"Cruel Summer\"; Sayles named it Swift's \"most infectious song since that run of singles from 1989\", and opined that song \"sets the tone\" for the \"warmer, more inviting vibes\" of Lover. Also calling it \"infectious\", Nick Levine of NME termed the track as a \"brilliant pop song\". Natalia Barr, writing for Consequence of Sound, highlighted Swift's vocal delivery in the song's bridge (\"He looks up, grinning like a devil\"), calling it \"simultaneously funny, agonizing, and thrilling, and needs to be created into a viral YouTube loop immediately\". Barr further labeled \"Cruel Summer\" as one of the \"most perfect\" pop songs of 2019. === Listicles === In 2019, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone ranked \"Cruel Summer\" as Swift's third best song in her discography.
