Played on the Grizzly Course, this was the 32nd edition of the LPGA Championship. Entering the final round four strokes behind, Pat Bradley birdied the last hole for a 68 to win by a stroke over runner-up Patty Sheehan. It was the fifth of her six major championships, the second of three in 1986, and completed the career grand slam. With the win, Bradley became the first to surpass $2 million in earnings on the LPGA Tour.
