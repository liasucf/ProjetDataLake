    "text": "Queen Rock Montreal is a live album by the British rock band Queen. It was released on 29 October 2007 as a double CD, Blu-ray, DVD, and triple vinyl. It was recorded in Montreal, Quebec, at the Montreal Forum on 24 November and 25 November 1981, exactly ten years before lead singer Freddie Mercury died of AIDS. Allmusic described Queen's performance as being \"deliberately theatrical and often majestic\". This marks the first official release of the film soundtrack to the concert film We Will Rock You on an audio-only format. Unlike the original video release of We Will Rock You, which has been re- released as Queen Rock Montreal, the album and CD features the full show (including \"Flash\" and \"The Hero\") fully remixed.Queen Rock Montreal Ultimate Queen.
