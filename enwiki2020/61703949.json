    "text": "Get Back Home in the U.S.A.is an album by blues musician John Lee Hooker that was recorded in France in 1969 and originally released by the French Black & Blue label. The album was reissued with 6 additional tracks in 1988 as Get Back Home. ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer Ron Wynn stated: \"John Lee Hooker's greatness lies in his ability to perform the same songs the same way yet somehow sound different and memorable in the process. He operates at maximum efficiency in minimal surroundings with little production or assistance. That was the case on a 1969 session for Black and Blue; it was just Hooker and his guitar moaning, wailing, and narrating... If you have ever heard any Hooker, you will not be surprised or stunned by these renditions; you will simply enjoy hearing him rework them one more time, finding a new word, phrase, line, or riff to inject\". ==Track listing== All compositions credited to John Lee Hooker except where noted # \"Get Back Home in the U.S.A.\" \u2013 3:30 # \"T.B.
