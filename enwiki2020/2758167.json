She played for the North American WNBA's Seattle Storm and Phoenix Mercury. She represented Czechoslovakia at the 1992 Summer Olympics.Olympic results ==WNBA career== The Storm made her the first draft choice of the franchise, a move that caused Vodi\u010dkov\u00e1 some initial concern. However, after being quickly embraced by the Seattle fans, the redubbed \"Vodka\" became the centerpiece of the offense, with Edna Campbell as the outside threat. The team did not improve from its initial poor showings until Vodi\u010dkov\u00e1 got a running mate inside, Australian Lauren Jackson. In the 2004 season, Vodi\u010dkov\u00e1 was faced with a tough choice, as her home country's Olympic team demanded that she skip the WNBA season if she wanted to play in the 2004 Summer Olympics. Vodi\u010dkov\u00e1 refused to go home, and the decision proved prescient, as the Storm ran to a championship that year. The salary- capped Storm lost three of its marquee players after the championship, with Vodi\u010dkov\u00e1 going to the Phoenix Mercury. Despite strong play from Vodi\u010dkov\u00e1, Penny Taylor, Anna DeForge, Maria Stepanova, and Diana Taurasi, the Mercury missed the playoffs in 2005. After the Mercury narrowly missed the playoffs again in 2006, announced she was expecting a child and will be on maternity leave during the entire 2007 WNBA season. ==International career== Vodi\u010dkov\u00e1 has been known to be a dominant player in the Czech circuit. In 2005, she played for the Dynamo in the Russian super league. ==Vital statistics== *Position: Forward/Center *Height: 6 ft. 4 in. / 1.93 m *College: Czech Republic *Team(s):Phoenix Mercury, Seattle Storm (WNBA); Dynamo (EuroLeague) ==References== Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Basketball players at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Czech expatriate basketball people in the United States Category:Czechoslovak women's basketball players Category:Czech women's basketball players Category:Olympic basketball players of Czechoslovakia Category:People from Litom\u011b\u0159ice Category:Phoenix Mercury players Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Seattle Storm draft picks Category:Seattle Storm players ",
