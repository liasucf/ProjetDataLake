She has completed all course work for a Master of Public Administration from Fairleigh Dickinson University. ===Run for State Senate=== Weinberg ran for the New Jersey Senate after fellow District 37 legislator Byron Baer resigned from the Senate on September 8, 2005. From the outset of his term, the resignation of the often-ailing Baer had been the subject of much speculation and maneuvering. In a January 7, 2004 article for PoliticsNJ.com, political reporter Steve Kornacki wrote, \"Depending on whom you listen to, the 74-year- old Baer will step down sometime between the next few months and January 2008, when his term expires.\" Kornacki identified a number of \"potential successors\" to Baer, including Hackensack Police Chief and former Assemblyman Charles \"Ken\" Zisa, who had briefly mounted a challenge to Baer's 2003 re-nomination before withdrawing it in what some have said was a deal brokered by Bergen County Democratic Organization Chairman Joe Ferriero; Bergen County Freeholder Valerie Huttle; Englewood Mayor Michael Wildes; and Weinberg. \"But,\" wrote Kornacki, \"whether Weinberg, who backed Zisa in his brief bid to topple Baer last year, does want it [the Senate seat] is an open question.\" Sixteen months later, that question appeared to have been answered. In a May 3, 2005 PoliticsNJ.com article, Kornacki reported, \"Weinberg essentially admitted to striking a deal with Ferriero. She said the chairman agreed to back her for [Assembly] majority leader, while she pledged to support a candidate of his choosing to replace state Senator Byron Barer when the 75-year-old steps down...some say she also had pledged support to Valerie Vainieri Huttle, a freeholder, for the Senate spot.\" Following Baer's resignation, Ferriero backed Zisa to fill the vacancy, as expected. Huttle prepared to challenge Zisa for the nomination. Weinberg then let it be known she was interested, and on September 11, 2005, United States Senator Jon Corzine, the Democratic candidate for Governor of New Jersey, endorsed Weinberg for Baer's seat. Huttle bowed out of the race and endorsed Weinberg. The Bergen County Democratic Organization caucused on September 15, 2005, to select a candidate. In balloting to replace Baer on an interim basis, Weinberg lost by a 114-110 margin to Zisa. In a separate vote, by a 112-111 margin, Zisa was selected over Weinberg to be the party's candidate on the November ballot. Though she congratulated Zisa in remarks made after results were announced at the September 15 caucus, Weinberg stated that inclusion of several uncounted ballots might change the results in her favor.Jones, Richard Lezin. \" After Democratic Squabble, Corzine Ally Loses Bid to Fill State Senate Seat\", The New York Times, September 16, 2005. Accessed April 1, 2008. Weinberg filed a legal challenge to the caucus results to have the unopened ballots included, which she believed were cast for her. On September 20, 2005, New Jersey Superior Court Judge Peter Doyne refused to interfere in what he held was a party matter and upheld the decision of the election mediator, Rep. Steve Rothman, to exclude the five ballots. On September 23, 2005, an Appellate Court panel sent the case back to Judge Doyne, ruling that he did have the authority to address a party issue and that the five uncounted ballots cast by Tenafly Democratic Committee members could be counted irrespective of the failure to file their names within the specified 30-day window. Zisa announced on September 26, 2005, that he would appeal the Appellate panel's decision to the New Jersey Supreme Court. Judge Doyne's hearing on September 28 to readdress the issues was underway when the Supreme Court issued a ruling upholding the Appellate Court's decision and affirming that the 30-day rule for submission of new County Committee members could not be enforced. Judge Doyne decided on October 3, 2005, in Weinberg's favor, ruling that ballots from the \"Tenafly Five\" should be counted.Fallon, Scott. \"Judge's ruling clears Weinberg's way to Senate\", The Record (Bergen County), October 4, 2005. Accessed April 1, 2008. On October 5, 2005, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that it would not hear an appeal from Ken Zisa and the Bergen County Democratic Organization. The \"Tenafly Five\" ballots were opened by Judge Peter Doyne, and each ballot was cast for Loretta Weinberg, thus giving her the slim margin of victory. Weinberg defeated Zisa by one vote in balloting to fill Baer's vacated seat on an interim basis, 115-114, and won the contest for the Democratic ballot spot in November, by a total of 116-112.Fallon, Scott. \"Opened ballots confirm Senate victory\", The Record (Bergen County), October 6, 2005. Accessed April 1, 2008. With Weinberg's victory, Bergen County Freeholder Valerie Huttle and Englewood Mayor Michael Wildes both announced their candidacy for Weinberg's Assembly seat. The choice was decided by yet another special convention of the Bergen County Democratic Committee on October 6, 2005, with Huttle outpolling Wildes 121-96.Fallon, Scott. Huttle gets Democrats' nod to run for Assembly in 37th -- Freeholder defeats Englewood mayor in party tussle\", The Record (Bergen County), October 7, 2005. Accessed April 1, 2008. \"Freeholder Valerie Huttle will succeed Loretta Weinberg as a Democratic Assembly candidate in the 37th District after defeating Englewood Mayor Michael Wildes in a county committee election Thursday night. Huttle won, 121-96, to be the party's nominee on the Nov. 8 ballot. She will fill the rest of the Assembly term after Weinberg resigns.\" On Election Day, November 8, 2005, Huttle won the Assembly seat. ===2007 primary challenge=== In 2007, Ferriero endorsed a ticket of Englewood Mayor Michael Wildes, and Cid Wilson and Ken Zisa for Assembly, to face off in a primary challenge against incumbents Weinberg, and her Assembly running mates Valerie Huttle and Gordon M. Johnson.Gohlke, Josh. \"June forecast: heated primaries; Intraparty squabbles promise lively races.\", The Record (Bergen County), April 10, 2007. In a deal brokered by Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine, Ferriero backed off the challenge and announced that he and the county party organization would endorse the three incumbents in the primary.Smothers, Ronald. \"Democrats Make Peace in Bergen County\", The New York Times, April 15, 2007. Accessed February 7, 2012. \"On Thursday, all three appeared together at a news conference as Mr. Ferriero announced that he and the county party would endorse Ms. Weinberg and her entire slate for re- election. As a result, Ms. Weinberg gets to run with Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle and Assemblyman Robert M. Gordon.\" ===Fort Lee lane closure scandal=== Weinberg played a major role in revealing the Fort Lee lane closure scandal. After reading about traffic jams in the Bergen Record, Weinberg began attending public meetings of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Weinberg convinced fellow state legislator John Wisniewski to take an interest in the case. Wisniewski would subpoena Port Authority officials, which eventually led to the lane closures becoming a major controversy. ===District 37=== Each of the forty districts in the New Jersey Legislature has one representative in the New Jersey Senate and two members in the New Jersey General Assembly. The other representatives from the 37th district for the 2018-2019 Legislative Session are: *Assemblywoman Valerie Huttle *Assemblyman Gordon M. Johnson ===Legislation=== Weinberg was a lead advocate of the 2002 New Jersey Childproof Handgun Law, which would restrict the sale of handguns in NJ to smart guns that \"can only be fired by an authorized or recognized user\" three years after the technology became generally available.Clift, Eleanor. \"The Jersey Politician Fighting to Make Guns Safer and Smarter; State Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg has been trying to get smart guns in the state for 15 years. With technology improving\u2014and Christie retiring\u2014it might actually happen.\", The Daily Beast, September 29, 2017. Accessed September 28, 2019. \"Weinberg was sold on the idea, and with help from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, she put together legislation, the Childproof Handgun Law of 2002. It said that once 'personalized handguns are available,' and the Attorney General in New Jersey certifies they meet the standard for any firearm, within three years, they would be the only kind of handgun one could buy in New Jersey.\" ==Bernard Madoff investment loss== Weinberg lost $1.3 million in a retirement fund that had been invested through a Beverly Hills, California financial planner with Bernard Madoff, without her knowledge. Other family members had also invested money with the same advisor. In an interview with The New York Times Weinberg stated that she did not expect to recoup her loss but she was \"determined not to make this the centerpiece of my life\", stating that she would \"have to budget myself very carefully over the next several years\".Mroz, jacqueline. \"In Madoff Case, Politicians Current and Former Feel the Loss\", The New York Times, January 16, 2009.

Weinberg engaged in a debate between herself and the other two major candidates for lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno and Frank Esposito, at Monmouth University on October 8.http://www.politickernj.com/wallye/32846/final-debate-schedule Corzine and Weinberg were defeated by Chris Christie on November 3, 2009. ==Election history== ==References== ==External links== *Senator Weinberg's legislative web page, New Jersey Legislature *New Jersey Legislature financial disclosure forms **2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 * |- |- |- Category:1935 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians Category:Fairleigh Dickinson University alumni Category:Living people Category:Majority Leaders of the New Jersey Senate Category:Members of the New Jersey General Assembly Category:New Jersey Democrats Category:New Jersey state senators Category:People associated with the Madoff investment scandal Category:People from Teaneck, New Jersey Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Women state legislators in New Jersey Category:Jewish American state legislators in New Jersey ",
