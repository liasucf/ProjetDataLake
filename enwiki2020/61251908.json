    "text": "Local Historic Landmark is a designation of the Cincinnati City Council for historic buildings and other sites in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. Many of these landmarks are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, providing federal tax support for preservation, and some are further designated National Historic Landmarks, providing additional federal oversight. == Criteria == The Cincinnati City Council's Historic Conservation Board decides a building's historic significance. The structure must have at least one of the following attributes, as stated in the Cincinnati Municipal Code:https://library.municode.com/oh/cincinnati/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIXIZOCOCI_CH1435HIPR_S1435-01DE Structures that would not be given landmark designations, as stated in the Cincinnati Municipal Code, include: == Application process == Historic districts, landmarks, and sites require filing of a designation application. This must be filed by the property owner or owner of a property in the area to be designated, or by the city council or its members, by the city council, city manager, city Urban Conservator, City Planning Commission, or by local perservation societies and community councils. After filing an application and during its nomination process, the site may not be demolished or evacuated. Within 60 days of receiving the designation application, the city's Urban Conservator prepares and sends a report and guidelines for conservation to the city council's Historic Conservation Board. For historic districts, the Urban Conservator also sends a proposed boundary map, a list of all included structures, and a list of non-contributing structures. The Historic Conservation Board schedules a public hearing to consider the landmark within 30 days of receiving the report and proposed guidelines. After the hearing, the board decides whether or not to recommend the designation, and forwards the decision and materials to the City Planning Commission. Within 30 days of the recommendation, the planning commission holds a public hearing to determine whether to follow the conservation board's recommendation. Afterward, the planning commission likewise forwards its decision and materials to the city council, which votes to ordain or overrule the planning commission's decision. If the planning commission approves of the designation, only a simple majority vote in the council is needed. However, if the planning commission does not approve of the designation, two-thirds of the council would need to vote in overruling the planning commission. == List of landmarks == For consistency, the list below uses the name from the City of Cincinnati website. === Individual landmarks === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! style=\"width:250px;\"| Local Historic Landmark ! style=\"width:100px;\"| Image ! style=\"width:300px;\"| Location ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Neighborhood ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Ordinance ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Designation date ! style=\"width:100px;\"| Construction date or period ! style=\"width:100px;\"| NRHP date ! style=\"width:100px;\"| NHL date |- |American Can Company |alt=American Can Company |4101 Spring Grove Ave. |Northside |0309-2007 | |1921 | |N/A |- |Baldwin Piano Building |alt=Baldwin Piano Building |655 Eden Park Dr. |Walnut Hills |0028-2015 | |1921 | |N/A |- |Benn Pitman House |alt=Benn Pitman House |1852 Columbia Pkwy. |East Walnut Hills |0202-1974 | | | |N/A |- |Brunswick Balke Collender Building |alt=Brunswick Balke Collender |130-132 E 6th St. |CBD/Downtown |0257-2016 | | | |N/A |- |Carthage Flagpole |alt=Carthage Flagpole |7011 Vine St. |Carthage |N/A |http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMDZQ5_Carthage_Flagpole_Cincinnatis_Smallest_Historic_Landmark | |N/A |N/A |- |Cincinnati Athletic Club Building |alt=Cincinnati Athletic Club |111 Shillito Pl. |CBD/Downtown |0248-1985 | | | |N/A |- |Cincinnati Bell Building |alt=Cincinnati Bell |209 W 7th St. |CBD/Downtown/West End |0452-1985 | | | |N/A |- |Cincinnati City Hall |alt=Cincinnati City Hall |801 Plum St. |CBD/Downtown |0199-1974 | | | |N/A |- |Cincinnati Union Terminal |alt=Cincinnati Union Terminal |1301 Western Ave. |Queensgate |0079-1974 | |1933 | | |- |Citadel Building |alt= |114-116 E 8th St. |CBD/Downtown |0452-1985 | | |N/A |N/A |- |Court Street Fire Station |alt= |315 W Court St. |CBD/Downtown |0452-1985 | | | |N/A |- |Covenant-First Presbyterian Church |alt= |717 Elm St. |CBD/Downtown |0249-1975 | | | |N/A |- |Cuvier Press Club |alt= |22 Garfield Pl. |CBD/Downtown |0216-1973 | | | |N/A |- |Doctor's Building |alt= |19 Garfield Pl. |CBD/Downtown |0452-1985 | | | |N/A |- |Duttenhofer Building |alt= |299 E 6th St. |CBD/Downtown |0021-2016 | | | |N/A |- |Farmers Hotel |alt= |4000 Colerain Ave. |Northside |0260-2013 | | |N/A |N/A |- |First National Bank Building |alt= |105 E Fourth St. |CBD/Downtown |0134-2016 | | | |N/A |- |George Pendleton House |alt= |559 Liberty Hill |Mount Auburn |0201-1974 | | | | |- |Harriet Beecher Stowe House |alt= |2950 Gilbert Ave. |Walnut Hills |0200-1974 | | | |N/A |- |Henry Probasco House |alt= |430 W Cliff Ln. |Clifton |0215-1973 | | | |N/A |- |Holy Cross Monastery |alt= |1055 St. Paul Pl. |Mount Adams |0443-1981 | | | |N/A |- |House of Adam |alt= |620-622 Vine St. |CBD/Downtown |0314-2016 | | |N/A |N/A |- |King Records |alt= |1540 Brewster Ave. |Evanston |0319-2015 | | |N/A |N/A |- |Kinsey Apartment Building |alt= |2415 Maplewood Rd. |Mount Auburn |0066-2013 | | |N/A |N/A |- |Kirby Road School |alt= |1710 Bruce Ave. |Northside |0044-2013 | | | |N/A |- |Krippendorf-Dittman Building |alt= |628 Sycamore St. |CBD/Downtown |0452-1985 | | | |N/A |- |Laurel Court |alt= |5870 Belmont Ave. |College Hill |0199-1979 | | | |N/A |- |Masonic Temple |alt= |3301 Price Ave. |East Price Hill |0257-2013 | | | |N/A |- |Moore-Knight House | |716 Mt.
