During the late eighties she was considered one of the best sprinters in the Netherlands. At the Dutch Championships, she won four gold medals: in the 500 meters in 1987 and 1988 and in the 1000 meters in 1988 and 1989. She participated as part of the Dutch team at the 1988 Olympic Winter Games in Calgary. She finished 15th in the 500 meters and 21st in the 1000 meters. At the World Sprint Championships in 1989 she finished fourth. She subsequently shifted her focus to cycling. ====Personal bests==== Haringa's personal bests are: *500 m \u2013 40.61 (1988) *1000 m \u2013 1:21.41 (1989) * 1500 m \u2013 2:10.56 (1987) * 3000 m \u2013 4:43.62 (1990) * 5000 m \u2013 8:21.8 (1983) ===Cycling=== In 1991 she made her debut at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Stuttgart.
