The album was reissued by on 2 June 2010 through LTM Recordings with two extra tracks. ==Critical reception== The album generally received positive reviews. AllMusic critic Ned Raggett thought that Mind Made Up \"found the group in creative health while approaching 30 years of work and beyond\". Raggett also wrote that the record \"feels more like them keeping on rather than trying to stake out a space in a crowded musical landscape.\" Martin Longley of BBC stated: \"These songs reinforce a formula, but it's ACR's very own formula, and one that still remains highly distinctive.\" Writing for Exclaim!, Michael Edwards described the release as \"another solid and funky album from A Certain Ratio\" and considered it as \" both a natural progression of the band's sound and a return to their roots.\" ==Track listing== # \"I Feel Light\" \u2013 3:20 # \"Down, Down, Down\" \u2013 4:29 # \"Everything Is Good\" \u2013 4:25 # \"Way to Escape\" \u2013 3:53 # \"Rialto 2006\" \u2013 3:58 # \"Mind Made Up\" \u2013 5:20 # \"Teri\" \u2013 3:45 # \"Bird to the Ground\" \u2013 3:42 # \"Starlight\" \u2013 5:19 # \"Which Is Reality?\" \u2013 3:38 # \"Skunk\" \u2013 2:27 # \"Very Busy Man\" \u2013 5:42 ==Personnel== Album personnel as adapted from album liner notes.A Certain Ratio \u2013 Mind Made Up liner notes * A Certain Ratio \u2013 performance, production * Colin Dunkerly \u2013 engineering * Gavin Kapps \u2013 assistant engineering * Ivan Gracia \u2013 assistant engineering * Paul O'Brien \u2013 mastering * Martin Moscrop \u2013 engineering ==References== ==External links== * Category:2008 albums Category:A Certain Ratio albums Category:2010 albums Category:Reissue albums ",
