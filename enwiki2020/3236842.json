    "text": "Kenne Duncan (February 17, 1903 - February 5, 1972) was a Canadian-born B-movie character actor. Hyped professionally as \"The Meanest Man in the Movies,\" the vast majority of his over 250 appearances on camera were Westerns, but he also did occasional forays into horror, crime drama, and science fiction. He also appeared in over a dozen serials. ==Early years== Duncan was born Kenneth Duncan MacLachlan in Ontario, Canada. Before he became an actor, Duncan enjoyed riding, and for a time he worked as a jockey. His accomplishments in that field included winning the steeplechase at Blue Bonnets raceway in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. == Career == Duncan is best known, in some circles, for his work with Ed Wood. Duncan appeared in five Wood productions: Night of the Ghouls, Trick Shooting with Kenne Duncan, Crossroad Avenger, The Sinister Urge, and The Lawless Rider, a film Wood did with Yakima Canutt in the Director's chair. Duncan's final appearances on screen were Wood's low-budget The Sinister Urge, and a bit part in an episode of Rawhide (\"Incident of the Sharpshooter\"). He also made television appearances, especially westerns, such as The Cisco Kid, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, and Tombstone Territory. He had a reputation for being a womanizer with his female co-stars, according to actress Valda Hansen. ==Death== On February 5, 1972, Duncan committed suicide by overdosing on barbiturates at the age of 68. He was buried at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. ==Selected filmography== * Police Reporter (1928) * A Man from Wyoming (1930) - Haley (uncredited) * Derelict (1930) - Radio Man (uncredited) * No Limit (1931) - Curly Andrews * Grief Street (1931) - Newspaper Reporter (uncredited) * Lovers Courageous (1932) - Cowboy (uncredited) * Probation (1932) - Wedding Rehearsal Attendant (uncredited) * The Mouthpiece (1932) - Office Worker (uncredited) * Shadow River (1933) * Undercover Men (1934) - Blake Hardy * Gallant Defender (1935) - Goose Neck Smith (uncredited) * From Nine to Nine (1936) - John Sommerset * Thoroughbred (1936) - Chick Williams * Cross My Heart (1937) - Steve King * Make-Up (1937) - Lorenzo * The Last Curtain (1937) - Garsatti * The Colorado Kid (1937) - Sims Leather * Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars (1938, Serial) - Airdrome Captain * The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok (1938, Serial) - Blacksmith (Ch.13) (uncredited) * Frontier Scout (1938) - Crandall - Henchman * The Spider's Web (1938, Serial) - Ram Singh * Fighting Thoroughbreds (1939) - Brady * North of the Yukon (1939) - Henchman Meeker * Buck Rogers (1939, Serial) - Lieutenant Lacy * The Man from Texas (1939) - Speed Dennison * Mickey the Kid (1939) - Henchman (uncredited) * Overland with Kit Carson (1939, Serial) - Trapper (uncredited) * The Fighting Renegade (1939) - Henchman (uncredited) * Trigger Fingers (1939) - Henchman Johnson * Flaming Lead (1939) - Larry - Ranch Hand * Westbound Stage (1939) - Capt.
