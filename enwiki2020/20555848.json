    "text": "Denon DL103 is a MC (moving coil) phono cartridge made by DENON company. The DL103 was designed for professional broadcast use in 1962 using the arms and turntables of the day. Production has continued uninterrupted since then. There are available different versions upgraded by other companies or individuals involved in DIY audio. ==Technical Specification== * Stylus: 16.5 \u03bcm diamond spherical tip * Cantilever: Aluminum * Frequency Response: 20 ~ 45 kHz * Output: 0.3 mV at 50 mm/s * Output Impedance: 40 \u03a9 * Load Impedance: 100 \u03a9 * Channel Separation: Over 25 dB at 1 kHz * Compliance: 5 x 10\u20136 cm/dyne (100 Hz) * Tracking Force: 2.3 ~ 2.7g (\u00b1 0.3g) * Weight: 8.5 grams Despite being designed in the 1960s it is still one of the masterpieces in audio technology and can easily compete with contemporary constructions. Due to its construction, Denon DL-103 is recommended as one of the very few cartridges suitable for heavy tonearms. (like in Lenco or Garrard turntables) As a low- output phono cartridge it requires either a step up transformer for a standard MM phono preamp, or phono preamp with built-in MC input. ==External links== * DENON DL-103 review * DENON DL-103 review on TNT Audio * DENON DL-103 review on Home Theater Review * DENON History (includes reference to the DENON DL-103 * High-End modification of a DENON DL-103 * Consumer reviews of the DENON DL-103 * Information, and photos, about the DENON DL-103 and its derivatives * DENON DL-103 Q&A; at Audio Asylum * VinylEnigine.com database entry for the Denon DL-103 * Tunable & customizable version of the DL-103 Category:Audio engineering ",
