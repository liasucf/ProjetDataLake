    "text": "\"Every Man Has a Woman Who Loves Him\" is a song by Yoko Ono from her Double Fantasy album with John Lennon. The version released as a single, and on the compilation album Every Man Has a Woman, is credited to Lennon, and has stripped away Ono's lead vocal, while bringing Lennon's backing vocal up in the mix (this version was also released as a bonus track on the CD reissue of Milk and Honey). The B-side featured \"It's Alright\" by Ono and Sean Lennon. The last Lennon song to be released as a single, it failed to chart in either the United Kingdom or the United States. In 2007, the song was re-released as a UK-only 12\" single on the Mynx record label where it was coupled with Elvis Costello's cover version of Yoko Ono's song \"Walking on Thin Ice\". == Personnel == This is the personnel according to the John Lennon Website. * John Lennon - vocals, guitar, keyboards * Tony Levin - bass guitar * Andy Newmark - drums * Earl Slick - guitar * Hugh McCracken - guitar * George Small - keyboards * Ed Walsh - oberheim * Arthur Jenkins - percussion ==Track listing== *;UK 7\" single :A1. \"Every Man Has a Woman Who Loves Him\" (by John Lennon) \u2013 3:32 :B1. \"It's Alright\" (by Sean Lennon) \u2013 2:26 ==Yoko Ono version== \"Every Man Has a Woman Who Loves Him\" was later released as a single by Yoko Ono in 2004 under the title \"Everyman...
