It also shows how life and time plays a significant role in the fate of the four couples who break social norms for the sake of love. == Cast == == Production == === Development === The idea of C/o Kancherapalem struck director Maha while he was visiting an old friend living in the neighbourhood of Kancharapalem. After interacting with the local people and closely observing their lifestyle, Maha decided to make an independent film about the locality and its people. Maha later happened to meet Praveena Paruchuri, an Indian American cardiologist who was looking to make a film in India. Maha showed Parachuri a pitch video of his story, for which she was instantly impressed and told him, \"This is made for Cannes.\" Parachuri offered to produce the film and paid Maha as an initial amount. === Casting === Maha recruited most of his cast, nearly 80 non-actors, who are from the town itself. While no one in the town took seriously that he was making a film, they had shown great enthusiasm to act nonetheless. Maha also roped in Paruchuri for a role when she flew down from U.S. to visit the sets. === Principal photography === The film was shot for 62 days over two schedules in Kancharapalem and Bheemili suburbs of Visakhapatnam. === Post production === Post production work of the film is done at Ramanaidu Studios where its owner D. Suresh Babu happened to watch the film.

But C/o Kancharapalem is a slow burn that builds and builds, and it goes far beyond the Love, Actually template. Yes, it\u2019s cute and charming and very funny. But it\u2019s also\u2026 real. [...] There\u2019s a lot of mindfulness in the writing.[...] It\u2019s been a while since a film showed us a side of love that\u2019s so expansive, so generous, so attuned to the fact that love means\u2026 not just romantic love.\" Srivathsan Nadadhur of The Times of India rated it a \"4/5\" and reviewed, \"C/O Kancharapalem raises a toast to sincere, uncinematic storytelling, gives power to those unheard regional voices and does its part in undoing the stereotypical portrayal of community-specific stories in Telugu cinema.\" === Box office === At the US Box office, the film collected $36,000 on its first day, and $185,000 in the opening weekend. By the end of theatrical run, C/o Kancharapalem grossed of \u20b97 crore worldwide. == Remakes== The film is reported to be remade in Tamil and Malayalam. The remakes are to be directed by debutant Hemambar Jasti. == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Date of ceremony !Award !Category !Recipient(s) and nominee(s) !Result !Ref. |- | 5\u20139 September 2018 | Caleidoscope Indian Film Festival Boston | Best Actor | Subba Rao Vepada | | |- | rowspan=\"3\"| 6 January 2019 | rowspan=\"3\"| Zee Cine Awards Telugu | Best Critic Movie | Paruchuri Vijaya Praveena | | rowspan=\"3\"| |- | rowspan=\"2\"|Special Appreciation Award | Subba Rao Vepada | |- | Radha Bessi | |- | 22 April 2019 | Critics' Choice Festival of Indian films | Best Film \u2013 Telugu | C/o Kancharapalem | | |- | rowspan=\"6\"| 21 December 2019 | rowspan=\"6\"| Filmfare Awards South | Best Film \u2013 Telugu | C/o Kancharapalem | | rowspan=\"6\"| |- | Best Director \u2013 Telugu | Venkatesh Maha | |- | Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Telugu | Mohan Bhagat | |- | Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Telugu | Praveena Paruchuri | |- | Best Music Director \u2013 Telugu | Sweekar Agasthi | |- | Best Male Playback Singer \u2013 Telugu | Anurag Kulkarni | |- |} == Notes == == References == Category:2018 films Category:Social realism in film Category:Films shot in Visakhapatnam Category:Films shot in Andhra Pradesh Category:Indian films Category:Indian romantic drama films Category:Indian drama films Category:Indian-American films Category:Indian avant-garde and experimental films Category:Indian independent films Category:2010s avant-garde and experimental films Category:Slice of life films Category:Indian anthology films Category:Films about poverty in India Category:Films set in India Category:Telugu-language films Category:Films about courtesans in India Category:Telugu films remade in other languages Category:2018 directorial debut films ",
