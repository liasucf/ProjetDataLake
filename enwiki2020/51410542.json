This was the nation's sixth appearance at a Summer Paralympiad after it debuted at the 1996 Summer Paralympics. The Honduran delegation to Rio de Janeiro consisted of two athletes: powerlifter Gabriel Zelaya D\u00edaz and short-distance swimmer Emmanuel D\u00edaz. Both competitors were not ranked in their respective competitions after Gabriel Zelaya D\u00edaz was unable to lift any weights in his three tries and Emmanuel D\u00edaz was two minutes late arriving to his event. ==Background== Honduras debuted at the Paralympic Games at the 1996 Summer Paralympics. The country has participated in every Summer Paralympic Games since, making Rio de Janeiro the sixth time they have taken part in a Summer Paralympiad. At the close of the Rio Paralympics, Honduras had not won its first medal at the Paralympics. The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7\u201318 September 2016 with a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 National Paralympic Committees taking part. Honduras sent two athletes to compete at the Rio Paralympics, powerlifter Gabriel Zelaya D\u00edaz and Emmanuel D\u00edaz, a short-distance swimmer. Emmanuel D\u00edaz was selected to be the flag bearer for the parade of nations during the opening ceremony. ==Disability classifications== Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. ==Powerlifting== Gabriel Zelaya D\u00edaz was paralyzed as a consequence of being shot in the vertebral column and in the leg on 16 May 2004. He was 40 years old at the time of the Rio Paralympic Games and had limited experience competing in international powerlifting events. Zelaya D\u00edaz qualified for the Games by receiving an invitation from the Bipartite Commission and partook in the men's \u221272 kg competition. On 11 September, he was up against nine other powerlifters for the top three placings in Riocentro. Zelaya D\u00edaz was unsuccessful during his first try at lifting and could not do the same for at his second attempt. He waved to the crowd for encouragement just before his final try, but despite the increased support, was unable to record a mark. This meant Zelaya D\u00edaz was not ranked by the judges in the competition. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Athlete !scope=\"col\"|Event !scope=\"col\"|Result !scope=\"col\"|Rank |- align=center |align=left|Gabriel Zelaya D\u00edaz |align=left|Men's \u221272 kg |colspan=2|No Mark |} ==Swimming== Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Honduras student Emmanuel D\u00edaz was 20 years old at the time of the Rio Summer Paralympics, and these Games were his second significant international competition, after the 2015 Parapan American Games.
