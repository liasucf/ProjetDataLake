    "text": "Poecilotheria smithi, or the yellow-backed ornamental, is a species of large arboreal tarantulas. It is endemic to Sri Lanka and considered to be critically endangered. ==Size== Female is much larger than male with head-to- body length of 6\u20137 cm. Male is 4\u20135 cm. ==Identification== The species can be distinguished from other tiger spiders by all black legs parts (coxa, trochanter, femur) with prominent brushes on femur. ==Description== ===Female=== Dorsally carapace is dark brown in color. Patella is greyish. Tibia is brownish black. Tarsus is brownish, with a v-shaped light patch proximally. Ventrally first and second leg pairs are identical. Coxa, femur and trochanter are all black. Femur with thin white distal band. Patella white. Third and fourth leg pairs are identical. ===Male=== Dorsally, greenish brown. Folio markings are slightly darker. Ventrally similar to female. ==Ecology== Yellow-backed ornamental is one of the rarest tiger spiders found on the island, where it is confined to the Haragama area in Kandy, with very few sightings from regions of Matale. It is highly restricted due to habitat destruction. The species is much more docile and not as aggressive as other tiger spiders. This makes it one of the popular pet spiders in the world. ==References== ==External links== *bighairyspiders.com, yellow-backed ornamental (Poecilotheria smithi) *Tarantupedia *Itis.org *Academia smithi Category:Endemic fauna of Sri Lanka Category:Spiders of Asia Category:Spiders described in 1996 ",
