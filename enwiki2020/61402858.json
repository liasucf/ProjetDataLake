    "text": "350px The Watering Trough at Marly with Hoarfrost is an 1876 painting by Alfred Sisley. It was owned by Fran\u00e7ois Depeaux, a Sisley collector, and passed through other collections before ending up in that of Paul Mellon. It is now in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, United States. It was painted at Marly-le-Roi and is part of his Marly series. Sisley's works showing the watering trough and The Flood at Port-Marly are two series of Impressionist masterworks comparable to Claude Monet's Gare Lazare series, Renoir's The Swing and Bal du moulin de la Galette series, Berthe Morisot's Champs de bl\u00e9 series and Camille Pissarro's Vues de Pontoise and Toits rouges series.Richard Shone, Sisley, Phaidon, 1992, 2004, p. 85 Sisley did not much change his point of view between each painting, but he dramatically changed the background, proving his ability to vary views of a limited section of countryside. The watering trough became a favourite subject of Sisley's during his time at Marly, breaking with subjects of the 18th- and early-19th-century Paris Salons. Like Pissarro, Monet and Renoir, he showed more interest in its current domestic and utilitarian use than in its status as a remnant of the Ancien R\u00e9gime or its past life as an ornamental lake.Christopher Lloyd, in Sisley: Royal Academy of Arts, Londres, 3 juillet-18 octobre 1992, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris, 28 octobre 1992-31 janvier 1993, Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore, 14 mars-13 juin 1993, R\u00e9union des mus\u00e9es nationaux, 1992, p. 180Anthony Lacoudre, op cit, p. 132 == Context == Sisley moved into 2 avenue de l'Abreuvoir at Marly in winter 1874\u20131875 and remained there until 1877, exploring the village and its surroundings. A window of his house overlooked the abreuvoir and he made several studies of it and also of the town's park. Marly's abreuvoir was then the last remnant of the cascades, basins and fountains of the gardens of Louis XIV's ch\u00e2teau de Marly, designed by Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre and destroyed under the French First Empire.Pierre Cabanne, Guide artistique de la France Biblioth\u00e8que des guides bleus, ISSN 1776-7938, Hachette, 1968, p. 88 The waters of the Seine was pumped and channeled via the Aqueduc de Louveciennes and the Machine de Marly, two buildings which appeared in several of Sisley's works. Whilst he was living at Marly-le-Roi, the basin had been converted into an abreuvoir for watering horses and washing linen for the villages of Louveciennes and Marley,Frances Fowles, in Alfred Sisley: po\u00e8te de l'impressionnisme : Lyon, mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts, 10 octobre 2002-6 janvier 2003, R\u00e9union des mus\u00e9es nationaux, 2002, p. 174-176 but it was still the only part of the ch\u00e2teau's estate to be classified as a Monument historique, a title it gained in 1862.Gabor Mester de Parajd, \u00ab Le domaine de Marly aujourd\u2019hui \u00bb, Bulletin du Centre de recherche du ch\u00e2teau de Versailles [En ligne], | 2012, mis en ligne le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2013, consult\u00e9 le 12 novembre 2015.

Reproduction of the work in the domaine national de Marly-le-Roi above the Marly watering trough Since the 1990s, a full-size reproduction of the work has been on show near the site on which it was painted as part of the Pays des Impressionnistes project.Le circuit PissarroAnthony Lacoudre, Ici est n\u00e9 l'impressionnisme : guide de randonn\u00e9es en Yvelines, pr\u00e9face Claude Bonin-Pissarro, \u00c9d. du Valhermeil, 2003, , p. 141-142 The work shows a winter scene, including the ramp allowing horses to enter the water in summer, although that ramp features more markedly in Horse Bath in Port-Marly (D. 172). Lisa Portnoy Stein argues that Sisley slightly modifies their position and decreases the size of the basin, the better to show the village and its houses at the composition's centre. The work's horizontal composition, compared to the other works in the group, accentuates this impression. == Provenance == * Fran\u00e7ois Depeaux, Rouen * Sold by the Galerie Georges Petit, Paris, 31 May-1 June 1906, bought by Paul Durand-Ruel for 8 000 francs * Sold on 17 November 1913 to Paul Cassirer, Berlin * Dr Curt Hirschland, Essen * Wildenstein, New York * Mrs Hirschland, New York * Mr and Mrs Paul Mellon * Mr and Mrs Paul Mellon Collection, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond. == References == category:Paintings by Alfred Sisley category:1876 paintings category:Paintings of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Category:Water in art ",
