    "text": "\"Sugar\" Ray Seales, (born September 4, 1952) was the only American boxer to win a gold medal in the 1972 Summer Olympics. As a professional, he fought middleweight champion Marvin Hagler three times. He is also the former NABF and USBA middleweight champion. ==Family and early life== Seales was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where his father, who boxed in the U.S. Army, was stationed. The Seales family moved to Tacoma, Washington in 1965. He is the half-brother of boxer Dale Grant and the brother of boxer Wilbur Seales. ==Amateur career== Sugar Ray Seales Seales was a product of the Tacoma Boys Club amateur boxing program, and was coached by Joe Clough.:File:Joe Clough and Ray Seales.jpg Amateur record: 338\u201312 *1972 Olympic gold medalist (139 lbs.) *1971 National AAU light welterweight champion *1972 National Golden Gloves 139 pounds champion, defeating Donnie Nelson of Lowell, MA in the final === 1972 Olympic results === *Round of 32: defeated Ulrich Beyer (East Germany) on points *Round of 16: defeated Jim Montague (Ireland) on points *quarterfinal: defeated Andres Molina (Cuba) 3\u20132 *semifinal: defeated Zvonimir Vujin (Yugoslavia) 5\u20130 *final: defeated Angel Angelov (Bulgaria) 3\u20132 ==Pro career== Seales was a contender for the middleweight title during the late '70s and early '80s, winning the regional level USBA and NABF titles in the process. In his two most memorable fights, he lost a narrow decision to future middleweight champion Marvin Hagler in July 1974, then drew with Hagler in a rematch three months later. After losing to European champion Alan Minter in 1976, Seales remained on the outskirts of contention, until a first-round technical knockout at the hands of Hagler effectively ended his title hopes. ==Retirement== In 1980, Seales injured his left eye in a fight with Jaime Thomas, and retired due to a serious retinal tear. He was subsequently declared legally blind, and was used as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre along with Sugar Ray Leonard during the 1980s for those pushing for a ban on boxing. ==Life after boxing== Years later, doctors operated and restored Seales' vision in his right eye, though he wears glasses. Seales later worked as a schoolteacher of autistic students at Lincoln High School in Tacoma for 17 years, retiring in 2004. In 2006, he moved to Indianapolis with his wife, and currently teaches at Indy Boxing and Grappling. ==Honors== Seales was a 2005 inductee into the Tacoma-Pierce County Sports Hall of Fame. On May 5th 2018, Seales was inducted to the Indiana Boxing Hall of Fame in their inaugural class. ==References== ==External links== * |- |- |- Category:Living people Category:1952 births Category:African-American boxers Category:Boxers at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic boxers of the United States Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States in boxing Category:Middleweight boxers Category:Winners of the United States Championship for amateur boxers Category:People from Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands Category:Sportspeople from Tacoma, Washington Category:Boxers from Washington (state) Category:Medalists at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:American male boxers Category:Sportspeople with a vision impairment ",
