    "text": "\"I Love It\" is a song by American rappers Kanye West and Lil Pump, featuring guest vocals by American comedian Adele Givens, using snippets from her comedy material. The song was produced by West alongside DJ Clark Kent and frequent Lil Pump collaborator CBMix, with additional production by Ronny J. The song premiered at the 2018 Pornhub Awards. \"I Love It\" reached number one in Canada, Finland, New Zealand and Sweden, as well as the top 10 in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. The song is the third single from Lil Pump's second studio album, Harverd Dropout (2019). ==Background and release== Kanye West was the creative director of the inaugural Pornhub Awards on September 6, 2018. After a live performance with Teyana Taylor, West later premiered the music video for his new song with Lil Pump. West raps in a sexually explicit way in it that mirrors how he performed in the songs \"I'm In It\" and \"XTCY\". A remix with GOOD Music signee Valee has also been recorded but has yet to be released.https://twitter.com/valee/status/1059477397731491840 An edited version of the song known as \"I Love It (Freaky Girl Edit)\" was released to the iTunes Store on September 7, 2018, which West and Pump performed live on Saturday Night Live on September 29.performance The song was originally intended to be on West's ninth studio album Yandhi shortly after the performance, but the album suffered from multiple delays and was eventually scrapped. When Pump shared the track list for his second studio album Harverd Dropout on February 19, 2019, \"I Love It\" was shown to be the album's third track. ==Artwork== The artwork was painted by Shadi Al-Atallah, who also painted the artwork for West's previous single \"XTCY\". West asked Al-Atallah to paint the artwork using a color scheme inspired by a Kerry James Marshall painting.https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1038473744929320960 ==Reception== The song was panned by music critics. Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork described everything about it as what \"feels like it belongs in a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch about [West] that got cut\". West later expressed regret over making the track, stating in an interview with Big Boy's Neighborhood: \"Oh, I bet you The Devil was happy on that day.\" ==Controversy== On September 13, 2018, DJ David Morales accused West of stealing the bass line of \"I Love It\" from his remix to Alexander O'Neal's song \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\". West's ex-girlfriend Amber Rose posted to her Instagram on September 18 to accuse him and Pump of being inspired by her SlutWalk movement for the track, yet giving no credit. ==Music video== A still from the music video showing West (left) and Lil Pump (right) wearing giant rectangular body suits A music video for the single was premiered at the 2018 Pornhub Awards. West and Lil Pump wear giant, rectangular body suits reminiscent of characters from the video game platform Roblox and David Byrne's \"big suit\" from the concert film Stop Making Sense, as they walk down a hallway reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey, lined with women covered in mesh cloth posing as statues. The women statues can be seen moving, breathing, and shifting throughout the video. The video was executive-produced by Spike Jonze and directed by West and Amanda Adelson. Shortly after the release, Jonze revealed the early sketches for it. The music video garnered 76 million views globally in its first week surpassing \"This Is America\" by Childish Gambino as the biggest opening week on YouTube for a hip-hop video. Soon after its release, the video became a popular internet meme. ==Commercial performance== In the United States, the song debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, making it Kanye West's 17th top-ten song and Lil Pump's second top ten on the chart.
