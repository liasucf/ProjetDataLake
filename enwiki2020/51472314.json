Kadam has completed a master's degree in political science. He is a co-founder and the chairman of Borderless World Foundation, which is an NGO that works for the deprived and victimized people of the border areas of India. The NGO runs four orphanage homes for girls in four districts of Jammu and Kashmir. == Career == Early in his career, Kadam worked for many non- profit organizations as a Volunteer. He started visiting Kashmir on an educational tour in 1997. At the age of 19, he visited a Kashmiri Pandit refugee camp in Jammu to observe their conditions. During the Kargil War, he worked on the forefront, especially for the refugees who were displaced in Kargil, Batalik and Drass Sectors. Later he worked with Balraj Puri and the Institute of J & K Affairs on the project of \"Children affected by armed conflict in Jammu & Kashmir\" which was sponsored by UNICEF. He founded the Borderless World Foundation (BWF) in 2002 with another activist from Pune, Bharati Mamani and a local resident, Mohiuddin Mir who had been active in the region since 1998. The primary objective of the NGO was to assist orphans and provide for their basic necessities with a focus on education. They worked extensively under the project of \"Basera-e-Tabassum\" (Abode of Smiles) to establish orphanages for girls in the Kupwara district and later in Budgam district. Mohiuddin Mir was killed in 2005 by militants. From only 2 girls in 2002, the foundation has grown to accommodate more than 220 girls falling in the age group of 18 months to 20 years at four centers and can support at least 1000+ girls in the state of Jammu & Kashmir. The first center was established in the Sulkoot village of Kupwara. Kadam has opened several group homes for orphans of the war, particularly females who according to him are the most vulnerable in conflict situations. He was kidnapped by militants who suspected him of working for intelligence agencies but was released on the intervention of locals. He was later detained by security forces who had grown suspicious of him as he was released by the militants unharmed. Kadam is said to lead an ascetic lifestyle having dedicated his life to service and lives as described by an article in India Currents magazine as a \"penniless vagabond\". He considers his work to be a spiritual journey. == Borderless World Foundation == Kadam started Borderless World Foundation (BWF) in 2002 with the objective of creating a more humanitarian world. While conducting a children- centric socio-economic survey of the region, he gained insight into the challenges of the people living in these areas.

Currently, the BWF houses around 230 girls. More than 110 girls have been re-integrated into their communities and 40 are pursuing higher education. Kadam hopes to restore a \"culture of faith\" to the communities of Kashmir. The BWF currently has various ongoing projects and programs for humanitarian purposes. === Basera-e- Tabassum === Kadam initiated Basera-e-Tabassum (BeT), a shelter program established in 2002 for girls who lost their parents as a result of the armed conflict or terrorism during the ongoing Kashmir conflict. The four centers (group-homes) in Kashmir region are called Basera-e-Tabassum (abode of smiles) and the one in Jammu is called Fah (Facilitate and accomplish with humility). The BeT centers also assist mothers who have lost their husbands in the conflict in providing financial and material aid to their children. The BeT is supported by a few prominent philanthropists and well-wishers like the Holkar Family, Syed Ata Hasnain, Balraj Puri and Dr. S.Natarajan. The BeT also maintains facilities which allow children to travel to various cities for educational and exposure tours, and for higher education in professional courses. === Kashmir Life Line === Kashmir Life Line is an ambulance service launched in 2015 with the aid of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir.
