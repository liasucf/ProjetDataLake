    "text": "Le r\u00e9veil du Z, written by Tome and drawn by Janry, is the thirtyseventh album of the Spirou et Fantasio series, and the fifth of the authors. The story was initially serialised in Spirou magazine before being released as a hardcover album in 1986. ==Story== In The Awakening of Z, after the extraordinary temporal adventure that they have just lived at the sides of Aur\u00e9lien de Champignac, Spirou and Fantasio resume their journalistic activities. Fantasio is confronted with the skepticism of his new director of information, Kakeukh, who refuses to publish his article about the adventure. Being drunk, Fantasio is victim of an accident in the staircase of the Dupuis Editions, which obliges him to remain at the house with Spirou. The same evening, Snouffelaire appears in the house and it is suddenly transported to 2062, the time of Aur\u00e9lien. They quickly discover, in company of So-Yah, the assistant of Aur\u00e9lien, that the world is at the mercy of the descendant of Zorglub. Captured by Zorglhommes, they rejoin Aur\u00e9lien but succeed in escaping before breaking the Zorgloge, the heart of Zorglub Jr's power. Aur\u00e9lien, grateful, returns them to their own time. ==References== * Tome publications in Spirou and Janry publications in Spirou BDoubli\u00e9es ==External links== *Spirou official site album index Category:Spirou et Fantasio albums Category:Works originally published in Spirou (magazine) Category:Literature first published in serial form Category:1986 books Category:1986 in comics Category:Fiction set in the 2060s Category:Comics set in the 21st century Category:Comics about time travel ",
