    "text": "Mundet is a Barcelona Metro station, in the Horta-Guinard\u00f3 district of Barcelona, which takes its name from the Recinte Mundet, an adjacent area that now houses a campus of the University of Barcelona. The station is served by line L3. The station is located underneath the Passeig de la Vall d'Hebron and the Ronda de Dalt expressway, between Avinguda de Can Marcet and Passeig dels Castanyers. Access to the station is provided by an underground passageway allowing passengers to cross under the Ronda de Dalt; access is by stairs, escalators, and elevators north of the station, and level to the south, allowing the station to be supplied with natural light. One level below the passageway is a single long island platform served by two flanking tracks. The station was opened in 2001, when the section of line L3 from Montbau station to Canyelles station was inaugurated. It was designed by Ventura Valcarce. ==Gallery== File:Estaci\u00f3 de Mundet P1200569.jpg|Artwork in the station access File:Barcelona Metro - Mundet entrance.jpg|Underground passage ==References== ==External links== * Category:Barcelona Metro line 3 stations Category:Railway stations opened in 2001 ",
