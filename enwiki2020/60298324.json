    "text": "The San Jose municipal elections of 2010 were held on Sunday December 5 to elect the mayor, deputy mayors, syndics and district councilors of the central canton of San Jos\u00e9, capital of Costa Rica. Due to legal reform unifying the municipal elections with those of aldermen, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal decreed that for a single time the authorities elected in these elections would hold office for six years, so the next elections would be in 2016. The mayor in office Johnny Araya Monge of the National Liberation Party was the winner with more than 60% of the votes. Deputy Gloria Valer\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez, then member of the Citizens' Action Party (at the time the main opposition), was also a candidate. Deputy and former presidential candidate \u00d3scar L\u00f3pez Arias of the Accessibility Without Exclusion Party, as well as Mario Alfaro of the Libertarian Movement and Luis Polinaris of the National Integration Party were candidates. ==Results== ==References== Category:San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica Category:2010 elections in Central America Category:Mayoral elections in Costa Rica Category:2010 in Costa Rica ",
