He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1998 to 2017 for the Kansas City Royals, Houston Astros, New York Mets, San Francisco Giants, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Yankees, and Texas Rangers. A right-handed thrower and switch hitter, Beltr\u00e1n stands tall and weighs . Beltr\u00e1n was the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year in 1999 while with the Royals. He was named to nine MLB All-Star Games, and won three Gold Glove Awards and two Silver Slugger Awards. Beltr\u00e1n was the fifth player to reach both 400 home runs and 300 stolen bases and just the fourth switch hitter with 400 home runs. He has the highest success rate in stealing bases (88.3%) of any major league player with 300 or more career attempts. He also joined the 30\u201330 club in 2004. Beltr\u00e1n retired after the 2017 season, winning a World Series title with the Houston Astros. Beltr\u00e1n was among the best all- time statistical hitters in postseason games, which has earned him nicknames such as \"The New Mr. October\", \"Mr. October, Jr.\", \"Se\u00f1or Octubre\", and \"the real Mr. October\" from the media. During the 2017 Astros championship season, Beltr\u00e1n was the alleged leader in their illegal sign stealing scheme. The scandal broke three years later after an investigation by league officials, the commissioner and the media. Beltr\u00e1n, who had recently been hired as the Mets manager, left his new job without managing a game. ==Early life== In his youth, Beltr\u00e1n excelled in many sports, with volleyball and baseball being his favorites. At his father's urging, he gave up volleyball to concentrate on baseball when he was seventeen. He was originally a shortstop before moving to the outfield. He graduated from Fernando Callejo High School in 1995. ==Professional career== ===Draft and minor leagues=== The Kansas City Royals selected Beltr\u00e1n in the second round of the 1995 Major League Baseball draft. After he signed, the Royals assigned him to the Gulf Coast Royals of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. Originally only hitting right-handed, he batted .276 with no home runs. During the off season, Beltr\u00e1n taught himself to hit left-handed, with advice from New York Yankees outfielder Bernie Williams and Royals minor league coach Kevin Long. In 1996, he played for the Spokane Indians of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League, and the Lansing Lugnuts of the Class A Midwest League. In 1997 he spent the entire season playing for the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League.

The Yankees declined and the crosstown New York Mets signed him to a seven-year, $119-million contract, the biggest in franchise history at the time. It became the tenth contract in baseball history to surpass $100 million. On August 11, 2005, in a game against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park, Beltr\u00e1n was seriously injured after colliding head-to-head with fellow Mets outfielder Mike Cameron when both were diving to catch a ball in shallow right center field. Cameron missed the rest of the season with a concussion, temporary loss of vision, and two broken cheekbones. Beltr\u00e1n suffered vertigo for a while, although both players eventually recovered. A quadriceps injury bothered him most of the 2005 season and limited his speed. In 582 at bats, Beltr\u00e1n's stats included career lows in batting average (.266), home runs (16), RBIs (78), runs scored (83), and stolen bases (17). Despite the limited participation, he was still voted to his second All-Star team.
