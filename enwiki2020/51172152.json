And a solid ensemble cast doesn't hurt, either. Cool genre entertainment, really!\"Review: The Amityville Legacy, Search My Trash, by Mike Haberfelner == References == ==External links== * * Category:2016 films Category:2016 horror films Category:English-language films Category:American haunted house films Category:American films Category:Amityville Horror films Category:American supernatural horror films ",
