    "text": "Pose (stylized as POSE) is an American drama television series about New York City's African-American and Latino LGBTQ and gender-nonconforming ballroom culture scene in the 1980s and, in the second season, early 1990s. Featured characters are dancers and models who compete for trophies and recognition in this underground culture, and who support one another in a network of chosen families known as Houses. Created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Steven Canals, the series premiered on June 3, 2018, on FX. The series stars an ensemble cast including Evan Peters, Kate Mara, James Van Der Beek, Mj Rodriguez, Dominique Jackson, Billy Porter, Indya Moore, Ryan Jamaal Swain, Charlayne Woodard, Hailie Sahar, Angelica Ross, Angel Bismark Curiel, Dyll\u00f3n Burnside, and Sandra Bernhard. The first season was met with critical acclaim and subsequently received numerous award nominations including the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Drama and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama for Billy Porter. In 2019, Porter was awarded the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series \u2013 the first openly gay black man to be nominated for and win in an Emmy lead acting category. The series was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series at the same ceremony. The second season premiered on June 11, 2019 to further acclaim. Also in June, FX renewed the series for a third season. ==Premise== Pose season 1 is set in 1987\u201388 and looks at \"the juxtaposition of several segments of life and society in New York\": the African-American and Latino ball culture world, the downtown social and literary scene, and the rise of the yuppie Trump milieu. The second season begins in 1990. More of the characters are now either HIV-positive or living with AIDS. Some have become AIDS activists with ACT UP, and everyone is now attending frequent fundraisers, funerals and memorial services for their many friends and lovers in the community that has been hard-hit by the AIDS pandemic. With the release of songs by Madonna, Malcolm McLaren, and others, some aspects of the ballroom dance styles begin to go mainstream, and members of the community find new opportunities as dancers and dance teachers. Others are working as dominatrices and strippers. ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Evan Peters as Stan Bowes, Patty's yuppie husband who works in Trump Tower and later becomes Angel's lover.

Murphy explained this decision saying, \"The thing that struck me in talking to so many of them, was how much they've struggled, how under attack they feel, how many of them find it difficult getting healthcare, and finding jobs. I just decided I need to do more than just making a show for this community. I want to reach out and help this community.\" On July 12, 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season which premiered on June 11, 2019. On June 17, 2019, FX renewed the series for a third season. ===Casting=== Stars from the show \"Pose\" at Los Angeles Pride Parade In March 2017, Ryan Murphy and his team began casting for the series.

Creators and producers of the series such as \"Murphy, Canals and writer/producer Janet Mock all consider Paris Is Burning a text that helped inform not only the show, but also their identities when they first saw it.\" ==Reception== ===Critical response=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float: right;text-align:center; width:%70;margin:10px\" |- ! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season ! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response |- ! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Rotten Tomatoes ! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Metacritic |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#EFAFD8;\"| | 1 | 96% (76 reviews) | 75 (27 reviews) |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#7C0046;\"| | 2 | 97% (39 reviews) | 79 (14 reviews) |} ====Season 1==== On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 96% approval rating with an average rating of 8.03/10 based on 77 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Charged with energy, poise, and confidence, Pose pirouettes between artistic opulence and deliciously soapy drama to create a fresh new addition to Ryan Murphy's lexicon.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the first season a score of 75 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". In a positive review, Vanity Fairs Richard Lawson was effusive describing the series as \"an engaging portrait of dark days met with merriment. Pain and perseverance are sewn together to create something humble yet fabulous\u2014and, it should be shouted over all the show's loud and glorious clamor, very much long overdue.\" In a similarly favorable critique, Vultures Matt Zoller Seitz praised the series' ambition, aesthetic, and spotlight on minorities saying, \"it shows American audiences a world that has never been visualized on television at this length and at such an obviously grand budget level. The camera swings and swoops, glides and tumbles as in a Scorsese epic like Gangs of New York; in both the outdoor street scenes and indoor crowd scenes, it's obvious that FX has spared no expense to get the clothes, the cars, the streets, the business signs, and even the distinctive yellow-brown glow of streetlights correct.\" In a more mixed assessment, Newsdays gave the series two-and-a-half stars out of four and described it far less approvingly saying, \"good intentions don't always lead to good TV, and a couple episodes in, that appears to be the case with Pose. This certainly isn't bad TV\u2014Murphy isn't about to leave his longtime home with a turkey\u2014but it's often bland TV, and oddly enough, stock TV.\" In a negative evaluation, Slates Willa Paskin was outright dismissive saying, \"It's a TV show from one of the most canny creators working today, yet as a viewing experience it can feel like an object lesson.\" She continued on specifically criticizing the show's character development saying, \"So many of the people on Pose are strong women, trans paragons, and this comes at the expense of them being recognizably flawed human beings.\" ====Season 2==== On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the second season holds a 97% approval rating with an average rating of 8.25/10 based on 39 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A delightful, delicate dance of light and dark, Poses second season achieves a striking balance between the grittiness of reality and the glamour of the runway and shines even brighter.\" On Metacritic, season 2 holds a score of 79 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" ===Ratings=== ==== Season 1 ==== ==== Season 2 ==== ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\" ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Nominee(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2018 | align=\"left\" |Gotham Independent Film Awards | Breakthrough Series \u2013 Long Form | Pose | | align=\"center\" | |- | align=\"left\"| American Film Institute Awards | Top 10 TV Programs of the Year | Pose | | align=\"center\"| |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"31\"| 2019 | align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"| Golden Globe Awards | Best Television Series \u2013 Drama | Pose | | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| |- | Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama | Billy Porter | |- | align=\"left\" rowspan=\"4\"| Dorian Awards | TV Drama of the Year | Pose | | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"4\"| |- | TV Performance of the Year \u2014 Actor | Billy Porter | |- | LGBTQ TV Show of the Year | Pose | |- | TV Musical Performance of the Year | Billy Porter, Mj Rodriguez and Our Lady J (performing \"Home\") | |- | align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"| Critics' Choice Television Awards | Best Drama Series | Pose | | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| |- | Best Actor in a Drama Series | Billy Porter | |- | align=\"left\"| Writers Guild of America Awards | Television: New Series | style=\"max-width: 18em;\" | Steven Canals, Brad Falchuk, Todd Kubrak, Janet Mock, Ryan Murphy and Our Lady J | | align=\"center\" | |- | align=\"left\"| GLAAD Media Awards | Outstanding Drama Series | Pose | | align=\"center\" | |- | align=\"left\" |Peabody Awards | Entertainment honoree | Pose | | align=\"center\" | |- | Television Academy Honors | Outstanding Programs and Storytellers Advancing Social Change Through Television | Pose | | align=\"center\" | |- | MTV Movie & TV Awards | Breakthrough Performance | Mj Rodriguez | | align=\"center\" | |- | align=\"left\" rowspan=\"4\"| TCA Awards | Program of the Year | rowspan=\"3\"| Pose | | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"4\"| |- | Outstanding New Program | |- | Outstanding Achievement in Drama | |- | Individual Achievement in Drama | Billy Porter | |- | rowspan=\"7\"|Gold Derby Awards | Best Drama Series | Pose | | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"7\"| |- | rowspan=\"2\"|Best Drama Episode | \"Love Is the Message\" | |- | \"Mother of the Year\" | |- | Best Drama Actor | Billy Porter | |- | Best Drama Actress | Mj Rodriguez | |- | Best Drama Guest Actor | Christopher Meloni | |- | Best Ensemble | The cast of Pose | |- | align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"| Primetime Emmy Awards | Outstanding Drama Series | Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, Nina Jacobson, Brad Simpson, Alexis Martin Woodall, Sherry Marsh, Steven Canals, Silas Howard, Janet Mock, Our Lady J, Lou Eyrich and Erica Kay | | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"7\"| |- | Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series | Billy Porter (for \"Love Is the Message\") | |- | align=\"left\" rowspan=\"5\"| Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards | Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series | Alexa L.
