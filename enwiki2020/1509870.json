    "text": "The NTW-20 is a South African anti-materiel rifle, developed by Denel Mechem in the 1990s. It is intended for deployment against targets including parked aircraft, telecommunication masts, power lines, missile sites, radar installations, refineries, satellite dishes, gun emplacements, bunkers and personnel, using a range of specialised projectiles.Kokalis, Peter: Weapons Tests And Evaluations: The Best Of Soldier Of Fortune, page 223. Paladin Press, 2001. As with other weapons of this type, it can also be used for counter sniping and ordnance disposal (shooting explosive ordnance from a safe distance). ==Development== The weapon was designed by Tony Neophytou (co- designer of the Neostead combat shotgun). Development of the system began in August 1995 under the \"Aerotek\" name and a working prototype was ready for testing four and a half months later. This rapid progress was made possible by Neophytou's expertise in the field of recoil reduction systems, having worked on helicopter turrets in the past. To further reduce the amount of research and development, the project recycled the barrel, bolt and barrel extension of the existing Vektor GA1 automatic cannon.Kokalis, 224 It was put into production by Denel Land Systems in two versions; 20 x 110 and 20 x 82. The latter model is also available in 14.5 x 114 and conversion between the calibres can be done in the field by swapping the barrel and bolt assembly. The significantly larger 20 x 110 model cannot be converted to another calibre. The rifle was accepted into service with the South African National Defence Force in 1998.. ==Features== Switching between the two calibres of the NTW (20\u00d782mm and 14.5\u00d7114mm) requires changing the bolt, barrel, sighting gear and magazine. (A third variant, the NTW 20\u00d7110mm has been developed, but is not designed for barrel calibre switching.) Caliber switching the NTW 20/14.5 can be accomplished in the field without specialised tools. The magazine protrudes from the left side of the receiver. The NTW can be disassembled and packed into two backpacks for carriage. A muzzle brake is fitted on the end of the barrel which absorbs an estimated 50%\u201360% of recoil. This is further supplemented by a buffered slide in the receiver. ==Variants== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:98%;\" ! ! style=\"width:170px;\"| 20\u00d782mm ! style=\"width:170px;\"| 14.5\u00d7114mm ! style=\"width:170px;\"| 20\u00d7110mm |- !Cartridge | 20\u00d782mm | 14.5\u00d7114mm | 20\u00d7110mm Hispano-Suiza |- !Weight (empty) | | | |- !Overall length | | | |- !Rifling (1 full turn) | | | |- !Length of barrel | | | |- !Muzzle velocity | | | |- !Muzzle energy | 28,000 J ||32,000 J || ~40,000 J |- !Effective range | > | > | > |} ==Influence== Denel Land Systems was contracted to supply weapon systems for the Indian Armed Forces, including anti-materiel rifles and self-propelled howitzers. However, following allegations that it had paid kickbacks to secure a deal for anti- materiel rifles, Denel was blacklisted by the Indian government. Subsequently, the Ordnance Factory Tiruchirappalli (OFT), in association with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), began developing an indigenous anti-material rifle called Vidhwansak, which borrowed heavily from the Denel NTW-20. The development of Vidhwansak was completed in November 2005. The embargo against Denel was lifted in 2018 after investigations found the allegations to have been false. == In popular culture == *In the 2009 film District 9, a Denel NTW-20 rifle is used to attack an alien mech suit. *The designers of the Sniper Rifle System 99 Anti-Mat\u00e9riel (SRS99, formally known as the Special Applications Rifle) from the Halo video game franchise used the Denel NTW-20 as inspiration.http://www.giantbomb.com/forums/off-topic-31/meet- the-real-life-version-of-the-halo-sniper-rifl-5509/ == See also == * RT-20 (rifle) * Truvelo Sniper Rifles * Longest recorded sniper kills ==References== ==Bibliography== * == External links == * NTW 20 anti-materiel rifle 20 x 82 mm * NTW 20 anti-materiel rifle 20 x 110 mm HS * Modern Firearms Page * Category:14.5\u00d7114mm sniper rifles Category:20 mm artillery Category:Bolt- action rifles Category:20mm sniper rifles Category:Post\u2013Cold War weapons of South Africa Category:Denel Category:Anti-materiel rifles Category:Single-shot rifles Category:Weapons and ammunition introduced in 1998 ",
