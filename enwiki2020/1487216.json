A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, pp. 211-213 The pair came to power after Cermna killed the previous incumbent, Eochaid \u00c9tgudach, in battle at Tara. They were the first High Kings to come from the Ulaid. They divided the country between them, the border running from Drogheda to Limerick.Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.25 Sobairce ruled the northern half from D\u00fan Sobairce (Dunseverick in County Antrim), Cermna the southern half from D\u00fan Cermna (which Keating identifies as Downmacpatrick in Kinsale, County Cork). They ruled for forty years. Sobairce died at the hands of Eochaid Menn, son of the king of the Fomorians. Cermna was killed in the same year by Eochaid Faebar Glas, son of the previous High King Conm\u00e1el, in the battle of D\u00fan Cermna. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn synchronises their reign with those of Laosthenes in Assyria and Rehoboam in Judah. The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn dates their reign to 1155\u20131115 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 1533\u20131493 BC.Annals of the Four Masters M3667-3707 ==References== Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland ",
