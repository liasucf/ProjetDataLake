The music was composed by Brown with help from a grant from Chamber Music America. The final track, \"Stray(horn)\", is a ballad dedicated to Billy Strayhorn.Live at Firehouse 12 at Not two ==Reception== The All About Jazz review by Jeff Stockton states \"Brown's band mates are masters of small gestures, which make their virtuosic flourishes all the more dramatic...
