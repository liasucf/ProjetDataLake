In 2015 she was described by The Daily Beast as \"The Queen of Cam Girls\". ==Career== LittleRedBunny describes herself as a lifetime New Yorker. She got into the business of webcam adult entertainment, \"after she lost a straight job and was looking for something different.\" Utilizing her background in classical ballet and yoga to perform on the Internet, she began developing her own style of webcam performance. Since 2009 she has been working in the adult entertainment industry on the LiveJasmin website. She earns her income by selling private, one-on-one webcam sessions to fans. She says that she has held private webcam sessions that have lasted up to 19 hours. LittleRedBunny received a \"Best Webcam Girl\" award at the 2013 Sex Awards and the \"Favorite Webcam Girl\" award at the 2014 AVN Awards. In August 2014, LittleRedBunny headlined the inaugural Camming Con at Miami Beach, Florida's Eden Roc Hotel. LittleRedBunny has been noted for having \"one of the highest profiles among adult webcam models.\" In 2015, LittleRedBunny did an interview with CNBC regarding the growing number of cam models coming from Romania and Colombia. The article also examined some of the differences between American models and those from different countries. \u201cBecause we all live in different places, we don\u2019t all work the same hours, which is a good thing,\u201d [LittleRedbunny] said. \u201cI have a feeling that the behavior is slightly different as well. There are a number of girls who will type rather than talk, so that gives me something that works better for me.\u201d LittleRedBunny established the first webcam model academy in 2017 with her LittleRedAcademy and \"launched the industry's first global Comprehensive Webcam survery\" aimed at models and studios in 2019. She also established her philosophy of camming, called \u201cCamology and the Art of Camming\u201d in 2016- a philosophy that calls for an individualized approach to each member rather than a one size fits all concept. LittleRedBunny was recognized by Entertainment Tonight as having one of, \"The Most Revealing Red Carpet Looks of All Time.\" She came in 51/77. LittleRedBunny Co-hosted the following awards shows: The AW Awards in 2015, The YNOT Awards in 2017 with Jay Kopita, and the Live Cam Awards in 2018. ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
