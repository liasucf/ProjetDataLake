    "text": "\"Green, Green Grass of Home\", written by Claude \"Curly\" Putman Jr. and first recorded by singer Johnny Darrell in 1965, is a country song made popular by Porter Wagoner the same year, when it reached No. 4 on the country chart.Porter Wagoner's \"Green, Green Grass of Home\" Chart Position Retrieved July 3, 2012. It was also recorded by Bobby Bare and by Jerry Lee Lewis, who included it in his album Country Songs for City Folks (later re-issued as All Country). Tom Jones learned the song from Lewis' version, and in 1966, he had a worldwide No. 1 hit with it. ==Lyrics== A man returns to his childhood home; it seems that this is his first visit home since leaving in his youth. When he steps down from the train, his parents are there to greet him, and his beloved, Mary, comes running to join them. All is welcome and peace; all come to meet him with \"arms reaching, smiling sweetly.\" With Mary, the man strolls at ease among the monuments of his childhood, including \"the old oak tree that I used to play on.\" It is \"good to touch the green, green grass of home.\" Yet the music and the words are full of foreshadowing, strongly suggestive of mourning. Abruptly, the man switches from song to speech as he awakens in prison: \"Then I awake and look around me, at four grey walls that surround me. And I realize that I was only dreaming.\" He is, indeed, on death row. As the singing resumes, we learn that the man is waking on the day of his scheduled executionTom Jones, \"The Green Green Grass Of Home\" Video Retrieved July 3, 2012. (\"there's a guard, and there's a sad old padre, arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak\"), and he will return home only to be buried: \"Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree, as they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home.\" The Joan Baez version ends: \"Yes, we'll all be together in the shade of the old oak tree / When we meet beneath the green, green grass of home.\" ==Tom Jones version== Welsh singer Tom Jones, who was appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1965, visited Colony Records while staying in New York City. On asking if they had any new works by Jerry Lee Lewis, he was given the new country album. Impressed with the song, Jones recorded and released the song in the UK in 1966 and it reached No. 1 on 1 December, staying there for a total of seven weeks. The song has sold over 1.25 million copies in the UK as of September 2017. Jones' version also reached #11 pop, #12 easy listening on the Billboard US charts. In September 2006, Jones performed the song as a duet with Jerry Lee Lewis during the taping of the latter's Last Man Standing TV special in New York City, and credited Lewis with providing the inspiration behind his own recording. In February 2009, Jones performed the song live on a special Take-Away Show with Vincent Moon, along with \"If He Should Ever Leave You\" and \"We Got Love\", live in front of a camera in a hotel room in New York. Jones sang the song on the 2009/10 edition of Jool's Annual Hootenanny on 1 January 2010. ===Chart performance=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1967) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |- |- |- |Canada Adult Contemporary Singles (RPM) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|10 |- |Canada RPM Top 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==Other versions== Since then it has been recorded by many other solo vocalists and groups including: *1965: Del Reeves on his second album, Doodle-Oo-Doo-Doo *1966: Bobby Bare on his album, The Streets of Baltimore *1966: Bonnie Guitar on her album Miss Bonnie Guitar *1966: Charley Pride on the album Country *1967: Gene Parsons with the band Nashville West (album released in 1978) *1967: The Statler Brothers on their album Sing The Big Hits *1967: Roger Miller on his album Walkin' in the Sunshine *1967: A Serbo-Croatian language version by Miki Jevremovi\u0107 as Zelena Zelena Trava Doma Mog ...Diskos \u2013 EDK-3068 Vinyl, 7\", 45 RPM, EP, Mono *1967: A Swedish version by Stig Anderson as \"En s\u00e5ng en g\u00e5ng f\u00f6r l\u00e4ngesen\", of which both Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus' Hootenanny Singers and Jan Malmsj\u00f6 each had a 1967 Svensktoppen hit with, for six and 33 weeks respectively. *1967: Dalida, under the name of Les grilles de ma maison, disc (Super 45 t : 71167) *1967: Dean Martin on the album Welcome to My World *1967: J\u00fcrgen Herbst recorded a German cover version Der Weg zur\u00fcck nach Haus' (CBS 2529) *1967: Agnaldo Tim\u00f3teo, Brazilian singer, recorded the song on the album Obrigado Querida (Odeon \u2013 MOFB 3488), under the name of Os Verdes Campos Da Minha Terra, lyrics in Portuguese by Geraldo Figueiredo *1967: Nana Mouskouri under the name of \"Le toit de ma maison\" on the album Le Jour o\u00f9 la colombe *1968: Johnny Cash on the album Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison *1968: Frankie Laine on the album To Each His Own *1968: Hank Snow on the album Hits, Hits, and More Hits *1968: Porter Wagoner on the album Green Green Grass of Home *1968: Johnny Paycheck on the album Country Soul *1968: Merle Haggard on the album Mama Tried *1968: George Jones on the album The George Jones Story, and again on his 1972 release, Take Me. *1968: Trini Lopez on Welcome to Trini Country *1968: Pozo-Seco Singers on Shades of Time *1968: Pavel Nov\u00e1k Czech singer as V\u00edm, \u017ee jen sn\u00edm *1969: Joan Baez on the album David's Album *1969: G\u00e9 Korsten South African singer recorded an Afrikaans version \"Groene Velde Van My Land\" on the album Sing Seeman Sing *1969: The Grateful Dead performed it live a number of times *1971: The Deutschmeisters on their self-titled album *1971: Stompin' Tom Connors (a parody version as \"The Green, Green Grass of Home, No. 2\") on the album Stompin' Tom Connors, 'LIVE' at the Horseshoe *1972: The Fatback Band on the album Let's Do It Again *1975: Elvis Presley on the album Today *1976: Gram Parsons and The Flying Burrito Brothers on the album Sleepless Nights *1977: Kenny Rogers on the album Kenny Rogers *1980: John Otway released as a single *1986: Nick Cave quotes from the song in the opening line of \"Sad Waters\" on the album Your Funeral, My Trial *1986: Ted Hawkins on the album On the Boardwalk (The Venice Beach Tapes) *1989: A Danish version by Allan Olsen as \"Det gr\u00f8nne gr\u00e6s\" on the album Norlan *1993: Dennis Brown on the album The General *1993: Riblja \u010corba as \"Zelena trava doma mog\" on the album Zbogom Srbijo *2006: Katherine Jenkins on the album 'Serenade' *2008: Mike Farris on the album Shout!
