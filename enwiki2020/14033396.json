    "text": "The Cumberland Mine Railroad is a private carrier mine railroad operating at the Cumberland Mine near Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. The railroad is owned by Foundation Coal and transports coal to a barge dock on the Monongahela River. It is an isolated railroad, not connected to the North American railroad network. Two EMD SD38-2 locomotives and one EMD SD40-2 locomotive is used to move the coal trains. The line was once owned by United States Steel, as most of the coal was used downriver in primary steelmaking. The line has 3 locomotives and a fleet of leased and owned coal cars. Most trips are 37-39 coal cars with one or two locomotives. The track extends 17 miles from the river terminal to the preparation plant located about 2 miles west of Kirby. In 2009 Foundation was purchased by Alpha Natural Resources (NYSE: ANR). ==External links== * Trains Magazine * Railroad Fan.com * The Diesel Shop * Trainorders.com * Flickr * Observer-Reporter * Akron RR Club Category:Pennsylvania railroads ",
