A Bishop's Ring is a diffuse brown or bluish halo observed around the sun. It is typically observed after large volcanic eruptions. The first recorded observation of a Bishop's Ring was by Rev. Sereno Edwards BishopA brief biography of the Reverend Sereno Edward Bishop (with photo) appears on pages 171\u2013172 of: Kevin Hamilton (2012) \"Sereno Bishop, Rollo Russell, Bishop's Ring and the discovery of the \"Krakatoa easterlies\",\" Atmosphere-Ocean, vol. 50, no. 2, pages 169\u2013175. of Honolulu, after the Krakatoa eruption of August 27, 1883.See: * Bishop, Sereno E. (17 January 1884) \"Letters to the Editor: The remarkable sunsets,\" Nature, 29: 259\u2013260; on page 260, Bishop mentions a purple ring around the sun. * S.E. Bishop also mentions observations of a \"lilac or chocolate\" ring around the sun on page 129 of: Rev. Sereno E. Bishop (1886) \"The origin of the red glows,\" American Meteorological Journal, vol. 3, pages 127\u2013136, 193\u2013196. * Krakatoa Committee of the Royal Society [of London], The Eruption of Krakatoa and Subsequent Phenomena (London, England: Harrison and Sons, 1888). See: Part IV., Section I.(E) The large corona round the sun and moon in 1883-4-5, generally known as \"Bishop's ring.\" by Mr. E. Douglas Archibald, pages 232\u2013263. This gigantic explosion threw a vast quantity of dust and volatile gases into the atmosphere. Sulfate aerosols remained in the stratosphere, causing colorful sunrises and sunsets for several years. The first observation of this ring was published in 1883, being described as a \u201cfaint halo\u201d around the sun. Bishop observed the phenomenon on September 5, 1883; the phenomenon was subsequently named after him, and was the subject of an 1886 professorial dissertation (Habilitationsschrift) by Albert Riggenbach. Most observations agree that the inner rim of the ring is whitish or bluish white and that its outside is reddish, brownish or purple. The area enclosed by the ring is significantly brighter than its surroundings. From the sequence of colors with the red on the outside one can conclude that the phenomenon is caused by diffraction because halos always have their red part on their inside.Among the first people to recognize that Bishop's ring was a result of the diffraction of sunlight by dust particles was the Swiss physicist Eduard Hagenbach-Bischoff. See: Fran\u00e7ois-Alphonse Forel (1884) \"La couronne solaire de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1884\" (The solar corona of the summer of 1884), Archives des sciences physiques et naturelles, series 3, vol. 12, pages 173\u2013184; see especially page 182, where Forel says that the corona was not consistent with a 22\u00b0 halo, which is produced by refractions through ice crystals. On average, the radius of the ring is about 28\u00b0, but it can vary between 10\u00b0 and 30\u00b0, depending on the dust size.Asano, S. (1993) \"Estimation of the size distribution of Pinatubo volcanic dust from Bishop's Ring simulations.\" Geophysical Research Letters 20(6): 447\u2013450. The maximum of 30\u00b0 is a rather big radius which can only be caused by very small dust particles (0.002 mm) which all have to be of about the same size. Sulfur compound aerosols derived from volcanic eruptions have been found to be the source for the Bishop's Ring effect.Kenneth Sassen, Thomas Peter, Beiping P. Luo, and Paul J. Crutzen (1994) \"Volcanic Bishop\u2019s ring: evidence for a sulfuric acid tetrahydrate particle aureole,\" Applied Optics 33: 4602\u20134606. A Bishop\u2018s Ring was observed for a long period of time in Japan after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. ==References== ==External links== * Photograph of a Bishop's Ring, with commentary. * Meteorology glossary entry for Bishop's Ring. Category:Atmospheric optical phenomena ",
