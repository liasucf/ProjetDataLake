    "text": "Companion Gal is the third album by Helen Watson, released in 1992. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, South Wales and at The Mill in Cookham. All songs were written by Helen Watson and long-time collaborator Martin McGroarty; except \"Devil In You\" (with Keith Hopwood) and \"Billy But Beautiful\" (Watson). The album features guest appearances from Brinsley Schwarz and Andy Fairweather-Low. Companion Gal would be Watson's only album on RCA Records, who didn't promote it. She would continue to record for the rest of the 1990s and into the new century on small independent labels. == Track listing == # \"There Must Be Some Mistake\" # \"Someone You Want To Be With (More Than Me)\" # \"Not A Word Like 'Love' In Sight\" # \"Companion Gal\" # \"Breakout The Birdcage\" # \"Billy But Beautiful\" # \"The Devil In You\" # \"I Won't Tell On You\" # \"Manners\" # \"When We Came To The Sea\" # \"\u00a3100 Watch\" # \"One Blue Suit\" ==External links== * Helen Watson website * J.A.D.'s Helen Watson Webpage Category:1992 albums Category:Helen Watson (singer-songwriter) albums Category:RCA Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Rockfield Studios ",
