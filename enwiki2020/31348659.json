    "text": "\"It's Never Too Late For Now\" is the fifteenth episode of the fifth season of the American television comedy series 30 Rock, and the 95th overall episode of the series. It was directed by John Riggi, and written by Vali Chandrasekaran. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on February 15, 2011. Guest stars in this episode include Eion Bailey, Adriane Lenox, and Sue Galloway. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) decides to give up on love and tries being a spinster but eventually meets a man named Anders (Eion Bailey). However, there is more going on than there first seems. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) finds it hard to negotiate a proper salary with his night nurse, Sherry (Adriane Lenox) since she has some sort of leverage on him; and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) and Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) form a band and write a song. == Plot == Following her breakup from her pilot boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon), Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announces her intention to give up on love. Instead she will become a spinster, and to this end she has bought a cat and joined the senior center book club, which is reading Murder on the Orient Express. Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) is concerned and decides to take her to a bar called \"Canal Yards Project\" in order to show her that there are still viable men out there. Liz is uninterested until she meets an attractive man named Anders (Eion Bailey), with whom she winds up having a one-night stand. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) has difficulty negotiating a salary with his baby's night nurse Sherry (Adriane Lenox), whose approach to negotiation consists of eating a tangerine silently until he gives in, which completely throws him. At TGS, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) discovers that Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) used to be in Loverboy, so the pair form a band and write a song entitled \"It's Never Too Late for Now\", but arguments soon erupt between them, particularly when Frank's girlfriend Yuki (an obvious Yoko Ono parallel) becomes involved. Finally, Jack decides to use his night nurse's bargaining techniques in a business meeting with Kabletown, to great success, whilst Frank and Pete put their arguments aside. Liz arrives back at TGS the following morning having decided not to give up on love after all. However, in true Agatha Christie fashion she deduces that there was more to the night than there first seemed. It transpires that the entire evening was orchestrated by her friends, that \"Canal Yards Project\" is an anagram of \"Tracy Jordan's Place\" and Anders was a Swiss prostitute recommended by Martha Stewart. Despite this, Liz chooses to believe a simpler explanation for the evening and rejects spinsterhood in the belief that she will find love again. == Production == Actor Tracy Morgan was absent from this episode, his first of two absences continuing with the following episode \"TGS Hates Women\". Morgan had undergone a kidney transplantation, and would miss or have reduced roles in several episodes of the series whilst recovering. == Reception == Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, praising the unification of the storylines.
