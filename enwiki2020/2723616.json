During its initial run, Turboranger was the 11th Super Sentai and billed as the 10th anniversary title of the Super Sentai series (as Battle Fever J was originally designated as the first Super Sentai series). However, in 1995, Himitsu Sentai Gorenger and J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai officially became the first two Super Sentai series; thus making Turboranger the 13th in the franchise. ==Plot== Twenty thousand years ago, the Fairy race assisted humans in a battle against the Bouma Tribe and sealed them away. Due to modern day pollution and man's destruction of nature, the power of Fairy magic has weakened, allowing the seal to be broken and the Tribes escape. With the help of Dr. Dazai, Seelon, the last of the fairies, summoned five high school seniors. As children, they were showered with the \"flames of spirit\" of the fallen fairies in a forest, and can now hear Seelon's voice.

However, due to pollution that weakened the Fairy magic that sealed them, the Bouma are free to take their revenge on humanity from as their operations base. In the finale, Bouma Castle is destroyed by the Super Turbo Builder. * : The absolute dictator of the Bouma. He is initially partly immobile as he can still move his head and arms, he always remained seated on his throne with a set of tentacles that can stretch which he uses to punish his subordinates when they fail him. He is shown as merciless and cruel to everyone. He ends up sending Jarmin to her death after witnessing Zimba's brave sacrifice and that Yamimaru defeated the Turbo Robo. He sends Rehda to have his new Super Bouma Beast try to destroy the Turborangers. After Rehda and the Super Bouuma Beast were both killed, he decides to punish Zulten with his powers for cowardice. He 'dies' after the conspiracy of Yamimaru and Kirika, who decided to kidnap Riki and pit him against Ragorn in a one-on-one battle to the death. Riki mortally wounds him with a stab at the heart, causing him to receive explosions while Zulten only watched helplessly from a distance, not able to lift a finger to help him because of the red thread barrier Yamimaru and Kirika placed to trap him with Red Turbo. However, he becomes mobile after retrieving the monster-enlarging orb, he tries to kill Red Turbo and he grows giant and decides to punish the two traitors Yamimaru and Kirika for their treachery. He was then 'destroyed' by Super Turbo Builder. He later revives himself by consuming energies of hatred and sadness around him, and becomes the gold-skinned and mobile . He faces the Turborangers as a giant in the finale in which he is destroyed for good by the Super Turbo Robo. * : A bearded mystic genius with an ammonite- like head and a human face. He is second in command. Intelligent and cruel, he hates humanity and his schemes always involve the use of human deeds against humans themselves and mass killings of humans as well. He is usually portrayed to be the kind of field commander who does not show up often and works closely with Ragorn, receiving less ire and is entrusted with the most dangerous of operations. He is very skilled in witchcraft making him a powerful sorcerer. He was later sent to take care of the Turborangers with the Super Bouma Beast when both Jarmin and Jimba died where he almost buried them alive seeking revenge for Ragorn, as he was entrusted. When he saw the Turbo Robo pass by, he used his efforts to lure Red Turbo out to a battle hoping to divide the Turborangers. In that battle, Red Turbo and Rehda duel to the death. He reveals his illusion powers from his cape in an attempt to wipe out Red Turbo even with the ghosts of Jarmin and Zimba. However, Red Turbo managed to counter his attacks by slashing his cape, mortally wounded him and performed a GT Slash which inevitably killed him where he exploded violently as he uttered his final words in an illusion form cursing the Turborangers. * : A samurai- like keik\u014d-wearing masked warrior in black armor, expert in all martial arts with a mastery of swords. He loves to hate, a sadistic madman who takes pleasure in human suffering, especially when it comes to love. The reason from this was that Zimba was originally a man who fought a powerful army to win the heart of a princess he loved. However, when the fight left him near death, Zimba's final moments were the horrifying knowledge that the princess was disgusted by his ugly appearance and never loved him. He died soon after, his spirit burdened by his grudge and transforming his corpse into a Bouma. He is in love with Jarmin as well but denies it at times. When Ragorn becomes furious of how the Turborangers defeat them everything, Zimba protects Jarmin from their leader's rage while volunteering to finish the Turborangers once and far all. He bade farewell to Jarmin with a slashed bell who was sad to see him leave worrying he may never return. He was able to stop the Turborangers from being able to transform for a time but he was defeated by Red Turbo with a GT Crash and was finished off by the others with shots from the Turbo Laser. Yamimaru saw the opportunity to use him and he was enlarged which he defeated the Turbo Robo. However he was defeated by the Turbo Builder. * : A cold- hearted magician whose face becomes serpentine whenever angered, motivated to attack humans out of envy and spite while using a whip as her weapon in battle. Her tactics involve deception like when she forced the Ice and Fire Bouma to fight for her. It was insinuated by Zulten that she used the Sigh Bouma to impress her lover Zimba but she reacted by whipping him. When Ragorn got mad and decided to punish the others, she attempted to beg to Ragorn but her lover Zimba intervened to save her from death. She was hurt to see Zimba bid her farewell with a slashed bell fearing he may never return. When Zimba was killed, she was hurt as she had feelings for him holding the bell that Zimba slashed earlier. She was sentenced to death by Ragorn after Zimba's death where she released her ally Kuroko Bouma. The downside was that whatever happened to her monster also happened to her. She fused her soul with her other half but was destroyed by the Turbo Rugger. * : A fat, disgusting creature able to turn into an ATV-like vehicle for Jarmin. He is armed with a slingshot. A cheat who does anything to win; weak willed, always sucking up to superiors. He was the last of the original four bad guys serving Lagorn to be killed. He was not in good graces with Ragorn for his cowardice (and serves as a scapegoat after the death of Rehda, he also tried to use Zulten Metal Type to win his position back) and remained hidden at times afterward but shows up at times especially after Rehda's death and during the arrival of Yamimaru and Kirika and remained unable to help his master during the battle of Red Turbo and Ragorn due to the red thread barrier placed by Yamimaru. He sided with the Wandering Bouma fearing his death but returned loyalty to Ragorn afterward being the type to side with whoever is in charge. He was killed when he tried to perform an assault on the Turbo Builder via fighter jets. * : The foot soldiers under Ragorn's services, the black-skinned Ular are a Bouma Tribe and have the ability to merge into ball-shaped Ular Dumplings. They were originally led by , the Ular Clan's leader and greatest warrior who was sealed away. Once unsealed by Rehda with the Ular's prayers, Ular Bouma finds the Ular Road, which Japan National Route 44 was built on, and released the vast army of Ular sealed there. Then, to show his kind's unwavering loyalty to Ragorn, Ular Bouma has some of his Ular sacrifice themselves to invoke an earthquake to wipe out the human population. However, the Turborangers stop the scheme and the enlarged Ular Bouma was destroyed by the Turbo Robo's Turbo Cannon. The Ulars since vowed to kill the Turborangers to avenge their fallen leader. The Ulars are usually led to battle the red-skinned and , but they no longer show up later on. ====Wandering Bouma==== The are Y\u014dkai, the offspring of humans and demons. * : A Wandering Bouma who was refused from being a member of the 100 Violent Demon Tribes. Because he was half-demon, he was not sealed and simply wandered Earth for 20,000 years to obtain as much knowledge as he could, while never being accepted by people. In modern times, he assumed the guise of and got himself transferred to the same school as the Turborangers. His plan is to destroy both humans and Bouma and let the Wandering Bouma as the only ones. Originally shaggy-haired, he later gains flashy red and black armor after the death of Rehda and with the help of Kirika. Before that, when he saw Zimba dead, he decided to use him at his own advantage to defeat the Turbo Robo by enlarging Zimba. He rides the giant bat Dragras which was destroyed when it sacrificed itself to destroy the monster Sealing Bouma. He plotted the downfall of Ragorn along with Kirika. He apparently succeeded in Ragorn's supposed death by kidnapping Red Turbo and having the two battle against each other. He took charge of the Tribes until Ragorn's resurrection, when he was almost killed if not saved by Kirika. He became peaceful in the end possibly because he was in love with Kirika. **Weapons , Yami Knife, , Dark Bow, , , , , * : Another Wandering Bouma. She originally lived as a normal girl named until she learned that she is Wandering Bouma on her 18th birthday, shortly after finding that the man and woman who raised(and protected her for 20,000 years) were really just Skull Monsters. As Tsukikage, was an outcast in school who secretly loved Riki. She is permanently connected to Yamimaru through the \"red thread of fate.\" Cruel and lacking compassion, her resentment of humans stems from her life of being bullied. She is repulsed that the blood running through her is a mixture of human and demon, deciding to call herself a full-fledged demon and throw away her humanity for Yamimaru, resulting in his power-up and her armor. She combined with the monster Armor Bouma to become Armored Kirika. Near the final, she and Yamimaru meets Kirika's true father, a peaceful demon named , who tells them of how much he loved Kirika's fellow peaceful, human mother, who wanted for both sides to coexist and this begins to break the hatred of Kirika and causes her to cease fighting. Because she knows the hatred and loneliness that Yamimaru has been suffered for 20,000 years, she wishes him to release his hatred so she tries to persuade him. In the finale, she manages to save Yamimaru and left to live a peaceful life with him, as Sayoko and Hikaru. **Weapons five-pointed ringknife, ==Episodes== Before the very first story arc premiered in the second episode the following week; the first episode acted as a television special was aired to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Super Sentai since Battle Fever J at that time.
