Inactive after the early 1990s, it was reactivated in 2015 following the dissolution of the n\u00e9o-P\u00e9tainist movement L'\u0152uvre Fran\u00e7aise by the French authorities in 2013. == History == The organization was established in December 1983 by Pierre Bousquet, Pierre Pauty, Jean Castrillo, Andr\u00e9 Delaporte, Patrice Chabaille, and Henri Simon, all former National Front (FN) members who had split off from the party in 1980 after dismissing it as becoming \"too conservative\" and \"too Zionist\" following the death of Fran\u00e7ois Duprat in 1978. FN leader Jean-Marie Le Pen himself was seen a puppet of the Jews, and rising FN member Jean-Pierre Stirbois accused of secretly being a Jew. Pauty was the leader and first president of the Parti Nationalist Fran\u00e7ais (PNF). Their aim was to \"organize French nationalists and legally diffuse their doctrine\", but the racist ideology of a \"white Europe from Brest to Vladivostok\" failed to convince the public. Two years after the foundation of the Nationalist Party in June 1985, a group of radicals split off the PNF to create the French and European Nationalist Party (PNFE), whose members were involved in several terrorists attacks in the late 1980s, and which replaced the PNF as the main neo-Nazi group in France until its own dissolution in 1999. From the early 1990s, the PNF was weakened by the departure of its leader Pierre Pauty, who joined the FN in 1992, and by the death of Pierre Bousquet in 1991. In June 1995, Pauty obtained 26.2% of the votes in the municipal election of Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis. Meanwhile, the organization became inactive, with only its magazine Militant surviving. The party had no more than 100 militants during this period. After the dissolution of L'\u0152uvre Fran\u00e7aise in 2013, its president Yvan Benedetti, along with Andr\u00e9 Gandillon, the redactor-in-chief of Militant, reactivated the French Nationalist Party as a new outset for the banned association. In September 2015, Benedetti became its spokesman and called on all L'\u0152uvre members to join the PNF. == References == Category:French nationalism Category:Organizations established in 1983 Category:French nationalist parties Category:Far-right politics in France Category:Far-right politics in Europe Category:Pan-European nationalism ",
