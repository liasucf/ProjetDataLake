    "text": "Prohor Ra\u010danin (c. 1617 - 1678) was a monk-scribe and member of the School of Ra\u010da, a scriptorium in Bajina Ba\u0161ta that was ransacked by the Turks. Most of the monks eventually moved from Serbia to Szentendre in Hungary under the leadership of Arsenije III Crnojevi\u0107. Monk Prohor, however, left Ra\u010da monastery in Bajna Ba\u0161ta long before the Great Serbian Migration and settled in Belgrade where he taught at a monastery there until he died in 1678. He left several unpublished manuscripts, now held in the archive of the Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church. ==See also== * Jerotej Ra\u010danin * Kiprijan Ra\u010danin * \u0106irjak Ra\u010danin * Simeon Ra\u010danin * Teodor Ra\u010danin * Hristifor Ra\u010danin * Grigorije Ra\u010danin * Gavrilo Stefanovi\u0107 Venclovi\u0107 == References == Category:1610s births Category:1678 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Serbian monks Category:17th-century monks Category:17th-century Serbian people ",
