    "text": "Wilhelm Traugott Krug. Wilhelm Traugott Krug (22 June 177012 January 1842) was a German philosopher and writer. ==Life== Krug was born at Radis in Saxony, and died at Leipzig. He studied at Wittenberg under Franz Volkmar Reinhard and Karl Gottfried Jehnichen, at Jena under Karl Leonhard Reinhold, and at G\u00f6ttingen. From 1801 to 1804 he was professor of philosophy at Frankfurt (Oder), after which he succeeded Immanuel Kant in the chair of logic and metaphysics at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg. From 1809 till his death he was professor of philosophy at the University of Leipzig. He fought in the War of Liberation (1813\u201314) as captain of mounted chasseurs. ==Views== In philosophy his method was psychological; he attempted to explain the Ego by examining the nature of its reflection upon the facts of consciousness. Being is known to us only through its presentation in consciousness; consciousness only in its relation to Being. Both Being and Consciousness, however, are immediately known to us, as also the relation existing between them. By this Transcendental Synthesis he proposed to reconcile Realism and Idealism, and to destroy the traditional difficulty between transcendental, or pure, thought and things in themselves. Krug challenged Schelling to deduce his quill or pen from German Idealism's Philosophy of Nature. In so doing, he challenged the thinking that particular, perceptually real things could be logically known from general concepts. Beitr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte der Philos. des XIX. Jahrh. (1835\u20131837) contains criticisms of Hegel and Schelling. He was a prolific writer on a great variety of subjects, excelling as a popularizer rather than as an original thinker. His work stimulated freedom of thought in religion and politics, and he was a firm supporter of Jewish emancipation.Gotthard Deutsch, S. Mannheimer, \"Krug, Wilhelm Traugott\", Jewish Encyclopedia, 1906. ==Personal life== In 1804, Krug married Wilhelmine von Zenge (1780\u20131852), the eldest daughter of a Prussian major-general. They had six children. Wilhelmine had previously been engaged to Heinrich von Kleist.Heinrich von Kleist: Biography, Kleist Museum. ==Principal works== *Briefe \u00fcber den neuesten Idealismus (1801) *Versuch \u00fcber die Principien der philosophischen Erkenntniss (1801) *Fundamentalphilosophie (1803) *System der theoretischen Philosophie (1806\u20131810) *System der praktischen Philosophie (1817\u20131819) *Handbuch der Philosophie (1820; 3rd ed., 1828) *Logik oder Denklehre (1827) *Geschichte der Philosophie alter Zeit (1815; 2nd ed., 1825) *Allgemeines Handw\u00f6rterbuch der philosophischen Wissenschaften (1827-1834; 2nd ed., 1832-1838) *Universal- philosophische Vorlesungen f\u00fcr Gebildete beiderei Geschlechts *Beitr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte der Philos. des XIX.
