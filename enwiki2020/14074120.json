    "text": "Fredrik Andersson Hed (born 20 January 1972) is a former Swedish professional golfer, who is now a commentator. ==Golf career== Andersson Hed was born in Halmstad. He turned professional in 1992. He has had two victories on the Challenge Tour but found success hard to come by on the main European Tour, where he had to return to qualifying school on numerous occasions. He was known as Fredrik Andersson until his marriage in 2004 when he added his wife's surname. Andersson Hed won his first European Tour title at the 2010 BMW Italian Open at Royal Park, outside Turin, on his 245th attempt. Two weeks later he finished tied second, with Luke Donald, at the European Tour flag ship event, the 2010 BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth Club, Virginia Water, England, one shot from winner Simon Khan. 2010 became his best year on the European Tour, when he finished 22nd on the Order of Merit. He was runner-up another five times on the European Tour, at the 2003 Madeira Island Open, 2007 Valle Romano Open de Andalucia, 2011 Barclays Scottish Open, 2012 UBS Hong Kong Open and 2012 Omega European Masters. Andersson Hed announced his retirement from golf after missing the cut at the European Tour Qualifying School in November 2015 by one stroke. ==Commentator== Since 2016, Andersson Hed has been a golf commentator for the national public broadcaster Sveriges Television. ==Amateur wins== *1990 Swedish Junior Stroke-play Championship *1990 European Young Masters ==Professional wins (3)== ===European Tour wins (1)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner-up |- |align=center|1 |9 May 2010 |BMW Italian Open |\u221216 (70-66-63-73=272) |2 strokes | David Horsey |} ===Challenge Tour wins (2)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|8 Aug 1993 |Toyota PGA Championship |\u22126 (67-71-69=207) |2 strokes | Rikard Str\u00e5ngert (a) |- |align=center|2 |align=right|15 Oct 2000 |Le Touquet Challenge de France |\u221211 (71-68-68-70=277) |Playoff | Carlos Rodiles |} Challenge Tour playoff record (1\u20130) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent!!Result |-style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\" |align=center|1 |2000 |Le Touquet Challenge de France | Carlos Rodiles |Won with par on second extra hole |} ==Results in major championships== {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !1995 !1996 !1997 !1998 !1999 |- |align=left|The Open Championship |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|PGA Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |} {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text- align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !2000 !2001 !2002 !2003 !2004 !2005 !2006 !2007 !2008 !2009 |- |align=left|The Open Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T50 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T69 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |T65 |- |align=left|PGA Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |} {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !2010 !2011 |- |align=left|The Open Championship |T68 |T57 |- |align=left|PGA Championship |T62 |CUT |} CUT = missed the half-way cut \"T\" = tied Note: Andersson Hed never played in the Masters Tournament or the U.S. Open. ==Team appearances== Amateur *European Amateur Team Championship (representing Sweden): 1991 *European Youths' Team Championship (representing Sweden): 1992 (winners) *Eisenhower Trophy (representing Sweden): 1992 *St Andrews Trophy (representing the Continent of Europe): 1992 Professional *Royal Trophy (representing Europe): 2011 (winners) ==See also== *2006 European Tour Qualifying School graduates *2009 European Tour Qualifying School graduates ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Swedish male golfers Category:European Tour golfers Category:People from Halmstad Category:1972 births Category:Living people ",
