It was located in the Loire Valley on the south bank of the River Loire, downstream from the town of Amboise and about southwest of the royal Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise. From 1761 to 1785 Chanteloup belonged to King Louis XV's prime minister, the Duke of Choiseul. The ch\u00e2teau was mostly demolished in 1823, but some features of the park remain, notably the Pagoda of Chanteloup, a significant tourist attraction.Pagode de Chanteloup website. ==History== ===Origins=== In the 16th century the site was nothing more than a tenanted farm, but it was elevated to a fief in January 1668. Fran\u00e7ois le Franc, a fruit seller to the Duke of Alen\u00e7on (youngest son of Henry II of France and Catherine de M\u00e9dicis), purchased it on 7 June 1583 and erected a house with a chapel. He became the mayor of Amboise in 1588. Claude-Arnoul Poncher, who acquired the property by his marriage to Marie-Madeleine le Franc (daughter of Fran\u00e7ois le Franc, grandson of Fran\u00e7ois le Franc, the fruit seller), sold it on 21 October 1695 to Louis le Boultz, the Grand Master of Waterworks and Forests of Touraine, Anjou and Maine.Carr\u00e9 de Busserolle 1879, p. 110; Andr\u00e9 1928, pp. 21\u201322; Chenu & Stainier 2014, p. 2. Around 1700 Louis le Boultz created large, well-ordered gardens and added other structures, so that it was no longer a simple country house.Chenu & Stainier 2014, p. 2.

D'Aubigny was the secretary for the Princesse des Ursins from 1701 to 1714, a period when she was very influential at the court of Philip V of Spain, the grandson of Louis XIV. D'Aubigny hired the well-known French architect Robert de Cotte in 1711 to remodel the house into a ch\u00e2teau. Robert de Cotte also worked on the Princess's apartments at the Royal Palace in Madrid and on designs for the Spanish king's country estate on the outskirts of Madrid, the Buen Retiro. The Ch\u00e2teau de Chanteloup was probably intended for her future use, but she was never to see it. At her death in 1722, as her sole heir, d'Aubigny retained sole possession of the ch\u00e2teau and its park.Chenu & Stainier 2014, p. 2; \"Chanteloup History\", Chanteloup website; Neuman 1994, p. 229 note 4; Gallet 1995, p. 289\u2013290. D'Aubigny's focus in 1711, when construction began, was on Spain and the south. Robert de Cotte modified the central part, the corps de logis and the two pavilions at its ends (most of which already existed), and added the lateral wings flanking the cour d'honneur, a design typical of a ch\u00e2teau, so that the ensemble faced south. The principal entrance to the forecourt leading to the ch\u00e2teau was on the south side, on the road to Spain.Andr\u00e9 1935, pp. 24\u201326. There was a passageway from the cour d'honneur through the west wing to the service court (basse cour) and stables on the west.Plan of the premier \u00e9tage of the Ch\u00e2teau de Chanteloup. Biblioth\u00e8que de l'Institut de France, Paris. Digital copy from the website of the Agence Photo de la RMN. The remodeling included the creation of an east-facing gallery in the east wing and a chapel in the northwest corner, both with a project of decoration entrusted to Henri de Favanne, d'Aubigny's favorite painter, who had already worked on d'Aubigny's Parisian h\u00f4tel.Moreau 2008, p. 1.

The park was divided into numerous geometrically arranged groves of tall trees (bosquets), bordered by alleys lined with a variety of species of trees, and decorated with ornamental ponds. It was enclosed on the east, west, and south by a wall and on the north by a moat, and encompassed an area of about 500 arpents ().Andr\u00e9 1935, p. 26; Moreau 2008, p. 3. D'Aubigny died in the Ch\u00e2teau de Chanteloup in April 1732. Saint-Simon, who died in 1755, described Chanteloup in the period after d'Aubigny's death, as \"one of the most beautiful and singular places in all France, and the most superbly furnished.\"Saint-Simon 1857, p. 100. A plan of 1761 from the Municipal Library of Tours shows gardens around the ch\u00e2teau in the formal French style, perfected by Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre in the latter half of the 17th century, with parterres of broderie and lawn, galleries of topiary, extensive bosquets (especially to the east and southeast), water basins, tree- lined paths and kitchen garden (potager) on the west side, south of the stables and other service buildings.MBA Tours 2007, p. 9; Grateau 2015, p. 70 (source of the reproduction); Andr\u00e9 1935, p. 35 (garden plan drawn by Andr\u00e9 after the original); Watson 1966, p. 157 (style).

For comparison, the gardens and park of Versailles, when they reached their greatest extent under Louis XIV, covered an area of .Hoog 1996, p. 372. A 1761 general site plan, from the French National Archives in Paris, shows that one of the first changes Choiseul made was to cut numerous tree-lined avenues and alleys in complex geometric patterns in the newly acquired Forest of Amboise to the south of the ch\u00e2teau, creating a Grand Park. Seven of the avenues converge on the half-moon (demi-lune) parterre of the Spanish Gate, forming a classic French patte d'oie (goose-foot pattern), a feature seen at several grand French ch\u00e2teaux of the 17th century, including the Ch\u00e2teau de Richelieu, Vaux- le-Vicomte, and Versailles.MBA Tours 2007, p. 9; Moreau 2008, pp. 3\u20134; Watson 1966, p. 157. ====Master plan==== Choiseul engaged the architect Louis-Denis Le Camus to modernize and enlarge the ch\u00e2teau.Gallet 1995, p. 290. A master plan (grand dessein) was developed which was never to be completely realized.Grateau 2015, p. 84. A version of 1761 at the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France shows numerous proposed modifications and additions to the ch\u00e2teau of Robert de Cotte.\", 1761\", Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, d\u00e9partement Cartes et plans, GE A-1124 (RES). For example, this plan shows a theatre wing running east from the southern end of the east lateral wing, which is not seen in numerous later representations of the ch\u00e2teau. Other features, which were realized in one form or another, included additional courtyards, stables, and service buildings to the west of the ch\u00e2teau. Six miniature paintings by Louis-Nicolas van Blarenberghe dated 1767, which decorate a gold snuffbox, show the architectural composition as intended by Choiseul and his architect, such as the theatre wing, rather than that which had actually been built.

Each was topped with a promenade enclosed with balustrades decorated with ornamental vases and terminated with rectangular pavilions, the one on the east with a Salle des Bains (Bath Hall), and the one on the west with a chapel. Each of the matching pavilions was raised by one storey and covered with a terrace with a balustrade.Andr\u00e9 1935, pp. 28\u201329; Watson 1966, p. 156; Grateau 2015, p. 84. File:Chanteloup, The Seat of the Duke de Choiseul \u2013 Antiquariat, Wien (AB) (cropped).jpg|View of the north facade with the colonnades and pavilions added by Louis-Denis Le Camus Choiseul and Le Camus also shifted the main entrance to the north, allowing access from the road along the Loire by which carriages arrived from Amboise and Paris. The great entrance grille, the Grille Dor\u00e9e (Golden Grille), was 12 toise (about 24 yards) in length and was flanked by two guard pavilions, which still exist. The gate was surmounted by the Choiseul arms. Although the Choiseul arms have been lost, the gate itself is now found at the prefecture of Indre-et-Loire in Tours. The forecourt contained a sunken central parterre, surrounded by a retaining wall (ha-ha), and in its center, an ornamental basin (pi\u00e8ce d'eau) with two water-jet fountains (jets d'eau). The carriage drive forked, passing to either side of the parterre and crossing two parallel bridges over the moat into the entrance court, which had a long central parterre with broderie of cut grass and low bands of flowers and a circular central ornamental basin with a single jet d'eau.Andr\u00e9 1935, pp. 28\u201329, 32\u201333; Moreau 2008, p. 5; Watson 1966, p. 156.

The demi-lune parterre itself was transformed into a lake.Grateau 2015, pp. 84, 86; Watson 1966, p. 157. The cascade is depicted in two of Van Blarenberghe's snuffbox miniatures and in a 1768 painting by Jean- Pierre Hou\u00ebl, part of a series of six overdoors for the music room of the ch\u00e2teau, of which four survive.Conisbee 1996.

The canal is shown on a 1770 site plan attributed to Le Camus and is depicted in paintings by Louis-Nicolas Van Blarenberghe and Nicolas Perignon.Andr\u00e9 1935, after p. 28; Watson 1966, p. 157, plate 750; Grateau 2015, pp. 82, 89 (Van Blarenberghe), 96 (Perignon). The demi-lune lake and the canal still exist, although the canal is filled-in and has become a lawn.Moreau 2008, p. 5; Watson 1966, p. 157; Satellite view of the Canal de la Pagode at Zoom Earth.

Le Camus used them again to fill in the setback of one toise (about two yards) of the south facade of the corps de logis (facing the cour d'honneur) with a seven-bay colonnaded portico, including a central avant-corps of three bays with a wider set of steps (perron) leading down to the courtyard.Andr\u00e9 1935, pp. 28\u201329; Watson 1966, p. 156. The portico can be seen in a view of the south facade of the ch\u00e2teau taken from the middle of the cascade, painted around 1770 by Nicolas Perignon.Grateau 2015, pp. 96\u201397. In the center of the corps de logis, Le Camus created a large entrance hall, through which one could pass to reach the courtyard on the south, the cour d'honneur. To the left of the entrance hall was a series of three large rooms, and to its right a large dining room with windows facing north, rather than the cour d'honneur as before.Andr\u00e9 1935, pp. 28\u201329.

The one attached to the east wing contained a complete apartment, comprising an entrance foyer, antechamber, grand chamber (with windows facing east), and on the south, a boudoir, office (cabinet), closet (garde-robe), and a staircase leading to the floor above. This apartment was used by Choiseul's sister, the Duchess of Gramont, when she came to visit. The old part of the east wing contained the apartment for the duke, a large gallery, and the apartment for the duchess, Louise-Honorine Crozat, daughter of Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Crozat, marquis du Ch\u00e2tel, and heir to many of the Italian paintings from the collection of her great-uncle, Pierre Crozat. Some of these paintings were displayed in the gallery. The matching pavilion attached to the west wing contained the apartment of the officier de bouche (chef), an office and a laundry. The old part of the west wing contained a new kitchen (closer to the main dining room), offices, and the servants' dining room.Andr\u00e9 1935, pp. 28\u201329; Watson 1966, p. 156 (Italian paintings).

Before returning to Paris in 1775, after the lifting of his exile by Louis XVI, Choiseul introduced a large, informal jardin anglo-chinois (replacing the French formal gardens east of the main axis of the ch\u00e2teau) and commissioned the construction of what is now the former ch\u00e2teau's most famous feature, the seven-storey, -tall Pagoda of Chanteloup, built in 1775 by Le Camus.Watson 1935, p. 157; MBA Tour 2007, p. 4. The pagoda was located just to the north of the demi-lune lake. The garden cascade flowing down to the pi\u00e8ce d'eau near the cour d'honneur was suppressed at this time and transformed into a bowling green (boulingrin), apparently due to a lack of sufficient water to keep it flowing.Moreau 2008, p. 9.

The French Revolution began a period of decline, the property becoming a public good in 1797 and sufferering abandonment until 1802, when it was bought by the chemist-industrialist Jean-Antoine Chaptal.MBA Tours 2007, p. 2; Crosland 2008. Chaptal, a rich man, was minister of the interior under Napoleon and became a member of the French Senate in 1804. He expended a considerable amount of money restoring the property and in 1808 declared \"it was fit to receive a king.\"Crosland 2008. He raised sheep, distilled brandy, and experimented with beet farming and the large-scale production of beet sugar.MBA Tours 2007, p. 4; Crosland 2008. In order to pay heavy debts owed by his son from investments in the chemical industry,Crosland 2008. Chaptal decided to sell. The Duke of Orl\u00e9ans purchased the section of the park with the Pagoda, but declined to buy the entire domain. In 1823 Chaptal sold the remainder of the park and gardens and the ch\u00e2teau itself to a consortium of goods merchants, the \"bande noire\" (\"black bandits\"), including the socialist banker Barth\u00e9lemy Prosper Enfantin and the speculator Baudrand, acting for the wealthy . The group dismantled most of the ch\u00e2teau, dispersing architectural souvenirs throughout the Touraine, many of which can still be seen in public and private places.MBA Tours 2007; Andre\u00e9 1935, p. 22 (\"bande noire\"); Gallet 1995, p. 290 (Enfantin); Watson 1966, p. 158 (Baudrand and Montesqiou). ===1823\u2013present: Domaine de Chanteloup=== Only some of the park, two pavilions, a semicircular ornamental pool, and a few other garden features survive,Watson 1966, p. 158; Gallet 1995, p. 290. the most important of which is the Pagoda, restored in 1910 by architect Ren\u00e9 \u00c9douard Andr\u00e9 (son of the landscape architect \u00c9douard Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9).Holmes 2008, pp. 124\u2013125.
