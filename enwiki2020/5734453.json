    "text": "Captain Byron Curtis Weston (April 9, 1832 \u2013 November 8, 1898) was a native of Massachusetts who founded the Weston Paper Company in 1863 (which ceased to exist following its sale in 2008) and served as the 32nd Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts from 1880 to 1883. He came from an old New England Congregationalist family of extraordinary wealth. In 1865, he married Julia Clark Mitchell, with whom he had ten children, including Julia Carolyn Weston, mother to the well known chef Julia Child. They lived in a mansion known as Westonholme, in Dalton, Massachusetts. Byron was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate in 1876. Weston was known for his gifts to the community, including the Grace Episcopal Church in his hometown and funds towards the debt incurred for the grading and draining of an athletic field and monies toward upkeep and a grandstand at Williams College. Weston received an honorary M.A. from Williams College in 1886 and the field, still used today, was named Weston Field in his honor. Byron's daughter Ellen Mitchell Weston married Hale Holden in 1895. == References == ==External links== *Byron Weston at Denver Post Online *New York Times obituary *Southworth buys Weston Category:1832 births Category:1898 deaths Category:American businesspeople Category:Papermakers Category:Union Army officers Category:Massachusetts Republicans Category:Massachusetts state senators Category:Lieutenant Governors of Massachusetts Category:19th-century American politicians Category:People from Dalton, Massachusetts Category:Burials at Main Street Cemetery (Dalton, Massachusetts) ",
