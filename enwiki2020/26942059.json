    "text": "Lockwood Brothers F.C. was an English association football club based in Sheffield, Yorkshire. ==History== Lockwood Brothers were a works team formed in the early 1870s. During the Amateur v Professional crisis of the 1880s, they took a stand by refusing to play the professional clubs of Lancashire. They won the Sheffield Challenge Cup twice in the 1883\u201384 and 1884\u201385 seasons. They entered the FA Cup four times between 1884 and 1887. In 1884, they were beaten by Staveley 3\u20131 in the third round after beating Sheffield 4\u20131 and Rotherham 3\u20131. In 1885, Sheffield gained revenge beating them 3\u20130 in the first round and in 1886 Notts Rangers advanced to the second round at their expense. In 1887 they gained several Wednesday players due to their failure to register for the cup in time. Having to compete in Qualifying Rounds for the first time, they reached the first round by beating Long Eaton Rangers 1\u20130, Cleethorpes 4\u20131 and Nottingham Forest 2\u20131 and receiving a bye in the fourth qualifying round. They were finally knocked out in the first round by West Bromwich Albion, losing 2\u20131. ===Notable former players=== Players that played in the Football League either before or after being with Lockwood Brothers \u2013 * Ned Stringer ===League and cup history=== {| class=\"wikitable collapsible \" style=font-size:75% |- !colspan=\"2\"|Lockwood Brothers League and Cup historyFA Cup Archive The FALockwood Brothers WildStat |- !
