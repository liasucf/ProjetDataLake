    "text": "Pambiche is a Dominican music genre and dance form derived from merengue t\u00edpico, the traditional style of merengue. It has a slower tempo than standard merengue and its tambora rhythm is based on the cinquillo. This style of merengue was originally known as merengue estilo yanqui (yankee-style merengue) or \"Palm Beach one step\", from which the term pambiche stems (corruption of \"Palm Beach\"). It is said to have originated from the americanized versions of merengue that the US military personnel performed during the occupation of the Dominican Republic. It is considered one of the most difficult americanized Latin American dances. ==Recordings== Dominican accordionist El Prodigio released an album entitled Pambiche Meets Jazz in which he combined traditional merengue rhythms (most of the songs featuring pambiche) with American music styles such as jazz, rock and blues. Both pambiche and merengue are included in Jean Fran\u00e7aix's suite \"Cinq Danses Exotiques\". ==References== Category:Caribbean music genres Category:Dance in the Dominican Republic Category:Latin American folk dances ",
