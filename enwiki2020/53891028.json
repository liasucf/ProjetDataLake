    "text": "\"Stoner Sloth\" was an anti-cannabis public service announcement series of three videos, created by Australia's New South Wales Department of Premier and Cabinet in 2015. ==Content== Each ad begins with a scenario involving people in public places. As everyone is acting \"normal\", it is all disrupted by Stoner Sloth, a sloth who reacts slowly while moaning. Stoner Sloth is meant to represent the behavior of a stereotypical stoner and its actions are accompanied by a musical cue of a guitar being weakly strummed. The human characters around Stoner Sloth usually react with disgust or disappointment. ==Reception== The creative firm Saatchi & Saatchi created the ads which \"backfired miserably\" and were an \"instant and classic fail\", according to trade publication Adweek. The agency defended its ads, which cost $500,000. The National Cannabis Prevention and Information Centre distanced itself from the campaign. ==See also== * Substance abuse prevention ==References== ==External links== * Category:2010s television commercials Category:2015 in Australian television Category:2015 in cannabis Category:Anti-cannabis public service announcements Category:Australian advertising slogans Category:Cannabis in Australia Category:Fictional sloths and anteaters Category:Words and phrases introduced in 2015 ",
