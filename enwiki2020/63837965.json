    "text": "Lucid is the fourth studio album by French-Nigerian singer A\u1e63a. It was released on October 11, 2019, through Chapter Two Records and Wagram Music. It is a soul, folk, and rock album that incorporates elements of funk and folk rock. It is more personal and less political compared to her previous albums. The production was primarily handled by drummer Marlon B and contains additional elements of jazz, reggae and neo-soul. The album's title depicts the place where she is currently at in her life. Lucid utilizes piano-led ballads, strings and soft brass to tell a tale of the brokenhearted. The lyrics explore topics such as love, heartbreak, self-discovery, empowerment, joy, pain and identity. The album's singles \"The Beginning\", \"Good Thing\", and \"My Dear\" were all released in 2019. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended the symbolic nature of A\u1e63a's songwriting and considered it to be her deepest and most emotionally robust record. The album was support by a Lucid album tour, which commenced in November 2019. ==Background and promotion== A\u1e63a took a five-year hiatus from music before revealing plans to release Lucid. On France 24, she recalled spending time away from the spotlight in an attempt to \"live normal\". In September 2019, A\u1e63a announced the album's title, cover art, and release date simultaneously. In an interview with Griot magazine the following month, she said the title Lucid depicts the place where she is currently at in her life. A\u1e63a said some of the songs were written in her flat in Paris while others were written at her studio in Lagos. She also stated to have written the album like a diary and poured all of her joy, heartbreak, laughter and longing on it. Prior to unveiling plans for the release of Lucid, A\u1e63a released the singles \"The Beginning\" and \"Good Thing\", along with their accompanying music videos. In November 2019, A\u1e63a embarked on the Lucid album tour. She performed in major cities of France, Germany, and Switzerland. A\u1e63a was scheduled to headline the Asa Live in Lagos concert, which would have occurred at the Eko Convention Centre on April 11, 2020. However, she ended up canceling the concert and her remaining tour dates due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. ==Music and lyrics== Lucid comprises 14 tracks and is a follow-up to A\u1e63a's critically acclaimed third studio album, Bed of Stone (2014); it is a soul, folk and rock album that incorporates elements of funk and folk rock. Compared to A\u1e63a's previous albums, Lucid is more personal and less political. It was primarily produced by drummer Marlon B, and contains additional elements of jazz, reggae, and neo-soul. Lucid utilizes piano-led ballads, strings and soft brass to tell a tale of the brokenhearted. It explores topics such as love, heartbreak, self-discovery, empowerment, joy, pain and identity. The first song of Lucid, \"Murder in the USA\", is a melancholic track that is reminiscent of \"Dead Again\" from Bed of Stone; it makes allusions to police and uses homicide as a metaphor to resolve a doomed romance. The song was accompanied by a short video that narrates the story of a young woman who was raped by her jealous fianc\u00e9. A\u1e63a said the abusive relationship between her mother and father inspired the song. In \"The Beginning\", A\u1e63a implores her love interest to restart with her. The song furthers the album's narrative undertones and was inspired by a quote from a Hindu saint who offered advice to a group of people quarreling on the Ganges. Pulse Nigeria's Motolani Alake described \"The Beginning\" as a \"lo-fi, melodious post-break-up song that details the residual love still between the warring partners\". Zama Mdoda of Afropunk.com praised A\u1e63a's vocal tone and said the song \"lifts and uplifts\". \"Good Thing\" is an ode to moving on after an unfavorable circumstance; the song features a pop-soul instrumental arrangement. In \"Stay Tonight\", A\u1e63a claims arguments and improper timing as reasons for relationship failures; the song's production is reminiscent of tracks produced by Starsailor and Daft Punk. In the guitar ballad \"Torn\", A\u1e63a sings about a desire to rip her lover's heart in half if he puts her through a heartbreak; she also contends with harsh truths and hard- earned lessons. In the jazz-infused ballad \"Happy People\", A\u1e63a forgets her worries and documents the happiness associated with Nigerian parties. \"You and Me\" contains an uptempo drum beat and guitar strumming; it has been described as the \"happiest song on the album\". The sentimental ballad \"Femi Mo\" (English: \"Don't Want Me Anymore\"), which was performed entirely in Yoruba, addresses the breakup of a 10-year relationship. \"Makes No Sense\" provides a dose of self-awareness and portrays A\u1e63a as someone who has been hurt, neglected and rejected by her love interest. \"365\" documents the end of a five-year emotionally-draining relationship; the song features violin and guitar strings. \"9 Lives\" is a message to A\u1e63a's former lover on the strength that she endured, after having been through emotional turmoil. Logan February said the song \"falls short as a formidable statement, but works as a humanistic representation of the damage endured even by the strong\". In the soul-inspired track \"Don't Let Me Go\", A\u1e63a uses soliloquy to address a looming breakup. The closing track to Lucid, \"My Dear\", is a melancholic counterpart to \"Happy People\", with A\u1e63a singing about her love interest being absent from their engagement party. ==Singles== Lucids lead single, \"The Beginning\", was released on May 14, 2019. A\u1e63a teased the song on Instagram prior to its release. The album's second single, \"Good Thing\", was released on June 25, 2019. The accompanying music video was directed by Sesan and released two months later; it is entirely a combination of subplots. The video features a woman who is acceptant of her vitiligo and another who overcomes the urge of overdosing. On September 27, 2019, A\u1e63a released the third and final single, \"My Dear\", along with a live rendition video recorded at Studios Ferber in Paris. ==Critical reception== Lucid was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Motolani Alake of Pulse Nigeria commended the album for showing A\u1e63a documenting three different thematic perspectives, though he criticized it for having \"no sonic uniqueness\". Chuks Nwanne from The Guardian said Lucid is \"about love in different guises\" and praised A\u1e63a for \"amplifying her voice on it\". Leslie Addo of Pop Magazine characterized the album as \"a masterpiece and personal diary for anyone dealing with a broken heart\"; Addo also said A\u1e63a's lyrical delivery will \"give you the imaginative powers to transport yourself to another place\". Journalist Vincent Desmond applauded the album's curation and cohesiveness, and said it has a \"complete love story that wavers between indifference, loss, Sunday morning bliss with your lover and everything in between\". In a review for The Lagos Review, Logan February said the album \"honors the highs and lows of love, and the journey of learning to be alone after the party ends\". Ifeoluwa Nihinlola commended A\u1e63a for sticking to the formulaic approach of her previous music and said \"to constantly change is to betray an existential anxiety\". Music critic Michael Kolawole described Lucid as \"a whiplash of emotion, a carefully crafted blow to the heart, an end-product of a wizened soul, and a letter of self-discovery\". Kolawole also notes that while the album does not break new ground, it is still a \"beautiful album that's designed for the brokenhearted\". In a less enthusiastic review, Carl Terver of Praxis Magazine said A\u1e63a failed to outdo her last offering with the album and that her lyrics have \"become weakened by a preference for popular songwriting\". Music critic Dami Ajayi criticized A\u1e63a for toying familiar lines, while failing to take new in-roads. Ajayi also said Lucid is her \"ambitious attempt to collapse the ethos of all her previous albums into a formidable product to keep fans swooning for another half decade\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from A\u1e63a's interview with Griot magazine. *Bukola Elemide \u2013 primary artist *Marlon B \u2013 producer ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
