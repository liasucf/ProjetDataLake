The Ragged Staff is believed to refer to Morvidus, an early legendary Earl of Warwick who is said to have slain a giant \"with a young ash tree torn up by the roots.\"Stephen Turnbull: The Book of the Medieval Knight, Arms and Armour, 1995, , p. 160 The emblem of a bear (Latin ursus) is believed to refer to Urse d'AbetotMason \"Legends of the Beauchamps' Ancestors\" Journal of Medieval History pp. 34\u201335 (c. 1040 \u2013 1108), 1st feudal baron of SalwarpeSanders, I.J.
