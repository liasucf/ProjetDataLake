    "text": "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Nu\u00f1ez Carmona is an Argentinian businessman and entrepreneur who is a business partner and close friend of Amado Boudou, the Vice President of Argentina. He is one of the principals in the Boudougate scandal, which has been described by the Argentina Independent as \u201ca messy tangle of crossed accusations.\u201d The case involves the printing firm Calcogr\u00e1fica Ciccone, which has done many printing jobs for the Argentinian government, including the printing of money. The firm was bought in September 2010 by The Old Fund, a company run by N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona's friend Alejandro Vandenbroele, and it was charged that Vandenbroele was in fact a front for Boudou and N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona, with the latter acting as a middleman in the secret acquisition of the printing firm, whose name was changed after the purchase to Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Valores Sudamericana (CVS). N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona is nicknamed \u201cNariga.\u201d ==Early life and education== He attended Instituto Arzobispo Jos\u00e9 Antonio de San Alberto in Mar del Plata, where he was a classmate and close friend of Boudou. ==Career== Beginning in 1997, he and Boudou owned a real-estate firm called Inversiones Inmobiliarias Aspen. He and Boudou were also partners in a firm called Habitat Natural. This firm, established on August 4, 2010, was purportedly involved in the \u201cconstruction, alteration and repair of buildings.\u201d According to a 2011 news report by Jorge Lanata, the firm was not known to have actually been involved in any construction or other activities as of that date, but in March 2011 its capital stock increased in value from 40,000 to 720,000 pesos. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona also owned a firm called Action Media, which earned a great deal of money from government advertising. Founded in October 2005 by Sandra Rizzo and Cesar Forcieli, the firm made nearly a million dollars in ad income from Telam, the Argentinian government's official news agency. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmon was tried for attempting to bribe a manager of Telam in 2008, but was acquitted. Beginning in 2005, Nu\u00f1ez Carmona organized a series of rock festivals in Mar del Plata called Rock & Arena. Boudou and N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona are said to be \u201cdrinking buddies\u201d as well as business partners. \u201cThey are so close,\u201d reported La Nacion, \u201cthat when Boudou bought an apartment on River View in Puerto Madero, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona bought one a few floors away; when one of them bought a Harley Davidson, the other did, too.\u201d Both men also owned apartments close to each other in San Lorenzo in Mar del Plata. ==Legal activity== ===Boudougate=== The printing firm Calcogr\u00e1fica Ciccone, which routinely printed banknotes, passports, and various documents for the Argentinian government, was asked by the Argentinian tax authorities in July 2010 to declare bankruptcy, given that it owed a debt of 239 million pesos to the state treasury. In September, however, the firm was allowed to refinance its debt; in October, it received an investment of 2.3 million pesos from a Dutch- based company, The Old Fund, which thereupon acquired 70% of the firm, whose name was changed to Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Valores Sudamericana (American Securities Company), or CVS. It was later revealed, in a 2014 report, that The Old Fund, whose public face was N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona's friend Alejandro Vandenbroele, had received $1.8 million in September 2010 from a firm called London Supply, one of whose shareholders was Michelangelo Castilian, a longtime friend of Boudou and N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona, and that Vandenbroele's second-in-command at CVS was Jose Mar\u00eda Capirone, a former business partner of N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona and Boudou. According to Vandenbroele's wife, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona represented The Old Fund in discussions with Ciccone's creditors aimed at securing their approval for the takeover by The Old Fund. The Boudougate scandal had not yet fully erupted when El Urgente reported on August 25, 2011, that N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona, who had previously been identified as a friend of Boudou, had now proven himself also to be a business partner of Boudou, who at the time was Argentina's Economy Minister and candidate for the Vice Presidency. Although the full extent of Boudou's role in the purchase of Calcogr\u00e1fica Ciccone was still not known to the public, El Urgente summed up what was then known about N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona's role in the matter, and stated that because of the whiff of scandal touching Boudou via N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona, the latter had \u201cbecome a problem for Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez.\u201d The Boudougate scandal fully erupted after prosecutor Carlos Rivolo's February 24, 2012, interview with Vandenbroele's wife, Laura Mu\u00f1oz, about her husband's connections to Boudou and N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona. She told Rivolo that her husband and N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona ran a \u201cghost consultancy\u201d in Puerto Madero that handled \u201cmoney bribes\u201d and that was a front for Boudou. Although Boudou rejected these charges, an April 4, 2012, raid on an apartment owned by Boudou established his connection to Vandenbroele. On May 14, Federal prosecutor Jorge Di Lello called for Boudou, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona, Vandenbroele, and Boudou's domestic partner, Agustina K\u00e4mpfer, to be investigated for embezzlement, in addition to 10 companies, including The Old Fund. It was reported on October 20, 2013, that a case against \u201cBoudou and others\u201d for illegal enrichment was on the desk of Judge Lijo, and that the \u201cothers\u201d included N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona, Kampfer, and Vandenbroele, as well as Juan Carlos L\u00f3pez, Sandra Viviana Rizzo, Fabi\u00e1n Hugo Carosso, Hugo Nicol\u00e1s Carosso, and Pable Pellet Lastra. On June 10, 2014, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona was supposed to testify in the Calcogr\u00e1fica Ciccone case, but informed the court through his lawyers that he was not in Buenos Aires and would therefore not be able to testify. The inquest was therefore postponed, although no new date was set. On June 12, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona again failed to show up in court to testify in the case, and Judge Lijo warned him in writing that if he did not appear for an inquest on June 19, he would order his immediate arrest and an international arrest warrant. It was reported on July 15 that N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona had been in M\u00e1laga, Spain, since the preceding day, July 14, and planned to be there through August 6, on a trip whose purposes were unknown. On June 16, Jorge Lanata reported on Journalism for All that N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona was, in fact, in Uruguay, having traveled to Montevideo on June 6. It was reported on June 17 that Guillermo Reinwick had filed a new complaint, stating that N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona had told him: \u201cIf you touch the Vice President, I'll set fire to your kid.\u201d This accusation, which Reinwick had first made in testimony before Judge Lijo in the Ciccone case, was being handled as a separate case by Federal Judge Marcelo Martinez De Giorgi. According to Reinwick, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona had made various threats to him beginning in February 2012, saying, \u201cWe know where you live and that you have five children\u201d and \u201cYou touch the Vice President and I'll go to your house and Pacheco will put a bullet in your son.\u201d On June 24, 2014, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona appeared in court, where he was scheduled to be questioned by Federal Judge Ariel Lijo. But he refused to testify, purportedly because he had not had sufficient time to prepare his defense. He had previously failed twice to make scheduled court appearances. On June 26, 2014, La Naci\u00f3n reported that N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona, Vandenbroele, and Guido Forcieri had traveled to Brazil together in 2011. On June 27, the trial of Boudou, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona, Vandenbroele, and Resnick Brenner before Judge Lijo got underway, and all the defendants asked Lijo to delay the trial, a request he rejected. Lijo also prohibited all the defendants, except for Boudou, from leaving the country. In addition, he ruled that it had been established as a fact that Boudou and N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona had bought Ciccone through The Old Fund with the objective of profiting from government printing contracts that Boudou would be able to arrange because of his official position. On July 10, Boudou appealed the prosecution; the next day, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona did the same. Lijo stated on July 11, 2014, that he had determined that Vandenbroele had indeed been a front man for Boudou and N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona, and tried them all on charges of bribery and irregular negotiations. He noted that N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona and Boudou had both become millionaires as a result of their joint activities, while Vandenbroele lost money. The court ruled in late June 2014 that Boudou and N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona had acquired Ciccone Calcogr\u00e1fica while Boudou was Minister of Economy via The Old Fund and Vandenbroele, \u201cwith the ultimate goal of contracting with the Federal Government to print money and official documentation.\u201d The court determined that Boudou, using his position as a public official, and N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona had arranged with Nicholas and Hector Ciccone and Guillermo Reinwick for a transfer of 70% of Calcogr\u00e1fica Ciccone in exchange for actions arranged by Boudou that would enable the firm to resume operations and obtain government contracts. It was reported on September 4, 2014, that an appeal in the Ciccone case would take place on October 7 before Judge Lijo, with Boudou, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona, Nicol\u00e1s Ciccone, Guillermo Reinwick, Rafael Resnick Brenner, and Vandenbroele being tried for charges of bribery and business activities incompatible with public office. ===Gabella perjury lawsuit=== Guillermo Gabella, the director and shareholder of the Boldt printing firm, stated that after The Old Fund bought Ciccone, N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona demanded \u201con behalf of Boudou\u201d that Boldt return equipment that it had rented from Ciccone. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona denied this charge, and sued Gabella for perjury. ===WSM lawsuit=== On November 11, 2013, it was reported that an old friend of N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona from Mar del Plata, Luis Scolari, who had founded the WSM public-relations firm with Boudou and N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmora, had accused him of improperly receiving public funds by billing the state for WSM's services. The case was handled by Judge Diejo Slupsky and prosecutor Viviana Fein. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Argentine businesspeople Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
