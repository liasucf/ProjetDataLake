In 2009 and 2010 she exhibited Society Girls in Kuwait and London. The subject of her 2012 exhibition at Al M Gallery, It's a Man's World, was men in GCC countries. Kuwait City officials shut down the show three hours after its opening, deeming the content \"pornographic\". According to Amin the authorities focused on a work depicting three card-playing men \"drinking 'grape juice' from a bottle which suggested contraband alcohol\" and her work My Mistress and Family, which portrays a man with a woman in a minidress sitting in his lap. Her 2013 exhibition in Dubai, Popcornographic, explored taboos in Middle Eastern society. She is represented by Ayyam Gallery. In 2013, she was awarded Artist of the Year by Arab Woman Awards.
