    "text": "\"Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble\" is the debut single by DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, from their 1987 debut album Rock the House released on Philadelphia-based Word Records (Later changed to Word-Up Records). It was released in 1986. The music is built around a sample from the theme tune of the 1960s television series I Dream of Jeannie. It was featured in the 8th episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air where Will and Carlton were battling over a girl. The lyrics \"nothing but trouble\" were rerecorded by Jazzy Jeff in \"Deep, Deep, Trouble\" from The Simpsons Sing the Blues. In the song, Will Smith warns his crew to stay away from young women and recounts some unfortunate (but humorous) experiences with them. In the end of the 1988 version, DJ Jazzy Jeff references two of the duo's further singles, \"Parents Just Don't Understand\" and \"Nightmare on My Street.\" The song was only released on vinyl. The music video was released in 1986.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOaFh-yJk_k On April 21, 2016, after the death of Prince, MTV accidentally aired this music video during a Prince marathon. ==Track listing== ; 7\" Vinyl # \"Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble\" \u2013 5:12 # \"Guys Ain't Nothing But Trouble\" \u2013 4:34 ; 12\" Vinyl #1 # \"Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble\" (Laidley & Oakenfold Remix) \u2013 7:30 # \"Guys Ain't Nothing But Trouble\" \u2013 4:34 ; 12\" Vinyl #2 # \"Girls Aint Nothing But Trouble\" (1988 Extended Remix) \u2013 4:44 # \"Girls Aint Nothing But Trouble\" (Instrumental) \u2013 4:44 # \"Brand New Funk\" (Extended Version) \u2013 4:48 # \"Brand New Funk\" (Live Version) \u2013 4:36 ; American 12\" Vinyl # \"Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble\" (1988 Extended Remix) \u2013 4:44 # \"Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble\" (Live Version At Nassau Col) \u2013 5:28 # \"Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble\" (1988 Single Version) \u2013 4:21 # \"Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble\" (Instrumental) \u2013 4:44 ; Promotional 12\" Vinyl # \"Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble\" (Original Radio Version) \u2013 5:12 # \"Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble\" (Original Instrumental) \u2013 5:12 # \"Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble\" (Def Def Mix) \u2013 5:02 # \"Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble\" (Def Def Bonus Beats) \u2013 3:00 ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1986) !Peak position |- |UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|21 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|57 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs |align=\"center\"|81 |- !Chart (1989) !Peak position |- |Australia (ARIA) |align=\"center\"|142 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1986 debut singles Category:DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince songs Category:Songs written by Will Smith Category:Songs written by DJ Jazzy Jeff Category:I Dream of Jeannie ",
