    "text": "Jens Adler (born 25 April 1965) is a German former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. His sole international appearance came for East Germany in the national team's last match on 12 September 1990. He came on to replace Jens Schmidt as a late substitute in a 2\u20130 away win over Belgium, although he never touched the ball. As a result, he became the last man to win a cap for East Germany. Adler played for Hallescher FC for eleven seasons, either side of German reunification. In 1995, he moved to Hertha BSC, but played very little, where his only senior appearance saw him come on as a substitute for Christian Fiedler in a match against KFC Uerdingen 05. After two seasons he returned to Halle, this time to sign for VfL Halle 1896. He retired from football in 2000 and returned to Hallescher FC to serve as goalkeeper coach. == References == == External links == * * * Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Halle (Saale) Category:People from Bezirk Halle Category:German footballers Category:East German footballers Category:Footballers from Saxony-Anhalt Category:East Germany international footballers Category:Hallescher FC players Category:Hertha BSC players Category:VfL Halle 1896 players Category:2.
