    "text": "Museo del Oro Precolombino, San Jose, Costa Rica. Sib\u00fa is the primary deity in the Talamancan mythology of Costa Rica. He is the creator of Earth and humanity, god of wisdom, values, and indigenous customs. He is called Sib\u00fa by the Bribri and Cab\u00e9car, Sib\u00f6 by the Teribe, and Zipoh by the Boruca. Sib\u00fa is also a culture hero, who taught the Bribri and Cab\u00e9car people what foods are safe to eat, how to plant crops, set down the rules of society regarding incest, clans, and morality, and gave the Aw\u00e1pa (Bribri shamans) songs, ritual language, and magic stones (s\u0129\u00e3' ). In Bribri and Cab\u00e9car culture, Sib\u00f6 is seen as the \"owner\" or \"guardian\" (Bribri: wak) of humanity, as he created the first human beings out of corn seeds. == Family == * S\u00ecitami - mother of Sib\u00fa * Sib\u00f6k\u00f5m\u00f5 - father of Sib\u00fa * N\u00e3m\u00e3it\u00e3m\u0129, also called Tapir - Sib\u00fa's sister, mother of Ir\u00ecria * Ir\u00ecria, also called Sul\u00e1ra, la Ni\u00f1a Tierra, or tapir girl - Sib\u00fa's niece * Sul\u00e1 - father of Ir\u00ecria, lord of the underworld * Bikakra - grandmother of Ir\u00ecria * S\u00f3rkura or S\u00f3rkuLa - grandfather (in some sources, grand-uncle) of Sib\u00fa * Tsuru' - Sib\u00fa's wife, goddess of cacao == Birth of Sib\u00fa == There are different versions about the birth of Sib\u00fa (Sib\u00f6), but all agree that, before the god came to earth, the world was ruled and inhabited by a race of devils, the S\u00f2rburu, headed by his grandfather S\u00f3rkura. S\u00f3rkura had a son, Sib\u00f6k\u00f5m\u00f5 or Sib\u00f6k\u00e3m\u00e3, who was a great healer. Once, Sib\u00f6k\u00f5m\u00f5 went to work as an Aw\u00e1 (shaman) in the lower world, that of the S\u00f2rburu, and took with him his niece S\u00ecitami. === First version: Sib\u00f6 as a magic stone === Sib\u00f6k\u00f5m\u00f5, like all aw\u00e1, possessed magical stones called s\u0129\u00e3' or s\u0129\u00f5: three male and one female. One day, one of those male stones (which was Sib\u00fa), the one used to heal, was lost: it was inside S\u00ecitami. Sib\u00f6 did this because he knew that men could not reproduce alone. Thus, Sib\u00f6 was born, and the god thought: \"I am an older person, only in a small body. I hope my mother asks my father for a little ripe banana or a bit of corn dough.\" And S\u00ecitami asked Sib\u00f6k\u00f5m\u00f5 to bring her those things to feed the child. Then Sib\u00f6 thought: \"I wish my mother would tell my father to purify me and build a small ranch near the house.\" So he did, and Sib\u00f6k\u00f5m\u00f5 took care of the boy, and healed him for two nights while he purified him. When S\u00ecitami returned to the house four days later, Sib\u00f6 was able to stand, and by eight days he was already a man. Then, he began to create all things. === Second version: The escape to D\u00ecratuaa L\u00f3ratuaa === When Sib\u00fa was born, a rooster that had never sung began to sing. Then the S\u00f2rburu knew that Sib\u00fa was born, and since they did not want anyone else there, they looked for the boy to kill him. S\u00ecitami realized, and began to look for someone to accompany her to the higher world, which she knew from her trips with Sib\u00f6k\u00f5m\u00f5. Akura, the termite, offered to move them from one place to another by building a tunnel. Thus, the mother and child came to D\u00ecratuaa L\u00f3ratuaa, where the house of the ants is, who hid them. There Sib\u00fa grew up. === Third version: The boy from the river === Once, Sib\u00f6k\u00f5m\u00f5 went fishing with a spear, and found Sib\u00f6 as a baby on the bank of a river. Then, he picked up the boy, took him to his house, and gave him to his wife S\u00ecitami, presenting him as his son. The child was born with a shell (in a skin bag, that is, an amniotic sac), so his father purified it; but the baby did not stop crying, although Sib\u00f6k\u00f5m\u00f5 had already cut her navel and cleaned it of the impurity of the birth . The child did not want to suckle, nor eat or drink water. Then S\u00ecitami ground cacao and put the soft dough in his mouth, which made the baby happy. With only that food Sib\u00f6 grew up and managed to think of all the things in the universe. == Myths about Sib\u00fa == === The war with the S\u00f2rburu === It may be difficult to understand why the S\u00f2rburu would want to kill Sib\u00fa, them being his relatives. However, for the Bribri kinship is transmitted matrilineally, and it was Sib\u00f6komo who was related to the devils. In the legends several reasons for the S\u00f2rburu wanting to kill Sib\u00f6 are mentioned: * They did not want more people in their place. * They were jealous of his power. * They coveted his magical objects. * They hated him because he had created the seeds (dits\u00f6). * They did not want him to create the world. * They did not want him to take away the power. * S\u00f3rkura wanted to be king of men. * They just wanted to kill him. In the version of Sib\u00f6's birth that talks about the flight to D\u00e1turaa L\u00f3ratuaa, it is said that when Sib\u00f6 grew up, he told his father that he wanted to return to the lower world, to meet the S\u00f2rburu and to know why they did not believe it. Sib\u00f6komo then tells him to do it, but be careful, because they wanted to kill him. This is when Sib\u00f6 returns to the lower world. Once there, he found two S\u00f2rburu who were working in their lands. The devils heard a strange sound, wek, wek, wek! and went to see what it was, but they did not find anyone. Hanging over a hearth was a half-cooked gray fox, the food of the S\u00f2rburu. Then Sib\u00f6 came, blew on the fox and revived it; the animal got down and began to sing and play the drum, while Sib\u00f6 accompanied him playing maracas. Seeing this, the two devils left their hiding place and stabbed at Sib\u00f6 with a spear, but he jumped and they could not hurt him. Sib\u00fa's first feat was frightening the S\u00f2rburu by resurrecting a gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) While they fought, the fox again hung over the stove. The S\u00f2rburu were furious, because they believed that this was a bad omen and that they were going to die. So they grabbed the fox, chopped it up and threw it out. This is why the fox is not eaten by the Bribri. After that, Sib\u00f6 spent all his time bothering the devils and making bad omens, collected in humorous tales such as those mentioned below. === The resurrected chicken === One day, Sib\u00f6 was walking, blowing his conch shell and his horn, when he met the S\u00f2rburu. The god made the devils have a vision in which he would grab some chickens, kill them, cook them and serve them for food. The devils had not recognized him, and he sat down, pretending to eat with them. Then, one of the chickens that was already cooked got up and sang three times (which for the devils was a prophecy of death). Sib\u00f6 did this because he knew they wanted to kill him, and he blew on the chicken to make it fly away. === The kidnapping in S\u00f3rkura's house === Another day, Sib\u00fa decided to let himself get caught, so he went to S\u00f3rkura's house, carrying honey, a conch, a horn, his staff, his shield and a skirt of a plant called '. The S\u00f2rburu asked Sib\u00f6 if he was a god, and although he denied it, the S\u00f2rburu caught him and took his possessions. But Sib\u00f6 escaped, and the next day he was transformed into a well-dressed old man. He asked the devils if it was true that they had trapped Sib\u00f6. The devils said yes, and showed him each of the things that the god had been carrying, which the old man tried out. When they reached the place where they had put Sib\u00f6, the god turned into wind and left. === The raid on the house of the S\u00f2rburu === The S\u00f2rburu had in their house some drums, foxes in the form of maracas and some macaws. All of these animals were dead. When the devils were out of the house, Sib\u00f6 entered, resuscitated the animals and together they began to make a lot of noise: the macaws sang, the foxes played the maracas and Sib\u00f6 played the drums. As the S\u00f2rburu were nearby, they returned immediately to try to catch the god, but he had disappeared, and the macaws and foxes were dead and hung over the stove. The next day, Sib\u00f6 arrived pretending to be a visitor, and asked if it was true that the god had been there. The devils said yes, and entrusted him with their plans to kill him. Having learned their plans, Sib\u00f6 let himself be caught another day, and the S\u00f2rburu tied him up and started to shoot him, but in the night the god escaped. === The death of S\u00f3rkura === Sib\u00f6 knew that S\u00f3rkura wanted to kill him, so every time he met him on the way, he became another being, sometimes a hummingbird that was flitting past the S\u00f2rburu. The devil got fed up, and told his relatives that he was going to kill Sib\u00f6, and that when he did he would blow his horn so that they would arrive and celebrate the death of the god. One day Sib\u00f6 found himself face to face with S\u00f3rkura, who threw all his spears at him, never hitting the mark. Sib\u00f6 then took one of those weapons, and on the first shot, he killed his grandfather. Then, the god took the appearance of S\u00f3rkura, and sounded the devil's horn. At once the other S\u00f2rburu arrived, who rejoiced, believing that it was Sib\u00f6 who had died, and convinced by the god, they dismembered and roasted the corpse. Then Sib\u00f6 made himself known, and threw the pieces of S\u00f3rkura into the air, where they were transformed into signs of ill omen. === Creation of the earth === Tapirus bairdii, the only tapir species in Costa Rica Before the creation of human beings, Sib\u00f6 created the sky and the earth, but the earth was only barren rock on which nothing would grow. The Bribri creation myth relates how Sib\u00fa's sister, N\u00e3m\u00e3it\u00e3m\u0129 (also called Tapir), had a daughter named Ir\u00ecria. Sib\u00fa sent Duk\u00far Bulu, a vampire bat, to bite Ir\u00ecria to see if she could become the earth. When Duk\u00far Bulu returned to Sib\u00fa, his excrement began to grow vines and bushes, indicating that Sib\u00fa's plan would work. Sib\u00fa sent the bat a second time to suck the blood of Ir\u00ecria, and again the bat's excrement grew trees. The third time that Sib\u00fa sent Duk\u00far Bulu, the King of Pita (Agave americana) was waiting for him, transformed into a fine thread across the doorway. When Duk\u00far Bulu flew into the room where Ir\u00ecria was sleeping, the thread cut him in two. His top half (with the head and wings) flew back to Sib\u00fa, who wrapped the wound with cotton, blew on it, and advised Duk\u00far Bulu to hang upside-down to heal more quickly. A traditional Bribri palenque. Talamanca, Costa Rica. Sib\u00fa sent his pe\u00f3n (servant) to visit the tapir family and invite them to a festival, but they refused to come until Sib\u00fa came to invite them in person. Sib\u00fa invited Bikakra, Iriria's grandmother, to perform corn and chocolate ceremonies at a festival to inaugurate a great conical house for the clans at Sul\u00e1yum, the center of the world to the Bribri people. He also invited the devils to dance the Sorb\u00f3n dance, since they had helped in the building of the house. At the festival, everyone danced the Sorb\u00f3n. During the fourth dance, Ir\u00ecria fell to the ground and her blood spilled across the floor. All the devils danced on her body and trampled her until she became pure earth. In another myth, Sib\u00fa planned to marry off his sister in exchange for a wife of his own, but she refused. Sib\u00fa sent some of her spirit to earth for the Bribri to hunt. Because of this, the Bribri consider the tapir a sacred animal and only consume it in special rituals. === Creation of Human Beings === Sib\u00f6 had brought seeds of corn from suLa'kaska, The Place of Destiny. The seeds were different colors, which is why the indigenous peoples of Talamanca have different skin tones. Sib\u00f6 kept the corn seeds in a basket, and gave different names to the different seeds, which became the names of clans. Later he divided the seeds into groups, and warned that people should not marry within their own clan. He also taught some to be aw\u00e1pa (shamans), and others to be bik\u00e1kla, sts\u00f6k\u00f6l, and \u00f3kum, the officiants of funeral ceremonies. The Bribri relate that Sib\u00f6 created white people, s\u00edkwa, from the pl\u00e9kek\u00f6L (leafcutter ants). Sib\u00f6 told the people that he would also create white people, called s\u00edkwa, from the pl\u00e9kek\u00f6L (leafcutter ants). Pl\u00e9kek\u00f6L was Sib\u00f6's relative, the King of the Leaf-cutter Ants, and white people originated from him. Sib\u00f6 created indigenous people at night, but created white people during the day. Some Bribri say that this is why white people are \"more scientific\", because Sib\u00f6 taught them different things than the indigenous people. However, like the leafcutter ants, the white people cut down and destroy everything in their path, leaving no vegetation behind. ==== The UsekLa Clan ==== In ancient times, all of Sib\u00f6's relatives were allowed to eat Sib\u00f6's possessions on Earth, including the indigenous people. To protect his people, Sib\u00f6 gave them the UsekLa clan, celestial beings from another world, not made from corn like the other people. Sib\u00f6 gave them magic stones to cure illnesses, and they fought against the Owners of diseases, plagues, hunger, and storms. The Bribri say that they were unable to defeat the Owners of the flu, measles, and the common cold, however, explaining why so many indigenous peoples died from introduced diseases after the Columbian exchange. The only ones allowed to interact with the UsekLa were men of the royal Salkwak clan, who acted as intermediaries between the UsekLa and the rest of the people. === Creation of the Siak\u00f6Ldi === The Bribri people of the K\u00e9k\u00f6ldi reserve in Talamanca relate a story about the creation of the Siak\u00f6ldi, a branch of the K\u00e9k\u00f6ldi River: When Sib\u00fa was walking by the creek, carrying cassava dough to make chicha, he became tired. He used the water of the creek to wet the dough and make chicha to refresh himself. He threw the cassava pulp into the creek, where it turned into sacred white stones called s\u0129\u00e3'. Mount Chirrip\u00f3, the highest mountain in Costa Rica (3,821 m), is considered the home of Sib\u00fa by the Bribri. == References == == Sources == * == Further reading == * Category:Central American mythology Category:Creator deities Category:Wisdom gods Category:Costa Rican folklore Category:Trickster gods Category:Talamancan mythology ",
