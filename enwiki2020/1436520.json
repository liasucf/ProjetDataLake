    "text": "Tamias is a genus of chipmunks within the tribe Marmotini of the squirrel family. It includes a single living species, the Eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus)Musser et al., 2010, p. 22 The genus name Tamias () means \"treasurer\", \"steward\", or \"housekeeper\", which is a reference to the animals' role in plant dispersal through their habit of collecting and storing food for winter use. The genus Tamias may include all chipmunk species in three genera: Tamias, the eastern chipmunk and other fossil species; Eutamias, of which the Siberian chipmunk (E. sibiricus) is the only living member; and Neotamias, which includes the 23 remaining, mostly western, species. These classifications are arbitrary, and most taxonomies over the twentieth century have placed the chipmunks in a single genus. However, studies of mitochondrial DNA show that the divergence between each of the three chipmunk groups is comparable to the genetic dissimilarity between Marmota and Spermophilus., so each of the three genera have been split. In addition to the Eastern chipmunk, some fossil species from Eurasia have been assigned to this genus: *Tamias aristus (Ray, 1965) \u2013 late Pleistocene *Tamias allobrogensis Mein and Ginsburg, 2002 \u2013 Miocene of FranceMein and Ginsburg, 2002 *Tamias atsali De Bruijn, 1995 \u2013 Pliocene of GreeceDe Bruijn, 1995 *Tamias eviensis De Bruijn et al., 1980 \u2013 Miocene of GreeceDoukas, 2003, table 2 Tamias urialis Munthe, 1980, described from the Miocene of Pakistan, may be more closely related to Tamiops.Qiu et al., 2008, p. 115 ==References== Category:Rodent genera Category:Extant Miocene first appearances Category:Taxa named by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger ",
