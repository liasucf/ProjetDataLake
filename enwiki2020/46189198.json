    "text": "The 2015 City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council election took place on 7 May 2015. This was on the same day as other local elections and a general election. One councillor was elected in each ward for a four-year term so the councillors elected in 2015 last stood for election in 2011. Each ward is represented by three councillors, the election of which is staggered, so only one third of the councillors were elected in this election. Labour retained overall control of the council. Map of the results of the 2015 Bradford council election. Labour in red, Conservatives in blue, Liberal Democrats in yellow and Greens in green. ==Election Result== Of the Council's 90 seats, 30 were up for election. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! valign=centre colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 230px\"|Party ! valign=top style=\"width: 30px\"|Previous council ! valign=top style=\"width: 30px\"|New council |- | 46 | 46 |- | 21 | 23 |- | 8 | 9 |- | 10 | 8 |- | 3 | 3 |- | 2 | 1 |- ! colspan=2| Total ! style=\"text-align: center\"| 90 ! colspan=3| 90 |- ! colspan=2| Working majority ! ! |} ==Ward results== The electoral division results listed below are based on the changes from the last time this third was up for election, in the 2011 elections, not taking into account any mid-term by-elections or party defections.
