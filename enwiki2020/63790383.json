    "text": "Follow the Sun is an American television adventure series that aired on ABC from September 17, 1961 to April 8, 1962. The episodes follow a pair of freelance magazine writers based in Hawaii who seek out interesting stories while leading an active social life both on the mainland and aboard their boat, The Scuber. The series is characterized by a host of guest appearances by popular film and television actors. Dell Comics issued a contemporaneous series of comic books based on the show in 1961 and 1962. ==Production== The series was co-produced by Roy Huggins and Marion Hargrove at 20th Century Fox. The plotline was designed as a follow-up to Hong Kong, which Huggins had lately produced, \"with two freelance journalists based in Honolulu encountering mystery and their fair share of beautiful women in their weekly Hawaiian adventures\". Hargrove left the project after the fifth episode and Huggins reworked the cast list, downgrading Gary Lockwood from one of the reporters to a scout, and upgrading Brett Halsey to the journalist position. Huggins also began alternating the episodes to star one or the other of the two lead characters. ==Regular cast== Barry Coe with guest star Jayne Mansfield in 1962 Gary Lockwood with guest star Leslie Parrish in 1962 *Barry Coe as Ben Gregory *Brett Halsey as Paul Templin *Gary Lockwood as Eric Jason *Gigi Perreau as Katherine Ann Richards *Jay Lanin as Lt.
