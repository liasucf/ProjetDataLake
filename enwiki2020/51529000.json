    "text": "The Housing (Scotland) Act 2014 is an Act of the Scottish Parliament which received royal assent on 1 August 2014. ==Part 1: Abolition of the Right to Buy== Part 1 of the Act provides for the abolition of the right to buy policy which allowed secure tenants of councils and some housing associations the legal right to buy, at a large discount, the home they are living in. This took effect on 1 August 2016, allowing for two years in which existing council tenants could decide whether they wished to buy their home. The policy marked a significant divergence from that undertaken in England and Wales, with the UK Government legislating to extend right to buy to tenants in housing associations. ==Part 3: Short Scottish Secure Tenancies and Antisocial Behaviour Powers== The Act simplifies the eviction process in cases involving antisocial behaviour by allowing social landlords to make use of an existing conviction as grounds for possession. The Act clarifies that a social landlord can suspend an application for social housing under the following circumstances: * There is evidence that the applicant, a member of their household or a visitor has been engaged in antisocial behaviour in or near their home or towards the landlord\u2019s staff; * The applicant has previously been evicted by a court order; * The applicant has lost a previous tenancy through abandonment; * The applicant has been evicted under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 for damage to the home or its contents; * The applicant has outstanding rent arrears and there is no arrangement in place; * The applicant has previously provided false information to obtain a tenancy; * The applicant has unreasonably refused the offer of one or more homes. ==Assignation and Sub-letting== The Act specifies that any person seeking assignation, subletting or joint tenancy of a social rented home, must have been living in that home as their main residence for a period of at least 12 months prior to the application, as opposed to six months. ==Improving Standards in Rented Accommodation== The Act introduces new requirements for private landlords to provide carbon monoxide detectors and have electrical fixtures, fittings and appliances tested for safety every five years. ==References== Category:Acts of the Scottish Parliament 2014 Category:Housing legislation in the United Kingdom Category:Housing in Scotland ",
