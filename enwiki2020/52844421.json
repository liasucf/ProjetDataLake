    "text": "The Brittain River is a river of the Sunshine Coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It originates in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains, and flows about southeast to the Pacific Ocean at the Princess Royal Reach of Jervis Inlet.Length calculated in Google Earth using the path tool. The Brittain River is part of the traditional territory of the Shishalh (or Sechelt) people. The river is named for Rowland Brittain, British Columbia's first patent attorney and owned land at the river's mouth in 1901\u20131902. Its Shishalh name is slh\u00edlhem. The Shishalh consider the entire Brittain River watershed of extremely high cultural and spiritual value and home to numerous cultural resources and ceremonial, spiritual, legendary, and oral history sites. In addition the river valley was a traditional travel route to Powell River. ==Course== The Brittain River originates at Arctic Lake in the Pacific Ranges. It flows east through Doris Lake then turns south. It flows through a forested, mountainous, glaciated U-shaped valley to Jervis Inlet. Its mouth is about northeast of the city of Powell River. About upstream from its mouth a waterfall, approximately 10\u201315 m high, blocks fish migration. ==Natural history== Historically the Brittain River supported anadromous salmon and trout in its lower , and non-anadromous trout and char in its upper reaches. Anadromous fish populations include coho, Chinook, chum, and pink salmon, as well as steelhead and cutthroat trout. Non-anadromous fish include cutthroat and Dolly Varden. The river's watershed has a long history of heavy logging with associated wildfires, along with mineral exploration. This has significantly altered the aquatic habitats of the lower Brittain River. The Shishalh consider the river a good candidate for fishery and wildlife rehabilitation. ==See also== * List of British Columbia rivers ==References== Category:Rivers of British Columbia Category:Rivers of the Pacific Ranges ",
