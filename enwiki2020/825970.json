That year she represented Maryland in the Miss USA 1980 pageant broadcast live from Biloxi, Mississippi, and placed in the top twelve. She placed sixth after the preliminary round of competition, and went on to place eighth in the final swimsuit competition, seventh in interview and sixth in evening gown, and finished seventh overall. Walker's first acting role was in Liar's Moon with Matt Dillon. She began her daytime career as Lizbeth Bachman on the television serial Capitol when it premiered in 1982, playing a sophisticated heiress torn between playboy Jordy Clegg and handicapped doctor Thomas McCandless. After a two-year run, Walker left the series in 1984 to pursue other projects. Walker returned to daytime as mob princess Olivia St. John on the serial General Hospital from 1988 to 1990, notoriously sleeping with Duke Lavery and stalking his family, much like Glenn Close's character Alex Forrest had done in the 1987 movie Fatal Attraction. After leaving General Hospital, she played Alex Olanov Hesser Buchanan Buchanan on One Life to Live from 1990 to 1997 and returned for some visits in 2001 and 2002.

Walker also had a recurring role as Marie Green on Guiding Light from 2003 to 2004, being reunited with Marj Dusay, whom she had appeared with on Capitol. Afterwards, she had a recurring role as D.A. Grace Nancier on Passions, a character obviously based upon Nancy Grace whom she slightly resembled.
