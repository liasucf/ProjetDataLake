So Nisha meets Neelima's grandmother at a swimming pool Raja and Neelima are there too because Raja's friend was going to meet them there. They see Nisha they are just about to go to her table when they meet Raja's friend. Nisha rushes home. Ambar and Nikita have just come home from shopping buying everyone gifts and Gunjan (Raja's Younger sister) wears western clothing but everyone except Neelima laughs. Neelima make Gunjan happy. The only reason Gunjan wants to be like Nikita is because Ambar likes Nikita but Gunjan likes him and Ambar hates her. Then Gunjan curls her hair and wears western when Fatima Bi starts yelling at her but Neelima tells Fatima Bi that every girl wants to do all this so let her and Neelima gives her a makeup set. Nisha is watching everything. Nisha calls Nikita she's at a club with Ambar and Nikita is just faking to love Ambar. They eventually leave after Neelima finds out Nikki was working with Aryan to get information on the family. Amber and Gunjan one night slept together which resulted in Gunjan becoming pregnant. At this point in the story, Raja Amber and Nandini's father has come back into the picture after a long absence. He instigates Amber into hating Gunjan. After everyone in the family discovers what happened between the two of them, Raja gets Amber and Gunjan married. But Amber vows to Gunjan that he will never love her. As time goes on, he still won't come close to Gunjan and she is unhappy but won't say anything because she knows it will hurt the family. After a failed attempt at marriage again, Nandini is now married to her friend Prince. Nobody was happy at first about this secret wedding, but than everyone deals with it and eventually become okay with it. Meanwhile Price's older sister, Kadambari, is only interested in the fact that Nandini comes from a wealthy family; and so she wants Balraj's money. She makes side comments to Nandini saying how they are poor and how she doesn't have any money so she can make Nandini feel bad. Kadambari burned down her own house so she could go live with Raja and live the life of a rich woman. No matter how much she tries, Kadambari still doesn't get what she wants. Nandini and her in-laws are still living with Raja and has said they will stay there permanently. Neelima is now pregnant and Raja is adamant on giving their first born to Nandini who was left barren from an accident. Nandini keeps telling Raja she does not want to have their child because she knows Neelima does not want to give her child up. This issue is creating a big problem in the house until we find out Nandini is \"pregnant\". Everyone in the family is so happy because three children will be born in their house. Before Nandini announces she is \"pregnant\" she had discussed the option of surrogacy with Prince who was against the idea. Nandini had said that was the only way to keep the family happy and to stop Raja from giving his child to her. Nandini couldn't find a surrogate right away so she announces that she is pregnant. Although everyone thinks it is a miracle, the truth is she lied to she could have some time to find a surrogate. No one knows this except Prince. Now Nellima is in a coma after fighting over something. A five-year leap happens Pari Nelima's daughter thinks that Nandini is her mother and Prince is her father. BR says he will meet Neelima and comes home. Everyone else leaves. BR tells Neelima that he is in a dilemma, since Prince is getting such a big opportunity and on the other hand Pari and Nandini will have to go with him. What should he do? He gets a flash where Neelima had told him that she would want her child to get the love of both her parents. BR comes back to see Nandini feeding pari, how she takes care of her. BR is in his room and thinks how will he separate from Nandini as well. We see that Nandini and prince are packing, and then they meet everyone and leave for Dubai. Pari come and asks BR where they are going. BR says Dubai, Pari runs after Nandini and Prince who are in the car. BR follows. Pari has an accident. BR comes out of the nightmare.
