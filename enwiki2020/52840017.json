    "text": "Callum Anthony Guy (born 25 November 1996) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for EFL League Two club Carlisle United. He started his career at Derby County, before playing on loan at Port Vale during the 2016\u201317 season, and joined Bradford City on loan in January 2018. In August 2018, he joined Blackpool in a deal which was made permanent in January 2019. He left Blackpool for Carlisle United in January 2020. ==Career== ===Derby County=== Guy came through the Derby County youth team from the age of nine to turn professional at the club in February 2015. He played all three Group Stage games for the under-23 team in the EFL Trophy during the 2016\u201317 season. He joined EFL League One club Port Vale on a half- season loan on 11 January 2017. Nine days later he was named as man of the match on his first team debut for Port Vale in a 2\u20132 draw with Bury at Vale Park; his performance also saw him named in the Football League Paper's team of the week. Manager Michael Brown said, \"I thought he mixed his game up well - short and long passes, broke it up, forward runs, wanting to do well\". He was again named as Vale's man of the match after a shortage of defenders saw him play at right-back in a 2\u20131 home defeat to Bradford City on 25 February. However, he picked up a hamstring injury in mid-March, and was ruled out for the rest of the season. Guy made his Derby debut on 12 September 2017, in a 3\u20132 defeat at Barnsley in the EFL Cup. On 12 January 2018, he returned to League One on loan at Bradford City on loan until the end of the 2017\u201318 season. \"Bantams\" boss Stuart McCall said that \"[he will] give us a little bit extra depth. He is hungry enough, however, to want to push himself into the starting XI\". It took until his tenth appearance for Bradford for him to be on the winning side, when he was named as man of the match during a 1\u20130 victory over Gillingham. ===Blackpool=== On 31 August 2018, Guy joined League One side Blackpool on a loan deal until the end of 2018, with the deal due to be made permanent in January 2019, at which point he would sign an 18-month contract with the option of a further 12 months on top of that. He scored on his Seasiders debut with a 25-yard volley in a 3\u20133 draw with Macclesfield Town in an EFL Trophy group stage game on 4 September. The permanent deal was confirmed on 2 January. He ended the 2018\u201319 season with 24 appearances to his name. On 27 November 2019, he was sent off after receiving two bookings in a 3\u20131 defeat to Scunthorpe United at Bloomfield Road. ===Carlisle United=== On 30 January 2020, Guy signed an 18-month deal with EFL League Two side Carlisle United after moving for an undisclosed fee. Carlisle head coach Chris Beech told the club website that Guy was a \"marquee signing\". However he picked up a knee injury in his third appearance for the \"Blues\" and was ruled out of action for the rest of the 2019\u201320 season after undergoing surgery. ==Style of play== Guy is an energetic 'box-to-box' midfielder. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|EFL Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Derby County |2014\u201315||EFL Championship||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2015\u201316||EFL Championship||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2016\u201317||EFL Championship||0||0||0||0||0||0||3||0||3||0 |- |2017\u201318||EFL Championship||0||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2018\u201319||EFL Championship||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!3!!0!!4!!0 |- |Port Vale (loan) |2016\u201317||EFL League One||11||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||11||0 |- |Bradford City (loan) |2017\u201318||EFL League One||17||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||17||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Blackpool |2018\u201319 |EFL League One |16||0||3||0||2||0||3||1||24||1 |- |2019\u201320 |EFL League One |15||0||3||0||0||0||4||0||22||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !31!!0!!6!!0!!2!!0!!7!!1!!46!!1 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Carlisle United |2019\u201320 |EFL League Two |3||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||3||0 |- |2020\u201321 |EFL League Two |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !3!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!3!!0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !62!!0!!6!!0!!3!!0!!10!!1!!81!!1 |} ==References== Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Nottingham Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Bradford City A.F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Carlisle United F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
