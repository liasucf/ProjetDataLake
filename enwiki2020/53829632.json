The service at Marshfield was always modest, with just three trains per day in 1869. Relief lines at Marshfield were completed in stages between 1896 and 1898. The station had 13 to 14 employees in the 1930s. Marshfield had two platforms, each with a brick building. The buildings had wooden awnings to provide shelter. There was a 39-lever signal box which opened in 1897 and closed in 1963.Mitchell, V. and Smith, K. Gloucester to Cardiff.
