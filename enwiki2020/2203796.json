    "text": "Tiziano Ferro (; born 21 February 1980) is an Italian singer, Grammy Award winning, songwriter, producer and author. He broke through in 2001 with his international hit single \"Perdono\" and has remained commercially successful since then, in several countries. Ferro has released a Spanish version of each of his albums, and has also sung in English, Portuguese, and French. Known as the modern face of Italian pop music, he frequently writes songs for other artists and has produced albums for Giusy Ferreri, Alessandra Amoroso and Baby K. Aside from his success as an artist, Ferro is well known for his personal struggles. Having been overweight as a teenager, he has been outspoken about his battles with food addiction and eating disorders. In October 2010, at the height of his fame, Ferro came out as gay, having himself struggled with depression related to self-acceptance about his homosexuality. Ferro is currently one of the best-selling artists in Italy. Both his third album Nessuno \u00e8 solo and fourth album Alla mia et\u00e0 were certified diamond. Despite his fears, his coming out did not negatively affect his career, as fifth album L'amore \u00e8 una cosa semplice was the best-selling album of 2012 in Italy, and his first greatest hits album was supported by a stadium tour. As of 2015, Ferro has sold over 15 million records worldwide.http://www.sanremonews.it/2015/02/09/leggi- notizia/argomenti/festival-di-sanremo/articolo/a-sanremo-arriva-il-maxi- cartiglio-lungo-200-metri-dei-mitici-baci-perugina.html ==Biography== ===Childhood and early beginnings=== Ferro's interest in music was born when he received a toy keyboard as a present, which was used to compose his first songs when he was seven. He later started taking guitar and piano classes at a local conservatory of music. When he was 16 years old, he joined a gospel choir and during the same years, he started performing in piano bars and karaoke contests. In 1997, Ferro participated in the \"Accademia della Canzone di Sanremo\", a music contest created with the purpose to choose the contestants of the Sanremo Music Festival, but was eliminated during the first stage of the competition. The following year, Ferro participated again in the same contest, and despite being chosen as one of the 12 finalists, he did not make it to win the competition. However, during the selections, Ferro met music producers Alberto Salerno and Mara Maionchi, and started to collaborate with them. In 1999 Ferro also toured throughout Italy as a back vocalist with the Italian hip hop band Sottotono. ===Career breakthrough=== In 2001, Ferro signed a contract with EMI Music Italy. On 22 June 2001, he released his first single, \"Xdono\". During the first months after the release, the song received a poor reception, but it later became a hit and, after topping the Italian Singles Chart in September 2001, it was certified double platinum by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry for sales exceeding 100,000 copies. The song was included in Ferro's debut album, Rosso Relativo, released on 26 October 2001. Following the commercial success obtained in Italy, in 2002 the album was released in several European countries. A Spanish-language version of the record, titled Rojo Relativo, was also released in Spain and Latin America. Rosso Relativo obtained success in different markets throughout its various editions and had sold more than 1,000,000 copies worldwide by 2004, according to EMI Music. The album also allowed Ferro to receive a nomination for Best New Artist at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2003. ===Second studio album, 111=== In November 2003, Ferro released his second studio album, 111, recorded both in Italian and Spanish, produced by Alberto Salerno, Mara Maionchi and Michele Canova. The album was preceded by the release of \"Xverso\" / \"Perverso\", and also spawned the singles \"Sere nere\" / \"Tardes negras\", \"Non me lo so spiegare\" / \"No me lo puedo explicar\" and \"Ti voglio bene\" / \"Desde ma\u00f1ana no lo s\u00e9\". 111 has sold more than 1,000,000 copies worldwide, topping the Mexican Albums Chart and being certified four times platinum in Italy for domestic sales exceeding 450,000 copies. Following the success of the album Ferro won Best Italian Artist at the 2004 MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome. In July 2004, Ferro also released in Europe his first English-language single, \"Universal Prayer\", a duet with British R&B; singer Jamelia recorded to promote the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. Ferro lived in Mexico during these years, first in Cuernavaca and later in Puebla. He studied Spanish there at a university, eventually graduating in August 2005, before relocating to Manchester. ===Nessuno \u00e8 solo / Nadie est\u00e1 solo, the third studio album=== Ferro's third studio album, Nessuno \u00e8 solo / Nadie est\u00e1 solo, was released in June 2006, following the lead single \"Stop! Dimentica\", which became a number- one hit in Italy and Austria. The album, described by music critics as more intimate and melancholic, obtained in Italy a success even bigger than his previous ones, reaching the diamond certification for its domestic sales. The third single from the album, \"Ti scatter\u00f2 una foto\", was included in the soundtrack of the movie Ho voglia di te, directed by Luis Prieto and based on the book with the same title by Federico Moccia. Nessuno \u00e8 solo also features a duet with Italian pop singer-songwriter Biagio Antonacci, while the Spanish- language version of the album includes \"Mi credo\", a song recorded with Pepe Aguilar. ===Alla mia et\u00e0 / A mi edad=== In June 2008 Ferro co-wrote with Roberto Casalino the single \"Non ti scordar mai di me\" for X Factor Italy's first edition's runner-up Giusy Ferreri. The song became a huge success in Italy, topping the Italian Singles Chart for 12 non-consecutive weeks. Ferro also produced Giusy Ferreri's debut album, Gaetana, containing 6 songs penned by him, including \"L'amore e basta!\", a duet between Ferro and Ferreri. On 7 November 2008 Ferro released his fourth studio album, Alla mia et\u00e0 / A mi edad, preceded by the single with the same title. Alla mia et\u00e0 debuted at number one on the Italian Albums Chart and became the best-selling album of 2009 in Italy, also achieving his second diamond certification. The album contains a duet with singer-songwriter Franco Battiato, and \"Breathe Gentle\", the English version of third single \"Indietro\", features Kelly Rowland. Other collaborators to the project included Italian songstress Laura Pausini, Anah\u00ed and Dulce Mar\u00eda of Mexican pop group RBD and Amaia Montero. In November 2009, Ferro released his first video album, Alla mia et\u00e0 \u2013 Live in Rome, recorded during his concerts at the Stadio Olimpico on 24 and 25 June 2009. A few months later, Ferro was chosen to write and record the Italian version of Mary J.

The album was released on 28 November 2011 and spent five weeks on top of the Italian Albums Chart. All seven singles were certified gold or higher in the country. The album itself was certified eight times platinum and became the best-selling album of 2012. During the spring and summer of 2012, Ferro embarked on a largely domestic concert tour, with additional stops in Switzerland, Belgium and Monaco. The tour's highlight was Ferro's first full stadium concert at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. This sold-out concert was attended by 50,000 fans. In 2012 Tiziano wrote the song Per Te, sung by Andrea Bocelli and contained in the album of the world-famous jazz player Chris Botti, which will earn him a Grammy Award as Best Pop Instrumental Album. In 2013 Ferro opted to focus on collaborating with other artists. Italian female hip hop artist Baby K released her debut album Una seria in March, which was produced by Ferro together with Michele Canova. Ferro featured on first single \"Killer\", which peaked at No. 10 on the Italian Singles Chart and was certified platinum. He also featured on the album's third single, \"Sei sola\". In September Alessandra Amoroso released Amore puro, another album produced by Ferro and Canova. This album achieved a double platinum certification. Four of its five singles were written by Ferro. ===TZN - The Best of Tiziano Ferro=== Ferro released his first greatest hits album TZN - The Best of Tiziano Ferro in November 2014. Both the lead single \"Senza scappare mai pi\u00f9\" and the second single \"Incanto\" reached the top five in Italy and were certified platinum.
