At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on seven reviews. David Jeffries of AllMusic said, \"Gimmicks abound on this dark carnival of an album, and if you can't hang with some murder talk and misogyny, it's best to stay away, but this fat, epic effort is still a swift thrill ride and doesn't bore despite its size.\" Nathan S. of DJBooth said, \"6's & 7's is a hard album to deliver a final verdict. It's an album that was made for a very specific group, everyone else be damned, and so while I honestly can't say I'm a full fledged Techaholic, I do have to acknowledge that for many this album will be nothing short of epic.\" Andres Vasquez of HipHopDX stated \"All 6's and 7's doesn't disappoint as a well-balanced offering.\" Steve Juon of RapReviews.com said, \"Tech has done everything in his power to reach out to the broadest fan base on All 6's and 7's by keeping it real and giving you something you can feel at the same time.\" Mosi Reeves of Spin said, \"All 6's and 7's is an admirable attempt at balancing Tech's heavy-metal rep and hard-won maturity.\" Adam Fleischer of XXL said, \"The album is the first test of Tech's ability to balance his new industry connections with the distinct style that his Technicians have become accustomed to over the years. Luckily, he reaches that marker without any real stumbles along the way.\" ==Commercial performance== All 6's and 7's debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 with 56,000 copies sold in its first week. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2011) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2011) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) | 49 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2012) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) | 88 |} ==References== ==External links== * Official Website Category:Tech N9ne albums Category:2011 albums Category:Albums produced by B.o.B Category:Albums produced by J.U.S.T.I.C.E.
