    "text": "+'Justments (pronounced: add justments) is the third studio album by American soul singer-songwriter and producer Bill Withers, released in 1974 by Sussex Records. It contains the hit single, \"The Same Love That Made Me Laugh\" (US #50, Canada #39), which charted during the spring of 1974. It was covered in 1977 by Diana Ross on her LP Baby It's Me. ==Reception== Legal tussles between Withers and Sussex prevented further recording sessions until Columbia signed the singer a year later. Columbia bought Withers' back catalog, re-releasing his earlier hit records, but +'Justments was not reissued on CD until 2010. The album cover shows Withers writing the following explanation of the title: \"Life like most precious gifts gives us the responsibility of upkeep. We are given the responsibility of arranging our own spaces to best benefit our survival. We have the choice of believing or not believing in things like God, friendship, marriage, love, lust or any number of simple but complicated things. We will make some mistakes both in judgement and in fact. We will help some situations and hurt some situations. We will help some people and hurt some people and be left to live with it either way. We must then make some adjustments, or as the old people back home would call them, + 'JUSTMENTS.\" \"Can We Pretend\" features Jos\u00e9 Feliciano on guitar, and he is featured on congas on \"Railroad Man\". Withers was a guest musician and composer on the 1973 Feliciano album Compartments. ==Track listing== == Personnel == * Bill Withers \u2013 lead and backing vocals, guitar (2, 9), acoustic piano (4), electric piano (5, 6, 9) * Benorce Blackmon \u2013 guitar (1) * Jos\u00e9 Feliciano \u2013 guitar (7), congas (10) * Ray Jackson \u2013 electric piano (1, 2) * John Barnes \u2013 acoustic piano (1, 3), electric piano (4) * John Myles \u2013 electric piano (7, 8, 10), clavinet (10), string arrangements * Melvin Dunlap \u2013 bass (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10) * James Gadson \u2013 drums (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10) * Chip Steen \u2013 congas (5, 10) * Dorothy Ashby \u2013 harp (2, 3, 4, 7) === Production === * Bill Withers \u2013 producer * Melvin Dunlap \u2013 producer * James Gadson \u2013 producer * Phil Schier \u2013 engineer * Bobby Thomas \u2013 engineer * Carl Overr \u2013 art direction * John Van Hamersveld \u2013 design * Norman Seeff \u2013 photography ;Studios * Recorded at Record Plant (Los Angeles, CA) and Dijobe Sound (Orange, CA). * Mastered at Artisan Sound Recorders (Hollywood, CA). ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
