From 1950 one length was equal to 0.08 of one second. == Competition Report== Northern King trained by Jack Harvey was installed as ante-post favourite for the 1957 Derby after enjoying a good season previously. The Pall Mall Stakes and newly crowned Gold Collar champion Silent Worship was second on the ante-post list with Puppy Derby Champion Ford Spartan third. Jack McAllister the owner of 1956 champion Dunmore King, sent over Irish entry Scoutbush. A second entry from McAllister was a greyhound called Ricardus and he was put with trainer Paddy McEvoy. Oaks champion First But Last and Grand Prix champion Land of Song were two more leading entries. Kilcaskin Kern a recent track record holder at Cork Greyhound Stadium decided to stay in Ireland. Before the first nights heats got underway Silent Worship was found to be lame which led to his owners selling him shortly afterwards. The first round provided another surprise when Moyne Rosette beat Northern King in a slow time of 29.45 sec. Ford Spartan impressed recording 28.74 to become the new favourite. Scoutbush who had been purchased by new owners after the first round went out during the next stage but Northern King returned to form with a win and there were successes for First But Last and Ford Spartan. In the semi- finals Quare Fool claimed the first heat leading all the way, Highwood Sovereign and Land of Song also progressed to make the final, leaving strong favourite Northern King fading into last place after encountering a bump at the start. The second heat saw Ford Spartan backed to 2-7f leading throughout and holding off the strong finishing Highway Tim. In the final the first to show was Land of Song but he was soon caught at the first bend by Ford Spartan, who then showed good early pace to take a clear lead. From the fourth bend Highway Tim put in a burst of speed that forced the stewards to call for a photo finish but Ford Spartan had held on to claim the title. ==See Also== 1957 UK & Ireland Greyhound Racing Year == References== Greyhound Derby English Greyhound Derby English Greyhound Derby Category:English Greyhound Derby ",
