In the southeast, another series of mountain ranges separate it from the Dzungarian Basin (Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert).

Lake Alakol and Lake Sasykkol, situated in the western (Kazakhstan) part of the valley, are the homes of the rare Dalmatian pelican and relict gull. == See also == *Eurasian Steppe *Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands == External links == * * Category:Valleys of Xinjiang Category:Valleys of Kazakhstan Category:Eurasian Steppe Category:Ecoregions of China Category:Ecoregions of Kazakhstan Category:Ecoregions of Asia Category:Grasslands of China Category:Grasslands of Kazakhstan Category:Palearctic ecoregions Category:Temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands ",
