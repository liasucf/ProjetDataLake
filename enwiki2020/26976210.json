Before the formation of Rang\u00e1r\u00feing eystra in 2002, Flj\u00f3tshl\u00ed\u00f0 was its own municipality called Flj\u00f3tshl\u00ed\u00f0arhreppur. Flj\u00f3t (genitive case: flj\u00f3ts) means \"river\", and hl\u00ed\u00f0 (genitive: hl\u00ed\u00f0ar) means \"slope\". Flj\u00f3tshl\u00ed\u00f0 lies to the east of Hvolsv\u00f6llur and north of the Markarflj\u00f3t river. Gunnar H\u00e1mundarson lived in the area in the 10th century. Other notable inhabitants include T\u00f3mas S\u00e6mundsson, editor of Fj\u00f6lnir, artist N\u00edna S\u00e6mundsson and poet \u00deorsteinn Erlingsson. Flj\u00f3tshl\u00ed\u00f0 was evacuated as a result of the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. Flj\u00f3tshl\u00ed\u00f0 is also where the band Retro Stefson shot a video for the 'Inspired by Iceland' concert series. == References == Category:Southern Region (Iceland) Category:Populated places in Southern Region (Iceland) ",
