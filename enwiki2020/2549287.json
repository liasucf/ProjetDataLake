    "text": "The Cordoba Fighting Dog is an extinct breed of fighting dog. The Cordoba was a crossbreed of the Boxer, Bulldog, Bull Terrier, and the English Mastiff. The Dogo Argentino is directly derived from this breed. ==History== The Cordoba Fighting Dog originated in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina. It was noted for its willingness to fight to the death and its high pain tolerance. In addition, many members of this breed died in the dog fighting pits, contributing to the breed's extinction. The Cordoba was capable of hunting in a small pack of a male and female; otherwise it was likely to turn on its packmates. In the 1920s, breeders developed the Dogo Argentino by crossing the Cordoba Fighting Dog with other breeds such as the Great Dane, Great Pyrenees, Bulldog, Bull Terrier and Dogue de Bordeaux. ==See also== * List of dog fighting breeds * List of extinct dog breeds ==References== Category:Extinct dog breeds Category:Catch dog breeds Category:Dog fighting breeds Category:Dog breeds originating in Argentina ",
