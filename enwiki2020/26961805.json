It is situated on the Great Divide with views to the east of the Lockyer Valley through to Brisbane and to the west across the Darling Downs. Traditionally the area has been used for farming however in recent years the expansion of the Toowoomba Regional Council has led to acreage and other residential development. ==History== In the 1860s to 1883 the area was called Five-Mile Camp. The name Cabarlah was used after Crows Nest railway line (from Toowoomba to Crows Nest) was built. It is thought that the name Cabarlah derived from an Aboriginal expression describing the ring- tailed possum. However, a 1930 newspaper article claims it is a \u201cNative name of the mountains in the neighbourhood\u201d. The Queensland Government set aside land for the Geham Cemetery (now the Cabarlah Cemetery) on 11 September 1878. Trustees were appointed on 2 January 1880 with the first burials occurring in 1881. Cabarlah Post Office opened on 1 July 1927 (a receiving office had been open from 1884). The Cabarlah Community School opened in Wirraglen Road, Highfields, in January 2006. It used the Reggio Emilia teaching philosophy. In March 2008 it was closed when the Queensland Government's Non-State Schools Accreditation Board refused to accredit the school, claiming it did not meet the requirements of the Education (Accreditation of Non-State Schools) Act 2001. Although the school appealed the decision, the Queensland Education Minister, Rod Weldford, upheld the board's decision. === Military history === The Borneo Barracks are west of the New England Highway at Cabarlah ().
