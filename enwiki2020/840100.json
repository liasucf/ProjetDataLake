    "text": "JT Group Limited (doing business as JT) is the parent company of several subsidiaries including Jersey Telecom Limited and Wave Telecom Limited. Jersey Telecom is the former monopoly operator in the Bailiwick of Jersey. JT provides telecommunications, Internet access and other services, mostly within the Channel Islands. ==History== The arms on the Minden Place exchange, dated 1933 In 1972 legislation passed in Jersey, which led the States of Jersey to take over the country\u2019s telephone exchanges from the British Post Office. A state monopoly was formed through the Telecommunications Board in 1973,http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/scrutinyreviewresearches/2006/567-37054-2692006.pdf and remained under state control until 2003, when the market was opened to competition. In 2002 JT was granted licences by the Office of Utility Regulation to operate fixed and mobile telecommunications services to, from and within the Bailiwick of Guernsey and was known as Wave Telecom.https://www.gov.je/ImportedNewsObject/JTGroupLimitedproposedsaleP28_2007.pdf The following year in 2003, Jersey Telecom became a private company, though it remained under 100% ownership by the States. In 2006 the States of Jersey Council of Ministers proposed the sale of JT Limited. In 2008, following comments in the Scrutiny report and market uncertainty, the Minister for Treasury and Resources decided to withdraw the proposition.http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/scrutinyreports/2008/report%20-%20jersey%20telecom%20privatisation%20supplementary%20report%20-%2029%20january%202008.pdf In November 2006 JT then announced that it was to install a new high capacity optical submarine cable from Dartmouth to L'Ancresse Bay on the north west tip of Guernsey. In 2009 Graeme Millar, formerly Chief Commercial Officer of Mobile TeleSystems, the Russian mobile operator, became the CEO of JT. In April 2010 JT relaunched its Next Generation Networking (NGN) programme which had run into technical difficulties the previous autumn. In September 2011, Jersey Telecom changed its name to JT. The following year, in 2012, JT acquired Worldstone.https://guernseypress.com/news/business/2012/08/03/jt- group-buys-global-voice-and-data-provider-worldstone/ In September 2014, JT began work on a \u00a312m 4G network in Jersey. The first masts went live in February 2015 and full Island coverage was reached three months later. On 28 March 2014 JT partnered with Fon and the service became available to JT broadband subscribers connected to fibre in 2016. ===Digital sandbox=== In 2018 JT began partnering with Sony in order to test its newly developed Low- Power, Wide-Area Wireless Network (LPWAN) technology, for use in the Internet of Things where low speed data links are utilized. That year JT also partnered with ZTE to bring a 5G network to the Channel islands. Both deals are a part of JT's and Jersey's role as a \"digital sandbox\", for testing new telecommunications technologies. That year JT was named Digital Company of the Year award at the Jersey TechAwards. ==Operations== JT in Queen Street ===Wave Telecom=== JT Group has operated in the Bailiwick of Guernsey since 2002 through the subsidiary company \"Wave Telecom Limited\", a wholly owned subsidiary of the JT Group, which was later renamed JT with the rest of the company's properties.http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/assemblyreports/2014/r.091-2014.pdf ===JT Fibre=== JT Fibre is a fibre to the home service, was initiated with a budget of \u00a341.5m with \u00a320m provided by the States of Jersey. The first homes were connected in February 2012. The project ran into difficulties in 2013 due to a dispute between JT and contractors and JT established a new subsidiary to take the programme forward. In November 2015, JT admitted that the project was behind schedule and could finish three years after its 2016 completion deadline. In January 2017, JT announced that the work was 70% complete. The project was delayed as the result of services having to be provided to additional new homes that had been built since the project began. In 2018, JT announced that thanks to the completion of its full-fibre network, Jersey had become the first jurisdiction in the world where 100% of broadband users were on its fibre network. The JT Fibre project began in 2012 with a budget of \u00a341.5m, of which \u00a320m was provided by the Government of Jersey. The first properties were connected in February 2012, but the project ran into difficulties with JT defending the progress after criticism in the States Assembly. JT has laid over 3,000 km of individual fibre-optic cable to over 45,000 homes and businesses providing access, regardless of means, to the whole Island. Now complete, Jersey has the third fastest network in the world, behind Taiwan and Singapore, and is the fastest in Europe. It\u2019s also 100% faster than the UK. JT won \u2018The Best Network Transformation Award\u2019 at the World Communications Awards in November 2019 for its full-fibre network. In January 2020, JT announced it was doubling broadband speeds from 250 Mbit/s to 500 Mbit/s for all subscribers. And in March 2020, following discussions with Digital Jersey and the other telecom operators, JT increased speeds to 1Gbit/s at no extra cost as part of measures to contain the spread of Covid-19. == Partnerships / International Business == In 2019, JT signed a partnership with Speednet Communications, the leading mobile network provider in Belize. The deal meant JT would provide a fully managed roaming service using its existing 2G, 3G and 4G roaming connectivity. The partnership added to JT\u2019s already wide roaming network that has access to over 700 networks around the world. JT upgraded its mobile network to be able to cope with future demands and technologies by signing a deal with global network solutions provider ECI the Elastic Network to upgrade its optical network. 1oT and JT launched a new eSIM product at the World Mobile Congress in March 2019 that allows companies to operate in multiple locations around the world. The technology uses the connectivity provided by JT\u2019s worldwide network. JT CEO, Graeme Millar, was elected Chairman of the Forum for Small Telecom Operators of Small States. The Teleforum brings together operators from a diverse range of countries, from Suriname to the Falkland Islands. \u2018On a professional level, the election is a great honour,\u2019 said Mr Millar told the Guernsey Press. == Technology == ===JT Lab=== JT Lab provides facilities for the trial and testing of telecoms related products in small-scale and live environments. JT Group is regulated by the Channel Islands Competition and Regulatory Authorities. ===Gigabit Isles=== In the early 2010s, JT created the Gigabit Isles project, in order to spread access to FTTP broadband to the full population if the Isles region, at various data rates.What are Jersey Telecom and Gigabit Jersey?, Recombu, 26 November 2012 === 5G === Along with other mobile operators, JT has taken part in limited trials of 5G at two test sites, one in Jersey and the other Guernsey. 12 Roll out of 5G is dependent on licences being issued by the telecoms regulator, the JCRA. ==Community involvement== Between 2005 and 2016, JT was main sponsor of Jersey Live. In Guernsey, it has been principal sponsor of the Cobo Bay Hotel Summer Balcony Gigs since 2012. In 2016, JT ran a 'Summer of Music' in Guernsey, sponsoring several events, including JT Market Rocks in Market Place, The Gathering Festival, Chateau De Son Electronic Music Festival, Proms in the Bay and Junior Battle of the Bands. In 2017, they sponsored House Events, a Guernsey-based events company who brought to the CI events such as House on Herm, Rock on Herm and Sunset on Herm. In 2016, JT employees raised \u00a325,410.98 for baby-related charities, including Jersey Friends of SCBU and the Priaulx Premature Baby Foundation. Fundrasing events included a Staff Charity Day and a 'Join Together' free music concert in Guernsey. In 2017 JT\u2019s chosen charity is Jersey Alzheimer\u2019s Association, in Jersey and Guernsey Alzheimer\u2019s Association, in Guernsey. In September 2017, ten members of staff skydived over St Aubin\u2019s Bay in Jersey, raising \u00a31,000 for Jersey Alzheimer\u2019s Association JT has been the principal sponsor of National Coding Week since its inception in September 2014 .

JT donated a touch-screen tablet computer for every 150 directories collected. === Living Wage Employer === Living Wage Employer JT was accredited by Caritas as a living wage employer by pledging to provide access to a fair wage for all its 600 employees in the Channel Islands and worldwide. 11 Nicola Reeves, JT Group HR Director, said: \u201cJT prides itself on being a responsible employer, we have supported Caritas since the Living Wage was formed. == Finance == === Profits === In 2019, JT returned \u00a317m in dividends to the Government of Jersey\u2019s Treasury, which was in line with previous years. However, the Jersey Evening Post reported a fall in profits which JT\u2019s CEO Graeme Millar explained was down to higher operating costs and investment in major projects and developments. In 2018, profits after tax were \u00a32.2m, a drop of more than half. JT said cutting roaming charges had hit revenue and it had been expensive to increase the number of broadband users on unlimited contracts. ==See also== * Airtel-Vodafone * Newtel Solutions * Sure (company) * Telecommunications in Jersey ==References== ==External links== * Category:1888 establishments in Jersey Category:Telecommunications companies of Jersey Category:Government-owned companies ",
