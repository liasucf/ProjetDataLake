    "text": "Nebuchadnezzar I or Nebuchadrezzar I (), r. c. 1125\u20131104 BC, was the fourth king of the Second Dynasty of Isin and Fourth Dynasty of Babylon. He ruled for 22 years according to the Babylonian King List C, and was the most prominent monarch of this dynasty. He is best known for his victory over Elam and the recovery of the cultic idol of Marduk. ==Biography== He is unrelated to his later namesake, Nab\u00fb-kudurr\u012b-u\u1e63ur II, who has come to be known by the Hebrew form of his name \u201cNebuchadnezzar.\u201d Consequently, it is anachronistic but not inappropriate to apply this designation retroactively to the earlier king, as he does not make an appearance in the Bible. He is misidentified in the Chronicle Concerning the Reign of \u0160ama\u0161-\u0161uma-ukin\u0160ama\u0161-\u0161uma-ukin Chronicle (ABC 15), tablet BM 96273. as the brother of \u0160irikti-\u0161uqamuna probably in place of Ninurta-kudurr\u1fd1-u\u1e63ur I. He succeeded his father, Ninurta-n\u0101din-\u0161umi, and was succeeded in turn by his son Enlil-n\u0101din-apli, brother Marduk-n\u0101din- a\u1e2b\u1e2b\u0113 and then nephew Marduk-\u0161\u0101pik-z\u0113ri, the only members of this family known to have reigned during the dynasty. The Enmeduranki legend, or the Seed of kingship,The seed of kingship tablet K 4874. is a Sumero-Akkadian composition relating his endowment with perfect wisdom (nam-k\u00f9-zu) by the god Marduk and his claim to belong to a \u201cdistant line of kingship from before the flood\u201d and to be an \u201coffspring of Enmeduranki, king of Sippar.\u201d It begins with a lament over preceding events: ===War with Elam=== Kudurru of Nebuchadnezzar I with inscription The duration of Nebuchadnezzar's war with Elam and the number of campaigns he conducted are not known, though it is reasonable to believe that this was a protracted effort with diverse strategic considerations. According to a later literary tradition, an invasion of Elam was thwarted when his army was struck by plague and he narrowly escaped death in the stampede to return home. A raid, or \u0161i\u1e2b\u1e6du, commemorated in a kudurru created during his reign describes a successful campaign. In this raid he was accompanied by the Kassite chieftain \u0160itti-Marduk who struck the decisive blow, he was able to overrun Elam in a surprise attack conducted from D\u0113r during the hottest of the summer months, Dumuzi, when According to the kudduru, Nebuchadnezzar routed the Elamite king \u1e2aulteludi\u0161-In\u0161u\u0161inak on the banks of the river Ulaya in an engagement that saw the dust of the battle darkening the sky. No contemporary or later source records a sack of Susa by Nebuchadnezzar, but according to another kudurru he was able to retrieve the statue of Marduk (here called B\u0113l) and that of the goddess Il-\u0101liya (DINGIR.URU-ia) during this or another campaign.Stone tablet BM 92987, BBSt 24 7-12. The campaign destroyed Elam as a power and provided a defining moment for the Babylonians akin to the siege of Troy for the ancient Greeks. This famous victory was celebrated in hymns, & epic poetry; and alluded to in the Marduk prophecy.Marduk Prophecy tablet K. 2158+. Known as \u201cNab\u00fb-kudurr\u012b-u\u1e63ur and Marduk\u201d or the Epic of Nab\u00fb-kudurr\u012b- u\u1e63urThe Epic of Nab\u00fb-kudurr\u012b-u\u1e63ur, K.3426 (published as CT 13 48). a poetic document dealing with the legendary story of his recovery of the statue of Marduk; and is one of two hymns glorify his military achievements. It opens with the king in despair, lamenting over the absence of Marduk, \"beautiful Babylon pass through your heart, Turn your face toward (your temple) Esagila, which you love!\u201d Stele of Nebudhadnezzar I. British Museum The Hymn to Marduk,The Hymn to Marduk, DT 71. celebrating victory over the Elamites, is assigned to him rather than Ashurbanipal who had a similar triumph, on stylistic grounds. There is a poetic pseudo-autobiography,Tablet K.2660, 3R 38. which does not actually mention him by name. An interlinear Sumero- Akkadian textTablet BM 99067 K 3444, duplicated as K 3317 K 3319 K 5190 BM 35000. describes the events preceding the return of the statue from Elam and its joyous installation in Babylon. A seventh-century astrological report alludes to observations made during his reign and their relationship to his devastation of Elam. ===Other conflicts=== The Synchronistic HistorySynchronistic History, tablets K4401a + Rm 854, ii 1\u201313. relates his entente cordiale with his contemporary, the Assyrian king A\u0161\u0161ur-r\u0113\u0161a-i\u0161i I,Synchronistic King List 2-3 (KAV 12). and subsequently the outcome of two military campaigns against the border fortresses of Zanqi and Idi that he conducted in violation of this agreement. The first was curtailed by the arrival of A\u0161\u0161ur-r\u0113\u0161a-i\u0161i\u2019s main force, causing Nab\u00fb-kudurr\u012b-u\u1e63ur to burn his siege engines and flee, while the second resulted in a battle in which the Assyrians apparently triumphed, \u201cslaughtered his troops (and) carried off his camp.\u201d It even reports the capture of the Babylonian field marshal, Kara\u0161tu. He is titled as the conqueror of the Amorite lands,KUR.MAR.TU.KI. \u201cdespoiler of the Kassites,\u201d in the \u0160ittti-Marduk kudurru, despite the beneficiary being a Kassite chieftain and ally, and having smitten the mighty Lullub\u00fb with weapons. ===Domestic affairs=== His construction activities are memorialized in building inscriptions of the Ekitu\u0161-\u1e2begal-tila, temple of Adad, in Babylon, on bricks from the temple of Enlil in Nippur and appear in the later king Simbar-\u0160ipak\u2019s reference to his having built the throne of Enlil for the Ekur- igigal in Nippur. A late Babylonian inventory lists his donations of gold vessels in Ur and Nabonidus, ca. 555 to 539 BC, consulted his stele for the \u0113ntu-priestess. The earliest of three extant economic texts is dated to his eighth year. Together with three kudurrus and a stone memorial tablet, these are the only contemporary commercial or administrative records extant. Apart from the two deeds related to the Elamite campaign, the other kudurruThe Hinke Kudurru year 16. bears witness to a land grant to the ni\u0161akku of Nippur, a certain Nudku-ibni. His name appears on four Lorest\u0101n bronze daggers and there is a prayer to Marduk on two more. He may be the Nab\u00fb-kudurr\u012b-u\u1e63ur who is mentioned in the Chronicle of Market PricesChronicle of Market Prices (ABC 23), BM 48498, line 13. which records his ninth year but the context is lost. ===Period literature=== The Uruk List of Sages and ScholarsW 20030,7 the Seleucid List of Sages and Scholars, recovered from Anu\u2019s B\u012bt R\u0113\u0161 temple during the 1959/60 excavation. names \u0160aggil-k\u012bnam-ubbib as the umm\u00e2nu, or sage, who served under him and the later king Adad-apla-iddina when he would author the Babylonian Theodicy, and several literary texts are thought to originate from his age, written in both Sumerian and Akkadian. Lambert has suggested that it was during his reign that Marduk was elevated to the head of the pantheon, displacing Enlil and that the En\u00fbma Eli\u0161 was possibly composed, but some historians claim an origin during the earlier Kassite dynasty. A text concerning chemical process (imitations for precious stones) bears a colophon identifying it as a copy of an older Babylonian original but places it in his library. ==See also== * Kudurru for \u0160itti-Marduk * Neminath ==Notes== ==References== ===Primary sources=== ===Secondary sources=== Category:12th- century BC Babylonian kings Category:Babylonian kings Category:12th-century BC rulers Category:Kings of the Universe Category:Late Bronze Age collapse ",
