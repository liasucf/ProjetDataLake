Growing up in Tetovo, Nafiu joined the Shk\u00ebndija youth team. Nafiu was labelled as a gifted and talented player due to him possessing great agility and technical skill, which allowed him to debut for the senior team at the age of sixteen. ===Shk\u00ebndija=== Nafiu debuted for the senior team of Shk\u00ebndija in the 2010\u201311 season of the Prva Liga and helped the club win its first ever league title. He also played in the away leg of the Champions league qualifier against FK Partizan. At the end of his debuting season, Nafiu garnered interest from FC Basel and FC Barcelona. Nafiu at seventeen was invited to go on trial to Barcelona. Nafiu, as a member of the Macedonian U17 national team at the time played alongside David Babunski, who was already a member of the Barcelona youth system. Barcelona scouts were watching Babunski but noticed Nafiu, who impressed the scouts and invited him to come on trial at Barcelona. He went on trial at Barcelona and every indication was that it went well. Swiss champions Basel became very interested in Nafiu and have been tracking him for months. Nafiu was also invited to join the Basel training camp earlier this year and he played several friendly games. He went on trial where he impressed the Swiss club and Basel and Shk\u00ebndija reached a deal for Nafiu to remain in Switzerland before officially completing the transfer once he turned eighteen. ===Basel=== Nafiu officially joined on 23 April 2012, on his eighteenth birthday. He mainly played for the youth teams at Basel and was not capped at senior level. At Basel, Nafiu trained under Thorsten Fink, who highly regarded Nafiu as a very talented player who can play every position in the attack. ===Hamburger=== When Fink left Basel and took the managerial position at Hamburger SV, Nafiu followed suit. In 2012, Nafiu made his debut for Hamburger's reserve team. He made his Bundesliga debut at 25 October 2014 against Hertha BSC replacing Pierre-Michel Lasogga after 74 minutes in a 3\u20130 away defeat.

He made his official debut on 31 January 2015, coming on as a 75th-minute substitute in APOEL's 0\u20131 away victory against Nea Salamina for the Cypriot First Division. He scored his first official goal for APOEL on 21 March 2015, in his team's 2\u20132 home draw against Apollon Limassol for the play-offs of the Cypriot First Division. In his first season at APOEL, he appeared in twelve matches in all competitions and helped his team to win both the Cypriot championship and the cup.
