    "text": "Live Music Now is the name of several connected charities around the world, who bring high-quality live music to people in challenging circumstances who rarely, if ever, have the opportunity to experience live music. It was the original idea of the violinist Yehudi Menuhin , who founded the first Live Music Now in the UK in 1977, together with his friend Ian Stouztker CBE. 'Music, amongst all the great arts, is the language which penetrates most deeply into the human spirit, reaching people through every barrier, disability, language and circumstance. This is why it has been my dream to bring music back into the lives of those people whose lives are especially prone to stress and suffering... so that it might comfort, heal and bring delight.' - Yehudi Menuhin ==United Kingdom== Live Music Now was first founded in 1977 in the United Kingdom by the violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Founder Chairman, Ian Stoutzker CBE. By 2013, Live Music Now UK had reached two million people through over 50,000 workshops and interactive performances. In September 2014 it was announced that Julian Lloyd Webber,September 22, 2014 who had recorded and performed with Yehudi Menuhin, would become a spokesperson for Live Music Now in the United Kingdom. ==Live Music Now worldwide== *Germany *Netherlands *Austria *Switzerland *Denmark *France ==References== == External links == *Live Music Now official website *Yehudi Menuhin website *Yehudi Menuhin video talking about music's healing powers. *Julian Lloyd Webber website Category:Non-profit organisations based in the United Kingdom ",
