It is considered as one of the most important Norwegian children's books. The book includes many songs which are connected to the story. The story is well adapted for playing as a theatre act with musical elements. == Plot summary == The book is about the peaceful town of Kardemomme and the people there, as well as the only characters which stir up serious trouble. They are the three robbers, Casper, Jasper and Jonathan who live outside the town and regularly enter to steal the things they need. The robbers get arrested and are treated well in jail. In the end, they get reformed, and in the final chapter, they become the heroes of the day when they extinguish a fire in the tower of the town.
