His eldest brother, John Monteith, had Scotland's first steam-driven power loom factory in Pollokshaws. The family were originally from the Aberfoyle area and had fought off raids from Rob Roy. He studied at Glasgow University graduating in 1776. Trained in the family weaving business he owned his own factory Henry Monteith & Company by 1785. In 1802 he opened a second factory making handkerchiefs in the Barrowfield district, and when James died later that year also took over his power loom factory in Pollokshaws. His workforce peaked in 1804 with a huge 6000 employees. In May 1820 in his role as Lord Provost, he had to make provisions for the \"Radical War\" of the Scottish workforce, employing militia to counteract this insurrection. In the same capacity he oversaw the hanging of James Wilson on 30 August 1820 on the alleged charge of treason. He was succeeded as Lord Provost by John Thomas Alston. He lived at Westbank House on Renfrew Road in Glasgow. In 1820 he came to an arrangement with the Fullerton family (whose daughter he later married) to acquire their estate in Carstairs and commissioned William Burn to design a country seat for him, known as Carstairs House, which was completed 1823/4. His most controversial parliamentary action was his involvement in the Jamaican slave trials of 1826. He died at Carstairs House in December 1848. He is buried in the Ramshorn Cemetery in central Glasgow. The grave, flanked by short granite columns, lies on the west outer side of the central enclosure.
