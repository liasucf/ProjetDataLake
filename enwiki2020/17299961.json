    "text": "\"Blood of Eden\" is the third single from English rock musician Peter Gabriel's 1992 album Us, featuring backing vocals by Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor. It narrowly failed to break the UK top 40. The single has two b-side tracks: A remix of \"Mercy Street\" (originally from Gabriel's previous studio album So, released in 1986) by William Orbit and an earlier version of the a-side. This version had originally appeared in the Wim Wenders film Until the End of the World (1991) but was not included on the official soundtrack. The song was performed on the 1994 Secret World tour with tour backup singer Paula Cole. This was released on both the Secret World Live album, as well as on the Secret World Live concert film. In 2011, Gabriel re-released the song with orchestral background on the album New Blood. ==Track listing (CD single)== All songs written by Peter Gabriel. # \"Blood of Eden\" (album version) \u2013 6:33 # \"Mercy Street\" (William Orbit mix) \u2013 8:00 # \"Blood of Eden\" (Special mix for Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World) \u2013 6:15 ==Personnel== * Peter Gabriel \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards, keyboard bass * Tony Levin \u2013 bass guitars * David Rhodes \u2013 12-string guitars * David Bottrill \u2013 programming ;Additional musicians * Daniel Lanois \u2013 hi-hat, backing vocals * Richard Blair \u2013 additional programming * Levon Minassian \u2013 duoduok * Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor \u2013 backing vocals * Shankar \u2013 violin * Gus Isidore \u2013 bridge guitars * Richard Chappell \u2013 bridge section mix ==References== ==External links== *List of various formats with detailed track lists at Discogs.com. * Category:1993 singles Category:Peter Gabriel songs Category:Songs written by Peter Gabriel Category:Song recordings produced by Daniel Lanois Category:1992 songs Category:Geffen Records singles Category:Virgin Records singles ",
