Forty-four All-Star Games have been held since the Dallas Stars entered the NHL as the Minnesota North Stars in 1967, with at least one player chosen to represent the franchise in each year. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, and 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games. The franchise has hosted two of the games. The 25th took place at the Met Center, then known as the Metropolitan Sports Center, and the 55th took place at the American Airlines Center. * Selected by fan vote * Selected by Commissioner {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Dallas Stars franchise players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game |- !scope=\"col\" | Game !scope=\"col\" | Year !scope=\"col\" | Name !scope=\"col\" | Position !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References |- !
