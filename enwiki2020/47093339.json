Nugent of The New York Times writes in his review: \"Whipping itself into a fine orchestral frenzy, Melody for Two (at the Palace) posts tenor James Melton behind one swing band and alto Patricia Ellis behind another. As friendly enemies in the night clubs and over the airways they are prepared to fight it out, even if it takes all Summer. Mr. Melton has a pleasant voice for a few pleasant Warren and Dubin tunes and Miss Ellis and Wini Shaw handle their vocal stints easily. But nothing much ever happens\u2014certainly nothing you can't afford to miss. Would it surprise you very much if we whispered that the rival bands and band leaders ultimately appear on twin stages for Delight cigarettes? We thought not. . . . The other half of the double bill is Caf\u00e9 Metropole.\" ==References== ===Sources=== * ==External links== * Category:1937 films Category:1937 musical films Category:English-language films Category:American films Category:American musical films Category:Films directed by Louis King Category:Warner Bros. films Category:American black- and-white films ",
