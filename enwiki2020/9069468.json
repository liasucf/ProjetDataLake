It has been a popular dance music which developed from the Danz\u00f3n-mambo in the early 1950s, and became widely popular throughout the entire world. == Origin == Cha-cha- ch\u00e1 is a Cuban music genre whose creation has been traditionally attributed to Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorr\u00edn, who began his career playing for the charanga band Orquesta Am\u00e9rica.Orovio, Helio. 1981. Diccionario de la M\u00fasica Cubana. La Habana, Editorial Letras Cubanas. , p. 130 According to the testimony of Enrique Jorr\u00edn, he composed some danzones in which the musician of the orchestra had to sing short refrains, and this style was very successful. In the danz\u00f3n \"Constancia\", he introduced some montunos and the audience was motivated to join in singing the refrains. Jorr\u00edn also asked the members of the orchestra to sing in unison so the lyrics might be heard more clearly and achieve a greater impact in the audience. That way of singing also helped to mask the poor singing skills of the orchestra members. In 1948, Jorr\u00edn changed the style of a Mexican song by Guty C\u00e1rdenas, called \"Nunca\", composing a separate part for the trio or montuno of danz\u00f3n; and in 1951 he composed a signature cha-cha-ch\u00e1, \"La enga\u00f1adora\". Jorr\u00edn noticed that most of the dancers had some trouble with highly syncopated rhythms and therefore he simplified the musical texture of his pieces, using as little syncopation as possible. The novel Cha cha ch\u00e1 style was born from melodies that were very easy to dance.Orovio, Helio. 1981. Diccionario de la M\u00fasica Cubana. La Habana, Editorial Letras Cubanas. , p. 130-132 Since its inception, cha-cha-ch\u00e1 music has had a close relationship with the dancer's steps. The name cha-cha-ch\u00e1 came into being with the help of the dancers at the Silver Star Club in Havana. When the dance was coupled to the rhythm of the music, it became evident that the dancer's feet were making a peculiar sound as they grazed the floor on three successive beats. Cha-cha-ch\u00e1 was an onomatopoeia to describe this sound. == Characteristics == Typical piano accompaniment to a cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (Orovio 1981:132) According to Odilio Urf\u00e9, cha-cha-ch\u00e1 was a musical genre that was based on the rhythm of danz\u00f3n-mambo but with a different structural conception. It utilized elements of chotis madrile\u00f1o and a monodic vocal style. After \"La Enga\u00f1adora\", Urf\u00e9's original structure was greatly modified by Jorr\u00edn and other composers.Urf\u00e9, Odilio: Del Mambo y el Cha-cha-ch\u00e1. In Bailes Populares Cubanos, 1974. Fern\u00e1ndez, Mar\u00eda Antonia. La Habana, Editorial Pueblo y Educaci\u00f3n Cuban musicologist Olavo Al\u00e9n emphasizes the inheritance that cha-cha-ch\u00e1 received from danz\u00f3n. He says that actually, cha-cha-ch\u00e1 appears to be a derivative of danz\u00f3n. It maintains a very similar structure to that of danz\u00f3n, while transforming the melodic and rhythmic elements used in the composition of each of its sections. The interpretative function of the flute is retained: its role as a soloist, and the characteristics of its improvisation in danz\u00f3n reappear in cha-cha-ch\u00e1 with hardly any alteration. The melodies of the violins alternate with those of the flute and the voices in a way that became standardized in danz\u00f3n and danzonete. The principal element that differentiates cha-cha-ch\u00e1 from danz\u00f3n is the rhythmic cell that gives its name to the genre. It is also significant that cha-cha-ch\u00e1 abandons the elements from son that were incorporated into the danzonete, and returns to the strict utilization of stylistic elements that arose and were developed in the context of the danz\u00f3n.Al\u00e9n Rodr\u00edguez, Olavo. 1994. De lo Afrocubano a la Salsa. La Habana, Ediciones ARTEX. ==Further development== According to Olavo Al\u00e9n: \"During the 1950s, cha-cha-ch\u00e1 maintained its popularity thanks to the efforts of many Cuban composers who were familiar with the technique of composing danzones and who unleashed their creativity on the cha-cha-ch\u00e1\", such as Rosendo Ruiz, [Jr.] (\"Los Marcianos\" and \"Rico Vacil\u00f3n\"), F\u00e9lix Reina (\"Dime Chinita,\" \"Como Bailan Cha-cha-ch\u00e1 los Mexicanos\"), Richard Eg\u00fces (\"El Bodeguero\" and \"La Cantina\") and Rafael Lay (\"Cero Codazos, Cero Cabezazos\").Al\u00e9n Rodr\u00edguez, Olavo. 1994. De lo Afrocubano a la Salsa. La Habana, Ediciones ARTEX. Although the cha-cha-ch\u00e1 rhythm originated with Orquesta Am\u00e9rica, some scholars, including John Santos (1982), consider the Orquesta Arag\u00f3n of Rafael Lay and Richard Eg\u00fces, and the orchestra Fajardo y sus Estrellas of Jos\u00e9 Fajardo, to have been particularly influential in the development of cha-cha-ch\u00e1. The coincidental emergence of television and LP records were significant factors in the sudden international popularity of the music and dance of cha-cha-ch\u00e1.Santos, John. 1982. The Cuban Danz\u00f3n (Liner Notes). New York, Folkways Records FE 4066 Cha-cha-ch\u00e1 was first presented to the public through the instrumental medium of charanga, a typical Cuban dance band format made up of a flute, strings, piano, bass and percussion. The popularity of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 also revived the popularity of this kind of orchestra.Al\u00e9n Rodr\u00edguez, Olavo. 1994. De lo Afrocubano a la Salsa.
