    "text": "Spirito Santo (\"Holy Spirit\") is a Catholic church located in Alcamo, in the province of Trapani, Sicily. == History == The oldest document about the existence of this Church dates back to May 11 of 1491, among the deeds of the notary Giacomo Gruppuso of Alcamo: it is a concession of an isolated plot of land full of trees, made by the Rectors of the Confraternity of the Annunciation.G.B. Bembina, Alcamo sacra; con note di P. M. Rocca, rivedute ed accresciute da Francesco Maria Mirabella, Alcamo, Accademia di studi Cielo d'Alcamo, 1956 (postuma). In his work entitled Discorso storico della opulenta citt\u00e0 di Alcamo \u2026. chapter XXXII), the historian Ignazio De Blasi, mentions a bill of sale concerning an enclosure in the districts of San Giovanni and Sant'Angelo, dated 20 November 1593, and a land concession dated 17 August 1549 among the deeds of the municipality of that period. The shape of this building, the tempera painting and also the main exposed to the west, as in the near chapel of San Giovanni Battista, indicate that it was built in the same period. In the 16th century it was known as the Church of the Saint Angel because inside it there were temperas of saint Michael and of the Guardian Angel; later it was called with its present name, taking inspiration by the other homonym fresco on its vault; in the mid \u2018700 the Church was restored by Father Adragna, a priest, and other works were done in the following periods.Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo- Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982. De Blasi confirms this supposition on the name and believes that it was named Church of the Saint Angel because, even in the near small Church of San Giovanni, the figure of this patron saint was placed on the right side of the tribune. == Description == Pentecost, painted by Mario Giambona (1703) Besides the frescoes representing the two angels and the other one on the vault depicting the Holy Ghost in the shape of a dove, there is a painting made by Mario Giambona, a painter from Trapani, on the altar; at first, this work, representing the Pentecost, was intended for the chapel of the hospital of Alcamo.La Sicilia e l'Immacolata. Non solo 150 anni. A cura di Diego Ciccarelli e Marisa Dora Valenza. Palermo: Biblioteca Francescana, officina di studi medievali. 2006. From this painting you can notice the artist's talent, linked to the last period of school novellesca: in fact, initially the painting had been assigned to Giacomo Lo Verso, one of Pietro Novelli\u2019s apprentice. In this picture, which has not a good state of conservation, the characters are placed on the Virgin\u2019s sides, almost in a circle, emphasizing the importance of form in Novelli's works, similarly to the apostles in the painting which represents Saint Matthias\u2019s election, kept inside the Church of Capuchins in Leonforte. Once the church was administered by its chaplain, that is a beneficiary, elected by the Bishop of Mazara del Vallo; today it is opened only on the Pentecost Sunday and on 2 November. == References == == Sources == * * * == See also == * Pietro Maria Rocca * Ignazio De Blasi * Francesco Maria Mirabella Category:Roman Catholic churches in Alcamo ",
