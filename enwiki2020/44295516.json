    "text": "\"Did It in a Minute\" is a song performed by American musical duo Hall & Oates. Written by member Daryl Hall with Sara and Janna Allen, the song was released as the third of four singles from their tenth studio album Private Eyes in March 1982. Daryl Hall performs lead vocals, while John Oates provides backing harmony vocals. It peaked at number nine on the United States Billboard Hot 100, becoming one of three top ten singles from Private Eyes. The song was inspired by the 1977 Eric Carmen hit \"She Did It\", because of the 'did-its' in the song. Carmen was touring with Hall & Oates at the time \"Did It in a Minute\" became a hit. \"She Did It\" itself had been inspired by the 'did-its' in the Beach Boys' tune, \"Do It Again\". ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1982) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian Top Singles (RPM) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|10 |- |Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|4 |- |- |- |US Cash Box Top 100 |align=\"center\"|10 |- |align=\"left\" | US Radio & Records CHR/Pop Airplay Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|3 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1982) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank |- |Canada Top Singles (RPM) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|94 |- |US Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990 - | style=\"text-align:center;\"|66 |- |US Cash Box | style=\"text-align:center;\"|68 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1982 singles Category:1981 songs Category:Hall & Oates songs Category:Songs written by Daryl Hall Category:RCA Records singles Category:Songs written by Sara Allen Category:Songs written by Janna Allen Category:American soft rock songs ",
