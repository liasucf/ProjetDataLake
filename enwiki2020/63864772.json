    "text": "Ingrid Leary (born 1967/1968) is a New Zealand politician of the Labour Party. ==Prior to Parliament== Leary was a lawyer, parliamentary press secretary, university lecturer and broadcaster before entering Parliament. She helped to set up the journalism school in the University of the South Pacific in 2007, and lectured there on journalism. When she resigned in 1999 to take up a role in TV production in New Zealand, she was critical of the Fiji government's approach to the media. In 2006 Leary received the New Zealand Special Service Medal for her broadcasting work in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in Aceh. Leary was press secretary for Maurice Williamson, and she later served as the director of the British Council New Zealand for 11 years. == Campaign == Leary was selected as the Labour candidate for the electorate, later renamed Taieri, ahead of Rachel Brooking and Simon McCallum. During the campaign, New Zealand First list MP Mark Patterson publicly queried her commitment to the electorate, as she had admitted spending lockdown on Waiheke island. Leary claimed to be the victim of a smear campaign, as she had studied law in Dunedin, and had relocated to Dunedin with her family, including a child attending school in Dunedin, prior to her selection for the seat. ==Member of Parliament== Leary was elected with a majority of 10,632 over the National candidate, Liam Kernaghan. She said she was hoping for a role in justice, social enterprise or issues relating to seniors. == Family == Leary is a mother of three, and lives in Dunedin with her family, which includes one child at school. ==References== Category:1960s births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand Labour Party MPs Category:Women members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:New Zealand broadcasters ",
