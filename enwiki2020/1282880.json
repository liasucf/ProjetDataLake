    "text": "Thrillington is an album produced by English musician Paul McCartney, under the pseudonym of Percy \"Thrills\" Thrillington, released in April 1977 in the UK and in May 1977 in the US. It is an instrumental cover version of Paul and Linda McCartney's 1971 album Ram. Originally recorded in June 1971, the album was shelved upon the formation of Wings. Although McCartney initially kept his involvement a secret, he soon revealed himself to be Thrillington in 1989. The album was re-issued as part of the deluxe edition of Ram in 2012. ==History== The album was recorded in June 1971 \u2013 with McCartney as producer \u2013 and with an intended release shortly thereafter. Arranger Richard Anthony Hewson was asked to work on the orchestration before Ram had yet been released. When Paul and Linda decided to form Wings, the album was shelved. In preparation for the release of Thrillington, McCartney invented the fictitious socialite Percy Thrillington, and even took out ads in various UK music papers announcing Thrillington's so-called comings and goings to generate curiosity and interest. Released in April 1977, McCartney's name was mentioned only in the main liner notes where he is described as a friend of Percy. Thrillington went mostly unnoticed upon its release although it was reviewed by Rolling Stone magazine and mentioned in the \"Random Notes\" section.\"Random Notes\" Rolling Stone 2 June 1977: 37 It was widely assumed that this was McCartney working under a pseudonym and the album became a collector's item. McCartney finally admitted his role to journalist Peter Palmiere at a Los Angeles press conference on 27 November 1989 during his world tour: \"What a great question to end the conference. The world needs to know! But seriously it was me and Linda \u2013 and we kept it a secret for a long time but now the world knows! \u2013 you blew it!\" In 1990 Paul McCartney also admitted to Palmiere, via an autograph request, that he was indeed Clint Harrigan \u2013 the liner notes writer for Thrillington and Paul McCartney and Wings' Wild Life album. The first person to reveal the identity of Clint Harrigan was John Lennon, who stated as much during a well-publicised letter feud with McCartney in the New Musical Express in 1972. The full story of the Thrillington album was told in detail in 1995 in Beatles fanzine Good Day Sunshine \"Thrillington\", by Matt Hurwitz, Good Day Sunshine Magazine, 1995 and in music journalist Ian Peel's book The Unknown Paul McCartney (Reynolds & Hearn, 2002). Peel tracked down various musicians who brought McCartney's vision to life \u2013 including Richard Hewson, Herbie Flowers and the Mike Sammes Singers \u2013 as well as those that were involved in creating its mythology. ==Re-release== Thrillington was issued on CD in 1995 and 2018, the latter with an accompanying vinyl version. Thrillington was re- issued as part of the deluxe edition of Ram on 21 May 2012. To coincide with this release, McCartney started a Twitter account under the Thrillington name, posting tweets in a manner similar to the original newspaper announcements. The album was re-issued on CD, vinyl, and limited edition coloured vinyl on 18 May 2018. ==Track listing== == Personnel == ===Musicians=== *Richard Hewson \u2013 conductor *Vic Flick \u2013 guitars *Herbie Flowers \u2013 bass guitar *Steve Gray \u2013 piano *Clem Cattini \u2013 drums *Jim Lawless \u2013 percussion *Chris Karan \u2013 guica\"Thrillington,\" by Matt Hurwitz, Good Day Sunshine Magazine, 1995 * Members of the Swingle Singers and the Mike Sammes Singers, led by Mike Sammes \u2013 backing vocalsRichard Hewson, personal interview with Matt Hurwitz, July 2015 === Production === *Percy \"Thrills\" Thrillington \u2013 producer *Richard Hewson \u2013 arranger *Tony Clark \u2013 engineer *Hipgnosis \u2013 artwork *Jeff Cummings \u2013 cover art *Clint Harrigan \u2013 liner notes *Phil Smee \u2013 package design ==References== Category:1977 albums Category:Paul McCartney albums Category:Regal Zonophone Records albums Category:Capitol Records albums Category:Albums with cover art by Hipgnosis Category:Albums produced by Paul McCartney Category:Works published under a pseudonym Category:Fictional musicians Category:Albums recorded at Abbey Road Studios ",
