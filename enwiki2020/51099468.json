    "text": "The Honduran Red Cross is a non-profit institution of social and voluntary interest that provides help to at-risk populations and those affected by disasters. It is part of the international organization Red Cross and Half Moon Red Crescent, which seeks to alleviate human suffering according to each particular situation. == Founding and history == The Honduran Red Cross was developed in 1924 during the second civil war. During the conflict, a group of people organized to tend to those who had been injured at the site of Tegucigalpa by rebels, following the example set by Henry Dunant during the first World War. This group of volunteers, which included Carlos Rivas, Delia Becerra, Emma Bonilla, Ernesto L\u00f3pez Alleys, Hern\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Alleys, Isolina Guilbert, Luz Becerra, Marine Stair, Marieta Guilbert, Otilia Idi\u00e1quez, Roberto Rivas, and Soledad Lozano, among others, became the first to carry the symbol of the Red Cross in Honduras, albeit without a concrete leader. Later, in 1932, Tiburcio Carias Andino created a national aid committee, designating civil engineer Abraham Williams Cald\u00e9ron as its president. Williams Cald\u00e9ron, along with Dr. Enrique Douglas Guilbert, an active member of Rotary International, decided to devise the founding of the Red Cross in Honduras. Thus, on 22 August 1934, the first board of directors was elected in a Honduran casino, which was as follows: * President Manuel Larios C\u00f3rdover, president of the Honduran Medical Association. * First Vice President Nicol\u00e1s Cornelsen. * Second Vice President Abraham Williams Cald\u00e9ron, civil engineer and general. * Vice President of the Republic and Minister of Governing, Justice, Health, and Welfare, Dr. Francisco S\u00e1nchez Urbina. * Secretary Ricardo Diego Alduvin, director of the hospital and dean of the faculty of medicine. * Treasurer Donato Diaz Medina, leader of the bank of Honduras. * Salvador Paredes. In 1937, a group of women organized and sponsored the first group of Honduran aid workers; however, they were not yet defined as the Honduran Red Cross. Focused on their requests to the government to obtain legal status, they developed activities to benefit the Honduran society. On September 4 of the same year, the president, doctor, and general Tiburcio Carias Andino, in a meeting at the Presidential House of Honduras, granted a well deserved legal recognition to the group, organizing a board of directors. Original members included Adolfina Mej\u00eda, Berta Garc\u00eda de Saenz Rico, Elia Pineda de Fort\u00edn, Ernestina de Landa, Enriqueta Gir\u00f3n de L\u00e1zarus, Dr. Guillermo Dur\u00f3n, Dr. Hern\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Alleys, lawyer H\u00e9ctor Pineda Ugarte, Dr. Humberto D\u00edaz Banegas, Isabel Siqueiros de Pinel, Isolina Lozano de Guilbert, Josefina Mej\u00eda, lawyer Jorge Fidel Dur\u00f3n, Dr. Juan A. Mej\u00eda, Dr. Manuel C\u00e1ceres Vijil, Dr. and future president Ram\u00f3n Villeda Moral, and lawyer Rub\u00e9n \u00c1lvarez Channels. By means of Decree No. 475 issued on 6 October 1937, the institution was known officially as the Honduran Red Cross, with the intended function of engaging in humanitarian action in the national territory. In 1941, L\u00e1zarus Henrietta, serving as president of the Honduran Red Cross, requested the National Congress of Honduras to issue a law establishing income for the organization. It was issued as the \"law of the income of the seal of the Red Cross\" so that the organization would receive finances in order to sustain themselves independently and continue providing social services. The economic funds received by the organization would help the organization to sustain itself independently and continue providing social services. In October 1937, the original group of volunteers from 1924 were recognized for the first time. In 1942, the first units were established in San Pedro Sula, Puerto Cort\u00e9s, Tela, and La Ceiba. These units were authorized to retain 40% of donations collected by donors and benefactors and sending the other 60% to the central committee. In the same year, the Infant Consul was founded, with the goal of providing help and support to Honduran children. In 1950, the organization received its first ambulance, a Ford model. In 1954, the then president of Honduras, Dr. Juan Manuel G\u00e1lvez, donated land for the construction of the official headquarters. In 1978, the official statutes of the Honduran Red Cross were published. The Honduran Red Cross has had a major impact on several Honduran events, such as the third civil war of 1931, the events of 1954, the Football War of 1969. Together with ACNUR and Doctors without Borders, they have backed the mobilization of civilians in the border zones with El Salvador and Nicaragua, as in the natural disasters caused by the Hurricane Fifi-Orlene of 1971 and Hurricane Mitch, which devastated the north and central zones of the Central American country in 1998. == Presidents == Presidents of the Central Committee of the Honduran Red Cross: * Enriqueta Gir\u00f3n de L\u00e1zarus. * Cleto Ram\u00f3n Alvarez. * Meneca Of Menc\u00eda *Jos\u00e9 Juan Castro (current) === Paramedics === The body of paramedics, staffed by volunteers, receives a basic course in first aid, basic emergency aid, building rescue, mountains aid, rivers aid, etc. They also receive intensive training in infant nursing, in addition to cardiovascular and pulmonary resuscitation, minor surgeries, dealing with infections, and so on. === Regional headquarters === The central headquarters of the Honduran Red Cross is in the Concepci\u00f3n neighborhood, 7th street, 1st and 2nd avenue, of Tegucigalpa, M.D.C. The expansion of the regional headquarters led to the expansion of the Red Cross into many major Honduran cities, such as Comayagua, Danl\u00ed, The Ceiba, Choluteca, Santa B\u00e1rbara, Juticalpa, San Pedro Sula, Santa Rosa de Cop\u00e1n, and Yuscar\u00e1n. == Red Cross Youth Honduras == Red Cross Youth Honduras is an auxiliary program of Honduran Red Cross founded on 17 June 1964.
