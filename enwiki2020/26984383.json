    "text": "Bicycling is a cycling brand published by Hearst in Easton, Pennsylvania. __TOC__ ==Origin== Bicycling started in 1961 as Northern California Cycling Association Newsletter, a 4-page mimeographed newsletter (8 \u00bd x 14) started by Peter Hoffman. It covered the local bicycle scene and grew quickly as Vol. 1 No. 6 took on a 5 \u00bd x8 \u00bd offset printing format in December, 1961. The name was changed to American Cycling Newsletter with Vol. 3 No. 1 in March, 1964 issue. The name was changed again with Vol. 5 No. 1 in March, 1965 to American Cycling. The size was changed to a larger format with Vol. 5 No. 1 in March, 1966 to 8 \u00bd x 11. Peter Hoffman sold the magazine to Leete publications in August 1968 but stayed on as an editor until late 1969. The last American Cycling titled magazine was the Nov. 1968 issue, Vol. 7 No. 8. The name was changed to Bicycling! with the Dec 1968 Issue Vol 7 No 9. For three months following the name change, \"American Cycling\" was included on the cover in small print under the Bicycling! masthead. NCCA Newsletter and American Cycling were published 10 times a year, March though December; however, in 1968 -the first year under Leete- there were only 9 issues. Leete skipped the October issue and called it November both to make it more current, and because they were behind in production as they worked on the design change to Bicycling!. After 1968 the magazine went to publishing 12 issues a year. In April 1973 the magazine was acquired by Capital Management Publications. In early December 1977, a team was sent from Rodale to California to meet with the owner and iron out a deal.Our Roots Grow Deep: The Story of Rodale, Daniel Gross, 2008 Rodale acquired Bicycling! and published their first issue in February, 1978. In 1980, Rodale purchased a smaller magazine, Bike World, and merged it into Bicycling!. In 1982 Rodale bought American Cyclist and incorporated it into Bicycling. Pricing of the magazine changed over the years as follows July 62 to December 64, 25 cents, March 65 to June 67, 35 cents, July 67 to July 68, 45 cents, In August 1968 with the Leete purchase the price went up to 50 cents, and the covers were changed to full color, the previous covers had been in red and black. Hearst announced its acquisition of Rodale in 2017. Hearst moved Bicycling to Easton, Pennsylvania in 2018. ==Projects and compilations== BikeTown Africa is a project that started in 2006 as a partnership between Bicycling, Rodale Press, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Kona Bicycle Company.
