That's not to say that this wordless double-disc set, featuring an all-star orchestra full of sharp improvisers, isn't wildly inventive in its water-colored way\". Pitchfork's Seth Colter Walls rated the album 7.6 out of 10, saying, \"Cline has delivered a chamber-orchestra set that\u2019s notable for relying on some \u201cGreat American Songbook\u201d standards by the likes of Jerome Kern and Rodgers & Hammerstein... The only task he doesn\u2019t quite pull off is the composition of original themes that stand with the classics he\u2019s selected. Almost half of the first CD is made up of Cline originals, and these pale a bit in comparison with the surrounding material. Though thanks to its sly and measured embrace of the experimental, Lovers still has all the originality it needs to endear\". Blurt correspondent Adolph Alzuphar noted: \"Nels Cline\u2019s Blue Note debut Lovers is a musical bonanza: guitar, the lyrical and the experimental. And it\u2019s monumental when the album\u2019s band lets loose\". Allmusic reviewer Thom Jurek stated \"Due to its extensive length and low-key demeanor, Lovers is demanding. That said, Cline's harmonic, textural, and timbral palettes deliver it as a compellingly engaging and original take on orchestral -- and by intent, conceptual -- jazz. He hears possibilities in the historical past and articulates them with timeless ardor. This may be Cline's quietest recording, but it is one of his finest\".
