    "text": "The blue danio, Kerr's danio or turquoise danio (Danio kerri), is a tropical fish belonging to the genus Danio in family Cyprinidae. ==Distribution and habitat== The blue danio is found on the islands of Langkawi and Ko Yao Yai in Malaysia. ==Description== It is a blue-colored, deep-bodied danio with several pinkish/gold lines from tail to gills which may or may not be continuous, over a powder blue side. ==In the aquarium== The blue danio is a peaceful, active schooling fish, so is usually kept in groups. They prefer a well-planted environment, but still need plenty of space to school. Blue danios are often kept in water with a 6.5 \u2013 7.0 pH, a water hardness of 8 \u2013 12 dGH, and a temperature range of 73 \u2013 77 \u00b0F (23\u201325 \u00b0C). ==Mating== Blue danios are egg- scatterers that spawn over coarse gravel beds. They will typically spawn at the first light of day. The eggs will hatch in about 36 hours. ==Etymology== The taxonomic name honors A.F.G. Kerr, who collected the first specimen on Ko Yao Yai in 1929. == References == * * ==External links== *Danio kerri Category:Danio Category:Fish described in 1931 Category:Fish of Thailand Category:Cyprinid fish of Asia ",
