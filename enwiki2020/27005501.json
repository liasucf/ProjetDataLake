    "text": "Luxembourg was represented by English singer Ireen Sheer, with the song '\"Bye Bye I Love You\", at the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 6 April in Brighton, England. The song was chosen internally by broadcaster RTL, and is noted as the first Eurovision entry composed by the prolific Ralph Siegel. This was the first of three Eurovision appearances by Sheer. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Sheer performed 9th in the running order, following Sweden and preceding Monaco. \"Bye Bye I Love You\" was a song very much in German schlager style and, despite its title, was sung in French. Sheer's heavily English-accented French was commented on, although this was in keeping with the song's lyrics - the opening line was \"Moi je ne savais presque pas parler fran\u00e7ais\" (\"I could hardly speak a word of French\"). At the close of voting \"Bye Bye I Love You\" had received 14 points, placing Luxembourg joint 4th (with Monaco and the United Kingdom) of the 17 entries.ESC History - Luxembourg 1974 ==See also== *Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1974 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 Category:Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1974 in Luxembourg ",
