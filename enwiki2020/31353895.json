    "text": "Afon Dyfrdwy (River Dee) is a Site of Special Scientific Interest in the preserved county of Clwyd, north Wales. The river begins in Parc Cenedlaethol Eryri, in Snowdonia, Wales. From there, it flows northeast to Corwen, goes eastwards past Llangollen, and continues east through Chester, England. It empties into Aber Dyfrdwy, an estuary that forms the border between the Wirral Peninsula in north-west England and Flintshire in north-east Wales. The river has been designated a Designated Special Area of Conservation due to its role as a habitat for Atlantic Salmon and Floating Water Plantain. ==See also== *List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Clwyd ==References== Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Clwyd ",
