    "text": "Vaginal tumors are neoplasms (tumors) found in the vagina. They can be benign or malignant. A neoplasm is an abnormal growth of tissue that usually forms a tissue mass. Vaginal neoplasms may be solid, cystic or of mixed type. Vaginal cancers arise from vaginal tissue, with vaginal sarcomas develop from bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels or other connective or supportive tissue. Tumors in the vagina may also be metastases (malignant tissue that has spread to the vagina from other parts of the body). Cancer that has spread from the colon, bladder, and stomach is far more common than cancer that originates in the vagina itself. Some benign tumors may later progress to become malignant tumors, such as vaginal cancers. Some neoplastic growths of the vagina are sufficiently rare as to be only described in case studies. Signs and symptoms may include a feeling of pressure, painful intercourse or bleeding. Most vaginal tumors are located during a pelvic exam. Ultrasonography, CT and MRI imaging is used to establish the location and presence or absence of fluid in a tumor. Biopsy provides a more definitive diagnosis. == Vaginal tumors == Micrograph showing the yolk sac component of a mixed germ cell tumour. H&E; stain.
