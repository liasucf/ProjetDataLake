    "text": "In the United States Congress, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives elections are held when the House of Representatives first convenes after a general election for its two-year term, or when a Speaker of the House dies, resigns or is removed from the position intra-term. The speaker is the political and parliamentary leader of the House, and is simultaneously the body's presiding officer, the de facto leader of the body's majority party, and the institution's administrative head. There have been 126 elections for speaker since the office was created in 1789. Traditionally, each party's caucus or conference selects a candidate for speaker from among its senior leaders prior to the vote. Prior to 1839, the House elected its speaker by paper ballot, but since, on all but three occasions, has done so by roll call vote. A majority of votes cast (as opposed to a majority of the full membership of the House) is necessary to elect a speaker. By House precedents, votes of present are not to be included in the official vote total, only votes cast for a person by name are; even so, they have been counted on several occasions. If no candidate receives a majority vote, then the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected. In the longest speaker election in House history, 133 ballots (cast over a two-month period) were needed before representatives chose Nathaniel Banks as their presiding officer for the 34th Congress (1855\u20131857). Multiple roll calls have been necessary only 14 times since 1789, and not since 1923. Representatives are not restricted to voting for the candidate nominated by their party, but generally do. Additionally, as the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly state that the speaker must be an incumbent member of the House, it is permissible for representatives to vote for someone who is not a member of the House at the time, and non-members have received a few votes in various speaker elections over the past several years. Nevertheless, every person elected speaker has been a member. Altogether, 54 people have served as speaker over the past years; 32 of them served multiple terms (seven of those served nonconsecutive terms). Sam Rayburn holds the record for electoral victories, with 10. He led the House from September 1940 to January 1947, January 1949 to January 1953, and January 1955 to November 1961 (a tenure totaling 17 years). The youngest person elected to the office was Robert M. T. Hunter, age 30 when he became speaker in 1839; the oldest person elected for the first time was Henry T. Rainey in 1933, at age 72. In most recent election for speaker, held January 3, 2019, the first day of the 116th Congress, members elected Nancy Pelosi to the office. She had previously led the House from January 2007 to January 2011, and is the first woman to serve as speaker. == Elections from 1789 to 1799 == === April 1789 === The first-ever election for Speaker of the House took place on April 1, 1789, at the start of the 1st Congress, following the 178889 elections in which candidates who supported the new Frame of Government won a majority of the seats. Frederick A. Muhlenberg, who had promoted the ratification of the Constitution, received a majority of the votes cast and was elected speaker. Though political parties did not yet exist, political factions, from which they evolved, formed almost immediately after Congress began its work. Those who supported the Washington administration were referred to as \"Pro- Administration\", while those in opposition were known as \"Anti- Administration\". === October 1791 === An election for speaker took place October 24, 1791, at the start of the 2nd Congress, following the 179091 elections in which Pro-Administration candidates won a majority of the seats. Jonathan Trumbull Jr. received a majority of the votes cast and was elected speaker. === December 1793 === An election for speaker took place December 2, 1793, at the start of the 3rd Congress, following the 179293 elections in which anti-administration candidates won a majority of the seats. Former speaker Frederick Muhlenberg received a majority of the votes cast in the 3rd ballot and was elected speaker. This was the first Speaker of the House election to be contested primarily on a partisan basis. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-right:1em; font-size:95%\" |+ style=\"background- color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:.2em .4em\" | 1793 election for Speaker |- ! colspan=5 style=\"font-size:95%\" | December 2, 17931st ballot |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 3.5em\" |% |- | style=\"width: 0.5em; background:\" | | Pro-Administration | Theodore Sedgwick () | style=\"text- align:right\" | 24 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 36.36 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Anti-Administration | Frederick Muhlenberg () | style=\"text-align:right\" | 21 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 31.82 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Anti- Administration | Abraham Baldwin () | style=\"text-align:right\" | 14 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 21.22 |- | style=\"background:\" | | \u2014 | Others | style=\"text-align:right\" | 7 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 10.60 |- ! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | Total votes: | style=\"text-align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | 66 | style=\"text-align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | 100 |- ! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | Votes necessary: | style=\"text- align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | 34 | style=\"text-align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | >50 |- ! colspan=5 style=\"font-size:95%\" | December 2, 17933rd Ballot |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 3.5em\" |% |- | style=\"background:\" | | Anti-Administration | Frederick Muhlenberg () | style=\"text-align:right\" | 37 | rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:center\"| |- | style=\"background:\" | | Pro- Administration | Theodore Sedgwick () | style=\"text-align:right\" | 27 |- | style=\"background:\" | | \u2014 | Others | style=\"text-align:right\" | (?) |- ! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | Total votes: | style=\"text-align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | 64+ | style=\"text-align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | 100 |- ! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | Votes necessary: | style=\"text- align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | ~34 | style=\"text-align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | >50 |} === December 1795 === An election for speaker took place December 7, 1795, at the start of the 4th Congress, following the 179495 elections. During the preceding Congress, the Pro-Administration faction coalesced into the Federalist Party, and the Anti-Administration faction into the Democratic-Republican Party. Though Democratic-Republicans won a majority of the seats in these elections, several joined with the Federalists to elect Jonathan Dayton speaker on the first ballot. === May 1797 === An election for speaker took place May 15, 1797, at the start of the 5th Congress, following the 179697 elections in which Federalists won a majority of the seats. In a near-unanimous vote, Jonathan Dayton was re-elected Speaker. === December 1799=== An election for speaker took place December 2, 1799, at the start of the 6th Congress, following the 179899 elections in which Federalists won a majority of the seats.

Nathaniel Macon received a majority of the votes cast in the 3rd ballot and was re-elected speaker. A number of Democratic-Republicans did not support Macon's bid for a third term as he had broken ranks with President Jefferson and aligned himself with the splinter Quids faction. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-right:1em; font-size:95%\" |+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin- bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:.2em .4em\" | 1805 election for Speaker |- ! colspan=5 style=\"font-size:95%\" | December 2, 18051st ballot |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 3.5em\" |% |- | style=\"width: 0.5em; background:\" | | Democratic- Republican | Nathaniel Macon () (Incumbent) | style=\"text-align:right\" | 51 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 48.58 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Democratic- Republican | Joseph Varnum () | style=\"text-align:right\" | 26 | style=\"text- align:right\" | 24.76 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Federalist | John C.

Varnum received a majority of the votes cast and was elected speaker. === May 1809 === An election for speaker took place May 22, 1809, at the start of the 11th Congress, following the 180809 elections in which the Democratic-Republicans won a majority of the seats. On the first ballot, Joseph Varnum received 60 of the 118 votes cast for individuals. In addition to these, two ballots were returned blank. The question arose over whether or not the blank ballots counted. If they were, then the total number of votes cast would be 120, making the threshold for election 61. If they were not, then the threshold would be 60 (of 118), thus making Varnum the winner. After a brief debate a motion to proceed with a second ballot was approved. Varnum received a majority of the votes cast in the 2nd ballot and was re-elected speaker. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-right:1em; font-size:95%\" |+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:.2em .4em\" | 1809 election for Speaker. |- ! colspan=5 style=\"font-size:95%\" | May 22, 18091st Ballot |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 3.5em\" |% |- | style=\"width: 0.5em; background:\" | | Democratic-Republican | Joseph Varnum () (Incumbent) | style=\"text-align:right\" | 60 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 50.00 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Democratic-Republican | Nathaniel Macon () | style=\"text-align:right\" | 36 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 30.00 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Federalist | Timothy Pitkin () | style=\"text- align:right\" | 20 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 16.67 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Democratic-Republican | Roger Nelson () | style=\"text-align:right\" | 1 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 0.83 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Federalist | Charles Goldsborough () | style=\"text-align:right\" | 1 | style=\"text- align:right\" | 0.83 |- | style=\"background:#f5f5f5\" | | \u2014 | Blank | style=\"text-align:right\" | 2 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 1.67 |- ! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | Total votes: | style=\"text-align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | 120 | style=\"text-align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | 100 |- ! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | Votes necessary: | style=\"text- align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | 61 | style=\"text-align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | >50 |- ! colspan=5 style=\"font-size:95%\" | May 22, 18092nd ballot |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 3.5em\" |% |- | style=\"background:\" | | Democratic-Republican | Joseph Varnum () (Incumbent) | style=\"text- align:right\" | 65 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 54.62 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Democratic-Republican | Nathaniel Macon () | style=\"text-align:right\" | 45 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 37.82 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Federalist | Timothy Pitkin () | style=\"text-align:right\" | 6 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 5.04 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Democratic-Republican | Benjamin Howard () | style=\"text-align:right\" | 1 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 0.84 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Democratic-Republican | Roger Nelson () | style=\"text- align:right\" | 1 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 0.84 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Federalist | Charles Goldsborough () | style=\"text-align:right\" | 1 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 0.84 |- ! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:right\" | Total votes: | style=\"text-align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | 119 | style=\"text-align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | 100 |- ! colspan=3 style=\"text- align:right\" | Votes necessary: | style=\"text-align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | 60 | style=\"text-align:right; background:#f5f5f5\" | >50 |} === November 1811 === An election for speaker took place on November 4, 1811, at the start of the 12th Congress, following the 181011 elections in which Democratic- Republicans won a majority of the seats. Henry Clay, a freshman congressman, received a majority of the votes cast and was elected speaker. === May 1813 === An election for speaker took place on May 24, 1813, at the start of the 13th Congress, following the 181213 elections in which Democratic-Republicans won a majority of the seats. Henry Clay received a majority of the votes cast and was re-elected speaker. === January 1814 === On January 19, 1814, during the third session of the 13th Congress, Henry Clay resigned as speaker to accept a commission from President James Madison to serve as a negotiator for a peace agreement to end the War of 1812. Later that day, an intra-term election for a new speaker was held. Langdon Cheves received a majority of the votes cast and was elected speaker. === December 1815 === An election for speaker took place on December 4, 1815 at the start of the 14th Congress following the 181415 elections in which Democratic-Republicans won a majority of the seats. Elected again to the House, former speaker Henry Clay received a majority of the votes cast and was elected speaker. === December 1817 === An election for speaker took place on December 1, 1817 at the start of the 15th Congress following the 181617 elections in which Democratic-Republicans won a majority of the seats. In a near-unanimous vote, Henry Clay was re-elected Speaker. === December 1819 === An election for speaker took place on December 6, 1819 at the start of the 16th Congress following the 181819 elections in which Democratic-Republicans won a majority of the seats. In a near-unanimous vote, Henry Clay was re-elected Speaker. === November 1820 === In October 1820, between the first and the second session of the 16th Congress, Henry Clay resigned as speaker so he could return to his private law practice; he kept his House seat however, until his term ended the following March (he had not run for re-election in 1820). Consequently, an intra-term election for a new speaker was held on November 13\u201315, 1820. Coming as it did less than a year after the rancorous Missouri statehood debate, the choice of Clay's successor became mired in the continuing national debate between Northerners and Southerners over the expansion of slavery into territories and future states. The chief candidate of Northern antislavery members, John W. Taylor of New York, finally received a majority of the votes cast in the 22nd ballot and was elected speaker. In addition to discord over slavery, Taylor's path to victory was made even more difficult by a division within that state's congressional delegation between supporters of Governor DeWitt Clinton and those who opposed him (known as the Bucktails). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-right:1em; font-size:95%\" |+ style=\"background- color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:.2em .4em\" | 1820 special election for Speaker. |- ! colspan=5 style=\"font-size:95%\" | November 13, 18201st ballot |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 3.5em\" |% |- | style=\"width: 0.5em; background:\" | | Democratic-Republican | John W.

In the aftermath of these elections, the Democratic-Republican Party rapidly splintered between those who supported the new president, John Quincy Adams, and those who supported Andrew Jackson. Representatives who supported Adams held a slim majority in the House. Former speaker John W. Taylor received a majority of the votes cast in the 2nd ballot and was elected speaker. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-right:1em; font-size:95%\" |+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:.2em .4em\" | 1825 election for Speaker. |- ! colspan=5 style=\"font-size:95%\" | December 5, 18251st ballot |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 3.5em\" |% |- | style=\"width: 0.5em; background:\" | | Adams | John W.

Andrew Stevenson won a majority of the votes cast and was elected speaker. === December 1829 === An election for speaker took place on December 7, 1829 at the start of the 21st Congress following the 182829 elections in which Jacksonians, candidates supporting now-President Andrew Jackson won a majority of the seats. Andrew Stevenson won a majority of the votes cast and was re-elected speaker. === December 1831 === An election for speaker took place on December 5, 1831 at the start of the 22nd Congress following the 183031 elections in which Jacksonians won a majority of the seats. Andrew Stevenson won a majority of the votes cast and was re-elected speaker. === December 1833 === An election for speaker took place on December 2, 1833 at the start of the 23rd Congress following the 183233 elections in which Jacksonians won a majority of the seats. Andrew Stevenson won a majority of the votes cast and was re-elected speaker. === June 1834 === In June 1834, Andrew Stevenson resigned as speaker of the House and from Congress to accept President Andrew Jackson's nomination as the U.S. minister to the United Kingdom. Consequently, an intra-term election for a new speaker was held on June 2, 1834, during the 23rd Congress. The president favored James K. Polk for the post, but when members of his \"Kitchen Cabinet\" went to Capitol Hill and lobbied on Polk's behalf, they were rebuffed. Perceived as an encroachment upon a constitutional prerogative of the House, the effort to influence the vote splintered Jacksonian party unity and energized the opposition. John Bell ultimately received a majority of the votes cast in the 10th ballot and was elected speaker. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-right:1em; font-size:95%\" |+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:.2em .4em\" | 1834 special election for Speaker. |- ! colspan=5 style=\"font-size:95%\" | June, 2 18341st ballot |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 3.5em\" |% |- | style=\"width: 0.5em; background:\" | | Jacksonian | Richard H.

Polk won a majority of the votes cast and was re-elected speaker. === December 1839 === An election for speaker took place December 14\u201316, 1839, at the start of the 26th Congress, following the 183839 elections in which the Democrats won a slim majority of the seats. Balloting was delayed for two weeks as Democrats and Whigs contested the seating of five representatives-elect from New Jersey, commencing only after the House resolved not to seat either delegation immediately. Once underway, the narrowly divided House was unable to make a quick choice. Finally, on the 11th ballot, Robert M. T. Hunter received a majority of the votes cast and was elected speaker. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-right:1em; font-size:95%\" |+ style=\"background- color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:.2em .4em\" | 1839 election for Speaker |- ! colspan=5 style=\"font-size:95%\" | December 14, 18391st ballot. |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 3.5em\" |% |- | style=\"width: 0.5em; background:\" | | Democratic | John W.

Robert C. Winthrop received a majority of the votes cast in the 3rd ballot and was elected speaker. The election became a multi-ballot affair when a few \"Conscience Whigs\" initially refused to support Winthrop because he rejected their demand for a pledge to constitute key House committees so as to favor the reporting of antislavery legislation. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin- right:1em; font-size:95%\" |+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin- bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:.2em .4em\" | 1847 election for Speaker. |- ! colspan=5 style=\"font-size:95%\" | December 6, 18471st ballot |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 3.5em\" |% |- | style=\"width: 0.5em; background:\" | | Whig | Robert C.

Divisions within both the Democratic Party and Whig Party over slavery plus the presence of the new Single-issue antislavery Free Soil Party led to pandemonium in the House and a protracted struggle to elect a speaker. After 59 ballots without a majority choice, the House adopted a plurality rule stating that, if after three more ballots no one garnered a majority of the votes, the person receiving the highest number of votes on the next ensuing ballot would be declared to have been chosen speaker. On the decisive 63rd ballot, Howell Cobb received the most votes, 102 votes out of 221, or nine less than a majority, and was elected speaker. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-right:1em; font-size:95%\" |+ style=\"background- color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:.2em .4em\" | 1849 election for Speaker |- ! colspan=5 style=\"font-size:95%\" | December 3, 18491st ballot. |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 3.5em\" |% |- | style=\"width: 0.5em; background:\" | | Democratic | Howell Cobb () | style=\"text-align:right\" | 103 | style=\"text-align:right\" | 46.61 |- | style=\"background:\" | | Whig | Robert C.
