    "text": "The is an electric multiple unit (EMU) train type used for commuter and outer- suburban services operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) in Japan since 2000. ==Design== Trains were manufactured by Tokyu Car Corporation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and also at JR East's factory at Niitsu in Niigata Prefecture. The type evolved from the earlier 209 series and E217 series EMUs, with the main visible difference being wider bodies (2,950 mm compared to the 2,800 mm for earlier commuter trains), and the prototype train built in 1998 for trials on the Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line was actually classified 209-950 series, later becoming E231-900 series. Full-production E231-0 series trains were subsequently introduced on the Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line (10-car sets) and J\u014dban Line (10+5-car sets). Other variants include the 11-car E231-500 series for the Yamanote Line, and the E231-800 series with 2,800 mm wide bodies and end doors for use on Tokyo Metro Tozai Line inter-running services. From 2000 onward, the first E231-1000 series outer-suburban variant was delivered for use on Utsunomiya Line and Takasaki Line services north from Ueno Station in Tokyo. These trains included transverse seating in some cars and were also equipped with toilets. Production continued into 2006 with trains delivered for use on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line south from Tokyo. From 2004 onward, two bilevel Green cars were inserted into all E231-1000 series ten-car sets. ==Variants== * 10px / 10px / 10px E231-0 series: 8-car, 10-car, and 10+5-car sets used on the Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line, J\u014dban Line, Narita Line, Musashino Line, and Keiy\u014d Line * 10px E231-500 series: 10-car sets used on Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line * 10px E231-800 series: 10-car sets used on Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line and Tokyo Metro Tozai Line interrunning services * 10px E231-900 series: 8-car set used on the Musashino Line and Keiy\u014d Line * 10px E231-1000 series: 10+5-car suburban sets used on the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line, Utsunomiya Line, and Takasaki Line, and on Ueno\u2013Tokyo Line and Sh\u014dnan\u2013Shinjuku Line through services * 10px E231-3000 series: 4-car sets converted from former E231-0 series sets for use on the Kawagoe Line and Hachik\u014d Line === Former operations === *10px E231-500 series: 11-car sets used on the Yamanote Line from 21 April 2002 until 20 January 2020 * 10px E231-900 series: 10-car set used on the Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line from December 1998 until 25 February 2020 (designated as 209-950 series until June 2000) ==E231-0 series== The first full-production E231-0 series trains were introduced on the Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line between February 2000 and November 2001, with and 21 ten-car sets (101\u2013121) based at Narashino Depot in Chiba and 21 ten-car sets (20\u201325, 28\u201342) based at Mitaka Depot in Tokyo. They replaced older 103, 201, and 205 series trains. One more ten-car set (57) was delivered to Mitaka Depot in November 2002. In December 2003, all Narashino sets were transferred to Mitaka Depot and renumbered 1\u201319, 26, and 27. Between October and November 2006, three more sets (80\u201382) were built to replace three 209-500 series sets transferred to the Keihin\u2013T\u014dhoku\u2014Negishi Line, creating a total fleet of 46 trains. The Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line sets each contained a six-door car. New built E231-0 series sets were also delivered to Matsudo Depot between November 2001 and February 2005 for use on J\u014dban Line services between Ueno and Toride, and also Narita Line services to Narita, replacing the earlier 103 series fleet. A total of 17 ten-car sets (101\u2013117) and 19 five-car sets (121\u2013139) were built. From December 2009 to November 2011, set 27 was temporarily transferred to Tokyo General Rolling Stock Center and used to deliver new SaHa E231-600 and SaHa E231-4600 trailer cars for the Yamanote Line. In 2012, a \"B\" suffix was added to all Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line sets (B1\u2013B42, B57, and B80\u2013B82). ===Refurbishment=== Between 2015 and 2020, all E231-0 series sets underwent a mid-life refurbishment with new equipment. In addition, with the transfer of former Yamanote Line E231-500 series sets to the Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line and to prepare for the installation of platform doors, 40 trains were transferred from the Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line to other lines, while six trains were reformed and remain on the Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line with all six-door cars replaced with excess four-door cars from the other 40 sets. In late 2014 and early 2015, two Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line sets (B20 and B21, with six-door cars substituted by two trailer cars from B22) were transferred to the J\u014dban Line (and renumbered 118 and 119) for the extension of the J\u014dban Line services to Shinagawa Station with the opening of the Ueno\u2013Tokyo Line. This brought the total number of J\u014dban Line sets to 38 (19 five-car and 19 ten-car sets), all of which were refurbished between 2015 and 2020. From October 2017 to September 2020, 32 Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line sets were refurbished, shortened to eight cars, and transferred to the Musashino Line (and renumbered MU2\u2013MU21, MU31\u2013MU39, and MU41\u2013MU43) to replace older 205 series and 205-5000 series sets; the first set (MU2) entered service in November 2017. From November 2017 to October 2019, six Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line sets were refurbished, shortened to four cars, redesignated as E231-3000 series, and transferred to the Hachik\u014d Line and Kawagoe Line. The first reformed E231-0 series Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line train (with 6 motored cars and no six-door car), numbered set B11 and composed of 8 cars of former set B11 and 2 cars of former set B5, completed refurbishment on 24 April 2018 and reentered into service on 21 May 2018. A total of six reformed ten-car trains remain on the Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line. The last non-reformed trains (with 4 motored cars and a six-door car), sets B80 and B82, were removed from service after 13 March 2020. Between 17 August and 7 October 2020, J\u014dban Line set 118 was shortened to 8 cars and modified for use on the Musashino Line at Nagano depot. It was renumbered MU22 and reentered service on 12 October. ====Transfers from Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:85%;\" |- !colspan=\"12\"|Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line transfers and reformations (standard pattern) |-style=\"background-color: #FFEA80;\" !

The first trains entered service on 21 April 2002. These trains include D-ATC digital automatic train control, and feature pairs of LCD passenger information screens above each door internally. These screens also show advertisements. Each 11-car set originally contained two six-door SaHa E230 trailer cars (cars 7 and 10) with six pairs of doors per side and bench seats that were folded up until 10 a.m. on weekdays to provide standing room only during the morning peak. From 22 February 2010, the seats were able to be used during the morning peak. The two six-door cars in each set were subsequently replaced by a new build of four-door trailer cars between February 2010 and August 2011, to standardize door spacing ahead of the introduction of platform doors on all Yamanote Line stations by 2017. The new SaHa E231-600 cars (new car 7) incorporated some elements from the newer E233 series (most notably seats and handrails). Meanwhile, the new SaHa E231-4600 cars (new car 10) were built almost fully to E233 series standards; they also have an irregular door spacing corresponding to the driving cars of Keihin-Tohoku Line E233-1000 series sets, which occasionally have to share the same platforms during engineering work. This results in interior seating arranged 3-7-7-5-4, instead of the normal 3-7-7-7-3 arrangement. The first batch of replacement four-door SaHa E231-600 and SaHa E231-4600 cars were delivered from JR East's Niitsu factory on 1 February 2010. A Yamanote Line 11-car set in June 2018 In October 2014, former Yamanote Line set 520 was released from overhaul as a ten-car set, numbered A520, allocated to Mitaka Depot, and finished in the yellow Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line livery. It entered revenue service on the Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line from 1 December 2014. A second set, former Yamanote Line set 540 was converted to a ten-car set for use on the Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line in May 2016, renumbered A540. Between 2017 and 2020, the remaining sets were transferred to the Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line as the E235 series continues to replace them on the Yamanote Line. 48 of the 52 SaHa E231-4600 cars built from 2010 to 2011 were updated to E235 series standards (and re-numbered SaHa E235-4600), while the remaining 4 cars are stored in Tokyo General Rolling Stock Centre. The last set of E231-500 (Set 506) on the Yamanote Line finished service in January 2020 and was converted for service on the Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line as set A506. === Lines served === * Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line === Former operations === * Yamanote Line ===Formations=== ====10-car Ch\u016b\u014d\u2013S\u014dbu Line sets==== , 52 ten-car sets (A501-A552) are based at Mitaka depot in Tokyo and formed as shown below with six motored (\"M\") cars and four non-powered trailer (\"T\") cars. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |style=\"background-color:#ccc;\"| |colspan=\"10\"| \u2190 Chiba, Tsudanuma Nakano, Mitaka \u2192 |-style=\"line-height: 10px; background-color: #FFD400;\" |colspan=\"11\" style=\"padding:0; border:0;\"| |- !
