He authored the hadith collection known as Sahih al- Bukhari, regarded by Sunni Muslims as the most authentic (sahih) hadith collections. He also wrote other books such as Al-Adab al-Mufrad.Al-Adab al- Mufrad. == Biography == ===Birth=== Muhammad ibn Isma\u02bfil al-Bukhari al-Ju\u02bffi was born after the Jumu'ah prayer on Friday, 21 July 810 (13 Shawwal 194 AH) in the city of Bukhara in Transoxiana (in present-day Uzbekistan). His father, Ismail ibn Ibrahim, a scholar of hadith, was a student and associate of Malik ibn Anas. Some Iraqi scholars related hadith narrations from him. ===Lineage=== Imam Bukhari's great-grandfather, al-Mughirah, settled in Bukhara after accepting Islam at the hands of Bukhara's governor, Yaman al- Ju\u02bffi. As was the custom, he became a mawla of Yaman, and his family continued to carry the nisbah of \"al-Ju\u02bffi\". Al-Mughirah's father, Bardizbah, is the earliest known ancestor of Bukhari according to most scholars and historians. Bardizbah was a Zoroastrian Magi, and died as such. As-Subki is the only scholar to name Bardizbah's father, who he says was named Bazzabah (). Little is known of either Bardizbah or Bazzabah, except that they were Persian and followed the religion of their people. Historians have also not come across any information on Bukhari's grandfather, Ibrahim ibn al-Mughirah. ===Hadith studies and travels=== The historian al-Dhahabi described his early academic life: Bukhari's travels seeking and studying hadith. At the age of sixteen, he, together with his brother and widowed mother, made the pilgrimage to Mecca. From there he made a series of travels in order to increase his knowledge of hadith. He went through all the important centres of Islamic learning of his time, talked to scholars and exchanged information on hadith. It is said that he heard from over 1,000 men, and learned over 600,000 traditions. After sixteen years absence, he returned to Bukhara, and there he drew up his al-Jami' as-Sahih, a collection of 7,275 tested traditions, arranged in chapters so as to afford a basis for a complete system of jurisprudence without the use of speculative law. His book is highly regarded among Sunni Muslims, and considered the most authentic collection of hadith, even ahead of the Muwatta Imam Malik and Sahih Muslim of Bukhari's student Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj. Most Sunni scholars consider it second only to the Quran in terms of authenticity. He also composed other books, including al-Adab al- Mufrad, which is a collection of hadiths on ethics and manners, as well as two books containing biographies of hadith narrators (see isnad). === Last years === In the year 864/250, he settled in Nishapur. It was in Nishapur that he met Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj. He would be considered his student, and eventually collector and organiser of hadith collection Sahih Muslim which is considered second only to that of al-Bukhari. Political problems led him to move to Khartank, a village near Samarkand where he died in the year 870/256. == Mausoleum == Imam Al Bukhari Memorial Today his tomb lies within the Imam al- Bukhari Complex, in Hartang Village, 25 kilometers from Samarkand. It was restored in 1998 after centuries of neglect and dilapidation. The mausoleum complex consists of Imam al-Bukhari's tomb, a mosque, a madrassah, library, and a small collection of Qurans. The modern ground level mausoleum tombstone of Imam Bukhari is only a cenotaph, the actual grave lies within a small burial crypt below the modern structure. == Writings == Below is a summary of the discussion of Bukhari's available works in Fihrist Mu\u1e63annaf\u0101t al-Bukh\u0101ri by Umm 'Abdull\u0101h bint Ma\u1e25r\u016bs, Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u1e24amza and Ma\u1e25m\u016bd ibn Mu\u1e25ammad.Fihris Mu\u1e63annaf\u0101t al-Bukh\u0101ri, pp. 9-61, D\u0101r al-'\u0100\u1e63imah, Riya\u1e0d: 1410. === Works describing narrators of hadith === Bukhari wrote three works discussing narrators of hadith with respect to their ability in conveying their material: the \"brief compendium of hadith narrators,\" \"the medium compendium\" and the \"large compendium\" * Al-Tarikh al-Kab\u012br (Eng: The great history) known as al-Tar\u012bkh al-\u1e62agh\u012br, and al-Tar\u012bkh al-Awsa\u0163). The large compendium is published and well-identified. The medium compendium was thought to be the brief collection and was published as such. The brief compendium has yet to be found.Fihris Musannaf\u0101t al-Bukh\u0101ri, pp. 28-30. Another work, al- Kun\u0101, is on patronymics: identifying people who are commonly known as \"Father of so-and-so\". Then there is a brief work on weak narrators: al-\u1e0cu'af\u0101 al- \u1e62agh\u012br. ===\u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25 al-Bukhar\u012b & extant hadith=== Two of Bukhari's works on hadith survive: *\u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25 al-Bukhar\u012bfull title, al-J\u0101mi\u2019 al-Musnad al-Sah\u012bh al- Mukhta\u1e63ar min um\u016br Ras\u00fbl All\u0101h wa sunnanihi wa ayy\u0101mihi \"Collection of Selected True Reports of the Prophet, his Practices and Times\"); al-Bukhar\u012b's famous magnum opus. [Note: these al-Musnad are reports with chains of narration that go back to the Prophet.] *Al-Adab al-Mufrad ; hadith on respect and propriety. ==Theological Views== Bukhari was a follower of early Sunni theologian (mutakallim) Ibn Kullab in creed,Wahab, Muhammad Rashidi, and Syed Hadzrullathfi Syed Omar. \"Peringkat Pemikiran Imam al-Ash\u2019ari Dalam Akidah.\" International Journal of Islamic Thought 3 (2013): 58-70. \"Disebabkan itu, al- Bukhari dalam kebanyakan perkara berkaitan dengan persoalan akidah dikatakan akan mengambil pendapat Ibn Kullab dan al-Karabisi(al-'Asqalani 2001: 1/293)\" preaching that one's recitation of the Qur'an is created, whilst the Qur'an itself is uncreated.Azmi, Ahmad Sanusi. \"Ahl al-Hadith Methodologies on Qur'anic Discourses in the Ninth Century: A Comparative Analysis of Ibn Hanbal and al-Bukhari.\" Online Journal of Research in Islamic Studies 4.1 (2017): 17-26.Melchert, Christopher. \"The Piety of the Hadith folk.\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 34.3 (2002): 425-439. \"Hadith folk in Baghdad warned those of Nishapur against the famous traditionist Bukhari, whom they then drove from the city for suggesting one's pronunciation of the Qur'an was created\" Reacting to such teaching, the hadith scholars of Baghdad warned the people of Nishapur against him, had him imprisoned and then drove him out of the city. Other followers of Ibn Kullab, such as Harith al-Muhasibi, were also criticised and made to relocate.Shakir, Zaid. \"Treatise for the Seekers of Guidance.\" NID Publishers, 2008. Away from discussions relating to God's speech, Bukhari also repudiated rejection of Qadar (the divine decree) in his Sahih by quoting a verse of the Quran implying that God had already determined all human acts with a precise determining. According to Ibn Hajar, Bukhari signified that if someone was to accept autonomy in creating his acts, he would be assumed to be playing God's role and so would subsequently be declared a polytheist. In another chapter, Bukhari refutes the creeds of the Kharijites, and according to al-Ayni, the heading of that chapter was designed not only to refute the Kharijites but also any who held similar beliefs. === Interpretation of God's attributes === In Sahih al-Bukhari, in the book entitled \"Tafsir al-Qur'an wa 'ibaratih\" [i.e., Exegesis of the Qur'an and its expressions], surat al-Qasas, verse 88: \"kullu shay'in halikun illa Wajhah\" [the literal meaning of which is \"everything will perish except His Face\"], he said the term [illa Wajhah] means: \"except His Sovereignty/Dominance\". And there is [in this same chapter] other than that in terms of ta'wil (metaphorical interpretation), like the term 'dahk' () which is narrated in a hadith, [which is interpreted by] His Mercy. == School of thought == Many are of the opinion that Bukhari was a mujtahid with his own school of jurisprudence.Mughal, Justice R. Dr, and Munir Ahmad. \"Imam Bukhari (\u0631\u062d\u0645\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u06c1 \u0639\u0644\u06cc\u06c1) Was a Mujtahid Mutlaq.\" Available at SSRN 2049357 (2012).Sattar, Abdul. \"Konstruksi Fiqh Bukhari dalam Kitab al-Jami\u2019al-Shahih.\" De Jure: Jurnal Hukum dan Syar'iah 3.1 (2011).Masrur, Ali, and Imam Zainuddin Az-Zubaidi. \"Imam Muhammad bin Ismail al-Bukhari (194-256 H): Kolektor Hadis Nabi Saw. paling unggul di Dunia Islam.\" (2018): 1-16.Hasyim, Muh Fathoni. \"FIKIH IMAM AL- BUKHAR1.\" (2009). Bukhari has however been claimed as a follower of the Hanbali school,Imam al-Bukhari. (d. 256/870; Tabaqat al-Shafi'iya, 2.212-14 [6]) although members of the Shafi'i and \u1e92\u0101hir\u012b schools levy this claim as well.Falih al-Dhibyani, Al-zahiriyya hiya al-madhhab al-awwal, wa al- mutakallimun 'anha yahrifun bima la ya'rifun . Interview with Abdul Aziz al- Harbi for Okaz. 15 July 2006, Iss. #1824. Photography by Salih Ba Habri. JRD Mughal and Munir Ahmad assert that historically most jurists considered him to be a muhaddith and not a jurist, and that as a muhaddith they thought that he followed the Shafi'i school.Mughal, Justice R. Dr, and Munir Ahmad. \"Imam Bukhari (\u0631\u062d\u0645\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u06c1 \u0639\u0644\u06cc\u06c1) Was a Mujtahid Mutlaq.\" Available at SSRN 2049357 (2012). However, both go on to evidence the opinion that he was an absolute scholar of independent reasoning (Mujatahid Mutlaq).Mughal, Justice R. Dr, and Munir Ahmad. \"Imam Bukhari (\u0631\u062d\u0645\u06c3 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u06c1 \u0639\u0644\u06cc\u06c1) Was a Mujtahid Mutlaq.\" Available at SSRN 2049357 (2012). Scott Lucas argues that Bukhari's legal positions were similar to those of the \u1e92\u0101hir\u012bs and Hanbalis of his time, suggesting Bukhari rejected qiyas and other forms of ra'y completely. He makes comparisons between Bukhari's positions and those of Ibn Hazm. ==Early Islamic scholars== == References == === Citations === === Sources === * Bukhari, Imam (194-256H) \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064f\u062e\u0627\u0631\u064a; An educational Encyclopedia of Islam; Syed Iqbal Zaheer == Further reading == ===Primary=== * Encyclopedia of Sahih Al-Bukhari by Arabic Virtual Translation Center (New York 2019, Barnes & Noble ) * al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b, al- J\u0101mi\u02bf al-\u1e63a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25, 9 vols.
