Nevertheless, on September 20, 1990 at the age of 27, Stephens made his Major League debut. Even though he went 1 for 3 in his Major League debut with his first Major League hit being a home run, his career never quite panned out-he hit only .133 in his rookie year (his second of two hits that season was a double, though). His career average ended up being .171. In the field, he made zero errors over the course of his career for a 1.000 fielding percentage. Stephens played his final professional game on October 3, 1992 at the age of 29. ==Other information== *He earned $100,000 in 1990 and $179,000 in 1992. *In 1990 and 1991, he wore the number 54.
