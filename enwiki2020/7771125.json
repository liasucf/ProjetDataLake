Later an ice hockey hall was added. In the early 1990s the city of Assen became the owner of the sports complex. The speed skating track became semi-indoors and a subtropic swimming pool was added. In 2009 De Smelt was bought by Jan Smit, who changed the name to De Bonte Wever. In 2010 a hotel was built near the complex. ==Events== *1973 ISU Allround World Junior Championships *1975 ISU Women's Allround World Championships *1980 ISU Allround World Junior Championships *1982 ISU Men's Allround World Championships *1984 ISU Allround World Junior Championships *2006-2009 Dutch Open Dance Sport Championships *2007 KNSB Dutch Single Distance Championships ==Track records== *400 m Ice Track Cycling flying lap World Record (33,18) 2015-12-11 / icetrack cycling *500 m (m): Gerard van Velde (36,19) *500 m (w): Marianne Timmer (39,49) *1000 m (m): Beorn Nijenhuis (1.11,31) *1000 m (w): Ireen W\u00fcst (1.18,88) 2006-11-04 *1500 m (m): Beorn Nijenhuis (1.49,09) *1500 m (w): Ireen W\u00fcst (2.02,84) 2006-11-05 *3000 m (m): Rhian Ket (3.54,30) *3000 m (w): Renate Groenewold (4.14,98) 2006-11-04 *5000 m (m): Sven Kramer (6.31,34) 2006-11-03 *5000 m (w): Jenita Hulzebosch-Smit (7.15,76) *10000 m (m): Sven Kramer (13.32,70) 2006-11-05 Category:Indoor arenas in the Netherlands Category:Speed skating venues in the Netherlands Category:Sports venues in Drenthe Category:Sport in Assen Category:Buildings and structures in Assen ",
