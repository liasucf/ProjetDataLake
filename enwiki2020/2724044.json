    "text": "Clitoria is a genus of mainly tropical and subtropical, insect-pollinated flowering pea vines. ==Taxonomy== ===Naming of the genus=== This genus was named after the human clitoris, for the flowers bear a resemblance to the vulva. Originally the first described species of the genus was given the name Flos clitoridis ternatensibus in 1678 by Rumpf, a German-born botanist employed by the Dutch East India Company. It was regarded as appropriately named by Johann Philipp Breyne in 1747. Many vernacular names of these flowers in different languages are similarly based on references to female external genitalia.Clitoria ternatea Controversies existed in the past among botanists regarding the good taste of the naming of the genus. The analogy drew sharp criticism from botanists such as James Edward Smith in 1807, Amos Eaton in 1817, Michel \u00c9tienne Descourtilz in 1826, and Eaton and Wright in 1840. Some less explicit alternatives, like Vexillaria (Eaton 1817) and Nauchea (Descourtilz 1826), were proposed, but they failed to prosper, and the name Clitoria has survived to this day. ===Species=== Blue and white varieties of Clitoria ternatea *Clitoria albiflora Mattei *Clitoria amazonum Benth. *Clitoria andrei Fantz *Clitoria angustifolia Kunth *Clitoria annua J.
