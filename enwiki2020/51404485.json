    "text": "Following is a table of United States presidential elections in Ohio, ordered by year. Since its admission to statehood in 1803, Ohio has participated in every U.S. presidential election. Ohio is considered a swing state, being won by either the Democratic or Republican candidates from election to election. As a swing state, Ohio is usually targeted by both major-party campaigns, especially in competitive elections. Pivotal in the election of 1888, Ohio has been a regular swing state since 1980.Trolling the Campuses for Swing-State Votes , Julie Salamon, \"The New York Times\", October 2, 2004Game Theory for Swingers , Jordan Ellenberg, \"Slate.com\", October 25, 2004 Additionally, Ohio is considered a bellwether. Historian R. Douglas Hurt asserts that not since Virginia \"had a state made such a mark on national political affairs\".Holli (1999), p. 162. The Economist notes that \"This slice of the mid-west contains a bit of everything American\u2014part north-eastern and part southern, part urban and part rural, part hardscrabble poverty and part booming suburb\".\" A grain of sand for your thoughts\" , The Economist, December 20, 2005. Retrieved December 23, 2005. In the 31 elections from 1896, Ohio has had only two misses in the general election (Thomas E. Dewey in 1944 and Richard Nixon in 1960) and has the longest perfect streak of any state, voting for the winning presidential candidate in each election since 1964, and in 33 of the 37 held since the Civil War. No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio, and since the advent of the modern two-party system, only two Democrats have ever won the presidency without winning Ohio: Grover Cleveland in 1884/1892 and John F. Kennedy in 1960. Winners of the state are in bold. Party abbreviations: * D = Democratic * R = Republican * D-R = Democratic-Republican * Fed. = Federalist * Prog. = Progressive (three distinct parties in 1912, 1924 and 1948, respectively) * Am. Ind. = American Independent Party (1968) * States' Rights D = States' Rights Democrats (\"Dixiecrats\") of 1948 * Lib.

The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of slavery, spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the American Civil War. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become President, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\"} |- !

After none of the candidates had a majority on the electoral college, Adams won the contingent election in the House of Representatives. ==Elections of 1816 and 1820== In the election of 1820, incumbent President James Monroe ran effectively unopposed, winning all eight of Ohio\u2019s electoral votes, and all electoral votes nationwide except one vote in New Hampshire. To the extent that a popular vote was held, it was primarily directed to filling the office of Vice President. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Winner (nationally) !
