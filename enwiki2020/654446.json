According to the 2000 US Census Hatillo is spread over nine barrios and Hatillo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. ==History== Agust\u00edn Ruiz Miranda, a Canarian immigrant, founded Hatillo on approximately ten (a cuerda is 0.97 acre, also called a Spanish acre) in 1823. Miranda granted this land on the condition that public buildings be erected and wide streets be built, and that the remaining land be sold or used for homes. In its first year, Hatillo had 910 people; increasing to 2,663 inhabitants the following year distributed among the central town and the barrios of Carrizales, Cap\u00e1ez, Naranjito, Corcovado, Buena Vista, (formerly Yeguada Occidental), Campo Alegre, (formerly Yeguada Oriental), Pajuil, Bayaney, Aibonito, and Barrio Pueblo. Barrio Pajuil had disappeared by the 1940 census being divided up between Buena Vista, Naranjito, Corcovado and Campo Alegre barrios. There were also two sugarcane plantations named \u201cHacienda Santa Rosa\u201d measuring 150 and \u201cHacienda Perseverancia\u201d at 50 . The United States took control of Puerto Rico from Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Espino barrio was 1,148. Hatillo, like several other municipalities on the island, experienced boundary changes from the 1902 municipality consolidation law (Consolidaci\u00f3n de Ciertos T\u00e9rminos Municipales de Puerto Rico) in which Hatillo was annexed temporarily into neighboring Camuy. Three years later the territorial legislature approved the reformation of Hatillo as a separate municipality (independent town) from Camuy in 1905. In 1910, Barrio Pueblo (rural) changed its name to Hatillo barrio (rural). In 1930, Yeguadilla Occidental and Yeguadilla Oriental barrios' names were changed to Buena Vista and Campo Alegre, respectively. As mentioned before, Pajuil barrio disappeared by the 1940 census being divided up between barrios Buena Vista, Naranjito, Corcovado and Campo Alegre. In 1947 the Planning Commission of Puerto Rico issued a new map of Hatillo municipality and its barrios. As a result of this new map, the central town was expanded to include part of Hatillo barrio (rural) and the name of \u201cCorcovados\u201d was changed to \"Corcovado\u201d. ===Hurricane Maria=== Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Hatillo with the significant amount of rainfall. == Geography == Hatillo is a coastal town on the northern side of Puerto Rico.
