    "text": "Chembe is a new District pronounced by President Michael Sata in the Luapula Province of Zambia. It once had the Chembe Ferry as a means of crossing the Luapula River from DR Congo to Zambia; but now, it is the home of the Mwanawasa Bridge, named after former president Levy Mwanawasa. The Mwanawasa Bridge connects the principal Luapula highway to the Congo Pedicle road, a dirt highway maintained by Zambia through Congolese territory to link Mansa (formerly known as Fort Rosebery) to the Copperbelt. == Infrastructure == The 350-metre bridge has helped transportation difficulties brought about by the Chembe Ferry of old. With the pronouncement of Chembe as a new District, it has seen significant economic growth. == Population == In 2010 Chembe district had 23,394 inhabitants, and in 2019 the district was projected to go to a number of up to 28,919. ==References== * Camerapix: Spectrum Guide to Zambia.
