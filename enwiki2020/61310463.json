Constructed in four weeks. It arrived and was installed in 12 hours by 300 workers. One ring of the lower level served as a pit for the 60-member Los Angeles Olympic Symphony Orchestra. The three other rings were filled with water 6 inches deep. The ceremony was directed by David Wolper and Tommy Walker. They also hired producer Daniel Flannery and his production company. Flannery was the conceptualist working directly with David Wolper and Tommy Walker. Once the ceremonies were conceived the LAOOC contracted Flannery to produce and his firm to supervise the special effects and special lighting of the Ceremony. This included designing the famous spaceship and alien. Flashlights were given to all 92,000 attendees. Three colors were interchangeable, red white and blue. Coliseum announcer was Charles Corsen. During a pre-recorded interview during the ABC broadcast, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch, declared to Peter Jennings the games were a \"10\" out of 1-10. The Marathon began at 5:00 PM, before the start of the ceremony. The finish line was the Coliseum. A couple runners staggered in with cheers from the crowd. Marathon winners were awarded their medals with Portugal's Carlos Lopes being awarded the gold. His national anthem was played. Traditionally, the final equestrian event was also held at the Olympic Stadiums in past games, the day of the closing ceremony. Los Angeles held the event the day before, elsewhere. It was changed as to not damage the coliseum field or stage prep. Instead the three medal winners rode in on horseback, paraded to the medal podium during the pre ceremony. After the US anthem was played for gold medal winner Joseph Fargis, they took a victory lap again on horseback around the coliseum with cheers from the crowd. ==Ceremony== As in the opening ceremony, city church bells rang to commence the start of the ceremony. === Parade of Nations === In previous Olympic Games, only six athletes from each countries delegation were allowed to attend the closing ceremony.
