    "text": "A smallholding or smallholder is a small farm operating under a small-scale agriculture model. Definitions vary widely for what constitutes a smallholder or small-scale farm, including factors such as size, food production technique or technology, involvement of family in labor and economic impact. Smallholdings are usually farms supporting a single family with a mixture of cash crops and subsistence farming. As a country becomes more affluent, smallholdings may not be self-sufficient, but are valued primarily for the rural lifestyle that they provide for the owners, who often do not earn their livelihood from the farm. As the sustainable food and local food movements grow in affluent countries, some of these smallholdings are gaining increased economic viability. There are an estimated 500 million smallholder farms in the world, supporting almost two billion people. Small scale agriculture is often in tension with industrial agriculture, which finds efficiencies by increasing outputs, monoculture, consolidating land under big agricultural operations, and economies of scale. Certain labor intensive cash-crops, such as cocoa production in Ghana or Cote d'Ivoire, rely heavily on small holders; globally, as of 2008 90% of cocoa is grown by smallholders. Similar supply chains exist in other crops like coffee, palm oil, and bananas. In other markets, the importance of small scale agriculture in local economies has also increased food system investment in small holders. Today some companies try to include smallholdings into their value chain, providing seed, feed or fertilizer to improve production. Some say that this model shows benefits for both parties. Because smallholding farms frequently require less industrial inputs and can be an important way to improve food security in less developed contexts, addressing the productivity and financial sustainability of small holders is an international development priority and measured by indicator 2.3 of Sustainable Development Goal 2. In some geographies, pressure from land grabbing by industrial agriculture and soil degradation can lead small holders seeking economic viability to destroy local ecosystems and biodiversity. Increasing productivity, especially amongst small holder farms, is an important way to decrease the amount of land needed for farming and slow environmental degradation through processes like deforestation. Since agriculture has such large impacts on climate change, Project Drawdown described \"Sustainable Intensification for Smallholders\" an important method for climate change mitigation. == Productivity == Small farms have many economic advantages. Local farmers generate a local economy in their rural communities. An American study showed that small farms with incomes of $100,000 or less spend almost 95 percent of their farm-related expenses within their local communities. The same study took in comparison the fact that farms with incomes greater than $900,000 spend less than 20 percent of their farm- related expenses in the local economy. Thus, small-scale agriculture supports local economy. Agricultural productivity is variously measured, and large- scale farming is often less efficient than small sustainable farms. Industrial single crop creates a high output per worker whilst, small-scale farmers produce more food per acre of land. Small-scale agriculture often sell products directly to the consumers. Disintermediation gives the farmer the profit that would otherwise go to the wholesaler, the distributor and the supermarket. About two thirds of the selling price would actually be lost for product marketing. Meanwhile, if farmers sell their products directly to consumers, they recover the totality of their product == Commonwealth countries == === Smallholdings in Britain === In British English usage, a smallholding is a piece of land and its adjacent living quarters for the smallholder and stabling for farm animals. It is usually smaller than a farm but larger than an allotment, usually under . It is often established for breeding farm animals organically on free-range pastures. Alternatively, the smallholder may concentrate on growing vegetables by traditional methods or, in a more modern way, using plastic covers, polytunneling or cloches for quick growth. Generally, a smallholding offers its owner a means of achieving self- sufficiency for its family's needs. They may be able to supplement their income by selling surplus produce at a farmers' market or at a permanent shop on the smallholding. === Hobby farms in Australia === In Western Australia, many small acre farms were established under the Agricultural Land Purchase Act to encourage settlement. The government purchased large land grants held by absentee owners and subdivided them according to the best use for the land: the development of orchids in Coondle, viticulture, horse breeding, sheep grazing, and high density crops like corn, and broad acre crops like wheat. A hobby farm in Australia is a variety of smallholding that may be as small as 2 hectares up to a self-sustaining farm size, that allows the \"city farmer\" to have a house and a small number of animals or small crop fields or grape vines. In Western Australia, they are often termed Special Rural Properties for planning purposes. === Lifestyle blocks in New Zealand === In New Zealand, a lifestyle block is a smallholding valued primarily for the rural lifestyle it affords. Planning restrictions on subdividing farm land often lead to the creation of lifestyle blocks of minimum permissible size near urban areas. == Developing countries == In many developing countries, a smallholding is a small plot of land with low rental value, used to grow crops.Bunnett, R.B. (2002). Interactive Geography 4, pp. 125, 315. SNP Pan Pacific Publishing. . By some estimates, there are 525 million smallholder farmers in the world.Nagayets,Oksana (2005). The Future of Small Farms. International Food Policy Research Institute and Overseas Development Institute Vision 2020 Initiative, p. 356. Smallholders dominate production in certain key sectors such as coffee and cocoa. Various types of agribusinesses work with smallholding farmers in a range of roles including buying crops, providing seed, and acting as financial institutions.International Finance Corporation (2013). Working with Smallholders: A Handbook for Firms Building Sustainable Supply Chains, p. 12. http://www.farms2firms.org In low income countries, women make up 43 percent of small holding agricultural labor, but produce 60-80 of food crops. ===Thailand=== In 1975, there were 4.2 million smallholder farming households in Thailand. In 2013, Thailand had 5.9 million smallholder farming households. The average area of these smallholdings had shrunk from 3.7 hectares to 3.2 hectares over that period. Instead of farms getting larger and less numerous, as has been the case in the Global North, the reverse happened: they got smaller and more numerous. == See also == * Urban agriculture == References == == Further reading == * This provides an extensive historical and global view as of the early 20th century. == External links == * Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation's (SDC) videos on Smallscale and Family Farms Challenges and Opportunities Category:Agriculture by type Category:Land management Category:Human habitats ms:Kebun kecil ",
