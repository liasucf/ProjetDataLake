    "text": "Spanish West Africa (, AOE) was a grouping of Spanish colonies along the Atlantic coast of northwest Africa. It was formed in 1946 by joining the southern zone of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, the colony of Ifni and the colony of Spanish Sahara into a single administrative unit. Following the Ifni War (1957\u201358), Spain ceded the southern protectorate to Morocco and created separate provinces for Ifni and the Sahara in 1958.Shannon E.

Spanish West Africa was formed by a decree of 20 July 1946. The new governor sat at Ifni. He was ex officio the delegate of the Spanish high commissioner in Morocco in the southern zone of the protectorate, to facilitate its government along the same lines as the other Spanish possessions on the coast. On 12 July 1947, Ifni and the Sahara were raised into distinct entities, but still under the authority of the governor in Ifni. On 10 and 14 January 1958, respectively, the Sahara and Ifni were raised into regular Spanish provinces completely independent of one another.Robert R\u00e9zette, The Western Sahara and the Frontiers of Morocco (Nouvelles \u00c9ditions Latines, 1975), p. 101.Jos\u00e9 Luis Villanova, \"La organizaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica del territorio de Ifni duranta la dominaci\u00f3n colonial espa\u00f1ola (1934\u20131969)\", Anales: Revista de Estudios Ib\u00e9ricos e Iberoamericanos 3 (2007): 49\u201382, esp. 62\u201372. == Governors == == References == ==Further reading== *Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rodriguez Esteban, \"El Mapa del \u00c1frica Occidental Espa\u00f1ola de 1949 a escala 1:500.000: orgullo militar, camelladas y juegos po\u00e9ticos saharauis\", Cybergeo: European Journal of Geography.
