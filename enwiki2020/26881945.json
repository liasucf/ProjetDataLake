The village lies 42 kilometers south of the city of Vlor\u00eb and about the same distance north of the southern city of Sarand\u00eb. It is built on a slope of the Ceraunian Mountains at approximately 200 meters in altitude, and comprises three neighborhoods: Gjilek, Kondraq (also known as Kallam), and Dh\u00ebrmi itself. The mountains descend to the southwest into the Ionian coast and Corfu in the distance to the south. Nearby is the village of Palas\u00eb. The inhabitants of Dh\u00ebrmi mainly speak a variant of the Greek Himariote dialect, characterized by archaic features not retained in standard Greek.Nicholas (1998) p. 20 Recently , the coastal area has seen a boom in the construction of accommodation facilities, such as wooden villa complexes. ==History== The foundation of the village is lost in the history. Himara, where Dhermi is included, was inhabited by the Epirote tribe of Chaonians. Around 1627-1633 a Greek-language school was founded in Dh\u00ebrmi.Gregori\u010d, 2008: p. 67. The first Albanian school in the village was operating in 1632.https://books.google.nl/books?id=TwC5AAAAIAAJ&q;=Shkolla+shqipe+e+dhermiut&dq;=Shkolla+shqipe+e+dhermiut&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiMlIqM47fdAhWK_aQKHeGEBlMQ6AEIJzAA, p.224 Additional Greek schools operated by 1682 with the support of the local bishopric of Himara. During the 17th century (precise year is unknown) another Greek school (the Vizilios School) opened under the sponsorship of a local benefactor. In the 1898-1899 school season three Greek schools were operating: elementary, secondary and a girls' school. At November 5, 1912, when the nearby town of Himara was controlled by the Greek forces of the local major Spyros Spyromilios, armed groups from Dhermi declared that they were prepared to assist his movement for the incorporation of the rest of the region into Greece. ==Economy== The main activity is tourism. ==Landmarks== View of Gjipe *Dh\u00ebrmi Beach *Alevra *Bay of Grama *The Pirates' cave *The harbor of Gjipe *Hypapante Church, Dh\u00ebrmi *Panagia Monastery Church, Dh\u00ebrmi *St. Stephen's Church, Dh\u00ebrmi == Notable people == *Panos Bitsilis, Greek revolutionary. *Petro Marko, Albanian writer and founding father of modern Albanian prose. == Gallery == File:Albania,_Dhermi.jpg|Dhermi File:ALB_20070718_img_1402.jpg|Dhermi beach File: Dhermi_beach.jpg|Dh\u00ebrmi beach File: Dhermi_camp.jpg|Camp of Workers File: Dhermi_long_beach.jpg|Dh\u00ebrmi long beach File: Havana_beach_bar.jpg|Havana beach bar File: Llogara.JPG|The Ceraunian mountains (Llogara) File: Gogo_Leka.jpg|Gogo Leka ==See also== *Greeks in Albania *Palas\u00eb *Tourism in Albania *Albanian Riviera ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== * Region of Himara.
