He went on to earn a PhD from Birmingham University in 1990. He worked as lecturer at Ankara University from 1969 to 1971 and from 1978 to 1983. He took part in the founding of the Yale chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society.

He studies social and economic history (including that of Europe, especially medieval history) from a comparative perspective. He has also written on the construction of Turkish national memory. In September 2005, Berktay and fellow historians, including Murat Belge, Edhem Eldem, Selim Deringil, convened at an academic conference to discuss the fall of the Ottoman Empire.Conferences, personal Web site, Sabanci University.Didem Turkoglu, Challenging the National History--Competing discourses about a Conference, Submitted to Central European University Nationalism Studies Program In Partial Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts, Budapest, Hungary, 2006 As a supporter of open dialogue in Turkey regarding the Armenian Genocide and Turkey's denial of it, Berktay has received threats in his country. He has two daughters, Ada Berktay and Asl\u0131g\u00fcl Berktay, from two separate marriages. Berktay uncovered that the Turkish government purged a lot of the evidence and documents on the Armenian Genocide from the Turkish archives. According to him, the purge was \"most probably implemented by Muharrem Nuri Birgi, a former Turkish ambassador to London and NATO and Secretary General of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs\". Berktay also claimed that \"at the time he was combing the archives, Nuri Birgi met regularly with a mutual friend and at one point, referring to the Armenians, ruefully confessed: 'We really slaughtered them'\". == Partial bibliography == * Kabileden Feodalizme, Kaynak Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, 1983 * Cumhuriyet \u0130deolojisi ve Fuad K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc, Kaynak Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, 1983 * Bir D\u00f6nem Kapan\u0131rken, Pencere Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, 1991 * New Approaches to State and Peasant in Ottoman History (eds.
