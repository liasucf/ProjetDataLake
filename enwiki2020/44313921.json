He served as Secretary of Business and Economic Development of Maryland from 2003 to 2007, in the administration of Governor Robert Ehrlich. From 2007 to 2013, as head of Johns Hopkins University's technology transfer activities, he directed the commercialization of the US's largest-budgeted university-based research enterprise, overseeing the conversion to private sector application of the research output of a $2.106 billion budget for medical, science and engineering research in 2012, when Johns Hopkins led US universities in research spending for the 34th consecutive year.http://releases.jhu.edu/2014/01/06/research-funding/ In 2019 Melissaratos retired from as Dean of the Brown School of Business and Leadership at Stevenson University, a private university in Baltimore County, Maryland, a post he held for five years. In April 2020 he joined St John Properties, Inc, headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, a multi-billion-dollar commercial real estate development and investment firm active in Maryland, Colorado, Louisiana, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin, as Vice President of Corporate Education and Leadership Development. == Early life and education == Melissaratos was born to Greek parents in Galatz, Romania, on December 3, 1943. The following year the Soviet Union occupied Romania and implemented a process of Sovietization. In 1950 the Melissaratos family fled to Greece as refugees. In 1956 they emigrated to the US, settling in Baltimore where Melissaratos worked in, and later ran, a bakery with his father. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering at the Johns Hopkins University and a Master of Science in engineering management at George Washington University, and completed the Graduate Program for Management Development at Harvard University and graduate research in international relations at Catholic University of America.Maryland Dept. of Business and Economic Development Secretaries http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/12dbed/former/html/msa14046.html == Business career == In 1966 Melissaratos joined the Westinghouse Electric Corporation.

Ehrlich said Melissaratos's department would be the cornerstone of his administration. Explaining his willingness to work in a Republican Cabinet, Melissaratos said he saw himself as \"a bridge-builder\".Ehrlich appoints economic overseer (Baltimore Sun) http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-01-14/business/0301140035_1_ehrlich- electronic-systems-business-growth He said the basis of his economic policy would be a focus on Maryland's universities, which he regarded as potential economic powerhouses because of their research innovation capabilities. Melissaratos was popular in the business community and when Ehrlich was defeated in his bid for gubernatorial re-election, his successor, Democrat Martin O'Malley, came under pressure to retain Melissaratos in his Cabinet. The Baltimore Sun newspaper reported that at a conference in the boardroom of First Mariner Bank, \"business leader after business leader\" urged O'Malley to reappoint Melissaratos, who was described as \"the best marketing manager the state has had in recent memory\" and as a \"visionary\".Executives are pressing Melissaratos on O'Malley (Baltimore Sun) http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-12-06/business/0612060169_1_business- leader-omalley-aris However, Melissaratos took exception when he was asked to submit a resume to O'Malley. \"Everybody in the damn state knows me,\" he said. \"I don't need to audition for this job. The whole state sees the performance.\" O'Malley did not invite Melissaratos to stay on and he left his government post in January 2007.State business chief quits (Baltimore Sun) http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-01-17/business/0701170269_1_ehrlich- omalley-business-and-economic == Academic administration == In February 2007 the president of Johns Hopkins University, physician and engineer William R.
