    "text": "Classica Corsica is an elite men's road bicycle racing event held annually on the island of Corsica, a region of France. It is run two days before the Crit\u00e9rium International stage race, which has been held on Corsica every year since 2010. The Classica itself is a legacy event of the 2013 Tour de France, when the race held its Grand D\u00e9part and first three stages on the island. The event is UCI 1.1 rated and is part of the UCI Europe Tour. The route varies from year to year, but in its first edition, 2015, the race will depart Ajaccio and finish in Bastia after 204 km taking in the Col de Vizzavona and the Col de Bellagranajo, before flattening out in the second half of the stage, which represents essentially a reverse running of the second stage from the 2013 Tour. ==Winners== ==References== ==External links== * Category:Cycle races in France Category:UCI Europe Tour races Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2015 Category:2015 establishments in France ",
