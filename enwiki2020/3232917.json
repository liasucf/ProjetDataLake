    "text": "Boo Boo and the Man is a 2002 short cartoon starring Boo Boo Bear, the sidekick of Yogi Bear. It was made by The Ren & Stimpy Show creator John Kricfalusi and his company Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 using Macromedia Flash. The short was one of the last Web Premiere Toons shorts produced for Cartoon Network's official website. The cartoon centers around Boo Boo, who encounters with the group of mean teenage bear bullies. ==Plot== The cartoon starts where Boo Boo is happily skipping along in the forest of Jellystone Park, until he comes across the teenage cub bullies, who asks him about who is a \"big brown man\" with him. Boo Boo replies that the \"big brown man\" is his best friend Yogi. So as the mean bullies are having fun picking on Boo Boo with mean things (such as shaving his fur off of his tail, rubbing his tail into pink, and put a bee in his ear), Ranger Smith stops them, which causes the bullies to flee away, leaving Boo Boo injured. Ranger Smith helps poor Boo Boo up and Boo Boo asks the ranger about those bullies he met, wondering why they have to act mean to little bears. Smith then answers to Boo Boo that it's rough for the fact that the forest is rough on little fellow and tells him that he had to \"bear\" with a fact about fair life, right until Yogi shows up and asks Boo Boo if he want to tag along with him for a picnic goodies. After the two bears left, Ranger Smith breaks the fourth wall by telling the audience about although he still has his likes of Boo Boo since is surely a nice bear, he just didn't know what he sees in that..... man. The tree burps in his face before the cartoon cuts to credits. ==Voice cast== *Boo Boo Bear: John Kricfalusi *Sam: Keith Rainville *Ranger Smith: Corey Burton *Yogi Bear: Stephen Worth *Manny: Mike Fontanelli *Sock Bear: Paul Trauth *Angie: Derrick Wyatt *Pointy-Nosed Bear: Gabe Swarr ==Crew== *Directed by John Kricfalusi *Storyboard: Robyn Byrd *Story by John Kricfalusi and Robyn Byrd *Executive Producers: John Kricfalusi and Kevin Kolde *Executives in charge of Production at Cartoon Network: Sam Register and Pola Changnon *Creative Coordinator: Matt Schwartz *Music Selection: Stephen Worth *Layout: John Kricfalusi and Jos\u00e9 Pou ===Animation=== *John Kricfalusi *Jos\u00e9 Pou *Paul Trauth *Wil Branca *Gabe Swarr *Matt Danner ===Flash animation=== *Paul Trauth *Gabe Swarr *Wil Branca *Robyn Byrd ===Inking=== *Wil Branca *Luke Cormican *Jos\u00e9 Pou *Nick Cross *Kristy Gordon *Mike Kerr *Audra Brasseau *Fred Osmond *Ray Morelli ===Digital clean-up=== *Wil Branca *Luke Cormican *Jos\u00e9 Pou *Nick Cross *Cris Beaupre *Kristy Gordon *Mike Kerr *Audra Brasseau *Rich Behrle *Adam Shipman ==References== ==External links== * Category:Yogi Bear Category:Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 Category:2002 films Category:2000s American animated films Category:American films Category:American parody films ",
