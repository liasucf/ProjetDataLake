    "text": "Eisenstein is a 2000 Canadian film about Sergei Eisenstein, directed by Renny Bartlett and starring Simon McBurney, Raymond Coulthard and Jacqueline McKenzie. It was nominated for five Genie Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.\"Atanarjuat and War Bride lead Genie race\", Screen Daily, December 13, 2001. New York Times reviewer Stephen Holden wrote that the film was \"a series of loosely connected (and unevenly acted) theatrical sketches whose central theme is the director's shifting relationship with the Soviet government\", and that \"as dazzingly played\" by McBurney, the title character \"bears resemblances to everyone from the punk rocker Johnny Rotten to the contemporary director Peter Sellars.\"Stephen Holden, \"Meet Eisenstein: Punker, Misfit and Gay Renegade\", The New York Times, January 2, 2002. The Independent called it \"engagingly irreverent take on an important, tragic story\".\"Film: The Five Best Revivals\", The Independent, May 11, 2002. John Petrakis of the Chicago Tribune commented that director Bartlett seemed \"less interested in Eisenstein the filmmaker than he is in Eisenstein the political animal, gay man, Jewish target and artistic rebel\", and described the overall result as \"a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director's life\".John Petrakis, \"Movie review, 'Eisenstein'\", Chicago Tribune, August 22, 2002. Ed Gonzales of Slant Magazine gave the film a less favorable review, calling it \"efficient and concise but . . . lifeless\".Ed Gonzales, \"Movie review: Eisenstein\", Slant Magazine, December 21, 2001. ==References== ==External links== * * Simon McBurney, \"An act of insanity\", The Guardian, May 13, 2002 Category:2000 films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian drama films ",
