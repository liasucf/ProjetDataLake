In order to assure compliance with state and federal laws, the District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the administrative team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District obtains parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents or guardians, who believe their child is eligible, may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Carlynton School District Pupil Services Coordinator. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding.

For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.

Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2010 - 24.1500 mills.School District Tax Millages 2009 in Allegheny County, Allegheny County Treasurer's Office. May 5, 2010 *2009 - 24.1500 mills. *2008 - 24.1500 mills *2007 - 24.1500 mills ====Act 1 Adjusted index==== The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010-2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. The School District Adjusted Index for the Carlynton School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 4.6%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 4.2%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 5.4%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 5.2%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 3.6%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 1.7%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 2.1%, Base 1.7% For the 2011-12 school year the Carlynton School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Carlynton School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district\u2019s index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. For 2009 and 2010, the Carlynton School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Index limit. ====Property tax relief==== In 2010, property tax relief for Carlynton School District was set at $166 for 3,366 approved homesteads.Tax Relief per Homestead 2010, Pennsylvania Department of Education. May 1, 2010 In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Carlynton School District was $168 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 3,318 property owners applied for the tax relief. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Allegheny County, 60% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009.Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, 2-23-2010. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, so people who make substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. ===Enrollment and consolidation=== In 2011, the community of Rosslyn Farms initiated a process to secede from the Carlynton School District and join Chartiers Valley School District, a neighboring district. The reason cited is the chronically poor academic program outcomes at Carlynton School District. The community submitted a petition, signed by three fourths of the taxable residents in Rosslyn Farms, to the civil division of Common Pleas Court. According to district data, Rosslyn Farms sends 36 children to the district's schools and the remaining 34 children attend private schools. The state Department of Education projects a steady decline in enrollment in the district to 1374 pupils in 2020.Enrollment and Projections by LEA, Pennsylvania Department of Education, July 2010 A proposal has been put forward to consolidate Allegheny County school districts to save tax dollars and improve student services. The plan calls for a proposed district that includes Carlynton School District, Montour School District and Sto-Rox School District. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any school buildings. The study noted that while the best school districts spent 4% of the annual budget on administration, others spend over 15% on administration. In February 2009, Governor Edward Rendell proposed reducing the number of school districts in Pennsylvania from 500 to 100. He asserted that consolidation of adjacent school district administrations, in each county, would achieve substantial administrative cost savings. The proposal claimed that the savings could be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes.Pennsylvania Public School Enrollments by School District and LEA January 2009Rendell, E. & Soderberg, M. (2009). Pennsylvania school district consolidation. 2009-10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity. In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools.Study of the cost-effectiveness of consolidating Pennsylvania districts. New York: Standard & Poor\u2019s School Evaluation Services. 2007, p. 6. ==Extracurriculars== The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is set by school board policy and the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. == References == ==External links== * *http://kdka.com/local/Carlynton.High.School.2.389239.html *http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/68743 Category:School districts established in 1969 Category:School districts in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Category:Education in Pittsburgh area Category:1969 establishments in Pennsylvania ",
