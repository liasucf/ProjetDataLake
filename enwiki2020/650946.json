The CD was also released by Pickwick under the title \"The Best of Lonnie Donegan\". The first single from the album that was released was a version of Lead Belly's \"Rock Island Line\". It was the first debut record to go gold in the UK, and reached the Top 10 in the United States. One of the songs, \"My Old Man's a Dustman\", reached #1 in the UK Singles Chart in April 1960. It was ranked #29 on the \"Top 100 Hits of 1960\" chart from Canadian Top 40 radio station, CHUM.
