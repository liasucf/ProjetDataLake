    "text": "The Panorama Music Festival (commonly referred to as Panorama) is a multi-day music festival held on Randall's Island in New York City. It is presented by Goldenvoice. == History == Goldenvoice, the company behind Panorama, is a subsidiary of AEG Live. The same people who also produce Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Rock on the Range and other festivals around the world. The first Panorama took place in the summer of 2016 and was met with some controversy. Founder's Entertainment, the creators behind Governors Ball Music Festival, petitioned the city of New York and Mayor Bill de Blasio to have the date of Panorama changed. Founder's Entertainment major concern was that Panorama ticket sales would cut into their own festival's. De Blasio obliged and the festival was moved to 7-weeks after Gov Ball, rather than the original 2-weeks, to avoid compromised ticket sales == Panorama 2016 == The inaugural Panorama was held July 22 through July 24.
