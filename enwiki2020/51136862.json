The Lost Bible\u2019s English translator writes: If Eco plays with the detective story, at the lowest level \"The Lost Bible\" is an action thriller with the accent on horror, occasionally Gothic. Essentially, though, it's a conspiracy novel composed of infinitely small puzzle pieces whose sense can't be guessed till the end.... On this pretext of a novel with great mass appeal, Bergler has based a complex construction that betrays a much greater ambition, evident in the novel as a whole.... For the wider audience, though, the book's most important quality is its overwhelmingly visual character. Although full of information, stuffed with references and games at many levels, \"The Lost Bible\" isn't a book to read but to see, just like a favorite movie. \u2014 Jean Harris, \"The Lost Bible\", Translator's Afterward. == References == == External links == * *igorbergler.ro Category:2015 novels Category:Romanian novels ",
