In: Spiegel Online. 8 July 2017, retrieved 12 July 2017. === Sustainable development === There was no consensus with the USA regarding climate protection: a dissent with communalities in the deployment of renewable energy was formulated. The other 19 participants agreed to stick with the Paris agreement, to view it as irreversible and to swiftly put it into practice. After the summit finished, the Turkish president, Erdo\u011fan said his country would not ratify the Paris agreement; Turkey was no industrialized nation but a developing country like other neighboring countries of the region and that Fran\u00e7ois Hollande as then President had assured international assistance funds.

In a joint statement, G20 leaders vowed to take steps to prevent the internet from being used to spread propaganda. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi indirectly targeted Pakistan (which is not a member of G20) by naming terrorist organisations that operate from its soil and saying that the groups all share the same ideology and purpose \u2013 of spreading hate and killing people. Indonesian President Joko Widodo urged member states to unite to fight against terrorism and emphasized on preventive as well as de- radicalization programs.

Forty-five water cannons were available, and a no-fly zone was in place over portions of the city. == Protests and riots == Riots on the Schulterblatt Peaceful demonstration in boats, Binnenalster in Hamburg near town hall (2 July)The G20 summit was the main focus of German far left propaganda in 2017. More than 320 police officers were injured in the riots. Interior minister Horst Seehofer especially criticized that photos of police on duty during the summit were spread in the far left networks. Of the 1135 far-left violent incidents in that year in Germany, 832 occurred during the summit.A burnt BMW car after the first night of riots. In the weeks prior to the summit, sporadic car fires in remote places, such as the neighborhood of Blankenese, occurred regularly in the city. On the night of 18 June 2017, unidentified individuals in Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne, Dortmund, Leipzig, and Bad Bevensen caused a total of 13 arson attacks on tracks of the German railways. A security expert was quoted by the German press agency DPA as saying that a connection to left-wing extremism related to the upcoming G20 Summit was \"conceivable\". According to a German interior ministry spokesman, cable fires had been caused by \"unconventional explosive and incendiary devices\". In spite of high temperatures (30C, 86F) on 18 June, police discounted the possibility that the fires had been caused by hot weather. On 19 June, a group called \"Shutdown G20 \u2013 Hamburg vom Netz nehmen!\" claimed responsibility for the attacks in an internet post. On 2 July, Greenpeace activists forced a bulk freighter loaded with charcoal from Murmansk arriving in the city to stop. The police intervened and the vessel was allowed to pass through. During the G20 week a large variety of over 25 registered protest actions and marches were planned to take place in the city of Hamburg. They included an alternative Global Solidarity Summit from 5 to 6 July and a peaceful dance-protest-march Lieber tanz ich als g20 with between 11,000 and 20,000 people attending on 5 July. Around one thousand performance artists called 1000 Gestalten covered themselves in grey pigment and slowly walked through the streets like zombies. This performance was done to draw awareness of political apathy. After walking, they all removed their grey clothes. Underneath were colourful clothes that symbolized becoming engaged and awake. On 6 July, protests turned violent when over 160 police were injured in clashes with protestors and more than 75 people were arrested. As protestors attempted to storm into the \"red zone\" where the summit took place they were dispersed with water cannon. Some protestors stated their goal was to block the attendees route to the summit venue; US First Lady Melania Trump was unable to attend a harbor cruise on account of the protests. On 7 July rioters set dozens of parked cars on fire. Several shops were destroyed and looted during 7 July night-time riots in the Schanzenviertel area. Masked rioters and militants from the \"black bloc\" went uncontrolled for a period of three hours, prompting the deployment of special armed police forces to end the violence. On 8 July 76,000 people attended the largest peaceful protest march \"Solidarity without Borders\", organized by an alliance of 174 groups and organizations. On early Sunday morning, 9 July, riots continued in the Schanzenviertel though the G20 leaders had already departed; 144 rioters were arrested. In total, more than 15,000 police were deployed from across the country, while 100,000 protesters attended. Local residents believed that authorities made a mistake by having the summit in a densely populated area. Police arrested 186 people overall: 132 Germans, 8 French, 7 Italians, 5 Swiss and citizens of Russia and Spain. An additional 225 people were taken into temporary custody.\"Schweizer randalieren in der \"H\u00f6lle\"\" Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung vom 10. Juli 2017 In the analysis by German police, it was estimated that the far-left protesters had committed more than 2000 crimes, among them vandalism (575), bodily harm (330), disturbing the peace (303), arson (123) and resisting arrest (45). Activists and media criticised police reactions to the protests, accusing them of violence and intentional conflict escalation. The riots prompted debates in the Hamburg Senate on violence from leftist militants and how to mitigate further violence in the future. Researchers concluded that methods that had been successful in reducing violence from right-wing and Islamist militants could not be re-used against left-wing militants. === Investigations and trials === In January 2020 there were thousands of court proceedings underway, where police was processing 3580 cases. Police had identified 135 suspects which were sought with photographs. Also there were 156 complaints against police, 109 of which had been dismissed. Left politicians in the Hamburg council complained that no proceeding against police had started. In July 2020 five men, four from Hesse in Germany and one from France were found guilty on riot charges after a trial which lasted 18 months. The French citizen was found guilty of inciting arson, causing bodily harm and assaulting police and was sentenced to three years in prison. The four German defendants received probationary sentences or community service. The prosecutor had called for prison sentences for all five for committing arson. === Incidents === On the eve of the G20 summit in Hamburg, China's most famous political prisoner, democracy activist and Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, had been given medical parole after being diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. Turkey arrested 12 people in Istanbul on the eve of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017 during the \"digital security and information management workshop\". They included \u0130dil Eser, the head of Amnesty International Turkey. Activists detained included \u0130lknur \u00dcst\u00fcn of the Women's Coalition, lawyer G\u00fcnal Kur\u015fun and Veli Acu of the Human Rights Agenda Association. == References == 63.seven civil society groups that are an integral part of the G20 process. == External links == * with Summit Declaration of the Heads of State and Government, 'G20 leaders declaration' (PDF; 339 kb) Category:2017 conferences Category:2017 in Hamburg Category:2017 in international relations Category:21st-century diplomatic conferences Category:Diplomatic conferences in Germany 2017 Category:July 2017 events in Germany ",
