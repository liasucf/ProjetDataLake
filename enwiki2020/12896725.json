    "text": "Beach on Inchcruin Inchcruin is an island in Loch Lomond in Scotland. It is not to be confused with Creinch, which has occasionally been referred to as \"Inchcroin\". == Geography == Inchcruin is one of an island group just south of Luss. It is 3/4 of a mile long, and 50ft at its highest point. Its name means \"round island\" in the Scottish Gaelic language, although it is not round, but a rather jagged shape. It has a couple of beaches, and is wooded, with some open fields. Only a very narrow channel, called the Geggles separates Inchcruin from Inchmoan. At only a foot or two deep, it is sometimes possible to wade between the islands.Worsley, Harry Loch Lomond: The Loch, the Lairds and the Legends Lindsay Publications (Glasgow) 1988 ==History== The travel writer, H.V. Morton visited Loch Lomond in the 1930s, and mentions Inchcruin briefly and wrongly as \"Inchcruim\".Morton, H. V. In Scotland Again (1933), Methuen London - p145 In the 18th century it was used as an asylum for the insane.Garnett, T. (1800). Observations on a Tour of the Highlands ... London. V.1. p. 42. It contains one house, around 200 years old, which was inhabited in the past by people who farmed on the island. It is now a holiday retreat. The island is classified by the National Records of Scotland as an inhabited island that \"had no usual residents at the time of either the 2001 or 2011 censuses.\"The National Records of Scotland (2013) referred to \"Inchruin\", which is presumably a typographical error. ==See also== * List of islands of Scotland ==References== Cruin Category:Uninhabited islands of Stirling (council area) ",
