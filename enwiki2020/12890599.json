    "text": "The Screen Nation Film & TV Awards, formerly the bfm (black filmmaker) Film and TV Awards, was founded in September 2003 by independent film producer Charles Thompson MBE, as a platform to raise the profile of black British and international film and television talent of African heritage. ==Statuette== The Screen Nation Award statuette is based on a West African mask and was designed by Jamaican-born sculptor George \"Fowokan\" Kelly. \"The statuette signifies via the mask that there is a change coming. A mask takes you from one state into another and in this case from being unrecognized and unrewarded to being recognized and celebrated\". ==Awards== The Screen Nation Film and TV Awards are given at a televised event that normally takes place in October during UK Black History Month. The awards ceremony\u2014dubbed the \"Black BAFTAs\" by The Independent newspaper in 2003\u2014brings together actors, actresses, directors and filmmakers from the British and international film and TV industry.
