    "text": "Early Live Recordings is a compilation album by American singer-songwriter and musician Ariel Pink. It was released on December 17, 2013, through Human Ear Music record label. The album features Pink's early live recordings in the late 1990s and early 2000s under the aliases \"Gorilla\" and \"Appleasians\". The tracks were saved from the same series CD-R and eight-track cassettes that spawned Thrash & Burn, Ariel Pink's previously unreleased late-1990s musique concr\u00e8te album that was released in 2006 and reissued in 2012. The compilation also features a cover of the Shaggs song, \"My Cutie\". ==Critical reception== Allmusic critic Heather Phares gave the album a positive review, stating: \"Coupled with Thrash & Burn, Early Live Recordings delivers an entertainingly fleshed-out portrait of Pink's pre-Haunted Graffiti years.\" Andy Beta of Pitchfork was mixed in his assessment of the album, writing: \"While excavating the eight Haunted Graffiti albums revealed repulsive and alluring sounds in equal measure, Early Live Recordings only real crime is that little of it fascinates.\" ==Track listing== ;Gorilla # \"Berzerker\" # \"Logan's Run\" # \"Chunga\" # \"El Fantastic Summer, Pt. 1\" # \"Lila Lay\" # \"Die He Die\" # \"I'm Burning Up\" # \"Why Am I So Sad\" # \"Nazi Love\" # \"Darby's Revenge\" # \"Not Her Home Yet\" # \"I Sold My Soul\" # \"Dancing In the Darkness\" # \"Zip Drive\" # \"By the Powers of Grayskull\" # \"Damo's CD\" # \"Funeral In an Aircraft\" # \"Farewell Goodbye\" ;Appleasians # \"Tractor Man\" # \"Inside Looking Out\" # \"Something In Your Eye\" # \"Nana\" # \"Crusades\" # \"Don't Turn Back\" # \"Who Has Scene the Ween\" # \"Nana Reprise\" # \"My Cutie\" (The Shaggs cover) # \"I Lied To Her\" # \"Shelly Come Out Tonite\" # \"Don't Turn Back\" # \"In the Dungeon\" # \"Inside Looking Out\" # \"The Appleasians\" # \"Art Life\" # \"Red Scare\" # \"2008\" ==References== ==External links== * Ariel Pink - Early Live Recordings on Human Ear Music Category:2013 compilation albums Category:2013 live albums Category:Ariel Pink albums Category:Lo-fi music albums ",
