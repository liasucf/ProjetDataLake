In late 1707, Kochubey and Iskra delivered a letter to the Tsar's court that accused Ivan Mazepa of initiating talks with Stanislaus Leszczynski of Poland and Charles XII of Sweden. Peter I did not believe the letter and beheaded them both. Later when the Tsar realized that they were correct, they were reburied near the Refectory Church in Kiev Pechersk Monastery.Entsyklopediya Kyiv; \u0406\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0430 \u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d ==References== Category:Imperial Russian politicians Category:Colonels of the Cossack Hetmanate Category:Year of birth missing Category:1708 deaths Category:18th-century executions by Russia Category:People executed by Russia by decapitation Category:18th- century Ukrainian people Category:Burials at the Refectory Church, Kiev Pechersk Lavra ",
