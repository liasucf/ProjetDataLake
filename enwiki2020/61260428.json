The team competes in the Naisten Liiga (NSML), the premier women's hockey league in Finland. HPK was the first team to be awarded the Aurora Borealis Cup as the winner of the Finnish Championship in 2011. == History == A women's hockey team has competed under the parent club HPK since at least 1999. From 1999 to 2008, HPK Kiekkonaiset competed in the I-divisioona (called Naisten Mestis after 2013). The team qualified for the Naisten SM-sarja karsintasarja (promotion/relegation series) in the 2000\u201301 season but lost 11 of 14 qualification games and remained in I-divisoona. The opportunity for promotion through the karsintasarja returned in the 2007\u201308 season and this time, with a roster that included Meeri R\u00e4is\u00e4nen, Essi Salminen, Hanne Siki\u00f6, and Eveliina Simil\u00e4, HPK achieved promotion to the Naisten SM-saija. HPK debuted in the Naisten SM-sarja at the opening of the 2008\u201309 season, strengthened by the addition of a number of experienced players, notably Petra Herzigov\u00e1, Katja Riipi, Nora Tallus, and Vilma Vaattovaara. The team won the bronze medal match against Oulun K\u00e4rp\u00e4t with a game winning goal from Riipi. As Naisten SM-sarja Champions in 2011, HPK was the first team to be awarded the Aurora Borealis Cup. == Players and personnel == === 2020\u201321 roster === === 2020\u201321 team staff === * Head Coach: Mari Saarinen * Assistant Coach: Jussi Korhonen * Assistant Coach: Olli Simola * Goaltending Coach: Maija Hassinen-Sullanmaa * Team Manager: Maija Hassinen-Sullanmaa * Equipment Manager: Kari J\u00e4rvinen * Assistant Equipment Managers: Tommi Ahola & Hanna Haakana === Team captaincy history === *Nora Tallus, 2008\u20132010 *Mira Huhta, 2010\u20132013 *Riikka Noronen, 2013\u20132017 *Jutta Stoltenberg, 2017\u20132019 *Riikka Noronen, 2019\u2013present === Head coaches === * Tuomo Nukari, 2011\u2013January 2013 * Jarkko Julkunen, January 2013\u20132013 * Vesa M\u00e4kinen, 2014\u20132016 * Marko Rahikainen, 2016\u20132018 * Markku Pirttiniemi, 2018\u201319 * Katja Pasanen, 2019\u201320 * Mari Saarinen, 2020\u2013present == Team honours == === Finnish Championship === * Aurora Borealis Cup (1): 2011 * Runners-up (1): 2016 * Third Place (4): 2009, 2010, 2012, 2014 Source: ===IIHF European Women's Champions Cup=== * Bronze (1): 2012 == Notable alumni == Years active with HPK listed alongside players' names * Kristina Brown, 2014\u201315 * Pia Dukari\u010d, 2019\u201320 * Maija Hassinen-Sullanmaa,2008\u20132015 & 2017\u201318 * Venla Hovi, 2010\u20132012 * Kati Kovalainen, 2009\u201310 * Natsumi Kurokawa, 2019\u201320 * Sanna Lankosaari, 2009\u20132012 * Annina Rajahuhta, 2010\u20132012 * Meeri R\u00e4is\u00e4nen, 2017\u201318 * Miho Shishiuchi, 2014\u20132016 * Eveliina Simil\u00e4, 2008\u20132012 * Susanna Tapani, 2014-2016 * Vilma Vaattovaara, 2008\u20132011 * Tea Villil\u00e4, 2010\u201311 & 2015\u201316 * Hannah Westbrook, 2012\u201313 == See also == * Finland women's national ice hockey team * Women's ice hockey in Finland * Naisten Liiga == References == == External links == * Official website (in Finnish) * Team information and statistics from Eliteprospects.com and Eurohockey.com and Hockeyarchives.info Category:Women's ice hockey in Finland Category:Ice hockey teams in Finland Category:Sport in H\u00e4meenlinna ",
