She was particularly reliant upon her attendant, Feng Liao, whom she dispatched as an emissary to Wusun kingdoms and even to the Han Court. She faced opposition from pro-Xiongnu members of the Wusun royalty, particularly Wengguimi\u2019s Xiongnu wife. When word came that the Xiongnu planned to attack Wusun, she convinced her husband to send for aid from the Han Emperor.(\u516c\u4e3b\u53ca\u6606\u5f4c\u7686\u9063\u4f7f\u4e0a\u66f8\uff0c\u8a00\u300c\u5308\u5974\u5fa9\u9023\u767c\u5927\u5175\u4fb5\u64ca\u70cf\u5b6b\uff0c\u53d6\u8eca\u5ef6\u3001\u60e1\u5e2b\u5730\uff0c\u6536\u4eba\u6c11\u53bb\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f7f\u8b02\u70cf\u5b6b\u8da3\u6301\u516c\u4e3b\u4f86\uff0c\u6b32\u9694\u7d55\u6f22\u3002\u6606\u5f4c\u9858\u767c\u570b\u534a\u7cbe\u5175\uff0c\u81ea\u7d66\u4eba\u99ac\u4e94\u842c\u9a0e\uff0c\u76e1\u529b\u64ca\u5308\u5974\u3002\u552f\u5929\u5b50\u51fa\u5175\u4ee5\u6551\u516c\u4e3b\u3001\u6606\u5f4c\u3002\u300d) Ban Gu et al.
