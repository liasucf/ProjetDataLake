    "text": "1-Pentadecanol is an organic chemical compound classified as an alcohol. At room temperature, it is a white, flaky solid. 1-pentadecanol is a long-chain fatty alcohol, identical to pentadecane with one of its terminal hydrogen atoms replaced by a hydroxy group. It is an achiral molecule. The Shell corporation uses a proprietary process for the synthesis of 1-pentadecanol (referring to it by the trade name Neodol 5) via hydroformylation of olefins produced from ethylene. Like other long-chain primary alcohols, it is used as an ingredient in industrial chemicals, lubricating oils, and consumer products such as lotions and creams. Additionally, it can be used as a feedstock for processes that use ethoxylation and sulfation reactions to produce surfactants. In 2008, a synthesis of pachastrissamine (a cytotoxic lipid compound found in sea sponges) was described starting from 1-pentadecanol. Compared to other 1-alkanols (1-nonanol, 1-undecanol, and 1-tridecanol), 1-pentadecanol possesses lower solubility in supercritical carbon dioxide, consistent with a general trend of decreased solubility in alcohols with longer chains. Small amounts of 1-pentadecanol have been found (using thin- layer chromatography and GC/MS) to naturally occur in the leaves of Solena amplexicaulis (creeping cucumber). == References == Category:Fatty alcohols Category:Alkanols Category:Primary alcohols ",
