Soon he was appointed research assistant and subsequently curator at the Baden State Museum, Karlsruhe. In 1931 he addressed himself to the task of organizing the exhibition \"German Poets as Painters and Drawers\" for the Kunstverein (art society) Heidelberg. == Badisches Armeemuseum (Army Museum of Baden) == In the early 1930s Martin met Robert Wagner, a confidant of Adolf Hitler and NSDAP politician with whom Martin would have to do until 1945.Ernst Klee: \"Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich\".

Together with the retired Colonel Erich Blankenhorn, who had just been dismissed as chief of the Badische Landespolizei (State Police of Baden) by the new rulers, he built up an independent museum under the aegis of the Baden State Museum Karlsruhe (Badisches Landesmuseum).Vereinigung der Freunde des Wehrgeschichtlichen Museums Schloss Rastatt e.

Besides departments of the army of the Reich (Reichswehr) and color guards of the military associations, a row of delegations of NS-organizations, including SA, SS and Reich Labor Service (Reichsarbeitsdienst), marched up in the demilitarized zone.Der F\u00fchrer, edition: 13 May 1934: \"Milit\u00e4r-Gro\u00dfkonzert mit Schlachtenfeuerwerk im Stadtgarten\", \"Der Aufmarsch am Sonntag\", \"Ruf an die Soldaten\", \"Ein Rundgang durchs Armee-Museum\" (\"Grand military concert and battle fireworks in the city garden\", \"The deployment in sunday\", \"Call to the soldiers\", \"A tour through the Army Museum\")Der F\u00fchrer, edition: 13 May 1934, Le Temps, 13 May 1934, p. 1, \"D\u00c9P\u00caCHES DE L' \u00c9TRANGER\", s. a. Rosebrock: \"Kurt Martin\", pp. 49\u201353 In his opening speech from the balcony of the palace, Martin declared that the museum had benefited from over one thousand donations of military antiques. The museum was not only supposed to include the regiments of Baden, but also the regiments of the earlier 15th Alsatian army corps. The museum was supposed to be a \"speaking memorial, teaching everyone the military-political achievements of our frontier people. [...] Here the youth shall learn to respect and understand the achievements of their fathers.\"Badische Werkkunst, (Art creation in Baden) Year 1934/35, August, pp. 1\u20134 and Durlacher Tagblatt, edition: 14 May 1934 Wagner said about the purposes of the museum: \"What is given to the public today in the shape of the Army Museum is nothing else than an intellectual legacy from a time of struggling and fighting for our Germany for the struggle and fight for our Germany.\"Der F\u00fchrer, edition: 13 May 1934, p. 1: \"Das Badische Armeemuseum er\u00f6ffnet: Ein St\u00fctzpunkt deutscher Zukunftshoffnung.

Erich Blankenhorn commented on the state of the museum on the date of the opening and said that due to the short preparation period \"it was only possible to decorate the first royal stables with historically incoherent paintings and objects.\" For that reason the museum was closed one day after the opening.Vereinigung der Freunde des Wehrgeschichtlichen Museums Schloss Rastatt e.V. [ed..]: \"Gang durch die Geschichte\", p. 10 == 1934: Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (National Art Gallery Karlsruhe) == On July 2, 1934 Wagner appointed Martin head of the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (National Art Gallery Karlsruhe). He succeeded Hans Adolf B\u00fchler who was loyal to the party line and whose management of the museum was characterized by a radical opposition to the so- called degenerate art.Rosebrock: \"Kurt Martin\", p. 63 Martin remained head of the Staatliche Kunsthalle until 1956. === Exhibitions 1934-1940 === Between 1934 and 1939 the Staatliche Kunsthalle was limited in its activities. In the years between 1934 and 1937 the orangery building of the botanical garden was remodeled in order to accommodate a special department for the Baden paintings of the late 19th and 20th century as from 1938. Since 1934 the department of the old German Masterpieces had been reorganized. It was reopened to the public in 1937. Finally, the also redesigned department of the Dutch and Flemish painters reopened as well.Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. Jg. 8 (1939) (Yearbook of the Museums of the Upper Rhine, 8th year), pp. 199-203; Rosebrock loc. cit., p. 61 and 75 Between 1934 and 1937 several exhibitions were organized in the gallery of prints, including an exhibition about Hans Thoma in 1934 and an exhibition of the most recent acquisitions of old German masterpieces by the Staatliche Kunsthalle in 1936. Furthermore, two travelling exhibitions were organized for the elementary schools in Baden. In 1936 an exhibition about Hans Thoma was shown in 55 locations and totaled about 90.000 visitors, and in 1937 an exhibition about Albrecht D\u00fcrer was shown in 25 locations and registered about 45.000 visitors. Between 1934 and 1937 the Staatliche Kunsthalle organized annually, among others, about forty tours for the Reichsarbeitsdienst (Reichs Labor Service), the organization \"Kraft durch Freude\" (KdF) (Strength Through Joy), the NS-Frauenschaft (Nazi women\u2019s organization), the sisterhood of the Red Cross and schools. Just before the beginning of the war, on July 2, 1939, the museum was reopened and back in full operation.Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (T\u00e4tigkeitsbericht 1938/39 - activity report 1938/1939), in Oberrheinische Kunst.

Rosebrock: \"Kurt Martin\", p. 62 At the same time the Kunsthalle celebrated its 100th anniversary. On this occasion Robert Wagner opened a memorial exhibition for Hans Thoma showing 180 works. Besides private collectors and galleries, the Nationalgalerie (National Gallery) in Berlin, the Hamburger Kunsthalle (Art Gallery Hamburg) and the St\u00e4dtische Galerie Frankfurt (Municipal Gallery Frankfurt) contributed to this exhibition with loans. Martin meant to present Thoma as \"a master of the German landscape and as a great portraitist\".e. g. \"Hans-Thoma-Schau in Karlsruhe (\u2026) Unterredung mit Direktor Dr. Martin von der Staatlichen Kunsthalle\" (\"Hans Thoma show in Karlsruhe (...)

It contained the German paintings of the 19th century that had been \"rearranged\". The state government of Baden donated a work of Tr\u00fcbner, and the city of Karlsruhe a work of Thoma. From 1940 on, the Kunsthalle remained closed.Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. (Yearbook of the Upper Rhine Museums) Year 8 (1939), p. 201. === Art acquisitions in general === Between 1934 and 1937 the Kunsthalle acquired 115 paintings under the direction of Martin, including works of Hans Thoma, Emil Lugo and Hermann Daur.Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. Jg. 8 (1939) (Yearbook of the Museums of the Upper Rhine, 8th year), P. 199-203. According to Rosebrock, P. 61 and 75 Martin would have closed the museum for a few years after beginning to work there. It would have been his goal to draw the public attention away from the museum through that. The renovation works therefore would only have been a pretext. From 1938 to 1939 the Kunsthalle acquired 53 paintings. Martin emphasized paintings of Wilhelm Tr\u00fcbner, Anselm Feuerbach and Hans Thoma in his account report. Among the works that were marked as \"transfers\" were paintings by Karl Buchholz, Hermann Burte, Joseph Fratrel and Adolph von Menzel. At the same time the Kunsthalle acquired 175 drawings, 636 graphic print works and four sketchbooks. Regarding the drawings, Martin emphasized eight sheets by Ferdinand Kobell, three by Franz Kobell and nine by Wilhelm Tr\u00fcbner, as well as \u2013 a gift of the NSDAP-Gauleitung of Baden \u2013 the \"valuable early drawing of Hans Thoma, Sch\u00f6nau im Wiesental (Sch\u00f6nau in the valley of Wiesen)\".Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (T\u00e4tigkeitsbericht 1938/39 - activity report 1938/1939), in Oberrheinische Kunst.

For example, the museum acquired paintings from Albert Lang, Fritz Boehle, Ferdinand Keller, Ernst W\u00fcrttemberger, and Eduard Hunziker, and several drawings by Hans Thoma and Ferdinand Keller.Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. (Yearbook of the Upper Rhine Museum) Year 8 (1939), S. 199-203. In his activities report for the year 1940, Martin wrote: \"The General Administration managed to accomplish a few essential acquisitions for the public museums which will be reported about later in context.\" === Art acquisition from Jewish collections === The Kunsthalle Karlsruhe continuously took over art works from originally Jewish property. In a statement from 1947, Martin listed about 100 works, including works from the collections of Richard Lenel, Mannheim (one work), Benno Weil, Mannheim (one work), Siegfried Reiss, Mannheim (44 works), Arthur Levis, Karlsruhe (one work), E. Reiss, Heidelberg (three works), Paul Homburger, Karlsruhe (three works), Ettlinger, Karlsruhe (one work), Klara Goldschmit, Karlsruhe, Salomon, Karlsruhe (one work), Ernst Gallinek, Baden Baden (16 works and a porcelain collection including more than 400 objects) and Violetta von Waldberg, Heidelberg (wife of Max von Waldberg) (four works). The Kunsthalle took over these works from other State authorities that had expropriated the previous owners. Most of the works mentioned by Martin were transferred to the Kunsthalle from authorities, partly against payment. The Kunsthalle acquired 20 works on its own initiative from an \"Auction Sale of Jewish Property 6th-9th August 1941 in Karlsruhe\".Kurt Martin: Verzeichnis der von der Staatlichen Kunsthalle Karlsruhe seit 1933 aus j\u00fcdischen Besitz erworbenen Gem\u00e4lde, Zeichnungen und druckgraphische Bl\u00e4tter.

In 2000 a new compensation was claimed without success. This acquisition was not mentioned in the report for the years 1934 until 1937. === 1940 - 1944: \"Oberrheinische\" museums (\"Upper Rhine\" museums) === With the occupation of Alsatia, Robert Wagner became chief of the Alsatian Civilian Administration and had complete political freedom. It was his main objective to ensure that Alsatia become \"German\" again, in particular that Strasbourg become the \"preeminent first cultural center of the German Reich\".Rosebrock: \"Kurt Martin\", P. 30\u201334 He pursued this goal in the performing arts by founding several theatres and establishing German libraries.Lothar Kettenacker: \"Nationalsozialistische Volkstumspolitik im Elsa\u00df\", Stuttgart 1973, P. 180\u2013183 (Nazi Nation Politics in Alsatia) Moreover, he prohibited the use of the French language in public and Germanized all toponyms.Kettenacker: a. a.

This unity is also reflected in the museums' inventories. Martin aimed especially at the development of museums as places of national education with a regional and local focus. With this scope in mind, Martin aimed at the expansion of the Strasbourg collection \"on European grounds\". He wanted to develop the collection as a collection of European significance.Der F\u00fchrer, Sonderausgabe (Special Edition) 17.11.1940, \"Museen am Oberrhein\" (Museums of the Upper Rhine) === Director of the Municipal Museums of Strasbourg and Chief Commissioner of the Upper Rhine Museums === At the instigation of Wagner, Martin became director of the Municipal Museums of Strasbourg.Rosebrock: \"Kurt Martin\", P. 90 He also kept his position in Karlsruhe.

Horn, officers from the French Art Protection and his former French colleagues from Strasbourg confirmed his great integrity and qualification. Martin supported the French and American authorities in locating and rescuing the artworks that had been stored for purposes of protection during wartime.Rosebrock: \"Kurt Martin\", P. 253\u2013261 In 1946 he co-founded the International Council of Museums and remained director of the German National Committee for 15 years.
