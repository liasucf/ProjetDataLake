In 1909 the city of Me\u00dfstetten had to sell nearly 40% of their district area to the Reich Treasury.Wilfried Groh (wgh): Ein geschichtstr\u00e4chtiger Ort. Mit Gerhard Deutschmann \u00fcber den \u00f6stlichen Teil des Truppen\u00fcbungsplatzes Heuberg . In: Zollern-Alb-Kurier of 30 September 2009 The training area is the hub of the federal armed forces in the Sigmaringen district, and the last military training center still in use in southern Germany. Construction and expansion measures cost tens of millions of marks. In connection with the Heuberg training area are a radome on the \"Weichenwang\" (Me\u00dfstetten district) and the following external firing positions: * \"Sieben Jauchert\" (Kaiseringen district) * \"Wachtb\u00fchl\" and \"Wanne\" (Schwenningen district) * \"Vogelb\u00fchl\" (B\u00e4renthal district) * \"Bol\" (Hartheim district) and \"Wieden\u00e4cker\" (Unterdigisheim district) * \"Blumersberg\" (closed) (Me\u00dfstetten district) ==History== ===Conception=== The Heuberg training area originated from the requirements of the XIV Army Corps in 1885, which had expressed a need for a new maneuver area that was large enough for military exercises according to the new military principles. In August 1899 the Grand Duchy of Baden's Ministry of Finance was informed by the General Command in Karlsruhe of the requirements for a future training area. In addition to many other criteria, the future area should not have a high elevation, should have a railway terminal and should be as circular as possible. The agency assigned to conduct the search (Dom\u00e4nendirektion) quickly determined that the wishes of the military could not be met by any of the candidates. In 1905, the interest of the agency focused on the Heuberg. Since both the terrain and the purchase presented the fewest difficulties, the site was chosen, despite the fact that the future training area was only one-third in Baden and would not have a railway connection. Plans for a military station below the outer firing position Blumersberg in Me\u00dfstetten were worked out in detail for 8000 gold marks.Stadtarchiv Pl\u00e4ne Heubergbahn Me\u00dfstetten mit Milit\u00e4rbahnhof HR-E 787.11/01-05 From 1908 on purchase negotiations were held for the areas in Baden,Gro\u00dfherzogtum Baden, Bezirksamt Me\u00dfkirch: Heinstetten, Schwenningen und Stetten am kalten Markt W\u00fcrttembergK\u00f6nigreich W\u00fcrttemberg, Oberamt Balingen: Ebingen und Me\u00dfstetten und Prussia,Hohenzollernsche Lande, Oberamt Gammertingen Frohnstetten, Kaiseringen und Stra\u00dfbergAllgemeine Forst und Jagdzeitung, Volumr 87, 1911 which dragged on for some time. In some cases forced expropriations by the Reich Treasury was necessary, since not all prospective sellers were in agreement with the land prices offered by the military.Oberleutnant Marcus Klotz, Offizier f\u00fcr Standortangelegenheiten in Stetten a.k.M.: Milit\u00e4r setzt auf den Heuberg (1.

In: Marcus Klotz: Serie \u201e100 Jahre Truppen\u00fcbungsplatz\u201c in S\u00fcdkurier of 25 March 2010 ===Construction and commissioning=== By 1910 the first military exercises by the XIV Army Corps could take place at the training course, which was only partially purchased at this time. Because there were not enough fixed accommodations, the soldiers were housed in tents or quartered in the surrounding communities. Between 1912 and 1916 Camp Heuberg was built in the district of Stetten am kalten Markt. The establishment of the training area forced the destruction of several settlements which had been built to improve the economic situation of the population in the former territory of Stra\u00dfberg, Zollernalbkreis.Neun Forscher stellen Untersuchungen zur Landesgeschichte an.

A special challenge was supplying water for 6000 soldiers in training and 2500 horses.Gross: Die Wasserversorgung des auf dem Heuberg. In: Journal f\u00fcr Gasbeleuchtung und Wasserversorgung, LVI. Issue 1913, p. 250\u2013254. For this purpose, on February 19, 1910, the National Military Treasury acquired the so-called Hammerm\u00fchle, an old ironworks in Thiergarten in Beuron with channel and weir from the House of F\u00fcrstenberg for 35.000 Reichsmarks. They also bought a water source, Rainbrunnenquelle, which originated in between Neidingen and .Vgl.

After the demolition of the Hammerschmiede a pumping station was erected at its place. Along the more than higher training area three elevated tanks and a pressure line were built from 1909. In 1912 a power plant was built, which supplied the training ground with electricity via a power line from Thiergarten.Wasserkraftwerk Thiergarten , Deutscher Verein des Gas- und Wasserfaches e. V. (DVGW); retrieved on 7 November 2011 In 1911 the planning of a wastewater treatment plant began; the construction took place 1912 to 1914, and in 1914 it was able to go into operation. 1925 Stetten was connected to the sewage treatment plant with the western center part, 1981 the district Glash\u00fctte was added.Ursula Mallkowsky (sky): Gemeinsam in die Zukunft. In: S\u00fcdkurier of 29 October 2004 To build and supply the facility, a freight funicular was inaugurated in 1912. It went from train station in Kaiseringen to the Alb plateau with a length of , and from there an additional of railroad, of which only some concrete remains. After many repairs the railroad, completed in 1915, continued to suffer may accidents and was soon abandoned.Standseilbahn Kaiseringen; retrieved on 7 November 2011 At the end of World War I in 1918 the training ground could initially no longer be used because of the Treaty of Versailles. This treaty demanded the demilitarization of military proving grounds. The funicular was decommissioned in 1921 and never rebuilt.Kaiseringen - Truppen\u00fcbungsplatzes Heuberg; retrieved on 7 November 2011 In 1985 a tank loading facility was built on the Zollernalb Railway (T\u00fcbingen\u2013Sigmaringen railway) in Storzingen. ===First and Second World War=== July 1914: Last exercises before the war In May 1914, shortly before the war began, the training area was opened. The Prussian Ministry of War. gave careful consideration to the naming of the training area. In addition to the proposals as \"Truppen\u00fcbungsplatz Stetten\", \"Truppen\u00fcbungsplatz Heuberg\" was ultimately selected and approved by the Minister of War. In both World Wars a prisoner-of-war camp was established at the site. At the beginning of 1933 the existing buildings on the Heuberg north of the facility were used as one of the first concentration camps of the Nazi regime. Up to 2,000 people, mostly political opponents of the regime, were taken in protective custody. After nine months, Concentration Camp Heuberg was dissolved. Most prisoners were then deported into larger concentration camps, such as Dachau. Memorial for the Bachem Ba 349 \u201eNatter\u201c on the Ochsenkopf. On March 1, 1945, on the Ochsenkopf about from the Camp Heuberg, 23-year-old Luftwaffe test pilot Lothar Sieber made the initial (and only) test flight of the Bachem Ba 349 \"Natter\"\u2014 the world's first manned flight of a vertical take-off rocket plane. He was killed shortly after take-off in a crash near Nusplingen, in Stetten am kalten Markt. In March Sieber was buried with military honors in the cemetery of Stetten am kalten Markt. The grave is still there today; also still to be seen at the launch point are the concrete launch pad and the wooden stump of the launching ramp. ===Postwar years until today=== From 1945 to 1959 the site was under French administration. The last French army unit moved from Camp Heuberg in 1997. In 1966 the Bundeswehr expanded in Stetten am kalten Markt with the construction of the Albkaserne. Missiles were stationed here during the Cold War. In 1995 the city of Me\u00dfstetten reacquired the former \"Blumersberg\" artillery site. Used chiefly for the armored corps until the end of the twienth century, Heuberg is now used in many ways besides\u2014 practicing Army force basic training, bomb disposal, military police, Technisches Hilfswerk, professional fire, Federal Police, customs and police, CBRN defense. ==Nature and landscape protection== The training center possesses an extraordinarily important ecology for nature preservation. The area is divided into 40 per cent forest cover and 60 percent open meadow areas, some interspersed with juniper heath. It is characterized by the traditional herding economy (transhumance). So it is possible to maintain or expand the typical landscape of the past centuries at the facility. On the hills are old bunkers, or what is left of them to see after bombardment. Since the training area is burdened by its nearly century-old military use to a large extent with ammunition and parts, entering and driving is extremely dangerous and therefore strictly forbidden for civilians.

The area is especially worthy of protection\u2014it is particularly suitable as a summer meadow for sheep\u2014because of its the species-rich limestone meadows and juniper heaths.Kurt Loescher (loe): Experten stellen Natura 2000 vor. In: S\u00fcdkurier of 22 October 2010 ==Historic sites== Within the area there is the legendary Dreibannmarke, also called the \"Dahn\", a 17th-century border, which today marks the border between three different municipalities, formerly in the three states of W\u00fcrttemberg, Baden, and Hohenzollern. The meadow at the Dreibannmarke served as a stopping place for traveling merchants, wagons and craftsmen. With care it is possible to identify traces of the border. After the inauguration of the firing ranges, a meadow was allocated to the Gypsies as a camping site at the edge of the restricted area. Until 1835 merchants were smuggled over the customs borders guarded by local hunters. Ritter Heinrich von Tierberg, called Haiterbach, had most likely sold his property in Haiterbach, and in 1345 acquired his new territory on the grounds of the military training center, the center of which was Me\u00dfstetten. In 1418 he sold it to W\u00fcrttemberg. ==Literature== *Klaus H\u00f6rter, Manfred Hensel: Chronik des Truppen\u00fcbungsplatzes und der Garnison Heuberg bei Stetten am Kalten Markt : hrsg. aus Anlass des 70-j\u00e4hrigen Bestehens des Truppen\u00fcbungsplatzes Heuberg : A.
