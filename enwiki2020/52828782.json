The other teams had dropped out due to several crashes and arguments with the organizers about the poor planning. In one episode all the teams (except Rutherford) were detained in Ethiopia for two days due to missing entry permissions. The aim is to run rallies that are available to all, regardless of nationality, personal circumstances or any other factor. == The Crete2Cape Edition (2016) == The Franco-Belgian Team in a Stampe SV4 at Giza Pyramids, VintageAirRally 2016 The Crete2Cape edition of the VintageAirRally covered the Eastern side of the African continent, traversing Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zanzibar, Zimbabwe, Botswana, & South Africa.
