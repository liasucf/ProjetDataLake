Elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada in a partial election in 1818, he was re- elected until 1830 and supported the Parti canadien. In 1823, he accompanied Louis-Joseph Papineau to London to lobby against the Union project in the name of the majority of the MPs in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. Again, in 1828 he was part of a delegation sent to London to present his party's demands for reform. In 1830, he took his distance from the Parti patriote, which he considered to be too radical. He opposed the Ninety-Two Resolutions of 1834, a rewrite of the 1828 demands for reform with a radical tone. In 1837, he was named to the Executive Council and Legislative Council. Nielson was a member of the Special Council that administered Lower Canada after the Lower Canada Rebellion. Neilson opposed the Union after its enactment. In 1841, he was elected to the 1st Parliament of the Province of Canada in the riding of Quebec County. He was elected speaker, but in 1844, he was appointed to the Legislative Council. John Neilson is one of the major characters in the 3-volume series, A Chronicle of Lower Canada, which relates the events leading up to the Lower Canada Rebellion in 1837Morgan, Jan Henry, Welcome Niall O'Donell, Immigrant!
