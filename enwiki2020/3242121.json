Tahuya, whose name comes from a Twana term meaning \"that done\", features a number of recreational areas. The first Saturday in July marks the annual Tahuya Day celebration, which includes a parade, food booths and vendors, and other attractions. According to the official tourism website for the county (, locals largely recognize Tahuya Day as a celebration of the quirky place that residents live in \"by choice\". Tahuya is on the edge of the Hood Canal, a slender and deep saltwater fjord flowing in from the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Fishing, boating and shellfishing are popular here in the spring, summer and fall. Nearby sits the Tahuya State Forest, which encompasses several campgrounds and over 100 miles of off-road vehicle (ORV) and mountain biking trails . Tahuya's Rendsland Creek is designated by the Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife as an enhanced shellfishing beach, where visitors can harvest clams 6 months out of the year, and Hood Canal oysters year round. ==References== == External links == * Mason County's official tourism website * Washington State guidelines for shellfishing at Rendsland Creek * Green Mountain and Tahuya State Forest page of the Washington State Department of Natural Resources website * Tahuya State Forest Trail System map Category:Unincorporated communities in Washington (state) Category:Unincorporated communities in Mason County, Washington ",
