The HC-9 was designed after World War II and likely remained in use up to the 1970s. The machine was used for low-level communications. ==Operation== The HC-9 made use of punched cards instead of the pin-wheel mechanisms of other machines (for example, the Hagelin M-209). ==External links== * Photograph of an HC-9 * Another HC-9 photograph with a description * A description of the machine and a simulator in QBASIC * Discussion of the machine's operation ==References== * Cipher A.
