Chandra received his PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University, an MS from University of California, Berkeley, and a BTech from IIT Kanpur. He was previously Director of Database and Distributed Systems at IBM Almaden Research Center. Chandra co-authored several key papers in theoretical computer science. Among other contributions, he introduced alternating Turing machines in computational complexity (with Dexter Kozen and Larry Stockmeyer), conjunctive queries in databases (with Philip M. Merlin), computable queries (with David Harel), and multiparty communication complexity (with Merrick L. Furst and Richard J. Lipton). He was a founder of the annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science and served as conference chair of the first three conferences, in 1986\u20138. He was an IEEE Fellow. == References == == External links == * * Category:Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur alumni Category:Stanford University alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Microsoft Research Category:Microsoft employees Category:IBM employees Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:1948 births Category:2014 deaths ",
