They are the localised adaptation of the Five Forms of the Highest Deity (\u4e94\u65b9\u4e0a\u5e1d W\u01d4f\u0101ng Sh\u00e0ngd\u00ec) of common Chinese theology. ==Names and meanings== In some places of Hebei, the cult comprises four instead of five zoomorphic gods, including the Fox, the Weasel, the Hedgehog and the Snake Gods (\u56db\u5927\u4ed9 S\u00ecd\u00e0xi\u0101n, \u56db\u5927\u95e8 S\u00ecd\u00e0m\u00e9n). While the Fox God and the Weasel God always remain the two prominent members of the cult, the other positions vary in some regions including the Tiger, the Wolf, the Hare and the Turtle Gods. Li Qingchen (?-1897), a scholar of Tianjin, explained the images of the Five Great Immortals as follows: ::[...] the Five Immortals [...] are: \u72d0 H\u00fa is fox, \u9ec4 Hu\u00e1ng is weasel, \u767d B\u00e1i is hedgehog, \u67f3 Li\u01d4 is snake and \u7070 Hu\u012b is rat. I said these five can be distinguished by five colors. [...] White and yellow are hedgehog's and weasel's original colors, Hu\u012b is black and Li\u01d4 is green. [...] The Ode of Songs reads: \"Nothing is redder than fox\". As gods of wealth, the Five Immortals are also known by the epithet of \"Little Wealth Gods\" (\u5c0f\u8d22\u795e Xi\u01ceoc\u00e1ish\u00e9n). The Five Immortals have both male and female form, usually represented twosomes. ===Huxian\u2014Fox Immortal=== H\u00faxi\u0101n (\u72d0\u4ed9=\u80e1\u4ed9 \"Fox Immortal\"), also called H\u00fash\u00e9n (\u72d0\u795e=\u80e1\u795e \"Fox God\") or H\u00faw\u00e1ng (\u72d0\u738b=\u80e1\u738b \"Fox Ruler\") is possibly the most important of the Five Immortals in northeast China. Nagao Ryuz\u014d, a Japanese sinologist, observed that the Fox Gods \"enjoy such popularity to be worshipped by almost every household in north China and Manchuria\". Henry Dor\u00e9 documented the worship of the Fox God in the northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui. In parts of Hebei, to every newborn is assigned his own b\u011bnsh\u00e9n (\u672c\u795e patron god) manifestation of Huxian, usually a female for a boy and a male for a girl. After these boys and girls get married, their patrons will be represented sitting together. In his survey of popular shrines and temples in Manchuria, Takizawa Shunry\u014d found the number dedicated to Fox Gods overwhelming. The deity can be represented as either male or female, but is most frequently identified as the female H\u00faxi\u0101n Ni\u00e1ngni\u00e1ng (\u72d0\u4ed9\u5a18\u5a18 \"Fox Immortal Lady\") whose animal form is a nine-tailed fox. She is the Chinese equivalent of the Japanese Shint\u014d cult of Inari \u014ckami, both god(desses) of the foxes or collective representations of the fox sprites. The fox deity is also represented as a couple of gods, male and female, called the Great Lord of the Three Foxes (\u80e1\u4e09\u592a\u7237 H\u00fas\u0101n T\u00e0iy\u00e9) and the Great Lady of the Three Foxes (\u80e1\u4e09\u592a\u5976 H\u00fas\u0101n T\u00e0in\u01cei). As a goddess, the Fox Immortal is related to X\u012bw\u00e1ngm\u01d4 (\u897f\u738b\u6bcd \"Queen Mother of the West\"), the great goddess guardian of Mount Kunlun (axis mundi). pp. 88-89 & 184 ===Huangxian\u2014Weasel Immortal=== Hu\u00e1ngxi\u0101n (\u9ec3\u4ed9 literally \"Yellow Immortal\") is the Weasel God, and is identified as an incarnation of the pan-Chinese Yellow Deity (\u9ec4\u5e1d Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec) and Hu\u00e1ng D\u00e0xi\u0101n (\u9ec4\u5927\u4ed9 \"Great Yellow Immortal\").Wang Xue. \u4e1c\u5317\u519c\u6751\u5730\u533a\u9ec4\u4ed9\u4fe1\u4ef0\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76 D\u014dngb\u011bi n\u00f3ngc\u016bn d\u00ecq\u016b hu\u00e1ng xi\u0101n x\u00ecny\u01ceng de r\u00e9nl\u00e8i xu\u00e9 y\u00e1nji\u016b. Jilin University, 2013. Another name which indicates the collective personification of weasels is \"Great Lord of the Two Yellows\" (\u9ec4\u4e8c\u592a\u7237 Hu\u00e1ng\u00e8r T\u00e0iy\u00e9). ===Shexian\u2014Snake Immortal=== The Snake God is either called Sh\u00e9xi\u0101n (\u86c7\u4ed9 literally \"Snake Immortal\"), Li\u01d4xi\u0101n (\u67f3\u4ed9 \"Immortal Liu\"), or Ch\u00e1ngxi\u0101n (\u5e38\u4ed9 \"Viper Immortal\"). Alternatively he is M\u01cengxi\u0101n (\u87d2\u4ed9 \"Python (or Boa) Immortal\"). Considered an incarnation of the Dragon God, the snake traditionally represents generation and activity (yang). As such, it is also associated to Fuxi and N\u00fcwa, respectively the snake-bodied patron of heaven (\u5929\u7687 Ti\u0101nhu\u00e1ng) and patroness of earth (\u5730\u7687 Dehu\u00e1ng), who represent the two forces who concur in the birth of things. ===Baixian\u2014Hedgehog Immortal=== The B\u00e1ixi\u0101n (\u767d\u4ed9 \"White Immortal\") is the Hedgehog God. He is primarily worshipped as a medical deity to prevent and cure diseases. One of his female forms is B\u00e1il\u01ceo T\u00e0it\u00e0i (\u767d\u8001\u592a\u592a \"White Old Lady\"). ===Heixian\u2014Crow Immortal=== The H\u0113ixi\u0101n (\u9ed1\u4ed9 \"Black Immortal\") is a function occupied by different zoomorphic deities. The most common one is the W\u016by\u0101xi\u0101n (\u4e4c\u9e26\u4ed9 \"Crow Immortal\") and another popular one is the Hu\u012bxi\u0101n (\u7070\u4ed9 \"Rat Immortal\"), although the latter is said to be a misinterpretation of the former. The position can be taken also by the L\u00e1ngsh\u00e9n (\u72fc\u795e \"Wolf God\"). ==See also== * Chinese theology * Northeast China folk religion * Wufang Shangdi ==Notes== ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * ",
