It stars Brigitte Lahaie, Jane Baker, Lynn Monteil, France Lomay, Flore Sollier and \u00c9lodie Delage. The film is a sequel to Sechs Schwedinnen im Pensionat. ==Plot== Six girls who own a gas station spend their time having sex with customers while the cars are getting filled up outside. ==Cast== * Brigitte Lahaie as Greta * Jane Baker as Marie * Lynn Monteil as Inga * France Lomay as Kerstin * Flore Sollier as Lil * \u00c9lodie Delage as Astrid * Eric Falk as Der Metzger * Karl Gysling as Hans, der B\u00fcrgermeister * Roman Huber as Harry, der Mechaniker ==Reception== The website B Movies Heroee found the film worse than its predecessor, stating, \"The good Erwin C. Dietrich creates a cheerful comedy soft-core, which has no great pretensions technical or narrative. There is no doubt, Sechs Schwedinnen von der Tankstelle is more absurd than its predecessor\". The French blog Alligatographe criticized almost every aspect of the film and concluded, \"With no meanings, no talent, no scenario and no comedians, the film bores most of the time\". ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1980 films Category:1980s pornographic films Category:1980s sex comedy films Category:Swiss films Category:German-language films Category:Teensploitation Category:Films directed by Erwin C.
