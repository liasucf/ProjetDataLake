It had a capacity smaller than that of Truman High School. == Notable alumni == *Joseph Calleja better known as Joe C., was an American rapper of Maltese descent. He became popular as part of Kid Rock's band. *Steve Avery is a former left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who was a young star with the Atlanta Braves in the early 1990s. ==History== Kennedy High opened for classes on February 8, 1965. The 1965-66 enrollment was 1,359 10th and 11th grade students. In 1966, the school graduated 399 students in its first graduating class. On April 10, 2017, the Taylor School District Board voted 4-3 to close Kennedy High School due to declining enrollment and cost savings. The school closed permanently after the 2018 school year, with its students and staff merged with Harry S. Truman High School to form a new school, called Taylor High School. The district decided to discontinue use of Kennedy's building partly because of the facility's smaller capacity, partly it was not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and that it had no elevator which could be used for disabled students, and partly because the boiler system and pool heater were not working. == References == ==External links== *Taylor School District Home Page Category:Public high schools in Michigan Category:Schools in Wayne County, Michigan Category:1965 establishments in Michigan Category:Educational institutions established in 1965 Category:2018 disestablishments in Michigan Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2018 Category:Taylor, Michigan ",
