Kenny Barron Discography, accessed January 20, 2019 == Reception == In his review on Allmusic, Stephen Cook stated \"Invitation finds Barron in full maturity as a writer and in the sympathetic company of tenor saxophonist Ralph Moore, bassist David Williams, and drummer Lewis Nash ... Throughout, Ralph Moore's choice tenor lines glide over the notes, Lewis Nash's tasteful drumming impressively anchors the group, and Barron's inventive solos ride atop the band in full stride. With great material, solid playing, and the full Criss Cross sound, Invitation ends up as one of Kenny Barron's finest outings of the 1990s\". == Track listing == All compositions by Kenny Barron except where noted. # \"Namely You\" (Gene de Paul, Johnny Mercer) - 9:14 # \"And Then Again\" - 5:22 # \"Dew Drop\" - 4:39 # \"Invitation\" (Bronis\u0142aw Kaper, Paul Francis Webster) - 7:41 # \"Joanne Julia\" - 7:09 # \"Afternoon in Paris\" (John Lewis) - 7:18 # \"You Don't Know What Love Is\" (Gene de Paul, Don Raye) - 8:41 # \"Blue Monk\" (Thelonious Monk) - 7:28 == Personnel == *Kenny Barron \u2013 piano *Ralph Moore - tenor saxophone *David Williams \u2013 bass *Lewis Nash \u2013 drums == References == Category:Kenny Barron albums Category:1991 albums Category:Criss Cross Jazz albums Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio ",
