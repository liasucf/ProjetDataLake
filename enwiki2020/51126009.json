Offensive lineman Darrell McCaul, placekicker Chuck Selinger, and linebacker Mike Kyler were selected as first-team All-MAC players.2015 Media Guide, p. 93. In March 1994, Herb Deromedi quit his position as Central Michigan's head football coach to become the school's athletic director. Deromedi had hoped to continue coaching the football team, but the university administration required him to choose between coaching or taking on the duties of athletic director. He said at the time, \"To be honest, I was disappointed I wasn't given the opportunity to coach the 1994 season.\" In 16 years as head coach, Deromedi compiled a 110\u201355\u201310 record. An alumnus of the University of Michigan, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2007. ==Schedule== ==References== Central Michigan Category:Central Michigan Chippewas football seasons Central Michigan Chippewas football ",
