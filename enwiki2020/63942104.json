The two designers reconciled the Hungarian motifs with the Art Nouveau world. The synagogue square was centrally arranged, the exterior of which was characterized by the dome and the two towers. The building was formally related to the synagogue in Subotica. The greatly reduced number of Jewish communities after World War II was no longer able to use the building much. It was demolished in 1963. == Source == * (ed.)
