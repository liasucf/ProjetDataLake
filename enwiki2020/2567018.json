    "text": "Disillusion is a German progressive metal band from Leipzig. ==History== ===The beginnings without record deal=== Disillusion was founded in 1994 by Andy Schmidt, Tobias Spier, Alex Motz, Markus Espenhain and Jan St\u00f6lzel. The band played Thrash Metal. Despite the departure of bassist Markus Espenhain in early 1996, the first demo Subspace Insanity was recorded in March the same year. 1997 followed Red, where the band already developed their own style. The second demo was mixed and mastered by Andy Schmidt and Alex Tscholakov at TAM Recording in Zwickau. Despite growing local success and the prospect of the band becoming more serious, Disillusion was put on hold because of lack of time of some band members. With joining of guitarist Rajk Barthel and drummer Jens Maluschka in 1999 and 2000 Disillusion started again. They played some concerts and recorded their third demo Three Neuron Kings in summer 2001 (again with Alex Tscholakov at TAM Recording). The record received positive reviews by the music press. In spring of 2002 Disillusion went on tour again and won an EP production at the Legacy Band Contest. The record was recorded at TAM Recording in 2002 and called The Porter. It also reached international reputation in the music press and attracted the attention of larger labels. ===Back To Times of Splendor=== Disillusion signed a contract with Metal Blade Records and released the first album Back to Times of Splendor in 2004. Stylistically, the music is mostly located in Progressive Death Metal. Back to Times of Splendor was very well received by the critics. The Rock Hard even spoke of a hot contender for the title \"Debut of the Year.\" After the release Disillusion performed at several festivals (including Summer Breeze Open Air) and a European tour as support for Amon Amarth and Impious. During this time, the album was presented in special shows together with Leipzig musicians from Dark Suns and Unloved. ===Gloria=== The successor named Gloria was released on October 20, 2006. With the album, Disillusion entered new musical territory and relied heavily on distorted vocals as well as more electronic sounding elements. The latter was developed mainly by the production duo Philipp Hirsch and Heiko Tippelt of film-m. The new album showed a clear change of style compared to the predecessor. Disillusion did not want stylistically a successor to Back To Times of Splendor, because from the perspective of the band in the album everything was said. This is evident in the Gloria song \"Save the Past\". Fans and reviewers took Gloria very controversially. After the release Disillusion played European-wide concerts, although this time the band did not play a cohesive tour but played several individual shows as headliners. ===Post Gloria and hiatus=== On December 8, 2009, Andy Schmidt announced that the band had been separated from guitarist Rajk Barthel. At the end of 2010, Sebastian Hupfer joined the band as new guitar player. in 2011 some shows were played. This was followed by a hiatus, which Andy Schmidt explained with private challenges of the individual band members. ===Alea: Comeback=== In the year 2015 a fan asked the band to play an exclusive concert in Vienna. After Matthias Becker was no longer available because of his band SAFI, the French bassist Djon joined the band. Until then he played in a local project called echo.mensch together with Sebastian Hupfer. On May 29, 2015 Disillusion played Back to Times of Splendor for the first time in a row in Vienna. There were further shows in Germany and a final comeback concert in the sold-out Werk 2 in Leipzig on December 4, 2015. The new ten minute single Alea was presented live for the first time. In April 2016, Ben Haugg was officially introduced as a new bass player, as Djon had to return to France due to private obligations. On October 7, 2016 Alea was released digitally and as a CD via Kick the Flame Publishing (the publisher of the former guitarist Rajk Bartel). There followed a mini-tour at the end of the year through Germany and Austria. An album is to follow. === Work on third album === In March 2017 Disillusion announced that they would begin writing a third album. To aide with the writing process, Andy Schmidt isolated himself to a small cabin in the woods somewhere in the Czech Republic for 3 weeks to work undisturbed on new songs. Simultaneously the band asked for fan support via Patreon to finance the production. The first goal - support for Andy - was reached within two days. The band then announced to complete the third album within 12 months, but later extended that deadline to another year as the band didn't want to feel rushed to provide their fans with and inadequate and incomplete experience. During this time, the band announced another line-up change. This time, Bass player, Benn Haugg, would be moving on to third guitar and the band announced 2 new members. Josh Saldanha, a drummer from Dubai and Felix Tilemann who would be replacing Ben on the Bass. ==Band members== ===Current=== * Andy Schmidt: vocals/guitar/keyboards (1994\u2013present) * Sebastian Hupfer: Guitar (2010\u2013present) * Ben Haugg: Guitar (2016 \u2013 present) * Felix Tilemann: Bass (2018-present) * Josh Saldanha: drums (2018-present) ===Past=== * Tobias Spier: vocals, guitar (1994\u20131997) * Alex Motz drums: (1994\u20131997) * Clemens Frank: drums: (live only, 2007) * Markus Espenhain: bass guitar (1994\u20131996) * Jan St\u00f6lzel: keyboard (1994\u20131997) * Ralf Willis: bass guitar (2005) * Shya Hely: backing vocals (live only, 2005) * Alex Tscholakov: drums (2007\u20132008) * Alla Fedynitch: bass guitar (live only, 2007\u20132008) * Rajk Barthel: guitar (1999\u20132009) * Matthias Becker: bass guitar (2008-2015) * Djon: Bass guitar (2015) * Jens Maluschka: Drums (2000\u20132007, 2008\u22122018) ==Timeline== ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:90 top:0 right:15 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1994 till:12/12/2018 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4 ScaleMajor = increment:1 start:1994 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1994 Colors= id:vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:backing value:pink legend:Backing_Vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:keys value:purple legend:Keyboards id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:studio value:black legend:Studio_Albums id:other value:gray(0.5) legend:Demos/EPs id:singles value:red legend:Singles id:split value:yellow legend:Split/Single_Albums id:bars value:gray(0.95) LineData= at:07/01/1995 color:other layer:back at:04/01/1996 color:other layer:back at:09/01/1997 color:other layer:back at:10/01/2001 color:other layer:back at:04/05/2002 color:split layer:back at:04/06/2004 color:black layer:back at:09/04/2004 color:split layer:back at:10/20/2006 color:black layer:back at:10/07/2016 color:red layer:back BackgroundColors= bars:bars BarData= bar:Andy text:\"Andy Schmidt\" bar:Tobias text:\"Tobias Spier\" bar:Shya text:\"Shya Hely\" bar:Rajk text:\"Rajk Barthel\" bar:J\u00f6rg text:\"J\u00f6rg Heinze\" bar:Markus text:\"Markus Espenhain\" bar:Ralf text:\"Ralf Willis\" bar:Alla text:\"Alla Fedynitch\" bar:Matt text:\"Matthias Becker\" bar:Ben text:\"Ben Haugg\" bar:Felix text:\"Felix Tilemann\" bar:Jan text:\"Jan St\u00f6lzel\" bar:Alex text:\"Alex Motz\" bar:Alex2 text:\"Alex Sasch Tscholakov\" bar:Jens text:\"Jens Maluschka\" bar:Josh text:\"Josh Saldanha\" PlotData = width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Andy from:01/01/1994 till:end color:vocals bar:Andy from:12/01/1997 till:end color:keys width:7.5 bar:Andy from:01/01/1994 till:end color:guitar width:2.5 bar:Andy from:12/01/1996 till:03/01/2005 color:bass width:5.5 bar:Andy from:10/01/2005 till:01/01/2007 color:bass width:5.5 bar:Tobias from:01/01/1994 till:12/01/1997 color:vocals width:2.5 bar:Tobias from:01/01/1994 till:12/01/1997 color:guitar bar:Shya from:03/01/2005 till:10/01/2005 color:backing bar:Rajk from:01/01/1999 till:03/01/2009 color:guitar bar:J\u00f6rg from:01/01/2000 till:10/01/2000 color:guitar bar:Ben from:03/01/2018 till:end color:guitar bar:Jan from:01/01/1994 till:12/01/1997 color:keys bar:Markus from:01/01/1994 till:12/01/1996 color:bass bar:Ralf from:03/01/2005 till:10/01/2005 color:bass bar:Alla from:01/01/2007 till:07/01/2008 color:bass bar:Matt from:07/01/2008 till:04/01/2016 color:bass bar:Ben from:04/01/2016 till:03/01/2018 color:bass bar:Felix from:03/01/2018 till:end color:bass bar:Alex from:01/01/1994 till:03/01/1997 color:drums bar:Alex2 from:03/01/1997 till:08/01/2000 color:drums bar:Jens from:08/01/2000 till:05/01/2007 color:drums bar:Alex2 from:05/01/2007 till:08/01/2008 color:drums bar:Jens from:08/01/2008 till:03/01/2018 color:drums bar:Josh from:03/01/2018 till:end color:drums ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Back to Times of Splendor (2004) * Gloria (2006) * The Liberation (2019) ===Demos and EPs=== * Rehearsal (1995) (demo) * Subspace Insanity (1996) (demo) * Red (1997) (demo) * Three Neuron Kings (2001) (EP) * Alea (2016) (EP) ===Singles=== * The Porter (2002) (single) * Alea (2016) (single) ===Other=== * Fate of Norns Release Shows (2004) (split album including; Amon Amarth, Fragments of Unbecoming and Impious) ==References== ==External links== * Category:German heavy metal musical groups Category:German melodic death metal musical groups Category:German progressive metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1994 Category:Metal Blade Records artists Category:German musical trios Category:1994 establishments in Germany ",
