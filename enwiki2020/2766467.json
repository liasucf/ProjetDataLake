    "text": "Caldecott MRT station is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the Circle line, located in Toa Payoh planning area, Singapore, underneath Toa Payoh Rise near the junction of Toa Payoh Link. In 2021, Caldecott station will become an interchange with the Thomson\u2013East Coast line. Despite its name, Caldecott station is located within Toa Payoh New Town rather than Caldecott Hill. Caldecott Hill is home to private houses and the former Caldecott Broadcast Centre, synonymous with the growth of the local media industry, and originally named after British colonial administrator Sir Andrew Caldecott. As Bukit Brown MRT station is currently non-operational, the section of tracks between Caldecott station and Botanic Gardens MRT station is the longest between any two stations on the Circle line. ==History== Caldecott station CCL platform level with the artwork on the lift shaft. When the Circle line was initially planned, this station was planned to be a shell station, to be opened only when the surroundings are more developed and was named \"Thomson\". It was only announced quite later that Caldecott will be opened with the Stage 4 on 11 January 2007, and the station name was renamed to \"Caldecott\", which is named after the Caldecott Hill. The station opened on 8 October 2011. ===Thomson-East Coast line Interchange=== The site of Caldecott station, with the TEL station nearing completion. This station was first announced on 29 August 2012. On 15 August 2014, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) confirmed that Caldecott station would be part of the proposed Thomson East-Coast line (TEL). The station will be constructed as part of Phase 2, consisting of 6 stations between the Springleaf and Caldecott stations, and is expected to be completed in 2021. The station is to be the terminus of the TEL until the line extension to Gardens by the Bay station in the later part of 2021. The Contract T213 for the design and construction of Caldecott TEL Station and associated tunnels was awarded to Samsung C&T; Corporation at a sum of S$285 million in July 2013. Construction started in 2014, with completion expected in 2021. ==Art in Transit== The artwork featured in the Circle line part of this station under the Art in Transit programme is The Cartography Of Memories by Hazel Lim, located on the lift shaft in the station. The artist gathered responses from some 100 members of the public about their memories of the places they've lived in, and used phrases and words from the responses to create a literal text map of the Thomson area, where the station is located. ==Civil Defence shelter== Caldecott CCL station is one of eleven stations along the Circle line designated as Civil Defence (CD) shelters, which will be activated in times of national emergency. Apart from reinforced construction, the stations are designed and equipped with facilities to ensure the shelter environment is tolerable for all shelterees during shelter occupation. These facilities include protective blast doors, decontamination facilities, ventilation systems, power and water supply systems and a dry toilet system. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Toa Payoh Category:Railway stations opened in 2011 Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) stations Category:2011 establishments in Singapore ",
