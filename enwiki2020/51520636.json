The game was played between the Eastern Division champion, Gators, and Western Division champion Alabama. The Eastern Division team was the designated home team, and the game was broadcast nationally by CBS for the 16th consecutive year. This was the final SEC Championship Game in the Georgia Dome, which was demolished on November 20, 2017 after its successor, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, opened on August 26 of the same year. The title game moved to the new stadium and will remain there through at least 2027. Alabama earned a berth in the SEC Championship on November 12 after clinching the SEC West. ==2015 season== In the 2015 SEC Championship Game, Alabama defeated Florida 29\u201315.
