    "text": "Federation is a 1998 documentary film in three parts on the history behind the union of six colonies into the Commonwealth of Australia. ==The film== The film was funded by the ABC and Film Australia, originally broadcast as a 3-part miniseries, each of 55 minutes, in the programme slot The Big Picture. Presentation largely consists of interleaving historical photographs and political cartoons, modern film clips and \"talking heads\", their faces rarely shown for more than five seconds, then talking over relevant graphics. Dates and statistics are given second place to anecdotes and character assessments of the principle protagonists. The locomotive with its passenger-less carriages, seen frequently in continuity shots, is an \"F-class\" F251 built by Perry Engineering, which entered service with the South Australian Railways in 1922 and is now operated by SteamRanger, maintenance schedule permitting. ==Selected credits== *Director: Ian Munro *Producer: Anna Grieve *Writer: Sue Castrique *Editor: Stewart Young *Narrator: John Doyle *Director of Photography: Kim Batterham *Composer: Martin Friedel *Archival Researcher: Jeannine Baker *Historical Consultant: Helen Irving *Voices (part 1 - The Land): Leo McKern, Kirk Alexander, Peter Browne, Leslie Dayman, Gary Files, Cornelia Frances, Chris Haywood, Geoff Kelso, Deborah Kennedy, Shane McNamara, Peter O'Brien, Kelton Pell, Duncan Piney, Ken Radley, Doug Scroope, Rob Steele, Alan Tobin, William Zappa. *Commentary (part 1): Greg Craven, John Bannon, Helen Irving (political historian), John Hirst, Mick Dodson, Ann Curthoys, Peter Love (labour historian), plus an Echuca local historian, a grandson of Fred T.
