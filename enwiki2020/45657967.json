    "text": "Hobb's Mill Hobb's Mill, also knowb as Hobbs Drainage Mill, is an open trestle windpump which stands by the side of the River Bure in Horning, North Norfolk, England, and is a Grade II* listed structure. The mill was built before 1930, probably in the late 19th century. The frame is made of wood, with four braced cant posts standing on brick piers supporting a weatherboarded cap and fantail. In the picture, the four sails are missing. The mill was unique in that it was the only trestle mill to operate a scoop wheel. Both the mill and scoop wheel have been partly restored by the Windmill Trust. ==References== Category:Windmills of the Norfolk Broads Category:Smock mills in England Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Norfolk Category:Windpumps in the United Kingdom Category:North Norfolk Category:Grade II* listed windmills ",
