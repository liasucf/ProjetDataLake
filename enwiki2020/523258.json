    "text": "Charles Fox Bennett Charles James Fox Bennett (11 June 1793 in Shaftesbury, England - 5 December 1883) was a merchant and politician who successfully fought attempts to take Newfoundland into Canadian confederation. Bennett was a successful businessman and one of the colony's richest residents with interests in the fisheries, distillery and brewery industry and shipbuilding. His brother Thomas Bennett, a magistrate and member of Newfoundland's first House of Assembly, was a partner in the business. Bennett became involved in politics in the 1840s as a leader of the colony's Anglican community and an opponent of responsible government, an argument he lost when an alliance of Catholics and non-Anglican Protestants persuaded the Colonial Office to grant Newfoundland self-government. In the 1860s, he led the Anti-Confederation Party opposing the proposals by Sir Frederick Carter to join Canada. Bennett's party defeated Carter's Conservatives on the Confederation issue in the 1869 elections, allowing Bennett to form a government in 1870. However, as Premier he was unable to keep his party united, and in 1874 resigned, allowing Carter to return to power. The issue of Confederation had become a moot point and would not be seriously raised again until the Great Depression. Bennett's anti-Confederates reformed themselves into the colony's Conservative Party. == External links == * Category:1793 births Category:1883 deaths Category:People from Shaftesbury Category:Premiers of Newfoundland Colony Category:British North American Anglicans Category:Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada) Category:Anti-Confederation Party politicians Category:English brewers Category:British merchants Category:English emigrants to pre- Confederation Newfoundland Category:Drink distillers ",
