The company added Benjamin Arthur Banker as partner in 1913 and renamed itself Coldwell, Cornwall & Banker in 1920. Cornwall resigned as partner in 1940, and the company was renamed Coldwell, Banker & Co, which was eventually shortened to Coldwell Banker. In 1981, Coldwell Banker was acquired by Sears. In 1989, Sears sold Coldwell Banker's commercial unit to a management-led buyout group including The Carlyle Group for approximately $300 million. After the buyout, the company was renamed CB Commercial Real Estate Group. The residential group retained the Coldwell Banker name. In 1996, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, raising approximately $80 million. In 1997, the company acquired Koll Real Estate Services for $145 million. In 1998, CB Commercial merged with Richard Ellis International (REI) Limited and changed its name to CB Richard Ellis.

Thomas had bid for it. However, it is unclear if the suit was followed through. ==See also== * Colliers International * Cushman & Wakefield * JLL (company) ==References== ==External links== * Category:2004 initial public offerings Category:Commercial real estate companies Category:Companies based in Los Angeles Category:American companies established in 1906 Category:Real estate companies established in 1906 Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Property services companies of the United Kingdom Category:Real estate services companies of the United States Category:Companies formed by merger ",
