    "text": "EACA International Ltd was a Hong Kong manufacturer active from 1975 to 1983, producing Pong-style television video games, and later producing thousands of personal computers. The company's products included the Video Genies I, II and III (which were Tandy TRS-80 Model I-compatible) and the Colour Genie. Along with Radio Shack clones, they also produced Apple II computer compatible machines. The EACA group of companies was established in December 1972 by Eric Chung Kwan-yee (alias Chung Bun), a businessman of humble beginnings from mainland China who stole into the then British colony from Guangzhou as a young man. Just as distributors were promoting a new 16-bit machine in late 1983, the heavily indebted group went into liquidation at the hands of receivers. Eric Chung was rumoured to have fled Hong Kong for Taiwan, leaving a seaside villa and massive debts in his wake. ==References== ==External links== * Site covering the System 80 and EACA in general * Video Genie I, II, and III, and the Colour Genie at old-computers.com * 1000BiT, in English and Italian Category:Defunct computer hardware companies Category:Home computer hardware companies Category:Companies with year of establishment missing ",
