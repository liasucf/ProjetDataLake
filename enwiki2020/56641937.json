    "text": "The second season of the American television series Better Call Saul premiered on February 15, 2016, and concluded on April 18, 2016. The ten-episode season was broadcast on Monday nights in the United States on AMC. A spin-off-prequel of Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, both of whom also worked on Breaking Bad. This season, like the previous, mainly takes place in 2002, with Bob Odenkirk reprising his role as Jimmy McGill, a lawyer who has a feud with his brother Chuck (Michael McKean). Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) is Jimmy's former Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM) mailroom co-worker, now an HHM attorney and Jimmy's lover, who leaves the practice of law at HHM to start a solo practice in office space she shares with Jimmy. Jonathan Banks reprises his role as Mike Ehrmantraut; he is engaged in a feud with the Mexican drug cartel after an altercation with Tuco (Raymond Cruz), which was orchestrated by Nacho Varga (Michael Mando). This draws Hector's (Mark Margolis) attention to Mike. The second season of Better Call Saul received acclaim from critics and six nominations for the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series. ==Production== During the production of season one on June 19, 2014, AMC ordered a second, 13-episode season of Better Call Saul to air in 2016.

Each moment is compact, leading to the next with unpredictable, behaviorally astute precision\". Daniel D'Addario of Time praised the show's ability to stand out as a spin-off but retain some of the elements of its predecessor, writing, \"in its second season, ... Better Call Saul allows us into a new world of complexity by deepening one of the show's pivotal relationships. It's the best-case scenario for a spin-off: a show that occupies a familiar world but opens up entirely new themes.\" ===Ratings=== Live + seven-day DVR playback viewership was unavailable, so live + three-day is listed instead. ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! align=\"left\" | Ceremony ! align=\"left\" | Category ! align=\"left\" | Recipients ! align=\"left\" | Result |- | rowspan=2| 32nd TCA Awards |Outstanding Achievement in Drama |Better Call Saul | |- |Individual Achievement in Drama |Bob Odenkirk | |- | rowspan=4|68th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards | rowspan=2|Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series | Kelley Dixon (\"Rebecca\") | |- | Kelley Dixon and Chris McCaleb (\"Nailed\") | |- | Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series | Phillip W.
