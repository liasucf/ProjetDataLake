    "text": "Elevator is a 1979 rock album by the Bay City Rollers. Having replaced longtime lead singer Les McKeown with Duncan Faure, the group shortened their name to simply The Rollers, and pursued a more rocking, power-pop sound than their previous work. The album, released by Arista, was critically acclaimed but poorly received commercially. Neither the album itself or any single releases would hit the charts. The album was reissued on CD in 2008, with no bonus cuts however. ==Music== Dave Thompson of AllMusic wrote that the album featured a hard rock, AOR direction. Billboard felt the music was reminiscent of 1965-66 era Beatles,Billboard, 25 August 1979 with Trouser Press even comparing the album to the Beatles' Rubber Soul (1965). ==Critical reception== AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five. ==Track listing== ===Side One=== #\"Stoned Houses #1\" (Faulkner, Wood, Faure) #\"Elevator\" (Faulkner, Faure, Wood) #\"Playing in a Rock and Roll Band\" (Faure, Tom Seufurt) #\"Hello & Welcome Home\" (Faulkner, Faure) #\"I Was Eleven\" (Faure) #\"Stoned Houses #2\" (Faulkner) ===Side Two=== #\"Turn on the Radio\" (Faulkner, Faure, Wood, Alan Longmuir) #\"Instant Relay\" (Faulkner) #\"Tomorrow's Just a Day Away\" (Faulkner, Wood) #\"Who'll Be My Keeper\" (Faure) #\"Back on the Road Again\" (Faulkner, Faure, Wood, Alan Longmuir) #\"Washington's Birthday\" (Wood, Faulkner, Faure) ==Personnel== ===Group members=== *Eric Faulkner \u2013 Guitar, acoustic guitar, vocals, lead vocal on \"Playing in a Rock & Roll Band\" *Duncan Faure \u2013 Lead vocals, piano, moog, guitars *Alan Longmuir \u2013 Guitar, bass, vocals, string machine *Derek Longmuir \u2013 Drums, percussion *Stuart \"Woody\" Wood \u2013 Bass, piano, moog, string machine, clavinet, vocals, lead vocal on \"Tomorrow's Just A Day Away\" ===Other personnel=== *Peter Ker \u2013 producer *Rod Thear \u2013 engineer *Gary Gray \u2013 mixing engineer *John Naslen \u2013 mixing engineer ==References== Category:Bay City Rollers albums Category:1979 albums Category:Arista Records albums ",
