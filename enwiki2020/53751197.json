Along with the Winter Center, The Ware Center is a venue for Millersville University\u2019s Department of Visual & Performing Arts. == History == Originally designed by architect Philip Johnson and noted acoustician Cyril M. Harris, the $32 million building opened in 2008 as the home of the now defunct Pennsylvania Academy of Music. The building became available due to the bankruptcy of the PA Academy of Music at the same time Millersville University was planning an extensive renovation of its main campus arts center. Millersville University began leasing the building in June 2010, shortly after the PA Academy of Music left the building. The Pennsylvania Department of General Services then bought the building from Union Community Bank on Millersville's behalf for $10.9 million in March 2011. $14.5 million was originally allocated by the state of Pennsylvania for purchasing the 63,000-square-foot building on Millersville's behalf, as well as equipping, furnishing and renovating it. At that point, the building was known as \u201cMillersville University-Lancaster\u201d, as it wasn\u2019t until September 12, 2011 that it was renamed \u201cThe Ware Center\u201d in honor of philanthropists Paul W. and Judy S. Ware at a dedication ceremony in the building\u2019s main theater, Steinman Hall. In 2012, The Ware Center underwent a $2.4 million renovation to better adapt it to Millersville University's needs; among the renovations was the creation of larger classroom space and lighting and acoustic improvements to Steinman Hall. == Concerts and Events == A crowd watches a performance at Steinman Hall inside The Ware Center of Millersville University in downtown Lancaster, PA.The building plays host to various musical, theatrical, dance, poetry, lecture, and other artistic events throughout the year, including on Lancaster city\u2019s First Fridays.
