    "text": "In graph theory, the Kneser graph (alternatively ) is the graph whose vertices correspond to the -element subsets of a set of elements, and where two vertices are adjacent if and only if the two corresponding sets are disjoint. Kneser graphs are named after Martin Kneser, who first investigated them in 1955. == Examples == The Kneser graph is the complete graph on vertices. The Kneser graph is the complement of the line graph of the complete graph on vertices. The Kneser graph is the odd graph ; in particular is the Petersen graph. == Properties == * The Kneser graph has \\tbinom{n}{k} vertices. Each vertex has exactly \\tbinom{n-k}{k} neighbors. * The Kneser graph is vertex transitive and arc transitive. However, it is not, in general, a strongly regular graph, as different pairs of nonadjacent vertices have different numbers of common neighbors depending on the size of the intersection of the corresponding pair of sets. * Because Kneser graphs are regular and edge- transitive, their vertex connectivity equals their degree, except for which is disconnected. More precisely, the connectivity of is \\tbinom{n-k}{k}, the same as the number of neighbors per vertex . * As conjectured, the chromatic number of the Kneser graph for n\\geq 2k is exactly ; for instance, the Petersen graph requires three colors in any proper coloring. proved this using topological methods, giving rise to the field of topological combinatorics. Soon thereafter gave a simple proof, using the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem and a lemma of David Gale, and won the Morgan Prize for a further simplified but still topological proof. found a purely combinatorial proof. * The Kneser graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle if : ::n\\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\left (3k+1+\\sqrt{5k^2-2k+1} \\right ). :Since ::\\frac{1}{2} \\left (3k+1+\\sqrt{5k^2-2k+1} \\right )< \\left (\\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right) k+1, :holds for all k this condition is satisfied if ::n\\geq \\left (\\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right) k+1 \\approx 2.62k+1. * The Kneser graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle if there exists a non-negative integer a such that n=2k+2^a . In particular, the odd graph has a Hamiltonian cycle if . * With the exception of the Petersen graph, all connected Kneser graphs with are Hamiltonian . * When , the Kneser graph contains no triangles. More generally, when it does not contain cliques of size , whereas it does contain such cliques when . Moreover, although the Kneser graph always contains cycles of length four whenever , for values of close to the shortest odd cycle may have nonconstant length . * The diameter of a connected Kneser graph is : ::\\left\\lceil \\frac{k-1}{n-2k} \\right\\rceil + 1. * The spectrum of the Kneser graph consists of k + 1 distinct eigenvalues: ::\\lambda_j=(-1)^j\\binom{n-k-j}{k-j}, \\qquad j=0, \\ldots,k. :Moreover \\lambda_j occurs with multiplicity \\tbinom{n}{j}-\\tbinom{n}{j-1} for j >0 and \\lambda_0 has multiplicity 1. See this paper for a proof. * The Erd\u0151s\u2013Ko\u2013Rado theorem states that the independence number of the Kneser graph for n\\geq 2k is ::\\alpha(K(n,k))=\\binom{n-1}{k-1}. == Related graphs == The Johnson graph is the graph whose vertices are the -element subsets of an -element set, two vertices being adjacent when they meet in a -element set. The Johnson graph is the complement of the Kneser graph . Johnson graphs are closely related to the Johnson scheme, both of which are named after Selmer M. Johnson. The generalized Kneser graph has the same vertex set as the Kneser graph , but connects two vertices whenever they correspond to sets that intersect in or fewer items . Thus . The bipartite Kneser graph has as vertices the sets of and items drawn from a collection of elements. Two vertices are connected by an edge whenever one set is a subset of the other. Like the Kneser graph it is vertex transitive with degree \\tbinom{n-k}{k}. The bipartite Kneser graph can be formed as a bipartite double cover of in which one makes two copies of each vertex and replaces each edge by a pair of edges connecting corresponding pairs of vertices . The bipartite Kneser graph is the Desargues graph and the bipartite Kneser graph is a crown graph. == References == * * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * * Category:Parametric families of graphs Category:Regular graphs ",
