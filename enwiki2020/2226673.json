    "text": "Macuna\u00edma is a 1969 Brazilian comedy film directed by Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, based on M\u00e1rio de Andrade's novel of the same name. It was released in a dubbed version for American audiences in 1972 by New Line Cinema. On June 13 and July 12, 2005, European and Latin American syndicates of the TV5 network aired the film in its original Portuguese with French subtitles. It was rereleased internationally in 2009. ==Plot== Based on the 1928 book by M\u00e1rio de Andrade, the modern-day parable follows the misadventures of a black man (Grande Otelo) who is miraculously born to an old woman (Paulo Jos\u00e9), who is supposed to be of the indigenous peoples of Brasil, in the jungles of the Amazon. Though born fully-grown, he has the heart of a playful child. After the death of his mother, he comes face to face with a spring that turns him white (Paulo Jos\u00e9). With that change, he and his two brothers move to Rio de Janeiro, but are interrogated by street terrorists upon their arrival. Then, thanks to an affair with a white lady, guerrilla killer Ci (Dina Sfat), the film's hero fathers a black boy (Grande Otelo) with her. When both mother and child die, he embarks on a quest to recover a magical stone from a rich city dweller. In this film, the essentialist myth of the 3 Brazilian races, white, black, and the original natives of Brazil, is supposed to be represented through the protagonist, his brothers, and his mother. Throughout his adventures, Macuna\u00edma learns some tough lessons about Brazilian life and society. Macunaima functions as an allegorical representation of the turmoil of the Brazilian military coup that had ensued. ==Cast== *Grande Otelo as black Macuna\u00edma *Paulo Jos\u00e9 as white Macuna\u00edma/Macuna\u00edma's mother *Dina Sfat as Ci *Jardel Filho as Wenceslau Pietro Pietra *Milton Gon\u00e7alves as Jigu\u00e9 *Rodolfo Arena as Maanape *Joana Fomm as Sofar\u00e1 *Maria do Ros\u00e1rio as Iriqui *Hugo Carvana *Carmem Palhares *Wilza Carla *Zez\u00e9 Macedo *Maria L\u00facia Dahl *Myriam Muniz ==References== ==External links== * Macunaima at the Internet Movie Database Category:1960s fantasy-comedy films Category:1969 films Category:Brazilian films Category:Brazilian fantasy comedy films Category:Epic films Category:Films based on Brazilian novels Category:Films directed by Joaquim Pedro de Andrade Category:Indigenous cinema in Latin America Category:Portuguese-language films Category:1969 comedy films ",
