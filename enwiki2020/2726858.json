    "text": "The Unity and Progress Party (, PUP) is a political party in Guinea. It was the ruling party during the long rule of President Lansana Cont\u00e9. In the parliamentary election held on 30 June 2002, the party won 61.57% of the popular vote and 85 out of 114 seats. Its candidate in the 21 December 2003 presidential election, Lansana Cont\u00e9, won 95.25% of the vote; this election was, however, generally boycotted by the opposition. Following Cont\u00e9's death on December 22, 2008, the military immediately seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat, ending the rule of the PUP. The party has continued to exist since the coup, although in a severely weakened form. It nominated Aboubacar Sompar\u00e9, a prominent figure in the Cont\u00e9 regime and the man who would have been the constitutional successor to Cont\u00e9 had the military not intervened, as its candidate for the June 2010 presidential election, but he received only about 1% of the vote. == Electoral history == === Presidential elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Election ! rowspan=\"2\" |Party candidate !Votes !% !Votes !% ! rowspan=\"2\" |Result |- ! colspan=\"2\" |First round ! colspan=\"2\" |Second round |- |1993 | rowspan=\"3\" |Lansana Cont\u00e9 |1,077,017 |51.7% | - | - |Elected |- |1998 |1,455,007 |56.1% | - | - |Elected |- |2003 | |95.6% | - | - |Elected |- |2010 |Aboubacar Sompar\u00e9 | |0.95% | - | - |Lost |} === National Assembly elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Election !Votes !% !Votes !% ! rowspan=\"2\" |Seats ! rowspan=\"2\" |+/\u2013 ! rowspan=\"2\" |Position |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Constituency ! colspan=\"2\" |Proportional |- |1995 |990,184 |53.5% | | | | 71 | 1st |- |2002 |1,947,318 |61.5% | | | | 14 | 1st |- |2013 | | |13,503 |0.43% | | 85 | 17th |} ==References== Category:Political parties in Guinea ",
