    "text": "Ryan Joseph Sears (born 30 December 1998) is a Welsh footballer who plays as a right back for Shrewsbury Town. ==Career== Born in Newtown, Powys, Wales, Sears was a youth player at Shrewsbury Town and scored twice to help them to the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup in 2016\u201317, while also being an unused substitute for the senior team in EFL League One three times around the turn of the year. He was loaned to his hometown team Newtown A.F.C. in the Welsh Premier League for the 2017\u201318 season. He played 35 total games and scored three goals across all competitions, including one in a 4\u20132 win at reigning champions The New Saints on 30 December. He was voted the club's Players' Player of the Season. On 2 August 2018, Sears was loaned for a month to Shrewsbury's neighbours A.F.C. Telford United in the National League North. After six games for the Bucks, he was recalled slightly ahead of schedule by Shrews manager John Askey, due to injury to starting right back James Bolton. Sears made his professional debut on 1 September, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1\u20131 home draw with Bristol Rovers. After the game, Askey praised his performance as \"perfect\". He scored his first professional goal on 8 January 2019, opening a 1\u20131 draw at Port Vale in the EFL Trophy third round, which Shrewsbury lost on penalties. In late April 2019, Sears signed a two-year contract extension with the option of a third year. However, he also suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in training, ruling him out for nine months. The following 14 March, he was loaned back to Telford for a month. ==International== In March 2019, Sears was called up for the first time to a Wales under-21 training camp in Monmouthshire. ==References== ==External links== *Soccerway * Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:People from Newtown, Powys Category:Welsh people of English descent Category:Shrewsbury Town F.C. players Category:Newtown A.F.C. players Category:A.F.C.
