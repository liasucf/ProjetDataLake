In 1923 she married the writer Joseph Mal\u00e8gue whose career she actively supported. ==Biography== Grand daughter of a watchmaker in Brancas, daughter of an industrialist of Nantes specialising in vermicelli, she had two sisters and one brother. She benefited from a modern education for her time and her family supported her choice to practice medicine. === First woman in France to be a praticien hospitalier === Pouzin studied at the Ursulines up to an advanced diploma. But attracted by the medical vocation, she prepared at home for her degree, introducing herself to Latin. In November 1905 she began to take courses at the Nantes School of Medicine and interned at the city hospitals. She then went to Paris to prepare for the hospitals' competitive entrance examination. In 1908 she was accepted for a clerkship and in 1912 to that of an internship. She specialised in the treatment of tuberculosis with Professor M\u00e9nard and under the direction of Professor Guinon in childhood medicine. In 1916 she defended her thesis, Chronic cervical lymphadenopathies in children with hereditary syphilis. In 1919, she completed the medical exams at the Hospitals of Nantes, thus becoming the first female in France and could thereby do research in better scientific conditions, influence decisions and have students. (BnF: 353206072) In the 1920s, she participated in the first World Congress of Women Phthisiologists in New York. She was then appointed to serve tuberculosis sufferers, did an internship in Paris with \u00c9douard Rist, who introduced the therapeutic pneumothorax technique, a technique that would be used in the treatment of tuberculosis until the 1950s. She introduced this procedure to , now the central University Hospital in the city. As such, she participated in tuberculosis control in the department. Her medical publications led to her being named in 1924, the corresponding member of the , and she chaired the Nantes Central Office of Social Hygiene just as she organised the anti-tuberculosis dispensary of La Baule.Jean Lebrec, Joseph Mal\u00e8gue, romancier et penseur, p. 100-101. ===Meeting Joseph Mal\u00e8gue=== As a member of the Catholic circle of academics from Nantes, she met the writer Joseph Mal\u00e8gue whom she married on 28 August 1923 at the church of Notre-Dame de Bon-Port. The couple moved into 15 Rue Ars\u00e8ne-Leloup. Jean Lebrec considers Pouzin as the midwife of the first novel of Mal\u00e8gue, '. Mal\u00e8gue's biographer has collected several testimonies from friends of the couple and also cites the essay of Dr. Delaunay Joseph Mal\u00e8gue, from Yvonne Mal\u00e8gue, Estuaires, Bordeaux, 1947 (not paginated). According to Dr. Delaunay, Yvonne Pouzin recognised in Mal\u00e8gue \"exceptional value\" but perhaps also \"weakness\", had assumed and issued her husband \"of an inert part of himself.\" Delaunay ends on a question about the first novel by Mal\u00e8gue, Augustin ou le Ma\u00eetre est l\u00e0: \"Had he put this volume Augustin so demanding of his players, without another will, strong love and faith, might come to support his, remove obstacles, overcoming doubts, negotiate the project execution stage?
