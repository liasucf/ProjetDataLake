    "text": "Lucas (I) from the kindred P\u00e9c () was a Hungarian noble in the first third of the 13th century, who served as Master of the cupbearers from 1229 to 1230. ==Family== Lucas I is the earliest known member of the gens (clan) P\u00e9c, which had large-scale possessions in several counties of Transdanubia, in addition to other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. They originated from Sokor\u00f3 Hills (Gy\u0151r County), their ancient clan estate laid in present-day Felp\u00e9c and Kaj\u00e1rp\u00e9c. Based on the clan's coat-of-arms, it is possible that Lucas was a knight from Western Europe, who arrived to Hungary during the early reign of Andrew II of Hungary. For his military service, he was granted lands in Gy\u0151r County and the surrounding regions. Lucas I had three sons: George served as isp\u00e1n of Zala County from 1243 to 1244; Mark I, who was forefather of the Marcali, Berzencei and Szentgy\u00f6rgyi noble families; and Lucas II (also known as Lucas the Great).Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus P\u00e9c 1. Zala branch) ==Identification== There is a scholarly debate on the difficulty of the identification of Hungarian nobles with the given name \"Lucas\", who were active in the 1230s. 19th-century historian M\u00f3r Wertner considered all of them as a single person in his various academic works, albeit with various sturdiness. He claimed that all of relevant data refer to a certain Lucas, son of Hippolytus, who is mentioned by a charter in 1206. Wertner connected this individual to the P\u00e9c kindred. Subsequently, he slightly modified his viewpoint, and considered Lucas, who functioned as isp\u00e1n of Hont County, was \"probably different person\". Historian Attila Zsoldos analyzed further the question: he separated Lucas, the isp\u00e1n of the Bakony royal forest too, as its office-holders came from a lower social status in the era. Furthermore, as Zsoldos denoted, the isp\u00e1n of Moson County was certainly different person from the isp\u00e1n of Hont County, as they both appeared in the same royal charter in 1239. Attila Zsoldos then considered, there were four (less likely three) different office-bearer nobles with the given name Lucas in the first third of the 13th century: # Lucas, who belonged to the court of King Andrew II. He served as Master of the cupbearers from 1229 to 1230, beside his position of isp\u00e1n of Bars County. Possibly he is identical with that Lucas, who briefly functioned as isp\u00e1n of Pozsony County in 1235. Several historians, including Attila Zsoldos and Tam\u00e1s K\u00e1d\u00e1r considered this baron might be identical with Lucas I P\u00e9c, who rose to the Hungarian elite during his decades of service in the court of Andrew II, but rapidly lost political influence, when B\u00e9la IV of Hungary ascended the Hungarian throne in 1235. # Lucas, who was a confidant of Duke B\u00e9la, who had long opposed his father's land grants and policy. He was Ban of Severin (which belonged to the duke's domain) in 1233, following his predecessor Buz\u00e1d Hah\u00f3t's retirement. After B\u00e9la's coronation as Hungarian king, he served as isp\u00e1n of Moson County between 1235 and 1240. It is plausible he was killed during the First Mongol invasion of Hungary. # Lucas, who came from a lower social status (possibly royal servant), and functioned as count of the Bakony royal forest from 1232 to 1233. # Lucas, who was isp\u00e1n of Hont County from 1237 to 1239. It is possible that he is identical with #1 Lucas (thus plausibly Lucas P\u00e9c), who was forced to be satisfied with this relatively insignificant position after B\u00e9la IV's enthronement. == References == == Sources == * * Category:13th-century Hungarian people Lucas 01 ",
