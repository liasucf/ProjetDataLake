    "text": "The 2016 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament (also known as the 2016 College Cup) was the 58th annual single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion of NCAA Division I men's collegiate soccer. The first, second, third, and quarterfinal rounds were held at college campus sites across the United States during November and December 2016, with host sites determined by seeding and record. The four-team College Cup finals was played at BBVA Compass Stadium in Houston, Texas on December 9 and 11, 2016. The Stanford Cardinal successfully defended their 2015 title. Stanford played the North Carolina Tar Heels to a scoreless draw in the semifinals before winning a penalty shootout, 10\u20139, to advance to the Championship game. The Cardinal then also tied the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, 0\u20130, in the final before claiming the back-to-back title with another penalty shootout victory, 5\u20134. Stanford tied the NCAA record for the Lowest Goals-Against Average in the Tournament (Minimum 3 Games) of 0.00 by becoming the fourth team to not allow their opponents to score a goal in the tournament. The other three co-record- holders are the 1976 San Francisco Dons, the 1995 Wisconsin Badgers, and the 2009 Akron Zips. ==Qualification== All Division I men's soccer programs except for Grand Canyon, Incarnate Word, and UMass Lowell will be eligible to qualify for the tournament. Those three programs are ineligible because they are in transition from Division II to Division I. The tournament field remains fixed at 48 teams. Of the 24 schools that had previously won the championship, 13 qualified for this year's tournament. == Format == As in previous editions of the NCAA Division I Tournament, the tournament features 48 participants out of a possible field of 203 teams. Of the 48 berths, 24 are allocated to the 21 conference tournament champions and to the regular season winners of the Ivy League, Pac-12 Conference, and West Coast Conference, which do not have tournaments. The remaining 24 berths are supposed to be determined through an at-large process based upon the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) of teams that did not automatically qualify. The NCAA Selection Committee also names the top sixteen seeds for the tournament, with those teams receiving an automatic bye into the second round of the tournament. The remaining 32 teams play in a single-elimination match in the first round of the tournament for the right to play a seeded team in the second round. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" | Seeded teams |- !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Seed !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|School !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Conference !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Record !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Berth type !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|NSCAA Ranking !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|RPI Ranking |- | 1 | Maryland | Big Ten | 18\u20130\u20132 | Tournament Champion | align=center | 1 | align=center | 1 |- | 2 | Wake Forest | ACC | 15\u20132\u20133 | Tournament Champion | align=center | 2 | align=center | 3 |- | 3 | Clemson | ACC | 13\u20133\u20134 | At Large | align=center | 3 | align=center | 2 |- | 4 | Louisville | ACC | 12\u20135\u20132 | At Large | align=center | 9 | align=center | 6 |- | 5 | Stanford | PAC-12 | 11\u20133\u20134 | Conference Champion | align=center | 8 | align=center | 5 |- | 6 | Denver | Summit | 17\u20130\u20133 | Tournament Champion | align=center | 4 | align=center | 7 |- | 7 | Indiana | Big Ten | 11\u20131\u20137 | At Large | align=center | 7 | align=center | 15 |- | 8 | Syracuse | ACC | 11\u20134\u20133 | At Large | align=center | 6 | align=center | 9 |- | 9 | North Carolina | ACC | 11\u20133\u20133 | At Large | align=center | 10 | align=center | 10 |- | 10 | Charlotte | C-USA | 12\u20133\u20132 | At Large | align=center | 5 | align=center | 14 |- | 11 | Washington | Pac-12 | 13\u20136\u20130 | At Large | align=center | 14 | align=center | 8 |- | 12 | Virginia | ACC | 10\u20133\u20135 | At Large | align=center | 17 | align=center | 20 |- | 13 | Notre Dame | ACC | 11\u20137\u20132 | At Large | align=center | 20 | align=center |13 |- | 14 | Albany | America East | 12\u20135\u20132 | Tournament Champion | align=center | RV | align=center | 12 |- | 15 | Butler | Big East | 13\u20135\u20131 | Tournament Champion | align=center | 15 | align=center | 11 |- | 16 | Kentucky | C-USA | 11\u20134\u20133 | At Large | align=center | 19 | align=center | 18 |} == Schedule == {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Round !Date |- |First round |November 17, 2016 |- |Second round |November 20, 2016 |- |Third round |November 26\u201327, 2016 |- |Quarterfinals |December 2 \u2212 4, 2016 |- |College Cup: Semifinals |December 9, 2016 |- |College Cup Final |December 11, 2016 |- |} ==Bracket== === Regional 1 === === Regional 2 === === Regional 3 === === Regional 4 === ===2016 College Cup=== == Results == === First round === === Second round === === Third round === === Quarterfinals === === College Cup === ==== Semifinals ==== ==== National Championship ==== == Statistics == === Goalscorers === ;4 goals * Julian Gressel \u2014 Providence ;3 goals * Alex Happi \u2014 Clemson * Foster Langsdorf \u2014 Stanford * Brian Wright \u2014 Vermont * Nico Quashie \u2014 Virginia Tech * Jon Bakero \u2014 Wake Forest ;2 goals * Nick Hinds \u2014 Akron * Austen Burnikel \u2014 Clemson * Kortne Ford \u2014 Denver * Andre Shinyashiki \u2014 Denver * Albert Ruiz \u2014 Florida Gulf Coast * Tate Schmitt \u2014 Louisville * Amar Sejdi\u010d \u2014 Maryland * Tucker Hume \u2014 North Carolina * Jon Gallagher \u2014 Notre Dame * Sergio Carmago \u2014 Syracuse * Abu Danladi \u2014 UCLA * Marcelo Acu\u00f1a \u2014 Virginia Tech * Ema Twumasi \u2014 Wake Forest ;1 goal * Carlos Clark \u2014 Albany * Bernardo Mattos \u2014 Albany * Afonso Pinheiro \u2014 Albany * Nico Solabarrieta \u2014 Albany * Zeiko Lewis \u2014 Boston College * Brandt Bronico \u2014 Charlotte * Daniel Bruce \u2014 Charlotte * Einar Einarsson \u2014 Coastal Carolina * Frantzdy Pierrot \u2014 Coastal Carolina * Zach Pagani \u2014 Colgate * Bruno Scodari \u2014 Colgate * Myles Englis \u2014 Creighton * Mitch LaGro \u2014 Creighton * Ricky Lopez-Espin \u2014 Creighton * Ricardo Perez \u2014 Creighton * Joel Rydstrand \u2014 Creighton * Karim Sawaf \u2014 Creighton * Matt Danilack \u2014 Dartmouth * Chandler Crosswait \u2014 Denver * Scott DeVoss \u2014 Denver * Alex Underwood \u2014 Denver * Robert Ferrer \u2014 Florida Gulf Coast * Justin Gavin \u2014 Florida Gulf Coast * Grant Lillard \u2014 Indiana * Billy McConnell \u2014 Indiana * Kevin Barajas \u2014 Kentucky * J.
