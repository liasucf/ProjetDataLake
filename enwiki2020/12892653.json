    "text": "{| |} The Kinner B-5 was a popular five cylinder American radial engine for light general and sport aircraft of the 1930s. ==Design and development== The B-5 was a development of the earlier K-5 with slightly greater power and dimensions. The main change was the increase in cylinder bore from 108 mm (4.25 in) to 117 mm (4.625 in) and a corresponding increase in displacement from 372 cu in (6.1 liters ) to 441 cu in (7.2 liters ). One difference the B-5 had from radial engines of other manufacturers was that each individual cylinder had its own camshaft, a system also used by the contemporary Soviet- built, 8.6 litre-displacement Shvetsov M-11 five cylinder radial, while most other radial engine designs used a \"cam ring\" for the same purpose, connected to every cylinder's valves. The B-5 was a rough running but reliable engine. The B-5 and its derivatives were produced in the thousands, powering many World War II trainer aircraft; its military designation was R-440. The B-5 was followed by the R-5 and R-55. ==Applications== *Fleet Fawn *Fleet Finch *Kinner Sportster *Kinner Sportwing *Lincoln AP *Monocoupe 125 *Redfern DH-2 *Ryan PT-22 Recruit *Savoia-Marchetti S.56 ==Specifications (Kinner B-5)== ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Duxford/usaero4.htm Category:1930s aircraft piston engines Category:Aircraft air-cooled radial piston engines ",
