Club Brugge was left without a trophy but had a chance for revenge and a consolation prize with the cup final only a week after the end of the league. In the league, Club Brugge had not lost against Anderlecht (0-0 and 0-3) and was deemed slight favorite before the match. Due to construction at the King Baudouin Stadium, the game was exceptionally played at the Stade Maurice Dufrasne in Li\u00e8ge. Anderlecht, who were mainly dangerous on counterattacks, managed to score during the first half following a bad pass from Dirk Medved. Bruno Versavel rounded goalkeeper Dany Verlinden to open the scoring. After half time Lorenzo Staelens, who had scored a hattrick against Anderlecht in the league, scored an equalizer which was disallowed after an earlier foul by a teammate. Immediately thereafter Luc Nilis scored the 2-0 on assist from Bruno Versavel. No further goals were scored, allowing Anderlecht to win both league and cup for the third time in their history ===Details=== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK || 1 || Filip De Wilde |- |RB || 2 || Philip Haagdoren |- |CB || 3 || Graeme Rutjes |- |CB || 4 || Philippe Albert || |- |LB || 5 || Michel De Wolf |- |MF || 11 || Danny Boffin || || |- |MF || 6 || Marc Emmers |- |MF || 8 || Johan Walem |- |MF || 7 || Bruno Versavel |- |FW || 9 || John Bosman || || |- |FW || 10 || Luc Nilis (c) |- |colspan=4|Substitutes: |- |GK || || Peter Maes |- |CB || || Bertrand Crasson || |- |MF || || P\u00e4r Zetterberg || |- |MF || || Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Peiremans |- |FW || || Yaw Preko |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Johan Boskamp |} |valign=\"top\"|300px |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=center |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK || 1 || Dany Verlinden |- |RB || 2 || Dirk Medved || || |- |CB || 3 || Pascal Plovie |- |CB || 4 || Paul Okon || |- |LB || 6 || Pascal Renier |- |MF || 5 || Vital Borkelmans |- |MF || 7 || Gert Verheyen |- |MF || 8 || Franky Van der Elst (c) |- |MF || 10 || Lorenzo Staelens |- |FW || 11 || Daniel Amokachi |- |FW || 9 || Ren\u00e9 Eijkelkamp |- |colspan=4|Substitutes: |- |MF || || Sven Vermant || || |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Hugo Broos |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | Linesmen: Jean-Pierre Wauthelet Marc Van den Broeck Assistant referee: Robert Jeurissen |style=\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\"| Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra time if necessary. *Penalty shoot-out if scores still level. *Maximum of three substitutions. |} ==External links== * 1994 Cup Final Category:Club Brugge KV matches Category:R.S.C.
