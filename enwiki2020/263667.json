He has also been listed by Rhapsody as a key artist in the history of European pop music, with his signature song \"\u015e\u0131mar\u0131k\" as a keystone track that moved the genre forward. His albums have sold over 15 million copies. Throughout his career, he has won four Turkey Music Awards, six Golden Butterfly Awards and one World Music Award and has received various nominations. == Early life == Tarkan Teveto\u011flu was born on 17 October 1972 in Alzey, West Germany, to Ne\u015fe and Ali Teveto\u011flu. His mother named him after the comic book character Tarkan. The name Tarkan is said to originate from an ancient Turkic king or title, meaning bold and strong. Tarkan's interest in music began in childhood. Tarkan and his five siblings moved to Turkey in 1986 with their parents settled in Karam\u00fcrsel, Kocaeli. After his father's death, his mother married an architect, Seyhun Kahraman.Annesini evlendirdi (He got his mother married) \u2013 H\u00fcrriyet Tarkan has three step-siblings named Adnan, G\u00fclay and Nuray, from his mother's first marriage, and a brother, Hakan, and a younger sister, Handan, from her marriage to his father.Star olan \u00e7ocuk (The kid that became a star) \u2013 Milliyet Tarkan started his high school there and took Turkish Art and Music lessons at the Karam\u00fcrsel Advanced Music Association. After his family moved to Istanbul, he continued his music studies at the Uskudar Music Society and started performing at various venues. After finishing high school, he made plans to move to Germany for higher education and meanwhile he signed a contract with \u0130stanbul Plak's owner Mehmet S\u00f6\u011f\u00fcto\u011flu to release his first album. == Career == === 1992\u20132000: Yine Sensiz, Aacayipsin and \u00d6l\u00fcr\u00fcm Sana === Tarkan's first album, Yine Sensiz, was released on cassettes by \u0130stanbul Plak on 26 December 1992. He wrote the lyrics for three of the album's songs, and composed three other songs himself and chose \"K\u0131l Oldum\" to be its lead single. On 18 June 1993, three new versions of the album were released on CD. Alongside \"K\u0131l Oldum\", he made music videos for the songs \"Kimdi\", \"Gelip de Halimi G\u00f6rd\u00fcn m\u00fc?\", \"Vazge\u00e7emem\" and \"\u00c7ok Arars\u0131n Beni\". The album sold 700,000 copies in total. Wrote one critic: \"It happened maybe for the first time in the world of [Turkish] music, that \"slang\" words were used in songs and the brave young man began to draw attention as much with his songs as with his green eyes.\" In May 1994, his second studio album Aacayipsin was released in Turkey; it was subsequently released in Germany and Russia in 1996 and 1998 respectively.Aacayipsins release dates: *Turkey: *Germany: *Russia: Artists Sezen Aksu, \u00dcmit Say\u0131n, Ozan \u00c7olako\u011flu and Y\u0131ld\u0131z Tilbe were among those who were featured on the album. Tarkan wrote the lyrics for four songs, three of which were also composed by him; \"Hepsi Senin mi?\", \"Unutmamal\u0131\", \"G\u00fcl D\u00f6kt\u00fcm Yollar\u0131na\", \"K\u0131\u015f G\u00fcne\u015fi\", \"\u015eeytan Azapta\", \"D\u00f6n Bebe\u011fim\" and \"Bekle\" were the songs that got separate music videos. Aacayipsin sold two and a half million copies and earned Tarkan the \"Best Male Pop Music Artist\" award at the Turkey Music Awards. The song \"Hepsi Senin mi?\" was also awarded with the \"Best Lyrics\", \"Best Composition\" and \"Best Song\" awards. In 1994, he experienced a dip in his celebrity status after he made a gaffe during an interview on a live broadcast marking the anniversary of the private Turkish TV channel ATV. When asked how he was on live television, his response was \"\u00c7i\u015fim var, a\u011fabey.\" (\"I've gotta pee, man.\") He was publicly criticised for the comment and only after performing traditional songs on another TV special did he endear himself again to the nation. In part to remove himself from media scrutiny, Tarkan moved to New York in 1994 to learn English and complete his education at Baruch College.Tarkan: From the stage to the barracks \u2013 Turkish Daily News During this period he filmed a video to another song from his second album, \"D\u00f6n Bebe\u011fim\", in New York. Again Tarkan stripped for this project, but this time he was sharing a bed with a female American model for the slow love song. While in the United States, he met the Turkish founder of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun. Tarkan has described Ertegun as his mentor in music and business. Ertegun, who died in December 2006, had long been preparing Tarkan for an American career. In 1997, Tarkan found his own production company Hitt M\u00fczik and in the same year he released his third studio album \u00d6l\u00fcr\u00fcm Sana, which sold three and a half million copies. Tarkan himself did the songwriting and composition for many of the songs on this album. \"\u015e\u0131mar\u0131k\", \"\u0130kimizin Yerine\", \"Sal\u0131na Sal\u0131na Sinsice\", \"\u00d6l\u00fcr\u00fcm Sana\" and \"K\u0131r Zincirlerini\" were the songs for which music videos were made. \"\u015e\u0131mar\u0131k\" became a hit in many countries; ranking third in France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland; second in Norway; and first in Belgium; it also ranked 26th on Billboard list of Latin Pop Songs. The song was later performed by many other artists. The song \"K\u0131r Zincirleri\" also made it into Germany, Belgium and France's music charts. A copyright dispute erupted between Tarkan and Aksu over the track \"\u015e\u0131mar\u0131k\", which ultimately blocked the singer's chance to release an English-language version of the song. The music was initially credited as composed by Aksu, Tarkan and \u00c7olako\u011flu, but Tarkan later admitted in a 2006 interview that this had been done without Aksu's consent, and that Aksu was the true copyright owner. This dispute ended their successful musical partnership and friendship. In 1998, Tarkan signed a contract with Universal Music Group. (Note: You have to click on the biography section on the opened site.) In the same year, his compilation album Tarkan was released in a number of countries including France, Argentina, Russia and the Netherlands, and it also contained his signature songs from his previous albums. Tarkan sold one and a half million copies worldwide earning the singer a platinum certification from Mexico, and gold certifications from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Colombia and Luxembourg. In 1999, Tarkan, who already had high sales figures around the world, was honored at the World Music Awards as the Best-Selling Turkish Artist. As the first artist of Turkish origin to sell 500,000 albums in France, in an interview for CNN he said: \"It feels wild, you know, because in the beginning I never thought it was going to really happen. It's all in Turkish, you know, and nobody understands a word. But I think it's a groove. It's the kisses that are universal.\" His entry into the European musical consciousness started a Turkish pop boom in Germany and Turkey in the 1990s, with his European successes signalling that the musical borders between Turkey and Europe, more specifically Germany, were dissolving. Because of his success, he became the prime example of a Turkish pop performer with an audience outside Turkey. His erotic persona was enhanced when the artist posed naked and semi-naked for the most popular Turkish magazines of the period. === 2001\u201306: Karma, Dudu and Come Closer === Tarkan in Vienna in 2006 Tarkan released the lead single of his fourth studio album \"Kuzu Kuzu\" in May 2001, which sold 200,000 copies on cassettes and 500,000 copies in CD format. Three months later, in July 2001 his fourth studio album Karma was released. Tarkan wrote and composed six of the songs, and Nazan \u00d6ncel, Mete \u00d6zgencil and Mazhar Alanson helped in its preparing. The album Karma sold one and a half million copies. Although Karma was not released worldwide, it was distributed in large shipments to Russia, where he had become the largest-selling non-Russian pop star. A million copies shipped to other areas of Europe, including Denmark. \"H\u00fcp\" and \"Verme\", became the album's other songs to get music videos, and the clip for \"H\u00fcp\" was subject to various negative criticisms. When the video, directed by Ferzan \u00d6zpetek, was released, the Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council considered banning it from television broadcast, as some viewers complained that the scene in which Tarkan kisses actress Sinemis Candemir was too \"explicit\" and \"pornographic\". The case was reported through Europe by the BBC. At the Golden Butterfly Awards, \"H\u00fcp\" was awarded with the \"Best Video Clip\" award; and Tarkan himself received the \"Best Male Turkish Pop Music Soloist\" award in addition to an honorary award. Tarkan's so-called Karma-era style projected an image totally different from his earlier persona in respect to both music and looks. His appearance \u2013 tight trousers, loose, unbuttoned shirts or tight T-shirts \u2013 and his new hairdo set a trend among young Turkish men, who started to copy his looks. According to hairdressers, his Kuzu Kuzu hairstyle was the most frequently requested style in the salons of Turkey. During this time he met Michael Lang, co-organiser of the Woodstock Festival, who became his international manager. According to Lang, Tarkan is a great singer and his performance is great. In 2001 researcher Dr. N Aysun Y\u00fcksel published a book titled Tarkan \u2013 Y\u0131ld\u0131z Olgusu (Tarkan \u2013 Anatomy of a Star), which was withdrawn from bookshelves by a court order after Tarkan's lawyer S\u00fcheyl Atay sued the writer. According to the court's decision the book published personal information and copyrighted photos of the artist, and violated his good reputation.Tarkan hakk\u0131ndaki kitap toplat\u0131ld\u0131 (The book about Tarkan is withdrawn) \u2013 H\u00fcrriyet In 2002, Tarkan released two new singles \"\u00d6zg\u00fcrl\u00fck \u0130\u00e7imizde\" and \"Bir Oluruz Yolunda\"; modifications in the song \"Bir Oluruz Yolunda\" were made for the Turkish national football team's entry to the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Tarkan's EP album Dudu was produced by Ozan \u00c7olako\u011flu and released in summer 2003 in Turkey, Ukraine, Russia and Japan. It was the first album of its kind to sell over a million copies in Turkey, while the title track won Tarkan a \"Song of the Year Award\" in Russia. Although musically a continuation from Karma, in terms of image Dudu presented different visuals from the 2001\u20132003 period. Sexuality became secondary in terms of fashion and concerts were toned down to become intimate affairs. The new image portrayed a more laid back Tarkan sporting shorter hair and wearing less glamorous designs. It was a declaration that glitz and sex were no longer a necessary tool to sell his works. Indicating his desire to show different sides of his personality, he said of his new look: \"It's not important how sexy I look or whether I dance sexy\". \"Dudu\", \"Sorma Kalbim\", \"G\u00fcl\u00fcmse Kaderine\" and \"Uzun \u0130nce Bir Yolday\u0131m\", were the song from the EP that were made into music videos. The album sold one million copies. In 2004, Tarkan was chosen as the \"Best Male Pop Music Artist\" at the Turkey Music Awards. In 2005, Tarkan released the single \"Ayr\u0131l\u0131k Zor\" followed by \"Bounce\" in 2006, which was sold in Europe as well. In April 2006, after a long period of preparations, he released his English studio album Come Closer on 7 April. It included 15 songs in total. The plans for Come Closer had begun in 1995, when media mogul Ahmet Ertegun encouraged Tarkan to break into the international market. The album, ranked 18th on Germany's music charts, 43rd on Switzerland's charts, 50th on Austria's charts; and sold 110,000 copies in Turkey.Come Closers position on charts: *Germany: *Austria: *Switzerland: A Turkish music pirate, well before the official release, leaked four stolen demo recordings from the debut English album onto the internet. Thousands of copies were downloaded illegally before the album's official release. The leaked songs garnered considerable airplay in dance clubs in Turkey before Tarkan's management took legal action against DJ's playing them. === 2007\u201315: Metamorfoz and Ad\u0131m\u0131 Kalbine Yaz === Tarkan in Skopje in 2007 On 23 December 2007, Tarkan's sixth studio album Metamorfoz was released. Tarkan wrote all of the songs of this album, and composed seven of them. For the Turkish idioms and proverbs widely used in the lyrics, he was praised by the Turkish Language Association, showing in the association's view a good example to Turkish youth in preserving the culture of the Turkish language. The critical response to Metamorfoz was lukewarm. Most music critics found the album musically lacking in comparison with Tarkan's earlier albums. Ecevit K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, columnist for Sabah newspaper, hailed Tarkan on his return and called him the \"Orhan Pamuk of music\", saying that Tarkan, just like Nobel award recipient Pamuk, always does everything his own way, despite all the attacks he has received from the press.M\u00fczigin Orhan Pamuk'u (Music's Orhan Pamuk) \u2013 Sabah.

In the same year, the singer released the song \"Uyan\", which he prepared to support Do\u011fa Derne\u011fi (Nature Society).

The deadline for beginning his service had passed in 1998, but due to contractual obligations abroad after the success of his compilation album he did not return to Turkey to do his military service. The media discussed whether Tarkan should be viewed as a deserter and stripped of his citizenship. Even the Turkish parliament discussed the issue.Tarkan Fransa ve Bel\u00e7ika'da pop listelerinde hizla y\u00fckseliyor \u2013 Milliyet After the August 1999 earthquake shook Turkey, legislation was enacted that allowed those covered by the law to pay $16,000 for the benefit of the earthquake victims in return for shortening their military service obligation to 28 days. Tarkan returned to Turkey in 2000, took advantage of this law, and completed his service. Of his shortened time in military training, he said: \"It was January and snowing like crazy. It was tough; the food was terrible. Eighteen months of my life for nothing? I thought my own dreams were more important.\" ===Relationships and rumours=== Tarkan was in a relationship with a French model in the early 1990s, and with a Turkish journalist between 1994 and 1996. Because Tarkan does not like to talk about his personal life, there has been speculation about his sexual orientation in the popular press. Photos stolen from his house in New York in 2001 were portrayed as compromising; they were photos with other men in swimwear at a public nude beach. In one of the pictures he appears to be kissing a man. In an interview with H\u00fcrriyet, Tarkan contested the widespread assumption that he was gay. He said that men spread the rumours, because he didn't conform to their image of being a man. One of his ex-girlfriends also denied he was gay. Tarkan later gave fewer and fewer interviews and television appearances, limiting himself to a small number of trusted journalists. In 2006, he said that his relationship with the media had gone wrong.Arman, Ay\u015fe.
