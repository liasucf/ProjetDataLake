A version with Stuart Cable singing vocals can be found on CD1 on the \"Hurry Up and Wait\" single. ==Music video== The video was inspired as an homage to the cult 1969 road film Easy Rider. The idea supposedly came from the band's love for the movie. It shows the band as characters from the film, making a road trip through America on motorbikes. ==Track listing== CD1 # \"I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio\" (single version) # \"The Bartender and the Thief\" (Bar Version) # \"The Old Laughing Lady\" CD2 # \"I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio\" (live at Morfa Stadium) # \"Pick a Part That's New\" (live at Morfa Stadium) # \"T-Shirt Suntan\" (live at Morfa Stadium) ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !Chart (1999) !Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |40 |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1998 songs Category:1999 singles Category:Songs about radio Category:Songs written by Kelly Jones Category:V2 Records singles ",
