When she debuted, she had been a member of a music group, Cookies; however, the members of Cookies were eventually arranged to explore their respective solo careers in 2005, and the group is now disbanded. She had temporarily been the lead vocals of rock band Ping Pung in 2004, but Ping Pung had also disbanded after only releasing one album that same year. Commencing in 2005, Ng had officially begun developing her career as a solo artist. As a girl, Ng had studied at the Canadian International School of Hong Kong. She had made references to her nickname \"Lady K\" in the album titles \"Lady K Live\" and \"Lady K: Transformation\". ==Career== In 2002, at age 15, Ng was one of the nine members and also youngest of the girl band Cookies, signed under record giant Gold Label of EMI Hong Kong.\u9032\u5316\u8ad6 \u5433\u96e8\u970f That same year, she became the youngest recipient to have ever earned a CRHK music award when Cookies were awarded \"Best Group Newcomer \u2013 Bronze Award\"; she was 16 at the time and currently still holds this record.\u4f59\u6587\u6a02\u8207\u5973\u53cb\u5433\u96e8\u970f\u66fe\u5206\u624b \u5973\u8ffd\u7537\u5f8c\u5fa9\u5408 Her male counterpart of this record is Nicholas Tse, who was 17 when he received \"Best Male Newcomer \u2013 Silver Award\" in 1999. In 2003, Cookies were downsized from the original nine members to only four members. Ng was one of the four members who successfully remained with the group, along with Stephy Tang, Theresa Fu, and Miki Yeung. In 2004, she joined another rock band \u2013 Ping Pung and released the album \"Love & Hate\". During this time, she continued to retain her membership in Cookies.
