    "text": "The Sweet Life Stakes is a Grade III American Thoroughbred horse race for three years old fillies over the distance of furlongs on the turf scheduled annually in February at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. The event currently carries a purse of $100,000. ==History== The race was inaugurated in 2010 and the event was run over the 1 mile distance and was raced on the downhill turf course over the about furlongs distance. The event is named in honor of the 2009 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year Sweet Life. Sweet Life was the dam of 2004 American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly Sweet Catomine and 2009 GI Breeders' Cup Ladies' Classic winner Life Is Sweet. Also Sweet Life was victorious in the 1999 Providencia Stakes at Santa Anita Park. In 2019 the event was upgraded to a Grade III event but was run on the dirt track due to inclement weather. In 2020 the event was run at a distance of furlongs on turf, using the backstretch start. ==Records== Speed record: * about furlongs - 1:12.00 \u2013 Rose Catherine (2010) Margins: * lengths - Rose Catherine (2010) ;Most wins by a jockey * 2 - Rafael Bejarano (2013, 2014) ;Most wins by a trainer * 3 - Peter L.
