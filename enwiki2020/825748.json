    "text": "Propene, also known as propylene or methyl ethylene, is an unsaturated organic compound with the chemical formula C3H6. It has one double bond, and is the second simplest member of the alkene class of hydrocarbons. It is a colorless gas with a faint petroleum-like odor ==Production== ===Steam cracking=== The dominant technology for producing propylene is steam cracking. The same technology is applied to ethane to ethylene. These two conversions are the #2 and #1 processes in the chemical industry, as judged by their scale. In this process, propane undergoes dehydrogenation. The by-product is hydrogen: :CH3CH2CH3 \u2192 CH3CH=CH2 \\+ H2 The yield of propene is about 85 m%. By-products are usually used as fuel for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Steam cracking is one of the most energy-intensive industrial processes. The feedstock is naphtha or propane, especially in the Middle East, where there is an abundance of propane from oil/gas operations.Ashford\u2019s Dictionary of Industrial Chemicals, Third edition, 2011, , pages 7766-9 Propene can be separated by fractional distillation from hydrocarbon mixtures obtained from cracking and other refining processes; refinery-grade propene is about 50 to 70%. In the United States shale gas is a major source of propane. ===Olefin conversion technology=== In the Phillips Triolefin or Olefin conversion technology propylene is interconverted with ethylene and 2-butenes. Rhenium and molybdenum catalysts are used: :CH2=CH2 \\+ CH3CH=CHCH3 \u2192 2 CH2=CHCH3 The technology is founded on an olefin metathesis reaction discovered at Phillips Petroleum Company. Propene yields of about 90 wt% are achieved. Related is the Methanol-to-Olefins/Methanol-to-Propene process. It converts synthesis gas (syngas) to methanol, and then converts the methanol to ethylene and/or propene. The process produces water as by-product. Synthesis gas is produced from |the reformation of natural gas or by the steam-induced reformation of petroleum products such as naphtha, or by gasification of coal. ===Fluid catalytic cracking=== High severity fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) uses traditional FCC technology under severe conditions (higher catalyst-to-oil ratios, higher steam injection rates, higher temperatures, etc.) in order to maximize the amount of propene and other light products. A high severity FCC unit is usually fed with gas oils (paraffins) and residues, and produces about 20\u201325 m% propene on feedstock together with greater volumes of motor gasoline and distillate byproducts. ===Market and research=== Propene production has remained static at around 35 million tonnes (Europe and North America only) from 2000 to 2008, but it has been increasing in East Asia, most notably Singapore and China. Total world production of propene is currently about half that of ethylene. The use of engineered enzymes has been explored but is of no commercial value. ==Uses== Propene is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene. It is the raw material for a wide variety of products. Manufacturers of the plastic polypropylene account for nearly two thirds of all demand. Polypropylene end uses include films, fibers, containers, packaging, and caps and closures. Propene is also used for the production of important chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, cumene, butyraldehyde, and acrylic acid. In the year 2013 about 85 million tonnes of propene were processed worldwide. Propene and benzene are converted to acetone and phenol via the cumene process. Overview of the cumene process Propene is also used to produce isopropanol (propan-2-ol), acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and epichlorohydrin. The industrial production of acrylic acid involves the catalytic partial oxidation of propene. Propene is also an intermediate in the one-step propane selective oxidation to acrylic acid. In industry and workshops, propene is used as an alternative fuel to acetylene in Oxy-fuel welding and cutting, brazing and heating of metal for the purpose of bending. It has become a standard in BernzOmatic products and others in MAPP substitutes,For example, \"MAPP-Pro\" now that true MAPP gas is no longer available. ==Reactions== Propene resembles other alkenes in that it undergoes addition reactions relatively easily at room temperature. The relative weakness of its double bond explains its tendency to react with substances that can achieve this transformation. Alkene reactions include: 1) polymerization, 2) oxidation, 3) halogenation and hydrohalogenation, 4) alkylation, 5) hydration, 6) oligomerization, and 7) hydroformylation. ===Combustion=== Propene undergoes combustion reactions in a similar fashion to other alkenes. In the presence of sufficient or excess oxygen, propene burns to form water and carbon dioxide. :2 C3H6 \\+ 9 O2 \u2192 6 CO2 \\+ 6 H2O When insufficient oxygen is present for complete combustion, incomplete combustion occurs allowing carbon monoxide and/or soot (carbon) to be formed as well. :C3H6 \\+ 2 O2 \u2192 3 H2O + 2 C + CO ==Environmental safety== Propene is a product of combustion from forest fires, cigarette smoke, and motor vehicle and aircraft exhaust. It is an impurity in some heating gases. Observed concentrations have been in the range of 0.1-4.8 parts per billion (ppb) in rural air, 4-10.5 ppb in urban air, and 7-260 ppb in industrial air samples. In the United States and some European countries a threshold limit value of 500 parts per million (ppm) was established for occupational (8-hour time- weighted average) exposure. It is considered a volatile organic compound (VOC) and emissions are regulated by many governments, but it is not listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous air pollutant under the Clean Air Act. With a relatively short half-life, it is not expected to bioaccumulate. Propene has low acute toxicity from inhalation. Inhalation of the gas can cause anesthetic effects and at very high concentrations, unconsciousness. However, the asphyxiation limit for humans is about 10 times higher (23%) than the lower flammability level. ==Storage and handling== Since propene is volatile and flammable, precautions must be taken to avoid fire hazards in the handling of the gas. If propene is loaded to any equipment capable of causing ignition, such equipment should be shut down while loading, unloading, connecting or disconnecting. Propene is usually stored as liquid under pressure, although it is also possible to store it safely as gas at ambient temperature in approved containers.Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth edition, 1996, (v.20), page 261 ===Pharmacology=== Propene acts as a central nervous system depressant via allosteric agonism of the GABAA receptor. Excessive exposure may result in sedation and amnesia, progressing to coma and death in a mechanism equivalent to benzodiazepine overdose. Intentional inhalation may also result in death via asphyxiation (sudden inhalant death). ==Occurrence in nature== Propene is detected in the interstellar medium through microwave spectroscopy. On September 30, 2013, NASA also announced that the Cassini orbiter spacecraft, part of the Cassini- Huygens mission, had discovered small amounts of naturally occurring propene in the atmosphere of Titan using spectroscopy. ==See also== * Los Alfaques Disaster * Inhalant abuse * 2014 Kaohsiung gas explosions * 2020 Houston explosion ==References== Category:Alkenes Category:Monomers Category:Commodity chemicals Category:Petrochemicals Category:GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators Category:Gases Category:Allyl compounds ",
