    "text": "The Alfa Romeo 156 (Type 932) is a compact executive car produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Alfa Romeo. It was introduced at the 1997 Frankfurt Motor Show as the replacement for the Alfa Romeo 155. The 156 received a positive reception and in the following year went on to win the 1998 European Car of the Year award. The 156 saloon was discontinued in Europe late in 2005, while the Q4 Crosswagon continued in production until the end of 2007. Cars were assembled at the Fiat Group factory in Pomigliano d'Arco, Italy and at a General Motors facility in Rayong, Thailand. Production in Thailand began in March 2002 and ran for only a couple of years. The cars produced there were targeted for the Asia-Pacific markets. Between 1997 and 2005, approximately 680,000 units of the 156 were produced. The 156 was available in saloon, Sportwagon (estate) and Crosswagon (crossover) bodystyles with seven engine configurations; it went through two facelifts, first in 2002 and then in 2003. The Sportwagon advertising campaign was made featuring actress Catherine Zeta-Jones. In 2007 the 159 became the replacement for the 156. This replacement vehicle went on to also spawn the Brera, the three-door coup\u00e9 that replaced the Alfa Romeo GTV along with its convertible variant, the new Spider. == Overview == Since the 156's introduction, various four cylinder engine configurations were available and included the Alfa Romeo Twin Spark engine (1.6 L - , 1.8 L - and 2.0 L - ) 16 valve models with variable valve timing, along with the straight-4 1.9 litre 8-valve . The range also included a straight-5 2.4 litre 10-valve JTD common rail turbodiesel engine. Until January 2002, the range-topping engine was the venerable 2.5 litre 24-valve Busso V6 - now with double overhead camshafts and four-valve heads - rated at . Initially the 156 range was available with different options (packs) like a sport pack that included Blitz clothing, Momo leather interior and Recaro seats, it also included wheels, lowered suspension and leather-trimmed steering wheel and gear knob. The Lusso pack added with Momo's mahogany steering wheel and gear knob and for Nordic countries, a special winter pack consisting of fog lights, headlight washers, and heated seats was available. 156 Sportwagon (2003 facelift) Starting from 1999 a five-speed Selespeed automated manual transmission was available as an option on the 2.0 litre Twin Spark version and a four-speed automatic Q-System on the 2.5 litre V6 version, the Q-system provided the option of using the car as a normal automatic or being able to shift manually with H-pattern, it has three automatic modes: city, sport and ice. A significant addition to the 156 range came in 2000 with the introduction of the Sportwagon Station wagon or estate bodystyle, a first attempt at this configuration for the company. The Sportwagon was also available with Boge-Nivomat self-levelling hydropneumatic rear suspension. The Sportwagon was marketed as a lifestyle estate without large carrying capacity. The Sportwagon bodystyle filled a gap in the market that Alfa Romeo had distanced themselves from since the 33 SportWagon of the 1980s. In 2001 engines were upgraded to comply with the Euro III standards and were rated at (1.6 L), (1.8 L), (2.0 L) and (2.5 L). ==Design== Designed by Alfa Centro Stile under the guidance of head designer Walter de'Silva the 156s shape was intended to be distinctly Alfa Romeo. Its styling included high, curved flanks, retro styled front door handles, recessed rear door handles, and a deep grille requiring an off-centre licence plate holder. The design featured visually deemphasized rear door handles and accentuated front handles, giving the illusion of a coup\u00e9 profile. The design was influenced by the Alfa Romeo 1900, Giulietta and Giulia. The 156 achieved a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.31. ===Interior=== The original interior uses a scalloped upper dashboard and a simple centre console. The main controls and displays are angled to the driver. The interior design lacks cup holders. The 156 Sportwagon features fold-down rear seats to increase the luggage area normally covered by a privacy screen. 2002 saw an update to both the interior and exterior of the 156. ==Facelifts== ===2002 facelift (first series)=== 2002 also saw the arrival of a facelifted interior with different matte-finish surfacing and chrome highlights. This new version featured the 147's dual-zone digital climate controller while the interior climate could also be controlled via an air quality sensor. A different choice of colours were available for the interior, with the option of a two-tone interior very much like that on offer from its European rivals. A wider range of options including xenon lighting, tele-informatics (CONNECT and CONNECT NAV) and a Bose stereo system were available, the stereo system could now also be operated via buttons on the steering wheel. Also, the Selespeed gearbox control system was updated, buttons on the steering wheel were replaced by paddle shifters, as seen on the earlier Alfa Romeo 147. In the center console, the designers added a multifunctional display with trip computer, fault, and service monitor. The upgrade also included electronic stability control VDC (Vehicle Dynamic Control) with an emergency brake assist device and slip control ASR (Anti Slip Regulation) came as standard. Additionally, an MSR (Motor Schleppmoment Regelung) was added to the car, this device prevents wheel skidding by restoring torque to the engine for example when the gear is shifted down abruptly under conditions of low grip. Passive safety was also made better, all versions got window airbags as standard. The 2.0 L JTS engine with gasoline direct injection replaced the 2.0 litre Twin Spark engine, offering more low end torque and more power than the Twin Spark. The diesel engines were also uprated. The only notable difference exterior-wise was body-coloured mirrors and bumper strips which were earlier black. ===2003 facelift (second series)=== Late 2003 saw the launch of a facelifted 156, with new front and rear fascias designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro. A new top of the line model was added to the line up called TI (Turismo Internazionale) designating a sporty kit, this version was equipped with modified suspension, bigger wheels (215/45 17\") and leather-trimmed interior. The GTA models never received the exterior update. Diesel engines underwent a major overhaul which included a new four- valve per cylinder heads and a second stage common rail injection with 1400 bar maximum injection pressure with up to five injections per cycle for lower noise, consumption, and higher performance. They were rated at 140/150 PS (103/110 kW) for straight-4 1.9 litre 16-valve and for straight-5 2.4 litre 20-valve. ==Variants== ===156 GTA=== The 156 GTA and 156 Sportwagon GTA were launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2001. The GTA was named after the Alfa Romeo GTA from the 1960s, the letters GTA meaning Gran Turismo Alleggerita (). Developed alongside the 147 GTA, it was an exclusive high- performance model hand assembled on a dedicated production line separate to the standard 156 models. 1,973 berlinas and 1,678 Sportwagons were built until the GTA production stopped in October 2005, as the V6 engine as unable to meet emissions regulations and due to the 156 being replaced by the 159. The GTA was sold in limited numbers, with right-hand drive vehicles holding a premium over left-hand drive vehicles due to their rarity. The very first GTA was sold via online auction, from 13 to 23 September, the duration of the Frankfurt Motor Show. Winning bid was \u20ac48,691.26, which was donated to \"Telethon\" charity fund. 156 GTA The 3.2-litre Bussone V6 engine (The big Busso, so- called after legendary Alfa Romeo engineer Giuseppe Busso). This engine is praised universally for its sound and revving capabilities.EVO Magazine August 2011 page 77 This was the largest iteration of the engine built by Alfa Romeo. The engine has a bore and a stroke, displacing at . It was rated at and of torque. Overall, the car weighed more than the standard V6 156. The GTA variants shared a common interior with post-facelift 156 variants. The doors, boot lid and bonnet were also shared. All else was unique to the GTA, with the engine specifically made by Fiat and Maserati Research Centres. The GTA did not receive the Giugiaro designed facelift introduced on the 156 in 2002, but continued with the acclaimed Walter de Silva design to the very end of production. The steering was also made faster, only 1.7 turns from lock to lock compared to 2.1 in normal models. The GTA had also larger brakes (Brembo), at front 305 millimetres (12 in) discs and rear 276 millimetres (10.8 in). The front discs were later upgraded to 330 millimetres (13 in) to cope with the performance potential. ===156 Sportwagon Q4=== In 2004 Sportwagon Q4, an all-wheel drive version of the Sportwagon was launched in some markets. The Q4 (short for Quadrifoglio 4) system used three differentials, the central one being of the Torsen C limited slip type; it added about to the vehicle weight. Graziano Trasmissioni, the Turin-based transmission specialist, developed this system. A raised ride height meant the Sportwagon Q4's was tall. Other than the ride height, special 5-spoke 17 inch wheels and a \"Q4\" badge on the tail set the Sportwagon Q4 apart from the front-wheel drive 156 versions. The Sportwagon Q4 was only available on LHD markets, with no RHD models being built or sold. The only available engine was 1.9 M-Jet diesel with . ===156 Crosswagon Q4=== 156 Crosswagon Q4 The Crosswagon Q4 was launched in 2004 with a crossover look and enhanced off-road capabilities. The Crosswagon's ride height was raised further compared to the Sportwagon Q4, giving the car better approach and departure angles; at it was taller than a standard 156. Tall-sidewall all-season tyres on 17 inch wheels were standard. The only available engine was 1.9 M-Jet diesel rated at . The Crosswagon was made to look more like an all-terrain vehicle by unique front and rear bumpers and door sills with steel inserts. After the introduction of the 159 in 2005 the Crosswagon remained in production, and in 2007 it was the last 156 model to be discontinued. ===Special versions=== ====Alfa Romeo 156 GTAm==== The Alfa Romeo 156 GTAm was shown at the Bologna Motor Show in December 2002. The car was built by Fiat Group's partner N.Technology. The GTA engine was bored to and power was increased to . The car had widened wheel arches, 19 inch tyres and was equipped with N.Technology limited slip differential. This car never reached production phase. ====Alfa Romeo 156 Sportwagon GTA 3.5 Autodelta==== At the 2004 Geneva Motor Show Italian-based tuning firm Autodelta unveiled a 156 Sportwagon prototype equipped with a V6 engine that developed at 6,800 rpm. The car was fitted with Bilstein adjustable shock absorbers, Eibach springs and Brembo front brakes with a diameter of . Weight was reduced using a composite engine bonnet. ====Autodelta 156 GTA 3.7 V6==== Supercharged Autodelta 156 GTA. London-based tuning firm Autodelta made two high performance versions based on 156 GTA, in GTA AM version Alfa Romeo V6 engine was bored to , which was capable of developing at 7,300 rpm. With this, the car could attain a top speed of and accelerate to 100 km/h in 5.2 s. The GTA AM Super was an upgrade of the first version, now fitted with Rotrex supercharger and rated at . ==Specifications== ===Platform and suspension=== The 156 uses a platform derived from the Alfa Romeo 155, which in turn was derived from the Fiat Group's \"Tipo\" platform. However it is sufficiently different from the original \"Tipo\" one to be seen as a new platform. The 156 is a highly developed front-wheel drive car; (the Cross/Sportwagon Q4 offered four-wheel drive in left-hand drive markets) with a double high wishbone front suspension and updated version of MacPherson type rear suspension, which consists of a telescopic vertical strut with coaxial spring and two transverse links of different lengths and a longitudinal strut. This structure means that the rear wheels have a tiny passive steering ability. Weight saving materials (mainly aluminium) have been used in several parts both front and rear suspension. For the 156 GTA, weight saving materials were also used in many other parts like magnesium framed front seats and dashboard frame. The 156 GTA only shared common parts with other 156 variants with respect to the facelift interior, doors, bonnet and boot lid. ===Engines=== The 156 offered various engines and power output choices during its lifespan, four and six cylinder petrol engines and four and five cylinder diesel engines, all produced at Pratola Serra except the V6 engines, which were produced at Alfa Romeo's Arese plant, with the GTA engines being produced at the Maserati Research Centre. The 2.4 JTD diesel was world's first common rail diesel engine in a passenger car. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !colspan=10 style=\"font-size:105%;\"| Engine specifications |- !
