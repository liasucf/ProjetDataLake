It is saidFormer Neufmoustier abbey. the abbey was founded in 1100AD by Peter the Hermit, on his return from the first crusade. The abbey was dissolved in 1795 during the French Revolution and sold off as a national asset in 1797. ==Ch\u00e2teau== The church and most of the conventual buildings were demolished but the purchaser of the abbess's residence, built in 1658, converted it into a mansion for his own use, from which time it was known as the Ch\u00e2teau de l'Abbaye de Soli\u00e8res. In 1935 it was purchased by the insurance co-operative of the Belgian Socialist Party, who used it as a home for mentally and physically handicapped boys, under the name L'Heureux Abri. It returned to private ownership in 1999, and is again known as the Ch\u00e2teau de l'Abbaye de Soli\u00e8res. The building is a protected Walloon monument but is conspicuously in a very poor state of repair. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Sacre, M.
