He won the 1952 singles and two rinks titles at the National Championships in Port Elizabeth, bowling for the Pretoria West Bowls Club. ==Football career== Known as 'Herb' he played right-half and was signed by Aberdeen F.C. from Arcadia Shepherds F.C. on 9 December 1936 but did not arrive in Scotland until 23 July 1937 after sailing from South Africa with other members of the Aberdeen team following their tour of South Africa. He lived at 13 Fonthill Road, Aberdeen. ==Personal life== In 1940 he returned to South Africa by which time he was listed as being an engineer by trade living, formerly of 189 Union Street. He then began bowling for the Pretoria West Bowls Club but it is probable that he was introduced to bowls during his time in Scotland. ==References== Category:South African male bowls players Category:1916 births Category:Commonwealth Games gold medallists for South Africa Category:Bowls players at the 1950 British Empire Games Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in lawn bowls Category:Aberdeen F.C. players Category:Association football defenders Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Possibly living people Category:South African soccer players ",
