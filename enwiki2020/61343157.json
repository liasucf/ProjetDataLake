He also worked as a designer and was a master stained glass artist. == Biography == His father, Victor, was a mason. At the age of fourteen, he left his family to live with an uncle in Paris. His initial artistic training came in the workshops of artists who have now been forgotten but, in 1827, he was able to work with Auguste Couder. His first exhibition came four years later, when he presented an equestrian portrait of Napoleon. After that, he worked as assistant to Jean Alaux, restoring various monumental paintings. This led to his participation in restorative work being done at the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles. From 1834 to 1837, he created several battle paintings for the at Versailles. Then, from 1838 to 1842, he received orders directly from the Royal Family. He also had numerous customers among the French bourgeoisie. During a trip to Burgundy in 1845, he developed an interest in the creation and restoration of stained glass windows. He trained himself by participating in projects at Notre-Dame- des-Blancs-Manteaux and Saint-Eustache, then undertook restorative work on his own at several churches, including Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont, Saint-Nicolas-du- Chardonnet, and Saint-Merri. In 1851, he had a showing at the Great Exhibition in London. That same year, he hired two assistants, Annette and Sophie Copp\u00e9e, sisters of the poet Fran\u00e7ois Copp\u00e9e. The following year he married Sophie. In addition to giving him three girls and a boy, she became an indispensable part of the window production process and may have created some entirely on her own. Eventually, between 1864 and 1866, they would work on windows at the Louvre. This was followed by windows at the parish church in his hometown. He continued to paint, exhibiting at the Exposition Universelle (1855), the Exposition Universelle (1867) and the Exposition Universelle (1878). After his death, his studio was closed. His son, Savinien, had died in 1854 and his daughters had not learned the trade from their mother. He and Sophie are buried together in Mont-Saint-Sulpice. ==Selected paintings== File:Prosper Lafaye 002.jpg|Princess Marie d'Orl\u00e9ans in her apartments at the Tuileries Palace File:Le Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans traversant la place du Ch\u00e2telet, le 31 juillet 1830 by Prosper Lafaye (Carnavalet P 2355).jpg|The Duc d'Orl\u00e9ans Crossing the Place du Ch\u00e2telet File:Roger I de Sicilia en la batalla de Cerami, por Prosper Lafaye.jpg|Roger I of Sicily at the Battle of Cerami File:Lafaye- Victoria.jpg|Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at the Indian Pavilion of the Great Exhibition == Further reading == *Note sur l'\u00e9tat actuel de l'art de la peinture sur verre, au sujet des r\u00e9parations \u00e0 faire aux vitraux peints de l'\u00e9glise Saint-Etienne du Mont, by Prosper Lafaye, 1849. *M\u00e9moire au sujet des vitraux anciens, \u00e9tat o\u00f9 ils se trouvent apr\u00e8s le si\u00e8ge dans les \u00e9glises de Paris, address to L\u00e9on Say, Prefect of the Seine, by Prosper Lafaye after the Paris Commune. *Exposition universelle de Londres.
