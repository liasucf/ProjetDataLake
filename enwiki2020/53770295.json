    "text": "Frederick L. Robinson (February 20, 1901, Memphis, Tennessee - April 11, 1984, New York City) was an American jazz trombonist. Robinson learned to play trombone as a teenager, and studied music in Ohio before moving to Chicago, where he played in Carroll Dickerson's orchestra. Robinson played on Louis Armstrong's Hot Five recordings and continued working with both Dickerson and Armstrong until late 1929, when he took a position in Edgar Hayes's band. In the 1930s he worked extensively as a sideman, with Marion Hardy, Don Redman, Benny Carter, Charlie Turner, Fletcher Henderson, and Fats Waller. In 1939-1940 he was in Andy Kirk's band, and played later in the 1940s with George James, Cab Calloway, and Sy Oliver. Early in the 1950s he worked with Noble Sissle, but after 1954 he was less active as a performer. ==References== *\"Fred Robinson\". The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. 2nd edition, ed. Barry Kernfeld.
