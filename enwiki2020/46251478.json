    "text": "Lewis Kinsella (born 2 September 1994) is an English professional footballer who plays as a left back for club Aldershot Town. Kinsella came up through Arsenal's youth academy, where he spent eight years, before moving to Aston Villa's academy in 2011. He made his professional debut on loan at Luton Town in 2015, making three appearances. Kinsella made 13 appearances on loan at Kidderminster Harriers in 2016, before being released in the summer of that year. He joined Colchester United in July 2016 and went on loan to Aldershot Town in January 2018. He made a permanent move to Aldershot at the end of January 2018. ==Career== ===Aston Villa=== Born in Watford, Hertfordshire, Kinsella spent eight years in the Arsenal's youth academy, representing the club from under-8 to under-16 levels, before being released and joined Aston Villa's academy in 2011. During his first season with the club, Kinsella played in all but one of the club's matches in the 2011\u201312 NextGen Series. Despite missing the group games of the competition during the 2012\u201313 NextGen Series, he later returned to help the club win the competition. Kinsella was called up to first-team training by manager Tim Sherwood in March 2015 following injuries to regular left backs Aly Cissokho and Kieran Richardson. He was named in the matchday squad for the first time on 7 March 2015 for Villa's FA Cup quarter-final tie against West Bromwich Albion, though he remained an unused substitute in a 2\u20130 victory. On 26 March 2015, Kinsella joined League Two club Luton Town on loan until the end of 2014\u201315. He made his professional debut two days later, playing the full 90 minutes of a 2\u20131 defeat away to Northampton Town. He completed the loan spell with three appearances. Following his return to parent club Aston Villa, Kinsella signed a new one-year contract in June 2015. On 18 February 2016, Kinsella joined National League club Kidderminster Harriers on a one-month loan. He debuted two days later, starting Kidderminster's 2\u20132 draw at home to Chester. Kinsella made six appearances before extending his loan with the club on 21 March until the end of 2015\u201316, finishing the loan spell with 13 appearances. After the end of the season, Kinsella announced Aston Villa had not offered him a new contract and left the club after five years. ===Colchester United=== During the summer of 2016, Kinsella received offers from two English Football League clubs, but both fell through. He then spent a week training with Swindon Town, and his former loan club Luton. After impressing in two trial matches against Crystal Palace and Ipswich Town for Colchester United, Kinsella signed a one- year contract with the League Two club on 29 July 2016. He debuted in Colchester's 1\u20131 draw away to Hartlepool United on the opening day of 2016\u201317. Kinsella made 14 appearances during the early months of the season, but sustained an injury in the latter, a 0\u20130 draw with Newport County on 8 October. He required surgery on his ankle that ruled him out of action for three months. Kinsella ended the season with just one further appearance following his injury, bringing his total to 15 for the season. He signed a new one-year contract with Colchester on 29 June 2017. ===Aldershot Town=== He joined National League club Aldershot Town on loan for one month on 4 January 2018. Kinsella made his Aldershot debut two days later in their 2\u20131 away win over Dover Athletic. On 31 January 2018, Kinsella signed for Aldershot permanently on a contract until the end of 2017\u201318, after leaving Colchester by mutual consent. He signed a new one-year contract with the club on 11 May 2018. In the summer of 2020, Kinsella made national news as he sought to crowdfund money to pay for an operation after a serious MCL injury. This prompted over \u00a310,000 in donations, including \u00a31,000 from the Aldershot board of directors and \u00a32,000 from former Aston Villa teammate Jack Grealish. ==Career statistics== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|FA Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=3|Aston Villa |2014\u201315 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0 |- |2015\u201316 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=2|\u2014!!0!!0 |- |Luton Town (loan) |2014\u201315 |League Two |3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||3||0 |- |Kidderminster Harriers (loan) |2015\u201316 |National League |13||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||13||0 |- |rowspan=3|Colchester United |2016\u201317 |League Two |13||0||0||0||0||0||2||0||15||0 |- |2017\u201318 |League Two |9||0||1||0||1||0||3||0||14||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !22!!0!!1!!0!!1!!0!!5!!0!!29!!0 |- |rowspan=4|Aldershot Town |2017\u201318 |National League |18||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0||19||0 |- |2018\u201319 |National League |33||0||3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0||37||0 |- |2019\u201320 |National League |29||0||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0||31||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !80!!0!!4!!0!!colspan=2|\u2014!!3!!0!!87!!0 |- !colspan=3|Career total !118!!0!!5!!0!!1!!0!!8!!0!!132!!0 |} ==Honours== Aston Villa *NextGen Series: 2012\u201313 ==References== ==External links== *Lewis Kinsella profile at the Aldershot Town F.C. website * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Watford Category:Footballers from Hertfordshire Category:English footballers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Kidderminster Harriers F.C. players Category:Colchester United F.C. players Category:Aldershot Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players ",
