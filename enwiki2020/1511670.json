    "text": "The Witch of Boto\u015fani or simply The Witch or The Sorceress (original Yiddish title Di Kishefmakhern) was an 1878, or possibly 1877, play by Abraham Goldfaden. Like most of Goldfaden's major works, it included music. The play was based on popular superstition; Goldfaden would later remark, \"I wrote Di kishefmakhern (The Witch) in Romania, where the populace - Jews as much as Romanians - believe strongly in witches.\" [Bercovici, 1998] The title role, a female character, was written to be played by a man; it was first played by Israel Grodner. The play survived into a far different era of Yiddish theater: Maurice Schwartz played it at New York City's Yiddish Art Theater in 1925. [Adler, 1999, 107 (commentary)] Jacob Adler made his 1878 stage debut in the role of the lover Marcus, in a production in Kherson, Ukraine, in which Israel Rosenberg played the title role. [Adler, 1999, 107] ==Restoration== In the Fall of 2017, the National Yiddish Theater \u2013 Folksbiene of New York staged a revival of The Witch of Boto\u0219ani (alternatively 'The Sorceress') as part of their restoration project \u2013 an endeavor that will restore lost or nearly lost Yiddish works to the canon of Yiddish culture. A table showing the dates and progress of that restoration effort is shown below. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Restoration Production Dates !Production !Produced by !Director !Music Director !Event !Date |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Workshop Performance | rowspan=\"2\" |Folksbiene | rowspan=\"2\" |Motl Didner | rowspan=\"2\" |Zalman Mlotek |First Performane |December 25, 2017 |- |Final Performance |January 1, 2018 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Full Production | rowspan=\"3\" |Folksbiene | rowspan=\"3\" |Motl Didner | rowspan=\"3\" |Zalman Mlotek |Previews |December 1, 2019 |- |Opening Night |December 9, 2019 |- |Closing Night |December 29, 2019 |} === Workshop Performance === The first performance as part of the Folksbiene's restoration project ran for a sold out week from December 25, 2017 to January 1, 2018.
