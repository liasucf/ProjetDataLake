    "text": "Julius Bl\u00fcthner Pianofortefabrik GmbH, is a piano-manufacturing company in Leipzig, Germany.\"Bl\u00fcthner\", Grove Music Online, 2009. Accessed 14 April 2009. Along with C. Bechstein, B\u00f6sendorfer and Steinway & Sons, Bl\u00fcthner is frequently referred to as one of the \"Big Four\" piano manufacturers. Bl\u00fcthner == History == The founder Julius Bl\u00fcthner Julius Bl\u00fcthner established his workshop in Leipzig, Saxony in 1853. This accomplishment was only achieved after a long and difficult campaign to gain Leipzig citizenship. Julius started his endeavor with himself and three other craftsman. A deeply religious man, Julius spoke the defining words that would allow his company to survive and flourish for the next 162 years, \"May God Prevail\". The age of any particular Bl\u00fcthner piano can be determined by matching its serial number to the age table freely available on the Bl\u00fcthner website. By 1900 Bl\u00fcthner had become the largest piano maker in Germany, producing some 5,000 instruments annually. Innovations such as the Aliquot string, a fourth string that vibrated sympathetically and that is tuned in unison as well as the cylindrical soundboard and angle cut hammers, created a unique voice for the Bl\u00fcthner instrument. The owners Adolf Max Bl\u00fcthner, Dr. Paul Robert and Willy Bruno Heinrich were awarded an imperial and royal warrant of appointment to the court of Austria-Hungary. == Models == Bl\u00fcthner grand piano Today Bl\u00fcthner grand pianos come in six different sizes. The company also makes several sizes of upright pianos. Custom-ordered pianos can be produced with almost any style cabinet and veneers. It also makes several models of Haessler pianos and two lines of Irmler pianos in its German factory. Model 1: Concert Grand - 9'2\" (280 cm) Model 2: Small Concert Grand - 7'8\" (238 cm) Model 4: 6'10\" (210 cm) Model 6: 6'3\" (191 cm) Model 10: 5'5\" (166 cm) Model 11: 5'1\" (154 cm) === Designer models === The one-of-a-kind Bl\u00fcthner piano of particular interest was a special lightweight instrument, made for use on the Zeppelin LZ 129 Hindenburg. The piano had its harp plate made of aluminum, that saved about 100 kg of weight versus a regular cast iron plate of the same size piano. This was the first piano used in flight, and it was used in an \"air-concert\" radio broadcast.\"History\" , Bl\u00fcthner UK Website, 2005. Accessed 14 April 2009. It was removed in 1937 to save weight so it survived the Hindenburg's infamous crash, only to be destroyed by bombing during WWII. A replica of this piano was featured in the 1975 film The Hindenburg where Reed Channing (Peter Donat) sings. Since the film is set during the airship's final flight, during which the piano was not on the ship, the piano's presence is a historical error. Bl\u00fcthner makes a few specialized pianos including some with the design reversed so that a left-handed person can play the tenor with his left hand and the bass with his right hand. In 2008 they designed and built a special keyboard for a customer in Spain which had the Jank\u00f3 keyboard design. == Notable Bl\u00fcthner artists == Sergei Rachmaninoff with a Bl\u00fcthner piano. Photo ca. 1905 Numerous royals, composers, conductors, artists, authors and performers have owned Bl\u00fcthner pianos. They include Willhelm II, Emperor Franz Joseph I, Johannes Brahms, Gustav Mahler, Liberace, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Claude Debussy, George Formby, Dodie Smith, Max Reger, Richard Wagner, Johann Strauss, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, Petronel Malan. \"Personalities\" , Bl\u00fcthner UK Website, 2005. Accessed 14 April 2009. Sergei Rachmaninoff commented that \"There are only two things which I took with me on my way to America...my wife and my precious Bl\u00fcthner\". Bl\u00fcthners have been used in popular music, as well. One Bl\u00fcthner piano owned by the Abbey Road Studios in London was used on some tracks of The Beatles' Let It Be (1970) album, most notably, in the hits \"Let It Be\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\". Bl\u00fcthners were also used in the films Gaslight (1944) and The Sting (1973),In an interview included on the 2012 Universal Pictures Home Entertainment DVD release of The Sting (1973), Marvin Hamlisch states: \"... I didn't want to use a 'honky-tonk' piano at all. But I wanted to use a very sweet-sounding piano and I used a Bl\u00fcthner. So I didn't go for the dynamics, let's say, of a Bosendorfer or a Steinway. I went for a more quiet sound.\" and one was played by Hannibal Lecter in the movie Hannibal. Another, a stunt piano, was destroyed in Iron Man (2008). A Bl\u00fcthner piano also appears in the 2004 Cole Porter biopic De-Lovely in the Venice apartment scenes. == References == == External links == * Category:Companies based in Leipzig Category:Piano manufacturing companies of Germany Category:Purveyors to the Imperial and Royal Court Category:Saxon Royal Warrant holders Category:1853 establishments in Saxony Category:German companies established in 1853 Category:German brands Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1853 ",
