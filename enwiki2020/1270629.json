The small lunar mare Lacus Hiemalis lies along the southwest rim of Daubr\u00e9e. The crater was named after French geologist Gabriel A. Daubr\u00e9e. It was previously designated Menelaus S. This is a horseshoe-shaped formation with the rim open to the northwest. The interior has been flooded by basaltic lava, leaving a level, featureless floor. The rim has a low cut through the southern end, and the eastern rim is attached to low ridges belonging to the Montes Haemus. ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== *Daubr\u00e9e at The Moon Wiki * LTO-60A1 Daubr\u00e9e -- L&PI; topographic map. * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
