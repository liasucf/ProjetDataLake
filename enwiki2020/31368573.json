A tsunami was observed. There were 15 people reported injured. The intensity reached shindo 5 in Miyazaki and K\u014dchi. ==Description== This was an interplate earthquake between the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. In this region, the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting beneath the Eurasian Plate. The subduction interface around this region include the Nankai Trough and the Ryukyu Trench. This earthquake is the strongest event recorded in the Hy\u016bga-nada Sea region. The maximum slip was estimated to be 4 m. It was estimated that, in the Hy\u016bga-nada Sea region, earthquakes with magnitudes about 7.6 occur with a period of about 200 years, while earthquakes with magnitudes about 7.1 occur with a period of about 20 to 27 years. It has been pointed out that there is a tendency of occurrence of inland earthquakes in Kyushu before and after large interplate earthquakes in the Hy\u016bga-nada Sea region. ==See also== *List of earthquakes in 1968 *List of earthquakes in Japan ==References== ==External links== * Hyuga-nada Category:Earthquakes in Japan Hyuga-nada Category:1968 tsunamis ",
