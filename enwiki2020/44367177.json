Captivated by VICE magazine as a teenager, she told scribd.com in 2013, \"I'd even travel all the way to London to get a copy of the magazine. I'd take it home, hide it from my mum...\" == VICE career == Duboc started at VICE in London as an editorial intern. Her first break came when tasked with finding fashion-related stories. She discovered that the first ever fashion week in Islamabad, Pakistan, was scheduled to go ahead in the following weeks. After pitching the idea of using \"other\" fashion weeks as a hook to explore stories of identity and culture around the world, she was given the go ahead and made the presenter of the new show, which was given the deliberately facetious title 'Fashion Week Internationale'. ==References== Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:Vice Media Category:English female models Category:People from Surrey Category:English women journalists ",
