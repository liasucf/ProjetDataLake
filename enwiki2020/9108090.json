The diocese was first created in 1802, covering the area west of the Rhine formerly belonging to Cologne, as well as parts from the dioceses Li\u00e8ge, Utrecht, Roermond and Mainz. After the first bishop Marc Antoine Berdolet died in 1809, Pope Pius VII refused to commission the successor suggested by Napoleon, Jean Denis Fran\u00e7ois Camus. After the French rulership over the area, the diocese was abolished by the bull De salute animarum of July 16, 1821, and incorporated into the archdiocese of Cologne. On August 13, 1930 the diocese was re-established by the papal bull Pastorale officii nostri. Joseph Vogt was appointed as its first bishop. ==Major Churches== Aachen Cathedral The principal church of the diocese is the Aachen Cathedral, of which the central part, the Palatine Chapel, was built in 800 under Charlemagne. It was also the first German World Heritage Site, inscribed in 1978. The diocese has two churches that have been given the status of basilica minor\u02d0 *Steinfeld Basilica, Kall-Steinfeld \u2013 7 October 1960 *Minster St. Vitus, M\u00f6nchengladbach \u2013 25 April 1973 ==See also== *List of Roman Catholic dioceses in Germany ==External links== *Website of the Diocese *GCatholic.org *Website of the diocese Category:Roman Catholic bishops by diocese Category:Roman Catholic dioceses in Germany Category:Religious organizations established in 1802 Category:Religious organizations disestablished in 1821 Category:Christian organizations established in 1930 Category:1930 establishments in Germany Category:1802 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire ",
