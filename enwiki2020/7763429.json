    "text": "The badge of office of Albion Herald of Arms Extraordinary Albion Herald of Arms Extraordinary is the title of one of the officers of arms at the Canadian Heraldic Authority in Ottawa. Herald Extraordinary is an honorary position reserved for people who have made notable contributions to Canadian heraldry. Like the other heralds at the Authority, the name is derived from a Canadian River. Initially, there was some indication that the office would be given the title \"Red Hill,\" but when informed that the Red Hill River is today in essence a sewer, the CHA decided to name the position \"Albion,\" the river's name in a less polluted era. The badge is in the loyal colours of red, white and blue, and reflects the geology of the Niagara Escarpment, over which the Red Hill River flows, creating a beautiful waterfall (\"Albion Falls\") that is supposedly haunted. The office was created on 27 October 2006.Press Release from the Office of the Governor General of Canada ==Holders of the office== *2006-present: Ralph Spence ==See also== *Herald *Royal Heraldry Society of Canada ==References== ==External links== *Canadian Heraldic Authority * Royal Heraldry Society of Canada Category:Offices of arms Category:Canadian Heraldic Authority ",
