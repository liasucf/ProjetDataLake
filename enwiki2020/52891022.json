The wings have bluish to yellowish-greenish blue ground colour, which is more yellowish in summer generations, but always with a dense scale cover. The eyes of the forewings are narrow, with a single armilla, which on the hindwings sometimes has a black or dark grey frame. This frame is absent in the spring generation. The wings have grey transversal postmedial fasciae between the eye and outer margin. The fascia is rather distinct and sometimes slightly undulate, especially in the hindwing., 2011: The Actias Leach, 1815, in the Far East: how many species? Neue Entomologische Nachrichten 67: 40-56.
