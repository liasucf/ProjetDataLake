Though she originally had wanted to participate in basketball and gymnastics, she began cycling when her father told her it would be good training for backetball, and then he and her brother \"used to drop [her] on the hills and [rush her].\" She disliked cycling until her father signed both siblings up for track racing classes, where she would race against boys as there were no other girls. When racing during her childhood at the Marymoor Velodrome, she and her brother would nearly get kicked out of races for arguing beforehand. She was also still often the only girl competing. In 1988, she moved from Washington to the East coast and the Lehigh County Velodrome where there were more women to train against. During the racing seasons, Duprel would train in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania. Duprel dated fellow track cyclist and sprinter Ken Carpenter. After retiring from professional racing, Duprel began to coach children and adults in cycling. == References == Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:American track cyclists Category:Pan American Games medalists in cycling Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for the United States Category:Cyclists at the 1987 Pan American Games ",
