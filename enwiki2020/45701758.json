Springtown, and the nearby community of Othello, were both founded shortly after the American Revolution by African Americans. ==History== Legislation enacted in 1786 enabled Quakers living in Greenwich Township to sell tracts of land to \"free negros\". Many African Americans soon located to Springtown, and the community became a center of abolitionist activity. Harriet Tubman frequented Springtown from 1849 to 1853, and the settlement was an important station on the Underground Railroad, with five of Cumberland County's seven \"station masters\" living there. The Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Springtown offered lodging to fugitive slaves traveling north after leaving Delaware and Maryland's Eastern Shore. ==References== Category:Greenwich Township, Cumberland County, New Jersey Category:African- American history of New Jersey Category:Populated places on the Underground Railroad Category:Unincorporated communities in Cumberland County, New Jersey Category:Unincorporated communities in New Jersey ",
