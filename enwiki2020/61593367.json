    "text": "Franko 2 is the yet-to-be-released sequel to 1994's Franko: The Crazy Revenge, trapped in development hell for many years. Franko 2 was originally worked on from 1995 to 1996, then the development team broke up. In 2002/2003, there was an attempt to create Franko 2: No Mercy on GBA - the project was abandoned once Nintendo rejected the violent elements of the video game. Later in June 2013, Franko 2: Revenge is Back was announced. In January 2014 the game's developers - Tomasz Tomaszek and Mariusz Pawluk from World Software, had a crowdfunding campaign on Wspieram.to to create a sequel to Franko. It was announced that IMGN.pro would be the game's publisher, who said they were excited to continue the legacy of a cult classic and to crate a title that could compete on the world stage. The team reached their goal of PLN 34.5 thousand, a record-breaking amount for Polish crowdfunding. The developers said that at the time they began the crowdfund, mechanics of the game were already 70% built, while other elements (maps, graphics, cutscenes, dialogues) were 20 - 30% completed. In late 2014 it was announced that the game's main programmer had left the project, which had led to a mad scramble to find a development team who could complete the game. Graczpospolita reported that by 2015, communication between developers and the fans had \"completely gone down\". Gry Online declared that it was considered by many to be a \"dead game\". In terms of gameplay, they announced a decision regarding the use of firearms in the title: In 2016, the development team wrote a message to their fans, \" We work, we work. [...] in the meantime, be patient as you have not done so...\", before explaining the challenges they've faces in the process. They further added that the core development is done by one person with a few other part-timers and freelancers. In 2017 it was announced that after 5 years of development of the game, they'd like to release the first part for the 25th anniversary of the original - in 2019. Mariusz Pawluk, graphic artist and co- creator of Franko, said the game \"has been scrapped, because despite the passage of several years the developers could not provide the quality that the original creators and fans would be satisfied with. Bah, as I found out, there wasn't even a developed combat system despite several years of work\". In 2018, the game was passed onto to Gda\u0144sk studio Blue Sunset Games. == References == Category:Upcoming video games ",
