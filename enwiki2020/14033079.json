The project is financed by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) and carried out by the Center for Development Research, ZEF Bonn in Germany and with the Institute of Biodiversity Conservation and the Ethiopian Coffee Forest Forum in Ethiopia. ==Background== The montane rain forests in southeast Ethiopia, the birthplace of wild Coffea arabica, were the origin of a large part of modern commercially used Coffea breeds. Due to the dwindling size of the montane rain forests as a result of clearing, the precious resource of wild Arabica coffee, and the genetic diversity it contains, is increasingly threatened. Approximately 40% of Ethiopia's land area was covered by dense forests at the end of the 1960s. This has now fallen to 2.7 percent. The former Kingdom of Kaffa in the southwest of the country is now a part of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region, one of the nine ethnic divisions of Ethiopia. The rapidly developing town of Bonga is the economic center of the Kaffa region. In the Kaffa region there are only 200,000 acres of undisturbed African montane rain forest remaining. However, these are extremely threatened in their existence, because of pressure on this forest region\u2014due to the growing population, infrastructure projects such as road construction and investors plans\u2014which has been increasing steadily. == List of key partner organizations == * Bundesamt f\u00fcr Naturschutz (BfN), Bonn, Germany * Bureau for Environmental and Ecological-economic Assessment (BETA), Wageningen, Netherlands * Centre de Coop\u00e9ration Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le D\u00e9veloppement (CIRAD), Montpellier, France * Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o das Ferrugens do Cafeeiro (CIFC), Oeiras, Portugal * Department of Biology Education, University of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia * Department of Biology, University Addis Abeba, Ethiopia * Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit mbh (GTZ), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia / Eschborn, Germany * EcoSecurities, Environmental Finance Solutions, Oxford, United Kingdom * Ethiopian Coffee Forest Forum (ECFF), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia * Ethiopian Economic Association (EEA), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia * Ethiopian Institute for Agricultural Research (EIAR), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia * Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia * EU Coffee Improvement Program (CIP IV) * Evolve \u2013 Consulting for Sustainable Development, Kirchzarten, Germany * GEO sch\u00fctzt den Regenwald e.
