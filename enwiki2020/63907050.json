Ray Albert Francis Swart (28 February 1928 - 14 January 2020) was a white liberal South African politician who spent his life in opposition to the apartheid policies of the government . He was educated in Durban at Glenwood High School and the University of Natal, where he graduated as a lawyer. At a very early age he became interested in politics and was initially a supporter of the United Party, for which in 1953 he was elected, at the age of 25, Member of Parliament for Zululand.https://medium.com/@johngiclarke/reflections-on-a-liberal-life-well- lived-8d6176f48f8d In 1959 Swart and eleven other United Party MPs left the party and founded the more liberal Progressive Party. Their policies were not well received by the conservative white electorate at the time and Swart, along with all the other Progressive MPs except Helen Suzman, lost his seat in the 1961 election. The party did not win any more seats until 1974, and Swart did not return to parliament again until the 1977 election, when he was elected MP for Musgrave in Durban. He remained in Parliament until 1994, through the negotiations to end apartheid and establish majority rule. After the founding of the Progressive Federal Party, he became the party chairman.
