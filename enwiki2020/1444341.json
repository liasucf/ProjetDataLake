    "text": "Richard P. \"Bingo\" Little is a recurring fictional character in the comedic Jeeves and Drones Club stories of English writer P. G. Wodehouse, being a friend of Jeeves's master Bertie Wooster and a member of the Drones Club. In his early appearances, Bingo, who has an impulsive and romantic nature, falls in love with numerous women in quick succession, generally pursuing an absurd scheme to woo his latest love interest and invariably causing problems for his pal Bertie. Eventually, Bingo marries Rosie M. Banks, and their married life is a happy one for the most part, though his proclivity for gambling sometimes gets him into trouble. ==Life and character== Richard P. \"Bingo\" Little is a longtime friend of Bertie Wooster. They were born in the same village a few days apart, and went together to kindergarten, preparatory school at Malvern House, secondary school at Eton College, and then to the University of Oxford, where Bingo obtained a degree of some sort.Cawthorne (2013), p. 211. He often reminds Bertie that they were at school together when he wants Bertie's help. Described as long and thin, Bingo is the only person other than Jeeves whom Bertie says has \"finely-chiselled features\".Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 5, p. 62. Bingo's loathing for country life is well known, and he generally avoids going to country houses when possible.Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 5, p. 56. He bets often on horse racing and is knowledgeable about novels based on the subject, including Pipped on the Post and Jenny, the Girl Jockey.Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 14, pp. 169, 171. He plays tennis, and in one story plays doubles with Bertie in a local tennis tournament.Wodehouse (2008) [1930], Very Good, Jeeves, chapter 1, pp. 27\u201328. Initially, Bingo is largely dependent on an allowance from his uncle Lord Bittlesham, though Bingo sometimes supplements his income with tutoring jobs. He eventually marries the novelist Rosie M. Banks, and through her connections, becomes the editor of Wee Tots, a publication for families and children. Bingo and Rosie live in St. John's Wood, and later just off Wimbledon Common.Garrison (1991), p. 107. Bingo inherits a substantial income and a country house from an Uncle Wilberforce, though Bingo still finds himself short of funds later on, so it is possible that Bingo spent his inheritance in some way, that Rosie controls the money Bingo inherited, or the inheritance might have not been as valuable as was first thought.Ring & Jaggard (1999), pp. 148\u2013152. According to Bertie, Bingo is known for his romantic nature, which began at school where he had the greatest collection of actresses' photographs, and which was a byword at Oxford. As Bertie notes in the story in which Bingo first appears, \"Jeeves in the Springtime\", Bingo is especially prone to fall in love in the spring, which acts on him like magic.Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 12. Bingo falls in love on a regular basis throughout The Inimitable Jeeves, and each time, he enthusiastically tells Bertie about whoever he has fallen in love with; Bertie notes that Bingo always reminds him of \"the hero of a musical comedy who takes the centre of the stage, gathers the boys round him in a circle, and tells them all about his love at the top of his voice\".Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 5, p. 57. The women he falls in love with form a diverse group, and include the waitress Mabel, who gives Bingo a crimson tie decorated with horseshoes (\"Jeeves in the Springtime\"); Honoria Glossop, the formidable daughter of Sir Roderick Glossop (\"Scoring off Jeeves\"); Daphne Braythwayt, a friend of Honoria (\"Scoring off Jeeves\"); Charlotte Corday Rowbotham, a revolutionary (\"Comrade Bingo\"); Lady Cynthia Wickhammersley, a family friend of Bertie's (\"The Great Sermon Handicap\"); and Mary Burgess, niece of the Rev. Francis Heppenstall (\"The Metropolitan Touch\"). Bingo is usually rejected within a short amount of time, and generally the girl gets engaged to someone else. In the last short story in The Inimitable Jeeves, \"Bingo and the Little Woman\", Bingo falls in love again when he sees Rosie M. Banks at the Senior Liberal Club, where Rosie is working as a waitress to gather material for her next book. To Bertie's surprise, Bingo and Rosie get married. In \"Clustering Round Young Bingo\" (in Carry On, Jeeves), Bingo must reluctantly give up his gifted chef, Anatole. It is clear in this story that Bertie and Bingo are still friends after Bingo's marriage, and that Bertie has also become Rosie's friend. Bertie considers himself an old friend of the family, and mentions that there is usually a photograph of himself on a table in the Littles' drawing room, next to photographs of Bingo, Rosie and Lord Bittlesham.Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 9 pp. 244\u2013246. Although the Littles' family life is happy for the most part, Rosie does not approve of Bingo's gambling habits and restricts him to an allowance. Occasionally, Bingo gets into trouble after losing money on wagers and tries to somehow make the money back while trying to keep Rosie from finding out. This happens in \"Jeeves and the Impending Doom\", in which Bingo loses money on a horse race and must get a job as a tutor for Thomas \"Thos\" Gregson, the troublesome son of Bertie's Aunt Agatha. This story appears in the collection Very Good, Jeeves. In another story in the same collection,\"Jeeves and the Old School Chum\", Bingo's well-being is threatened by Rosie's old school friend, Laura Pyke, who tries to dictate what Bingo should eat. Bingo attends Gussie Fink-Nottle's engagement dinner in the novel The Code of the Woosters. In The Mating Season, Bertie tells Corky Pirbright about Bingo becoming an editor of Wee Tots, \"a journal for the nursery and the home\", and says that Bingo and Rosie have had a baby.Wodehouse (2008) [1949], The Mating Season, chapter 12, p. 129. Rosie and Bingo have their baby, named Algernon Aubrey Little, in the second year of their marriage. Also in The Mating Season, Bertie says that Bingo generally changes the subject nervously when the subject of his wife's writing is brought up.Wodehouse (2008) [1949], The Mating Season, chapter 17, p. 170. However, in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, Bertie mentions that Rosie frequently sends Bingo to places to take notes for her, to help with atmosphere in her writing.Wodehouse (2008) [1954], Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, chapter 4, p. 40. ==Appearances== Bingo is featured in the following short stories: * in The Inimitable Jeeves (1923) ** \"Jeeves in the Springtime\" (1921) \u2013 Jeeves ** \"Scoring off Jeeves\" (1922) \u2013 Jeeves ** \"Comrade Bingo\" (1922) \u2013 Jeeves **\"The Great Sermon Handicap\" (1922) \u2013 Jeeves ** \"The Purity of the Turf\" (1922) \u2013 Jeeves ** \"The Metropolitan Touch\" (1922) \u2013 Jeeves ** \"Bingo and the Little Woman\" (1922) \u2013 Jeeves * in Carry On, Jeeves (1925) ** \"Clustering Round Young Bingo\" \u2013 Jeeves * in Very Good, Jeeves (1930) ** \"Jeeves and the Impending Doom\" (1926) \u2013 Jeeves ** \"Jeeves and the Old School Chum\" (1930) \u2013 Jeeves * in Eggs, Beans and Crumpets (1940) ** \"All's Well with Bingo\" (1937) \u2013 Drones ** \"Bingo and the Peke Crisis\" (1937) \u2013 Drones ** \"The Editor Regrets\" (1939) \u2013 Drones ** \"Sonny Boy\" (1939) \u2013 Drones * in A Few Quick Ones (1959) ** \"The Word in Season\" (1940) \u2013 Drones ** \"Leave it to Algy\" (1954, rewrite of \"The Ordeal of Bingo Little\") \u2013 Drones * in Nothing Serious (1950) ** \"The Shadow Passes\" (1950) \u2013 Drones ** \"Bramley Is So Bracing\" (1939) \u2013 Drones, stars Freddie Widgeon *in Plum Pie (1966) ** \"Bingo Bans the Bomb\" (1965) \u2013 Drones ** \"Stylish Stouts\" (1965, also recycled as \"The Great Fat Uncle Contest\") \u2013 Drones Bingo is mentioned in several stories, including: * The Code of the Woosters (1938) \u2013 Jeeves * Uncle Fred in the Springtime (1939) \u2013 Blandings Chapter 3, p. 42. * Joy in the Morning (1946) \u2013 Jeeves * The Mating Season (1949) \u2013 Jeeves * Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit (1954) \u2013 Jeeves * Pearls, Girls and Monty Bodkin (1972) \u2013 Drone Monty Bodkin Chapter 9, p. 116. ==Adaptations== ; Television * Derek Nimmo portrayed Bingo in the 1965\u20131967 BBC One television series The World of Wooster.Taves (2006), p. 176 * John Alderton portrayed Bingo in the 1975\u20131978 television series Wodehouse Playhouse, season 3, episode 5, \"The Editor Regrets\" (1978).Taves (2006), pp. 186\u2013187. * In the 1990\u20131993 television series Jeeves and Wooster, Bingo was portrayed by Michael Siberry in series 1 and 2, and by Pip Torrens in series 3 and 4.Taves (2006), pp. 189\u2013198. ;Stage * Bingo was portrayed by David Wood in the 1975 musical Jeeves. * In the London premiere of By Jeeves, the 1996 rewrite of the previous musical, Bingo was played by Nicholas Haverson. * Though Bingo does not appear in the 2013 play Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense, in which Bertie Wooster recounts the events of The Code of the Woosters, Bingo is the reason Bertie puts on the play.
