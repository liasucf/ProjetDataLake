Romero Bosque served as the Vice President of Alfonso Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez Molina from March 1923 to March 1927. He is reputed to be one of the few if not the only Salvadoran president who was able to strike a political balance in government during his administration. This balance is often known as the \"natural mix\" - a balance between concession to demands of the various components of society and repression of the same in a given country. He was a scion of the Mel\u00e9ndez-Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez \"dynasty\", who rather than impose his own heir as President, allowed a democratisation of the country with its first free elections in 1931, won by Arturo Araujo. ==References== Category:1860 births Category:1935 deaths Category:People from Cuscatl\u00e1n Department Category:Salvadoran people of Spanish descent Category:Presidents of El Salvador Category:Vice Presidents of El Salvador Category:Defence ministers of El Salvador ",
