The school moved to its present building in Brampton in 2005, with 1,300 students in grades 9, 10, and 11, and a grade 12 class from 2006. == Academics == In August 2009, the school principal Kevin McGuire removed the book To Kill a Mockingbird from the grade 10 curriculum due to a complaint received from a parent who expressed concern about the language in the book. It was returned to the grade 10 curriculum in 2011. St. Edmund Campion offers an Advanced Placement (AP) Program. The AP program provides an enriched classroom setting for highly motivated students in the areas of English, Math, and French. History and Science will be added in grade 10.
