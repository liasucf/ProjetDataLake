    "text": "Ipini is a tribe of bark beetles. It is a monophyletic group.Jordal, B., et al. (2008). Secondary structure alignment and direct optimization of 28S rDNA sequences provide limited phylogenetic resolution in bark and ambrosia beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae). Zoologica Scripta 37(1), 43-56. Beetles of this tribe specialize on conifers.Sequeira, A. S., et al. (2000). Evolutionary assembly of the conifer fauna: distinguishing ancient from recent associations in bark beetles. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B: Biological Sciences 267(1460), 2359-66. Many species, such as the six-spined engraver beetle (Ips sexdentatus) and the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus), produce galleries in wood for their eggs and larvae. Almost all beetles in this tribe have polygynous mating systems with harems of females. An exception is the monogamous Ips latidens.Reid, M. (1999). Monogamy in the bark beetle Ips latidens: ecological correlates of an unusual mating system. Ecological Entomology 24(1), 89-94. Genera include: *Acanthotomicus *Ips *Orthotomicus *Pityogenes *Pityokteines *Pseudips == References == == External links == * Ipini. Fauna Europaea. 2013. Category:Scolytinae ",
