The population of the civil parish including Hollingwood taken at the 2011 census was 8,788. The town of Staveley is to the east, and Hollingwood is nearby. The parish includes Brimington Common along the Calow Road, and New Brimington, a late 19th-century extension towards the Staveley Iron Works. ==History== The route of Icknield Street, a Roman road, passes close to the village. Brimington appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Brimintune. At that time, the manor was the property of King William I and the population was recorded as being sixteen villagers, two smallholders and one slave. Although there was a church in the village in the medieval period, it was a chapel of ease with the parish church being Chesterfield.Hall p. 341 In the autumn of 1603, there was an outbreak of bubonic plague in Brimington; the victims were buried in the village but were recorded in the parish register at Chesterfield.Hall pp. 341-342 The Chesterfield Canal, which was built just to the north of the village, opened in 1777. In 1796, the old church of St Michael and All Angels was demolished and replaced with a new building, of which only the tower survives. The present church was rebuilt in 1847 and contains a war memorial by Charles Sargeant Jagger; it is a Grade II listed building. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in 1806. In 1831, the population of Brimington was 759 people living in 142 houses.Hall p. 342 In 1881, Alfred Gough was hanged in Derby for the murder of six year-old Eleanor Wendle of Brimington, who was picking blackberries in the local fields. The manor house, Brimington Hall, was built in the 16th and 17th centuries and was the home of the Foljambe, Heywood, Coke and Markham families; it was demolished in 1924 but a fragment of its parkland survives as a green space on either side of Hall Road, just south of the church. ==Local government== Brimington was originally a chapelry within the ancient parish of Chesterfield, but was created a separate parish in September 1844. The Local Government Act 1894 established it as a civil parish with a parish council distinct from the church. It forms two wards, of Chesterfield Borough Council; Brimington North and Brimington South. The parish council maintains a community centre in Heywood Street which is used by a number of local organisations. ==Education== Brimington has two infant schools, Henry Bradley Infant School and Brimington Manor. Pupils generally feed into Brimington Junior School. Local secondary schools include Springwell Community College and Netherthorpe School. ==Local amenities== Brimington has a small library, various businesses including a chemist, car garages and showrooms, shops and a petrol station. There is an old pub called the Ark Tavern, next to what is now a care home. The building housing the care home used to be called Sutton Lodge (formerly Sutton Villa) and dates from about 1780\u201390. Other pubs in the centre of Brimington are Brimming with Beer, The Red Lion, The Three Horseshoes, The Butchers Arms and the most recently built, The Corner House, which has now been demolished and is part of the caravan store. Towards the lower end of Brimington, overlooking the Chesterfield Canal, is The Mill and along Brimington Common are The Miner's Arms and The Brickmakers Arms (which has since closed and has been converted into a residential property).
