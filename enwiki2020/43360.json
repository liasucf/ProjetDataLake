    "text": "This is a list of business schools in Europe. This list should not include schools that teach business alongside other subjects; i.e. a university that has a business curriculum should not be listed here as a business school. Those schools that have articles (i.e. are notable) are accepted for inclusion without a supporting citation; those schools that do not have articles (i.e. red-links) must have associated citations which reliable support the existence and focus of the school. ==Armenia== * Business School of Russian-Armenian Slavonic University (RAU), Yerevan ==Austria== * Apsley Business School - London, Austrian Campus, Vienna * Lauder Business School, Vienna * MCI Management Center Innsbruck, Innsbruck * Wirtschaftsuniversit\u00e4t Wien (WU Wien), Vienna ==Belgium== * Antwerp Management School * HEC Management School - University of Liege * ICHEC Brussels Management School * Louvain School of Management * Solvay Business School * United Business Institutes * Vlerick Business School ==Bosnia and Herzegovina== * Sarajevo Graduate School of Business * School of Economics and Business Sarajevo ==Bulgaria== * D.
