    "text": "Quasillites is a fossil genus of ostracod from the Devonian and Carboniferous Periods.J. J. Sepkoski Jr. 1998. Rates of speciation in the fossil record. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society Biological Sciences 353(1366):315-326Moore, R., Lalicker, C., Fischer, A. 1952. Invertebrate Fossils. ==Description== Quasillites is distinguished from other ostracodes by the presence of a \"medial spot\" on each valve. The surface of each valve is covered in longitudinal, bifurcating ridges, which curve and resemble a finger print.Feldman, R. (ed.) 1996. Fossils of Ohio. Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological Survey, Bulletin 70. pg. 115-121 The ribs and spines on the carapace are in front of the posterior margin, and are similar to those of other ostracods such as Bufina, Parabufina, and Healdia.Moore, R. ed. Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. Volume Q. pp.88-94 In fact, this comparison can also be drawn for all Quasillitids to other Healdiids. The muscle scars on each valve is circular in shape, and some specimens have smaller secondary scars. ==Distribution== Devonian examples of Quasillites, such as Q. lobatus, Q. obliquus, Q. subobliquus, and Q. angulatus, are known from shales and claystones in northern New York, Eastern Ohio, central Pennsylvania.

Other species such as Q. fromelennensis and a second informal species can also be found in Limestones of northern France, near the city of Calais.P. Morzadec and D. Brice. 2000. The Devonian of France: a tentative tie with the GSSP of the Devonian stages. 225:115-129 This genus has also been found in the Lower Carboniferous edge of the Illinois Basin; in central Indiana. ==References== Category:Podocopida genera Category:Quasillitidae Category:Prehistoric ostracod genera Category:Devonian animals Category:Late Devonian animals Category:Carboniferous animals Category:Fossils of France Category:Fossils of the United States ",
