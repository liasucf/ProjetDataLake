    "text": "George Frederick Gair (13 October 1926 \u2013 17 August 2015) was a New Zealand politician. He was once deputy leader of the National Party in the New Zealand Parliament, and was considered by many to be a possible contender for the leadership itself. He was known for his polite and diplomatic style, which often contrasted with the political situation around him \u2013 Michael Laws described him as \"a refugee from the age of manners.\" ==Early life and family== Gair was born in Dunedin, but moved to Wellington when young. He was a graduate of Victoria University and University of Auckland. He worked as a journalist at The New Zealand Herald from 1945 to 1947 then travelled to Japan before moving to Melbourne where he worked for The Sun News-Pictorial from 1949 to 1950 before returning to New Zealand after accepting a position at the Auckland Star between 1950 and 1952. Gair married Esther Mary Fay Levy in about 1950, and the couple went on to have three children, including make-up artist and body painter Joanne Gair. From 1952 to 1957 Gair was a public relations officer in Auckland. He also became involved in the organisational wing of the National Party, and briefly served on the parliamentary staff of Keith Holyoake from 1958 to 1960. From 1960 to 1966 he was the personal assistant to the general manager of Air New Zealand. ==Member of Parliament== He was an organiser for the National Party in the Onehunga and Roskill electorates. He then became the deputy chairman of National's Auckland division and a dominion councillor of the party. Gair first stood for the National Party nomination for the Remuera electorate in the 1966 election, losing the nomination to Allan Highet. Gair then went across the bridge and contested and won the North Shore nomination from retiring National MP Dean Eyre. He was successful, and was elected to Parliament that year.\"Members of the House of Representatives Elected-General Election\" (15 January 1970) 1 New Zealand Gazette 1 at 24. In 1969 he was appointed Parliamentary Under- Secretary of Education and Science. ===Cabinet minister=== In Parliament, Gair came to be regarded as a competent and diligent administrator. He briefly became Minister of Customs in 1972\"Ministers Appointed\" (9 February 1972) 12 New Zealand Gazette 253 at 254.\"Members of the Executive Council Appointed\" (9 February 1972) 12 New Zealand Gazette 253. at the end of the Second National government, but this was interrupted when National lost the 1972 election to the Labour Party under Norman Kirk. When National was returned to power in the 1975 election, Gair was returned to cabinet in the Third National government. Between that time and National's defeat in the 1984 election, Gair held a number of challenging portfolios, including serving as Minister of Health and Minister of Social Welfare. He also served as Minister of Housing, Minister of Energy, Minister of Transport, Minister of Railways and a number of other roles. ===Political views=== Gair also distinguished himself for some of his personal views. Gair, although a member of the country's main conservative party, generally adopted a \"live and let live\" approach to social and moral issues, rejecting what he saw as \"intolerance\" in some of his colleagues. These beliefs were especially noticeable when, in the late 1970s, Gair opposed measures to restrict abortion. Barry Gustafson, in his history of the National Party, called Gair \"the most effective strategist of the parliamentary pro- abortion lobby\". Gair's support of abortion earned him the hostility of many National Party colleagues, including that of the party's leader, Robert Muldoon. Muldoon was already somewhat distrustful of Gair, as Gair had occasionally been spoken of as an alternative party leader. The political styles of Muldoon and Gair were radically different \u2013 Muldoon had a reputation as being tough and confrontational, while Gair was seen as polite and diplomatic. Some members of the party who disliked Muldoon's \"dictatorial\" style saw Gair as a possible alternative. ===Colonels' Coup=== In 1980, when a number of party dissidents began to plot against Muldoon's leadership, Gair was on the list of potential replacements. However, Gair was regarded as too liberal to gain majority support within the party. The dissidents eventually decided to encourage Brian Talboys, the party's deputy leader, to make a leadership bid (now called the \"Colonels' Coup\"). Gair was not involved in planning this bid, but was supportive of it, and worked hard to convince Talboys that a challenge was a good idea. In the end, however, Talboys bailed out, and the coup collapsed without a vote ever being taken. Gair continued to advocate a challenge, but Talboys was adamant that preserving party unity was more important than curbing Muldoon's damaging leadership style. Later, after Talboys had retired from politics, Gair supported another Muldoon opponent, Derek Quigley, to replace Talboys as deputy leader. Some time after Muldoon was finally deposed by Jim McLay in 1984, Gair (along with Muldoon ally Bill Birch) was demoted considerably. This was intended to make room for new, younger figures, who McLay hoped would \"rejuvenate\" the party. The move was highly damaging to McLay, however, as it placed both Gair and Birch directly in opposition to him. As two of the most experienced people in the National Party, the two were able to mobilise substantial support in favour of McLay's main rival, Jim Bolger. Bolger quickly defeated McLay, and Gair himself took the position of deputy leader. He was additionally given the coveted finance portfolio by Bolger. ===Deputy leader=== Shortly after Gair became deputy leader, he found himself at odds with a number of his colleagues once again. The Homosexual Law Reform Bill, a private bill by Labour's Fran Wilde to lift restrictions on homosexuality, was being hotly debated. Gair was somewhat ambivalent towards the bill, believing that while change was \"long overdue\", certain aspects of the bill went too far. On 2 July 1986, Gair's vote blocked a motion of closure on the bill, which would have brought it to a vote \u2013 because of bad weather, a number of the bill's supporters were unable to be in Parliament that day, and since a few votes could potentially decide the fate of the bill, Gair believed it unfair to let the vote go ahead. Had he voted for closure, the bill would probably have been defeated, and many of the bill's opponents therefore blamed Gair for its subsequent success. One week later, when the vote actually occurred, it passed only by a narrow majority \u2013 Gair himself eventually voted in favour. Gair found the entire episode highly stressful, and spoke of his desire for reconciliation. Following National's loss at the 1987 election Gair was challenged for the position of deputy leader by Ruth Richardson. Rather than attempt to beat off the challenge, the genial Gair retired voluntarily and backed Bolger's preferred deputy Don McKinnon who narrowly defeated Richardson by a single vote to take his place as deputy leader. ==Mayor of North Shore City== Gair served as the 3rd Mayor of North Shore City from 1995 until 1998, defeating incumbent Paul Titchener. ==Later life and death== Gair retired from Parliament at the 1990 elections. He later served as the High Commissioner to London. He lived in Northcross on the North Shore. Gair died on 17 August 2015. His wife, Fay Gair, died in 2018. ==Honours and awards== In the 1988 Queen's Birthday Honours, Gair was made a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. In the 1994 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:1926 births Category:2015 deaths Category:New Zealand journalists Category:Mayors of North Shore City Category:People from Dunedin Category:Members of the Cabinet of New Zealand Category:Ministers of Housing (New Zealand) Category:New Zealand National Party MPs Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:Victoria University of Wellington alumni Category:High Commissioners of New Zealand to the United Kingdom Category:New Zealand MPs for Auckland electorates Category:Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:New Zealand Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Companions of the Queen's Service Order ",
