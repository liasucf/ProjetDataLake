M\u00e4rchen Spiele by Mathilde Wesendonck (published: D\u00fcsseldorf, 1864) Grave of Mathilde Wesendonck and family in Bonn, Germany Mathilde Wesendonck (23 December 182831 August 1902) was a German poet and author. The words of five of her verses were the basis of her friend Richard Wagner's Wesendonck Lieder. He may have been her paramour. ==Biography== Agnes Mathilde Luckemeyer was born in Elberfeld (now part of Wuppertal) in the Rhineland of Germany in 1828. In 1848 she married the silk merchant Otto Wesendonck (sometimes erroneously seen as von Wesendonck). Otto was a great admirer of Wagner's music, and after he and Mathilde met the composer in Zurich in 1852, he placed a cottage on his estate at Wagner's disposal. By 1857, Wagner had become infatuated with Mathilde. It is not known whether she returned his affections to the same degree, or if the affair - if there was one - was ever consummated. Nevertheless, the episode inspired Wagner to put aside his work on Der Ring des Nibelungen (which would not be resumed for the next twelve years) and begin work on Tristan und Isolde. In 1858, Wagner's wife Minna intercepted a romantic letter from Wagner to Mathilde. After the resulting confrontation, Wagner left Z\u00fcrich alone, for Venice. Minna went to Dresden to stay with her family. She wrote to Mathilde before departing for Dresden: > \"I must tell you with a bleeding heart that you have succeeded in separating > my husband from me after nearly twenty-two years of marriage. May this noble > deed contribute to your peace of mind, to your happiness.\"Burck, John N, > Letters of Richard Wagner - The Burrell Collection, The Macmillan Company, > New York, 1950, page 374. In her autobiographical reminiscences Mathilde later wrote about Wagner's stay in Z\u00fcrich, but made no mention of troubles with Minna. In 1866 Mathilde met with Johannes Brahms in Z\u00fcrich and enabled him to study some of Wagner's manuscripts.Musgrave (2000), p. 56. Mathilde Wesendonck died in Altm\u00fcnster (Austria) in 1902, and she is buried at the Alter Friedhof with the Wesendonck family in Bonn, Germany. ==Selected works== * Gedichte, Volkslieder, Legenden, Sagen (ca. 1864) * M\u00e4rchen u.
