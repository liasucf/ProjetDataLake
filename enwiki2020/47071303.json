A\u00f1aterve was the Guanche mencey (king) of Menceyato de G\u00fc\u00edmar at the time of the conquest of Tenerife in the 15th century. ==Kingship and European invasion== A\u00f1aterve, a Berber, was the king of G\u00fc\u00edmar. This territory had an evangelizing mission since the mid-15th century. A\u00f1aterve was the first mencey to join the peace pact with the Europeans. The peace agreement was signed with the governor of Gran Canaria, Pedro de Vera, in 1490 before being quickly ratified by the mencey with Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo in 1494 shortly after the first landing of the conquering army.La Conquista de Tenerife (1494-1496) The mencey of G\u00fc\u00edmar actively collaborated with the conquerors, providing auxiliary troops and supplies throughout the campaign. ==Later years== After the conquest in 1496, A\u00f1aterve was taken, along with six other menceyes, to Spain by Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo to be presented to the Catholic Monarchs. He then returned to Tenerife to live under Spanish rule. His later history is not known before dying in military action. == References == == External links == * Los guanches Category:15th-century Berber people Category:Berber rulers Category:Guanche people Category:Military personnel killed in action Category:People from Tenerife ",
