He is known for his trompe l'oeil still lifes of game birds.Ma Pacco, 'Laurent Geedts' in: Dictionnaire des peintres belges == Life == Laurent Geedts was born in Leuven where he appears to have been active throughout his career. He is the first artist in the Geedts family and was followed by a large number of painters, sculptors and engravers. His nephew Josse-Pieter Geedts was a genre, history and religious artist and Josse- Pieter\u2019s son Pieter Paul was a portrait painter, lithographer and sculptor. The artists in the Geedts family further included Guillaume-Auguste (1802\u20131866) and his three sons Auguste, Hippolyte and Paul.Laurent Geedts, Trompe l\u2019oeil still life of birds hanging from nails against a wooden wall at John Bennett Fine Arts, London Laurent Geedts was the master of Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Joseph Jacquin (1756\u20131826). == Work == Trompe l'oeil still life with a dead hare, a wryneck, great spotted woodpecker, thrushes and finches Laurent specialised in still life paintings and in particular trompe l'oeil still lifes of game. He was active as a decorative artist whose works were designed to be displayed over a chimney or as an over-door. He produced accurately observed depictions of birds. His work continued the tradition of trompe l'oeil still lifes of game of the Netherlandish masters of the 17th century such as Jacob Biltius, Cornelis Biltius and Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrechts. His illusionistic works of game birds against a plain or wooden wall use natural light and shade effects, combined with a very detailed and precise rendering of the plumage to create the trompe l'oeil effect that they appear to be real. == References == == External links == * Category:1728 births Category:1813 deaths Category:Flemish still life painters Category:People from Leuven ",
