    "text": "Detail of a Ch\u00e2teau Batailley 1947 label Ch\u00e2teau Batailley is a winery in the Pauillac appellation of the Bordeaux region of France. The wine produced at the estate was classified as one of eighteen Cinqui\u00e8mes Crus (Fifth Growths) in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855.MacNeil, Karen, (2001). The Wine Bible, Workman Publishing, p. 885, ==History== The current name has been in use since the end of the 18th century, when the vineyard was owned by the Saint-Martin family. The property then saw a succession of owners and temporary partition until the estate was largely restored and expanded by Daniel Guestier of Barton & Guestier after 1816. The estate was first mentioned in classification by Abraham Lawton in 1815, as a \"fifth growth\" under the name of \"Bedou\", and in 1846 by Charles Cocks under the name of proprietor Guestier. By Guestier's death in 1847 Batailley was established as a fifth cru ahead of the 1855 M\u00e9doc classification. Brothers Fran\u00e7ois and Marcel Borie purchased the estate in 1932, and in 1942 divided it into the two properties that are today Batailley and Haut-Batailley, in order to prevent future difficulties with inheritance laws. The larger part, which included the ch\u00e2teau, became the sole property of Marcel Borie until his death in 1961, when it passed to his daughter Denise and her husband Emile Cast\u00e9ja. Batailley is currently owned by the Cast\u00e9ja family, whose Borie-Manoux holdings also include the Pauillac fifth growth Ch\u00e2teau Lynch-Moussas H. Johnson & J. Robinson (2005).
