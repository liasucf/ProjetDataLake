Prior to 1974, the vessel was called HMAS Salamaua (L 131) and was operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). ==Design and construction== The eight-vessel Balikpapan class was ordered as a locally manufactured replacement for the Australian Army's LSM-1-class landing ship medium and ALC 50 landing craft.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, pgs 79, 125 They are long, with a beam of , and a draught of .Wertheim (ed.), The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, p. 26 The landing craft have a standard displacement of 316 tons, with a full load displacement of 503 tons. They are propelled by two G.M. Detroit 6-71 diesel motors, providing 675 brake horsepower to the two propeller shafts, allowing the vessels to reach . The standard ship's company is 13-strong. The Balikpapans are equipped with a Decca RM 916 navigational radar, and fitted with two machine guns for self-defence. The LCHs have a maximum payload of 180 tons; equivalent to 3 Leopard 1 tanks, 13 M113 armored personnel carriers 23 quarter-tonne trucks, or four LARC-V amphibious cargo vehicles.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 79 As a troop transport, a Balikpapan-class vessel can transport up to 400 soldiers between a larger amphibious ship and the shore, or embark 60 soldiers in six-berth caravans for longer voyages. The vessel's payload affects the range: at 175 tons of cargo, each vessel has a range of , which increases to with a 150-ton payload, and when unladen. The flat, box-like keel causes the ships to roll considerably in other-than-calm conditions, limiting their ability to make long voyages. Salamaua was laid down Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 29 May 1972, launched on 27 July 1972, and commissioned into the RAN on 19 October 1973.Swinden, Heavy Lifting for Four Decades, p. 20 ==Operational history== Salamaua was transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force on 14 November 1974. She was in active service as of 2013.Swinden, Heavy Lifting for Four Decades, p. 21 She was retired on June 19, 2020. ==References== ==Sources== Books * * Journal articles * Category:Balikpapan-class landing craft heavy of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force Category:1972 ships ",
