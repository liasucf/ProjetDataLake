    "text": "Eid al-Ghadir () is a Shia feast, and is considered to be among the \"significant\" feasts of Shia Islam. The Eid is held on 18 Dhu Al-Hijjah at the time when the Islamic prophet Muhammad was said to have appointed Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor. According to hadiths, this Eid has been named \"Eid-e Bozorg-e El\u0101hi\" (Persian: \u0639\u06cc\u062f \u0628\u0632\u0631\u06af \u0627\u0644\u0647\u06cc) (i.e. the greatest divine Eid),Al- Hurr al-Aamili, Was\u0101'il al-Sh\u012b\u02bfa, V.8, P.89 \"Eid Ahl al-Bayt Muhammad\"The celebration of Ghaidr mashreghnews.ir Retrieved 15 September 2018Sayyed Ibn Tawus, Iqbal al-A'mal, V.2, P.261 and Ashraf al-A'yaad (i.e. the supreme Eid).Eid Ghadir (Ghadeer) yjc.irMuhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni, Kitab al-Kafi, V.4, P.148 == Religious background == Ten years after the migration (Hijrah), the Islamic prophet Muhammad ordered his followers to call upon people everywhere to join him in his last pilgrimage. Islamic scholars believe more than seventy thousand people followed Muhammad on his way to Mecca, where, on the fourth day of the month of Dhu'l-Hijjah, there were more than one hundred thousand Muslims present for his entry into the city.Ghadir Khum al- islam.orgEvent of Ghadir Khumm Irfan.ir While returning from this pilgrimage, on 18 Dhu'l-Hijjah 10 AH (March 632 CE) at an area known as Ghadir Khumm, Muhammad delivered a well-known sermon during which he called up his cousin and son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib and declared, \"to whomsoever I am Mawla, Ali is also their Mawla\". While the meaning of the word Mawla can be interpreted in several ways, including as \"friend\" or \"master\", Shi'ites view it as being the latter and thus see the sermon as being the official designation of Ali as Muhammad's successor. As a result, the date of the sermon is considered to be one of the foundational events of Shia Islam, with the anniversary becoming one of its most important annual celebrations as \"Eid al-Ghadir\". == Celebration == Shia Muslims throughout the world celebrate this event annually with diverse customs.The celebration of the event of Ghadir Khum irna.irEid (feast) Ghadir-Khum afkarnews.com It is held in different countries, including Iran,Ghadir Khum (Eid) farsnews.comGhadir celebration, Ahwaz, Iran aparat.comGhadir celebration irinn.ir Retrieved 22 September 2018 India, Pakistan, Azerbaijan,Islamic countries, Eid Ghadir Khum hawzah.net Iraq,Iraq, Eid Ghadir-Khum alalam.ir Retrieved 22 September 2018Eid Ghadir Khum, Iraq shia-news.com Retrieved 22 September 2018 UAE, Yemen, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Bahrain, and Syria.
