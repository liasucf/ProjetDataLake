    "text": "William \"Willie\" Whiteley (31 May 1870 \u2013 28 October 1938), also known by the nickname of \"Bobby\", was an English rugby union footballer who played in the 1890s. He played at representative level for England, and at club level for Bramley, as a forward, e.g. front row, lock, or back row. Prior to Tuesday 2 June 1896, Bramley was a rugby union club. ==Background== Bobby Whiteley was born in Bury, Lancashire, England, and he died aged 68 in Dearnley, Littleborough, Lancashire, England. ==Playing career== ===International honours=== Bobby Whiteley won a cap for England while at Bramley in the 1896 Home Nations Championship against Wales at Rectory Field, Blackheath, London. ===Change of Code=== When Bramley converted from the rugby union code to the rugby league code on Tuesday 2 June 1896, Bobby Whiteley would have been approximately 25 years of age.
