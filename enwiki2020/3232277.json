This road passes over four summits: #at Dava Moor 1053 ft (321m), #west of Bridge of Brown 1436 ft (438m), #at the Lecht Ski Centre 2090 ft (637m), #at the Gairnshiel Summit 1836 ft (550m). On the old A939, now redesignated the B976 between Gairnshiel Bridge and Crathie, the road reaches 1568 ft (478m). The A939 is regularly the first road in Great Britain closed due to snowfall between Cock Bridge and Tomintoul. ==See also== *List of the highest roads in Scotland ==External links== * A939 road at SABRE Category:Mountain passes of Scotland Category:Roads in Scotland Category:Scenic routes in the United Kingdom Category:Transport in Highland (council area) ",
