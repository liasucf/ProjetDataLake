Visible in the centre of the image is Concorde G-BOAB, which has been present at the airport since landing there in 2000. Myrtle Avenue is a street in the London Borough of Hounslow which is near the eastern end of Heathrow airport's south runway, 27L. This makes it especially noisy when aircraft are landing or taking off but its view of the aircraft has made it the prime location for plane spotting. Every day, dozens of spotters from all over the world go there to log and photograph the aircraft. At the end of the road is a large green space which is directly underneath the flight paths to and from Runway 27L. The nearby tube station of Hatton Cross and a petrol station provide refreshments. On special occasions, such as the arrival of a new type of aircraft, there may be hundreds of spectators there, including the general public as well as regular spotters. In 2019, the street was featured in the BBC's Planespotting Live show, where Arthur Williams interviewed aviation enthusiasts. ==References== Category:Heathrow Airport Category:Streets in the London Borough of Hounslow Category:Tourist attractions in the London Borough of Hounslow ",
