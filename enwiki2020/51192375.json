Selbys purchase was one of a number of purchases of armed ships or ship- sloops where the Navy's intent was to use them as convoy escorts. Selby was at the raid on Dunkirk, though she played no real role. The Navy sold her in 1801. She then returned to being a merchantman. She is last listed in 1810, trading between London and Jamaica. ==Merchantman== Selby first appears in published British registries in the 1793 volume of Lloyd's Register. Her master is Woodhouse, and her owner is Woodcock. Her trade is Liverpool to Ostend.Lloyd's Register (1793), Seq.\u2116S515. Selby still appears in the 1799 volume of Lloyd's Register, which presumably went to press before her sale to the Navy. Her master is Thompson, and she is sailing between Riga and Portsmouth.Lloyd's Register (1799), Seq.\u2116S137. ==Naval career== The Navy purchased Selby in 1798. Between 5 April and 3 May she was at Perry & Co., Blackwall, undergoing fitting-out. Commander Thomas Palmer commissioned Selby in May 1798 at Sheerness. Then on 16 July she moved to Woolwich Dockyard for further work. Selby was at the Nore when at 7:30 in the morning of 3 May 1800 Palmer shot himself. A brief obituary in the Naval Chronicle reported, \"the unfortunate death ... of Captain Palmer, of the Selby sloop of war, who shot himself in a fit of insanity; which circumstance, however deplorable, will tend, in the eyes of his friends, to lessen the calamity.\"Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.420. At some point Commander William Compton took command of Selby and he was her captain between 27 June and 8 July 1800, when Selby participated in the raid on Dunkirk. This was an operation to capture the French frigate D\u00e9sir\u00e9e from Dunkerque harbour and burn other vessels. Contrary winds and a succession of unfavourable tides afforded no opportunity of making the attack until 7 July. Captain Inman, of , was in charge of the operation. He sent , under Patrick Campbell, against the easternmost vessel, and loosed his four fireships, , , , and against the westernmost vessels. Dart captured D\u00e9sir\u00e9e on 8 July. Even though their captains remained on the fireships until the four were engulfed in flames, the three frigates that were their targets cut their cables and escaped down the Inner Channel within the Braak Sand. There one briefly ran aground but her crew got her off again. Inman had kept Selby back, intending that if any French vessels ran aground she could come up and throw carcasses aboard them He stated that his plan had been an error in that if Selby had been forward he was sure that she could have captured that vessel. D\u00e9sir\u00e9e was subsequently purchased into the Service. The officers and crews of many British vessels, Rosario among them, shared in the proceeds of the capture. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"Capture of the Desiree\" to all surviving claimants from the action. On 19 Mar 1801 Selby recaptured Freedom, James Holden, master, that a French privateer had previously taken. The \"Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\" offered Selby, of 348 tons and copper- fastened, for sale at Sheerness on 16 December 1801. She sold on that day for \u00a31850. ==Merchantman== Selby appears in Lloyd's Register (LR) for 1802 with Thompson, master, and Woodcock, owner.LR: Seq. \u2116S255. On 12 April 1804, Selby, Peters, master, Cox & Co. owners, ran aground at Margate on her way to Jamaica.Lloyd's List, \u21164445. Selby was last listed in the Register of Shipping in 1810 with D. Peters, master, Higgins, owner, and trade London\u2014Jamaica.Register of Shipping (1810), Seq.S289. ==Citations and references== Citations References * Category:Ships built in Whitby Category:1791 ships Category:Sloops of the Royal Navy Category:Age of Sail merchant ships Category:Merchant ships of the United Kingdom ",
