Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden led an assault from the camp in H\u00f6gsby in Sm\u00e5land on Kristianopel in Blekinge. The Swedes managed to siege the fortified city and went in by bombing the fortress port, which was badly defended. Right after the assault, there was a massacre on the city's population, with rape and pillaging. == Bibliography == * Gustav Adolf II och Sk\u00e5neland (in Swedish) * Ulf Sundberg Svenska Krig 1521-1814 1998 (in Swedish) * G\u00f6te G\u00f6ransson Gustav II Adolf och hans folk 1994 (in Swedish) Category:1611 in Denmark Kristianopel Kristianopel Kristianopel Category:Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden Category:Conflicts in 1611 ",
