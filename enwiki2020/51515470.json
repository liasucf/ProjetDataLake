Mr. Brady's poetic genius is, while distinctly Australian, sufficiently international to voice the feelings and aspirations even of those who 'go down to the sea in ships;' and in the delineation of Love's tender or melancholy moods he is not easily surpassed\"\"Women and Wine\", The Truth, 15 February 1903, p3 In their review The Brisbane Courier was impressed, to a point: \"Mr. Brady is a well-known verse writer \u2013 we had almost said poet \u2013 and The Ways of Many Waters has given him a right to inclusion in the ranks of our sweetest singers at all events. He is undoubtedly a singer; his verses flow melodiously, his taste is excellent, and there is thought if not inspiration in much that he has to tell.\"\"Reviews\", The Brisbane Courier, 6 December 1902, p13 ==See also== * 1902 in Australian literature * 1902 in poetry ==References== Category:Australian poetry collections Category:1902 poetry books ",
