Amid the intercommunal violence, the Turkish Cypriot inhabitants of Neo Chorio fled to Androlykou, a nearby Turkish Cypriot village. In 1975, following the Turkish invasion of the previous year and subsequent division of the island, most Turkish Cypriots of Neo Chorio resettled in Myrtou, now in Northern Cyprus. In 2011, Neo Chorio had a population of 519.
