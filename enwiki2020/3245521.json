    "text": "Crown jellyfishes are the six families of true jellyfish that belong to the order Coronatae.Daly, Brugler, Cartwright, Collins, Dawson, Fautin, France, McFadden, Opresko, Rodriguez, Romano & Stake (2007). The phylum Cnidaria: A review of phylogenetic patterns and diversity 300 years after Linnaeus. Zootaxa 1668: 127\u2013182 They are distinguished from other jellyfish by the presence of a deep groove running around the umbrella, giving them the crown shape from which they take their name. Many of the species in the order inhabit deep sea environments. Crown jellyfish are able to make light through bioluminescence. When they are touched, their bells will light up. Otherwise, the bell of a crown jellyfish will look transparent when undisturbed. When they are attacked, crown jellyfish are able to startle, mislead, and distract their predators with the light that they produce. They may also use their bioluminescence to lure or dazzle their prey. ==Families== , 53 recognized extant species were in the order Coronatae, spread throughout 12 genera. These belong in the following six families: * Atollidae (Bigelow, 1913)\u2014 one genus, seven species * Atorellidae (Vanh\u00f6ffen, 1902)\u2014 one genus, five species * Coronatae incertae sedis \u2014 one genus, four species * Linuchidae (Haeckel, 1880)\u2014 two genera, three species * Nausithoidae (Claus, 1883)\u2014 three genera, 26 species * Paraphyllinidae (Mass, 1903)\u2014 one genus, three species * Periphyllidae (Haeckel)\u2014 four genera, six species Image:Atolla wyvillei (Operation Deep Scope 2004).jpg|Atolla wyvillei Image:Medusae of world-vol03 fig352-353 Nausitho\u00eb punctata.jpg|Nausithoe punctata Image:Haeckel Peromedusae.jpg|Periphylla periphylla ==References== ",
