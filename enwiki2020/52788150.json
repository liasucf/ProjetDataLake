It was established by Lebanese media entrepreneur Raghid El Chammah in October 1981 and bought by Prime Minister Rafic Hariri on December 27, 1994. It broadcasts mainly in Arabic language with some various programming and news in French language as well. The French station is considered part of Les Ind\u00e9s Radios, a groupement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique (Economic Interest Grouping) created in 1992, and currently composed of 125 local radio stations in France. It is mainly interested in the Arab World and Middle Eastern issues in addition to catering to Arab diaspora and Muslim communities in France and Europe. It operates on basis of a moderate and tolerant Arab standpoint respectful of the laic traditions of France.

The Lebanese studios are situated in the Lebanese capital Beirut. ==Frequencies== ===France=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" |+ Situation on 1 March 2014 |- ! scope=col | City / Department ! scope=col | Sector ! scope=col | Frequency ! scope=col | Power ! scope=col | Transmission from |- |Paris (75)||\u00cele-de-France||94.3 MHz||4 kW||Paris |- |Oise (60)||Beauvais||94.3 MHz||500 W||Aux Marais |- |Eure (27)||\u00c9vreux||106.5 MHz||1 kW||Gravigny |- |Eure-et-Loir (28)||Dreux||106.6 MHz||1 kW||Vernouillet (Eure-et-Loir) |- |Rh\u00f4ne (69)||Lyon||106.7 MHz||1 kW||Lyon |- |Is\u00e8re (38)||Vienne, Is\u00e8re||97.7 MHz||1 kW||Sainte-Colombe (Rh\u00f4ne) |- |Haute-Savoie (74)||Annemasse||92.7 MHz||500 W||Monnetier-Mornex |- |Var (83)||Toulon||89.4 MHz||2 kW||Six-Fours-les-Plages |- |Loiret (45)||Montargis||91.4 MHz||300 W||Amilly (Loiret) |- |Gironde (33)||Bordeaux||106.4 MHz||5 kW||Bouliac |- |Loire-Atlantique (44)||Nantes||92.4 MHz||200 W||Saint-Herblain |- |} There are also retransmissions in Besan\u00e7on, Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, Ch\u00e2lons-en- Champagne, Limoges et Saint-Dizier. ===Middle East / Arab World=== ;Lebanon * Beirut - 88.7 MHz * Saida - 88.3 MHz * Tripoli - 88.3 MHz ==References== ==External links== * - Radio Orient Paris * * - Radio Orient Lebanon Category:Arabic-language radio stations Category:French-language radio stations Category:Radio stations in France Category:Radio stations in Lebanon Category:Radio stations established in 1982 ",
