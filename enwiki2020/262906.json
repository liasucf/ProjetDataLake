    "text": "An open format is a file format for storing digital data, defined by a published specification usually maintained by a standards organization, and which can be used and implemented by anyone. For example, an open format can be implemented by both proprietary and free and open-source software, using the typical software licenses used by each. In contrast to open formats, closed formats are considered trade secrets. Open formats are also called free file formats if they are not encumbered by any copyrights, patents, trademarks or other restrictions (for example, if they are in the public domain) so that anyone may use them at no monetary cost for any desired purpose. ==Specific definitions== ===Sun Microsystems=== Sun Microsystems defines the criteria for open formats as follows:Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.0 \u2013 OASIS Standard, 1 May 2005 * The format is based on an underlying open standard * The format is developed through a publicly visible, community driven process * The format is affirmed and maintained by a vendor- independent standards organization * The format is fully documented and publicly available * The format does not contain proprietary extensions ===US government=== Within the framework of Open Government Initiative, the federal government of the United States adopted the Open Government Directive, according to which: \"An open format is one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information\". ===State of Minnesota=== The State of Minnesota defines the criteria for open, XML-based file formats as follows:Meanwhile, Deep Down in Texas: An Open Format Bill is Filed \u2013 Tuesday, 6 February 2007 @ 03:55 PM PST Contributed by: Andy Updegrove \u2013 ConsortiumInfo.org * The format is interoperable among diverse internal and external platforms and applications * The format is fully published and available royalty-free * The format is implemented by multiple vendors * The format is controlled by an open industry organization with a well-defined inclusive process for evolution of the standard ===Commonwealth of Massachusetts=== The Commonwealth of Massachusetts \"defines open formats as specifications for data file formats that are based on an underlying open standard, developed by an open community, affirmed and maintained by a standards body and are fully documented and publicly available.\"Major Revision of Massachusetts Enterprise Technical Reference Model (ETRM). Robin Cover, Editor \u2013 Created: 3 July 2007. \u2013 Cover Pages The Enterprise Technical Reference Model (ETRM) classifies four formats as \"Open Formats\": #OASIS Open Document Format For Office Applications (OpenDocument) v. 1.1 #Ecma-376 Office Open XML Formats (Open XML) #Hypertext Document Format v. 4.01 #Plain Text Format ===The Linux Information Project=== According to The Linux Information Project, the term open format should refer to \"any format that is published for anyone to read and study but which may or may not be encumbered by patents, copyrights or other restrictions on use\" \u2013 as opposed to a free format which is not encumbered by any copyrights, patents, trademarks or other restrictions. ==Examples of open formats== Open formats include: *PNG \u2014 a raster image format standardized by ISO/IEC *FLAC \u2014 lossless audio codec *WebM \u2014 a video/audio container format * HTML \u2014 HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main markup language for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. *gzip \u2014 for compression * CSS \u2014 style sheet format usually used with (X)HTML, standardized by W3C ==See also== * Embrace, extend and extinguish * Free protocol * Free software * List of open-source codecs * Open educational resources * Open source * Open standard * Open system * Open content * Network effect * Vendor lock-in ==References== ==External links== *OpenFormats *Practical Advice for using Free Formats from Ubuntu Community Documentation *Study on the: Economic impact of open source software on innovation and the competitiveness of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector in the EU, 2006 EU report in favor of adopting open source software * Free File Format Definition * Definition of Free Cultural Works Category:Computer file formats ",
