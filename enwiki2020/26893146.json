The name Netsky is based on the computer virus of the same name. ==History== Netsky produces music of the liquid funk style \u2013 drum and bass music with many instrumental layers and frequent vocals. High Contrast's 'Gold Digger' remix was a major influence on him. In late 2009, Netsky signed a recording contract with Hospital Records, the same label as other well known liquid artists such as High Contrast and London Elektricity. He also won a nomination as \"Best Upcoming Producer\" within just months of his first release at the 2010 Drum & Bass Arena Awards. Hospital Records released Netsky's self-titled debut album on 31 May 2010. His second album, titled 2, was released on 25 June 2012.Hospital Podcast 109. Netsky's second feature length album was released at the end of June 2012, on Hospital Records. The album features three singles and a deluxe edition was later released supported by a fourth single, \"We Can Only Live Today (Puppy)\". Between 2013 and 2014, Netsky left Hospital Records to sign with Sony Music under Ultra Music, but with a special A&R; arrangement to continue connections with Hospital Records. His 2015 single \"Rio\" was featured in the London 2016 New Year's celebrations. In early 2020, Netsky re- signed with Hospital Records and released the single, \"I See The Future in Your Eyes\". ==Netsky Live! project== In April 2012, during a Hospitality festival at Brixton Academy, Netsky unveiled his \"Netsky LIVE!\" project for the first time. Accompanied by a team of live musicians, as well as guest vocalists (of whom have sung on Netsky's catalogue of music), Netsky performs his music as a full band, taking center-stage on keyboards and synthesizers. The band now tours the world performing headlining shows around the globe, as well as performing at many international electronic music festivals, such as the Ultra Music Festival in the United States. ;Netsky Live!
