After the war in Croatia 1991-1995 many residents fled the village to find refuge in safer areas. ==Geography== The village sits along Svinica Creek that starts from the spring in the upper part of the village. On the way downstream creek powers about dozen watermills that were used to ground crops such as corn and wheat. The village is positioned in the area next to the old Roman roads, but there is no existing proof of settlement being there during this period. There are two Serbian Orthodox Churches in the village; Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Jovan and Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Petka. ==Economy== The chief occupations are farming, forestry, and hunting. ==References== Category:Populated places in Sisak-Moslavina County Category:Serb communities in Croatia ",
