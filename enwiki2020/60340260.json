    "text": "Cint\u0101ma\u1e47icakra () is a bodhisattva and a manifestation of Avalokite\u015bvara. He is counted as one among six forms that represent salvation afforded to beings among the six realms of samsara. The symbols of his original vow are the Cint\u0101ma\u1e47i and the crimson lotus. His seed syllable is \u0939\u094d\u0930\u0940 (). Among the six incarnations, he is sometimes referred to as \u5927\u68b5\u6df1\u9060\u89c0\u4e16\u97f3 (Avalokite\u015bvara as Mah\u0101brahm\u0101 the Profound). ==Iconography== Since the Heian period, Cint\u0101ma\u1e47icakra has often been depicted with six arms and sitting atop a lotus on a rock protruding from the ocean. This may be a reference to Mount Potalaka, Avalokite\u015bvara's legendary abode. His right knee is raised with his right foot resting on the left foot. He wears a crown that bears an image of Amit\u0101bha Buddha. In his left hands he holds a lotus and a wheel, while the third arm rests on the dais. His right hands hold a rosary, a wish-fulfilling jewel, and the third usually caresses his face in an attitude of contemplation. Several variations exist, and Cint\u0101ma\u1e47icakra may have anywhere from two to twelve arms. In two-armed images, he does not hold a jewel and he may be seated with his right leg crossed at the ankle over his left leg. This imagery is similar to that of the statue of Maitreya at Ch\u016bg\u016b-ji in Nara, which has been mistakenly venerated as Cint\u0101ma\u1e47icakra. ==Mantra== Several mantras are attributed to Cint\u0101ma\u1e47icakra. * * * ==References== Category:Bodhisattvas Category:Avalokite\u015bvara ",
