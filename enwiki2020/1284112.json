    "text": "Beata Margareta Kristina S\u00f6derbaum (5 September 1912 \u2013 12 February 2001) was a Swedish-born German film actress, producer, and photographer. She is most known for her roles in Nazi-era films. ==Early life== S\u00f6derbaum was born in Stockholm, Sweden; her father, Professor Henrik Gustaf S\u00f6derbaum (1862\u20131933), was the permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. After both her parents died shortly after one another, S\u00f6derbaum moved to Berlin and enrolled in a theatre school. ==Career== ===Nazi era=== Beginning in 1935, S\u00f6derbaum starred in a number of films with director Veit Harlan, whom she married in 1939. Harlan and S\u00f6derbaum made ten films together for the then state-controlled film production company UFA until 1945. According to film historian Antje Ascheid, S\u00f6derbaum is frequently identified as \"most singularly representative of the Nazi ideal, as the quintessential Nazi star\". As a beautiful Swedish blonde, S\u00f6derbaum had the baby-doll looks that epitomized the model Aryan woman. In fact, she had already played the role of the innocent Aryan in a number of feature films and was well-known to German audiences. Her youth and beauty made her a symbol of health and purity and thus an exemplary specimen of the Nazi ideal of womanhood. In a number of her films, she had been imperiled by the threat of rassenschande (\"racial pollution\"). Two such roles were Dorothea Sturm, the doomed heroine of the antisemitic historical melodrama Jud S\u00fc\u00df, who commits suicide by drowning after being raped by the villain and Anna in Die goldene Stadt, a Sudeten German whose desire for the city (in defiance of blood and soil) and whose seduction by a Czech result in her drowning suicide. As a result of her watery fate in these two films, as well as a similar end in her debut in Harlan's 1938 film Jugend, she was given the mock honorary title Reichswasserleiche (\"Drowned Corpse of the Reich\"). Other roles included Elske in Die Reise nach Tilsit, the wholesome German wife whose husband betrays her with a Polish woman, but finally returns, repentant; Elisabeth in Immensee, who marries a rich landowner to forget her unrequited love, and in the end decides to remain faithful even after she is widowed and her lover returns; Aels in Opfergang, a woman who dies after her love affair; Luise Treskow in The Great King, a miller's daughter who encourages Frederick the Great; and Maria in Kolberg, a peasant girl who loyally supports the resistance to Napoleon and is the only survivor of her family. ===Postwar=== In the first few years after the war, S\u00f6derbaum was often heckled off the stage and even had rotten vegetables thrown at her. In subsequent years, she frequently expressed regret for her roles in anti-semitic films. After her husband was again permitted to direct films, S\u00f6derbaum played leading roles in a number of his films. These included Blue Hour (1952), The Prisoner of the Maharaja (1953), Betrayal of Germany (1954), and I Will Carry You on My Hands (1958). Their last joint project was a 1963 theater production of August Strindberg's A Dream Play in Aachen. After Harlan's death in 1964, S\u00f6derbaum became a noted fashion photographer. In 1974 she took a role in Hans-J\u00fcrgen Syberberg's film Karl May. In 1983 she published her memoirs under the title Nichts bleibt immer so (\"Nothing Stays That Way Forever\"). In her later years, S\u00f6derbaum faded into obscurity but still took roles in three movies and the television series The Bergdoktor. Her last film was with Hugh Grant in the thriller Night Train to Venice in 1994. She died in 2001 in a nursing home in Hitzacker, Lower Saxony, Germany. == Filmography == * Uncle Br\u00e4sig (1936) as Minning * ' (1938) as \u00c4nnchen * Covered Tracks (1938) as S\u00e9raphine Lawrence * The Immortal Heart (1939) as Ev Henlein * The Journey to Tilsit (1939) as Elske Settegast * Jud S\u00fc\u00df (1940) as Dorothea Sturm * The Great King (1942) as Luise Treskow * The Golden City (1942) as Anna Jobst * Immensee (1943) * Opfergang (1945) as Aels Flod\u00e9en * Kolberg (1944) as Maria * Immortal Beloved (1951) as Katharina von Hollstein * Hanna Amon (1951) * The Blue Hour (1953) * Stars Over Colombo (1953) * The Prisoner of the Maharaja (1954) * ' (1954) * Two Hearts in May (1958) * I'll Carry You in My Arms (1958) * Die blonde Frau des Maharadscha (1962) * Karl May (1974) * Let's Go Crazy (1983) * Das bleibt das kommt nie wieder (1992) * Night Train to Venice (Train to Hell) (1993) * Der Bergdoktor: Series 1, Episode 11 \"Der Sinn des Lebens\" (\"The Meaning of Life\") (1993) ==References== ==External links== * * Photographs and bibliography Category:1912 births Category:2001 deaths Category:20th-century German actresses Category:20th- century memoirists Category:Actresses from Stockholm Category:German film actresses Category:German memoirists Category:Photographers from Berlin Category:Swedish emigrants to Germany Category:Swedish film actresses Category:Swedish memoirists Category:Swedish photographers Category:Volpi Cup for Best Actress winners Category:Women memoirists ",
