Tatiana Troyanos obituary. \"Busy Time for Williams.\" The Boston Globe, August 27, 1993. Her voice, \"a paradoxical voice \u2014 larger than life yet intensely human, brilliant yet warm, lyric yet dramatic\" \u2014 \"was the kind you recognize after one bar, and never forget\", wrote Cori Ellison in Opera News.Ellison, Cori. \"Tatiana Troyanos: 1938-1993\", Opera News, vol. 58, no. 5, November 1993. Troyanos' performances \"covered the full range of operatic history\" (New York Times)Kozinn, Allan. \"Tatiana Troyanos Is Dead at 54; Mezzo Star of Diverse Repertory\", The New York Times, August 23, 1993, accessed June 18, 2009. in an international career of three decades which also produced a variety of memorable operatic recordings, among them Carmen (co-starring Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and conducted by Georg Solti), cited by Classicalite almost four decades later as \"the finest of all Carmens.\"Inverne, James. \"Classicalite's Five Best: 'Carmen' Recordings\". Classicalite, July 17, 2013, accessed August 11, 2016. After ten years based at the Hamburg State Opera, Troyanos became widely known for her work with the Metropolitan Opera beginning in 1976, with over 270 performances (several dozen of them broadcast or televised) spanning twenty- two major roles. ==Early life== Born in New York City, Troyanos spent her earliest days in the Manhattan neighborhood where Lincoln Center, the new home of the Metropolitan Opera, would arise a quarter century later. She grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, and attended Forest Hills High School. Her early childhood was clouded by a deep sense of abandonment; her parents, operatic hopefuls who, she said, \"had beautiful voices\"Jacobson, Robert. \"Getting It Together.\" Opera News, vol. 47, no. 3, September 1982.\u2014her father, born on the Greek island of Cephalonia, was a tenor, and her mother, from Stuttgart, was a coloratura soprano \u2014 had separated when she was an infant and later divorced, \"ill-matched to each other and ill-suited to parenthood\" (Opera News).Myers, Eric. \"Fever Pitch\". Opera News, vol. 65, no. 5, November 2002. She was looked after by Greek relatives and lived for around a decade at the Brooklyn Home for Children, which had relocated to Forest Hills. She said of her childhood, \"My past is hard to overcome.\" She described the children's home itself as \"bleak but marvelous\". It was there that her life in music began. She studied piano for seven years, first at the home, where her instructor was veteran Metropolitan Opera bassoonist Louis Pietrini, who had volunteered to teach the children a variety of instruments \u2014 initially teaching them solf\u00e8ge, which Troyanos later called \"the basis of my musical education\"Matheopoulos, Helena. Diva: Great Sopranos and Mezzos Discuss Their Art. Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1991, p. 292. \u2014 and her studies continued, on scholarship, at the Brooklyn Music School. In several interviews she recalled early expectations of becoming a concert pianist. \"Determined since childhood,\" by other accounts, \"to become an opera singer,\"Oliver, Myrna. \"Tatiana Troyanos: Versatile Mezzo-Soprano\". Los Angeles Times, August 24, 1993. she sang in school choirs and New York's All City High School Chorus; when she was sixteen, a teacher heard her voice in the chorus and took time \"to find out who the voice belonged to ... and got me to the Juilliard Preparatory School and my first voice teacher.\" In her late teens, Troyanos moved to the Girls' Service League in Manhattan and later to a co-ed boarding house on E. 39th St., not far from the old Met, which she frequently attended as a standee. She was employed as a secretary to the director of publicity at Random House, and performed in choruses, ranging from church choirs (with a scholarship at the First Presbyterian Church) to musical theater; \"Tatiana Troyanos, almost hidden in the chorus, came soaring through with a pellucid and magnificent quality of tone as the Arab Singing Girl,\" proclaimed the Boston Globe's Kevin Kelly in a review of a summer stock production of Fanny in September 1958.Kelly, Kevin. \"Fish Nets and Mussels: 'Fanny' at Carousel\", Boston Globe, September 2, 1958. Continuing at the Juilliard School, Troyanos was chosen as a soloist for Bach's St. John Passion in 1959\"Tatiana Troyanos\", biography in New York Philharmonic Digital Archives, 1967. and for the Verdi Requiem in 1962,\"Juilliard School of Music presents The Verdi Requiem\", The Juilliard Review, vol. IX, no. 1, Winter 1961-2, p. 16, accessed July 19, 2016. by which time she had begun vocal studies with Hans Heinz, who \"understood my voice and helped me open it up at the top ... and gradually I found all my top notes.\" She described Heinz, with whom she continued to study after her graduation in 1963, as \"the major influence in my life ... Our work together built the foundation that was so essential to my career.\"Speck, Gregory. \"Troyanos Talks: A World-Class Prima Donna Discusses Opera Today\" , The World and I, June 1987; accessed August 24, 2012. ==Operatic career: 1963\u201393== ===New York City Opera and Hamburg years=== After a long run in the nuns' chorus in the original Broadway production of The Sound of Music,Troyanos is also credited in the ensemble on the original cast recording. Her exact tenure in the show has been variously reported, but a Playbill for the Mark Hellinger Theater dated January 7, 1963 shows her still in the cast at that time. Troyanos was engaged by the New York City Opera and made her professional operatic debut in April 1963, on the first night of the spring season, as Hippolyta in the New York premiere production of Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream. She sang Jocasta in Stravinsky's Oedipus rex that season, Marina in the company's first production of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov the following year, and various other roles through 1965.Sokol, Martin L. The New York City Opera: An American Adventure. New York: Macmillan, 1981. These years also saw performances of Dorabella in Cos\u00ec fan tutte at the Aspen Music Festival, Carmen at the Kentucky Opera,Kleber, John T., ed. The Encyclopedia of Louisvlle.

Offered a Metropolitan Opera contract with limited stage opportunities, but choosing a path also taken by other American singers at the time, she left in the summer of 1965 in quest of more intensive performing experience in Europe, where, having auditioned successfully for three companies, she was to make the Hamburg State Opera, led by the nurturing Rolf Liebermann, her home base for the next decade, first as a member of its renowned ensemble and later as a guest artist. \"It made sense to go to Germany,\" she recalled. \"I found an intendant [Liebermann] ... who encouraged me and who knew how to further my career slowly. That was really what I wanted. I wanted to be in the theater every day, learning roles slowly, not quickly, and certainly not under any kind of pressure. That's really what I got.\"Chute, James. \"Opera Star Troyanos Happy to Find a Home at the Met\", The Milwaukee Journal, January 15, 1984; accessed October 25, 2013. Her first parts there included Lola in Cavalleria rusticana and Preziosilla in the premiere of a new production of La forza del destino, and by year's end she was singing Carmen, a key role she would later bring to Geneva, London, and the Metropolitan Opera spring tour. Eventually at Hamburg she would sing, in her words, \"just about every mezzo role around.\" But it was the Aix-en- Provence Festival in 1966 (for which Liebermann himself had recommended her) that saw her breakthrough performance in Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos (to the Ariadne of R\u00e9gine Crespin). In her role debut as the Composer, wrote Elizabeth Forbes, \"she made a heart-breaking\u2014and heart-broken\u2014adolescent, whose voice, in Strauss's great paean to the power of music, soared into the warm, Provencal night and seemed to hang there like the stars of a rocket.\"Forbes, Elizabeth. \"Obituary: Tatiana Troyanos\". The Independent, August 26, 1993; accessed November 23, 2012. That performance, followed by her first Octavian in Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier at London's Covent Garden in 1968 (to the Marschallin of Lisa Della Casa), effectively initiated her international career\u2014although, said Liebermann, \"she returned to Hamburg unspoiled\" after her triumph at Aix and \"'took up her modest engagements as if nothing had happened.'\"Soria, Dorle J. \"Musician of the Month: Tatiana Troyanos\", High Fidelity & Musical America, vol. 27, no. 6, June 1977, p. MA-6. The early success at Aix was caught by French television and a kinescope has been preserved.Regine Crespin discography at Discogs, accessed March 14, 2017. \"Troyanos has a sumptuous voice, a very sharp intelligence, enormous ambition, and do-or-die determination to be a great artist,\" observed British record producer Walter Legge,Schwarzkopf, Elisabeth. On and Off the Record: A Memoir of Walter Legge. London: Faber, 1982, p. 81. whose laurels included many of Maria Callas's classic recordings. Troyanos concurred, \"I have this do-or-die determination, probably to overcome past insecurities, difficulties, fears ... certain things never go away. There are things within me that I live with and channel into exciting performances.\" A 1967 Hamburg Opera tour first brought her to the stage of the Metropolitan Opera's new home at Lincoln Center in a selection of twentieth-century repertory including Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress, in which she \"especially excelled with her rich voice\" as Baba the Turk.Kirby, Fred. \"'Maler,' 'Progress' OK, 'Visitation' Is Wanting\". Billboard, July 15, 1967, p. 42, accessed May 9, 2013. Her appearance as Handel's Ariodante opposite Beverly Sills in the opening week of the Kennedy Center in 1971 (under the baton of Julius Rudel, who had originally brought her to the New York City Opera) served to reintroduce her to American opera audiences. There followed debuts at the Lyric Opera of Chicago (as Charlotte in Massenet's Werther, 1971), Dallas Opera (Dido in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas, 1972), Opera Company of Boston (Romeo in Bellini's I Capuleti e i Montecchi, 1975), and notably at San Francisco Opera (Poppea in Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea, 1975\u2014about which Chronicle reviewer Robert Commanday wrote, \"The means by which Poppea seduces Nero ... could liquefy even stone the way the sensational new mezzo soprano Tatiana Troyanos sang\").Quoted in Robert Wilder Blue, \"Remembering Tatiana Troyanos\", page 2; accessed September 22, 2012. ===The Metropolitan Opera years=== Troyanos returned to New York to make her Metropolitan Opera debut as Octavian, closely followed by the Composer, in the spring of 1976. \"The star of the show was Miss Troyanos ... the most aristocratic Octavian at the Met in years,\" wrote Speight Jenkins in a review of the Rosenkavalier in the New York Post. \"She has a large, warming lyric mezzo-soprano with perfect control ... her singing of the Trio and the final duet was perfection itself.\"Jenkins, Speight. \"The Golden Sound of Opera\". New York Post, March 1976, posted at Metropolitan Opera archives, accessed August 24, 2012. Octavian (her most frequently sung role at the Met, with thirty performances through 1986) and the Composer were often described as her signature or calling-card roles. She also became closely identified, on stage and screen, with another trouser role, Sesto in Mozart's La clemenza di Tito, and Martin Mayer wrote in Opera magazine that she \"gave the work a dramatic punch few of us had known was there.\"Mayer, Martin, and Alan Blyth. \"Tatiana Troyanos, 1938-1993\". Opera, vol. 44, no. 10, October 1993, accessed November 25, 2016. Her other most frequent appearances at the Met were as Prince Orlofsky in Johann Strauss's Die Fledermaus, Venus in Wagner's Tannh\u00e4user, Giulietta in Offenbach's Les contes d'Hoffmann, and Eboli in Verdi's Don Carlos. A mainstay and \"one of the most beloved artists at the Metropolitan Opera\"O'Connor, Patrick. \"Tatiana Troyanos: Flair and Flamboyance.\" The Gramophone, December 2003. from 1976 until her death in 1993, she was internationally revered for her uniquely sensual, burnished sound, her versatility and beauty, as well as the thrilling intensity of all her performances. \"Because of the burning intensity and conviction of her dramatic projection,\" wrote Clyde T. McCants in his book on American opera singers, \"sometimes listening to Troyanos's recordings we tend to forget the radiant glory of the voice itself.\"McCants, Clyde T. American Opera Singers and Their Recordings: Critical Commentaries and Discographies. McFarland,2004, pg. 331; While the St. James Opera Encyclopedia acknowledged that \"the persistent pulse of her vibrato,\" which imbued roles like Carmen with \"a fiercely elemental life force,\" was \"not to every listener's taste,\"Fox, David Anthony, in The St. James Opera Encyclopedia, edited by John Guinn and Les Stone. Detroit: Visible Ink Press, 1997, pp. 842-43; David Hamilton offered another perspective: the \"close pickup\" of one recording, he wrote in High Fidelity magazine, \"unflatteringly magnifies the natural vibrato of Tatiana Troyanos' beautiful voice into something more like a beat ... a distortion of the effect she makes in a hall.\"Hamilton, David. Gurre Lieder, in Edith Carter, ed. Records in Review, 1981 Edition. Great Barrington, MA: Wyeth Press, 1981, pg 276. As her \"vibrato uncoiled to yield a plummier sound\", wrote Cori Ellison, \"she chose to stretch her medium-weight voice to suit her temperament\", adding Wagner roles at the Met\u2014beginning with Venus in Tannh\u00e4user (opening the 1978 season) and Kundry in Parsifal (initially in a Saturday matinee broadcast in 1980) \u2014 while continuing to sing Mozart, Handel, and Cavalli.Henahan, Donal. \"Review/Opera; 17th-Century Camp and Kinkiness\", New York Times, August 8, 1989; accessed February 17, 2016.

She also appeared in seven new productions at the Met, including the company's premiere productions of Berg's Lulu (as Countess Geschwitz) in 1977, Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex (as Jocasta) in 1981, Mozart's La Clemenza di Tito (as Sesto) in 1984, and Handel's Giulio Cesare (as Cesare) in 1988. In her La Scala debut in 1977, she sang in Norma opposite Montserrat Caball\u00e9 in the first opera performance to be televised live throughout the world. ===Opera and concert repertoire=== Troyanos was known for her impassioned portrayals of everything from trouser roles to femmes fatales; \"the most boyish rose-bearer was also the most womanly Charlotte,\" wrote George Birnbaum in the Classical CD Scout.Birnbaum, George. \"Auger, Popp and Troyanos.\" Classical CD Scout, vol. 2, issue 3, May 1994. \"I'm lucky that I look like the roles I do, whether it's Octavian or Carmen or Kundry or Giulietta ... It's a flexible look and I'm a flexible actress. I must get ahold of a role or die\", Troyanos once said. Asked which mezzo type she'd rather play, \"somebody's mother or some guy\", Troyanos once quipped: \"I prefer the guys \u2014 but maybe a guy who also wears a beautiful dress from time to time.\"McLellan, Joseph. \"Tatiana Troyanos: Awakening the Arias\". Washington Post, February 28, 1987; accessed October 13, 2012. In Handel's Giulio Cesare, she sang both leading parts: Cleopatra (here essaying a soprano role, opposite Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau on Karl Richter's 1969 recording for Deutsche Grammophon), and the alto title role of Caesar (at the opera in San Francisco in 1982, Geneva in 1983, and at the Met in 1988). Other roles Troyanos sang on opera stages in the course of her career included * Cavalli's Diana (in La Calisto) * Gluck's Orfeo (in Orfeo ed Euridice) * Cimarosa's Elisetta (in Il matrimonio segreto) * Mozart's Cherubino (in Le nozze di Figaro) and Donna Elvira (in Don Giovanni) * Donizetti's Giovanna Seymour (in Anna Bolena) and Maffio Orsini (in Lucrezia Borgia) * Verdi's Amneris (in Aida) * Puccini's Suzuki (in Madama Butterfly) * Wagner's Venus ( in Tannh\u00e4user), Brang\u00e4ne (in Tristan und Isolde), Fricka (in Das Rheingold), Waltraute (in G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung), and Kundry (in Parsifal) * Humperdinck's Hansel (in Hansel and Gretel) * Richard Strauss's Clairon (in Capriccio) * Berlioz's Marguerite (in La damnation de Faust) * Saint-Sa\u00ebns' Dalila (in Samson and Delilah) and two roles she created, * Penderecki's Sister Jeanne (in The Devils of Loudun), Hamburg State Opera, 1969 * Glass's Queen Isabella (in The Voyage), Metropolitan Opera, 1992 Her singing was preserved in thirty-five live Metropolitan Opera broadcasts of complete operas (a number of which, including roles she never recorded in the studio \u2014 Princess Eboli, Giulietta, Brang\u00e4ne, Waltraute, Geschwitz \u2014 have been restored in recent years for the Met's satellite radio channel); she was also heard in broadcasts from San Francisco Opera (including Poppea and Caesar\u2014the latter was chosen as SFO's archival rebroadcast for 2016) and Lyric Opera of Chicago (including Romeo and the Rheingold Fricka). Eight more Met performances, plus a joint concert with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, were televised, as were Norma (opposite Joan Sutherland) at Canadian Opera Company, and the last production in which she appeared, Capriccio at San Francisco Opera. All these telecasts have been released in home video versions except for the Met's Die Fledermaus and Les contes d'Hoffmann, which are available from its streaming service, \"Opera on Demand\".; accessed July 15, 2015. Troyanos sang roles in concert performances of operas ranging from Ulysses in Handel's Deidamia (Washington, 1987) and Farnace in Mozart's Mitridate, re di Ponto (New York, 1992) to Sara in Donizetti's Roberto Devereux (London, 1970) and Judith in Bart\u00f3k's Bluebeard's Castle (in Hungarian, under Georg Solti, Pierre Boulez and Rafael Kubelik in Chicago, Cleveland, New York and London between 1972 and 1981). In 1984 she sang with the Philadelphia Orchestra in the world premiere, in English, of Act I of Rachmaninoff's opera Monna Vanna, which had been left in piano score by the composer and orchestrated by Igor Buketoff. Along with Monna Vanna, her performances of such pieces as Berlioz's Les nuits d'\u00e9t\u00e9 and Mahler's R\u00fcckert Songs and Das Lied von der Erde could be heard on radio broadcasts of major American orchestras. She was featured in Chicago Symphony broadcasts from the Ravinia Festival from 1980 to 1990, which included works like Beethoven's Missa Solemnis and Mahler's Das klagende Lied. She was active as a song recitalist (her first recital was at the Paris Opera in 1972.Siskind, Jacob. \"The 'ham and eggs' of the opera: The singer\", Montreal Gazette, March 3, 1973; accessed August 19, 2014. She made a Carnegie Hall recital debut in 1978), as well as in a series of duo recitals with the soprano Benita Valente which began after they co-starred in Ariodante at the Santa Fe Opera in 1987. Concert telecasts with Troyanos included Schoenberg's Gurre-Lieder with the Boston Symphony in 1979 and a recital with pianist Martin Katz, featuring Ravel's Sh\u00e9h\u00e9razade, Falla's Siete canciones populares espa\u00f1olas and songs by Berlioz and Mahler, at the Casals Festival in 1985. ==Audio and video discography== Troyanos enjoyed an equally versatile career as a recording artist; her first appearance as a soloist in a recording hall was as Dorabella, opposite Leontyne Price's Fiordiligi, in Mozart's Cos\u00ec fan tutte under Erich Leinsdorf (recorded in London in 1967, released in 1968, and winner of the Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording in 1969). She went on to sing Cherubino in Karl B\u00f6hm's recording of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, the title role in Bizet's Carmen for Sir Georg Solti (she was described in the Penguin classical record guide as \"quite simply the subtlest Carmen on record ... Troyanos' singing is delicately seductive too\"),March, Ivan, ed. The Complete Penguin Stereo Record and Cassette Guide. Penguin Books, 1984, p. 185. the Composer in Ariadne for both B\u00f6hm and Solti, Dido in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas for both Charles Mackerras and Raymond Leppard, and Anita in Leonard Bernstein's high-profile (if controversial) operatic recording of his West Side Story, among numerous other roles. David Anthony Fox in the St. James Opera Encyclopedia concluded that many of Troyanos's discs \"capture her faithfully \u2014 or ... as faithfully as is possible without her marvelous physical presence ... In fact, she never made a bad record, and\u2014artist that she was\u2014in every case Troyanos contributed something unique and memorable.\" These recordings were released commercially on LP and/or CD: * Bart\u00f3k, Bluebeard's Castle \u2013 Judith (Boulez, 1976, Columbia/Sony) * Beethoven, Symphony No. 9 (B\u00f6hm, 1970, DG) * Bellini, I Capuleti e i Montecchi \u2013 Romeo (Caldwell/Scott, live 1975, VAI) * Bellini, Norma \u2013 Adalgisa (Cillario, live 1975, Gala) * Bellini, Norma \u2013 Adalgisa (Levine, 1979, Columbia/Sony) * Bernstein, West Side Story \u2013 Anita (Bernstein, 1985, DG) * Bizet, Carmen (Solti, 1975, Decca/London) * Cavalieri, Rappresentatione di Anima, e di Corpo \u2013 Anima (Mackerras, 1970, DG Archiv) * Donizetti, Lucrezia Borgia \u2013 Orsini (Rescigno, live 1974, Melodram) * Handel, Giulio Cesare in Egitto \u2013 Cleopatra (Richter, 1969, DG) * Mahler, Symphony No. 2, \"Resurrection\" (Boulez, live 1973, Documents) * Mascagni, Cavalleria rusticana \u2013 Santuzza (Schermerhorn, live 1976, Gala) * Massenet, Werther \u2013 Charlotte (Plasson, 1979, EMI/Angel) * Mozart, Cos\u00ec fan tutte \u2013 Dorabella (Leinsdorf, 1967, RCA/BMG) * Mozart, Cos\u00ec fan tutte \u2013 Dorabella (Maag, live 1968, Mondo Musica) * Mozart, Die G\u00e4rtnerin aus Liebe (La Finta Giardiniera) \u2013 Ramiro (Schmidt-Isserstedt, 1972, Philips) * Mozart, Le nozze di Figaro \u2013 Cherubino (B\u00f6hm, 1968, DG) * Mozart, Le nozze di Figaro \u2013 Marcellina (Levine, 1990, DG) * Mozart, Missa Brevis in C, \"Sparrow Mass\" (Kubelik, 1973, DG) * Penderecki, Die Teufel von Loudun \u2013 Jeanne (Janowski, 1969, DG) * Purcell, Dido and Aeneas \u2013 Dido (Mackerras, 1967, DG Archiv) * Purcell, Dido and Aeneas \u2013 Dido (Leppard, 1977, Erato/Apex) * Scarlatti, A., Endimione e Cintia \u2013 Cintia (Lange, 1969, DG Archiv) * Schoenberg, Gurre-Lieder \u2013 Wood Dove (Ozawa, 1979, Philips) * Strauss, Ariadne auf Naxos \u2013 Composer (B\u00f6hm, live 1967, Melodram) * Strauss, Ariadne auf Naxos \u2013 Composer (B\u00f6hm, 1969, DG) * Strauss, Ariadne auf Naxos \u2013 Composer (Solti, 1977, Decca/London) * Strauss, Capriccio \u2013 Clairon (B\u00f6hm, 1971, DG) * Strauss, Der Rosenkavalier \u2013 Octavian (B\u00f6hm, live 1969, DG) * Stravinsky, Oedipus Rex \u2013 Jocasta (Abbado, live 1969, Opera d'Oro/Memories) * Stravinsky, Oedipus Rex \u2013 Jocasta (Bernstein, 1972, Columbia/Sony) * Wagner, G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung \u2013 Second Norn (Levine, 1989, DG) * Auger, Janowitz and Troyanos in Concert \u2013 Handel, Mozart, Strauss (Eichhorn, live 1968, Originals/Bella Voce) * Troyanos and Valente \u2013 Handel and Mozart, Arias & Duets (Rudel, 1991, MusicMasters/Musical Heritage) * A Salute to American Music, Richard Tucker Music Foundation Gala XVI \u2013 Copland, \"At the River\" (Conlon, 1991, RCA/BMG) * Tatiana Troyanos in Recital \u2013 Schumann, \"Frauenliebe und -leben\"; Rachmaninoff, Four Songs; Ravel, \"Five Greek Folksongs\"; Rossini, \"La Regata Veneziana\" (Levine, piano, live 1985, VAI, released 1999) There are DVDs of 10 complete operas featuring Troyanos: * Jeanne \u2013 Die Teufel von Loudun, Penderecki (Janowski, 1969) * Santuzza \u2013 Cavalleria rusticana, Mascagni (Levine, 1978) * Eboli \u2013 Don Carlo, Verdi (Levine, 1980) * Sesto \u2013 La Clemenza di Tito, Mozart (Levine, 1980) * Adalgisa \u2013 Norma, Bellini (Bonynge, 1981) * Octavian \u2013 Der Rosenkavalier, R.

She didn't talk about this.

Preparing Sesto herself years later, \"I went back to my Clemenza score and opened it up, and the smell of the paper reminded me of Tatiana. Isn't that weird? And seeing certain phrases, I can still hear her voice in my head. It's not that we were that close. But I was so impacted by her performance and the power of being on stage with her, that just looking at the score and remembering the Annio/Sesto duet, I can still hear that voice in my ear, the way she sang certain phrases of recit.\"\"Susan Graham on Working with Troyanos.\" Gramophone, Awards Issue, 2006. \"When I did my first Sesto ... there were certain phrases that I found myself singing just like she did, because it was in my ear that way,\" said Graham. \"I was never so inspired by a colleague on the stage as I was by Tatiana, because she just gave everything.\"Baker, David J. \"Living It Up in Operaworld\", Opera News, vol. 64, no. 7, January 2000; accessed June 4, 2017. Mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato confessed that during the time before the role of the Composer in Ariadne auf Naxos ultimately \"clicked\" for her, \"my preparation for Strauss's na\u00efve Komponist seemed to be way too slow. I had also been listening to the consummate artist, Tatiana Troyanos, a great deal, and I was thinking, 'I just can't do this role justice. I won't be ready. I just can't sing it like her.'\"Di Donato, Joyce. \"Happy New Year!\", joycedidonato.com, January 1, 2007, accessed December 2, 2016. ==Final season== Troyanos died on August 21, 1993, in New York, at the age of 54, of cancer. Nine years after her death, Opera News identified this as breast cancer, initially diagnosed in the mid-1980s and later in remission, which was found only in July 1993 to have metastasized to her liver. Her earlier cancer diagnosis had been undisclosed at the time; the Opera News article, by Eric Myers, now reported that \"through all her treatments, she valiantly, strenuously battled illness and nerves and kept most of her singing engagements.\" Troyanos is interred in Pinelawn Memorial Park, Long Island, New York. The year after her death, the Metropolitan Opera performed a concert in her memory; Music Director James Levine wrote, \"The idea that we are gathered here ... to pay memorial tribute to Tatiana Troyanos is incomprehensible. What it means, of course, is that our Metropolitan Opera family has lost one of the most important, beloved artists and friends in its entire history.\" Although described as \"an exceedingly private person offstage,\" Troyanos had become known increasingly to suffer from inner ear and sinus problems,\"Troyanos Ill, Won't Perform At Ucla\". Los Angeles Times, January 3, 1986, accessed September 5, 2015.Rockwell, John. \"Opera: 'Clemenza di Tito'\". The New York Times, October 25, 1984, accessed September 5, 2015. along with severe performance anxiety (Opera magazine said she was, \"by all reports, someone caught between a rock and a hard place: her stage fright was equalled only by her love of singing\").Kellow, Brian. \"High Anxiety\". Opera, vol. 53, no. 5, May 2002, accessed November 25, 2016. Her death, however, was unforeseen and \"came as a shock to the close-knit opera community,\" as Tim Page wrote at the time. \"Ms. Troyanos had kept her illness to herself and continued to perform almost to the end.\"Page, Tim. \"Opera Star Tatiana Troyanos, 54\", New York Newsday, August 1993. She had last sung at the Met\u2014the last of three performances of Waltraute (a role debut) to Gwyneth Jones' Br\u00fcnnhilde in Wagner's G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, conducted by Levine\u2014on May 1, 1993. That April and May, she also sang in Mahler's Third Symphony with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in both Boston and New York, one of three prominent singers who came to the rescue when the scheduled soloist withdrew from the series of concerts. \"Troyanos is still a profoundly immediate and expressive artist,\" wrote Richard Dyer in the Boston Globe, adding that \"hers was the most pliant and meaningful delivery and coloration of the text, the most beautiful, sophisticated and natural shaping of the musical line.\"Dyer, Richard. \"The Three Mezzos\". Boston Globe, April 29, 1993, accessed October 13, 2012. James Oestreich in The New York Times reported that \"Troyanos offered a searching, almost harrowing reading.\"Oestreich, James R. \"Classical Music in Review\". The New York Times, May 5, 1993, accessed October 13, 2012. Troyanos was scheduled to reprise the Mahler Third at Tanglewood in August, but her final stage appearances were in a somewhat lighter vein, as the actress Clairon in Richard Strauss' Capriccio at San Francisco Opera between June 12 and July 1, 1993. She had fallen ill during rehearsals but sang all the performances, and Joseph McLellan of the Washington Post recalled that the revival was \"highlighted not only by the radiant presence of Kiri Te Kanawa but by the deceptively robust performance of Tatiana Troyanos.\"McLellan, Joe. \"Richard Strauss\u2014Capriccio: Editorial Reviews\". Amazon.com, accessed October 13, 2012. Taking part in a Strauss symposium in San Francisco \"a short two months before she died, she was the most blooming and healthy-looking presence in the room,\" wrote Leighton Kerner in the Village Voice.Kerner, Leighton. \"Unfinished Song: Troyanos Memorials\", The Village Voice, May 3, 1994. Daniel Kessler observed that \"beneath the veneer of the casualness of her Clairon for San Francisco on those late 1993 Spring evenings, with each performance she gave, there was a conscious endeavor to build or perfect over what had gone before.\"Kessler, Daniel. \"Tatiana Troyanos: Reflections on an Operatic Career\" , page 4, accessed October 21, 2012. Troyanos last sang on the last day of her life, in Lenox Hill Hospital for other patients, one of whom \"told her that this was the first time in three years that she had completely forgotten her pain.\" ==References== ==Further reading== * Ames, Katrine. \"Mezzo Power.\" Newsweek, March 22, 1976. * Ardoin, John. \"The Private Side of a Prima Donna.\" The Dallas Morning News, November 12, 1988. * Colvin, Kathline. \"Tatiana Troyanos\u2014A Voice Which Dreams Are Made On.\" Music Journal, March\u2013April 1979. * Djerassi, Carl. \"What's Tatiana Troyanos Doing in Spartacus's Tent?\" The Futurist and Other Stories.
