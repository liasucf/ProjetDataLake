    "text": "Moana is a small town in the West Coast Region of the South Island of New Zealand. It is situated on the northern shore of Lake Brunner, and is beside the outflow of the lake into the Arnold River. There is a pedestrian suspension bridge crossing the Arnold from the town to access the lake shore across the river, with some short easy bush walks on each side. The town's main tourist attractions are the panoramic views and water sport opportunities arising from its position on the shores of Lake Brunner. The Midland Line railway passes through Moana; the TranzAlpine tourist passenger train passes through once in each direction daily, and freight trains of coal operate more frequently. The population of the Lake Brunner statistical area, which includes Moana but covers a much larger area, was 270 in the 2013 census, an increase of 9 from 2006. In May 2013, Moana became one of the first places in New Zealand to get 4G wireless broadband. ==Education== Lake Brunner School is a coeducational full primary (years 1-8) school with a decile rating of 6 and a roll of 55.
