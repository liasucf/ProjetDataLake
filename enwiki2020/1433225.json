In 2006, he transferred to West Ham United, making the same number of appearances in a six-year spell in which he was their Player of the Year in 2008 and won promotion via the Championship play-offs in 2012. He then moved on a free transfer to Queens Park Rangers, winning the play-offs again in 2014. In July 2016, Green joined Leeds United on a one-year contract. He later joined Huddersfield Town and Chelsea for one year each before retiring in 2019. Green represented England at under-16, under-18 and B level. He made his debut for the full England squad in 2005. Green was cut from England's 2006 FIFA World Cup squad due to injury but featured in the 2010 edition, in which he started the competition as England's first choice goalkeeper but was dropped after an error cost England a win against the United States.

The first-choice goalkeeper since 1997-1998 remained Andy Marshall -- on Marshall's departure in the summer of 2001 Green was able to establish himself as first choice goalkeeper for Norwich. He was a star of the 2001\u201302 season play-off campaign which culminated in a final loss to Birmingham City on penalties. By 2003, Green was a key figure in the Norwich team.

Norwich were relegated into the Championship the following season. Green kept just 6 clean sheets and conceded 77 goals during the Premier League season despite many excellent individual performances.

Green missed the last few matches of 2005\u201306 after he sustained an injury in the warm-up prior to the away fixture against Sheffield Wednesday. In August 2006, Norwich accepted a bid of up to \u00a32 million from West Ham United for Green. ===West Ham United=== Green playing for West Ham United in 2006 Green signed a four-year deal with West Ham United, where he teamed up with former Norwich striker, Dean Ashton who had been sold to West Ham in January 2006.

On 19 March 2011, Green made a world-class save against Gareth Bale's free kick in the 0\u20130 draw with Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane. He was named Hammer of the Year as runner-up to Scott Parker. Green was sent off for the first time in his club career against Blackpool on 21 February 2012. West Ham, who had not named a substitute goalkeeper in their squad for the match, were forced to play the remainder of the second-half with midfielder Henri Lansbury in goal. They eventually won 4\u20131. West Ham later won an appeal against the red card leaving Green available to play in their next match.

Green played only two more matches for QPR before manager Mark Hughes signed Brazilian international J\u00falio C\u00e9sar; although Green played the next match against Manchester City, this was only because J\u00falio C\u00e9sar's work permit was not complete and the Brazilian started the following match, against Chelsea on 15 September 2012. After the sacking of Hughes, new manager Harry Redknapp replaced Julio C\u00e9sar with Green at half time during his first match in charge, against Sunderland on 27 November 2012. Green then went on to play the next five matches. before being once again relegated to the bench for most of the next 4 months, only starting three matches between 26 December and 20 April, two FA Cup matches in January then coming on when J\u00falio C\u00e9sar was injured in the victory over Southampton and playing the following match as the Brazilian recovered. Redknapp said following Green's third successive start in the loss to Arsenal that for the remainder of the season he \"want[s] to play Rob Green\" and that Green \"will probably be [his] goalkeeper next season\", as he expected J\u00falio C\u00e9sar to be sold over the summer. At the start of 2013\u201314, Green was named as first choice goalkeeper for the opening matches of the season. Green was a member of the QPR team that won the 2014 Championship play-off Final, 1\u20130 against Derby County at Wembley Stadium on 24 May 2014.

Earlier in the season, on 26 December, he saved an early penalty in an eventual 2\u20131 loss to Arsenal, as his teammate Eduardo Vargas pointed out which way fellow Chilean Alexis S\u00e1nchez was likely to shoot. After starting 2015\u201316 as QPR's first choice goalkeeper, Green was frozen out the starting line-up one match after the arrival of new manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink due to a clause in his contract triggering a contract extension if he played 30 Championship matches.

On 17 December 2016, Green kept his 8th League clean sheet for Leeds, this equalled the tally already for Leeds' clean sheet for the whole of the previous 2015/16 season with goalkeeper predecessor Marco Silvestri. On 25 January 2017, Green kept his 6th consecutive clean sheet for home matches at Elland Road in a 2\u20130 win over Nottingham Forest.
