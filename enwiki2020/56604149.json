    "text": "Ganar la Regi\u00f3n de Murcia (Spanish for Winning the Region of Murcia) was an electoral alliance formed by United Left\u2013Greens of the Region of Murcia and Building the Left\u2013Socialist Alternative to contest the 2015 Murcian regional election. While the alliance had been intended as a \"confluence\" for left-wing political forces in the region, both Podemos and Equo refused to join it. On 17 March 2015, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Pujante was elected as the alliance's leading candidate for the regional election. The alliance failed to secure any parliamentary seats in the 24 May election. ==Member parties== *United Left\u2013Greens of the Region of Murcia (IU\u2013V\u2013RM) *Building the Left\u2013Socialist Alternative (CLI\u2013AS) ==Electoral performance== ===Regional Assembly of Murcia=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:98%;\" |- ! width=\"65\" rowspan=\"2\"| Date ! colspan=\"3\"| Votes ! colspan=\"2\"| Seats ! rowspan=\"2\"| Status ! rowspan=\"2\"| Size |- ! width=\"75\"| # ! % ! \u00b1pp ! # ! \u00b1 |- ! 2015 | 30,761 | 4.8% | \u20133.0 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 10px1 | style=\"background:#ddd;\"| N/A | 5th |} ==References== Category:Political parties in the Region of Murcia Category:Political parties established in 2015 Category:Defunct political party alliances in Spain ",
