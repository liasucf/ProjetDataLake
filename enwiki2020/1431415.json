Her brother is Adil Khan, a screen and theater actor. ===Music training and early career=== Khan started her career as a music artist, a singer and stage performer in the public eye in Norway from the age of 7. At first she was a singer and performer of traditional South Asian classical and folk music, then became a composer and producer of world music. Khan's father was a music enthusiast and in 1984 placed his seven-year-old daughter under the supervision of Ustad Bade Fateh Ali Khan. Deeyah studied Pakistani and North Indian classical forms of music under him. At the age of eight, Deeyah made her first performance on national television appearing on the primetime show Halv Sju, then performed at festivals. Deeyah was also the member of NRK girls choir as well receiving some music lessons with African American soprano Anne Brown. She also spent several years receiving further musical training from Ustad Sultan Khan. Because music is considered to be a dishonourable profession for women in many Muslim communities Khan faced severe abuse and death threats for several years in Norway. Initially the harassment and condemnation were directed towards her parents: \"I remember my dad having to defend the fact that I was doing music, even as a child. I remember this at eight, nine years old where ... various people come to the house and say, 'We don't even let our sons do it, why would you let your daughter do this?'\". Despite the increased pressure and threats of violence Khan's family continued to support her. After being attacked on stage at her own concert and sustained intimidation, she subsequently moved to London at the age of 17 to live and work. She continued to compose and produce music. She recorded her last CD Ataraxis as a vocalist in 2006 which featured jazz pianist Bob James, Police guitarist Andy Summers and Norwegian trumpeter Nils Petter Molv\u00e6r. Khan has continued to work in the music industry as a music producer including creating platforms for musicians and artists who are persecuted or discriminated against for their creative expression. ==Discography== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\" width=\"10\"|Year !align=\"center\" width=\"140\"|Title !align=\"center\" width=\"40\"|Type !align=\"center\" width=\"140\"|Notes |- |1992 ||I alt slags lys || Album || |- |1995 || \"Get Off My Back\" || Single || |- |1995 || \"History\" || Single || |- |1995 || \"Color of My Dreams\" || Single || |- |1996 || Deepika || Album || |- |2005 || \"Plan of My Own\" / \"I Saw You\" || Single || UK peak: #37 |- |2007 || Ataraxis || Album || |- |2010 || Listen to the Banned || Compilation album || It features banned, persecuted and imprisoned artists from Africa, The Middle East and Asia.
