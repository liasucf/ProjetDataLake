    "text": "Zeta Hydrae (\u03b6 Hya, \u03b6 Hydrae) is a solitary star in the equatorial constellation of Hydra. This is a generally faint constellation, so, at an apparent visual magnitude of +3.10, this is the third-brightest member after Alphard and Gamma Hydrae. ==Distance== The distance to this star has been measured using the parallax technique, yielding a value of roughly . At this distance, the visual magnitude of the star is diminished by 0.03 as a result of extinction from intervening gas and dust. Delta Hydrae is about from Zeta Hydrae and may be a largely co-moving object. The star has one of the lower- error margin readings among those of the Gaia spacecraft which computes a parallax of 20.7182 \u00b1 0.3925 mas and, if correct, a distance of 157 \u00b1 3 light years. ==Characteristics== With a stellar classification of G9 II-III, this is an evolved giant star that is radiating 132 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 4,925 K. At this heat, the star glows with the yellow hue of a G-type star. The radius of this star, as measured using interferometry, is about 18 times the Sun's radius. It has an estimated 4.2 times the mass of the Sun and is around old. ==Name and etymology== This star, along with \u03b4 Hya (Lisan al Sudja), \u03b5 Hya, \u03b7 Hya, \u03c1 Hya and \u03c3 Hya (Minchir), were Ulug Beg's Min al Az\u02bdal, \"Belonging to the Uninhabited Spot\". According to the catalogue of stars in the Technical Memorandum 33-507 - A Reduced Star Catalog Containing 537 Named Stars, Min al Az\u02bdal or Minazal were the title for five stars:\u03b4 Hya as Minazal I, \u03b7 Hya as Minazal II, \u03b5 Hya as Minazal III, \u03c1 Hya as Minazal IV and \u03b6 Hya as Minazal V (exclude \u03c3 Hya). In Chinese, (), meaning Willow, refers to an asterism consisting of \u03b6 Hydrae, \u03b4 Hydra, \u03c3 Hydrae, \u03b7 Hydrae, \u03c1 Hydrae, \u03b5 Hydrae, \u03c9 Hydrae and \u03b8 Hydrae \u4e2d\u570b\u661f\u5ea7\u795e\u8a71, written by \u9673\u4e45\u91d1.
