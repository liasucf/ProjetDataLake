From 1950 he was a writer of technical stories in Popular Photography magazine and for many years produced a regular column for the magazine.Popular Photography, June 1956, Vol. 38, No. 6Fondiller, H. V. (Ed.). (1979). The Best of Popular Photography. Watson-Guptill Publications. He became known as Mr. Leica, an expert on camera equipment, having worked for the manufacturer of E.Leitz GmbH in Wetzlar in their public relations and product design departments for nearly 7 years, and as a European correspondent, before returning to write for Popular Photography. ==Recognition== Two of Schwalberg\u2019s photographs were included by curator Edward Steichen in the world-touring The Family of Man exhibition, seen by 9 million viewers. In one, two women spectators at a sports event, photographed at close range, scream ecstatically while the surrounding men remain unmoved. The second, a policeman photographed from above and panned at a slow shutter speed as he walked, shows only his dark uniform against the slightly blurred pavement in an abstract representation of the presence of the law. ==Death and legacy== Schwalberg died a few days before his 69th birthday and was remembered at a memorial on March 4, 1997, at the Metropolitan Center, 123 West 18th Street, New York City. ==References== Category:1927 births Category:1996 deaths Category:20th-century American photographers Category:American photojournalists Category:Place of birth missing Category:Place of death missing ",
