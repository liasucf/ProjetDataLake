She was a guardian of Akamatsu Yoshimura. After Yoshimura's death, T\u014dsh\u014din took total control of the clan as the leader in 1521. * Jukei-ni: She acted as guardian and adviser to Ujiteru, Yoshimoto and her grandson Imagawa Ujizane. She has spent four generations of daimyos and it is said that she was de facto the last Sengoku daimyo of the Imagawa clan. * Ikeda Sen: T\u014ddaiki (\u5f53\u4ee3\u8a18) describes that she owned lands with a revenue equivalent to 10,000 koku, like a minor daimyo. *Myorin: Lu\u00eds Fr\u00f3is describes that a woman was the ruler of an area that is currently the \u014cita city, that woman was probably Myorin. Her son inherits the clan leadership after the death of Yoshioka Akioki. Because he is very young, Myorin becomes the representative head of Tsurusaki castle as a counselor for her son. Cases like these were common in all of Japanese history. *Yodo-dono: She formally received Yodo Castle in 1589. After Hideyoshi's death, she acted as guardian of his heir Toyotomi Hideyori. Following the fall of the Council of Five Elders that resulted in the Battle of Sekigahara, Yodo-dono becomes the chief representative of the Toyotomi clan and Osaka Castle. *Lady Nata: In Otomo Family Document (\u5927\u53cb\u5bb6\u6587\u66f8\u9332) , it is described that she owned lands on the Kunisaki Peninsula, an area run by her family, the Nata clan. *Fujishiro Gozen: She was the female castellan of a minor castle, the Fujishiro-kan (\u85e4\u4ee3\u9928) in Mutsu Province. == Notes == == See also == * Onna-bugeisha * Kunoichi * Empress of Japan == References == * Category:Castellans C * * * * ",
