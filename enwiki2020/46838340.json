    "text": "The 2009\u201310 National League 2 South was the first season (23rd overall) of the fourth tier (south) of the English domestic rugby union competitions since the professionalised format of the second division was introduced. Previously known as National Division 3 South, it had been renamed due to widespread changes to the league system by the RFU with National One becoming the Championship, National 2 becoming National 1 and so on. The league system was 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw and additional bonus points being awarded for scoring 4 or more tries and/or losing within 7 points of the victorious team. In terms of promotion the league champions would go straight up into National League 1 while the runners up would have a one-game playoff against the runners up from National League 2 North (at the home ground of the club with the superior league record) for the final promotion place. A further change to the league system would see the division increase from 14 to 15 teams (this was originally supposed to be 16 teams but one of the teams relegated from the 2008-09 National Division 2, Mounts Bay, folded at the beginning of the season). Barking would finish as champions with only two league defeats all season, while runners up Rosslyn Park would join them in the 2010\u201311 National League 1 by defeating 2009\u201310 National League 2 North runners up Loughborough Students in the National 2 promotion playoff. At the bottom of the table Bridgwater & Albion and newly promoted Barnes would be condemned to National League 3 South West and National League 3 London & SE respectively. ==Participating teams== Eleven of the teams listed below participated in the 2008-09 National League 3 South season; Westcombe Park were relegated from the 2008-09 National Division 2, while Clifton were promoted as champions of South West Division 1 with Shelford (champions) and Barnes (playoffs) coming up from London Division 1. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !width=25%|Team !width=25%|Stadium !width=25%|Capacity !width=25%|City/Area |- | Barking | Goresbrook | 1,000 | Barking, London |- |Barnes |Barn Elms | |Barnes, London |- |Bridgwater & Albion |Bath Road |5,000 |Bridgwater, Somerset |- |Canterbury |Merton Lane |1,075 (75 seats) |Canterbury, Kent |- |Clifton |Station Road |2,500 (400 seats) |Clifton, Bristol |- |Dings Crusaders |Landseer Avenue |1,500 |Lockleaze, Bristol |- |Ealing Trailfinders |Trailfinders Sports Ground |3,020 |Ealing, London |- |Henley Hawks |Dry Leas |4,000 |Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire |- |Lydney |Regentsholme |1,500 |Lydney, Gloucestershire |- |Richmond |Athletic Ground |4,500 |Richmond, London |- |Rosslyn Park |The Rock |2,000 |Roehampton, London |- |Shelford |The Davey Field |2,000 (150 seats) |Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire |- |Southend |Warners Bridge Park | |Southend, Essex |- |Westcombe Park |Goddington Dene |3,200 |Orpington, London |- |Worthing Raiders |Roundstone Lane |1,500 (100 seats) |Angmering, West Sussex |- |} ==League table== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- |colspan=\"15\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"|2009\u201310 National League 2 South table |- |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"| |style=\"background- color:#efefef;\" width=\"195\"|Club |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Played |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Won |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Drawn |style=\"background- color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Lost |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points For |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points Against |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Points Difference |style=\"background-color:#efefef;\" width=\"20\"|Bonus Points |style=\"background- color:#efefef;\" width=\"60\"|Points |-style=\"background-color:#d8ffeb;text- align:center;\" | 1 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Barking (C) || 28 || 26 || 0 || 2 || 1060 || 335 || 725 || 20 || 124 |- style=\"background-color:#ccccff;\" | 2 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Rosslyn Park (P) || 28 || 23 || 1 || 4 || 995 || 423 || 572 || 19 || 113 |- | 3 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Ealing Trailfinders || 28 || 22 || 1 || 5 || 1014 || 504 || 510 || 23 || 113 |- | 4 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Southend || 28 || 19 || 1 || 8 || 802 || 566 || 236 || 17 || 95 |- | 5 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Clifton || 28 || 18 || 2 || 8 || 682 || 571 || 111 || 15 || 91 |- | 6 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Worthing Raiders || 28 || 16 || 1 || 11 || 653 || 561 || 92 || 9 || 75 |- | 7 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Canterbury || 28 || 13 || 1 || 14 || 625 || 780 || -155 || 13 || 67 |- | 8 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Richmond || 28 || 11 || 0 || 17 || 706 || 761 || -55 || 18 || 62 |- | 9 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Henley Hawks || 28 || 11 || 1 || 16 || 668 || 598 || 70 || 10 || 56 |- | 10 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Shelford || 27 || 11 || 1 || 15 || 550 || 778 || -228 || 7 || 53 |- | 11 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Dings Crusaders || 28 || 9 || 2 || 17 || 549 || 697 || -148 || 13 || 53 |- | 12 || style=\"text- align:left;\" | Lydney || 28 || 8 || 0 || 20 || 580 || 807 || -227 || 8 || 40 |- | 13 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Westcombe Park || 27 || 8 || 0 || 19 || 434 || 832 || -398 || 7 || 39 |- style=\"background-color:#ffcccc;\" | 14 || style=\"text-align:left;\" | Barnes (R) || 28 || 6 || 1 || 21 || 486 || 916 || -430 || 5 || 31 |- style=\"background-color:#ffcccc;\" | 15 || style=\"text- align:left;\" | Bridgwater & Albion (R) || 28 || 2 || 0 || 26 || 321 || 996 || -675 || 0 || 8 |- |colspan=\"15\"| *If teams are level at any stage, tiebreakers are applied in the following order: # Number of matches won # Difference between points for and against # Total number of points for # Aggregate number of points scored in matches between tied teams # Number of matches won excluding the first match, then the second and so on until the tie is settled |- |colspan=\"15\" style=\"border:0px\"| Green background is the promotion place.
