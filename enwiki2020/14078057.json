    "text": "George of the Jungle and the Search for the Secret (George of the Jungle in PAL regions) is a platform video game based on the animated television program George of the Jungle. ==Gameplay== The game is in 3D but plays like a 2D side scrolling platformer game with 3D turns and camera angles in the environment and the path that George walks on. There are a total of 6 levels; 2 with a jungle theme, 2 with a swamp theme, and 2 with temple theme. All 6 levels are made to look like the cartoon series (the 2007 remake, not the original 1960s version). Not once in the game do they specify what the secret actually is. ==Reception== The game received \"generally unfavorable reviews\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN criticized the Wii and Nintendo DS versions for its poor collision detection and how it mocks the player with doors that lead into the background where the player can't do anything. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2008 video games Category:Cartoon Network video games Category:George of the Jungle Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Video games based on animated television series Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Wii games ",
