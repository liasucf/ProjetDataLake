On the date of the publication of the dictionary on November 5 (authored by the Alliance's president), the local and international Roma community celebrated the World Day of Romani Language. The Croatian Parliament formally recognized Romani Language Day on May 25, 2012. In 2015 UNESCO accepted the alliance's initiative to recognize the Romani language as a part of global cultural heritage by recognizing the World Day of Romani Language. The formal proposal to UNESCO was made by the Republic of Croatia.
