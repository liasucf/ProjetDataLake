In addition to participating in the contest, the Ukrainian broadcaster National Television Company of Ukraine (NTU) also hosted the Eurovision Song Contest at the International Exhibition Centre in Kyiv after winning the competition in with the song \"1944\" performed by Jamala. The Ukrainian entry for the 2017 contest was selected through a national final, which NTU organised in collaboration with the commercial broadcaster STB. == Background == Prior to the 2017 Contest, Ukraine had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest thirteen times since its first entry in . The nation had won the contest on two occasions: in with the song \"Wild Dances\" performed by Ruslana and in with the song \"1944\" performed by Jamala. Following the introduction of semi-finals for the , Ukraine had managed to qualify to the final in every contest they participated in thus far. Ukraine had been the runner-up in the contest on two occasions: in with the song \"Dancing Lasha Tumbai\" performed by Verka Serduchka and in with the song \"Shady Lady\" performed by Ani Lorak. Ukraine's least successful result had been 19th place, which they achieved during the , with the song \"Razom nas bahato\" performed by GreenJolly. The Ukrainian national broadcaster, National Television Company of Ukraine (NTU), broadcasts the event within Ukraine and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. In the past, NTU had alternated between both internal selections and national finals in order to select the Ukrainian entry. Between 2011 and 2014, NTU had set up national finals with several artists to choose both the song and performer to compete at Eurovision for Ukraine, with both the public and a panel of jury members involved in the selection. NTU withdrew from the contest for one year in due to the unstable financial and political situation caused by the conflict in east Ukraine. In 2016, NTU collaborated with the commercial broadcaster STB in order to organise a national final to select Ukraine's entry, resulting in the selection of an entry that went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest. NTU's collaboration with STB continued in 2017. ==Before Eurovision== === National final === The Ukrainian national final took place in February 2017 in Kyiv. The selection was a joint production between the Ukrainian national broadcaster NTU and commercial broadcaster STB.
