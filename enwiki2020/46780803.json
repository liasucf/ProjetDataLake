These were All-Russian Society of Philatelists (created in 1922) and Philatelic International (or Filintern organised in 1924).

He also supervised another state body, Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily. The All-Union Philatelic Association ceased to exist soon after. It lacked a published decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) and RSFSR Sovnarkom. On 25 October 1926, a new association was established in Moscow by VTsIK and Sovnarkom decree. It replaced the Organisation of the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily. SFA sold Soviet stamps to foreign dealers, Soviet philatelists, and schoolboys. These latter glued their stamps into school notebooks because of a lack of stamp albums. The SFA organ was the journal Sovetskii Filatelist (Soviet Philatelist). In 1938, the Soviet Philatelic Association was replaced with the Chief Philatelic Bureau. == See also == == References == == Further reading == * Archived from the original and another source on 2015-05-15. == External links == * Category:Philately of the Soviet Union Category:Government agencies of Russia Category:1926 establishments in the Soviet Union Category:Philatelic organizations Category:Defunct organizations based in Russia Category:Organizations established in 1926 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1938 ",
