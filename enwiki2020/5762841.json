    "text": "\"You\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released as the opening track of his 1975 album Extra Texture (Read All About It). It was also the album's lead single, becoming a top 20 hit in America and reaching number 9 in Canada. A 45-second instrumental portion of the song, titled \"A Bit More of You\", appears on Extra Texture also, opening side two of the original LP format. Harrison wrote \"You\" in 1970 as a song for Ronnie Spector, formerly of the Ronettes, and wife of Harrison's All Things Must Pass co-producer Phil Spector. The composition reflects Harrison's admiration for 1960s American soul/R&B;, particularly Motown. In February 1971, Ronnie Spector recorded \"You\" in London for a proposed solo album on the Beatles' Apple record label, but the recording remained unissued. Four years later, Harrison returned to this backing track while making his final album for Apple Records, in Los Angeles. The released recording features the 1971 contributions from Leon Russell, Jim Gordon and others, with further instrumentation and vocals overdubbed in 1975, notably a series of saxophone solos by Jim Horn. On release, the song was well received by the majority of music critics, who viewed it as a return to form for Harrison after his disappointing 1974 North American tour and the accompanying Dark Horse album. Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone hailed it as Harrison's best work since his 1970\u201371 hit song \"My Sweet Lord\"; author Ian Inglis describes \"You\" as \"a near-perfect pop song\". Capitol Records included \"You\" as one of just six Harrison solo hits, alongside compositions of his performed with the Beatles, on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison. For the first time since the debut CD release of Extra Texture in the early 1990s, \"You\" was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of Harrison's 2014 Apple Years reissues. ==Background and composition== George Harrison's admiration for American soul/R&B; acts dated back to the early 1960s, to singles by Doris Troy, Marvin Gaye, Mary Wells and others.Clayson, pp. 170\u201371. A similar influence on him and his fellow Beatles was that era's girl group sound, as reflected in the band's choice of cover versions during 1962\u201363.MadDonald, pp. 65\u201366, 79, 81. In 1969, while producing Billy Preston's debut album on Apple Records,\"Doris Troy\", Apple Records (retrieved 25 March 2013). Harrison worked with Doris Troy in London and signed her to the label as a recording artist, songwriter and producer.Leng, pp. 60\u201361. Another of his favourite female vocalists was Ronnie SpectorKevin Howlett's liner notes, Living in the Material World CD booklet (EMI Records, 2006; produced by Dhani Harrison & Olivia Harrison), p. 7. \u2013 formerly known as Veronica Bennett,Clayson, p. 100. lead singer of girl group the Ronettes until 1967, and latterly married to American producer Phil Spector.Leng, p. 105. After co-producing Harrison's All Things Must Pass triple album in 1970, following the break-up of the Beatles,Rodriguez, p. 41. Spector was granted an unofficial role as head of A&R; for Apple Records,Williams, p. 159. and had previously insisted that his wife record for the label.Spizer, p. 342. That year, Harrison wrote the soul-inspired \"You\" as what he later termed \"a Ronettes sort of song\", specifically for Ronnie Spector.Harrison, p. 218. The main lyrics \u2013 \"I ... love ... you\" and \"You ... love ... me\", in verses one and two, respectivelyHarrison, p. 219. \u2013 make it one of Harrison's simplest compositions.Clayson, p. 349.Huntley, p. 123. Author Ian Inglis comments that Harrison's lyrics here recall the Beatles' use of personal pronouns in songs such as \"Love Me Do\", \"From Me to You\" and \"She Loves You\" to effectively \"include the listener in the song's narrative\".Inglis, p. 50. A deviation from these lines occurs only with the repeated bridges:Harrison, pp 217, 219. Harrison musical biographer Simon Leng notes the importance of soul music in Harrison's solo career during the 1970s and views \"You\" as a song that most obviously demonstrates the influence of Motown on its composer.Leng, pp. 70\u201371, 180. Inglis suggests that Harrison's former Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney adopted part of the melody of \"You\" for his 1976 hit single with Wings, \"Silly Love Songs\". ==Recording== ===1971 basic track=== According to Leng, Harrison taped demos of \"You\" during the lengthy recording sessions for All Things Must Pass.Leng, p. 180. The sessions for a proposed Ronnie Spector solo albumHuntley, p. 65. began at London's Abbey Road Studios on 2 February 1971,Badman, p. 25. with Harrison and Phil Spector again co-producing and Phil McDonald as recording engineer.Madinger & Easter, pp. 434, 452. Ronnie Spector, pictured in 1971 Since the Ronettes' break-up in early 1967, Ronnie Spector had worked only sporadically,Spector, pp. 183\u201384. and she later claimed to have been a virtual prisoner in her husband's 23-room Los Angeles mansion during this period.Romanowski & George-Warren, pp. 850, 934.Cameron Matthews, \"Ronnie Spector Remembers Amy Winehouse, Reveals She Went to Rehab to Escape from Phil Spector\", Spinner, 2 August 2011 (archived version retrieved 30 October 2013). She flew in from California for the sessions,Huntley, p. 64. which featured three musicians who had been part of the so-called \"blue-eyed soul school\" of the late 1960s, via their association with Delaney & Bonnie:Clayson, p. 274. multi-instrumentalist Leon Russell on piano, Jim Gordon on drums, and Carl Radle on bass.Madinger & Easter, p. 434. In addition to Harrison, who supplied guitar, another participant was Gary Wright, on keyboards, reprising his role on All Things Must Pass.Huntley, pp. 52, 64. For two days,Badman, pp. 25\u201326. this group of musicians taped the basic tracks for \"You\" and five other songs written or co-written by Harrison, with Ronnie Spector recording guide vocals only. The sessions then \"broke down\", according to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, due to \"Phil's health issues\", which had similarly interrupted the recording of All Things Must Pass in 1970.Madinger & Easter, pp. 427, 434. Despite the fact that \"You\" was tailor-made for his wife, Phil Spector opted not to issue the song as her comeback single; he had likewise held back recordings by the Ronettes and the Crystals,Spector, pp. 55, 113, 114. another act signed to his label, Philles Records, in the 1960s.Bruce Eder, \"The Crystals: Biography\", AllMusic (retrieved 27 March 2013). With the solo-album plan abruptly abandoned, another Harrison original from the sessions, \"Try Some, Buy Some\", was completed and selected for release as a Ronnie Spector single on Apple.Phil Symes, \"Ronnie Tries it Solo\", Disc and Music Echo, 8 May 1971; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). A minor hit in America only, that song's disappointing commercial reception led to the cancellation of a second single, which was to be \"You\".Schaffner, p. 160.Clayson, p. 281. ===1975 overdubs=== Four years after the Abbey Road sessions, Harrison revisited \"You\" while completing his final album for Apple Records, the soul-influenced Extra Texture (Read All About It),Leng, pp. 178, 186. at A&M; Studios in Los Angeles.Madinger & Easter, pp. 451\u201352.Spizer, p. 271. His standing with music critics had recently plummeted following a North American tour with Ravi Shankar in November\u2013December 1974 and his accompanying album, Dark Horse.Rodriguez, p. 64.The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 44, 46. These two projects had been marred by Harrison's laryngitis-ravaged singing voice;Lavezzoli, pp. 195\u201396.Madinger & Easter, pp. 442\u201343. in addition, a number of concert reviewers had condemned Harrison for refusing to indulge the public's nostalgia for the Beatles, and for his on-stage spiritual pronouncements.Schaffner, pp. 177\u201378.Tillery, pp. 114\u201315. Looking to rehabilitate himself with critics and his audience in early 1975,Woffinden, p. 86. Harrison had what author Robert Rodriguez describes as \"at least one ace in the commercial hole ... the Motown-esque 'You'\".Rodriguez, pp. 248, 280. Harrison recorded his own lead vocal onto the 1971 basic track, as he had done earlier with \"Try Some, Buy Some\", for Living in the Material World (1973).Leng, pp. 133\u201334, 180.Kevin Howlett's liner notes, Extra Texture (Read All About It) CD booklet (Apple Records, 2014; produced by George Harrison), p. 4. On 31 May 1975, further overdubs were carried out on \"You\", comprising a second drum part, by Jim Keltner; tenor sax solos from Jim Horn; and ambient keyboards, played by David Foster.Spizer, p. 275. Harrison said that Horn's saxophone playing on the track was \"one of the nicest rock-n-roll sounds I've heard in years\". The overdubs added to the song's radio-friendly qualities, particularly through the use of ARP String Synthesizer,Rodriguez, p. 248. but Madinger and Easter note that Keltner's drum part, which is higher in the mix than Gordon's and was played in half-time, produces an effect whereby the song's tempo appears to be slower than on the 1971 recording. With a significant amount of post-production work having been carried out in Los Angeles, Spector did not receive a co-producer's credit for \"You\" as he had for Harrison's version of \"Try Some, Buy Some\".Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 125, 369. In September 1975 Harrison told BBC Radio 1's Paul Gambaccini that it was \"such a good backing track\" originally, yet he had forgotten about its existence until coming across the tape years later.George Harrison interview, Rockweek, (retrieved 1 July 2012).Badman, p. 165. In a 1987 interview, Harrison acknowledged the difficulty he had in singing the song in so high a key;Timothy White, \"George Harrison: Reconsidered\", Musician, November 1987, p. 53. \"it was recorded in Ronnie's register,\" he explains in his 1980 autobiography, \"a bit high for me.\" Although Ronnie Spector's name did not appear in the album credits,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 376. snippets of her 1971 guide vocal remain on Harrison's released recording.Leng, p. 180fn. Spector's voice can be heard intermittently from the two-minute mark onwards,Madinger & Easter, p. 452. with her signature \"woh oh-oh oh-oh\"s audible during the song's playout. ==Release== An upbeat pop song in a similar vein to Harrison's 1971 hit \"What Is Life\", \"You\" was the most obvious choice for a single off Extra Texture. It was released in advance of the album, backed by \"World of Stone\", on 12 September 1975 in Britain (as Apple R 6007) and three days later in the United States (as Apple 1884).Castleman & Podrazik, p. 369.Madinger & Easter, pp. 632, 633. The picture sleeve in Britain featured a photo of a smiling Harrison taken on stage by 1974 tour photographer Henry Grossman; the US picture sleeve incorporated Roy Kohara's humorous design for the album, showing blue lettering on a vivid orange background.Spizer, pp. 271, 272. In another example of the upbeat mood that was otherwise lacking in the musical content of Extra Texture,Rodriguez, p. 184.Doggett, p. 238. the single's face labels showed the familiar Apple Records logo as an apple core, a pun on the demise of the company.Spizer, pp. 271, 275. In the UK, where Harrison had undertaken promotional activities for the first time for Extra Texture,Ray Coleman, \"Dark Horse\", Melody Maker, 6 September 1975, p. 28.Hunt, p. 101. \"You\" was Radio 1's Record of the Week,Badman, p. 169. guaranteeing it substantial airplay. The song peaked no higher than Harrison's previous hit there, \"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\", at number 38, however. As with his Dark Horse singles, \"You\" performed better in America,Huntley, pp. 122, 123. where it held the number 20 position for two weeks on the Billboard Hot 100.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 355. On the US charts compiled by Cash Box and Record World, the single peaked at number 19 and number 39, respectively. The song served as both the opener for Extra Texture as well as, in the form of a 45-second instrumental portion titled \"A Bit More of You\", the first track on side two of the original LP.Huntley, p. 125.Spizer, pp. 273, 274. Harrison biographer Dale Allison dismisses this reprise with the words \"It's filler\",Allison, p. 137. while Leng suggests its purpose was to \"fashion a soul mood\" for the song that follows, the pop-soul ballad \"Can't Stop Thinking About You\".Leng, p. 184. The full version of \"You\" appears on the 1976 compilation The Best of George Harrison as one of only six selections from Harrison's solo career up to the end of 1975.Inglis, p. 65. Having last been remastered for the 1991\u201392 CD release of Extra Texture,Badman, p. 473. the song was remastered for inclusion on Harrison's Apple Years 1968\u201375 reissues, released in September 2014.Joe Marchese, \"Give Me Love: George Harrison\u2019s 'Apple Years' Are Collected On New Box Set\", The Second Disc, 2 September 2014 (retrieved 27 September 2014).Hal Horowitz, \"George Harrison: The Apple Years, 1968\u201375\", American Songwriter, 23 September 2014 (retrieved 28 September 2014). ==Critical reception== ===Contemporary reviews=== After the so-called \"Dark Hoarse\" debacle in 1974,Woffinden, pp. 83\u201385. and with his singing voice now healed, music critics viewed \"You\" as a return to form for Harrison.Huntley, p. 122. The tone of the song suggested that, in the words of Robert Rodriguez, \"the irritable, gravel-voiced mystic on tour the previous year had been but an illusion\"Rodriguez, pp. 184, 248. \u2013 an impression that was supported by the lightheartedness evident in the parent album's artwork and Harrison's self- deprecating \"Ohnothimagen\" producer's moniker.Madinger & Easter, p. 451. Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone wrote of the song: \"'You,' the single which preceded Extra Texture ... is not only the best thing he has done since 1971's 'My Sweet Lord,' but also promised some of the prestige and credibility he lost with last year's sourvoiced album (Dark Horse) and fizzled tour.\"Dave Marsh, \"George Harrison Extra Texture\", Rolling Stone, 20 November 1975, p. 75 (retrieved 19 July 2016). In the NME, Neil Spencer opined: \"'You' seems at least to proclaim a return to energy. It has the kind of semi-Spector production that was spread all over All Things Must Pass. It bounds along OK, Harrison's double-tracked vocals gasp convincingly, and it deserves to be the hit that it will be.\"Neil Spencer, \"George Harrison: Extra Texture (Apple)\", NME, 20 September 1975, p. 23.Hunt, p. 103. Reviewing for Melody Maker, Ray Coleman highlighted Harrison's vocal and the musical contributions from Horn and Russell, and said: \"It's a dead cert disco smash, his finest single since 'My Sweet Lord'.\" Coleman added that the lyrics were \"deceptively simple\" since, as with Harrison's 1969 composition \"Something\", \"they say a lot by saying a little.\"Ray Coleman, \"Extra Texture: Back to the Sixties!\", Melody Maker, 6 September 1975, p. 30. Billboard called the song a \"catchy cut highlighted by his strongest singing in some time\", saying that it had an effective hook and sounded like it could have fit on All Things Must Pass.\"Top Single Picks\", Billboard, 20 September 1975, p. 60 (retrieved 18 July 2020). Writing later in the 1970s, however, in their book The Beatles: An Illustrated Record, Roy Carr and Tony Tyler dismissed the track with the words: \"Doleful, lacklustre, [with] would-be singalongs which quite fail to arouse.\"Carr & Tyler, pp. 116\u201317. ===Retrospective assessment and legacy=== In his review of Harrison's 1987 album Cloud Nine, for Creem magazine, Bill Holdship included the track among the \"scattered brilliant moments\" of Harrison's career post- All Things Must Pass, saying: \"'You' from the Extra Texture LP sounds like punk (depends on your definition) pop as Phil Spector might've done it, and remains a killer to this day. And when I saw Harrison perform in 1974, he put on a far better show than the one I would later see Wings do.\"Bill Holdship, \"George Harrison: Cloud Nine\", Creem, March 1988; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Writing in the posthumous Rolling Stone Press tribute, Harrison, in 2002, Mikal Gilmore similarly identified \"You\" as a highlight of the artist's work in the mid to late 1970s.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 46. In the same publication, Greg Kot deemed it to be \"a terrific single\", adding: \"Its roaring Wall of Sound arrangement suits Harrison well, right down to its closing quote of the Ronettes' 'Be My Baby'.\"The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 188. In a January 2002 review of Harrison's solo releases, for Goldmine magazine, Dave Thompson described the song as \"magnificent\".Dave Thompson, \"The Music of George Harrison: An album- by-album guide\", Goldmine, 25 January 2002, p. 17. AllMusic's Lindsay Planer admires it as a \"propulsive and rocking love song ... backed by one of Harrison's most liberated and driving melodies\"; Planer also notes the \"nonstop powerhouse instrumental track\", driven by Gordon and Keltner's \"double-barreled percussive assault\".Lindsay Planer, \"George Harrison 'You'\", AllMusic (retrieved 16 April 2013). Richard Ginell, also writing for AllMusic, calls the song an \"instantly winning\" single and album-opener, and rates it among the best tracks of Harrison's solo career.Richard S. Ginell, \"George Harrison Extra Texture\", AllMusic (retrieved 16 April 2013). Among reviewers of Harrison's 2014 Apple Years reissues, New Zealand Herald critic Graham Reid describes \"You\" as a \"remarkably upbeat rocker\",Graham Reid, \"George Harrison Revisited, Part One (2014): The dark horse bolting out of the gate\", Elsewhere, 24 October 2014 (retrieved 4 December 2014). while Walter Tunis of the Lexington Herald-Leader considers Extra Texture to be \"a delight\", from the opening, \"brightly orchestrated pop of You\" through to the closing track, \"His Name Is Legs\".Walter Tunis, \"Critic's Pick: George Harrison, 'The Apple Years 1968\u201375'\", kentucky.com, 14 October 2014 (retrieved 4 December 2014). Conversely, Paul Trynka of Classic Rock says that the song \"sounds dull today, with its dated sessioneer funk\", whereas \"it's the confessional songs [on Extra Texture] that have worn well.\"Paul Trynka, \"George Harrison: The Apple Years 1968\u201375\", Classic Rock, November 2014, p. 105 (retrieved 29 November 2014). Simon Leng views it as \"a great pop record\", adding: \"'You' has the same surging spirit as [Motown classics] \"Dancing in the Street\" and \"Heat Wave\" and, as the lyrics are full of boy-meets-girl triteness, the groove is what carries it.\" Ian Inglis identifies the song's strengths as its lyrical simplicity, a \"soaring, galloping melody ... [that] encapsulates the joy of reciprocated love and the liberation of rock 'n' roll at its most exuberant\", and the quality of the musicianship on the recording, particularly Jim Horn's contribution. Inglis concludes: \"Even the slight unease [Harrison] has in striving to maintain some of the higher notes cannot detract from what is, quite simply, a near-perfect pop song.\" Two years after Harrison's death from cancer in November 2001,Tillery, pp. 147\u201348. American singer-songwriter Lisa Mychols covered \"You\" for the multi-artist compilation He Was Fab: A Loving Tribute to George HarrisonTim Sendra, \"Various Artists He Was Fab: A Loving Tribute to George Harrison\", AllMusic (retrieved 16 April 2013). \u2013 a reading that Lindsay Planer describes as \"affective\" and a highlight of the album. At the New York Celebrates George Harrison Concert on 26 February 2011, in honour of what would have been Harrison's 68th birthday, New York band the 253 Boys performed \"You\" in a medley with his Cloud Nine track \"This Is Love\".Music and Fine Arts: \"FPC's New York Celebrates George Harrison Concert \u2013 A Night Of Love And Bliss\", Flower Power Creative, February 2011 (retrieved 16 April 2013). ==Personnel== *George Harrison \u2013 vocals*, electric guitar, acoustic guitar*, backing vocals* *Ronnie Spector \u2013 vocals *Jim Horn \u2013 saxophone* *Leon Russell \u2013 piano *Gary Wright \u2013 electric piano *David Foster \u2013 organ*, string synthesizer* *Carl Radle \u2013 bass *Jim Gordon \u2013 drums, tambourine *Jim Keltner \u2013 drums* * denotes May\u2013June 1975 overdubs ==Chart positions== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1975) !Peak position |- |Canadian RPM 100 Singles\"George Harrison (Song artist 225)\", Tsort pages (retrieved 27 December 2012). | style=\"text-align:center;\"|9 |- |Japanese Oricon Singles Chart\"George Harrison: Chart Action (Japan)\" , homepage1.nifty.com (retrieved 28 December 2012). | style=\"text- align:center;\"|66 |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand Singles Chart\"George Harrison \u2013 You\", charts.org.nz (retrieved 16 April 2013). | style=\"text-align:center;\"|35 |- |Swedish Topplistan Singles\"George Harrison \u2013 You\", swedishcharts.com (retrieved 16 April 2013). | style=\"text-align:center;\"|19 |- |UK Singles Chart\"Artist: George Harrison\", Official Charts Company (retrieved 11 April 2014). | style=\"text-align:center;\"|38 |- |US Billboard Hot 100\"Billboard Hot 100 (for week ending November 8, 1975)\", Billboard, 8 November 1975, p. 60. | style=\"text-align:center;\"|20 |- |US Cash Box Top 100\"Cash Box Top 100 Singles\", Cash Box, 8 November 1975, p. 4. | style=\"text-align:center;\"|19 |- |US Record World Singles Chart\"The Singles Chart\", Record World, 1 November 1975, p. 29. | style=\"text-align:center;\"|39 |- |West German Media Control Singles Chart\"Single \u2013 George Harrison, You\", charts.de (retrieved 3 January 2013). | style=\"text-align:center;\"|43 |} ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * Dale C.
