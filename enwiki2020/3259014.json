    "text": "General Fritz Thiele (14 April 1894 \u2013 4 September 1944) was a member of the German resistance who served as the communications chief of the German Army during World War II. Thiele was born in Berlin and joined the Imperial Army in 1914. Working closely with Chief of army communications General der Nachrichtentruppe Erich Fellgiebel, he was part of the assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944. He was responsible as part of the coup attempt in the effort to sever communications between officers loyal to Hitler and armed forces units in the field and from the communications centre at the Bendlerstrasse in Berlin he relayed a crucial message from Fellgiebel to General Friedrich Olbricht and the other conspirators that the assassination attempt had failed but the coup attempt should still proceed. There are differing accounts of the time when he provided this report. Thiele himself did not want to proceed with the coup attempt when he knew that the assassination attempt had failed and he left the Bendlerstrasse and visited Walter Schellenberg at the Reich Central Security Office in an attempt to extricate himself. Following Fellgiebel's arrest he was directed to assume his duties before he was himself arrested by the Gestapo on 11 August 1944. He was condemned to death on 21 August 1944 by the Volksgerichtshof and hanged on 4 September 1944 at Pl\u00f6tzensee prison in Berlin. ==See also== *Lucy spy ring ==Sources== * Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison == References == Category:Executed members of the 20 July plot Category:People from Berlin executed at Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison Category:German military personnel of World War II Category:People condemned by Nazi courts Category:Executed people from Berlin Category:1894 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People executed by hanging at Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison Category:Lieutenant generals of the German Army (Wehrmacht) ",
