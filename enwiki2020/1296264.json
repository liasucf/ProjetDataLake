    "text": "Muhu (also called Muhumaa in Estonian), is an island in the West Estonian archipelago of the Baltic Sea. With an area of it is the third largest island belonging to Estonia, after Saaremaa and Hiiumaa. Together with neighbouring smaller islands of Kesselaid, Viirelaid, V\u00f5ilaid and Suurlaid it forms Muhu Parish (), the rural municipality within Saare County. The municipality has a population of 1,697 (as of 19 April 2010) and covers an area of . The population density is . ==History and geography== The German names for the island are Mohn and Moon. Moon is also the Swedish name for the island. The most important villages in Muhu are Kuivastu, Liiva (where the school can be found) and Koguva. In P\u00e4daste, an internationally renowned luxury hotel and spa operates in the restored manor house. The island is divided from mainland Estonia by the Suur Strait (Moonsund) and from Saaremaa by the V\u00e4ike Strait. It is linked by ferry to Virtsu in the mainland, and to Saaremaa by a causeway, the V\u00e4inatamm. In winter an ice road connects the island to the mainland. In January 1227, an army of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword with Letts, Germans of Riga and native Livonians (20,000 men commanded by William of Modena) crossed on sea ice from the mainland and attacked the island of Saaremaa to reduce the last holdout of pagan Estonians. The Estonians surrendered on Muhu at a circular stronghold called Mona, the earthworks of which are still preserved near the causeway between the islands. This ended the Estonian Crusade. The Battle of Karuse or Battle on the Ice was fought on 16 February 1270 between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Livonian Order on the frozen Baltic Sea between the Muhu Island and the mainland. The Lithuanians achieved a decisive victory. The battle, named after the Karuse village, was the fifth-largest defeat of the Livonian or Teutonic Orders in the 13th century. The same waters saw the Battle of Moon Sound in September\u2013October 1917 between Russian and German naval forces. Muhu is also famous for having the only still-working traditional windmills in Estonia. Muhu is the home of Estonia's first wine tourism farm \u2013 Luscher & Matiesen Muhu Winehouse. ==Gallery== File:NorthMuhuCoast.JPG|Northern coast of Muhu File:MuhuStronghold.JPG|Muhu Stronghold, site of the native Estonian surrender to crusaders in 1227 File:Muhu stronghold memorial stone2.JPG|Monument in the center of the Muhu Stronghold File:Cliffs.JPG|\u00dc\u00fcgu cliffs File:Muhu Katariina kirik Liiva k\u00fclas.JPG|Muhu St. Catherine's Church File:P\u00e4daste m\u00f5isa peahoone.JPG|P\u00e4daste Manor File:Muhumuseum.jpg|Muhu museum File:Rongk\u00e4ik, Muhu P\u00f5hikool.IMG 5102.JPG|Students and teachers in traditional clothing march in a procession in Liiva File:In classroom of village school.JPG|Old village school File:Old village.JPG|In M\u00f5ega village File:Koguva sadam 2015.jpg|Koguva harbour File:Windmill in Koguva(Estonia).jpg|Windmill in Koguva File:EE Muhu fl.png|Flag of Muhu Parish File:Muhu Valla vapp.jpg|Coat of Arms of Muhu Parish ==See also== *Municipalities of Estonia *List of municipalities of Estonia *List of islands of Estonia ==External links== * *Official website *Muhu Tourism Association *Muhu Island in Jetsetter Top10 *Photos about Muhu.
