    "text": "Changi Prison Complex. often known as simply Changi Prison, is a prison located in Changi in the eastern part of Singapore. ==History== ===First prison=== Changi, Singapore, 1941 Allied prisoners in makeshift quarters in a central corridor and from crowded cells in Changi Prison in 1945. Before Changi Prison was constructed, the only penal facility in Singapore was located at Pearl's Hill, beside the barracks of Sepoy Lines, and was known as the Singapore Prison. By 1930s, the Singapore Prison was overcrowded and deemed dangerous. The Singapore Prison had a capacity of 1,080, however in the early 1920s the average daily number of convicts was 1,043 and reached 1,311 by 1931. Thus the 1931 report presented by the newly appointed Inspector of Prisons for the Straits Settlements, and the Superintendent of Singapore Prisons, Captain Otho Lewis Hancock, recommended providing additional accommodations. With the additional accommodations, authorities would be able to segregate long-term prisoners, who were likely be of special danger to the community, away from short-term prisoners while relieving the congestion faced in the present facility. Deliberations in the Legislative Council saw opposition to the subsequent plans of constructing a new penal facility at Changi due to uncertainties in the numbers planned for the accommodations (ranging between 650 and 2,500), costs (moving from 2 million Straits dollars to 10 million Straits dollars and back), area to be used (250 acres to 1,500 acres), and the possibility of the new prison grounds turning into a white elephant. The tenders to construct the grounds of the new prison at Changi was put out in 1933, with the tender for erection and completion of the quarters first awarded to Hup Thye and Co for 16,900 Straits dollars on 26 June 1933, and a 2 September 1933 tender for the prison blocks was reportedly awarded to Chop Woh Hup, a local Chinese construction firm for 1,278,000 Straits dollars on 8 March 1934. Chop Woh Hup had 20 months to complete the construction of the prison blocks. The new prison would be 11.5 miles away from the Singapore settlement along the Changi Road and provided accommodations for 568 prisoners. Completed in 1936, within the 24 feet high, 3,000 feet long prison walls that were made of reinforced concrete, and occupying 13 acres of land, there would be: # An Administration Block and General Store # One European Block of Cells and Workshops # Two Asiatic Blocks of Cells and Workshops # Kitchen and Laundry Blocks # Hospital Block # Recalcitrant and Punishment Blocks Within the prison walls, there was an inner wall, 14 feet high, exercise yards, and sufficient vacant land to double the accommodations in the future. Outside the wall, 88 acres of land was set aside for gardening activities by the prisoners. Additional, quarters were provided for prison staff adjacent to the prison: # Superintendent's Quarters # Chief Gaoler's Quarters # Assistant Medical Officer's Quarters # Two Deputy Gaolers and 26 European Warders' Quarters # Asiatic Chief Warder's Quarters # Nine Blocks of 12 quarters for Asiatic Warders and Attendants # Ten Quarters for Clerks and Dressers. Along with additional contracts for water supply and sewage disposal, the total estimated costs of this new establishment worked out to be 2,050,000 Straits Dollars. However, due to this planned development, a subsidiary settlement was developed to support an enterprise of small Chinese traders who would provide necessities to the staff and the prison. When it was officially operational in June the following year, it was declared as one of, if not the best, prisons throughout the vast British Empire. The design of the prison was based on a \"T\"-shaped structure, with two cell-block wings stretching out from a central main block (for administration areas and warden- offices), to allow for quick and easy access to either cell-block wing for the wardens whenever necessary (from up above, the prison buildings formed the shape of the top of a telegram/telephone pole). Changi Prison also boasted the use of an advanced and extensive alarm system and had electrical lighting in its cells along with flush-toilets in each. The prison had a holding capacity of 600. Long-term prisoners would be transferred from the existing Singapore Prison. === Conversion into a prisoner of war camp === During World War II, following the Fall of Singapore in February 1942, the Japanese military detained about 3,000 civilians in Changi Prison, which was built to house only one-fifth of that number. The Japanese used the British Army's Selarang Barracks, near the prison, as a prisoner of war camp, holding some 50,000 Allied soldiers, predominantly British and Australian, and from 1943, Dutch civilians brought over by the Japanese from the islands in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). POWs were in fact rarely, if ever, held in the civilian prison at Changi. Nevertheless, in the UK, Australia, The Netherlands and elsewhere, the name \"Changi\" became synonymous with the infamous POW camp nearby, since most of the Japanese prisons were in the Changi area. Around 500 detainees were women who had been separated with their children and marched to the cramped prison camp from their homes. These women and also girls sewed quilts for the prison hospital, daringly embroidering their own secret symbols and stories into the squares, including forget-me-nots, butterflies, angels, scenery of trees and sheep, other symbolic flowers and even a domestic sitting room, ships, birds and a map of Scotland, and one of Australia. They risked severe punishments by sewing depicting their prison environment and adding dozens, or even over 400 names, in one case onto the cloths. One depicted the Changi Stroll, the forced march of the captive women and children over 9 miles to the prison under the occupation by the Japanese on 8 March 1942, coincidentally now International Women's Day commemorating women and the defiance of the suffragettes. Surviving examples of the prison handiwork are in the archives of the British Red Cross, Imperial War Museum, London or held at the Australian War Memorial. About 850 POWs died during their internment in Changi during the Japanese occupation of Singapore, a relatively low rate compared to the overall death rate of 27% for POWs in Japanese camps. However, many more prisoners died after being transferred from Changi to various labour camps outside Singapore, including those on the Burma Railway and at Sandakan airfield. Allied prisoners of war piling out of the main gate of the Changi Prison after the British liberation of Singapore in September 1945 Allied POWs, mainly Australians, built a chapel at the prison in 1944 using simple tools and found materials. Stanley Warren of the 15th Regiment, Royal Regiment of Artillery painted a series of murals at the chapel. Another British POW, Sgt. Harry Stodgen, built a Christian cross out of a used artillery shell. After the war, the chapel was dismantled and shipped to Australia, while the cross was sent to the UK. The chapel was reconstructed in 1988, and is now located at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Canberra. The prisoners of war also established an education program nicknamed the Changi University. After the war, the prison was used by the returning British to hold former Japanese staff officers, Kempeitai, police and guards from concentration camps. Executions were conducted in the inner yard where three gallows were erected. British soldiers were stationed there as prison guards. On 17 October 1945, all 260 German seamen of former U-Boats based in Southeast Asia (in joint operations with the Imperial Japanese Navy during the war) were moved from Pasir Panjang to the prison. On 26 June 1946, all German soldiers and a few civilians were notified they would be shipped back to England on a passenger liner, the Empress of Australia, before their eventual return to Germany.Giese, O., 1994, Shooting the war: The memoir and photographs of a U-boat officer in World War II, Annapolis: United States Naval Institute, ====Kempeitai==== The prison also contained the headquarters of the Kempeitai, the Japanese military police. The Kempeitai tortured and (rarely) executed prisoners there, who they suspected were spies. Most were civilians, although a small number were Allied POWs. ===Changi Chapel and Museum=== Original Changi chapel, relocated to Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory The original open air chapel, built by the POWs in 1944, was later relocated to Duntroon, Canberra. In 1988, Singapore built a replica chapel, next to the Changi Prison. The project included a museum. When Changi Prison was expanded in 2001, the chapel and museum were relocated to a new site away, officially reopening on 15 February 2001. In 1994, Changi Women's Prison and Drug Rehabilitation Centre was opened. Replica Chapel in Singapore ==Demolition and redevelopment== In 2000, a plan was revealed to consolidate the 14 prisons and drug rehabilitation centres (DRCs) that were scattered across the country into one mega complex at Changi Prison location. The complex would sit on a land at the size of 48ha at the cost of S$1.07 billion, however freeing up 61ha of land, which would make way for residential development. The complex would occupy on the lands of existing Changi Prison, Moon Crescent Prison and Jalan Awan Prison. The plan was carried out in phases, with each phase forming a cluster of prison institutions in the complex. Cluster A was officially launch on 16 August 2004. Cluster A would house the inmates from the existing Changi Prison, Moon Crescent Prison, Jalan Awan Prison and the Changi Reformative Training Centre. Cluster B was officially launched on 20 January 2010. Cluster B would house 5,600 inmates from standalone prisons: Tanah Merah Prison, Queenstown Remand Prison, Sembawang DRC, Khalsa Crescent Prison, and Selarang Park DRC. The inmates were moved in five separate, single day operations between July and August 2009, making it the largest transfer of prisoners in Singapore history. Cluster B would eventually become the start and the end of most prisoners' journey within the complex, with the admissions and pre- release procedures carried out in the buildings of this cluster. On 2012, work on building the SPS headquarters on the Complex's grounds began with the $118.5 million contract awarded to Sembawang Engineers and Constructors (SEC). The building would contain a hydrogen integrated proton-exchange membrane fuel cell power plant to generate clean energy to be supplied to the complex. Due by 2014, it was delayed due to financial troubles faced by SEC. On 15 October 2017, Changi Women's Prison was effectively moved into Cluster B. On 4 July 2018, Admiralty West Prison was effectively relocated to TM2, the yet-to-be demolished facilities of Tanah Merah Prison. === Preservation efforts === Towards the end of 2003, Australian authorities lobbied the Singapore government to preserve the old Changi Prison after knowing that the old Changi Prison would be demolished by April 2004 to redevelop the land for Cluster B, on the basis of its historical significance where 15,000 Australians were imprisoned after Singapore fell to imperial Japan in 1942. On 8 March 2004, a decision was arrived to preserve the old prison's iconic front walls, front gates and two guard-towers at either end of the wall, which was welcomed by Australian's Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer . In 2016, the historical remnants of the old prison \u2013 the entrance gate, wall and turrets \u2013 was gazetted as the 72nd National Monument of Singapore. The entrance gate was moved from the adjacent boundary wall and fitted into the retained wall. The remnants are hidden by a tall fence and barely visible from the road. In 2016, SPS would consider redeveloping the area in front of the remnants to make them more visible to the public. ==Current prison== Presently, the new Changi Prison houses the most serious criminal offenders in the country, including criminal offenders who are serving long sentences and those who have been sentenced to death. It serves as the detention site for death row inmates at Changi, before they are executed by hanging, traditionally on a Friday morning. Changi Prison is also one of the main places (though not the only one) where judicial corporal punishment by caning is carried out. Caning sessions at Changi are held twice per week. A former employee of the prison has been quoted in 1995 as saying: \"They are flogging more and more these days. Before they were doing maybe 60 on Tuesdays and Fridays, now they're doing a hundred\".\"Eye of a Tiger\", The Guardian, London, 20 May 1995 ==Notable detainees== ===Prisoners of war=== * Sir Norman Alexander Professor of Physics, Raffles College, Singapore, Vice-Chancellor, Ahmadu Bello University, Nigeria.
