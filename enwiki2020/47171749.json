Born in Ia\u0219i, he was the first child of Constantin Negruzzi.Lecca, p. 363 He began his education at Academia Mih\u0103ilean\u0103, but completed high school in Berlin, where he was sent with his brother Iacob in 1853. He wanted to study medicine at Berlin University, but was too revolted by the anatomical dissections, and switched to philosophy and law. He attended lectures at Berlin and Vienna, but did not graduate. He returned home in 1864, where he was named a judge at the Ia\u0219i tribunal. He gradually advanced to become a member of the appeals court as well as general prosecutor. A member of the Conservative Party, he was Prefect of Ia\u0219i County under the Lasc\u0103r Catargiu government (1871-1876), resuming this office in March 1888. He also served as mayor of Ia\u0219i, as deputy and as senator.Maiorescu (2001), p. 346 Near the end of his life, he was administrator of Sf\u00e2ntul Spiridon Hospital. He died at the family estate in Hermeziu village. Also interested in literature, he belonged to the cultural milieu surrounding Junimea and Convorbiri Literare, which his brother edited.Rosetti, p. 137 He wrote six novellas: V\u00e2ntul soartei (1867), Evreica (1868-1869), O r\u0103zbunare (1874), \u021aiganca (1877), Serghie Pavlovici (1881) and Os\u00e2ndi\u021bii (1881-1882). All appeared in his brother's magazine, and were judged by Titu Maiorescu as \"distinguished neither by the originality of their concept nor through their style\".Maiorescu (2005), p. 654 He had five daughters and two sons. ==Notes== ==References== *Octav George Lecca, Familiile boere\u0219ti rom\u00e2ne: istoric \u0219i genealogie dupe isvoare autentice, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1899 *Titu Maiorescu, Constantin Schifirne\u021b (ed.), Discursuri parlamentare, Editura Albatros, Bucharest, 2001, *Titu Maiorescu; Dimitrie Vatamaniuc, Eugen Simion (eds.), Opere: Critice, Editura Funda\u021biei Na\u021bionale pentru \u0218tiin\u021b\u0103 \u0219i Art\u0103, Bucharest, 2005, *Dimitrie Rosetti, Dic\u021bionarul Contimporanilor, Editura Lito-Tipografiei \"Populara\", Bucharest, 1897 Category:1840 births Category:1890 deaths Category:People from Ia\u0219i Category:Romanian expatriates in Germany Category:Romanian judges Category:Romanian prosecutors Category:Romanian novelists Category:Conservative Party (Romania, 1880\u20131918) politicians Category:Prefects of Romania Category:Mayors of Ia\u0219i Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Romania) Category:Members of the Senate of Romania Category:Junimists Category:19th-century Romanian novelists ",
