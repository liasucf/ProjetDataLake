National Highway (old NH 220 Kollam - Theni now NH 183) connects Kanjirapally to major nearest cities. Kanjirappally is also known as the Gateway of Highrange as it is the geographic entrance to the 'Malanad' or the Hill country of Kerala that extends to Idukki district and then to Tamil Nadu. Kanjirapally is one of the most busiest towns in the Kottayam district. The nearest Airport is Nedumbassery International Airport (). The nearest railway station is Kottayam Railway Station (). ==Economy== Rubber plantations are a major source of income for the local population. Part of the Syrian Christian belt under Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Changanassery, the place has a large population of Syrian Catholic Christians. The Christians of Kanjirapally are known to be the earliest agrarian group in Kerala to have switched to plantation agriculture by the beginning of the 20th century. The place is, therefore, home to many legendary Syrian Christian families of Kerala who owe their affluence to plantation agriculture, particularly to the production of latex. == Business == Kanjirappally is one of the major agrarian business towns in Kerala, with a large production of latex, spices, jack fruits, etc. being exported. Kanjirappally has many business headquarters, including: * St Mary's Rubber * Oxygen * Eloit * Heavecrumb ==Film shooting== Since the early 1980s, scores of Malayalam movies depicted the region as a pocket of Christian affluence. The term 'Achayan', which is colloquially used among the Nasranis of Central Travancore, has always been synonymous with Kanjirapally and neighboring towns like Mundakayam, Ponkunnam, Erumely , Erattupetta etc. The film 'Thopil Jopan' was shot in the Kanjirapally cathedral church. ==Syrian Christian Settlements== The Syrian Christian colonization of Kanjirappally had a profound impact on the history of commerce and agriculture in these parts. The Christians claim their roots from early settlements at Nilackal or Chayal on the banks of Pamba River, in the Sabarimala Hills of eastern Kerala. There is also a strong belief that the flourishing Christian community here was founded by Saint Thomas the Apostle himself. The place was in the forest recesses far away from seats of power. Nilackal became an important depot for spices like pepper, cardamom, etc., and the Christians were engaged in this lucrative trade as procures and sorters. Following a catastrophic event in the mid 14th century, the Christian inhabitants of Nilackal fled the region, a large section of whom migrated to the present day Kanjirapally, which is 30 miles northwest of the ancient town. The direct descendants of these settlers constructed the Pazhayapally Akkarappally (meaning the 'Old Church') in the middle of the town. Following the agrarian expansion of the 19th century, the Syrian Christians spread to places around Kanjirapally, such as Manimala, Ponkunnam, Erumely, Mundakayam and their surrounding regions, clearing forests and setting up farms. ==Climate== Kanjirapally has the highest number of rainy days in Kerala. It receives the highest amount of summer rains, winter rains and northeast monsoons (Thulaam Mazha) in Kerala, making it one of the very few places in India enjoying equatorial rainforest type climate, with no distinct dry season. The well-distributed rainfall pattern of Kanjirapally is the primary reason for the phenomenon of high yield of latex from Rubber plantations in and around the town. The average annual rainfall is 4156 mm. ==Religion== Kanjirappally bishop Mar Mathew Arackal with Fr. Prasant Payyappilly Palakkappilly and other priests at the tomb of Mar Varghese Payyappilly Palakkappilly The population in the town area is a mixture of Syrian Christians, Muslims, and Hindus.
