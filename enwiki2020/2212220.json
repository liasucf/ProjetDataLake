It was built by the Portuguese Jesuits in 1579 and opened to public worship on the feast of John the Baptist that year. It also had an attached graveyard. The church was abandoned in 1840 after an epidemic hit the village. Fr. Jos\u00e9 Louren\u00e7o Pais, the then Vicar of Kondivita transferred the church to the nearby Marol village. The baptismal font, pillars and altars were transferred to the new church. After abandonment, the church fell into decay and vegetation started to take over the ruins. Despite being abandoned, the native Christians visit the church once every year, as is traditional worldwide. The church was handed back to Fr. Rodney Esperance of Bombay Archdiocese in 2003 by the then Maharashtra Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde.CM gives SEEPZ church back to archdiocese ==References== * Roofless, but soul is intact, Jeetha D'Silva, Times of India, pg-5, 2005-07-10 * Category:Roman Catholic churches in Mumbai Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1579 Category:Portuguese structures in Mumbai Category:Church ruins in India Category:Jesuit churches in India ",
