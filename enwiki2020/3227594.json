    "text": "Argote de Molina El conde Lucanor Don Juan Manuel's Tales of Count Lucanor, in Spanish Libro de los ejemplos del conde Lucanor y de Patronio (Book of the Examples of Count Lucanor and of Patronio), also commonly known as El Conde Lucanor, Libro de Patronio, or Libro de los ejemplos (original Old Castilian: Libro de los enxiemplos del Conde Lucanor et de Patronio), is one of the earliest works of prose in Castilian Spanish. It was first written in 1335. The book is divided into four parts. The first and most well-known part is a series of 50 short stories (some no more than a page or two) drawn from various sources, such as Aesop and other classical writers, and Arabic folktales. Story 28, \"Of what happened to a woman called Truhana\", a version of Aesop's The Milkmaid and Her Pail, was claimed by Max M\u00fcller to originate in the Hindu cycle Panchatantra. Tales of Count Lucanor was first printed in 1575 when it was published at Seville under the auspices of Argote de Molina. It was again printed at Madrid in 1642, after which it lay forgotten for nearly two centuries. ==Purpose and structure== Don Juan Manuel, the author of Tales of Count Lucanor A didactic, moralistic purpose, which would color so much of the Spanish literature to follow (see Novela picaresca), is the mark of this book. Count Lucanor engages in conversation with his advisor Patronio, putting to him a problem (\"Some man has made me a proposition...\" or \"I fear that such and such person intends to...\") and asking for advice. Patronio responds always with the greatest humility, claiming not to wish to offer advice to so illustrious a person as the Count, but offering to tell him a story of which the Count's problem reminds him. (Thus, the stories are \"examples\" [ejemplos] of wise action.) At the end he advises the Count to do as the protagonist of his story did. Each chapter ends in more or less the same way, with slight variations on: \"And this pleased the Count greatly and he did just so, and found it well. And Don Joh\u00e1n (Juan) saw that this example was very good, and had it written in this book, and composed the following verses.\" A rhymed couplet closes, giving the moral of the story. ==Treatments derived from Tales of Count Lucanor== Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew has the basic elements of Tale 44, \"Of what happened to a young Man on his Wedding Day\".Exemplo XXXV\u00ba - De lo que contes\u00e7i\u00f3 a un man\u00e7ebo que cas\u00f3 con una muger muy fuerte et muy brava Tale 7, \"Of that which happened to a King and three Impostors\"Exemplo XXXII\u00ba - De lo que contesci\u00f3 a un rey con los burladores que fizieron el pa\u00f1oThe tale is to be found in Idries Shah's collection World Tales. tells the story that Hans Christian Andersen made popular as The Emperor's New Clothes. Tale 23, What happened to a good Man and his Son, leading a beast to market is the familiar fable The miller, his son and the donkey. In 2016, Baroque Decay released a game under the name \"The Count Lucanor\". As well as some protagonists' names, certain events from the books inspired past events in the game. ==The stories== The titles in the following list are those given in James York's 1868 translation into English. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ The Prologue !
