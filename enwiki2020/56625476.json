    "text": "Ethereality is the second studio album by the American bi-lingual indie rock band Winter, released on April 6, 2018. It's the band's first release in three years, following their debut album, Supreme Blue Dream, in 2015. == Background == The album was announced by Winter through social media on February 18. Even though the track listing wasn't revealed straight after the announcement, the name of the tracks could be seen on the album's official artwork. The long- delayed tracks \"Alligator\" and \"Zoey\" are included on the album's track listing. While \"Alligator\" was revealed to the audience on mid-2013 through a demo version, \"Zoey\" was written in 2016 and has been performed live ever since. Previously released singles \"Jaded\", \"Dreaming\", \"Mem\u00f3ria Colorida\", \"Wherever You Are\" and \"All the Things You Do\", all of which have had moderated commercial success, didn't make it to the final cut of the album. == Track listing == ==Personnel== ===Winter=== *Samira Winter \u2013 vocals and guitar *Matt Hogan \u2013 guitars and backing vocals *David Yorr \u2013 guitar, bass, synth, and backing vocals *Garren Orr \u2013 drums and percussion *Justine Brown \u2013 backing vocals *Chelsea Brown \u2013 backing vocals ===Production=== *Drew Fischer \u2013 engineer *Nolan Eley \u2013 Mixer *Matt Hogan \u2013 Additional mixing and engineering *Josh Bonati \u2013 Masteringhttps://daydreamingwinter.bandcamp.com/album/ethereality == References == Category:2018 albums Category:Samira Winter albums ",
