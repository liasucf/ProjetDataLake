    "text": "{| |} The Ilyushin Il-14 (NATO reporting name: Crate) was a Soviet twin-engine commercial and military personnel and cargo transport aircraft that first flew in 1950, and entered service in 1954. Il-14 was also manufactured in East Germany by VVB Flugzeugbau, in Czechoslovakia as the Avia 14. The Ilyushin Il-14 was typically replaced by the Antonov An-24 and Yakovlev Yak-40. ==Design and development== The Il-14 was developed as a replacement for the widespread Douglas DC-3 and its Soviet built version, the Lisunov Li-2. A development of the earlier Ilyushin Il-12, (that first flew in 1945), the Il-14 was intended for use in both military and civil applications. The Il-12 had major problems with poor engine-out behaviour. Also, it had less payload capability than was originally planned (although the Il-12 was intended to carry 32 passengers, in service it only carried 18, which was uneconomical). An Avia 14T of CSA displayed at the 1957 Paris Air Show The development into the Il-14 was a vast improvement over the Il-12, with a new wing and a broader tailfin. It was powered by two 1,400 kW (1,900 hp) Shvetsov ASh-82T-7 radial piston engines. These changes greatly improved aerodynamic performance in engine-out conditions. Total production of the Il-14 was 1,345 aircraft: 1,065 in Moscow (Moscow Machinery Plant Nr.30) from 1956 to 1958 and Tashkent (Factory Nr.84) from 1954 to 1958. Licensed production of 80 in East Germany by VEB Flugzeugwerke Dresden (FWD) from 1956 to 1959 and 203 in Czechoslovakia by Avia, Prague, from 1956 to 1960. It was rugged and reliable, and thus was widely used in rural areas with poor quality airfields. The type was also used by the East German aircraft industry as a test aircraft for the horizontal stabilizer of the Baade 152. ==Variants== An Avia 14FG at Czech Museum Kunovice * Il-14 : Twin-engined passenger, cargo transport aircraft. * Il-14FK / 14FKM : Aerial photography version. * Il-14G : Freight or cargo aircraft. * Il-14GGO : Geophysical research version. * Il-14LIK-1 / LIK-2: Navigation aid calibration version. * Il-14LR : Ice reconnaissance version. * Il-14M : Stretched Il-14P, fitted with a lengthened fuselage, 14\u201336 seat. * Il-14P : Airliner version, 18\u201332 seat. * Il-14PS / S : VIP versions, based on Il-14P. ** Il-14SI: Extended-range VIP version. ** Il-14SO: 18-seat VIP version. * Il-14RR: Fisheries reconnaissance version. * Il-14T : Military transport version. * Crate-C : Electronic warfare version. ===License-built variants=== * Avia 14 : Ilyushin Il-14Ms built by Avia under licence in Czechoslovakia. ** Avia 14-24 : 24-seat version. ** Avia 14-32 : 32-seat version. ** Avia 14-40 : 40-seat version. * Avia 14FG : Aerial survey aircraft. * Avia 14T : Avia-built Ilyushin Il-14T. * Avia 14S : VIP transport aircraft with six individual seats and a six-seat couch, can be fitted with long-range wing-tip fuel tanks. * Avia 14 Super : 1960-model with a pressurized cabin for 32, 36, or 42 passengers, fitted with long-range wing-tip fuel tanks. *VEB 14P : Ilyushin Il-14Ps built by VVB Flugzeugbau under licence in East Germany. *VEB 14T : VEB 14Ps converted to military transports. * Y-6 : Projected Chinese production version.

Ilyushin Il-14 ===Civil operators=== Very few examples remain airworthy, with some still in use for freight duties, and a handful maintained by aviation clubs and enthusiasts. Today only three aircraft remain airworthy in Russia: one, called \"Soviet Union\" at Gorelovo airfield near St. Petersburg, another, called \"Penguin\" has performed its maiden flight after restoration on 1.10.2012 and now is based at Stupino airfield near Moscow. The third aircraft, called \"The Blue Dream\" performed its maiden flight from Tushino airfield to Stupino airfield in May 2014 after more than 10 years repair performed by a team of aero enthusiasts. There was also one Il-14 that was possibly airworthy in the United States, but its registration was cancelled in July 2014. ; *Balkan Bulgarian Airlines *Tabso ; *CAAC *Shanxi Airlines *Wuhan Airlines *Zhongyuan Airlines ; *Aerocaribbean *Cubana \u2013 One example is displayed at the Museo del Aire (Cuba)Ogden (2008) ; *CSA Czech Airlines *Government of Czechoslovakia right|thumb|1961 photograph of an Ilyushin Il-14 operated by East-German airline Interflug ; *Deutsche Lufthansa *Interflug ; *Malev \u2013 10 were operated in Hungary from 1956, two of them by the Hungarian government, eight of them by Mal\u00e9v Hungarian Airlines.
