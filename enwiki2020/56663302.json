He was survived by four sons: Sa'd, Hasan, Muhammad Yahya, and Ahmad. Only Sa'd and Hasan were present at his death; Muhammad Yahya was in Medina and Ahmad was in Najd. After Zayd's death there was disagreement among the ashraf as to who should succeed him as Emir of Mecca. The majority sided with Hamud ibn Abd Allah, whose claim lay in the fact that it was his father, Sharif Abd Allah ibn Hasan, who had originally summoned Zayd from Yemen to be co-ruler with his son Muhammad ibn Abd Allah. Only a small party of ashraf backed Sa'd for the Emirate, namely: Mubarak ibn Muhammad al-Harith, Rajih ibn Qaytbay, Abd al-Muttalib ibn Muhammad, Mudar ibn al-Murtada, Husayn ibn Yahya, Faris ibn Barakat, and Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Ali. Both sides petitioned Imad Agha, who as sanjak-bey of Jeddah and shaykh al-haram of Mecca was the Ottoman government's representative in the land. Imad Agha decided in favor of Sa'd and sent him the khil'ah (robe of honor). ==Notes== ==References== * * * * Category:Sharifs of Mecca Category:17th-century Arabs Category:18th-century Arabs ",
