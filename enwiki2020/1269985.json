    "text": "BR-277 is a federal highway of Brazil, across the state of Paran\u00e1, between the town of Paranagu\u00e1 and Foz do Iguacu. ==Duplications== The highway is duplicated in the 140 km between the Port of Paranagu\u00e1, Curitiba and the junction with the BR-376. BR-277, as well as BRs 369 and 376, which form a triangle within the state of Paran\u00e1, were granted to private companies in 1997, at the beginning of the era of road concessions in Brazil. The contracts are valid until 2021. Initially, 995 km of roads in Paran\u00e1 should be duplicated, and the population was promised that the State would have First World highways, strongly boosting economic growth. But additions were soon signed that removed duplications and other works from the contracts. The duplication commitment fell from 995 to 616 km. To make matters worse, in 2019, what had been doubled was no more than 300 km, even with toll rates rising every year. The MPF (Federal Public Ministry) then carried out Operation Integration, which showed that the changes made to the contracts are part of a millionaire kickback scheme. The companies paid at least R $ 35 million in fees to achieve these changes in contracts. The estimated diversion of money in the toll system amounts to R $ 8.4 billion. Some of those cited by the MPF to receive these fees are: Jaime Lerner, Roberto Requi\u00e3o and Beto Richa, all former governors of the State of Paran\u00e1, and the concessionaires Rodonorte, Econorte, Ecovia, Ecocataratas, Caminhos do Paran\u00e1 and Viapar.
