    "text": "Location of battle, as given on map by Pierre Jacotin, 1826 The Battle of Mount Tabor, also known as the Skirmish of Mount Tabor, was an engagement between French forces under Jean Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber, aided in the second part of the battle by reinforcements lead by General Bonaparte, which defeated an Ottoman force led by Abdullah Pasha al-Azm of Damascus on 16 April 1799.Strathern, p. 350 Napoleon Bonaparte was besieging Acre, the Ottoman governor of Damascus sent an army to relieve the siege, and Kl\u00e9ber sought to intercept it. Strathern, p. 349 ==Background== By April, Napoleon had become worried about his strategic situation and the possible presence of large Ottoman forces in the vicinity. This resulted in more supervision of his subordinate and detailed instructions, which Kl\u00e9ber chaffed at.Strathern, p. 349 While in Nazareth, Kl\u00e9ber received news that a large Ottoman force was encamped near Mount Tabor, and saw a chance to make a name for himself. After taking the precaution to write to Napoleon of his intentions (but too late for Napoleon to respond), Kl\u00e9ber took his division of 2,000 men in the hopes of launching a daring night raid on the Ottoman camp. His plan was to march around the northern side of Mount Tabor to surprise the Ottoman forces at 2 AM.Strathern, p. 349-350 ==Battle== Kl\u00e9ber had badly estimated how long the march would take, and did not reach the plain below Mount Tabor until 6 AM, by which time the sun had risen. The Ottoman forces, consisting of 10,000 infantry and 25,000 cavalry, spotted Kl\u00e9ber, who realised that his best bet was to form two infantry squares to defend against attack, then hopefully retreat during the night. However as the day wore on, it became clear to both Kl\u00e9ber and the Ottomans that his position could not last, as Kl\u00e9ber's men were running out of ammunition, thirsty and starving. Strathern, p. 350 Just when all seemed to be lost, some of his soldiers claimed to have seen bayonents advancing from the north. Kl\u00e9ber tried to verify their report by climbing to a vantage point and using his telescope, but saw nothing. Desperate, Kl\u00e9ber prepared to abandon his artillery and wounded, and attempt a breakout, every man for himself. However, Kl\u00e9ber's men had not been mistaken: Napoleon was marching to their aid with 2,000 men. When Kl\u00e9ber had looked, Napoleon's forces had marched behind head-high wild wheat, which made them invisible from the battlefield. Strathern, p. 351 Napoleon found himself between the Ottomans and their camp. He ordered a part of his force to form square and march up on an enbankment, which made them visible to both the Ottomans and the French under Kl\u00e9ber, coordinated with a salvo from his artillery to announce his prescence. The Ottoman forces were briefly distracted by this, but were soon reassured by the sight of their advancing Mamluk cavalry and Nablus tribesmen. Seeing that the Ottomans would stand their ground, Napoleon sent three of his squares to march out, inbetween the Ottomans and their camp. Simultaneously, he sent 300 men into the camp, with orders to set fire to all the tents, and make a show of seizing supplies and camels. Upon seeing the destruction of their belongings and Napoleon's squares blocking the way to save their camp, the Ottomans felt cut off and began to retreat.Strathern, p. 351 Kl\u00e9ber saw his chance, and ordered his men to charge,Strathern, p. 351 which supported by the soldiers under Napoleon transformed the Ottoman retreat into a general rout. Ottoman cavalry headed for the mountains in the south, while their infantry scattered toward the Jourdan River. Recent rains had risen the water of the river and made its banks into a quagmire, and this poor timing resulted in thousands of casualties for the retreating Ottoman infantry. Strathern, p. 352 ==Aftermath== Overall Kl\u00e9ber's casualties were, according to his own account, two dead and seventeen wounded, but had Napoleon arrived just an hour later, his casualties would have been far more serious. On the other hand, the Ottomans, although estimates can not be relied upon, had lost a large proportion of their overall force. This victory not only ended any major threat of the Pasha's army lifting the siege of Acre, but the surviving Ottoman land forces were scattered and did not reform before Napoleon was forced to lift the siege the following month. ==Notes== ==References== *Smith, D.
