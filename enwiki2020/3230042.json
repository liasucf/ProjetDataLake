    "text": "The black-footed gray langur (Semnopithecus hypoleucos) is an Old World monkey, one of the species of langurs. This, like other gray langurs, is a leaf-eating monkey found in south India. ==Taxonomy== The black-footed gray langur was previously considered to be a subspecies of Semnopithecus entellus. Research done in 2003 by Brandon-Jones may indicate that it is a subspecies of Semnopithecus dussumieri. Some experts believe that the species may be a naturally occurring hybrid of Semnopithecus johnii and Semnopithecus dussumieri. Currently S. dussumieri is considered a junior synonym of the black-footed gray langur. ==Distribution== This black-footed gray langur is distributed throughout south-western India (Goa, Karnataka and Kerala), but is centred on the Western Ghats. Its total range is around 35,000 km2, with the species living inside and outside of protected areas. ==References== black- footed gray langur Category:Endemic fauna of India Category:Mammals of India Category:Monkeys in India black-footed gray langur ",
