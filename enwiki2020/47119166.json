The wingspan is 11\u201312 mm. The forewings are dark fuscous with three irregular pale blue-metallic transverse streaks, obtusely angulated and interrupted above the middle, the first from near the base of the costa to one-third of the dorsum, the second from one-third of the costa to beyond the middle of the dorsum, the third from three-fifths of the costa to two-thirds of the dorsum, the two latter with white on the costal edge. There is some brownish-ochreous suffusion between these on the subdorsal area, as well as a curved brownish-ochreous line from above the middle of the third streak to four-fifths of the dorsum. There is also a violet-silvery metallic subterminal streak, angulated above the middle and indented between this and the costa. The apical and terminal area beyond this is brownish ochreous, with four blackish longitudinal marks, and a black marginal line. The hindwings are blackish grey, lighter anteriorly.Meyrick, Edward (1916\u20131923). Exotic Microlepidoptera. 2 (5): 144. ==References== Category:Moths described in 1918 Category:Onebala ",
