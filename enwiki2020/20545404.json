The main organizers are J\u00f3zef Przytycki, Alexander Shumakovitch, Yongwu Rong and Valentina Harizanov, all of whom are at George Washington University.. This conference has become an important topological event in the Washington Metropolitan Area and regularly attracts well-known topologists from other areas of the US and from other countries..
