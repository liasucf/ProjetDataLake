    "text": "400px The Student Intellectual Property Law Association (SIPLA) is a voluntary association for law students who share an interest in intellectual property (IP). SIPLA chapters can typically be found at law schools that provide intellectual property curriculum. Although there is no national SIPLA body, either self endowed or sponsored by a national association, independent student chapters have materialized due to the need to organize intellectual property related events and provide networking and learning opportunities to students. == Typical SIPLA objectives == *Promote intellectual property issues across the student body, to those of the state bar, and beyond; *Bring together many facets of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights; *Provide a forum which promotes an open dialogue of current issues in intellectual property and exposes how these issues will affect the practice of intellectual property law in the future; and *Promote rapport between students and professionals in the intellectual property field. == SIPLA events == Every year, the SIPLA chapters organize networking and speaking events featuring influential IP professionals. == Resources == Logos for the Student Intellectual Property Law Association have been placed in the public domain under the GNU Free Documentation License. *200x50 pixels *400x100 pixels *600x150 pixels *800x200 pixels == Active SIPLA chapters == *California Western School of Law *Case Western Reserve University School of Law *California Western School of Law *Cleveland-Marshall College of Law *Franklin Pierce Law Center, Pierce Chapter Blog *George Washington University Law School *J.
