When his singing voice was discovered, he studied with in Braunschweig and Hans-Hermann Nissen and Willi Domgraf-Fassbaender in Munich.

In the 195354 season he was a member of the Stadttheater Gie\u00dfen.

N\u00f6cker was a member of the ensemble of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich for several decades starting in 1962. He appeared at the house in major roles, including Scarpia in Puccini's Tosca, Wagner roles Klingsor in Parsifal, Telramund in Lohengrin and the title role of Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder, and Strauss roles Mandryka in Arabella, Jochanaan in Salome and Orest in Elektra.

The role of Gloucester in Reimann's Lear in 1978 is remembered as one of his most stirring portrayals. In 1986, he performed in the premiere of Volker David Kirchner's Belshazar. N\u00f6cker performed at the Bayreuth Festival from 1958, first in small roles such as Hans Schwarz in Die Meistersinger, Melot in Tristan und Isolde and a Knight in Lohengrin, and in 1984 as Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger. At the Schwetzingen Festival, N\u00f6cker appeared in Gluck's Armida in 1966. He performed there in the premieres of Trojahn's Enrico (1991) and Eckehard Mayer's Sansibar in 1994. At the Salzburg Festival, he sang in a concert performance of Schreker's Die Gezeichneten in 1989. He was a frequent guest at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Cologne Opera, the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in Duisburg and D\u00fcsseldorf, the Frankfurt Opera and the Hamburg State Opera. In Berlin, he took part in the premiere of Fortner's Elisabeth Tudor in 1972 and Reimann's Die Gespenstersonate in 1984. Outside Germany, he performed as Klingsor at La Fenice in Venice in 1983, at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, the Edinburgh Festival, La Monnaie in Brussels, the Teatro Massimo in Palermo and the Royal Opera House in London.
