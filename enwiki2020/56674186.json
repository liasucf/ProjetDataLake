Sheridan won the New Zealand amateur flyweight boxing title in 1937, and was duly selected to represent New Zealand in the same division at the 1938 British Empire Games. In his opening bout, he came up against the 18-year-old South African schoolboy, Johannes Joubert, who outboxed Sheridan throughout what was said to be a lively encounter. Joubert went on to win the gold medal. Sheridan served in the Royal New Zealand Navy during World War II. In 1943, he became engaged to Felicia Ngaroma Russell, and they subsequently married. Sheridan died in New Plymouth on 11 July 2005, having been predeceased by his wife in 1996, and was buried with her at Awanui Cemetery. ==References== Category:1920 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Boxers at the 1938 British Empire Games Category:New Zealand male boxers Category:Royal New Zealand Navy personnel of World War II Category:Burials at Awanui Cemetery Category:Flyweight boxers ",
