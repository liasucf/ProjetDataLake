    "text": "Talgo, S.A. is a Spanish manufacturer of intercity, standard, and high speed passenger trains. The word Talgo is also used by the rail operator RENFE for a type of inter-city rail service (using Talgo VI cars). ==Corporate history== TALGO (Tren Articulado Ligero Goicoechea Oriol, Goicoechea-Oriol light articulated train), Alejandro Goicoechea and Jos\u00e9 Luis Oriol being the founders of the company. Talgo Patents S.A. was first incorporated in 1942. In March 2007 Talgo sold its Finnish rolling stock manufacturing subsidiary Talgo Oy to its local management and other Finnish investors. The company, which Talgo had owned for only seven years, reverted to its previous name of Transtech Oy. The company spends 10 to 12 percent of revenues on research and development, but the main revenue source is the Spanish railway operator Renfe. Talgo made an initial public offering on the Bolsa de Madrid in May 2015. The IPO valued the company at \u20ac1.27 billion. In July 2015, Talgo stated its intention to ship a Series 9 train to India at its own cost as a demonstration on the Mumbai-Delhi rail route.For trial run in India, wheelset being adjusted from 1520mm (Russian gauge) to 1676mm (Indian gauge). ==Design== Left: Conventional bogie system. Right: Talgo System Talgo trains are best known for their unconventional articulated railway passenger cars that use in-between carriage bogies that Talgo patented in 1941, similar to the earlier Jacobs bogie. The wheels are mounted in pairs but not joined by an axle and the bogies are shared between coaches rather than underneath individual coaches. This allows a railway car to take a turn at higher speed with less hunting oscillation. As the coaches are not mounted directly onto wheel bogies, the coaches are more easily insulated from track noise. Talgo trains fitted with variable gauge axles can change rail gauge - for instance at the / at the Spanish-French border interchange. Since the introduction of the Talgo Pendular in 1980, the train tilts naturally inwards on curves, allowing it to run faster on curves without causing discomfort to passengers. The carriage tilting system pivots around the top of the suspension columns, which has the effect of partially cancelling out the effects of the lateral acceleration when cornering. ==Trains== Talgo and RENFE Class 334 in Ourense railway station Talgo trains are divided into a number of generations. They come in both locomotive hauled and self-propelled versions. ===Talgo I=== Talgo I locomotive. The Talgo I was built in 1942 in Spain. The coaches were built at the \"Hijos de Juan Garay\" workshop in O\u00f1ati and the locomotive was built at the workshops of the \"Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Norte\" in Valladolid. It was built as a prototype, and it was used to set several railroad speed records. The first test run occurred between Madrid and Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha in October 1942. ===Talgo II=== Talgo II coaches and locomotives were first built in 1950 at the American Car and Foundry Company (ACF) works in the United States under the direction of Spanish engineers (the diesel-electric locomotives were assembled by ACF with electrical components made by General Electric). Talgo II carried most of the Jet Rocket train's passengers between Chicago and Peoria, Illinois, after entering service on the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (the Rock Island line) in 1956. Slightly different coaches were introduced later on, and indeed the last car type of the Jet Rocket resembled that of the future Talgo III.(1) (2) The New York Central Railroad trialed a complete train until 1958 but saw little success. Talgo IIs were also built for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad for its \"John Quincy Adams\" train from New York City to Boston, Massachusetts, and the Boston and Maine Railroad for its \"Speed Merchant\" train, running between Boston, Massachusetts and Portland, Maine. Soon afterwards, Talgo II trains began running in Spain, and were successfully operated until 1972. ===Talgo III=== A locomotive-hauled Talgo III train Talgo III coaches and locomotives entered service in 1964, introducing longer cars and easy directional reversibility of the cars. The Talgo III/RD was equipped with variable gauge axles, and this permitted the introduction, on 1 June 1969, of the first through train between Barcelona and Geneva (the Catalan Talgo), despite the difference in rail gauge.\"Stop Press\" (changes taking effect). Cooks Continental Timetable (June 1969 edition), p. 6; also pp. 71, 106. London: Thomas Cook Publishing. The same equipment was used for the Barcelona Talgo, which began operation on 26 May 1974 as the first-ever through train service between Barcelona and Paris.\"Barcelona Talgo\". Thomas Cook Continental Timetable (June 1975 edition), p. 466. Thomas Cook Publishing. ===Talgo Pendular=== Amtrak Cascades Talgo Pendular cars The Talgo Pendular (Talgo IV and Talgo V, also VI & Talgo 200 or 6th generation), introduced in 1980, created the \"natural tilting\" train, using a passive system that tilts the carriages with no need for electronic sensors or hydraulic equipment. The wheels are mounted on monoaxles between the carriages, and sitting on top of the monoaxles are suspension columns. The carriages are attached to the top of the suspension columns and swing outwards as the train goes through a curve. In 1988, a Talgo Pendular was used on trials for Amtrak on the Boston-New York corridor in the United States and on Deutsche Bahn lines in Germany. Trial commercial services with Talgo cars in the US commenced in 1994 between Seattle and Portland, and from 1998 different trains have been used on the Amtrak Cascades services from Vancouver, British Columbia south to Seattle, Washington, continuing south via Portland, Oregon to Eugene, Oregon. Five Talgo IV trains were in use in Argentina on the General Roca Railway, however they have since been replaced by CRRC Dalian rolling stock and their future is uncertain as of 2015.\u00bfTraslado al cementerio? - Cronica Ferroviaria, 5 May 2015. Talgo 200 series trains are also in use in Kazakhstan for the overnight train Almaty\u2013Astana. Kazakhstan Buys Two Talgo Trains, International Railway Journal (1 December 2000) ===Talgo VII=== Altaria service from Madrid - Barcelona passing Viladecans (Barcelona) The Talgo VII introduced beginning in 2000 is used as a locomotive-pulled train set as well as intermediate cars for the multiple units Talgo 250, Talgo 350 and Talgo XXI. The carriages are similar to the Talgo Pendular type but have an air-controlled hydraulic brake system and power supply from head end power instead of diesel engine-generators in the end cars. Talgo VII trains have the car which has two pairs of wheels in the middle of the set (of cars) rather than at one end of the set, which is the case for earlier Talgo trains. All the other cars in the set have a single pair of wheels. ===Talgo 8=== The Series 8 passenger cars are similar to the Series VII cars, but are designed for the North American market. Talgo made an agreement in 2009 to build a manufacturing facility in Wisconsin which would initially supply two 14-car trainsets for the Amtrak Hiawatha Service until the project was cancelled. The company expressed hope the plant would later be used to build trains for other U.S. rail projects. Early in 2010, the Oregon Department of Transportation announced that it had negotiated the purchase of two 13-car trainsets for use in the Pacific Northwest rail corridor between Eugene and Vancouver, British Columbia. These trainsets were also manufactured in Wisconsin, and were delivered in 2013. The sets are currently operating in the \"Cascades\" corridor in the Pacific Northwest. They have been integrated with the five existing sets in regular service. The Series 8 trains offer passengers many modern amenities including high speed Wi-Fi, reclining seats and a full service bistro and lounge car. In 2014, the state of Michigan expressed interest in operating the unused Talgo 8 cars for their Amtrak Wolverine service. Three years later, Amtrak proposed to lease or buy the unused cars in the wake of the 2017 Washington train derailment. The sets are currently at the Talgo facility in Milwaukee, WI being modified for Cascades service. ===Talgo 9=== This series, designed for Russia and Kazakhstan, has features wide bodyshell and wheelsets. There are three versions, consisting of either 1520mm fixed gauge, 1520-1435mm variable gauge or 1520-1676mm variable gauge. They are used in the Berlin-Moscow line (December 2016). The final successful test run of the Talgo 9 series coaches was completed in India on September 10, 2016.The final successful test run of the Talgo 9 series coaches was completed in India in the first week of September, 2016. ===Talgo 250 HSR=== The Talgo 250 is a dual voltage electric train (AC/DC) equipped with variable gauge axles. This allows the units to be used on high-speed lines and on conventional broad gauge lines. A Talgo 250 train consists of two power cars and 11 Talgo VII intermediate coaches. This class was developed for RENFE (classed as S-130). One trainset was involved in the Santiago de Compostela accident on 24 July 2013. Uzbekistan Railways ordered two Talgo 250 sets of a Russian gauge version in 2009. The first set arrived at Tashkent in July 2011. ===Talgo 250 Hybrid=== The Talgo 250 Hybrid is a dual-voltage dual-power train equipped with variable gauge axles. The train is therefore also able to operate on non-electrified lines. A Talgo 250 Hybrid train consists of two power cars, two technical end coaches and nine Talgo VII intermediate coaches. The trains were developed for RENFE and classed initially as S-130H, later as S-730). They are rebuilt from existing Talgo 250 trains. ===Talgo 350 HSR=== Talgo 350 train as used for AVE high-speed services between Madrid - Valencia The Talgo 350 entered service as the RENFE AVE Class 102 marking the company's entry into the high-speed train manufacturing market. Tests with the prototype commenced in 1994, and Talgo 350 trains have been operating at a top commercial speed of 330 km/h on the Madrid-Barcelona and Madrid-Valladolid lines since 22 December 2007. This series of trains is designed to reach a speed of , although present lines and commercial services limit the speed to . Talgo evolves its unique design for ultra high speed - High Speed: Spain, International Railway Journal, 1 October 2002 The train consists of two power cars and Talgo VII intermediate cars with improved brakes and additional primary suspension. ===Talgo XXI HSR=== RENFE class 355 / Talgo XXI / Talgo BT Talgo XXI is a project for a high speed diesel-powered train, that operates in push-pull with one or two power cars and Talgo VII intermediate cars. The North American version has four-axle power cars in compliance with United States FRA regulations. Only one train in compliance with European UIC standards has been built to date. Talgo reported that the Talgo XXI attained 256 km/h on the Olmedo-Medina del Campo high speed experimental line on 9 July 2002, which led to a claim for the world speed record for a diesel train. However, this claim was never proven. After the test runs the train was sold to the Spanish infrastructure authority ADIF as a measuring train for high speed lines. Possible specs are: * Two MTU 12V 4000 R64 engines (two power cars configuration) or one MTU 12V 4000 R84 engine (one power car configuration), up to 1.800 rpm, high speed diesel, Euro IIIB compliant with diesel particulate filter and exhaust gas recirculation aftertreatment system * 2x1.500 kW (3 MW) or 1x1.800 kW power ratings * Voith hydraulic transmission * Hydrodynamic and air braking * Variable gauge * 5 to 12 passenger coaches, depending on the setup * Up to 400 seats * Designed for a top speed of 220 km/h (135 mph) * Power car with shared trailer axle ===Talgo AVRIL HSR=== Talgo AVRIL in the International Exhibition InnoTrans, Germany 2012 Talgo has developed recently a train known as \"AVRIL\" (Alta Velocidad Rueda Independiente Ligero \u2014 Light High-Speed Independent Wheel), intended for speeds of . The system uses underfloor traction in the front and rear vehicles, with the intermediate carriages having the Talgo Pendular system (which cannot use motored axles on the axles corresponding to the system). Starting with the concept stage in 2009, it began dynamic testing on the Spanish high-speed network in 2014, and was approved in May 2016. It won its first major contract in November 2016, for the Mediterranean corridor in Spain, and its link to Paris. ==Variable Gauge Axles (VGA)== In addition to the multiple units with Variable Gauge Axles, Talgo built in 2005 a prototype of a VGA locomotive (the L-9202, TRAV-CA, 130-901 or Virgen del Buen Camino). ==See also== *Amtrak Cascades *Articulated car *EMD LWT12 *FM P-12-42 *Tilting train *UAC TurboTrain *Wheelset (railroad) *Haramain High Speed Rail Project ==References== ==External links== *Talgo official Site *Talgo America Web site (English) *Talgo Deutschland *Interactive 360\u00b0 panoramas of the interiors of Talgo 7, Avril, Talgo 4 cama, Talgo 6 (DB) Category:Railway companies of Spain Category:Articulated passenger trains Category:Rolling stock manufacturers of Spain Category:Rolling stock innovations Category:Spanish brands Category:Rail infrastructure manufacturers ",
