    "text": "J\u00e1n Kuciak (17 May 1990 \u2013 21 February 2018) was a Slovak investigative journalist. Kuciak worked as a reporter for the news website Aktuality.sk, focused mainly on investigating tax fraud of several businessmen with connections to top-level Slovak politicians. He and his fianc\u00e9e, Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1, were shot dead in February 2018 in their home in Ve\u013ek\u00e1 Ma\u010da, Galanta District, Slovakia. Kuciak was the first journalist murdered in Slovakia since the country's independence. The murders caused shock and disbelief throughout the country, sparking mass popular protests and a political crisis, with the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico on one side, and President Andrej Kiska and opposition parties on the other. The crisis culminated on 15 March with the resignation of Prime Minister Fico and his entire cabinet, followed by the forming of a new cabinet led by Peter Pellegrini. According to the prosecution's indictment, a well-known businessman Marian Ko\u010dner tasked Alena Zsuzsov\u00e1 with arranging Kuciak's murder, with which she in turn tasked Zolt\u00e1n Andrusk\u00f3, who ordered Tom\u00e1\u0161 Szab\u00f3 and Miroslav Mar\u010dek to carry out the murder. On 3 September 2020, a first- degree court acquitted Ko\u010dner and Zsuzsov\u00e1 of involvement in the murders. The prosecutor appealed against the ruling and the case is to be reviewed by the Supreme Court. Zolt\u00e1n Andrusk\u00f3, a businessman from Chot\u00edn, admitted to ordering the murder, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Mar\u010dek, a former soldier, admitted to shooting Kuciak and Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1 and was sentenced by a first-degree court to 23 years in prison. His cousin Tom\u00e1\u0161 Szab\u00f3, a former policeman, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for participating in the murder. == Background == Murdered journalist J\u00e1n Kuciak J\u00e1n Kuciak was born on 17 May 1990 in the village of \u0160tiavnik in Byt\u010da District. He studied and graduated with a master's degree in journalism at the University of Constantine the Philosopher in Nitra, where he continued his studies as a postgraduate student in the field of mass media communication. While working on his PhD, he also held a teaching position at the same faculty. He later started to work for the newspaper Hospod\u00e1rske noviny, before taking up a position in the editorial office of Aktuality.sk, primarily as an investigative journalist. He particularly focused on cases of tax evasion, including ones related to the then-ruling party Direction - Social Democracy headed by PM Robert Fico. He had previously written about companies with unclear ownership as well as suspected systemic embezzlement from European Union funds. The most prominent subject of his articles was a well-known businessman Marian Ko\u010dner, who first became known in Slovakia in 1998 due to his unsuccessful attempt to take over the private television news network TV Mark\u00edza with the help of the Slovak Intelligence Service (SIS). In his June 2017 articles, Kuciak described several discrepancies in the halted investigation of a case involving Ko\u010dner and the suspicious transfers of his hotels in Donovaly, which resulted in a \u20ac8 million VAT refund in 2010-2012. On 5 September 2017, Ko\u010dner phoned Kuciak and confronted him over his journalistic work, using profanity towards him and saying that he would start gathering damaging information specifically about him and his whole family. Two days later Kuciak filed a complaint against Ko\u010dner for threats and was only officially spoken to about the issue by the police after more than a month. Ko\u010dner was accused of tax and insurance premiums evasion in the Donovaly case in late September 2017. In his December 2017 article, Kuciak pointed to suspicious activity in a legal case in which Ko\u010dner\u2019s firm IIDH was suing Unipharma, a pharmaceutical distribution company, and its subsidiary for \u20ac45 million. In response to Kuciak\u2019s activity, the Ministry of Justice started investigation into the actions of the judge involved in the case. In the last article published before his death, Kuciak wrote about suspicious transactions in the Bratislava apartment building Five Star Residence involving Ko\u010dner. According to the article, 19 apartments were sold to and from five different firms fully or partially controlled by Ko\u010dner at least twice, which raised questions about possible tax-related criminal activity. == Death == House of J\u00e1n Kuciak and Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1 in Ve\u013ek\u00e1 Ma\u010da At the time of his death, Kuciak was 27 years old. He lived in the village of Ve\u013ek\u00e1 Ma\u010da, about 65 km (40 miles) east of the capital Bratislava. On the morning of 26 February 2018, police were called to his home by family members after the couple had not answered phone calls for more than four days. Kuciak's fianc\u00e9e, Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1, usually spoke with her mother on a daily basis. Her mother stated that she last spoke with her daughter in the afternoon of 21 February. When she tried to contact her again that evening, there was no reply. The family stated that Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1's cellphone appeared to switch off three days later, probably due to a dead battery. Police entering the house found Kuciak and Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1 shot dead. Kuciak had been shot twice in the chest, while Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1 had been shot once in the head from the front. Both were shot at close range with a 9 mm caliber handgun. There was no evidence of a struggle and nothing appeared to have been stolen. Police found two empty cartridges at the crime scene as well as several unused bullets. The murders were initially believed to have been committed sometime between February 22 and 25, but were subsequently suspected to have taken place in the evening of February 21. == Reactions == Protest in 297x297pxThe murders sent shockwaves throughout Slovakia. The day after the news broke, gatherings were held around the country in tribute. Candles were lit at the Slovak National Uprising Square in Bratislava and in front of the editorial office of Aktuality.sk, where Kuciak worked. Similar gatherings were also organised in the Czech cities of Prague and Brno. President Andrej Kiska stated that he was \"shocked and horrified that something like this happened in Slovakia\". The President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani called on Slovakia to launch a thorough investigation, offering international support if needed, adding that \"the European Parliament will not rest until justice is done\". Ringier Axel Springer, the parent company of Aktuality.sk, called the murders a \"cruel assassination\", vowing to redouble their journalistic efforts.alt= === Protests === 298x298px On Friday 2 March, up to 25,000 people gathered in Bratislava to commemorate the murdered couple. On 9 March, protests were held in 48 towns and cities in Slovakia as well as 17 other cities around the world. In Bratislava alone, about 60,000 people held a protest march, the biggest turnout of any demonstration since the Velvet Revolution in 1989. The protests were endorsed by several universities in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, teachers, school associations, artists and non-governmental organizations. 21 universities cancelled afternoon lectures to allow students and employees to attend the protests. Two days after Prime Minister Fico's resignation, an even larger demonstration was held in Bratislava with over 65,000 people participating under slogans such as \"Enough of Smer\" and \"Early elections\". Former Speaker of Parliament and ex-presidential candidate Franti\u0161ek Miklo\u0161ko made an impassioned speech during the protest saying that \"the revolution started by the parents has to be finished by their children\". He argued that only twice in the history of post-war Czechoslovakia have popular protests managed to make the government resign: in November 1989 and now, adding that \"when somebody tries to abuse their power in the future, they should remember March 2018 and the mass protests\". Miklo\u0161ko's speech was accompanied by the ringing of keys, reminiscent of the Velvet Revolution in 1989. == Investigation == In a press conference the same morning, Slovak Police President Tibor Ga\u0161par stated that the murders \"likely have something to do with [Kuciak\u2019s] investigative activities\". The Government of Slovakia offered \u20ac1 million for information leading to the murderers. Prime Minister Robert Fico made the announcement during a press conference with Interior Minister Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k and Police President Tibor Ga\u0161par. During the press conference, described by critics as \"surreal\" and \"bizarre\", they displayed packs of banknotes amounting to one million euros, which the government promised to give to anyone who came forward with relevant information that could help explain the murder. Furthermore, Prime Minister Fico announced the creation of an inter-agency task force involving employees of the General Prosecutor's Office, Special Prosecutor's Office, the Interior Ministry and the SIS in attempting to solve the case. At the time of his murder, Kuciak was working on a report about Slovak connections with the Italian organized crime syndicate 'Ndrangheta. He had previously reported on organized tax fraud involving businesspeople close to the ruling Smer-SD party. On 28 February, Aktuality.sk published Kuciak's last, unfinished story. The article details the activities of Italian businessmen with ties to organised crime who have settled in eastern Slovakia, and have spent years embezzling European Union funds intended for the development of this relatively poor region, as well as their connections to high-ranking state officials, such as Viliam Jasa\u0148, a deputy and the Secretary of the State Security Council of Slovakia, or M\u00e1ria Tro\u0161kov\u00e1, a former nude model who became Chief Adviser of Prime Minister Robert Fico. Both Jasa\u0148 and Tro\u0161kov\u00e1 took leave of absence on the same day, stating that they would return to their positions once the investigations were concluded. === Initial arrests === On 1 March, four days after the discovery of the murders, heavily armed units from the Slovak Police Corps' elite National Crime Agency (NAKA) raided several locations in eastern Slovakia, in the cities of Michalovce and Trebi\u0161ov. Antonino Vadal\u00e0, an Italian businessman mentioned in Kuciak's report, was detained along with his two brothers Sebastiano and Bruno, as well as his cousin Pietro Caprotta and several other men of Italian origin. All the detained men were released from custody after 48 hours, due to lack of sufficient evidence. On the day of the arrests, General Prosecutor Jarom\u00edr \u010ci\u017en\u00e1r ordered the police to give no further updates to the press or the public regarding the investigation. Vadal\u00e0 was rearrested on 13 March, this time due to an international warrant issued by the Italian police. According to the arrest warrant, Vadal\u00e0 is suspected of drug trafficking as well as money laundering. Among other offences, he was said to have been planning to import large quantities of cocaine from South America. On 23 April, Slovakia approved Italy's request for extradition. As a result of their investigation into the murder, the Slovak police stated that Kuciak had been murdered because of his work as an investigative journalist, and that the murder was a contract killing. === Arrests made in September === On 17 September 2018 the prosecutor published a facial composite (identikit) of a person who allegedly could have been involved in the assassination, or may have information about people closely connected to the crime. The prosecutor added that the murder had been carried out by professionals as a contract killing. A man from Ve\u013ek\u00e1 Ma\u010da named Marek claiming to know the person from the image was subsequently questioned by police. He said it was his former colleague Miroslav \u010c., then living in Ostrava, who told the media that he did not understand why he was on the identikit. Marian Ko\u010dner On 27 September 2018, heavily-armed elite forces from the National Crime Agency (NAKA) arrested eight suspects in Kol\u00e1rovo. Three of them, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Szab\u00f3, Miroslav Mar\u010dek, and Zolt\u00e1n Andrusk\u00f3, were charged with the murder and other crimes, and the others were released. Minister Denisa Sakov\u00e1 announced that around 200 individuals had been questioned in relation to the murder. The attorney of J\u00e1n Kuciak's family, Daniel Lip\u0161ic, commented that \"the scale of the investigation, even with help of Europol and other foreign investigative organisations, was unprecedented\". On Friday 28 September 2018, Alena Zsuzsov\u00e1 was also arrested in relation to the murder, and became the fourth person to be charged with the murder. It became clear that releasing the identikit was a tactical move by the police. The man pictured was related to one of the accused and after the identikit was released the suspects started to communicate more intensively. On 30 September 2018 the prosecution's motion to take all four accused into custody was approved by the Specialized Criminal Court in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica. === Subsequent investigation === On 4 October 2018, L\u00edvia K\u0148a\u017e\u00edkov\u00e1, the attorney of Zolt\u00e1n Andrusk\u00f3, confirmed that he was cooperating with police, and had named Marian Ko\u010dner as the individual ordering the killing. On 14 March 2019, Ko\u010dner was charged with ordering the murder. At the time, Ko\u010dner was already in custody in relation to the case of forging of promissory notes involving TV Mark\u00edza. On 11 April 2019, Miroslav Mar\u010dek told police that he was the one who shot Kuciak and Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1, which disproved an earlier theory that Szab\u00f3 was the shooter and Mar\u010dek the driver. == Political crisis == The same day the murder was announced, Prime Minister Fico called on the political opposition not to \"exploit\" the situation. Meanwhile, a number of opposition politicians accused the ruling Smer-SD party of indirect involvement. Member of Parliament Veronika Remi\u0161ov\u00e1, from the opposition O\u013daNO party, compared the killings to the infamous murder of R\u00f3bert Remi\u00e1\u0161, a police officer who was assassinated in 1996, in an act widely believed to have been a contract killing by the Slovak mafia on the orders of Prime Minister Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar. On 27 February, Freedom and Solidarity and OL'aNO demanded the resignation of Interior Minister Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k and Police President Tibor Ga\u0161par. Protest in Bratislava, 9 March 2018 Interior Minister Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k speaking with Prime Minister Robert Fico The crisis escalated on 4 March when President Kiska made a live broadcast on state television, warning the government against further polarising the country. He called for either a \"radical cabinet reshuffle\" or a snap election. Kiska's speech infuriated Fico, who accused him of \"joining the opposition\". Furthermore, he accused the president of conspiring with Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros in the planning of a coup d'etat, based on the fact that President Kiska met with Soros at Soros' apartment in New York City in September 2017, ostensibly to discuss issues related to the Roma minority. On 28 February, two days after the news of Kuciak's murder broke, Minister of Culture Marek Ma\u010fari\u010d announced his resignation. Announcing his decision to the press, Madaric stated that \"as a culture minister, I can't cope with the fact that a journalist was killed during my tenure.\" Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k, Minister of the Interior and Deputy Prime Minister, resigned on 12 March 2018 after weeks of mounting pressure. The Most-H\u00edd party, the junior coalition partner in the government, had demanded the resignation of Kali\u0148\u00e1k in exchange for continued support of Smer-SD. The next day, Most-H\u00edd joined the calls for snap elections, announcing that it would leave the government if it failed to reach a deal with its two coalition partners, Smer-SD and the Slovak National Party (SNS). Most-H\u00edd Chairman, B\u00e9la Bug\u00e1r, announced the decision after an eight- hour session of the Most-Hid Republican Council, the party's decision-making body. === Fico resigns === On 14 March, following a meeting with President Kiska, Prime Minister Fico announced that he would resign to avoid early elections and \"solve the political crisis\". During the meeting, Fico laid out a number of specific conditions to be met by the President in order for him to resign, including that the result of the 2016 Slovak parliamentary election be respected, that the current ruling government coalition must continue, and that Smer-SD, as the largest party in parliament, would name the next prime minister. Fico stated that he already had a candidate in mind, widely reported in Slovak media as Deputy Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini. On 15 March, President Kiska formally accepted the resignation of Fico and his cabinet, and tasked Pellegrini with the forming of a new government. === Continued protests === On 22 March 2018, President Andrej Kiska appointed a new cabinet led by Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Drucker, former Minister of Health, was appointed Minister of Interior. Protest organisers announced on the same day via Facebook that they were cancelling the upcoming \"For a Decent Slovakia\" protest, and that they were forming a civic platform while closely watching the new government's next steps. Three days later they announced that if Drucker did not remove Police President Tibor Ga\u0161par from office, protests would start again. On 28 March, they announced further protests. Around 30,000 people protested in Bratislava on 5 April. Drucker resigned on 16 April, saying that after a three-week assessment he did not agree with dismissing Ga\u0161par, and would not remain as minister if it polarized society. The next day, Pellegrini and Ga\u0161par announced that they agreed that Ga\u0161par would step down at the end of May in order to calm the tensions. On 26 April President Kiska appointed Denisa Sakov\u00e1 Minister of Interior. After Ga\u0161par's departure, Milan Lu\u010dansk\u00fd became acting Police President, before being confirmed on 15 April 2019. == Trials and sentencing == On 30 December 2019, one of the accused, Zolt\u00e1n Andrusk\u00f3, was sentenced to 15 years in prison after striking a deal with prosecutors. Andrusk\u00f3 pleaded guilty to all charges against him, and agreed to be a witness for the prosecution in the trials of the other defendants. Due to his cooperation with the murder investigation, the prosecutor proposed a reduction in his sentence from a possible 25 years to life in prison to 10 years, though this was rejected by the court. The court requested a sentence of 15 years in prison, which Andrusk\u00f3 accepted. His prison sentence began the same day.Rozsudok nad Zolt\u00e1nom Andrusk\u00f3om (zvukov\u00fd z\u00e1znam) The trial of Marian Ko\u010dner, Alena Zsuzsov\u00e1, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Szab\u00f3 and Miroslav Mar\u010dek began on 13 January 2020.Vra\u017eda J\u00e1na Kuciaka a Martiny Ku\u0161n\u00edrovej: S\u00fad prijal ob\u017ealobu, hlavn\u00e9 pojedn\u00e1vanie sa za\u010dne 13. janu\u00e1ra The 2016 murder of Peter Moln\u00e1r, a businessman from Kol\u00e1rovo, was included in the case. On the first day of the trial, Mar\u010dek confessed to killing Kuciak and Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1, and also admitted to killing Moln\u00e1r during a violent burglary in 2016. On the second day of the trial, Andrusk\u00f3 testified against all four defendants. On 6 April 2020, Mar\u010dek was sentenced to 23 years in prison. The prosecutor appealed against the sentence. In a verdict delivered on 3 September 2020, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Szab\u00f3 was found guilty of involvement in the murder of Kuciak and Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1, the murder of Peter Moln\u00e1r, and of unauthorised carrying of weapons. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Marian Ko\u010dner was found guilty of unauthorised carrying of weapons and given a fine of \u20ac5,000. Ko\u010dner and Alena Zsuzsov\u00e1 were acquitted of charges related to the murders of Kuciak and Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1. The court stated that their involvement in the murders was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. The court explained its verdict by stating that not a single piece of direct evidence was put forward against Ko\u010dner, with the indictment being built on a series of circumstantial evidence; the only direct evidence against Zsuzsov\u00e1 was the testimony of Zolt\u00e1n Andrusk\u00f3. The prosecutor appealed against the court's ruling to acquit Ko\u010dner and Zsuzsov\u00e1. Ko\u010dner remains in prison, having been sentenced by a first-degree court to 19 years in a case of forging of promissory notes involving TV Mark\u00edza. Zsuzsov\u00e1 was released and immediately arrested, as she is charged with involvement in the attempted murders of prosecutor Maro\u0161 \u017dilinka, prosecutor Peter \u0160ufliarsky and Daniel Lip\u0161ic. On 5 September 2020, the Specialized Criminal Court in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica ordered custody for Zsuzsov\u00e1. Various public officials (domestic and international), media representatives, and organizations reacted negatively to this ruling. President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 said on Facebook that she was shocked by the verdict and needed to understand its explanation, and that she respects it but expects that the case will not end and will continue to the Supreme Court. Prime Minister Igor Matovi\u010d stated on Facebook: \"It seems that for now the apparent instigators of the murder would like to slip out of the clutches of justice\u2026 Let\u2019s believe that justice will wait for them both.\" == Awards and legacy == J\u00e1n Kuciak was given various awards: Special Award of the Journalism Award 2017 and the Investigative Journalism Fund at the Open Society Foundation, in memoriam.
