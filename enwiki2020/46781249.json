    "text": "In algebra, a differential graded module, or dg-module, is a \\mathbb{Z}-graded module together with a differential; i.e., a square-zero graded endomorphism of the module of degree 1 or \u22121, depending on the convention. In other words, it is a chain complex having a structure of a module, while a differential graded algebra is a chain complex with a structure of an algebra. In view of the module-variant of Dold\u2013Kan correspondence, the notion of an \\mathbb{N}_0-graded dg-module is equivalent to that of a simplicial module; \"equivalent\" in the categorical sense; see #The Dold\u2013Kan correspondence below. == The Dold\u2013Kan correspondence == Given a commutative ring R, by definition, the category of simplicial modules are simplicial objects in the category of modules over R; denoted by sModR. Then the category can be identified with the category of differential graded modules. == See also == *Differential graded Lie algebra == References == * *H. Cartan, S.
