    "text": "My Home's in Alabama is the fourth studio album by American country band Alabama, released in May 1980 on RCA Nashville, their breakthrough album. The title track pays homage to Alabama's southern rock roots. It reached No. 17 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in early 1980. Two other tracks \u2014 the fiddle-heavy, southern rock-influenced \"Tennessee River\" and the ballad \"Why Lady Why\" \u2014 were the band's first two No. 1 songs, and laid the foundation for what became one of the most impressive popularity runs in country music history. Also included on My Home's In Alabama is the band's 1979 single, \"I Wanna Come Over\", which peaked at No. 33 in November 1979. Both that song and the better-known title track were originally issued by MDJ Records, before the band was signed to RCA in early 1980. The album eventually became the group's first major-label album to be distributed by RCA Records in Nashville. After this when their major-label debut album was released, Alabama would go on and record more new albums at the RCA Records label for the rest of their career. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Alabama=== *Randy Owen - lead vocals and rhythm guitar *Teddy Gentry - bass guitar and vocals *Jeff Cook - lead guitar, keyboards, fiddle and vocals, lead vocals on \"Some Other Place, Some Other Time\" and \"Keep On Dreamin'\" *Mark Herndon - drums (Track 2) ===Other musicians=== CREDITED: *Jack Eubanks - acoustic guitar (Tracks 4, 6) *Sonny Garrish - steel guitar (Tracks 5, 6, 7) *David Humphreys - drums (Tracks 4) *Leo Jackson - acoustic guitar (Tracks 4, 6) *Terry McMillan - Harmonica (Track 1) *Fred Newell - guitar (Tracks 4, 6) *Willie Rainsford - keyboards (Tracks 1, 4, 6) *Billy Reynolds - guitar (Tracks 4, 6) *David Smith - bass guitar (Tracks 4, 6) *Strings arranged by Kristin Wilkinson and performed by \"The Wire Choir\".
