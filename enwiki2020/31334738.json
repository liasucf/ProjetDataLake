He was also an author of several musicals produced on the radio and staged at the biggest theatres in Latvia, script writer (author of several scripts, one short-length film is produced) wrote much for children (poems, prose, plays), author of song texts (in collaboration with the composer Raimonds Pauls texts for appr. 150 songs), translated 10 plays staged at Latvian theatres and rendered in verse opera librettos (e.g., the opera by B. Britten \"The Small Chimney-Sweep\"). ==Early life== After graduating the Sigulda Secondary School in 1968 he entered the Latvian State University, Day Department of the Latvian Language and Literature Faculty from which he was expelled in 1970 because of anti-Soviet activity without any right to acquire higher education within the territory of the former Soviet Union. Despite this, in 1972 Leons Briedis entered the Day Department of Spanish Language and Literature at the University of Chi\u015fin\u0103u in the Moldavian Republic which in 1974 he was forced to leave due to his links with Moldavian and Romanian democratically minded intelligentsia. From 1977 to 1979 he studied at the Higher Literary Courses of Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow the theory of translation and Africanistics. L. Briedis for a long time has experienced the pressure of the Central Committee of the Latvian Communist Party and the VDK (KGB) of Latvian SSR which was manifested as prohibition to publish his works for a certain period, to travel abroad or to take up an employment of ideological character (namely, in publishing houses, schools, editorial offices etc.). ==Family== Leons Briedis was married to Maria Briede-Macovei, whom he met in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, Moldova. They had two sons. ==Later life== Leons Briedis published about 34 books of his own (poetry, prose, essays) as well as 49 books of translations. His poetry books are published in Russian, Romanian and Ukrainian languages, but in general his poetry is translated in practically all languages of Europe and nations of the former Soviet Union as well as many Asian languages (Turkish, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, Kirghiz, Uzbek).
