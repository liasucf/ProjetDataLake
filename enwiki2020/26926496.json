Its main focus is conservation of endangered sea turtle species in the Indian Ocean, particularly in the Bay of Bengal, where recent netting operations have proven disastrous for these precious creatures. ==History== HSTA was founded by Shalini Subramanium. ==Events== HSTA hosted a Live Earth Run for Water in New Delhi on 18 April 2010. The event provided participants with educational material on the water crisis as it relates to humans and the environment as well as the plight of sea turtles, but was criticized as \"greenwashing\" for sponsor Union Carbide. ==References== *https://web.archive.org/web/20100515233015/http://www.joinliveearth.org/page/event/detail/friendsofliveearth/4jjdl *http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/campaigns/oceans/wildlife-facts/sea-turtle *Exploitation of Marine Turtles in the Indian Ocean.
