    "text": "Civic Tower at Pavia cathedral before its collapse The Civic Tower was built in the Italian city of Pavia in the 11th century, next to Pavia Cathedral. Built to a rectangular footprint, it was high. Between 1583 and 1585 the architect Pellegrino Tibaldi led works to add a room at the top of the tower to house the cathedral's bells, which it did until it was moved to a campanile of the Cathedral. On , at 8:55a.m., the Civic Tower collapsed, leaving of brick, sand and granite rubble. The collapse killed four people and injured fifteen. It has not been rebuilt, though some elements from it are now on display at the city's Castello Visconteo. After the tower's collapse, the Italian government closed the Leaning Tower of Pisa on over concerns that the popular tourist site may also be at risk of collapse.
