    "text": "Leivur \u00d8ssursson or Leif \u00d8ssursson (born ca. 980 - died before 1047) was a chieftain in the Faroe Islands, before they were taken over by Norway in 1035. Leivur's reign marked the beginning of the end of the Viking age, and the end of independence in the Faeroes. Leivur \u00d8ssursson was the son of \u00d8ssur Havgr\u00edmsson. It is unclear when and where Leivur was born, but we know that it was before 983 when his father died at the age of 23. His birthplace was possibly Nor\u00f0rag\u00f8ta, where his father lived with Tr\u00f3ndur \u00ed G\u00f8tu in Hov. His father owned a farm at Sk\u00favoy and other farms at Brestir and Beinir. He was married to T\u00f3ra Sigmundard\u00f3ttir, the daughter of Sigmundur Brestisson and Turi\u00f0 Torkilsd\u00f3ttir. In 1024, King Olaf II of Norway invited some of the chieftains of the Faroes, including T\u00f3rolvur Sigmundsson and Leivur \u00d8ssursson, to travel to Norway to become his deputies. However, as long as Tr\u00f3ndur \u00ed G\u00f8tu lived, it was clear that King Olaf would not have full control of the Faroes. After Tr\u00f3ndur \u00ed G\u00f8tu's death in 1035, King Magnus Olafsson claimed control of the Faeroes. By the latter half of the 12th century, the Faroe Islands became firmly attached to the Kingdom of Norway. ==References== Category:11th-century Faroese people Category:1047 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of birth uncertain ",
