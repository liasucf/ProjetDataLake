He also for clubs like Newell's Old Boys, Fiorentina and Colo-Colo and he is nicknamed Terremoto (Earthquake in English). ==Career== Cejas began his career in 1994 in his native country Argentina, where he appeared in 170 games and scored six goals for Newell's Old Boys. From there he was transferred to Roma in 2001. While with Newell's Old Boys, Cejas was a regular with the first team. That was not the case while he was with Roma, where he never appeared in a match. Cejas was loaned out to the than Serie B club Siena, where he appeared in the last seventeen games of the season. From there he was transferred to a Serie B club Ascoli. There he appeared in 35 games and scored a rare goal for goalkeeper in Italian football. Cejas was then sold to another Serie B squad Fiorentina. Prior to his arrival, Fiorentina had gained promotion from Serie C2 to Serie C1. However, because of Caso Catania, Fiorentina gained promotion to Serie B. Cejas than helped complete the remarkable comeback of Fiorentina to Serie A. He appeared in 55 league games with the club before being sold to Empoli. On 25 January 2006, Fiorentina acquired goalkeeper Gianluca Berti from Empoli in exchange for Cejas. However he only appeared in six games with Empoli before asking the club to terminate his contract. Cejas was upset that he had been dropped from the first team squad. After Colo-Colo won the 2006 Apertura Championship in Chile, their goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, made a move to La Liga club Real Sociedad, leaving them without a goalkeeper. Colo-Colo then signed Cejas as a replacement and has since been a regular with the first team and appeared in the Copa Sudamericana 2006 with the club.
