His grandfather Nelson was both a direct descendant of the holders of the kingship of the Thembu people and heir to the chieftaincy of Mvezo in his own right. The latter dignity is currently held by Ndaba's elder half-brother Mandla. This notwithstanding, Ndaba grew up in what can be called a broken home. His father Makgatho Mandela grew up without a father. Nelson Mandela was imprisoned while his family was growing up, and he became a street hustler in Soweto. After Ndaba was born his family moved to the Eastern Cape. He spent the first years of his schooling in a small town called Cofimvaba. He was seven years old when he met his grandfather Nelson Mandela. Mandela had been imprisoned on Robben Island. Ndaba was eleven years old when he went to live with his grandfather. He spent two decades living with him - being cared for, and then caring for his grandfather. In the Xhosa culture boys between ages of 18 and 21 are taken to the mountains to be circumcised. Ndaba was 21 years of age when he was circumcised. They are taught their roles and responsibilities in becoming men. Roles and responsibilities that entail getting married, being a husband, a father, and having your own home. ==Career== Ndaba majored in political science and international relations at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. He has worked for the Japanese Embassy as a political consultant. Africa Rising was founded to promote a positive image of Africa. Ndaba was featured in an online post by BET in which he spoke about his foundation, Africa Rising. Ndaba says his foundation aims to publicise a positive image of Africa through programming, films, media and social interaction, to change the mindset of young Africans and the world at large. In 2014 Ndaba was named one of the \"28 Men of Change\", by BET. The Men of Change is in honor of America's Black History month. It honors Black men that have excelled in industries or projects that promote black brilliance. He published his first book in June 2018. The book is titled, \"Going to the Mountain: Life Lessons from My Grandfather, Nelson Mandela. He says that his grandfather taught him to create their own legacies and to give back to society. Ndaba says about his book, Going to the Mountain: Life Lessons from My Grandfather, that he has taken the life lessons that his grandfather taught him and some of his own to relate to a younger audience. So that people can understand his grandfather's values. In 2018 Ndaba has partnered with Prince Harry, and Sir Elton John to launch a campaign to raise awareness about HIV and AIDS. They kicked off the global campaign at the 22nd International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. In an interview with the Hill at the Library of Congress, June 2018, Ndaba is quoted as saying why he wrote the book, \u201cI wanted people to know Nelson Mandela outside of being a statesman, outside of being this great iconic leader that they know and just to know him at the human level as a granddad.\" ==Quotes== \"We have to break down the misconceptions that exist surrounding Africa. Africa is not just a place of war, poverty, disease and dictators. Africa is the birthplace of humanity.\" \"I don't always have his patience. I could never have spent 27 years in prison and then forgiven my enemies the way he did. But I learned so much from him and I believe he saw a good man in me. I may not be able to walk in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela, but we can all walk in his light.\" \u201cThe world looks up to South Africa a lot as a country that is expected to stand on a pedestal of values and morality, because we are a country that produced this great international icon. But granddad always taught us to create our own legacies.\u201d Ndaba Mandela ==References== ==External links== *Ndaba Mandela reflects on grandfather\u2019s legacy *Nelson Mandela's obituary read by his grandson *Mandela sees grandson reclaim family's traditional leadership role *Why Africa Rising: Ndaba Mandela at TEDxTeen Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:People from Soweto Category:Xhosa people Category:South African writers Category:21st-century South African writers Category:South African male writers ",
