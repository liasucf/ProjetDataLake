    "text": "Charles Louis de Saulces de Freycinet (; 14 November 1828 \u2013 14 May 1923) was a French statesman and four times Prime Minister during the Third Republic. He also served an important term as Minister of War (1888\u201393). He belonged to the Opportunist Republicans faction. He was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences, and in 1890, the fourteenth member to occupy a seat in the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Freycinet was born at Foix (Ari\u00e8ge) of a Protestant family and was the nephew of Louis de Freycinet, a French navigator. Charles Freycinet was educated at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. He entered government service as a mining engineer (see X-Mines). In 1858 he was appointed traffic manager to the Compagnie de chemins de fer du Midi, a post in which he showed a remarkable talent for organization, and in 1862 returned to the engineering service, attaining in 1886 the rank of inspector-general. He was sent on several special scientific missions, including one to the United Kingdom, on which he wrote a notable M\u00e9moire sur le travail des femmes et des enfants dans les manufactures de l'Angleterre (1867). ===Government service === ===Franco-Prussian War=== In July 1870 the Franco-Prussian War started which led to the fall of the Second French Empire of Napoleon III. On the establishment of the Third Republic in September 1870, he offered his services to L\u00e9on Gambetta, was appointed prefect of the department of Tarn-et- Garonne, and in October became chief of the military cabinet. It was mainly Freycinet's powers of organization which enabled Gambetta to raise army after army to oppose the invading Germans. He revealed himself to be a competent strategist, but the policy of dictating operations to the generals in the field was not attended with happy results. The friction between him and General d'Aurelle de Paladines resulted in the loss of the advantage temporarily gained at Coulmiers and Orl\u00e9ans, and he was responsible for the campaign in the east, which ended in the destruction of the Arm\u00e9e de l'Est of Charles Denis Bourbaki. ===1871-1888=== In 1871 he published a defence of his administration under the title of La Guerre en province pendant le si\u00e8ge de Paris. He entered the Senate in 1876 as a follower of Gambetta, and in December 1877 became Minister of Public Works in the cabinet of Jules Armand Stanislaus Dufaure. He passed a great scheme for the gradual acquisition of the railways by the state and the construction of new lines at a cost of three milliards, and for the development of the canal system at a further cost of one milliard. He retained his post in the ministry of William Henry Waddington, whom he succeeded in December 1879 as Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs. He passed an amnesty for the Communards, but in attempting to steer a middle course (between the Catholics and the anti- clericalists) on the question of the religious associations, he lost Gambetta's support, and resigned in September 1880. In January 1882 he again became Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. His refusal to join Britain in the bombardment of Alexandria was the death-knell of French influence in Egypt. He attempted to compromise by occupying the Isthmus of Suez, but the vote of credit was rejected in the Chamber by 417 votes to 75, and the ministry resigned. He returned to office in April 1885 as Foreign Minister in Henri Brisson's cabinet, and retained that post when, in January 1886, he succeeded to the premiership. He came to power with an ambitious programme of internal reform; but apart from settling the question of the exiled pretenders, his successes were chiefly in the sphere of colonial extension. In spite of his unrivalled skill as a parliamentary tactician, he failed to keep his party together, and was defeated on 3 December 1886. In the following year, after two unsuccessful attempts to construct new ministries, he stood for the Presidency of the Republic; but the radicals, to whom his opportunism was distasteful, turned the scale against him by transferring the votes to Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot. ====Minister of War==== In April 1888 he became Minister of War in Charles Floquet's cabinet \u2014 the first civilian since 1848 to hold that office. His services to France in this capacity were the crowning achievement of his life, and he enjoyed the conspicuous honour of holding his office without a break for five years through as many successive administrations \u2014 those of Floquet and Pierre Tirard, his own fourth ministry (March 1890 \u2013 February 1892), and the \u00c9mile Loubet and Alexandre Ribot ministries. The introduction of the three-years' service and the establishment of a general staff, a supreme council of war, and the army commands were all due to him. His premiership was marked by heated debates on the clerical question, and it was a hostile vote on his bill against the religious associations that caused the fall of his cabinet. He failed to clear himself entirely of complicity in the Panama scandals, and in January 1893 resigned the Ministry of War. In November 1898 he once again became Minister of War in the Charles Dupuy cabinet, but resigned office on 6 May 1899. ===Prime Minister of France=== Guth in Vanity Fair, April 1891 ====1st Ministry==== * Charles de Freycinet \u2013 President of the Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs * Jean Joseph Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Farre \u2013 Minister of War * Charles Lep\u00e8re \u2013 Minister of the Interior and Worship * Pierre Magnin \u2013 Minister of Finance * Jules Cazot \u2013 Minister of Justice * Jean Bernard Jaur\u00e9guiberry \u2013 Minister of Marine and Colonies * Jules Ferry \u2013 Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts * Henri Varroy \u2013 Minister of Public Works * Adolphe Cochery \u2013 Minister of Posts and Telegraphs * Pierre Tirard \u2013 Minister of Agriculture and Commerce ; Changes * 17 May 1880 \u2013 Ernest Constans succeeds Lep\u00e8re as Minister of the Interior and Worship. ====2nd Ministry==== * Charles de Freycinet \u2013 President of the Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs * Jean-Baptiste Billot \u2013 Minister of War * Ren\u00e9 Goblet \u2013 Minister of the Interior * L\u00e9on Say \u2013 Minister of Finance * Gustave Humbert \u2013 Minister of Justice and Worship * Jean Bernard Jaur\u00e9guiberry \u2013 Minister of Marine and Colonies * Jules Ferry \u2013 Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts * Fran\u00e7ois de Mahy \u2013 Minister of Agriculture * Henri Varroy \u2013 Minister of Public Works * Adolphe Cochery \u2013 Minister of Posts and Telegraphs * Pierre Tirard \u2013 Minister of Commerce ====3rd Ministry==== * Charles de Freycinet \u2013 President of the Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs * Georges Boulanger \u2013 Minister of War * Ferdinand Sarrien \u2013 Minister of the Interior * Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot \u2013 Minister of Finance * Charles Dem\u00f4le \u2013 Minister of Justice * Th\u00e9ophile Aube \u2013 Minister of Marine and Colonies * Ren\u00e9 Goblet \u2013 Minister of Public Instruction, Fine Arts, and Worship * Jules Develle \u2013 Minister of Agriculture * Charles Ba\u00efhaut \u2013 Minister of Public Works * F\u00e9lix Granet \u2013 Minister of Posts and Telegraphs * \u00c9douard Locroy \u2013 Minister of Commerce and Industry ; Changes * 4 November 1886 \u2013 \u00c9douard Millaud succeeds Ba\u00efhaut as Minister of Public Works ====4th Ministry==== * Charles de Freycinet \u2013 President of the Council and Minister of War * Alexandre Ribot \u2013 Minister of Foreign Affairs * Ernest Constans \u2013 Minister of the Interior * Maurice Rouvier \u2013 Minister of Finance * Armand Falli\u00e8res \u2013 Minister of Justice and Worship * Jules Roche \u2013 Minister of the Colonies and of Commerce and Industry * \u00c9douard Barbey \u2013 Minister of Marine * L\u00e9on Bourgeois \u2013 Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts * Jules Develle \u2013 Minister of Agriculture * Yves Guyot \u2013 Minister of Public Works ==Publications== * Trait\u00e9 de m\u00e9canique rationnelle (1858) * De l'analyse infinit\u00e9simale (1860, revised ed., 1881) * Des pentes \u00e9conomiques en chemin de fer (1861) * Emploi des eaux d'\u00e9gout en agriculture (1869) * Principes de l'assainissement des villes (1870) * Trait\u00e9 d'assainissement industriel (1870) * Essai sur la philosophie des sciences (1896) * La Question d'\u00c9gypte (1905) * Contemporain: 'Pens\u00e9es contributed under the pseudonym of Alceste\" ==References== * ==External links== * Category:\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni Category:Mines ParisTech alumni Category:Corps des mines Category:1828 births Category:1923 deaths Category:Burials at Passy Cemetery Category:People from Foix Category:French Protestants Category:Members of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise Category:Politicians of the French Third Republic Category:Prime Ministers of France Category:Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur Category:Prefects of France Category:Prefects of Tarn-et-Garonne Category:French Ministers of War Category:19th-century Protestants Category:20th-century Protestants Category:Senators of Seine (department) ",
