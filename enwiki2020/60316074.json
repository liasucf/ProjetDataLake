    "text": "\"Fire & Forgive\" is a song by the German power metal group Powerwolf. It was a second single released from the album The Sacrament of Sin. == Music video == The music video for \"Fire & Forgive\" was filmed in the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene in \u015acinawka \u015arednia, Poland. The video tells a story of a girl in a church, who becomes possessed as the result of receiving the Blessed Sacrament from the priest. Powerwolf's vocalist Attila Dorn along with keyboardist Falk Maria Schlegel and a few nuns perform an exorcism on the girl. The video also references the Index Librorum Prohibitorum by showing monks burning confiscated books. Video's story takes place \"somewhere in southern Europe\" in 1931, although throughout the video, the viewer can see signs of it taking place in Poland (ex. a religious songbook written in Polish, or the date 966\u20131966, which is a memorial to the Millennium of Poland), where the video was recorded. === Controversy === The video was recorded in the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene in \u015acinawka \u015arednia, Poland. After releasing it on YouTube on 22 June 2018, Powerwolf was accused by the local curia that the video \"overstepped limits with regard both to the sacredness of the church as well as to the trust shown by the parish priest in charge of that holy place\". Many Polish newspapers wrote about this controversy. Most of them said that the band is satanic and anti-church. == Live performances == Attila Dorn wearing dual arm mounted flame throwers while performing \"Fire & Forgive\" The band performed \"Fire & Forgive\" for the first time at their concert at the Rockmaraton Fesztiv\u00e1l in Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros, Hungary on 11 July 2018. The song is being used as an opening track for Powerwolf's live performances since their concert at Le Bataclan, Paris, France on 25 October 2018. \"Fire & Forgive\" is played in a fast, typical Powerwolf style. While performing the song, the band uses a big amount of pyrotechnics. The vocalist Attila Dorn usually wears dual arm mounted flame throwers after the song's guitar solo. == Personnel == Powerwolf *Attila Dorn \u2013 vocals *Matthew Greywolf \u2013 lead and rhythm guitar *Charles Greywolf \u2013 bass and rhythm guitar *Roel van Helden \u2013 drums, percussion *Falk Maria Schlegel \u2013 organ, keyboards Additional musicians *Dianne van Giersbergen \u2013 vocals (additional) *Marcela Bovio \u2013 vocals (additional) *John Cuijpers \u2013 vocals (additional) *Jacobus van Bakel \u2013 vocals (additional) *Dirk Bersweiler \u2013 vocals (choir, additional) *James Boyle \u2013 vocals (choir, additional) *Manfred Flick \u2013 vocals (choir, additional) *Titan Fox \u2013 vocals (choir, additional) *Tom Kurt Germann \u2013 vocals (choir, additional) *Bj\u00f6rn Hacket \u2013 vocals (choir, additional) *Daniel Herzmann \u2013 vocals (choir, additional) *Toni Hilbert \u2013 vocals (choir, additional) *Fritz K\u00f6rber \u2013 vocals (choir, additional) *Dirk Reichel \u2013 vocals (choir, additional) *PA'dam Chamber Choir \u2013 vocals (choir) Technical personnel *Jens Bogren \u2013 producer, mixer, recording, engineer *David Buballa \u2013 recording, editing *Joost van den Broek \u2013 arrangements (orchestral, choir), recording (choir), programming, score (choir) *Maria van Nieukerken \u2013 PA'dam Chamber Choir conductor *Tony Lindgren \u2013 mastering *Jos Driessen \u2013 engineer (choir) *Linus Corneliusson \u2013 mixer, editing Other personnel *Zsofia Dankova \u2013 cover art, illustrations *Matthew Greywolf \u2013 layout *Tim Tronckoe \u2013 photography *Matteo Vdiva \u2013 photography == References == == External links == * Category:Powerwolf songs Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Napalm Records singles ",
