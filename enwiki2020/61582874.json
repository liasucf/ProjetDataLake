    "text": "Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia was a \"criminal order\" issued on 19 May 1941, during World War II. The guidelines detailed the expected behaviour of German troops during the Invasion of the Soviet Union. Civilians were included as opposition groups. The order states \"Bolshevism is the deadly enemy of the National Socialist German people. This corrosive Weltanschauung \u2013 and those who support it \u2013 are what Germany\u2019s struggle is against. This struggle demands a ruthless and strenuous crackdown on Bolshevik agitators, irregulars, saboteurs and Jews, and the complete elimination of both active and passive resistance. The Asiatic soldiers, in particular, are inscrutable, unpredictable, underhand and unfeeling\". Omer Bartov writes the Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia, detailed \"ruthless measures against Bolshevik agitators, guerrillas, saboteurs and Jews and called for the complete elimination of any active or passive resistance\". Wade Beorn writing in Marching into Darkness notes that the order targets Jews explicitly as \"racial enemies to be eliminated by the military regardless of their behavior\". ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * Category:Military history of Germany during World War II Category:Military history of the Soviet Union during World War II Category:Eastern Front (World War II) Category:Orders by Adolf Hitler Category:Nazi war crimes Category:War crimes of the Wehrmacht Category:Anti-communism in Germany Category:1941 documents Category:Nazi war crimes in Russia ",
