In the past, referees were involved in judging the fight. However, that role has been progressively replaced by a panel of judges, except for domestic fights in some countries. ==Attire== Normally, a white or blue Oxford shirt is worn, as well as black slacks, black leather shoes and a black bow tie. Latex gloves are sometimes worn for sanitary reasons. For professional matches a patch is usually worn on the left breast bearing the insignia of the organization sanctioning the fight. The referee may also wear a patch on his left sleeve bearing the flag of his home country. This is especially common in matches between fighters from two countries. ==Criticisms== The main critique involves the subjective nature of boxing refereeing; there are guidelines for referees, but enforcement of the rules still involves judgement. ==Notable referees== * Joe Cortez * Kenny Bayless * Daniel Van de Wiele refereejudge * Ruby Goldstein * Mills Lane * Arthur Mercante * Jay Nady * Randy Neumann * Richard Steele * Mickey Vann * Pete Podgorski * Joey Curtis * Octavio Meyran * Eddie Cotton * Charles Eyton * Frank Cappuccino * Steve Smoger * Jon D.
