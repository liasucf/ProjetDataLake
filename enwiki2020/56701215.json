He aims \"to draw attention to forms of invisible power that operate in the world\", believing that \"power is always problematic\" because it is inherently \"arbitrary and untransparent\".\"Biography\". Lewis Bush. Accessed 27 February 2018. Bush's The Memory of History (2012), is about Europe's forgetfulness of its unresolved past and that past's re-emergence, as evidenced in the time of the European debt crisis;Alan Knox, \"Lewis Bush: The Memory of History\". Hotshoe. Accessed 28 February 2018. The Camera Obscured (2012) is about the absurdity of security guards preventing people from photographing buildings; Metropole (2015) is \"an architectural critique on the changing face of London\"; A Model Continent (2016) is about the current state of the European Union and about its history being reduced to a tourist spectacle; War Primer 3 (2013) is a reworking of Broomberg and Chanarin's book War Primer 2; and Shadows of the State (2018) is about numbers stations.

The Week. Accessed 28 February 2018. Bush travelled through ten European Union countries to examine the effects of the European debt crisis, in the context of Europe's turbulent history of crises that are forgotten, only later to resurface. Bush intends to show that process happening again, where unresolved history is reappearing \"with the economic pain of the present\", using photographs that show \"connections between history and the present\". For The Camera Obscured (2012) he set up a camera obscura outside sensitive sites around London and used it to draw them until challenged by security guards. Bush \"attempted to engage these personnel in a discussion about art history, highlighting the blurred boundaries between images made by mechanical means and those drawn by hand, and by doing so demonstrating the absurdity of their objections.\" The work is also about \"the intersections of art and photography, and the question of where the balance lies between individual rights and collective security.\"\"The Camera Obscured (2012)\".

It is about the \"line of reasoning [. . . ] that the only way to defend democracy is by having something inherently undemocratic at its core.\" Rather than taking photographs, Bush collated write-ups, publicly available satellite imagery, spectrograms and maps. ==Publications== ===Publications by Bush=== *The Memory of History.
