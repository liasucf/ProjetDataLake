    "text": "Olde Town Arvada is a commuter rail station on the G Line of the Denver RTD system in Denver, Colorado. It is located in downtown Arvada, Colorado and is the fifth stop from Denver Union Station. The station includes 600 parking spaces in a parking garage that is shared with local businesses. Construction on the station and garage began late 2014. The public art chosen for the station is \"Track Bone\" by Frank Swanson and reflects how the railroad was in many ways the backbone of Arvada when it was founded in 1870. The sculpture is made of Red Colorado Granite cut into sections of railroad track and is long, high, and wide. The station opened on April 26, 2019. == References == Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 2019 Category:RTD commuter rail stations in Denver ",
