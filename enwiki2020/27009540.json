Tahoe Air offered jet flights directly out of South Lake Tahoe via the South Lake Tahoe Airport. Scheduled passenger service was planned to be operated with McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jetliners; however, before any orders for MD-80s were placed, operations began with a single Boeing 737-200 jet, registered N233TM and operated by parent company Casino Express. The lone aircraft was painted in the Tahoe Air livery. Tahoe Air made its first flight to Los Angeles (LAX) on June 25, 1999. On July 1, 1999, the airline started service to its second destination, San Jose, California (SJC). The carrier offered low fares in a two class cabin with inexpensive upgrades. However, by October 1999, the airline had ceased operations never having received any of the proposed MD-80 aircraft. The demise of Tahoe Air also marked the end of airline service to Lake Tahoe, which has not seen scheduled passenger air carrier flights since. ==Destinations== *South Lake Tahoe Airport (TVL) *San Jose International Airport (SJC) *Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) ==Fleet== * Boeing 737-200 (one aircraft) == See also == * List of defunct airlines of the United States ==References== ==External links== *Tahoe Air 1999 Timetable *1999 Tahoe Air website *Photos of Tahoe Air Category:Airlines disestablished in 1999 Category:Airlines established in 1999 Category:Defunct airlines of the United States Category:Defunct companies based in Nevada Category:1999 establishments in Nevada ",
