    "text": "The Games Maker () is a 2014 Argentine-Canadian adventure film co-written and directed by Juan Pablo Buscarini. == Plot summary == Young Ivan Drago places first in a mail-in contest for board game inventors, only to be disappointed after receiving the grand prize of a temporary tattoo. However, he soon discovers his tattoo is permanent, prompting his father to reach out to Ivan's long-estranged grandfather. Soon after, Ivan's parents are lost in a balloon race, whereupon Ivan is placed in a strict school, where classmates and teachers alike constantly show their dislike for him. Ivan escapes the school to run away to his grandfather in Zyl, the games capitol. Once there, Ivan learns that his tattoo matches a missing piece in the town jigsaw puzzle, and is a symbol of Morodian, the man who stole the puzzle piece and is responsible for Zyl's downfall as the greatest game-making town. Ivan runs off to confront Morodian, who had been tracking Ivan his whole life, and was responsible for the disappearance of Ivan's parents. Morodian puts Ivan to work as his personal games maker, but Ivan escapes with the missing puzzle piece and his parents, who Morodian was keeping hostage. With Morodian vanquished, Ivan replaces the missing puzzle piece, his father is reunited with Ivan's grandfather, and Zyl is restored to its former glory. == Cast == * David Mazouz as Ivan Drago * Ed Asner as Nicholas Drago * Joseph Fiennes as Morodian * Tom Cavanagh as Mr. Drago * Valentina Lodovini as Mrs. Drago * Megan Charpentier as Anunciacion * Robert Verlaque as Principal Possum * Alejandro Awada as Engineer Gabler * as Ramuz * as Miss Blum == Reception == The Games Maker received mixed reviews.
