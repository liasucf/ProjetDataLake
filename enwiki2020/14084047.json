Enhancing communication between biogeographers of all countries, SEBA contributes to the development of the theory and practice of Systematic and Evolutionary Biogeography (see Ebach & Morrone, 2005). SEBA was established in 2006. It is a non-profit organization and a Scientific Member of the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS). SEBA also promotes the International Code of Area Nomenclature (ICAN), a standardized system of biogeographical reference. ==References== * Ebach, M.C. & Morrone, J.J. (2005).
