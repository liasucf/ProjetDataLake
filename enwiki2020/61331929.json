Throughout its history, the website has published articles by numerous contributors, along with interviews with filmmakers such as Takashi Miike, Hayao Miyazaki, Satoshi Kon, and Yuki Tanada, among others. On 29 June 2015, Sharp and the Mes brothers announced that the website was retiring, and that no further content would be added to it.
