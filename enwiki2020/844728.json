Across the Smestow valley the terrain rises again in the direction of Finchfield. The valley here through which the Smestow Brook flows was formed as a glacial meltwater channel.

In the late 19th-early 20th century, Compton was home of a distinguished local artist Joseph Vickers de Ville (1856\u20131925). It was during this time that the still existing terraced housing was built along Henwood Road near the Bridgnorth Road junction. == Today == 'The Oddfellows', Compton Today, the quarrying has stopped, and housing estates have been constructed along the side of the valley.
