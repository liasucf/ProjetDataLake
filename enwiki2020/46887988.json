He was a long-serving mayor and member of the French senate for the Rh\u00f4ne department. He was married first to C\u00e9cile Pasquier (died ), then to Paule Sassard. == Biography == S\u00e9rusclat was born in Sarras, Ard\u00e8che, where his father had settled to become a teacher, after World War I. His first and middle names are those of his uncles who were killed in the war. His secondary education was at the , whence he went to the Faculty of Pharmacy at Lyon, where he started a deep friendship with Andr\u00e9 Boucherle. He was awarded his diploma on 27 March 1947. He worked as a monitor in the Department of Toxicology, and wrote his thesis under the direction of Marc Chambon. He became an assistant in the Lyon police's forensic lab, which had been set up in 1910 by Edmond Locard. He worked there over thirty years, becoming assistant director, and then director. At the end of December 1949. he opened a pharmacy (dispensing chemist) at Saint-Fons, where he trained many other pharmacists. He was an active participant in the central F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Syndicats Pharmaceutiques de France (FSPF), and in the local Rh\u00f4ne chapter. He became actively involved in politics. In 1955, he created with Andr\u00e9 Boucherle the (\"Lyon movement for a United States of Europe\"). He organized meetings and exchanges with other European pharmacists' organizations. Always rather provocative, he took a position for the legalization of cannabis, at a time when its use was negligible compared to that of alcohol or tobacco. However, the toxicity of cannabis, and its causation of accidents, had perhaps been underestimated. S\u00e9rusclat always had a great interest in education and public information. Convinced of the use of information technology in schools, in 2000 he published . He wanted every student to have a computer. usage He was a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pharmacie de Lyon for over fifty years. == Political career == S\u00e9rusclat was a member of the French Parti socialiste, which had a manifesto for pacifism and a pan-European state. He campaigned on many causes throughout his long career, but his main drive was in public health and bioethics. To this end, he was the joint proposer, in the French senate, of the . He also argued for better regulation of sea fishing, for the sustainability of fish stocks. With an innovative spirit, if somewhat lacking in humour, he contributed to the 1981 Pharmacy Green Paper under Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy for the creation of mobile pharmacies to supply rural villages, as some grocers still did at the time. This caused something of a sensation in the pharmacist world. In the same paper, he also proposed to pay pharmacists a consultation fee or prescription charge, as was done in other parts of the health profession. With Claude Huriet seconding, he passed the (\"Law relating to the protection of those involved in biomedical research\") on 20 December 1988, which established the French legal framework for clinical trials. == Offices == * Mayor of Saint-Fons, 1967-1995 * Member of the French Senate for Rh\u00f4ne department - .
