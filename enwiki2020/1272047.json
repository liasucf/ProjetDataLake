(2005). \"Tomoe Gozen\" in According to lore, she served Minamoto no Yoshinaka during the Genpei War and was a part of the conflict that led to the first shogunate. Her family had strong affiliations with Yoshinaka. Although never proven to be a historical figure, her story influenced several generations of samurai. Tomoe is often celebrated in books, music, poems, films, historical novels and popular culture in general. == History == Her father, Nakahara Kanet\u014d was a strong supporter of Yoshinaka and also her foster father, who raised him since she was two. Her mother was Yoshinaka's wet nurse. Two of her elder brothers also served Yoshinaka as generals. She is best known for her participation in the Battle of Awazu in 1184. According to epic account written at the beginning of the 14th century, In 1182 she commanded 300 samurai in a struggle against 2,000 warriors of the rival Taira clan. After defeating the Taira and driving them into the western provinces, Yoshinaka took Kyoto and desired to be the leader of the Minamoto clan. His cousin Yoritomo was prompted to crush Yoshinaka, and sent his brothers Yoshitsune and Noriyori to kill him. Yoshinaka fought Yoritomo's forces at the Battle of Awazu on February 21, 1184, where Tomoe Gozen purportedly took at least one head of the enemy. Although Yoshinaka's troops fought bravely, they were outnumbered and overwhelmed. When Yoshinaka was defeated there, with only a few of his soldiers standing, he told Tomoe Gozen to flee because he wanted to die with his foster brother Imai no Shiro Kanehira and he said that he would be ashamed if he died with a woman. Y\u014dsh\u016b Chikanobu, 1899 There are varied accounts of what followed. At the Battle of Awazu in 1184, she is known for beheading Honda no Morishige of Musashi.Faure, Bernard. (2003). ; Kitagawa, p. 521. She is also known for having killed Uchida Ieyoshi and for escaping capture by Hatakeyama Shigetada.Joly, Henri L. (1967). Legend in Japanese Art, p. 540. After Tomoe Gozen beheaded the leader of the Musashi clan and presented his head to her master Yoshinaka, Tomoe's reputation was so high that she was considered the first general of Japan. ==In fiction and culture== *Tomoe Gozen's life, set in a fantasy Japan, is the subject of a trilogy of novels by Jessica Amanda Salmonson (The Disfavored Hero, The Golden Naginata and Thousand Shrine Warrior, 1981\u20131984). *Tomoe Gozen is the basis of the Persona of Chie Satonaka in the 2008 video game Persona 4. *Tomoe Gozen is a playable commander in the Rise of Kingdoms online game, with an archery & support specialization. *Tomoe Gozen is one of the supporting characters in the 2010 Syfy series Riverworld. *Tomoe Gozen appears as an enemy at first with her alias as 'Archer of Inferno', but becomes a playable Archer-class servant in the mobile game Fate/Grand Order. *A character based on Tomoe Gozen appears in the Stan Sakai comic book series Usagi Yojimbo, named Tomoe Ame. *Tomoe Gozen appears as a character in the podcast Film Reroll. *Tomoe Gozen appears as a character in the manga and anime Nurarihyon no Mago. *Tomoe Gozen appears in Heian Shrine's Jidai Matsuri (Festival of the Ages), which is held on October 22 each year. *Tomoe is mentioned in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice as the mentor of one of the primary antagonists, Genichiro Ashina, who taught him how to harness the power of lightning.
