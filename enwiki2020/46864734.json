    "text": "Coffee production in Panama was occurring in the Boquete Valley by the early 20th century, although coffee was growing wild all over the Pacific coast region of Panama by this time, when production did not match domestic consumption. The International Coffee Organization (ICO) has grouped mild arabica as the variety of coffee that is grown in Panama. The best quality of coffee in Panama is grown in Boquete. In the Coffee Review of 2008, two Panamanian coffees have received higher rating and fetched record prices than the coffee from Costa Rica. This is mainly due to the unprecedented success of the Geisha varietal. This varietal originated from Ethiopia and arrived via Tanzania and Costa Rica in the 1960s in Panama. But only in 2004, its outstanding taste profile was recognized. In 2019 one pound of Panama Geisha beans fetched $1029 in an auction. ==Plantations== Coffee Plantation in Boquete The coffee varieties grown are 82 percent of arabica and 18 percent of robusta. Arabica coffee, grown in the Chiriqu\u00ed highlands at an elevation range of , is considered the highest quality of Panamanian coffee. The coffee produced here is said to be of a sharp taste, fragrant, with a mild degree of acidity. Among the estates producing coffee, the Caf\u00e9 Ruiz is said to be one of the oldest and most regarded. Caf\u00e9 Kotowa (Kotowa means \"mountain\"), a producer of boutique coffee, was established more than 100 years ago by a Scottish immigrant. Boquete has the largest coffee production factory in the country. Another notable plantation is the La Torcaza Estate, which is at an elevation of 1350 m in the southern slopes of Volcan Baru. It is an organically-tended plantation where natural microorganisms are used. ==Production== Traditional coffee-drying at the Alto Boquete plant of Cafe Ruiz In 2013, according to FAO statistics, coffee production in the country was 10,100 tons which was about 0.1% of the world production. It was grown in an area of with an yield of 4509 hectograms per ha. Coffee production statistics for the period 1961 to 2015 indicate a low of 402 tons in 1961 to 1422 tons in 1985, and in 2014 it was 510 tons. The indigenous groups known as Ng\u00e4be and Bugl\u00e9, who reside in the Chiriqu\u00ed and Bocas del Toro provinces, are dependent on coffee production for their sustenance. The Panamanian government ensures protection to coffee plants and crops from the effect of pests as it is one of the prime crops of export. In 2013, the pests that severely affected coffee plantations in an area of were Coffee Rust (Hemilieia vastatrix), Ojo de Gallo (Mycena citricolor) and Coffee Borer Beetle (Hypothenemus hampei). ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * ==External links== * Panama Category:Economy of Panama ",
