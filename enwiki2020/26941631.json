The track is also known as \"Somebody Dance with Me 2k13\" and was meant to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the hit by DJ Bobo that made the charts in 1993. ===Music video=== The music video directed by Combo Entertainment starts with DJ BoBo in disguise with a hooded sports jacket playing the original hit on his cassette recorder while passing in front of a wall graffiti inscribed with the year 1993. Shifting the recorder by his foot, an adjacent graffiti is revealed showing 2013. Later on in the video, youth are shown doing dance, breakdance and sports routines in front of the wall now inscribed with both years, with 2013 pointing to 1993. At the end of the video, DJ Bobo is parting with a smile from the graffiti wall while taking off his hood to the camera. The rest of the video is actual footage from the recording sessions in the studio showing Remady, DJ Bobo and Manu-L. ===Charts=== The single peaked at #4 in Switzerland. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2013) !Peak position |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 songs Category:1992 singles Category:DJ BoBo songs Category:Number-one singles in Portugal Category:Number-one singles in Sweden Category:Number-one singles in Switzerland Category:Songs written by DJ BoBo Category:Songs written by Rockwell (musician) ",
