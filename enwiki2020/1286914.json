Clinton-Baddeley; Mother: Louise Bourdin. Her mother was French. Baddeley was a descendant of British American Revolutionary War General Sir Henry Clinton. Her elder sister, Angela Baddeley, was also an actress. Her half-brother, William Baddeley, was a Church of England clergyman who became Dean of Brisbane and Rural Dean of Westminster.James Fergusson, \"Obituary: The Very Rev William Baddeley\", The Independent, 11 June 1998. ==Career== Baddeley (left) as Mrs Naugatuck in Maude, with Bea Arthur Baddeley was known for supporting performances in such films as Passport to Pimlico (1949), Tom Brown's Schooldays and Scrooge (both 1951), The Pickwick Papers (1952), The Belles of St Trinian's (1954), Mary Poppins (as Ellen, the maidservant), and The Unsinkable Molly Brown (both 1964), although she first began making films back in the 1920s. One of her more important roles was in Brighton Rock (1947), in which she played Ida, one of the main characters, whose personal investigation into the disappearance of a friend threatens the anti-hero Pinkie. She also had a stage career. She had a long professional relationship with No\u00ebl Coward, appearing in many of his plays throughout the 1940s and 1950s. The most successful was her teaming with Hermione Gingold in Coward's comedy Fallen Angels, though the two women were reportedly \"no longer on speaking terms\" by the end of the run.Hugh M. Massingberd (ed), \"Hermione Gingold\", The Daily Telegraph Third Book of Obituaries: Entertainers, Pan Macmillan, 1998, p.14.

In 1928 Baddeley married English aristocrat and socialite David Tennant (third son of Edward Tennant, 1st Baron Glenconner). She arrived an hour late for the wedding, having misremembered the time booked for the ceremony. They rented Teffont Evias Manor, which became known for their boisterous parties (including mixed naked bathing in the goldfish pond).Bates, Lesley. Three-year story of village where 'much has happened'. Salisbury Journal. 4 March 2004. page 31.

She had a relatively brief relationship with actor Laurence Harvey, a man 22 years her junior. Although Harvey proposed marriage to her, Baddeley thought the age difference was too great. Baddeley was known for her devotion to animals. She dedicated her autobiography, The Unsinkable Hermione Baddeley, to her pet dog. She continued to work in film and television until shortly before the end of her life. ==Death== She died following a series of strokes on 19 August 1986, aged 79, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.
