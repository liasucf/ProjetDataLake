    "text": "Ulai was the Hebrew name for a river near the city of Susa. It was known as Eulaus to the Greeks. It is mentioned twice in the Bible: *Daniel - \"In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal.\" (New International Version) *Daniel - \"And I heard a man\u2019s voice from the Ulai calling, 'Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.' \" There are three watercourses near Susa, and scholars are divided on which is indicated, although archaeology by Loftus in 1851 and Dieulafoy in 1885 helped shed some light. The Ulai may have been the eastern branch of the Karkheh River (alternately called the Choaspes), which at one time divided into two branches some 20 miles north-west of the city. Another possible location of this river is the Coprates tributary of the Karun River. Finally, some claim an artificial canal which ran close by Susa and connected the two rivers mentioned above. ==References== Category:Hebrew Bible rivers ",
