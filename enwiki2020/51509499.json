    "text": "Wiggle and Learn is an Australian TV show that aired on ABC. It ran from June 17, 2007 to September 8, 2008. It is The Wiggles 6th TV series. It was the first TV series to not feature Greg Page, who had to depart the group in 2006 due to poor health, and the only one to feature Sam Moran as the Yellow Wiggle, as well as the last Wiggles show until Ready Steady Wiggle in 2013. It was also the final series with Murray Cook and Jeff Fatt as the Red Wiggle and Purple Wiggle, respectively. Unlike the Wiggles\u2019 five previous TV series, Wiggle and Learn uses Nursery Rhymes instead of self-written songs. Also, the theme song was not written, either. Instead, it is a rewritten version of another song that was made in 2006 to promote ABC Kids, with Greg Page as the yellow Wiggle., although that might had been filmed alongside other filming materials while using animated backgrounds such as the ones in a Where Are They Now? episode about The Cockroaches. ==Supporting cast== * Paul Paddick as Captain Feathersword * Emily McGlinn as Dorothy the Dinosaur ** Voiced by Carolyn Ferrie * Adrian Quinnell, Kristy Talbot, and Ben Murray as Wags the Dog ** Voiced by Mic Conway * Mario Martinez-Diaz and Rebecca Knox as Henry the Octopus ** Voiced by Paul Paddick ==Production== ===Development=== The Wiggles first pitched the idea in early 2006 and wanted to have Greg Page in it. They filmed three episodes, but the show was eventually cancelled and re- shot with Sam Moran. In 2015, Anthony Field, Murray Cook, and Jeff Fatt found the original footage while lurking around on the computer. The original footage of the sets was also used for their very first documentary 15 Years of Wiggly Fun. ==Episodes== ===22-minute versions=== ===11-minute versions=== ===Writing=== The original draft consists of three plots: *The Wiggles and Dorothy the Dinosaur plan to go on a picnic. *The Wiggles play soccer on the beach. *The Wiggles must save their friends by singing songs. ==Broadcast== The Australian version aired from 2007 to 2008 on ABC and Playhouse Disney.

It also re-ran on that channel on January 2009 running at 11am weekdays, 7am weekends. It is also the first Wiggles TV show to be completely dubbed in another language (In other countries such as Italy, earlier Wiggles TV shows had the dialogue dubbed but the songs remained in English).
