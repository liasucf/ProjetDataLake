    "text": "\u00c1ngel Alejandro Morales Santos (born 14 June 1975), nicknamed Matute, is an Argentine retired footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. ==Club career== Morales was born in Buenos Aires. In his extensive professional career, he represented six clubs in his country, including both Avellaneda giants, Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente and Racing Club, starting his career at the former and having two spells with both. His first abroad experience came in June 1997, at the age of 22, as he played in Italy for U.C. Sampdoria for a few months, scoring against Juventus FC. In the ensuing transfer window, he signed with CP M\u00e9rida in Spain, but collected almost no La Liga appearances in a relegation-ending season. After returning to his country, with Racing, Morales moved abroad again, playing for Mexican sides Cruz Azul, Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz and Dorados de Sinaloa. At 33, he signed with Uruguay's Club Nacional de Football and, two years later, in 2010, returned to his country and joined Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n. ==Personal life== Morales' older brother, Carlos, was also a footballer. Also a midfielder, he represented Paraguay internationally, having been born in the country. ==References== ==External links== * * \u00c1ngel Morales \u2013 Argentine League statistics at F\u00fatbol XXI * Stats at Futbol360 * * * Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Platense footballers Category:Racing Club de Avellaneda footballers Category:Banfield footballers Category:Olimpo footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n footballers Category:Serie A players Category:U.C.
