The area was owned by his Croatian grandfather, J. G. Marinovich, who had supposedly been in the Russian Army and overseen the battlefield amputation of his own arm.Mike Sager, Todd Marinovich: The Man Who Never Was, Esquire, April 14, 2009, Accessed April 15, 2009. Marinovich attended Watsonville High School. ==College career== Marinovich went to Santa Monica College, where the team went undefeated and won the 1958 national junior- college championship. From there he transferred to the University of Southern California. While majoring in art at USC, Marinovich was a two-way lineman and a captain of the USC team that won the 1962 national championship; however, during the 1963 Rose Bowl he was ejected for fighting. Known for his passion, he was named Most Inspirational Player by his teammates. In college, he met his wife, Trudi (n\u00e9e Fertig), who was a sorority girl at USC, and the sister of USC quarterback Craig Fertig; she dropped out of college after her sophomore year to marry Marinovich. ==Professional career== Marinovich entered professional football during the era of NFL and AFL competitive drafts, and was drafted in the 12th round of the 1962 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams and in the 1962 AFL Draft by the Oakland Raiders. After a disappointing three- year career, where he over-trained himself based on weight and bulk with little time for recovery, Marinovich left to focus on sports training. ==Strength and conditioning coach== Marinovich studied Eastern Bloc training methods and was hired by Oakland Raiders owner, Al Davis, as one of the NFL's first strength-and-conditioning coaches. Marinovich learned to focus more on training for speed and flexibility, and much of his work became the basis for modern core- and swimming-pool-based conditioning programs. He later worked for the MLB's St. Louis Cardinals, and then the Hawaiians of the World Football League. He eventually moved his young family in with his in-laws on the Balboa Peninsula of Newport Beach, California. He later opened his own athletic research center, and began applying the techniques to his children, Traci and Todd Marinovich, introducing sport training before they could leave the crib and continuing it throughout childhood and adolescence.Douglas S.

The article declared Marinovich \"America's first test-tube athlete\", and mentioned his mother took him to museums, played him classical music and jazz while banning cartoons as too violent and instead viewing films by Alfred Hitchcock. Marv Marinovich had assembled a team of advisers to tutor him on every facet of the game.Douglas S. Looney, The Minefield, Sports Illustrated, September 3, 1990, Accessed October 2, 2015. In a noted passage, the article described that: Because of his strict upbringing and almost mechanical lifestyle under his father, some nicknamed him the \"Robo QB.\" Todd Marinovich went on to have a solid career at USC, but began to show signs of emotional rebellion against his strict upbringing under his father; by the time he entered the NFL as a first round draft pick, he soon became a major bust due to personal issues.
