    "text": "Eric Drew is one of the first adults in the US to survive a double cord blood stem cells transplant for \"terminal leukemia\". Drew is noted for having his identity stolen during his treatment. While undergoing treatment for a rare and virulent leukemia, his identity was stolen by a medical worker called Richard Gibson. Drew fought and became the first person to force a federal criminal conviction under the Health Information Privacy (HIPAA) laws. Gibson was sentenced to 16 months in prison and had to pay $15,000 in restitution. Drew has now dedicated his life to helping patients suffering from all types of serious and terminal diseases, and has become a spokesperson for the non- controversial cord blood stem cells that saved his life. Drew founded in 2003 the Eric Drew Foundation, a non-profit organization that promotes advocacy for terminally ill patients. Dateline NBC presented a segment called \"Fighting cancer... and an ID thief \" on Eric Drew's story on December 25, 2005. == See also == * Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act * Identity Theft ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:People from San Jose, California Category:American victims of crime Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ==External links== * Eric Drew Foundation * Eric Drew produces \"Eric Drew Reports,\" a video blog on identity theft issues.
