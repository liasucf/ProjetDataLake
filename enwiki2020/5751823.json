DJ Magic Mike's \"Groove On\" is a rap over this song and even features Shalamar lead singer Howard Hewett. Mase's \"Get Ready\" is also in the same style and raps over this song. J-pop singer Sowelu sang a version called \"Get Ready Nite 2 Remember\" which featured BIG-O. The original song was played at Toni and Todd's wedding reception on the sitcom Girlfriends, with the main cast dancing together down a \"Soul Train\" line. In the UK this song has also been used for a TV advert featuring the Harvester restaurant chain. In Gibraltar, this song is used at Gala Bingo before every main session. On 2 April 2003, a rendition of the song was performed by the Top 8 finalists of the second season of American Idol: Ruben Studdard, Clay Aiken, Kimberley Locke, Josh Gracin, Trenyce, Carmen Rasmusen, Kimberly Caldwell and Rickey Smith. Mary J. Blige recorded a cover of the song on her 2014 soundtrack album Think Like a Man Too (Music from and Inspired by the Film). ==References== ==External links== * Category:1982 singles Category:1996 debut singles Category:2005 singles Category:Virgin Records singles Category:V2 Records singles Category:Shalamar songs Category:911 (English group) songs Category:Liberty X songs Category:1982 songs Category:SOLAR Records singles ",
