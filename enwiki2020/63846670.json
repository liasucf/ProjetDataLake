It was altered in 1885 and then extended in 1905 to designs by J.T. Micklethwaite. The church was not built in isolation but as the centrepiece of a new development to the North of Wakefield City Centre and matches much of the other Georgian architecture in the vicinity and is the sole large development in Wakefield of this era. The tower was rebuilt in 1885 also to a design by J.T. Micklethwaite and other internal alterations were made at this time. ==Grounds== The church is situated in St John's Square in open grounds. The grounds are tree-lines and overlooked by the Georgian terraces built at the same time. There is no formal cemetery but a small number of graves and memorials in the grounds. The nave backs closely onto Wentworth Street. To the north-east corner there is a war memorial in the grounds to the workers at Wrenthorpe Colliery who lost their lives in the First World War. ==Listing and acthitectural notability== The church was grade II listed on 30 March 1971 for the reasons for its architectural notability. ==Architectural style== The building is of Ashlar sandstone with a hipped slate roof on the nave and aisles and a lead one to the chancel, chapel and vestry.
