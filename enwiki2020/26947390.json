    "text": "Les Parry (born 3 November 1953) is an English former footballer. He played for Tranmere Rovers as a centre back over 250 times between 1975 and 1983. He made his debut for Tranmere in an away fixture against Brentford, a 2\u20130 loss on 9 October 1972. His first career goal came against Chesterfield in 2\u20131 home win in April 1977. During the 1977\u201378 season, Tranmere manager John King selected the same Tranmere Rovers team for 28 consecutive league games \u2013 their birthplaces are in brackets: Dickie Johnson (Huyton), Ray Mathias (Liverpool), Eddie Flood (Liverpool), Les Parry (Wallasey), Dave Philpotts (Wirral), Clive Evans (Wirral), Steve Peplow (Liverpool), Mark Palios (Liverpool), Ronnie Moore (Huyton), Bobby Tynan (Liverpool) and Russell Allen (Smethwick). It's considered to be one of the most 'local' teams in Football League history as all players bar one were born within 10 miles of Prenton Park. In Parry's testimonial year, he was sent off twice. He broke his leg, meaning that he would miss his own testimonial through injury. It took place against Derby County F.C. His last game for Tranmere was a 1\u20130 loss against Darlington on 1 December 1983. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" !colspan=\"3\"|Club performance !colspan=\"2\"|Football league !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Associate Members Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Season!!Club!!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- | 1972-73||Tranmere Rovers F.C.||English Third Division||2 (1)||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||3||0 |- | 1973-74||Tranmere Rovers F.C.||English Third Division||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- | 1974-75||Tranmere Rovers F.C.||English Third Division||11 (2)||0||3||0||0||0||0||0||16||0 |- | 1975-76||Tranmere Rovers F.C.||English Fourth Division||21||0||1||0||3||0||0||0||24||0 |- | 1976-77||Tranmere Rovers F.C.||English Third Division||23||1||0||0||3||0||0||0||26||1 |- | 1977-78||Tranmere Rovers F.C.||English Third Division||45||0||2||0||2||0||0||0||49||0 |- | 1978-79||Tranmere Rovers F.C.||English Third Division||46||1||3||0||0||0||0||0||49||1 |- | 1979-80||Tranmere Rovers F.C.||English Fourth Division||21||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||22||0 |- | 1980-81||Tranmere Rovers F.C.||English Fourth Division||38||2||3||0||4||0||0||0||45||2 |- | 1981-82||Tranmere Rovers F.C.||English Fourth Division||28 (1)||0||0||0||2||0||0||0||31||0 |- | 1982-83||Tranmere Rovers F.C.||English Fourth Division||10||0||3||0||0||0||3||0||16||0 |- | 1983-84||Tranmere Rovers F.C.||English Fourth Division||9||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||10||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career Total||258||4||16||0||15||0||3||0||291||4 |} Source: ==References== Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Tranmere Rovers F.C. players Category:Association football central defenders Category:People from Wallasey Category:English Football League players ",
