    "text": "Moviment Patrijotti Maltin (abbreviated as MPM; \"Maltese Patriots Movement\") is a nationalist and anti-immigration political party in Malta. It was founded in April 2016 as the political wing of the anti-immigration group G\u0127aqda Patrijotti Maltin. The party has been described as far-right for its opposition to immigration and Islam in Malta. The party's founder Henry Battistino remains a major influence on the party's agenda, it is an anti- establishment party that opposes multiculturalism. ==History== The MPM was founded on the 8 April 2016 and immediately announced its application to the Electoral Commission as a new political party under the Financing of Political Parties Act. In the 2017 Maltese general election, the party failed to elect any candidate in parliament. ==Positions== MPM opposes the integration of migrants with culturally different backgrounds into the Maltese society, calling for European Union funds allocated to Malta for the purpose be instead allocated for the benefit of Maltese people and for Malta to no longer be a member of the Schengen Area. Additionally, the party has opposed the presence of Islam in Malta. At an October 2016 protest led by the party against the possible opening of a Muslim prayer room in Bu\u0121ibba, leader Henry Battistino called for a national registry of Muslims and compared Muslim immigrants to rabbits breeding excessively. Stephen Florian, an MPM party official, also spoke at the protest and stated that any religion other than Roman Catholicism should only have one place of worship in the country. Florian later caused controversy when he outed a counter-protester from the Bu\u0121ibba protest as transgender. MPM is frequently hostile toward media and the Maltese establishment, with Battistino referring to the media as traitors that are trying to \"force [integration] down everyone's throats\". The party's sister organisation, G\u0127aqda Patrijotti Maltin, was the subject of a complaint from the Institute of Maltese Journalists for protesters obstructing reporters from doing their job. ==Election results== ===General elections=== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: left;\" |- !
