    "text": "The Liechtenstein national football team () is the national football team of the Principality of Liechtenstein and is controlled by the Liechtenstein Football Association. The organisation is known as the Liechtensteiner Fussballverband in German. The team's first match was an unofficial match against Malta in Seoul, a 1\u20131 draw in 1981. Their first official match came two years later, a 0\u20131 defeat from Switzerland. Liechtenstein's largest win, a 4\u20130 win over Luxembourg in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier on 13 October 2004, was both its first ever away win and its first win in any FIFA World Cup qualifier. Conversely, Liechtenstein is the only country that lost an official match against San Marino. Liechtenstein suffered its biggest ever loss in 1996, during qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, losing 1\u201311 to Macedonia, the result also being Macedonia's largest ever win to date. ==History== Liechtenstein are only a relatively recent affiliate to FIFA, and did not participate in any qualifying series until the UEFA Euro 1996 qualifiers. There they managed to surprise the Republic of Ireland by holding them to a 0\u20130 draw on 3 June 1995. On 14 October 1998, they managed their first victory in a qualifying campaign after winning 2\u20131 against Azerbaijan in a Euro 2000 qualifying match. Since then, the presence of Liechtenstein clubs in the Swiss league system and of a handful of professional players (most notably Mario Frick) has seen the side's competitiveness improve slightly. The Euro 2004 qualifiers saw Liechtenstein improve to the extent they restricted England to 2\u20130 wins. The 2006 World Cup qualifiers, however, brought even better results as two wins over Luxembourg and draws against both Slovakia and Portugal meant that Liechtenstein finished with 8 points. In the Euro 2008 qualifiers, Liechtenstein beat Latvia through a solitary goal from Mario Frick. The result caused the Latvian manager to resign after the match. They repeated their heroics against Iceland managing to beat them 3\u20130 on 17 October 2007 for their second qualifying group win. On the 26 March 2008 Liechtenstein had an embarrassing 7\u20131 loss to fellow small nation in Europe, Malta. This was recorded as Malta's largest win. The Liechtensteiner Fussballverbund voted Rainer Hasler to be their \"Golden Player\" -- their best player over the last 50 years -- to mark UEFA's golden jubilee. In the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Liechtenstein secured a scoreless draw against Azerbaijan and a 1\u20131 draw against Finland, finishing bottom of Group 4 on two points. In the Euro 2012 qualifiers, Liechtenstein were narrowly beaten 2\u20131 by Scotland in Hampden Park thanks to a goal by Stephen McManus in the seventh minute of additional time. They produced a shock 2-0 win at home against Lithuania; their goals were scored by Philippe Erne and Michele Polverino. In the following qualifying game, they managed a scoreless draw away to Lithuania. In 2018, Liechtenstein entered the first ever UEFA Nations League, in group 4 of league D. Their first Nations League match saw Armenia beat them 2\u20130 away. Liechtenstein were able to claim their first Nations League victory, beating Gibraltar 2\u20130. ==Liechtenstein all-time record against all nations== {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
