    "text": "The Wombles were a British novelty pop group, featuring musicians dressed as the characters from children's TV show The Wombles, which in turn was based on the children's book series by Elisabeth Beresford. Songwriter and record producer Mike Batt wrote and performed many successful albums and singles as 'The Wombles' with other collaborators, including the series' theme tune. British Hit Singles & Albums jokingly referred to them as the \"furriest (and possibly the tidiest) act... are natives of Wimbledon Common, London\". In 2011, the band played at The Glastonbury Festival. ==History== Filmfair acquired the television rights to The Wombles and commissioned Batt to write the theme song. He waived the flat fee for writing a single song and instead secured the rights to write songs under the name 'The Wombles'. The band released several albums and singles. All four studio albums went gold, and four of the singles reached the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart. The Wombles were the most successful act of 1974, with albums in the UK charts for more weeks than any other act. A song called \"Wombling U.S.A.\", written to break into the American market, was recorded in 1975 but was not released until 2000 when it was included on the cassette version of \"I Wish It Could Be a Wombling Merry Christmas Every Day\". ==Live performances== In January 1974, Mike Batt appeared on an edition of Cilla Black's television series as Orinoco, having been led onstage by guest Bernard Cribbins, to plug \"The Wombling Song\". Consequently, when the single charted, the \"band\" was invited to perform on Top of the Pops. Additional Womble suits were hastily made for the live performance. When appearing as a band, the Wombles were always played by experienced musicians in full costume. Batt continued to perform as Orinoco, regularly accompanied by drummer Clem Cattini as Bungo and guitarist Chris Spedding as Wellington (complete with Spedding's trademark white Gibson Flying V)--both of whom had previously recorded with Batt. On one edition of Top of the Pops, the costumes were filled by members of Steeleye Span. Tim and Andy Renton, who had worked with Batt in the latter incarnation of Hapshash and the Coloured Coat also donned the costumes, along with Robin LeMesurier,The son of actors John Le Mesurier and Hattie Jacques who also had a Gibson Flying V, but was kicked out of the band following an arrest for possession of marijuana.Andrew Perry \"The Wombles at Glastonbury 2011: interview\", telegraph.co.uk, 15 June 2011 The band was the interval act at the Eurovision Song Contest 1974. ==The Wombles' split and Wellington's solo career== The Wombles 'split' in 1976 and, following a severe drought that summer, a single called \"Rainmaker\" (credited to Wellington Womble) was released. ==Legacy== Batt remains sensitive about the legacy of the band. In a 2008 interview, he said: \"It is hard to be taken seriously with the Wombles hanging around my neck like a furry anvil.\" More recently (in a programme with Aled Jones on the BBC in 2010) Batt pointed out that, in balance, the Wombles also served as a \"furry balloon\" as it gave him his first chart success. ==Glastonbury Festival== In April 2011, Batt announced that The Wombles would play at The Glastonbury Festival in June. Michael Eavis, the founder of the Glastonbury Festival, later said that booking the Wombles was \"a bit of a mistake\". Batt quipped that Uncle Bulgaria had been offended by Eavis' comments and had withdrawn an offer to tidy up the site after the festival. ==Personnel== ===The Wombles=== *Orinoco (Mike Batt) \u2013

performing \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" live in June 1988. The scrolling caption during the song read \"During the early eighties the Wombles reformed as a funk soul fusion. But the project soon failed and the group disbanded, only to come together again as the Dixie Minstrel Wombles. In 1988 the original line up were reunited for the third time to record their version of this Sex Pistols classic.... for a Pot Noodle commercial. Later released as a single it reached 57 on the charts\". The film The Rutles featured a Ringo Starr-inspired character named Barrington Womble who \"shortened his name to save time...he simply became Barry Wom.\" ==References== ==External links== *Chris Spedding \u2013 Wombles index Category:Bands with fictional stage personas Category:Musical groups established in 1973 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1976 Category:The Wombles Category:Fictional musical groups ",
