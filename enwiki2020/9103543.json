He has argued that five sitting Catholic judges effectively prevented the legalization of intact dilation and extraction abortion in Gonzales v. Carhart.Justice Sotomayor, Justice Scalia and Our Six Catholic Justices == Controversy == In March 2019, Stone drew criticism from some students for his long-standing use of the N-word in his classroom discussions of the fighting words doctrine, a limitation of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. On March 7, 2019, Stone announced that he no longer intended to use the word in class. Stone remarked, \"My conversation with the African-American students convinced me that the hurt and distraction caused by use of the word in the story are real and to be taken seriously. As a teacher, my goal is to be effective and I decided that use of the word in that story isn\u2019t sufficiently important to justify the hurt and distraction it causes. For me, this is a great example of why free speech is important. It enables us to learn from each other.\" ==References== ==External links== * Video interview, May 2004 Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism * Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:First Amendment scholars Category:University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:University of Chicago Law School alumni Category:Law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States Category:University of Chicago faculty Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:American writers Category:Members of the American Philosophical Society ",
