He did however receive one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes. Wilkins won a silver medal in the discus throw at the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles. He placed 5th in the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Korea. ==World records== Wilkins broke the world record four times in his career.
