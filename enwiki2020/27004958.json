    "text": "Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule is an American comedy television series starring John C. Reilly as Dr. Steve Brule. The show is a spin-off of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, originating in a segment called Brule's Rules. The series premiered on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim, on May 16, 2010. The program parodies 1980's public-access television programs and follows Brule as he examines different facets of living. His extreme, possibly pathological, naivete and social awkwardness generally land him in embarrassing situations, though he largely remains ignorant of any embarrassment he's causing himself. As the series progresses, he reveals shocking and sometimes horrifying details about his past and personal life. The series has completed four seasons of six episodes each. In the series Reilly interviews real people, whose reactions are genuine according to executive producer Tim Heidecker. He states that he intends for the humor to derive from Brule's character rather than the reactions of his guests. In post-production, the video is piped through a VCR to simulate poor production value. Critical reception has been positive, with several reviewers highlighting the character of Brule while noting the aesthetic qualities as similar to other productions. The A.V. Club Brandon Nowalk compared it to The Day Today and Brass Eye, while DVD Verdict Dawn Hunt compared it to This Is Spinal Tap. The first two seasons were combined onto a single DVD release, made available on October 16, 2012 in Region 1. ==Synopsis== The program, a surreal parody of human interest shows, follows Brule as he examines (or \"checks out\") different facets of living. His severe na\u00efvet\u00e9 and social awkwardness generally land him in embarrassing situations, though he personally seems impervious to embarrassment. Each episode begins with a poem or lyric pertaining to the subject of the show. Dr. Steve Brule credits the work, usually mispronouncing the author's name; his mispronunciations are a staple of the show\u2014in the first episode, he mispronounced the name of nutritionist Dr. Johnny Bowden both as \"Dr. Jimmy Brungus\" and \"Dr. Jungy Brogan\". As the series progresses, he reveals shocking, and sometimes horrifying details about his past and personal life, such as his mother revealing that she would poison his food when he was a child to \"slow him down.\" The series also has interludes from other public-access hosts; recurring characters names of Terry Bruge-Hiplo (Robert Axelrod), Doug Prishpreed (Doug Foster), Carol Krabit (Carol Kraft), and Scott Clam (Scott Stewart). Respectively, they host movie reviews, news updates, fortune-telling & weather updates, and a finance show, all in the same style of low-budget cable access segments. To simulate the poor quality of the video, the editors pipe their footage through a videocassette recorder (pictured) and hit the machine to simulate a jump in the vertical synchronization. ==Production== According to executive producer Tim Heidecker, Reilly interviews real people, with their reactions in the series being genuine. He stated that the humor revolves around \"not necessarily fooling these people. It's more the character of Steve Brule being completely clueless and a really strange guy.\" Heidecker has also cited Huell Howser and his show California's Gold as an influence.Tim Heidecker's Office Hours Live episode 116. July 4th Tribute to America with Larry Charles and Megan Koester Heidecker also stated that Brule's dialog for the series is mostly improvised. During an interview for Esquire, Reilly was asked about his experiences on the show. Although Reilly did not mind answering the question, he preferred not to elaborate on his character Steve Brule. He stated, \"his persona would be more interesting if left a mystery\", and felt the more he would elaborate on Brule's character the less interesting it would become to him. To achieve the artifact-ridden quality of the video, the editors pipe their footage through a videocassette recorder; the post- production crew literally hit the recorder in order to simulate a jump in the vertical synchronization. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Heidecker elaborated on the aesthetic quality of the series: \"It's a show that genuinely feels like this guy made it himself. It\u2019s as if it's 4:30 in the morning he had snuck into the studio to make this show without getting permission. It's bare bones. Lots of technical problems. Just a mess. The whole thing is a big mess. A big beautiful mess.\" ==Episodes== The series has completed four seasons with six episodes each. The first season premiered on May 16, 2010 in the United States; it concluded on June 20, 2010. The second season premiered on March 18, 2012 in the United States; its season finale aired on April 22, 2012. The third season premiered on February 27, 2014 and concluded on April 4, 2014. Adult Swim, in an announcement made before its upfront presentation, revealed Check It Out! to be a returning show for its 2015-16 schedule in May 2016. The fourth season premiered June 18, 2016. and concluded on July 29, 2016. A 30-minute special entitled Bagboy aired on February 20, 2015. A special episode depicting recurring character Scott Clam hosting in place of Brule (as a result of the events of the season 4 finale), aired on October 23, 2017. ==Critical reception== The series has garnered positive critical reception; Ross Luippold of The Huffington Post gave the series a positive review; he noted Reilly's performance, stating he \"may be the only actor alive who can get away with starring in critically acclaimed films during Oscar season ... while concurrently starring in two Tim & Eric joints.\" Lindsay Hurd of The Michigan Daily highlighted the stage design in her review; she stated \"The show's set is just as amusing as Brule's lack of coherence ... [the series] amounts to a gaudy-but-comical set that oddly matches Brule's reporting style.\" Casey Burchby of DVD Talk \"highly recommended\" the series' first and second DVD release. He praised the eponymous character, stating \"John C. Reilly's Dr. Steve Brule is one of the most likable characters in recent TV history.\" While he praised the series as \"a rare example of a well- developed and justified spinoff\", he found the series best enjoyed \"parceled out one at a time\". The series has received positive critical reception from The A.V. Club; the site has graded the first season three As, two Bs and one C grade. Writing for the site, Brandon Nowalk felt the interviews for the second-season finale \"Life\" accentuates \"a different facet\" of the series' humor: \"1990s absurdism.\" He cited The Day Today and Brass Eye as two examples of this quality, while stating Brule's character is closer to Harry S. Plinkett than of Stephen Colbert or Sacha Baron Cohen. He later regarded its third season as \"a little lighter on the laughs than usual\", but found it \"slightly better produced\", with the audience \"growing accustomed to the usual blunders.\" In reviewing the first and second season D.V.D. release, Luke Bonanno of DVDizzy praised Reilly's character; however, he was critical of reprising the \"bold characters\" of Wayne and Jan Skylar from Awesome Show, stating that \"such [characters] just aren't a good fit here and weigh down on the humor.\" He panned the network's lack of promotion for the series and wished for more episodes per season \"even if making it with Tim and Eric had to be a creatively-liberating blast\". Dusty Somers of Blogcritics stated the portrayal of Dr. Brule \"adds unexpected dimensions of naked vulnerability and a childlike fear of a world he doesn't understand.\" Dawn Hunt of DVD Verdict gave the series 95 out of 100; he applauded the series as an \"homage to the local cable access shows of the 1980s.\" He compared the series to mockumentaries such as This Is Spinal Tap and stated that the visual look of the series \"looks, feels, and sounds like it came straight from the MTV Generation.\" ==Home release== The combined first two seasons were released on DVD on October 16, 2012 in Region 1. Entitled Check It Out! with Dr. Steve Brule: Season 1 & 2, the DVD features episodes in production order. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2010 American television series debuts Category:2010s American black comedy television series Category:2010s American satirical television series Category:2010s American sketch comedy television series Category:Adult Swim original programming Category:American television spin-offs Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series by Abso Lutely Productions Category:Television series by Williams Street Category:Tim & Eric Category:2000s American surreal comedy television series Category:2010s American surreal comedy television series ",
