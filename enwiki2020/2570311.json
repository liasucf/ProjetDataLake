She graduated from the National Academy of Dramatic Art in Warsaw and continued her studies at the Parisian Conservatoire d'Art Dramatique. She is one of the most recognized and popular actresses in the contemporary Polish film industry. She often played blond bombshells, prostitutes, and wives of rich men. Recently, she has changed her image radically in favor of more mature characters, very often sorrowful and embittered. Katarzyna Figura still appears in TV shows. For many years, she has been featured in single episodes of popular sitcoms, and has regularly appeared in the show Witches (since 2005). In 2004, she made her come-back to theater after a long-term absence. Her role in Alina to the West by Pawe\u0142 Mi\u015bkiewicz in the Warsaw Drama Theater was highly regarded by the critics.
