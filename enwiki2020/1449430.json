The school changed location several times over the years. In 1900, the school was relocated to Macau due to the Boxer Rebellion. The school moved back to Guangzhou and built a permanent campus at the Haizhu District in 1904. The university moved to Hong Kong for the first time in 1938 after Guangzhou fell to the Japanese military. The university stayed in Hong Kong for 4 years before moving to Shaoguan after Hong Kong's capitulation to the Japanese forces. After World War II concluded, Lingnan University moved back to its permanent campus at Haizhu.Wang, Dong.

Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007. === Lingnan School === After the communist revolution in Mainland China, the university remained in Guangzhou, and was merged into Sun Yat-sen University in 1952. In 1967, the Lingnan Secondary School board of directors, along with the Lingnan University Hong Kong Alumnus Club and Lingnan Club founded the Lingnan Education Expansion Council, and began to organise the Lingnan School in Hong Kong. In the formative years, the school only provided preparatory form (Sixth Form) education and non-degree programmes. During the 1970s, Lingnan School began to offer diploma programmes in such subjects as liberal arts, commerce, and social science. === Lingnan College === At the end of 1978, the colonial government in Hong Kong issued a White Paper on post-secondary education. Lingnan accepted the government's suggestions, and abolished the 4-year system that is used in other universities around the world in favour of the \"2-2-1\" regimen (2 years of preparatory courses, 2 years of study for higher diplomas, 1 more year for an honours diploma). At the same time, the school was registered as an Approved Post Secondary College, and changed its name to Lingnan College. During the 1980s, the school began to focus its resources on Social Science, Commerce, and Literature programmes, and shut down its other programmes, such as Music and Science, to conserve funding. In 1985, an interdisciplinary degree programme was established. Lingnan's speed of development increased as the 80s drew to an end, due to the colonial Hong Kong government's policy of expanding higher education. At the same time, the preparatory courses that were first mandated by the government in 1978 were steadily abolished. === Lingnan University === Lingnan University Campus in Fu Tei, Tuen Mun In 1991, the Lingnan College received funding from the Hong Kong government directly after it passed an academic accreditation review from the Hong Kong Council for Academic Accreditation (HKCAA). During the 1990s, the University's development as a Liberal Arts university was confirmed by the school's board, and the school moved to its permanent location in Tuen Mun in 1995, the former site of Bowring Camp, a British Forces barracks. The school began to receive authorisation to open bachelor courses in 1992, then master courses in 1996, eventually receiving self-accreditation status and full recognition as a university by the government in 1998, and renaming the institution as Lingnan University on 30 July 1999. In 2007 Professor Edward Chen retired after his 12 years as president. Professor Yuk-Shee Chan, ex- vice-president of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology become the new president. Lingnan University is now preparing the new \"334\" system which is planned for introduction in 2012; in the new system, a new 120-credit programme will be divided into parts, e.g. General Education, Ethics. In addition, to prepare for the four-year university system, construction of Lingnan University's new academic building, Simon and Eleanor Kwok Building, has been completed, providing more teaching and learning facilities for the Faculty of Business. Located adjacent to the existing campus and near Fu Tai Estate, the Simon and Eleanor Kwok Building is built on a 4,674-square metre site and has a gross floor area of 5,178 square metres. == Academic organisations == === Faculties and departments === ==== Faculty of Arts ==== *Department of Chinese *Department of Cultural Studies *Department of English *Department of History *Department of Philosophy *Department of Translation *Department of Visual Studies *Centre for English and Additional Languages (CEAL) *Chinese Language Education and Assessment Centre (CLEAC) *Animation and Digital Arts Programme Office *Wong Bing Lai Music and Performing Arts Unit ==== Faculty of Social Sciences ==== *Office of the Faculty of Social Sciences *Department of Applied Psychology *Department of Economics *Department of Political Science *Department of Sociology and Social Policy ==== Faculty of Business ==== *Department of Accountancy *Department of Computing and Decision Sciences *Department of Finance and Insurance *Department of Management *Department of Marketing and International Business ==== School of Graduate Studies ==== ==== Core Curriculum and General Education Office ==== *Science Unit == Student life == === Representative Council === {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;text-align: left\" |- style=\"background:gray;

As a result, all full-time undergraduate students are required to stay at student hostels on campus for at least one academic year while at the university. A majority of students stay for two academic years. Newly admitted four-year students are required to be residents of student hostels for at least two years, and are guaranteed full residence throughout their stay should they agree upon it. In addition to another new student hostel building under construction, there are currently eight blocks of student hostels in Lingnan University; each hostel holds an estimated 250 people. == Controversies== === July 2019: Students and alumni petition for dismissing Junius Ho from the University Council === After the 2019 Yuen Long attack, a video of Junius Ho circulated widely online. In the video, Junius Ho, who was a member of the University Council, was found shaking hands and taking photos with the white- clad mob who attacked civilians in Yuen Long. Ho claimed that he was not involved with the attack, but many students and alumni had no confidence in him. A number of student bodies and alumni associations made declarations condemning his hate speech and support for the attackers, which seriously affected the image of Lingnan University. They also jointly requested Chief Executive Carrie Lam to dismiss Junius Ho from the University Council. The University issued a statement afterwards stating the irrelevancy between the stance of University and the actions of Ho. The statement also highlighted their respect for freedom of speech. == Notable alumni == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name !! Faculty !! Graduation Year !!
