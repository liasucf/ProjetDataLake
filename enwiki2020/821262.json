He was the surprise winner of the Men's 1500 metres at the 1952 Summer Olympics, and the only athlete representing Luxembourg to have won a gold medal at the Olympics.Luxembourger Michel Th\u00e9ato won the marathon in 1900, but the IOC officially credits him as having represented France, despite later research proving his nationality. Besides athletics, Barthel also led successful careers in both chemistry and politics. ==Biography== Born in Mamer, Josy Barthel's abilities as a middle-distance runner was discovered during World War II. His first fame came by winning the 800 m at the Military World Championships in Berlin in 1947. The next year at Military World Championships in Brussels he won both 800 m and 1500 m. At the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, Barthel finished ninth at the 1500 m final. Then he won Student World Championships in 1949 (1500 m) and 1951 (800 m and 1500 m). The absolute high point of Barthel's career was the 1952 Summer Olympics, where he surprised the crowd and himself by winning the 1500 m with a very strong finish. He also participated at the 1956 Summer Olympics, after which he retired from running. He was also Luxembourg champion in 800 m and 1500 m from 1946 to 1956. In 1962 Barthel became the president of the Luxembourg Athletics Federation, then from 1973 to 1977 he was the president of the Luxembourgish Olympic and Sporting Committee. He was also member of the Luxembourg government from 1977 to 1984. Josy Barthel died in Luxembourg City after a severe illness. The national stadium of Luxembourg, home to the Luxembourg national football team, was named Stade Josy Barthel in his honor. The Lyc\u00e9e Technique Josy Barthel in Mamer also bears his name. In 2006, Barthel was accused of doping by sports journalist Erik Eggers in the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. Eggers cited German physician Oskar Wegener who did research on methamphetamine and other doping substances in the 1950s. Wegener strongly denied saying Barthel had any connection with doping. The use of such substances was neither prohibited nor controlled until the 1960s. ==Footnotes== ==External links== * |- |- |- |- Category:Luxembourgian male middle-distance runners Category:Luxembourgian sportsperson-politicians Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1948 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1952 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1956 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Luxembourg Category:Olympic gold medalists for Luxembourg Category:Ministers for the Environment of Luxembourg Category:Ministers for Transport of Luxembourg Category:Ministers for Energy of Luxembourg Category:Councillors in Luxembourg City Category:Democratic Party (Luxembourg) politicians Category:Luxembourgian chemists Category:1927 births Category:1992 deaths Category:People from Mamer Category:Alumni of the Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e de Luxembourg Category:Medalists at the 1952 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists in athletics (track and field) ",
