The largest mazesoba chain in the world is Kokoro Mazesoba. The dish was invented in 2008 at a shop called \"Menya Hanabi\" in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture. The shop owner was trying to make Taiwan Ramen and had already made the meat for it. But it didn't go with the soup. When they were going to throw the meat away, one of the part time workers said, \"What if you just put it on top of noodles?\" From that start, it was perfected over time into the dish we know today. ==References== ==See also== *Japanese cuisine Category:Japanese noodle dishes Category:Japanese cuisine terms Category:Japanese inventions ",
