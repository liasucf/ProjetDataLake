    "text": "Iron Chef Gauntlet is a television series on Food Network that began airing on April 16, 2017. The series is a reboot of the Iron Chef and Iron Chef America series that gained popularity on Food Network and is hosted by Alton Brown, who also takes over as the series' Chairman. Seven chefs from around the country battle each other in an elimination contest, with the last chef remaining then facing a \"gauntlet\" challenge of defeating three other Iron Chefs in order to earn the title of Iron Chef. In the first season, the Iron Chefs forming the Gauntlet were Bobby Flay, Masaharu Morimoto, and Michael Symon. The second season of Iron Chef Gauntlet began airing April 4, 2018 and was scheduled for six episodes. The Gauntlet Iron Chefs for the second season were Alex Guarnaschelli, Gauntlet season one winner Stephanie Izard, and Michael Symon. ==Overview== Each regular episode consists of two challenges. The first is the Chairman's Challenge, with Brown announcing a theme in which all chefs must cook a dish for him to judge. The loser of this round is entered into the second round; the winner is safe from elimination for the week and may nominate one other chef to compete in the second round. The second round is the Secret Ingredient Showdown, in which the two chefs have one hour to prepare three dishes featuring a mystery ingredient. The dishes are evaluated by a panel of two judges, who can each award up to 20 points (10 for taste, five each for plating and originality). The chef with the lower total is eliminated, while the winner advances to the next episode. During the next-to-last episode of the season, which features three chefs, the loser of the Chairman's Challenge is automatically eliminated and the remaining two chefs compete in the Secret Ingredient Showdown. In the season finale, the last remaining chef competes in three Secret Ingredient Showdowns, one against each of the three Iron Chefs. If the chef's overall score is higher than the combined total of the three, he/she is awarded the title of Iron Chef. If the chef's overall score falls short, no new Iron Chef is named for the season. ==Season 1: 2017== ===Contestants=== * Nyesha Arrington (Los Angeles, California); Former Executive Chef/Owner, Leona * Jason Dady (San Antonio, Texas); Executive Chef/Owner, Tre Trattoria * Sarah Grueneberg (Chicago, Illinois); Executive Chef/Owner, Monteverde * Michael Gulotta (New Orleans, Louisiana); Executive Chef/Owner, MOPHO * Stephanie Izard (Chicago, Illinois); Executive Chef/Owner, Girl & the Goat; Izard lost to Iron Chef Michael Symon in Battle Bread on Iron Chef America.List of Iron Chef America episodes#Season 10: 2011-2012 * Shota Nakajima (Seattle, Washington); Executive Chef/Owner, Adana * Jonathon Sawyer (Cleveland, Ohio); Executive Chef/Owner, The Greenhouse Tavern; Sawyer was Iron Chef Michael Symon's sous chef in his early battles, and later lost to Iron Chef Geoffrey Zakarian in Battle Mint. ===Judges=== * Episode 1: Geoffrey Zakarian and Donatella Arpaia Stewart * Episode 2: Jose Garces and Anne Burrell * Episode 3: Marc Forgione and Giada De Laurentiis * Episode 4: Cat Cora and Ali Bouzari * Episode 5: Alex Guarnaschelli and Ching He Huang * Episode 6: Anya Fernald and Ludo Lefebvre ===Contestant progress=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |Contestant ! colspan=\"30\"|Episode |- ! colspan=\"2\" |1 ! colspan=\"2\" |2 ! colspan=\"2\" |3 ! colspan=\"2\" |4 ! colspan=\"2\" |5 ! 6 |- !
