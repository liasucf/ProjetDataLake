Selfie pictures with the cat have become a desired item for locals. Mittens is occasionally taken to the SPCA or the Police. Originally from the suburbs of Auckland, he has become a social media celebrity since he, his brother Latte and their owner Silvio Bruinsma, a partner at Deloitte, moved to the capital city in 2017. He featured on the 2018 edition of the Wellington Advent Calendar, an online calendar counting down the days before Christmas. Sam Thacker, an SPCA staff member, posted a polite direction about how to treat Mittens if anyone comes across him; asking members of the public not to report or take him in as they are familiar with his behaviour. On 22 May 2020, Mittens was given the Key to the City of Wellington. Previous recipients include Sir Peter Jackson and Sir Richard Taylor.'Feline groovy: Mittens unlocks more hearts with Key to the City' Wellington City Council website, 22 May 2020, Retrieved 22 May 2020 Later in 2020, he was the subject of an exhibition at the Wellington Museum'Mittens \u2013 Floofy and Famous' Wellington Museum, 4 July \u2013 11 October 2020 and a candidate for New Zealander of the year in August. == References == ==External links== *Facebook group, The Wondrous Adventures of Mittens Category:Individual cats Category:Culture in Wellington Category:Individual animals in New Zealand ",
