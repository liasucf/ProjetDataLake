    "text": "Ilie Theodoriu N\u0103stase (, born 19 July 1946) is a Romanian former world No. 1 professional tennis player, and one of the world's top players of the 1970s. He was ranked world No. 1 from 23 August 1973 to 2 June 1974. N\u0103stase is one of the 10 players in history who have won more than 100 ATP professional titles (64 singles and 45 in doubles). He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1991. N\u0103stase won seven Grand Slam titles: two in singles, three in men's doubles and two in mixed doubles. He also won four Masters Grand Prix year-end championship titles and seven Grand Prix Super Series titles (1970\u201373), the precursors to the current Masters 1000. He was the first professional sports figure to sign an endorsement contract with Nike in 1972. N\u0103stase wrote several novels in French in the 1980s. ==Career== N\u0103stase playing a Davis Cup match against the Netherlands in The Hague (1973) N\u0103stase on a 2004 Romanian stamp At the beginning of his career in 1966, N\u0103stase traveled around the world competing with Ion \u021airiac. They represented Romania in the Davis Cup competition, being runners up in 1969, 1971, and 1972. In singles, N\u0103stase won his first tournament at Cannes on 16 April 1967. His first victories against top players happened in 1969 in Stockholm, where he defeated Tony Roche and Stan Smith. N\u0103stase became one of the best players in 1970, with many experts ranking him as the sixth-best player in the world at that time, behind the Australians Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, John Newcombe, and Tony Roche and the American Arthur Ashe. N\u0103stase's high ranking resulted from his success at the Italian Open in Rome and at the U.S. Indoor Open in Salisbury, Maryland. With Tiriac, N\u0103stase won the men's doubles title at the French Open. In 1971, N\u0103stase was the runner-up at the French Open, where he lost the final in four sets to Jan Kode\u0161. In December, N\u0103stase won his first Masters Grand Prix title, finishing in front of Stan Smith in a round robin competition. In 1972, he became the No. 2 in the world, owing to his winning the US Open in a five-set final over Arthur Ashe. This tournament was the only event of the year in which all the best players participated. Two months before, at Wimbledon, N\u0103stase narrowly lost to Stan Smith in an epic five-set final, one of the more exciting championship matches.. tennisfame.com In the Davis Cup, N\u0103stase was undefeated in singles until losing to Stan Smith in the final played on clay in his native Bucharest. In December at the year-end tour finals, N\u0103stase defeated Smith, winning his second consecutive Masters Grand Prix title. In 1973, N\u0103stase won 17 tournaments, including the French Open, a doubles title at Wimbledon, and a third Masters title. He was the undisputed world No. 1 that year. In the Davis Cup, he won seven of eight singles rubbers. In matches against the other top players, N\u0103stase was 1\u20130 against Newcombe and 1\u20131 against Smith. The Romanian won the French Open without dropping a set (a feat repeated by Bj\u00f6rn Borg in 1978 and 1980 and by Rafael Nadal in 2008, 2010 and 2017), and he won the French Open (clay), Rome (clay) and Queen's Club (grass) in succession. N\u0103stase was seeded No. 2 for Wimbledon 1973, behind the defending champion Stan Smith. When the newly formed ATP withdrew its players from the tournament following the suspension by the ITF of Yugoslav Nikola Pili\u0107, only three ATP players (N\u0103stase, Roger Taylor and Ray Keldie) defied the boycott and were fined by the ATP's disciplinary committee. Nastase was promoted to No. 1 seed for the players in the subsequently weakened field and publicly stated his support for the ATP action but insisted that as a serving captain, he was under orders from the Romanian army and government to compete and thus could not boycott the tournament. Some contemporary press speculation and later biographies have suggested N\u0103stase contrived to lose his fourth-round match to American Sandy Mayer, but to have lost any earlier to a considerably less able player would have been too obvious.Evans, Richard. 'Ilie Nastase' May 1978 Aidan Ellis Publishing. Robertson, Max. 'Wimbledon: Centre Court of the Game' May 1984 Parkwest Publications. N\u0103stase never has commented publicly on this speculation. In 1974, he was the only player to qualify for both the WCT Finals and the Masters Grand Prix finals. N\u0103stase played well in the Masters, in particular against Newcombe in the semifinals. (N\u0103stase finished his career with a 4\u20131 record versus Newcombe, losing only their first match in 1969.) The Romanian, however, lost the final to Guillermo Vilas in five sets. For the fifth consecutive year, N\u0103stase reached the Masters Grand Prix final in 1975, where he defeated Bj\u00f6rn Borg in three straight sets. During the first half of 1976, N\u0103stase won four tournaments (Atlanta WCT, Avis Challenge Cup WCT, US Open Indoor, and La Costa), and head-to-head, he led Connors 2\u20131, Vilas 1\u20130, Ashe 1\u20130, and Borg 2\u20130. N\u0103stase did not enter the Australian Open, which was again avoided by most of the top players. N\u0103stase was prevented from entering the French Open because he participated in World Team Tennis. In the second half of the year, third-seeded Nastase lost in straight sets to Borg in the men's singles final of Wimbledon and in the semifinals of the US Open. N\u0103stase won three other tournaments during the second half of the year, the Pepsi Grand Slam, South Orange, and the four-man tournament of Caracas, Venezuela, in October (not to be confused with the Caracas WCT tournament in March), making seven tournament championships for the year. N\u0103stase was the world No. 3, behind Connors and Borg. In 1977, N\u0103stase finished No. 9 in the ATP rankings. He was a quarterfinalist at the French Open and at Wimbledon (losing to Borg), and participated in the WCT Finals. During his quarterfinal match at Wimbledon N\u0103stase had a row with umpire Jeremy Shales. Shales called him \"N\u0103stase\" when asking him to move to the advantage court, \"like a master speaks to a naughty schoolboy.\" (N\u0103stase has also said Shales asked him to pick up a piece of paper that had blown onto the court, saying, \"N\u0103stase, pick up that paper.\") N\u0103stase angrily replied \"You call me Mr. N\u0103stase!\". Since this incident, umpires have always used a courtesy title when addressing the players directly. Mr. Nastase later became the title of his autobiography. He was still one of the 20 best players in 1978. At Wimbledon, he again reached the quarterfinals. N\u0103stase retired from the tour in October 1985 at the age of 39 after playing in the Grand Prix de Tennis de Toulouse, but he did play the challenger tournament at Dijon in June 1988. ==Controversies== In October 1977 at the Raquette d'Or tournament, N\u0103stase used a 'spaghetti string' (double- strung) racket to end Guillermo Vilas's 46-match winning streak. The racket was known for creating large amounts of top spin and unpredictable bounces. Vilas quit the match in protest of the racket. A few days later, the ATP banned the use of such racquets. During the US Open in 1979, N\u0103stase was defaulted from his match against John McEnroe. The umpire previously docked N\u0103stase a point in third set and then a game in the fourth for arguing and stalling. A near riot followed as the crowd disagreed with the umpire's decision, throwing beer cans and cups on court. The match was restarted with the umpire's being replaced before McEnroe won. In 1994 N\u0103stase, Davis Cup captain of his country, was banned for an away match against Great Britain, for \"'audible obscenities and constant abuse and intimidation of officials'\" in a tie against South Africa. In 2017, while captaining his country's Fed Cup team against Great Britain, N\u0103stase was overheard commenting about Serena Williams' unborn child, and the 71 year old asked Britain's Fed Cup captain Anne Keothavong for her room number while posing for photographers. N\u0103stase previously made unfounded comments about Williams allegedly doping. Before the Great Britain and Romania began their two-day World Group play-off, N\u0103stase allegedly stormed in to the media centre to confront British journalists over the reporting of his comments the previous day. N\u0103stase could only find Press Association tennis correspondent Eleanor Crook before launching into a tirade about the reporting. During the second rubber, during which after the crowd had been told to respect the players he said to match umpire Andreas Egli: \"It's not the opera, what's your f****** problem?\" He was ultimately ejected from the stadium for unsportsmanlike conduct. In a statement the International Tennis Federation (ITF) additionally confirmed that N\u0103stase had his accreditation removed and would take no further part in the tie. The next day, the ITF provisionally suspended N\u0103stase under the Fed Cup Regulations for a breach of the Fed Cup Welfare Policy; meaning that he was banned from the site of any ITF event. When N\u0103stase was ejected from the stadium he met Crook again and, separated by a large number of security guards, verbally attacked her. The next day, despite being banned from the venue, N\u0103stase reappeared and went to have lunch in the onsite restaurant. He additionally sent flowers to the British team. On 21 July 2017, he was suspended by the ITF until 2021. Williams released a statement on social media branding the comments about her unborn child as racist, noting that it saddened her that we live in a society where these comments can be made. N\u0103stase then apologised on social media regarding the comments he made about Williams, but made comments about Konta speaking to the umpire which upset him. In an further interview with the BBC, N\u0103stase justified his comments to Konta stating that he only abused her after being ejected from the court and did so as a fan rather than a captain. N\u0103stase additionally added that he regretted his behaviour in the incident. Nastase was not invited to the French Open and Wimbledon following his suspension. The Madrid Open, however, invited Nastase to be part of the prize giving ceremony, which was won by Simona Halep (another Romanian player). This was a move that was deemed irresponsible by the WTA, which had revoked Nastase's privileges while the ITF carried out its investigation. Allegations of inappropriate behaviour included Pam Shriver claiming N\u0103stase frequently asked in a joking manner if she was still a virgin. After about 30 occasions of this happening, Shriver asked him to stop asking that, which he did. Dominique Monami, captain of the Belgium team, then mentioned that N\u0103stase had abused her in the round before the match with Great Britain. Monami later added that N\u0103stase was abusive for two games during the match between Elise Mertens and Irina-Camelia Begu\\\\. ==Playing style== N\u0103stase in 1973 Considered one of the more gifted tennis players in history, N\u0103stase was noted for his ability to entertain, amusing spectators with his antics and mimicry. Even during a crucial phase of a match, he was likely to do something bizarre that would entertain the crowd. One of the faster players, he is remembered for his magnificent lobs and retrieves. N\u0103stase could apply a discomfiting spin to his shots, being an expert at putting the ball just beyond an opponent's reach. His greatest weakness was a fragile nervous system and erratic temperament. N\u0103stase pioneered a distinctive tennis shot, a backward, over-the-shoulder wrist-flick useful as a last resort in recovering lobs. Tennis writer Bud Collins dubbed the shot the \"Bucharest Backfire\" after N\u0103stase. According to The Independent, N\u0103stase is best remembered for being one of the better players never to win the singles title at Wimbledon, for his tantrums, and his good looks. ==Athletic distinctions== * N\u0103stase won the Tennis Masters Cup tournament (today ATP World Tour Finals) four times, in 1971, 1972, 1973 and 1975. Only Roger Federer (6 times), Pete Sampras, Ivan Lendl and Novak Djokovic (5 times) succeeded to win more. * He is one of the five tennis players (third place) in the world who won more than 100 pro titles (57 singles and 45 doubles) according to the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) website, though there are many titles that are not included in the ATP statistics. (see Career statistics section). * N\u0103stase was the first professional sports figure to sign an endorsement contract with Nike. ==Awards and accolades== * N\u0103stase was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1991. * In March 2009, N\u0103stase was made a knight of the France's Legion d'honneur, being acclaimed for his \"impressive sporting career\" and \"the sense of spectacle\" he created when playing. * On 19 July 2016, his 70th birthday, N\u0103stase received the Star of Romania, his country's highest civil award, for services to sport. ==Books== N\u0103stase has published two novels and at least one autobiography. * Tie-Break (Tie-break, 1985), also published as Break Point * The Net (Le filet, 1986) * Mr Nastase: The Autobiography (Mr N\u0103stase: Autobiografia, 2004) ==Political career== He holds the rank of major general in the Romanian military. He entered politics in the 1990s, making an unsuccessful run for mayor of Bucharest in 1996. Elected to the Romanian Senate for a Bucharest seat in 2012, he initially sat for the Conservative Party, switching to the National Union for the Progress of Romania in July 2015 after the former party ceased to exist. ==Personal life== N\u0103stase has been married five times: his first wife was Dominique Grazia, a Belgian fashion model, whom he married at the age of 26, and with whom he has a daughter, Nathalie. They were married for 10 years. His second wife was American actress Alexandra King, whom he married in 1984 and with whom he adopted two children, Nicholas and Charlotte. His third wife was Romanian fashion model Amalia Teodosescu, whom he married in 2004. They have two children, Alessia and Emma Alexandra. After they split in 2010, he married Romanian fashion model Brigitte Sf\u0103t in 2013; their marriage ended in 2018. In 2019 he married Ioana Simion. Maxim has placed N\u0103stase at number 6 on its \"Living Sex Legends\" as he is reputed to have slept with over 2,500 women. N\u0103stase's own estimate of 800 to 900 was too low for the writer of his biography who wanted a larger number to improve his reputation. After hearing this, his third wife, Amalia, said that she was happy to have conquered such a man. N\u0103stase met Amalia at a Sting concert and married her in a Greek Orthodox ceremony on 5 June 2004 followed by a civil ceremony in July of the same year. They divorced in February 2010 after six years of marriage.Alastair McKay (1 February 2006) Ilie Nastase, the Romanian George Best, based on an Interview with Ilie N\u0103stase during the 2004 promotional tour for his autobiography. As he played for the Army's sports club Steaua, he was an employee of the Ministry of Defence.. On 25 May 2018, N\u0103stase was arrested twice within a six- hour span in one day for drunk driving and riding a scooter through a red light. ==Career statistics== ===Singles performance timeline=== Qualifying matches and walkovers are neither official match wins nor losses. {|class=wikitable style=text-align:center;font-size:90% |- !width=110|Tournament!!1966!!1967!!1968!!1969!!1970!!1971!!1972!!1973!!1974!!1975!!1976!!1977!!1978!!1979!!1980!!1981!!1982!!1983!!1984!!1985!! style=\"width:50px;\"|SR!!width=50|W\u2013L!!width=50|Win % |- | style=\"background:#efefef;
