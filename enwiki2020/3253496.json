Plano West is named after its geographic location of the west side of Plano. The school is part of the Plano Independent School District, and enrolls students based on the locations of students' homes. Students at Plano West attended one of two high schools: Jasper or Shepton. The combination of these two schools for 9th and 10th graders into the Plano West student body creates graduating classes of 1300-1500 students annually. Plano West was formed in the fall of 1999 as a newly renovated, former Shepton High School. Shepton High school then moved to 5505 W Plano Pkwy, Plano, TX 75093. Plano West is accredited by the Texas Education Agency, which designates the school as \"Recognized.\" The school colors are royal blue, black, and white, and the mascot is the wolf, with the students recognizing the student body as \"the wolf-pack.\" The school is ranked as 22nd in the nation, and as the #1 comprehensive high school in the State of Texas, according to Newsweek's 2016 list of best public high schools. ==Athletics== The mascot is the wolf, a departure from the feline mascots of the other two senior high schools in Plano (the Plano Wildcats and the Plano East Panthers). The Plano West Wolves compete in the following sports: * Baseball * Basketball * Cross Country * Football * Golf * Soccer * Softball * Swimming & Diving * Tennis * Track & Field * Volleyball * Wrestling * Lacrosse ===Championships=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\" |+ | colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#e5e5e5;\"|Girls Soccer State Championship Games |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#e5e5e5;\" || Year | colspan=\"2\"| Winning Team | colspan=\"2\"| Losing Team || Location (all in Texas) || Class |- | 2000 | Plano West | 2 | Katy Taylor | 1 | Round Rock ISD Stadium, Round Rock | 5A |- | 2001 | Plano West | 3 | Katy Taylor | 0 | Round Rock ISD Stadium, Round Rock | 5A |- | 2002 | Plano West | 3 | Humble Kingwood | 0 | Round Rock ISD Stadium, Round Rock | 5A |- | 2007 | Plano West | 3 | Deer Park | 0 | Round Rock ISD Stadium, Round Rock | 5A |- |2012 |Plano West |1 |Katy Seven Lakes |0 |Birkelbach Field, Georgetown |5A |- |2013 |Plano West |4 |Southlake Carroll |1 |Birkelbach Field, Georgetown |5A |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\" |+ | colspan=\"7\" style=\"text- align:center; background:#e5e5e5;\"|Girls Basketball State Championship Games |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#e5e5e5;\" || Year | colspan=\"2\"| Winning Team | colspan=\"2\"| Losing Team || Location (all in Texas) || Class |- | 2006 | Plano West | 54 | Rockwall | 47 | Frank Erwin Center, Austin | 5A |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\" |+ | colspan=\"7\" style=\"text- align:center; background:#e5e5e5;\"|Boys Basketball State Championship Games |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#e5e5e5;\" || Year | colspan=\"2\"| Winning Team | colspan=\"2\"| Losing Team || Location (all in Texas) || Class |- | 2015 | Plano West | 56 | Clear Lake | 54 | Alamodome, San Antonio | 6A |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\" |+ | colspan=\"7\" style=\"text- align:center; background:#e5e5e5;\"|Hockey State Championship Games |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#e5e5e5;\" || Year | colspan=\"2\"| Winning Team | colspan=\"2\"| Losing Team || Location (all in Texas) |- | 2004 | Plano West | 2 | Clear Lake High School | 1 | Deja Blue Arena, Frisco |- | 2005 | Plano West | 1 | Highland Park High School | 0 | Deja Blue Arena, Frisco |- | 2007 | Plano West | 2 | Allen High School | 1 (OT) | Deja Blue Arena, Frisco |- | 2011 | Plano West | 4 |Southlake Carroll | 2 | Starscenter, Farmers Branch |- | 2012 | Plano West | 4 (OT) |Arlington High School | 3 | Starscenter, Farmers Branch |- | 2014 | Plano West | 6 |Plano Senior | 3 | Starscenter, Farmers Branch |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\" |+ | colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#e5e5e5;\"|Team Tennis State Championship Matches |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#e5e5e5;\" || Year | colspan=\"2\"| Winning Team | colspan=\"2\"| Losing Team || Location (all in Texas) || Class |- | 2001 | Plano West | 10 | El Paso Coronado | 8 | Lakeway World of Tennis, Austin | 5A |- | 2004 | Plano West | 10 | Austin Westlake | 5 | Lakeway World of Tennis, Austin | 5A |- | 2005 | Plano West | 11 | San Antonio Churchill | 5 | Lakeway World of Tennis, Austin | 5A |- | 2006 | Plano West | 11 | Austin Westlake | 6 | Lakeway World of Tennis, Austin | 5A |- | 2016 | Plano West | 10 | Houston Memorial | 6 | Texas A&M; University, College Station | 6A |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%;\" |+ | colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#e5e5e5;\"|Baseball State Championship GamesPlano West Baseball |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#e5e5e5;\" || Year | colspan=\"2\"| Winning Team | colspan=\"2\"| Losing Team || Location (all in Texas) || Class |- | 2008 | Plano West | 10 | Southlake Carroll | 8 | Dell Diamond, Round Rock | 5A |} ==Music== The Plano West Chamber Orchestra is made up of approximately 40 musicians.
