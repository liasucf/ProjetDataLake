It was released by Som Livre in September 1998. Released two months after Sasha's birth, the album was totally geared towards that moment of joy that the Children's Queen lived at the time. Although the whole album was thought of in the daughter, Xuxa dedicated more specifically two for its small one: \"S\u00f3 Faltava Voc\u00ea\" and \"Uma Can\u00e7\u00e3o Para Sasha\", of which it participated in the composition. S\u00f3 Faltava Voc\u00ea was not as elaborate as the others, due to the pregnancy and the birth of the singer's daughter, which caused the album to \"flop\" in some stores of the country until 2003. The tracks most remembered by the public are: \"Eu t\u00f4 Feliz\" and \"Pelot\u00e3o da Xuxa\". The album was certified gold record by Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD). ==Background and production== In 1998, Xuxa Meneghel would realize the dream of being a mother. The singer was preparing for the birth of her daughter and the event in her life, which influenced her career a lot. In addition to changes in Xuxa Park and Planeta Xuxa, the blonde was planning to star in a special Mother's Day night, something that did not happen. In the song, Xuxa had plans to release an album of lullabies, which even got to put voice in some songs, and another more infantile one where it would only sing two tracks and the rest of the disc would be interpreted by invited artists. Projects that were also canceled. From the end of the projects she was planning to release that year, Xuxa and her team began to develop an album around her pregnancy. Several songs were presented to Xuxa talking about what it is to be a mother. The song \"M\u00e3e\", \"Palavrinha M\u00e1gica\" that came to be performed in Xuxa Park and Planeta Xuxa at that time. Another song recorded for the album, but which was not presented to the public was the re-recording of \"Le\u00e3ozinho\" by Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso. Xuxa had already re-recorded the song in a duet with Caetano on his first album Xuxa e Seus Amigos (1985) and decided to record that year, as he had long said that he would have a daughter with a lion sign and would like to sing that song for her. \"F\u00e9rias no Hawaii (Hulla Hulla)\" which was originally recorded for the summer season of Planeta Xuxa, which did not materialize, was discarded and included on the album. In July, it was decided the song that would name the project: S\u00f3 Faltava Voc\u00ea The composition portrays that despite all the happiness of the work, Xuxa was incomplete until being mother. The photographic essay for the album was performed shortly before Sasha's birth. Xuxa bet on many artificial hair, but in fewer costumes. The photos of the rehearsal were well taken advantage of in the art of the album that had on its back cover and insert, three photos of Xuxa, each with a different artificial hair. The photos were well publicized at the time. After the birth of his daughter, Xuxa and composers Michael Sullivan and Dudu Falc\u00e3o wrote the song \"Uma Can\u00e7\u00e3o Para Sasha\". The singer contributed to the composition by telling the composers everything she felt at that moment. The song was recorded in a studio set up at Xuxa's house, which at that time had already withdrawn from some activities to enjoy his daughter. It was mixed at the beginning of the song, Sasha's first crying during childbirth and a speech of Xuxa quite excited during the recording of the song. \"Uma Can\u00e7\u00e3o Para Sasha\" was included on the album in a hurry, since the album was already finalized until that moment. It was produced by Michael Sullivan and Z\u00e9 Henrique, had artistic direction of Aramis Barros and had artistic coordination of Marlene Mattos and Xuxa. It was recorded in the Som Livre studios. Initially, the album would have 20 songs, but the tracklist was reduced to 16. The songs were discarded: \"M\u00e3e\", \"Palavrinha M\u00e1gica\", which came to be presented in the programs of the singer, \"Um Mundo Melhor\", performed in the program social Crian\u00e7a Esperan\u00e7a (Child Hope) 1998, \"O Park J\u00e1 Chegou (Chega Mais)\", performed a few times in Xuxa Park and \"Vamos Sacudir\", sometimes performed on Planet Xuxa. ==Release== The album was released in September 1998. while Xuxa presented the special Xuxa 12 Years. The sales were not very good for the time, and the album ran aground in stores, the album is on the list of those that have not been reissued, along with T\u00f4 de Bem com a Vida (1996), Boas Not\u00edcias (1997) and Xuxa 2000 1999). ==Promotion== As for the other records, S\u00f3 Faltava Voc\u00ea had little publicity. The songs were little worked on the programs of Xuxa, except for \"Eu t\u00f4 Feliz\" and \"Adoleta\". The only ones not performed on TV were \"Rima 2 (a Malha\u00e7\u00e3o Continua)\" and \"Uma Can\u00e7\u00e3o Para Sasha\". As in the previous album, Boas Not\u00edcias, the disc's release was incorporated into the program scenarios. At Xuxa Park, from the return of maternity leave, the stage floor was changed to a cover art of the album. In Planeta Xuxa, also after the return of Xuxa, the photo of the cover of the disc happened to serve of floor in the scene. The photos of the bottom panels of the ball in which the blonde made her entrance were also changed to images of the essay for S\u00f3 Faltava Voc\u00ea, plus a circle with a photo of the rehearsal for the disc that came down from the ceiling after Xuxa left the ball. After the release of the album, the single \"Uma Can\u00e7\u00e3o Para Sasha\" was distributed to the radios all over Brazil. Although it was released as a single, the song has never been performed on the singer's shows or shows. It was planned to tour the album in the first half of 1999, when Xuxa would also record a live album. Due to the recording of the film Requebra, the project was canceled. The only presentations where the S\u00f3 Faltava Voc\u00ea songs were part of the setlist were: Santa Claus Arrival on December 20, 1998 in Porto Alegre, the Rio de Janeiro concert for the Christmas Without Hunger campaign also in December 1998, in addition to the presentation for children of INCA (National Cancer Institute) in August 1999 and a closed show for employees of Rede Globo on October 31, 1999. In its dissemination phase, a commercial simpleton was conveyed in Rede Globo's programming. The 10-second commercial brought images of various programs from Xuxa on Globo to the song \"Eu t\u00f4 Feliz\" and \"Uma Can\u00e7\u00e3o Para Sasha\", which may have contributed to the low sales, since the ad implied that it was a collection. == Track listing == ==Personnel== *Produced: Michael Sullivan and Z\u00e9 Henrique *Art Direction: Aramis Barros *Artistic Coordination: Marlene Mattos and Xuxa Meneghel *Recording Technician: Jo\u00e3o Carlos (Joca), S\u00e9rgio Rocha, M\u00e1rio Jorge and Mauro Moraes *Recording Assistants: Claudio Oliveira, Ciro Albuquerque, Everaldo, Ivan Carvalho and Williams Oliveira *Studio Coordination: H\u00e9lio de Freitas *Recorded in the studios: Som Livre *Makeup: Free Sound / S\u00e9rgio Seabra *Mixing Technicians: Jorge 'Gordo' Guimar\u00e3es *Production Assistant: Duda Nogueira *Mixing Assistants: Ivan Carvalho, Williams Oliveira and Everaldo ==Certifications== ==References== == External links == * S\u00f3 Faltava Voc\u00ea at Discogs Category:1998 albums Category:Xuxa albums Category:Som Livre albums Category:Portuguese-language albums ",
