    "text": "Katherine Thomas (born 6 June 1966), best known by her stage name The Great Kat, is an English musician best known for her thrash metal interpretations of well-known pieces of classical music. Most feature her using the electric guitar, but on some she uses the violin. Thomas is a classically trained violinist, graduating from the Juilliard School and touring for a time playing conventional classical music before crossing over to metal. Guitar One magazine listed her as one of the \"Fastest Shredders of All Time\". Her classical background, technical skills and self-promotion are sometimes compared to Yngwie Malmsteen. In an interview in metallian.com she claimed to be the reincarnation of Beethoven. Her public persona, as portrayed in her publicity photos and videos, is mainly compared to that of a dominatrix, albeit in an over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek manner. ==Discography== * 1986 \u2013 Satan Says (Demo) * 1987 \u2013 Worship Me or Die! * 1990 \u2013 Beethoven on Speed * 1996 \u2013 Digital Beethoven on Cyberspeed (EP) * 1997 \u2013 Guitar Goddess (EP) * 1998 \u2013 Bloody Vivaldi (EP) * 2000 \u2013 Rossini's Rape (EP) * 2002 \u2013 Wagner's War (EP) * 2005 \u2013 Extreme Guitar Shred (DVD) * 2008 \u2013 Total Insanity (compilation) ==References== ==External links== * The Great Kat's Official Website * 'Favourable' listener review of Wagner's War * UnRated Magazine Beethoven's Guitar Shred * Interview from Tuned-Out.com in Detroit.
