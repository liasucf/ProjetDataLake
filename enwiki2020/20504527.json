When he refused to identify his sources under subpoena he was twice found in contempt by a Federal court, with his position being upheld by the Ninth Circuit on both occasions. In 1993, the United States Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit) in Shoen v. Shoen, 5 Frd 1289 (9th Cir. 1993) and in Shoen v. Shoen, 48F 3d 412 (9th Cir.1995).

Watkins was finalist for the PEN American Newman's Own First Amendment Award for his defense of the First Amendment. His first book, High Crimes and Misdemeanors, was an account of the impeachment of Arizona's governor, Evan Mecham.
