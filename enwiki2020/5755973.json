(fragmentation-barrier mine, in the Russian and other post-Soviet armies as informally called \"frog mine\" or \"witch\" ) They are normally painted olive green, and issued with a spool of tripwires and two green painted wooden or metal stakes for affixing the tripwires. Both OZM-3 and OZM-4 have cast iron fragmenting bodies while the OZM-72 also contains preformed steel fragments, and all three are issued with empty fuze wells, so a variety of fuzing options are possible. ==Operation== The mines can be activated by a variety of fuzes, including electronic fuzes or command initiation, although they are most commonly fitted with an MUV booby trap switch which is activated by a tripwire. On firing, a metal base plate remains in the ground, while the mine body is thrown up by a small lifting charge, but remains attached to a strong wire tether. When the end of the tether is reached at a height of approximately 0.5 m, the main charge explodes and scatters fragments of the casing across a wide area. OZM mine may sometimes be laid directly on top of an MS-3 mine. The MS-3 is an anti- handling device which closely resembles a PMN mine, except that it has a \"blister\" on top and operates purely as a pressure-release boobytrap. Lifting an OZM mine (without rendering safe the MS-3 placed underneath) will trigger detonation. ==Variants== === OZM-3 === * Diameter: 7.6 cm * Height: 13 cm * weight: 3.2 kg * Fragmentation c TNT ===OZM-4=== {| class=wikitable |- |Casing material||cast iron |- |Weight||5.4 kg (12 LB) |- |Fragmentation charge (TNT)||170 gr (0,39 LB) |- |Casing diameter||90 mm (3,5 Inch) |- |Casing height||170 mm (6,7 Inch) |- |Length of the sensor target (one-way)||13 meters (42 Ft) |- |Sensor sensitivity||1\u201317 kg (2,2 - 39 LB) |- |Radius of guaranteed lethal destruction||13 meters (42 LB) |- |Temperature usage range||-60 to +60*C (-76 to 140*F) |- |} ===OZM-72=== {| class=wikitable |- |Casing material||iron |- |Weight||5 kg (11 LB) |- |Fragmentation charge (TNT)||660 gr (1,49 LB) |- |Casing diameter||108 mm (4,1 Inch) |- |Casing height||172 mm (6,7 Inch) |- |Sensor sensitivity||1\u201317 kg |- |Radius of guaranteed lethal destruction||25 meters (82,5 Ft) |- |Temperature usage range||-60 to +70 *\u0421 (-76 to +158*F) |- |Number of preformed steel fragments||2400 pcs. |- |} ==Ottawa Treaty== Since the Ottawa Treaty, a number of countries have decided to retain their OZM mines, but convert them to command detonation only by destroying all fuzes which can be indiscriminately activated - potentially by non-combatants or animals. Belarus in particular has decided to keep 200,000 OZM-72. ==See also== *Valmara 59 *Valmara 69 *PROM-1 *M16 mine *Land mine Category:Anti-personnel mines Category:Land mines of the Soviet Union ",
