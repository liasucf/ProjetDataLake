It is found in South Africa and Zimbabwe.\"Marmarophlegma paragarda Wallengren, 1860\". African Moths. Retrieved October 18, 2018. Note that this source uses the correct spelling of the generic name in the URL and elsewhere on the site. The wings are pale ochreous brown, the forewings crossed by a broad dark postmedial fascia. The veins are whitish, defined interiorly by some black irrorations (speckles). There is a marginal series of pale wedge-shaped lunules formed by the junction of the pale lines defining the veins, their apices reaching the margin of the wing. The extremity of the wing is darker beyond these lunules, and also near the base between veins one and two. The hindwings have marginal lunules similar to those on the forewings but paler and more indistinct.Fawcett, J. M.
