He also served as vicemayor of Santo Domingo from 1994 to 1998, and as mayor of Santo Domingo from 1998 to 2002. ==Early history== He began his career as a singer when he presented himself with some friends in a program of devotees which was broadcast by La Voz de la Alegr\u00eda weekly. The young Ventura, only 16 years of age, obtained first place of the participants. A little later, he started appearing in the programs of devotees which were sponsored by La Voz Dominicana. When Ventura Soriano appeared for the first time in the TV show: La TV busca una estrella, that was broadcast Friday night at seven, they rang the bell. In the following week, like a champion, Juan de Dios returned to be welcomed in the same competition. He practiced, worked and was crowned for the hit. Then he won first prize. Thereupon he won a lot of prizes in the devotees programs, until he was finally rewarded with the much desired scholarship which the broadcasting company, property of Jos\u00e9 Arismendy Trujillo Molina, gave for young talents. With La Voz Dominicana Juan de Dios studied music, vocal techniques and expression. This made Ventura one of the most famous singers in Latin America. ==Political career== In 1998, Ventura was elected mayor of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic.https://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-767542 ==Musical career== In 1959, Juan de Dios decided to take the name 'Johnny Ventura'. He started his career as a singer in several bands that presented themselves at the dances in La Feria. He worked with the orchestra of Rond\u00f3n Votau and in 1961 with the band of the Dominican percussionist Donald Wild. In 1962 he sang with Combo Caribe of Luis P\u00e9rez, with whom he recorded Cuidado Con el Cuabero, of which he was the author, and La Agarradera, of Luis P\u00e9rez. It was with this band that he recorded his first LP consisting of 12 songs. In 1963, Johnny Ventura was recruited by the musical director Papa Molina to join La Super Orquesta San Jos\u00e9, which he was the director at that time. He joined as singer and as player of the g\u00fcira. For two years Ventura was part of La Super Orquesta with stars such as Vinicio Franco and Grecia Aquino. Although no records remain of this group, this period was a landmark in his career. In 1964, the Cuban impresario Angel Guinea insisted on Johnny Ventura to create his own orchestra, the \"Combo Show\" which is known as an important part of the history of popular Dominican music. In 1965, with his orchestra, Ventura recorded for the Fonogram label the albums La Coquetona, La Resbalosa and El Turun Tun Tun. In 1967 he travelled to the United States, where he immediately became a star. He is credited with the song \"La muerte de Martin\", with the voice of Luisito Mart\u00ed, the Combo Show made their first golden record with Ah..! Yo No Se... No (1971). ==Discography== * La Agarradera Vol. 4 (1962) * Cuidado con el Cuabero (1963) * El Llor\u00f3n (El Flor\u00f3n) (1964) * 1920 y Otros \u00c9xitos (1964) * El Turun Tun Tun (1965) * El Boogaloo Est\u00e1 en Algo (1965) * La Resbalosa (1965) * Siempre Pa' Lante (1966) * Figurando (1966) * El Papelito Blanco (1967) * Noches en Quisqueya (1968) * El Mamito (1968) * Siempre en \u00d3rbita (1969) * El Guataco (1970) * M\u00e1s \u00c9xitos (1970) * Ah..!
