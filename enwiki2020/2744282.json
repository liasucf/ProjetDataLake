    "text": "Gladstone Cleophas Small (born 18 October 1961) is an English former cricketer, who played in 17 Test matches and 53 One Day Internationals (ODIs) for the England cricket team. The cricket writer Colin Bateman commented, \"Gladstone Small overcame a hunched physique to become a remarkably effective fast-medium bowler and one of the most popular characters on the county circuit\". ==Early life== Small was born in Barbados, and moved to England shortly after his fourteenth birthday, which at the time was past the normal cut-off for a change of cricketing nationality. However, he applied for eligibility to play cricket for England, and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) accepted his application. Small has Klippel\u2013Feil syndrome, which accounts for his distinctive \"no neck\" appearance. His life story was made into a documentary by director Pogus Caesar in 1995, and broadcast on Carlton Television for the Respect television series. He is a graduate of Manchester Metropolitan University. ==Playing career== Primarily he bowled outswing, but his propensity for unreliable bowling gave selectors cause for concern. However, in his third Test, during the 1986\u201387 Ashes, Small was a last minute replacement for the fourth Test, and rose to the challenge, taking 5-48 in Australia's first innings and claiming two wickets in the second. He was given the Man of the Match award, and this was to be the highlight of his career. Small was in England's squad for both the 1987 and 1992 Cricket World Cups. He was integral to the strong Warwickshire side of 1994, but retired soon after. Later, he became a director of the Professional Cricketers' Association. ==References== Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Manchester Metropolitan University Category:England One Day International cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:South Australia cricketers Category:Warwickshire cricketers Category:Barbadian cricketers Category:Black English sportspeople Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:D.
