Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter commented that \"Although Mogul Mowgli is an admirably ambitious effort overall, a more complex, colorful, daring film seems to be trapped just below the surface.\" Guy Lodge of Variety wrote, \"This is gutsy, spiky, imperfect independent filmmaking that finds the formal gusto to complement and buoy its star's aggressive dynamism: Ahmed affirms his standing as one of Britain's most vital, risky actors, even in a role we thought we'd already seen him play.\" ==See also== *Mogul Empire *Mowgli ==References== ==External links== * Category:2020 films Category:American films Category:British films Category:American drama films Category:British drama films Category:BBC Films films ",
