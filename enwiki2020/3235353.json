    "text": "Queen Elizabeth Grammar School (QEGS) is an independent, public school for boys in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England. The school was founded by Royal Charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1591 at the request of leading citizens in Wakefield (headed by Thomas Savile and his two sons) 75 in total and some of whom formed the first governing body.History of Wakefield Cathedral 16th Century The school is part of a foundation, with both QEGS Senior and Junior schools joined together, along with the nearby Wakefield Girls' High School and its Junior School, and Mulberry House, which is a nursery and pre-prep department. As of September 2010, the current headmaster of the school is David Craig, taking over Les Hallwood, who stood in as acting Headmaster during the time between the leave of the previous headmaster, Michael Gibbons, and the beginning of the next academic year. QEGS is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. Some notable former pupils include the 17th century English physician, John Radcliffe, Joseph Moxon, mathematician and hydrographer to King Charles II, Richard Henry Lee, signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, US Senator and President of the Continental Congress, Sir Francis Molyneux, 7th Baronet, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, Mike Harrison, former captain England national rugby union team, Mike Tindall, England Rugby Union player, member of the World Cup winning team in 2003, John Potter, Archbishop of Canterbury and the Rt Revd and Rt Hon the Lord Hope of Thornes, former Archbishop of York. ==History== ===Founding=== Queen Elizabeth Grammar School dates back to 19 November 1591 when a charter was granted to fourteen men to act as Governors of the new school. The Charter read: The original Elizabethan school building on Brook Street Five of the fourteen men designated to be governors bore the name Saville. Generations of the Saville family have played important roles in the school\u2019s history and hence the reason why the Old Boys\u2019 Association is called the Old Savilians\u2019 Club.QEGS History ===Coat of arms=== The school arms came into existence soon after the school was founded and features a lion, an owl and a bible. The golden lion on a red field refers to the royal foundation; the silver owl on black is taken from the arms of the Savile family (one of the founding families) and the Bible indicates the religious side of education. The school motto \u2013 Turpe Nescire \u2013 means \u201cIt is a disgrace to be ignorant\u201d. ===School song=== Around 1900, H. G. Abel, then the senior classics master, composed 'Floreas, Wakefieldia' and Matthew Peacock, headmaster and honorary choirmaster at the cathedral, set the words to music. It was seen as fitting that the song should be written in Latin, thereby evoking echoes of traditional scholasticism. The song is still sung today \u2013 at Founders' Day, Speech Day and at all Old Savilian Club dinners. ==Facilities== The current buildings on Northgate In 1854 QEGS moved to its present site in Northgate, Wakefield, into premises designed by the architect Richard Lane and formerly occupied by the West Riding Proprietary School. The attached Junior school for boys aged 7 to 11 was founded in 1910. A new building (Savile Building) was opened in 2005 by Ted Wragg, the famous educationalist, who taught at the school in the early 1960s. The new building provides a new 6th form centre, English department, state-of-the-art theatre and Learning Resources Centre for the pupils of QEGS. ==Sport== War memorial at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield The school is often noted for its sporting ability, having achieved frequent success in a number of sports. Over 83% of the school's boys represent QEGS in one sporting event or another. The most popular sport is rugby union, followed by hockey, cricket, athletics and basketball. Hockey in particular has experienced substantial growth in the school throughout the last decade, and is now close to matching rugby union's dominance internally. In 2006, 2013, 2014 and 2015 the under-15s Rugby side reached the Daily Mail Cup final, winning the 2015 competition in a tight 15-6 win over three time final rivals Warwick. In 2009 every age group won the hockey 'Yorkshire Cup' for the first time in the school's history with the under 16s going on to reach the national semi-finals, only to lose to Whitgift School. As well as plenty of sporting opportunities, the school also gives pupils the opportunity to participate in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme. ==In popular culture== *David Storey's Booker Prize winning novel Saville (1976) includes an account of the experiences of a working class boy at a Yorkshire grammar school in the 1940s.
