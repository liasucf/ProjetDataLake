Thus, the new Taitung Station was then constructed and the old one was turned into an art center named Taitung Railway Art Village. ==Architecture== The art center consists of art studio, classroom, performance stage and Hualien Railway Culture Museum which were converted from the warehouses of the old station. The old station hall was converted into the information center of the art center. ==See also== * List of tourist attractions in Taiwan ==References== Category:Art centers in Taitung County Category:Defunct railway stations in Taiwan ",
