He died in 614 after falling off a horse. After the establishment of Tang dynasty he was posthumously created Prince Huai of Wei. He died sonless, so Li Tai, son of his elder brother Li Shimin, was created his heir as Prince of Wei. When Li Shimin became emperor, he renamed Li Tai as his own son and created another clansman Li Baoding as heir to Li Xuanba. After Baoding died, also sonless, the Principality of Wei was cancelled.
