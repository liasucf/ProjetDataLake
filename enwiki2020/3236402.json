It has an elevation of and is the highest peak visible from Rome looking westwards. It is located in the province of Rome, in the communal territories of Palombara Sabina and San Polo dei Cavalieri. ==History== It is likely identifiable with the Lucretili Mons mentioned by HoraceOdes 1.17.1 as visible from his Sabine farm, and probably identical with the Mons Lucretius mentioned in the Liber Pontificalis,ed. Duchesne, i.183 which speaks of possessio in territorio Sabinensi quae cognominatur ad duas casas sub monte Lucretio in the time of Constantine. The name ad duas casas is supposed to survive in the chapel of the Madonna della Casa near Rocca Giovane, and the Mons Lucretilis is generally (and rightly) identified with Monte Gennaro, a limestone peak high, which forms a prominent feature in the view northeast of Rome. Excavations on the supposed site of Horace's farm were begun in September 1909. ==References== * Zappi ",
