MainFm 94.9 holds a Permanent Community Broadcasting Licence (PCBL). The station is also a full member of the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia (CBAA). Ian Braybrook and Marilyn Bennet started WMAfm (for Wireless Mount Alexander). WMAfm broadcast from studios at the Old Castlemaine goal. MAINfm broadcasts a wide variety of music and talk/magazine style shows. All of the presenters are volunteers. In 2014, the station changed its name from WMA FM to Main FM. Shortly thereafter the station acquired a caravan that was converted into a remote broadcast studio for outside broadcasts from community events and sports matches. In late 2014 the station relocated its studios from the old gaol to the old hospital buildings in Halford Street. In 2018, after receiving funding from the Victorian state government, MainFM employed a Station Manager in the first paid position of the organisation. Following this, in 2019 they hired a Sponsorships & Fundraising Co-ordinator. Each June the station holds The Main Kickoff, an Australian rules football match as a fundraiser. In 2016 Main FM won the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia's outstanding small station award and in 2018 won the best station fundraising campaign. ==References== ==External links== * official website Category:Radio stations in Victoria ",
