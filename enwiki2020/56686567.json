    "text": "Joseph Zyss (born in 1950) is a French physicist who specialises in molecular photonics and nonlinear optics. He is the author or co-author of more than 600 articles in the field. ==Career== From 1975 to 1997, Zyss worked at the CNET's Bagneux Laboratory. Subsequently he has worked in the Laboratoire de photonique quantique et mol\u00e9culaire (UMR 8537), and is its former director (1998\u20132006). In 2002, he was the founder of the (IFR 121), and served as its director until 2015. He also founded the European Associated Laboratory (LEA NaBi), a collaboration between CNRS and the Weizmann Institute of Science in the field of nanobiotechnologies. As of 2018, he is an Emeritus professor at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan. ==Research== His research has focused on molecular photonics. He specialises in molecular-level nonlinear optical effects. These researches have linked basic physical chemistry with technologies and applications including polymers for information technology and biophotonics imaging. ==Awards and honours== He is an elected fellow of The Optical Societyhttp://www.prixjeanjerphagnon.org/files/prix-jean- jerphagnon/jury/joseph-zyss.pdf, and has been awarded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Physique's IBM prize and , as well as the Gay-Lussac-Humboldt-Prize (2010). ==See also== * Alain Aspect * Claude Fabre == References == ==External links== * https://web.archive.org/web/20180916202840/https://www.frenchscienceindia.org/5-questions- to-joseph-zyss-ens-cachan/ * http://www.coria.fr/dycoec/spip.php?auteur27 * http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/1646.htm Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Participants in the Les Houches Physics Summer School Category:People from Neuilly-sur-Seine Category:French physicists Category:Participants in the Les Houches Physics Summer School 1990 Category:Fellows of the Optical Society ",
