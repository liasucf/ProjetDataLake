Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. ==Powerlifting== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !Athlete !Event !Result !Rank |- align=center |align=left|Sergey Meladze |align=left|Men's \u221272 kg |colspan=2|No Mark |- align=center |align=left|Mayagozel Ekeyeva |align=left|Women's \u221273 kg |105 |5 |} == See also == *Turkmenistan at the 2016 Summer Olympics == References == Category:Nations at the 2016 Summer Paralympics 2016 Category:2016 in Turkmenistani sport ",
