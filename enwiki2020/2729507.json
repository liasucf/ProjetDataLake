Herod the Great's kingdom was bequeathed to four heirs, of which Herod Antipas received both Perea and Galilee. He dedicated the city Livias in the north of the Dead Sea. In 39 CE, Perea and Galilee were transferred from disfavoured Antipas to Agrippa I by Caligula. and note 1164 With his death in 44 CE, Agrippa's merged territory was made a province again, including Judaea and for the first time, Perea. and notes 1370, 1376 From that timeTwo cities of Perea, Abela and Iulias (Livias), make an exception, having been kept by Agrippa II (Mason, S. ) to his death c. 100 CE. Perea was part of the shifting Roman provinces to its west: Judaea, and later Syria Palaestina, Palaestina and Palaestina Prima. Attested mostly in Josephus' books, the term was in rarer use in the late Roman period. It appears in Eusebius' Greek language geographical work, Onomasticon, but in the Latin translation by Jerome, Transjordan is used. Gadara or Gadora of Perea (identified as Tell Jadur near Al-Salt ) was the chief city or metropolis of Perea (not to be confused with Gadara of the Decapolis\u2212a Hellenistic city). Following the Roman conquest of Judea led by Pompey in 63 BCE, Aulus Gabinius, proconsul of Syria, split the former Hasmonean Kingdom into five districts of legal and religious councils known as synedrion (in Jewish context better known as Sanhedrin) and based at Jerusalem, Jericho, Sepphoris (Galilee), Amathus (Perea) and Gadara (either Perea\u2014Al-Salt, Decapolis\u2014Umm Qais,: \"And when he had ordained five councils (\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1), he distributed the nation into the same number of parts. So these councils governed the people; the first was at Jerusalem, the second at Gadara, the third at Amathus, the fourth at Jericho, and the fifth at Sepphoris in Galilee.\"\"Josephus uses \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd for the first time in connection with the decree of the Roman governor of Syria, Gabinius (57 BCE), who abolished the constitution and the then existing form of government of Palestine and divided the country into five provinces, at the head of each of which a sanhedrin was placed (\"Ant.\" xiv 5, \u00a7 4).\" via Jewish Encyclopedia: Sanhedrin: or biblical Gezer, mentioned by Josephus under a Hellenised form of its Semitic name, Gadara, edited to \"Gazara\" in the Loeb edition). ==Pliny the Elder and Josephus== * c. 78 CE Pliny the Elder in his work, Naturalis Historia, Book 5(15) wrote; > ['Greater Judea' or 'Provincia Iudaea', incorporates Samaria and Idumea into > an expanded territory.] The part of Judaea adjoining Syria is called > Galilee, and that next to Arabia and Egypt Peraea. Peraea is covered with > rugged mountains, and is separated from the other parts of Judaea by the > river Jordan (in the original Latin: \"Supra Idumaeam et Samariam Iudaea > longe lateque funditur. Pars eius Syriae iuncta Galilaea vocatur, Arabiae > vero et Aegypto proxima Peraea, asperis dispersa montibus et a ceteris > Iudaeis Iordane amne discreta.\")Pliny, NH, V * c. 75 CE Josephus in his work, The Jewish War, Book 3(3) wrote; > Peraea ...much larger indeed [than Galilee], is generally desert and rugged, > and too wild for the growth of delicate fruits. In some parts, however the > soil is loamy and prolific, and trees of various kinds cover the plains ; > but the olive-tree, the vine, and the palm tree, are those principally > cultivated.

In length, it > extends from Machaerus to Pella : in breadth, from Philadelphia to the > Jordan : its northern districts being bounded, as we have already said, by > Pella ; and those on the west, by the river. The land of Moab forms its > southern limit ; while Arabia and Silbonitis, with Philadelphia and Gerasa, > constitute its eastern boundary.Silbonitis is a textual error for Sebonitis, > i.e. Heshbon. () ==Other authors== Ptolemy does not use the term Perea in his Geography, but rather the periphrasis \"across the Jordan\". And he enumerates the \"Perean\" cities; Cosmas, Libias, Callirhoe, Gazorus, Epicaeros in this district.Ptolemy, Geographia Book 5 Ch.15:6 ==In the Bible== Perea was the area inhabited by the Israelite Tribes Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh. New Testament commentators speak of Jesus' \"Perean Ministry\", beginning with his departure from Galilee (Matthew 19:1; Mark 10:1) and ending with the anointing by Mary in Bethany (Matthew 26:6) or his journey towards Jerusalem commencing from Mark 10:32. ==Other Sites Named Perea== The Christian Armenians who were deported from Armenia and forcibly settled in the New Julfa/Isfahan region of Iran named a major village \"Perea\" in honor of the important significance of Perea as the resting place of John the Baptist. ==Hasmonean incorporation== * Hasmonean dynasty File:Judea Judas Makk.PNG|Hasmonean Kingdom Established 167 BCE (Judas Maccabeus) File:Hasmoneese rijk.PNG|Hasmonean Kingdom Expansion File:Judea na Pompeius.PNG|Hasmonean Kingdom Collapse 67 BCE (Hyrcanus II) ==Herodian incorporation== *The Herodian kingdom of Judaea File:Rijk Herodes de Grote.PNG File:Judea after Herod.png|Herod's kingdom was divided between his sons File:Palestine in the time of Jesus.jpg File:A history of the Jewish people during the Maccabean and Roman periods (including New Testament times) (1900) (14576629399).jpg File:1889 Palestine in the beginning of the Christian Era.jpg ==Later incorporation== File:Palestine according to Eusbius and Jerome - Smith 1915.jpg|Perea in c.350 CE according to Eusebius and Jerome (map as reconstructed by George Adam Smith, 1915).
