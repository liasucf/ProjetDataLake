    "text": "Eu Sou Todos N\u00f3s is the fourteenth studio album by Brazilian solo artist Z\u00e9 Ramalho. It was released in 1998. The album cover is a composite of pictures of several people, forming the face of Z\u00e9 Ramalho, which is an allusion to the album's title, \"Eu Sou Todos N\u00f3s\", which translates as \"I Am All Of Us\". It sold more than 100,000 copies in the first monthTexts about the album at Ramalho's official website and it had reached the 190,000 mark by April of the next year. It succeeds the well-sold compilation Antologia Ac\u00fastica. According to Ramalho, BMG would probably rather release an Antologia 2 of sorts, but the \"natural sequence\" for him was an album of new songs. In the contract with BMG, Ramalho managed to negotiate a three-album deal, including this effort, Na\u00e7\u00e3o Nordestina and Z\u00e9 Ramalho Canta Raul Seixas - both of the latter already had their names defined at that time. The album features a protest song called \"Sem Terra\". Ramalho commented it: \"Nowadays it is out of fashion, but if I had done it in the times of the military, I would be arrested and tortured to the soul. I used the structure of the protest song, of the festivals. It is a dialogue with 'Caminhando', by Geraldo Vandr\u00e9.\" == Track listing == == Personnel == * Z\u00e9 Ramalho - Lead vocals on all tracks, arrangement on all tracks except for 10 and 12, Viola on all tracks except for 12, Harmonica on track 2 * Nan\u00e1 Tribuzy - Lead vocals on track 4 * Robertinho de Recife - Electric guitar on tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 12, arrangement on tracks 4, 8, Sitar on track 8 * Chico Guedes - Bass guitar on tracks 1, 3, 5, 8 * Paulo C\u00e9sar Barros - Bass guitar on tracks 2, 4, 7, 9 * Luiz Ant\u00f4nio - Arrangement on tracks 1, 4, 7, 10, 12, Keyboard on all tracks except for 9 * Renato Massa - Drums on tracks 1, 2, 4, 7, 9 * Gustavo Schr\u00f6eter - Drums on tracks 3, 5, 8 * Jo\u00e3o Firmino - Zabumba on tracks 2, 4, 7, 9, percussion on tracks 5, 8 * Z\u00e9 Gomes - Percussion on tracks 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 * Waldonys - Accordion on tracks 2, 9, 10 * Dominguinhos - Accordion on tracks 4, 7 * C\u00e9sar Micheles - Flute on tracks 4, 9 * Roberta Little - Choir on tracks 1, 3, 7, 8 * F\u00e1bio Mondego - Choir on tracks 1, 3, 8 * L\u00facia Perez - Choir on tracks 1, 3, 7, 8 * Nan\u00e1 Tribuzy - Choir on tracks 1, 3, 7, 8 * Tadeu Mathias - Choir on tracks 1, 3, 7, 8 * Geraldo Amaral - Choir on tracks 1, 3, 7, 8 == References == Category:1998 albums Category:Z\u00e9 Ramalho albums ",
