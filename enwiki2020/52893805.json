    "text": "MSU Spartans Admirers of the Spartans typically praise their valor and success in war. The Battle of Thermopylae, mythologized as 300 Spartans blocking the pass of Thermopylae for three days against a force of 1 Million Persians, represents bravery against all odds. Laconophilia is love or admiration of Sparta and of the Spartan culture or constitution. The selection of Spartans as the name of a sports team is an example of this continued admiration in popular culture. == Non-scholastic teams == *Blyth Spartans A.F.C.
