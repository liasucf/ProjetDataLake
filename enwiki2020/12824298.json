Though battling cancer for several years, he continued to greet cruise ships as they arrived, and frequently appeared at Hobart's Salamanca Market on Saturdays. In 2003 he became known as the oldest town crier in the world. == References == ==External links== * T Wayne Fox, \"Oldest town crier honored\", Church News, 25 September 2004 * \"World's oldest town crier has no plans to retire\" - AAP * \"Hobart Council pays tribute to town crier\" - ABC Online * John L.
