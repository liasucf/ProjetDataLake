The town belongs to the historic province of Lesser Poland, and its name is probably derived from the name of the owner, St\u0105por. In the past, it also used to be called Stompork\u00f3w. The history of St\u0105pork\u00f3w dates back to the mid-16th century, and is associated with early ironworks, which was part of the Old-Polish Industrial Region. In 1738 - 1739 a blast furnace was built here by Polish Crown Chancellor Jan Malachowski. In 1781, Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden, a German pioneer in mining and metallurgy, visited St\u0105pork\u00f3w. At that time, the village's furnace produced a hundredweight of pig iron per week, more than similar plants in Upper Silesia. In 1838 the Malachowski family expanded and modernized the plant. An old blast furnace was replaced by two modern ones. Between 1876 and 1895, new upgrades and expansions of the plant took place. Despite the widespread destruction and requisition of equipment during World War I, the plant operated until 1938, and the buildings survived until 1945, when they were destroyed during heavy fighting. After World War II, the local industry was reopened, and iron ore mining was initiated. The iron foundry in 1961 employed 1,100 people, and St\u0105pork\u00f3w population increased from 700 in 1946 to 3,472 in 1961. In 1967 St\u0105pork\u00f3w received municipal rights, and in the late 1960s, a Health Centre, a Gymnasium, and a sports hall were built.
