He has held another man (Shaad Randhawa) captivated and heavily bloodied. Upon asking who's he and the reason for captivating him like this, the hero shows a video of his wife (Richa Chadda) through a projector. He tells him that he will seek revenge from him for killing his wife. He goes and starts eating while the villain tells him what he did with her. After he finishes eating, he stands up and takes a gun, but tells the villain that he knows he won't plead for his life, but certainly he will, for the life of someone else, i.e., the hero because no one except the hero knew about the place and neither does any sound good our normal any external sound comes in. Realizing it, the villain begins to plead him not to commit suicide and that he (hero) shouldn't kill himself because he has not done wrong and he shouldn't die. The hero finally shoots himself to his death and falls dead, as blood splashed from his head splatters on the projector screen, still playing his wife's video.
