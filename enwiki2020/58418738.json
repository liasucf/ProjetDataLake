It is a dynamic community facility offering diverse interpretive programming encouraging visitors to \u201cMake a Discovery\u201d while exploring the history and heritage of our area. The museum entered a new era in 2008. Nanaimo's history was given new life with the construction of our facility in the Vancouver Island Conference Centre, created with the vision statement: The Nanaimo Museum will enhance cultural quality of life, anchor our community and enlighten visitors while nurturing the flow of inspiration through interactive presentation of stories and objects spanning Nanaimo's history. Today, the museum offers award-winning exhibits, popular meeting and reception spaces and a destination Gift Shop. The expanded space has allowed the museum to bring top ranked feature exhibits to our community from the Canadian History Museum, the National Gallery and the Vancouver Art Gallery to name a few. Nanaimo & District Museum Society The Nanaimo & District Museum Society celebrated 50 years (incorporated April 2, 1964) in April 2014. The Society operates the Nanaimo Museum and the Bastion with a mission to engage the community and visitors in meaningful experiences relating to the cultural heritage of what is now the City of Nanaimo and surrounding district (i.e. School District #68), as well as to provide a learning environment though which the public can experience links between the past, present and future. The museum's mandate includes: Expanding collections while continuing to ensure they are relevant, well researched and accessible; engaging in as many \u201ccommunities\u201d as possible through exhibits, events and programs; making exhibitions stimulating, involving, and related to Nanaimo's unique history and development; and using the expanded facility to the best advantage to meet its goals. The museum has always placed a positive and accessible visitor experience at the forefront of operations. It strives to be welcoming and friendly with informed volunteers and to ensure programming and exhibits are informative for residents and visitors alike. It encourages diversity and is a Safe Harbour designated facility. The First Nations collection is held in trust for the Snun\u00e9ymuxw First Nation with whom the museum works closely to interpret their story. The Snuneymuxw First Nation Elder in Residence at Vancouver Island University, Geraldine Manson, began her involvement with the museum in 1991 during a dig at the St\u2019lilup village site and continues today as a special advisor to the Board of Directors. == References == == External links == * Nanaimo Museum Category:Museums in British Columbia Category:History museums in British Columbia Category:Buildings and structures in Nanaimo ",
