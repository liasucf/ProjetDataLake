    "text": "Alaskan ice cream (also known as akutaq, Alaskan Indian ice cream, Eskimo ice cream, Indian ice cream or Native ice cream) is a dessert made of dried fish (especially pike, sheefish or inconnu, whitefish or cisco, freshwater whitefishes), dried moose or caribou meat and fat and berries (especially cowberry, bilberry, cranberry, bearberry, crowberry, [high-bush] salmonberry, low-bush salmonberry, raspberry, prickly rose) or mild sweeteners such as roots of Indian potato or wild carrot, mixed and whipped with a whisk or formerly hand made by Alaskan Athabaskans. Traditionally, it was made with whipped fat mixed with berries like cranberries, salmonberries, crowberries, cloudberries (also known as salmonberry in Alaska), and blueberries, fish, tundra greens, or roots with animal oil or fat. It may also include whitefish, caribou tallow, moose tallow, walrus tallow, or seal oil. There is also a kind of akutaq which is called snow akutaq. The most common recipes for Indian ice cream consist of dried and pulverized moose or caribou tenderloin that is blended with moose fat (traditionally in a birch bark container) until the mixture is light and fluffy. It may be eaten unfrozen or frozen, and in the latter case it somewhat resembles commercial ice cream.Priscilla Russell Kari, Tanaina Plantlore, Dena'ina K'et'una (1987), p. 61. Not to be confused with Canadian Indian ice cream (or sxusem) of First Nations in British Columbia and kulfi (or Indian ice cream) from the Indian Subcontinent of Asia. The \"ice cream songs\" used to be sung during the preparation of Alaskan Athabascan Indian ice cream. Recent additions include sugar, milk, and vegetable shortening.
