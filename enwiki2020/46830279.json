    "text": "George Terence Schofield (born June 16, 1948) is an American former basketball player and coach. He played college basketball with the UCLA Bruins, winning three national championships (1969\u20131971) under Coach John Wooden. Schofield played professionally in Germany, where he later became a basketball coach. He also became an English lecturer for a German university. ==Early life== Schofield was born in Los Angeles, and began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade. He attended Saint Monica Catholic High School in Santa Monica, California,http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/HELMS/Basketball/HelmsBasketballAnnual1966.pdf where he was a three-time All-Bay Area first team selection, named to the all- league first team twice, awarded the league's Most Valuable Player, and was also first-team all-California Interscholastic Federation (CIF). ==College career== Schofield enrolled at Santa Monica City College, where he led the Metropolitan Conference in scoring as a freshman in 1966\u201367 after averaging 21 points per game. The following year, he transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he was on their non-playing squad for a year. As a sophomore in 1968\u201369, he was expected to start for the Bruins. However, he was beaten out by John Vallely, another junior college transfer, though Schofield was the better shooter. The move left him unhappy for two years. After Vallely graduated, Coach John Wooden opted to promote Kenny Booker to start over Schofield in 1970\u201371. The coach felt Booker was slightly better on defense and would be a better fit with the other starters. Schofield became the top guard off the bench, and served as the team's sixth man. He averaged 6.2 points and 2.4 rebounds as UCLA finished 29\u20131 and captured their seventh National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championship in eight seasons. It was Schofield's third straight title with the Bruins (1969\u20131971); he is one of 14 players who won three national titles at UCLA under Wooden. ==Professional career== At the urging of former UCLA teammate John Ecker, Schofield went to Germany to play professionally. He later became a coach in Germany. He led BG G\u00f6ttingen to Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) titles in 1980, 1983, and 1984; he has also coached TTL Bamberg. Starting in 1980, Schofield coached the German national team. He also became an English lecturer at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate basketball people in Germany Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players at the 1969 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players at the 1970 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players at the 1971 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players from California Category:BG G\u00f6ttingen players Category:Guards (basketball) Category:Santa Monica Corsairs men's basketball players Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles Category:UCLA Bruins men's basketball players Category:University of G\u00f6ttingen faculty ",
