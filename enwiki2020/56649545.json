The objective of the policy is to facilitate access to Government of India owned shareable data and information in both human readable and machine readable forms. ==Scope== A large quantum of data generated using public funds by various organizations and institutions in the country remains inaccessible to the public, although most of such data may be non-sensitive in nature and could be used by public for scientific, economic and developmental purposes. There has been an increasing demand by the community, that such data collected with the deployment of public funds should be made more readily available to all, for enabling rational debate, better decision making and use in meeting civil society needs. The NDSAP policy is designed to promote data sharing and enable access to Government of India owned data for national planning, development and awareness. The National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) is applicable to all shareable non- sensitive data available either in digital or analog forms but generated using public funds by various ministries, departments, subordinate offices, organizations, and agencies of Government of India as well as of the states. The objective of this policy is to facilitate access to Government of India owned shareable data through a wide area network, thereby permitting a wider accessibility and usage by public. The principles on which data sharing and accessibility need to be based include: openness, flexibility, transparency, quality, security and efficiency,. The motivation behind this policy is United Nations Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Principle 10: \"Environmental issues are best handled with the participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level. At the national level, each individual shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities,...and the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. States shall facilitate and encourage public awareness and participation by making information widely available.\" and Right to Information Act, 2005, Section 4 (2): \"It shall be a constant endeavour of every public authority to take steps in accordance with the requirements of clause (b) of sub-section (1) to provide as much information suo motu to the public at regular intervals through various means of communications, including internet, so that the public have minimum resort to the use of this Act to obtain information.\" . Some state governments such as Sikkim, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Assam, etc. have created their own policy on the lines of NDSAP. ==Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India== The open government data initiative started in India with the notification of the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP), submitted to the Union Cabinet by the Department of Science and Technology, on 17 March 2012.
