Murshidabad railway station lies in Murshidabad. == Location == It is located in Murshidabad district, from Sealdah railway station. == History == Ranaghat-Lalgola Branch Line was opened in 1905 during British reign. == Electrification == The 128 km long Krishnanagar-Lalgola stretch was electrified in 2004 for EMU services. == Infrastructure == The railway station has four platforms after the installation of a double railway track. == Expansion == Railway Ministry tried to connect the railway station to Azimganj Junction railway station. But due to land acquisition problems, the work of connecting these two stations was stopped. However, with help of Mamata Banerjee, the expansion work has been started again in full swing. The bridge named as Nashipur Rail Bridge over the Bhagirathi River is complete. The Murshidabad-Azimgunj link is expected to be commissioned by the end of December 2017. Some North Bengal trains like Darjeeling Mail, Haldibari Express are likely to move through Sealdah-Ranaghat-Behrampore Court- Murshidabad-Azimganj instead of crossing Bali Bridge and move through Barddhaman-Baharwa-Malda Town. Rail Ministry reports say that this linkage will minimise the travel distance(25 km) as well as time.The Nashipur Syndrome, The Week, Retrieved 12 October 2020 == Mail/Express trains == * SDAH-LGL Bhagirathi Express * KOAA-LGL Hazarduari Express * KOAA-LGL Dhanodhanya Express == References == == External links == *Murshidabad Railway Station Category:Railway stations in Murshidabad district Category:Sealdah railway division Category:Kolkata Suburban Railway stations ",
