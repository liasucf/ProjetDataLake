The tarsometatarsal articulation reaches the eye, or between the eye and the tip of the snout. Upper surfaces have irregular, distinctly porous warts; the parotoids areprominent, elliptical, and twice or twice and a half as long as broad. They are brown above, yellow beneath, marbled with brown. Males have a subgular vocal sac. Their snout-to-vent length is about 3 in.Boulenger, G. A. (1890) Fauna of British India.
