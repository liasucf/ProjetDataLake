He became a student at Uppsala University in 1848 from where he graduated in 1852. He then worked for a time as an official, among others, in the Chamber College. He commenced writing musical compositions from early in his career and during his time at Uppsala he attracted attention through his singing voice. Arlberg studied singing with Julius G\u00fcnther and the German tenor Wieser. He d\u00e9buted at the Mindre teatern in Stockholm in 1854 as Farinelli, but soon transitioned to the Royal Swedish Opera where he d\u00e9buted as Figaro in The Marriage of Figaro and had employment there from 1858 to 1874. From 1860 to 1864 he was also sub-director and from 1864-1865 director at the Royal Swedish Opera. However, he left there in 1874 owing to some ill- treatment and instead took up employment at the Opera in Christiania, where he stayed until 1877. He appeared as a guest-singer at several theatres in Stockholm during this period, and until 1883, when he gave up his singing career. He then worked as a singing teacher, first in Stockholm and then in Copenhagen and finally in Christiania from 1894, where he died in 1896.Fritz Arlberg: Swedish Musical Heritage - The Royal Swedish Academy of MusicFritz Arlberg - Great Norwegian Lexicon He was also active as a composer and writer.
