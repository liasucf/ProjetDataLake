    "text": "Gone Now is the second album by American indie pop act Bleachers, released on June 2, 2017. The album deals with the difficulties of growing old as well as struggling with losing people in life, told over the course of day and a lifetime. It takes inspiration from the pop sounds of the '80s, mixed with a modern view. == Cover Art == According to Antonoff, the photo of himself on the cover is a view of what he might look like if he were dead. In a series of videos breaking down album, he stated: > That's why on the cover -- everyone's like, \"what are you, a dictator?\" And > I'm like no, man, I'm dead. I'm supposed to be dead. I thought if I was > dead, what would I look like? I'd be black and white, and I'd be regal, and > dressed up. That's the picture you'd have mantle if I wasn't here anymore. The outfit was also used on the tour for Gone Now. ==Accolades== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- ! Publication ! Accolade ! Year !
