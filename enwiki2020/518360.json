    "text": "Audenshaw is a town in Tameside, Greater Manchester, England, east of Manchester. Historically part of Lancashire, in 2011 it had a population of 11,419. The name derives from Aldwin, a Saxon personal name, and the Old English suffix shagh meaning \"Woodland\". Nico Ditch, an early-medieval linear earthwork possibly built as a defensive barrier against Vikings, runs through the area. Medieval Audenshaw was a division of the township of Ashton in the county of Lancashire. Audenshaw expanded as a centre for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era with inhabitants employed in hat-making, cotton-spinning, calico-printing, and silk-weaving. In 1974, Audenshaw Urban District became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside. ==History== Audenshaw Reservoir The name Audenshaw is a corruption of its earlier name Aldwinshagh which derives from Aldwin, a Saxon personal name, combined with the Old English suffix shagh meaning \"Woodland\".. Nico Ditch, a medieval linear earthwork, runs through the area. Stretching from Ashton Moss in the east to just east of Stretford in the west, the origin of the ditch is unclear.. According to legend, it was completed in a single night by the inhabitants of Manchester, as a protection against Viking invaders in 869\u2013870,. and that it was the site of a bloody battle between Saxons and Danes and that Gorton and Reddish got their name from the battle, \"Gore Town\" and \"Red-Ditch\"... Despite the legend, the U-shape of the ditch \u2013 as opposed to the usual V-shape of military earthworks \u2013 and the absence of an associated bank indicates that Nico Ditch was probably a boundary marker.. Although it is thought to be earlier, the earliest documented reference to Nico Ditch is in a charter detailing the granting of land in Audenshaw to the monks of the Kersal Cell. In the document, dating from 1190 to 1212, the ditch is referred to as \"Mykelldiche\", and a magnum fossatum, Latin for \"large ditch\".. In 1877, part of the original village of Audenshaw was demolished to make way for the three Audenshaw Reservoirs. Also destroyed to allow the construction of the reservoirs was a section of Nico Ditch.. ==Governance== The coat of arms of the former Audenshaw Urban District Council, which was granted by the College of Arms in 1950. The arms are emblematic of Audenshaw's history and geography, incorporating in its design references to industry.http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/lancs_pre74.html During the Early Middle Ages Audenshaw is supposed to have been a thanage held by Saxons, but following the Norman conquest of England fell within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire, and noted as a division of Ashton, an ancient township and parish within the hundred of Salford. The division of Audenshaw spanned the village of Audenshaw, and the outlying settlements of Danehead, Hooleyhill, Littlemoss, North-street, Walkmill, Waterhouses and Woodhouses. This arrangement persisted until the creation of Audenshaw's first local authority, a local board of health in 1870. Audenshaw Local Board of Health was a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the locality. Under the Local Government Act 1894, the area of the local board became the Audenshaw Urban District, a local government district in the Ashton-under-Lyne Poor Law Union and administrative county of Lancashire. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Audenshaw Urban District was abolished, and Audenshaw has, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside, within the Metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. Audenshaw is represented in Parliament by the Denton and Reddish constituency. Since its creation in 1983, the constituency has been held by the Labour Party, At (53.4743\u00b0, \u22122.1122\u00b0), north-northwest of central London and east of Manchester, Audenshaw stands at the head of the Dane valley.
