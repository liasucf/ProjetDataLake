More than 130 others were injured in the blasts, at least 67 of them seriously. Government sources speculated that the bombers may have been transporting TNT to a downtown location in anticipation of the annual May Day parade on May 9.http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/IncidentSummary.aspx?gtdid=201205030002 Authorities at the time put the death toll at 13, but in December 2016, the Federal Security Service put the casualty figures at 40 dead and more than 100 injured.
