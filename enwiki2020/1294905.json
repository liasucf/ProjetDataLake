Smith traded Boston to the Miami Dolphins for a sixth round draft choice, citing his moody personality and lackadaisical practice habits. ===Miami Dolphins=== Before the 2004 season, Boston tested positive for steroids and was ordered to serve a four-game suspension. The suspension became academic after he tore ligaments in his knee and was unable to play for the entire season. The Dolphins cut him at the end of the year, then proceeded to re-sign him for the veterans' minimum for 2005. He played in five games that year before tearing knee ligaments again. ===Tampa Bay Buccaneers=== In 2006, Boston signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Boston reported to training camp but his medical report showed a stress fracture in his right foot and recommended surgery. He was placed on the suspended list, never practicing or playing in the pre-season. A second doctor's opinion, however, was that it was a two-year-old injury and cleared him to play in the regular season opener on June 27, 2008, when he recorded two receptions for a total of 16 yards. Following the game, however, Boston reported feeling too much pain and opted to follow the original doctor's suggestion of surgery requiring a 10 to 12 weeks rehabilitation period. He never played another down of pro football. ===NFL statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !! Team !! Games !! Rec !! Yds !! Avg !! Lng !! TD !! 1st !! Fum !!
