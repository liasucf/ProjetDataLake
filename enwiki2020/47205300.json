Established in June 2010 as a non-profit organization, Tecterra assists geomatics technology companies across Alberta to achieve commercial success faster than they can on their own. With current funding from the Government of Alberta, Tecterra is focused on investing in geomatics innovation for resource management and other markets. The organization\u2019s funding model is unique, as support for companies does not require Intellectual Property ownership or corporate equity in exchange for funds. ==History== Beginning operations in 2010, Tecterra was created in collaboration with the Alberta government to better utilize the natural resources in Alberta through the commercialization of geomatics technology. Tecterra's goal is to create prosperity through innovation, where innovation is the tangible value gained from the use of technology in everyday life. Tecterra's funding sources have included: Western Economic Diversification Canada, Alberta Innovates - Technology Futures, and the Government of Canada - Centres of Excellence for Commercialization and Research. == Programs == Tecterra supports companies through their funding and support programs. Companies are invited to apply to their programs at any time, and an internal review process is conducted alongside Tecterra's advisory committees.
