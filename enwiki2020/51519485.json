    "text": "Thiobenzoic acid is an organosulfur compound with molecular formula C6H5COSH. It is the parent of aryl thiocarboxylic acids. It is a pale yellow liquid that freezes just below room temperature. Thiobenzoic acid is prepared by treatment of benzoyl chloride with potassium hydrosulfide: :C6H5C(O)Cl + KSH \u2192 C6H5C(O)SH + KCl ==Acidity== With a pKa near 2.5, this acid is almost 100x more acidic than benzoic acid.Matthys J. Janssen \"Carboxylic Acids and Esters\" in PATAI's Chemistry of Functional Groups: Carboxylic Acids and Esters, Saul Patai, Ed. John Wiley, 1969, New York: pp. 705\u2013764. The conjugate base is thiobenzoate, C6H5COS\u2212. ==See also== * Dithiobenzoic acid ==References== Category:Benzoic acids ",
