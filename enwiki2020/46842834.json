Technological advances such as web-based live chat earn the service three to four extra customers a day. Zilberman prioritized speedy recovery. Most repairs can be done on the same day including smartphone screen replacements in as fast as 15 minutes. In 2012, Zilberman opened a LaptopMD location in Pequannock Township, New Jersey for the convenience of New Jersey clients. The success of the Pompton Plains location led to further expansion, with the 2015 opening of LaptopMD's third location in Morristown, New Jersey. ==Sister services== Matt Ham, a managing partner of LaptopMD, moved to Florida in early 2013 and opened Computer Repair Doctor, a sister service of LaptopMD.
