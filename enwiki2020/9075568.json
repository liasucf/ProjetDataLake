The band has released two studio albums. Hit & Run has toured extensively throughout the United States, playing such prestigious festivals as Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High sierra music festival, Grand Targhee Bluegrass Festival, Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival, Rockygrass Bluegrass Festival, and Bean Blossom. Hit & Run has shared billing with artists such as Creedence Clearwater Revisited, Jerry Douglas, Hot Rize, Alison Krauss, and David Grisman. In 2005 they took first place in the SPBGMA International Band Championship in Nashville. In 2003, Hit & Run became the first band to win both Telluride (2003) and Rockygrass (2002) Bluegrass Festival Band Contests. Guitarist Rebecca Frazier became the first woman to appear on the cover of Flatpicking Guitar Magazine when the September 2006 issue of that magazine was released. The group now tours as Rebecca Frazier and Hit & Run Bluegrass. The lineup consists of Rebecca Frazier (n\u00e9e Hoggan) on guitar, Isaac Eicher on mandolin, Mike Sumner on banjo, Erik Alvar on bass, and Nate Leath and Christian Ward sharing fiddle duties. ==Successes== * 2005 & 2014 International Bluegrass Music Association Showcase Artist * First place, 2005 SPBGMA International Band Championship Nashville, TN * First place, 2003 Telluride Bluegrass Festival Band Contest Telluride, CO & Lyons, CO * First place, 2002 Rockygrass Band Contest Lyons, CO == Sound == Hit & Run's appeal may be their youthful energy combined with polished vocals, hot picking, and their contemporary sound.
