It was granted the Air Operator License and Air Operator Certificate from Department of Civil Aviation (Thailand) (DCA) in November 2009, permitting international operations, with its first flight on December 2009. The carrier has since experienced financial difficulties, with the unpaid fees of fuel surcharge, air traffic control services and aircraft lessors for more than 1 billion THB (approx. 30.7 million USD), which cause the DCA to ordered Business Air to suspend its operation on 16 January 2015, leaving more than 1,000 passengers affected. However on 24 January 2015, the Administrative Court of Thailand granted the preliminary injunction, allowing the airline to resume operations in the wake of ongoing liability and litigation.http://www.ch- aviation.com/portal/news/34713-thai-court-allows-business-air-to-resume- operations The airline was rebranded as \"Intira Airlines\" in June 2015 under the new ownership, but never launched.\".\" Intira Airlines.\" ==Destinations== ;Republic of Korea *Seoul - Incheon International Airport ;Saudi Arabia *Jeddah - King Abdulaziz International Airport ;Thailand *Bangkok - Suvarnabhumi Airport base *Narathiwat - Narathiwat Airport ==Fleet== Boeing 767-300ER in Business Air livery {| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |+ Business Air Fleetplanespotters.net - Business Air Fleet Details and History |- bgcolor=lightblue !rowspan=2|Aircraft !rowspan=2|In Fleet !colspan=4|Passenger |- bgcolor=lightblue !J !Y+ !Y !Total |- |rowspan=4|Boeing 767-300ER |rowspan=4|2 |32 |\u2014 |189 |221 |- |\u2014 |\u2014 |251 |251 |- |} ==References== ==External links== *Official Website (Business Air, Intira Airlines) Category:Charter airlines of Thailand Category:Airlines established in 2008 Category:Thai companies established in 2008 *[J]: Business *[Y+]: Premium *[Y]: Economy ",
