    "text": "Joseph Marie de Tilly (16 August 1837 - 4 August 1906) was a Belgian military man and mathematician. He was born in Ypres, Belgium. In 1858, he became a teacher in mathematics at the regimental school. He began with studying geometry, particularly Euclid's fifth postulate and non-Euclidean geometry. He found similar results as Lobachevsky in 1860, but the Russian mathematician was already dead at that time. Tilly is more known for his work on non- Euclidean mechanics, as he was the one who invented it. He worked thus alone on this topic until a French mathematician, Jules Ho\u00fcel, showed interest in that field. Tilly also wrote on military science and history of mathematics. He died in M\u00fcnchen, Germany. ==References== * Category:1837 births Category:1906 deaths Category:Belgian mathematicians Category:People from Ypres ",
