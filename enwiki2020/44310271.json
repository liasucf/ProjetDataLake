    "text": "Major Gustavus Henry March-Phillipps (1908 \u2013 12 September 1942; sometimes spelled \"March-Phillips\") was the founder of the British Army's No. 62 Commando, the Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF), a precursor of the Special Air Service (SAS). In the Daily Telegraph, Max Hastings noted: \"In January 1942 he launched Operation Postmaster, a picaresque 'cutting-out expedition', which seized two Italian merchantmen from the neutral Spanish colonial port of Santa Isabel in West Africa, and towed them triumphantly to Lagos.\" After the raid March-Phillipps was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. == Biography == He was killed in Operation Aquatint in September 1942. This secret operation took place on the German-occupied French coastlines. In an attempt to hurt the enemy, increase allied morale, and change the tide of World War II, March- Phillips led a special forces raider team (SSRF) of 11 onto Omaha Beach via Goatley canoes. None of them would return. After they had landed on an incorrect area of the beach along the French coastline, a heavily-armed German patrol stumbled upon them and engaged the Raider force with unrelenting fire power. Abort was yelled, and the men hurried back to their canoes. In the next frantic moments, four men were severely injured and taken prisoner, four were on the run - to be eventually taken prisoner after a daring escape - and three were killed. The dead included the founder and inspirational leader and visionary of the Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF), March-Phillips, who was shot during a desperate attempt to swim to shore after his canoe was too damaged to escape. March-Phillips was a special operations veteran, proving remarkably successful in his daring and courageous missions.Combined Ops website The Commando Veterans website notes: \"In Memory of Major 39184 Gustavus Henry March-Phillipps DSO MBE Royal Artillery and Commando, Small Scale Raiding Force who died age 34 on 12 September 1942 Remembered with honour at ST.
